OSU,3e5b7g,claipo,2,Wed Jul 22 01:58:02 2015 UTC,I've been trying to clean up my Python and the professor I work with wants me to learn STATA so I figured this would be a cool way to get connected with other students who are also trying to pick up some skills!
OSU,3e5b7g,claipo,2,Wed Jul 22 02:01:10 2015 UTC,Nice. Same here about Python. I revisited it in the beginning of summer on codeacademy I haven't used it much yet.
OSU,3e5b7g,hbweb500,2,Wed Jul 22 02:09:20 2015 UTC,"If this gets up and running and there's sufficient interest, I'd be happy to give a talk and tutorial about Python with an emphasis on its use in machine learning and statistics applications."
OSU,3e5b7g,mtjess60,1 point,Wed Jul 22 13:25:42 2015 UTC,This is great. Python is an area that will probably have a lot of interest. I will contact you when we get to that stage and see if you are still interested!

OSU,3e5b7g,tk82892,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:02:06 2015 UTC,I checked and all I found was Big Data which doesn't really seem like what this is so I think it would be alright!
OSU,3e5b7g,misteryub,3,Wed Jul 22 02:05:02 2015 UTC,"Spent a semester with the Big Data club - great club, but I agree that it's a different scope. Each week would usually consist of a different person coming in (professor, industry professional, etc.), and they'd talk about how they use big data. Some memorable sessions I remember was an OSU professor talking about how big data is used for athlete performance analysis, while a guy from Chase discussed big data for banks. They'd occasionally also host tutorial sessions for things like Excel, SAS, etc. - but having you guys more devoted application is great! I feel like Data Analytics and Big Data clubs complement each other nicely, and could even do some cross-promotion and/or events."
OSU,3e5b7g,misteryub,2,Wed Jul 22 04:27:12 2015 UTC,Open to recent graduates? I think it would benefit me a lot at work (financial services industry) to attend something like this
OSU,3e5b7g,finnants,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:50:11 2015 UTC,"Ohio State guidelines say that for student orgs, 90% of members need to be enrolled, but alumni can be the other 10%."
OSU,3e5b7g,xam2y,1 point,Wed Jul 22 12:56:25 2015 UTC,Could we get around this by allowing people to attend meetings without being members?
OSU,3e5b7g,Letsgobucks2015,2,Wed Jul 22 13:14:14 2015 UTC,"That'd work, but those people wouldn't count as member for the minimum member requirements, which I don't think you'll have a problem meeting.  To be a ""New & Re-established Student Organization,"" you need 5 members, 90% of whom are currently enrolled.  After 2 years, you can become an ""Established Student Organization,"" which needs 15 members, 90% of whom are currently enrolled. This gets you an extra $1,000 in programming funding (3k instead of 2k for New & Re-established orgs), and you can use ""at The Ohio State University"" on publications."

It is going to be a ton of work + they won't even look at the appeal until after my summer class grade is in. All in all super frustrated by this process :[

Students were bundled up in winter coats.  Edit: OP, are you Canadian?"
OSU,3e4gag,xam2y,2,Tue Jul 21 22:56:47 2015 UTC,The tradeoff is that Arps is sweltering when it's hot out.

OSU,3e5cot,TheSnarfy,2,Wed Jul 22 02:07:06 2015 UTC,Its sorta up in the air in my experience. I've waited 2nd in the wait list until the day class started only to be told that the class was closed and no students would be added but the classes you mentioned are probably not this way. I've also got into classes where I was 50 something on the wait list. I'd say that there is probably a good chance of getting in especially if you go to the first class. A lot of people drop classes the first week or right before the semester starts. If your advisor feels comfortable with the situation then it I probably fine.
OSU,3e5cot,James_C_Corn,2,Wed Jul 22 02:37:58 2015 UTC,Alright cool. Thanks for the feedback! I just didn't wanna be wasting my time waiting and then end up only taking like 7 credits this semester. If that were the case I would look for a job. This helps me plan accordingly!
OSU,3e5cot,James_C_Corn,2,Wed Jul 22 02:41:20 2015 UTC,"If it's something you are worried about don't just take my word for it! Let the advisor know you are worried and email the professor letting them know that you are very interested in the class and would love to join if there was any space available come the fist day of class. This will help them know you exist, also try to be the first person at class on the first day so you can introduce yourself."
OSU,3e5cot,therealabefrohman,2,Wed Jul 22 02:45:11 2015 UTC,"I've gotten waitlisted for a few classes, and I emailed the professors to see what their opinion was. They ended up letting me in because I showed initiative and interest in the class. It might not always work, but it's worth a shot, and you can do it now before classes start!"
OSU,3e5cot,therealabefrohman,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:34:38 2015 UTC,Yeah I like this idea. It's just difficult when I have quite a few professors and TAs listed for the class. So I'm not exactly sure which one I am supposed to talk to. 😂😂😂
OSU,3e5cot,NotTheBomber,2,Wed Jul 22 03:42:01 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, that does make it way more difficult. Usually professors prefer when students go through the TAs, otherwise they'd get so many emails. Knowing this, I'd go with your advisor's suggestion so that way you'll know who to talk to. Sorry, that's a hard position to be in!"

OSU,3e2dd4,brutusb0104,5,Tue Jul 21 12:43:05 2015 UTC,"Su will probably be your best bet out of the two. Harper is not good for setting you up for the first exam (because last I heard it's written by su since kinematics is his research/speciality). Harper is kind of bad about posting example problems and what not, you have to either keep mentioning it to him or your TAs for him to put them up. Harper is an okay professor for the course but you will probably have less of a headache with Su. I take it you are also taking thermo, systems, and circuits? I might be missing one course in that fall semester group"
OSU,3e2dd4,huckle93,2,Tue Jul 21 15:20:00 2015 UTC,"Su is the lesser of the two evils, as already mentioned. What really sucks is that ME3670/3671 are some core classes that I use every day and yet they are the ones that are the most poorly taught of the 3000+ courses."

You should be able to schedule the interview early in the first few weeks, because there won't be any freshmen competing for spots.  Keep in mind that if you don't pass the interview the first time, you will have to come back and do it again, which could slow down your timeline a bit."
OSU,3e1mki,estrong24,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:54:47 2015 UTC,"All right, how high would you consider the bar to pass the interview?  I have answers prepared for every behavioral question as well as the usual ""tell me about yourself"" questions and ""what do you want to ask the company"" questions [tailored to fit the assigned practice company for the interview], but I'm an anxious person in general and might stumble over my words"
OSU,3e1mki,misteryub,2,Tue Jul 21 15:58:03 2015 UTC,"Honestly, it wasn't that hard. I practiced quite a bit, and I passed the first time. From what I understand, most people do not pass the first time. It sounds like you have the necessary answers prepared, which is good. I would run through it several times with a friend. My other suggestion would be to memorize everything you need to do at the beginning and end of the interview (express interest in the job, ask for business card, etc.)."

OSU,3e0kad,buckeyeguy232,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:58:10 2015 UTC,I'm taking this class right now this summer. I don't have that professor but I have Guliano. Everything is from Pearson MyOMLab. So it's really easy to follow what assignments you have due and everything.   This is one my first business classes that takes into account things you've learned from other classes. Such as business statistics stuff and logistics concepts. It's a little bit of a challenge but then again I'm taking a 3 credit class in 7 weeks so it's a lot at once and I think 14 weeks would be way easier.
OSU,3dzfs0,f_emasculata,4,Mon Jul 20 19:53:10 2015 UTC,"A lot will depend on what graduate program you're applying to and how competitive it is. Your post was a little unclear, but it sounds like you were enrolled at OSU and then un-enrolled to be back in Cleveland for personal reasons.  I've heard that un-enrolling can be a sort of black mark on your application, but your situation sounds legit and I'm sure, if given the opportunity to explain, this won't count against you (or at least not too much), especially if you have a strong GPA and test scores. Some graduate programs allow you to submit a ""Why Ohio State"" essay along with your application. If this is the case with your program, I'd highly recommend explaining your situation."
OSU,3dzfs0,ajw431,2,Mon Jul 20 20:39:29 2015 UTC,It's going to be program specific. I was told specifically that the astronomy program doesn't accept OSU undergrads so that they can go elsewhere and network. Also I think grad programs in general are more personal with you. I'm sure you could email someone in the department and talk with them about your specific situation and they'd be able to give you good advice.
OSU,3dzfs0,MasterThalpian,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:59:47 2015 UTC,"Of course you need the grades and scores to get in. That is a given. As far as leaving OSU and wishing to come back, I think as long as you explain you strong desire to come back, and give the very reasonable story of why you had to leave in the first place they shouldn't hold it against you in my opinion."
OSU,3dzfs0,estrong24,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:38:11 2015 UTC,"As everyone else has said, it's entirely program specific. However, I imagine how you got your degree as long as the degree is reputable is not going to really factor into any committee members minds. They're more worried about the specific qualities that their program values (GPA, Test Scores, Letters, Sample Work, prev. research, etc.) If you are really worried about it, have one of your letter writers explain what you went through and put a positive spin on it (managed coursework while dealing with difficult family situation).  Lastly, your background will work in your favor. Your department can enter you into a university wide competition for fellowships. One of them is for underrepresented persons (especially persons underrepresented in your field). These pay for coursework, come with a stipend, and have teaching responsibilities. Good for you and your department."

If you have a cord lock or a lock that isn't solid metal/doesn't have a key your bike will get stole . Some dorms have indoor bike storage so that's a good option too.

OSU,3dr3bd,chaoticpix93,3,Sat Jul 18 18:53:03 2015 UTC,For the past two semesters I have taken classes both at OSU and CSCC mainly because I'm not a fan of OSU's Math department. The credits have transferred over just fine for me. You get k credit for the class so the grade you got at CSCC doesn't count towards your GPA at OSU. I don't however know how the financial aid situation works in that respect. But classes transfer over flawlessly. You just have to request an official transcript to be sent over at the end of the semester.
OSU,3dr3bd,wch94,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:35:20 2015 UTC,"Awesome. I know GPA doesn't transfer, but do you know if the completed credit hours do?  It would make sense that they would."

OSU,3dr3bd,TheSnarfy,2,Sat Jul 18 23:08:32 2015 UTC,Short answer is yes you can be a transient student and transfer the credits back over. Make sure they cover what classes you need though.  However I want to give you a warning. If you need the class to cover a Gen Ed course you are only allowed to have 15 credits from outside schools to make up Gen Ed class credits. If you are taking classes to cover courses that are specifically part of your major you can only have 10 credits from outside schools.  I had to learn this ALMOST the hard way. I took accounting 1 and 2 through Rhodes State college online. They totalled 8 credits altogether. Since I'm I'm a business major that counted towards my Major transfer credits of 10. This Fall I wanted to take online Marketing from CSCC and it was a 3 credit hour class. I had a last minute visit with an advisor and found out that I can't do that. So now I have to just push marketing off til later semesters. I hadn't known there was a cap to how many outside credits we could use. That's why I almost messed up.   My final advice is to always meet with an advisor and be specific about what you are doing and how and make sure you ask what they think you should do.
OSU,3dr3bd,misteryub,2,Sat Jul 18 21:39:39 2015 UTC,"However, credits in the Ohio Transfer Assurance Guide will transfer."
OSU,3dr3bd,TheSnarfy,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:12:13 2015 UTC,Does this mean they will be part of the 10 allowed transfer credits or would that limit be completely ignored if they are completely allowed? Sorry to ask such minor questions but I guess my advisor wasn't quite clear either.
OSU,3dr3bd,misteryub,2,Sun Jul 19 01:47:52 2015 UTC,"http://fisher.osu.edu/undergraduate/advising/transfer-credit    A maximum of 10 semester hours of transfer credit may be accepted toward the required business core coursework.  NOTE: Students attending a college or university in the state of Ohio, please note all courses that are part of the Transfer Assurance Guide (TAG) will be accepted.

OSU,3dr3bd,TheSnarfy,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:33:48 2015 UTC,Thanks for the info on that! That clears things up. Looks like I won't be taking anymore outside courses for my major though sadly. 😂

The new combination field house and auditorium would use the stadium’s exterior north wall as its own south wall, and would use the stadium’s north dome as a stage. Hearing of the nascent plans in October 1944, the OSU Alumni Monthly called the appendage “nothing short of monstrosity,” and wrote again the following February, “From any angle, it looks screwy.” Relocated about 500 feet north, the octagon was reborn as St. John Arena"

OSU,3djojn,dipatel,2,Fri Jul 17 00:58:15 2015 UTC,drinking in a bar or club. obviously i drink because i have a case of beer but its not like i can go and just order a drink. although i am waiting on a fake
OSU,3djojn,ghoulmaster,5,Fri Jul 17 02:23:22 2015 UTC,hobbies?
OSU,3djojn,ghoulmaster,2,Thu Jul 16 23:23:49 2015 UTC,"video games of course, much like everyone else on the planet. being outside is also fun as well. i don't do tabletop games but i'm looking to get started in that"

OSU,3djojn,Sometimeswelose,8,Thu Jul 16 23:05:28 2015 UTC,"well, yeah, also in part to me being really shy before and not being able to talk to people on my own, but now in the past two years, i've really been able to open up to people and overcome my shortcomings of being shy"

OSU,3dki5c,raj96,7,Fri Jul 17 00:26:15 2015 UTC,After spring semester of year 2 your GPA must be a 3.2.
OSU,3dki5c,onyisraw,2,Fri Jul 17 00:57:13 2015 UTC,"Gotcha, so I'm assuming if you don't have a 3.2 it becomes a loan or something?"
OSU,3dki5c,WolfBad,6,Fri Jul 17 01:10:57 2015 UTC,"Most likely it would just revoked, and you would have to find money elsewhere (loans or other scholarships). Also, some scholarships will ""pause"" (revoked when your GPA dips below a 3.2 but applied again once you get your GPA up). Definitely make sure you read up on all the requirements your scholarships have"
OSU,3dki5c,ShreddedWheat,4,Fri Jul 17 01:32:01 2015 UTC,"Just fell into that situation for the fall semester. It is revoked, but then you can appeal it on the osu financial website - I forget the URL - stating that you have re-achieved the requirements."
OSU,3dki5c,CallMeRydberg,4,Fri Jul 17 05:11:25 2015 UTC,"If I were you, I'd try not to even let yourself get into the position to find that out. You'll be fine. Good luck!"
OSU,3dki5c,Featherfy,3,Fri Jul 17 01:32:02 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the tip, I just think it's important to be aware y'know? Like I know what minimum wage is, but that's not what I'm shooting for if that makes sense."
OSU,3dki5c,bigdaddyEm,2,Fri Jul 17 01:44:02 2015 UTC,it definitely won't be a loan unless financially you qualify for a loan
OSU,3dki5c,Featherfy,4,Fri Jul 17 17:06:59 2015 UTC,Did they combine the Maximus and the National Buckeye for you?  They refused combine the Prominence and the Nat. Buck. for me.
OSU,3dki5c,rivaset101,3,Fri Jul 17 04:00:53 2015 UTC,Yeah that's one of the few combinable duos
OSU,3dki5c,darthgallion,3,Fri Jul 17 04:03:12 2015 UTC,And I think they check every year after. So you have the first two years to maintain/raise it to 3.2+ and then you have to not dip below that every year after
OSU,3dinie,EvManiac,6,Thu Jul 16 16:05:03 2015 UTC,"Tabletop Gaming Association does tabletop. I don't know which actual games, I haven't been there since 2012. But you can get more info here http://ohiounion.osu.edu/get_involved/student_organizations/directory?org_id=920"

OSU,3djbxk,raj96,4,Thu Jul 16 19:02:26 2015 UTC,"Coordinate with your roommates, first and foremost.  Lincoln has a fridge, freezer, and microwave.  A shoe rack is helpful. One thing that was invaluable were wire cubes in the bathroom - one for each person to store their shower stuff."
OSU,3djbxk,TrueBlonde,5,Fri Jul 17 00:52:19 2015 UTC,"Some stuff my suite had:   If multiple people are going to want to use Ethernet at the same time, getting an unmanaged switch such as this one is a good idea. If multiple people bring TVs a coax splitter like this one is great for gameday. If your planning on having larger gatherings in your suite (for mario kart or away games or something) a fan is nice to keep it cool, because they can get hot when a lot of people are in there.   And finally, go to west fest. Don't be afraid to talk to people there. It's a great way to get to know people in your building, and most of the people there are also new to OSU and looking to make friends."
OSU,3djbxk,rax96,3,Fri Jul 17 05:39:24 2015 UTC,I would recommend bringing extra furniture for the common room. Freshman year we had a small futon and sophomore year we had a few extra chairs. That made it more comfortable for everyone to hang out. Someone in the suite should bring a TV. Microwave and fridge are provided. For a suite full of girls who had a ton of bathroom/beauty shit it was helpful to have a shelving unit in the bathroom for everyone to store their stuff on.
OSU,3djbxk,AlwaysHalfAsleep,3,Thu Jul 16 20:44:39 2015 UTC,I let all my suitemates supply the stuff for the common room. No way in Hell was I gonna let my stuff sit out there and get trashed for a year lol. We cleaned the common room twice the entire year. Once before Christmas and once when we left.
OSU,3djbxk,Redskins5,3,Fri Jul 17 03:14:33 2015 UTC,Bring a 30' Ethernet cable so you can connect the gaming console in the living room to be Internet. You can't connect it to the wifi and some rooms don't have Ethernet ports close!
OSU,3djbxk,Jkizzle9,2,Fri Jul 17 16:04:45 2015 UTC,"yes and even if you don't have a gaming console, definitely bring for your laptop. Wifi in the larger dorms can be horrible, especially during finals and depending on your room locaiton even though routers are verywhere"
OSU,3djbxk,Featherfy,3,Fri Jul 17 17:08:32 2015 UTC,"Just my two cents, something that my roommates and I always found handy was some sort of stereo to blare your music."

OSU,3diplt,signore_piteo,5,Thu Jul 16 18:10:21 2015 UTC,"Did you ever appeal it? It being a Friday makes things iffy, but the Friday after Thanksgiving is when the university observes Columbus Day, so offices were closed."

I feel sorry for everyone that has to have her lecture 100% of the time.  We had these weird ""We're going to give you a log log plot without any minor axis lines, put a speck on the screen, and you have to guess the value to one decimal point!"" Carmen quizzes that ended up being ~5% of your grade. It was terrible. Those were the brainchild of Alison & the classic Dr. Heckler from Physics. If you search around on here you can find stories of her latest education experiments."
OSU,3dcibu,sxeQ,2,Thu Jul 16 23:41:12 2015 UTC,"FWIW (/u/jamkk1023) I took it this past semester and it wasn't bad, she didn't really mess around with the teaching style. She did all the lectures, and recitations were taught by grad student TAs. The midterms were all fairly easy, none of the homework was really difficult, and even though her lectures weren't necessarily the best, it wasn't a hard class at all.  The most annoying part of it was when we'd be trying to do stuff in recitation that we were going to learn in the next lecture, but our TA usually just walked us through those bits.  And yeah, those carmen quizzes were kind of bullshit."

Try the faculty research section on department websites too, they often have links to research webpages that'll help you find out what they're doing so you can be more informed when you apply.

OSU,3d91um,mrdillonman,10,Tue Jul 14 13:23:57 2015 UTC,"Having had every provider, I prefer WOW. They're the only provider that even offers a 110Mbps internet speed, and it's $60/month. Seriously, compare that to anything. The only catch is if it's even available where you live. Bottom line, if WOW is available, it's the best option, especially for internet-only households (best price value)  Uverse's billing is variable, shitty, and shady. Service is acceptable overall, but please note that some areas near campus are limited to 24Mbps. If you don't bundle their TV service, they'll charge an exorbitant installation fee.  TWC offers stable service, and is pretty much the benchmark. Again, max speed is 50Mbps, but its like $65/mo."
OSU,3d91um,andrew522,3,Tue Jul 14 13:46:54 2015 UTC,"I just wanna point out this: If you're surrounded by people with TWC, you are not gonna have a good time. I forget exactly how it is this occurs, but due to their technology, the more people in a condensed space using the service, the shittier it is. This is not the case with AT&T."
OSU,3d91um,TheEsqimo,2,Tue Jul 14 19:11:29 2015 UTC,"The only thing I can think of is if the default wireless channel is used on everyone's router so there's more signal interference than if the tech analyzed the spectrum and selected the most open frequency, but I don't think anyone does that. Otherwise that really shouldn't make a difference how many people are connected in one area. You're all going to be connected to the same copper line going to the nearest hub, and that's the case for every ISP in Columbus. AT&T solicitors will come to your door and tell you they run fiber to your house (they did to me) but it's bullshit."
OSU,3d91um,Na__th__an,2,Tue Jul 14 21:16:18 2015 UTC,I don't think they told me it was fiber being run out but the TWC rep who came by yesterday confirmed that AT&T uses a system different from TWC which avoids this problem.

They will be discussion based, with a high importance placed on attendance and participation. ""Linguistics""  is actually a very broad subject,  so while you might love one class/be very talented at it,  you might really struggle with another one.  For example,  I loved loved loved psycholinguistics but couldn't wait to get out of syntax.   If Julie McGory is the professor for a class,  take that class. She is amazing. Other professors I've really liked are Deborah Morton and Peet Klecha. Though honestly,  I've never had a bad professor.   My favorite classes I've taken are phonetics, linguistic meaning, language and the mind (psycholinguistics), and language endangerment and death.  Edit: The department is actually really large. It's just that reddit itself tends to attract more engineering/hardcore STEM types. I've often felt alone on this subreddit."
OSU,3d7fw5,lilpetunia,2,Tue Jul 14 13:07:51 2015 UTC,"Haha yes exactly! I feel like I'm surrounded by engineering majors (not that engineering majors are a bad thing). I've met Julie McGory a couple of times, the last time being orientation, where she helped me and one (yes, one) other future linguistics major schedule our classes. Seems super nice, kinda quirky...I can completely see her being an awesome professor. I'm glad the classes are on the smaller side and more discussion oriented. I'm sure it's easier to focus that way, and probably more fun, seeing as I'd rather get to know my classmates and professor than never have the chance to speak to them in a huge lecture hall.  I'm really excited to see which areas I like most. I think it's one of the more interesting majors because it seems like it can connect to just about any other area of study. One question - do you have any specific plans job-wise (assuming you just graduated)? What did the people the people you graduated with go on to do after school? Or do most stay on to get their masters/PhD?  Thank you for answering! Super helpful, and it's nice to know that there are some linguistics people still alive out there"
OSU,3d7fw5,eritain,2,Tue Jul 14 14:23:25 2015 UTC,"I have a year left. Unfortunately,  I'm not really planning on using my linguistics degree (going to grad school for audiology,  hopefully). Most linguistics professors I've met encourage majors to avoid grad school if possible -- most non-academia linguistics jobs don't really need advanced degrees,  so it would be a waste of time and money.   If you like computers,  a lot of people I know are combined computer science and linguistics. There are also people in advertising and in speech pathology. But probably the most people I know went into teaching ESL."
OSU,3d7fw5,OffthePortLobe,2,Tue Jul 14 15:27:05 2015 UTC,"I'll jump on the ""very broad subject"" bit: OSU Linguistics has 14 different specialties from all over the map. If you're into neurology, or abstract mathematics, or ancient literature, or post-colonialism, there are linguistics courses for you. And if you're interested in more than two or three, you're not too far from a minor. Just five courses, and some of them count for general ed too."

My biggest suggestion is always take the honors version of a class if you can. class size maxes at 25, but they are no harder than the regular version, sometimes even easier. Also, once you take the undergrad version of a class, they let you take the grad version, and I strongly suggest doing that for any class you loved. The professors get way more into it, and will always be willing to work with you since they'll know you're an undergrad. It also shows them how interested you are, so can open the door to doing research with them."

Sometimes it's worthwhile to talk to your professors and ask if they are in need of Student Research Assistants or if they know any other professors who are looking. It's not a great chance that they'll be paid positions, but there is no harm in asking."
OSU,3d6371,Sandor17,2,Tue Jul 14 03:49:29 2015 UTC,Drive for CABS. They pay for you and train you to get a Class B Commercial drivers license. Driving in circles for a couple hours is a pretty good way to make a buck.

If you are looking for a job at the library that lets you study while working, you will probably need work study. I work at the library and nearly everyone is a work study student....they rarely offer non-work study jobs."
OSU,3d5cwk,allosaurus_rex,14,Mon Jul 13 17:30:07 2015 UTC,"Do not buy textbooks before class starts. Do not buy them until you are absolutely sure that you need them. They are a huge waste of money if you do not use them (and even if you do.) The instructor will put the name of the book on the syllabus. Sometimes, even if they say that you need them, you use them once or twice. If you wait and don't have the book in time when you need it, just ask another classmate who has it if you can borrow it or do homework with them or whatever until you have it; easy way to make a friend. You could also ask someone to split the cost and share it.  I use a website called bigwords.com, it looks throughout the web for the cheapest price for textbooks. Renting a textbook is generally the cheapest option. If your textbook happens to be some sort of novel, look for it at the library; I was able to keep that book for the entire semester because no one else requested it.  Also, if you rent a textbook, KEEP EVERYTHING. Receipts and all that. I sent a rental textbook back (payed about $30 for it) and UPS lost it. The company and UPS claim that they have no way of getting the tracking number for it, so the company charged me $108 without any notice and I have no proof to get it back. Make sure you know the tracking number."

OSU,3d1vhl,mtjess60,4,Sun Jul 12 22:20:31 2015 UTC,"Some people buy student tickets from other students and give them to friends and/or family. They're a lot cheaper than non-student tickets; however, they say ""BuckID required"" on the tickets. Most of the ushers do not care and don't check for BuckIDs anyway. Once everyone is in the South Stands, you just find some seats that nobody is using and sit there. I would suggest going towards the top rows of the south stands, just to avoid conflict with other students.   It would be a lot harder to get your friends/family into Block O. I know that sometimes they use wristbands for admission into the Block O section so that students cannot sneak extra friends in. You could buy Block O South tickets from other students, however, they usually sell for more than the standard South Stand student tickets."

OSU,3d1fcg,randomguy3167,2,Sun Jul 12 19:00:02 2015 UTC,"I think most people take them at the same time, but I liked taking 2510 and 2540 staggered because the lab potentially gets into stuff you haven't learned in 2510 yet.  It's good to be able to grasp the basics before you jump into the lab -- at least it was for me.  In the lecture you go over the stuff you'll be doing (like reactions and stuff as well as the lab procedure) in the next lab, as well as get tips for the lab reports and stuff.  And it's a grade composed of lab reports, lab points (safety/following directions/etc), quizzes, and a final exam.    I got Bs in both lectures but As in both labs, and I think the reason the labs weren't so bad for me was because I took lab and lecture staggered.  I also think it would be fine to take it with a bio lab or even a physics lab, because those are relatively easy classes compared to ochem or some major classes.  I took 2550 with Physics 1201 + lab."
OSU,3d1fcg,dark_moose09,0,Sun Jul 12 19:09:17 2015 UTC,"What do you mean ""both"" labs? Does 2510 also have its own lab? So you have to take two separate labs? What kind of stuff did these quizzes or final exam cover? I'm kind of confused as to what they would test you over, especially since you said lecture just went over lab procedure stuff. And are these reactions they teach you stuff you don't learn in 2510?"
OSU,3d1fcg,Zigran7,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:19:26 2015 UTC,There are 4 main Ochem classes: Ochem I & II and Ochem Lab I & II.
OSU,3d1fcg,dark_moose09,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:29:51 2015 UTC,"Ok, yeah I know that. He didn't really say that he was talking about Ochem 2 so I was confused. That makes more sense."
OSU,3d1fcg,dark_moose09,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:50:20 2015 UTC,"There are 2 labs (each with their own lecture) and 2 lectures (that are both lectures)  2510 and 2520 are Ochem1 and 2,  2540 and 2550 are Ochem lab 1 and 2  I had to take all four for my major.  The stuff they test you over in lab is some lab procedure and some mechanistic/reaction stuff, so it's basically some of the same stuff you will learn and go over in 2510 and 2520 PLUS lab specific stuff... that's why taking 2510 one semester and 2540 the next semester helped me. I had already learned pretty much everything content-wise in 2510 that we did labs over in 2540.  So it's like 2510 lecture class goes with the 2540 lab,  and then 2520 lecture class goes with the 2550 lab.  Everything covered in 2540 has been covered in 2510 except for lab specific stuff (procedures, some spectroscopy). Same goes for 2550 and 2520.  The 2510 and 2520 lectures cover basically the core content of organic chemistry.  The lectures of 2540 and 2550 cover some content (that has been covered in 2510 and 2520 as well) and also lab stuff.  Does that make sense?  Think of it as ochem 1 and 2, and ochem lab 1 and 2. Most classes have labs AS A PART of the lecture class (like gen chem, physics, bio...).  Ochem has separated the labs from the lectures because it's too much content to cover and/or the material would be too difficult for students to handle combined."
OSU,3d1fcg,Sub1n,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:40:09 2015 UTC,"Yes, that makes sense. I know Ochem is supposed to be hard. Are the lab or the tests/quizzes that hard? (2540/2550)"
OSU,3d1fcg,radical13,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:43:58 2015 UTC,"I didn't think they were too bad, but again, taking 2510 before I took 2540 helped because I already knew most of the material.  I personally found the quizzes in 2540 to be easier than in 2550.  2550 has a couple of spectroscopy quizzes that were pretty hard, and occasionally they would have a question I would look at and go WTF?? But 75% of the time it was pretty easy.  It's a hard question to answer.  Some things I struggled with were easy for others, and vice-versa.  I also had physics lab RIGHT before ochem lab 2, so I was never super prepared for those quizzes since I had 2 hours of physics right before"

OSU,3d1fcg,Eojis,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:20:12 2015 UTC,"Physics 1201 & lab are super easy. Ochem sucks. I did fine in gen chem (I actually took it at a different school-- a damn private school, so there's no way it was 'easier' than osu, and I got an A and a B in 1&2, As in both labs). But once I got to ochem, it was like they want you to fail. I would highly suggest taking ochem lab after ochem, purely because the latter is just so much work. I did fine in lab, but horribly in lecture and I took them at the same time. I was also taking physics 1201, which took up none of my time. Especially if you've taken physics before, it'll be simple. Unless you're taking 1250, which you shouldn't do unless you're required to because it's unnecessarily difficult.  Sorry for the rant. TL;DR: take  ochem lecture and lab in different semesters, physics 1201 will be fine, if you're good at calc/physics, then 1250 would also be fine to take at the same time."
OSU,3d1fcg,Eojis,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:22:20 2015 UTC,"I don't know about that. The reason why gen chem is so hard here is that everything is graded on a curve and you basically have to compete against everyone else just to pass. (They have a quota of people that can pass and count down for grades.) Also, in the second gen chem, multiple labs took off a decent amount of points for accuracy. (I'm assuming like in ochem.) Also, you have to do all the labs and lab reports (with a couple exceptions) by yourself unlike gen bio and physics. It is like they want you to fail like you said with ochem. Take all this into account. (I do have friends who went to smaller schools.) Of course, if you study hard you'll be fine, but big lecture hall intro classes still suck, physics 1250/1 included. I don't know about your previous school specifically, but it's not like this at my friends's schools. Other than that I agree with all you said. Don't take 1250/1 if you don't have to and 1200/1 is indeed easy from what I've seen from friends. (I took 1250/1 for engineering.) Thanks for the advice!"

OSU,3d1fcg,Featherfy,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:35:48 2015 UTC,"Okay, I heard that you lose a lot of points for accuracy though. Is that true? Also, I assume labs are by yourself again like in CHEM 120/20 right?"
OSU,3d1fcg,xam2y,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:01:43 2015 UTC,"you have a partner that you'll work closely with, but I think only like 1 lab in each ochem lab class directly requires them. It's helpful to make friends with them early on, so you don't get stuck with someone who hate all semester. They should be the first person you ask for help when you need it (your TA is super busy).   I'm not sure what you mean by accuracy. Part of a few of the labs is graded on % yield, but that was like 5-10% of the report grade max, and if you had a measurable quantity, you got like 30% of the yield points already."

I lost so much money until I broke down and finally rebought the campus parc membership. Dude, it's not cheap, but it's worth the convenience and assurance."
OSU,3cypgq,floralsforspring,8,Sun Jul 12 04:47:05 2015 UTC,I second this. Commuted for a semester and did free street parking. The absurd amount of money for a pass is unfortunately worth it.

OSU,3cypgq,TrueBlonde,2,Sun Jul 12 13:35:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but that is downtown in the CBD where parking is at a premium. It is absolutely ridiculous for (1) OSU's parking to be controlled by an Australian investment firm (but that is a different story) and (2) charge that much money to park when space is not an issue. That is why it is no surprise that the faculty, who really don't agree on anything, actually came together for once to protest the parking privatization."
OSU,3cypgq,TheTodd15,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:07:40 2015 UTC,"Even before CampusParc, parking passes cost roughly the same amount. If parking were free or cheaper, space WOULD be an issue because so many more people would drive. Privatizing the parking was dumb, though."
OSU,3cypgq,TrueBlonde,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:11:36 2015 UTC,"I thought student prices had risen, but I couldn't find any information on that. I'm almost certain that visitor parking, like in the Ohio Union garage is more expensive now. Plus faculty parking did rise 50% last year, even though the rate is capped at 5.5%.   I guess my original point was that I still think the prices are a tad ridiculous. And comparing it to downtown Columbus is not fair. Of course you are going to pay a shit ton of money to park downtown. I'm just saying that OSU and downtown are very different situations."
OSU,3cypgq,TheTodd15,2,Mon Jul 13 18:54:54 2015 UTC,"I found this from 2011. Looks like rates have gone up ~6.5% a year which I would say is partially due to normal increases (I forget what tuition increases by each year) and partially due to a jump from switching to CampusParc.  Also, I park in the north end of the Arena district so it's not downtown proper. Garages in the actual downtown are often $150/month. I think the Arena district is much more comparable to OSU campus."
OSU,3cypgq,TrueBlonde,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:20:19 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, it appears that faculty were hit the hardest, and I believe event parking has risen to a significant degree as well.

The elevator shaft was completely removed and the service pit was filled with concrete so that it was flush with the new basement floor. The doors (stuck in place) and the door frame are the only things left (the contractor probably didn't feel like dealing with it). This is located in the mechanical/electrical room side of the basement, which is essentially separate from the classroom side. The door is secured with a key that is well-controlled by the lock shop and is difficult to procure; it is generally only issued to facilities personnel or certain IT organizations (e.g. OCIO).

That is because their service is so terrible that they will reduce your bill to nothing and give you free months so that you don't cancel your service.

OSU,3csv1b,xam2y,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:40:40 2015 UTC,"I would disagree with this advice. 4511 is basically a condensed version of the three biochem courses for majors (the 561X series Sub1n is referring to). Only taking the first course would limit the amount of biochem you'd be exposed to, which wouldn't be helpful for the MCAT. Metabolism and DNA replication are taught in the second and third courses in that series, so you wouldn't be exposed to them at all if you try for the 561x series. Definitely take 4511. And you'll be fine taking it concurrently with OChem 2. The Biochemistry department understands that many students will be doing this and are very lenient with the OChem application portions."

OSU,3cqzu9,datwhackmackattack,7,Fri Jul 10 02:00:28 2015 UTC,"More of a don't be stupid type deal in terms of cops. My only interactions with a cop have been because 1) my roomie's friend was taking a piss on Buckeye Donuts drunk as hell and 2) because people were going nuts after the national championship. Biggest incident involving cops I saw as a freshman in dorms was when a girl came back with alcohol poisoning and needed to be taken to the hospital. So ya, don't be an idiot. Know your limits, don't do anything too stupid. RA's usually don't want to deal with the hassle as long as you appear to be somewhat safe and stable. There is the occasional watchful hawk RA who actively tries to bust people but these are few and far between. Again, just don't be stupid and have a rowdy party of 20 underages in your tiny room on a Friday night.  As for campus stuff, that's a little bit of both. There are more green spaces on South currently so there are more outdoor events that happen there (although they aren't necessarily for just people living on South). This may change as the construction on North clears up. There are also some nice green spaces on West with the soccer fields and what not. Liveliness really just depends on who you hang out with. In any dorm there can be a room full of party animals or a room full of League of Legends champions. Just hang with who you want to hang with and things will fall into place."
OSU,3cqzu9,ScootusBuckeye,4,Fri Jul 10 02:15:14 2015 UTC,"Spot on on alcohol. I was at a house party one time and the cops showed up (luckily I was of age by then) but really all they did was ask people if they were 21 and if you said yes without much hesitation they moved on. Some dumb kid who wasn't was extraordinarily evasive and really just being an ass about giving his age so they cuffed him, put him in the back of the car and wrote him a citation and gave him a court date."
OSU,3cqzu9,The64only,3,Fri Jul 10 03:02:14 2015 UTC,"Get a fake ID as house parties are usually reserved for bigger occasions (welcome week, Halloween, football blocks). The bars that are 18+ are few and far between and usually charge a ton for drinks."
OSU,3cqzu9,aevans395,2,Fri Jul 10 19:06:26 2015 UTC,You'll need a fake for the bars.
OSU,3cqzu9,RobinKennedy23,2,Fri Jul 10 03:02:34 2015 UTC,"The cops usually are not the problem. The problem is the ATF/CPD stings that happen frequently during the fall. They target large house parties where people are drinking on the lawn. It's legal to drink on your own property, but they can (and will) card you. One of my friends was carrying a beer in a brown bag during one of these parties on Chitt and was arrested. The guy tried to arrest me, too, because he thought that my ID was fake. When that didn't work, he tried to accuse me of purchasing the alcohol for my friend. It was a pretty shitty night. However, I've been at many parties where the police were called and never once did they arrest or cite everyone. They always just said, turn down the music, if we have to come back we will start ID'ing people. So the best advice I can give you: do not ever, EVER drink outside if you are underage, if you are transporting alcohol keep it inside a bookbag and not a grocery bag, and do not drink outside at a party even if your drink is in a solo cup or is unlabeled."
OSU,3cqzu9,arijen,2,Fri Jul 10 04:28:05 2015 UTC,"Fake IDs aren't worth it. Student Legal is always representing people who get caught with them and end up being charged with an underage and fraud. Just get someone to go get the alcohol for you or go to house parties. At house parties, don't step on the sidewalk and try to go to ones that aren't totally packed. At street parties be careful because every one I've gone to has been shut down by cops on horses and people start getting arrested.  Big Bar is the only 18+ bar on campus that I've gone to, but it's not too great (freshly turned 18 year old girls and 40 year old men avoiding their wives). Park Street is a fun time if you have a way to get there and back. You can give cash to someone (i.e. a 21+ friend unless you trust drunk strangers) and have them bring the drink back to you. Just try to avoid the bouncers. They'll take the drink out of your hand and throw it away if they notice you don't have a wristband."
OSU,3cqzu9,Aubrieee,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:29:35 2015 UTC,"If you're going to drink underage, be advised that cops love sitting on High Street waiting for the underage freshmen/sophomores to make their way back from off-campus parties to the dorms. Anybody who is visibility intoxicated stands to get noticed and may have to deal with the consequences. This is especially common the first couple weeks after move in."

If you really want to party inside a dorm, just keep it low-profile (no loud music, keep the door closed, only a few people, etc.)."
OSU,3cqzu9,thelazymastermind,0,Fri Jul 10 21:19:49 2015 UTC,"Here's some information on Fraternity Life/Drinking.  South campus is where majority of freshman are. I know you said you are 20, so this might be a turnoff for you, but then again, maybe not. Underclassmen are usually the ones doing the partying. Past the south campus dorms (towards the gateway) is where most of the off-campus parties are. I think it's 11th?  That being said, maybe it's just me, but I don't know many people who party, and I don't party myself, so I can't really offer anything beyond that.  And maybe I'm really lame but what you said about hazing   I expect some serious hazing and such   is kind of disturbing."

OSU,3cr72i,stormyzephyr,14,Fri Jul 10 03:02:45 2015 UTC,"Personally, it's because I'm stuck in a lecture where the material is dry and it's some GE class I don't care about but I am forced to take. Or another option is that the professor is a terrible instructor, only at OSU for research, and just doesn't give a single shit."

OSU,3cr72i,nevertricked,4,Fri Jul 10 03:25:38 2015 UTC,"There are some lectures I'm never bored in, and there are some lectures that I can hardly stand to attend.  If I'm extremely bored in a class it's most likely because it doesn't interest me, the material is review for me, or the delivery/subject matter is really really dry. Or shoot, I could just be tired from studying and doing class work the night before.  Sometimes, you just can't make lectures entertaining. Unless it's Barrett's lecture and you drink anytime he says ""Myay?"".  E: This doesn't have anything with this post you posted a month ago, does it? Seems like you've already answered your own question."
OSU,3cr72i,RapesBuffalos,2,Fri Jul 10 04:18:12 2015 UTC,"True, that was me..:). The reason I am asking this again is that I am now working as a grader/GTA for one of the Profs. in the ME department. Even though his lectures are quite good, I still see students getting bored and antsy (some keep surreptitiously texting despite his ban on electronic stuff). So, I wonder if this is a generational thing (I am an older guy trying to get a Masters'), or perhaps something is wrong with the way the lectures are designed (mind you, his lectures are seemingly well-planned, with several problems interspersed amidst theory)."
OSU,3cr72i,joshglick,4,Fri Jul 10 12:26:22 2015 UTC,If you think students bored in lectures is a generational thing feel free to watch any high school or college film from the 80s and I'd be willing to bet most or all of them have a scene with students bored / sleeping in class.
OSU,3cr72i,finnants,2,Fri Jul 10 17:13:56 2015 UTC,"Plus, another reason in asking this question is I want to become a lecturer (teach at some good ME institutions), and I wanna get a head-start on the future of lecturing!"
OSU,3cr72i,licoricesnocone,1 point,Fri Jul 10 12:30:03 2015 UTC,"For me, it's usually when a professor puts no effort into the delivery or clearly doesn't pay attention to the students' reactions. I think that a lecture in a subject I care about deeply can get boring quickly with terrible delivery, and a subject I'm not interested in can become interesting if the professor knows how to teach it well.  tl;dr: dry delivery is boring"

OSU,3cpegc,Sub1n,6,Thu Jul 9 18:32:21 2015 UTC,It really depends on the game. Last year I think I heard people selling them anywhere from around 20 to 70 per ticket depending on the quality of the opponent mostly.

OSU,3coryv,lizneudeck,4,Thu Jul 9 15:49:13 2015 UTC,"I had a few friends in LAR (lane avenue residence) last year, they said they loved the rooms, and the commute to campus wasn't that bad. The PAD, which is located there has good food for breakfast but lunch/dinner is horrible. The dorm use to hold the engineering scholars group, but that moved to the new north campus towers. Social aspect depends on the floors, the scholars group was kinda social since they all had the same classes together so they new everyone.   Also last year the dorm activities board put on a big winter formal and a haunted house that was not that bad."
OSU,3coryv,NotYourAcadAdvisor,2,Thu Jul 9 16:24:58 2015 UTC,"I lived there last year and it was awesome. The rooms are huge compared to the other  dorms. The PAD is right downstairs and it has a small convince store so you can get milk, bread, and other items. There is a pretty big game room where you can play ping pong, foosball, or pool ( big as in space not activities). There is also a TV in the game room as well as a small kitchen area. The kitchen area is small and the fridge is only for staff use. There is also a laundry room and you have to pay for laundry. The good news is you can pay with you're buckid, but to be honest it would be better to just use quarters. As for the social aspect it really depends on your floor. I know last year my floor was very social and most of us left our doors open. You are close to high street ( although not the part with anything good other than Walgreen's). You also have a panera next door and if you think you will never eat there think again. The location is so convenient that you will want to eat it. The commute to classes are not that bad. Being a first engineering your longest walk may be 25 minutes tops. To be honest the only downside I found to living there was football season. Lane avenue is where everyone comes to tailgate and it gets LOUD. If you live in a room that faces campus you won't be able to sleep in on football saturdays. But if you live in a room facing the trail you will hardly hear the tailgating. There is a trail behind the building and it is great for running or just taking a walk. If you're looking for a gym there is JO north half a block away. If you ever want to socialize I will be living in LARH again this year on the 6th floor. My door is always open as well a few other doors on the floor. Welcome to LARH and good luck on your first year. My biggest tip for engineering is never stop studying. If you have free time then you probably forgot to do something academic related lol."

If I remember correctly, it leads to a small courtyard with a (not running) fountain, some beautiful landscaping, and some benches. Perfect spot for some quiet reading.  It's tricky to get out once you go in though, as the door will lock behind you. If you go down the stairs and to the left there should be a lower level door which is usually unlocked and has some office rooms inside.

Then just took a random set of stairs down to the basement and it spit us out right in the entrance of the pool. It was near an entrance to the kitchen and some big filing room. There was also a huge entrance to the steam tunnels. Inceredibly expansive. The pool has graffiti and a fence around it. And the bleachers are used as a filing system. pretty cool though.

OSU,3cmrf1,bigdaddyEm,6,Thu Jul 9 02:56:17 2015 UTC,"way way better than a quad on north let me tell you.   Learn the bus schedules; the stop is right outside and the right bus will take you exactly where you need to go.  Your bathroom is cleaned FOR you.   There's a common area so when your roommates have friends over and you're trying to study, they'll go hang out there. NOT in the middle of the study room. You won't realize how nice this is until you have a midterm to study for but can't cause your asshole roommates are inconsdierate. yea yea I lived in Taylor Tower and this is the ONE reason I hated it  Food is IN your hall. Winters get cold AF and you won't want to leave. Your stockpiles will run low and you'll spend more time thinking about getting food than doing it if you lived somewhere else. Might not be the best, but you can either stay in Morrill or just go walk 5 minutes to the RPAC. In addition, the new meal plans  are kinda stupid yes but they also lean towards dining halls more than other food locations so it's sorta an advantage  You're 5 minutes from the RPAC.  You're also kinda close to a library. Actually it's kinda the same distance regardless of where you live north, south, west  Idk if you wanted a quad or not. If you wanted one on north, I promise morrill is the better choice. If you wanted a double...well idk the whole having 2 people in one room stresses ME out because everything I'm doing somehow effects the other person directly. (late night studying, watching a movie, etc; while other person is sleeping.)  Everyone disses Morrill, but a lot actually stay another year after because they love it so much. Ignore the freshman complaints on the internet.  In response to the desktop...it can get a little cramped. I had a 21.5"" (?) monitor and it fit pretty well though got a bit cramped when the keyboard was added."
OSU,3cmrf1,Featherfy,5,Thu Jul 9 13:15:42 2015 UTC,you are also 5 seconds from the stadium :)
OSU,3cmrf1,darthgallion,3,Thu Jul 9 13:39:18 2015 UTC,"For a quad, it's probably the best place on campus to have a quad.  Sure, space is tight. But you have a bedroom to sleep in, a study room to study in, and a large communal room to hang out in. Chances are that all four of you won't be in the study room all at the same time.  It's air conditioned, you don't have to leave the building during winter for food, it's close to the stadium, and it's by the campus loop buses. You're close to the gym too.  As for the desktop, it would be doable but tight. You could put the tower either on the floor or on the shelves above the desk. If you had the tower and monitor on the desk there might not be much room to work. You might consider bringing some sort of keyboard tray to save more space too.  The only drawback to West Campus in my eyes is the distance to High Street. But, you're going to save a ton of money and not waste your meal plan."

The pro is that you don't have to clean the bathroom at all, like you would if you had a private one. Other than the bathroom and lounge area in your suite, I don't like morrill. It's also far away from most classes (15 minute walks, probably more in snow), and feels really run down."

My main complaint was the walk/bike ride between the shoe and tennis courts in the the winter,  bebcause it gets really windy there.  Also, I would've liked a window that opens to get fresh air.  The quads did look crowded by comparison, but not any more so than the other dorms on campus, and having three separate rooms is nice.  Food in the building is very nice in the winter.  Before dorms started being renovated, Morrill and Lincoln were two of the few dorms without any false fire alarms.    Freshmen like to act like the towers are the worst because they're far from High and omg partying and such, but they're actually nice.

I made a ton of friends on my floor, there was A/C, the bathroom was cleaned, and plenty of room (even for people in the quads and we're talking girls with a ton of stuff because they only spent time in there to sleep). There are study rooms on the 15th floor and the RPAC is right there for food because Morrill still needs some work on quality. The commute is not bad, coming from someone with classes that ranged from Ag campus to Sullivant Hall near the Union and a boyfriend that lived all the way on 15th. You are right by a bus stop for CLS and CLN which is extremely convenient. Furthermore, Lincoln tends to be quieter and more conducive to getting work done. It's nearly silent on Sundays but every other night you can usually find someone up playing video games, hanging out, etc. Dorm life is what you make it, so make it great."

OSU,3cmvus,RobinKennedy23,5,Fri Jul 10 20:15:43 2015 UTC,"I disagree. A quad in Lincoln is fine. You have one room for sleeping, another for studying, and another for hanging out. Chances are that all four people won't be studying at the same time. Plus, you have a huge bathroom that is cleaned for you.  I spent 2 years in Lincoln and loved it, one of those years in a quad. You're right on the bus line and walking across the parking lot to Morrill isn't really that bad. Plus there's the vending machines with frozen food on floor 5 in a pinch."

OSU,3ck0lu,brutusb0104,3,Wed Jul 8 14:45:35 2015 UTC,I took numerical methods with vish. I personally though the class was easy as long as you stayed up to date with the homework. Lectures can get extremely boring but as long as you understand the base concepts you'll be fine. As far as I know both lecturers are just fine. I had friends in the other lectures and they didn't have too many terrible things to say.
OSU,3ck0lu,YUNoLikeSalad,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:13:49 2015 UTC,"It's not too bad, not the worst class in that set of ME classes. Vish will give you really dumb exams, all multiple choice, no partial credit, none of the above answers too just in case you wanted to second guess yourself even more and they are worth a big chunk of your grade. The program homeworks  aren't too bad, I remember the first one being kind of hard. Do the practice problems for the exam and get the book to put posted notes in because it's open everything for his exams so it helps to have all the important marked up beforehand. If you happen to do awful on an exam, you more than likely aren't alone but don't slack (seriously, dont), he does give a healthy curve at the end. I've had him twice now, once for numerical methods and fluids, he's not a bad teacher but I feel like he teaches as though you are extremely smart (which you may be idk) and doesn't tend to dumb things down.   Once I get on a computer I'll link to a post awhile back where someone reviewed all the teachers and classes in ME. Good luck!"

Unfortunately, I don't think that it's connected by the tunnels directly to Kennedy anymore. But if you're okay with a longer walk you can still go through Siebert, Paterson and Bradley to get to Kennedy underground.

OSU,3ciq22,wineman3,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:53:04 2015 UTC,"If it were me, I'd swap ochem for the intro CBE course. Here's why:  You state that you don't know about CSE or CBE (been there), and CBE is going to get you a better representation of what the program is like. That being said, CBE 2200 was by far my least favorite CBE class, I've loved all of the other ones. But on principle, I think it'd still be a better way to help you decide.  The other thing to consider is the relative ease of scheduling ochem. In any semester, there will be several sections. It's also available in the summer. Finally, it isn't a prereq for any of the actual chemE classes. ChemE is weird, because you kind of take the CBE classes and chem classes separately. I'm 99% sure none of the CBE classes have any chem classes as pre-reqs. So, if you take o-chem and decide to go into CBE, you'll be a semester ""behind"", where as if you take CBE and decide to go into CBE, you can take ochem whenever you like, even in the summer. Now, I should also mention that being ""behind"" in CBE isn't the end of the world and most people can still graduate on time, but it's something to consider.   Finally, there's course difficulty. My first semester of sophomore year, I took math 2177 (joke), Bio 1113 (a lot of work), Ochem 1 (Sucked), and CBE 2200 (A lot of work). I was also TA-ing for FEH, which took up a ton of time. l ended up with a 2.9 that semester, mostly because I was terrible at ochem. I think cbe 2200 is much easier to understand, although the workload might be similar.   The point is, I think you should swap ochem for cbe 2200. Please feel free to ask me any other questions! Good Luck!"

OSU,3cfb3i,xam2y,2,Tue Jul 7 16:38:36 2015 UTC,"I used Carmen in the late 2000's as a student at the academy here.  I've used blackboard and another in-house program at my undergrad.  The In-house program wasn't too bad, and was very well maintained (i.e. not buggy) but carmen has more features to it.  I personally like carmen over blackboard but that's a personal preference thing.  At the med school, we currently use MedStar and Vitals, both in-house solutions.  They don't even compare to carmen--they're buggy, and it's impossible to get anything done.  We've pushed for them to move back to Carmen (they moved away from it about 2.5 years ago) but they won't budge (probably because they've already spent so much money on these new systems).  Maybe this new carmen will finally allow us to migrate back (or maybe not)."

I like Carmen. I think it's simple and easy to navigate. It didn't take me long to learn at all.   They both have their pros and cons, but oncourse was a superior system with much more put into it. It is probably more confusing because there is a lot more to do and when I was there it went down at least for a couple hours every other week :( That really sucked, but ODEE is much better here.   Otherwise, the interface is MUCH cleaner, submitting assignments (dropbox) is easier, and the discussion page is much better. You don't have to go to student center to see your grades--everything is there. In fact, when I came to OSU it was annoying that teachers didn't update assignment grades at least every week. It would also be easier for profs to post assignments and much easier to download (just click once) and get to them. I can see Carmen getting outdated anyway soon, so although there will probably be bumps, I think this is a good move."
OSU,3cfb3i,toomanyblocks,2,Wed Jul 8 00:56:09 2015 UTC,"The switch to a new application powering CarmenCourses will not solve the issue of instructors not posting grades to the LMS, unless the interface changes make more instructors willing to use the LMS for grades.

Again, I would talk to your adviser, YMMV."
OSU,3cf3ih,DrJPepper,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:53:16 2015 UTC,"I have looked at the list and sociology 3302 does fulfil the ethics requirement. Would you recommend taking this class, and is it reasonable difficulty wise? Thanks again!"

OSU,3cf3ih,southpaw22k,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:55:17 2015 UTC,I will say from experience it may be tough to get a spot in history of rock and roll as a freshman. Everything else doesn't seem to be too bad. You already have credit for English 1110 I'm assuming? I've heard various things about ENGR 2367.
OSU,3cf3ih,Arksaw,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:52:38 2015 UTC,"If you have priority scheduling from honors or scholars, getting into history of rock and wall won't be difficult. I was able to get in no problem my second semester of freshmen year."

OSU,3cf3ih,Arksaw,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:04:24 2015 UTC,"I'm in ENGR 2367 now, Its really easy and just busy work. If you're not completely oblivious to how application letters and resumes go, you'll be fine. Both FEs are much more work than they're assigned in terms of credit-hours. But you have to do it first two semesters anyway, so just tough it out. I will say that if you approach the class with a good attitude, you'll learn a hell of a lot more than just what they teach you. You'll also take away lessons in problem solving. History of Rock n Roll is really fun. A lot of class is listening to music and going through slides about types of music and their origins. The midterms and finals are about 60% listening (you have to give the year, artist, and date that pertains to a song) and 40% fill in/multiple choice things like that. I definitely recommend Professor Corrigan for (I think her first name is Lindsay?) for FE, and Professor Furlong for history of rock n roll."

OSU,3cf3ih,officialshibe,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:18:13 2015 UTC,"What's the course number for calc 3?  And my two pieces of best advice i can give are get to know your professors and if you want/need something you always have to ask.   Knowing all my professors and going to all their office hours at least a couple times has been incredibly beneficial. They understand that you're hardworking and dedicated, which can be taken into account when assigning your final grade. This has happened to me on multiple occasions. Additionally, just knowing them is a benefit in and of itself. When professors like you, they tend to explain things with more depth, or more relevance to what you'll be tested on.  Always ask if you want something. Besides the fact that I got my first two research positions by emailing the department head of my department and another professor, asking at least gives you a chance. I've never been told ""no"" to meet outside office hours, or to ask for a more detailed explanation for what they gave you. Ask for everything, and worst case scenario you are exactly where you started. Even if you ask something like ""Will x be on the midterm,"" there's a decent chance they wont tell you (or give you a general answer), but on the chance they do, you have a leg up."
OSU,3cf3ih,ShreyaSSSSM,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:14:02 2015 UTC,"In terms of balance of course difficulty, you shouldn't have a problem as that's a pretty well balanced courseload.  Since there's been a few different responses about ENGR 2367, allow me to share that my experience was that it was a very easy class. I recommend Angela Burks if you have the option. Also, CSE 1223 is not too bad, even if you have no programming background.  As it has been said, you may have some difficulty getting into a few of those classes as a freshman (i.e. Rock&Roll, Childrens Lit) so keep some backups in mind before you schedule.  ENGR 1181/1182 are only 2 credit hour classes, I believe, but they're about 5 credit hours' worth of effort on your behalf.  In my opinion, those math classes will be the hardest classes on your schedule, but that's just me.  Good luck and welcome to the best University in the world!"
OSU,3cf3ih,xam2y,0,Tue Jul 7 13:52:57 2015 UTC,What backups for children's lit and hist of rock and roll would you recommend?  Also can you recommend some tips for calculus 3 at tosu? It seems to be quite brutal.
OSU,3cf3ih,boomfarmer,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:15:37 2015 UTC,"If the goal of Children's Lit is an easy literature credit, I'll plug Classics 2220 (Classical Mythology) as a super easy class that fulfills the requirement.   As far as Calc 3 goes, just work at it. If you're coming in with credit for Calc 1 and 2, you're fine at math, just realize that college classes will go at a faster pace and expect a little more independence from students. If you struggle early (or even if you don't) consider stopping by the MSLC (the math tutoring center). Most of the tutors there are great and enthusiastic to help."
OSU,3cea7p,EasyLemons,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:08:32 2015 UTC,"I took this class (human bio) last semester and it was super easy. Lots of videos to watch. The only problem is that obviously because the class is online the other quizzes or projects are open notes and you can access the internet at your will. With the final you have a few days to choose from and have to select a time to take the exam at the testing center on campus. Another option was to pay a 25 dollar fee and take it through a 3rd party site if you were not on campus. In my class, you were allowed to take in a page of notes (both sides, hand written) for the final, but it was no where as easy as the other quizzes had been...hope that helps! I had Dr. Smock and she was the bomb.com. Super helpful and I even met with her a few times in person to help me clarify some topics. But overall I would say the class is very easy as most of it has been learned before in high school bio classes"

They are actually instructed not to help with logic or regular computer science questions and are told to refer you to a tutor or ta. Most of them will help you if you have a quick question but they are not supposed to and it became a huge problem last semester with students making no effort to do their homework and becoming extremely rude and demanding of personalized tutoring.

Both ensembles are pretty good, but they have two different styles of music. University band plays fairly easy concert music and the instrumentation can be weird because you just sign up and you're in. If you like sporting events, cheers, school songs and arrangements of pepband music, athletic band is for you. Of the two I've had more fun in althletic band as you have the opportunity to travel with some teams and go on tournament trips. Its a lot of fun. Shameless plug here too, if you are interested in supporting the bands at OSU there are 2 service sororities and 2 fraternities that help the bands and other ensembles. Tau Beta Sigma (of which I am a member) is the co-ed band  service sorority. Most of our members are a part of the athletic and marching bands however there are some in U Band. Kappa Kappa Psi is the co-ed band fraternity. Most of the members are in the marching band, some are in athletic band and I dont know if they have any Uband members. Servicing the School of Music at OSU is the fraternity Phi Mu Alpha and the sorority Sigma Alpha Iota. Admittedly I dont know much about either of those but if you are looking to get more involved in the bands I highly recommend checking them out. I can get you in contact with the recruitment heads of any or all of these organizations if its something you might be interested it. Joining TBSigma was on of the best decisions I made going into college so please consider joining one of these fabulous organizations!"

The Software I class (2221) covers many basic programming concepts, but it also covers a fair bit of OSU Components, which is a framework that is used specifically for the Software series. Also, the tests for the class are especially difficult because they have extremely specific multiple choice questions and complex code-reading segments (nested loops and recursive functions). I also programmed for 4+ years before coming to OSU, and I learned some new things in Software 1 like many different data structures, how to write JUnit tests, and how to use the OSU components. I'm a third year CSE student, was a TA for Software 2 (2231) last semester, and will be a Peer advisor for CSE this coming semester, so feel free to message me if you have any questions about how to prepare for the test or what else is covered in the class!"

For example, if a user enters the values 4 13 8 11 2 66 5 0, then the program should report that the smallest of the positive values entered is 2. Program output should include appropriate user-friendly headings.  if you can do that I think you would be fine, the pre-req classes teach the basic loops, input/output, stuff like that basic intro stuff if you can do that you're fine."

To be guaranteed admission to the CSE major you need a 3.2 CPHR (Cumulative GPA) and at-least a 2.0 in all CSE courses (EPHR) taken, including in the semester you applied.   If you do pass out of software 1, and start with software 2 in the fall  there is a chance you will not do as well as you would like. Taking software 1 would add a safety net for you EPHR.  I am an ISE major so I do not know how difficult the CSE major classes are. Personally I would recommend taking CSE 2221 because you would probably be taking Calc (1151 or 1172) and Physics 1250 which are both time consuming classes along with ENGR 1181. You don't want to burn yourself out during your first semester here.  If you feel like you are ready for software 2 and can handle the stress of college life, by all means take the 2221 test.

My worry is that since these introductory courses are C++/Java based, the more advanced courses will also be C++/Java based. And even though I have a solid understanding of programming, I'm worried that I'll be stuck on more simple things (that the prof will assume I know exactly how to implement in C++/Java) and I won't be able to focus on the more advanced topics that are being taught.  I'm I worrying for no reason?"

I'd utilize your time over the summer and brush up on some Java. www.codingbat.com is a great resource.   You'll find that the problems you run into in these courses usually aren't lapses in syntactical knowledge, but rather how to effectively and efficiently tackle a problem. On the first midterm and on the final they'll test you with some syntax in CSE 2221.   For example with me, I got a 9 or 10 on every project, but did not do as well on the tests, because they are extremely nitpicky. It depends on the professor of course, but sometimes even a full understanding of every topic isn't enough to do as well as you want."

OSU,3c4nws,CricketOrCrickets,2,Sat Jul 4 23:09:50 2015 UTC,"Not a problem, always glad to help.  It's all Java focused, so I would highly recommend brushing up on that. I can't speak for courses after CSE 2231 though, I honestly don't know.   I have no idea why CSE 1223 is not recommended. It's the pre requisite course. Perhaps the reason is that it's significantly more basic than CSE 2221. It's probably geared more towards business majors or people who just want an introduction."
OSU,3c39ni,ravenously_red,6,Sat Jul 4 09:54:18 2015 UTC,"They put in a new bouldering wall about a year or two ago and it seems pretty good. There's a ton of routes to climb and they change them fairly frequently. Plus it's free, so the other gyms can't really beat it."

OSU,3c39ni,theforeku,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:11:19 2015 UTC,$10 but I believe you need to be with a student as well.
OSU,3c39ni,deldrice,3,Sat Jul 4 19:34:40 2015 UTC,"Just go climb there and check it out. No they don't get new holds as often as Vertical Adventures, and the route setting is done by students, but you'll meet other people your age that want to find people to climb with, and there's certainly hard enough stuff for you there unless you're consistently doing V9+ 5.13+."
OSU,3c39ni,novemberhascome2,1 point,Sat Jul 4 15:30:42 2015 UTC,"Believe me, I'll be climbing at all of these locations when I move down there in the fall! :)"
OSU,3c39ni,Darthsanta13,2,Sat Jul 4 19:19:05 2015 UTC,"There's a few different places that are worth checking out.  If you're a student then you get to go to the ARC (climbing gym on campus) for free as a part of tuition so that's a big win.  It's mostly top rope focused.  They have a fair amount of variety in terms of routes which is nice.  They do have some limited bouldering but it's not the greatest.  If you want to lead, it's not so great.  I never bothered but IIRC they only allow you to lead on certain routes and on certain days/times.  There's a free standing outdoor wall downtown, (http://www.metroparks.net/parks-and-trails/scioto-audubon/) it's nothing mind-blowing but it's nice to be able to climb outside every once in a while.  They have a few autos and some bouldering areas, but you need your own gear for any top roping or leading.    Vertical Adventures  (http://www.verticaladventuresohio.com/) just recently opened up their new gym about 15 minutes by car from campus.  I'm a pretty big fan.  They have nice, tall walls with a pretty nice variety of holds and wall angles.  They also cater much better to both lead climbing and bouldering.  Con: it's not free, and it's kinda difficult to get to without a car.  I haven't ever been there, but Kinetic Climbing (http://www.kineticcolumbus.com/gym/gallery/) is a dedicated bouldering gym that opened up fairly recently.  I don't really know much more about it than that.  Hope this helps!"
OSU,3c39ni,teptepley1,1 point,Sat Jul 4 16:05:14 2015 UTC,Thank you for the awesome reply! I didn't know there was even an outdoor location downtown.
OSU,3c39ni,sxeQ,2,Sat Jul 4 19:23:15 2015 UTC,"I go to all 3 regularly. For bouldering, kinetic is BY FAR the best in my opinion. I am a student and I don't even go to the ARC anymore. Always a million people there so its just hard to get on a route and as others have said the setting is hit or miss and very congested. Their ropes are pretty good tho. I really only go to vertical adventures to hit the ropes. I'm not a huge fan of their bouldering but it is definitely better than the ARC."
OSU,3c39ni,deldrice,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:16:46 2015 UTC,"I'm primarily interested in bouldering, so thanks for the advice. It seems that people disagree here on what's the best, but at least I know it's a non-campus location now. I live in a climbing dead-Zone atm so it's going to be awesome having all these options!"
OSU,3c39ni,kelly495,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:21:41 2015 UTC,"The OAC bouldering isn't really worth it. The routes are really complicated and unclear, it's only like 10-12 feet tall, and it doesn't change much."
OSU,3c39ni,deldrice,1 point,Sat Jul 4 16:12:18 2015 UTC,"Pretty much everyone else has covered what Columbus has to offer. If you are primarily a boulderer, vertical adventures will be the best by far. Pretty good turnaround on problems and the setting is top notch. Most expensive option though.   Kinetic is a bit cheaper, and offers bouldering only. They advertise having new problems daily but there's some been some drama with the setters and owner so I'm not sure how well that statement has held up. Either way its always been a fun time climbing there.  As for OSU the bouldering is alright at times. Limited space and variable ability of the setters is the difficulty here. During the school year the aim is to have the bouldering wall reset every month. If you are a student it is definitely worth checking out.   Free =  Sciota Audobon & the OAC at OSU(assuming you are a student) $$ = Kinetic $$$ = vertical adventures"
OSU,3c1xzp,ReginaldThatchery,3,Sat Jul 4 00:31:03 2015 UTC,"It is much easier to get a co-op (more than 1 rotation, could occur during the school year) than an internship (one-off job, usually during the summer). I had offers for co-ops for engineering, but I had decided that I didn't want to switch off quarters and semesters of work and school for a company that I wasn't sure about (EDIT: because I didn't know what I wanted, and I didn't want to wait too long between classes. It wouldn't have been hard scheduling wise, It was just a personal decision that I didn't want to do it, I did however intern and because it wasn't a restricted program, I got to intern at a super small company working in a field that I thought I wanted to work in). I have had many friends co-op throughout their time at OSU as well and many of them turned into full-time positions.  Basically, pick the school that you want to attend based on factors other than co-op availability/requirements. If you want to co-op, or intern, there are plenty of resources to get opportunities for that at OSU (career fairs, career services resources, student org professional development, professors in fields that you're interested in etc). I never looked at UC, so I don't have any comparable info, sorry!"
OSU,3c1xzp,actingnerdy,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:59:32 2015 UTC,"That's good to hear, thank you! I think I'll decide on OSU if I end up going to a school in Ohio."
OSU,3c1xzp,steve_jahbs,3,Mon Jul 6 00:13:54 2015 UTC,"Unless it's your Capstone, I wouldn't rely on class projects to fill out your resume. They don't look bad, but everyone does them so they don't really set you apart from other applicants. Co-op/internship experience is what sets you apart and allows you to show how you can apply your classroom knowledge.   As far as difficulty goes, it is like getting a job. You are going to have to put in a lot of work. If you don't do it now, you're going to have to after you graduate. Might as well put in the work now and make it easier to get a full time position.  I don't know who told you that there are fewer opportunities at OSU. It is the biggest college in the state and many companies recruit there first before going to other colleges. OSU also has an entire career services just for engineers to help connect them with companies like GE, Boeing, Ford, GM, and Chrysler, to name a few. I personally know people who recruit at OSU for some of these companies and OSU is a top priority for them."
OSU,3c1xzp,tbonejr,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:46:42 2015 UTC,"Thank you! It's not that I don't want to work, I just wanted to know if there was a chance I just wouldn't be able to get hired for a co-op. Thank you for your advice, though!   It was a teacher of mine who led me to believe that OSU wasn't very good for co-ops. I think her reasoning was based on UC requiring them and ""being ingrained in everything they do."" When I began to find data that contradicted what she told me, I wanted to ask people about their personal experiences."
OSU,3c1xzp,tbonejr,2,Mon Jul 6 00:11:46 2015 UTC,"If you put a little effort into getting a co-op and have decent grades it won't be that hard to get a co-op or internship. The important thing is to attend the career fairs and take advantage of Engineering Career services. Don't be afraid to start freshmen year you will be surprised how many companies are willing to take on students just after Freshmen year.  As for whether of not University of Cincinnati is a better choice, that is dependent on your program of study. The only advice I can offer in this regards is anecdotal. OSU is definitely more widely known and the name alone draws many companies to campus. Most of the people in my graduating class had at least one internship or co-op and most people I knew had several job offers before graduation.  I considered the Unvieristy of Cincinnati when I was looking at colleges in the end I decided on OSU, mainly since their ECE program was better but also I thought that since OSU was such a large school there would be a lot more opportunities of things to do around campus. I definitely do not regret my decision. Let me know if you have any more specific questions."
OSU,3c1xzp,So1idoSnake,1 point,Sat Jul 4 04:10:45 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the advice. ECE is actually what I want to major in.  How were the classes as an ECE major, overall? Especially the more specialized ones you took as an upperclassman. Are the professors generally helpful? How are the class sizes? What made you decide on and stick with ECE? How did you choose a specialty? Do you think that OSU adequately prepared you for work?   Sorry if I asked too many questions lol"
OSU,3c1332,isaadr,13,Fri Jul 3 20:10:55 2015 UTC,"If WOW! is available, it's your best choice. If not, it's a toss-up between U-verse and Time Warner.  But seriously, look at the packages and prices. WOW! is also the only provider with a 110Mbps package, and its only $60/mo. So more than twice the performance for the same price as the others. ESPECIALLY if you have that many roommates, you'll be sorry for getting anything else once you all try to watch Netflix at the same time.  EDIT: I have had all three providers, in different locations. I've only had a WOW outage twice in the last year. For people complaining of frequent outages, I think there's something weird with the firmware on some of WOW's modems that affect WiFi connectivity for iOS devices.

Students can retake any course (that they've received any grade) from anytime at the university 3 times. It's different from the old rule of retaking a course that you took before earning 30 hours and taking it again before earning 60 hours.  The new forgiveness rule (from my understanding) does affect the entire university. However, I'm not as familiar with Engineering rules as they have different accreditation standards I'm not completely aware of.   I'd still recommend seeing an advisor asap to inquire. This rule is very new, so perhaps the advisor didn't know that before and thought you were mentioning the old freshman forgiveness rule.   Good luck to you!"

Everything else is shit to me, I used to be pre-med, but realized it was shit, every major is shit except this, yes you will spend another semester, but you will graduate with something you love which is worth 10x more than that extra semester spent.

OSU,3bw5en,gradlifeOH,2,Thu Jul 2 17:18:54 2015 UTC,"Yes, I lost my funding at the end of my 3rd year. Or, rather, my department took on too many students for several years in a row and my advisor and other professors were unable to acquire enough grant money to support everyone. There are also not enough TA slots to support post-candidacy students who are not on RA because they have promised TA support to the 1st and 2nd year students. My advisor let 3 of the 6 grad students go in my lab. I was told literally 3 days before I began my candidacy examination, so I took the exam and then a week after I passed I told them I was leaving the program with a Master's degree. The other two guys in my lab had success finding a new lab, but I wasn't able to find a new advisor with enough resources to fund me so I had no other viable option than to leave.  I'm pretty pissed about the whole situation in general, but in hindsight the writing was on the wall a year before all this went down, so when it finally did happen I wasn't all that surprised. I had seriously considered quitting when I first realized the problem but for whatever reason I decided to try to compete with my classmates for one of the few funded spots.  At the time I quit my plan was to move out of state and get a job as a data analyst or something, but out of the blue my advisor introduced me to a contact he had at another institute, and that guy offered me a PhD position almost on the spot. I accepted it and now I'm going to be doing my PhD at a much better school. So I guess it all worked out to my benefit in the end."
OSU,3bw5en,cosmic_magnet,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:48:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I feel you. My department did the same shit with pulling in too many grad students years ago. Now the department is all feeling this remorse and are using every excuse possible to defund anyone in their handbook: Grad students with the poorest student instructor evaluations were cut or students who were below the GPA. If any were to dispute it, they lawyered up.  The irony is lost on them when they spent thousands renovating the offices with new and expensive furniture."

You're eligible for a maximum of 2 years. Problem is, having an internship and a high GPA don't guarantee a waiver, and more people meet the requirements than there are number of waivers. So you could have your funding pulled your second year.  On the flip side, every PhD student in CRP is funded."

Most positions, to my knowledge, get posted online at recsports.osu.edu, or the Buckeye Career Network website.

Paying attention in class is really important, but isn't too difficult because he made it easy, and he has a voice like silk. For the midterms, he releases practice midterms like a week before on Carmen. They are usually very close to the actual midterms, and if you genuinely understand the concepts behind the midterms you will do great.

OSU,3bxd1n,samdog92,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:39:53 2015 UTC,The only thing difficult about the midterms is getting them done in the time allotted. They are not difficult at all but are designed so that you will only get it done if you work nonstop for the allotted time.

OSU,3bmbd1,thegoat_,2,Tue Jun 30 11:08:48 2015 UTC,Honestly if you did fine in AP chem this is more a review....at least that's what it felt like to me until the last like 3 chapters which suddenly caught up to me and most questions on the final were obviously from them.   Do the readings and the hw and you'll be fine. Or just drop the ethics gen ed if you're really worried.  And honestly I'd recommend dropping the ethics course because even though it's prob really easy it might be a pain in the butt some nights when you really need to study or sleep.   You will be at a disadvantage with labs because while most ppl know what to expect in terms of grading (though grading can vary on how the TA feels like) of the reports. Some are harsh and you might find it take you several weeks to get a hang on it.  The labs are trickier and wayyy longer than in 1210. And the reports longer I feel espec depending on the TA. I recommend not waiting so long to do them...like start the next day with figuring calculations out and just work on it daily. The reports and the prelabs can be a bit time Consuming in 1220./  EDIT: Honestly...here's the thing. if you know your equations and have them memorized which can happen by doing problems so many times an I had mine memorized even from AP when I took it junior year most questions are really just plugging numbers in. Know your units and use dimensional analysis. that's how I figured out answers if I had issues with the equations. For me all equations were given but I never used the page at all. Other professors won't give you an equation sheet. I  missed like 2 questions on the 1st midterm and 1 question on the 2nd midterm an dI think 3rd midterm. Mostly because the math was seriously plugging and chugging. you just had to know which equations to use where

OSU,3bin3b,3sips,11,Mon Jun 29 15:15:21 2015 UTC,It's nearly impossible unless extreme circumstances like inappropriate behavior or touching etc. it's too late in the term to do this it's been like 6 weeks or so so far? You're almost done with the summer term so just put up with it. If you feel like you can't talk to your advisor she/he might be able to help you
OSU,3bin3b,thelonelyward3,4,Mon Jun 29 16:11:07 2015 UTC,"I'd rather not put up with him because he has made it pretty clear that he doesn't like me and I believe that this could possibly lead to him giving me lower grades. I don't want to say that he's out to get me, but I definitely feel that he will not make an effort to help me.   I have been at The Ohio State for quite some time now and I have never had a teaching assistant that makes me so irate. He makes me feel like I am beneath him and treats me like a child.   Edit: words"
OSU,3bin3b,thelonelyward3,4,Mon Jun 29 16:36:01 2015 UTC,Do you mind telling me what happened if not I understand talk to your advisor and tell them and yes if he doesn't like you he will grade much harder. I would strongly advise you to talk to your advisor and tell he/she every detail. If this is as serious as you're making it seem it's not worth losing a grade over
OSU,3bin3b,thelonelyward3,4,Mon Jun 29 16:39:30 2015 UTC,"I sure can.      He told me that he couldn't give the full points for the writing of my procedure because it was too messy. While my handwriting is messy, it is definitely legible and could be followed. I had multiple people read what I had written and they confirmed my ideas.    Last week, I ran into the lab, 10 minutes early, to grab cleaning supplies for my googles because I had walked in the ran and they were extremely cloudy. I grab the supplies and I start to head out into the hallway, when he stops me and asks why I'm not wearing the goggles. I explain that they are extremely dirty, I didn't see any cleaning supplies outside the lab, that's why I came into the lab, and that I was leaving the lab to clean them before class. He then said that goggles need to be worn at all times. I replied I know and that it would've been dangerous for me to put them on in the lab because they were groggy with water streaks. When he came around to check our procedures, he chastised me for boiling water before the video had ended. Then he said to me, ""I am also going to have to take 10 points from your grade because you weren't wearing your goggles. I was going to be a good guy and let it slide, but you gave me an attitude.""      The other thing that bothers me is that, from my perspective, he only seems to be disciplining me. An example of this would be that there are a group of guys that measure all of their chemicals, that are used when mixing things together, at the chemical station. Additionally, they're using their own pipets to withdraw these chemicals. From my previous chemistry classes, I know that this a big no-no because it could contaminate the chemicals and fuck up your experiment. You're supposed to get a beaker or test tube, pour some of the chemicals in it, and then take it back to your station to continue the experiment. While I have not told the TA what I have witnessed on multiple occasions, he's talking to these guys while they're doing it.      Recently I've noticed that he disrupts me when I am measuring items and he somehow manages to get in my way when I am carrying my experiments. This behavior is new and it makes me feel extremely paranoid.      Edit:  I'm sitting in the chemistry help center right now and he's here trash-talking with another TA about how poorly the lab reports were. I can't help but think that he is a giant douche."
OSU,3bin3b,thelonelyward3,10,Mon Jun 29 17:13:34 2015 UTC,"The hand writing thing seems weird to me as well but it's completely up to perspective if other people could read it then it's obviously something on him. Now what gets me is the goggles thing I've never seen anyone get points taken off for not wearing goggles that's outright insane to take off 10 points for a minor thing. The boiling of the water during the video is on you, you cannot do that in the middle of a video it distracts other students and you. It's just not appropriate to do that. It does seem odd but the only troubling instance is the 10 points thing everything else is pretty minor. ask your advisor their judgement is better than mine"
OSU,3bin3b,DoctorVeggie,3,Mon Jun 29 17:20:46 2015 UTC,"The boiling of the water did not seem so strange to me because I had set everything up before the video had started. In past classes, many of the students set up their water baths, before the videos, and were allowed to keep them running so that it would save on time. One of my previous TAs actually recommended doing this."
OSU,3bin3b,DoctorVeggie,7,Mon Jun 29 17:29:25 2015 UTC,"I've never seen anyone do that, if your previous TA's said it was okay I would explain that to your advisor, and maybe talk to your TA."
OSU,3bin3b,DoctorVeggie,5,Mon Jun 29 18:20:40 2015 UTC,"Yes, this. TAs are taught, explicitely, not to allow that. Its a safety issue."
OSU,3bin3b,Featherfy,6,Mon Jun 29 20:35:10 2015 UTC,All of those things are either up to his discretion OR something he could get in trouble for not enforcing.   Youre just gonna have to deal with the TA.   Source: I TAd this class for a year.
OSU,3bin3b,lagoutking,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:34:05 2015 UTC,True but he's not enforcing it with anyone else so I feel that this needs to be brought to someone's attention

OSU,3bin3b,xam2y,4,Tue Jun 30 02:53:40 2015 UTC,if you went into that lab to clean your goggles when the TA wasn't in there that's a HUGEEEE NO NO. IF you were caught in there without a TA your TA would get in an enormous amount of trouble and would probably lose his job; no one is allowed in the room until the TA is there. Surprised he didn't chastise you about that instead of wearing your goggles.
OSU,3bin3b,xam2y,3,Mon Jun 29 18:28:20 2015 UTC,Nope he was definitely in the room.
OSU,3bin3b,DoctorVeggie,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:34:58 2015 UTC,"If hes complaining about your handwriting for a mock official document you can always use a computer to write the whole thing (including the report sheets). Not having your googles off in the lab is a big no regardless of the reason. They used to be far more lax about this however from what I remember safety inspectors docked them pretty badly for this. If they catch students without googles they can get the TA fired; and the school will be fined around $5000 (this is what my TA told us when I had completed 1210). So wear your googles; its not a difficult rule to follow. The videos are safety procedures; by boiling water you're distracting yourself and others from gathering the necessary safety information to do the experiment safely. My TA had rules, you can collect all necessary materials (beakers, chemicals, burner, etc. you cannot start the actual experiment before the video). They told you the rules and you broke them, don't take it as if hes out to get you. Frankly, it seems that his decision to take points for attitude seems warranted after reading your post."
OSU,3bin3b,airborne_dildo,4,Tue Jun 30 05:49:07 2015 UTC,"If the TA is not the instructor of record, contact the Lecturer and let them know your grievances.   Edit: if you are registered in a large lecture and your TA is only one of several for labs, then ask your lecturer if you can switch TAs."
OSU,3bin3b,DoctorVeggie,2,Mon Jun 29 21:42:45 2015 UTC,"I'm meeting with my lecturer tomorrow so we will see what happens. If a TA switch is not an option, I think that I'm going to ask what would be the best way to have a conversation with him."
OSU,3bin3b,kairoschris,4,Mon Jun 29 23:13:14 2015 UTC,"When you meet with the lecturer, be as calm and composed as possible. Do not say that you are worried about your grade (this is implied) because the lecturer may assume that you only want to switch to get a higher grade. Instead, outline the things you mentioned above and say you feel ostracized and discriminated against for an unknown reason. This puts you in an uncomfortable position and you would like to be in an environment that compels you to succeed rather than stress you out."

OSU,3bin3b,mel1ssah,3,Tue Jun 30 02:54:46 2015 UTC,"1210 lab TA here. The grass is not always greener with another TA. The TA you are leaving could tell your new TA to be extra hard on you to make you regret switching. After a week or two, Zellmer will stop entertaining requests to switch, no matter how much you piss and moan.  As for your lecturer, he/she is totally out of the loop when it comes to anything related to labs. They only control recitations. You need to talk to Zellmer about labs and boy will that ""talk"" suck.  Pros: you maybe get a new TA. Cons: unleash the wrath of Zellmer and maybe get a worse TA.  Bonus note on ""unfair grading"": if your friend in another class has a 1210 TA who grades easier than your TA, your friend's TA is probably the one in the wrong, not your TA. It is your friend's TA who is messing up the curve for everyone else"
OSU,3bin3b,DoctorVeggie,1 point,Tue Jun 30 11:56:12 2015 UTC,"Now I don't have any hope with getting a different TA so I'm hoping that my lecturer can offer me advice on how to approach a conversation with him.

OSU,3biv56,Featherfy,3,Mon Jun 29 16:17:13 2015 UTC,"Hey OP, don't forget that micro4100 also has a lab component. It takes a considerable amount of time, particularly the lab writeups. You also have separate exams for the lab. Otherwise, there are overarching topics (e.g metabolism) shared between biochem but in general, there is quite a lot of material for both classes. Micro4120 is said to be one of the more difficult parts in the major. I would say take your time if you're in no particular rush. 4110 is pretty enjoyable and really interesting (the pathogenicity/immuno course).  Hopefully that helps."
OSU,3biv56,CallMeRydberg,2,Mon Jun 29 17:32:05 2015 UTC,thank you so much that really helps!
OSU,3biv56,Ky_Wolf,2,Mon Jun 29 18:23:36 2015 UTC,"Taking all three of the courses at the same time will definitely be a lot of work, but doable if you would really like to get them out of the way. I agree with the other poster in that 4100 lab is a lot of separate work and will take up a good chunk of your time. I took 4100 along with Chem 2520 and a couple GE's and felt that was a pretty decent work load, so I think 4100 and 4511 together will be plenty demanding on their own. I would say just take those two and then some GE's if at all possible perhaps? If 4120 is all that works for you, by all means take it, but you'll really have your work cut out for you with those three classes. You can certainly manage it though; just be prepared! Hope this helps!"

Bio 1113/1114 are jokes, more so 1114 than 1113. And physics 1 is all motion and kinetics and very easy to visualize compared to the theoretical/magnetic stuff that makes physics 2 tough.   You literally will have a full time staff of chemistry and physics tutors at your disposal here, if you know when to ask for help killing those classes even as a first or second sem student won't be hard at all!"
OSU,3b7nw1,Leflammeblanc,5,Fri Jun 26 19:46:46 2015 UTC,"Uh, I wouldn't take this guys advice to heart... Gen chem IS hard, like all the other pre reqs. They're doable, yes, but they aren't easy A's like he's making it seem like. I think you can handle it if you are ready to put in the work. Why are you taking anatomy your first semester? It's not on the MCAT. I think you should drop anatomy and take it after you take the MCAT, anatomy requires a lot of time."
OSU,3b7nw1,Leflammeblanc,2,Mon Jun 29 06:19:01 2015 UTC,"I mean it seems like you just reiterated exactly what I said... They're not easy A's, but anyone who wants to be setting them self up to get into med school better be putting the work in (read the part about having a bunch of full time tutors at your disposal... Why would I say that if I'm implying it's an easy A?) and getting an A in gen chem. If you can't even do that, you're not setting good habits for when you actually have to take harder classes such as o chem, upper level biochem, calc 2/3, p chem etc depending on major. Not to mention the ridiculous standards that top 50 med schools (>3.6) average. If you aren't pulling A's in your prereq chem class how are you going to expect to improve for the classes that they're actually prereqs for?   I do agree with anatomy, it's a prerequisite for med schools but not the mcat. Take that your senior year"

I've started going through lessons on Fus' website for Chem to prepare myself for first semester. Most of it is review of AP Chem so far."

OSU,3b7nw1,xam2y,2,Fri Jun 26 20:17:31 2015 UTC,"having 3 labs a week, lab reports, and quizzes every week will be rough. and honestly most science advisors won't let you do 3 lab courses in a semester. this was very true in my major, and two of my friends who were bio majors.  i would recommend against it, and i don't see why people would recommend it, or say it wouldn't be too hard. it's definitely rough. chemistry department is very rough as it is, it's not the class itself but the lack of real help you get from professors in lecture as well as your lab instructor probably just not speaking good enough english or helping out enough before quizzes or for homework.  physics, if you get barrett... god help your soul. biology i've heard isn't too bad, but i took anthro for my bio science so i'm not sure. it depends on if it's intro bio, or if it's bio for bio majors i would assume. i know the labs are long, tedious, and they require lots of checks by the instructors through every part/section. if you're looking for tutoring... do not. i repeat. do NOT go to the physics or chem tutor rooms. they're dreadful, they walk around doing like 1-2 questions at a time and they don't even really sit with you and help you. if you need tutoring, get it from the students in morrill or some dorm somewhere like that (i know morrill had it cause i lived there, i never paid attention to other dorms tutoring when i lived in them) hope this helps. i would say 2 would be pushing it, just my opinion. 3 is... if you succeed, i commend you. i wouldn't be able to do it myself. chemistry + a hard writing class + a long lecture + diff eq for me one semester was enough for me to almost throw in the towel when i was in undergrad."
OSU,3b7nw1,xam2y,1 point,Sun Jun 28 04:46:22 2015 UTC,"heh AP is not that comparable to college. It will help you maybe, but it is much crazier. The courses do definitely help though because you've already seen most of the material so it is a bit easier.   remember gotta put in those ochem labs in there, 2 credit hours each just a reminder they're separate.   i feel like your second semester is what a lot of students in your position do. it's not uncommon to see those courses. idk which anatomy you're taking as there are like 4 options, but your first semester may, if anything, be a bit rough as your first semester of college just a heads up."

EDIT: And I probably won't start any ECs other than maybe joining the pre-med club in my first semester so I have a little more free time to get situated."
OSU,3b7nw1,mathafrica,3,Fri Jun 26 17:51:29 2015 UTC,"There is an ANAT2300 and 3300. If you prefer to have a bit more in-depth knowledge on anatomy and cadaver identification, I would recommend 3300. If you have previous experience in anatomy, 3300 would be an excellent grade buffer (5 credits) if you get an A. Ultimately your grade will be completely dependent on how well you think you know the material; easy for some, difficult for others, just depends on how you learn.  Coursework is roughly the same with the exception that 3300 has a practical component and 2300 does not. (so, 4 exams + 4 practicals vs only 4 exams). Both are multiple choice exams and the majority of your grade is based on them. There is an online quiz component that you can continue to retake which will add to those points; it isn't really something to worry about and you should consider it ""free points."" In both courses, don't beg if you're on the border between grades, no one will budge; however, you shouldn't be on the border if you've studied effectively. Again, I would recommend 3300 if you have previous experience/know-how. This would make you a better candidate for ANAT5300, a Pass/Fail dissection course with a ""fresh"" cadaver where you will actually be using tools to dissect/prepare during the summer. They only pick about 40 students.  If you have any other questions, feel free to ask :)"
OSU,3b7nw1,mathafrica,0,Fri Jun 26 18:57:05 2015 UTC,"Those intro classes are only ""difficult"" because naive freshmen go into them thinking they will be as easy as high school classes. When they are proven wrong, they start bitching about how hard it is. If you did well in your AP classes and took them seriously, Gen Chem, Intro Bio, and Physics should mostly be review.  As a sophomore who took the MCAT, I can tell you that stacking all of your prereqs is a good idea if you know you can seriously handle these classes. That means staying on top of homework, studying, class notes, etc. Just remember to take the classes seriously, at least for the first exam. If you find that you over-studied for the first exam, then by all means adjust. But don't go into the class thinking it will be a breeze. If you put the effort in now, your MCAT will go smoothly and you won't have to worry about it come Junior year. That leaves Junior year wide open for things like research, volunteering, and essays, giving you a significant advantage over other applicants. Just remember, you need to weigh the risks and objectively appraise your ability to learn before you go down this path.  Also, as a neuroscience student, I can't help but to shamelessly advertise the major. Consider taking classes such as Neuro 3000, Neuro 3313, and Neuro 3513. They seriously helped me on the MCAT."

The fact that he even used a phrase like ""practicing with the wide receivers"" made me think it was more accurate. In addition to the fact that he most likely wouldn't have even asked about the QB controversy on his own so it would be less likely in my opinion that the player's comments were a joking reply to a common question.

Miller's shoulder won't be depended on for a QB job if he wants to go to the NFL, and a good amount of his legendary playmaking ability came from his scrambling and running skills, which would translate very well to catching short throws and weaving through a defense.  If Cardale earns the spot over JT, it'll give him a year to truly prove himself and head to the NFL next season, with an even more talented Barrett still having TWO years of eligibility. Imagine the offensive threat of Cardale's improved arm, Elliot's running game, and the receiving ability of Jalin Marshall, Michael Thomas, and Braxton Miller all on the field at once.

The pacing of the course was weird, like it started really slow (we seriously spent 2-3 weeks on the properties of water through buffers). Each exam covered more and more material.  Exam 2 wasn't hard material but it was a lot of topics, and exam 3 (the final) was ALL pathways.  It's really not hard in concept, it's just that it's a huge amount of material and not enough time (especially for pathways).  I honestly studied every couple of days to every day.  Kudryashov liked to pull questions from recitation quizzes and worksheets, and when sample exams were provided, he sometimes took from those as well.  Not sure about the other professors.  I ended up with an A in the course.  I got As on all my exams, Bs on most weekend quizzes, and As in recitation quizzes (which were like participation points -- free as long as you were keeping up with the material).  It was still sorta close though considering how well I did on exams and recitations.  My end grade was like a 94%.  He curved, too, but it was more generous for lower scores, like and A was only as low as 92% but a B went as low as like a 77%."

You could always look at the coursework and the syllabus from a friend who is enrolled in the class, and if you want, drop in for a few lectures to get a feel for it, but I personally wouldn't take the course if I were you. Take a minor that would make you a more interesting applicant for med school instead (I don't remember where I read it, but some med schools are looking at people who are more well rounded/ well-versed in humanities because they make better doctors). Or spend the extra time that you'll have (which is pretty significant because they are all lab classes) and get involved in research or study for the MCAT or something. Seriously.  I don't know your academic background, so maybe college courses might be a big change for you (I went to an awesome high school, so it wasn't too bad for me), but there are 'study skills' classes that you can take at Younkin Success Center, or ask an academic advisor for more guidance.

I applied three times and because I derped for various reasons (mostly being broke as hell...), I was turned down each time. you MUST have an ohio license which they told me wasn't an issue when moving back from new york, you have to make more money than you spend (no borrowing from parents etc), you have to have lived entirely in ohio for a full year (they're even lame about visiting places so be sure to take out cash ahead of time or just not use a card out of state), and there are a lot of other restrictions. meet with someone in financial aid as soon as you can and talk with them before you start the process. love the school to death but really hate that 160K I owe due to nonsense like this. Good luck with your process!"
OSU,3azklm,jimmygatz,4,Wed Jun 24 21:18:25 2015 UTC,"I have, and they were pretty strict."
OSU,3azklm,squizztits,3,Wed Jun 24 20:04:08 2015 UTC,"Yes. They were pretty strict.   For documents: http://registrar.osu.edu/Residency/guidelines.asp  Did you go to high school in Ohio? I think there is some sort of Forever Buckeye program if not. Otherwise...  If you are independent and from out of state (my situation), I had to prove that I had enough money to cover my past year in Ohio. That is show bank books of money that I earned in Ohio, Ohio paystubs, utility bills, lease, voter's registration. I registered to vote as SOON as I moved to Ohio as well as opened up two bank accounts (checking and savings). I didn't even bother showing my cell phone bill because I am still on my mom's and it would have complicated things. Since I was on fellowship and my tuition was waived, it wasn't a big deal since I was essentially just paying for food, utilities and rent.  My roommate on the other hand, was out of state as well but only had a 25% GTA appointment and was denied residency because there was no way without out-of-state financial support that she was paying for OSU. Even though it was with her money - because she had earned that money out of state, it wasn't worth anything for residency.  I know for a fact that I personally submitted (1.5 years after I lived here, btw):   Copy of driver's license (OH) Copy of voter's registration Copies of bank account statements for the past year (all of my accounts, not just Ohio-based ones) Lease Utility bill in my name Credit card statements in the past year"
OSU,3azklm,yayosu,3,Wed Jun 24 23:48:01 2015 UTC,"They are strict, but if you follow their rules you should be fine. There are a few big mistakes I have heard of. One, being on a parents credit card and being unable to prove who is making the payments, it is best just to come off. Two, being outside of the state for more than 30 days, you can get around it by not using credit cards and such outside of the state and just working in cash. Three, by having a plane ticket bought for you, skip Christmas at home or pay for it your self. Fourth, having a lot of credit card debt, which shows being unable to cover your costs.  You don't have to come off your parent's insurance or phone plan but you do have to pay for those expenses, which can be you writing your parents a check and them handing you the cash back under the table.   Track your expenses and receipts as you go so you don't have to do them all in the last month.   Also if you start tracking in say, August you can apply and be approved in June of the next year, and then all the requirements go away."
OSU,3azklm,maximumpowerandspeed,1 point,Thu Jun 25 00:13:59 2015 UTC,"What in the world did you go through? They never looked at when I was out of the state, my parents credit card that I'm on, or if my parents bought plane tickets for me.   Sounds like you had to justify your entire life to them. This wasn't my experience. Are you still on your parent's taxes?"
OSU,3azklm,SoDel302,1 point,Thu Jun 25 01:21:22 2015 UTC,"Are you saying they tracked your parents' credit cards as well (in the case of the plane ticket situation)?

(I was also planning on having my parents pay for my flights home, and only paying in cash while I visited home so they wouldn't be able to prove that I left the state.)"
OSU,3azklm,colormemindy,1 point,Thu Jun 25 02:47:12 2015 UTC,"They do not track parent's cards. One student a few years back was on a joint credit card with his parents and using it to pay for his expenses. Then when it came time for him to apply he couldnt prove he was paying the card off.   The plane ticket comes from an orientation meeting where the leader of the session offered it as advice, my hunch is it is just too expensive of a ""gift"""

OSU,3aw6ld,Meaninglessnme,3,Wed Jun 24 14:05:44 2015 UTC,"I am not a recent student at OSU, but I have observed what has been happening at other schools. For example, I had a professor for every class I took at Ohio State, with the exception of recitation and labs. At many (most?) colleges today, classes are presented by grad students. With all good students, the quality of instruction isn't (may not be) as critical. The worst example of this is Harvard, where making the cut (selectivity) as just about as valuable as graduating. So the label ""Harvard dropout"" is almost a  valuable as ""Harvard grad.""  As far as selectivity, how is this serving the people of Ohio when many (most) potential students are excluded? Most state-funded universities have effectively dropped the mission to provide the opportunity of secondary education to their citizens."

I actually really enjoyed working as a cashier for one of the food options because I strategically picked a location with better food (for my free meal per shift), and worked non-shitty hours... although those damn blocks killed my shoulder (eff you people with inconsistently swiping cards, and who use 15 blocks at a time... yes unless they changed something in the POS system, you have to swipe that damn card 15 times, or type it in... as the line just continues to grow).   Besides blogging (which I never did too consistently anyways and I was paid in gift cards per post) I didn't hold onto any of these jobs for too long (most was 2 quarters). I was never fired, but I didn't have the time in my schedule to work in the machine shop anymore, and after receiving grants for my research I quit the food services job too.  There are lots of jobs, it just depends what your schedule is like and what you want to do/where you know people.

The interstate coverage is getting better for 70 and 71, but you're mostly in extended coverage once you're off the beaten path.  TL;DR I'm happy 95% of the time.

I would start looking about halfway through the fall semester although you can always start earlier. I personally didn't get QUIC certified but I would recommend doing so because it opens up more opportunities. I would also sell your military service because that sets you apart from other candidates. The most important thing to do in my opinion is to get on fisher connect and look for openings. Apply for them and start interviewing early.
OSU,3aruyg,xFactor01,2,Tue Jun 23 00:43:11 2015 UTC,"Graduated 2013, specialization logistics.  Have a job. My recommendation: Get QUIC certified immediately. Join a business fraternity or organization, also immediately. Get an officer position in this extracurricular as quickly as possible. Get above 3.2 GPA. Mark all career fairs on calendar, go to all of them.  Network with everyone.  Also, have someone proof read your resume."
OSU,3aruyg,1nkblot,1 point,Tue Jun 23 01:19:42 2015 UTC,I stand to graduate in 2018; just got accepted to Fisher.  Do all of these recommendations still apply this early in the game?

OSU,3aruyg,vwpassatdodge,2,Sat Jul 4 19:36:40 2015 UTC,"Hello, the early you start the better.  For example, if you join an extracurricular now by the time elections come around you will have built credibility within the organization to get an officer position.  I do recommend going to career fairs early.  It’s good to get acclimated to them.  Most companies will tell you they are looking for “more experienced applicants”, but they do offer internships there and you will be less nervous the more times you go.  Also approach companies you are not interested in first, I have found it’s a good way to get out the jitters before you talk to the companies you are actually interested in.  I hope this helps and let me know if you have any other questions."

OSU,3anz7q,finnants,9,Mon Jun 22 02:02:28 2015 UTC,"Cazuela's is the best on campus. Their salsa is one of my favorites in Columbus. The hours are great 4 a.m. or later).  Cuco's, Los Guachos or Charritos in NW Columbus. (Yabos and Hass  are also decent.)  Columbus has a great taco truck scene. They tend to be where the Hispanic population resides, which is concentrated around:   Northland (NE Columbus around Morse, Cleveland, 161 and Westerville Rds. Westside (head west on Broad and you'll see them - Hilltop all the way out to HillIard.) Eastside (to a lesser extent) a few in king Lincoln, more in Whitehall, Reynoldsburg, so on.    Some of the Mexican groceries have legit restaurants. La Michoacána on 161 or Morse is one. There is a decent one out West near the casino too. Name escapes me.   Others mentioned Junior's. It is good. The owner is a classically trained French chef who quit working restaurants to run his taco truck. It's one of the only ones you'll find that has fish tacos. But it caters more to yuppie whites than Hispanics if that matters to you.   The tour company someone referred to is Columbus Food Adventures. They do taco trucks, diners and lots of other specialty tours. They are NOT cheap.   Best of luck and enjoy."
OSU,3anz7q,cocksparrow,1 point,Mon Jun 22 07:06:07 2015 UTC,"True, Columbus Food Adventures is in general kind of expensive, but isn't bad when you're buying it from Dtix (if they still even offer it there... I remember purchasing it for around $15-20).   I've only been on their heavily discounted taco truck tour, but you're paying for the expertise of your guide (+a map all of the area taco trucks so you can find them again), the ride in their van, and the food itself. It was definitely a fun time (worth the Dtix price), and the food was great!"

This is mostly designed as a course for non-theatre majors to be an intro to theatre.   You read a few plays, learn a bit about the history of theatre, learn about comedy, and discuss/write about live theatre (you are required to see the department's shows).

We chose to do the budget plan for gas so we could pay the same amount every month, which was about $50/month when we moved in. You have to be careful with that though because it's based on the last year's usage and isn't reevaluated until March.

I lived in a ~1200 sqft apartment in college on the 3rd floor. We kept the AC at 76 and had electric bills ranging from $350-450 in the summer (around $100-150 in the winter). We kept the heat at 65/night 70/day and had gas bills $100-150.

I'm alone this summer in the apartment and I keep the AC at about 77-80 and I'd probably have it even higher but my room is the hotter one of the two since my brother's isn't in the sun really and I really don't leave my room much anyway. so take that into consideration, where the rooms are located in relation to the sun. Even with just me here keeping the AC higher the last bill was about $48 for electric.  For gas it's been about 45-55/month including the colder months. I can't remember what the heat was set at.   Our 2 bdrm is $775 a month, includes water, the internet alone is $41.43. I'm in a pretty large 2 bdrm in iuka park commons and they claim they've been 'newly renovated' so idk how old they are but they are pretty nice."

In simple terms: OSU ""accepts"" the credits, but they don't count towards anything except your total amount of credits earned.   So if you took Computers 101 at Devry and transfered it into OSU, you'd have 4 credits on your transcript but you'd have to take OSU's equivalent of Computers 101 since the one you transferred in didn't apply.

OSU,3abz41,Featherfy,1 point,Thu Jun 18 22:37:13 2015 UTC,i worked the check in desk at orientation last year it's nbd. you'll still get the big red binder of stuff and orientation for parents is pretty much them repeating what's in the binder. so make sure your parents read it when you get home.   if anything the only annoying thing about no parents is you have to make sure you park in the Sisson lot on the first day and move the car to the Tuttle garage the next day to avoid a ticket; they'll tell you this when you check in but just letting you know

I also like to get veggie or turkey burgers from Mirror Lake. There are always the fruit cups and hummus/veggie platters which are grab and go. One place people forget about is the Hospital cafe in Rhodes hall (BistroHIo)- it will give u a little more variety with salads, soups and sandwiches. Someone mentioned 12th Avenue bread Co.

However, he explains things clearly and does a great job of teaching, not just talking at you. His office hours are great too, if you can get past the mob of students from other classes.  For physics 1251 just don't get Barrett."

The material in engineering is hard but he does a great job of making it as easy as possible. As long as you show up, PAY ATTENTION, and start the homework as soon as it is assigned, you will be fine.   Physics 1251: Pray to whatever god you worship because you're just picking whichever professor is the least bad. I can't really recommend anyone, just read the ratemyprofessor posts for each and decide.   Stat 3450: I had Scott Linder. He wasn't bad at all. He even typed all of his notes up before class so that you could add to them during the lecture. The bad news is that his homework was difficult and the tests were very tough. He liked to give problems that we didn't go over in class to see who would get them. Expect to have a test average around a D+, C-. Beyond his assigned homework and 3 review problems, there is not really any way to do practice problems that would help prepare you for the exams. Expect to spend way more time than you should for a 2 credit class to pull off a decent grade."

He's super friendly and does a good job explaining and making material that otherwise could be challenging easy. He's also been voted in for an award in engineering at OSU as one of the best professors and received the award about as often as you're allowed to.  For 1221 I had Brink and he was again friendly and would help you look through your code and troubleshoot. He did a good job of making me understand the use of Matlab much better.   1251 I had lei bao. He's a funny little Asian man and really friendly but maybe not the best professor.   tl;dr Mokashi for 2040 and you won't regret it."

Tires and seats get stolen. Don't get some high tech beautiful bike. But don't get a rusty beat up looking bike either. Don't leave your bike overnight in places like the union or off campus or by south campus dining halls or even by some south campus dorms. I lived in north and didn't park it right next to my building where there was light, but on the rack closer to the trees. Go for bike rides and you'll find some cool places to keep your bike near you. If you're in a dorm and it has a bike room make use of it for sure. You'll need it in the winter. Also this goes without saying but pay attention when you ride. People walk with their phones, even on crosswalks.   You can also use your bike to explore columbus on the weekends in spring or in fall. It's a pretty bike friendly city.

If you have two classes back to back on opposite sides of campus, I would probably recommend bringing a bike. The buses are helpful but during peak hour of the day, they can often be slower than walking due to traffic. If you do plan on bringing a bike, bring one that's not worth that much. Don't bring a $1000 mountain bike. Those are the first bikes to get stolen. As far as locks, get a U-Lock. The cable one's are very easy to cut through. Also, at the beginning of the year the police have something called ""Bug Your Bike."" It registers your bike so that if it does get stolen and you find it in a pawn shop down the street you can prove it's yours. Hopefully that answers your question."

My dad put a special screw on the seat so that certain tools are needed to remove, not just unlock it and go. if you are here for summer after freshman year, I advise you to even consider two locks because the lock I had and the bike were stolen within 4 days of me having locked it next to morrill.   if you really care abt the bike i advise moving it around when you realize you won't be riding it..just to give some clue that it's being used not ignored. mine was gone after 5 days of being locked up but i never had time to ride it due to work training. once i finally had free time it was gone. lock and bike.   heck the other day i saw a homeless guy playing around with the back tire of a nice geared bike at McDonald's out in the open. idk what he was trying to do or how far he got with it but he was really toying with the gear mechanism on the back tire. obviously harder to steal, but again in summer...not as many people, emptier bike racks, more targeting probably. park it around a solid post, if on campus near other bikes, If parking it overnight somewhere take it to your dorm or whatever and put it next to the other bikes. don't leave it at the library or whatever overnight with plans to pick it up tomorrow...it might be gone."

Time it took to lock/unlock it wasn't worth the small savings it bought me on time.  Unless you live far off campus, not a good thing.  Especially in the cold."
OSU,3a1rn1,xam2y,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:52:44 2015 UTC,Make sure you have some way to prove the bike is yours. It is very rare but some thieves will lock your bike with their own lock so they can come back at a more convenient time to steal it. If you can prove you own the bike you won't be hassled when you cut the thief's lock off.
OSU,3a1rn1,imnotminkus,1 point,Wed Jun 17 00:00:46 2015 UTC,I have had 2 years of classes alternating on opposite sides of campus with no bike at all. I walked across campus about 2-5 times a day with no problem (only sore legs for the first few days).
OSU,3a1rn1,JETPUNCH,1 point,Thu Jun 18 11:38:41 2015 UTC,"Don't leave it out during breaks (winter, spring) and if you're not using it when it's cold during the winter, keep it inside somewhere.  Your dorm may have a bike room in the basement, but they often fill up quickly.  Try to sneak it into your room.  I left mine in my room in Morrill over a winter break and came back to see that all the bikes that had been left outside had bent wheels."

OSU,3a1rn1,ohighost8,5,Tue Jun 16 17:00:12 2015 UTC,um....well...ok..that wasn't the U-locks fault. that was his fault for parking it there and the deck's bad construction.   U-locks are totally worth it.

Don't even sweat it. I'd honestly even talk to a TA. You're not paying to learn, you're paying for them to confirm that you learned. If they don't have to do that, they generally don't care if they teach people for free."
OSU,39vokr,KakarotMaag,6,Mon Jun 15 05:44:15 2015 UTC,Listen to this dude. Sat in on plenty of small classes in the sciences and have had 0 problem. I could see running into problems in small upper level courses in the humanities that are based around discussion.
OSU,39vokr,mathafrica,6,Mon Jun 15 12:07:41 2015 UTC,"I know someone who did it, but for a very big class (200 people). He sat in the back and didn't come on test days. I don't think I'll ever be able to do this, as  I'm on a very tight schedule until graduation, but here's what I would do- you're probably planning to do most of these:   Pick a class 50+ people (assuming most people show up)    This is where you're more than likely to get away with it. In a class of 25(enrolled) or less, you'll have to interact with the professor one way or another especially if s/he's passing papers back often.   Find someone trustable with Carmen access to the course.   Classes with 50+ people rarely have handouts so all the needed materials/homeworks etc... are likely to be on Carmen. A perfect candidate for this is someone who seems chill, but most students I've met here are chill so this shouldn't be a problem  Don't talk to the professor or have any interaction if possible   This includes often raising your hands for questions (one or two times throughout the semester is okay). Sitting in the back- if you can see well- will surely help with this. So office hours are out of question.  Don't show up to tests.    Sneaking a test into you bag instead of turning it in is an easy way to get caught. On top of what's happening a plagiarism charge would not look good.    Anyone else, feel free to add to this list. Master ghosting shall become a thing."

OSU,39vokr,casact921,3,Mon Jun 15 14:09:22 2015 UTC,A vast minority of people would do this on consistent basis...i think.
OSU,39vokr,akrubenstein,2,Mon Jun 15 17:00:14 2015 UTC,Then it is fine as it is. The people who want to or need to do it are still going to do it. If it becomes advertised as allowed I bet a good deal of people are either going to move out of their 8am lectures into afternoon lectures or sit with their friends or just show up to see what physics is like and not take it seriously.
OSU,39vokr,TheToasterIncident,1 point,Mon Jun 15 17:20:34 2015 UTC,A lot of people do that anyways. I went to a completely different calc 1 lecture for most of the semester because my professor couldn't teach.

I joined the carmen page for biochem but I have to drop it soon to avoid incurring late fees and re-enrollment stuff but there are a few resources already uploaded that I was looking to get.  I wish I wasn't too shy to ask others for their carmen resources, but otherwise I recommend it if you have time between work and stuff. It's a good way to not fall too behind and if there is a larger lecture you can sit in it might help you get ahead too if you take notes, and make study materials now so you can STUDY during the semester instead of whatever"

Sometimes when I was bored I would just walk to a certain building, most often in the Knowlton big lecture room, and wait for a class to start. I sat in on  for a theater lecture for a bit in the Drake once--but my motivation to do these things is to learn for fun (not very social), I didn't need to worry about tests or getting on carmen or anything, there's no obligation felt to be there other than personal desire. It won't show up on a record unless I test for it.   Don't go to a lab or something small like that obviously haha.

He was a good professor, explaining things thoroughly and ensuring that the class understood the material. He was also strict about no cell phones in class, which at first sounds dumb and controlling but actually helped everyone pay attention. He also had pop quizzes, which ensured students would be less likely to skip classes and therefore more likely to know the material.  With all that being said, I received an A-. I had different professors for ME 2020 and 2030 the following two semesters and received a C+ and D+, respectively. I believe I would've done better with Seeatharaman, but having to simultaneously take both classes would've been miserable. If they're your only two hard (even moderately hard) classes, maybe it's a doable idea. But if possible, I'd hold off on 2030 for another semester."

OSU,3918vv,artscumm,2,Wed Jun 10 15:17:01 2015 UTC,"From what I hear, there is a large market for cse/math people in fields like bio, medicine, etc, due to the fact that a lot of bio people hate math.  Advice, do the cse as your primary major because there aren't a whole lot of job prospects available for bio majors. If you end up working as a cse person in the bio field, you can get a good grasp on what you need to know biologically fairly easily."

I'm interested in your abilities, not your degree. I have worked with people without CIS/CSE degrees who were self taught, they had Physics and Biology degrees. If you are someone you can self teach and convince someone at the University to give you a job (moving around at the same company would prob be the best next step until you can get more experience). Someone may be willing to take a chance on you. In the meantime I would take those 10 credit hours with an expectation that you may not finish. Time is money too...the sooner you can get real experience the better IMO."

OSU,391non,bucki_fan,1 point,Mon Jun 8 17:38:01 2015 UTC,"Parking passes for spots around/near the stadium are generally sold with season tickets to Buckeye Club members.  The longer you've been a member and/or the more $$ you've donated, the more points you have and the closer to the stadium you may be offered to buy.    Even if you do get a pass for a lot, parking spaces are first-come, first-served; though most of the established tailgates don't change their location and it would be very poor form to take someone's spot.  Assuming you're not talking about any of the reserved parking (East or West Stadium, French Field House, the garages, or the RV lots next to Bill Davis, etc.) you're paying day of game to park and basically it's a free-for-all; though I think /u/Unbelieverable's link shows that you can reserve spots north of Jesse Owens' stadium.

OSU,38zh2y,sshheelleeyy,2,Mon Jun 8 03:32:34 2015 UTC,It's pretty quiet. The only other sounds I remember were miscellaneous clicks (and other people typing in the writing sections). They limit the room to like 10 or less people. I remember having a decent amount of room for writing and scratch work. It was a while ago but I definitely don't remember having an issue with the amount of space or the noise. I think they also allow ear plus if you're very worried about noise levels.

OSU,38zh2y,NastyRazorburn,1 point,Mon Jun 8 05:05:15 2015 UTC,"I took it about 7 months ago. Plenty of space for scratch paper. Incredibly quiet. You start with the essays, so there's lots of typing for the 1st hour. Then all you here are clicks and the occasional cough."
OSU,38zh2y,SamTomTheWise,1 point,Mon Jun 8 12:02:25 2015 UTC,"It is extremely quiet other than mouse clicks and typing, like others have said. I took it a couple months ago, and even when a computer broke down and people did have to create a disruption, they still kept quiet enough that it was easy to ignore. If you do find it too loud, they have headphones you can wear to help bring the noise down more. Also, the desks are fairly large, and have a desk lamp for more light. Much better test-taking experience than the SAT or ACT when I took that in high school."

OSU,38tysi,watson1238,1 point,Mon Jun 8 12:30:14 2015 UTC,"""Exploration"" is essentially Undeclared Major. I would talk to your advisor if you are concerned about how your credits transferred.   As for housing, if your a sophomore j recommend living on campus so you can more easily meet people your year. Upperclassmen though tend to like off campus' lack of restrictions, and you can always find roomies on the many Facebook pages."
OSU,38tysi,xAmortenti,1 point,Sat Jun 6 22:06:22 2015 UTC,"Hey!  I transferred into OSU back in 2010.    I for sure recommend living on campus during your first semester.  It helped me a lot to meet people (I lived in Morrill), and they typically do have places for transfers.  I remember around now was when I accepted my OSU admission, so you should be okay!  Exploration is where they put almost all transfers.  If you didn't automatically pre-qualify at a Pre-Major (i.e. Pre-Engineering), they'll put you in Exploration.  You are not automatically enrolled in a program when you get admitted.  So they place you into exploration, typically for a semester until you declare.    Be warned, sometimes transfer credit can be really tricky.  Transfer credit is very dependent on the material taught in class (always have a syllabus ready!), the book used, your grade, what school it was from, if there was a lab component, etc.  Note that half my credits form my old school didn't transfer over, so be warned!  Always try to make a case.  If at all anything, you should be able to take the EM test, which I think costs $60 per test if a credit doesn't transfer over.  Sometimes you can appeal too, but it's just a forewarning.  Hope this answers your questions!  If you have anything else, feel free to PM me!"

OSU,38m4hl,smooter106,1 point,Fri Jun 5 12:50:49 2015 UTC,"How busy does it usually get, and how flexible are you with the work hour scheduling? Any positive/negative experiences you had that you could share?"
OSU,38m4hl,smooter106,3,Fri Jun 5 13:50:08 2015 UTC,"So, the computer lab monitor position I had is the same one that was posted here.  This is the overnight shift that they are hiring for, but it's the same duties as the regular shifts, just paid more.  Other positions may vary.    So let's talk about hours.  As a student, if you are taking classes, you can only take a maximum of 28 hours legally.  What happens with my department is all of the students submit their availability to our supervisor, and he/she distributes the hours based on people's availability, seniority, and preference.  So if you have classes at certain times on certain days, you block that off on your schedule so that you can't be scheduled to work.  Same thing if you have other activities or another job.  You tell them when you absolutely can't work.  The more availability you have, the more hours you are likely to get.  If you are scheduled for a shift or series of shifts that you can't make because of whatever reason, you are able to trade or give your shifts to other student co-workers that are willing to take them, pending approval from the supervisor.  During break weeks or summer terms, as long as you aren't taking classes, you can work up to 38 hours.  On to positive experiences.  Here are just a few.  You can do your homework, study, read, watch movies, whatever, just as long as you attend to your duties as a monitor.  This is useful if you are taking a heavy class load but also need money.  The full time staff is amazing.  Every boss I've had has been awesome, and a couple of them even worked my job before they got hired on full time.  90% of my student co-workers have been ok.  You get a few lazy ones or some people you just can't stand, but they are few and far between.  We go out for happy hours on Fridays, play video games on the weekends, and generally just have a good time.  The atmosphere is extremely relaxed, as long as you get your work done.  Negatives.  Customer service.  This is your main duty, really.  And that means dealing with angry and upset people.  Some days you can go without talking to a single person, some days it seems everything is going wrong.  We also deal with other University departments regularly, like UniPrint, the Digital Union, the libraries, and more, and that can get frustrating.  But there is really not much else that I can think of that I would consider as negative.  Except that today is my last day.   TL;DR Hours are flexible based on your availability and seniority. Extremely relaxed atmosphere. Angry people suck.  10/10 would recommend to anyone."
OSU,38m4hl,smooter106,3,Fri Jun 5 14:11:55 2015 UTC,"Forgot about how busy it gets.  Peak times at the labs I work in are from about 10am-3pm.  People will have a hard time finding a place to work during this range.  Fridays are generally slower, and when mid-terms and finals week rolls around, those times are busy as well.  We run a poster printer in a lab, so whenever the Denman Undergraduate Research Forum rolls around, or another similar event, poster printing makes that lab really busy."
OSU,38m4hl,imnotminkus,1 point,Fri Jun 5 14:26:00 2015 UTC,"I was one of the people roaming around fixing computers in the libraries and non-departmental labs/classrooms (level 2 tech) and worked with the lab monitors regularly.  I loved my job, and from what I know, I'd recommend the lab monitor job.  Less work at times than what I did and more regularity, but also less freedom.  The only better on-campus job in terms of easiness is working at a dorm's front desk."

OSU,38kja4,HallucinAs1an,11,Thu Jun 4 20:35:03 2015 UTC,"My mom stayed in a hotel while I stayed in morrill. The people I was with were cool but I didn't try to make any connections, there will be more time for that later. IIRC a lot of the stuff was optional and pretty dumb icebreaker stuff, don't be a jackass and complain about it though just take it in stride.   The biggest thing is do not schedule 8 ams or classes after 5, you will hate yourself, and don't use a graphing calculator if you are doing math placement tests. They don't check/care but I used mine like a crutch and aced the test, which put me into calc where you cannot use a calculator at all which was rough to say the least. Best to get an honest score than an inflated one and pay for it with a challenging first semester.  Looking back at it, don't buy the lunch package and just eat somewhere on high street, it will be cheaper and better."
OSU,38kja4,TheToasterIncident,8,Thu Jun 4 23:25:35 2015 UTC,I recommend staying over night. It'll give you sense of what dorm life is like and you'll get to meet new people. My parents did come but they stayed in a hotel off campus.

Also, I don't know if they still have those morning meetings you attend in the morning of the 2nd day, but if you stay in the dorm you can just walk to the buildings those meetings are in.

OSU,38kja4,thatwaswicked,2,Fri Jun 5 20:56:08 2015 UTC,"Both of my parents came for orientation and there was separate ""parents only stuff"" throughout the two days. Personally, I hated staying at Morrill overnight because my orientation group was extremely late and everyone else was asleep/basically in bed once I got back to the dorm. I didn't make any connections with them or even talk to them. But, everyone's experience can be different. I'd still recommend spending the night in the dorm just to get a feel for it.  Also, the people signing me up for classes bullied me and several others into taking 8 AM chem (and a variety of other things I did not want). We were a very early orientation group to schedule that summer and other slots were definitely open. This was with CFAES so other colleges may be different. CFAES did not give us the opportunity to schedule ourselves. They just met with us individually, gave us a slip of paper, and said ""here's your schedule"". Do not let them bully you and stand your ground. You are the customer paying them to do their jobs."

I'm an incoming freshman in engineering honors who already took a year of programming in high school so I'm gonna have to take ENGR 1281.02H, which is FEH and its at 8am for 4 days, which I accept because there are no other sections. But, based on the other classes I have to take, my schedule could either be really shitty, giving me class at like 7pm, or really nice, ending my day at like 12PM-1:30PM everyday. So my question is, can I ""stand my ground"" and say nah give me a better schedule? I'd much rather be done at like 1PM because of that 8AM."
OSU,38kja4,thatwaswicked,2,Fri Jun 5 15:33:56 2015 UTC,"You can most certainly try. If there is a better schedule out there, definitely push for it. No guarantees that seats will be available by the time your orientation rolls around because popular classes go fast. But since you're in honors you definitely have a good shot. Also, engineering may be allowed to schedule themselves with guidance since I heard many of my friends did it that way in a computer lab vs. the strict ""here's your schedule"" I experienced with CFAES."
OSU,38kja4,imnotminkus,1 point,Fri Jun 5 18:00:13 2015 UTC,"I said ""no early classes please"" on my scheduling form and was given a 9:30 intro to engineering class instead of a 7:30 or 11:30 one, so I'm not sure if it helped or not, but it doesn't hurt to try, then if you are assigned morning classes, you can ask the advisors nicely if you can switch because you don't do well in the morning or whatever."
OSU,38kca8,Hardrock131,8,Thu Jun 4 19:58:06 2015 UTC,There are no practices and prep sessions are attended by 2% of those with tickets. Not required by any means.
OSU,38kca8,mtjess60,4,Thu Jun 4 20:57:51 2015 UTC,"I got season tickets as a student for 4 years, 2 of which were in Block O and the other 2 being assigned seating. I much preferred the atmosphere of Block O, but the thing I probably liked the best was the lack of assigned seating.  Both years that I wasnt in Block O I would constantly deal with people bringing their friends into their section and messing up the seating assignments which was very frustrating. Then since everything would be messed up people would start standing on the seats, which is something they actively stop people from doing in Block O.   My experience definitely doesnt apply to all of assigned seating in the student section though."
OSU,38kca8,priceisalright,3,Fri Jun 5 00:27:44 2015 UTC,"There is no commitment, contrary to what others have said. You show your Block O ticket to the bouncer and they give you a wristband that lets you sit in Block O. This means you can buy a Block O ticket from someone else and get in with no problem. You do not need to have the entire Block O season package.   Block O is general seating. This is the only real advantage for a freshman. If you are willing to show up 2-4 hours before kickoff, you can sit down low with some of the most spirited people you will ever meet and get a better view than with Rank 1 tickets. The disadvantage to this is that you HAVE to show up 2-4 hours early to get the good spots. The higher you go in Block O, the less and less invested in the game people seem to be. If you arrive after kickoff, the people you will stand with usually are no different than everyone else there.   I'd say Block O is only really worth it if you show up early and sit low (or sit with other spirited friends). Otherwise, it is not really any different than regular seating. Since you can buy individual tickets from other people (lots of people sell them, you will have no trouble getting one) I'd recommend sitting with your friends or roommate(s) and buy individual tickets to the big games. You'll save a lot of money by getting regular Big10 or Season Tickets and just buying individual Block O tickets."

You'll be in the center of the seating area (either North or South stands). Downside is that you'll have to be available for committments to Block O. I understand there are practices/prep sessions for some of the stuff that they do during the games.
OSU,38kca8,scotsworth,5,Thu Jun 4 20:44:12 2015 UTC,There was like one prep session at the beginning of the season...everything else is completely optional.

OSU,38kr1i,westrags,5,Thu Jun 4 21:13:59 2015 UTC,If you want to exchange you will need to also pay cash on top. BOS is usually the most desirable.   You probably aren't going to get in BOS with a BON ticket. You need to show the ticket to the bouncer for them to give you a wristband.
OSU,38kr1i,steve_jahbs,4,Fri Jun 5 00:45:49 2015 UTC,You also can sit in Block O South if you sign up to help set up. This would mean that you get there before the game and help layout the card stunts in the North and South Stands.

OSU,38lou9,misteryub,1 point,Sat Jun 6 14:31:11 2015 UTC,"Right, and I know anecdotally that that is a hard threshold. But OP was more asking if he would be able to catch up once he does get in in the spring and it sounded like he assumes he's getting up to a 3.0, he wasn't asking if they would move the threshold for him. I can't answer that question as I am not Fisher, but I bet if he goes straight GE he shouldn't be delayed too too much. Econ and some other stuff obviously isn't Fisher as well"
OSU,38lou9,bwolfgang94,1 point,Sat Jun 6 16:49:25 2015 UTC,"No, I mean that OP will need to wait until the beginning of Spring semester to apply. If he currently has a 2.9, and he isn't taking classes, OP can't apply in Autumn, since it's in September and he still has a 2.9. Therefore, he'll need to raise the GPA in autumn, and then apply in Spring semester. However, he wouldn't be in Fisher until they accept him, so he wouldn't be able to take the business classes (except for accounting and econ and geneds) until Summer at the earliest."
OSU,38lou9,misteryub,3,Sat Jun 6 18:35:11 2015 UTC,"Typically 4-6 weeks after the application deadline you will find out their decision.

OSU,38j1db,sgspectra,3,Thu Jun 4 15:31:53 2015 UTC,"Correct. Those things on the backs of the cars that look like cameras or weird radar are plate readers.

A lot of high achieving high school students do this, and then start out in college in the really hard classes with only a high school level of knowledge.  This can lead to them getting overwhelmed academically while trying to adjust to college life.  If you take the longer road, aka don't test out, you'll probably do really well in those classes, helping your gpa.  Then when you get to the higher level courses you'll have a really solid understanding.  This will also help you get into your engineering program, which is a not easy at OSU.  The gpa cutoffs seem to go up every year.  I do recommend testing out of any fluff courses you can, like english, history, etc, they don't make much of a difference."
OSU,38ey2p,Jrbaconcheeez,3,Fri Jun 5 01:32:59 2015 UTC,"The zero in 0-3 means you can overlap with another or take a 3 hour separate one. For Ethics I highly recommend Sociology 3302 which overlaps with any Social science subgroup. This means your ethics is covered and you only have to take a course from one of the social science subgroups. For the diversity, I got credit from my writing course. Just take any underlined class from one of the other groups.   If you want to see if your AP counts towards a GE, login to buckeye link and on the right under enrollment information, click on degree audit and run an audit for whatever program you are listed in. Once you open the audit it will show each of the GE categories and if you have completed them yet. NOTE: I have no idea if you have access to this yet or if your transfer credit will have posted yet since you are incoming. It should still count for a GE if it also covers a class for a minor.   For completing GEs first semester, I don't think you have the option of taking many. For engineering your first semester is going to be math, physics, survey, and intro to engineering. This is 13 hours so you probably can only take one."

Understand you're taking SEVERAL high level college courses in one semester; not like idk Calc 3 at a college in addition to your high school curriculum. I am NOT saying you can't do it, but it will not be a pleasant semester.   Assuming you don't have AP Bio credit...take 1113 instead of math. Though I have a feeling you have credit for it  based on this....particular situation.  idk either way FEH is a bitch of a course and if this were me...if I finished work for FEH which is I feel is something that doesn't actually happen the last thing I want to do is partial differential equations.

I feel like FEH with 2177 and almost nothing else relatively challenging would be doable.

OSU,38ey2p,Featherfy,1 point,Thu Jun 4 18:37:45 2015 UTC,"I'm just trying to understand why you want to take a full 18 hr courseload your first semeser. I mean I realize that the extraneous course are easy but your advisor will definitely not recommend it (or even allow it due this being  your first semester) even though it doesn't require much work. I've been doing this ever since my second semester.   A lot of GEs have a lot of annoying busywork and essays. Unfortunately this isn't high school where your final is a crossword and your grade is buffered from hw. For some courses yes this is true but just consider that you may be biting off more than you can chew. I've done shit like this and taken 2 ridiculous GEs at once at it took a horrible amount of time out my schedule because ""they were easy As"" and I got As but it still did some damage to my main coursework because I made the mistake of accidentally prioritizing badly.   Whether or not you choose to take this advice is up to you, but idk. Online courses can be a huge huge drag. I've taken a number to pad my own GPA but I hated it so much. Lol and I'm probably overreacting and being ridiculous idk.   Just don't be the person with the inflated ego thinking that you're all badass taking 18 credit hours with those courses. Otherwise FEH and math will crush that ego to the ground before you even know what hits you.. taking one advanced college course in high school at a university along with your regular AP filled courseload is one thing.   Taking several college courses at once is a totally different ballgame. Dunno if this has helped or if it became a rant. Just don't want other freshman making mistakes I did when I was a freshman because you'll be spending the rest of college trying to correct it"

If you are looking at majoring in BME...that is one of the HARDEST majors to get into. and personally I believe one of the most useless majors ever if you plan on industry any way. You need at least 3.75 to get in. Regardss of advanced coursework.   You are preengineering right now...you have NOT been accepted into your engineering major yet. Understand this. You are allowed to retake courses...physics 1250/51 or math 2153 or even try retaking but maybe the honors versions if you want ro be advanced but know the material. ...even if you have credit for it. Math courses at OSU are absolutely insane and the professors and department can be horrendous. Taking a math course you've already succeeded in (2153) at OSU again will give you an idea of what to expect in osu math...the crazyass pace, a full undergrad courseload to go with it, the tests that make up 80% of your grade with D averages being the norm...etc.   It's a different world in the math department and it might not be pleasant to start off advanced as a freshman. I have seen many many intelligent fellow students completely fail advanced math when taken as a freshman. Just a warning.   It isn't that 18hrs sucks entirely. I mean I've been taking rando courses as a gpa boost. I took 18 my second sem and did pretty well. I just wanted to get a feel of college before I did such a thing regardless of what I had been told of course ease."

And you are going against other crazy smart kids and then some. Consider taking (retaking) courses for the sole point of getting in your major. Once you're in it's a bit less stressful in terms of knowing your major. (The rest is stressful tho)

OSU,38anyd,Uzrathixius,2,Tue Jun 2 23:56:53 2015 UTC,"I completed the Interior Design program- which has less applicants than Industrial.   First, you have to apply and be accepted into the Pre-Design program, which isn't bad. They only accept 80 students for pre-design. After the first year you are able to apply for one of the 3 design majors. You submit some of this pre-design work as part of your application portfolio.  The portfolio review (I did this 3 years ago so it may have changed) is not too bad. You are told to draw some still life and then they have 2 projects you complete and then you can add supplementary work you've done on your own. One project is a visual demonstration of something- mine was 'how to change a bike tire'. The second project is geared towards the major you are applying for- so you would have some sort of product design one (example- mine was to redesign a coffee shop).  Visual Communication is the most applied for major. So out of the 80 pre-design students, most will be applying for VC. If you don't get accepted into Industrial but they like your work, you might be placed in Interior until a space opens in Industrial (saw that happen last year).   Here is our 2015 senior exhibition website. You can get an idea of the level of talent of past industrial students."
OSU,38anyd,heathaleatha,1 point,Wed Jun 3 03:12:32 2015 UTC,"Howdy! don't listen to heather (she cray), we got into the interiors program the same year but we did it during the quarters system and now it has changed to semesters. If I remember correctly you need to take a few basic classes and your portfolio will be an accumulation of the work produced in those classes with maybe the ability to add in other work. Contact Gabe Tippery at the design department, he is the advisor there and is very helpful. He was also a former student at the design school so he is very familiar with the design program.   After watching my friends go through the Industrial program I think that one of the most important qualities to have (outside of a fairly decent understanding of how to draw forms) is that you are committed. To thrive in that program you need to constantly be sketching and working through your designs. If you sketch a ton and can show progress from initial stages to an end product you will be golden.   Also good to note is that if you don't get in the first time you apply it is supposedly a much higher chance you get in the second time, which again shows your commitment."

One of my other options was getting the degree at a less-expensive school (tacking ChemE onto my current degree would still take me at least 2 years + summers to re-take, and would probably take 5 years if I just go back), but the issue is that I already have so many of the elective AND pre-req classes FROM my bio degree.  Honestly going straight to grad school for engineering would probably be the quickest route, but I don't know whether or not that would put me at a disadvantage academically and career-wise for not having a B.S.E. first.  Anyway, yeah, definitely going to try to talk to an advisor.  I'm pretty sure I can make appointments over summer even if I'm not taking classes.  There's so many pros and cons to each route.

I guess the main reason I was considering tacking on a BSE is because I'm not entirely sure I want to do research for the rest of my life.  I like it, but my research advisor has told me it's not a great time to get into research unless you're SURE you can get funding.  I feel like having an engineering background might open up a couple other options.  I really do need to start job-hunting, whether I graduate this fall or not... :'( I don't think I'm ready to grow up.  Maybe I should just stay in school forever!!!!"
OSU,385vo8,grassfedgrass,1 point,Tue Jun 2 15:00:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's looking like that's going to be a better option for me.  I really wanted to just graduate with a dual-degree but switching to the College of Engineering is going to be a pain in the ass, if not downright impossible, because I think it's selective anyway and I'd forgotten how rigorous their program is, meaning that I have to take all the classes they want me to take exactly when and how they want me to take them. :-P  It might just be easier to re-apply to the university after I graduate :-(  I want to talk to my advisor and make an appointment about this, but my summer work schedule is really variable and I don't live in Columbus so I might not be able to until the fall.  Oh, well.  At least I can brush up my resume and start job-hunting.  Thanks for all the advice!"
OSU,385vo8,dumplump12,3,Wed Jun 3 12:59:48 2015 UTC,"This is a tough call. Like you said your adviser will help you mainly, but I can give you some insight on Tissue Engineering.

I know and have worked with many chemical engineers and that curriculum doesn't seem to fit with your interests.  Just my opinion here, but the engineering isn't really going to do much for you and you'll still need at least the M.S."
OSU,385vo8,bumpymind,1 point,Thu Jun 4 11:00:43 2015 UTC,"Right, I'm glad you wrote this.  I'll definitely keep this in mind.  I was originally looking into other subfields of engineering like BME, but I heard that's dead-end for getting jobs from a lot of people.  I was thinking about engineering especially because I don't have many skills outside of the lab (PCR/Western Blot/etc).  I DO know that the ONLY type of engineering I was seriously considering was like, biomolecular chemical engineering.  Which is basically just ChemE with biology electives, hahaha.  But it's good to know that the ChemE/bio focus isn't as glorified as I made it seem to myself, especially considering my interests.   I should probably make an appointment with a career counselor, in addition to my advisor.  It's just hard to get to Columbus in the summer since I'm working and I'm scheduled on a week-to-week basis.  But I do want to get this all sorted out ASAP.  Sorry for rambling omg haha.

OSU,3858rf,cfish22,6,Mon Jun 1 23:10:57 2015 UTC,"I can comment on a couple of these things:   I lived in Neilwood Gables (now Mendoza House) last year. Overall I loved it, but it's sort of a different atmosphere than other dorms. Most residents are upperclassmen that embrace the apartment-like setting of the building and don't socialize with floor mates as much as I've seen in other dorms. Having a kitchen with an oven and large fridge is great if you wanna cook. Biggest downside is the building is 90 years old and it shows: leaning floors, broken lights, a couple plumbing issues, and no air conditioning.  I'm in the arts and sciences honors program. Some of the requirements are crappy (i.e. upper level courses or honors courses for most/all geneds) but honors classes themselves are awesome because you generally are in a smaller setting with a respected professor instead of a TA or someone else.   Edit: Just saw that you were doing business, Neilwood would be amazing for this as it is literally across a sidewalk from Fisher. I had an accounting class in Schoenbaum and I could leave my room five minutes before class started and be one of the first ones there."
OSU,3858rf,buddhasuncle,2,Tue Jun 2 03:53:17 2015 UTC,"Ah you're the best thank you so much.  1. Did you go random into Mendoza or have a set roommate? I'm kinda worried about who my roommate will be. I'm not too worried about living in an older building because my dorm last year at my former school was incredibly nasty. The water damage in the walls were so bad that you could physically move the walls if you pushed on them. Pretty gross. And ahh no air conditioning? It said online that it did have some. That's a bummer. Did you guys just basically bring a ton of fans then?  2. I definitely want smaller classes I think. My largest class at my former school was 30 people so OSU will be a huge adjustment. Can you choose which geneds you want to take as honors? Or do they say you have to take honors lit, honors history, honors whatever?"
OSU,3858rf,buddhasuncle,2,Tue Jun 2 14:22:36 2015 UTC,"I went into Mendoza with someone I knew from high school and had roomed with the year before so I didn't have many issues there. I've heard of people doing random roommates, it probably won't be an issue but there's always the risk of that crazy person. It's possible they're adding air conditioning through renovations this summer, but I doubt it, the infrastructure isn't there at all (the heat came through shitty radiators probably as old as the building). We had a couple box fans running in windows basically year round as heat was crazy hot in the winter.  Honors classes are usually capped somewhere around 30 so that would be more the size you're used to. Generally ASC Honors wants you to take all your geneds as either an honors course or an upper level (3000 or 4000 depending on department) course. Biggest issue with this is I came in with 9 credit hours of history from AP credit and I still had to take an upper level history course because those credits ""weren't good enough"". There are sometimes weird exceptions, but I'd talk to your adviser about those things."

I started in honors arts and sciences, it was decent, but decided not to be on honors when i switched to engineering. Enjoyed a few of the honors classes i took. Just keep in mind that you will likely need to take about one of these honors classes or another high level class per semester to stay in the program. You will have to meet with an advisor and have your schedule planned out and show that you will fulfill the honors requirements. Overall not too bad, but some of those classes may be more rigorous and you will need to maintain a relatively high gpa (3.4 i think)"
OSU,3858rf,clegolfer92,2,Tue Jun 2 00:40:16 2015 UTC,Thank you!! 1. What honors classes did you take? How much more difficult do you find them in comparison to your normal classes?

I think this can depend, as one of my friends had a lot more work than i did for his honors psych. I also took some honors calc and physics classes and those were pretty difficult.

It is a community college, but it's still a great place to attend classes.   If you really want to do CSE, you should make every effort to attend Ohio State. But do keep in mind that the first year is competitive, so it will take effort to actually get into the major. Your first year at Ohio State is your ""pre-major"" and your GPA needs to be at least 3.2.  The good thing about Columbus State is that GPA doesn't transfer. So if you are bad at math (like me), but at good at programming, it can help to take class a Columbus State as well.  Honestly though, you need to be talking to your schools and advisers though, not reddit. Try to meet with an advisor or physically come to the Student Service Center here at Ohio State for immediate help. Also, see what your ""back-out"" options are with BGSU by contacting them directly."

That would give you a higher chance of success in that degree.  The only thing I do know is that graduating with a CSE degree from OSU is going to have more prestige against the CS degree from BGSU.

I talked to someone at the physics dept and of course they told me that I would have to take 1250/1251.  Why isn't it realistic for you to take 1250/1251?  I took both at CSCC and for 1250 it was a hybrid course.  It was all online except for having to go in on Saturdays for a few hours for lab/lecture.  1250 was pretty damn easy at CSCC.

You can EM test out of 1250 and 1251 but you will need to study the calculus component. If you got the 1200 and 1201 from AP physics, there is a ton more stuff that you will have to study to pass the EM tests.  A lot of people are hating on the physics department because of their lack of help and clarity. I would highly recommend doing the  honors versions 1250H and 1251H because the profs (Brian Winer and Ralf Bundschuh) are exceptionally good.

Both classes took large amounts of outside work to complete, and the curves are small for 1250H and Bundschuh does not curve 1251H.

If you're going at what you can assume is not a busy hour, you'll probably get more time to shoot.  However, do not buy ammo from them. Their prices are an absolute joke. As in charging like $18-19 for 50 rounds of 9mm (I can buy it online with shipping cost for under $11 per 50). And over $40 for 325 rounds of .22LR (Cabelas has it for like $25). If you're 21, buy your ammo online, or if you're more impatient, buy it from Cabela's at Polaris. MUCH cheaper.  If you end up getting ""gun fever"" and wish to buy one, get a ""feel"" for it there, but buy that as well online and transfer it somewhere else, because their transfer fees are expensive ($45 compared to Alpha Star Tactical which is $15) Their gun rental fee is $15 however, and they do have a decent selection."
OSU,37o6o8,wforwumbo1,7,Fri May 29 05:06:11 2015 UTC,"Check Out LEPD. Its on bethel road, a mile west of 71. The guys there are super nice and its only 20 bucks an hour for one lane, but you can have two people to a lane, so you can split the cost.

While its extremely nice, its very expensive."

Vance's obetz range is also good.  If it is your first time you should try to have someone experienced take you guys or have them assign you a range officer otherwise they might not allow you to shoot.
OSU,37o6o8,SlickRick1,1 point,Fri May 29 02:57:22 2015 UTC,"I would also recommend blackwing. I'm guessing by ""plus more per person"" you're talking about having multiple people on the same lane? I've always just paid $20 per lane. Their ammo at blackwing was fairly reasonable for a range too. Plus the guys are pretty cool. My only complaint was they wouldn't allow you to draw from a holster unless you've taken a pistol course with them. Somewhat understandable, but irritating."

OSU,37pp39,brutusb0104,5,Fri May 29 12:38:53 2015 UTC,Hands down machine elements.  Thermo is not as hard as some people have said.  It's a lot of repeating the same ideas on different systems.  Machine Elements has a huge amount of material and the problems are rather long.  I also had to suffer through a poor teacher who didn't speak English well and was lecturing from incorrect slides he didn't even make.  It's a 4 credit hour class for a reason.
OSU,37pp39,MKSt11235,3,Fri May 29 17:32:55 2015 UTC,"Good ol' Dr. Su? I had both him and Dr Harper for the class, they both kind of stunk tbh"

OSU,37pp39,MKSt11235,2,Fri May 29 19:00:06 2015 UTC,"Thermo is conceptually more trickier than Machine Elements, but it can be interesting precisely because of that. I got quite bored with Machine Elements, which follows a formulaic approach to problem solving. But then again, I took Thermo in 2009 (quarters, yes, I know!). Moran's book (who also taught it then, last time he did) is very nice, and other Thermo books (Cengel, Van Wylen & Sonntag etc), are also equally good. We had Shigley for Machine Elements, but I am sure things have changed now."
OSU,37pp39,stormyzephyr,2,Fri May 29 14:11:15 2015 UTC,"We had Shigley for Machine Elements   You were probably the last class to use it. We switched to this atrocity by OSU professors. I ended up using an old copy of Shigley through out the course. Unfortunately, the homework/tests were graded to the Busby/Staab book which had some significant deviations from Shigley."
OSU,37pp39,bsilvereagle,2,Fri May 29 14:31:28 2015 UTC,"I feel sorry for you. I did have Busby (old-fashioned, boring, did not suffer fools) and also Staab (that man with his stale humor) for two of my advanced courses, but I had Kinzel for Machine Elements (now retired).

OSU,37pp39,stormyzephyr,1 point,Fri May 29 14:40:05 2015 UTC,"Both are 100% wholly dependent on the professor. The actual difficulty of the material is about the same. The thermo book is much better than the Machine Elements book, but the lectures can be a little more dense."
OSU,37pp39,bsilvereagle,1 point,Fri May 29 13:21:25 2015 UTC,"I personally thought machine elements was the more difficult of the two, but the classes are difficult for different reasons. Machines is hard because there's a ton of material. Thermo is difficult because of the concepts.   So what are you better at? Memorization or understanding?"
OSU,37pp39,jimbub,1 point,Fri May 29 18:42:38 2015 UTC,I'm two years removed from my masters but ill weigh in.    I had Moran for Thermo who was tough as hell but I got through it with an A- with a bit extra work.  Moran was crazy hard but I know thermo as good as anyother subject.  It is a tough topic but with a midrange of work and effort required.    I had Staab for Machine elements and more than anything this is a lot of work more than it is a tough subject.      Both require work but for different reasons.
OSU,37pp39,Hammerosu,1 point,Sat May 30 02:33:09 2015 UTC,"At this point, you'll notice that certain people gravitate towards one over the other, you may personally just understand one set of concepts better than others. This is obvious just from the few responses made before me.  Ultimately though, it comes down to which profs you get, because that is going to change how much of the material you have to teach yourself outside of lecture.

OSU,37lfu6,daisy_daisy12,9,Thu May 28 14:07:22 2015 UTC,"The care you will receive will be as good as a private practice, if not better. You will get a student, an assistant and a professor to examine the issues that you are having. They are probably more thorough as well. Cost will be much lower than a private practice as well, although, I don't think anyone on Reddit will be able to give you a price range since we don't know what tests they will need to perform, how many x-rays they will need to take, and how much your insurance will negotiate on your behalf.  Your appointment will take longer than a private practice since so many people will be examining your mouth. The first time you go, I would not be surprised if you are there for more than 2 hours.  I started going there when I was 17 and started at OSU. I moved to California, came back, and started going there again. Before I got married, they even were able to do cosmetic whitening for my wife and I.

OSU,37lfu6,neths,2,Thu May 28 14:32:50 2015 UTC,"Maybe check into seeing the student and saving yourself a bit of money.  If your issues are that serious, a faculty member will take a look anyhow.

I had a bad experience at their grad clinic with a tooth extraction. Student gave me no pain meds and no antibiotics until I got a jaw infection, then gave me an antibiotic I was listed as allergic to.  I was miserable as hell until I finally got the resident professor, who was shocked at the student's incompetence.  I get better care at my private dentist (I am staff) now by far.

Fairly straightforward for exams and stuff except when he decides to drop your class's average on the third or fourth midterm. Voice may put you to sleep sometimes.   Clay is a very good and thorough professor, but he's generally regarded as more difficult than Koelling (though not astronomically more difficult). He's super nice, I've never even had a class with him and he knows my name. Clay usually only teaches early sections because as someone said he also works at Battelle.

The one major difference between the two is their teaching style. Clay uses power points and moves fairly quickly through the material and examples, while Koelling takes his time and teaches less broad material. Personally I would choose Koelling again if I had to, only because his class is later and I prefer chalk board lectures vs PowerPoint. They are both good profs though!"

Personally, I would take it with Koelling since he has taught 2200 before and from what I've heard (my boyfriend was his TA a few years back) he teaches it very well. I had Koelling for 5779 (rheology) and Clay for 3610 (the old Unit Ops preclass) and they're both great professors and even nicer guys. You can't go wrong with either, really.

If I misread it, and I just automatically have that degree in addition to my BA, I should probably figure out where to pick up the diploma as well.."

OSU,37icoj,HugzMonster,3,Wed May 27 21:56:38 2015 UTC,Rational Development Software   Why is RAD and ClearCase so fucking terrible?  I used them both for almost 2 years and they were both the most frustrating pieces of software I've ever used.
OSU,37icoj,optiplex9000,4,Wed May 27 23:04:13 2015 UTC,"I can't speak for the applications now since I haven't been around the Rational portfolio in close to 10 years.  The main concerns back then were how resource intensive they were due to the Eclipse platform and how poorly ClearCase and ClearQuest performed in comparison to alternatives in the market (mostly open source).  It was very hard to sell a customer on spending millions on development tools from IBM when the open source community was creating a better alternative that was continually worked on and improved by the Java community.  Oh yeah and their tools were free.  Edit: My best analogy for this is how Blizzard Entertainment makes assumptions about how we should play the game Diablo 3 when most of the community is still pissed off about the game lacking fundamental core elements from Diablo 2 that made the franchise fun to begin with.

OSU,37ckxs,arijen,2,Thu May 28 00:46:28 2015 UTC,"You're not paying double. The summer membership is a special case because they allow other university students to buy it. It has to cover a reasonable amount of time for them too, i.e. when they get home for the summer up until when they go back to school. That's why the dates line up that way.   Yes, the dates overlap, but if you're enrolled in the fall as well your membership is essentially purchased for June and July for $82."
OSU,37ckxs,runningformylife,1 point,Tue May 26 19:54:53 2015 UTC,"In practice the summer fee does not apply to May so you didn't actually pay twice for May, not sure for August  Source: I enrolled for summer (6 credits) but not spring semester, and I don't currently have RPAC access even though the fee was assessed.  EDIT: Sorry you're talking about manually paying a summer fee, I can't say for sure but they did prorate my girlfriend's gym access by month in the spring, not sure if they would do that for the summer."

OSU,37ckxs,runningformylife,1 point,Tue May 26 19:56:26 2015 UTC,It should be prorated to $82 for the summer term. Thats what was done the last couple of summers.
OSU,37ckxs,JSzafarski,3,Tue May 26 19:35:04 2015 UTC,"It is, but that's not what they're talking about. They're saying, I already paid for May with spring, and I'll pay August with fall, so I should only have to pay June and July. But that's not how it works."
OSU,37ckxs,runningformylife,0,Tue May 26 19:58:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, all of the pricing is done by academic term. There are no monthly memberships.

I leaned a TON about beer and can now successfully one-up some of my guy friends (I'm a girl), so I think that's pretty cool.

During most times, you can go to the library and check out a guest computer account. It gives you credentials to use the library computers, complete with internet access. Depending on how busy the library is, it lasts between 2 hours to a day pass. I would imagine that for most of the summer, it'll be a day pass. There are rare times (exams, etc) where they won't have any to check out or have very limited. Be prepared to show a drivers license to check one of these out.   As far as the network, there are quite a few networks. The main one is osuwireless which you won't be able to use. There is a guest WIFI@OSU that is pretty decent speed-wise for most of the campus. If you're over in the med center (buildings or libraries), there is ""OSUMC Guest"" which is almost as good as osuwireless (its the only one med center students and staff can use for personal use in some parts of the med center since osuwireless is replaced by a secure network over there the boring details of which I will spare you).   Also open to our guests that no one else mentioned yet is our bus system. CABS is free to the public.   Welcome to The Ohio State University!

If you're a visual person and enjoy doing hands-on tasks like building something with Legos or building a cabinet, then it's going to bring up careers that require that kind of hands-on activity.  It's also not a be-all-end-all decision maker for your career. It's simply a tool to get an idea of what kinds of jobs you could be naturally-skilled at doing. Think of it as a brainstorming partner that also has a wealth of information about each individual career you look at."
OSU,36x5q4,kellomi,1 point,Sat May 23 17:19:30 2015 UTC,"Yes, and my example shows some of the flaws in this manner of processing information. The system goes from the specific to general types back to the specific (apparently) without revisiting how the final specific relates to the original specific. This manner of using the generalized types to decide the specific careers without revisiting the specifics of the answers is a bit silly. E.g those grouped in the ""creative"" type could have a wide range of interests and abilities that are expressed in the questionnaire but compressed into a fairly meaningless 'type' by the middle step.   Hence, I should be a biologist, even though I hate it and am not particularly apt."

There are 6 traits that the quiz is identifying: Realistic, Investigative, Artistic, Social, Enterprising, Conventional    When you rated your interest in an activity, the quiz gives you a score in one of those 6 categories based on how strongly you answered. If you're naturally an investigative thinker, then, when you have it search for jobs to fit your scores, it will pair you with analyst positions, research positions, etc. that match those scores.    The results you get are a list of careers with skills that match your types of interests. The rest is up to your discretion to narrow down from there what kind of jobs fit your preferences, desired income range, desired locations, etc. and there are plenty of tools available to do so. That quiz is only one of the tools =)"

My biggest piece of advice is that your resume and work experience is a lot more important than your degree. I studied European History and minored in Archaeological Anthropology, but I took a lot of arts administration internships and now I find myself leaning most into the development department of museums. So take the classes you like and look for internships and jobs related to your career hopes and you will find a way to make them work together.  If you have any other questions I'd be glad to answer them! I haven't started at NYU yet but I did meet the program director and get to pick his brain, and I worked as the administrative intern at the Columbus Museum of Art for 9 months, so I do have some insight. :)"
OSU,36wmhk,lexarexasaurus,1 point,Fri May 22 21:17:41 2015 UTC,"I am also interested in pursuing museum studies and attended OSU for undergrad so maybe I can give you a little insight. I just graduated with a BA in Arts Management and a BA in History. The AAEP department offers the Arts Management major, and an Arts Entrepreneurship minor with potential for a museum studies focus. I really enjoyed being a part of this program, my classes were pretty easy and taught me a lot. The only downside is that it is a pretty new program- meaning that certain classes you may be interested in are not always offered. Since your interest in museums is multifaceted, I think this program would give you a broader sense of the field and help you a lot when applying for an MA program (it did for me). The department also has a lot of resources for internships and connections in the area. Here is the website if you want to learn more.   Prior to joining this program, I also considered Public History which is a combined BA/MA that sounds similar to your interests. I hope all of this helps and gives you some additional options at OSU.

Look into joining Eco Car (or some other related student project) at the involvement fair if you want to get a head start on building your resume.
OSU,36vdse,arcen1k,2,Fri May 22 21:05:53 2015 UTC,"Any student (who meets the requirements) can get into the Honors program. However, you can only be a Scholars student if you start (freshman year) in scholars. There are plenty of ways to get involved on campus. You might have to work a little harder to get to meet people, but for many that's an easy task. The best part in my opinion about some of the learning communities is that many people are taking the same classes as you are. You can always go down the hall and ask someone about that one question in you couldn't figure out on your math/chem/bio/physics homework (I reference these because I'm an engineer). Study hard, do good work and you'll get rewarded. I worked very hard my first semester, and got into engineering honors with flying colors. The program isn't nearly as social as Scholars, but it does last longer and has a couple of nice perks.  To answer your initial question directly. Not too many of the programs matter. Having Honors and/or Scholars is a nice perk on a resume, but that's probably more a function of GPA requirements. I worked hard to get a stellar GPA, and I am very proud to display that on my resume. The average first semester engineering GPA is 2.7. Other than those two programs, there isn't too much merit to being in a ton of learning communities. Get involved with something you love, pick a couple and spend a lot of time in them. Depth is better than breadth here.  As far as internships and jobs go, the learning communities won't help very much (ignoring the aforementioned exception). I don't know too much about Environmental Engineering in terms of internship difficulty. But for me (CSE), I just finished freshman year, and found it extremely difficult to find an internship. I am super lucky to do what I do now.  To be quite honest, work hard, get the kick-ass GPA. But you should get involved in some meaningful clubs/other communities. There's a great involvement fair towards the beginning of the school year. Having these as a foundation will help you build your resume to get an internship. Thus, allowing you to get more internships, eventually leading to a good job."

The biggest issue is that Dr. Williams is insane. He is just awful to work with. He likes to send emails at absurd times and expects ridiculously specific responses and if you make a single mistake he'll ask you to write a paper on why you should be able to continue with the program. His emphasis on the ""Virtual World"" results in a lot of wasted time doing absolutely useless work in Second Life instead of any meaningful project. Williams also will only pay attention to you or your project if you're one of his ""team leads"" or shamelessly brownnose. When I was there the team leads were also effectively spies, so if you complain about anything you will likely end up in his office for a lecture that ends with ""don't put this on your résumé"".

I made it past the application phase (which  consisted of filling in an excel file with weird questions like what was your high school gpa and act/sat scores) and got to the group phone interview.   During the group interview, the director of the program, who I guess was this Rob Williams guy, kept complaining about some noise in the background and how somebody's phone wasn't on silent.  He. Went. Crazy. He started screaming at everyone involved in the phone call and eventually said that if the sound didn't go away he would throw away all of our applications and not even look at them. I was so stressed that week already, I just remember hanging up the phone in the midst of his rage and BAWLING.   I can't speak for him as a boss, as I never made it that far, but if I were you I'd avoid the program and its director like the plague."

I never lived in the dorms, so I can't speak to that, but I've always lived right off campus (5-10 minute walking distance). You can be a socialite if that is what you desire. Used to just walk into parties without knowing anybody and people were often pretty welcoming (especially if you brought something with you, lol).   In your classes, you're liable to find many like minded people, regardless of who you are. It's the complete anti-high school.   TL;DR It is what you make of it."
OSU,36sutj,neobuckeye,3,Thu May 21 21:20:15 2015 UTC,"Congrats on becoming a Buckeye!  I think at first, people tend to hang out and go out with the people in their dorms. Go out with them, go to the involvement fair, go to meetings for clubs that interest you. You will find your niche and your people much more easily than you think. Just remember that everyone is in the same boat as you. There are very few people coming to college that are coming with a group of friends already established. So everyone is nice and outgoing because they want to meet people. Take advantage of that. Be friendly and outgoing and open to new experiences and you'll have a group of friends in no time."
OSU,36sutj,anGus62209,1 point,Fri May 22 02:05:26 2015 UTC,The involvement fair is definitely a great way to get involved with a group of people who share your interests. I think it's easier to build stronger friendships when you're involved with a group of people that share a common interest.

When I sat on their board, we generally hated the decision USG made with basketball.

OSU,36ssxg,Nicknam4,-3,Thu May 21 23:24:11 2015 UTC,"It was actually Student Life's decision to make a new meal plan not USG, but USG was heavily involved along with many other campus organizations. And while I understand that the new meal plan can be confusing, after I had some questions answered I'll say that it is a better meal plan then blocks and definitely better than the old swipes plan."
OSU,36ssxg,Chuck10,6,Thu May 21 22:48:07 2015 UTC,"No way, swipes were definitely better. There was no worrying about the cash value of anything. You would just walk into somewhere like Fresh, pick out an entree, 3 side dishes, and a drink. Done. One swipe. No worry about ""wasting"" money, no computing your total. And I could be wrong, but that seems like more food than you'd get with 2 blocks nowadays, and 1 swipe was a comparable cost."
OSU,36ssxg,TrueBlonde,2,Fri May 22 12:36:49 2015 UTC,"I agree that swipes are more convenient for the students, but the issues with swipes is that its not easy for students to know how what they don't know what the value of a swipe is. For example, at marketplace you could get $11 worth of food for 1 swipe or you could get $6 worth of food. Not easy for a student to know what he paid for with his meal plan."
OSU,36ssxg,Chuck10,2,Fri May 22 16:45:11 2015 UTC,"But that really didn't matter. No matter where you went, you got a full meal for 1 swipe. Who cares what the cash value of your meal was? I never once added up how much cash it would have cost me in my 2 years of being on swipes."
OSU,36ssxg,TrueBlonde,3,Fri May 22 17:05:29 2015 UTC,"I'll say that it is a better meal plan then blocks and definitely better than the old swipes plan.   How can you say that, when the new plans offer less value than the old block plans?   Take the 350 semester plan. $1,895, which got you $1,750 in blocks and $150 in cash, total of $1,900 in an ideal situation.  Compare that to the Gray 10. $1,915, which gets you 10 traditions visits each week, $300 dining dollars and $150 cash. If you solely do the $5 exchange, that's a total of $750 in dollars, totaling $1,200.   With blocks, a traditions visit was worth 2 blocks. $10. Now with the exchange, it's worth $5.  How is this a better meal plan?"
OSU,36ssxg,misteryub,1 point,Fri May 22 02:19:23 2015 UTC,"So you'll never eat at traditions? I don't think you can compare the numbers without taking that into consideration.

OSU,36ssxg,Chuck10,2,Fri May 22 16:56:02 2015 UTC,"When I had blocks, I ate at traditions maybe once or twice a week. Obviously with the new plan, they're emphasizing traditions, but it seemed that they were almost always packed, even with the lesser emphasis."

My friend was in aviation, i think he drove but there are buses to the airport. I dont know the answer to this one besides OSU is amazing because i have no comparison Favorite is gameday of course"
OSU,36p1pw,bristleypenguin,3,Thu May 21 01:23:19 2015 UTC,"What's great about Ohio State   Size: There are more events, organizations, and other opportunities, both recreational and academic, than you could ever take advantage of, and that's a good thing! You can commit as much or as little time as you want and there's never ""nothing to do"" around campus. There are dozens of student organizations on campus to get involved in and meet people with similar interests. Location: Despite being right downtown, because of its size, Ohio State is fairly insulated, with main campus itself having a TON of green space between its eastern border on High St and its western border along the Olentangy (which has a beautiful walking/bike trail along it), so it never feels like you're actually in a big city when you're walking between classes. Ohio State has a deal with the Central Ohio Transit Authority which provides students with unlimited free busing, so you never feel like you're trapped (I left my car at home as I never feel like I need it, as I can easily walk to anywhere I want on campus or ride the bus for free to anywhere in Columbus)."
OSU,36p1pw,TheI3east,2,Thu May 21 03:01:45 2015 UTC,"Uhh... do students there really believe the campus is downtown? There are COTA buses that can take you downtown (lines 7 and 2 I think), or you can walk, although it's a long walk to go anywhere south of the arena district (where you can head to see a Blue Jackets or even a Clippers game). Although I have a car, I almost never drove downtown. Parking is a big pain in the ass. Then again, I didn't live on campus, but in Harrison West, which is well south of campus (but still not downtown).  Anyway, although there are streets running through campus, it's not that bad. I don't know know what part of campus you'll be on for the most part, but the highly trafficked roads are on the border of campus (High, Neil, Woodruff, etc.) So it's better than some schools, where there are a bunch of highly trafficked streets running through the heart of campus. That said, there is constantly construction on the streets that do run through campus, which makes the campus less attractive."
OSU,36p1pw,p-adic,3,Thu May 21 12:57:14 2015 UTC,"People already said rushing will be fine for you and a second that.  Campus is about a mile and a half from ""downtown,"" and in my opinion it's a benefit that the campus is a separate area compared to an integrated campus like Pitt. It's easy to walk across, beautiful, and there's tons of shops and study spaces. If you want to go downtown, you can take a $5 cab, a COTA bus, or few minute drive.  You have a lot of different places to go and an amazing road infrastructure that makes rush hour lighter than in other cities and makes all parts of the city very accessible. You have a lot of cool parts of the city - Short North, German Village, Discovery District, Arena District, that are all worth exploring.  One of my favorite parts of OSU was Columbus itself. But as a student, I couldn't possibly pick just one thing. Football season, going out on Sunday and Wednesday nights, Buckeye Donuts, laying out on the oval, stopping in the library between classes, being a member of a sports club, swimming in the RPAC, playing intramural sports, and running into friends everywhere you go, all equally made my experience there amazing. There is just so much to be a part of and so many things and places to see."

OSU,36p1pw,littlegreenWHY,1 point,Fri May 22 01:34:21 2015 UTC,"There is somewhere to go any night of the week and lots of different types of bars. Also it's easy to make friends in my opinion, just find a club or whatever you're interested in and show up to a meeting and introduce yourself and see if you like them. I was in a club sport and that's how most people joined our group, including myself. Our group extended from freshman to 25+ and as an alumni I still went back to a few events. Even though its a crazy big school it doesn't really feel that way."
OSU,36p1pw,lexarexasaurus,5,Fri May 22 03:15:35 2015 UTC,"You will do fine rushing. There are a lot of people who make a bad name for fraternities, but I know plenty of delightful, friendly, and highly motivated students who learned a lot in the way of leadership in several frats, particularly Alpha Phi Omega, Delta Sigma Phi, and FIJI. You will have many opportunities to excel, and just as many opportunities to squander your time in debauchery. BOTH are possibilities, it's up to you to decide what you want to do!

It's not really on par with some of the larger programs like Riddle or UND in terms of average fleet age/amenities/aircraft availability and other things like that. They are working on modernizing the fleet right now,  so perhaps there are plans to improve our status.  That said, everyone's pretty close since it's a small group. There are fun things to do like flight team or Alpha Eta Rho. It's nice in that respect.   Getting back and forth to campus does suck though. It's not really far, but pretty undoable without a car. You could take the bus, but the nearest stop is like a mile or two away. Freshmen can get parking permits if they're in the aviation program though."

Edit: I am in no way saying all fraternties are filled with douchebags, but it's not some secret that most of the OSU student body thinks negatively of them.

In my social circles people typically have plenty of friends who are in Greek life but still dislike the system as a whole. When meeting someone new, finding out they're in Greek life doesn't instantly bias us against them unless they grossly exemplify the traits we dislike about Greek life, for example: an exclusionary attitude, a sense of entitlement (particularly when speaking to the opposite sex), and lack of or disrespect for individual values regarding sex, drugs, etc.  If you're a normal, cool person, people won't hate you just because you're in Greek life.

The Gateway Apartments are on campus but at the very edge. They're within walking distance of the Short North and a COTA ride away from downtown and the arena district. That might make it possible to be part of both the campus community and the 20 something young professionals. It costs way more than living off campus with a roommate but it might be worth it for the experience and convenience.

OSU,36jbal,mcrazy20,4,Tue May 19 20:28:44 2015 UTC,"My recommendations, based off of real-world experience and familiarity with some of the curriculum: Focus on the field you plan to go into. For CSE, you've got a golden opportunity to set yourself up with a good career. Try not to get too focused on the Undergrad certifications - Minors only really matter as specific field requirements and for people pursuing a career in academia (i.e. if you want to become a professor).  It's good to challenge yourself and pursue your passions, but use the first semester to see how well you handle the engineering workload before taking on more challenging things. Technical qualifications will help you out so much more in CSE than a Minor, and if you want to get into business, this is where I can offer very direct advice:  Pursue an MBA. Get a Master's degree in business. If you can earn your CSE degree, save up some money at a job, then apply to a Master's business program, you're going to be one of the most valuable employees in a tech company. The industry is desperate for people who can connect the engineering and business fields together, and it's only going to grow as the industry expands. Master's programs in business don't place much value on an Undergrad business education because they often have their own way of teaching things and prefer to equip someone who has unique skills in their own field (e.g. Computer Science and Engineering).  In the computer field, a lot of programming is actually off-shored to places like China and India, where their highest-skilled workers are contracted to churn out apps and programs for companies, who then use their own programmers to run quality control and fine-tune it all.  You'll get a chance to take philosophy courses as part of your GEs, so I'd recommend trying a few out, especially during May Session, and exploring the Minor options from there. Again, it won't likely count for much, but it gives you one more thing to put on a resume and it's something you want to do. In CSE, pick up an internship as soon as the opportunity presents itself, because that's what companies will value most. For Business, though, don't bother with a the Minor. Your efforts would be best-spent on getting your degree, getting the Philosophy Minor for fun, and then going on to a Master's program after putting in a year or two at a company in Ohio, Austin TX, or California. From there, you can enjoy a high-paying career as a valued asset at just about any company you want."
OSU,36jbal,RobStalone,3,Wed May 20 03:42:32 2015 UTC,"I'm doing something similar, I'm an ECE major with a minor in entrepreneurship and another in humanitarian engineering.   Definitely doable and I have found you can find a decent chunk of classes that cross count for gecs and technical electives. At most would set you back a semester which for engineering, ppl do 4 and a half years anyways lol."
OSU,36jbal,flash61747,2,Tue May 19 21:08:20 2015 UTC,"I have one major two minors. Just make sure you keep up with your advisors and if necessary have them correspond.

OSU,36jbal,dankmanatee,2,Tue May 19 22:43:04 2015 UTC,"Not hard, just lots of planning. I did a dual degree program...two seperate bachelors degrees. Two majors, two minors. You can't do this for duals, but for double majors/minors you can overlap GECs and certain courses between majors and minors. Talk to your counselor."
OSU,36jbal,arijen,2,Wed May 20 00:00:50 2015 UTC,"definitely. honestly, I recommend also taking up the initiative yourself and figuring it out. Sometimes advisors say you can't when if you mess around with your schedule a bit you can fit it in.   I messed around and managed to fit in almost 3 majors and a minor, obviously practically impossible to actually complete but just go find the degree requirements, set out a four year plan with major courses down first and sorta adjust where to put GECs and minor courses and try to get some overlaps down.   I did this and I've managed to come up with a nice biology/CIS double major granted it'll probably take an extra semester and a summer course or two due to not being entirely sure in the beginning. I'm committed now and it looks like it can work. but I had A LOT of AP credit and blasted through GECs my freshman and sophomore year becuase after adding prerequisite courses (ochem, genchem, math, CSE..etc) I had a lot of room to add one or two GECs to take me from like 12 credit hours to 18 a semester mostly because I couldn't take any other major courses due to my enrollment in prerequisites. Now that they're complete I can focus on the major courses.  My point being just mess around on your own a bit"
OSU,36jbal,Featherfy,1 point,Wed May 20 15:10:01 2015 UTC,"I did a double major, taking 15 credits on average per semester. I probably could've added a minor if I 100% knew what I was doing from the onset. Just communicate with your advisers and you can make anything work."
OSU,36jbal,Iyoten,1 point,Wed May 20 01:48:00 2015 UTC,"If you're interested in the three, they're doable. Though not timely, and may or may not be too worthwhile. I'm a CSE major with a General Business minor. The CSE department apparently works with the Business school to for students to get a minor in Business. They waive ~7 CSE elective credit hours to help make room for the 15 needed for a Businees minor. To do all three of them in 4 years, you'll be taking 16+ hours a semester, and depending on your luck you might have to  take a couple with 18. I'm taking just CSE and Business, will have no semester below 15 (only one semester with 15) all others are 16+ for me, and that's just one minor. Not to mention that I came in with over 20 credits.  You can always add the minor if you find that you have time. Business and CSE go very well together, personally I'd start there. If you find that you have a lot of time on your hands, you can always add another. However, if you go for Business, then you should really get an MBA, otherwise the minor doesn't mean too much. I might be sticking around for another year or two to get one, as well as an MS in CSE. There's a 5 year (undergrad + 1) MS program for engineering."

Expect it to be higher this year as the competition gets stiffer each year.  The higher GPA you have, the more likely you'll get accepted into finance.

OSU,36faa5,stormyzephyr,16,Mon May 18 22:58:09 2015 UTC,Honestly if you think your major classes are that boring you might have a bigger problem.

OSU,36faa5,bsilvereagle,2,Tue May 19 02:15:45 2015 UTC,"I agree, wholeheartedly. I have been through ME classes. Even though I was invested in the major, and interested in the courses, some of the lectures/lecturers were pretty much a drag; it seemed as if a few of the ones teaching did not want to be there at all. Essentially, it boiled down to understanding enough information to do well on the exams. Real knowledge came later, through actual practice. Of course, you always have a few who are interested. I came across only a handful, and I still remember them. I feel as if lectures are outmoded as a form of instruction."
OSU,36faa5,bsilvereagle,3,Tue May 19 02:27:49 2015 UTC,"I noticed a trend between older professors (Subramanium, Harper) not being 'as good' as younger professors (Satya, Prakash). Back in the day Subramanium was regarded as one of the best professors. I think over time he's become jaded with the system. Students not caring, class sizes ballooning, people on phones, people on laptops, no one putting effort in, etc and has thus lowered his effort which creates a pretty vicious cycle and we end up where we are today. Satya, Prakash, etc haven't become jaded (yet) so are still engaging students and make for interesting lecturers.   I have no clue how to fix this problem."
OSU,36faa5,bsilvereagle,2,Tue May 19 02:33:35 2015 UTC,"True, very true. The increase in class size leads to such blase behavior among students (some) that it gets harder for lecturers to stay motivated over the course of their careers. I feel that a large part of the problem is the rigid syllabus which does not allow for experimentation, demonstration, and as a result lacks any clear strategy for engagement with the students. All one wants to do is complete the syllabus, knock off the ABET requirements, and test students in insipid exams. Even for those brave souls who want to go against the grain, the classes are co-taught (different sections, different instructors, but have to adhere to the same syllabus, and same list of problems), which does not allow for much flexibility. Perhaps an overhaul of the ME syllabus itself, with courses properly segregated, more experiential learning included, number of topics reduced, depth of focus increased, and adequate reward/remuneration for teaching well (the department does not give a crap for people who teach well, as well as for those who do not) are perhaps some strategies for better learning, I feel.  PS: I think you meant Prasad? I have not taken any of Satya's classes."
OSU,36faa5,bsilvereagle,3,Tue May 19 02:45:01 2015 UTC,"Nope, Shaurya Prakash. He just taught a section of heat transfer. He started off really strong and the course was really good. Then as he continued to ask students questions in lecture and it became clear no one was doing the readings, he also kind of petered out and the last third of the class was pretty bad, especially compared to the first third.    and same list of problems   For some of the courses, our homework problems were the same problems assigned 20 years ago. Fun fact. (I know this is true for thermo & heat transfer, not sure about fluids).    Perhaps an overhaul of the ME syllabus itself   I think that with the quarter->semester switch, the ME department really messed up. Two quarters (20 weeks) of fluids became one semester (14 weeks). Same thing happened to thermo. We dropped an applied ECE course (about generators, etc) and picked up 2900 instead  (which to me lacks in a lot of regards).   My fix for the syllabus is to introduce half semester courses. So fluids, thermo, circuits, they all become one semester & one half semester. This was we can cover the same amount of material as we used to under quarters (quite a bit of stuff has been point blank dropped) and go into a lot more depth.   Tech electives also become half semester by default, but series would be permitted. This way you could take GD&T without taking a full blown CAD course. Or get a primer to HVAC. Or get some more heat transfer experience without dedicating a whole semester to it. The number and variety of tech electives a student gets go way up with the half semester plan.   Half semester courses also allow 'seminars' to be taught. LabVIEW seminar. MATLAB seminar. EES seminar. Technical Writing seminar. Pass-fail seven week courses that teach software/skills that employers are looking for (since that's all the rage in the department) but are completely optional.    the department does not give a crap for people who teach well, as well as for those who do not   Side note - raises are tightly coupled to SEIs. So you end up with a lot of professors who strive for the good SEI ratings and put actual learning & teaching on the back burner. But the SEIs are not indicative at all of how well a professor teaches. What they should really do is see how well Statics Professor A's students do in Dynamics compared to Professor B's students. And do this for all series courses. Then do some ANOVA analysis on departmental GPA to figure out which professors induce a higher GPA in later courses.    more experiential learning included   The key to this is reduced class size. Which is a big tangled mess. Do you reduce the number of people admitted? Increase staff size? The switch to semesters dramatically increased class size. Instead of a course being offered in 3-5 sections a year, it's being offered in 2 sections a year. If you go the reduce admitted students route, what criteria do you use? Currently, they're using GPA which is a terrible idea. In one project, a group mate couldn't figure out how to determine a gear ratio. Graduating ME. Couldn't figure out a gear ratio. But he could meet the minimum GPA requirement. It's a terrible criteria. But I'm not sure how else to let people in. Past projects? Aptitude tests? It's not an easy thing to figure out. And the fewer students admitted, the less money the department makes.    knock off the ABET requirements   Rumor on the street is that we're about to get a huge audit since the 'green sheets' that go to ABET haven't been up to par since we switched to semesters. We'll see if that happens and induces any changes.   You'd think someone would ask the students how to fix the department ;)"
OSU,36faa5,sxeQ,1 point,Tue May 19 03:03:31 2015 UTC,"One thing I never failed to understand: why aren't more professors pushing students towards doing the readings? One would not dare attend a class in cognitive psychology or the humanities or history, without doing the actual reading. In engineering, most of the times, I see people come blank as a slate, and leave with some scribbles on their mind, which for the most part remain undecipherable. So bad teaching+bad preparation (both sides)+poor student interaction = gears that are not conjugate anymore. The failure to assign or take students to task for not doing the readings, remains a huge failing. And you can blame it on class size. Here is my suggestion: I see that the department has a lecturer and several clinical faculty. Why not pay more money to them, reduce research expectations of them (they seem to be good teachers, based on SEIs and ratemyprof.), and make them teach 2 sections of 70 students each, for each course they teach, instead of one giant 140 student class? 70 I feel, is a sweet number. If you are a good teacher, you would remember most of the names in a class of 70, interaction can be enforced, and there is also lesser space to hide.  Yes, the list of class problems: don't even get me started! After a while, it became something like gaming the system to get a good grade. Learning took a backseat. If I could solve all of the list problems from Hibbeler or Collins, and regurgitate that in the exams, I could get a good grade. What is the incentive to rack my brains, and use System II thinking (see Daniel Khaneman's book: Thinking fast and slow). I really got angry with the department for forcing me to go through Hibbeler. And ppt slides during design classes. Design is an art, but it was more like a bored cat from hell.   Half semester courses would be good, but the problem would be finding people to teach the courses. Believe me, a whole lot of folks do not want to teach, and would rather just teach one course a semester, and keep their teaching awards polished, while the lower level lecturer slogs his/her butt off. Such are the rewards offered for teaching. A half-semester sounds like a great idea: introduce statics and dynamics, stop with rigid body motion, then continue with vibrations and Fourier series (frequency response); same with thermo and fluids. And it works beautifully for design. Sort of like the quarter system, but more in-depth. The more I look at the syllabus, it seems like we are becoming a technical institute, and not a place that pushes thinking to the limits. It is all about ROI and what employers are looking for. Why sell the soul of ME for some measly place on the US News Rankings? But hey, that brings in money! Lookie, oraduates are placed well.  FYI: I have it from an inside source that SEI's do not matter much  for tenure. Even for lecturers, the SEIs do not provide job security. Most of them are hired on a need-basis, and can be fired any time the COE runs out of money (which they will when they hire the next VP for Strategic Placement and Curriculum Planning). So, who takes the bad/worst teachers to task? Most of the ones who blabber in class are tenured: so, the department cannot touch them. The people who are interested in teaching are lecturers and some profs., who are new (as you said) and rather powerless. Where is the accountability?  As usual, no one ever reads the exit surveys!!"
OSU,36faa5,billydodd,1 point,Tue May 19 03:27:58 2015 UTC,"In terms of selection of students using GPA: the amount of pressure this creates in the early weed-out classes (Statics, and to some extent Dynamics) is just unbearable. The grade-grubbing, the any-way-it-takes-A work, and the random 3.2 (from 3.0) cut-off makes me feel like people in ME have run out of ideas to take in majors.   Now, potential, new method: how about a personal essay on why one wants to join ME, enforcing a potential ME major to do a co-op before applying (even a simple one, just to get a feel of the major), show hands-on expertise in building something (select from a list of hands-on projects the ME department can provide to potential pre-MEs), along with a pre-placement test in ME, which tests the fundamentals of statics, mechanics and dynamics, which will all but weed out the pretenders and allow only those serious enough to pursue ME as a career, into the program?   This pattern could easily be followed in the other programs, with the least emphasis on the placement test, and a greater emphasis on hands-on projects, personal essay and co-op."
OSU,36faa5,Syia,2,Tue May 19 13:29:23 2015 UTC,"There are a few problems with this I think.   The main issue is scaling. Let's say there are 300 applicants/semester to ME and roughly 2/3s are admitted. Let's assume it's Rosie doing this work (makes $55k/year, ~$27/hr) for cost calculations.   Personal essay: At a reading speed of ten minutes per essay, that's 50 hours to just read the essays one time through at a cost of $1350. Then there will be additional time to sort/rank/etc. Essays can also be completely falsified and completely insincere.   Co-op/Intern requirement: In order to really pull this off, the department has to have companies willing to take in 300 students/semester who the department has not vetted at all. These people may be complete duds but they are representing the ME department as a whole. Additionally, these students are only going to know whatever they learned coming out of FE. The easy solution is for the department to foot the bill and eat the cost of the students' pay. At 300 students/semester, working 400 hour co-ops, being paid $10/hour, we're at $1.2 million! Once again, only 2/3 of these people will actually be admitted the major.   Hands-on Project: I think a few things would make this successful. A machine shop for the applicants, raw materials, and mentors. All of these things cost money. And of the shops current students have access to (Bolz & Walter's shop) the machines are subpar. If we assume that the stuff in Bolz is adequate for these projects, and the department gives $100 in funding per project, we're at $30k.   Qualifier Exam: I'm not quite sure how this is really different than a GPA requirement. For the intro courses, the majority of the grade comes from exams. For the heck of it, let's assume 15 minutes/exam worth of grading time using GTAs getting paid ~$15/hr = $1,125.  It only takes 10 minutes ($5) for a computer to spit out who has made the cut when it's GPA doing the sorting.   Now. having said all of that, I wholeheartedly agree that some of these things need implemented! You can't cook good food with terrible ingredients! I just don't think the department will bite due to the costs involved. In my opinion, it would be worth the investment, but the returns won't be seen for 10-15 years. I had a groupmate saw through a 2x4 with a file because he thought that was an okay thing to do. The personal project probably would've weeded him out. I've had groupmates think that multiplying a sensor reading by 1000 to get it into 'about the right range' was an acceptable thing to do. The Qual would've weeded her out. I've been in labs and had people say ""I'm only in engineering because I knew being a girl would get me a lot of scholarship money"". Ideally an essay would've weeded her out, but it's hard to say, essays can be falsified.   I think an interview may be the sweet spot in cost & effectiveness. Let's use Siston ($122k) and Subramanium ($122k) as our interviewees. 30 minutes per student for a total cost of $123/interview & $37k overall. The first fifteen minutes of this interview would be a 'Talk to us about your portfolio, and if you don't have a portfolio, tell us why you want to be an ME'. If your GPA is terrible, this portion of the interview would be the time to explain that away and show that you have what it takes to be an engineer. Second half of this interview is a ""Here is a statics problem, how would you approach the problem"" ""Here is a dynamics problem, how would you approach it"" ""Here is a heat transfer problem that you know nothing about, where would you start, and what assumptions would you make"". Hopefully between the two interviewers and these type of questions it becomes quickly apparent who should be let in and who shouldn't. Now, say we're accepting 200 students/semester, only 100 or so of the slots should be filled by the interview I think. The remaining 100 should be filled by a combination GPA & something to give people that interview poorly a second chance. Granted, this doesn't scale well at all either. There are 150 hours of interview time, and then however long the something (maybe an essay: 33 hours) takes to complete.   We can't really clean up the curriculum, and get professors back into being excited about teaching, until we improve the quality of student coming in the department. I think that's step one."

The higher your class rank, the lower you get to sit in the stands. In my opinion, Juniors get the best seats.

OSU,36atit,wickintheair,1 point,Sun May 17 22:29:20 2015 UTC,"Incoming freshman here. (With a few questions.)  Are freshman, generally speaking, able to get tickets, or are they usually all sold out by the time they get down to the youngens? Do you have to buy full season, or can you just get tickets to a few specific games? When you buy tickets, are they for a specific seat, and if so are you allowed to trade (like if you bought tickets by yourself but want to sit/stand/cheer with your friends)?   Thanks everybody!"
OSU,36atit,greyhound30,2,Sun May 17 22:29:53 2015 UTC,You can get them as a freshman if you are there at your time. They have a certain allotment per class. Yes you can buy single games. All seats are assigned minus block o. Yes you can trade
OSU,36atit,dcviper,2,Sun May 17 22:57:09 2015 UTC,You cannot buy single game tickets at the student price.

Typically they're easy, but you need to take them regardless. As well, to not lag behind, consider taking some of the business classes at Columbus State. A good portion of said C-State classes transfer over, and you wouldn't lapse too far behind, as well they transfer over as a pass/fail, and don't affect your OSU GPA at all (correct me if I'm wrong guys)."

OSU,35y8hj,Hyperbolicflow,2,Thu May 14 15:44:54 2015 UTC,"No, you go on the testing centre website and choose a day, then go in and take the test. You're only allowed to schedule the test two weeks in advance or so, but there's never any real demand for the test so just study and once you're ready sign up for the test.  You're given an equation sheet to use, but I'd recommend going in and grabbing another sheet so you can have the list while you study. Just make sure you know stuff on the syllabus, my test had a few multiple choice with like half of the questions on fluid dynamics, followed by a bunch of longer computational type things. One was on angular momentums, one on special relativity, on one thermo, and I can't remember what else.  Basically, study with the equation sheet you'll have during the test, grab a syllabus from one of the previous 1250 classes and make sure you know what's covered, especially how to do some of the longer problems with multiple parts."
OSU,35y8hj,Hyperbolicflow,1 point,Thu May 14 15:52:11 2015 UTC,thank you! and is using the textbook enough to pass? The Serway one? I managed to get some older midterms from friends to help out a bit.   assuming you need like a C to pass?
OSU,35y8hj,Hyperbolicflow,2,Thu May 14 20:16:45 2015 UTC,"I didn't use Serway to prepare, I had an old edition of Halliday/resnick. I just went through the syllabus though and covered all the topics there, at this level of physics everything's pretty standardized so any textbook would cover everything you'd need for the test. Since you have old midterms then you should have more than enough to get prepped.  I'm actually not sure how they determine a pass/fail. I didn't hear back about my test for a few days so I emailed the physics EM credit coordinator person and he replied that I passed and the credit would show up in a few days, but specifics about how I did/what I got right or wrong I have no idea. I was actually a little nervous since I didn't completely finish the long thermo question and angular momentum question so I was a bit worried, but I got the credit in the end"
OSU,35y9fo,stormyzephyr,5,Thu May 14 14:54:13 2015 UTC,"I am a junior in in chemical engineering so hopefully I can help. When I was i high school I liked, and was good at, chemistry and math.  I didn't have a lot of knowledge about what engineering was, but people told me I should be an engineer so I signed up. I am extremely happy I did. Chemical engineering is more of a problem solving education than anything else. Once you get into your major classes, you will see the difference pretty immediately. Tests change from 55 multiple choice questions (In gen eds and intro classes) to 1 question. Normally people can get the one problem right in 15 minutes, or they still won't have it after 2 hours. Basically if you want to solve puzzles and riddles for 4 years engineering is the place for you. Another upside is all of the opportunities. If you work hard it's not too difficult to find internships or research positions your sophomore or even freshman year.  On the other side of things, the work load is intense. Most of the professors expect a lot from you if you want to keep up. For example you might be taking organic Chem II (10 hours a week outside of class), physics 2 (5 hours), separation processes (10-15 hours), and transport phenomenon (5-10hours). Now that is the amount of time you need to keep up with material and do homework, but you will also have midterms and quizzes to study for. Don't let the workload scare you off though, there will be 100 other people going through the exact same things as you, which makes its very easy to make friends. I would definitely recommend engineering if you are thinking about it! It's one of those things that is a lot easier to switch out of than to switch into.  Edit: just realized an alum asked the question, I wrote this as if a high school student was asking"
OSU,35y9fo,InterestedInThings,4,Thu May 14 15:50:56 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the in-depth comment. I also enjoyed the reduction in class-size as one proceeds into the Major. Shout-out on the expectations of the profs., and time spent in doing class-work. But it is expected, the hard grind. One thing that I sorely missed was having profs. who cared, who knew students by name: those days when my dad (who was also an alum), had such good stuff going for him. It is rare to see profs. who care. But overall, a great experience at OSU Engineering. Glad you are having a similar experience!"
OSU,35y9fo,mcrazy20,1 point,Thu May 14 17:16:39 2015 UTC,"I think when you get to the higher level courses 4000+, where there's only 20 students in a class professors tend to get to know people better. In addition, if the student makes the effort to talk to the professor at office hours or answer questions during class, it's even more likely. Some profs dgaf, but I'd say most do care."
OSU,35y9fo,Freee_Hugs,2,Thu May 14 17:36:16 2015 UTC,"True. Sadly for me my Intro. Captsone class, which I felt I would enjoy as a tight-knit group (and the overall class was not too crowded either), turned out to be a nightmare due to sheer professorial incompetence. I do agree that some profs. do go out of their way to get to know and share career-related info. Just that they are hard to come by."

OSU,35y9fo,bjs2,3,Mon May 25 18:13:01 2015 UTC,"Senior in civil engineering.  I wish that more learning could be done remotely.  As someone who is a non traditional student and living way off campus, it seems like an incredible waste of time attending classes a lot of the time.  If any CE majors took 2810, you know what I mean when I say it's a waste of my time coming back to campus for.  It was a class that I was forced to attend for attendance points where 90% of the class just buried their faces into their phones because the prof just mumbled in the mic for an hour and a half and talked through example problems with no units.  Speaking of this class, it is proof that the SEIs are not taken seriously.  Every person I've talked to that took it previous years/semesters had the exact same complaints about the class.  I'd like to see instruction move towards something like this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYSFgi39-Kk  I've learned so much more from that guy through youtube for free than for the many thousands I've given to OSU for an education.  A lot of professors are great and have a lot to offer, so it'd be nice for lectures to be recorded and refined in order to be more effective.  It helps to be able to go back and listen to something again, or to be able to pause and take notes so you don't miss the next critical part.  This also helps the professor in that they don't have to repeat themselves countless times semester after semester.  ....I guess this wasn't really civil eng specific, but it's more so my gripe with education overall."
OSU,35y9fo,chameleon_circuit,2,Thu May 14 18:05:27 2015 UTC,It fit with my natural skillset and the job opportunities are good. I'm an ISE with a Data Analytics specialization. Very happy with my decisions and optimistic about career opportunities moving forward
OSU,35y9fo,EvManiac,2,Thu May 14 17:30:15 2015 UTC,"In highschool I was really good at science (except physics) and so-so at math but I had an analytical mindset. I like biological things and also the engineer mindset so I sought to combine them.  I always wanted to research and I started at a paid medical center research lab my second year. I will never have a job where I get to design my own project and work with 3D printing.   I like my program because every major class is interesting however all the required sciences/math have been an uphill battle but I got through.   Being an engineering major has been immensely challenging but awfully rewarding. I am doing crazy cool things so much that they have become normal to me and if I told 10th grade me what I was doing now, he'd freak out. Ultimately I feel OSU's engineering program is super rewarding."

OSU,35wicf,geeklogan,14,Thu May 14 03:38:36 2015 UTC,Honesty in my experience most people use the computers in the building (for ME at least) because getting some of the programs needed  on a personal compute is a hassle and if you're in a room with other people probably working on the same thing anyway if you stay there.   It's not super critical to have a decent laptop but 8/12 GB of RAM will be more than enough to run what you need.  If you want all that for other reasons go for it but it's not necessary for your schoolwork.

OSU,35wicf,bsilvereagle,4,Fri May 15 02:30:51 2015 UTC,"Old Comment of Mine & Old Discussion  The gist of it is that you think you need a laptop, but what you really want is a dual monitor desktop with a cheap tablet. My freshmen & sophomore years my laptop never left my dorm. Unless you're proficient with LaTeX & vim, you won't be able to type notes fast enough to warrant taking it to class.   I would spend $700 building a good desktop (whatever specs you can find at that $700 point) and then get two IPS monitors to round it out. For what it's worth, a few years ago, the top tier i5 had the better cost:performance ratio but this is likely to have changed.   Then in 2 years when you have some internship/co-op money, buy whatever tablet you think you can be most productive on. That's if you even think you'll need a tablet. In all reality, you'll do all of your content creation on your desktop or one of the lab's desktops. The tablet is really to consult PDFs/do some light browsing while meeting with a team outside of a library. Heck a $200 Chromebook as /u/mcrazy20 pointed out may be better than a tablet for these purposes.   EDIT: If you're deadset on doing theoretical research, don't pay any attention to the ""12-16GB is overkill"". A friend of mine is constantly fighting his 8GB for these huge viscosity models that he likes to work on from home instead of walking to campus. But once again, having that in a desktop is going to be cheaper than 12-16GB in a laptop."
OSU,35wicf,mcrazy20,2,Thu May 14 11:18:49 2015 UTC,Exactly this. I've put quite a bit of money into a nice desktop. The specs you want are pretty expensive in a laptop. 800 into a desktop can get you a pretty killer build.

Instead of focusing on power, which you can always get from the lab computers, focus on size and battery life. If you want to sling it to class, make sure you can.  My top recommendation would be a 13"" laptop with a long > 5 hour battery life. 8gb of RAM worked for me, perfectly. You don't need any crazy i7 power at all because any software you use that needs it is licensed to the lab computers only."

Consider getting an 8gb then upgrading the RAM sticks yourself if you really want that because it's ridiculously overpriced. Though at the same time mayve 12gb is the new 8 gb and tech prices change so fast that it's the minimum you're gonna get.   If you're paying $1000 then make sure you're getting the RAM worth it. Nothing worse than an overpriced laptop with shit features.   Considering lookong at the Lenovo Y series.
OSU,35wicf,GoBucks13,1 point,Thu May 14 04:11:36 2015 UTC,"From your post, it seems like you have very little basis for why you want such extreme specs. An i7 is overkill in any machine that isn't doing some kind of visual editing or heavy number crunching; an i5 is easily powerful enough for any undergraduate project work. 8GB of RAM is also more than enough unless you are doing visual work again or running virtual machines  and 4GB is absolutely sufficient for 99.999% of your possible project work."

For engineering, could getting an iPad or Surface 3 work to take notes in class and do everything in class on something like that? I am commuting for my first year so I dont know if I want to get a laptop that can run the software and have to buy it so I can do stuff out of class or just get something to take notes and stuff like a tablet and go to a lab. Let me know what you think i should do in order to be able to do stuff out of class and still use it for notes. Also while in class are laptops used to take notes and surf the web for research and fun or are they used for the software like CAD, Matlab, etc? Thanks and I appreciate the post you made before."
OSU,35wicf,1djpain,1 point,Fri May 15 01:43:50 2015 UTC,"I have never needed to use my laptop in class. If the class is going to be doing any sort of computer stuff during class, you'll be in a computer lab. That being said, having a tiny portable laptop to pull out during class to look something up (or waste time on) can be incredibly connivent. And I can't really speak to the whole taking notes thing since I just use a normal notebook.  The fact that you are commuting does add a bit of complexity since you won't be popping over to the cheme computer lab to finish up your homework at night. So I purpose a few different options:  1) My knee jerk suggestion was to get/build a more powerful  desktop at home for $500-700 and buy a cheap tiny $200 ultra portable laptop to carry around school. This is my setup and it works really well for me (i still use lab computers a lot)  2) get a big powerful laptop that you leave at home 90% of the time and just use school computers on campus unless you are doing a group report or something.  3) if you are really on top of things just make sure you get all of your homework done before you leave campus so you don't even need a computer! :P  4) find something that is both powerful and portable (they do exist, just kinda pricey). Lenovo  and Asus had some pretty good options last time I looked.  About tiny laptops: If you do opt for a ultra portable 11"" or something, do your neck a favour and pickup an external monitor from a garage sale for $20. It's worth it.  About tablets: Personally I'm not a fan of tablets. They are overpriced and can only do half of what a cheaper laptop can do. If you are considering a tablet just get a cheapo 11"" laptop instead (Eg Asus q202e this is my laptop).  About touchscreens on laptops: Unless it folds over flat so you can write on it, it's a pointless waste of weight and battery power. Also you get terrible glare off of the glass of a  touchscreen. (Aka don't try taking it outside)  About those giant laptops with only 30min of battery: Why? There are laptops with 8+ hrs of battery life. Not being tied to the outlets is an awesome thing.  If you make a decision about want type of computer you want (big & powerful, small & cheap, small & powerful, small & cheap and  desktop)  i can toss some suggestions your way. Sorry for rambling. I do that when I get tired...   tl;dr: different things work for different people. You just need to decide what setup will work best for you."

OSU,35tpud,neobuckeye,1 point,Thu May 14 03:15:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's fair. The time definitely stacks up differently but I think that it's largely a function of the type of assignments (since there's no analogue of labs in the humanities it's hard to compare the two).

Getting tenure is no longer about just doing good work. It takes a large amount of greasing of the wheels of academic royalty (chair, senior profs.), some mind-numbing chores for esteemed colleagues, teaching several courses if you do not bring money, and withholding ones feelings from back-biting, philistine peers who are waiting for an ice-pick between their ears."

(I was a sophomore when it happened.) Someone emailed in a bomb threat saying there were explosive devices in Smith Lab, McPherson Lab, and the Thompson Library. Those buildings were evacuated, the FBI and Bomb Squad did a search, but didn't find anything. They used evidence tape or Sharpie check-marks to signify that a room had been checked and cleared.  It was around chemistry midterm time, so the running joke was that some engineering major wanted to get out of a midterm."

Your major is a part of the degree where you have gained a certain level of knowledge or expertise, but it’s not representative of your entire program of study.  By the diploma saying Bachelor of Arts, it’s a better representation of your entire body of work at OSU.  It’s up to your transcript to spell out your majors, minors, and other coursework."""

At my undergraduate, the Arts and Sciences people got latin degrees but their official degree names were just Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science (or the Latin equivalent anyways).  In Engineering, the official degree names were B.S.-M.E. (Bachelor of Science, Mechanical Engineering) or something like that so that's what appeared on the diploma.  Mine was B.S.-B.M.E.  Which did a great job of indicating that I had a BME degree but didn't indicate my minor in anthropology and wouldn't have indicated a second major (unless I went for a second degree in which case I'd get another diploma).

You are absolutely right about it depending on the professors though.  3010 will have kubilay for both sections. He's pretty boring and basically just writes equations on the board. In 3020, bibyk will make it easy but you won't learn anything.  Any other professor will make it very difficult and you will learn a ton. 3040 Is the easiest of the 3000s and you won't have too much trouble as long as you put in the time. 3050 can be pretty tough as well. If you can take Potter or el Gamal.  I would seriously reconsider taking them all at once. There's really no reason to. I'm guessing you want to figure out your specialization or something, but I don't think this is the way to go. I'd replace at least one of them with an easy ge.  I've taken a couple ges that don't even fulfill anything. They're just fun grade boosters. Good luck!"
OSU,35m06d,cloned64,1 point,Mon May 11 17:23:30 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much. ECE 3030 was not fun at all but I got a good grade. I feel as though I have a strong background in math- Linear Algebra and Diff. Eq. especially- will this help me much? At this point I don't have any GEs or Directed Electives left to take. All I need to graduate are these core classes and technical electives so there wasn't much of a choice. I could possibly take ECE 3561, but know little about this class."
OSU,35m06d,slickcannon11,2,Mon May 11 17:43:32 2015 UTC,"ECE 3561's content varies immensely based on the professor, if you get DeGroat you will get an A but she will assign a lot of HDL assignments. HDL is a coding language for designing hardware components. If you get Ozguner you will get almost no homework, no practice and a horrifying hard second midterm. I can't stand her as a professor. She is disorganized, terrible at communicating and just not helpful when I asked questions."
OSU,35m06d,hardolaf,1 point,Mon May 11 19:46:12 2015 UTC,Nice. I originally that on my schedule instead of 3020. Would this be a much better alternative than any of the other courses?
OSU,35m06d,wajeeh400,1 point,Mon May 11 20:04:51 2015 UTC,It fills an elective requirement but honestly I thought the class was a waste of time with ogzuner. The first half was a review of 2000 and I have no interest in HDL. I only took it because it is required for compE.
OSU,35m06d,mavcev,1 point,Mon May 11 20:11:04 2015 UTC,"That class sounds interesting. I'll consider dropping one of the other ones for it. It's just that I don't want to drop one just to end up with more work or a harder class. I've taken a programming class almost every semester I have been here, they always took up most of my time. I was trying to avoid it this semester."
OSU,35m06d,wajeeh400,1 point,Mon May 11 21:45:08 2015 UTC,"To be honest I don't think linear algebra and diffeq really help much. You need some of the concepts but these classes are all about learning a whole new cluster of equations and their  applications.   I guess I see why you would want to do this. If you are only taking these four I think you could pull it off if you're serious. It'll be tough though because they all demand a lot of time. Even dropping one could really help you out. Are you sure you don't have any other options? 3080, 3090, Ise 2040, or a fun elective?"
OSU,35m06d,hardolaf,1 point,Mon May 11 18:46:45 2015 UTC,"They're not all that bad to take all at once. 3040 is basically a joke, 3050 with el Gamal or Potter won't be very time consuming. 3010 and 3020 are. But if they have Bibyk, they'll be fine. I work with him and he's very good at teaching if you're willing to work outside of class. If you're not willing to work outside class, you will miss a lot of his teaching style. He pushes people to learn on their own and expand beyond the classroom. This doesn't work for everyone. As long as they don't get Valco, they should be fine for 3020. It's maybe 6 hours at most in a week. 3010 is 3010. It's just hardish."

OSU,35jv6j,watson1238,1 point,Mon May 11 02:11:46 2015 UTC,C parking space near the stadium gets full between 9-10am. Some days of the week it gets full after 10am. C parking space near AG campus is almost always open. Honestly using CABS is not bad at all. Just need to give extra time.
OSU,35jv6j,iamamystery20,1 point,Mon May 11 04:17:01 2015 UTC,"I used to own a C pass, when the parking on Cannon Drive and 10th (The Pit) allowed students there. I switched to a WC pass after the Pit was converted to all-B spots.  Getting a bus to West Campus isn't too bad. It only adds 15 minutes to the commute, and you won't have to worry about the lots being full.  If you're doing PhD work, you may be eligible for a B pass as well."
OSU,35jv6j,jt4,1 point,Mon May 11 09:49:53 2015 UTC,"If you're concerned about $$, I would just get a WC. If I teach at 12:40, I make sure to be parked on WC by 12:15, so it's not terribly convenient, but odds of finding a parking spot on campus during the day are slim."

Commuted for 2.5 years.    Don't know where you live, but taking the Lane Ave. exit off 315, right onto Fyffe and Left onto Woody Hayes is definitely the best way to go. Avoid everywhere else like the plague unless you enjoy driving in traffic. I live downtown and have gotten to campus in less than 10 minutes before taking 70E to 315 if I'm lucky with traffic.

OSU,35apm5,Milhouz,6,Sat May 9 16:42:07 2015 UTC,Exactly this. The College of Arts and Sciences already has a pretty big deficit so they will definitely be trying to make that money up from somewhere and as /u/xam2y stated out-of-state students will be the ones footing the cost.
OSU,35apm5,Milhouz,11,Fri May 8 15:35:47 2015 UTC,"doesn't seem like that much, considering 80% of the student body is in-state. So let's be generous and assume 5% increases on 20% of the student body - that's only 1% increase per year. I find it hard to believe that their costs increase that slowly.  I'd love to hear that they cut half of their high-level administrative positions or something like that. I'd be giddy.

You can expect to see more costs normally covered by the university itself show up as individual lab/class fees, like for physics and chemistry these lab fees can be a couple hundred dollars. Things like public computing facilities are from a separate set of state funds with other rules governing what allowable expenses include. This shouldn't affect the majority of traditional lecture classes, but will impact those with additional components to them."

OSU,35bkuu,WuMedic,6,Fri May 8 19:14:46 2015 UTC,"Thanks for this! I wish the University would put out posts along these lines because the whole thing seems extremely opaque.   Just some questions:   Finally, there was some discussion as to whether or not to add a surcharge to people who didn't have a meal plan who ate on campus (visitors, faculty, etc).   Doesn't the 10% Dining Dollar discount effectively add a 10% surcharge to non dining plan owners?   It was later changed to just one fixed fee for everyone   Was it discussed why unlimited meal plan users (who knowingly and willingly give up the flexibility of odd hours that drive food prices way up) are paying to subsidize these services? If an unlimited user is never able to buy food from Burritos at 2am with their meal plan, why are they paying the same overhead cost fees? I imagine since the traditions facilities deal in high volumes of food, their per-plate overhead costs are very low compared to other dining options.    We also decided to not use any sort of swipe system so that the cost of dining would be 100% transparent.   It wasn't nearly transparent until your post! (And still isn't necessarily 'transparent' in my opinion)    even if there are only 4 people who show up to eat during that hour.   Why aren't these facilities closed? If there are only 4 people that show up in an hour, the facility probably shouldn't be open at that time. I think if some dining options were ran a little bit more like a real restaurant, then the prices could go down since costs would go down. I think having traditions facilities open constantly are ultimately just going to drive costs way up.    I've never eaten under the plan  I served on a undergraduate board that dealt with this exact issue   This really bothers me, but the thought & info in this post sorta kinda makes up for it."
OSU,35bkuu,bsilvereagle,1 point,Fri May 8 22:40:41 2015 UTC,"Yes, the Dining dollar discount adds a surcharge for non-plan customers.  If I were in charge, I would abolish that--then again, maybe OSU is big enough that the marginal cost of 10% wouldn't be too big of a hit to those of us without dining plans.  I went to an university of 6000 undergraduate students (all on meal plans) and 8000 grad students.  The food had to be a lot more expensive just since we weren't buying as much of it.  We didn't have a traditions type plan where I went to school.  We talked about an off-hour surcharge but ultimately decided that adding more fees and surcharges would complicate the picture and we were going for simplicity and transparency.  The only surcharge I remember was for students on a kosher or halal plan.  They had an additional semesterly surcharge for their meal plan and got a 20% discount on kosher or halal food.  Effectively adding a 20% surcharge to anyone who didn't have that type of plan but wanted to eat something that was kosher/halal.  The problem is that closing a facility for an hour or two isn't cost effective. By opening the dining halls earlier from 8am to 6am, you'll pick up a rush crowd of people at 6 who are athletes trying to get to practice, but you might not have another wave until people scrambling to get to their 8:30 am classes.  Closing for an hour just doesn't make sense.  Similarly, after the late dinner eaters (around 8 or 9 on a friday night) you won't have a lot of people again until midnight or 1am.  Closing from 10pm to 12am doesn't make sense so you might as well just keep it open.  And I've never eaten under the plan which is exactly why I would be a terrible person to serve on any committee working on it at OSU, but I have worked on it extensively at another institution and some of the lessons we learned over there are applicable over here."

After bombing the first exam and then studying a shit ton for the midterm and final (all 3 of which make up 76% of your grade), I managed a C+. That was after he adjusted the grading scale and eliminated the lowest quizzes and recitations. I was 0.18% away from a B- and he refused to round up, so naturally I was pretty mad.

I finished my minor last year-- I took Spanish for 5 years in high school, and my dual enrollment credit let me skip a lot of the minor classes. I think they do a pretty good job of guiding you into what they expect from you in terms of speaking/writing/reading, and your difficulty curve won't be as sharp as mine was if you follow the traditional requirement track (2202 (pass SLRPE) > 3401 > 3403 > 3450 > 4000+)). By the time you hit 4000-level courses, you'll be expected to write 5+ page papers, speak in class, and listen to your lecture exclusively in Spanish. I really liked the Iberian electives; check out 4567H with Romero if you're interested in Spain. My grades were pretty good by even my standards considering how terrible my Spanish was. If you put in the time to get the basics down and build from there, I think you'll be fine. Good luck!  Feel free to PM me if you have any other questions."

I think you can feel confident coming in with a $20/hr initial rate.  That said it is always better to have the other person say a number first, and then you can negotiate it up as you see fit."
OSU,35b6ie,thelonelyward3,3,Fri May 8 17:20:39 2015 UTC,"Don't wait on doing projects. If your not very experienced in programming they can take you a little while sometimes. Make sure you read questions very carefully on Exams. They love to try and stump you. I don't advise on skipping class because when I was presented the material and then able to ask questions this made understanding the material much easier. Also when you do labs, save the code and send it to yourself so you can study them for exams. They won't ask many questions on the exercises from labs but the concepts are very useful to understand. It also doesn't hurt to look ahead at the labs that way you are prepared and not rushing at the end.  One more thing i did that i found very useful. Whenever we were given a method to write in labs or for homework, whether it was with XMLTree, NaturalNumber, Recursion, Instance Methods, Queue... the list goes on. Save these methods in a folder in eclipse each within there own class that way you have all the methods organized in one place. These will be extremely useful when you go to study for exams. Especially Exam #2(lots of recursion). Oh yes and when you do learn recursion don't let it make you feel like you're doing bad in the class or something if you don't get it the first time around. It took me a lot of practicing to figure it out but after a while it all made sense to me."
OSU,35b6ie,wch94,2,Fri May 8 20:36:26 2015 UTC,"i personally thought the lecture was a waste...well more so in 2231 than 2221.   but definitely go mostly cuz it's mandatory.   honestly...I got a B in this course, but I should have done better. the tests really aren't that hard but I got a 73 and a 96 on midterm 1 and midterm 2, respectively, and then got a 75 on the final...and it's annoying when you think you are while you're taking them then see your stupid mistakes on MC and the programming parts.   idk how to recommend you read the notes because sometimes the MC they ask are like one line on one slide of an enormous 60 slide PPT. I spent so much time reading and thoroughly understanding the ppt slides and often midterms were over about 17 lectures...and sometimes questions were over maybe 5 lectures. I was so flipping irritated because that time was badly spent.   DEFINITELY rewrite code by hand. Often they will tell you the more important methods you write in lab or projects. i highly recommend you take a good amt of time doing the HW as annoying as they may be. if you write down BS code for the HW make sure you get back to writing the correct code down and then rewriting this for practice. those are what midterm questions are on.   if it's your only class maybe you can get away with spending more time reading and even taking notes from the ppts so you can get those really small details that they will trick you with on multiple choice (which can be 2-4pts each depending on the test)  there's just a lot of material and they love picking either 6 questions on main lectures or 6 tiny miniscule questions on a line from a bubble on a slide.   hang out on the CSE site and if you want to get a headstart, download and look at some of the notes. not a bad idea  definitely don't lose points on hw on projects. those will save you."

Just stick it out, do the homework, go to class, and always give yourself like a night or two to study for an exam. I always study for exams by doing the practice problems and homeworks again. I gave up on reading the book a long time ago, but if your professor likes to ask conceptual questions just run through the lectures and understand the concepts, and if you have time read the book. Engineering is hard but not impossible, just make use of all of your resources."

OSU,34y0ji,bsilvereagle,9,Tue May 5 17:07:10 2015 UTC,"Because of the reduced timeframe, the VA considers the 8 credits for the summer term to be full-time.

OSU,34y0ji,JETPUNCH,5,Tue May 5 16:29:45 2015 UTC,"Remember there's only 11 weeks of class over the summer, so assuming those are all full-summer classes it will feel like 18*(15/11) =roughly 24.5 credits.

OSU,34uwp2,mkg1906215,3,Tue May 5 16:45:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm wondering that too. I would bet they will keep the cost of traditions visits at $10 with cash/ dinning dollars and breakfast (at $5?) the same. Since they are already trying to get more students to eat there, they probably shouldn't take these options away. I don't go to traditions for breakfast, but that is another thing to factor in if it currently costs less than lunch/dinner. If you think about it, now, going to dinner costs $10 while breakfast is $5. That means if you use up all your visits on breakfast, your not necessarily getting the biggest bang for the buck with your ""tradition visits"" next semester. Its kind of weird to think about, but just goes to show you they can make an even greater margin of profit off us. Though honestly that doesn't matter, as long as the food that is there during the time you go fits your taste and fills you up :P"
OSU,34uwp2,insanejaym,5,Mon May 4 21:20:42 2015 UTC,"If you pay without a meal plan, it's actually more than $5 for breakfast or $10 for brunch/lunch/dinner.  I think it costs around $6.50 + tax for breakfast.  The $5/$10 price points are for meal plans only.  I may be wrong on this, but you could ask a manager at one of the Traditions dining places."
OSU,34uwp2,TrueBlonde,4,Mon May 4 22:17:38 2015 UTC,"I cashier at traditions. Dinner is ~$12.63 with tax, but only 10 for those using blocks. So breakfast would also cost a bit more."

As of last year (when I was talking to my advisor about this sort of thing), only the first one would appear in your GPA, and the second one would not, although one would still need to pass the second time around for credit.  Maybe it's different for CSE/engineering?  Or maybe they changed this university-wide?"
OSU,34xamk,freedogg22,4,Tue May 5 14:43:40 2015 UTC,"You misunderstood your advisor then. The only way that it isn't factored into your GPA is with freshman forgiveness, otherwise everyone would have great GPA's from retaking classes.

OSU,34xamk,Kronusx12,1 point,Tue May 5 14:56:12 2015 UTC,"Allow me to clarify: let's say you were a sophomore that got a D in class required for your major.  Obviously, you would need to retake the class, and freshman forgiveness would not apply.  My understanding was that (prior to this year, at least), you would retake the course.  The grade from the new course would not be factored into your GPA.  The grade from the old course would still be factored into your GPA.  So no, not everyone would have great GPA's from retaking classes.  With that said, it appears that this previous rule no longer exists, so it doesn't really matter."

OSU,34xamk,jxnpope12,1 point,Tue May 5 15:56:27 2015 UTC,"For most CSE classes, you need a C- or above to move on to the next class, and you need to pass the final exam to pass the course. You can get an B in the class, but you'd have to retake it anyway if you failed its final."
OSU,34xamk,Kayvanian,1 point,Wed May 6 05:59:59 2015 UTC,"That applies to the software sequence only, iirc. I'm a CSE senior and did horrid in systems I, but that didn't affect my being able to get into systems II.   Also, I was in the same boat as OP with the software 2 final, and they curved the final exam grades before seeing if you were above 60. I believe I wound up with a 57 on my final before a curve, which was around the average for the final, and I passed the class with a C."

At this point in the year, there is pretty much no housing left off campus. You're going to have to sublease, which is why you need to join that network on Facebook. There is a Housing and Free & For Sale page on there where many people are looking for subleasers and where you can post saying that you would like to sublease.  As far as off campus housing goes, the closer you are to High Street, the better. Summit is pretty much the line between nice housing and having your car broken into every week. The farther from Summit you are, the better. Especially as you go farther north.   South campus housing is located near the gateway, most of the major off campus bars, and most of the major off campus eateries.   IF YOU HAVE MICHIGAN PLATES, YOUR CAR BETTER BE INSURED. I have never had a serious problem, but I am always sure to park my car in a way that limits the view of my license plate, and never on the street. I have had to defend my car during block parties, so be careful where you park it.   MSU and OSU are both pretty big schools, so the social and academic environment should be pretty similar. The main difference here is that you can pretty much walk to anything. I know a lot of my friends at MSU say they have to take cabs to bars. That isn't the case here.   If you have t-shirts that identify you as being from Michigan, try not to wear them. You will get dirty looks while walking to class, and threatened if you go out to bars wearing them.

OSU,34qvgi,FootyCobra11,14,Sun May 3 19:42:55 2015 UTC,"I think the problem is the lack of transparency.  At my undergrad place, everyone had to buy a meal plan regardless of whether you lived on campus or not.  But because of the pricing and the fact that everything was a declining balance, we knew exactly what we were paying for:  For example: An off-campus/commuter plan cost $500 for 250 points The lowest on-campus plan cost $3000 for 2500 points The next one cost $4000 for 3200 points (numbers are made up)  So it's easy to see that as an off campus student, you are paying $250 for overhead and getting $250 in points.  As a residential student, you're probably eating on campus twice as often so you're paying $500 towards overhead and getting 2500 in points.  If you buy more points, you pay more in overhead because you're probably using the dining facilities more.  We had ""traditions"" like dining that cost a fixed amount of points per meal, or you could order stuff off of the menu at other locations and be charged points.  Everyone thought the prices were outrageous, especially the overhead, but any college is going to be like that.  College students keep weird hours and want convenience--so in order to account for that, there's going to be more overhead.  You can't just raise the price of everything to reflect that overhead because then non-students wouldn't ever stop by to eat (as a med student, I would not stop by market place if they just inflated the price of everything by 30% to account for additional overhead) and it's important to keep these non-plan customers happy.  After all, you know exactly how much revenue you will get from your plan students, so anything on top of that is all extra.  It's the same thing at OSU.  They need to cover their overhead so they have these plans.  I don't understand a lot about blocks this past year, but from what I do understand, they basically said you have to buy in $5 increments or else you lose what you do not use.  They probably figured that on average, students would get $4.50 (made up number) for each $5 block which means $.50 would go towards overhead.  But only they know what that $4.50 number is that they calculated.  And that's where transparency comes in.  They are trying to hide the overhead costs by making these complex plans, but either way, they are making about the same amount of money.  I'm just guessing that the powers that be are afraid of what people are going to say when they realize how much overhead costs and doesn't want to deal with that fallout.  But I think that if it was well explained to students, the students would understand.  At my college, we ended up having a referendum of sorts on the meal plans and we looked at going with cheaper plans with reduced hours/locations.  In the end, the students actually got the student government to lobby for the expansion of hours to almost 24 hour dining once they saw how little additional overhead it would cost each student."
OSU,34qvgi,WuMedic,3,Sun May 3 22:41:41 2015 UTC,"Exactly. They are fronting overhead costs off the students to make more money. To apply everything you have just said to the current meal plan:  Currently, I chose access 7. According to dining services this is worth $1,295 dollars. It includes the following: 7 visits to traditions per week, $300 of campus cash, and $75 buckID dollars.   Assuming I visit Traditions 3 times out of 7 per week, including the 5 dollar face devalue for the rest of the cash, this part of the plan alone is (3/7)(10 dollars)(7 visits per week)(15 weeks)= $450 + (4/7)(5 dollars)(7 per week)(15)= $300 dollars  The net worth of the plan is $300 (campus cash) + $75 (BuckID Cash) + $450 (What traditions is worth to me) + $300 (My De-valued Traditions Dollars) = $1,125.  As you can see, according to my meal eating habits, they are already most likely going to make $170 off me (without doing anything but eating with the entirely of the meal plan!). I will note, that according to these calculations, you will use up the plans worth if you eat at traditions more. HOWEVER, not every student likes eating at traditions locations.  These meal plans are a step in the right direction in the sense that ""blocks"" are gone. You are no longer required (or feel pressured) to buy access items that you don't need to fill up the $5 increment. These tradition dollars also role over to future semesters (assuming you have any left). Also, I want to point out that obviously the campus cannot simply give everyone buckID cash as their meal plan, as they would lose money to high street. Tradition visits and campus cash is a way to direct purchasing power.   Unfortunately (this is where they become greedy), all of the current plans require students to visit certain tradition locations certain amount of times per week, or face a huge penally (-$5). Also, these tradition visits must be used up each week, or the students lose that visit/ 5 dollar deface campus cash. These things put extra constraints on students and their eating habits. Not to mention, the university probably makes the most money off of traditions locations. Personally speaking, I doubt I ever eat $10 dollars worth of food there whenever I go (I know everyone is different, however). Thus, by directling students to the locations in which they make the most profit, while penalizing them for others, they are able to make an even greater net profit.  It's all about overhead costs like /u/WuMedic said. I would love to see the day when they just incorporate these directly into prices, but it will never happen, as off campus people would never eat at the dining locations. It would show the students directly just how much they are being ripped off, but of course the university would never just show them that, as an outcry would ensue.  Ending note: This is with the fact that they already make money off of the food they sell you at these locations. They DO make money off the $5.00 burger you buy at Sloopies... All of this is just icing on the cake for them."

OSU,34qvgi,Leikela4,1 point,Tue May 5 19:59:03 2015 UTC,Haha no problem! The more familiar term is Dining Dollars. I called it something different on accident. What it is is money that you can only use on campus dining locations. So you can spend it at places like Woodys and Sloopys in lieu of real money. However it does not work on high street vendors or anywhere off campus. They replace blocks in a sense. Hope that helps!
OSU,34qvgi,Musty_Elbows,12,Tue May 5 20:28:19 2015 UTC,"Back in my day, we called 'em ""swipes."" ""One swipe for a longbread of meat!"" we'd say. And we had a longbread place that was open at night!

OSU,34qvgi,BSantry,10,Sun May 3 20:44:16 2015 UTC,Ok so essentially right now we have these blocks worth $5. Most dining places on campus are set up so you guy what you want. A panini at the Union is $6 and you can buy $4 worth of stuff to spend 2 blocks. Traditions are like the cafeterias in high schools. You go in and spend 2 blocks (right now) and you can eat whatever you want inside. The food is alright but a lot of other places have better food. Plus traditions don't have as many choices.
OSU,34qvgi,ownageboard,-7,Sun May 3 20:50:21 2015 UTC,Aren't you listening?  They are making everything awful!
OSU,34qvgi,smartfbrankings,3,Sun May 3 20:49:08 2015 UTC,"Imagine you trade in one of your visits to traditions for $5 in dining dollars. Now, compare that with the price of a cold ham and cheese sandwich from Thompson that costs you $6. You're trading in an all you can eat buffet (that's not that great) for less than a single sandwich if you choose to buy one of those sandwiches."
OSU,34qvgi,CLE4life,3,Mon May 4 02:39:53 2015 UTC,"I also live off campus but I believe it currently works like this:  You buy a certain number of ""blocks"" per semester. Going to a traditions cafeteria costs 2 blocks. You can also buy things a la carte at other dining locations; for each block you spend you get up to $5 of food.  Under the new plan, the unit of currency is ""visits to Traditions."" You get a fixed number of these per week and they do not roll over. However, if you spend one of these units at a cafe/store, you still only get $5. This is the equivalent to if blocks were turned into being worth $2.50 at a la carte places. Plus, you lose flexibility because you have to use them all each week or lose them. I think someone also did the math and found out that overall the value of the meal plans went down quite a bit."

OSU,34qgt2,Kayvanian,37,Sun May 3 22:04:57 2015 UTC,Tearing up the sidewalk between Scott and Smith. It was perfectly fine sidewalk and it appears that they are just replacing it to make space for possibly 1 or 2 parking spaces.   The new meal plans. I'm sure a lot of time and money was spent on that only to get plans that are worse than the current ones in almost every aspect.  The lights they put up in the new CBEC. They look cool but don't really add to much to the building.
OSU,34qgt2,steve_jahbs,31,Sun May 3 17:48:00 2015 UTC,So CBEC lights are the required art installation for any publicly funded building. Ohio law requires publicly funded buildings to appropriate a percentage of the total cost to an art installation. I think the glass structure by Jennings is the worst version of this.

OSU,34qgt2,steve_jahbs,8,Sun May 3 18:00:03 2015 UTC,"This. Not only did they replace every practically brand new set of dumbells, fixed weight bars, and EZ bars at the RPAC, but the new fixed weight and EZ bar weights go up in increments of 10lbs instead of 5lbs. The single biggest waste of money I have seen all year here, just to get a block O on the side of the weight. I honestly do not know why people have not made a bigger deal of this."

OSU,34qgt2,Jatholomew,5,Mon May 4 22:08:09 2015 UTC,The reason they aren't round is so they don't roll around when placed on the ground. I also talked to a rep at the RPAC who says that they donated all of the old weights so at least they went to good use
OSU,34qgt2,Kayvanian,2,Thu May 7 12:16:54 2015 UTC,"Curious, what's better about round vs. non-round weights?"
OSU,34qgt2,BuckeyesAreNuts,5,Mon May 4 00:22:12 2015 UTC,"I like the round weights better for deadlifts.  If you are using polygon weights, when you put the barbell back on the ground, if the weight lands on a corner it will move forward or backward to come to rest of the flat edge of the weight.  If you are deadlifting 400+ lbs, that is a lot of weight to roll back onto your shins."
OSU,34qgt2,Kayvanian,3,Mon May 4 00:24:51 2015 UTC,"Gotcha, makes sense! Thanks."
OSU,34qgt2,MackMizzo,2,Mon May 4 01:38:29 2015 UTC,"I'd actually say the octogonal design is better. It prevents rolling. He's right about fat handles though, they're annoying.  And the new benches they put in at the RPAC (while the old ones were perfectly fine) are too high and uncomfortable. I'm a tall man and even I have trouble touching the ground doing seated press, I feel badly for those shorter. Just so that they could have ""red"" benches I guess.  I can only imagine some designer walking into the RPAC and thinking about ways to make everything prettier and more aesthetic without giving a second thought to functionality."
OSU,34qgt2,nanoelite,7,Mon May 4 01:57:46 2015 UTC,"The problem is that since they aren't round, they won't settle evenly when placed on the ground.

OSU,34qgt2,_dick_sweat_,21,Mon May 4 11:27:23 2015 UTC,"Kind of right. But it's not a waste of money. Not only was the lake leaking, but it was designed to flow into the city sewer so it consumed 50,0000 gallons of water a day (that's a lot of water). So they looked into using a well to fill the lake instead which will cost the university upfront but will more than make up the difference over time as less water will be consumed.  So it's not a waste of the university's money unless the other option of eliminating the lake entirely is an option under consideration (but then there wouldn't be a jump, alumni wouldn't be happy, etc) which would be just a PR nightmare for the university."

The entire administration has been extremely shady regarding the Glaros Report ever since. They released the report to the media last summer and they released the names of some of the students involved in the Title IX investigation to the public, leading to these students being sexually harassed. They've made no attempt to fix this situation and due to the way they've treated their students and faculty they can't even find someone willing to take the job of Director of the OSU Marching Band."

OSU,34qgt2,hardolaf,1 point,Mon May 4 00:30:19 2015 UTC,"Title IX didn't make the decision to fire him (or release the report). That was decided by the officer of the university's president. Title IX recommended corrective action on the culture of the band by working with Waters to push the changes. Two weeks after that agreement was reached, an administrator of Student Life met with Waters and told him he could resign or be fired the next morning.

Most of the dorms on south campus (park stradley, smith steeb etc) are open and very social. Morrill tower is on west campus (far from most things but the RPAC) but people are social and it isn't all that bad if you make friends on your floor or in your room. North campus dorms are old and there are a lot of international students (just in general they get put in those dorms) so they may not be for you (Jones tower, drackett and archer come to mind)."

Now if you are a sophomore personally,I would recommend living at The Residence on Tenth. Very nice dorm.  You share a suite with five other people for a total of six. Two people to each room with a common room in the suites.  Shower, toilet and three sinks are also included with the dorm. As a transfer student myself, living at The Residence on Tenth a.k.a ""Res"" was a great choice. Hope this helps and if you have any questions I can help you out"

I lived in Morrill Tower my first two years and while it had its ups and downs, I would definitely suggest living on campus your first year just because it will make your life easier and it will make meeting people easier. I have since moved off campus and love it but thats just me. I would suggest living on south campus (park stradley or one of the new dorms like it) if you want nice rooms and social people. If you are ok with older dorms and like the quieter environment, north campus is a better option (Jones or Drackett towers being the big ones though I think Drackett is being closed next  year and they are opening up the new dorms).  At this point, if you are looking for off-campus housing for next year, you'll have a hard time finding affordable options but there will definitely still be people looking for roommates up until the weeks school starts.

For whatever reason, there's generally a major bias against it.  Second, look around. If you have no idea of which fraternities might suit you best, go to multiple fraternities' recruitment events and feel out which guys you connect with most. I'm personally in a bigger fraternity on campus, so I don't know how scouting the smaller ones would go.  As for the experience of it all, joining a fraternity has been one of (if not the) most influential parts of my time at college. I've met some of my best friends who I know would be there at a moment's notice (and have been), and that really gives you a great support system for both your undergrad career and post-grad.   In the session you have to go to before receiving a bid, they tell you that Greek Life at OSU tries to consolidate everything a ""full college experience"" entails into one area (being Greek Life). That includes academics, a social life, and just in general growing as a person. And I'd say they weren't anywhere near off-the-mark -- most Greeks are heavily involved in everything else, but Greek Life alone provides enough involvement for anybody.  So.. yeah. Would recommend."

Don't let the stereotypes of frats steer you away from them. Ohio State is a large enough school and with 30+ fraternities you'll be able to find a chapter that fits your niche, whatever that may be. Check out as many as you possibly can, but since you can't check out all of them due to the sheer amount of fraternities narrow your search down to maybe 10 or so. For a lot of them, you'll know if they are a good fit or not for you within the first 30 minutes there. If you told us a bit more about yourself/what you are looking for I'm sure you would receive plenty of helpful advice to point you in the right direction.

OSU,34qyhu,Rumpelblumpkins,3,Mon May 4 05:53:02 2015 UTC,"Rush events will be somewhat awkward at first (what icebreaker events aren't); you have similar 5 minute conversations with whoever you walk up to. It's a bit easier if you already have a friend in it, but not required. Usually you find someone who lives near you or shares the same major.   The real fun starts when you do things a bit more informally: joining one of the intramural teams, going out to eat with people, or just hanging around at the house. Eventually rush ends and you get your bid and begin the pledging process, where you meet a bunch of kids you will call your pledge brothers who are also kinda shy or whatever. Start hanging out with them, even if its something like volleyball or going to a dining hall or studying. More contact creates stronger bonds, although the pledging activities also help if you take a step back and understand why you are doing what you are doing.   I jumped into it and didn't know much about it at all; I just kinda went along with everything. It wasn't until near the end of pledging where even looking back at the first weeks felt significant.  Now, I can send a message in the group chat and hang out with people, study, go out, whatever. It's not limited to your pledge class either, everyone is willing to hang out and age or class rank isn't much of a barrier. It helps to go to social events even if you aren't much of a drinker, there are plenty of people like that and it's fine, but events where most people are going to be there also helps build connections.   The biggest thing to look for at rush events are brothers who are willing to approach you and converse rather than you go to them to initiate a conversation. It shows a fraternity that values its new members, even if they are just checking it out."

OSU,34qraj,lergx574,31,Sun May 3 19:06:42 2015 UTC,"Very few people outside of Ohio will have heard of Denison, Kenyon, Hiram, Mount Union, Baldwin Wallace, Wooster, etc.  Everybody knows about Ohio State and we have alumni literally everywhere, so I'd say it'll help you more than a high GPA from a lesser known school."
OSU,34qraj,wheres_walto,12,Sun May 3 19:25:12 2015 UTC,"Can confirm, I'm an out of state student and the only one of those I've ever heard of is Mount Union because of their football"
OSU,34qraj,buckeyes75,4,Sun May 3 19:34:52 2015 UTC,"Similarly, the only reason I've heard of Kenyon is because I have two cousins who went to school there.  But everyone knows OSU, and unless you're applying for jobs in Michigan, they'll probably think good things about the degree."
OSU,34qraj,PrincessAnika,1 point,Sun May 3 19:37:21 2015 UTC,"I transferred from Baldwin Wallace pretty much for this reason. I asked all of my professors at BW honestly, which school will better get me into the graduate programs I'm interested in? Virtually all of them said OSU because the name carries further.  Alternatively, any school worth half its lick in neuroscience would presumably know that BW has the #1 internationally ranked neuroscience undergrad program, so it was a bit of a gamble leaving there."
OSU,34qraj,liaseraph,22,Mon May 4 08:32:18 2015 UTC,"Ohio State is a nationally and internationally recognized name. Most people can respect that the coursework is more rigorous than some small unheard of school.  Another thing that OSU adds but isn't reflected in a transcript or resume are soft skills, arguably even more important than some of the formal education you received. I can see it exemplified in some of my coworkers who went to smaller schools. They lack the ability to function well in teams or interact with people they don't know well. You don't realize it, but while at OSU, you work with hundreds of people in your classes and you learn how to work with different learning/work styles and how to interact with people you aren't familiar with; whereas someone who went to a small school had classes with the same 25-50 people and never really got pushed out of their comfort zone. Ohio State grads in my opinion are much more resilient than someone who never got that experience where they were forced to adapt to a new environment with new people on a regular basis.  EDIT: Grammar"
OSU,34qraj,The64only,3,Sun May 3 20:10:55 2015 UTC,"Another skill you gain from OSU: navigating huge bureaucracies. Have you ever had to get your advisor to count an elective, or the financial aid office to lift a hold on your account? Self-advocacy and organization are real skills you learn here."
OSU,34qraj,wickintheair,4,Mon May 4 01:54:40 2015 UTC,"Most people can respect that the coursework is more rigorous than some small unheard of school.   disagree. on the east and west coasts, plenty of people would view a 'liberal arts school' as more prestigious and rigorous than a giant school like OSU, which is best known for its sports teams.  not saying anything bad about the university or its reputation, just giving a counter-opinion   I went to an extremely prestigious and rigorous undergrad and was rejected from lots of jobs with a B+ GPA. GPA cutoffs in my mind are stupid but they are real"
OSU,34qraj,buddhasuncle,2,Sun May 3 21:16:52 2015 UTC,"Good (but kind of depressing) point to consider… I suppose it depends on where you end up applying to.  I'll most likely be in the same boat as you gpa-wise.  I did just accept a research position, so I'm hoping that gives me a little edge.  Thanks for the input!"
OSU,34qraj,BrosenkranzKeef,2,Sun May 3 23:53:17 2015 UTC,"yeah. if you have experience, that's most important. GPA will matter for the first few years out... after that, it's all about experience and capability. in the long run, OSU or another 'name brand' school will help (when you're networking 20 years from now).  but straight out of college can be brutal."

OSU,34qraj,RKilbane20,6,Sun May 3 21:24:26 2015 UTC,You decide
OSU,34qraj,smartfbrankings,6,Sun May 3 19:17:47 2015 UTC,"Yes, the name stands out nationally and even internationally, mostly just because it's a big, famous school with tons of alumni. The name probably stands out more than your GPA on a resume. Hell, the typeface you use on your resume stands out more than the school's name (run it past a graphic design buddy to make it pretty).  But it's still a state school like pretty much all the other large schools. While the school can afford to provide students with tons of resources, the quality of education is still very dependent on the student themselves. There are certainly areas of study that are notable for their thoroughness (aviation being one of them, at least compared to my previous experience) but this is to be expected at any school similar to OSU.  So yeah, an OSU degree stands out because of the school's size, not necessarily its excellence. This ain't Harvard. Then again, the people at Harvard could've gone somewhere else way cheaper and got basically the same education at a school with way more alumni in the field...like OSU."
OSU,34qraj,cmented,5,Mon May 4 01:56:58 2015 UTC,"A slightly different perspective.  An alumni here with no small bit of experience recruiting. (mostly engineering).  It depends on what schools you are being compared to. Compared to other Ohio schools, sure it will stand out. Compared to other regional State colleges, not bad.  But if I'm recruiting top tier (MIT, Carnegie Mellon, Northwestern, Purdue (again for engineering)) not so much.   But a very positive side effect is the sheer number of OSU and other Big 10 alums you will run into.  Even a hiring manager from the state up north will show you some respect."
OSU,34qraj,Licz,4,Mon May 4 12:47:18 2015 UTC,Got to hear from one of the Vice Presidents from ESPN. He said if he had two identical resumes with one from OSU and one from Kent State he was going to go with OSU just because it's OSU.
OSU,34qraj,BuckeyeDan,2,Sun May 3 20:22:52 2015 UTC,Awesome.  I guess my decision to transfer from Kent to OSU after freshman year was a good call then!

OSU,34qraj,bsilvereagle,4,Mon May 4 00:52:39 2015 UTC,"A degree is a degree, as long as it's accredited, if you're worried about your GPA leave it off your resume. Besides, realistically your GPA might only come into consideration during your first job hunt, if you don't have any work experience or applying to grad school other than that it's completely over blown"

Meanwhile, they got rid of Jon Waters and Gordon Gee, both against significant student resistance. It's frustrating because I feel like the student voice is completely ignored when it's inconvenient for them.  That being said, I do owe a lot to Ohio State. I have a lot of love for the College of Engineering, especially the FEH program and the CSE department. There are some amazing people here, and the size of the school does allow many amazing opportunities, like FEH's robot project, the ACCAD motion capture lab, the hackathon & make-athon, and more.

COTA (thankfully free for students) is very limited besides the OSU-downtown corridor, and a city of this size really should be running real overnight and weekend buses. We also have the distinction of being the largest city in the US without trains, so if you're leaving the city its either by Greyhound/Megabus or by plane. This is something that has been improving every year, but my freshman year the only way to travel Cleveland-Columbus was by Greyhound - and Greyhound knew this, so they charged like $35 each way.

This is really apparent in the intro courses, but I've found as I progress a class size is usually 30-40.  There's also the frat/""party bro"" season that I personally am not a fan of, but that's going to be at any major state college you might attend.  Also, if spending two years on campus and paying all the dorm fees doesn't appeal to you, you should definitely find a work around, or perhaps look somewhere else.

OSU,34ohec,Gnilres,15,Sun May 3 01:40:31 2015 UTC,"First step is to not panic. Assess your situation and look at all of your options. Consider visiting your advisor, look at freshman forgiveness, and be ready to transfer to Columbus State if needed. There is no shame in doing poorly. At some point, it happens to everyone. Have a plan on how to proceed and a backup if that fails. You'll get through it."

OSU,34ohec,Gone-Postal-Narwhal,3,Sun May 3 01:49:29 2015 UTC,It looks like I'll be at around a 1.8 cumulative. Is a successful transfer likely?
OSU,34ohec,f1sh_,16,Sun May 3 01:57:28 2015 UTC,Consider finishing you AA at Cstate. If you do well there apply back to OSU and write a strong essay throughly explaining why you did so terrible and explaining why you will succeed now. No BS anymore this is your life path on the line.
OSU,34ohec,GoBucks13,3,Sun May 3 02:10:44 2015 UTC,"I don't think you'll be admitted to c state with a 1.8. I think the minimum is a 2. You should hit a community college for a few years since it looks like you failed quite a few courses you'll probably have to retake a lot, and a cc would be way cheaper and, not to sound like a douche, but help you learn how to manage your time and resources better without spending university level tuition.  I had a bad year here and it's a massive uphill battle. Did kind of the same thing. Bad year, went to Cleveland state and smashed a 3.8 32 credit year which was great but when I got back here my GPA was still a 2.5. It's not easy getting back to the 3 range and took me quite a while of buckling down hardcore. My recommendation is if you hit a cc then transfer to csu, I'd just stay there honestly. College is college. Im an engineering student graduating from osu with a 3.0 barely when could be graduating for csu woth a 3.8. Ive wondered for a very long time if coming back here was the better decision at all just to graduate from osu. Also, look into freshmen forgiveness.  Best of luck.  Edit: I thought you were referring to Cleveland state when you said c state. Disregard most of that."

During this year, we had 3 months of ""maintenance"" which caused our internet to completely shutoff from 9pm to 3am every night. Our router has been replaced three times. We pay for 15Mb, but that varies wildly week to week. One week, we have no trouble, another week, we are getting a steady 2Mb. Streaming sports and playing online games is out of the question when we can barely get Carmen to load during these periods. Our service has been so bad this year that we threatened our bill down to $20/month from $80/month and have gotten 2 months free.   I know a lot of people say that so-so cable company is great at home. That doesn't mean it will be great here in Columbus. My parents have had WOW for the last 8 years and have never had a problem. I have had nothing but problems with them in the past year."
OSU,34kk4g,steve_jahbs,4,Sat May 2 14:21:42 2015 UTC,"Have to agree here, ive had wow the last couple years because my landlord bundles it in to the rent. Its meh on a lot of occasions, gone through a couple routers and our cable has channels go out all the time. Havent been a big fan of their customer service as every time we try they show up way later than they said and still didnt fix anything, so just stopped trying to get then to come out.   One of my roomates last year said that his mom had wow back home and loved it, but ours sucked. One of my uncles also has wow in a different area and hasnt had any issues. Always check out other people with that provider in your area"

One thing you can maybe do is show the e-mails that demonstrate that you really were trying to learn the idea of the code, not outright copying. Don't try to play it off like you didn't think you were doing anything wrong, but (in my mind at least) actually trying to understand the material makes it look a little better.  Also, I'd be really careful about what you do online. I'm a member of a programming board and sometimes people post looking to cheat on assignments, copying and pasting the exact question into the site.

Plenty of people should be looking for a subleaser during that time too, so if they haven't found someone for the whole summer, they should be willing to let you pay to live there for 3 weeks."
OSU,34j7n0,throwawaykecemis,1 point,Sat May 2 04:50:56 2015 UTC,"1) Find a friend who won't mind your stuff being up in their stuff for a few weeks, and sleep on their couch. You might get lucky, it is summer after all.  2) Most storage units will rent out for 10-20 bucks a month especially for the first month, surf couches until you can move in.  3) If you have a decent sized car and not a lot of stuff, keep it in your car and surf couches or go home. Just DONT LEAVE heat sensitive shit in there like electronics...or bottles of lotion like I did :|"
OSU,34j7n0,ZeroHundred,1 point,Sun May 3 17:08:53 2015 UTC,A couple of summers ago I was out of a place for two weeks while I still had a job.

OSU,34hk31,baWWR,7,Fri May 1 07:02:28 2015 UTC,the whole grandview / upper arlington area south of lane is nice if you want somewhere quiet and don't mind running in a neighborhood. there are hills and if you're slightly ambitious you can connect to the scioto trail and loop back to the olentangy.  maybe over by hoover reservoir?
OSU,34hk31,Bieterman,2,Fri May 1 12:38:47 2015 UTC,"Second this. I used to take Woodruff all the way west until it becomes a path through the west parking lots / cornfields and out into UA. Lots of good neighboorhoods to run around out there.   Alternatively, OP can check out some of the bike shops around town for trail maps. I know Baer Wheels in Clintonville has a great fold-out ""Columbus Bike Paths"" map free for customers."

One of my favorite trails is down 4th street into downtown, taking a right on Main St. then running over to the Olentangy trail and taking that back up to campus.  Another good place is to run 4th street north and hit glenn echo park and then run up Indianola, cross to high street and continue north until Walhalla and take a right on that.  The end of Walhalla is Indianola so you can take a right and head back down to campus.  The best paths are when you have no set path where you want to run."

OSU,34il23,ragerme,13,Fri May 1 13:39:53 2015 UTC,"In my experience, as soon as a professor says 'I plan on curving this class' the effort people put into the class quickly falls to 0. This has got to be depressing as a professor, put all this effort into coming up with lectures, exams, being passionate about the subject, and then having students put 0 effort in? I think professors say the class won't be curved just to keep students putting some effort into the course.   90% of the time, when a professor has said ""There won't be a curve"" I've ended up with a curve in some fashion."
OSU,34il23,bsilvereagle,9,Fri May 1 13:53:00 2015 UTC,"^Agreed.   I'm also in this class and I understand your rage, but I don't see why he wouldn't curve. Nobody seems to be doing well. This is his first time teaching so I think he's waiting to see how we do on the final since it's 4/7 of our grade. Also, remember that if your final exam grade is higher than your cumulative grade in the class, he'll give you the higher grade (this seems like an unlikely scenario though). I also found the final study guide to be useful, although knowing his grading style, I'll lose points on a bunch of small things that will pull my grade down.   Chill out /u/ragerme, you're almost there.  Edit: Also, throwback to STAT 3470 with Ramos: 50% averages, tons of extra credit, said there'd be no curve, still curved final grade 5-6%."
OSU,34il23,wafflequeene,1 point,Fri May 1 14:08:45 2015 UTC,Ramos curves? I'm in his class right now and really hoping to at least pass after taking the final and not doing so well. I need hope.
OSU,34il23,smsdude45,2,Fri May 1 20:16:22 2015 UTC,"I can't guarantee anything, but he curved our final grades last semester. He had already given us extra credit assignments to buffer the low midterm averages and even added another 5 percentage points onto the final exam's weight. So let's say the final is 35% of your grade, and you got an 80 on it. That's 29/35, but he would bump it up to 34/35. The final curve was just a little bonus.   I made a complicated comment about his grading in another thread."
OSU,34il23,wafflequeene,1 point,Fri May 1 20:58:09 2015 UTC,Well that at least gives me a sliver of hope. At this point I'm just hoping to pass the class.
OSU,34il23,smsdude45,7,Fri May 1 22:10:08 2015 UTC,"3345 is usually everyone's first encounter with a truly ""rigorous"" math course involving proofs. Things that seem nit-picky are probably actual mistakes that essentially make the proof worthless (okay, maybe not writing ""proof"" is a little picky). There may not be a ""curve"" per say, but there will be an adjusted grading scale, he's not just gonna fail everyone."
OSU,34il23,buddhasuncle,3,Fri May 1 15:02:47 2015 UTC,"I'm in that section too! And I actually wrote one of those reviews. :)  I doubt you're the only one. I got average on the first midterm, but tanked the second midterm, HARD. According to him, the average was low because a lot of people assumed the conclusion for inductive hypothesis and he basically gave you no points for doing that. I asked him for extra credit opportunities, but he kind of just laughed. I always walk out of quizzes feeling confident, only to have him shave off points here and there. I'm praying for a bell curve. I gave him a loooooot of feedback on his SEI."
OSU,34il23,MustardBeenGood,3,Fri May 1 13:50:40 2015 UTC,"(Most) professors don't grade hard to be dicks, they do it so you learn.  I bet you don't forget to write ""proof:"" on your proofs any more.  It takes virtually no work to quickly go through everyone's test giving out A's and B's - the instructors who do that aren't doing it to be nice, they're doing it because they're lazy.  Can you imagine how much time it takes to check every step of every student's detailed proof?  Grading the kind of details you're describing is incredibly time consuming; if he wanted to be an asshole, there are easier ways he could do it.  It's just seems more plausible that he actually cares about the material."
OSU,34kiui,Zentiseon,1 point,Fri May 1 23:15:36 2015 UTC,"Not sure what you mean by significant, but they do move the grading scale around if the averages are low (which they usually are), sometimes by a few percentages.

Most of it is learning moves and then practicing with a partner and shield, and he has some drills where you have to defend against multiple attackers wielding clubs.

They're just parking spaces, more typically for boats and RVs. $43 a month to park in Grove City is more expensive than some campus parking plans but probably less than the prorated refund for the plan allowing OP to park overnight in the Lane Avenue garage.    I would be too paranoid to leave my car on campus without getting something in writing from CampusParc. I would expect that a car that doesn't leave a garage for so many days is considered abandoned and subject to towing.

But because it's part of our beloved band people are willing to overlook it, or give them more leeway. The band has has more cases of reported sexual assault than the entire Greek community since 2011. I know that this article doesn't specifically mention Greek life, I just feel that the double standard is unfair and clearly portrayed in this situation."
OSU,34cu7r,acompletekneebiter,30,Thu Apr 30 05:10:38 2015 UTC,"Definitely not the same. If it were about a frat and the other members were condoning the action, then people would demand it be shut down. If it were about a frat and the frat had already kicked the guy out and were taking steps to make sure none of their members did anything like this again, nobody would demand the frat be shut down.   This guy is a staff member of a very lucrative and iconic part of OSU and of course they're not gonna get rid of the whole band just because one guy is accused of rape and kidnapping. That's another thing--right now he's accused of it, not charged. We have to remember to be fair to him and assume innocence until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.   I guess what I'm saying is chill out; the Greek community at OSU isn't being victimized by anyone and the band program will go on with or without this guy."

I don't understand why OSU can't just take it upon themselves to warn students about this, especially because many of us are walking home early in the morning from the library during finals week. I get that this was farther north of the main area for off campus housing, but students still do live in the area."
OSU,349jeb,urinal_connoisseur,11,Wed Apr 29 11:28:09 2015 UTC,"Help me understand this way of thinking, because I'm not trying to belittle you.  I went to OSU long before safety alerts, so I'm trying to understand how the system is helpful in a situation like this.  Our safety alert was the police chopper flying low with a searchlight. :)  When I lived in that area (I lived on Indiana, 4th and 15th, etc.) I assumed that everything around me was a festering shithole and that I needed to be constantly aware of myself and my surroundings, especially at night.  It's not a nice neighborhood, and I can't imagine it's gotten any better over the last decade or two.  If I got a txt every time someone was assaulted, shot, stabbed, robbed within a five mile radius of campus, I think I'd be terrified to ever leave my apartment.  The chances of a gunman randomly shooting people at 1:30AM on a weekday seems pretty slim.  Not to belittle the death of this person, but it seems unlikely that you are in danger.  Probably either a dispute between two people, or a robbery gone bad (and those happen all the time, so a text after the fact seems unhelpful)  So if the txt goes out, do you say ""oh, I'm nowhere near Summit/Clinton, I'm good"" and go on with a possibly overinflated sense of confidence (walking home in the wee hours of the night from campus, especially that far off-campus never seems like the safe choice) or do you lock down your apartment on W. 9th, because ""he could be anywhere""?   Also, I would be really pissed if I got a text at 2AM before a big final, waking me up to tell me that someone may have been shot several miles away.  It seems like a lose:lose proposition for the University."
OSU,349jeb,hardolaf,16,Wed Apr 29 12:22:38 2015 UTC,"I just want people to be informed. I'm from the Detroit area, so I am familiar with having situational awareness and being in areas of high crime, but so many people here are not. A lot of students have grown up in a bubble, and it is easy for people to assume that this is a safe area because campus is so nice. On the other hand, I know that these people can overreact because they have never lived in the city.   I have become aware of the stabbing, gas station shooting, kidnapping (which was actually on campus), and now this shooting through social media such as yik yak and twitter. It is easy to spread misinformation and hysteria on these platforms. People are going to find out either way. Wouldn't you rather they get the facts rather than see dramatic posts about it on social media? I feel that OSU should send out an email alert to explain the situation, give us the known facts, and tell us whether or not it is believed to be a direct threat to students. This way, people are informed and can make informed decisions.   Also, the crime alert system they use now is through email.  TL;DR: I understand that this is kind of a lose:lose situation for the university, but I think that it does more good for people to be informed of the facts rather than learn about these situations through unreliable social media."
OSU,349jeb,hardolaf,2,Wed Apr 29 12:50:10 2015 UTC,"It is likely that the university police were not made directly aware of the event. Furthermore, they have no duty to inform students of every crime happening in the surrounding areas. Realistically, they only send notices for crimes on and near campus (as in a few blocks at most). Where is shooting occurred, it was far north of a majority of student living and was likely not seen as a continuing threat to the campus community."
OSU,349jeb,hardolaf,5,Wed Apr 29 13:02:07 2015 UTC,"The ER route on CABS goes through there, so clearly the university thinks there are a lot of students living there."
OSU,349jeb,healslfg,1 point,Wed Apr 29 17:51:33 2015 UTC,But is it a continuing threat to students and were they aware of it? Columbus Police not Campus Police responded to the crime. Did Campus Police know about it in any timely fashion? There is a lot they need to consider.
OSU,349jeb,bigyellowjoint,1 point,Wed Apr 29 19:35:04 2015 UTC,I think the complaints about this are about the greater trend that the police just haven't sent out any warnings all semester. Why did they stop? If it wasn't necessary why did they ever do it to begin with?
OSU,349jeb,TrueBlonde,1 point,Wed Apr 29 19:37:45 2015 UTC,"The case earlier this semester with the stabbing? By the time university police were notified, Columbus PD already had the stabber in custody. No continuing threat, no warning issued.  With this case, university police probably didn't know about the case for a few hours by which point it was clear that there was no continuing threat.   Notice the main phrase here: continuing threat. They only tell us via email or texts that a crime has occurred when the perpetrator is still at large or there continues to be the risk of additional crime by other parties. Otherwise, they tweet out notices and post them to their website. No need to wake campus up at 2 am if the shooter is in custody or is known to have fled the area."
OSU,34csy2,marth1234,1 point,Thu Apr 30 02:53:11 2015 UTC,I took the 1152 Final last semester and it was tough. (At least for me) I remember it covering most everything across the board.   I think the only chapter left out was at the very end of the class. The section after Vectors I believe.
OSU,34bzs4,SchmittyWasNumber1,11,Wed Apr 29 22:56:08 2015 UTC,If money isn't the issue (as in living in the dorms wouldn't be financially infeasible) I would say it's worth the experience to live in the dorms. Some people end up making life long friends in the dorms and they often times have a better support system academically and socially.  The decision is more social than it is academic.
OSU,34bzs4,The64only,9,Wed Apr 29 23:22:07 2015 UTC,"Dorm, and it's not even close. You can move back home at any time, live by yourself, commute, etc. - but this is your one opportunity to be a first year student living in a dorm with other first year students. It is my opinion that living on campus greatly enhances your college experience - so you can't put a price on that."
OSU,34bzs4,pehrk,2,Wed Apr 29 23:24:36 2015 UTC,"I'll regret commuting for the rest of my life. Don't pass on the opportunity to live on campus. If you ever want to have a social life, make long lasting friends and get laid, don't commute.   I also want to move far away from home after graduation and I feel like I wouldn't want to do that as much if I hadn't been living at home my whole college career."
OSU,34bzs4,BenjaminTalam,2,Thu Apr 30 01:30:14 2015 UTC,"I lived in the dorms the first year and have commuted since. I agree with what most people said, living in the dorms is a great experience (admittedly very overpriced) but the connections you make and friends you meet can last a lifetime. Commuting isn't as awful as I thought it would be and a 20 minute commute isn't bad at all but I would definitely recommend living in the dorms your first year for sure, dorming a second year seems like overkill to me but you may decide differently towards the end of the year."
OSU,34bzs4,GringoBen,2,Thu Apr 30 02:01:20 2015 UTC,or you can try a semester in the dorms.
OSU,34bzs4,Featherfy,2,Thu Apr 30 07:37:20 2015 UTC,"I am a current freshman and for me, living in the dorms was overrated. Then again, I had lousy luck with my suitemates. They were either drinking, playing music too loud, talking shit about each other, talking loudly about sex/alcohol/birth control or having sex (we have thin walls). I expected Lincoln to be quieter. It's sort of luck of the draw unless you pick someone you know.    Depends on how convenient it is for you to drive to class and back. there are a lot of events on campus and its definitely easier to get them if you live here. But $9000 is quite a bit of money to be saved."
OSU,34bzs4,The64only,1 point,Thu Apr 30 17:30:14 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your takes. Do you think that dorming my second year is worth the money too, or is it better to only go into the dorms my first year to make friends/build familiarity with OSU, then just stay at home next year (since I can't get an apartment until my third year)? Basically, would it be a drag to stay at home for a year after having experienced my first year on my own?"
OSU,34bzs4,The64only,1 point,Thu Apr 30 00:47:37 2015 UTC,"At that point it depends a lot more on the person. I'm glad that I stayed in the dorms for a second year instead of moving off campus, other people feel differently. Anyway, you'll most likely have found a group of friends that would be willing to plan around the things that making hanging out and living 20 mins off campus a nuisance."
OSU,34bzs4,pehrk,1 point,Thu Apr 30 01:19:26 2015 UTC,"Good points 64. Do you know anyone who has done what I described, or no? And are you personally within commuting distance, or was your choice between living on campus or in an apartment one of necessity? And why do you think living in the dorms your second year was the best choice? Thanks again."
OSU,34bzs4,ButtDozer,1 point,Thu Apr 30 01:28:35 2015 UTC,"One of my friends from freshman year moved to an apartment their second year and back home to Westerville their third year. Since they already knew people from freshman year it wasn't hard for them to find people to go out with or an apartment to crash at.  I moved to an apartment my last two years as my friend and I had been thinking about it. There are also very few people that live in the dorms after their 2nd year so it gets harder to relate to your floor mates, at least from what I observed. It's also a nice change of pace after living with people screaming down the hallways at 2am and dealing with the communal/semi-private bathrooms on the weekends.  I met some great people my second year so I'm glad I stayed."
OSU,34bzs4,ohiozr2,1 point,Thu Apr 30 01:43:00 2015 UTC,You don't have to live in the dorm to meet the requirement. You can join a fraternity and live there if I'm not mistaken.

Later in the summer the marching band will be using one of the fields on Tuesday and Thursday nights but there's generally plenty of space. Also if you feeling like walking another 10 minutes or so there's some great areas with real grass on the west side of the river. Not sure how the parking is but it's a very well maintained area from the looks of it."

OSU,34b7mb,strawberry_7,3,Wed Apr 29 19:33:13 2015 UTC,"In short, the honors program has a more academic focus, while the scholars program has a more social focus. I don't really see the point in taking an honors course if you don't need to; this isn't high school where it looks good to take individual honors courses. If you're comfortable sharing, why do you want to take an honors course?"
OSU,34b7mb,acompletekneebiter,1 point,Thu Apr 30 01:23:40 2015 UTC,Hmm I see your point... Actually I am looking at Honors classes because of their size. I've heard that some classes at OSU are huge.
OSU,34b7mb,acompletekneebiter,2,Thu Apr 30 01:46:50 2015 UTC,"They are, but that also means that you have lots of people to draw from as resources. Your classes get smaller as you become more specialized and with your major I really wouldn't worry.   Also, scholars has a huge benefit over honors in that you get sooo many more networking opportunities, which are what really matter when it comes to internships and jobs."

The syllabus for the first exam is very, very similar to the syllabus for stat 4201 (or math 4530, which is often harder, but structured more toward actuarial science majors). As far as the difficulty, I found the next round of classes (linear: math 2568, probability which is want I mentioned above, and theory of interest: math 3618) to be decently tougher than Calc 3.   A lot of that is dependent on professor, mind you, but looking farther down the road, the first couple actuarial exams are about 3x harder than your average math final for a class.  EDIT: Also, going with what /u/captainwhitebread said, the other actuarial exam you could consider taking first is FM (financial mathematics), which corresponds to math 3618. The other exam I already mentioned is called exam P, probability."

Because you are currently pursuing a math minor I'm guessing you have already taken Calculus 3, so I recommend that you talk to your advisor and take Math 3618 and Stat 4201 before you actually change your major to pre actuarial science, and if you pass the classes and like them then you will be able to switch directly into actuarial science and you will have taken two classes that prepare you for the first two actuarial exams.

They really fucking suck.   EDIT: Also, you need a high GPA. The field is super competitive so anything less than a 3.5 won't cut it.  Also, I wouldn't bother changing your major. An econ/math combo would be just as good as actsci. The actsci classes just help to prepare you for exams better. If I were you, I'd self-study for the exams and continue on with econ/math. It'll be slightly harder since you won't be doing the stuff in class, but you could always take an actsci class as an ""elective.""

If you're already an econ major with a math minor, you have the right mindset for the field! One thing I will stress is that you should do A LOT of research into actuarial science and the process of becoming an actuary before committing.   As others have mentioned, there's a series of insanely difficult exams required to become certified (and get jobs or internships) so you'd be pretty behind on this as a junior. As a scale for how insanely hard the exams are, last semester I easily passed a class associated with one of the exams (Math 3618, exam FM) with an unweighted A, studied an additional month, and then failed the exam even though I felt totally confident.  Additionally, there are some credit requirements called VEE's which cover more topics not explicitly covered in the Actuarial Science major, but can be covered before you graduate if you take the correct courses. Consider sticking with economics, I'll be completing a minor (maybe a double major?) in order to fulfill some of these requirements."

OSU,343f7u,f1sh_,5,Tue Apr 28 00:12:13 2015 UTC,"FWIW, I received 3 offers before I graduated and I had a 3.6.  I started work a month before graduation as an ""intern"" to speed up the on-boarding and was at work a week after my graduation ceremony."
OSU,343f7u,bsilvereagle,1 point,Tue Apr 28 00:16:31 2015 UTC,"That's a really solid GPA. I hope to be close to that. I transferred from a way easier school back in Cleveland and had a mildly rough adjustment year. Congrats though, that's really exciting and makes me feel more hopeful."
OSU,343f7u,sxeQ,2,Tue Apr 28 00:17:58 2015 UTC,"If you're passionate about the automotive industry, you'll do fine. If you're passionate about manufacturing, you'll do fine.   Otherwise, yeah, I agree 100% that the department has made the degree very broad (which is good and bad). You can help to 'narrow' it down by doing an Undergraduate thesis or joining a student engineering group (most of these have a strong automotive bent though).   With a strong GPA, you'll have no problems finding work as an ME. If all else fails, the finance industry loves to recruit MEs (with strong GPAs)."
OSU,343f7u,sxeQ,2,Tue Apr 28 00:59:03 2015 UTC,"Not a ME major (materials science & engineering). However, from what I know, having work experience during college, in the form of internships generally, is the best thing you can do for yourself. Especially if you can get one in the field you want to work in, they allow you to specialize yourself a bit and have experience you can show to employers when you graduate."
OSU,343f7u,grave_r0bber,1 point,Tue Apr 28 01:57:55 2015 UTC,"I've heard this as well. I really wanted to try and have 2 internships and research done before I graduate. Honestly, I'm not even all that sure how one applies to internships and when. I talked to my adviser about it a little when scheduling and she told me to start applying early next year, but she also said it's best to be officially admitted into the major before applying which kind of confused me because I wont be officially admitted into the major until spring next year because I still have to complete statics, but my EPHR is high enough to where I was told I'll be automatically admitted and still be on track."
OSU,343f7u,Tronn60,1 point,Tue Apr 28 02:03:26 2015 UTC,"For internships? I'm still pre-MSE, I can't apply until this coming fall semester, but I'm still working a MSE internship this summer.  As for how - ECS is a great resource, definitely check them out. If you don't go on /r/EngineeringStudents definitely subscribe to that sub, it's a really helpful place not just for internships."
OSU,343f7u,Tronn60,1 point,Tue Apr 28 02:38:37 2015 UTC,"Typically you'll want to apply for internships relatively early in the fall (around October or so). My best advice to you is to go to the engineering career fair and talk to all the reps from companies you would be interested in working for. Honestly, I don't think they'll care too much if you aren't ""officially"" an ME student yet, so long as they know you're interested in ME.   A lot of companies tend to fill up their intern positions rather early, so the sooner you start sending applications out, the better your chances of getting a position somewhere."
OSU,343f7u,PrematureJack,2,Wed Apr 29 16:44:54 2015 UTC,"Personally, I only had a 3.2 GPA and ended up getting six offers before graduating. I found that having good co-op/intern experience and being involved in interesting projects outside the classroom are what employers love hearing about the most.  Basically, just go do stuff. Being able to talk about projects you did that actually apply your engineering knowledge is super important. I think that companies are less likely to offer jobs to candidates that are only strong GPA wise and not experience/application wise."
OSU,343f7u,ecpi12345,0,Wed Apr 29 01:11:38 2015 UTC,Congrats on you're job offers. What kind of stuff we're you involved in as far as extra cirriculars? Any specific clubs? There's so many here I don't even know where to start.
OSU,343f7u,SoDel302,1 point,Wed Apr 29 04:21:09 2015 UTC,"So, I was actually pretty bad about extra curricular in the beginning. I wasn't in any clubs until just this year, and then I joined the D4! Makers club. I also did a bunch of personal projects with my own 3D printer and mini CNC though. Basically, you just want to be able to talk coherently and knowledgeably about some project you worked/helped on that took place outside of class. In my experience, recruiters are more interested in hearing what kind of things you've worked on rather than what classes you took.  As far as which clubs are out there, you are right there are so many. Project teams are probably what you'd want to be able to better market yourself, but it'd probably be nice if you are actually interested in what they do too. Here is a listing of engineering related clubs: https://engineering.osu.edu/studentorgs  I also interned one summer (between 2nd and 3rd year) as basically a CAD drafter, but that experience helped me get a co-op my 4th year. These experiences plus the projects I worked on got me all the offers I think. ECS is the reason I got all the co-ops I did and how I got a lot of my interviews. Sign up as soon as you are eligible and just send out as many applications as possible."
OSU,343f7u,buckeye503,2,Wed Apr 29 13:35:59 2015 UTC,It depends what you're willing to do.  If you treat your job search like a real job (i.e. spend 8 hrs a day on it) you'll find a job.  My brother graduated 3 years ago with a 3.2 and got a job lined up a few months before he graduated.  It's pretty much without question the most versatile field of engineering.
OSU,343f7u,bsilvereagle,1 point,Fri May 1 23:22:34 2015 UTC,"I'm an ME major just finishing up junior year and from what I understand is as a ME you are useful for pretty much every kind of company and a lot of companies seem to really respect an OSU ME. Like what was said below, if you are interested in automotive then get into the automotive clubs for that early edge and I know of a lot of people who end up getting internships at car manufacturers, if you like manufacturing then do look for specifying your tech electives for that and do some internships, if you don't know what you like then don't stress because the department has a ton of opportunities to get into what you like and you might not figure out what you really like until you do a few internships and take a few classes. Just to give some info on what I like, I have been aiming my specification towards control systems engineering and my research is focused on autonomous vehicle research so what I do is design controllers, analyze motors/actuators, and analyze how the system works as a whole.    As for grad school, if you don't mind two more years, possible management position, and a possible pay increase get a masters (or do bs/ms). If you want to do research for a university, go to a different university for grad school (universities apparently like professors with different backgrounds), if you want to do research for industry then go wherever you want.    If you want info on classes, check out my submission history, should be pretty helpful. I will update it after my finals on friday."
OSU,343f7u,stormyzephyr,1 point,Tue Apr 28 04:44:59 2015 UTC,"This comes from someone with no actual experience, so take it for what it's worth...  I have a really hard time believing that employers really care about a GPA if you have solid relevant experience with an internship. If you have a 2.5GPA but have two different internships where you did great work and you can get good references from them, it seems like that would be a lot better than having a 4.0 with no real world experience. Am I wrong?"
OSU,343pq5,astronnautes,2,Tue Apr 28 01:36:54 2015 UTC,"I would go with what Buckeyelink says, I'm not sure if Ziegler is a placeholder or not but the actual website should be correct. Actual instructors are updated on a departmental basis. Some may have this info posted already while others may not get this up till the last second (a week or less before next semester). I can't speak to physics but math is notorious for being one of the departments that takes the longest."
OSU,343pdg,greycap7,8,Tue Apr 28 01:33:58 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I think your first response should have been to talk to/email your professor instead of asking Reddit. Professors can be more helpful/willing to help in these situations then you may think"

OSU,343pdg,BrosenkranzKeef,1 point,Tue Apr 28 04:16:14 2015 UTC,Don't you need a C or above in classes listed on your major? I'm an Econ major.

I'm my experience at a different school, strings of classes with prereqs like math or language (not things like writing or even my core classes) required a C to move on. It was departmental requirements and not every department did."

For social science I would recommend just thinking about what you enjoy, there are loads of options including economics, psychology, and sociology (among others).   As far as cello goes I definitely recommend playing in an ensemble, they're all great here. However, OSU insists that the VPA credit is for ""learning about and appreciating"" the arts rather than performing them (although basic art classes count) and there are no  ways to fulfill an art credit by playing an instrument. History of Rock n Roll through the music department is often cited as an easy and interesting art credit, there's also a holography class that sounds really cool (lasers!) offered jointly through the art and physics departments (though you won't find a spot in this as an incoming freshman)."

OSU,3435gk,wch94,2,Tue Apr 28 16:35:59 2015 UTC,Prereqs for which courses? ECE 2000 and professionalism and ethics both have a few preqs which each require some prereqs.

OSU,3435gk,tittysprinklesrgod,6,Mon Apr 27 23:41:31 2015 UTC,Check the pre-reqs for those classes bro. CSE 1223 is Java which is a pre-req itself for CSE 2221 as well as some others that could qualify (1222 C++). For ECE 2000 you need ENGR 1181 and 1182. Google the classes and find the main description page OSU has for that course and on it will be described what classes are pre-reqs for them. In some cases you can take the pre-req as a co-req which means you can take the classes together that same semester.
OSU,3435gk,BSantry,2,Mon Apr 27 23:58:10 2015 UTC,"For eng 1181 and 1182 you can't even test out of them as far as I know.

His method of teaching is very lecture based, although he's completely open to questions and discussion. Other people complain that he teaches the class as if we're Harvard students. I think that's amazing. He thinks a lot about us as students, and believes we can deal with the subjects at hand.   Lawrence Baum teaches Civil Liberties. If I had to refer to a teaching style as dreamy, it'd be him. Good material, too. Constitutional law in federal, state, and private sectors. Topics I remember: cruel and unusual punishment, expressive freedoms, power of commerce. I'd highly suggest this course whether you're a PoliSci major or not.   Baum made a joke the first week of class, saying that by the end of the course, we would know more constitution than most congressmen. My final is on Monday, and I think this is probably true. :)"

OSU,33u5vd,-mb-,-6,Sun Apr 26 02:16:40 2015 UTC,I certainly hope the calender of mostly naked band students violated policies.

Please tell me why these things should be accepted under anyone's leadership.
OSU,33u5vd,caesar_primus,2,Sun Apr 26 02:22:40 2015 UTC,Because they weren't under his leadership... This is like saying you need to fire president Drake because that sorority got accused of hazing. Its not his fault kids do dumb shit.
OSU,33u5vd,dlineownzu4life,6,Sun Apr 26 06:45:32 2015 UTC,Not even close to the same thing. Waters knew there was blatant violations in university policies and didn't do enough to stop it.
OSU,33u5vd,mathafrica,1 point,Sun Apr 26 16:45:37 2015 UTC,"Waters suspended section leaders and sanctioned entire sections when he learned about inappropriate behavior by students. He also shut down midnight romp and a variety of other events that were seen as ""contributing to the sexualized culture."" Don't take what the university is saying as truth. They like to say a lot of things to make themselves appear like white knights. Realistically all they care about is larger paychecks for top, non-faculty officials and increasing revenue for the university.  If you want to confirm what I said about the band, just go talk to anyone in it from when Waters was director."
OSU,33u5vd,hardolaf,0,Wed Apr 29 13:49:29 2015 UTC,"You have a good point.  I know how sketchy our university is. I think anyone who blindly trusts this university, needs to look into forced resignation of Steve Kremer over the new construction of new grad student housing. Contracts given to friends. Kremer tried to speak up about it and got annihilated by the top dogs. He was forced to resign, tried suing for lost wages, and then saw how long the process was going to take and just asked for an apology. Ohio State paid tens of thousands to not apologize. During this whole ordeal, anti-semitic comments by upper admins were made. Not to mention the rigged apparel contract with leaked emails included.  Also a university admin threw a girl to the ground during one of those times when students protested (I think because of the Sodexo contract?). It was never made public. Lantern never ran a story about it.   As a band guy, can you be objective and say the university is fucking him though? What parts aren't true? I'm already convinced our university is shady, so I shouldn't be hard to convince about Waters."
OSU,33u5vd,mathafrica,1 point,Wed Apr 29 21:46:39 2015 UTC,"I'm not a band guy. I have friends who are and were in the bands. One of them pulled up the emails and other correspondence he'd gotten from Waters. To be fair, it was all true... Ten years ago. The band has changed a lot. We have a higher number of women than other similar bands. The report included none of Waters own statements, presented evidence, or any testimony from band members that were not complainants or from band staff that were not complainants. The report allowed testimony about other people's feelings without even asking those people for comment. It was completely one sided.   And yes, I know how corrupt this university is. But what do you expect?"
OSU,33u5vd,hardolaf,2,Wed Apr 29 22:02:03 2015 UTC,"When he knows about it and does nothing, it is his fault."
OSU,33u5vd,smartfbrankings,1 point,Sun Apr 26 15:19:37 2015 UTC,Band students are under his leadership. He's literally the head of the marching band. Come on. It's like saying you can't punish the head of the frat for allowing rampant hazing and sexual assault.
OSU,33u5vd,caesar_primus,8,Sun Apr 26 15:42:37 2015 UTC,I see the TBDBITL cult has got the downvote pitchforks out in numbers!
OSU,33u5vd,smartfbrankings,1 point,Sun Apr 26 03:35:09 2015 UTC,"If anyone in this thread truly believes that these actions wouldn't have happened under any other band director, apparently you've forgotten what a college student is. Time and time again, when interviewing band members there has been testimony stating that if anyone was uncomfortable with one of their activities, THEY WERE NOT FORCED TO PARTICIPATE. Additionally, these same things have gone on for decades. Many band members were recorded saying Waters has done much more to end the ""sexualized behavior"" of the band than anyone else. You can't change things overnight. That's like saying: ""Hey people in charge of Greek life, next year you must eliminate all underage drinking or you'll be kicked out of the university."""
OSU,33u5vd,buddhasuncle,7,Sun Apr 26 15:56:30 2015 UTC,"""Not being forced to participate"" and ""Not being forced to participate with no repercussion or consequence"" are two very different things. I am quite willing to bet that a number of non-participating members in these events did so at the cost of being ostracized or judged for their refusal.   And I am sick and damn tired of seeing Waters apologists whining about how ""You can't change this culture in a heartbeat!"" Waters wasn't fired for not changing the culture quickly enough. Waters was fired for barely appearing to try. The carelessness and callousness on Waters' part for trying to expel both the perpetrator and victim in the one assault, and then failing, even after a recommendation following ANOTHER assault, to implement sexual harassment/assault education is very damning and proof that he didn't take this issue seriously enough to do anything about it. For fuck's sake, this was a culture that was OK with making a calendar of scantily-clad male members especially for Waters. There is no question that this rampant behavior would have more or less continued unabated under Waters had nothing been done. And it's hard for me to take band members seriously when they say that he was doing things to change the culture when they turn right around in the very same spiel and say that the changes weren't even necessary (e.g. ""He stopped Midnight Ramp but it was totally optional so NBD guys!"").   Firing Waters was the right step. It was certainly not popular, but the right decision rarely is."
OSU,33u5vd,v8654,3,Sun Apr 26 22:20:24 2015 UTC,And the truth is that he did away with Midnight Ramp only after the investigation started.
OSU,33u5vd,hardolaf,1 point,Mon Apr 27 04:08:01 2015 UTC,Actually he announced cancelling it to all section leaders after he discovered it was still happening. I know this because one of my friends was a section leader at the time. He has the email to prove Waters canceled it way before the investigation started.
OSU,33u5vd,hierocles,-15,Wed Apr 29 13:55:51 2015 UTC,"There's no such thing as ""reverse sex discrimination."" It's just sex discrimination.  He has no case, either way. He was fired for failure to comply with Title IX regulations and willingly failing to change the band culture. His sex discrimination claim relies on a cheer-leading coach who was ultimately fired for the same reasons he was. But because she wasn't immediately fired, Waters is saying he was discriminated against. It's a bogus claim, just like all his due-process claims. His lawyer is throwing everything at the wall and seeing what sticks.  This article fails to mention that the other three complaints by Waters were thrown out. (The Dispatch has a better article: http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2015/04/24/waters-ruling.html) The only reason the sex discrimination complaint is moving forward is because courts don't hear those cases often, so there may be novel constitutional questions. But the chance of Waters winning is very low. He's a white man in a position of power."

OSU,33y57p,bsilvereagle,1 point,Mon Apr 27 01:54:19 2015 UTC,"It is up to the professor if they want to give you the points. The fact of the matter is that on the test, you chose the wrong answer. The reason could be the wording made you confused or that you didn't know the correct answer. The best way to work around this is to meet with the professor in person, discuss the material, and try to prove your case about why your interpretation and subsequent answer were justifiably an alternative answer. If they decide you made a compelling argument, they may give you the points or come up with an arrangement for you to earn them. Otherwise, they'll tell you to deal with it and that will be that."
OSU,33y57p,stormyweather2,-4,Sun Apr 26 19:32:38 2015 UTC,"I walked the prof through my logic as I approached the question. The question was like so, in form: ""What is the current state of object A and object B?""  A. Object A and B are white (false) B. Object B is black (true, but...) C. Object B is white (false) D. Object A and B are gray (it smelled of falsity, but I felt as if it were a somewhat justifiable answer)  I chose D, while B was the ""correct"" answer. I made clear to the professor that answer B discusses only Object B, and does not fully answer the question. I explained to him that, with the wording, I was immediately inclined to disregard any answer that didn't pertain information regarding both Object A and Object B.  It was just shitty wording. And I'm confused as to why he doesn't understand the structure of a sentence. Feel free to call bullshit on me if you don't think this is legitimately bad wording."
OSU,33y57p,stormyweather2,3,Sun Apr 26 19:43:09 2015 UTC,"I have no idea what the context is or how to interpret it. If you think you're correct, meet with the professor. If the answer you chose was wrong regardless, then you probably don't have much of a case. If B only answers half the question, but answers it correctly, I would say half-right is better than all wrong."

I was pre-vet/biology last year, worked at a vet clinic and figured out that while I like animals, I hated the amount of stress the place seemed to always be under and some of the pet owners. I could never see myself doing that for the rest of my life. What you think a career will be like vs. what it actually is are two very different things, often enough.  Now I'm basically doing engineering just because of the diverse options I can pursue with it, all of which probably have a chance at making a living wage at the very least.

While I won't go so far as to say you'll never be employed, it's true that those majors seem not very applicable to the average major (CSE, engineering, etc) you'll see on this sub.

My mouse would occasionally bump one of the monitor stands when I'd be to deep into the swing of things.  My printer was on my dresser or the floor.  If you want to set up a beowulf cluster, you may run out of room for cases - but one (non-crazy mainframe) box, say ATX or 4U rack, you're fine."
OSU,33utxi,ParadigmComplex,3,Sun Apr 26 00:16:53 2015 UTC,I was able to get a thermal take a71 case in my dorm which is pretty big (I'll post a pic later I'm not at my dorm right now) and a single monitor. My friend in a Morrill double has a mid tower and triple monitors and it's fine. It really depends on what dorm you get though; if you apply to Morrill and get a double you can pretty much fit anything but some dorms will limit the amount of monitors you can fit. I would look at a mid tower and a single monitor to make sure you can fit it since that will probably fit in every dorm room.  Edit: here are pics of my dorm and my friend at Morril's dorm. mine is the one with only one monitor as said before.
OSU,33utxi,BlueSubaruCrew,2,Sun Apr 26 05:40:21 2015 UTC,"I mean I fit a full tower pc in my dorm along with a single 22"" monitor.  It didn't feel like it took much space but who knows man."

The next biggest thing is ""are students/staff/faculty in on-going danger?"" I think it makes sense that they would ask these questions.   Are there certain risks to living in/attending an urban campus? Yes, of course.   Do I need to be told via emergency notices or emails that these risks have become an event that has occurred? It depends.   If they used the emergency notification and email system for every single crime that happens on and around the university people would probably begin ignore these notifications. By keeping it limited to things that can continue to represent an on-going threat you minimize the risk of that threat being ignored.  If you want to read about crimes on campus the Department of Public Safety posts a log on their website. If you want to know about off-campus follow a Columbus crime blotter."

Chem 1220 is not unrealistically difficult if you are generally capable, willing to read chapters, take good notes, and do homework problems; you will get a good grade.

One of my friends did Russian self paced her third semester, then went into the fourth semester really far behind. Sooo... If you aren't super into the language, it's a decent option, but I'd recommend sticking with it. This is only based on my experiences with Russian though."

OSU,33pxrn,cmjohnson7799,2,Fri Apr 24 15:41:56 2015 UTC,"Have you considered Italian? It shares a lot of words with the Spanish language (madre for example). While I haven't taken it personally, my friends that took Spanish in HS did and said it was easy."

In addition there are plenty of Study Abroad opportunities with German if you're looking for that. Best of luck, cheers"
OSU,33pxrn,germanyman10,1 point,Fri Apr 24 17:57:19 2015 UTC,"I just finished German 1101 (for fun) and it was great! It is a pretty chill class but you do learn a lot. Based on my experience, the German program is set up much better than the Spanish one. Also, Chinese is one of OSU's best departments. It's tough at first but a fun language to learn. But as others have said, be very careful with self-paced. It sounds great, but you miss out on being able to talk with people who are at your level. 90% of any language class at OSU is talking with partners/groups, which is how you learn the language. I did self-paced upper level Chinese and I would literally just do all the work on my own and then go in and have a 5 minute conversation with the prof about the material I covered. It's fine for upper level language learning, but for beginning a new language I wouldn't recommend it."

OSU,33nz3q,TwistEnding,-1,Sat Apr 25 18:45:18 2015 UTC,"No it's really not ridiculous at all you're obviously ignorant to hazing.

You are also so ""positive it occurred"" based on what? A yak on Yik Yak? Are you serious dude? And I'm ignorant, you literally come off as a complete idiot. Basing your opinions and getting news from Yik Yak is like getting your news from The Onion. ""Every rumor is true"" - so just like Canes and Pizza By the Slice burning down last night then?  Holy hell does every sentence you made in that entire comment sound just absurdly stupid. You are either completely delusional or a troll. You must be a troll because I can not believe that I have interacted with someone as big an idiot as you.

And of course my opinion isn't going to be popular on reddit, it's a website filled with people who are mostly not in Greek Life/irrationally hate it. I'm more connected to the situation than you are, actually knowing people in the sorority, but no, you are totally right with your sources of ""Yik Yak"" and ignorance. You sound like you might have some serious issues going on in your buddy. Like there is no way that I am going to even respond to you again after this comment after such a riculous and stupid comment as the one that you just made.

OSU,33o12e,Atwyay,7,Fri Apr 24 02:14:48 2015 UTC,"I commuted from Pataskala my first two years. It didn't make financial sense for me to live on campus when I could live with my parents for free ~30 minutes away from campus. You don't get the true ""college experience"", but I ended up just fine. I met a lot of people through organizations and made a lot of friends, so I never felt like a loner as a commuter. Word of caution is to be aware of how early your classes are scheduled. I had classes scheduled at 8 and 9 AM, and didn't realize I would be on the road the same time as everyone trying to get to work. Usually scheduling classes for 10:20 or later worked fine for me. Driving to school everyday last winter sucked, and because of that I decided to become an RA and live on campus. Anyway, you don't have to lose community or not have friends as a commuter. You just may have to give a bit more effort."
OSU,33o12e,WolfBad,8,Fri Apr 24 02:54:55 2015 UTC,"Hello! I'm a freshman here and I commute everyday. I live about 30 minutes away without traffic. It's not bad at all once you get used to it.   The biggest thing is that you need to have schedule for your classes well. You may be able to avoid rush hour this way.   I would also recommend talking to your professors/TAs about what their policy is on sending items due that day through email if the weather is terrible or traffic is really bad.  Making friends and hanging out can be pretty difficult and depending on your classes may just add more stress to yourself if you overdo it. You can hang out, but it's hard to get home early this way.  A lot of college is time management and to achieve your goals you'll need it."
OSU,33o12e,Zigran7,6,Fri Apr 24 03:03:23 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't commute if I were you. I knew a few people who commuted freshman year and while they made friends in class, it was never a friendship where you hangout with the people all the time since the only time they were around was for classes. While it's expensive, I found it to be worth it for the social aspect. If you don't care about going to parties and stuff though you might be fine with commuting, but since you're making this post worrying about the sense of community I would definitely live on campus."
OSU,33o12e,mapofearth,6,Fri Apr 24 21:25:40 2015 UTC,"Absolutely this. Don't cheat yourself out of the once-in-a-lifetime social experience that is living on campus, especially as a freshman in a dorm. That's how I met, directly or indirectly, literally every single good friend that I hung out with throughout all of college. My roommates in future years were all friends that I made in the dorm, or friends of those friends. I can't imagine where I would have been socially if I lived at home and commuted to class every day. Probably lonely and miserable.  And it's not just the obvious stuff, like meeting friends in the dorm and being on campus so that you don't have to worry about driving and parking. It's the little things. The spontaneous late night adventures where you and your friends in the dorm are sitting in the study room not getting anything done, so you decide to go explore campus at 1:00 am and get Buckeye Donuts on the way back. The ability to make last minute plans for the night with a huge group of people because you're already all there together. Covertly pregaming in your dorm room and thinking you're all so sneaky when in fact the RA knows perfectly well what's up and is just being cool as long as you don't make an ass out of yourself. Getting dinner at Commons almost every night with all your friends from your floor, who basically become your family. All the little things that define that awesome time that is freshman year.  TL;DR: Living on campus as a freshman is a once-in-a-lifetime experience that you should absolutely not skip."

OSU,33o12e,smartfbrankings,5,Sat Apr 25 18:58:47 2015 UTC,"I'll be a senior this coming year and I'll have commuted everyday for all three (soon to be four) years. Ask away.  As for early morning drives especially 8AM classes, I try to leave around 6:50. Rush hour sucks, you just gotta deal with you. You'll park on west campus and take a bus. If you often have to turn stuff in I recommend leaving atleast 10 min earlier. You start to get a feel of the bus schedule in the mornings so you can adjust accordingly.  You'll be able to hangout with your friends but you'll have to feel for the bus schedule especially late at night when buses run less frequently. Sometimes I would walk to St. John arena just to increase my chance of getting a bus. I stayed late a lot for the freshman engineering project so it was pretty common for me to get home 11+.  Depending on your schedule and your preferences, you might end up going home late. I got out at 5 freshman year. I refuse to drive during rush hour so I would stay till 6/6:30 then head home (1 hr vs 30 min drive difference).  As for losing sense of community that will happen. You probably won't be attending as many events and stuff simply because you'll be worried about getting back home. It's one thing to walk back or grab a CABS/COTA bus and goto your dorm/appartment. It's another to go all the way to where your car is parked (even worse if it's at west campus - walking will take forever) then drive home on top of that.  I can talk a fair bit more if you would like about pros and cons as well as a bit more detail about the sense of community thing.  EDIT: I forgot to mention - fuck CampusParc."

OSU,33jfi4,thecosmicexperience,32,Thu Apr 23 00:23:32 2015 UTC,"Honestly, you should just live on campus for your first year. There are tons more resources available to you and it's way easier to make new connections when you live in a residence hall. I understand that money is an issue for some (as it was for me), but even one year on campus can really help you out in terms of knowing all of the places that can help you as a student, meeting people, and even job opportunities and free events and stuff."
OSU,33jfi4,acompletekneebiter,2,Thu Apr 23 03:23:44 2015 UTC,"I understand what you mean. However, I'm not too worried about having trouble making connections and stuff, because I'm a pretty sociable guy and plan to join clubs and stuff. And I've lived in C-Bus my whole life so I have a pretty good sense for where things are around Campus. I still plan on biking/walking to class except for extreme weather circumstances, as well.  Honestly I think I would really enjoy living in a dorm my first year, but scholarships haven't been working out in my favor and it just doesn't seem worth it for almost $12,000 more for the year."
OSU,33jfi4,acompletekneebiter,11,Thu Apr 23 03:50:12 2015 UTC,"I thought the same thing. I'm from central Ohio and always thought of myself as sociable and active, and I also had the same concern with money. But really, I cannot stress enough how beneficial it is to live in the dorms your freshman year. There are some connections and bonds that you simply can't make without living the res halls--you miss out on so much incredibly helpful and entertaining programming put on by housing staff, meeting so many new perspectives, and being truly immersed in your college experience.   I believe you when you say that you could make connections and succeed, but I think that you have so much to gain from being a sociable, involved person who also lives in the residence halls. Who knows, you could make good money by working as an OA or you could apply to be an RA next year and gain even more from your housing experience.   And really, I totally get where you're coming from with scholarships and money--I'm paying for my own education, and the idea of even more debt is scary. But more and more scholarships are offered every day and you can keep applying throughout the summer, and my experience in the dorms has been totally worth it, even though I was scared it wouldn't be. That extra cost is worth it to make your first year work in your favor and help you really feel like a part of the university."
OSU,33jfi4,steve_jahbs,5,Thu Apr 23 04:59:14 2015 UTC,"If you are a sociable person, and you know nobody else coming to OSU, do yourself a favor and live in the dorms. Most clubs only meet 1-2 times a week, and many people do not come consistently to every meeting. I'm not saying they are a bad place to meet people,but I think you may be overestimating how many friendships you will form there. At this point in the year, unless you sublease, you're probably going to have to live alone off campus. That kind of isolation for an extrovert is really taxing."
OSU,33jfi4,boomfarmer,7,Thu Apr 23 11:13:55 2015 UTC,"Do the landlords care enough to check /report you or whatever?   Nope. They do not want to lose paying customers to the University.

OSU,33jfi4,chairs_for_people,5,Thu Apr 23 00:37:28 2015 UTC,"Live in the dorms man. Once you are out on your own you are gonna get so lazy about getting to class. If your already on campus and can literally fall out of bed and walk to class, it makes it exponentially harder to justify skipping.  The dorms kind of suck for obvious reasons, but they are also really fun too. So many stupid and fun memories from Park.  You have plenty of time to turn into a lazy slob, at least spend the first year in a dorm where the process is slowed down."
OSU,33jfi4,Featherfy,4,Thu Apr 23 16:02:12 2015 UTC,"If you decide to to save money, go anywhere close. Really close. Otherwise I promise you'll never step foot on campus unless you need to. You'll be exhausted, hungry, fall asleep, etc. Unless you are within a 5 minute walking distance to a sociable area of campus, you might realize you will spend more time in your apartment than you wanted.

It is easy to come here and be lulled into a false sense of security because campus is so nice and clean. We still live in a city and many people who have lived their whole lives in  the safety of the suburbs forget that. OSU is doing those students a disservice by not sending an alert and reminding them of this.   This is now the third major incident this semester without an alert. Granted, the stabbing and shooting happened off campus, but a large portion of the student body lives in those areas."
OSU,33cgl8,steve_jahbs,18,Tue Apr 21 14:53:53 2015 UTC,"""University Police did not issue a public safety notice for this incident because “it was determined there was not a continuing threat to safety of the campus community and no imminent threat about which to alert people.”""  I personally work with the OSU Department of Public Safety.

OSU,33cgl8,dcviper,7,Tue Apr 21 12:09:42 2015 UTC,"Considering OSUPD generally waits several hours to send out a notice, if at all, then that line of reasoning makes sense. If they had a policy requiring timely notifications then it's absolutely ridiculous."

It doesn't exactly define ""timely"", however.   My guess is that the DPS would argue no such timely warning was necessary since there did not exist a ""serious or ongoing threat to students and employees""."
OSU,33cgl8,misteryub,1 point,Tue Apr 21 17:45:26 2015 UTC,"I'll tell you, the guy was arrested an hour and a half after the victim called police.

It was a presentation to introduce a new undergrad subject into OSU for the top brass. Definitely restricted to students because they discussed all the management / finance etc. topics at the end of it.  The presenter gave me the dead man stare. I couldn't help laughing the whole day after that. I had no idea what it was. He thought I was some lecturer and invited me in.

OSU,33dvsv,WolfBad,3,Tue Apr 21 21:25:40 2015 UTC,"You have to take them one at a time, as they build off each other (1181 is a prereq for 1182). You go over MATLAB in 1181 & 1182, and Solidworks in 1182."
OSU,33dvsv,Jrbaconcheeez,3,Tue Apr 21 22:45:00 2015 UTC,"As long as you're not in honors, they are fairly easy but time consuming.  Think lots of little assignments, multiple due dates every week, etc.  Also, I think there are only 2 Fundamentals of Eng courses, not 3."

OSU,33dvsv,cknasty,1 point,Wed Apr 22 19:45:54 2015 UTC,"It's only 15 credits and I'm not taking dynamics until next semester, so I think I can manage it if I study enough. And luckily I've heard that General Chem isnt as brutal as Engineering Chem since you dont have to take it with the really hard professor that does Engineering Chem.  I actually have the option to do Linear Algebra this semester and Diff Eq next but I want to get the harder one out of the way first. Which one did you find more difficult? Maybe I can switch it around."

OSU,33dvsv,cknasty,1 point,Wed Apr 22 21:29:24 2015 UTC,"I got credit for 1188 so I took 1186 and 1187. If you don't get transfer credit for 1186, 1187, or 1188, I think you have to take 1181 and 1182. I could be wrong, but I think that's how it works. The 2 classes I took were crazy easy. 1186 was mostly in class work and maybe a little (<1 hr per week) homework. 1187 was about the same amount of work and just as easy.  When people find out how much easier the Fundamentals of Engineering transfer sequence is, they usually complain about how much more work 1181 and 1182 are. But, I never took 1188 so that one could have more work."

OSU,33cpvu,mtjess60,3,Tue Apr 21 14:48:28 2015 UTC,"Apply early and definitely retake your ACT especially if you're looking for scholarship money which is heavily based on ACT scores and every point counts.  Colleges normally focus on your last 2 years in high school maybe include sophomore year, but not really  I don't exactly know what your cumulative GPA is, but really push for good grades your senior year. Getting in is half the battle; keeping your GPA up in college is a whole other story, so if you can get great study habits your last year and the remainder of junior year you can kill whatever is thrown at you."
OSU,33cpvu,Featherfy,2,Wed Apr 22 01:44:27 2015 UTC,Its almost all SAT/ACT really... In high school they make extra curricular seem more important than they actually are at a big box university like OSU.

The books are truly unnecessary, all the information can be found in the powerpoints. In terms of workload, it's fairly little. There are 2 easy midterms and a final; the only assignments are 4 essays (one of which is a rewrite). So actually there's very little writing. My instructor is Paul who's a fine instructor but he is such a stickler on the essays for 'style.' But in the end, there is a curve to make the class average a B- that helps."
OSU,33adrh,radical13,2,Mon Apr 20 23:17:48 2015 UTC,"Paul is an asshole. Got an A even after he told everyone on the first day, ""None of you will get better than a C in this class without the curve. You'll all probably struggle a lot with the material, plus I grade the papers ruthlessly."" Fuck him. That was the worst class I took here besides o-chem.  I'm sorry, I just have a strong opinion about him. Then again, this was two years ago so maybe he's become a better instructor since then. He was just very pompous and if you didn't agree with something he suggested you do to ""write better,"" you were likely to lose extra points for dumb reasons."
OSU,33adrh,AirJordanTS,2,Fri Apr 24 00:27:12 2015 UTC,"When I wrote he was a fine instructor, it sounded different from what I meant. I meant he was simply fine or okay, nothing to write home about.   I missed the first week so maybe he said that, I don't know. But he seems to have become less arrogant than he was 2 years ago.Class is still boring.

OSU,33989a,PrincessAnika,3,Mon Apr 20 17:38:44 2015 UTC,Depends on how cheap is cheap.  There is a hostel nearby that is $28/night and probably cheaper than any hotel you will find.  There are various AirBNB listings that will probably still be cheaper than most regular hotels.  And then there are a group of fairly inexpensive hotels on Olentangy River Road a couple miles north of campus. Any hotels downtown/short north will be more expensive.

Those are about a 15 minute drive from campus without traffic.  he Varsity Inn Hotel is $82 for the night of 5/17 - that's the cheapest hotel very close to campus.  There are a bunch of hotels in the Columbus area for $40-$60/night.  Use Kayak to find 'em, and cross-reference with Tripadvisor reviews to be sure they're not awful.  But I'd recommend Airbnb over a hotel.  You'll be closer and it'll be cheaper, though you won't always get breakfast like you would at most cheap hotels.  If you don't have an account yet, message me your email address - I can refer you, and we both get a $25 credit, which would pay for about half of your room near campus for one night."

I had entered Economics because I wanted to fight for the middle/working class against the system, but came to realize that it's very difficult to succeed as an economist unless you embrace the ""how can we justify tax cuts for billionaires"" policies that were more or less disproven decades ago.

OSU,335ji9,cwap4brains,4,Mon Apr 20 04:05:49 2015 UTC,"Economics isn't about fighting for any class. It's about taking the past and using that to model for the future and try to be more prepared. I also think it's safe to say that in 2007 the literature wasn't fully up to date. Any professor now will talk about the true causes of the recession.   I also think that you'll find most people take what they want from their schooling. People who already tend to lean left will find parts of economics to suit their needs, while people with conservative beliefs will do the same."
OSU,335ji9,gabmancy,-3,Mon Apr 20 03:09:23 2015 UTC,You have got to be kidding me. Colleges make up the most progressive demographic in the country. I would be thankful for ONE department to portray more conservative ideals.

OSU,330bqf,jperk51,20,Sat Apr 18 06:50:55 2015 UTC,"Department chair seems like the best option with everything you're saying... Just some words of advice that I would recommend however: Avoid using the phrase ""not fair"" and saying that what he's asking for would just be too hard with all the other classes you're taking. While it all may be true, it comes off as whiney. You're making a formal complaint to a department chair, make sure you're specific.   State that reasonable expectations of class conduct set forth by the syllabus are not being maintained.   Give specific dates the professor has cancelled class, stating that you tuition has been paid for this class and he has gone beyond a reasonable number of absences without proper substitute instruction.   Attach a copy of the class syllabus in order to show how the class activities and such appear to be a major factor in the class grade and are absent from the actual lectures. DO NOT tell the chair ""I thought it'd be ok to miss a day, but now I only have a 50%!"" Unless you have a doctors note for that day, an absence is an absence and that's none of their concern.   ...That's all I got. Good luck.   Edit: Words are hard."

OSU,330bqf,wweber,3,Sat Apr 18 16:41:11 2015 UTC,Yeah but as the prof he should tell the grader to get his ass in gear
OSU,330bqf,Kayvanian,2,Sat Apr 18 18:52:11 2015 UTC,"Was about to say the same. It was entirely inappropriate for him to give the first midterm grades back so late, especially since he said he had them graded before spring break.

If he is just a lecturer or TA, you can complain in the SEIs -- the administration will listen if enough people give negative feedback -- but only for low-tier faculty and staff members. Tenured professors are practically untouchable (unless they are doing something that could cause a lawsuit, like being sexually inappropriate, having relationships with students, discrimination, etc).

Two weeks later I get an email saying I'm on the do-not-rehire list because I did not give them notice...Which was clearly not true. Not too upset about it because of my working there, I realized I do not want to work for the university dining again. Now it's just a fun thing to sly-ly drop into conversation."

OSU,32x3us,spocksbutt,2,Fri Apr 17 19:02:04 2015 UTC,Probably not. I supervise students and only flag them as non-rehire if they have corrective action on file or they were exceptionally terrible at their jobs (see corrective action above.)  If you quit voluntarily this shouldn't be a problem. Just make sure you give 2 weeks' notice.

O-chem exams are never going to be straight forward like a math exam.  You have to spend extra time learning how mechanisms work and why electrons move the way they do.  As far as practice materials go, if you want to earn an A in the class I suggest you go to Dr. Callam's office in your free time and ask him to print out his homework assignments for you.  I don't recall Mattson providing a ton of extra material than what the book offers."

OSU,32trzi,zoro_kongari,5,Thu Apr 16 17:28:14 2015 UTC,"I'm an ME senior and I heavily recommend just doing summer internships if possible. I did 2 of them and I'm finishing in 4 years with as good of or better experience than a lot of my Co-op friends. So many of them screwed up their schedules and are stuck in a semester of only capstone or something, which is a waste of time and money. Just be smart about planning and meet with your advisor to go over all of it.   But it can be hard to find internships without some connections. I would ask classmates to see what they're doing in the summers and asking how they applied."
OSU,32trzi,InFury,6,Thu Apr 16 19:34:33 2015 UTC,"The ME department is not meant for co-oping. I repeat, the ME department is not favorable to co-ops.  From here on out 'on season' means you're taking a course where it is slotted in the bingo sheet, and 'off season' means you're not.   Some good things:   Each course less than 5000 is offered every semester.    The bad things:   No summer courses are offered (that count for anything) In the off season each course is offered exactly once compared to twice during the on season. On season classes have section sizes of 60 while off season sections are 120 (because they're offered once) That means you'll only fit in E001 You'll be trapped in E001 from 8-11 three days a week. Classes are only offered once, and the department likes to line them up in a row.  E001 is a terrible room The on season classes get the good professors. Or rather, you have the option to avoid the bad professors since there are two sections. In the off season be prepared for a whole lot of fun with Harper. At the start of your junior year, you can expect 2-3 semester long group projects every semester. If you co-op you just lost your network and your odds of getting duds go way up. These are long, grueling, projects. You want to be working with people you like, which you can't do if you co-oped and they didn't.  Capstone. Oh boy. You do not want to be in the off season Capstone. I repeat, you want to do anything in your power to be in the 'on season' before heading into your senior year.  On season Capstone options - Product Design w/ Lilly, Rehab w/ Metzler, Interdisciplinary w/ Rhoads, General Capstone with Luscher Off season Capstone options - General w/ Luscher. If you're in the 'off season' you're stuck with the department's finest - Dr. Anthony Luscher. This dude. I can't even explain it. You want to avoid him at all costs. He's been fired once and rumor is he's about to get let go for a second time. But he may still be around when you get here. I thought people were crazy for delaying graduation to avoid this man. If I could do it over, I would delay graduation a semester to get back to the 'on season' and avoid him.    If you do co-op, I recommend co-oping a spring of sophomore year and then spring of your junior year to get back to the 'on season' for your senior year so you can avoid the general capstone.  I didn't even touch on the grad school side of things. If you co-op just once, you're going to have a December graduation. Fellowships and grad school admissions are not setup to favor December graduates. You need to co-op twice by your senior year so you have a spring graduation for fellowship & grad school admissions."

You may not even be thinking that far down the road, but you either get all of the above options, or the general projects. Personally, I like having choices.  That being said, if there's a company you're dying to work for and they only do co-ops and not summer internships, it might be the right choice to get your foot in the door."

OSU,32t5q9,mtjess60,0,Thu Apr 16 14:53:49 2015 UTC,... but last semester I was told there was no curve (by the professor) and I got curved all the way up to the next threshold...
OSU,32t5q9,mtjess60,4,Thu Apr 16 14:57:55 2015 UTC,"Sometimes things happen departmentally, sometimes it varies based on the exam results. If you ask, you'll probably receive a better answer than you'll find on here."
OSU,32t5q9,Kayvanian,1 point,Thu Apr 16 15:00:31 2015 UTC,"I've taken (and retaken...) 1172, and they always say they won't curve and/or are quiet about it - but there usually is at least some sort of curve by adjusting the grading scale, depending on how grades look at the end."
OSU,32t5q9,cookiemonster1020,2,Thu Apr 16 20:50:46 2015 UTC,"You professor doesn't decide. It's up to the course coordinator. But really, it is up to all of you. The scales are adjusted slightly for parity with previous semesters. The large population size (>500 people take it each semester) means that the overall distribution of scores pre-curving is remarkably stable - so don't count on much of a curve."
OSU,32t5q9,comic6u,1 point,Thu Apr 16 16:39:52 2015 UTC,They don't curve people. They adjust the grading scales. EX. 65 is C- instead of 70.
OSU,32t5q9,aevans395,1 point,Thu Apr 16 15:03:32 2015 UTC,sitting on a 68% right now that gives me hope
OSU,32t5q9,casact921,1 point,Thu Apr 16 15:42:48 2015 UTC,"I'll agree with those posters in the thread that are telling you that it depends on your instructor. Most everyone in the math department sets their grading scale at the beginning of the semester and intends to stick to that grading scale at the end of the course. If there are circumstances throughout the course that indicate that the posted grading scale is a poor indicator of  student achievement (e.g. an unreasonable midterm, an unusually low homework average, etc etc), the instructor may decide to depart from that grading scale. Or not.  Just do as well as you can for the remainder of the semester. Maybe you'll get a better grade than what the posted grading scale indicates, maybe not. There's nothing you can do to predict or change that outcome, so spend your energy on the part you can change, which is you own mastery of the material. I wish you all the best!"
OSU,32t5q9,Fasan,1 point,Thu Apr 16 15:04:55 2015 UTC,Some professor like to tell students there is no curve when they really intend to give one. It's so the students work hard to achieve the good grades rather than rely on a curve and my work as hard as they should. Math department doesn't curve they just change around the grade scale.
OSU,32t5q9,comic6u,0,Thu Apr 16 16:27:13 2015 UTC,"That I don't know the answer to. Anytime I've asked a professor about it, they say it comes from the department.  They probably have to pass a certain amount of people and adjust the scale that way."

OSU,32prib,OminousLatinWord,2,Wed Apr 15 18:55:13 2015 UTC,I thought CIS was also switching to 3.2. Am I incorrect?
OSU,32prib,Nefari0uss,2,Wed Apr 15 19:06:36 2015 UTC,Yes but it doesn't matter. It's a 3.0 this semester (so theoretically if you have CSE requirements but not CIS you could do this just Vice versa. But I can't imagine that happens often
OSU,32prib,Nefari0uss,0,Wed Apr 15 19:08:34 2015 UTC,"Isn't CSE also 3.0? I see no difference in applying to CSE or CIS. If they both have the same requirements to get in now and both will require the same GPA of 3.2  to get in following this summer, how is this beneficial? Have I missed something?"
OSU,32prib,Nefari0uss,5,Wed Apr 15 19:17:11 2015 UTC,"Because in my situation, I can't apply to CSE because I haven't taken the second Fundamentals of Engineering course. I would have to wait until next semester when the requirement is a 3.2 to apply. This way, I can just transfer in without that stupid 3.2.  edit: what you're missing is that they don't have the same requirements."

OSU,32qlcl,wch94,2,Thu Apr 16 00:32:14 2015 UTC,"I'm considering it. It seems like the Math Dept writes midterms to test you on oddball rules. Instead of a question on the midterm involving normal integration, it had to do with integrating 24/x or e4/x or some nonsense. It's irritating that all the work you put into studying can be truncated because they ask a question about one specific case that's different. Sure I should know that stuff, but when there are only like 5 questions on the exam, it seems ridiculous that one little rule like that can ruin my grade."

I can tell you that you're either going to get a dorm with two people, or a short walk to class, but not both. North and West have 4+ people in a room/suite while south has 2. South is a longer walk than North and about the same as West. South is more social while North is quieter.   I've lived on both North and South. My advice is to live on South. If you want to get work done, the dorm is not the place to do it. Go to the library between classes. If you do this, the longer walk to class (it isn't that much longer, and it's scenic) isn't an issue. North is really quiet and when you do want to have fun, not much is happening."

It would have been more than a month between my first appointment and my next one. By that point, I was discouraged and stopped trying to get help.

OSU,32m25e,nowseekingsomething,2,Wed Apr 15 01:01:07 2015 UTC,I'm sorry to hear you didn't get the help you needed. Have others had similar issues with CCS? I can let them know that people are having problems if you want to provide any more context or info about what happened.
OSU,32m25e,DarthZillah,5,Wed Apr 15 03:30:29 2015 UTC,I can second this. My gf does a lot of mental health awareness and I've discussed with her extensively how many people can't get access to our support systems.  I suggest adding access questions to the next Climate Survey that osu puts out.
OSU,32m25e,Na__th__an,2,Wed Apr 15 05:03:49 2015 UTC,Thank you to everyone who has expressed concern in this thread.  My experience with CCS has always been smooth and I was very surprised to hear that this was not the norm.  I emailed the director of CCS and mentioned that people are having a lot of problems.
OSU,32m25e,webbed_feets,2,Wed Apr 15 13:52:12 2015 UTC,"I tried to get help from them two years ago. After having found out an initial assesment appointment was weeks away, there was only a few months left in the semester until I left campus, so it wasn't worth the hassle and I seeked counseling outside of OSU, where I could actually get an appointment to see somebody. Luckily, I have a car and live nearby so transportation isn't an issue.  My girlfriend had the same experience. She was actually scheduled for an initial assessment appointment within a week, but afterwards the next appointment available was months away. She has no transportation and hasn't been able to find anyone to go to, so she's gone without any counseling despite actively seeking it out, with health insurance.  Meanwhile Drake goes on All Sides With Ann Fisher and talks about how great our counseling and mental health services are.  Sorry, I'm pretty jaded about OSU."
OSU,32m25e,toomanyblocks,2,Wed Apr 15 23:53:57 2015 UTC,"Yes. Both times I wanted an appointment the wait was so long (around 4-6 weeks) that I didn't make the appointment. The first time I didn't seek any help and the second I went to a place off campus.  It makes me mad when I see posts like this. You're right that we have help available, but good luck actually getting it when you need it."
OSU,32m25e,PlatonicEgg,2,Wed Apr 15 16:33:46 2015 UTC,"I really just wanted to add this in here:  CCS is currently swamped. I have had a great experience with CCS but I got an appointment quickly due to medical attention I received. The people there are so kind and helpful, but it is unfortunate that people can't get in.   But, there are actually a lot of other resources people are not hearing about in the midst of concentrating only of CCS. Here are some of them:  The Dennis Learning Center can help with lack of motivation and stress related to schoolwork. Google them and get number to set up an appointment.   CCS also does Support Groups. You will have to do a screening to get into a support group though, which I don't know how long will take. They range from exploring identity and the self to relationships or drug abuse.   BART, or the Bias Assessment and Response team can help you if you feel you were the victim of bias, prejudice, etc., or simply want to learn more about it or speak to someone on the subject.   If you live in a dorm, your hall advisors are actually trained to listen to students and help advise them as well as find other resources to help them.   If you identify as LBGTQ and feel you are dealing with stress due to this, the Multicultural Center has resources to provide a safe space and someone (or a group of people) to talk to.   If you are disabled or feel you need some mental health days, you can contact Disability Services, or call Student Advocacy, which is located in Lincoln Tower. In fact, if you're confused at all and just feel you need help, call student advocacy and speak to an advocate. They can almost surely lead you in the right direction.   Outside of OSU, you can call the Ohio Suicide Prevention Foundation and they may direct you to services within Columbus that could help you.  Finally, Suicide Prevention Hotlines: they will talk to you in times of crisis and even if you don't feel like you are going to harm yourself, someone is on the line to listen. The national number 1-800-273-TALK. Franklin Country prevention hotline is 614-221-5445. Veterans Crisis line is 1-800-273-8255. The Trevor Project hotline for gay/lesbian (and everything in between) or questioning youth is 1-866-488-7386. I think there is also a line for spanish speakers, people dealing with bullies, etc. Everyone is trained to listen and help you.   Don't give up on your first try, guys. I know it is discouraging. In points like that in your life, you also might have no motivation. But don't tell yourself you can't get help because there is no one to help you. There is. Good luck friends."

OSU,32m25e,Nefari0uss,1 point,Thu Apr 16 04:51:58 2015 UTC,I got help there and it was a good experience in general. I never needed immediate help though but my counsellor gave me appointment any week I wanted.   She was also an intern so that might have something to do with it.
OSU,32m25e,mws614,1 point,Wed Apr 15 16:45:21 2015 UTC,I've considered calling many times to make an appointment but the thought of having to wait a large period of time to get help always puts me off. :/ I'm sure OSU does realize that the demand for the services is far greater then the resources they currently have to deal with it and it's probably safe to presume that they're working on it.   I've heard generally fantastic things about the service from people who have had some sessions.
OSU,32p6jn,cracktal,3,Wed Apr 15 16:20:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, both online and in-person classes tend to be much easier at CSCC. I spent 3 years there.  And yes, take Math at CSCC. The professors are much more personal and fair to the classroom. I've taken all of my Math classes at CSCC.   And the credits transfer for anything above a C/C- from CSCC, but the GPA does not. So the GPA at CSCC won't affect your OSU gpa. Once the final grades are posted at CSCC, you just have them send the transcript to OSU and boom, you have credit for that class."
OSU,32p6jn,Timeout19,2,Wed Apr 15 19:50:01 2015 UTC,"I am doing this exact thing. I'm taking Physics and Engineering Calc at CSCC because OSUs physics and math departments are stupid hard. Correct only the credit transfers not the GPA which in yours and my case is good. For online classes, my experience is that if you don't take them as serious as a normal in person class that you could fall behind fast and not do as good as you probably would have had you taken it in person."
OSU,32p6jn,wch94,2,Wed Apr 15 17:30:56 2015 UTC,"I did this. CSCC is significantly easier than OSU. It's a community college -- many people there have their GRE, are adult learners, people who failed out of a traditional university, people with kids...so the classes are slower paced to accommodate a more diverse student body. I will say that CSCC's math dept is EXCELLENT. The professors there really do care. I liked CSCC a lot. So affordable, too."

OSU,32memd,uniquely_average,4,Tue Apr 14 23:21:49 2015 UTC,"The honors program will allow you to take more upper level classes but overall won't make you any more likely to get into medical school. Since you are a biology major, you would be taking upper level classes anyways. But some honors classes are nice and small, so take advantage of that if you go that route.  Medical schools care about science and overall GPAs and MCAT scores, followed by your personal statement, letters of recommendation, volunteer work, research, special conditions like URM.   Try /r/premed, they can be helpful with the nitty-gritty. Student Doctor Network can be helpful too, but be careful since some are downright immodest, don't need any help getting in or aren't a good benchmark for how you will do.  Also, Brenda Dinan is the de facto premed advisor for OSU Arts and Sciences and she is an absolute godsend.  My two cents."
OSU,32memd,nevertricked,4,Wed Apr 15 01:06:47 2015 UTC,"Honestly, the other posters are clueless. Unless things have changed since I graduated a few years ago, you'd be an idiot not to at least start out in the honors program.  Reasons to be in honors:   Priority scheduling - meaning only athletes are higher priority than you, this is a tremendous benefit Option of taking honors classes or living in an honors dorm Can graduate with honors on your diploma if you fulfill whatever your department's requirements are, usually nothing too crazy   Reasons not to be in honors:   Literally none   There are nothing but benefits there for you to take, and there is no obligation to do any of them if you decide they are not worthwhile.  Let me clarify, you do not have to take honors classes, live in an honors dorm, or do anything else to start in the honors program.  Ultimately if you want to graduate with honors you'll need to meet certain requirements but it's a nice thing on your diploma and resume.  If you end up getting a low GPA and getting kicked out of the honors program or just deciding not to continue, at least you got priority registration and other benefits while they lasted, and it didn't cost you any extra effort.  Other thoughts: I lived in an honors dorm and it was OK.  Made some good friends, it was a little quieter than the typical south campus dorm but now all the dorms are totally different so my experience is probably not relevant.    Ultimately, if you're going for med school (I'm actually in med school now), I would highly recommend starting honors and finishing in it.  Realistically you're shooting for a 3.5 GPA minimum to get in med school (along with a strong MCAT) and it happens to be around the honors requirement anyway, so you might as well kill two birds with one stone.  I did some honors classes and always liked them, but never did any science/pre-med classes in honors since GPA is king as a pre-med and I didn't want to risk tougher classes."
OSU,32memd,chewtrident,2,Wed Apr 15 01:58:56 2015 UTC,but never did any science/pre-med classes in honors since GPA is king as a pre-med and I didn't want to risk tougher classes.   I think I may end up doing just this. Thanks a ton! I didn't realize there were no obligations besides the GPA requirement.
OSU,32memd,chewtrident,2,Wed Apr 15 02:05:33 2015 UTC,"Maybe I wasn't clear.  If you want to graduate with honors, you will have various requirements besides GPA.  Research thesis, maybe some amount of honors classes, etc.  It varies by department and could be totally different now than when I graduated.  But you can start in honors and reap the benefits until they kick you out, so there is absolutely no reason not to at least begin as an honors student.  Although if you're pre-med you should be trying to kick ass at every opportunity."

For instance, you don't need to do the freshman honors chemistry course. I've heard some horror stories. If you want to, fine, but gen chem will be enough."
OSU,32memd,xam2y,1 point,Wed Apr 15 05:15:06 2015 UTC,This is what I did. Took advantage of the priority scheduling and never bothered caring about any of the actual requirements. Just used it while I could and it was super nice.

OSU,32lflq,letsgetbuckedup,3,Tue Apr 14 19:00:33 2015 UTC,"I did. When we switched from quarters to semesters, I was in pre-engineering still getting a bunch of my pre-requisites.  I was enrolled in a calc class that was for people that started the series on quarters and was finishing the last class that semester.  Previously, when on quarters, the requirement was that you could take the calc class concurrently with Mechanical Engineering Statics (ME 410 on qtrs, ME 2010 on semesters) but when the semester switch happened, the new curriculum said it was a Pre-requisite instead.  My advisor said I needed to take that calc class and take ME 2010, but I told her that the scheduling system wouldn't allow me to, so she added it for me.  Well, come mid semester, I was already doing poorly in my classes and decided I no longer wanted to be an engineer for a variety of reasons and was already looking to switch majors.  I finished the semester by failing statics (I tried to pass, I didn't tank on purpose) and tried to schedule classes for the next term.  It was then that I discovered that calc was a pre-req.  On paper, I wasn't qualified to take statics because I hadn't completed the pre-req, so I filed an appeal to remove my failing grade for statics and they approved it.  My argument was based upon confusion between quarter to semester switch and old to new curriculum.  My advisor was supposed to know of the pre-requisite but used her scheduling powers to override it anyways.  tl;dr: appeal approved. quarter to semester switch made things confusing, which didn't help my already crappy GPA."

OSU,32hc8w,MackMizzo,14,Mon Apr 13 20:47:51 2015 UTC,"The article does say that's their plan. Whether or not they will be allowed to implement said plan or if campus security will kindly ask them to fuck off, I don't know. There are little old grannies in tour groups walking through the Oval for God's sake, they don't want to be watching a 3 month old fetus being removed from a girl."

As long as they don't get violent, campus security can't ask them to leave. That being said - it also means that anyone else has their 1st amendment right to protest, as long as it's kept non-violent."
OSU,32hc8w,boomfarmer,12,Mon Apr 13 22:54:19 2015 UTC,"It's public property   It's university property, and people have been banned from campus before. Campus security can politely ask them to leave and can forcibly ask them to leave."
OSU,32hc8w,BenjaminTalam,4,Tue Apr 14 00:28:34 2015 UTC,Didn't a guy get banned from campus for being a seduction artist last year?
OSU,32hc8w,BenjaminTalam,8,Tue Apr 14 01:54:44 2015 UTC,"That guy was like a legitimate threat to women though. He was harassing women on and off campus. And was posting pictures of them online after he ""seduced"" (read: tricked them whilst drunk) them into sleeping with him. Dude was a fuckin creep, thank God he's gone."
OSU,32hc8w,TrueBlonde,-2,Tue Apr 14 02:07:25 2015 UTC,"While I am happy he's gone, he was enabled by many (the women who accepted his advances and hooked up with him) and there are plenty where he came from populating campus and especially fraternities. There are bad people in the world and he was one of many, I suspect the only reason he was dealt with was because he wasn't a student.   I think having abortion videos shown to me is violating my space and could be seen as threatening in a sense though. It's a disruption of my life and is also very damaging to women who have had to deal with abortion at some point or another."
OSU,32hc8w,spring45,11,Tue Apr 14 02:13:50 2015 UTC,"Holy shit, blame the victim much? Shashonk would take girls back to his apartment, secretly video tape them while they hooked up, and post the video on a facebook page for other people to see. The girls were NOT enabling him, because they had no idea they were being secretly filmed and exploited.  That's like saying a female wearing a skirt is enabling men to take upskirt photos."
OSU,32hc8w,BenjaminTalam,2,Tue Apr 14 13:33:59 2015 UTC,Took the words right out of my mouth.
OSU,32hc8w,TrueBlonde,-3,Tue Apr 14 13:46:20 2015 UTC,"It sure didn't take much to get them back to his place though did it? Nothing he did is excusable, he's trash. But some girls would never end up in bed with a guy like him, whose style is obvious, while others will because they are just that type of girl. If no one responded to his advances he wouldn't be very successful would he? And he'd change his lifestyle to achieve more success. Demand better of people and you'll get it. Same way frat guys would respect women more if sororities refused to associate with them the second they got close to being out of line. But free booze is more important and obviously what these guys do works because they get laid all the fucking time and have no reason to stop what clearly works and is tolerated."
OSU,32hc8w,boomfarmer,10,Tue Apr 14 13:45:54 2015 UTC,"Why aren't you blaming him for being a skeeze? Why is it the girl's fault? He targets girl that are intoxicated. They aren't capable of making informed decisions. And don't you dare say that it's their fault for drinking. The blame is ENTIRELY on him for purposely looking for drunk girls, bringing them back to his place, and filming them."
OSU,32hc8w,BenjaminTalam,9,Tue Apr 14 13:51:19 2015 UTC,"is violating my space   I get what you're saying, but in the eyes of the law, the Oval is as much your space as it is theirs. It's public space.  If you want to go after them for showing  videos, see if OSU has granted them permits for erecting structures, staking things into the lawn, providing power, allowing the running of generators, and so on."
OSU,32hc8w,buckeyelaw,3,Tue Apr 14 03:08:32 2015 UTC,That is a very good way to go about trying to shut them down without making it a freedom of expression issue.
OSU,32hc8w,therealabefrohman,2,Tue Apr 14 03:29:54 2015 UTC,"If Ohio State has allowed other groups to use projectors, stake things in the ground, etc., to express a message than Ohio State could face a lawsuit for viewpoint discrimination if they would not allow this group to do the same. I don't know if Ohio State has allowed these types of activities for expressive means so the litigation would hinge on what other groups have been able to do on the oval in the past."
OSU,32hc8w,BenjaminTalam,3,Tue Apr 14 17:31:08 2015 UTC,You wouldn't be saying that if you were one of the women he harassed. He was scary.
OSU,32hc8w,TrueBlonde,0,Tue Apr 14 14:15:03 2015 UTC,"If he scared you and you're one of the people who helped get him off campus you're a different type of girl than the girls who slept with him who obviously weren't scared unless being scared is a fetish of theirs. Like I said, some are victims and some aren't. This isn't to say that someone can't be randomly victimized, of course they can. But the first person his tactics worked on led to him continuing to use those tactics. He's a product of his environment. As am I, and you. We're shaped by how others react to us."
OSU,32hc8w,EvanStoner,7,Tue Apr 14 14:38:23 2015 UTC,"The problem isn't that the girls slept with a douche. The problem is that they were secretly filmed and exploited. That makes them all victims, even if they chose to sleep with him. They did not choose to be filmed and have the video distributed.  If you cross the street without looking and get hit by a car, it doesn't mean that you wanted to get hit by a car."
OSU,32hc8w,BenjaminTalam,5,Tue Apr 14 14:59:37 2015 UTC,"Especially fraternities seems to generalize a tad, no?"
OSU,32hc8w,astrobuckeye,-1,Tue Apr 14 03:08:34 2015 UTC,"Statistically you're more likely to be taken advantage of at a frat event than a non frat event. I suppose saying ""especially"" is a bit harsh when it's more of being a very large university where there's the college party mentality driving both male and female students to end up in questionable scenarios more so than just fraternities by nature."
OSU,32hc8w,OtotheHtotheItotheO,1 point,Tue Apr 14 03:27:35 2015 UTC,"I agree but it's a much harder line to draw than a guy essentially stalking individual girls and violating their privacy and identity. I hope the university can end this quickly but who knows, they may have to stand by just like they do with any of the fire and brimstone preachers who tell me I'm going to hell on the way to midterms."
OSU,32hc8w,starrynight12,5,Tue Apr 14 02:17:09 2015 UTC,When I was in the University never stopped that sort of shit. They'd put up wall sized photos of abortions and genocide victims. The fall out from trying to stop this shitheads is less painful then letting them run their course. You'd just attract a ton more protesters by trying to stop it.
OSU,32hc8w,smartfbrankings,3,Tue Apr 14 01:19:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, what would happen if people reported them to campus security for making them feel unsafe/triggered (which I mean sincerely, as these pictures and footage are deeply disturbing)?"

OSU,32hc8w,okthisisgettingridic,5,Mon Apr 13 23:20:15 2015 UTC,Showing capital punishments is probably the fastest way to end that practice.  That's actually a good idea.

OSU,32hc8w,OSU_CSM,8,Tue Apr 14 00:42:11 2015 UTC,"Find something more positive to do with your time!   They do this because they think the world will end, and because they care about you so much that they're willing to use whatever tactics possible to make sure that you don't go to a bad place when the world ends.  Or, if they're not religious, they're placing a very high value on life, but not a very high value on mental stability."

OSU,32hc8w,agler,2,Tue Apr 14 19:05:16 2015 UTC,Seriously? Based on what? It's not like they rented that space or something.  Wouldn't you have just as much of a right to be in that space doing exactly what you wanted as they had?
OSU,32hc8w,BluesisRed,2,Tue Apr 14 21:10:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah seriously, and we were violating their 1st amendment right, apparently"

If someone is shouting/preaching on the oval and someone goes near that person with a bullhorn to shout something else, is that violating the shouter's free speech? They didn't rent the space. You had just as much of right to be there doing whatever you wanted just like they did. I think the cop just felt like he had to do something because they were called."

OSU,32hc8w,misteryub,4,Tue Apr 14 14:27:00 2015 UTC,The first amendment does not protect against protesting that is obscene. How would this not be considered obscene?
OSU,32hc8w,okthisisgettingridic,4,Tue Apr 14 00:19:26 2015 UTC,What's the legal definition of obscenity?
OSU,32hc8w,boomfarmer,6,Tue Apr 14 00:29:05 2015 UTC,"Brief research shows that it is obscene if the following is true:   The basic guidelines for the trier of fact must be: (a) whether the average person, applying contemporary community standards would find that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest, (b) whether the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law; and (c) whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.   So it seems that's out."
OSU,32hc8w,okthisisgettingridic,-1,Tue Apr 14 01:20:17 2015 UTC,"Right. I just wish Drake would do something to not allow these kinds of protests on campus, somehow. Perhaps mandate protest permits to be reviewed by a panel of elected OSU faculty members. No one on campus enjoys these demonstrations, so why not make a rule for what the majority wants?"
OSU,32hc8w,boomfarmer,12,Tue Apr 14 00:52:03 2015 UTC,"Because as a facility of higher education, free speech rights are held sacrosanct, or something like that. What if the majority wanted to ban wearing blue? Or to ban students from Michigan? OSU isn't about forcing people to conform.  On a different tack, do you really want student organizations to have to apply for permits to protest? Okay, so you exempt student organizations, but now you're clearly targeting people outside the university that come to protest, and since it seems like the only non-OSU org that protests at OSU are anti-abortion people, perhaps you're specifically targeting them and placing a burden on their speech? As a state school, any actions it takes to curtail free speech are subject to higher scrutiny in courts of law and in the court of public opinion."
OSU,32hc8w,smartfbrankings,2,Tue Apr 14 01:09:12 2015 UTC,"Ok, so get rid of my stupid idea. Nobody wants these people on campus, so is there nothing that can be done? What if dead baby pictures happened every day at every corner? Still ok because of free speech and public school?"
OSU,32hc8w,okthisisgettingridic,3,Tue Apr 14 01:47:44 2015 UTC,Take the Westboro Baptist Church approach:   Volunteers interpose themselves between anti-abortionists and crowds Volunteers drown out anti-abortionists Volunteers provide warnings of graphic material on Oval so that sensitive people will know to reroute Volunteers politely and courteously let the anti-abortionists know that they are unwelcome.

I'm no college smartypants, but I think that's the definition of irony."
OSU,32hc8w,YohanAnthony,3,Tue Apr 14 03:40:23 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure that's the case.  They are going for shock value and emotional response.

As others have said, it can get seedy east of Summit, however I think you'll be fine as long as you don't go beyond 4th St. Beyond that is definitely the ghetto. Plus it's near the fairgrounds and it's generally a more industrial area  To the South, I'd say you're okay west of High from 11th (South boundary of campus) all the way down to about King. After that you're out of the medical campus area and it gets a little seedier even well into the Short North."

The Greyhound in Indy is right by the football stadium which if I'm not mistaken isn't really close to the school. Just look at the city bus routes, I bet one ends up there."
OSU,32h6bf,IamWoldo,3,Mon Apr 13 21:19:11 2015 UTC,I used to take the Megabus to Indy all of the time. I usually got on at Nationwide just to guarantee myself a decent seat. (It is the stop BEFORE OSU and you can just take the #2 there from campus.)  I've taken the Greyhound before and it is sort of shady. The station is in a weird area (in Indy) and a gentleman warned me that it wasn't the safest area. Just a heads up on that one.   My advice would be to take the Megabus from Columbus to Indy and just grab an Uber once you are there. Greyhound is usually more expensive and Megabus has Wifi. Plus the clientele on Megabus needed some sort of credit card to buy a ticket whereas the Greyhound folk can pay in cash. (And sometimes you can get like dollar Megabus tickets.)

OSU,32h6bf,yayosu,2,Tue Apr 14 01:09:29 2015 UTC,I used to sleep most of the ride. They stop around the Ohio/Indiana border. The stop in Indy is right outside of the courthouse but I think there is a PitaPit or something nearby where you could go and get an Uber from there.   A friend of mine bought a bunch of one-way $1 tickets when there was a flash sale. She didn't end up using them all but it still worked out to be less than what she normally paid for a one-way. She would then book the return bus ride to Columbus when she knew that she was going out there for the weekend.
OSU,32h6bf,toomanyblocks,2,Tue Apr 14 01:18:36 2015 UTC,"Hey, I'm from Indiana and I take that Greyhound bus a lot. The Greyhound kind of sucks, but it works. It will stop in Dayton so it takes longer than a drive on your own does. It always stops in Dayton. The Greyhound station in Indy is gross, the one in Columbus is fine. Try not to bring a bunch of shit. If you buy tickets online ahead of time it is cheaper than buying it in person.   The Greyhound station in Indy is right in downtown and probably a good 15minute drive from Butler. Keep that in mind. IndyGo (the public transport) isn't wonderful. I have never taken the Megabus but I heard it's less roomy. Can't really say from experience.   There is also a bus that goes to Muncie but it leaves in the early morning. It might be a quicker ride if it's possible that she can meet you in the middle, or if she has friends that go to Ball State.  Facetime a lot! Give each other space when the other asks! Call more. Text less. Long distance sucks. Best of luck."

OSU,32dr9v,bsilvereagle,15,Sun Apr 12 23:51:00 2015 UTC,Sadly the hopes of the tens of thousands of students will mean nothing. The cost of off campus living absolutely will inflate alongside the on campus rate.
OSU,32dr9v,Meaninglessnme,20,Mon Apr 13 00:22:46 2015 UTC,Don't be so sure. Let's not forget campus landlords are suddenly going to be missing an entire sophomore renter base. Supply will shoot up overnight.
OSU,32dr9v,MackMizzo,8,Mon Apr 13 00:43:41 2015 UTC,"In the short term the supply will mitigate the price increase of a replacement good; but, long term, the students living off campus will become a captured market whom will have their surplus extracted."

At what point does OSU transition from an institution of education to a profit machine? I'm not even talking about academics, I'm talking about nonsensical bs like giant meal plans, shared dorm rooms that cost as much as the luxury Gateway apartments, and now they have to participate in these money-making schemes for twice as long? Where does it end?"
OSU,32dr9v,Iyoten,10,Mon Apr 13 02:16:03 2015 UTC,"This isn't isolated to OSU. Schools are now competing more and more for students and they do so through better dorms, dining options, and student services but of course that all comes at a price. It stops when students stop applying."
OSU,32dr9v,The64only,1 point,Mon Apr 13 03:48:21 2015 UTC,"Competing for students is not what these dorms are about. We have been getting 40k applications with no expectations of luxurious freshman accommodations. This is purely about ego and the university wanting to be able to show off these buildings, pat themselves on the back, and then ask for more money."
OSU,32dr9v,Meaninglessnme,6,Mon Apr 13 04:54:42 2015 UTC,"It's most certainly about competing for students. OSU has been making a push to make attract higher caliber students and more of them. Also, applications have gone up ~33% since OSU started improving dorms and student life facilities and we only breached 40,000 since last year after OSU had already started seriously investing in student life.  Considering what new amenities students have access to and how much dining services have improved (trust me, the only options used to be something the level of Morrill Commons, things have improved drastically), the price adjustment is reasonable. The only thing really being debated is if it is what current students want."
OSU,32dr9v,The64only,5,Mon Apr 13 05:05:56 2015 UTC,"What they're ""adding"" to the ""student experience"" is a bunch of crap that we don't need. So they can justify turning around and hiking costs every other year.   This is a public land grant university not a theme park."

OSU,32dr9v,Mshotts,2,Mon Apr 13 17:53:09 2015 UTC,The above message has been brought to you by Nationwide.
OSU,32dr9v,Cactusbiter,1 point,Mon Apr 13 18:59:19 2015 UTC,"It's up for debate whether OSU students want another dining facility and it's especially unfortunate for those that enrolled prior to the construction of some of these facilities and do not desire these things.  But I don't understand the logic exemplified by the excerpt below:   So they can justify turning around and hiking costs every other year.   Where do you think the price increase is going to if not facility improvements? It's not as if they're hiking up costs and administrators are just taking money out of the pot. It's plain and simple where the money is going, why do you assume they need to use facility improvements to ""justify"" room and board hikes? This seems to be the most under explained conspiracy theory in this thread."
OSU,32dr9v,The64only,-1,Tue Apr 14 06:41:59 2015 UTC,"Correlation is not causation here. There are many factors that could influence applications aside from improving dorms; I say this as a student who decided to apply in the years during which these increases took place. I don't know a single person who applied because of the supposedly improving dorms.  Obviously I got a bit dogmatic saying this is purely about one thing or another, but I do believe that an attempt at attracting higher quality students through moderately nicer dorms at very steep prices is misguided to the point of being ineptitude if true. After all, if these are top students, they will have other appealing options and will notice the considerable costs of room and board along with the mandate to live in said room."
OSU,32dr9v,Meaninglessnme,8,Mon Apr 13 05:16:57 2015 UTC,"It may not be a deciding factor for students but it definitely helps. Administrators don't sit around thinking up plans to waste more student dollars and see how they can beat the administrators of other schools and it would not be of financial gain to the university to invest in student life if future students didn't want the amenities.  Walking around campus as a junior/senior in high school and seeing the RPAC, Ohio Union, Sloopy's, Marketplace, Kennedy Commons, Res on 10th/the new dorms being built on North Campus vs the old campus that had Baker Commons (think very generic cafeteria food with little choices), dorms without A/C and communal bathrooms straight out of the 80's is most certainly a difference. It is naive to think that students do not factor in dorms, food options, etc when they make their college selection. If it wasn't a factor then there would be far fewer reasons to take a campus tour.  Look at how Apple markets, they sell you on how your life will be changed and that's the strategy OSU is going for. As a student, you will be borderline pampered compared to attending a school like Miami University that is well respected academically but does not even come close to the student life experience at OSU.  EDIT: If you don't believe me maybe you will believe the New York Times who wrote about the topic just when schools, including OSU, had just started to ramp up student life improvements.  It's actually somewhat ironic as they quoted Gordon Gee in the piece and yet here we are having this discussion.   At the Ohio State University, President E. Gordon Gee declared the era of “Taj Mahal-like” dormitories and academic buildings over.  “There is no one who likes to build more than me,” said Mr. Gee, who took over at Ohio State in 2007 and is the highest paid president of any public college. Debt has grown roughly 70 percent since then, to $2 billion. “The reality is, that is what got us in trouble.”"

OSU,32dr9v,Devman90,6,Mon Apr 13 03:39:00 2015 UTC,There is no way this kind of cost increase is sustainable. At some point the benefit of college will not outweigh student loan debts and people are going to stop applying.
OSU,32dr9v,steve_jahbs,2,Mon Apr 13 16:18:58 2015 UTC,Many people are already talking about federally subsidized tuition which could easily allow further tuition inflation.

As far as rethinking your entire life, if CSE is what you want to do, don't give up due to one class. That being said, even with previous incidents considered, if 1148 is difficult, you will probably find later math classes (especially the more theoretical ones they have you do for some code/logic-y knowledge) quite challenging.  Again though, don't give up on what you want to do just yet. I'm not sure about Newark campus, but Columbus campus has the MSLC, a math/stat tutoring center open many hours a week. If you plan on transferring, that's a possible resource for a future attempt. You also said you commute from Columbus, so maybe you could find time to visit main campus for some tutoring? There are also great online resources like Khan Academy. Finally, you may need to get more organized, I doubt that make-up date was only made available the day before and never lose track of your calculator if you're taking a math course!

It's a long shot, but I don't think you have any other options.      If you do move forward, you have some decisions to make.   My life is set on to major in CSE but these costly setbacks have put a toll on me not only academically but mentally throwing me into deep depression making me rethink my entire life.   How much do you want a CSE degree?  Enough to prioritize it above everything else in your life?     I was told the makeup exam was at 8am on a Monday, normally that's not so bad, but I was told that the day before and was in Kentucky visiting friends.  2 hours of sleep and a 4 hour car ride later I scrape up a 50/100   Did you choose to stay in Kentucky to hang out with friends, rather than heading right back to Columbus to get rest and study time for your exam when you found out when the make-up exam was?  If math doesn't come easy for you, and you want to major in CSE, then you're going to have to prioritize school above all else.  That's what your next 4 years are going to be like."

OSU,32e29h,bananaboyz1,3,Mon Apr 13 00:54:39 2015 UTC,"I'm also a sophomore CSE student. Took SOCIOL 3302 last semester, and am currently in ECE, Stats, and Systems.   Is Sociology 3302 with Scarrow? If so, great teacher, interesting lectures, and very easy to get an A in. Just attend class, follow the content, and you'll be set. You'll be watching movies a lot of the time. If ECE 2000 is with Clymer, the material and homework may be challenging, and the labs can take a bit of time, but the midterms are very, very easy - they're more or less exactly the same as the practice midterms he gives you, so it should be easy to get an A (not to mention you get a cheat sheet on the exam). I'll have to wait and see how the final goes. Stats can be tough...there's a lot of content to cover, but as long as you do the homework and practice problems, you should be set for an A or B. I made the mistake of under-preparing for my first midterm and go a low C. For my teacher's tests, you also got a cheatsheet (front and back), which really helps. Systems is challenging, but interesting. It largely depends on the teacher you get, as they tend to vary a lot in how they cover the content and how they test. I have Finn, who is challenging and a bit wild on the topics he covers. Tests are tough, and I've spent the longest nights studying for it, but but he's supposed to curve well and has easy HW and projects. Must be hard to get an A, but it shouldn't be too hard to get a B. Other teachers (Babic...), you'll want to start sending up prayers."
OSU,32e29h,Kayvanian,1 point,Mon Apr 13 01:05:10 2015 UTC,Who do you have for your Stats class? And did you have Babic? I'm waitlisted for Green's Systems I and it doesn't look like i'll get in. I would have to take Babic otherwise.
OSU,32e29h,wch94,1 point,Mon Apr 13 02:10:09 2015 UTC,"For stats, I have O'Neil. Great guy, real nice, but not the best lecturer. Just goes through the slides and does examples. I know Ramos also teachers a lot of sections - he's really tough apparently, and his exams have really low averages. I avoided him. He does offer some extra credit and curving, though.  And I've never had Babic, no, but from what I've heard he is definitely tough and you'll have to put your work in - he makes sure you learn it and he'll test you hard, but it's fair. Green is supposed to be a great teacher if you manage to get in."
OSU,32e29h,Kayvanian,1 point,Mon Apr 13 02:52:25 2015 UTC,"I had Babic. Great professor but can be hard to understand. He does have stupid hard exams, so if youre looking to boost your Gpa this is not the route to take. However, I got an A in the class, but was one of like two or three people. Average was easily a C, and theres no curve."

The material is pretty basic.  CSE 2421 can be challenging at times, but again every professor is different. If you have Babic, i've heard many bad things.   Stat 3470 has been difficult, but I have Ramos right now who is much harder than the other professor teaching the course (O'Neill I think).   To get 2-3 semesters a 3.7-3.8 cum is going to be pretty tough. I'm not saying it's impossible, but it's going to be an uphill battle. It's just hard to believe that OSU has raised the minimum up to a 3.2, but I guess that is due to the abundance of prospective CS majors."
OSU,32e29h,Timeout19,3,Mon Apr 13 02:22:20 2015 UTC,"2421 - Somewhat difficult, but definitely not too bad. Really just need to do the assignments, go to office hours etc.  3241 - Not bad at all. I had Wiksell and loved him. Project wasn't a ton of work, content was interesting, and the work was reasonable.   ECE 2000 - Pretty easy until the last third of the class or so. If you take it online, DO NOT FALL BEHIND.  3470 - Did not like. I thought it was fairly difficult and I struggled through the last half or so of the class."
OSU,32e29h,mcrazy20,3,Mon Apr 13 02:36:35 2015 UTC,"Idk who you guys had for stats....but honestly it was pretty simple. If you can get staci white, it's great. You get a cheat sheet front and back on all 3 midterms (no cumlative final)  I ended with a B+...unfortunately. Could have easily been an A- (I was very very close), but stats has never been an easy thing for me so I struggled a bit, but you math guys would have such an easy time. I practically gave up free GPA points...but still I don't think it was anywhere near as difficult as you guys are saying it is"

In terms of GPA, the easiest way for me to sustain a steady GPA thus far was that i took mostly gen eds my first year. That's my best advice for a better GPA, take gen eds and to study study study especially with classes like the ones you and i have to take next Fall.

OSU,32e29h,thelonelyward3,1 point,Mon Apr 13 17:19:08 2015 UTC,"ECE 2000 - if it is online, stay up with it.  The homeworks are difficult and if you have trouble go to his office hours, clymer is VERY helpful.  Exams are super easy.  Labs are sometimes a pain but it's pretty easy to get good grades.  STAT 3470 - not an easy class but if you treat it as if it's another math class and do more work than the minimum, you should be fine."

Just make sure to introduce yourself to the people around you early on and be friendly, most people are friends with people from their dorm.

You just walk on the South Oval and they're there, just like the Welcome Week Concert. This one will probably be less crowded because 1) some people still have classes unlike Welcome Week (my friend had an exam during Childish Gambino last year) and 2) the response to this announcement honestly seems a lot more negative this year."
OSU,3259vh,ScootusBuckeye,4,Fri Apr 10 22:08:45 2015 UTC,"Gambino was here last year?! FUck!  Anyways, I'm interested because some friends of mine who don't go to OSU introduced me to Chromeo recently when they played at Newport and I'm sure they'd love to come see them again."

OSU,3259vh,nolanz2,1 point,Fri Apr 10 18:28:00 2015 UTC,How does this suck compared to last year? Completely different genre of music than Childish Gambino and Juicy J so not exactly comparable.
OSU,3259vh,rarecabbage,1 point,Sat Apr 11 21:27:59 2015 UTC,"Both Gambino and Juicy J had recent hits, along with albums or mixtapes.  Passion pit hasn't an an album in 3 years and their new album isn't out yet,  so no one will know any of it. They'll play new songs no one has heard or know the words to. I like artists who have songs people recognize as that makes the crowd more fun overall. Not to mention we had chainsmokers who had one of the bigger college hits of that semester.   Yeah, ok, passion pit might have good music but I won't know the songs and this defeats the whole purpose."
OSU,3259vh,nolanz2,2,Sat Apr 11 21:48:34 2015 UTC,"Different strokes for different folks! I don't need to know the music to really enjoy a concert, personally. Especially one-hit wonders that people only know their music for one song (#SELFIE and Safe and Sound...). The crowd usually sucks then anyways - every OSU concerts means 2 hours of getting shoved in the back."
OSU,3259vh,rarecabbage,1 point,Sat Apr 11 22:03:26 2015 UTC,Most concerts I go to consist of shoving. I'm usually annoyed by the people in the middle of the crowd who constantly bitch to the person behind them about shoving like it's their fault.. The only concern I've been to that didn't have shoving was OAR my freshman year.. Because no one was into it. I usually associate a calm crowd with a crappy concert experience
OSU,3259vh,nolanz2,3,Sat Apr 11 22:38:15 2015 UTC,Rowdy crowds aren't what bother me at all - it's people who constantly are trying to shove to the front like they deserve to be there more by throwing elbows. Free OSU concerts are easily the worst offender of this and I've seen a pretty good amount of live music.

OSU,326068,Frank_TheRabbit,2,Fri Apr 10 22:37:13 2015 UTC,Either the 22nd room or rooms that end in 09 and 05 since those are the rooms next to the elevator. You get an extra mini vanity counter and mirror and the closet is bigger so you can store all your junk out of site. I lived in 609 freshman year and 1005 sophomore year you can't go wrong with either and it's great extra storage space.

If you show up to class every day, do the homework, go to office hours when you need it, and study for the midterms, you'll be fine. The only things you'd really use from 1210 directly are things like unit conversions and names/structures of basic molecules, which can be picked up pretty quickly."

People fail/do poorly in the class because they don't put in the work needed to do well, and if they do it's too late. I put in slightly above average effort in the class from the start and got a B. Do well in the labs, they're like free points.   I'm just a little tired of the Chem 1210/osu chemistry is impossible circlejerk haha."

I did well in Physics 1200, 1201, and Bio 1114, but struggled a lot even though most pre-meds at OSU think these classes are jokes. One thing is for sure: office hours, practice problems, and good note-taking will get you the best grade your skills warrant."
OSU,322pu7,astronnautes,1 point,Fri Apr 10 15:59:30 2015 UTC,I had an easier time with 1220 than 1210. It's one of those classes where the practice problems will lead you to a great grade. I think you'll be fine if you keep up!

OSU,31ydqf,wafflequeene,4,Thu Apr 9 02:59:00 2015 UTC,"I have a slightly more positive view of the collegium than /u/xam2y, just because the Collegium people I know are not stuck up at all. I'm sure some of them have an ego or maybe give off an ego because they like talking about Tolstoy and other things of that nature. (Fun fact: the jumprope/skipping champion who goes here is in it.)  You can only apply your freshman year and you have to reapply every year,  although the reapplication is just to make sure you're doing well in school. It's pretty competitive. A decent amount of them have perfect/near-perfect GPAs or some outstanding personal quality/experience, so congratulations.  It's good to join if you have specific career goals, especially regarding research or professional school (med or law). All Collegium students are required to do an Honors Thesis, and they put you in touch with faculty relevant to your major and interests, so it opens a lot of doors for research and mentoring. They also provide more personalized advising and mentoring. You'll have to take a Collegium class the fall semester of your sophomore year that involves figuring out strengths, writing personal statements and essays, 1-2 oral presentations, and stuff like that. How much you get out of it depends on how much you put in. Other than your thesis, I don't think there's a lot of commitment afterwards, but I'll have to check on it.  If you want to go to grad or professional school, it's a good opportunity to get in touch with faculty (as well as being a line on your resume), but I don't know if the opportunity is significant.  Edit: You'll probably find the class annoying for a while (Tuesday nights at Kuhn's I think), but it doesn't seem like that much commitment. It's kind of like the STEP program in that sense.  Edit2: Another question is, are Collegium students successful because of Collegium, or because they already possessed qualities that set them up for success?"
OSU,31ydqf,xam2y,1 point,Thu Apr 9 03:51:06 2015 UTC,"I was under the impression that if you are not accepted freshman year, you can't reapply. That is what I was told during my interview. I understand your view of it is totally different than mine, but I don't think I am missing out on anything terribly important. Like you said in your second edit, some people already have those qualities."
OSU,31ydqf,wafflequeene,1 point,Thu Apr 9 04:09:00 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I meant that existing collegium students have to reapply every year (much less rigorous, more of a check-up so I've heard). You can even choose not to do it at some point. And like /u/xam2y, I don't think it's a huge missed opportunity, but since you've been accepted, might as well."
OSU,31ydqf,bsilvereagle,3,Thu Apr 9 04:22:51 2015 UTC,"If you plan on going to grad school, you're on OSU's fast track right now. If you have no intentions of pursuing a PhD/Law Degree/MD, the Collegium probably isn't for you.   As a Collegium member, you've got access to advisers who can get you into labs other people can't get into, you've got people to read scholarship essays, you've got people finding scholarships/fellowships for you, finding job opportunities for you. It's quite the luxury to have.   In terms of personalities you'll find in the Collegium, all of my friends in it are very bright & successful people and they know it. So when they see people being complete morons, yeah they look down on that. But I wouldn't say they have inflated egos as a general rule.   The Collegium also has some extracurriculars you'll be expected to go to (lab tours, socials, etc) but those aren't really time consuming, just something to be aware of."
OSU,31ydqf,xam2y,4,Thu Apr 9 17:20:38 2015 UTC,"I applied and got denied. I has excellent GOALS and was invited for an interview. Dring the interview, I learned that it is a group of stuck-up individuals whose expectations cannot be met and who think they are better than everyone else. I asked about the benefits of being in the Collegium. Obviously, the implied benefit is it just being another line on your resume. They told me that it's a group where you basically help yourself to do stuff. They asked me a bunch of political questions, and I was probably denied because my answers did not agree with the opinions of three extremely biased individuals. I could just tell from the interview they did not like me for my opinions, even though they promote and value ""diversity"" in beliefs. Trust me, get out while you still can.

OSU,31x5u3,gnps_q,5,Wed Apr 8 21:15:20 2015 UTC,"A quick Google brought up this page:   Students who have been academically dismissed from the university can petition for reinstatement. Reinstatement is not guaranteed, and simple desire to return is not sufficient support for a petition. Petitioning students need to prove (not merely assert) they are now ready to succeed if they are allowed to return to the university and resume course work. It is advisable to take academic course work at another institution during your time away from Ohio State, to demonstrate that you are capable of succeeding in high-quality college-level work. Students who have been dismissed from the university and have been away from the university for at least five years may want to petition to use Fresh Start."
OSU,31x5u3,Kayvanian,5,Thu Apr 9 01:28:28 2015 UTC,I transferred to OSU back when we were still on quarters. Had a shit GPA because I wasn't use to not living at home and got overwhelmed with work and school. Got dismissed after 1 academic year in exploratory. I talked to an advisor in the school that I wanted to get my degree in and they told me I had to wait at least 1 year to apply to them. I ended up taking 2 full years off without taking classes at another school and they accepted me after I filled out some paperwork and wrote an essay about why I didn't succeed the first time around.  Be careful coming back and make sure you are ready to put some work in right away. If your GPA was shit beforehand they wont put you on probation coming back but if you don't get your GPA above a 2.0(or whatever your school has it set at) first semester back they will and you'll be in the same boat again.  Best of luck to you! Getting dismissed was probably the best thing to happen to me academically. I was a middle of the road student who was just getting by before. After having to tell my parents about what happened it was really eye opening as to how much I had fucked up. Don't waste the 2nd chance you'll get.

Next Monday is a due date of a verification form for some students so Financial Aid is by no means complete. Things like that are reassessed frequently and we're still 4 months out from when fees are actually due.   I would say wait until your statement of account comes out and tell you what your actual owe. That is an estimated cost and a lot of things are factored in that eventually factor out. As an off campus student I didn't pay anywhere near to what my estimated cost was last year or this year.  If it makes you feel better, mine estimated cost says 37k as well and I'm off-campus."

For each lecture we had to read anywhere from 25-40 pages of dense material and most of it was all ancient texts that are translated to English, making it hard to understand. However I am not a liberal arts major so that kinda work isn't my cup of tea. The only reason I got a B- was because my TA said fuck it and gave us all good grades on our final paper because he didn't feel like reading them.

I lived on south campus and literally never met the majority of my floor because they all liked to study and keep to themselves.  My freshman year I lived in Drackett on North and it was a social hub....people were always out in the hallways, going out all the time, always stopping by and always having the doors open.  The most important thing to focus on is what you can control....so that would be the building and room type preferences.  From there it's luck of the draw with who is on your floor, but honestly whenever you put 1000 college students in the same building, the chances are pretty high that you'll be able to have a good social life just based on the circumstances that you're living so close to so many people."

Being a smaller dorm, it has a lot of opportunities that the big, neighboring dorms like Smith-Steeb or Park-Stradley don't have. At least once a week there are like dorm-wide game nights, meetings, social events, and all that.

OSU,31y2pb,thatguyfromchicago,0,Thu Apr 9 05:01:46 2015 UTC,"It's changes year to year.  You can have fun anywhere, but the towers are far away from nightlife. Still a sociable atmosphere, if not more so. I lived in Mack and liked it. South has the more party, active reputation and North the more quiet studious but I feel that doesn't really hold true any more. New north campus dorm looks cool."
OSU,31v7jc,clusterbn,20,Wed Apr 8 12:35:50 2015 UTC,"Basically get a nice coat and suck it up. I recommend the Eddie Bauer salvage store. Don't confuse it with the warehouse store at the same spot.  I wouldn't bike in bad weather snow and ice are just as bad for bikes.  As long as you respect the cold you won't freeze to death. Keep that in mind when you are hammered. Its also not as bad as you think, subzero is rare."
OSU,31v7jc,thegreedyturtle,2,Wed Apr 8 13:12:48 2015 UTC,Eddie Bauer warehouse is one of my favorites. You can definitely find good cheap winter clothes there.
OSU,31v7jc,wch94,10,Wed Apr 8 13:22:34 2015 UTC,"Welcome to OSU!  There's the CABS (Campus Area Bus Services) that goes on a loop throughout campus that you can take to get class and wherever. Besides that you'll be walking and also i'd say pack a good amount of warm clothes because once the cold hits by about two months into Autumn it's here to stay until whenever Mother Nature decides Ohio is fortunate enough to get nice weather again. Oh and riding a bike to class can be helpful, though you might receive criticism for doing so."
OSU,31v7jc,wch94,3,Wed Apr 8 12:51:59 2015 UTC,"Also, if you're far off-campus/not on the CABS route the local city buses can be used with your student ID."
OSU,31v7jc,Faigon,6,Wed Apr 8 16:56:45 2015 UTC,"Get a nice coat, dress in layers, get a nice pair of boots (I recommend lugged Chippewas over Bean Boots). The busses are usually packed but they do a good job plowing the sidewalks on-campus for walking to class.   They usually cancel only if we get near -30 with windchill."
OSU,31v7jc,mtjess60,5,Wed Apr 8 13:25:43 2015 UTC,How do you deal with the heat?
OSU,31v7jc,RiotNrrrd_,4,Wed Apr 8 16:44:49 2015 UTC,"I have a cousin from Texas who attended college in Ohio.  Her complaint the first winter was, ""Y'all told me it would be cold, but no one told me it would be icy!""  So, be careful with ice.    Aside from that, dress in layers, and have a nice pair of boots.  It really doesn't get exceedingly snowy in Columbus."
OSU,31v7jc,Paxtian,3,Wed Apr 8 13:38:01 2015 UTC,Fellow Buckeye from Texas here! What area are you from?
OSU,31v7jc,gingabreadm4n,2,Wed Apr 8 16:16:41 2015 UTC,Because when you're from here you just get used to it. It's been in the 50's lately and people have shorts on.
OSU,31v7jc,RKilbane20,2,Wed Apr 8 17:22:57 2015 UTC,"Also from Texas. Just get a warm enough coat, boots, and something to cover your ears and you'll be good."
OSU,31v7jc,fboy12321,2,Wed Apr 8 17:51:29 2015 UTC,I'm amazed I haven't seen a comment advising you to get a hat and gloves.  Wearing two pairs of socks is a good strategy too
OSU,31v7jc,wheres_walto,2,Wed Apr 8 18:59:19 2015 UTC,"If you've never driven in the snow, don't. I don't want to seem mean or like I'm discouraging you, but lots of people who live their whole lives in the snow are bad at driving in it. You won't fare much better.  Columbus has the COTA bus system that can help you get around the city (and to the airport) and CABS is the campus bus service that will help you get around campus. Both of these services are free for students as long as you have your BuckID. Uber and taxi cabs are always an option as well.  I recommend getting a good pair of boots that are either waterproof or have steel toes because it will help keep your feet dry when the sidewalks are covered in snow. When all that snow melts, we have a lot of sitting water. Good boots will help keep your feet from getting soaked by puddles as well.  Gloves and a scarf are great for days when the wind chill is below zero.   Make sure you have sweatshirts, a light jacket, and a heavy jacket. Layer according to the temperature and the wind. When the wind chill is -30, you will not stay warm without layers."

OSU,31v7jc,nosebleedexpress,1 point,Wed Apr 8 18:23:06 2015 UTC,"School never gets cancelled honestly, this year it was like -20, and snowing and no cancellation. We were the only school in ohio to not be cancelled."
OSU,31v7jc,thelonelyward3,1 point,Wed Apr 8 16:16:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but truth be told that cancellation was a really bad play on OSU's part. I know a girl in my class who got frostbite and was sent to the wexner medical center."
OSU,31v7jc,thelonelyward3,1 point,Wed Apr 8 17:31:19 2015 UTC,"Or she was waiting for the bus. University village bus's aren't as common as you think. Also the body can catch frostbite at temperatures warmer than -20, and the fact she was petite leads me to think it would be easier for her to come in contact with it, I'm not to sure about her size being a factor, but it's likely."
OSU,31v7jc,thelonelyward3,1 point,Wed Apr 8 17:50:12 2015 UTC,Just follow the rule that you can always take off a layer if you need too and you'll be fine. It really doesn't take long to get used to it an before you know it 30 degree days will feel like spring.
OSU,31v7jc,IamWoldo,1 point,Wed Apr 8 17:57:17 2015 UTC,"Three things: Boots, bus and layers."
OSU,31v7jc,4arc,1 point,Wed Apr 8 18:05:14 2015 UTC,"Very carefully.  Heavy coat, gloves, boots, etc. The sidewalks on campus are salted but the sidewalks in the neighborhoods can get super sketchy as heavy foot traffic packs the snow down into solid ice. Walking to class became a treacherous pain in the ass for everyone.  But yeah, you just gotta suck it up. It gets cold and it snows but it could be worse - a buddy from New Hampshire went home to 3 feet of snow during spring break. Ohio winters suck but they're not that bad in the scheme of things."
OSU,31v7jc,BrosenkranzKeef,1 point,Wed Apr 8 17:48:50 2015 UTC,"this winter I wore shirt, sweatshirt, jacket, beanie, shorts, and then sweatpants, with a pair of socks and boots with wool lined, never really got cold, even those ""bad"" days weren't too bad if you dress warm, and in jan,feb, march you get used to it and 30 degress becomes warm"
OSU,31woln,avilarosee,6,Wed Apr 8 19:14:21 2015 UTC,I'd agree about finding an end table to put it on rather than your desk.  Some additional advice: I'd make sure to talk to your roommates about bringing the tank before you just show up with it. Whether you're in a quad or something with a bit more space in my experience it's better to have as much open space as possible. Feeling cramped in your room is one of the biggest reasons roommates get annoyed with one another.  Congrats on getting in!
OSU,31woln,Schobee3,3,Wed Apr 8 21:59:37 2015 UTC,"This is 100% completely dependent on your dorm. What dorm are you going to be in?  On North Campus, if you're in a quad, two people get independent desks and two people get a 'bar' desk aka a shelf that runs maybe 10' and you each get 5'. The bars are maybe 22"" deep.   You'll be better off finding an end table to put your tank on I think, rather than using your desk."
OSU,31woln,bsilvereagle,2,Wed Apr 8 19:38:12 2015 UTC,There'd be plenty of room for it if you're in the towers
OSU,31woln,TrueBlonde,1 point,Thu Apr 9 13:16:10 2015 UTC,"As someone else has said, Morrill or Lincoln Tower probably have the biggest desks - in my experience, they're twice as big as most others. However, I'm making that comparison with both South and North dorms pre-renovation, so things may have changed since then."

It might take around 45 minutes for PhD students to be called, depending how many are graduating that year (masters students will not have their names called). During this time, students got up to use the restroom, grab a snack, etc. I just played on my phone. You will be free to go once you walk across the field and get your diploma."
OSU,31vu8w,mlenoelle,1 point,Wed Apr 8 16:22:01 2015 UTC,I'm PhD and I don't plan to stay for all the undergrad names to be read off. You think I could plan on leaving about 90 minutes after it starts to allow time for the speaker and PhD names?
OSU,31vu8w,mlenoelle,1 point,Wed Apr 8 16:29:29 2015 UTC,If you're a PhD student then I'm guessing you could leave after you get your diploma. 90 minutes is probably a safe bet but maybe give yourself an extra 15 minutes in case your position in line to be called is toward the end. I believe they order it alphabetically.

I'm on my phone occasionally but he's never called me out on it... And the one time I came in late, he actually came up to me after class and told me I could turn in a homework late. Unfortunately his office hours are during other classes but I might email him."
OSU,31vf5u,bsilvereagle,3,Wed Apr 8 16:12:51 2015 UTC,"You got off easy.   Once a guy walked in 10 minutes late. Satya stopped lecture, told us a story about a professor at Cornell who made late students teach the rest of the class. Then he walked over to the guy, looked him square in the eyes, and told him not to be late again.   Then a guy walked in 30 minutes late or so. Once again, Satya stopped lecture, erased the board, walked over to where the guy was sitting, and announced a quiz. The quiz was over what he had just taught in the past 30 minutes. He was staring the guy down the whole time.   But other than that, fantastic guy."

OSU,31tnol,ImDirrtyDan,17,Wed Apr 8 01:50:59 2015 UTC,"Honestly, eating healthy is up to you. There's healthy food available, and there is non-healthy food. You can make a conscious effort to choose healthy things and live a healthy lifestyle, or you can eat whatever you want, without regard to your health. For me, I use the nutrition facts that OSU provides to plan out my meals, and I set times every week to workout. You're not doomed to having a Freshman 15. It's really up to you"
OSU,31tnol,WolfBad,8,Wed Apr 8 02:03:23 2015 UTC,"The best way to eat healthy is to make your own food, but as a freshman, that isn't really an option. You'll just have to make a concerted effort to find the healthier options. My roommate and I both lost ~10 pounds freshman year, so it isn't impossible."
OSU,31tnol,mtjess60,1 point,Wed Apr 8 02:04:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the food might not always be as healthy, but when you're walking miles a day to class you're burning a lot of it off. I gained weight AFTER college simply because I wasn't walking everywhere anymore."
OSU,31tnol,TrueBlonde,5,Wed Apr 8 13:30:52 2015 UTC,"I'm just finishing up my freshman year and I've lost ten or so pounds without really watching what I eat. However, I do pay attention and make sure not to eat too many outrageously unhealthy things in one day, which is entirely possible but you'd be surprised how much walking to class helps especially considering I didn't really do anything before I came here to stay skinny other than rely on my high metabolism. That being said, I don't know how active you are, so you may need to pay more attention but there are healthy options at almost every single on campus location along with at least a decent amount of variety. Frankly, it's a learning experience. Try the food everywhere or at least look at what the different locations have to offer. As for meal plans, I would advise you to get the one with the least amount of traditions visits. The traditions places are buffet style ""food"" and all you can eat can be dangerous, particularly when your stressed. I'm living on campus again next year and I got the Access 7 which I believe is not available to incoming freshmen, but it was the lowest amount of traditions visits, plus I can still trade them for blocks. Economically I believe it was also the best choice. And don't forget you can change your meal plan within the first few weeks if you decide you don't like it or even between semesters and you can always add more dining dollars or buckID cash as you need it. Sorry for the book, hope it helps!"
OSU,31tnol,CaptainWhiteBread,3,Wed Apr 8 05:11:26 2015 UTC,"Truthfully from my opinion the healthy food is very very limited. You can get salads fruits etc, but unless you want to eat lean meat and veggies everyday it's going to be hard."
OSU,31tnol,thelonelyward3,2,Wed Apr 8 06:23:38 2015 UTC,"Healthy options are available, but get into the habit of tracking what you're eating.  As /u/fyirb says, Myfitnesspal is great for this.  I truly wish I'd gotten into that habit back then.  Plan out your meals in advance to the extent you can."
OSU,31tnol,Paxtian,1 point,Wed Apr 8 13:40:10 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the responses guys.   There are no blocks next year; instead we get visits, $5 exchages, buckid cash, and dining dollars. I'll heed the advice of limited Traditions visits and probably go with the Buckeye 5 (only 5 visits to Traditions/wk with a large amount of dining dollars).   What are the healthiest on-campus eateries? Worst? Again, thanks for helping."
OSU,31tnol,Bitani,4,Wed Apr 8 11:30:48 2015 UTC,"Courtside Cafe is arguably the best healthy-eating place. It is inside the RPAC.   Traditions are alright, but I personally disliked the difficulty of calculating macros.   Union Market is also alright. Sushi, sammiches, chicken sammiches at the burger place.   Most places have a few healthier options, but those were the three I most often found myself at."
OSU,31tnol,fyirb,1 point,Wed Apr 8 12:18:19 2015 UTC,"If you run for like 20 minutes 5 days a week it'll probably even out any weight gain you might've had. Or you could use MyFitnessPal to make sure you maintain and don't go over your TDEE. Otherwise, in general, campus dining is pretty shitty."
OSU,31tnol,webbed_feets,1 point,Wed Apr 8 12:40:26 2015 UTC,"I got so sick of campus food that I started only eating salad. I lost a lot of weight. You can definitely find healthy options,"

OSU,31osnb,gobucksthrowaway,5,Mon Apr 6 23:48:18 2015 UTC,"Obligatory not a TA but... I do know lots of people who are currently one. What it sounds like you want to do is become a TA during your time as a master's program. Depending on the program, some positions do help cover your eduction. I know that the graduate teaching assistants in the fundamentals of engineering courses get their tuition covered by becoming a GTA.  The thing is, in the Psych Department, I believe graduate students are expected to teach at least 3 classes as a part of their doctoral program. So it definitely varies from department to department.  On anther note, TA's are usually hired in a class that they can relate to, or have some sort of experience in. Depending on what degree you are working toward you might find it hard to land a TA position. Say you major in English or education, well, TAing for courses like Chemistry and Calc are out of the question when their are other graduate students in those fields to to pick from (not saying you want to TA those kinds of courses, merely using it as an example to state an observation).   My best advice would be to start thinking about your major, and what classes relate to it that you could possibly TA. Then, while you are an undergraduate really try to get to know the professors that teach that course. That would be an informal way. Also, as in engineering, many simply apply through the department.  Best of luck!"

I would check the OSU satellites like Lima and Newark. They might have those positions available. Just know this: enrollment is down and less money is coming into department coffers.

My grandma died a few months after I finished this class and I was so happy I'd taken it because it gave me the skills and information to cope with my grief.

OSU,31kw3g,osu_cse,7,Mon Apr 6 01:29:18 2015 UTC,https://cse.osu.edu/sites/cse.osu.edu/files/uploads/ugrad/semFocusAreasSummary.pdf Not sure if this helps or if you have seen this before but based on your interests of classes in CSE you could use this pdf to help determine some classes that would suit you. I plan on taking Web Apps because it would be highly beneficial with the internship i'm likely to get.

OSU,31kw3g,TatMan15,1 point,Mon Apr 6 03:55:55 2015 UTC,"I did 3902 and it was a good amount of fun. You do one project for the whole semester, so it's about as close to a Capstone project as you can get. Not terribly difficult and the grading was really lenient. It provided a good foundation to get into some of the other computer graphics classes.  If you are looking into more web development or other software development, 3901 may be better for you. I've heard it's a few smaller projects throughout the semester and you go through a few different programming languages. Can't say much else other than that."
OSU,31l2wv,sxeQ,9,Mon Apr 6 02:27:11 2015 UTC,"They'll get updated eventually, but there isn't a specific date when that will happen. It's usually on a departmental basis. Professors don't really pick what sections of a class they want to teach, usually they preference courses they want to teach and someone in the department schedules them to classes based on the preferences. For example, most CSE classes currently say ""Staff,"" but I've heard that the department could finally have professors posted as early as this week"
OSU,31l2wv,WolfBad,6,Mon Apr 6 02:40:08 2015 UTC,When its too late to switch because its the same professor who failed you last semester

OSU,31l2wv,wch94,1 point,Mon Apr 6 02:33:01 2015 UTC,One semester profs were announced as late as a week or two before classes start for me. It could have been a fluke though since that was during the transition to semesters. Good luck.

OSU,31mbbs,Badgerboy117,2,Mon Apr 6 13:22:13 2015 UTC,"It depends! More social or more academic? South campus is known for a good social scene.   North Campus (currently under TONS of construction) is more academically focused. That doesn't mean north campus isn't social, just less than South in my experience.   A little bit more about North Campus.... There is a TON of construction right now. All day and sometimes during the night and it finishes summer 2016...but most of the dorms are brand-spanking-new. Plus a few new dining courts and a rec center are being built right into North Campus. So it's definitely a trade off."

There should be floor plans online that can give you a feel for how many roommates you might have or the kind of overall room set up. I can't speak for any of the new dorms though, but rumor has it they should be pretty nice.   I personally loved living on south campus freshman year, minus the construction.

If you're already good at Calculus, then it's an easy A on your transcript for a 5 credit class.  It's also a class that many people won't get an A in.

One thing you might want to factor in though is the fact that you will get to live with other honors students in Bradely if you choose that residents hall. Personally, I am a part of a scholars program and our floor has really bonded over the course of the year. It's where I've met most of my friends. If you choose SS or PS you might miss out on that experience, but the dorms are definitely nicer.  I'm not really sure how close the honors students get though through living together, it might be a different experience entirely. At least the boarding cost would be slightly lower :P"

If you come to class every day and put in a bit of sincere effort in homework, you'll get an A.

It was more laid back being summer though. Micro I had was probably equivalent to 4100 today so I don't think I can help much with that molecularmicro  choice. The only other class I had that comes close to what you are considering was a biochem/molecular lab 5621. That was the most demanding of the 3 and covered a lot of important topics. Very time consuming but learned the most and was the most in depth of important common techniques/experiments.

Besides, I like the sound ""buku"" makes of ""bookoo"" rather than ""beaucoup""  Edit: A lot of personal sites are claiming this fact, but I can't find a primary source. Considering most of the sources spelling the word bookoo are related to Vietnam, it seems it may have been pronounced that way in Vietnam and then brought over here with that spelling (and a phonetic pronunciation). I can't support a spelling of buku so I took that out of the above comment."

He doesn't have a second major as far as I can tell, but has completed all the pre-med requirements and is entering medical school this fall.  So it's definitely doable; just remember that music majors tend to be very busy (a lot more time spent in class) and majoring in something that you don't plan to spend your career doing may not be the best use of your undergraduate years (then again, I'm not too knowledgable about how medical school works, and you'll likely be spending a lot of time there). So definitely make sure you have a real passion for jazz before going into that major; I personally found that I liked the experience of being in a jazz ensemble but didn't want to commit to hours spent practicing and studying the theory.  Edit: I should also add that you don't need to be a jazz major to be involved with jazz here: as an engineering major I've been involved with an ensemble and combo every semester, and as far as I know private lessons and many jazz courses are available to non majors."

Anyway the majors don't overlap at all except for some general education courses, also you do realize you can still major in Jazz and still got to med school right? you just have to finish all the requirements. e.g. chem, bio, biochem etc. You don't necessarily have to major in a bio-science, but thats up to you. I don't think anyone has experience majoring in these things, and I don't really know why you would even want to, typically what you major in is something you're very interested in doing, and need the degree to pursue that career, you really shouldn't major in a ""hobby"" because the whole point of a degree is to show the employer that you're qualified. I would just stick to playing it as a hobby, and focus on one major truth be told pre-med is extremely difficult, and long road, don't make it longer to study Jazz."

I think it is the ""tradition classroom"" setup, but I'm not sure.

In my opinion you schedule a class to get lectured during that allotted time instead of doing practice problems. If you understand the material and don't need to do practice problems, then that's up to you. I shouldn't have to sit through unnecessary practice problems during class and then listen to lectures during my free time outside of class when I need to worry about my other classes as well."

I actually didn't know that Lincoln had doubles - all else equal, I think I'd prefer Taylor over Lincoln just because it's closer to things.

Definitely closest to the best food places (Union, Marketplace, Mirror Lakes Creamery, 12 Ave Bread Co).   The people here (in general) are probably a little more willing to go out on weekends and Thursdays. From what I heard north campus dorms are less outgoing.  Most of my floor was very kind and happy to meet new people.   My floor mates in Morrison were also engineering students like me. I think OSU groups it that way as best as they can. I was about a 10-12 minute walk from my furthest class. Also I was a 2 minute walk from JO south, the closest gym.   I also strongly urge you NOT to go for a single. Its way more likely you will have a great roommate who you will become friends with than a shitty one.

OSU,311grz,JayGii,17,Wed Apr 1 10:27:02 2015 UTC,"I'm guess I'm the odd man out here. I loved my Quad. Is the quad especially roomy for 4 guys? No its not, but the room setup makes it worth it. There are 2 rooms. 1 bedroom and 1 for studying/chilling. In a double, there's only one room. Want to watch TV but your roommate has a different sleep schedule or has a girl over or whatever? Too bad.   Quads also have their own bathrooms. If you're going to be in a double, you're going to have a community bathroom.   EDIT: I'm speaking about Quads on North Campus. I personally disagree with some of the other commenters about West Campus. I would not want to live in the towers, which is all that West Campus has. Almost all North Campus dorms have the exact same room setup."
OSU,311grz,krs00pxy,6,Wed Apr 1 11:57:55 2015 UTC,"Yup. I lived in a quad freshman year and a double sophomore year. I HATED the double. It was such a pain in the butt if I wanted to stay up late or had a girl come over or anything. Having 2 rooms was just so much nicer, even if it was a little crowded"
OSU,311grz,mcrazy20,6,Wed Apr 1 13:03:20 2015 UTC,"I really enjoyed my quad as well (I lived in Taylor Tower), the extra room + bathroom were great to have. I only lived in the dorms my freshman year, but it was a good time. The only issue with a quad is that generally someone is almost always there and you have to schedule bathroom time, but not needing to step in puke in public bathrooms and wear shower shoes made it worth it to me."
OSU,311grz,Janus67,2,Wed Apr 1 14:13:39 2015 UTC,"Quads have two rooms in SOME buildings. And they definitely only have their own bathroom in SOME buildings.  Source: Lived in quad of Mack Hall. No A/C, but big room. Great community. Still would not recommend."

OSU,311grz,OrganizedSprinkles,6,Wed Apr 1 11:57:23 2015 UTC,Quad! For the only reason of private bathroom. Also is separated into living room and bedroom so it helps keep the activities sperate.
OSU,311grz,AlwaysHalfAsleep,6,Wed Apr 1 12:49:16 2015 UTC,"I had a quad freshman year. It was a little crowded sometimes, but having 2 rooms made it worth it for me. It's not as common for freshman to get, but the ideal would be a with 2+ rooms (ie north campus or west campus towers)."
OSU,311grz,GoBucks13,3,Wed Apr 1 13:22:23 2015 UTC,"If you get a double, just don't stay isolated with each other.  I knew some people who didn't make many friends their first year because they decided to live with friends they already knew.  As for optimum size, it definitely seemed like 3 person rooms were the most social because there were more people in it than a double (and therefore more people with friends to hang out with) and it actually had room for socializing unlike a 4 person room.  Although, it might be awkward for the third roommate since you two already know each other."
OSU,311grz,bsilvereagle,3,Wed Apr 1 12:51:21 2015 UTC,"I thought the triple was the sweet spot. You get a quad, but you're short a man so everyone has a little more space, the bathroom schedule wasn't as tight, etc. But there are three people so if you don't hit it off with one roommate, that's okay, you've got a second chance."
OSU,311grz,thelonelyward3,2,Wed Apr 1 13:29:12 2015 UTC,"four person is more fun, if you want space avoid every north-campus dorm, especially norton unless you feel like living in a closet."
OSU,311grz,alee3001,2,Wed Apr 1 13:23:35 2015 UTC,"I lived in a quad on west. Enjoyed it. If I were going to live on south id go for a double. I'd  avoid north campus like the plague. Also I'd highly advise not living with a friend, a good friend does not usually make a good roommate. Just my two cents"
OSU,311grz,thatwaswicked,2,Wed Apr 1 13:30:12 2015 UTC,I'm in a double in Lincoln and it is perfect. I can socialize with large amounts of people but I still get my own personal space. I have ag campus classes though so it is highly convenient for me.
OSU,311grz,nbrazz,2,Wed Apr 1 14:41:27 2015 UTC,"All of these replies are going to be anecdotal in nature. That said, I think the biggest predictor of if you are going to have a good time is your own attitude and outlook towards wherever you end up living.   I lived in Lincoln my freshman year and was in the quad. It was a great experience as my direct roommates and suite as a whole got along very well. The space is cramped, but it is definitely livable. I was fortunate to room with great roommates but this may not be the case for you.  If you want to remove any risk of having a bad unknown roommate than go for a double with your buddy. If you want to experience living with 3 other people and potentially making two new very good friends go for the quad.  If you end up on North, South or West you can have a good social experience in any dorm. It's popular for people to say that North is quiet, South is a party and West is a ghost town but that really isn't the case. It's the people that make the community and if you are a leader and actively try to make your community strong then it will most likely be a strong community.  As an RA I have seen many rooms of people who knew each other before coming to school. My biggest piece of advice is to make sure to keep your door open seek out people in your building. It's very easy to hangout with your roommate having already known each other and miss out on getting to know your floor."

Well we sorta lucked out and got paired together in a quad in Taylor except with no other roommates. So while we didn't live with new people like we wanted, we had AC, our own bathroom, two other rooms and since it was just us it was so much space. So hey maybe you guys will get the same deal we did, or if not you'll get to broaden your horizons and live with two strangers. Go for the quad"
OSU,311grz,LaPizzeria,1 point,Wed Apr 1 13:28:24 2015 UTC,I lived in a quad in Patterson freshmen year.  The quads were bigger per capita than the doubles.  No AC though...but they have done some upgrades since I was there.

OSU,30yt9p,LibreWulf,19,Tue Mar 31 21:48:25 2015 UTC,"You've been hearing the wrong things about Bucci, the guy is an awesome professor. He obviously cares a bunch about the material and is pretty helpful if you get to know him  He comes off harsh, he really expects you to put in the effort to learn. I still refer to some of my notes I took in one of my java classes with him"
OSU,30yt9p,optiplex9000,12,Tue Mar 31 20:32:50 2015 UTC,"I second this. The reasons he's so hard on people is because he genuinely cares about people LEARNING the material, not just passing a test or something. A lot of the concepts in these classes can come back to bite you if you don't learn them well now. I had him twice and always did okay in the class and I really feel like I learned a lot."
OSU,30yt9p,mcrazy20,6,Tue Mar 31 20:40:16 2015 UTC,This!  Paolo is one of they best CSE professors.  He will challenge you and make sure you learn your stuff.
OSU,30yt9p,BuckeyeDan,5,Tue Mar 31 23:42:37 2015 UTC,"I believe Paolo Bucci is the course coordinator for Software I & II.  There should be many lecturers/lab professors in those classes. Keep in mind that the material is the same through every section though. Midterms, labs, homeworks, slides, etc. are all the same."
OSU,30yt9p,Timeout19,2,Tue Mar 31 22:05:29 2015 UTC,"I had Bucci for Software II. One thing I can say is that he was very intimidating and would chew people out for asking simple questions. He was also baffled when his midterms were averaging much lower than other classes and he blamed it on our lack of effort. However, when going over exams he would frequently say ""I should have thrown this question out"" - yikes.  I didn't think he was that bad as a professor, though. It was just the shear amount of material we were expected to learn in a short amount of time.   I'm sure if you're a student who's used to getting As in CSE classes, you'll have no problem. But as an average student who came into OSU with no prior CSE knowledge, I struggled in his class."

OSU,310hmh,astronnautes,3,Wed Apr 1 12:04:16 2015 UTC,"Callam is  highest in difficulty mostly because his exam questions are not clear cut regurgitation. You really have to know what you are doing to do well.   Whatever you are doing in general chemistry is working. However, organic chemistry will probably take more time because you don't want to gloss over a mechanism or a few reactions and expect to understand them. It is important to understand all of the steps of a mechanism, the kinds of reactions, reagents, and going from A to B (synthesis).

I liked having more exams (I think we had 5 and a final?) because it would have been WAY too much material for me to process for 3 total exams .  Plus I thought he was very clear and helpful.  In the end I ended up with a B in both classes though.  I just had a better experience in one class over another.  I actually thought 2520 was easier in terms of topic difficulty.  I don't know HOW I got as high as a B in Chang's class.  After the first exam which was mostly structures and chirality I got totally lost, I could never follow Chang's notes in class.

OSU,30xgpl,nbrazz,1 point,Tue Mar 31 16:00:14 2015 UTC,CBE.osu.edu  If you are applying at the end of the year (during spring semester) it is competitive and capped. If you are applying during fall semester to start in the spring it is not capped and you only need to make the grade requirements.
OSU,30xgpl,penguinhugs,1 point,Tue Mar 31 16:08:59 2015 UTC,"As high as you can get it.

I had a prereq override to get in and took it there so this could possibly work for you. It would also be easier there as well. One other thing, there is no rush to get into the College. The best benefit of getting in it early is the priority scheduling. If you don't have priority scheduling you can just waitlist. I had to do this."

The Electronics Club is the club actually planning and hosting this Makeathon, with the financial support being primarily from OHI/O.

Each are making >90k/yr, had cushy internships, and seem happy. I have never heard it described as a new field. It might be a slightly newer degree to the university, but the principles and applications to industry are pretty much assumed foundational.  Keep reading about it. It's a surprisingly versatile field."
OSU,30vsah,mathafrica,3,Tue Mar 31 03:24:36 2015 UTC,"I'm currently a fourth year in CBE. I'd say a good way to describe MSE is that it focuses on the material going through the process (whatever that may be), while CBE focuses on the process as a whole. They are closely related and I think you would be well off in either field."
OSU,30vsah,MIBrew,2,Tue Mar 31 03:55:38 2015 UTC,"Have you ever heard of a Professional Engineer license? If you get a PE, with an MSE degree, you can go into consulting jobs which pay pretty well. Stuff like failure analysis for the oil industry pays very well."

OSU,30vsah,Diabolical_Engineer,1 point,Tue Mar 31 16:01:14 2015 UTC,"As a materials science student, I take exception to the idea that we're a new field. Yes, materials science as an integrated field of metallurgy, ceramics, and polymers is a relatively new (30-40 yrs) idea, but most of the components of MSE have been around for quite a while, i.e. the old metallurgical engineering and ceramic engineering departments which were combined into the MSE department were some of the oldest engineering departments at OSU.  The biggest issue you might have with MSE at OSU is that we are heavily focused on metallurgy and corrosion science due to the history of the program. Most of your undergraduate MSE courses will be heavily focused on metals, with smaller amounts of polymers and ceramics. You can do a polymer, ceramic, or biomaterials focus your senior year with the requisite MSE electives, but most of the courses prior to that are heavily focused on metals.  Those are the issues that a couple of my friends who don't want to focus in metals have with our program. That being said, I love our department. It's really quite small and close-knit and the faculty are very willing to help students with research. If you have major questions about MSE at OSU, you need to talk to our advisor, Megan Daniels, who is excellent and can probably answer a lot of your questions about coursework.  TL:DR Lots of opportunities in MSE at OSU, heavily metals focused, talk to Megan Daniels. If you have any specific questions about the major, shoot me a PM and I'll try and get back to you."
OSU,30vsah,Diabolical_Engineer,2,Tue Mar 31 16:08:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I emailed her and she got back to me in like an hour, which was cool. Have you researched job ops and internships and the like yet? Do you know if they are as plentiful as in the other engineering programs? I've done some Googling and it sounds like it's a field that pays very well and has plenty of jobs, like seemingly all the engineering disciplines, but hearing it from someone who is already doing the leg work would be nice."

We should be asking why Gee didn't do more to fix swipes and blocks. Maybe if he had skipped a few frat parties we could be eating at Giant Eagle's Traditions Dining sponsored by Coke Zero.    On the other hand, Drake could use his new administration as an excuse to completely toss the current meal plans and hire in someone who has been successful at another university. Subsidizing dining with a little of that CampusParc money would probably be worth the positive reaction from students."

OSU,30ssk3,tbsports,-2,Mon Mar 30 19:12:36 2015 UTC,"I'd rather NOT see him around campus. It means he's in his office doing his job.

OSU,30ssk3,buddhasuncle,10,Mon Mar 30 20:35:13 2015 UTC,The president should be both visible and effective in the backroom.   President Gee was an incredible fundraiser because of his visibility.

OSU,30ssk3,mtjess60,1 point,Mon Mar 30 21:06:02 2015 UTC,"Apparently there is something I don't understand, how visibility with students makes a single difference in fundraising.

OSU,30ssk3,buddhasuncle,2,Mon Mar 30 21:42:18 2015 UTC,"Because a big chunk of fundraising comes from alumni. Who do you think a graduating senior would donate to in a few years? Someone who came to his house party and was well liked, or someone he literally has seen once."
OSU,30ssk3,misteryub,2,Tue Mar 31 03:53:01 2015 UTC,"It's all about how you look to the public that leads to donations. Successful presidents are popular with their students.

How are you ever going to figure out if you can do it if you don't try? There are plenty of people who major in and graduate in chemistry, but it's the people who legitimately want it that do.  Chemistry is not easy, much less as a major but you can be damn sure that you won't make it if you only doubt yourself the whole time. If you are looking into doing polymers, I would suggest doing chemistry but there are very few groups who actually do research on polymers at osu. I don't know about the material science groups. However, polymer science is a lot more organic than materials science so if that's something that you genuinely want to do then go for it but you may not get to do research on it before you graduate unless the focus professors have changes in the next 3-4 years."

It's also a lot of work, a Solid chem class is 5 hours, but theres  8 hours of class time + lab time, and even more outside of it. If you want to be a chem major you have to love it so much or you just won't succeed. I'm a CSE Major, and took 1210 for an elective, and holy hell it's the worst class I have ever taken"

You would be surprised how many people either 1) forget to pay their acceptance fee or 2) can't decide where they are going and wait til the last second when they decide to pay it.  It is based on the day you pay your acceptance fee, but even then, once students receive the email with the housing contract a TON of students just sit on it and wait til right before the deadline to fill it out (I've worked about 2.5 years in housing and this still holds true).  What I would suggest is staying on top of everything from now on to give yourself the best possible shot of getting a dorm you would like. Look into the floor plans on the housing.osu.edu website (under the residence halls tab)....do your homework on which side of campus/room type you would like and come up with your four choices for buildings and room type so that when you get the email, you don't sit with it and put it off because you don't know what you want.  Call the office later this week or early next week once the university processes that you've paid it and you're in the system as an accepted student and see when you can expect your contract to be sent to you...make sure your OSU email is up and running so that you can fill it out and send it back in ASAP!"

If allegations of misconduct are made against a graduating senior (especially if it's late in the quarter), the Committee on Academic Misconduct can facilitate the hearing process. Even if the allegations are made during the 10th (or final) week of the quarter, the Committee can hear and resolve the case during the early part of the following week.  This would help some of your answer looking for the other part."
OSU,30t72q,Milhouz,2,Mon Mar 30 14:52:04 2015 UTC,does anyone have experience with a second offense?
OSU,30t72q,grrtho,2,Mon Mar 30 14:53:58 2015 UTC,"What type of class was it in? A couple years ago I knew someone who copied someone's lab report for a physics E&M lab - 1 quarter away from graduating - and was suspended for a full academic year. I would rate his at ""severe"" because it was 1/3 of the grade for that class, but I'm not sure how much they take that into account...  Tbh a double offense doesn't sound like good news"
OSU,30t72q,grrtho,2,Mon Mar 30 15:09:53 2015 UTC,It was a class for my minor.. the grade was only 6% of my total grade for the class.
OSU,30t72q,grrtho,5,Mon Mar 30 15:10:53 2015 UTC,"Eh 6% is still a good chunk. Hard to say, but my impression was they take it pretty seriously. They probably let you off as a freshman because you were, well, a freshman. As a senior, I think you're expected to know a little better."
OSU,30t72q,wngmv,0,Mon Mar 30 15:14:33 2015 UTC,it was because of issues at home and my dads terminal illness and how rapidly it has progressed. I haven't had time to write papers because i have been with him and at appointments all the time.. it sucks because I'm not a bad person
OSU,30t72q,wforwumbo1,6,Mon Mar 30 15:16:52 2015 UTC,"Sorry to hear that. Having graduated several years back now, I'll chime my two cents in from an outsider's perspective.  While I'm sure they'll sympathize, the purpose of college is to prepare you for real life - in other words, you're going to be answering to what is the equivalent of your future employer. Saying you executed a project unethically because you have issues at home won't fly. You cost the company money and made a project crumble. It sucks, but that's just the way it works.  It would have been wiser to go the route of asking the teacher for an extension because of your aforementioned reasons. There's no doubt in my mind they would have given it to you. You're given a lot more leniency in college than you are real life.  They play by the rules in the academic misconduct court. It's no different than trying to weasel your way out of a speeding ticket. You were running late to your daughter's wedding? Well that's unfortunate but at the end of the day you were still going 85 in a 45. Not much you can do.  Best of luck and try to take some preventative measures to keep this from happening next time. Hope your dad pulls together."
OSU,30t72q,wforwumbo1,3,Mon Mar 30 15:27:03 2015 UTC,"Sorry to hear about that. Has the issued been reported to the university? If not, go talk to your teacher asap. I've been TA at OSU before. While most of the professors are very strict about academic misconduct, if you explain to them what the situation is about, and make promise that you will catch on the work as soon as possible or offer some kind of remedy and showing that you are not ""a bad person"", they might agree to let you go.  But in general, I agree with grrtho. I know in my class professor usually will give you some extra time if you go and talk to her BEFORE you decided to do something bad."

OSU,30t72q,arijen,3,Mon Mar 30 14:51:50 2015 UTC,"At the bare minimum you're failing the class OP. They don't take kindly to plagiarism. I have a friend who was caught cheating on 5 tests, as well as the final (yes he's an idiot) and they didn't tell him he got misconduct, until after the semester ended. But he failed the class. Since this is the first occurrence of this brand of misconduct, I'd assume a similar punishment. What was the first occurrence OP?"

OSU,30rbyy,wch94,4,Mon Mar 30 01:20:16 2015 UTC,"CSE has pretty little to do with hardware and CE sounds like it aligns with your interests more. Keep in mind that getting a hardware design job is not so easy these days and many CEs end up writing software. That being said, a CE degree is still very valuable, but I would make sure that it is really what you want to do (maybe spend the summer doing some electronics projects). I actually started off in ECE but switched to CSE when I learned about the two more."
OSU,30rbyy,bored-to-death,3,Mon Mar 30 02:33:45 2015 UTC,"I was in the same boat you are. I started out as a CSE student, then switched to ECE to do their Computer Engineering program around the end of my first semester. However, I decided to switch back to CSE after a year because I decided that I enjoyed the software aspect of things instead of the hardware side. For CSE, the only really hardware classes we get to take are ECE 2000 and ECE 2100, which give you an intro to  hardware related things (binary numbers and conversions, gates, flip flops, etc.), with hands on labs dealing with these things. However, I felt as if I didn't really learn much in these classes related to hardware as I had hoped (since these were fairly intro classes). There are some upper level CSE classes that focus on computer architecture, and Systems 1 and 2 take in depth looks at low level programming (with a focus on computer hardware/architecture for a little bit), but for the most part you'll be focusing more on software related things.  Doing the Computer Engineering track is very similar to the CSE track, in that you'll be taking mostly the same classes you would take as a CSE major for a couple of semesters, then you'll branch off. If you're seriously considering the switch, don't feel pressured that you'll be behind in CSE if you decide to switch back. My switching from CSE to ECE, then back to CSE did not delay anything for me at all. You should also talk to an ECE advisor, as they helped me understand key differences between CSE and ECE, plus they were really helpful in the transitions. I recommend Alissa Kasmer, she's one of the best. Hope this helps."

After taking a look at the curriculum for the Computer Engineering program of study i have found out that i would not have to take two classes that i really was not looking forward to taking which are Foundations 2 and Foundations of Higher Math. Though i would have to take two other classes i wasn't planning on taking which are Chem 1250 and Physics 1251. I could then take the rest of my maths at Columbus State and i can take the Physics 1251 class there as well. I feel this would be much more tolerable than CSE 2331 and Math 3345 at OSU. Also the electives i can take for ECE are practically the same as the classes i was planning on taking for CSE such as (Databases, Web Applications, Mobile App Dev, Computer Animation)! I would also be taking more ECE classes (obviously) which would deal with hardware, just what i originally wanted!"

I took Foundations of Higher Math last semester, and I'm currently in Foundations 2 right now and I absolutely love it. Also, Physics 1251 at CSCC is still pretty tough from what I've heard, don't be fooled just because it's a community college."

If we want to get students to explore and enjoy Columbus, that seems like a good way to do it.  EDIT: This article talks more about CoGo in relation to campus.   ""And we have committed to the City of Columbus to work with them to expand the CoGo Bike Share system to the edges of campus to create and nurture a hybrid-system so that the surrounding community can travel to campus.""  “Unfortunately, it’s not possible to have one pass for both systems,” she explained. “But we do have the option for day passes so that CoGo members could use a day pass on campus and vice versa.

Who knows what drives up the cost to such insane prices, I'm guessing a ton of legal stuff to protect themselves.  Whatever I think anything should cost, I just add a 0 and that's what it actually costs.  I think part of the reason the costs are driven up (besides legal stuff) is because of the specialty bikes.  Electric assisted bikes, heavy duty, tandem bikes, etc. probably cost $15,000 each.  I know everyone thinks it's fantastic that these bikes are being included in order to include everyone, but they will never ever get used, besides the frat boys riding the tandem through campus for the novelty factor.  I just wish the university would at least do something with the hundreds of abandoned bikes across campus.

I think each course has a certain theme/topic. Mine was about racism/sexism/isms in entertainment and advertising. There were a couple papers. It was kind of meh. I would recommend it, I guess. THEATRE 2367.01 (writing two) - This was a fun class. We studied different plays and musicals. Some light reading. I think we wrote one paper? There were some comprehension quizzes. Easy. I would definitely recommend this class. Philosophy 1332 (Culture & Ideas/ Ethics) - This was a great GE. Really dove into the different philosophical branches. Discussion of relevant moral dilemmas (Abortion? Death penalty?). There was a research project towards the end where me and a partner chose a case study and used philosophical techniques to debate/explain the morality/ethics of the decisions made. Some short quizzes over reading (occasionally). There was one exam, but I don't believe there was a final. I took it with Daniel W. (I don't completely remember his name - and student center is down). He was a great guy and I think most importantly he didn't even make his beliefs apparent - he remained neutral throughout the whole semester. Would recommend. HISTORY 2001 (history) - I took this class online (distance learning). There was a LOT of reading, but overall the class was pretty easy. There were some quizzes (10 questions) throughout the semester - but none of them were very difficult. Every week, we had discussion questions (we chose 2) to respond to. We also had to respond to classmates' discussion questions. At the end of the semester we got to choose between writing a long paper (yuck) or doing a prezi (like a powerpoint but cooler) with a brief paper on a topic of our choice. Our topic had to be pre-approved. I'd recommend this class. ENGLISH 2281 (literature) - I'm taking this class right now - it's probably my favorite class since I've been at OSU. This is the African American Literature class. I took it because I was really interested in the black history portion of the history GE I took. Attendance is mandatory. There's two reading assignments every week (each are around 2-30 pages). We have frequent quizzes (1-2 per week) usually averaging 10 questions over reading comprehension. Dr. Koritha Mitchell teaches this class. She researches lynching, and has written a couple of books about it. She can be intimidating to some, but I really enjoy her and her class. I would totally recommend this class UNLESS you    are close-minded get offended easily have a tendency to speak before you think don't want to do a lot of reading (or don't have time to read - you can't just skim in this class or you'll fail the quizzes) don't plan on taking the class seriously    And those are all the GEs I have taken/am taking so far. Of course, my choice in GEs has been tailored to me and my interests. My advice - choose a GE you think you'll like because you probably will. I haven't taken a ""bad"" GE yet.

OSU,30reip,moiramcglynn,2,Tue Mar 31 06:31:11 2015 UTC,"Definitely look at the new dorms being built, on north campus (Torres, Raney, Scott, and Bowen)....cool layout and brand new as of Fall 2015 semester.  The newly renovated south campus ones are a good idea too (Park-Stradley and Smith-Steeb). It's more like living in a hotel than a dorm.  There are enough quiet places on campus for you to find when you need to study, and honestly I thought being in a ""quiet"" dorm my freshman year was a good idea too, but even if it is quiet, you have some loud personalities or you find yourself procrastinating in your room more, so I found it a lot easier to just find a quiet classroom or post up at the library for a bit.  Also, the honors dorms are in super old dorms, Bradley doesn't even have air conditioning.  I, personally, would rather live in a nice brand new and air conditioned building and walk 5 minutes to the library than the alternative housing for honors students."

OSU,30m25u,Nefari0uss,1 point,Sun Mar 29 17:05:37 2015 UTC,"me and my friends have been there for the last two   Awesome! The main issue is that we never seem to get a enough people/teams on the CSGO signup list for a tournament at the event. I had talked to a good 30 or so people via FB, in person, etc who said they would love to show up and play CSGO. Last time I kinda-sorta ran one, there were only four people. Pretty big difference.    Would have had even more but a few were doing the dota tournament which was on at the same time so they couldn't play with us.   I think we've moved the timing this year but I'll double check.   Also, when buckeyeLAN primarily advertises it as a LAN for LOL and dota its no wonder people don't know about it for CSGO.   That's a fair point. I hinted that we don't really expect CSGO players to show up because of low attendance in the past so we don't put as much focus on it. I suppose that led to a cycle of cause and effect which decreased attendance. That being said, from what I've seen, CS has seen a huge amount of growth recently. I'll be sure to mention this point in our next planning meeting.  It doesn't help that we don't have anyone that is particularly knowledgeable about CS. If we did, I'm sure we could do a lot more for it."

The majority of pre engrs struggle because of the transition to college. You will meet a lot of new people through your dorm (if you are living in the dorms), and more than likely they won't all be engineers. For the first few weeks it's really important to branch out and have fun, but at the same time develop a good routine. At the beginning of the semester a lot of your classes might not seem too difficult, but you need to dedicate time to them ever if it is review. That way when it's half way through the semester and your work is pilling up, while a lot  of your friends have free time, you will be prepared to get through it. I would also highly recommend setting time to go work out 3-4 times a week. It's a great stress reliever and you will feel better all around! Let me know if you have any other questions I can help with! I hope I was helpful."

OSU,30ljzq,InterestedInThings,5,Sat Mar 28 14:26:57 2015 UTC,Working is really hard to do when you are first starting out. I would say 10-15 hours. When you do get a job it will be pretty overwhelming but if you can stick it out for the first three weeks or so it will get much easier. Try to get a job in a library or as an office assistant in your dorm. You can normally do homework while you work with those two.   Edit: For dining do not do the unlimited or the weekly plan! Depending on how much you eat chose between the 350 or the 450. I heard they are changing they work though so my info might be outdated.

I also worked out regularly (it's nice to get off your ass once a day because you may be sitting for long periods of time for schoolwork) and I got involved with a couple of clubs. Getting a job at the front desk of your dorm may be a good option, but be prepared to work crummy hours occasionally. It's all a give and take.

The numbers just point blank don't work out. They barely work if you're in-state.  If you're making $8/hr, working 20 hrs/week (which is pushing it), you'll only be making $2400/semester. Tuition is closer to the $5-6k/semester range. If you work at $12/hr at 600 hours over the summer, you're pulling in another $7200. You're looking at making $12k a year - that's just in-state tuition. You still have living expenses etc. Out of state tuition, it's closer to $25k/year. Granted, scholarships can offset a lot of this.   One of my assumptions is that you can handle 20 hours/week while taking classes. That's a lot of time.   I guess my point is that I don't know your financial situation, but it may be borderline unreasonable for your parents to expect you to maintain semi decent grades (and retain knowledge) with an engineering courseload if you're working all the time to pay for tuition.

If I do between a class I make sure to exhale when there's a break in the crowd passing me because I know people have problems with it. As far as designated smoking areas go, I've seen people just kind of make their own behind different buildings and other places not a lot of people frequent"
OSU,30f4yl,thedonuggs,6,Thu Mar 26 21:44:30 2015 UTC,"The enforcement is literally to politely remind people of the policy and the intended effect is to make it so non-smokers breathe cleaner. So far, I think it's doing that."

OSU,30f4yl,TheToasterIncident,5,Fri Mar 27 01:10:50 2015 UTC,"People will always smoke. A lack of ashtrays or designated areas will make smokers litter, making nonsmokers angrier, polarizing people further.

A smoker is a brief annoyance if you walk right into the cloud compared to the constant unsmellable smog we get from living in a city.

OSU,30f4yl,thelonelyward3,-1,Fri Mar 27 04:53:48 2015 UTC,"Of course it is, people smoke all the time, and generally people don't care unless they're smoking it directly in peoples faces. This is why people see smoking on a smoke free campus as a norm. It doesn't matter if its declining an ingrained cultural idea does not have to be consistently prevalent. Not to mention the reason its declining is things like the Surgeon warning, and things like the endless smoking commercials. Smoking is still a cultural norm will it change eventually? Most likely, but at this moment on 3/27/2015 its still in our culture."
OSU,30f4yl,usedtobias,1 point,Fri Mar 27 05:29:29 2015 UTC,"just not really sure what you're basing this off of.  of course smoking is still, to an extent, ingrained in our culture.  calling it a norm is... peculiar, given that smoking rates have been below 25% for some time now.  there are also more and more universities and even cities engaging in more aggressive anti-smoking campaigns.  honestly, people are less receptive to the idea of smoking now than they've ever been at any point in history.  look at the top comments in this thread; most are people being like ""yo, fuck smoking, these rules are great.""  all of which makes your initial statement of ""it's not a big deal if someone does it anymore"" kind of baffling.  if there has been any point in the past century when it was a big deal that someone was doing it, it is literally right this very moment.  we are having a discussion about people being bothered by smokers in a wide open public space, when twenty years ago the idea of it being banned altogether in tiny restaurants was contentious.  it's a bigger deal now than ever."

It's basically like the justices filing a suit themselves. Imagine if a federal judge took it upon himself to just decide the legality of a law, without anybody ever suing in the first place.  The bigger issue is that the judicial panel approved petitions for OSU Divest that did not include a line on every page for the circulator's signature. The case brought against OSU Divest mentioned above was used to remove their petition from the ballot, under the reasoning that there was no circulator's signature on every page... Despite the fact that the forms were approved without a line for it.  So it all seems very shady. A bunch of judges who opposed OSU Divest approved a faulty petition form. Then when the petition actually made it on to the ballot, they skirted around conflict of interest considerations by getting their own clerk to file suit against the group for having a faulty petition form.

It's drama about how an relatively obscure branch of USG handled a voting initiative that probably wouldn't have passed, and that even if it had passed, wouldn't do anything because all it would mean is that ""The student body is IN FAVOR of the university divesting"" and would undoubtedly go ignored by the University.  The executive side of USG actually does really cool stuff like organizing Block for Hunger, where you can donate goods from the C-Store using your leftover blocks at the end of the semester), Network to the Nines, a professor-student networking dinner that just started this year, Academic Enrichment Grants for funding extra-university activities, advocating for higher education funding in the State capital, and organizing the It's On Us campaign to reduce sexual violence on campus, among other things.  Hell, from stuff as simple as doubling the length of time you can keep your buckeyelink/carmen/buckeyemail password to bigger policy changes/ like getting the university to change the meal plan away from the Blocks system and bringing a bike share to campus next year (the latter two being impacts of the legislative branch, to their credit, although I think even they will admit that USG's legislature is far more dramatic than the executive). USG actually does some really cool shit.  The real USG situation is that this stuff isn't promoted or as attention-grabbing as headlines like impeachment or resignation, which in the grand scheme of things, really doesn't have much of any impact on students, unlike the stuff that isn't getting this attention."

For example, one of our previous meetings mentioned that RadioShack is filing Chapter 11 Bankruptcy and that there's an upcoming Spring Hardware MAKEathon (April 18th-19th). Then we discussed shift registers, like how they work and how they're extremely valuable if you need more input/output pins than your microcontroller has available (at the compromise of speed). Then we built a circuit that controlled 8 LEDs using only 3 pins. And ate pizza. :D  At another meeting we got free stuff (which was really old junk that had little value, but possibly useful, like old laptop power supplies, USB floppy drive readers, old FPGAs, various resistors/capacitors etc.) and, of course, ate pizza.   We also have open lab hours in which members come in and work on their projects, ask questions or merely hangout. The lab has soldering irons, oscilloscopes, signal generators, power supplies, multimeters, etc. If 24hr lab access is desired, members must pay a nominal fee of $10 due at the beginning of each semester.

OSU,30bj9i,Rumpelblumpkins,0,Fri Mar 27 01:55:04 2015 UTC,"What year are you? Girl or guy? For fraternities, dues are going to greatly vary depending on what house you join and what their social schedules are like. The more social fraternities that have 2 or even 3 events a week are going to cost more than chapters that rarely have events or those that do not at all.  For social fraternities expect to pay around 800 a semester, but costs range from 500-1500. It may seem like a lot, but most of your money is going to provide things for you and your chapter. Parties, bar tabs at social events, house improvements, brother/sisterhood events, alumni events, etc  If you live in the house, dues and meal plan (you have a chef) are included in your housing payments.  For many houses it's actually quite cheaper than living on your own and buying your own food.  Sororities operate a bit differently and since I'm a guy I don't know all of the inner workings. Dues and housing are usually a little bit more expensive than fraternities, but they usually have nicer houses.   There are some other costs you need to factor in as well. Things like formal trips or recruitment dresses (that you are required to buy) can sometimes add up.  If you are in high school however then the above may not apply to you. Next year's freshmen class will be required to live on campus their sophomore year through the STEP program.  If you are in a Greek chapter you can live in the house as a sophomore if the chapter complies with the STEP program. We haven't heard how this will effect housing prices or if the university will be involved."
OSU,30bj9i,GarandThumb,1 point,Fri Mar 27 20:56:16 2015 UTC,"Gotcha, I think I'm going to try to rush non-STEP houses, and I definitely am interested in a socially-active house. I'm currently a senior in H.S. so I'm pretty unfamiliar with this shit. So I understand that dues are probably gonna cost around a grand each semester and I'll be paying several grand for impromptu shit like formals each year, but how much could a guy expect to pay for housing/meals? Just trying to prep my parents for the fact that I plan on going Greek, and since they're not very receptive I'm probably gonna have to find a way to pay for my own housing (currently saving up)."
OSU,30bj9i,Rumpelblumpkins,0,Wed Apr 8 03:05:34 2015 UTC,I think most houses will end up going the step route eventually. The ones that don't initially are the more social ones that want to retain their autonomy. Meal plan for fraternities is usually around $800 and it's all you can eat. Housing varies widely. For my fraternity it's pretty inexpensive but for others it can be pretty costly. No fraternities require you to live in the house so you have the option of living in your own apartment/house.
OSU,30bj9i,GarandThumb,1 point,Wed Apr 8 12:35:58 2015 UTC,"So with the STEP houses they're all gonna have to throw parties in annex houses, no?

OSU,30bj9i,Rumpelblumpkins,0,Wed Apr 8 18:32:37 2015 UTC,"It depends on who the advisor is. I'm sure there will still be some parties in the main houses, just maybe not on the level they are now. And no, living in one of the houses is way cheaper than living in the dorms. Dorms are like $900 month or something ridiculous and you are required to be on one of the expensive meal plans.

OSU,309nel,clegolfer92,2,Wed Mar 25 17:02:30 2015 UTC,Congrats on graduation! See you there http://commencement.osu.edu/for-graduates/academic-costume.html
OSU,309zt7,GrandMasterC147,7,Wed Mar 25 18:04:07 2015 UTC,"The only thing that will show up is a W. This doesn't raise nor lower your GPA. However if you're applying to graduate programs or secondary programs (Med, Law, etc). It could come back to bite you, because they don't look fondly on them. I got accepted into my graduate program and I had 2 or 3 W's. If it's your first, I really wouldn't worry about it, drop it and ace it come autumn!"
OSU,309zt7,wforwumbo1,6,Wed Mar 25 18:07:26 2015 UTC,Thanks! It is my first so I think I'll be good then!
OSU,309zt7,wforwumbo1,7,Wed Mar 25 18:08:58 2015 UTC,"What year are you? If you're a freshman, you can just fail the class and use freshmen forgiveness and only keep the higher grade. So that way you get high grade and no W!"
OSU,309zt7,Chattz,6,Wed Mar 25 18:17:24 2015 UTC,The first grade will still appear on his transcript though
OSU,309zt7,Featherfy,3,Wed Mar 25 18:31:08 2015 UTC,"yea but having a higher grade the second time around instead of a C/D that he or she will have to spend 3 year raising is much nicer From experience...i wish I dropped calc 2, ended up with a C after they curved and now I'm having a really hard time raising it to an alright GPA. 2nd sem sophomore at a 3.31, had a 2.82 during that semester"
OSU,309zt7,Na__th__an,3,Wed Mar 25 19:11:35 2015 UTC,hard time raising to alright GPA  3.31
OSU,309zt7,Featherfy,4,Wed Mar 25 21:01:13 2015 UTC,"dunno your point here, but that isn't a competitive gpa at all and it really limits your opportunities for scholarships, summer internships, etc;"
OSU,309zt7,sxeQ,3,Thu Mar 26 01:19:14 2015 UTC,"I've had multiple people tell me one W isn't a problem. I wish I had dropped Calc last year. I kept going, and that C is a pain in the ass to bring back up."
OSU,309zt7,CharwalterEE,2,Wed Mar 25 21:41:01 2015 UTC,"You need to speak to an advisor as soon as you can.  If it is a coreq for a class you are currently in, you may have to drop both.   No matter what, talk to an advisor."
OSU,309zt7,bumpymind,1 point,Wed Mar 25 21:49:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, if only it were someone's entire job to help people with problems precisely like this.   But that would be too simple!"
OSU,309zt7,Baileycu,0,Wed Mar 25 21:55:49 2015 UTC,you know someone could see an advisor and post on reddit...
OSU,309zt7,kinnunenenenen,2,Fri Mar 27 16:38:54 2015 UTC,"Other people have given good advice about dropping a class, and yeah calc II is really hard. Before you drop it though, I would talk to the professor to make sure that there really is no chance of you passing. Depending on the prof, you could still be eligible for a Passing grade even if, mathematically, it doesn't seem like it. It might be too late now, but something to keep in mind for later classes. Best of luck!"
OSU,309zt7,Baileycu,1 point,Fri Mar 27 12:33:23 2015 UTC,"/u/GrandMasterC147 can you tell us the difficulty you had with calc II and what you would do different taking it over again?  Calc II is ridiculously more difficult than calc I for me...I had to drop it for this semester :( feels impossible. Even ochem is a breeze compared to calc II (got a B+ in ochem 1).  I can do example problems but exam material is a huge step up, not sure what to do. Calling all redditors, reaching out for help!!"
OSU,309zt7,cincy11,3,Fri Mar 27 04:11:19 2015 UTC,My biggest issue with 1152 was probably that I underestimated how hard the test were. being a freshman I doubt I have a lot of useful advice but I'd say asking the professor for additional problems to practice on. They usually have some that they can email to you once a week.
OSU,30bpls,goomba5454,1 point,Thu Mar 26 01:41:08 2015 UTC,It's possible that all of the spots are taken as there are not a lot of classes.
OSU,30bpls,Zigran7,2,Thu Mar 26 01:54:12 2015 UTC,^ Probably the case. Most people would have scheduled for maymester ~3 weeks ago. I'd suggest looking for one to waitlist.
OSU,30bpls,mitchman6,1 point,Thu Mar 26 02:47:22 2015 UTC,I just registered last night and not a lot were full. A lot of classes aren't offered. I was able to find a Spanish class and a PoliSci class for my last two GEs though.
OSU,30a9nl,Featherfy,2,Wed Mar 25 19:15:52 2015 UTC,"Possibly, but they give priority to students that work during spring. Dining Services is literally always hiring though and kcomm and 12th Ave are open this summer."
OSU,30a9nl,radical13,1 point,Wed Mar 25 23:43:58 2015 UTC,"OSU dining definitely isn't fun to work for but it's a job. Summer is pretty easy, it's only orientation and camps that come through. You don't have to be full time, I was only taking 5 hours last summer. However I started in spring semester so idk."
OSU,30a9nl,sxeQ,2,Wed Mar 25 21:39:49 2015 UTC,"I'm looking. Don't really want to get stuck with something that really relies on transportation, I don't have a car for the summer. I Realize the COTA exists but I'd only like to use it more around campus. I really hate spending a half hr on the bus to get to and from places."
OSU,30blfs,DPoe,1 point,Thu Mar 26 01:08:15 2015 UTC,"hey, me and my friend are looking for a place in fall if you have two rooms available pm me"
OSU,309xtn,4arc,5,Wed Mar 25 17:50:12 2015 UTC,"As a grader for Mike (as he prefers to be called) and a previous student of his for Systems I, I have to say Mike's a cool guy. He really knows his stuff, and he's extremely patient with his students. He won't mislead you, and he's tells you exactly how you're going to be graded, even if some students don't listen (this is grader me talking now!).  Even ignoring all this, usually your other options for Systems I are... quite terrible. I haven't had any first hand experience, but all the CS&E majors have heard the stories. If Close happens to be teaching it in the next semester she's also a great pick, but otherwise grab her for Foundations II and Systems II."
OSU,309xtn,BetaByter,3,Wed Mar 25 18:05:14 2015 UTC,"If you're willing to take an 8am, Christopher Domas was a GREAT Systems I professor."
OSU,309xtn,Na__th__an,3,Wed Mar 25 20:56:02 2015 UTC,"Can confirm,  he makes the topics actually interesting.  You do some really cool projects and you really learn the material."
OSU,309xtn,LibreWulf,1 point,Thu Mar 26 02:18:28 2015 UTC,I forgot about Domas! Have also heard great things about him as well.
OSU,309xtn,BetaByter,3,Sun Mar 29 23:38:53 2015 UTC,"Mike is the man. He's a great professor, and I really understand all of the material in Systems I because of how he teaches"
OSU,309xtn,WolfBad,3,Wed Mar 25 18:46:35 2015 UTC,"I have him now and he's great, especially considering your other options. The past midterm consisted of all the topics he specified on the study guide. He's very thorough when answering questions, promptly responds to emails, and is active on Piazza. He genuinely wants you to understand the material.   I personally find the material very dry and often space out, but thanks to the slides (thank goodness), labs, and Piazza, I've had no trouble keeping up."
OSU,30b293,MaryJuanas,10,Wed Mar 25 22:41:36 2015 UTC,Depends what you want to do at these events? Food? Gaming? What are you interested in?
