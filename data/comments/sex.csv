sex,3e1n5t,ekdp,7,Tue Jul 21 11:57:48 2015 UTC,Doesn't need to be full 69. Imagine a t-shape instead. Guy can still get their digits to partner's crotch. That angle can be made smaller (swing hips toward a 69 position) to make it easier.

sex,3dzamc,FiddleSierra,416,Mon Jul 20 19:15:03 2015 UTC,"Do you both engage in enough aftercare following your sessions? Not just for her, but for you as well? It might be helpful for you to talk about your conflicted emotions afterwards, and for her to ensure and reinforce you that she loves throat-fucking and degrading dirty talk. Furthermore, if you don't do this already, maybe try taking some time to cuddle, exchange 'I love you's to each other (or other pillow talk), get her a glass of water, or give her a massage to show how much you care about her well-being and to help you reconcile some of the opposing ""I just fucked my wife like a slut/I deeply love and cherish my wife"" feelings.  And just from a different perspective, as someone who really, really enjoys facefucking and degradation as well, I never, ever feel like my SO is hurting or disrespecting me. I love it because it's so incredibly hot for me to see my partner dominating me like that. I love how submissive it feels for me, and I love the feeling of ""being used"" that way. I enjoy how much pleasure it brings him and how it feels like he just can't hold back because of how good it feels."
sex,3dzamc,sodomize_intolerance,77,Mon Jul 20 20:47:16 2015 UTC,This. Reassurance and tenderness afterwards!
sex,3dzamc,Girl_Scout_Motto,12,Mon Jul 20 21:30:12 2015 UTC,What is aftercare? how would one begin it after sex? I'm just curious because I've never done something like that but wonder if its should he done/what is it.
sex,3dzamc,lumpydoodle,47,Tue Jul 21 03:30:01 2015 UTC,"Aftercare is the process of attending to one another after a very emotionally and/or physically intense ""scene""/session. It's also a time to reconnect to reality and re-establish roles outside of a scene. For some people, it may involve unwinding/recovering physically, such as getting re-hydrated or cleaning up, and/or it can be emotionally, such as cuddling, pillow talk, etc. It's to make sure that both partners still feel loved, cared for and connected to one another."
sex,3dzamc,sodomize_intolerance,92,Tue Jul 21 03:42:45 2015 UTC,"Its hard to explain, just for example when i am really rough with her and i am completly into it, then i am looking at her and .. suddenly i am thinking ""what am i doing? why do i treat her like that?, shes the person most important im my life and a deeply love her ! and now shes gagging on my dick with tears running down her face"" but on the other side it`s looking so hot! and she likes it ... so why should i feel wrong about it.. why am i even thinking about this BS i am constantly switching between this two perspectives"
sex,3dzamc,armchairepicure,125,Mon Jul 20 20:13:36 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you may be suffering from a touch of spectatoring. Like, the in the moment you is totally turned on and into it, but then your mind switches on and starts analyzing what is going on and it turns you off.  Look. It is perfectly healthy to want to throat fuck your wife. And yeah, I can see an obvious conflict between what society deems as respecting your wife and being kind to her and the image of her gagging, with tears running down her face and snot leaking out her nose. But you have to remind yourself that your wife has consented to the deep throat fucking, including the bit about looking like a hot mess. She knows what's up. And she is ok with it. Which means, you aren't disrespecting her even in the slightest, society be damned. In this moment, your penis in her throat, it is just you and her against the world, and who cares what they think of you.  So. What do you do? When you feel your brain turning on and over analyzing the situation, be mindful. Take a deep breath and look at your wife and know how much she loves you and how she is enjoying throat fucking. Remind yourself that you ARE respecting your wife and vice versa, that engaging in a sex act that challenges social norms regarding respect is the ultimate example of how you respect each others' needs, desires, and fantasies. Remind yourself that, behind closed doors and with consent, it is nobody's business to judge you (even if it is you judging yourself). And remember, you can always pull out, give your wife a passionate kiss to show your deep appreciation and then start up again."
sex,3dzamc,Bad-Selection,30,Mon Jul 20 21:31:53 2015 UTC,"very good advice, thank you (not that the other ones are bad but this one is exceptional =)"
sex,3dzamc,Sir_Cei,19,Mon Jul 20 22:41:54 2015 UTC,"The only thing I might be able to add to what /u/armchairepicure is saying is to remember the love and how that ties into the throat fucking.  For example, I absolutely love throat fucking my girlfriend, and she loves having it done.  But we've been dating for a few months and we've been friends for 10 years.  I'm rough with her, downright brutal sometimes, but we're only like that with each other because we love and trust each other that much.    When I'm ""forcing"" her to deepthroat me, I'm looking at the woman I love, who loves me, and we're engaging in an act that takes a lot of trust to do.  I'm only able to be like this with her because she loves me enough to let me.  And with how much we both love rough sex and oral, we're being aggressive with each other to fulfill a need for each other.    Again, as /u/armchairepicure said, the two of you engaging in an act like this, one that maybe society says is wrong, deviant, or morally questionable, and making it as enjoyable as possible for each other can be a strong expression of that desire to satisfy one another, to engage in what each other enjoys and fantasizes about.     You two are doing what you can to satisfy each other, even if others say it's ""wrong.""  Honestly, the way I see it, that's actually really sweet."
sex,3dzamc,jayellz,6,Tue Jul 21 01:18:58 2015 UTC,"This...this is really helpful. Thanks!  ;)  (I've never heard ""spectatoring"" used like this before; definitely something I have a problem with!)"

sex,3dzamc,MisterKnut,27,Tue Jul 21 13:56:51 2015 UTC,"It might help you to remind yourself that the two of you are roleplaying. You are a caring husband, but you play the role of some meathunk just taking what's his however he pleases. And she's loving it."
sex,3dzamc,Phishguy,11,Tue Jul 21 00:14:13 2015 UTC,"This is exactly what I logged on here to say. The only thing I'd add is that she could be playing that role of the slut you fantasize about, too. It's a fantasy that you both are bringing life into. As long as you have a safe word, or signal, in this case, for her, there should be nothing to worry about.   Another thing that might help is to change the appearance of it, while in the fantasy.  I say it that way because it could be anything. Like some prop(s) or a disguise, rearranging of certain furniture, or even just a different colored light."

I then refer to myself as his girlfriend instead of his ole' lady. (not that he calls me ole' lady either but it's all role play) I often do this when we are hitting the bars for a night on the town too, that leads to some hot raunchy sex when we get home."
sex,3dzamc,snugglemybutt,29,Tue Jul 21 04:01:13 2015 UTC,Liking something as a fantasy vs as a reality is a real thing. It could just be a fantasy that you just don't enjoy in real life.
sex,3dzamc,nyctophilist,38,Tue Jul 21 08:29:10 2015 UTC,If she's happy and enjoys it then I don't see what there is to feel guilty about. Just remind yourself that you're both having a good time and just enjoy yourselves.
sex,3dzamc,da_chicken,8,Mon Jul 20 21:16:17 2015 UTC,"Frequently fantasy is different than reality, and so something you might fantasize about, when applied practically, produces a different reaction. That being said...   my Wife is enjoing it, and has no problem with it at all, she even likes it more rough, so this is not the problem   Would it help if she were to be more effusive after the fact about how much she enjoyed it? Or maybe during, you could ask that she reassure you that she is indeed enjoying herself. Telling you how much she loves being your slut, or how much she loves it when you fuck her face. The positive reinforcement might help the guilt your feeling."
sex,3dzamc,AlcoholicPresident,5,Mon Jul 20 19:56:13 2015 UTC,that sounds like a good idea
sex,3dzamc,SexualCommentary,9,Mon Jul 20 22:42:33 2015 UTC,"If you're legitimately upset or turned off by this, then don't do it.  There are other ways to have sex, and other fantasies to explore.  Pick something you both enjoy, or try again and find something new you both enjoy.  There are several fantasies I've had that, when explored, just didn't measure up and weren't worth the effort.  If I kept on, they'd just spoil the fantasy for me.  I used to fantasize about anal sex.  Then I tried it with a girl who loved it.  I found it mostly worse than PIV from the same position.  Now I do it if the girl wants it, but otherwise I don't really think about it.  You shouldn't feel ashamed that your fantasies don't get you off when you act them out.  Trying new kinds of sex is like trying new kinds of food or new kinds of music.  Some food smells amazing, but then you try it and don't like it.  Some artists are amazingly respected and highly appreciated, but when you listen to them it's... ""meh.""  That's not wrong.  That's normal.  Some people would even say that if you're not finding things you don't enjoy, then you're not really exploring.  Now, that's not wrong either -- a satisfying sex life doesn't always need constant change -- but if you like to explore, you should be happy when you find things you don't like.  Now you know something about yourself that you didn't!"
sex,3dzamc,JessicaB224,7,Mon Jul 20 23:28:45 2015 UTC,"Try doing other rough things with her and look at her to see how she reacts. Spanking, Choking (carefully), grabbing with a firm grip, general ""man handling"" are great warm-ups and can get you both in the D/S mindset. Accompanying this with verbal dominant language usually gets both me and my girlfriend turned on.  After everything, always ask for feedback. Make it clear that you want her to enjoy it as much as you do because you find her so sexy and you just turn into a caveman around her. When you better understand her limits you should feel less guilt around pushing it there. If something goes too far make sure you back off on it and thank her for the honesty--and have fun!"
sex,3dzamc,nevendingsisyphus,7,Tue Jul 21 03:08:27 2015 UTC,"Lot of good answers and thoughts here but I'll try to throw my two cents in... I have similar fantasies as well as similar afterthoughts. I've always been interested in ""rough"" porn per se, and my first opportunities to have rough sex really terrified me because as sex so often plays with opposites, I'm a pacifist by nature and I have trouble thinking of even hurting people I don't like. The first girl that told me she liked to be handled and forced to do things in bed intimidated me because I was sure I'd hurt or scare her but managed past it anyway. Since then some girlfriends have had thresholds well past what I was doing, and some have ended up scared or hurt during sex in which we immediately stopped and I did what I could to care for them.  I ended up noticing during these occasions that I also felt these bouts of shame or fear and second-guessing myself during the act, ""How could I possibly behave so aggressively? How could I do something that in any other context, and by any other person I would view as atrocious and abusive?"" I also noticed that to some extents even within the realm of domination, the fantasies I enjoyed in my head or in porn were a little bolder than what I would do in person, and in some cases if I tried doing these things in person I didn't find myself enjoying it nearly as much as watching someone else do it.  I would say you should consider two things.. For one, try to decide and appreciate if there is a matter of two thresholds to your sexual interests, one being mental/visual and the other being personal and practical, in which you may appreciate something sexually without necessarily taking part in it. On the other hand, I think of a quote I appreciated from House of Cards, ""everything in life is about sex except for sex. Sex is about power."" - sex is a game of opposites in so many cases, the most powerful people in the world are the most likely to look for dominant partners to take that power away, the weakest people are more likely to look for means of domination. I being a particularly gentle person who never fights or loses a temper, enjoy significantly more aggression than you would ever otherwise see. You're likely experiencing your natural principles overlapping with your sexual desires which makes you hold back and think in the way that you do - the best I could advise is to listen to what many redditors have already suggested and talk to your partner, ensure she is completely comfortable and you are both aware of the boundaries that you may have in and out of bed, and remind yourself that you are not stepping out of those boundaries when you are rough with her. Let yourself succumb to your sexuality completely if you're lucky enough to be in a relationship where those desires are accepted, and know that who you are in bed and who you are out of it are different people, and as long as you behave within the boundaries you both set, let that aggressive, throatfucking beast truly have a pass for the things he does because in every other way you're a loving and caring person in what seems to be a completely healthy and loving relationship.  I apologize for the verbose response but I hope I got the point across how I imagined, the context is rather personal to me.  TL;DR: Your nature in and out of bed are conflicting, take some time to think about what any difference between what you like thinking of/watching vs. what you like actually doing, and then remind yourself that you're not truly doing anything wrong, because out of the bedroom you're still clearly in a healthy and loving relationship. And as reddit always says, keep that communication strong."
sex,3dzamc,JessicaB224,14,Mon Jul 20 19:39:00 2015 UTC,"I had a similar experience with exploring bdsm. I found myself slapping my boyfriend's penis one night and suddenly had a ""WTF am I doing?"" moment. I thought about it and decided I strongly felt that if my idea of fun and pleasure was causing pain to someone I loved, then I needed to examine my emotional health rather than examine my aftercare practices.  I sometimes think rough, violent, and degrading sex is condoned too much in sex positive communities. If you feel guilty about throatfucking your wife, maybe it's time to examine what turns you on about throatfucking. Power, dominance, desperation, disassociation.... These aren't necessarily healthy emotions to indulge in, whether in a loving sexual relationship or not."
sex,3dzamc,iyamgurting,6,Tue Jul 21 01:02:13 2015 UTC,"thank you for this comment, i really felt alienated in this by all the answers which just say, get over your bad feelings, they come from society. sometimes one does something and it feels wrong, one should truly look at these feelings. and i'm not speaking about feeling guilty, guilt might come from very different places, but just feeling that something is off or wrong... than one should truly question the actions. it it might not be about her, but because onself is not comfortable doing it, then it dosen't matter if she likes it or not, if it feels wrong for me, i stop it because of this personal feeling not because i'm afraid if she likes it or not. if she has a liking to it is something different."

sex,3dzamc,beaglebagle,4,Mon Jul 20 19:59:33 2015 UTC,It's important to recognize that what we fantasize about may not be what we actually enjoy doing. Real life is much more complicated and nuanced than the fantasies in our heads.
sex,3dzamc,RR_4150,5,Mon Jul 20 22:15:45 2015 UTC,"Honestly I think you should trust your gut. If something feels wrong to you, it probably is. Just because you have a particular fantasy it doesn't mean that it will translate the same way when you execute it. Fantasy is void of all real-life ramifications. The real world is not, and you're probably thinking that it's a really disrespectful thing to actually do to someone you care about. You probably also feel guilty for thinking of your wife as a slut."
sex,3dzamc,letsplaycachecache,2,Mon Jul 20 23:02:24 2015 UTC,I like it when my boyfriend throat fucks me or spanks me hard to me its showing that I love him physically as well as emotionally and I want him to share my body and bring us both sexual satisfaction. I bet your wife feels pretty similar since she loves you.  Could it be self confidence or overthinking it? All I can recommend is focusing on her and thinking through those thoughts at a different time and think to yourself whether this is a rational thought.
sex,3dzamc,squidperior,2,Tue Jul 21 01:37:54 2015 UTC,"Maybe you could try telling your wife how much you love her and appreciate her in a kind of dirty talk sort of way while your throat fucking her.

We have a pretty open sex life, both pretty much up for anything/don't take anything too seriously. The other day we had sex and at one point I told him to use me (or something along those lines), ya know...that whole ""treat me like some girl you met in a bar and aren't actually emotionally involved with"" kind of thing. Both of us love it but afterwards he mentioned that it can be hard for him to do. We're both going through professional school together and are generally ""on the same level"" in the relationship...truly equals. And he was saying that it can be difficult for him to switch from seeing me as his equal partner to essentially using me to get off. Long story short, I don't think what you are feeling is all that uncommon. From the girl's perspective all I can suggest is make sure you keep that communication going and maybe if you got her to ask you/tell you to do things to her during it would help?"
sex,3dzamc,suhayla,2,Tue Jul 21 00:41:19 2015 UTC,"Maybe try role playing like that with a safe word, so if you say something that crosses a line you can stop an apologize or something.  But you'll know its all fine and dandy when she doesn't say it so no need for guilt."

You're having a very normal, cognitive and emotional reaction to doing something culturally less normal, by vanilla standards, of how you're supposed to love and respect your SO. I'd be far more worried if my loving partner DIDN'T have some concerns about ""degrading"" role plays. You sound very healthy and fine to me. If it helps, choose alternative names for role playing so, once those 'characters' have come out and gone away again, you have the more familiar boundaries of your real world in tact. This could also lead to a post on reddit where we all get to name your characters...just sayin..."
sex,3dzamc,Queen_E,3,Tue Jul 21 02:16:13 2015 UTC,"I've had mixed experiences from the female side of this fantasy. Sometimes I'm in the mood for it and it's hot, but my guy is respectful of comfort and limits. Sometimes not in the mood, and it will make me feel gross/sad. Also, if you're turned off when you actually act it out then you should feel okay with that...this fantasy is rooted in domination and a kind of violent sex act, and after a short period of time or done the wrong way it's actually unsafe and unhealthy for the woman. (The gag action, upside down drool/stomach acid is not healthy, no one should debate that). so if you are turned off that is pretty natural...not wanting to do something that's not great for your partner on a physical level.  I'm actually working out some issues right now with porn and fantasies...I am attracted to rougher stuff but I'm also a feminist so basically I'm so fucking confused when I see a woman getting degraded and it turns me on. I have some theories about why this happens...violence against women and the fear of assault is something I think about a lot...I think one thing is when I see similar things in porn it kind of neutralizes it a little bit and helps me confront that...also I'm more of a sub which is kind of me working out my issues with control/power/being a woman in society, etc.   sorry to go on a personal tangent but I would say trust your experience and feelings about acting out a fantasy. A lot of things in porn we are turned on by, in real life aren't so much and are actually degrading and dehumanizing...(the messed up part though is, it is real life for the actresses/actors - the voyeurism of porn makes us feel like it's not real, but it is and it has an effect on everyone involved)."

One woman wanted me to spit on and smack her face. At first I thought it was weird. No other women ever wanted that.  To be fair, everyone gets rougher during sex then by that definition. The pace always picks up at one point or another and the breathing gets heavier, etc. But I agree with the commenter that says to not worry about what we think or want. Just do what pleases her. If you feel weird, then I get it. Just think about how much you're pleasuring her when you do what you do. Looking at her face helps and so does her overall body language and the sounds she makes. You can clearly tell when a woman likes something or not."

sex,3dzamc,bluescrew,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:22:27 2015 UTC,"My husband is the same way. Stop over thinking it.  If she is like me, I love to be face fucked.  If I could be face fucked each day, I would.  My husband says it's not intimate or it doesn't feel like he can connect with me when we face fuck, so we mix it in a few times a week.  But it's my favorite position.  As long as he is not too hard, like 100%, I let him pound my throat as hard and long as he wants.  I have no gag reflex so sometimes I will force a gag to bring up saliva and make it messy, but anything he says, does, or brings up during sex is totally okay with me.  I've thrown up once while drinking, and pulled him back down onto me so he could finish fucking his mess of a wife.  It was probably our best session, but like I said, I have no gag reflex so that doesn't happen often.  As soon as it's over and we are in that weird transition back to reality, all the whore/slut/bitch talk quickly gets forgotten and we joke around and are cute and sensitive to each other as always.    The few things I am sensitive about is being hit with his dick, being slapped or choked.  It doesn't hurt me or bother me, but I will respond in an over sensitive manner so he doesn't get carried away.  For instance, even just a light hearted choke I will overact to make sure he doesn't get carried away.  He doesn't want to hurt me so he keeps it playful.    Enjoy your face fucking!"
sex,3dzamc,Cfchicka,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:41:46 2015 UTC,"I just want to throw this into the conversation. I write erotica for a living and lot of my stories have  brutal and messy throatfucking. I've found that more women buy these books and come back for more than men. For example, one of my books was downloaded 500 times and my estimate is that about 350 of them were by women. That means that maybe you should stop thinking about it as your kink and start thinking about it as a way to fulfill hers. I, as a woman, cannot think of a sexier thing. It helps my husband that I invariably cum multiple times in the process, but it doesn't change the fact that many women love having their throat used and abused."

In the situation you've described, OP, you are placing the opinions of people outside your marriage (what would society think about me throatfucking my wife, I'd be so ashamed if anyone found out) over the opinions of the woman you claim is the most important person in your life. She should be all that matters. She thinks this is hot, just like you do. When you listen to a vague outside moral authority instead of her, you are telling her that her feelings and desires don't matter."

Pick her outfit, or if you're not terribly fashion confident, pick her undergarments. Extra - buy her some lacy underwear, in colours and fabrics you like and have her wear those. Having you make the choices about those things will transfer some of her control of the morning routine to you.  Open doors (especially the car door..), pull out chairs, hold the umbrella. Chivalrous things. They've become uncommon, but a big part of dominance is care. It also says that your lady is delicate and may not be able to handle those tasks herself.  Set up a routine for foot rubs or hand massages. Mostly because they feel amazing.. And also because foot rubs (or even having her wash your feet for you, hear me out) are a way to have her kneeling. Kneeling is almost universally synonymous with submission.  Take the loofah from her, and you do the scrubbing in the shower. It'll feel a bit like a treat for her, and also a control thing for you. And you can get worked up for the bedroom with all that slippery naked flesh."

Polite Anarchist is right that a lot of this is about acts of care that can be well integrated into a daily routine. Those can be cast in either a dominant or submissive light. So, if you like the idea of picking her outfits for example - when you pick her clothes it's putting you in control. But you could just as easily instruct her to lay out your outfit for the day and make you breakfast in the morning while you relax in bed, and that could be an act of submission and service to you, ensuring that you don't have to concern yourself with clothing or making oatmeal or whatever. See how that works?   You two can also think of adding some protocol to your day - for example if you are usually home from work later than her, you could text her that you'll be home in 15 minutes and she has to put on a certain outfit / fix you a drink / kneel and wait for you to arrive / present you with a spotless living room / etc.   Kneeling or sitting in ways that reflect your dynamic in general can be pretty great. At home sometimes I sit on a sheepskin on the floor and He sits on the couch. It's very relaxing to me to be at His feet.  EDIT: a big thing to discuss is how much you two are willing to do in public, because in a non kinky setting people might interpret your behavior differently. I would feel bizarre having doors opened for me and such, personally. For us, protocol exists mostly in the home. In public we're very subtle, for example, He might lead me into a room with His hand on the back of my neck or my lower back. But that's about it."

Her blackmailing of you was incredibly invasive and manipulative of your personal rights. I know divorce isn't an option but trying to make a relationship work with someone who is clearly religiously devout is not going to make you happy in that area. I understand the complex nature of familial relationships and how tumultuous things can get once something ""goes wrong"" but as soon as you find a way to become independent financially and socially you should leave the relationship and face the backlash that comes if your wife is not willing to be flexible with your rights as a human.  You made a note about seeing a religious counsellor about your problems, which I highly oppose the idea of because it could result in revealing your secrets to your family, especially if you are well integrated in the community it represents. Consider seeing an independent professional marriage counsellor whom will assist you based on actual understandings of the carnate desires and intricacies that do not come with a religious guide."

Be prepared to live the consequences for taking that stand.    Know that there are a lot of people out there who do the things which would bring about condemnation from people like your family and wife and the 'wrath of the lord'  and they're doing just fine.  If you do become liberated from your upbringing and past circles, don't become the proverbial kid in a candy store.  It's much like those kids living on campus during their first year of college from homes that are tightly controlled.

Start thinking about the life you want to have.  Your 20's are coming to an end, but you still have lots of time ahead of you.  Do not waste it.  Chalk this up to a learning experience.

Which, if divorce is not an option, leaves you shit out of luck in terms of getting her to change. Your best bet right now is to start focusing on yourself. Go see a therapist for you, not for her. Work on finding the strength to do what's best for you without allowing family to dictate your life. Open a private savings account and start putting a little money in there every week that will be dedicated to something you want and care about. Whatever you do, do not get her pregnant.

I have been reading all of them almost as they pop up but haven't really had anything substantive to reply with. I'm not sure yet what I'm going to do, but I feel like just the fact I've opened up about how I feel (even if it was just to a mass of anonymous internet strangers) helped me, psychologically. I probably picked this board because I figured there would be at least a few people on my side, some who'd say just dump her (honestly is there a married man alive who hasn't at one point or another harbored that fantasy), and understanding there would be others who would give advice to the effect of healing what can be healed and make the best of it out just call me a dumbass for getting myself into it in the first place.  The bottom line, to me, is that I've externalized my emotions. I more or less successfully expressed my frustrations and was able to look at them through the lens of other people's reactions to what I said.  No matter what I and my wife end up doing, it's pretty clear there's work to be done somewhere, somehow. Again, I sincerely thank everyone who took the time to weigh in. I can't promise I'll update, nor to be honest am I sure it would be something people would come back to, but if something interesting happens or a solution presents itself that I feel might benefit someone reading my story, I will certainly make the effort.

sex,3e1wqf,EurekaShriek,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:16:56 2015 UTC,"I think you shouldn't overlook her behavior patterns here. I do think the right counselor could probably help. Religion does often generate sex shame, and if she's gaining weight and also ashamed of her body she's kind of in a downward spiral away from that form of intimacy.   If someone is gaining weight and doesn't want sex, they may be depressed. Also she may have some hidden negative past with sex. Maybe her dad watched porn and molested her, maybe one of her parents cheated... I don't know.   Something in her head that's very negative is associated with nudity and sexuality. If it's just the religion, a smart, solid christian counselor should be able to help that.   But it could be more.   I recommend you approach your wife with empathy and curiosity, while also taking active steps toward the future you want.   And you should be honest with her. Tell her that you want to have sex more regularly, that you want to try new things, and that you want to do those things with her (do you? do you desire her?) because you see her and love her for who she is (or do you? does she feel that way?)

If I spent the night being sexy with my boyfriend and gearing up to sex and he asked for something he knew I was uncomfortable with, I could see myself getting pretty upset.  She seems to have some severe body image issues. Why don't you try to address those first? I read an interesting article the other day that essentially said that most women respond and get turned on by being desired. Do you think she would like it if you spent time, non-sexually, touching her body? Give her a backrub when you're watching tv. Randomly grab her and kiss her when she walks by. Try to up the non-sexual affection in your relationship, even if you think that it's enough. Try to tell her how much you like her body in very specific ways. Don't just say ""you're beautiful"" but something like ""I just love when you smile like that - you have the most beautiful face"". If you see her cleavage, tell her how perfect her breasts are and how you're glad to have married a woman with such wonderful tits. Don't expect or try to get sex from this. But if you take time to complement her body and give her lots of affectionate touch, she might respond to that. I know that when I don't take my shirt off, it's because I worry my partner will judge my body. If I feel comfortable and beautiful, I want to be seen."

There's nothing wrong with that, and plenty of people are that way.  If this is a dynamic you enjoy, then the two of you could look into exploring the dom/sub dynamic more explicitly.  On the other hand, there might be something about what he does when he's in control that you don't do.  Does he go faster?  Slower?  Deeper?  Shallower?  See if there's a difference between how he fucks and how you fuck.  Also, are you aware of how far in or out his penis is going when you're on top, and are you aware of how it's bending?  Sometimes women don't have a good feeling for safe depths and angles when they're on top, and it can be hard to enjoy the experience when you're afraid she's going to slip out and break your dick."

Talk to him and I agree with the others, he was totally wrong and gross by doing what he did. Go out to a shop together and get him to buy you a nice new one and if he says he wants his own toy, you can shop together for a good safe butt one.   I'm sure he doesn't want to end up in the ER with a not made for butt play dildo stuck up his arse."

And I completely understand where he's coming from and why he feels that way, I have a really hard time letting go and feeling truly comfortable with myself when we're having sex, or when I'm in the mood. I don't know how to let go and be comfortable! It's like when we're in the moment, everything is blocked and I can't think of what to say or do that's different or special or exciting. I want to be able to talk dirty and tell him what I want, but I just feel so inhibited, and I don't know how to get over it. :( sorry, I know that was a lot of info, I'm just hoping to talk to someone who can understand, and maybe offer some advice."

It turned out she manipulated a lot of the victims to tell sensational stories when they really went into prostitution voluntarily. She also spent a lot the foundation money on herself.)  And there was the statistics being thrown around by Ashton Kutcher and Demi Moore's foundation:  http://www.villagevoice.com/news/real-men-get-their-facts-straight-6431644  There is a phenomenon where people throw out over-inflated claims, and there is a reluctance to correct them, because you are afraid of being accused of not caring about victims when you say the problem is smaller than people think."

I think this is a sign of our enduring sex-negativity - the idea that sex is supposed to be shameful and bad for you at least some of the time is still floating around and causing harm.

Why feel negative? I don't really think 'I didn't like it' is a reason to feel regret, only a lesson not to repeat the thing you didn't like. Some things, more trivial things are kind of different (like that extra piece of pizza you regret eating) but with something like sex...it was an experience, based on a consensual choice someone made.  We should all confront why we feel negative emotions towards ourselves and deal with them ☺️ it is absolutely not easy but you will be much happier for it."

It's really rare for a penis-having recipient to catch it from oral, compared to unprotected intercourse (you're more at risk if you're the one sucking the dick). At the end of the day, those aren't the STDs you need to worry about. Just take some antibiotics, make some awkward phone calls, and everything is back to normal in a week.

Don't worry about not having access to STD testing right now - even if you did catch something, it would take a while to show up in a test anyway; and the odds of that are pretty darn low for receiving oral sex. If you're worried for medical reasons, get tested when you get back.  Personally, I don't see any other reason for regret. It's not like you ""shouldn't have,"" why not? You're not committed to anyone else, and there's no rule governing when the average person can or can't accept an offer for some head. If you've got some serious moral-based guilt, I'd talk to someone who shares your moral beliefs.   Personally, I don't think there's anything morally wrong with what you did. It probably didn't feel ""right"" because it had never happened before, and people are typically inclined to feel that new experiences are ""wrong."" That's not an all-or-nothing statement, just reflecting that in general people tend to feel comfortable with what is familiar and uncomfortable with what is unfamiliar.   You feel uncomfortable after doing something that was unexpected and unfamiliar. Sounds to me like that's exactly the ""right"" way to feel given the circumstance - take a breath, smile, and know that everything is okay."

sex,3dyhac,gabrielle1106,5,Tue Jul 21 02:21:50 2015 UTC,"I was ironically in a nearly exact situation as you when I lost my virginity.  It's like I was reading a letter from my past self in 2005.  Hey, it's cool, you'll live and all sex is not as traumatizing as this was for you.  What I ended up learning from my encounter was that I appreciate sex within the confines of a relationship more than I do casual encounters.  What this meant for me was to be more proactive in finding meaningful sex with people I loved.  I looked back on this with a lot of regret but also with a lot of gained knowledge.  I regretted it because it ultimately meant very little and was about as significant as any other time I'd masturbated except I'd paid someone to do it to me.  I gained knowledge by learning how painfully terrible that first experience is with any woman (I have literally not had a first encounter with any woman that didn't feel like it ended poorly, when I find out later on I'm actually a pretty decent lover).  What should your takeaway be from this?    Know that you're still you, that this feeling of awkwardness will pass in a few days, that no STD with no visible signs of disease is going to be life threatening in the next two weeks (stop worrying about it for now).  Get tested when you get home and travel with condoms in the future.  I turned out okay, I'm married and my SO doesn't know a thing about me doing this.  It's not something I'm proud of and I never talk about it (this is me basically for the first time ever actually telling anyone about this).  Let me know if you have any other questions or need to vent.  I know you've probably got a significant time difference right now so you're probably asleep, but you can PM me later on if you need someone.    Enjoy the rest of your trip!"

The biological imperative that is motivating you to get that load out and into another human is extremely powerful. I've found that as I get older, the only thing I can do is recognize when it's happening. The drive is still the same. I definitely hear you about the socio-political implications of it all, but dude, you won't ruin/save the world with a few small acts as a tourist. It's beautiful that you're sensitive.

You could also try sucking two dicks at once, that's always fun. If you're into getting held down, one gentleman could hold you and make out with you while the other focuses on screwing you or giving you head then they trade places. If y'all are really adventurous, you could be the lucky pierre: strap on a fake dick, fuck one dude in the ass with it missionary style, while the other guy nails you from behind.

sex,3e07pg,unoaime,4,Tue Jul 21 10:10:34 2015 UTC,"So... why is it easier with two straight girls than two straight guys?  No seriously. I think this is an important question for you and your boyfriend to answer independently. The answers don't have to be logical, but knowing them will help you avoid landmines later."
sex,3e07pg,unoaime,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:51:18 2015 UTC,"Cause I am a bit attracted to hot girls myself. And he knows I have been making out with some of my girl friends, which turns him on and probably the most reason that he wanted this act. On the other hand, he is straight, like really straight. So we both feel and think it might be little weird for us on 2 straight guys."
sex,3e07pg,unoaime,3,Tue Jul 21 04:43:01 2015 UTC,"Okay! That's a good reason.  What you're talking about is really two different kinds of threesome. So it's important that you set expectations both for yourselves and for your special guest star- A threesome shouldn't be a spontaneous thing (Sure, it can be, and that can work. But the risk of things going wrong is higher.), it's one of those times when part of the sexiness is discussing what's going to happen.   It's not awkward to talk about it. It's foreplay.  So when you're inviting a lady: Your boyfriend will be the 'center of attention'. Also, you'd like to do some kissing and touching between girls, and see how far you are both interested in going. Make it clear that bailing on a specific activity (girl-on-girl below the waist, for example) will not derail the evening.  When you're inviting a dude: You will be the center of attention, and there will be no guy-on-guy action. Approach this one a little more slowly- you know your boyfriend is okay with you kissing women, kissing a guy might be more threatening. It might be a good idea to let your boyfriend have more control here over the selection process of a guest star, and let him make the initial offer. The idea that your boyfriend (and guest star) have to have in their heads for this to work is that they are fucking you, as sort of a team effort. Find out if competitiveness turns your boyfriend's crank, or if you should avoid one-upsmanship. Before you go shopping for a third, talk through different scenarios as dirty talk between yourselves so that his horny brain begins to figure out how this would (or wouldn't) work.  Lastly- your special guest star isn't a sex toy. While your primary attention should of course being on keeping your partner emotionally happy, don't neglect the needs of your third. Having sex with a couple is a pretty scary proposition, do what you can to make it not only enticing but friendly."

I was casually dating a guy, we wanted to have a little extra fun and had a MFM threesome. It was fine and happened more than once, maybe four or five times.   As the woman involved it was incredibly satisfying, two men, focused on you is great, and also being able to satisfy them both on top of feeling so sexy in that they both want you badly- it's great for the ego.   My casual dating ended and I actually am now married to the guy we started off having a threeway with. As it was casual I don't feel bad, but I would for sure advise being very comfortable and trusting with your significant other if you're going to have one- jealousy can be difficult, so having a very solid relationship is huge."

When I say I've heard the opposite, I mean that I've been encouraged by third parties (usually female friends who I'm chatting with over lunch or something, not people for whom the situation would be relevant) to participate in two-guy scenarios just because they're supposed to be really rare, and when am I going to get this chance again, sort of thing.  I think the 'guys are more willing' is less of a stereotype for non-professionals and more of a porn fantasy, maybe?  Regardless they're horrible stereotypes that are bad for everyone. :p"

I don't have personal experience with this, but the women I've heard of (Edit: I mean women I know who have told me their stories, not all the women I've ever heard of) who've had poly situations do tend to be unicorns because they just want to be part of a couples' physical love for a while, and aren't ready to become fully-fledged emotional members of a multi-person relationship.

sex,3dyeiu,MsLT,3,Mon Jul 20 15:37:35 2015 UTC,"Hi! I've been a unicorn for about... 6 months now?  My couple lives about an hour away from where I call ""home"" (with my fiancé).  I see them about once a week, usually together. Sometimes I'll see one of them alone for a quick lunch date on my break at work or something, but generally we hang out after work all together and we go to a bar or watch a movie and cuddle or something.  Discuss whether you are dating X and Y as a UNIT, or you are dating X and you are dating Y, whether they are together or not. In the beginning, the other lady in our trio was not sure she was comfortable yet with the gentleman going out alone with me. Once she got to know me better, we re-discussed and decided that alone time was OK, as long as all-together time was more prominent.  Discuss what you expect vs. what they expect. Going in, I knew my couple would prioritize each other first-- if they had issues between them, I might be cut out for a while so they could work on them together. I was OK with that because my priority at the moment is my fiancé. Make sure to communicate what, EXACTLY, you are looking for while dating a couple. Are you OK if they keep having them-only date nights? Is it OK if they only see you together? Would you be happy being asked to step down if one of them is uncomfortable with how things proceed? Etc."

sex,3dyeiu,fivemagicbananas,12,Tue Jul 21 06:33:13 2015 UTC,"(26F) As I was reading this comment, I realized that a couple tried to ""Unicorn"" me on OKCupid. I didn't think this was a real thing. I thought it was some sick joke. I live in a pretty old fashioned town raised by old fashioned parents.  Things like this were never heard of.  So when I got the message to ""date"" this couple I freaked out.  What surprised me more was how open they were about it.  It's pretty taboo for me. Just thought I would share this, because I didn't know this was a thing. Do people call this ""Unicorning""? (Completly fucking serious)."
sex,3dyeiu,Krail,3,Mon Jul 20 23:21:32 2015 UTC,"""unicorning"" is a particular kind of non-monogamy (and is actually kind of used as a derogatory term sometimes in serious non-monogamy communities).  There are a lot of complex arrangements of non-monogamy.    To heavily oversimplify it, you might say there are two main components.  In an Open Relationship, a couple agrees that they can experiment sexually with other people.  In Polyamory, people agree that it's okay to be in love with and have relationships with multiple people at the same time.  These two things can be exclusive or concurrent to varying degrees. Couples will be sexually open but stipulate that you can't fall in love with someone else.  Polyamorous groups might form a stable multi-partner relationship and not seek anything else outside of that relationship.  Most non-monogamous people are somewhere in between. Most poly relationships are some degree of sexually open. It's slightly more common for open relationships to be romantically closed.  It certainly sounds absurd when you come from a more conservative location, but it can work surprisingly well in practice.  Doing it right requires all involved to be very mature and to communicate well.  (and you would be surprised how common this sort of thing actually is in more conservative communities.  It just gets hidden because it's taboo)  Anyway, a ""unicorn"" is a bisexual woman who is willing to have group sex with a heterosexual couple, sometimes used with the implication that she will not otherwise get involved in their relationship.  The non-monogamous community sometime uses this as a derogatory term because they see it as a very immature and selfish way of seeing things, expecting someone to be on hand as a sex-buddy without wanting anything else out of the relationship.  (It sounds like MsLT is not being a unicorn in the derogatory sense, and that she has a full-fledged polyamorous relationship going where she is romantically involved with multiple people)"

Just figure out what you want. Are these people you're interested in romantically, or is this purely physical? What are you going to do if it becomes romantic? Do you think that's likely? We're purely in this for the bedoom aspects; we sleep with other people, but we only date each other. Some people do things differently.  On to the logistics side, bring your own favourite brand of lube, a toy you like, and a cheerful attitude. Just like with any sexual partner, listen to what the people you're sleeping with are saying or expressing. Did he really like it when you went down on his girlfriend? Good! Show off!

Or oral for the first round and then move on to sex, and partway through she or you can do some light manual stimulation on her clit for the second orgasm? Switching it up like this is what I find works for multiple climaxes for me 90% of the time, it's rare I get off again the same way twice in a session because of sensitivity as well ."

I feel the same way, so if my guy wanted another one, we give it off a little break, talk about some sensible stuff and then he starts again with frolicking my nipples until I am all wet again and my clit is just about ready for another stimulation. Clit and the head of the penis are almost the same way sensitive after orgasms."

I've got a first date on Wednesday with a girl who looks waaaaay out of my league. I don't get it because even though I made sure she knows what to expect, she said that she doesn't mind. Maybe I'm just lucky, but I can't see chicks digging the Michael J Fox movements. I have no relationship experience though since I've been sick for quite some time, and I'm obviously a virgin.  All of my medications have bad side effects, but one of the great side effects that comes from being on a dopamine agonist is that it makes orgasms ridiculously intense, and I can achieve multiple orgasms. It was actually being considered as a source to allow men to achieve multiple orgasms, but I'm not sure who would want to put up with the harsh side effects just to come more than our bodies normally allow. So, for me, this is one of the few benefits of an otherwise shitty drug."

sex,3e30rx,infinit3j3st,0,Tue Jul 21 16:06:52 2015 UTC,"In your shoes I'd try a multi-pronged strategy, heh.  First would be to put together a Tinder account for the both of you.  Make sure you are both well presented in the pictures.  Be clear what you are looking for and be sure to mention what you will do to make sure she feels comfortable and safe (meet in public at first, etc).  Then start swiping.  Second tack - OKCupid.  Both of you make accounts, be super-clear what you want, and reference each other's accounts.  Use the information available on /r/okcupid to optimize your profiles, maybe even submit for a critique.  Third:  A paid service such as Adult Friend Finder - lots and lots of the profiles are fakes or hookers, but there's real action to be had.  Probably skews a bit older than you, but an older woman might be exactly what the doctor ordered.  AFF just got hacked, but to me that implies their security has probably been upgraded since.  Finally, take a look at Craigslist mm4w and see what the competition looks like (hint: be clean, be respectful and you're ahead of most of the posters slapping up dick pics and hoping for the best).  Consider posting there but be aware you may be barraged by gay guys looking for pics.  Good luck, and report back if you get results."

sex,3e0tzw,dukegw,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:29:09 2015 UTC,"I struggle with this problem from time to time and have a few tips for you.  First, don't masturbate or consume any porn.  Part of this issue stems from the physical aspect of masturbation and only being able to cum from the way that you masturbate.    The other part of the issue is the psychological aspect of having what you want on demand.  All of the sexual stimuli being exactly what you want is a good thing when you're masturbating, but can make sex difficult.  The second piece of advice I have for you is to let it be okay.  Say to yourself in your mind, ""Let it it build, let it build.""  If you're the type of person who's asking reddit for sex advice, I'd bet you're someone who is proactive about contraception and avoiding pregnancy.  I'm not saying that you should focus on impregnating your girlfriend, but you should focus on it being okay to cum."

They use dialators to slowly open the vagina, and get it used to something being in there.

The inside of the vagina expands as the woman becomes more and more aroused.  As a woman, I feel comfortable saying that many women, in an effort to be nice, will pretend like they've had enough foreplay and/or are completely aroused when they are not.  I would suggest doubling the amount of time you spend on foreplay, and--crucially--make sure it's the KIND of foreplay that turns her on."

sex,3e2xwg,rhinosoaring,0,Tue Jul 21 15:52:06 2015 UTC,"Isn't the point of sex with someone else that you want to please THEM?   No. If that were the case you wouldn't be posting today.  Clearly you want pleasure, which is a good thing.  Sex is definitely NOT just about pleasing your partner, its about feeling pleasure.  It also involves pleasing your partner, but the focus should be on feeling pleasure.    This means it is your responsibility to make sure you have a good time during sex.  No, that doesn't mean he shouldn't do things for you, but you have to at least ask him for them and guide him into what you want, not just silently expect him to take care of your needs even though you haven't told him what they are.  It shouldn't be hard for you to ask for what you need in bed, it should be fun!  Maybe he is inexperienced, or maybe the people he has experience with enjoy different things than you do, either way, you get to teach him what you like, and if he's a nice guy like you say, he will start doing them.  But he's not going to until you tell him."
sex,3e2xwg,rhinosoaring,0,Tue Jul 21 19:20:53 2015 UTC,"Isn't the point of sex with someone else that you want to please THEM?   Yes, but not everyone realizes this. There are too many selfish or clueless lovers out there.  Do be nice. Being otherwise greatly diminishes your chances of success."
sex,3e2xwg,BoldnessReigns,2,Tue Jul 21 15:58:30 2015 UTC,"Isn't the point of sex with someone else that you want to please THEM?   Perhaps for you and a lot of people. But not everyone has such a giving mindset. I don't, for example. My wife loves that about me because she gets pleasure out of me basically ""using"" her. She loves that she can drive me to that point and that gets her off. So don't take it personally. It's nothing against you. It's just that everyone has different taste with sex. If you don't communicate those taste, then how will he know?   The method I wrote here will hopefully get him to the point that he likes it on his own. But if you start off by making it something he must do, it might not go as well."

sex,3e2siv,smoatoc,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:54:56 2015 UTC,"Start small (fingers, smaller toys, etc.) don't jump straight to your penis. Do lots of warm up (getting used to objects smaller first). Have her wear a butt plug for a bit prior (or even during PIV sex).  Give her an orgasm or 2 first. Ensures she is really relaxed and feeling good. Probably best to do it a few hours after she has a bowel movement (hopefully a good one from a high fibre diet). Shower & clean up real well after that bowel movement. Expect there might still be a small amount of fecal matter. Keep towels or something handy. Avoid any cross contamination. If you finger her butt, don't touch her vagina with the same finger (unless you've cleaned it off).  Use only silicone, metal, or glass toys for anal. These are the safest. Avoid Jelly or PVC/Plastic toys. If in doubt, put a condom on it. Don't go PIA to PIV. Could wear a condom for PIA to make switching easier etc. Some people don't recommend them, but ""relaxing"" lubes can be helpful.  Lubes designed for Anal often work A LOT better than regular lubes (either water based or silicone). Gel type lubes are our favourite.  Don't expect her to be able to take your penis right away. It took months of toying/finger/playing with my GFs ass (on different occasions) for her to be more comfortable with something much larger (my penis) than the toys and fingers she was getting used to. Now she can take a good ass fucking no problem, but I still have to do lots of warm up before she can."

One more question I just remembered:  We have lube not specifically made for anal sex.  I'm assuming we should maybe invest in some actual anal lube or is it possible to use lots of that stuff?
sex,3e2siv,Canadian_Couple,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:09:54 2015 UTC,"You can definitely just use regular water based lube for anal. It just won't be AS good in my opinion. I've tried and used dozens of different lubes for different things. You will likely just need to use a lot more of the lube you have (it will likely be a thinner lube - more runny, and dry up faster). I find thicker lubes (silicone or water based) like the gel kind provide more protection for anal play. But what you have will do fine if you use enough of it. And when you run out, you can try out some different ones. We usually have several different lubes on the go for different things, this is what we have right now.    All purpose water based (All purpose, mainly PIV) Water based flavored (I like it sometimes when performing oral) Silicone (water play, anal sometimes) Gel type water based lube (all purpose and anal) Coconut oil (All purpose lube, massage oil) Anal water based (Desensitizing for anal)"

sex,3e0u5t,danceydancetime,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:21:42 2015 UTC,What /u/danceydancetime said. I had some one who showed me some new perspective sexually and I felt like I had a crush on him which I never acted on because deep down I knew these weren't real feelings and a relationship was out of the question for me. We just fucked and he cared for my sexual desires and made me come harder than any one before. So obviously I was taken with him.   After him I had others and some of them were even more mindblowing. I didn't think there were so many opportunities back then and now I even think that I was holding back with this guy.  Maybe the sex could've been even better but it was a very important stop on my way to get more comfortable with my sexuality. (I was 19 back then. So I was in a very similar position. I had just started university.)  My point: There are a lot of people who are sexually exactly what fits you and will make you tremble and pass out out of pleasure. Just go into yourself and analyse if it's the sex that makes you feel as if you have a crush or just that he showed you some new perspective and you feel attracted to him because he (sexually) cares for you which your former SO obviously didn't.

sex,3e0d2c,ErrantBugbear,2,Tue Jul 21 14:21:25 2015 UTC,"26M here, with what might be a similar situation. I'm not sure whether I know what an orgasm feels like, though. I am also circumcised and very unhappy with it.  I can ejaculate about a third of the time, but I do so without pleasure, usually without relief, and sometimes without even knowing.  Sex is okay, but there's been no sensation from the tip to about halfway down the shaft (past the circumcision scar) once I'm in. Blowjobs are pretty ""meh"" until she starts using her teeth. Masturbation doesn't feel good and leaves me more frustrated than before.  Between not feeling, being depressed/upset about not feeling, and being anxious about it not being any better for my partner or my partner feeling inadequate for not making it as good for me, I also have issues staying hard. If I can clear my head and get into my partner's reactions, I generally don't have a problem staying hard.  I asked the doctor about it, and was told that it probably wasn't related to circumcision. Testosterone and whatever other hormone tests they ran came back normal, and I was referred to a urologist. The urologist didn't see anything obvious, so he referred me to a neurologist and an andrologist. I'm still waiting on those appointments.  I've been using some foreskin restoration methods, currently favoring the tape ring, which leaves the glans nearly completely covered with inner foreskin remnant and shaft skin. I have also been taking naproxen for joint pain. The last few times, I have noticed an increase in sensation. It doesn't exactly feel good, but it doesn't hurt, and it's encouraging to feel anything at all.  Maybe it's a fluke and the stars were aligned just right. Maybe the naproxen cut down inflammation and unpinched a nerve or something. Maybe keeping the glans covered and protected as it should have been all along has improved my sexual function.  If you're circumcised, it might be helpful to look into foreskin restoration. I know that just starting it has helped me a lot with (circumcision-related) body issues I've had for 20+ years."

sex,3dzmjy,hatedheadspace,3,Mon Jul 20 20:57:29 2015 UTC,"My nipples definitely became more sensitive as I had more experience with nipple and breast play. This was a long term thing though. It went from something that was generally pleasant and arousing but nothing more to a way for me to orgasm. It might just take time and exploration of that kind of stimulation. I know everyone is saying this, but you should be honest with him. He might be a little hurt at first, but that way you too will be able to work together to increase your enjoyment of the experience. It might just be that you need things a little different than they way he does it.   Something that might help is the short term is to start out a little bit rougher (biting, pinching, twisting, but not necessarily in a painful way unless you're into that). They will become much more sensitive to lighter forms of stimulation afterward. At least that's how it works for me."

If you want to stay with him I think you need to get him over the whole toys thing. Toys don't need to be a replacement, they can be a compliment to a physical relationship with a person.  Hiding your toys from your family shouldn't be difficult. Get a little box and keep it in the bottom of a drawer, maybe your night stand or where you keep your pjs.

sex,3dydin,throwawayyyyy_420,53,Mon Jul 20 15:22:37 2015 UTC,"Guy here. Maybe something similar to my current situation. I have a beautiful girlfriend. She is fun, kinky, and willing. We get along perfectly and decided to move in together. What we lost when we moved in together was the longing for each other. Having distance literally causes a biological tension that makes you want the other person badly. When you live together you have to DO something to make that happen some other way. But here we are with endless distractions like movies, internet, video games, junk food, etc. I don't even have time to be lazy with Reddit!   So here is my advice: if you want to try and get some excitement back, set up some tension and longing. This could be as simple as suggesting to him that on a specific day (like next Friday) you want to set time for sex. Now if it was me, having that lite nugget in mind would get some ideas rolling. If I started getting turned on on Wednesday, I would probably flirt with my partner in a txt message or something."

Even if I didn't have a girl/never had her but totally had a thing for her it would get a lot stronger over the summer break when I wouldn't see her. OP, I suggest wholeheartedly you give this guy's idea a try.  Quick little aside about /r/sex meta; in my readings on this sub people are too quick to suggest moving on to another partner.

There is usually great advice farther down in the thread but that style comment is often around the top. Sometimes moving on is appropriate but there are many relationships that can be saved with a little alteration of compromise."
sex,3dydin,Freddy216b,2,Mon Jul 20 22:33:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I agree with this. I'm in the midst of trying to fix a dead bedroom and it's much easier to take ""none all week"" if there's a promise of a date night and sex, say, Friday night. The ""maybe tonight, whoops, not tonight, maybe tomorrow"" cycle gets really frustrating after 2-3 weeks of it."
sex,3dydin,Somehumanmale,28,Tue Jul 21 01:23:19 2015 UTC,"For me, sex is one of those things where the more I'm having it, the more I want it. When I get into a bit of a funk (stress messes with my libido), sometimes I make a conscious decision to have sex with my SO even though I'm not particularly horny. I always end up having a great time and having a great orgasm! And then my sex drive slowly returns until I'm craving it all the time!  This is just my own personal anecdote. But it's sort of like having a bite of a tasty treat to make you realize how hungry you were."
sex,3dydin,ilikeoldpeople,7,Mon Jul 20 18:08:23 2015 UTC,"If I remember correctly, the ""the more you have sex, the more you want sex"" theory has been pretty well established with research."
sex,3dydin,snazzypantz,2,Mon Jul 20 22:25:47 2015 UTC,"That makes sense :) I knew it wasn't just me! Sex releases oxytocin, the ""love hormone."" Oxytocin makes you feel happy and loving. When I feel happy and loving, I always want more lovin' if you know what I mean ;)"
sex,3dydin,ilikeoldpeople,11,Mon Jul 20 23:06:00 2015 UTC,"It's possible that your sex drive is the same, it's just that you're being burdened with other things that are keeping your mind preoccupied and not wanting to have sex.  You may want sex, but you may also feel that you're too tired, you still have a huge list of chores to get through, you feel bloated and don't like the way you look right now, and now that you live together, you need some space but he's always around.  Take some time to focus on you and what's going through your head and what can be done to clear those hurdles.  Talk it through with your BF to see if he can help too.  And as unsexy as it sounds, schedule times to have sex.  Decide how often you should be having sex, say, 3x a week, and pick days and times to just do it, even if you're not initially feeling up for it.  Do something like Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday nights.  Give it about 15 minutes of foreplay and if you're still not feeling it, then back away gracefully.  Sometimes, you may not want sex until you're doing something sexy."
sex,3dydin,Onate,5,Mon Jul 20 16:46:01 2015 UTC,Try having sex every night for two weeks straight. Just make it happen. This is what therapists will often tell couples who have stopped having sex. It might fire you back up.
sex,3dydin,callmesnake13,7,Mon Jul 20 18:50:28 2015 UTC,"Here's one thing a marriage couselor told us...""just do it"".  You say you enjoy sex whe it gets started.  So, when your partner iniates, just go with it.  Tell him what gets you and the mood and to take time if it helps. Also, make a point to surprise him with a blowjob or hanjob every week or so.  Don't do it out of obligation.  Do it if you love your partner and you want to make them happy.  Best of luck."
sex,3dydin,incognitoguy,21,Mon Jul 20 19:55:08 2015 UTC,"People with unhappy sex lives cheat and/or leave. If you're only skimping on sex because you're lazy, you need to figure out what's more important to you.. Being lazy, or your SO.   Sex really doesn't even take much effort IMO so I would never accept that as an excuse. However, if you're not enthusiastic about it he'll notice.   You two need a serious talk. And as someone else said, if this is as good as it gets for you, then be prepared to lose him."
sex,3dydin,GingaSnapzzz,3,Mon Jul 20 16:26:55 2015 UTC,When you do have sex does it satisfy you? Not like do you orgasm. but are you actually getting what you want out of it?
sex,3dydin,fuckcomicsans,3,Mon Jul 20 16:54:00 2015 UTC,"My girlfriend has stopped having sex with me and it honestly feels like she's doesn't like me anymore, I wouldn't mind her telling me that she's at least still attracted to me so I don't feel like I'm being used.. So the advice I give you is talk about it guys usually have higher libidos, but that doesn't mean we can work with what we get!"
sex,3dydin,The_Redhead_Villain,25,Tue Jul 21 00:07:13 2015 UTC,"You certainly shouldn't do it out of obligation. Your happiness is just as important as his. He would likely pick up on your lack of enthusiasm anyway.   However, you should make it clear to him that the current rate of sex is about as frequent as it will get. If this is acceptable to him then you can work it out. If not, be prepared to lose him."
sex,3dydin,incaseyourebored,45,Mon Jul 20 15:28:29 2015 UTC,"What's wrong with doing it out of obligation once in a while? I don't see what the big deal is about doing something just for the sake of making someone you love happy. I'm sure there's tons of things the boyfriend does that he wouldn't do if he was living alone, he does them to make her happy."
sex,3dydin,seanjohn12117,25,Mon Jul 20 18:24:24 2015 UTC,Occasionally doing something out of obligation for your partner is not only a good idea but it shows that you care enough for the other person to go out of your comfort zone to please them.  That's not what we're talking about here. OP is talking about an entire sexual relationship built on obligatory sex. That's not healthy.
sex,3dydin,incaseyourebored,2,Mon Jul 20 18:52:17 2015 UTC,"Because sex should make both people happy. If my SO was having sex with me out of obligation instead of actually wanting me, I'd just rather not have sex with her, because I don't want the feeling of sex or orgasm, I want to have fun WITH her.   If she's just giving it to me because she thinks she has to, I'd rather go beat off."
sex,3dydin,StatuatoryApe,2,Mon Jul 20 20:08:32 2015 UTC,This could be a medication /birth control issue. I know my birth control lowers my libido in the same way. Still you shouldn't  have sex if you feel like you have to.
sex,3dydin,squidperior,2,Mon Jul 20 20:23:42 2015 UTC,"Are you depressed? Could you perhaps be depressed? Usually a decreased sex drive and decreased energy level (sudden laziness?) are symptoms of depression. If any of that makes sense, it would be a good idea to maybe talk to your doctor or look into therapy."
sex,3dydin,Kiuoty,4,Mon Jul 20 22:55:38 2015 UTC,"Are you on birth control? This can be a big factor in killing your libido. Do you reject him? My GF is on birth control, and has tried different brands and talked to her doctor about it. But it has killed her libido (noticeably) and she rarely even masturbates anymore. We've talked about it and communicated (like you should). I basically just have to initiate more if i want it more. But she never rejects me, I still take care of her needs (make her orgasm) and I turn her on. She just initiates a lot less. But if you are denying/rejecting his initiations, then you should feel guilty. A healthy sexual relationship (with compatibility) is an important part of a relationship. And you guys just might not be compatible."
sex,3dydin,Canadian_Couple,5,Mon Jul 20 15:25:51 2015 UTC,"Seconding that BC kills the sex drive, and it can happen ANY TIME taking it. I was on the same brand for 10+ years, and at the end my sex drive just died. Currently in month 1 birth control free and it feels like I want stuff ALL THE TIME."
sex,3dydin,downstairs_issues,2,Mon Jul 20 16:12:52 2015 UTC,I am so glad to hear that. My GF hates that it killed her drive. She wants to be horny and want it. She doesn't masturbate anymore. It sucks. I still initiate and we do stuff though (she never denies or rejects thankfully). I'm getting snipped in a few months and she's coming off the pill. So I look forward to her being herself again.

sex,3dydin,rikitiki2,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:35:27 2015 UTC,"I don't necessarily think this has to do with laziness alone. I believe that your feeling of laziness is sprouting from a lack of desire or loss of real interest. As a relationship progresses it's natural for the initial flare and excitement of sex to fade a bit and can tend to feel a bit routine. Without he excitement of something new to look forward to and experience, I guess sex could become viewed as a chore almost unless that initial attraction never subsided. In this case it has so I recommend talking and trying something new and fun for both of you. Discuss some fantasies you both have, maybe buy a toy or two. Even a cock ring from the drug store can change things up a bit. Bottom line is to just try something new"
sex,3dydin,thenewnoise09,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:39:01 2015 UTC,"You are fairly along in your relationship and it is fairly normal for the sex to drop off a bit. However, it is too soon in the relationship to have a deadbedroom. You need to have a talk with him and both communicate flat out-- how many times a week do you desire sex? Sounds weird, but give a concrete number. My wife and I almost had a deadbedroom (she never initiated-- I thought she wasn't interested in me anymore).  Turns out that after that discussion, we both said once or twice a week!!! With that said, if he says 3 times and you say every other week-- you have a problem. If your number is close, you need to set a ""date night"" and stick to it. If you are tired, you will forget about it once you start making love to that man you love and find attractive. It is going to take some work to get your sex life back on track. DO NOT expect it to happen all of a sudden-- it probably won't. You say you are feeling guilty-- out of guilt needs to come action."

sex,3dxz3h,Bad-Selection,8,Mon Jul 20 15:38:42 2015 UTC,"Forgive how my question might sound, but if there's no phone/webcam sex or sexting/cybersexing...well, what do you need to be in the dominant role for in regards to distance?  I guess more to the point is what opportunities would you have to implement it from a distance if you guys don't engage in any sexual activity while you are apart?    I realize that might around insensitive, I'm just curious.  I'm in a LDR with a woman only get to see once every 3 months or so, and I also play the dominant role during sex.  Like I said, I just can't figure out where the need for help is especially if you do fine with dominating when you two are actually having sex."
sex,3dxz3h,p0ryg0n-Z,14,Mon Jul 20 17:06:23 2015 UTC,"Set her tasks to do during your time apart, with consequences if she doesn't complete them.  This can be as small as telling her to not wear underwear for the day, or as big as planning every possible detail during her week (meals, outfits, activities etc). I always found this a really fun way to keep the D/s dynamic going long distance. Good luck :3."
sex,3dxz3h,ajaxsirius,5,Mon Jul 20 16:27:37 2015 UTC,Consequences? What would an example be? How would you enforce them in a LDR?

Some people enjoy having this as part of their dynamic, I don't think it makes a Dom an asshole if his sub is willing."
sex,3dxz3h,dannylambo,2,Mon Jul 20 19:19:10 2015 UTC,"I guess I said it wrong, I meant the Dom is probably viewed like an asshole to anyone not directly involved in the sexual aspect of the humiliation."

sex,3dxz3h,sodomize_intolerance,3,Mon Jul 20 22:10:46 2015 UTC,"This might be a bit tough if you can’t engage in sexting or phone/cam sex. If she’s uncomfortable with being sexual when you are not together, then there’s probably not much you can do. Or if it’s the case that she doesn’t want to be actively involved, but enjoys you taking a more active role, maybe you can try things like:   Writing and sending an erotic story/fantasy for her in which you describe a scene of all the things you want to do to her in explicit detail. Send her a porn video (or erotic story if she doesn’t watch porn) that you know she would enjoy and order that she touch herself while watching (reading) it. The next time that you guys plan to have a weekend together, ask her to prepare a “sexy outfit” for you. When you are together, ask her if she wants to make a sex video together or take sexy pictures of her so that you can use when you’re apart. Ask her to browse an online sex shop and pick out a new toy that she’d be interested in using either as a couple or for herself.   Most importantly, I do think you should have an open discussion with her on how you both would like your sexual relationship to be when you’re apart – it could be that she prefers to be sexual only in person."
sex,3dxz3h,Girl_Scout_Motto,2,Mon Jul 20 17:53:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah you understood my point perfectly and you are right, I know there's not much I can do since she is probably not comfortable, so I'll build it up on the antecipation ;)"
sex,3dxz3h,Nullis_Obnoxia,2,Mon Jul 20 21:06:20 2015 UTC,"Sounds like it needs to be all in the build-up to your next meeting, or things she can do privately. For example, you could tell her she needs to practice deep-throating or work on strength / flexibility of her muscles and then ""test"" her when you next see her. Or depending on your tastes, order her to either masturbate daily in preparation or not get off at all until you see each other. If she doesn't want to get explicit over text,  you could just ask her something like ""Did you do your work for Me today?"" And then she's got to reply with an agreed phrase. Assuming you two like protocol and rituals, it's fun to eroticize the fact that you two don't speak explicitly about sex. Or, if you have common interests, give her reading assignments she has to be ready to discuss with you or some such. It doesn't have to be directly about sex if she enjoys being a sub in certain ways. But again, that depends on your style and dynamic.  When you meet, you can also plan it as a kink date and build up to it in the days before. Send her lingerie she has to wear, or dictate the details of her outfit and makeup. You could set it up so she has a key to your place, and she has to shower, shave and wait naked and kneeling for you to show up, or similar. Give her a part of the instructions every day, to keep her tantalized and waiting.  There are really many ways to work with her preference. You just have to be creative and find other types of D/s games she enjoys. Obviously, ALL these things need to be negotiated beforehand with great care."
sex,3dxz3h,ilikeoldpeople,3,Mon Jul 20 19:41:21 2015 UTC,"Maybe you should discuss this with her. I really have no ideas on how you can express sexual dominance if she doesn't want to get sexual at a distance.   Perhaps you could be dominant in other ways, like picking out what she wears or something, but you ought to be careful if you go that route as it could easily come off as controlling and a lot of women aren't into that.  Talking to her about your dilemma and discussing with her how to better appease her, maybe even coming to a compromise that you both can live with, would be the best way to deal with this imo."

sex,3dyhp3,basuraacontoparahoy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:02:31 2015 UTC,The risk is actually pretty low if a partner knows they have it.  Female to male it's about 4% a year unprotected.  This is one of the reasons I'm curious about people's experience.  Thanks for sharing!
sex,3dyhp3,basuraacontoparahoy,4,Mon Jul 20 20:22:23 2015 UTC,Busting out the throwaway but I was ignorantly carrying the virus asymptomatically for 20 years of unprotected sex with partner and he is still clean.  I must have gotten it from a previous much shorter run so in my experience very easy to transmit male to female not easy to transmit female to male.  Or I personally am not very contagious maybe.
sex,3dyhp3,abigscaryhobo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:19:27 2015 UTC,"easy to transmit male to female not easy to transmit female to male.   Yes, unfortunately, the way male and female bodies are made it tends to be easier for females to get than males.  It's about 11% in men and 23% in women and the risk of transmission is 4% female to male versus 10% male to female.  20 years is a long time...does he get tested regularly or just no symptoms?"
sex,3dyhp3,abigscaryhobo,2,Mon Jul 20 20:30:43 2015 UTC,"Both tested at the end, that's how I found out I carried the antibodies.  No idea if he got further testing, but he is a very blamey person and would certainly let me know if he tested + but by now (almost 2 years out) and with the long relationship without transmission i think its unlikely it would be from me if so."

sex,3dyhp3,bunny69696969,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:50:56 2015 UTC,Yes HSV2 but since never any sores I don't even know for sure that it's genital.  I guess if it set up shop somewhere else that could account for the lack of transmission.
sex,3dyhp3,GWthrowaway79,3,Mon Jul 20 23:06:46 2015 UTC,"Carrier for Herpetic whitlow here. Have had multiple partners and have never transmitted except to the partner who I ""discovered"" it with. We never knew who got it first since we both broke out at the same time. I have told my partners about it, but mine is pretty simple to avoid. All i have to do is avoid the sexin' while I have open sores and put a laytex glove on if I really really wanna get busy/safe."
sex,3dyhp3,FizzPig,2,Mon Jul 20 22:42:26 2015 UTC,Is your whitlow HSV1?  Do you use the latex glove all the time or do you go without for regular manual stimulation most of the time?
sex,3dyhp3,FizzPig,2,Tue Jul 21 00:15:13 2015 UTC,HSV1 yes. And the glove is only when I have sores/scabs from healing or if my partner wants to be especially careful. Basically if im not going into/in/coming out of an outbreak everything functions as normal.  Edit: Finctions
sex,3dyhp3,FizzPig,5,Tue Jul 21 01:16:49 2015 UTC,"Early 40s male here. Had a gf for a year about 10 years ago, she had herpes. Never an outbreak while with me. We used no protection, no antivirals. We both shaved. We disclosed our statuses to each other on the first date, and had unprotected sex that night, no regrets.  Current gf of one year has herpes, same deal: disclosed, sex on first date, no protection, no antivirals, no outbreaks.  We never avoided anything during sex, with both gfs. Lots and lots of genital contact.  I'm tested regularly, tell my docs everything, and have never tested for herpes, saying that if no outbreak, no point in doing a bloodtest. I've never had an outbreak.  I disclose that I've had unprotected sex with gfs who had/have herpes to new lovers before we have sex. No one has expressed any concern over it.  I consider transmission a worthwhile risk of being sexually active. I would not have sex if an outbreak occurs."

Recently I shaved almost all of my husband for a cosplay and I really enjoyed the feeling of his smooth skin the first couple of days. But then the hair grew back, of course.   My husband isn't that hairy but even so, it's too much work for me to keep up for it to be worth it. I like him without hair, but I don't like it enough to constantly shave him.   I am not sure if this is connected, but I tend to be attractive to men who are a little traditionally feminine both is appearance and character."

For a raised-by-the-Internet type person it doesn't seem far fetched at all that they'd come into their first sexual relationship knowing they're into that and where to buy the necessary items.   It's also not the focus of OP's post so it seems kind of strange that the top comment thread is about it, when I read it as just a background detail.

Lean forwards & down a bit (towards him).  Rather than moving your whole body up and down push your pelvis into his cock, so it's more of a pelvic motion. Like when you're bellydancing and undulating your pelvis only. Try hip rotations. Squeeze him every time you're doing the 'up & out' motion. This might also make you feel more as well, I tend to find squeezing pushes me closer to orgasm."

Personally, I can't feel much at all when I'm on top and doing the movement, regardless of penis size, so I wouldn't say it's necessarily because he is small. Start off slowly until you've got a decent rhythm and then gradually build it using controlled movements - try not to vary how far up you go, as it makes it much easier to misjudge and have him slip out."

I like to bounce but the guy has to have enough length to anchor you or it's not safe.  You can literally break his cock if you come down on it too hard.

Try rotating your hips on it and moving back and forth on him without lifting your body off him. Thats what my girlfriend does.

You should try to be supportive in either case.  I'd say definitely be sexually assertive, but also be vocal and communicative. Tell him what you like, ask him what feels good to him. Be open, be present. Personally, even with a completely supportive partner I had to curl up in the fetal position and was unable to talk for a good half-hour after my first time. That's not exactly normal, but it's certainly possible, and my main point is that you should go in wanting to grow closer together more than just wanting to have sex. Sex takes practice."

I don't know how much you've done together, so your mileage may vary, but it's going to be a vulnerable moment.  Didn't mean to be a horror story, sorry. It's good that you're committed; that will help you be able to support/guide him through it. As for my own experience - go slow, at least at first. Everyone's going to be different, so he might end up being a total rockstar, who knows. And for what it's worth, I'd still consider my first an overall positive experience. Brought us a lot closer."

sex,3dz0h1,NicoleMitchell,25,Mon Jul 20 18:03:49 2015 UTC,I used to put up a mental wall that way I could last longer. I eventually got to the point where I started to have trouble orgasming during sex (I even faked a few orgasms because I was just too tired). It kinda sounds like your SO may have a similar wall built up. To be honest it's going to be really hard to break down the wall as our culture says Men need to last a long time to properly pleasure women.   I would start by having nights where you focus one hundred percent on him. Tie him to the bed (he will probably try to get up and start pleasuring you) and tell him that you want him to come FAST and hard. Don't let him touch you or anything you do 100% of the work and he receives 100% of the pleasure. Hopefully you can reintroduce him to relaxing and enjoying sex versus putting on a performance.

sex,3dz0h1,cmacq2,3,Tue Jul 21 03:17:17 2015 UTC,"He may simply be too focused on your pleasure and puts himself into a zone where he can't get off. I try to hold back and not finish before my partner, but in the process of focusing on her and mentally delaying my own orgasm I end up not being able to finish. I find with my GF if there is the possibility of intercourse I can never finish from oral, because I want to get to the penetration so she can experience her orgasm (many things wrong with this I realize) but times when there's no chance for anything other than a BJ (like when in the car or on the beach where we can sneak something in but not full on sex) I relax and enjoy and end up finishing within a couple of minutes. Let him know you really really really aren't interested in yourself but just want to give him pleasure. Tell him you are tired or sore or whatever and don't want sex, that you aren't interested in an orgasm because you have a headache, whatever would be plausible, but that you want to give to him and see him come. If removing this mental block causes him to finish quickly then you've identified the problem, if he still doesn't come then look into his masturbation habits or possibly a lack of sensitivity from other factors like a keratinization glans from circumcision.   But the bottom line is to simply communicate openly and honestly, and if even he doesn't know why then you should both work together to identify the problem and work through it."

With the masturbation habits though, it's kinda difficult with him. See, he hardly masturbates. No....really....I'm not lying. I don't care if he did, I find it 100% healthy and would help him finish if I ever walked in, but I easily watch more porn than he does and masturbate more and I hardly do. I don't know why (because I have given 0 reason) but he's embarrassed by it. I came home once to him just getting started (I got off work early) and he felt so bad. I told him it was fine and I don't care, but he never stopped feeling bad. Idk.....maybe that mildly has something to do with all this...."

sex,3e22gh,iyamgurting,5,Tue Jul 21 14:38:39 2015 UTC,I used to give my ex a full body massage before fucking her brains out. All the dopamine and whatnot pretty much guaranteed that she'd pass out. Worked pretty well.

The best way to learn the things that drive her insane is to spend a lot of time playing and to find out the things that make her explode.  Also remember that you're only a part of the equation.

But your other comment, about it making you feel like you need to pee and shit, that sounds like your whole frame just isn't made for that much girth.  You can try perineal massage to make the skin more flexible at the opening, and make sure you are very, very wet and ready before penetration, but yes you might find more pleasure with a smaller guy."

If I tuck it under my hips it somehow changes the angle of my vagina so it is more comfortable to fuck. Also; go slow, use lots of lube, and have him maintain a nice slow rhythm without putting his whole cock in you. You'll probably notice that there is a point in your cycle when your cervix is higher and he can go deeper,  remember to tell him when that happens, because you can fuck a little harder during that time. Good luck!"

sex,3dy9vh,ericathebarista,5,Mon Jul 20 18:23:23 2015 UTC,"The usual advice is to relax, make sure you're very excited, use lots of lube and go slow. Having him get you off first with oral, fingers, grinding or a vibrator might help.  You might check /r/bigdickproblems to see if they have anything helpful."
sex,3dy9vh,rhinosoaring,4,Mon Jul 20 15:02:36 2015 UTC,"You might just need some more foreplay/warm up. The vagina has the ability to expand rather well, but not instantly. It takes a lot of foreplay and arousal and the vagina will expand. I can't just take the largest dildo we own, lube it up and shove it in my GF. It will be uncomfortable and hurt her. I'm not as big as your boyfriend, but I still can't just instantly shove my penis inside her (even with lube). Oral, fingers (start with 1, then 2, then 3), toys (smaller, and gradually bigger), lots foreplay, and you should be super aroused and your vagina will expand and be used to larger objects."
sex,3dy9vh,Canadian_Couple,2,Mon Jul 20 15:03:36 2015 UTC,"It depends on what you mean when you say the sex is uncomfortable or painful, as that could be related only to size or it could be related to your collective technique as well. Is he bottoming out? Does it just feel too big all around? When it hurts, do either of you insist on continuing even though it doesn't feel good?"
sex,3dy9vh,superjerry,6,Mon Jul 20 16:15:58 2015 UTC,"we usually do missionary with me on the bottom even through I personally prefer doggy.  When its uncomfortable it feels that way because it makes me wanna pee and take a shit at the same time. when it hurts its usually because too much friction or because he's hitting my cervix. i guess the only thing i can really compare it to is jamming a metal pole up my vagina. after sex my vagina also feels sore.  I usually try to indure it until he cums, unless I just cannot hold it anymore. He also lasts like way too long for me, so there's that."
sex,3dy9vh,Countbyran,4,Mon Jul 20 16:32:25 2015 UTC,"I think investing in some lube would go a long way to making it more enjoyable, and be sure to tell him what hurts and how to make it fun for both of you."

sex,3dy9vh,superjerry,3,Mon Jul 20 19:58:00 2015 UTC,"It sounds like he's not taking enough steps to ensure your comfort / satisfaction during the act.   If you wanna pee and shit at the same time, this might be due to his girth and how much you feel stretched. This sensation might go down with more lube and slower movements. If it hurts because there is too much friction, that might require lube as well (but I will make another point later). If he is hitting your cervix, that means he's not putting into account your anatomical differences while fucking you. Some women actually like this sensation. You do not seem to be in that category.   That being said, you use the word ""indure"" [sic], meaning this is not pleasurable for you. Conveniently enough, if you're not enjoying yourself (not being aroused enough) that means:   your cervix does not tuck up and away as far as it could, making it easier to hit your vagina is not as wet as it could be, making friction more of a problem, and your vagina is not as relaxed as it could be, making girth more of a problem   My opinion is that he needs to focus less on fucking you and cumming and more on turning you on. Sounds like you're just in there to wrap around his dick. If you are not deriving ANY pleasure from the act, then repeating the same things and hurting you isn't going to make the sex any better.  Perhaps try a good long oral session? Or using a toy to warm you up and even allow you to cum first before actually having PIV intercourse?"
sex,3dy9vh,routesixtysix,0,Mon Jul 20 22:20:46 2015 UTC,FOREPLAY! Seriously it sounds like you need at least 10 minutes of him 'warming' you up! Then if course he has to start slow. Come join us at /r/bigdickproblems for all of the best advice on handling a big one like your boyfriend.

It's kind of deceptive because a wrist is relatively flat and wide, whereas a dick is more round so a wrist looks way bigger than it really is.   Try wrapping your middle finger and thumb around your wrist and see how much your fingers overlap, then get good and hard and repeat with your dick. I bet you'll be surprised that they aren't too different  EDIT: why am I being downvoted for pointing out that it's not ridiculous to have a dick with the same circumference as a wrist..."

Put a lot of lube on his dick and slowly put it in.  Do slow and deep motions so that your body can adjust to his size After about 5 minutes, take his dick out Finish him with a hand job or blow job For the next month, have sex daily and follow these tips (with PIV sex lasting just 5 minutes). At the end of the first month, increase the PIV sex time to 10 minutes After the end of the second month, increase the PIV sex time to 15 minutes"

I'm gonna take the opposite position and tell you that vaginas have a definite finish line, and no amount of lube it going to make 8 inches and huge girth feel good. I think you are physically mismatched, which is really crappy if you are in love with him. If you aren't, I'd encourage you to say, ""NEXT!"" and find a more average-sized guy."

If you don't want your parents to know you're calling try to find a pay phone or just go in person to make your appointment.  Edit: typo

They handle these kinds of claims specially, exactly so as to not cause the kind of crises you are worried about.  ""Teen-sensitive"" claims (basically anything to do with reproduction, sexuality, or drug use) are described in paperwork with innocuous phrases like ""office visit"".  The insurance company would much rather pay a $50 pharmaceutical claim every few months than a $10,000 labor-and-delivery claim.  Find out what type of insurance your parents have.  If you don't know, you can ask the clerk at the waiting room of your doctor's office or even call the Benefits department at your parent's employer (both of which are specifically forbidden by law to tell anyone you asked, and have to be retrained in the law once a year).  Google ""<insurance company> help line"" and get the phone number for the insurance company.  For example, Aetna is (800)872-3862; CIGNA is (800) 997-1654.  Call them -- yet another person who is required by law to keep your confidence -- and ask about payment rules and privacy.  But remember -- all this privacy bullshit goes out the window if you (or anyone else) are seen as a ""victim"" of a ""crime"".  In California, if you are month shy of 18 and your boyfriend is a month over, it is a misdemeanor and someone might feel obligated to report it.

What that something is and how decipherable it is depends on the provider and the insurance.  My suggestion is to reach out to planned parenthood and very specifically explain what you want, why you want it and what you want to avoid.  Unfortunately, you are not the first person that has to hide their sexual health.  Planned Parenthood exists primarily to help people take their sexual health into their own hands, even when others are trying to prevent it.  They may also have advice on birth control options that are less noticeable or disruptable (in case you parents find a pill pack and lose it).  On a more personal note, I am so sorry that you are stuck in a situation where you feel you have to hide this from your family.  No one should be afraid of their parents and no one should have to hide their health from their family."

You will be able to move on your own, and see what pleasure you or not :) if you want a bit more depth, ask him to put his hips upward, and the rest is up to you :) but learn what makes you feel good first, as it will greatly help him"
sex,3e1397,Pbd33,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:34:15 2015 UTC,"Birth control can definitely affect your libido. If your libido/level of arousal has dropped since you're on bc you should probably talk to your doc.  Apart from that YOU need to figure your body out first before you can help him imo. How can you expect him to push the right buttons if you don't even know them yourself?  If you don't like to masturbate on your own, do it while he's at your side. He can jerk off as well or join in on your self-exploration. Have fun, be naked together, fool around....don't concentrate too much on orgasms and/or PIV."
sex,3dyze0,supersonick_95,13,Mon Jul 20 17:56:49 2015 UTC,It depends on the woman and the birth control. A drop in libido is a known side effect of some hormonal birth control.

I had a hard time producing lubrication down there when I was on the pill, and that was even when I could be bothered to think about sex. I battled with depression, weight fluctuation, migraines, and some other stuff. Basically it sucked.   I switched to an IUD about 3 months ago and the change is unreal. I still am not as horny as I was before BC, but it's so much better now. I would suggest maybe trying something different?"

We had to use lube and I swear my body just fucking absorbed it because I'd just dry up :(   I also had issues with cervix sensitivity, it used to hurt like a mofo when he hit it.   Every once in a while (I think it was a certain part of my cycle even though I was on a monophasic) I would be into it and everything would work and it would be glorious.

However, some other options (e.g. hormonal IUDs) only affect your reproductive system's hormones locally. I'd suggest giving those options or other non-hormonal options some consideration."

sex,3dyze0,WhiskeyHeart,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:06:03 2015 UTC,"Before I went on birth control I was constantly horny. Like ridiculous sex drive. All I thought about was sex and I had so many dirty fantasies that it was ridiculous. I would masturbate every night, more than once. Then I went on birth control and I was fine for the first year, but after that my sex drive completely diminished. I wasn't interested in having sex, I didn't masturbate, I started having negative thoughts about sex, thinking it was disgusting and degrading. My boyfriend could literally be at my crotch eating me out and I wouldn't feel anything other than irritation. It really affected our sex life badly, we would end up having sex only once a month and it was a huge chore for me... I never got turned on so it was always painful.   One day we got into a fight about valentines day... his parents weren't going out that night so I was like ""great, I can't wait to awkwardly shuffle from your room to the bathroom and I can't wait to force myself to be quiet the entire time."" and he snapped back with ""Yep, just shitty sex as always."" That really hurt. I started thinking about why I had no sex drive and I started worrying that our relationship would fall apart if I didnt try to resolve the issue. So I went to the doctor and explored my options - I'm on antidepressants, but I can't exactly go off of those, so we decided to see if getting off birth control would help. I got a copper IUD and now, 4 months later, I'm exactly back to where I was before. Constantly horny, fantasies all the time, can't stop thinking about sex. My boyfriend is loving life again, and we can't keep our hands off each other.   So.... yeah.... birth control pills killed my sex drive, and I will never go on them again."

It sounds, from your description, like he's getting what he needs and you're not. You say you've tried opening up sexual communication and he's not hearing you. Counseling may help him open up and give you both a safe and constructive way to express your feelings about your sex life. Maybe he is unsatisfied too and you just don't know it! I think counseling is the best way to figure it out: with a trained professional who specializes in these types of things."
sex,3dxyq4,ekr6,2,Mon Jul 20 14:40:40 2015 UTC,"Yes, we have been to counseling numerous times. Our counseling issues had more to do with our communication issues and problems regarding respect for one another due to our differences, my ADHD and mental illnesses, and his own issues like OCD tendencies and Aspbergers tendencies. We only touched a little bit on the sexual issues in counseling. The counselors suggestion was for him to be open to trying new ways of initiating. He will do it for 2 weeks and then stop. I'm open to going to counseling again but I can't make my husband's penis bigger nor can I change his personality. I'd be more than happy to hear what kind of concerns he has although he swears that he has no problems with me. I have been very generous and have made suggestions very lovingly and also very bluntly yet nothing seems to change anything."
sex,3dxyq4,tfresca,5,Mon Jul 20 14:56:26 2015 UTC,What about a sex therapist or link friendly therapist? Also counseling can be a good way of negotiating an exit. Before divorcing though try a separation. Like move the fuck out the house separation. He puts in minimal effort due to minimal consequences.
sex,3dxyq4,ekr6,2,Mon Jul 20 19:52:49 2015 UTC,"Definitely going to couples counseling and /or a sex therapist. I definitely feel like he puts in minimal effort due to a lack of consequences. The only time things have really changed in our relationship is when have expressed a desire to leave.  Sad that it had to come to that but it often did.  My state legally requires a one year separation before divorce, so a separation will happen if I'm considering the option of divorce."

sex,3dxyq4,UristMcfly,10,Mon Jul 20 15:05:10 2015 UTC,"Cheating is not a good idea.   Divorce isn't a bad idea.   Being miserable is also an option.   Trying to get your husband to have meaningful communication with you regarding your (both of you) sexual needs is a worthy goal,  but making him actively listen will be difficult to impossible.    You have no options here that are satisfactory in all respects,  you're probably going to wind up cheating on the guy,  once is rarely ever enough.   So then you become a cheater,  inevitably he find out,  and then what does that do to your family?   Kid grows up with divorced parents and your ex really has a decent reason for not liking you very much."

What is saving us is counseling. Start now. The biggest benefit is learnin to active listen and the cognitive behavioural approach of trying to understand my emotions and why I react the way I do.   This can really help you communicate your sexual needs in a way that he can hear it, as well as allowing him to express his own needs.   Good luck."

He can become comfortable that it's not something wrong with him, just a sensation you like to feel.  Make sure he knows you do enjoy sex with him and are looking to add to it, not subtract from it, and that you want to make it better for both of you, not just him  One thing I like that my small hung partner did (I know that's not exactly your situation but similar) was he would insert a couple of fingers during spooning sex or girl - on - top and push toward my G - spot.  I like it also with the Boyfriend who is thick, but learned it from the sport sized guy.  I feel for you, it's hard to make such momentous decisions.  I went to a counselor when I was going through that, and her advice was to consider realistically what my life would be like without him, how would things work for me and the kids if he was out of the picture.

It seems like you are putting in a lot of effort and trying different things, but tackling an issue like this on your own sometimes isn't enough. Get the help from a professional! They can help with the communication issues, the physical incompatibility, etc.  Cheating is a bad idea. You will probably regret it and it certainly won't ""scratch your itch"" and magically resolve your marital issues. Either get counseling and work on this, or divorce him."
sex,3dxyq4,B_Good2All,3,Mon Jul 20 18:14:20 2015 UTC,"Don't cheat, you will only be more unsatisfied after you return to your reality. I 100% understand and respect you for not wanting to divorce, (My husband and I made a pact to never use the D word.) but you have to understand that with that choice comes the understanding that you will never be 100% happy with the way things are.  What people don't say enough is that's ok! Marriage takes work, its fucking hard, as well you know. Before divorces were commonplace people sucked it up. They made their own happiness.  So you have crappy sex. It's up to you to decide ... is the rest of what you have together enough for you to stay? Can you have time to yourself and masturbate when the sex isn't enough? Can you make him feel good and feel good about doing so?  Sometimes you just have to let go and be a woman about these things. Weird as that is to say. Make the choice and make it final in your head, then seek your own happiness that fits with that choice.  Keep working on the kegels, seriously. You can also get pelvic weights (I own these and love them), these feel awesome and help things tighten up. Get a vibrator, especially one that works well during penetration like the wevibe touch or the  lelo lilly, these fit between you while he penetrates - I own the wevibe touch and adore it.  Last, try the original wevibe, it's a neat design that fits inside you (which will help with the size issue) but is marketed towards helping you stimulate your gspot, which should help shield your husband's ego. It's an awesome toy!  P.S. Anal with a smaller penis + a toy to double penetrate is awesome. Also, when I wear one of my more ""rounded"" butt plugs and my husband fucks me vaginally its amazingly tight. Explore!"

If you read my other posts, you will notice that it is not just sex - the sex issues are symptoms of general intimacy issues due to A LOT of things. I want to work it out but I feel exhausted and defeated after several counseling sessions and very little improvement.  I am not in a place to decide if I am ready to commit no matter what. I feel like if it were not for my son, I would leave. I am coming to terms with the idea that a child may not be enough to sustain our marriage but it doesn't mean I am not going to put in my best effort. Is it tempting to find a sexual / emotional connection elsewhere? Yes. Does it mean I am going to act on it? No."

Being comfortable avoiding your triggers will NOT equal repair and coping skills.  He can be ""aware"" of your sensitivities, but is not obligated to refrain from anything that triggers.    Reading your post was really exhausting.  I love him, but hate this I want this, but can't do it because X  We are great together! But his penis is too small.    You tend to build your own bridges to cross.  There is no situation in which you are truly ""trapped"" only the temporary perception of being trapped.   A good man to help you with your special needs child and love that child as you would is hard to come by. You have what you need in life look inside for the ability to cope, repair and grow.  The rest of life is work and challenge for your emotional issues.  It's easier with a partner who loves you.

sex,3dxyq4,BiznessCasual,0,Tue Jul 21 01:37:15 2015 UTC,"My triggers do not require an unreasonable amount of work. They come from things that should be present in a marriage - like him expressing some sort of love or emotional connection with me during sex (rarely happens), him not expressing expectations for sex by describing a physical need (ex. - my ball are so full), and him giving not jusy taking sexually (he wants to do the minimal amount of work to just get by). I would respectfully disagree about the triggers. If I were doing things I knew that were selfish that made my husband relive abuse, I would stop. He shouldn't be able to just do what he wants because it is my issue that I need to get over.  I have gone through counseling - years of personal and couple's counseling - and I will put in more for the sake of my son and working on myself - even if my husband does not change. Also, just because someone makes a good parent and friend does not make them a good spouse. There is more to a marriage then going through the daily grind together and caring about one another. We have been a couple for over 11 years so I am not going to just throw away our marriage, but at the same time I am not going to make myself miserable staying if we cannot work through things. I have tried very hard to make things work and embrace the unexpected life I have now, but it feels very forced and after going through one shitty thing after another, I am utterly exhausted."

All of your issues are nearly 100% self-constructs and yet you come seeking answers on how to change your husband and how upset you are about your husband not becoming what you wanted through counseling. Practice mindfulness and loving compassion to get yourself in a better/healthier state instead of trying to guide or direct your husband and life in the direction you think it should be via couples counseling."

The fact of the matter is my husband would rather choose peace and his own ego than intimacy with me and will not put in half the work I have into himself or our marriage. It takes two for a marriage to begin crumbling and I am taking full responsibility for my half."

You ultimately will decide what you must do. I can tell you that I used to get accused of ""triggering"" all the time, thankfully, that does not happen anymore, because he works thru them."
sex,3dxyq4,incognitoguy,2,Tue Jul 21 02:12:52 2015 UTC,"It sounds like less of a technique issue and more of a desire issue.  You don't feel like your husband really wants you in a deep way.  He doesn't like to initiate, he doesn't freely express desire or love during sex, he scheduled sex like a chore.  For me, feeling loved and desired is the key to my satisfaction. I am happy in a wide variety of situations if strong desire from the other person is there.    So maybe the issue is that you are perceiving that your husband loves you in a friend way and not a lover way?  My point is, it may not be you.  You just may be picking up in a lack of desire from your husband.  Maybe he does desire you, if so, he needs to spend some time and energy letting you know that because it's not clear right now."
sex,3dxyq4,nmmwm,2,Tue Jul 21 11:02:32 2015 UTC,"YES! Thank you! This is exactly it. Technique is secondary to feeling desired in a deep way. When my husband doesn't express an emotional connection during sex AND he doesn't pursue me, I feel unvalued. He swears he finds me very sexy and desirable. I honestly think he gets into his head too much and overthinks things. The emotion he does show feels so forced and the sex seems so routine despite my best efforts to be positive and mix it up in ways he feels comfortable with. I have baggage from him and my past that makes it hard to feel sexual desire for him, and sometimes I wonder if he has the same thing - despite his claims."

In those circumstances, I tend to squash my impulses to say or do things that indicate desire and love. I second guess myself.  I would try having a conversation about where you are emotionally -confirming your love for each other or airing any concerns and then confirming your love for each other.  Then do like a week long challenge to act on ANY loving or desiring impulse- from saying it when you notice how cute the hub's butt is to touching each other as you walk by.  To saying I love you every time you think it.  It takes courage to put yourself out there and one of you may have to carry the ball at first.  Something to try."

We are not always good at airing concerns, but we talked and want to make it a regular part of our relationship. To an outsider, our relationship looks amazing but there is this huge disconnect. I know part of it is me (I'm working on that), I know part of it's is us together (we need to work together on that), and I know part of it is him (he needs to work on his stuff). I'm more than willing to carry most of the weight for a while and put myself out there, but it takes two to make a marriage and if he's not willing to put in the effort or we just can't make the important things work (like an emotional-sexual connection) no matter what, I need to consider that a different option may be best for all of us."

sex,3dxyq4,Quadraphonic-,5,Mon Jul 20 16:03:20 2015 UTC,"As real and serious as those concerns are, I also want you to consider what you are modeling for your son.  As much as you respect your husband, it really doesn't sound like you love him.  You realized that before your son was born.  Is your son going to become a man thinking that yours is what a marriage should look like?  There are no good options here.  There is no magic answer that is not going to be difficult.  You can stay in your companionate marriage having sex you don't want to have.  This isn't about his penis size, not really.  If other things were good you could work around that, no matter how cavernous your vaginal canal.    You can leave and take on all the struggle that accompanies that.  You might find that the freedom isn't actually as hard as you are imagining that it will be, or you might find that it is just as bad or worse.  I don't know.  Sometimes working harder while feeling free is better than having a ""better"" life feeling trapped.  You say you don't want to expose your son to men who might hurt him, but you cannot protect him from that.  He will throughout his life be exposed to adults who could hurt him, and he may even be hurt.  That's how life is.  It sucks, but we all have to reckon with it.  Sheltering him to the point of never allowing risk will rob him of any chance to find happiness, whatever his disability.  There is a middle ground here, but I don't know if you'll be able to do it.  That is to officially be in a companionate marriage and stop trying to make a sex life work that just isn't working.  That's hard to do.  You might also be able to get a divorce and be co-parents.  Just because you have a divorce does not mean that custody and parenting have to be this awful, endless battle.  You say he's a great parent - there's no reason to think he would stop being this just because he's no longer married to you.  You might consider that if you don't know if you'll be able to support both yourself and your child financially that you be flexible with the custody arrangement and allow him to shoulder more of the burden.  You can live nearby and still be a mother for your son."
sex,3dxyq4,Quadraphonic-,2,Mon Jul 20 15:51:32 2015 UTC,"By ""stop trying to make a sex life work that isn't working"", do you mean just stop having sex or deal with the mediocre sex? I'm not sure how it would work out financially if we divorced. I do know that a divorce means that I start working and that if I start working, there needs to be childcare (which we both don't want for our son). Maybe this something I can revisit when my son is school-aged and perhaps by then, things will get better or at least good enough. I do love him, but there is very little chemistry (at least on my end). It's always been like that. I thought I was just being vain, but there is definitely more than that. I also think the damage we've done to our relationship makes connecting on a sexual/emotional level even more difficult."
sex,3dxyq4,Quadraphonic-,4,Mon Jul 20 16:05:16 2015 UTC,"I mean stop trying to have sex that isn't working, yes.  It is possible to have a companionate marriage without any sex at all, especially with someone that you like and respect.  You can just be co-parents to your son.  Maybe you could both even see other people on the side.  You both seem to be on the same page about your son's needs, which is really good.  It's so important whatever you both decide that you put his needs first without neglecting your own.  It might also work to wait until your son is school-aged to facilitate the divorce.  Living in hope is better than living in despair, even if the hope is far off."
sex,3dxyq4,michaelwestinburned,2,Mon Jul 20 17:22:09 2015 UTC,"I'd be willing to see people on the side, but I know he wouldn't. He's way too conservative to do that. Sometimes, I think meh sex is better than no sex but anytime we do have sex, it's usually frustrating because I'm often initiating and there's no/little emotional connection (in addition to physical/personality issues). Last time I didn't initiate at all, we didn't have sex for 2 weeks - which REALLY sucked. He would rather not initiate than deal with rejection or insecurity (which makes me feel like I'm not valued). Definitely going to attempt couples/sex therapy, because I don't know how much longer I can deal with this. 9 years is too long. I'm not sure what will be the end result of all of this, but I want to hope/work towards something better than what I have now."

I could make a long list of things I wish we did that she will not allow.   We are also married with kids so I am committed.  I cope with the frustration with masturbation.  I try to manage my frustrations with her by lowering my expecations about sex with her.  I know this is nowhere near a perfect solution, just my way of coping."

It frustrates me incredibly because there are so many men who are like me. I feel like I'm an incredible catch and yet I end up with a guy that I feel never appreciated who I was and has the lower libido/ plain vanilla thing going on.

I'm glad I can stay home with my son due to his special needs, so I can't see how a divorce would work. It would mean our son is in daycare, I go back to a job I hate,and coordinating custody/care would be a nightmare. I don't want my son to go through the issues of having divorced parents like I did and I don't want to risk bringing a man in my life that might hurt my child. I feel like all I can do is work on myself and encourage communication to help improve things, but after 9 years of meh and bad, I don't have much hope. I feel like my best option is to make the best out of what I got and focus on the positives of the relationship - which could mean resigning myself to a cruddy sex life until my son passes/can support himself (if that ever happens) or until my husband passes or decides he doesn't want to be with me (knowing him, we won't leave)."
sex,3dxnu8,throwawayjockstrap,8,Mon Jul 20 11:35:21 2015 UTC,"In my experience the cock ring is good sometimes, but definitely not a go-to item every time. A cock ring makes you slightly bigger/harder and last potentially longer. I do not find my orgasms while wearing a cock ring to be particularly more intense. But I usually don't get to the end while wearing a cock ring because after a while it gets uncomfortable (cutting off circulation for so long). Unlike a vibrator, which does provide a lot more pleasure, I don't think you will become dependent on a cock ring the same way you might  become dependent on a vibrator."
sex,3dxnu8,Canadian_Couple,2,Mon Jul 20 11:43:58 2015 UTC,"Ah thanks for the advice, I didn't really know about the cutting off circulation thing. I had read about it, but have never used one to date."
sex,3dxnu8,OrgncChmstry,4,Mon Jul 20 12:55:34 2015 UTC,"Vibrating cock rings are great for girl on top IMO. Personally anything blasting my ladybits with a vibration of some sort feels amazing and I do get intense orgasms from them but I tend to need them in moderation because it affects my sensitivity. Since the clitoris is a big bundle of nerves, overstimulation can make it harder to get off after excessive use and makes getting off with say, oral, more challenging. I guess it would be like guys who grip tightly when they masturbate and find PIV difficult to climax. Toys are super fun and we use them in public too. We have remote controlled vibrating panties or little vibrators that I wear when we go out and my husband has the remote and that's usually a lot of fun and helps the build up for when we get home. So there's use for them outside the bedroom too!"
sex,3dxnu8,Canadian_Couple,2,Mon Jul 20 16:20:19 2015 UTC,As /u/Gamerboymtl statedm you can only really wear it for 15-20 minutes. They are great and fun sometimes though.
sex,3dxnu8,Gamerboymtl,5,Mon Jul 20 13:07:00 2015 UTC,"It depends greatly how ""frequent"" is frequent. My wife and I are using toys of all kinds pretty often - probably 1 out of 2 times - and we have only noticed an improvement in our bedroom activities.  Cock rings are awesome - if you can find the perfect size for you, which might require buying a few to try them out, but they can't be worn for more than 15-20 minutes. So it's a great way to finish (""Say honey, wouldn't you like it to be even bigger, and harder?""), but we don't use it everytime. Same thing with the wand; it's perfect for giving her those indulging, crazy orgasms, but it's not always our end goal, and when we pull this out, sex won't last for a very long time after ;)  tl;dr Don't hesitate to incorporate toys in your routine, as long as you enjoy having fun with your partner in all the ways, you won't ""require"" toys for it to become fun.  Enjoy! ^"
sex,3dxnu8,Smile4theWorld,3,Mon Jul 20 11:49:40 2015 UTC,"That's great, thank you for that :) I'll have a think about the cock ring thing.   I think you're right, I need to just carry on and enjoy sex. Because it happens so often, if she ever doesn't cum during sex, I feel like I've failed in some way for some reason. I know people say all the time that an orgasm shouldn't be just a goal, but I can't help but always have to aim for it. I guess I'm just paranoid that if we use toys lots then it will make it harder to make her cum when we don't...but I think I need to get out of that stupid notion!  I need to get back to just having as much fun as I can.  Thank you again."

I have found that something I wouldn't use daily would be a cock ring. They really are awesome but it is true. When I don't use it I often WANT to use it. I think it may be mental. My erections were slightly effected. They weren't as hard. But that's what a cock ring does.   I don't have experience with feminine toys.  I fap way too much."

At that point, if she decides that she is ready for continued intimacy with you-that is her choice. If you feel guilt about it, because she feels guilt, remove yourself from situations, such as staying over etc. I would suggest since it sounds like she isn't certain on her stance I would avoid any situation where the heat of the moment might take over and the next morning regret might set in. Take your time. Don't force anything. Enjoy relationships!"
sex,3dzp8a,siebergiel,4,Mon Jul 20 20:58:50 2015 UTC,"First, I don't think you should view the different scenarios in which you can reach orgasm as 'performance' related. If you're enjoying yourself and it feels good and your partner is enjoying himself, you're 'performing' just fine. Plenty of people can climax from some stimuli but not others. It's just part of life. And you already mentioned the best part. You have a 'supportive and patient' partner. That should equal less pressure, not more. Easier said than done, but don't look at it as a destination (orgasm), but view it as a pleasant country drive where the destination is less important than the drive itself. Have fun!"

The aim of this is to do what feels good, not to try and squeeze out an  orgasm.  Are you able to cum when he is near you, or only when alone? Try masturbating with him."
sex,3dzp8a,forgottenpasswords78,3,Mon Jul 20 22:59:41 2015 UTC,"You need to relax and be more in the moment. Unfortunately, that's a lot easier said than done.  Don't be so goal oriented. For a while, just try to have a fun and pleasurable time, without caring whether you orgasm. Your partner should try to satisfy you, but try to have a good time whether or not you come.  Give him real time feedback on what feels good and what doesn't.  Do you use a vibrator during sex with him? If not, try it.  Practice relaxation techniques. Breathing exercises are popular. Attend to your breathing, count each exhalation to ten, then restart. When your mind wanders, bring it back and start counting again.  https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/wiki/index#wiki_orgasm_troubles can be helpful."

I can't forgive myself for my actions. I was stupid, insecure and bitter about it. To be honest with you, if I had the mindset I had now, I'd treat her like gold, just like i did in the first 6 months .  She was insecure about her weight etc and I'd make a point every single night to tell her how beautiful she is. I changed though, I wouldn't directly put her down but I'd say things i really didn't mean. Verbally abusive, things that have probably scarred her. I cry every day, not for my self-pity, but I cry for her.. What I put her through at the end I'd do anything to take away. I'd give all my limbs and I'm not even exaggerating. I care for her more than my own mother, how wrong is that now at this stage? She was so in love with me and i destroyed it by being a huge asshole. My jealousy, post traumatic ness and emotional unstableness over it, as well as a family member dying caused us both misery in an otherwise what would've been a partner for life.  Don't worry, I'm fully aware now. I want her happiness more than anything and I hope she finds someone who loves her as much as i do. I really mean that."

You say you damaged her. It very well could be long term.  Do not ask her or put any pressure on her for reconciliation. If it's truly about reversing the damage, apologize sincerely and move on with your life. An apology goes a long way and might make closure for you as well."

I can't get her out of my life, she's a regular at the same gym, considers my little brother her little brother and is like vest friends with his girlfriend. She hangs with all the people I grew up with. The breakup wasn't exactly plain sailing. It was a HUGE public thing that meant a social split as I got outcast.  I can ween myself back into the circle. But damn it's gonna be hard when being so much in love. We will have opportunities to talk but I would never know what to say or how to say it. I mean I could tell her how sorry I am, that I still love her and always will but that'd only make things awkward. Or i can sit there friendzoned watching her enjoy herself breaking me every day waiting for that chance. Or i can act indifferent, really move on hoping she'd come to me.  Or, I could do what I feel is right.  ""I don't feel like I deserve to have you still treat me so pleasantly, I can't tell you how awful I feel about how i became, my heart still belongs to you and I fear it always will do, because of that I have to be strong and make my distance and honestly wish you the most sincerest prayer for happiness.""

Either way, he should not be pressuring you to do something you're not comfortable with. You have the right to say no. He might ask for your reasons, but shouldn't whine or pressure you to do something you don't want to do  You should talk to your boyfriend and explain your feelings. If he's a good person he will be supportive and won't feel you've ruined anything for him. If he resents you or gets upset with you, then that's another story."

sex,3dy615,noviakaunt,3,Mon Jul 20 23:48:08 2015 UTC,"How you described how you felt in an above comment was how I felt with my sexual abuse. I was in a similar situation with my SO where I couldn't have his hands on my head or have him be rough with me during oral.   Your situation is definitely a lot more serious however, and I would definitely talk to him about this ASAP before you start to resent him for this. Communication in this situation is going to be extremely vital and he needs to know how you feel!  Let him know that this is all not either of your faults, but that things have changed for you and explain the dream and your new feelings regarding anal sex. Express your desire to stop anal sex for awhile or at least have him take it slower and touch you more, give you more physical attention, etc. You've got to let him know that you feel this way.   I know you may feel guilty about it, but your emotional state is extremely important and you may end up hating anal sex if you're not careful with this. If he's a good guy, he'll completely understand and do whatever he can to make you feel comfortable again.   Avoid directly accusing him of making you feel bad, but have him understand that him shaming you for the fecal matter (which is completely natural and he shouldn't be taking part in anal if he wasn't okay with it) isn't okay.   I really feel for you. I'm so very sorry that this has happened to you. You'll be in my thoughts and I hope things get better."
sex,3dy615,Tonystark1226,2,Mon Jul 20 16:05:31 2015 UTC,"I think part of why I'm so frustrated is that positions that are reminiscent of those I was in during the assault, or the exact same positions aren't an issue for me. It logically just seems strange to me that this should be a problem for me.  I'm sorry you went through something similar, and I don't think your situation is less serious at all.   I know that I will need to discuss it, you're definitely right. Relating issues to my assault always feels like such a cop-out to me though. Like I'm using it as an excuse, even though I know its valid and relevant.  We've discussed the shaming thing and he's apologised for over-reacting. I can't help worrying that it may happen again though, and he'll go back to being stand-offish and disgusted. I feel like I can't 100% prevent something like that from happening.  Thankyou for your help and your thoughts, I really appreciate a response from someone who has some experience with these feelings."

Perhaps when you were ready then you both could try a different anal position to keep the intimacy.  It might not work for you, but taking some control over the play could help."
sex,3dy615,rhinosoaring,2,Mon Jul 20 19:14:13 2015 UTC,"This is a good suggestions, and something we should probably try more. I do get self-conscious doing this but I think those feelings are probably better than the alternative. I have found that I do better if I am given warning ahead of time that he's interested in anal, and I can privately go away and get myself ready without his help, in a calm and quiet environment without him knowing. I know this isn't the best option long term, but maybe I should stick with this a bit longer and see if I get more comfortable."

Sometimes it happens the first couple of times. Building up stress about it in your head can make it worse, so try to just accept that it's a thing that happens and that will go away, and focus on enjoying the sexual contact without worrying about an erection. You'll be fine."

sex,3e0a4b,jormono,2,Tue Jul 21 00:44:08 2015 UTC,"Couldn't agree with more with /u/laidymondegreen. I've been with guys where this has happened and I just try to reassure them that we can still have fun and that it's okay. Also, if you're dating someone and you don't have ED, it usually just goes away when you feel more comfortable with the person. If something isn't physically wrong, then it's just psychological-- the stress and worrying, etc about not getting hard right away, being good enough, being nervous, etc etc."
sex,3e0a4b,chocolateecupcake,2,Mon Jul 20 23:51:24 2015 UTC,"Totally normal. Focus on her.  Edit: And if possible, leave enough time for a second go if you regain interest. This happens to me occasionally. We mess around, she has fun, I can't quite finish.  15-30 minutes later, I'm throwing her on the bed and away we go to happyland."

This is with my current SO and we attempt to have sex at least 3-4 times a week for the last 8 weeks or so, and I have not achieved a boner hard enough for penetration even once.  I took Viagra for the first time the other day and still couldn't get it done >_<  I'm now interested in trying cock ring.

Same thing happens with Pre-mature ejaculation. It took me several times before I was able to overcome it. Everything is just in your mind and you have to relax and realize that it's alright if you don't get hard or if you cum too fast."

sex,3e09ey,randomaccountforme1,2,Mon Jul 20 23:32:16 2015 UTC,"If her hymen were imperforate she would have issues- there would be nowhere for the products of menstruation to come out- so she has to have some sort of hole, even if you can't see it.  2 things: 1) she should see an OB/GYN, if she has not already. Both to obtain contraception and to have this issue looked at. If there is an issue where her hymen is unable to open naturally, surgery can be performed.  2) Give it time. You should be practicing a lot of oral and digital sex before PIV. Feeling her vagina with your fingers can give you an idea of what she likes. Also, since you have not had sex before, getting your penis in is easier if you can have your fingers inside her and guide your penis along them. Plus she can naturally ""lose"" her hymen by digital contact- the tissue can retract.   Really though, I am confused. If there is no hole, what did you get your finger into? And a hymen doesn't look white. Get down there and look at what you are doing when you are fingering her.  Many women do not have pain their first time- I didn't have any issues at all, nor has any woman I discussed had such an issue.  Is what you are feeling when you attempted to finger her hard or firm? Can she attempt to finger herself regularly to see if that helps?  Bottom line, she needs to see a doctor, mostly likely."
sex,3e09ey,catzen789,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:38:51 2015 UTC,"First, have her visit a doctor. A doctor can indicate whether everything is normal physically.   Second, no, you absolutely should not use force to ""break"" anything. It may be that she has a very thick, tight hymen (it's just a ring of tissue, not a solid barrier, which it seems you already know) and that slow stretching over weeks or months will be necessary. It's also possible that she has vaginismus, which is the same basic problem but due to tight muscles and not a tight hymen."
sex,3e09ey,laidymondegreen,0,Mon Jul 20 23:35:31 2015 UTC,"It took my ex three PIV failed tries before it went in on the fourth. Not all at once, it was over the duration of one day and night with breaks in between. The first time hurt so bad my eyes teared up, didn't go in at all. Called my friends in tears swearing I had a broken vagina and that it needed surgery and shit, if you read up on that stuff online you'll find all sort of things. I wasn't able to put a finger in while masturbating prior to losing my virginity either. So I just knew it was broken. Next few tries also hurt but less. Tried it on the floor, tried it sitting, nope. The fourth time lying down in bed I was like ""suck it up and just do it"", breathed through the pain and it finally worked and it was such a relief. The weird thing is once it did work, there was no more pain, just a faint soreness. He did use force (and lots of lube!!!) but I requested him to. I was tired of it not going in.  But slide in with only a small amount of resistance, lololol I wish."

I thought maybe someone would have gone through the same and have some advice about getting him thinking about it, until eventually he's fantasizing about it. What I want to do is sneakily plant an anal sex seed in his mind, then water that seed until it's a tree, then let that tree penetrate my ass."

Very long story short, over the course of years, her opinion changed about 180 degrees.... She now loves it! I did the usual things - pressed against her anus while eating her out, eventually inserting a finger, licking around the base of her vagina and occasionally her asshole, etc - until one day it just happened. I never planned it out and my actions didn't have a specific purpose in mind... Our adventures just evolved, I guess you could say.   And as others would tell you, I think, she didn't love it at first - took a few episodes before she orgasmed from it.   So no idea how it will play out with your SO, but I don't necessarily think it's a done deal that he will never fuck your ass (though I think you have to proceed with that as an assumption). In the meantime, fantasize and masturbate like there's no tomorrow :)"

The first time wasn't all that great and we didn't try it again for several years. After my middle or youngest was born (idr which) she wanted to try again. Now it's her favorite thing to do and she cums HARD from it, every time. So don't fret, you'll likely get to experience it with him, just may not be as soon as you want it.  And I HIGHLY recommend coconut oil for a lube, stays solid at room temp but melts at body temp, gives just enough friction while being slippery enough to get it in."

Also if like he's worried about ""stuff getting on it.""  1) it's rarely there unless you have to go or haven't in a while. 2) use an anal condom, yes they are specifically made for anal sex, stronger and thicker than ""normal"" condom's 3) have him do an enema on you, it sounds weird, but it can be fun and part of foreplay 4) go to literotica or a similar site and find a really hot anal sex story and have him read it.  5) just sit down and talk to him, tell him that you really want to try and why.

sex,3dvopi,Camedo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:36:30 2015 UTC,"If you're a naturally manipulative person, it stands to reason that you wouldn't see anything wrong with being manipulative.  However, if you want to get him interested in anal sex without being manipulative, you need to just state simply that it's something you love, and that you'd really appreciate it if he could work out a compromise of some sort that would give you some satisfaction.  I had a frank conversation on reddit a couple of months ago with a girl that saw nothing wrong with lying to her boyfriend in order to get her way. Nothing I said convinced her that lying was wrong. Similarly, if you believe that manipulation is okay, there's likely nothing I can say to convince you otherwise, other than asking you the question: Would you mind it if the people you know referred to you as ""John's (or whatever his name's) manipulative girlfriend""? If you don't like the sound of that, then don't be manipulative."

In her explanation, it sounds like the boyfriend is so afraid of being like every other guy, that he dismisses her wants as trying to please HIM.

Best case scenario, he actually wanted it and enjoys it (however, it seems like this is absolutely not the case). Worst case scenario, she has just raped him by forcing him to have a type of sex that he did not consent to.

Still doesn't sit well with me. What ""motions"" are you talking about? Why can't she prove that she really wants to try anal sex by talking about it instead of trying to be sneaky and positioning herself during sex to have him put it in her butt? I would be very upset with my partner if I said no to something sexually but during sex my partner kept trying to take things in that direction. It would not make me change mind but I would be resentful and feel disrespected."
sex,3dvopi,hippydipster,5,Mon Jul 20 04:31:40 2015 UTC,Second the butt plug. He doesn't even necessarily help you put it in/take it out. Just ride him with one in. Holy crap it's a world of difference.

Have you tried plainly telling him that you want anal? When he says, ""Do you really want to do that? That's not what it was made for."" You need to look him directly in the eyes and explain that it's really something that you want to do.  Don't pester him to do it, but make it extremely clear that it is something you really want."

So then you continued with your assumptions and ignored what he said. You didn't ask further questions and kept to your assumptions. Sorry to be blunt but it's kinda your fault and something you will have to deal with that you continued the relationship based off assumptions and didn't say anything. You can't continuously make assumptions about someone even after they have said otherwise and then be confused later as to why they don't think like your assumptions you have made based off of other people."

And you can buy a dildo and shove it up your own ass. Work up to using a butt plug with him while you have sex. It won't be quite what you want, but at least he doesn't have to put part of himself somewhere he doesn't want to.  If he refuses to let you use a butt plug with him, then it shifts to him being a bit of an asshole. (So to speak.)"

If he's completely against doing anything with anal then you use them on yourself when he's inside of you.  If he's more open, he can be the one to work them on you.  He could even get a thrusting sensation going for you using a toy (flared base only, remember!).     I'd start small with a butt plug and minimal involvement from him and go from there.  I would not hold out hope that he comes around on this.  I mean, who knows, anything's a possibility, but don't set that as a goal in your mind or you're likely to be disappointed.  Plus, you wouldn't want him to feel pressured on this."

Lucky me!:) but seriously just talk about it and tell him you really want to do it and make sure you say its pleasure full!

sex,3dvopi,que_pedo_wey,7,Mon Jul 20 00:47:47 2015 UTC,"I'm a guy, the idea of anal anything for me is also ... horrifying? Repulsive? Nauseating? It's a very strong psychological response. In my case, I've had mild digestive issues off and on throughout my life, so the butthole is irreversibly associated with monstrously disgusting stuff. I don't want to have anything to do with it; I don't want mine messed with, I don't want to mess with anyone else's. Lots of other stuff is fine, I don't mind going down on a girl, even had period sex a few times, whatever it's just a little blood, but anal? Nope, nuh uh, never, not ever.  So ... what can you do? Well, how important is it to you? If that experience is something you need more than your relationship, then tell your boyfriend how important it is, and then he'll have to decide if the relationship is worth whatever very strong psychological issues he has around it. But keep in mind that you're putting him in a position where his answer might not be the one you're hoping for. Turn it around and imagine that you have some kind of PTSD around, say, rape, and your boyfriend insists on acting out a rape fantasy with you.  Or, alternatively, accept that anal just might not be something you get to do with him. I mean, I'd love to be relaxing on some island with clean sand, warm water, perfect weather, and suddenly have a small flock of perfect women descend on me and proceed to screw my brains out for the next several hours until I want to swear off sex for the next six months at least. But that'll never happen!  It sounds like you've got a pretty good thing going, except for this one part that isn't as good, so you want just a little more. Nothing wrong with that, but figure out if you're OK with trading."

sex,3dvopi,fuzzypussycat,6,Mon Jul 20 03:14:12 2015 UTC,"My standard advice in situations like this, although usually with the genders reversed, is to give the other person a copy of Tristan Taormino's Ultimate Guide to Anal Sex for Women. It sounds like your guy really doesn't think you're serious and can't understand why you would want it.  If the first few pages of this book can't convince him that there's something really in this for both of you...well, nothing will.  Here's an excerpt from the intro:   Yes, I admit it—I love anal sex. The first time someone put a finger in my butt, I almost went crazy from the pleasure. The sensations I experienced were so intense, incredible, and heavenly that it was mind-blowing. I felt high from the experience, and I couldn't wait to do it again. The first time I put my finger in someone else's butt, the results were just as fabulous—I felt entrusted with my partner's deepest vulnerabilities, in awe of the ecstatic pleasure I could give. Then came more fingers, tongues, vibrators, small dildos, bigger dildos, butt plugs, a penis, bigger butt plugs, even an entire small hand.  Each time I could take a little more and give a little more, I felt more sexually alive and powerful. As I incorporated anal eroticism into my sex life, my sex life became better and better.  The sex got hotter, my partners extra adventurous, my orgasms fierce and explosive. The physical sensations were undeniably some of the best I'd ever felt in my life.   The second standard bit of advice is the one you've already heard: if you still get a clear and definite no from him, let it go.  Sometimes people's attitudes change, but don't count on it.  And, as you already know, pressuring your guy to do something that grosses him out is not a good idea.  Third idea: sometimes a person who won't touch the anus will be okay with manipulating the external part of a butt plug during sex.  It's not what you want, but it's something and it might lead to more eventually.  Good luck, and congrats on your upcoming marriage!"

sex,3dvopi,Mrs_Way,8,Mon Jul 20 04:44:15 2015 UTC,"he doesn't have any interest in anal. He told me so a long time ago   You're a girl who likes anal sex, and you knowingly entered into a serious relationship with a guy that clearly stated that he has no interest in anal. Now you're complaining that you're stuck in a relationship with a guy who has no interest in anal. He even warned you that he wasn't in to it years ago (presumably before you developed too much commitment).  You brought this situation on to yourself, to be honest. Hopefully, he'll make an exception on special occasions, or you can find some kind of compromise (strap-on, dildo, whatever). But he's done nothing wrong at all.  You can always use a butt-plug while he has sex with you. That's entirely your own body, and outside of his juristiction (it's up to you what you do with your own body, obviously)."
sex,3dvopi,deadpool102197,2,Mon Jul 20 07:41:32 2015 UTC,"I'm baffled. Personally I LOVE doing anal. First time I hit her anus one night with the tip of my dick while trying to do doggy, and she said ""that's the wrong hole, and tonite is not a good nite for THAT, but we could do it there tomorrow if you want?"" and I was amazed. And we did do it anally the next night and it was great.  I can't imagine what his objection is, except maybe getting poo on his dick? If he used vaseline for lube, and you either cleaned yourself or you did it after doing your daily poo, it's actually pretty clean then. Maybe you should get yourself ready, pre lube with some vaseline, do a girl on top, and slip it in... see how he reacts or if he would realize where he's at?"

You want sex twice per day (or at least daily, more than her 1-2 times per week) You have very different libidos and views on sexuality She rejects you quite often She doesn't like that you masturbate and watch porn   It seems to me like she might be right, she obviously isn't enough for you sexually (and not just referring to the porn situation). This is just an observation I made from what you have said... Maybe something you need to think about."
sex,3dxogw,Canadian_Couple,12,Mon Jul 20 11:52:10 2015 UTC,"This sounds pretty spot on.  Frankly it's a little selfish of her to only want sex one or twice a week, and not approve of you masturbating to fill in the gap between your sex drive and hers.  You can't relate to her low sex drive and she can't relate to your high one.  You seriously need to talk this out. Being sexually compatible is sooo important and right now you two aren't even in the same library let alone on the same page."
sex,3dxogw,LizbetRoyal,5,Mon Jul 20 12:04:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, true and I have thought about it. The rest of the relationship is great. She is a very loving person and definitely gives that area plenty of attention. Sexually we are most certain not on the same page and it isn't going to get any better. I don't mind not having sex everyday or even just a couple times a week. I just don't like our one time together to be a 5 minute session. I have talked about this before which is why I just wanted to see what others have felt being in her situation. I mean if it were me I would love to just get her off even if I couldn't get hard. Use a dildo or what ever but I just love sex. If I didn't orgasm I wouldn't be unhappy and for the most part same with her, but she doesn't isn't interested in having sex as a past time like me...."

I think sex for her is much different. She doesn't have sex with me out of any need. If she wants to fuck then she will make it known. I don't think she understands that I want what she wants on a daily bases, not a weekly bases. Many times she has said that,"" You don't really want to have sex with me, you just want to orgasm."" Which to a degree is true when I am super horny, but I am also super horny because I have a super hot wife sitting right next to me that I love to fuck."

There are other ways to prolong your orgasm without stopping all activity.   What do you mean she doesn't have sex with you out of any need? You said she gets horny and that she wants to have sex, that's a need.   Ask have you told her that you are always horny and wanting sex because of her?

sex,3dxogw,kurtbdudley,7,Mon Jul 20 18:26:11 2015 UTC,"In a relationship where sex drives are mismatched, masturbation is often the savior. It's how you stay sane, and responsible.   Mismatched libidos are very, so very often a relationship killer (and that's normal - desire is a very powerful emotion, and not having our needs met, well, can lead to disaster or opting out of the couple). She needs to understand that masturbation doesn't involve her, you will still want her as much whether you do it or not. Your drive is probably high enough that it won't make you want it less - but it might help you through tough hard ons ;)  Explain to her this is for you, and she won't feel any diminishing of your desire, except you might feel less rejected and unsatisfied. If she can't live in a world where you masturbate and are sexually satisfied, then there are potentially issues in your couple that would require working on for it to continue on.  I used to masturbate in secret - now that I've explained (over the course of multiple times) why I do it, and the need I feel, she encourages me to do it. She'll even say ""Have fun!"" - she loves me and want me to be happy after all.  Good luck!"

If she wants it she gets it, but thats because I want it too haha. I think my ideal situation isn't to have sex everyday or even every other day. I would be content in masturbating but happy if she would want to lend a hand for 5 minutes. I don't feel that sexual attraction from her like earlier in our relationship.

I think she feels that becasue I am so horny all the time that there is no way it can be passionate. I feel you can still have sex a lot and not everytime needs to be super passionate.

All of this kind of reeks of selfishness.   Obviously, I don't have all the details, but it sounds like you have communicated your needs and she just doesn't want to hear it. She's getting her needs met, so in her mind there is no problem. She minimizes the importance of your feelings by making it about you orgasming because then she can justify her lack of participation.   I would question why it is that she can't be more available. You're not asking for much. Tell her you'll do the dishes if it means a hand job from time to time haha.  I don't know what advice to offer, but good luck friend!"

You know you're not required to do this, right? Not all people are into BDSM, and not all women are into being dominated or being made to have rough sex. If this is not something you think you would enjoy, then tell your boyfriend that. He shouldn't expect this from you.   I'm kinda worried no one will be able to offer advice because I'm such an outlier (or I think I am judging by my girlfriends, 50 Shades of Grey etc.).    See, I had the same problem. I thought I was weird or wrong for not wanting to be dominated during sex, because of the porn and 50 Shades of Grey and r/sex threads everywhere. But it's not uncommon to be vanilla. There's nothing wrong with not wanting to be on the receiving (or giving) end of BDSM."

There is nothing wrong with wanting to watch someone else be submissive, and not personally dominate them.  I don't think there is anything weird, unusual, abnormal etc about your fantasies. Most people don't even seem self aware enough to acknowledge they have them let alone try to identify them in detail.  Communicate with the boyfriend, let him guide you.

Watching other people dominate and submit sounds perfectly safe and healthy!  You'll learn that some things are better in fantasies, and some things are more enjoyable in person than how you imagine them.

One thing that might float your boat is to put hand cuffs on him or tie his hands together and have him watch you masturbate. You can tease the hell out of him and you can be the dominant one without even really being dominant. All you're doing is masturbating and getting yourself off while watching him go crazy for you. If hand cuffs aren't easily accessible, use scarfs. They work very well from my experience. Have fun exploring!"

I can do it on the bed but it's much easier on the floor because it is more steady. If she's not strong enough to stay on her arms she doesn't have to hold herself up. She can literally lay down on her face and her stomach with her ass up and arched. It should be easy!

You: In between her legs, holding her hips.  I personally like arching my back so I sink my chest into the bed and have my head turned to the side. You don't really need balance or flexibility for this position. If she is really having that hard of a time staying up, I'd go to a doctor because that's not really normal."
sex,3dyc2a,thecookiesayshi,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:55:51 2015 UTC,"Have her put her head and shoulders down towards the bed or the floor, have her lean her head to the side. Make the point where her neck and shoulder meet on the exposed side press against the wall (or corner?), and fuck her through the wall. Go for it."

sex,3dyyqu,Quadraphonic-,0,Tue Jul 21 00:04:37 2015 UTC,"""She doesn't like it too rough, more so gentle -- although I'm slowly building up the roughess a bit as I like it""  You should NOT build up on something someone doesn't like. You whole post screams 'how do I manipulate my gf into my kink'. You want to use a butt plug on her while she is injured in that area?"

sex,3e0b4v,JellySausage,2,Tue Jul 21 04:34:20 2015 UTC,"I take it and also cialis.  I don't have any ED issues, I just like it.   My viagra pills are 100mg and I take it about 30 minutes before sex.    As the other poster said, it makes me rock hard for hours.  Even the next day I'll spontaneously chubb up when I otherwise wouldn't."
sex,3e0b4v,happydogbark,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:25:46 2015 UTC,"Most people here are just here to brag about how exotic their sex life is.  I've only used Viagra and cialis as enhancers. I found Cialis even at 5mg (the stuff they market as once per day) significantly more effective than half a 100mg Viagra.  I didn't get unwanted or unrelenting erections. But the usual tumescence you get throughout the day is enhanced and it makes you feel more confident because of that.  Proper erections are harder and last longer, and it'll stay semi for longer when you're drifting off.  Don't give up if Viagra at 50 hadn't helped. Try 100, or try just a run of a few days using 50. Also cialis might work better for you.  There's probably some psychological stuff there as well, but if you take any improvement in erection quality as a win, that should gradually improve too."
sex,3e0b4v,MadameBonjour,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:50:16 2015 UTC,"Take an hour before you'd like to be hard, you can probably get away with 30 minutes but an hour is more certain - doesn't matter if you take it on an empty or full stomach.  50mg is the standard starting dose, most people don't require over 100mg. It works the first time, your body doesn't need to get used to it.  I've no idea if it's as good as ads claim, but due to the nature of ads I'd assume not... it did everything I wanted it to though.  You still need to be aroused to be able to get an erection, it just makes the threshold for such slightly lower and can help counteract blood flow issues."
sex,3e0b4v,DLL72,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:12:17 2015 UTC,"Be careful of what you eat beforehand because certain meals can effect it. If you eat a heavy meal, it might cause some problems like delaying the effects of the medication.   I notice that I last longer with it than I ever had without it. I'm also able to change positions easier without fear of losing my erection. It also helped me have anal sex with my gf.   The other issue is, you still need to be in the mood and it also helps to be relaxed and into having sex to begin with. Sounds like a silly point to make but if you're not in the mood I find it doesn't work very well.  I've also noticed that it sometimes stays in your system for a while, so I've been able to have great sex the next day."
sex,3e0b4v,R-Zfin,0,Tue Jul 21 12:26:37 2015 UTC,"Not that I would use viagra, but from what I've heard. Effects start somewhere 15-45 minutes from taking a pill and effect lasts for few hours. Stone hard erection which will not go down even after sex. And you should probably start with a small dose, that stuff is really effective."
sex,3e0b4v,R-Zfin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:12:45 2015 UTC,"I took it for the first time this past weekend, results were not like you said.  I got harder than I usually do, but the erection still went away too fast and could not achieve penetration.  I was prescribed 50mg was thinking of doubling it 100mg but I want to try one 50mg dose again incase it's one of those ""doesn't work the first time"" drugs"
sex,3e0b4v,SPRTN0506,2,Tue Jul 21 00:29:40 2015 UTC,I guess you are a bit less sensitive for it. You could try 100mg.

sex,3e1fdo,IWEJOHF,4,Tue Jul 21 05:34:59 2015 UTC,"It wouldn't surprise me if she isn't climaxing, although I think she thinks she probably is. My own orgasms were quite weak until I started having sex. I know that the feeling I had worked up to something that felt very good, and assumed that that was having an orgasm.   I know what really helped me to get across the hill into a full body shaking orgasm was getting a vibrator and to just keep at it. Maybe that could be something you could try with her as some foreplay? When she says she thinks she's done keep holding it on her clit. Even if she doesn't orgasm the first time you try it, encourage her to try herself and eventually she'll find something that works for her."
sex,3dzxth,whatswrongwithme363,5,Mon Jul 20 22:00:33 2015 UTC,Have you ever seen or touched a vagina in real life? They are far from cold and smelly.

sex,3dzxth,Canadian_Couple,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:04:50 2015 UTC,Well I don't know what to tell you mate. You've seen and touched on in real life. And you don't like it. Perhaps talk to a therapist? Perhaps that particular one wasn't very appealing to look at. Some vaginas have very small labia. see /r/simps  for example. Maybe you won't find that so repulsive?
sex,3dzxth,dangerboy24,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:07:15 2015 UTC,"Maybe since I've only touched 1 in real life I need more...exploration. Though every single pussy I've seen in porn or even on subs like real girls has been disgusting to me. I just have no motivation to pursue pussy, just womens' backdoors. Those drive me crazy, but anal isn't considered normal sex with women...Maybe I just have to accept myself, I don't know. I've been ignoring this for like 8 years, but now I have to face this. Thanks for the suggestion."
sex,3dzxth,insurrecto,3,Mon Jul 20 22:12:52 2015 UTC,Porn is disgusting.  Real life pussies are beautiful.
sex,3dzxth,RR_4150,0,Mon Jul 20 22:28:41 2015 UTC,Have you ever put your dick inside a tight pussy?  It feels amazing. Who gives a shit what pussies look like? They feel great.
sex,3dzxth,insurrecto,2,Mon Jul 20 23:40:25 2015 UTC,"There're a lot of women who are unable to have intercourse because sex is painful for them for one reason or another. I would think a woman like that would be a perfect match for you, especially if she's open to experimenting with anal."
sex,3dzxth,aek87,2,Tue Jul 21 01:44:57 2015 UTC,"Ok, here's my advice:   Kiss a hot woman and touch her boobs. Don't look at her pussy. Play with her hair, neck, boobs, stomach, etc, until your dick is hard Have her go on top Let her slide your hard dick into her tight pussy As your dick slides inside her, feel how warm, tight, and wet she is. It will feel amazing. While she is on top, kiss her lips and neck. Play with her boobs and suck on her nipples. Run your fingers up and down her back. Grab her butt and squeeze it. Have her ride you nice and slow until you come deep inside her tight pussy   It will feel so good that you won't give a shit what her pussy looks or smells like."
sex,3dzxth,MadameBonjour,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:39:45 2015 UTC,"You have to realize that not all vaginas look the same. Some women have bigger pussy lips while others have little ones. The ones you've seen in porn aren't really what you're going to find in real life. I think the labia area is what's throwing you off. If that isn't it, I think you should follow insurrecto's advice. Try not to focus on what it looks like. Get caught up in the moment with a woman. Take your brain out of the equation."

sex,3dxfzl,rhinosoaring,7,Mon Jul 20 10:10:16 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of people have two sets of fantasies.  Ones we want to act on, and ones that will stay fantasy. Our thoughts on things such as this don't hurt other people, as long as we don't act on them it's OK. Just as an example, look how popular incest erotica is but how many of those people would ever what to actually live those fantasies?  I am curious what yours is though, as you said it is non violent but you would only act upon it with a dedicated partner....so very curious lol.  Why can't you continue to keep it as a fantasy? Let it play out in your mind and run its course?"
sex,3dxfzl,LizbetRoyal,0,Mon Jul 20 11:13:28 2015 UTC,"Why can't you continue to keep it as a fantasy?   Because after few days of nofap and no sex it's the nr 1 sexual thing that comes up in my mind, and I'm really not comfortable with it. Even though it turns me on, I consider it to be messed up and perverted. (Even the number of porn vids shows it's not popular at all :D)   I would try it out, if GF wanted to, but since that's highly unlikely, I dont want it to play such an important role in my thoughts. Especially that I know I don't need it, and can be happy and fulfilled with classic vanilla sexlife"

I don't see a problem if it isn't impacting your ability to function. But if you are absolutely feeling guilty and disgusted with yourself I would suggest seeing a therapist. They might be able to help you rationalize and understand or at least deal with the feelings.   Without sharing you fantasies I don't know how anyone could help."
sex,3dxfzl,ohsnapt,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:45:18 2015 UTC,"to let go of the fantasies, you do as follows, if they come up in your mind, register them carefully. are these images, if yes, withness what kind of images they are, do they move, are they in color, are they very clear and vivid or more unclear, do they change, etc, take great care not to control the images with your volition, find a space in your mind were you can witness them without acting apon them. Then register if you hear inner talk alongside. witness these talks, ""hear"" what they say, witness if they are coherent or repetitive or whatever. Let it go on, register, notice without engaging in your ""mind's space"". then register what kind of emotions or affects come alongside the images and inner talk. register how they feel without judgement. witness, notice how the emotions change alongside the change of the images, and inner talking. keep noticing it without engaging it and most importantly without judging your emotions or what you see, do not give them value, they are neither good nor bad. do that as long as they surface in your mind, if they go away, let them go, notice again when they come up. after a while they will change or even go totally away."
sex,3e1tag,Tablolisa,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:27:50 2015 UTC,"Pornhub appears to be going for a more ""publicly acceptable"" image. With its various marketing campaigns and the like. In doing so it's advantageous for pornhub to appeal to the widest possible audience, while remaining out of ""taboo"" areas. It also means pornhub stays within the ""legal"" area for porn and allows it to reach a wider audience that way."

sex,3e1tag,Littlebigman57,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:31:36 2015 UTC,Well... Good? A lot of the 'taboo' things are illegal to actually do. So it's good they aren't actually filming and selling crimes for people to masturbate to. Especially when it comes to rape porn; a fantasy is a fantasy but if you support people actually being raped for your entertainment it kind of makes you a douche

Your kids see their mom, you get ""satisfied"" but if you are both sure you aren't going to end up together then you are wasting time you could be using to find a fulfilling and true lasting relationship."
