bicycling,3e29la,whiskey06,14,Tue Jul 21 16:59:54 2015 UTC,"Most roads are designed almost exclusively based on the needs and abilities of the automobile. So are most traffic laws. Holding people riding bikes to the same laws is an afterthought without consideration of the different needs and abilities of an entirely different type of vehicle.  This is my response when someone complains about ""scofflaw bicyclists."" What do you expect when people biking do not have a safe place to ride and a space place to wait at intersections?"
bicycling,3e29la,sensible_human,9,Tue Jul 21 15:08:20 2015 UTC,"What do you expect when people biking do not have a safe place to ride and a space place to wait at intersections?   Well, in all honesty: good cycling infrastructure doesn't make cyclists more law-abiding. At least my observations in the Netherlands would tell me so. However, it makes everybody more safe - and that's what matters."
bicycling,3e29la,simoncolumbus,6,Tue Jul 21 16:00:47 2015 UTC,"Several studies have shown that improved bicycle infrastructure encourages better adherence to traffic laws by those using the infrastructure. That of course does not apply to laws that make no sense to bicycles regardless of quality of infrastructure.  This doesn't apply only to bicycles - it applies to all forms of transportation. If you design a street that makes drivers feel comfortable driving at 60mph, but with a speed limit of 30mph, they're probably not going to follow it. Likewise, if a driver cannot stop in time for a mid-block crosswalk, they won't, even if the law requires it. Design is everything."

bicycling,3e29la,simoncolumbus,2,Tue Jul 21 15:58:17 2015 UTC,"Yes indeed. A cyclist can lean forward without entering the intersection and be certain it's clear before proceeding. But in MANY cases, a motorist can easily see if it's safe to go. Think of it this way: for as many traffic lights as there are, there are at least twice as many two-way stop signs that require motorists to look for cars and then make a judgement call before proceeding. I prefer to be pragmatic with my driving: if I'm approaching a green light, but something feels dodgy, I'll slow down to be sure, but if I'm stopped at a lame-ass red left-turn arrow, you can bet your balls I'm running that light if no one's coming."

bicycling,3e29la,Lewiiss,11,Tue Jul 21 12:23:35 2015 UTC,"In the UK speed limits don't apply to cyclists. Just the other day I overtook a car doing 30mph in a 30zone and I was doing 37mph, no laws broken.  Look at how cyclists and motorists jump lights. Cyclists tend to do it cautiously, looking first and doing it slowly. Motorists tend to do it by going through the light late and at speed. The difference first off between the weight and potential damage the two vehicles can do is vast, then take into account the speed differences and it is even bigger.  Anyway, I'm not condoning it from either side. The point here is that whilst people tend to point the finger at cyclists for being law breakers, they are more than likely to be one themselves, but apparently speeding is ok."
bicycling,3e29la,WolfThawra,9,Tue Jul 21 12:35:47 2015 UTC,"Also, passing bicycles with about an inch to clear is apparently ok. That one is actually dangerous. Me doing a left turn at a red light (in the UK) isn't really. I'm more concerned about actual safety than number of rules broken."

bicycling,3e29la,thegleaker,12,Tue Jul 21 16:26:57 2015 UTC,"This is pointless criticism of what the article is talking about, and is utterly missing the point. All road users selectively follow traffic laws as it suits their different needs, which is the point.  Beyond that, speeding is pretty damn awful compared to a bike rolling a stop sign (most people on bikes are not so stupid as to outright blow through intersections). A bike rolls a stop sign, someone at the intersection gets annoyed or delayed or at worst we have a fender bender. A car speeds, at worst the severity of any accidents that may happen are much worse (seriously: 60mph to 70mph, stopping distance increases about 25%). You are ignoring the capacity for harm in the contrast you are trying to make.  And here is the ultimate problem with how we share the road, as cyclists, with cars (and vice versa). The general public is far more tolerant of dangerous behaviours that don't seem rude (not signalling, close passing, speeding), and far more critical of rude behaviours that aren't that dangerous (e.g. ignoring right of way at a 4-way stop).  I am not advocating for people to just be rude all the time or break various traffic laws, but the disproportionate anger at relatively benign transgressions and the absurd comparisons between ""lawless"" cyclists and the traffic infractions we all turn a blind eye to as soon as we get behind the wheel is very much the point. What is benign for a car relative to another car (signals, speeding, etc) stops being benign around pedestrians and cyclists, and we all tend to ignore traffic laws as it suits us."

Just because the average person deems speeding to be a ""safe"" and acceptable violation of the law doesn't make it true.   Do you really think that more people die every year because a cyclist ran a red light than die because somebody was speeding in a car?"

(If I use my edge 500 without a HRM the figure seems laughably high - like a quick ride around the block to test a new saddle position and its saying hundreds of calories)  Your body stores glycogen in your muscles and liver. This is fuel for moderate - high intensity efforts. If you run out of this then you ""bonk"", so you typically want to eat about 1g of carbs per kg of body weight per hour. Why that amount? It's about what you can digest. You typically have around 2000 calories stored like this or 60-90 minutes of intense effort.  The other fuel is fat. You have tens to hundreds of thousands of calories of fat stored in your body - even if you're a 6% body fat lean athlete. Since most people are anything but 6% body fat and lean they have more than enough to spare.  When you finish you want to eat protein - to let your body repair and recover without tearing down muscle."

At any given time the 'most effective' (perhaps not most efficient) thing to do is let you body self select. So in a race or trying to drop your mates in a fast group ride just do what feels right.  For training, I definitely think it makes sense to consciously push up your cadence. This is basically what I have done (partially because I had to due to knee issues at lower cadences) now for FTP efforts I self select to around 100RPM, and for VO2max efforts it's close to 110.

I think I preferred the slightly higher gearing because it was fun to hustle with roadies when possible. Sometimes you'd get to a downhill and while they just ran a higher gear the best you could do is try to draft them and spin-out. Which sometimes worked.  Man, I miss my little whip. I can't wait to build another one."
bicycling,3e2fgf,getjustin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:15:07 2015 UTC,"47t up front means all the skid patches are open   As a non-fixed rider, what does this mean? Something to do with the ratio of front and back being ""in sync?"""
bicycling,3e2fgf,compliancekid78,2,Tue Jul 21 17:22:40 2015 UTC,"Yes, you have the basic concept.  The idea is that every pedal stroke will land the rear wheel in a new position so that a different spot of the tire touched the ground. The more possible spots that touch the ground (skid patches) the more evenly the wear distribution when you skid stop. If you only have five portions of tire that touch the ground (48/15, for example) and you like to skid stop then you'll wear through those five skid patches right quick. If, on the other hand, you have sixteen skid patches (47/16) it'll take a while longer to wear through every one of them because the wear will be more evenly distributed.  This is the main reason why 47 teeth is probably the only number I'll ever get for a single speed / fixed."
bicycling,3e2fgf,dyslexicsuntied,2,Tue Jul 21 17:42:42 2015 UTC,"With the odd number of teeth up front, they are not in sync. If you have the wrong ratio then the spot where you stop your pedals to force a skid will end up with the tire also stopping in the same few spots. You'll destroy your tires that way by constantly skidding on the same location"

bicycling,3e2fgf,mike413,5,Tue Jul 21 19:00:09 2015 UTC,"The actual paper: The effect of pedaling frequency on glycogen depletion rates in type I and type II quadriceps muscle fibers during submaximal cycling exercise  European Journal of Applied Physiology and Occupational Physiology 1992, Volume 65, Issue 4, pp 360-364   This study was conducted to determine whether the pedaling frequency of cycling at a constant metabolic cost contributes to the pattern of fiber-type glycogen depletion. On 2 separate days, eight men cycled for 30 min at approximately 85% of individual aerobic capacity at pedaling frequencies of either 50 or 100 rev·min−1. Muscle biopsy samples (vastus lateralis) were taken immediately prior to and after exercise. Individual fibers were classified as type I (slow twitch), or type II (fast twitch), using a myosin adenosine triphosphatase stain, and their glycogen content immediately prior to and after exercise quantified via microphotometry of periodic acid-Schiff stain. The 30-min exercise bout resulted in a 46% decrease in the mean optical density (D) of type I fibers during the 50 rev·min−1 condition [0.52 (0.07) to 0.28 (0.04)D units; mean (SEM)] which was not different (P>0.05) from the 35% decrease during the 100 rev · min−1 condition [0.48 (0.04) to 0.31 (0.05)D units]. In contrast, the meanD in type II fibers decreased 49% during the 50 rev·min−1 condition [0.53 (0.06) to 0.27 (0.04) units]. This decrease was greater (P<0.05) than the 33% decrease observed in the 100 rev·min −1 condition [0.48 (0.04) to 0.32 (0.06) units). In conclusion, cycling at the same metabolic cost at 50 rather than 100 rev·min−1 results in greater type II fiber glycogen depletion. This is attributed to the increased muscle force required to meet the higher resistance per cycle at the lower pedal frequency. These data are consistent with the view that force development as opposed to velocity of contraction determines the degree of type II fiber recruitment when the metabolic cost of exercise is held constant.   If anyone can get the full text, that would be cool. Also sounds kind of annoying for the cyclists because they are taking muscle biopsies, eww."

If you work better at lower cadence then that's cool."

If Ulrich had won the tour 5+ times instead of Armstrong everyone would have spent the last decade glorifying cadence in the 75-85 range.

bicycling,3e2fgf,finest_bear,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:20:32 2015 UTC,"This is interesting. I've often tried to keep my cadence around 80-90 and I've wondered if I'm not getting much of a workout out of it since I don't feel as much stress on my muscles. I guess you can always go to a faster gearing to increase the muscle strain at the current cadence, but it sounds like staying in a slower gear and increasing cadence is better.  Yesterday I forced myself to stay in the faster gear where keeping the high cadence was difficult but it gave me one of my best workouts in terms of heart rate and work done. Sometimes to get my heart rate up the only way to do it is to stay in that more difficult gear and push through, when just spinning in an easy gear it languishes around 110."

A car ""accident"" can be as minor as side swiping another vehicle while backing out of a parking spot or denting a bumper.  There are varying terms for a reason.  A ""fender bender"" denotes minor damage.  A ""car accident"" denotes medium damage, and a ""car crash"" or ""wreck"" denotes severe damage.  Do you know of many plane crashes where the plane is salvageable?  If a plane were to clip the wing of another plane on the tarmac you wouldn't call it a plane crash, you'd probably call it an accident."
bicycling,3e2gvr,road_to_nowhere,3,Tue Jul 21 15:33:23 2015 UTC,"I don't know why you got downvoted, as you're right. For one, every pilot goes through far more extensive training than drivers do, and almost every vehicle in the air is monitored by many people, where a car is only monitored by the person driving it. A car crash can cost thousands of dollars, but in comparison to a multi-million dollar plane crash, that is negligible.   I understand wanting to put more weight on the seriousness of car crashes, but comparing it to a plane crash is just not even in the same category at all."
bicycling,3e2gvr,SoaringFox,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:27:33 2015 UTC,"It has nothing to do with the severity of the damage. If I intentionally side-swipe another car, scratching it, is that an ""accident""? No, obviously not.  The FAA does use the term ""accident"", but because the standards they impose are extremely rigorous. When things go wrong, it is usually due to something beyond the pilot's control, such as a mechanical failure. You can't even get into the cockpit of an airliner until you have at least 1500 hours of flight time, including work as a flight instructor or military pilot. The reason we don't have many minor ""accidents"" happening on the tarmac is because we actually give a shit about airplane safety. That hypothetical pilot would probably never be allowed to fly again after demonstrating such incompetence. This is why airline travel is one of the safest forms of transportation (in the US).   On the other hand:   Drivers licenses are given out like candy. Even extremely incompetent people have no problem getting drivers licenses. Drivers are not regularly re-tested. People drive recklessly and inattentively, as if they don't care at all if they kill themselves and others. Fatal crashes are common. There are rarely any criminal penalties for killing someone with a car. The general public frequently sides with motorists in all things involving bicycles and pedestrians, blaming the victim, and claiming the road as car-only territory.   It's not simply an ""accident"" because, at multiple levels, people are choosing to create unsafe conditions. The government chooses to give drivers licenses out to people who shouldn't have them. The drivers choose to drive unsafely. The courts choose to not hold drivers accountable for their negligence."

Given that punctures are a thing, I've pretty much got at least one spare inner tube on my bikes all the time. More often some retailer has an offer if you buy 5, so I've a few at home too. Plus a repair kit on the bike that will repair most of the typical punctures.  So, you have to break down with a puncture, near the shop, when it's closed and on some occasion when you decided not to bother carrying a spare tube and you've got a puncture that is beyond repair?  It's not really happening. If you're that disorganised you've probably got no money with you either.  Far more likely, if a significant number of items from that list happened, that the ""be near the vending machine"" wouldn't be true.  Unless you scatter pumps and vending machines throughout rural England I'm going to be cycling in places where if I get a puncture, I've either got to repair / replace it with the tools and kit I've taken with me, or I've got to phone someone to fetch me.

Just because the shops are shut doesn't mean you have better working conditions.  If anything the reverse is true. I find the convenience of shops being open improves things when I'm not working - which is, if you think about it, just as important.  Given a choice of having a couple of days off a week, I would pick days when the shops were open rather than when they were closed.

There are plenty of people working in Germany on Sundays the same as everywhere else.   Yeah. I'd say much less. If I'd ask the guys over at my LBS if they would like to stand around and wait for me to drop in and fetch a tire instead of riding trails themselves or do whatever they do on sundays, they'd tell me to fuck off. Which is fair, because I'd do the same.   Given a choice of having a couple of days off a week, I would pick days when the shops were open rather than when they were closed.    Now I'm gonna blow your mind: That is what Saturday is for. The huge majority of people not working in retail and the like have saturday (or at least half of it) off, too.

That is what Saturday is for   Always having a pop at Jews :D (calm down, see the smiley) - but you see? Saturday, like Sunday is just a day. The only thing special about Sunday in your mind is not special for some other people - Saturday is. Is that worth gassing them over? Not imo.  See, I would advocate choice. Having ridiculous Sunday trading laws is not anything to do with good unions or nationalisation of industry or Margaret Thatcher.  But it's moot, you just effectively said ""buy your inner tubes on Saturday"" - which is exactly what I said - amongst other things - in my post about why inner tube vending machines are pointless.

This does not mean you should PAY that; pretty much every vendor has crazy sales all the damn time, so you can get 20-30% off those prices without trying very hard. That's just the level of short/bib that I find works best for me.

I have ordered probably 6 or 7 full kits from Aliexpress and I use them all the time. No regrets at all. Never going to buy another pair of $100 shorts in US stores ever again.

bicycling,3e2paa,smashinMIDGETS,3,Tue Jul 21 16:35:04 2015 UTC,"No one specific. There are SOOO many. I ordered from different ones each time. It's like ebay. Order only from vendors that have good ratings and feedback. If a vendor has zero rating and feedback, well... you are rolling the dice. Just like ebay. A lot of people assume Chinese sites like this are just a cesspool of people trying to rip you off. I don't believe this at all after my experience. It's full of 1000's of vendors just trying to make some money and whom are completely legit.  Also, don't get too hung up on which vendor to order from. Most vendors on there literally get their wares from the same factory. Maybe they are employees of the same factory? I dunno. If you see dozens of vendors that look like they are selling the exact same jerseys... they probably are. Just look for one that has good ratings and reviews and you'll be good. I have made ~dozen orders from Aliexpress on various vendors and have never had a bad experience.  Two things to keep in mind:   Pay attention to the sizing charts. A Large in US is not the same as a Large in China. Just take your measurements and figure out which size you need. Most of mine are XL and even XXL in some cases even though in US I wear a Large. Shipping from China takes 2-3 weeks. And tracking will not be reliable until the package reaches US shores. Just be patient.   In the end, you can get a good jersey and bib shorts for ~$40 with free shipping. Try it out once and see if you like em. Can't go wrong for that cheap especially when compared to $200 kits in the US.  Also, just to be clear, the gear you are buying is an imitation. Like if you buy some Tinkoff Saxo kit, it's a rip off of the real thing. It's not the exact same thing as if you bought something off their official website for $250. But like I said, the quality is definitely not far off and it's just a shirt and some shorts so who cares as long as they are comfortable and look good?   Enjoy!"

bicycling,3e3ejm,weegreen,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:30:14 2015 UTC,Was looking to get back into cycling for a bit of fitness and for something to do with my evenings and weekends. A friend very kindly offered me his bike for free since he wasn't using it anymore.  After a full strip and service (with the help of my Dad!) it just needed a new front wheel to be road-worthy. Fitted that today (hence the different wheel in the photo) and it's all ready to go!  Would anyone recommend any other small upgrades I could make to this to make it a bit more comfortable. I have a feeling that I won't enjoy the bar and grip-shifts on longer journeys. Is it worth fitting a drop bar or would I need to change the full gearset?  It currently has some cheap (Alhonga?!) v-brakes on it. Worth upgrading?  Any advice would be really appreciated!
bicycling,3e3ejm,indiecore,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:34:17 2015 UTC,"Update your shifters and get a new saddle, that'll probably give you a great deal of comfort upgrade.   If you want brifters you'll need to update the bar and depending on what cassette you have on the back they might be hard to find. I upgraded my Triple cross with some trekking bars (same size as flat bar) and some rapidfire shifters and it's great."
bicycling,3e30wb,harrydeweylegend,5,Tue Jul 21 15:56:35 2015 UTC,"I suggest keeping some clothes at work and changing there.   If that's not possible then the next best route is panniers. I had a friend who used a garment type bag from Nashbar for a suite before. It looked something like this. You could probably also rig up a normal garment bag over a rear rack if you have one of those, or can score one from goodwill.  If that option is also bad then you're left with a backpack. I use a Osprey Radial. It's pretty massive and the elevated back panel helps some with sweating."

bicycling,3e30wb,MogwaiInjustice,4,Tue Jul 21 19:24:57 2015 UTC,"So perhaps this wont work for you unless you can actually keep the suit at the office but I use the Especial Raider pack by Timbuk2  http://www.timbuk2.com/especial-raider-cycling-backpack/423.html  It has a folding board and shirt pocket so I can put in my dress shirt and pants on the folding board, put it in it's own pocket and keep them relatively wrinkle free. I can then fill up the rest of the bag with whatever I need and not worry about it wrinkling my other clothes. It even has pockets for shoes."

bicycling,3e30wb,ilipah,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:03:39 2015 UTC,"Most people will recommend a rack and panniers for dedicated commuting, and I too see the logic (less strain on back especially if carrying heavy stuff, better temp control on back) but I have a bombproof backpack from MEC that hasn't died after 6 years of use so I keep using it. It has 25L carrying capacity. They don't sell it anymore but have replaced it with other similar packs.  I carefully fold and pack clothes to keep them from getting wrinkled. Also it helps if you can leave a bit of your stuff at work (belt, shoes, toiletries, I leave a few pair of pants at work) to free up space. Any time my shirt gets wrinkled it is because I was in a rush and jammed it in the bag. I've used my jansport book bag style backpack from my university days a few times, and it is actually better for clothes because it has a larger rectangular shape, but is is too big for me most days (40L capacity).  You can google ""eagle creek clothes folder"", they sell a device that is for your bag, supposed to keep clothes from getting wrinkled. Guy I work with has one, says it works ok."
bicycling,3e30wb,Mattho,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:22:25 2015 UTC,"Don't have a specific suggestion, but get a pannier. Or at least have a look at them. It's so much better. Every single bag will leave you with sweaty back. You can carry much more in panniers too (weight and size wise). There are some that can double as a backpack if you need to park your bike somewhere and want to take the pack with you. Or something as Ortlieb is very easy to get on and off a rack."

Get something without knobby by tires as that's annoying on the road and slicks are actually ok on snow if the tires are thin. They cut through the snow like an ice breaker rather than float on top. The roads are clear the vast majority of winter days or at least mostly plowed, so spikes are overkill.  Put full fenders on it. This is basically one the the more important things for a commuting bike.  Put a rear rack on it. Panniers or a backpacks are fine. For that distance,  I would buy panniers to save your back.  Brifters are awesome, but require more maintenance.  Downtube shifters and bar end shifters are not as instant to shift, but they are indestructible in the rain and salt.  Bring spare clothes or buy rain gear. In the winter,  rain gear is good anyway to cut down on wind.   Helmet.  Buy a blinky back light and a solid front light. Don't cheap out on the front light. There's a lot of deals on amazon as well."

Fat bikes are fun, but you'll blow that entire $1000 on a bike that might be nice once or twice a year, but impractical every single other day. Riding in the snow is more about learning to ride in the snow (don't lean into turns, give yourself room, watch for manhole covers, etc.) than your specific bike for most conditions."

bicycling,3e2u7k,Cranky24-7,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:19:38 2015 UTC,"A bike with brifters is about as smooth as you can get for shifting ability and if you store it indoors then maintenance should be less of a factor.  Get yourself a U-lock rather than a cable lock, even for just locking it up outside a store for 30 minutes.    Cyclocross bikes tend to run a little more expensive, but disk brakes can be nice when freezing rain can coat your rims.  They also have wider frame clearance to accept many types of tires and will give your fenders more space if snow clumps up a bit.  The cool thing is that as long as they don't have knobby tires, they ride pretty much the same as an other road bike."

Winter bicycling commuting is defiantely possible, but does take a little planning; I managed to do it all last winter, and even if you can't do it every day it can still help on the days it is viable.  Most of your commute would be along the charles river bike path; not sure how well that is maintained in the winter.  You can definately get something great for that price, but be sure to take into account cost of accessories (you may not need to buy all this stuff at once). So, for example, in addition to the summer ones, you'll want to get some winter tires; studded ones help. You'll to get can accept (or even includes) fenders. You'll probably want one that can take a rear rack. Also, invest in some good gloves, a synthetic jacket of some sort, and a balaclava."

It sounds like you are entirely too tense in the saddle and that is causing some strain in your traps.  Look into some exercises to strengthen your core and try to relax in the saddle and let your legs and core do the work, and I think you'll start to feel better."
bicycling,3e35ir,pawptart,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:03:51 2015 UTC,"I guess that's what I'm trying to get at. How should my arms feel on the bike? Because now it feels like they are pushing me up from the handlebar, but it sounds like they should feel more like balancing struts that don't hold much weight but keep me up right (if I'm understanding correctly).   I've started doing core workouts, so hopefully that will help. But would moving the handlebars up the steering tube help as well? Currently it's dropped by two of the skinny spacers."
bicycling,3e35ir,pawptart,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:20:50 2015 UTC,"Ideally you can hold yourself up without any pressure from your arms. You are right, though, your arms are more for balance than anything. You shouldn't have to lock your arms at the elbows to hold yourself up. Getting into an aero position is going to be really hard until you have more core strength.  Raising the bars will help in the short term for your shoulder pain but I think that's ignoring the main issue of trunk stability."

bicycling,3e2cdj,mycloudlesssky,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:39:03 2015 UTC,"Go with the advice of buying a used bike. The trouble with really cheap new bikes is that their parts are usually not servicable and therefore will require you to get a new bike as soon as something breaks. With a used bike from a well-known brand you'll be able to replace parts when they need to / when you want to.   Also, I would go single-speed as it's a lot cheaper and easier to maintain. Usually the drivetrain goes first on geared bikes, so single-speed lasts much longer before it needs maintenance."

bicycling,3dzyy5,Mattho,2,Tue Jul 21 02:11:28 2015 UTC,"The above image is made by many skinny (in terms of width) images. See the feint red lines, let's say those are the vertical borders of the image the camera takes, each one of the photos is of the exact same spot on the track. The left most image is slightly before the subjects crossed the line as you don't see anything besides the finish line, and the right most side is a bit after they crossed it as it shows the middle of the bike over it. This is why the wheels appear warped, because when the very front of the wheel hits the finish line, the position of its spokes are different than when the back end of the front wheel crosses the finish line, the wheel slightly rotated. If you wanted, you could create a slowmo gif of just the thin slice, by switching between each one, moving from the left to the right.  In simpler terms, the thin slice to the left of a given slice is the same point, just earlier in time, and the thin slice to the right is later in time."

bicycling,3dyy0p,4wd22r,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:15:09 2015 UTC,"Jeg købte min til 9000 i Design Cykler, som værende den bedste pris jeg kunne få på en carbon ramme m. 105 gruppe (FSA kranksæt dog).  Til det formål er den fin nok, men jeg kom til at købe en størrelse hvor jeg hviler lidt på en knivsæg, da den er næsten en smule for stor. Størrelserne er lidt mærkelige, da jeg egentlig normalt bruger 56, købte en 57, men overrøret er like en kilometer langt i forhold til hvad jeg er vant til. Til prisen er den dog top notch. Hvis jeg skulle købe en igen nu, så ville jeg dog ikke være bleg for at bruge mine 9000 brugt i stedet, og få en noget vildere deal.   Pros ved den: Carbon, 105 for/bag/greb, lækker sadel og lækre dæk med i prisen. Generelt temmelig fed valuta for pengene, hvis man kigger på delenes løsværdi.  Cons: Frempind, kranksæt, hjulsæt og bremser ligger i den billige ende. Det gør hjulsæt ret beset næsten altid for fabrikscykler, men det skal dog alligevel nævnes. Kranksættet er en almindelig firkantsaksel type, hvilket er lidt en skam på en racer der ellers har så sweet dele. Bremser er generic tektro, ikke så meget at sige der."

Så jeg leder efter en der er lidt mere komfortabel, og har fundet Rock Machine cyklen til 8000 kr. nu, hvilket er pænt billigt for en carbon cykel. Men det lyder til, at man skal være påpasselig med størrelsen. Kunne godt tænke mig de nye 105 5800 gear, men 2015 versionen af din koster bare 10k, hvilket er i overkanten.

As much as they'll try to promote it - like in the video - there isnt any technological innovation (in hard engineering sense) in this industry.    It's just a matter of making unappealing dorky bike wear not look like ass.  And for inexplicable reason all bikewear looked like complete billboard-plaster ass before Rapha came along.

I'd love to have some upgrades in mind in the future, but there's nothing worth upgrading other than the wheels (and possibly brakes, but that doesn't really aid in speed), and to find any sort of impact it's well over £500.  Seems like a lot of money for not much.

The DT Axis 2.0 (which looks like this has) are notoriously heavy.  You can pick up a set of Campagnolo Zondas (circa 1500g) for about £250 ($390), and paired with some latex tubes and some good tires (such as GP4000sii) you'll definitely notice a difference in terms of speed and improved road feel."

bicycling,3e1rtc,emersonthird,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:45:01 2015 UTC,"Other people have said it but wheels are probably the best investment. For wheels that are worth 400-500: this set on sale from Nashbar is pretty good I'm a fan of Vuelta's, I have a similar set that only needed minor truing in the rear wheel after about 1500 miles. Very durable. But truthfully your current set is decent enough that the set I linked won't be a huge bang for your buck.   If I were you, I would save up for a higher price range. And I love plugging American Classic I own the Argents on my Cx bike, and use the 420 Aero 3s for racing. (I use my Vuelta's for training). American Classic is a fantastic wheel company and I can't recommend them enough.  The two best features I have found with AmClassic is the incredible ride quality, and the durability of their products.   But overall, the general advice here is sound: make sure your cockpit is comfortable and fits you right, then get wheels. And honestly when it comes to groupsets - you have a pretty good one. If you are ever considering top end groupsets, it's usually better to save for a whole new bike. I have a 2008 Allez and it has always been my favorite."

bicycling,3e1kbh,Akuze25,5,Tue Jul 21 06:31:54 2015 UTC,Friction shifters.  Big learning curve but on the plus side they're super reliable.  Not much to break.  When you want to shift keep the pedals and chain spinning but don't actually push into it like you would to propel the bike forward.  Push the lever until it shifts and then pull it back just slightly.  As you get more familiar you'll dial in just how much to push and pull and you'll learn to hear the clacking that says your dérailleur is not in the right spot.  For now just make a point of shifting like you're OCD so it becomes second nature for you.  Practice makes it fluid.
bicycling,3e1kbh,SavingHawaii,3,Tue Jul 21 07:15:15 2015 UTC,"Well, first, get the bike to your LBS and have them check the levers and derailleurs and cables to make sure they actually work as they should. It could very well be the cables are in need of replacement so the gears don't even shift like they should.  Anyway, the two levers are for front derailleur (usually left lever) where you have two choices of gears, and the other for rear where you have five gears. Most of the time you would be adjusting the rear, i.e. right side lever.  What you had in your market bike were indexed shifters which click when you use them. The indexing makes the lever automatically find the correct place for each gear. 70s bikes don't have indexing but friction shifters where the user has to find the correct position for the lever.  It can be a bit challenging at first but friction shifters are not difficult to use once you get the hang of it. Try pedaling at a very leisurely pace with little pressure on the pedals, then slowly turn the right side lever up or down. It will make a bit of noise, then shift to a larger or smaller gear on the rear hub. Once you feel the gear has shifted, there will still be noise - you have to find the correct position for the lever where the excess noise stops. Adjust it very carefully, first a bit more in the same direction you were going, if that does not help, then very carefully back. Between too high and too low there should be a sweet spot for each gear where the chain is not rubbing against anything and does not make any noise. With some practice you will learn to find that spot without thinking every time you shift.  http://www.sheldonbrown.com/gears.html"
bicycling,3e1kbh,d64,2,Tue Jul 21 06:41:20 2015 UTC,Friction shifters.  Just go by feel and sound.
bicycling,3e1kbh,PointlessIndulgence,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:41:09 2015 UTC,"What you have are called Downtube Shifters, which were standard on bikes in that time period (my bike also has them its from '86). There's really know way to know exactly which gear you are on, you just need to develop a feel for it. It will take about a week to get used to, but after that it should become automatic and you won't even have to look down. Just go ride it around and learn how much tweaking it takes to move the chain and the general position of the gears. Also, the best thing about these shifters is that they don't break or need as much tuning as indexed ones. Good luck!"
bicycling,3e1kbh,qnal96,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:42:01 2015 UTC,They're only called that if they are on the down-tube. They could be on the stem or the bar-ends.

bicycling,3e0hmx,arasarn,2,Tue Jul 21 15:31:11 2015 UTC,I got the Search S1 about a month ago and have put 600Kms on it.  It has the full 105 including crank set and has a carbon fork and seat post.  Even with only the 28c tires it came with I have been taking down some really gnarly gravel roads.  I am really feeling that this ride is like 3 bikes in one.  It's a great adventure road with the stock tires.  I put on 23c tires and it is a fast road bike. The frame also has clearance for 35c tires and braze-ons for rear rack mounting so I am also planning on touring with it next summer too.  Here is a picture of mine; https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CKStJsGUMAAlfdR.jpg:large  Loaded up with water and a bathing suit and ultra light pack towel for a mid ride swim in rural western Quebec.

bicycling,3e1nua,Kroopah,2,Tue Jul 21 07:14:08 2015 UTC,"3 is overpriced when compared to 1, a similar looking bike that allegedly needs no work. 2 is decent, but still kind of high for needing work. That bike is more like a $50-$100 bike in that condition. It is still a low end mountain bike, after all. And for example, you can see that the brake cable on the front tire is too long, and it rubs on the tire. You could probably bend it out of the way, but ideally you would cut it and re-crimp the end. Also, for campus use, you would probably want to switch it to road tires, which would be about $30 on the cheap end. 1 is probably your best bet considering that it needs nothing. It's kind of funny that you posted that since I see this guy posting bikes on eBay all the time. Still, it's a low-end bike and he's asking top-dollar."

If I were riding out into the great unknown, I'd probably stick with a traditional full steel-frameset for maximum durability.

To be fair to you, your advice works on the first half of a stage when the breaks only a few minutes ahead and full of nobodies, but the fact he's pushing him aside means there's no time to ""go around""."

In a race ... you're in the wrong place if you expect it won't get physical.  He kept his hands on the bars, feet on the pedals.  He was clearly the faster rider, and needed to make a hole.  That wasn't more than a love tap."
bicycling,3dxqg0,ieabu,2,Mon Jul 20 17:50:54 2015 UTC,"I totally understand. I just think the shoulder push at the end wasn't necessary to notify the other rider that he was there.

bicycling,3dxqg0,Gnascher,5,Mon Jul 20 19:31:58 2015 UTC,"Look carefully, it all happens quite fast.  He's first got the elbow on the hip, and the guy ain't budging.  Just before the shoulder shove, you see the other guy's knee turn out ... he's fighting back.  The shoulder shove was ""eff you, I'm coming through""."
bicycling,3dxqg0,ieabu,4,Mon Jul 20 19:43:38 2015 UTC,Oh! I didn't see the guy on the left leaning and pushing with his knee preventing him from passing. My bad!
bicycling,3dxqg0,rbroccoli,8,Mon Jul 20 19:56:02 2015 UTC,"There's no aggression in the elbow tap, it's simply notifying the other rider that he's at his right so he didn't move in towards him. Hollering ""at your right"" doesn't do very much as there are so many people shouting around the riders, that it would be difficult to know who was being spoken to. Not to mention language barriers and the difficulty of speaking when sprinting past aerobic threshold"
bicycling,3dxqg0,ieabu,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:56:02 2015 UTC,Thanks for clarifying. The elbow tap/touching looks fine by me; enough to notify the other of your presence. But it's the shoulder push at the end that I find aggressive.  I don't watch many races so thanks for the info!
bicycling,3dxqg0,CarrotIronfounderson,2,Mon Jul 20 19:33:59 2015 UTC,"The guy was crowding him/not letting him pass after he gave warning that he was coming up. So Sagan made the hole himself. Both are sort of justified gray areas. If you're next to a rider who is clearly gaining on you, and your other side is free, you either be a nice guy and give him room, or make him fight for every inche he gains. Likewise if you have a bit of a hole and know the guy is just making you fight to open it-then you fight to open it."
bicycling,3dxqg0,rbroccoli,2,Tue Jul 21 04:13:43 2015 UTC,"I see what you're talking about there. Pro riders are good enough at handling to take shoulder bumps, that's more of a squeezing his way through gesture, but not out of aggression. It tends to happen during sprint segments, because the sprinters are having to work their way out of the middle of the peloton as quickly as possible to get green jersey points"

I think you'd mostly have towns with accomodation within a day's ride of each other along the coast (say 60-100km). It might be a little bit hard to find something in the very far eastern part of Gippsland (in Victoria past Orbost).   There aren't that many backpacker hostels along there, but there would be caravan parks and pubs for cheap accomodation.  25 is average, but it could also have a high of 35.

Ideally ride in the lane but to the right to some degree in order to allow for cars to pass but not to end up on the sidewalk or not be noticed. Stop signs and red lights are legally the same for you as they would be while driving. That being said, the concept of an Idaho Stop is more often used at stop signs (Check traffic while rolling up slowly, if there is obviously no one else at the intersection roll through without stopping. The aspect of red light/stop sign ediquette seems to very a little bit amongst cyclists as some people ignore it, but others (and I'm more this person) choose to recognize red lights and wait them out. I'm a big fan of defensive, orderly cycling because I don't want to include myself in any of the negative things that some cyclists take part in.  -Three way intersections are more or less the same as above. If there's a lot, it's really an individual choice, but ideally just act as a car if you want to avoid getting a ticket or being a nuisance to other cyclists and people on the road.  -Riding at night is definitely a little eerie, but as long as you have some reflectors, good lights, and the awareness that you are vulnerable you're all good! Just remember, cars are bigger than you and your best bet is riding defensively. The moment that you try to be aggressive and show a car their place is the moment you get hit and wind up in the hospital.  I know biking is strange at first, but all you can do is do it and try and get used to it. Once it clicks and you feel comfy on your bike, it's pretty much all you want to do."

bicycling,3e0m1b,palenth_,2,Tue Jul 21 01:34:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah I totally agree with these points about traffic laws from the previous commenter. Just wanted to add--I always stop at red lights but if you're the only one at the light your weight may not be enough to trigger the light change--this happens to me late at night and early in the morning. If that's the case I just triple check no one's coming and go on through.   Your best bet is to be as visible and predictable as possible which should include hand signals. Stick your right hand out if you're turning right and your left hand out if you're turning left, I don't mess with the left hand up for right because I don't feel it's intuitive for whoever's behind me. When changing lanes you should look behind you to check if you have a spot, then signal, and check again before you switch.   Get some flashing lights for the front and back of your bike when you're riding at night. Don't ride too far over to the right side of the road or you'll run over way more glass, cars may try to pass when there's not enough room, and if there are any parked cars you might get hit by a door!  Hope you enjoy commuting! A chain or a good U-lock is way better than those flimsy cable locks."

bicycling,3dwunq,Timmoth_Jones,25,Mon Jul 20 11:11:18 2015 UTC,"Disc wheels are slightly more aerodynamic than are spoked wheels. They are also considerably more liable to be blown around by crosswinds. So, on a TT bike, where you're already only steering with your elbows, leaving the front wheel spoked makes you less likely to eat it because you came around a ridge at the wrong angle to the new wind. The front wheel being your steering wheel is considerably more important in the analysis of which should be prioritized for stability.   This is sort of the same reason you put panniers on back rather than front when you're only adding only one set: it messes with your steering (with panniers, it's also weight), so it's best avoided."

bicycling,3dzfed,3MATX,3,Mon Jul 20 23:46:45 2015 UTC,with that kind of budget you can either look at some very decent carbon frames or custom build a great steel bike. If you want to go carbon consider the Trek Domane  http://www.trekbikes.com/us/en/bikes/road/endurance_race/domane/domane_4_3_disc_compact/# If you want to go steel you could look into a Gunnar made by Waterford.

Domane Disc: http://www.trekbikes.com/us/en/bikes/road/endurance_race/domane/domane_4_5_disc_compact/  very good reviews and it has the affore mentioned through axles. EDIT: But even this bike doesn't have any internal cable routing which makes me not want to recommend it.   I want to recommend the synapse disc but it appears to have quick releases in both the 2015 and 2016 model years for disc...  To be honest, it is a shitty time to try and upgrade. Road bikes are making the transition to disc brakes, through axles, and a flat mount disc brake system... there are 2 or three bikes in the endurance segment that have disc and through axle... but not a whole lot of options. there should be many more options 2 years from now.

The area I live in is a little different than Tallahasssee, where I grew up. There's a lot more ""redneck rich"" where I live. Lower cost of living means even upper middle class can afford toys like nice boats. 100k here means you can afford a nice boat, truck and the operation costs of hauling it to the coast to go fishing at least once a month.

Some people would rather have a small mansion in a town that's never heard of a Nordstrom's, a Michelin star, or a drink costing more than $5, and is completely shut down every night by 8pm (except the Walmart), and some people would rather have a 250sq ft apartment in the heart of a city that never sleeps, always have something going on, has the best of many things on earth readily available (food, entertainment, shopping), etc.  My father, for example, would literally rather die than have to live in NYC. Literally. And my sister's plan is to live in Seoul (a dirtier and somewhat more condensed NYC).   They are from the same family and no amount of convincing or money would change their mind. My sister would rather have a closet in NYC than be in a mansion in the sticks somewhere. And vice versa for my father.   These rent price/sq foot dick swinging threads always turn out the same. Some guy tries to humblebrag about paying $2000 for a small apartment in the city, then 10 people comment about their various rents in podunk towns throughout the U.S. like the op wanted, then he gets to say 'yeah but then you live in X! hAhA'  People like drastically different things. Can we accept that?"

It's not the city that never sleeps.  Sure there are some areas that are open later than others like the village but most of the city is really like everywhere else.    I have stayed in smaller cities and suburban areas and really most pizza shops and other takeout close at around 10. It's the same here in NYC. Most bars close when customers stop coming or the legislated max.  Restaurants try to keep to 9pm and while some stay open later in NYC it really depends on the restaurant.  The local dry cleaners or Butcher for example is going to close at around 7PM no matter if you are in Scranton PA or NYC. The library is going to have a late day or two where it closes at 7 and then they will normally close at 6.   Most supermarkets I have found in the suburbs are open 24/7 when they are not here.  Places like CVS too and we are just starting to see them being open 24/7 here in nyc.  5 years ago that was not a thing.  NYC has it's limitations. The entire transit system doesn't run 24/7 either. So really it's not the city that never sleeps.  Things stay open based on demand."

I couldn't do NYC or SF or DC, but I couldn't do anywhere in a town of under 100k people that shuts down at 8 PM either (I could maybe do like, a a college town around that size).

bicycling,3e1b5z,stevenlongs,2,Tue Jul 21 05:30:47 2015 UTC,Uhh.  The speed difference is significant between a stock cross bike and a stock road bike.  It's called 32mm knobby tires.  If you swap those tires out for 25mm road slicks you evaporate almost all of the speed difference.  That's what people do and they save the cross tires for days when they're specifically planning to romp off-road.

What it came down to is the fact that I only ride on pavement with slicks...there's no point for me to get a CX bike.   I got an ""endurance"" bike anyways...so I could technically fit wider slicks on there, but honestly the 25s are doing me good!"

But having test ridden a road bike I really like the lightness and speed of it.  Comparing the components of LTD vs ALR 5, it seems brakes are better with LTD but ALR has better gears (10 vs 11 shimano 105). And ALR has higher quality aluminum frame, so it seems.  So my question is, is the difference in the quality of aluminum frame and gear overshadow LTD's better brakes and versatility? Thanks a lot for the input."

bicycling,3dzy76,blood4lyfe,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:05:55 2015 UTC,"It's reliable, and it's indestructible, and $80 isn't a terrible price for it overall.

(I swapped mine myself).  These things are indestructible, and I want to stress that: totally tough. That said, they are HEAVY. If you are looking for something to start out on that you can learn and make mistake with and make mistakes on, then this is a good bike for you. If you're riding with the intent of competing with the bike you buy? It is definitely not a good bike. For a daily rider, commuter, or beater or bar bike or just to 'have a bike,' this is a very good bike- it is something you can hand down to your grandkids. They're reliable as all hell. Also, keep in mind, that a bike's size is what determines whether it's a good bike for you, moreso than whether or not it's a road/mountain/hybrid.  Try and talk the seller down a little bit, because of the back wheel not being straight- a good shop can fix that in minutes, for around $20, so see if you can get him down by $15 or $20."

I haven't seen your tires, but I would bet my maximum amount of money I wager in bets* that theres a problem with your outer tubing or your rim tape (less probably).  Look at every square inch of your tire, flip it inside out and flex it to see if there are cuts and/or stuck grains of glass embedded in it.  There are other possibilities: it is possible that your inner tube was stuck between the rim wall of your wheel and your outer tire. Or that the spoke holes of your wheels rim are not cleanly cut. You should investigate every of these possibilities.  *50ct. I'm a scrooge while betting."

A 1-2 year old used bike will have much higher spec components at the same price."
bicycling,3dztbz,kimbo305,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:34:14 2015 UTC,"I have one, got it at the January sale at wiggle for a very good price. For the price I got it for it's a very nice bike. The frame seems to be well made and the geometry fits me well. The bike rides better than both the Focus variado and Mekk potenza (carbon) I had before it.  The components are solid, not anything fancy but stuff that works.  The 105 shifters have worked flawlessly, the cinelli finishing kit is nice but their bottom level and therefore not light, I swapped out the saddle and probably will swap out the handlebars as I don't like the curve and the drops are pretty shallow (might be nice for a beginner). The FSA crankset is ok but it uses a 19mm axle rather than 24 or 30 so I find it flexes a bit. The wheels (Shimano R500) are heavy but they have stayed true and have not needed any service, they are 30mm with flat aero spokes. The tires it comes with are trash, some very cheap vittoria, swap them out for some nice 25mm.  Total weight of my bike is ~10kg with the shimano m520 pedals and two bottle cages.  Overall I would say it's a nice bike if you get it at a discount, I bought it cause I needed a bike for the turbo trainer and this was available at almost half price from wiggle, I like how it rides and will probably keep it, maybe upgrade the wheels. If you need to pay full price then check out some other brands. Only thing that bothers me is that cinelli states the frame is designed for 28mm tires, but the clamp they use for the front derailleur has its hinge in a stupid place taking up alot of the clearence so I doubt 28mm tires will fit, 25mm fit fine though. And this clamp can't be swapped out cause the seattube is tapered and has a non standard with where the derailleur sits."

bicycling,3dw2dh,pifarm,3,Mon Jul 20 10:07:39 2015 UTC,"If you look at most sizing charts,  a 56 goes from 5'-something to 6', and a 58 goes from 6' to 6'-something.   So at our height, we're really on the dividing line, and much will depend on the bike's geometry, setup and personal preference.   I have a fairly long stem, which probably helps make the 56 work for me along with my own personal dimensions and bike geometry. I like the longer stem, because it helps get my weight forward a bit which is good for cornering and descending."
bicycling,3dw2dh,Gnascher,2,Mon Jul 20 11:23:18 2015 UTC,Bike geometry is a big part of this too. My 56 track bike feels much smaller than my 56 road frame and my 54 cross frame feels about the same as my road frame.

Honestly you are going to have more like finding a frame you like and then building the bike up.  If you are mechanically inclined, the build could be fun, but if you are having a shop do it, most of them won't have much experience with good internal gear drives or dynamo lights, though a rear rack won't be too odd.  In the US, most bikes are bought for recreation, not transportation so the idea of buying something with an integrated rack, fenders, lights, and internal gears is somewhat foreign.  Unfortunately."

I'm not a mechanic at all, that's why I wanted to find a bike and buy it, not build it, but you're right, it seems like it is going to be really hard to find what I want...  I've found some bikes (like the options 1 and 2 of blueberryspies), that I like, but that don't have everything I want. So the question is: how difficult is it for a mechanic to adapt a bike for me? Like, install an internal gear drive or a dynamo light on a bike that doesn't have them already? I found a Linus bike dealer in my city, so I think that he must have at least some experience with internal gear, as Linus bikes have them (only 3 gears though...).  I ask because the idea of building a bike completely from scratch scares me a little (even if I have a someone else do it for me...)."

bicycling,3dzyk2,merelyadoptedthedark,3,Mon Jul 20 22:06:02 2015 UTC,"Know your route before you go. And if you are unsure plan in 2 or 3 places you could stop on the way if needed. This could also let you carry a little less since you can pick up from shops. Speaking of which, don't hesitate on drinking enough water, and stock up when you can along the way. If you are unsure what route you are going to take use the Strava route builder which will build a route according to the most popular roads taken by other cyclists in the area.  Make sure you've got food to last the journey. I typically aim to eat every half hour or so, starting from when I set off. Vary your food. There's only so many gels or energy bars you can tolerate during a day trip. If you're out for about 5 hours that means you need enough to last that time  Make sure your bike is in working order now, not the night before. Make sure you've got all the tools to fix any problems that could arise. And know how to fix them.   When you start, take it easy to begin with, no matter how good you feel. You aren't going to feel that way on the way back, so save it for then. And be conscious of wind direction. If it's a headwind on the way home you're going to want something extra left in the tank.  Lastly, do the extra 17k and get a proper century! It'll be a tough ask when you are nearing home, but if you think you've got the legs do an easy loop near home to earn the bragging rights. If not, get into the shower as soon as possible. I'd also recommend a cold bath after a particularly strenuous ride, but I can understand why that might be unappealing.   Good luck, hope you enjoy it!"

bicycling,3dzyk2,phollingswo,2,Tue Jul 21 03:30:29 2015 UTC,"Night before, avoid red meat (harder to digest), have some fish or chicken, some vegetables and some rice (better than pasta). Don't need to go too heavy on the carbs, just get a nice healthy balanced meal. Drink lots of water!!  Morning of ride: Big bowl of oatmeal with some honey, fruit, and a banana. This is your most important meal.   On the ride: Eat a bit every hour, try and stick to solids for as long as possible, don't be banging through gels every 20 minutes else you might get the runs! Don't try anything you're not used to eating, as your gut might not like it. Ideal things are bananas, flapjacks, peanut butter sandwiches. Essentially you want high energy content for low volume. Key is to KEEP EATING AND DRINKING throughout the ride.   Erm what else. If you can get some chamois cream (assuming you're wearing bibs or padded shorts?). It'll help prevent chafing and make the long time in the saddle a lot more comfortable."

bicycling,3dz9kg,wthom4s,2,Mon Jul 20 19:55:21 2015 UTC,"As a general rule, the center of the cleat should line up with the ball of your foot.  So, take a pen and make a small mark on the side of the shoe where the ball of your foot is and line the cleat up with that.  The stickers, which are pretty much not useful, go inside the shoe under the insole and over the cleat.  You can loosen (or tighten) the ""ease of exit"" by turning the little allen key on the pedal (at the bottom of the pedal in your picture).  Generally, start looser and tighten as you gain confidence.  Since you will likely make a couple of adjustments after you initially screw in the cleat, you might wait until after you get them where you want them before using the stickers.

Made the decision to go with a road system, Sidi shoes and Speedplay Zero pedals after reading r/cycling, r/bicycling and talking to fellow riders; ended up with Specialized shoes and R550 SPD-SL pedals, and they are AWESOME. Went on a 60+ mile ride yesterday and had a blast.  I originally wanted Speedplays because of the double sided entry, but apparently they are the worst if you are a lighter rider because I could not for the life of me break into them even after 50-100 times of clipping in and out with much effort. 3 bike shops couldn't solve the issue, so I switched to SPD-SLs and couldn't be happier.   For shoes, I recommend just trying every shoe your LBSs have in stock in your size and seeing what feels the best within your price range. I was so set on Sidis but I absolutely love the shoes I ended up with.  Of course, if you are more suited to mountain shoes/pedals (e.g., if you do a lot of walking off your bike) then you should go down that route.  Good luck with the switch!"

If your seat isn't good enough, no amount of padding saves you from discomfort.  I don't wear gloves at all unless I'm cold. I've done metric centuries a few times, regularly do 50+km rides.

There's not really any objective measure that makes a POC worth $100 more than a Giro.

If you try on a POC and it feels like God's favorite angels are cradling your dainty head and whispering sweet nothings in your ears, and you can afford it, have at it, it's a nice helmet.  If you were planning on spending Giro Atmos money, and are wondering if it's worth spending $100 more, no, it's not.  Check for sales too though.

The nice thing about Rudy helmets is that they have really great features that you'd find on more expensive helmets.   I wouldnt call the windmax heavy but the aerostorm isn't a racing helmet for the best racers.

If you need them, brake lever sets range all the way from $12 for crappy Tektro levers to around $75-80 for some really sweet Paul Components ones.

bicycling,3dxfkt,goes123,13,Mon Jul 20 09:39:33 2015 UTC,Personally if building a bike from new I would probably go with 5800 105. Excellent price and 6800 Ultegra is only slightly better.
bicycling,3dxfkt,markhewitt1978,8,Mon Jul 20 11:30:10 2015 UTC,"I think it is worth mentioning that Shimano and SRAM feel very different while riding. You should test both, and then decide which companys style you want.  I found SRAMs DoupleTap very intuitive and easy to use, and didn't feel at home with Shimanos STIs because I found the shifting motion very unnatural. This is very much a matter of taste, there are many cyclers out there which think it's the other way round.  So, first do some test rides, then decide which of the groupset price brackets you want. (SRAMs Rival is worth mentioning.)"
bicycling,3dxfkt,U03A6,3,Mon Jul 20 10:47:57 2015 UTC,Seconding this.  I ride Shimano and test rode SRAM once - even after that I had to have it explained to me!
bicycling,3dxfkt,giantnakedrei,2,Mon Jul 20 12:17:13 2015 UTC,"Thirding.  I had Shimano and dumped it for SRAM - DoubleTap makes more sense in my mind  I really would have preferred Campy, but the local dealer steered me away from it a bit because was different back in the 10 speed SRAM/Shimano days, because if you break a chain you had to have the Campy peening tool, which not every shop would have, and I went places that were a bit off the beaten path.  Now everyone's going to have a SRAM or Shimano 11 speed chain, which would work on Campy (if it's more serious than that you might be waiting for parts - but you might be waiting for parts in some small town anyway if you're far enough from a shop)."
bicycling,3dxfkt,team_fondue,6,Mon Jul 20 15:36:54 2015 UTC,"The new 5800 105 is really extremely good. It's noticeably better than my 6600 Ultegra and the only thing it lacks over my 7800 Dura ace is the precision in shifting.   But then again the current 9000 spec of DA is 3x more expensive - save your cash get 105, same is true of 6800 Ultegra it's just lighter.  The one caveat I would say if that it only cost a little bit more to get an Ultegra Cassette and Chain - I consider this a worthwhile improvement for little extra cost, same for bottom brackets -- it's only a little more to get DA."

bicycling,3dxfkt,FourthTimeLucky,2,Mon Jul 20 12:18:50 2015 UTC,"Because Campy costs approximately $1M (slight overexaggeration, but only slightly ;) ), making it less preferred for a DD/cross bike. Also, finding parts is more difficult (goes towards the ""light touring"" aspect - any bike shop has Shimano and most will have SRAM - finding Campy is more difficult in general).

Every time I've check-ridden a SRAM-equipped bike, I've downshifted when I meant to upshift and vice versa. Some people absolutely swear by SRAM, and hate the fact that Shimano's brake levers move.  As between 105 and Ultegra - honestly I don't see much of a difference between the two except a slight bit of weight savings in exchange for a heftier price tag on Ultegra. The current 105 is really, really good, IMO."
bicycling,3dxfkt,fierceredpanda,2,Mon Jul 20 12:10:33 2015 UTC,"105 is great, as is SRAM Rival/Force/etc. I'd chose based on your like of the shifters, knowing that anything 105 or Rival level and up will be just fine.  Ensure that your derailleur hanger is straight (checked with a tool, not just by eye), and keep your shifting tuned nicely, and keep your chain appropriately lubed and sufficiently clean and you'll have no problems with any of it."

bicycling,3dxfkt,tL1ght,2,Mon Jul 20 15:14:24 2015 UTC,"The SRAM vs Shimano argument boils down to preference.  There are reasons to run either, I have a long list as to why I prefer SRAM setups - but they mostly boil down to which shift lever you prefer.  The other thing to remember this is a Cyclocross bike.  Mine takes incredible amounts of abuse, gets chocked with mud, raced, crashed.  I run Apex on it and frankly I don't intend to upgrade it - The summer bike runs RED and I'm a big fan.  The reason to run the cheap stuff is replacing breakages. An Apex rear mech is £35. A RED mech is £200....  On a cx bike, racing, offroad riding, crashes, you're going to break things."

SRAM's doubletap shifters are a good concept, but they've broken/snapped on me (my friend's has too) and they've always felt kind of flimsy to me compared to the smooth shimano shifting. Also, I find that on sram bikes you have to apply much more force to both upshift/downshift the front derailleur compared to shimano.  Ultegra gives you a good amount more street cred compared to 105, but really they're basically the same groupset these days. So, you'll be happy with the 105 but go for Ultegra if you have the money."

bicycling,3dwiuq,0_0_7,8,Mon Jul 20 11:27:47 2015 UTC,"To be fair the article is explicitly focused on the industry's response (it is called ""Bicycle Makers Struggle to Swat Down Counterfeits"") to counterfeits that purposefully knockoff Specialized and other large companies products. It talks about how carbon frames are easier to knockoff/counterfeiters are becoming better at knocking off bikes. It is not focused on the relative quality that generic/non-name brand products have vs. name brand bikes. It does of course talk about the relative quality of the knockoffs versus the genuine bikes which it only explicitly cites the industry spokes people and the Velo article.   The main things I took away from the article is one the vast scale/scope that counterfeiting involves, how some companies are moving operations because they don't trust sub-contractors to adequately protect their designs/tooling, etc. and finally because counterfeiting is of course focused on deception, there is no accountability for those products which makes it very likely that they will suffer from a number of quality issues as illustrated in the Velo article.    The Velo News article http://velonews.competitor.com/not-all-frames-are-created-equal-a-look-deep-inside-the-carbon-in-counterfeit-bikes (which I recommend reading) is testing a knockoff not a generic. It would be great if they did a much larger study testing a sufficiently large sample size of name brand bikes, vs knockoffs, vs generics and also test ride quality, etc....but that of course is super expensive.   http://www.cyclingweekly.co.uk/news/latest-news/cheap-chinese-carbon-imports-are-they-worth-the-risk-173977 This article explores the option of buying generic carbon frames from China, and the biggest thing it points out is the risk due to the frequent lack of accountability/recourse when buying the generic bikes. Although it notes that the company interviewed in the article (VeloBuild) stands out as it does provide a 2 year warranty and does some testing (I'm not sure to what extent)."

Until you're hitting nearly 35mph on a compact 50-11 then you still should be hammering the pedals. THEN tuck.  Get in the drops, tuck small. Us little guys are more aero than the big blokes.

bicycling,3dy6wf,defcon-12,3,Mon Jul 20 14:32:13 2015 UTC,"Handling usually changes for the worse with narrow road handlebars when you swap to shortie stems. Ridiculously wide, modern MTB bars make short stems work. Look at even old MTBs when handlebar widths were significantly shorter, and everyone ran long stems. It might work for you, though. Who knows.  One thing I know is that sportier flat bar ""road bikes"" or hybrids often have very similar geometry to road bikes, but with a longer top tube. It's not very cost effective, but you could do a drop bar conversion on some of these. The one main issue is if they use V-brakes, the drop bar levers will not actuate properly."

bicycling,3dy6wf,cyclenaut,2,Mon Jul 20 16:33:09 2015 UTC,"the anyroad actually has a very short top tube for a road bike. Compared to the Giant Defy, which also has a top tube on the short side, the anyroad is even shorter. It's just built with more upright riding position in mind so the stem is not as long as a pure road bike, also the stack height is quite high... none of that translates into anything OP was looking for."
bicycling,3dy6wf,CarrotIronfounderson,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:05:48 2015 UTC,Endourance road bikes or more entry level tend to have longer top tubes and shorter stems. The more aggressive the geometry the shorter the top tube and longer then stem I think on average.
bicycling,3dy6wf,er-day,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:03:45 2015 UTC,"One thing to do is embrace the differences between the different bike styles.  They wound up where they are in order to optimize for the different environments they are ridden in.  A longer stem moves your weight over your front tire, which makes for better handling at speed / descents on asphalt, etc."
bicycling,3dy6wf,pdub99,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:31:30 2015 UTC,"this thing would handle sooo much better if it had a reasonably sized TT   It would not. Road bike geometry is a result of needs associated with tarmac riding. A long top tube short stem road bike would create a rear heavy road bike that would wipe out in corners. You need that weight on the front wheel to get grip on it.  Secondly pushing the bars more forward gives you a slower handling. Combined with a steeper headtube angle you get good weight distribution, quick handling when you need it and most importantly, slow steering when you need it. On the road most of the time is spent going in a straight line so it's preferrable that a bike doesn't squirrel all over the Place all the time. That kind of stuff saps your energy real quick."
bicycling,3dy6wf,theactualTRex,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:53:31 2015 UTC,"Secondly pushing the bars more forward gives you a slower handling   That's what I want. Road bikes are unnecessarily twitchy. I mean, you ride them in an almost straight line. There aren't obstacles to avoid like on an mtb. Slacking the bike out would make it a lot calmer handling at speed.  Long top tube, short stem mtbs perform better at higher speed and are more stable than short top tube, long stem mtbs, which are more typically used for low speed applications."
bicycling,3dy6wf,theactualTRex,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:06:24 2015 UTC,"A drop bar with a short stem is not going to be stable even with a slack headtube. And you'll still fuck up the weight distribution so you'll have no real cornering capability. The reason MTB's don't wipe out with slack angles and a short stem is due to the attack position where you purposefully move yourself forward and add weight to the front wheel. I guess you could do that with a road bike but... We'll it just wouldn't work. Not enough stability to hold grip.  Believe me, mtb folk would take steeper headtube angles if they could. However due to several reason's slack angles are required, especially in suspension bikes, although full squish bikes tend to have steeper angles in the same suspension range. Since the slack angles made MTB steering way too slow short stems and wide bars were introduced. Even MTB'ers want faster steering.  If you don't want a twitchy road bike get a cyclocross, rando bike or a tourer. You get pretty much the same general angles with longer chainstays and more fork rake. I prefer my CX to road bikes due to it being more stable, even though it's quick enough handling not to be a train."
bicycling,3dy6wf,kimbo305,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:34:03 2015 UTC,"If you don't mind a higher head tube, just find a road frame with a short actual seat tube, like an Allez, and buy one or even two sizes up.   Under a certain length, handling will get twitchy because the stem is so short for the effective width of the bars. 70mm might work, but 50 would be so short."
bicycling,3dy6wf,MTFUandPedal,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:02:56 2015 UTC,"At one point I was trying to run a bike slightly too big for me (before I learned about fit, geo etc) and ended up with a 70mm stem.  This made the bike hellish twitchy at low speeds.  I've got the same bike in the next size down at the moment, and frankly it's composed, darty but definitely not twitchy or uncontrolled.  The difference between a 70mm stem and a 90mm can be huge on handling...."

Internal cable on the top tube uses a sleeve inside but the exit holes are exactly the side of a cable. When the sleeve breaks you have to try fishing a 1.2mm cable through a 1.4mm hole. The boss for the cable end also has a lip inside so you can't just slide the cable down the inside of the frame as it will catch and get pushed to the side.  We had one mechanic hold the frame sideways and downwards while another used a cow magnet on the outside of the frame to help guide the cable in place.

Both those bikes are comparable. You got a bit of an upgrade, but nothing crazy and saved $290. I think they could have given you a better deal since they are more inclined to move their 2015 stock with the 2016's rolling in.

If you say ""I've heard a lot about the Emonda, but I don't know that I want to spend that much,"" they're much more likely to cut a deal.   Also, it's not quite that time of year.

The 26 inches refers to the external diameter with a 1.75"" width tire fitted, for stupid obsolete reasons.  If your new tires are several inches off and you can pass the rim through without touching the tires, I would think you must have bought the wrong size tires and tubes.

bicycling,3dwf8j,Divisible-by-zero,4,Mon Jul 20 13:34:59 2015 UTC,"You can safely go at least 10psi above the max pressure on the tires, but the most effective way to avoid pinch flats on the road, where you don't have the kind of rocky obstacles that mountain bikers do, is to ride ""light"". When you see a bump or a rough patch, stand up and let your arms absorb most of the blow so the tires don't have to. If you don't have enough time to do that, just shift your weight forward, since the front wheel does not support as much weight as does the rear wheel. Since you're riding on the road you don't run as much risk of going over the handlebars so you can load your front wheel a little more."

bicycling,3dwf8j,howmanydads,4,Mon Jul 20 11:55:41 2015 UTC,"Check on your tires for the max PSI rating, and pump them up to the hilt. The heavier you are, the higher you want your pressure, to avoid pinch flats.  And congrats! I do a 6 mile commute myself, and that plus some club riding has killed about thirty pounds in one year. When you get comfier with longer rides, check out the Portland Wheelmen. Club riding is a great way to get some fun miles in."

bicycling,3dwf8j,howmanydads,3,Mon Jul 20 11:59:49 2015 UTC,"it all depends on your tire width really, i run my 23's at 110 PSI and i weigh about 170 (and i can feel every bit of road with that!) so you can probably run the same if you have that width tire. now if you have a tire width of 25 then a lower pressure can be used, but even then you could probably still run them 90-100 PSI.   Edit: just go to your LBS and see what they recommend, it will be easier to ask a person in person, plus they will most likely be more than helpful!"

bicycling,3dwf8j,SavingHawaii,2,Mon Jul 20 12:01:50 2015 UTC,"If you're willing to do some basic arithmetic, this chart by Bicycling Quarterly shows ideal pressures based on weight (per wheel) and tire width.  Note of course, that the pressures in the chart aren't definitive, but rather a good starting point to adjust from. Also, as you can see, mounting a wider tire will let you run a lower pressure; it may be worth trying to fit a 28mm or wider tire on your bike."
bicycling,3dwf8j,Boston_Pops,2,Mon Jul 20 05:04:17 2015 UTC,"For weights >100Kg, that chart suggests pumping tyres (at least ones I own) to around twice the maximum pressure given on the sidewall!"
bicycling,3dwf8j,brainlag2,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:39:53 2015 UTC,"Yep, keep in mind that the weight in the table is the weight at each wheel. So for a 100kg rider, you'd be at around 110kg for rider+bike, and see maybe 50kg on the F wheel, 60kg on the rear. For those weights on 25mm tires, the chart would suggest 100psi F, 120psi R, which are reasonable amounts.  Unfortunately as the rider and bike weight pushes upwards of 120kg, it gets harder to find tires that are rated for the necessary pressure. That's why I suggested the OP consider a wider tire, he can keep it within spec and it should improve comfort."

bicycling,3du4hp,mapin,2,Mon Jul 20 01:13:18 2015 UTC,"Touring bikes are generally built to be ridden with much more gear. This leads them to being built more with strength and stability in mind, which deadens the ride quality and doesn't have that road bike ""racy"" feeling. Rando bikes are somewhere in between. They are often built to where they actually feel like they handle BETTER with a front load, compared to unladen."

In effect, they fill about the same niche, but go about it in slightly different ways. Ways which might often be impossible to tell just by eyeballing them. But, traditionally a Randonneur bike is built to handle very sportily with a front load only, and wider tires. Often with smaller wheelsizes like 650b. ""light tourer"" is more broad, and probably technically encompasses Rando bikes, but they are generally more americanized and will utilize a rear rack/panniers for their main hauling. In effect, many road bikes that have rack mounts can fall into this niche if you outfit it that way."

It has a chromed end, but it might be that the rake, or the bend, is more pronounced than modern bikes. The rake contributes to a trail which is more on the high-end of ""low trail"" or the low-end of ""mid-trail"".

""Real"" Randonneur-frames are hard to come by, and I couldn't afford one - but I dream of a frame with a more road-like geometry but elongated chain stays to accommodate my saddle bags.  Apart from that, the bike is great - I bought it in October 2014, and it has carried me loyally for 8000km/5000mi.

bicycling,3dw6fk,edlaz,6,Mon Jul 20 01:11:19 2015 UTC,"Thru axles will almost certainly be the future for disc brake equipped bikes. The question is though: which type of thru axle? Currently road bikes come with either 12x100 or 15x100 thru axles. There's also 15x110 ""boost"" style, 20x110 which is found on DH bikes, and a couple more fat bike sizes that escape me at the moment. Out of all of those, 15x100 is by far the most common (I'd say 95% of mtb and 90% of CX bikes with thru axles run it), so it'd be really nice if we could settle on that. Fortunately, 12x100 and 15x100 only requires an endcap swap on the hubs, so it shouldn't be too bad if we're going to have those two standards."
bicycling,3dw6fk,TeKnOShEeP,6,Mon Jul 20 02:23:25 2015 UTC,"9mm QR skewers aren't going to go completely away for a long, long time. Particularly on sub $600 bikes and given that there are so many bikes that have skewers already you're going to be able to find them for a long, long time.  I mean, consider that you can go into practically any bike shop and buy a 7sp freewheel - technology that is what, 30 years out of date?   it's often been a pain to set the skewers up right without brake rub.   The trick there is learning to pull the wheels completely into the dropouts, if you practice that there isn't really much of an adjustment advantage with a thru-axle. That being said, a thru-axle makes aligning it a bit easier, but I still don't find it much of a big deal.  There are a fair number of thru-axle standards floating around, and I doubt there is going to be a settled ""standard"" in the next 15 years."

Are you sure your rotors aren't warped or your brake caliper is misaligned?  I suspect TA will stick around, but what standard is the question.  But QR will be around for a long time - it works on everything from a lightweight road bike to a heavily loaded tandem.  As long as something is common enough at one time, it tends to stick around as replacement parts for a long time.  Just avoid bleeding-edge stuff - if it it only existed on the fringe for a year or two, it can be forgotten about."

The bike is spec'd identically to the Giant Defy Advanced Pro 0 (i.e. with Ultegra Di2 and R785 hydraulic disc brakes), but has the red paint scheme of the Pro 1.   The bike came with the Fizik Aliante saddle but it was, shall we say, putting way too much pressure on sensitive areas and was uncomfortable for me for most any distance. What you see on there now is the Specialized Toupe test saddle from the LBS. I've done a couple of long rides with no discomfort whatsoever; great saddle and mine's on order.

bicycling,3duf7e,ADHD-PI,11,Sun Jul 19 16:07:48 2015 UTC,"I just finished my first ever real cycle commute test thing. The following story happened about two weeks ago.  So after much consideration and many months of wasted gym membership, I decided I was going to get a bike and start commuting to work. Great idea right? It'll save me money and help get me fitter!   So, my first task was to choose a bike. Pretty simple, just spend two months researching absolutely everything I possibly can about bikes (thus prolonging the purchase by two months...). This actually didn't end too badly - I got a Cannondale Synapse 105 with disc brakes, the bike I felt fit best my requirements and had the best value for money (please let me know how wrong I am). I'm using the Ride-to-work scheme, so I actually get 42% off, which is why I picked a bike that would get the biggest discount (it caps at £1000)  Before I bought it, I was able to take it on a 30 minute test run to make sure I was comfortable on it. I decided to leave my bag and other stuff at the store while testing the bike, so that I wouldn't have to carry my shit around. FIRST MISTAKE. I left my phone in that bag and managed to get horribly lost cycling around central London. I couldn't actually find my way back to the cycle store and ended up spending over an hour cycling in circles convinced I was nearly there. It turns out that I was actually really really close to it but one road over. SECOND MISTAKE was that I didn't actually ask how the bike worked before I started riding it. I've only ever used a bike with gears controlled by twisting the handle bars, and that was a loooong time ago. I've never ridden a bike in Central London (I don't even drive...) and I had no idea how to change gears. Somehow I got it into my head that pressing the left gear shift thing would shift in one direction, and the right one would shift the gear in the other direction. So, I'm sitting, lost in London horribly confused as to why my bike isn't changing gear and why it's so bloody hard to pedal. Eh, whatever, I'll work it out later. So I went around for over an hour completely lost in the hardest gear - brilliant!   Eventually I found my way back to the bike store... and still didn't ask about the gears. I bought the bike as well as some locks and accessories and waited for an hour for them to attach them. This all went smoothly. I then proceeded to cycle around to try to get to my office since it was pretty close to the bike store. I thought I'd be smart this time and use my phone to navigate... THIRD MISTAKE... the phone died shortly after leaving the bike shop. I cycled around trying to find something I recognise (still stuck in the hardest gear...) and eventually ended up on Regent's Street - hurrah! Somewhere I recognise! I cycled to work and used my key card to get in to the bike storage place. I went upstairs and spent about an hour recovering (asthma, woo!) and watching YouTube videos on how to actually change gears. It turns out the brakes are actually also gear shit levers - genius! I then cycled home with only minimal lost-ness.  So I then went to work as usual by bus, because I'm terrified of actually commuting to work on my bike because of all the horror stories about cycling in London. I got to work and asked the office administrator for a key to the a locker in the shower room (my office has SHOWERS AND LOCKERS FOR CYCLISTS - HOW COOL IS THAT?) and it just so happens that there was a single spare locker - hurrah! I continued my day as usual and went home, keen to cycle to work the next day. The next morning I'm ready with my bike and whatnot and about to head out when I realize that I HAVE LOST THE BLOODY KEY! How the hell did I manage to lose the key in under 24 hours? FOURTH MISTAKE. Admittedly it was on a very flimsy keychain. The key must have fallen off some time through the day. So of course I just get the bus to work as usual and I'm too embarrassed to ask for a new one, as I know those keys are rare and I must look like a right tit for losing it already. A week goes by and I still can't find the key. Eventually I man up and tell the office administrator that I've lost it, she laughs and we organise them to cut a new one, at my expense. Brilliant, more money. This will of course take a few days so I continue taking the bus for a while. Two days ago, I'm walking home from the bus stop and I happen to look down... a key? I pick it up... holy shit, it's the key I lost a week ago!   I took the key home and decided that I'd do a dry run of my commute on Saturday (yesterday)... but of course I got distracted by video games and ended up missing the timeframe that I'd be able to do it (I had evening plans). Today I'm packing my bag to do the actual test run and I realise HOLY SHIT I LEFT THE LOCK AT THE BIKE SHOP TWO WEEKS AGO. SECOND-AND-A-HALFTH MISTAKE? Now I have to go back to the bike shop and say ""oh by the way I bought some locks here two weeks ago and I forgot to actually take them with me..."" actually I think I'll just buy new ones... it'll be easier.  So, I've just completed my first ever test commute to work - I'm writing this at the office right now, all sweaty and tired, but it was great. I got horribly lost (because clearly I shouldn't be trusted with navigation...).  All in all, it's been good, and I look forward to my journey home and many future commutes by bike, hopefully with less fucking up. I really must say my true first big mistake, and the one I regret the most, is that I didn't do all of this a year ago.  TL;DR: Got a bike, didn't know how to change gears, got lost, lost the key to my locker, left the locks at the bike shop and didn't notice for two weeks, got lost again, and wished I had done all of this a year ago."

I've always thought lighter is better when it comes to steel, as long as it isn't so thin that it is easily dinged. Of course, if you are racing, that's another story, but I digress. I've ridden hi-ten, all types of butted cr-mo, 853, and now I'm about to build up a bike from a LeMond Platinum OX frame. While I was researching about the material, I came across the Henry James site. It seems that they own True Temper? Anyway, the page I linked shows tubing-kits that are built around rider weight. I seem to fall above all weight ranges for their road kits. I am closest to their ""double o/s road,"" but I am still about 15lbs over their suggested range. Interestingly enough, as the weight range increases, it seems that they use their heat-treated offerings more than the heat-treated and air-hardened. So at my weight, should I really be looking for something a little heavier than OX Plat?"

A regular guy - even a an amateur racer - isn't losing enough watts to frame flex for it to matter very much.   At the same time, if your frame is so stiff that it's like riding a jackhammer, that fatigue is real and will slow you down."

You should be able to make some money back too by selling the brakes. Not much but enough for beers.   Also if you're planning for fat tires the Surly Knards work really well. Cheap and easy to get.  Soma has a couple cubby tires as well but I really like the knards. WTB Nanos are great but have more tread. Roll well though. If you're planning on running the Bruce Gordon's rock n road you'll have to run the wheel at the back of the drop out. The extra mm can rub.
bicycling,3duqyj,imjusthereforab,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:11:37 2015 UTC,"Here's a google doc I made up that organizes and categorizes different bike components, making it easy to build a build! I used something similar when I built up my Surly LHT, and it was seriously handy.   So what's your budget looking like, and what would you change from the stock Space Horse build? Silver components instead of black? New Wheels? Classic-looking double cranksets are very easy to come by, Velo-Orange and Soma Fab's offerings come to mind. J  Just a fair warning, it's incredibly expensive cost prohibitive to build up a complete from scratch. I did it once and unless I'm working at a bike shop an can get some kind of a discount, I don't think I'm ever going to do that again. It IS very fun though if you have the means to do it!"

bicycling,3duqyj,Divisible-by-zero,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:18:51 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the doc! I would say that my budget with everything would be 2k. That is after a brooks saddle, nice rack, hopefully some bags (that may be a streach) etc...  I think that I would be happy with anything that is not the tiagra that comes with the complete build.  I may end up going an all silver classy route, or I may end up going the black modern racy stuff. I have a feeling that I can find better deals on the latter."
bicycling,3duqyj,FalseBuddha,2,Sun Jul 19 22:31:32 2015 UTC,"For 2K you can have a really nice build, your most expensive components being the frame and the wheels. If you can get both of those for around or under $1,000, then you'll be sitting pretty on getting it in under your budget. After that your bags and brooks will be your next expensive items, followed by your crankset and rack, then your derailleurs, and so on and so forth. I really like Universal Cycles for their huge catalog of items (it's basically like looking at the QBP product catalog, who is parent company of brands like All City, Surly, and Salsa, and a huge distributor of bike parts), but better deals can usually be found elsewhere. I will say, don't be afraid to go generic with some of the basic stuff, like your stem and seatpost. Also, check out r/bikeshop periodically to see what fellow redditors have for sale!"
bicycling,3duqyj,Not_in_Nottingham,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:17:13 2015 UTC,"What isn't mentioned here is whether or not building your bike means just choosing all the components or assembling it yourself as well. If you are new to this, it's not unreasonable to assume that you probably don't have a few of the things that I would consider absolutely essential to doing an excellent job. Mainly, I imagine you may not have the tools to install bottom brackets and headsets. Sure, a shop can do that for you, and many people who build bikes will buy a bb tool and pay a shop to put in a headset, but there are also things like a torque wrench and a bench grinder that I couldn't imagine building a bike without these days. Sure, there are probably some amazing bikes out there that have been built without these tools but if you're investing so much in the bike, you'll want each job done right. Bottom line, tools are expensive and so is shop labor. Budget accordingly."

bicycling,3dr7e2,KIAA0319,9,Sat Jul 18 21:15:37 2015 UTC,My god I'd love di2 on my tendem.  Gear cable stretch is a fucker on tandems.     Nb: rim brakes vs discs is a major sticking point in tandem design.  Rims are generally better for control (you effectively have a 622 mm rotor) but run the risk of tyre damage on long or hard braking so rear discs work well for drag brakes.
bicycling,3dr7e2,Tandemaniac,5,Sat Jul 18 22:23:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the couple I know with a Santana have a V brake up front and a disc brake with a giant rotor for the rear."
bicycling,3dr7e2,KIAA0319,2,Sat Jul 18 22:36:31 2015 UTC,We ride with captain controlling the V's and the stoker controls a 203 mm rear disc.  Works well on long descents as the 203 gets burning hot - a hot disc is a pain as its liable to warping but at least its not the rim and risks blowing out the tyre.  Rule of thumb is that doubling the rider mass requires quadrupling the brake force.  I may consider a front disc on the next tandem but only with a tandem specific front fork (braking forces bend and snap normal disc forks).
bicycling,3dr7e2,Tandemaniac,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:09:22 2015 UTC,"We have saint brakes on our tandem with 203 ice tech rotors. The brakes still get crazy hot, but they actually work and that's a wonderful thng. The power difference between a v-brake (on our old tandem) and 4 piston disc (current tandem) isn't evn in the same ballpark. We ride a lot faster on th descents now because I'm more confident in our ability to stop.   ive gotten the brakes hot enough that they smoked. Braking performance definitely was reduced for th rest of the ride, but the rotors were fine and I just replaced the pads when I got home."
bicycling,3dr7e2,Nordok,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:41:13 2015 UTC,"We have saint brakes on our tandem with 203 ice tech rotors.   At the moment some of the new tech out and around is a bit out of our budget for what we do, but the new hydro STI's and di2 control looks just too good for tandeming.  We use 105 (3x10) on drop bars for fast touring, sportive and so on.  Our biggest mechanical problems are cable stretch.  Di2 would be a godsend to remove the over 3 meters of cable between my fingers and the rear mech and hydros would remove the cable squish under hard braking.  How do you find the Icetech rotors?  We're using good but cheap 203's.  At £5 to £10 per rotor we see them almost as a disposable.  We're not heavy on drag use around here, but if we do over heat one and warp it, it's easy enough to chuck and replace.  I have been looking at the Icetech stuff, but haven't jumped for them.....yet....."
bicycling,3dr7e2,KIAA0319,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:06:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I feel you on the di2. We'd love to equip our tandem with it, even with an xtr rear mech the shifting is sub par.    So far so good with the ice tech rotors.  We've heated the brakes up until the pads smoked and burned the disc, but the rotors stayed straight."
bicycling,3dr7e2,Nordok,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:37:52 2015 UTC,So are tandems faster? Or I should rephrase what does it take for a tandem to be faster/in what ways is it faster? More aero? More power? Similar power/weight ratio?
bicycling,3dr7e2,KIAA0319,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:17:26 2015 UTC,"Mixed.  Different teams will have different strengths, but based on Strava,    My wife and I are faster on the flat with our fast touring tandem than I am a solo racing bike.  I'm by far the stronger rider but once you take into account the extra power of two people with hardly any increase in frontal area, it's not surprising quicker by around 3-5kph on an even road.  We also find that the style of riding is very different - we spend a lot of time on the saddle doing long power periods as getting out of the saddle is difficult.  Those longer power periods are more efficient as we cover for each others idle times (one has a micro-rest and soft pedals while the other is still going full gas and vice-versa) to give a far higher net power output over long periods We can descend straight and open winding course a lot quicker than anyone on a solo - hence the drag brake. Our climbing is improving, but technical climbs are hard.  Long gentle 5-10% climbs we power up easier but the 25% with hairpins kill our speed. Our endurance over long distance is far better.  We'll ride a 100 miler.  From feel, I'd guess I'd save around a third of the energy I would have spent if I did the same course at the same speed on a solo.  If it's just us (and not riding with others or in a group), our average pace can be much higher than the equivalent solo effort over a 100 mile course."

bicycling,3dr7e2,apdicaprio,2,Sat Jul 18 20:43:38 2015 UTC,"I was thinking about that too,   but my inclination was to add one more tube and truss the frame out completely. I believe the problem with either of these ideas lies with the placement of the frame couplers. If you want to truss it out you really must make your trusses terminate directly at the BB junctions, having a truss that terminates 6 inches from the bb junction puts a large stress concentration in the short tube between the end of the tube and the BB junction. And if you did truss it out further, that would mean you now need either 1 or 2 more frame couplers which then become a nightmare for trying the break the bike down and put it back together. Aligning 3 separate slip joints simultaneously may well be impossible if not just quite difficult, let alone 4."

bicycling,3durdf,severed_survival,3,Sun Jul 19 17:53:45 2015 UTC,"when I was younger and didn't give a fuck I'd take a monkey wrench, place it over the fat part of the dent and pull it back into position. (you'll want to place a couple thin pieces of wood or even cloth between the wrench and rim to keep the rim from getting marred.) I kept riding it for a few years without a problem. however, your rim will never be the same. that dent will never completely come out and it will never be as true.  a rim dent will cause rough braking and undue stress on the tire's casing/bead. so, if you're in a bind fix it temporarily by bending it back. otherwise get a new rim."
bicycling,3durdf,npmruser,2,Sun Jul 19 18:26:00 2015 UTC,It would be better if you took the tire and tube off to show us; I wouldn't freak about about something minimal like that though.

bicycling,3dv9mu,dirtisgood,2,Mon Jul 20 00:09:01 2015 UTC,"ahhh,  When I did my bike, I had a bike stand which makes it easier.   If I remember, this is the order I did it in:   1 seat / tube (so bike can be attached to bike stand.   2 headset   3  fork / handle bars / brake, shifter levers  4 bottom bracket / crank / pedals   (remember one side is reversed  - i think right side.  the pedals should be marked)  5 front / rear derailleurs / wheels  chain   6 brakes   7 cables for brakes / derailleurs   8 adjust everything and then tape the handlebars.   I think that is it.  Does that help?     Get new cables and housing, brake pads and bar tape. Jagwire cables are good.   New chain if your chain ring/cassettes are in good shape.     for the headset you can get a big threaded bar with nuts and washers and use this as a head set press.  The bottom bracket you probably will need a tool.     Everything should have either loctite, anti-seize or grease on it."
bicycling,3dtxf3,workerbotsuperhero,2,Sun Jul 19 12:51:15 2015 UTC,"Wow, didn't actually know this:   Bicycles also gave birth to our national highway system, as cyclists outside major cities grew weary of rutted mud paths and began lobbying for the construction of paved roads. The car connection goes further still: Many of the bicycle repair shops that sprang up to service the wheeling masses were later converted to automobile filling stations, and a number of pioneers in the auto industry, including Henry Ford and Charles Duryea, started out as bicycle mechanics. So, too, did the Wright brothers.   And this is so apt:    Mr. Sebastian said bicycle crashes were rising with ridership, which is why he and others are pushing for solutions like dedicated bike lanes, physically separated from car traffic, so people can bike to work without regrets. And live."

In fact, I bought my first road bike just to do it about four months before so it's eminently doable for someone who's not done much distance cycling. Before that the furthest I'd done in a day was 50 miles.  It was a fantastic - but very tough - experience which, for me, was only doable because there was so much support. That meant I could just worry about riding the bike.  I haven't got any stand out piece of advice but I'm happy to answer questions."

The portion in the UK isn't so nice, besides down closer to the coast, but when you get into France it's bike touring heaven - rolling French hills, one historic village to the next. The boulangeries along the way make for a wonderful positive-calorie ride.  The climbing is manageable (400-1000m per day), and I found it to be fine even though looking back I was in awful shape then. Do it self supported and camp / stay in a gite, it's well worth it.

Could be.  The more weight you apply over the rear wheel, the more grip it will get and the harder it will be to lock up. If you want to lock it up when stopping then you are doing it wrong, you don't want to lock up the wheel. If you want to lock up the wheel to look rad whilst going round corners or stopping whilst swinging the bike sideways then you want to shift your weight forward a bit first. Practise on some open grass."
bicycling,3dvh8t,-rwsr-xr-x,3,Sun Jul 19 22:02:15 2015 UTC,"Why in any sane world, would ""locking up the rear wheel"" be something you feel you need to achieve?   The goal is to have controlled braking, not lockups or doing burnouts and skid lines in the road. Or is it?   Do the brakes work? Do they allow you to correctly stop the bike in all sorts of conditions and weather? If so, then I wouldn't worry about it."
bicycling,3dvh8t,giantnakedrei,4,Sun Jul 19 22:02:07 2015 UTC,"(Not OP) On the road that's great, but on a trail locking up the brakes is a part of some navigational maneuvers like drifting."

bicycling,3dvh8t,DarkwolfAU,2,Mon Jul 20 12:57:49 2015 UTC,"Why do you think you need to lock up the back wheel?  That's something you shouldn't be aiming to do.  Once a wheel locks, its braking effectiveness drops dramatically, and rear wheels are easy to lock up anyway (due to weight shifting forwards when braking).  If you want to be checking braking effectiveness, it's much more important to be looking at your braking distance, and using the front brakes for that.  It's a lot harder to lock a front wheel due to weight shifting forwards onto the wheel."
bicycling,3dvh8t,ausstieglinks,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:06:17 2015 UTC,"so on my mountain bike, I was able to lock up the rear wheel on pavement and gravel easily with the tyres included with the bike (2.25"" Schwalbe Rocket Ron) but as soon as I replaced them with a nicer tire (2.35"" Schwalbe Hans Dampf) I can no longer lock it up, even on loose gravel.  Like others, I'm not sure why you'd explicitly want to lock it up though..."

But you can always check out different options at a bikeshop without having to buy anything (you can try them out in front of the shop) the cracks should be alright. Its because the rubber is old and dry, but if you don't have the money right now there is no need to replace them chain: you have to make sure that the chain doesn't touch the derailleur. there are small screws that are used to adjust the width of movement as well as the angle of the derailleur...this is probably your problem at the front sprockets. You also need to obey some simple rules while switching gears: The chain should never run from the biggest front sprocket to the biggest back sprocket; and obviously should also never run from the smallest front sprocket to the smallest back sprocket"

bicycling,3duffg,BYDO1612,2,Sun Jul 19 16:35:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you should be able to figure it out on your own. You can see how the angle of the derailleur changes when adjusting the screws. But if you cannot get it right just visit a decent (that is family owned) bikeshop and tell them you tried but could not do it. If it is really only a matter of adjusting the derailleur (which is what I am guessing) it is a minor issue and they should be able to help you within minutes (and for free)."

bicycling,3dtzbu,MK_Ultrex,0,Sun Jul 19 19:35:00 2015 UTC,"Honestly I don't think it matters what people race on. Your bike is likely to be faster than you for a good while anyway.  I fancy some carbon wheels myself they'll look great on my bike but they won't make me a better rider.   Personally I'd spend my money on good cycling gear. It's amazing the negative impact shitty, ill-fitting gear has when you're riding distances at a good clip. I learnt that very quickly when I switched from mountain-biking and BMX to road riding."

Anyway, unless the guy is descending mountains with heavy braking, carbon clinchers will be much faster, especially since these are his race wheels."
bicycling,3dtzbu,Flacvest,0,Sun Jul 19 20:51:08 2015 UTC,Carbon clinchers on descents are dangerous.   Maybe in 2003.  Tech has improved significantly.  Many many folks race on carbon clinchers without issue.

bicycling,3dqkd3,nhluhr,2,Sun Jul 19 02:19:47 2015 UTC,Are the pedals supposed to be synchronized like that? I would have thought it should be opposite.
bicycling,3dqkd3,mc_ha_ha_hales_ale,12,Sat Jul 18 19:24:56 2015 UTC,Cranks on tandem bikes typically rotate independently   Exactly the opposite - cranks on a tandem are linked by a single loop of chain meaning they are locked rotationally. It's also standard practice to set up both cranks to the same position - it's handy for going around corners and not striking the ground...
bicycling,3dqkd3,sjgw137,2,Sat Jul 18 19:32:05 2015 UTC,Setting them up 90* offset makes launching a little easier though. We experimented a bit and found clocking the pedals 90* out of sync the most comfortable for launching and smooth surface riding. Having the pedals in sync is what we have now though because it's much more comfortable for city riding when you have to occasionally get your ass off the saddle. Tried 180* as well and it's just weird with no benefit.

Captain up front and then the blind person as the stoker.  One of our captains says he's smacked aero bars on the front of his tandem. I thought he was crazy but his explanation was astounding. He said they're there so that he can go down in the drops and the blind person in the back can feel the wind rushing on their face & take in as much of the full un-adultered cycling experience as possible. Such a great thing.

bicycling,3dqwd1,Tandemaniac,0,Sun Jul 19 03:19:46 2015 UTC,"I love steel bikes, and think surly is a really cool brand, but I'm not a big fan of their bikes and I think it's for the same reason as that other guy.   The surly mtb's I've ridden (admittedly not many) all had very dated geometry. Long chainstays, shortish top tubes, long stems, and high stand over.  There's nothing ""wrong"" with this, some people (not many) prefer it. More modern steel bikes, like my Transition TransAm have pretty much the opposite of what i just said (short chainstays, long top tube, short stem, low stand over).   Bikes with more modern geometry usually have a ""livelier"" feel to them. They're better at speed, much better in the air, and have more control over rough stuff. MTB's with old school geometry ride more like touring bikes, which as pleasant as they are, they're not exactly ideal for mountain biking.   No disrespect to surly, if more bike companies had their ethos I think biking would be more fun. But their bikes, from my limited experience, just aren't my cup of tea."

Most Surly framesets cost around $450. That's around $200 more than the cheapest ones I see online. For those $200 you get much better quality control, better welds, better steel, better design and geo, better everything. I don't see how a $200 premium for that is 'overpriced'."

bicycling,3dtsr4,Taomach,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:58:11 2015 UTC,Switching gears requires great accuracy and involves many components that can break or become misadjusted. Check all the components and find out what the issue is.  Possibly there is mechanical damage - something could be bent near the derailer. Possibly the cables are rusted into their housing and both the cables and housings need to be replaced. Possibly the indexing has gotten off-target and just needs to be fine-tuned. Possibly some chainlinks are rusted solid and are causing erratic behavior.
bicycling,3dtsr4,gufdon-upon-labur,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:43:35 2015 UTC,"Probably cable tension, have barrel adjusters? Tweak those.

bicycling,3dtsr4,Curun,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:46:57 2015 UTC,One thing to check is whether your chain is well-lubricated and kink-free. A stiff chain can cause all sorts of random shifting problems.  Slowly turn the pedals backwards while you watch the chain from the side: it should all be level and even. Any kinks? Stiff links? Lubricate them and work the chain manually (twist and flex - you can do it while it's on the bike).

bicycling,3ds39e,digitalliquid,4,Sun Jul 19 01:53:15 2015 UTC,I wouldn't even waste your time on purchasing tires for it. It doesn't fit you and it will be very uncomfortable. Maybe sell it to someone bigger on cl and put the money towards a better fitting bike.

bicycling,3dp276,Slipping_Tire,40,Sat Jul 18 11:41:49 2015 UTC,"Group riding. With a tri bike (unless you have some Di2 DA groupos) you have the option to shit or break, not both (shifters are on the tri bars, breaks are on the bullhorns). This makes the ebb and flow of group riding difficult and dangerous.   Tri bikes also do not typically corner as well as road bikes. This leads to massive deceleration before and during a turn which can cause accidents or at least break up the group.   Finally, in that aero tuck, there isn't much of a slip stream to be had for people behind the Tri guy. Because of this, you generally see them being pulled all day and then they get a turn on the front and drop everyone because they give no aero advantage to the people behind them.   Oh wait, one more - hills. Tri bikes are designed for flat speed. Hills generally result in a breakup of the group or a much slower ride when there is a Tri bike present.   Please note I used terms like generally and typically. This is not indicative of ALL Tri guys, just the gross majority.   Plus they look goofy in sleeveless skinsuits :)  Edit: leaving the typo. Because pick a sport!"

bicycling,3dp276,Giraffe_Racer,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:35:48 2015 UTC,"1) I like to train as I race, but I am not so rich as to be able to use that gear day in and day out.   1a) If a given piece of equipment adds, say, a 5w advantage, I want to have that accounted for in my FTP result.   2) While speed is not a metric I care about training session to training session, I am curious about it, and on the same course in similar conditions enjoy seeing myself getting faster as the months and years pass.   EDIT: This predicated on my laymen's understanding of aerodynamics being something like this: A rider does a test. She comes out with 200w. That rider now adds an aero helmet with a 10w savings (for ease of the example, we'll disregard every possible variable that could impact the advantage and just assume it). She can now get the same resultant output while pushing 190w instead of 200. But, if she pushes makes her power meter read 200 anyway, there will have been a savings from the 10w helmet, and being more aerodynamic will have made her go faster. In other words, for pushing 200 through the cranks, she gets a result as if she were pushing 210.  If I'm wrong, I'd like to know. Whatever anyone does from reading this, don't assume I'm right."

New drivers are absolutely the cause of more accidents. But no one says to get them off the road; rather, we all know they just need more practice. In other words, triathletes spend less overall fitness time on the bike than roadies, and way less time in a paceline, so of course their skills will be lesser compared to their strength.  I don't see them kicking roadies out of the pool because they don't know the etiquette of circle swimming."

No triathlete is going to give you shit for not shaving your legs, wearing a mismatched kit, or getting drip coffee instead of espresso. Cyclists can be assholes about stupid minutia that's not even related to riding bicycles.  I have no doubt there are plenty of douches in both. My experience is mostly at the college level, and much of the triathlete demographic is rich older white men, who I can see being terrible customers.

bicycling,3dsv9c,Taomach,2,Sun Jul 19 06:57:45 2015 UTC,"Road specific pedals are typically lower profile (for aerodynamics and for pedaling through corners), lighter weight, and have a larger contact area. The larger contact area is ostensibly for better power transfer, but also helps at reducing hot spots on the foot, and provides a more stable platform for out of the saddle climbing and sprinting.   It's not that SPDs are worse for road than they are for MTB or that they're not good enough for a road bike. Just that there are things about road pedals that make me prefer to use them on my road bike, and keep the SPDs for the cross bike."
bicycling,3dsv9c,Kazyole,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:54:51 2015 UTC,"SPD-SL has larger contact area to pedal, so if one is using cheap(less stiff) shoes, hotspots are less likely to be a problem. With my cheap SPD commuting shoes I can slightly feel the cleat area flex when putting power down, but with my SPD-SL I've never really felt the flexing, even with bit cheaper shoes. Its not a huge difference, and can be fixed with shoes that have good stiff soles, but it is there. Cleat size matters in MTB, not really on the road."

If you can't find a shoe that has the bolt pattern (four hole) for it, you have to use an adapter, which adds stack height to the cleat. But even with the greater stack height, there are advantages. IMO it does the job of spd-sl much better, and it's not so bad to walk in. It has the rigidity to be a road bike pedal, and the comfort to be a really good commuter. Plus they're way easier to clip into, but you won't accidentally clip out (don't know if it's just me, or that my spd pedals/cleats were broken, but I'd clip out randomly sometimes.)"

bicycling,3dqk29,jbisinla,3,Sat Jul 18 20:20:02 2015 UTC,"Well, I had a 1990 Schwinn Prelude years ago, and I sold it through my cousin's used bike shop to help him get his off the ground- I made a pittance (a mere $30 profit, bleh), after I'd fallen in love with the bike. I've been searching for one ever since.  Schwinn Bicycle Co., upgraded the Schwinn Prelude incrementally over the years- the 1990 one I had included Suntour Cyclone components and a Chromoly fork instead of hi-ten, and an aggressive riding geometry.  I found an early-model Schwinn Prelude on craigslist (I later found out it comes stock with a hi-ten fork and relaxed geometry and worse components, but I didn't know about the differences between year models at the time). The seller also happened to have this 1989 Schwinn Tempo for sale. I bought both because 'why not?'  The Tempo was more of a race bike- with no eyelets for fenders or racks, for example, and it had the same frame geometry as the 1990 Schwinn Prelude that I'd fallen in love with, along with a Chromoly fork. So the 1989 Schwinn Tempo is much closer to a 1990 Schwinn Prelude than a 1988 Schwinn Prelude is to a 1990 Schwinn Prelude (weird, huh?)"
bicycling,3dqk29,MK_Ultrex,2,Sat Jul 18 21:19:06 2015 UTC,"I suspected it was something like that. I grew up with a Schwinn shop just down the street from me, and I was getting into bike racing in the late 1980s too.   My situation had been with a Schwinn Prologue that I'd built up bit by bit. That bike got stolen, and I didn't finally replace it until after I'd graduated college and found one on eBay. Not an exact match, but close enough. Felt great."

bicycling,3drg03,HenrySellersBBC,4,Sat Jul 18 19:50:01 2015 UTC,"It is important that professional athletes don't dope. It can be harmful and we don't yet fully understand all the implications doping can have on the human body. If you allow it in professional sports, you are essentially supporting the act. It's like doctors in the early 20th century saying smoking is actually good for you.   Furthermore, as spectators and fans, we want to be able to watch these guys and be able to think - 'you know what? I could do that if I worked hard enough.' If they're all doping however, it completely strips that away.   Doping should never ever ever be condoned.  The problem however, is that it's almost impossible to actually catch anyone in the act these days. If anyone actually is doping, there's pretty much no chance we'll know for sure unless they do something very stupid, like keeping used syringes in their own home (cough) miller (cough).  And considering we are talking about peoples careers, it's not a stretch to imagine plenty of pro athletes (not just cyclists) being on the juice.   It sucks, but doping allegations aren't going away and I think to some extent that's a good thing. If the pros are constantly being bombarded with the fact that doping is bad, hopefully there's less chance of them doing it. Because they know that if they do end up getting caught, they are going to be hated by the world.   Obviously throwing urine in someone's face is just fucked up, however."

After getting tired of that I formatted the mountable drive and loaded new firmware (or actually loaded old firmware then reloaded the new on top). Worked fine for a few months after that but now it gets stuck at either the GARMIN boot screen for a long time and eventually goes to the USB connected/charging screen even when it's not connected.

And beyond that, I usually suggest to people to just get Wahoo's Blue SC speed/cadence sensor, as it broadcasts in both BLE and ANT+, then you're good if you decide to switch between your phone or a dedicated bike computer without having to switch sensors. Also, a speed/cadence sensor is good if you slap your bike on a trainer.  A properly set up speed sensor will give more accurate speed readings. IIRC, Garmins will only use GPS for speed as a fallback if it disconnects from the sensor.  What were you looking at getting?"

You'll feel better when you get a few good rides in."
bicycling,3dr1su,jacluley,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:15:12 2015 UTC,I bet something was poking through the tire and was puncturing the tube.  I've made the mistake of forgetting to thoroughly check the inside of the tire for any debris before installing a new or patched tube.

bicycling,3dr1su,AlvaSt-Snow,2,Sat Jul 18 19:04:11 2015 UTC,I used to get flats when I started because I didn't pump up my tires enough. If you run them too low they get pinched and pop. Check them before every ride. EVERY RIDE.  Also always get the puncture resistant tubes. Its not like you are out there trying to win a race.
bicycling,3dr1su,Packinwood,2,Sat Jul 18 19:20:53 2015 UTC,"Try these things: 1. Velo-plugs, I had these on a bike and I went two years w/o a flat. A record only to be ruined by a brutal combination of a pothole/manhole cover. I initially had very cheap tires with them too.  2. Puncture resistant tires are your friend. I've used Gatorskins and their high performance version, Continental 4 Seasons. Specialized makes Armadillos/Roubaix tires. I'm not an expert and everyone has their favourite. Choose one! 3. Pump your tire up to the right PSI and do it often. If you're ~100 psi, do it every 2-3 days 4. On one of my bikes I went went road tubeless. It has some serious benefits and some negatives too.  I ride my ass off and I can't remember my last flat. I carry a tube and canister for like no reason."

bicycling,3dqrk5,relevant_element,4,Sat Jul 18 15:30:39 2015 UTC,"The last time I posted about this bike was late last year. This is a custom build based on a Genesis Day One frame that my LBS put together for me. Rohloff Speedhub, hydraulic brakes, hub dynamo, etc. My dream commuter and light tourer.  A few things has happened since I got it. The factory equipped steel fork wasn’t tall enough to allow for mudguards with 35c tires, even though that was advertised. My LBS complained to Genesis and they sent a new fork, in carbon fiber. Soft and useless on cobblestone, scary at high speeds. Awesome as my LBS is; they decided to get a custom fork built (the owner knows a frame builder). This is my bike with that fork.  We also did a few other changes, the Gilles Berthoud shifter didn’t work with Randonneur drop bars; the bent arms on the drop bars interfered with shifting and made everything move slowly. After swapping the drop bars to a straight model everything worked out great."
bicycling,3dqrk5,DarthWTF,3,Sat Jul 18 15:30:47 2015 UTC,This looks beautiful. SON 28 on the front?  Also this might interest you: https://georgblaschkebikes.wordpress.com/2015/06/10/die-rohbox-wird-langsam-konkret/  He has a small rundown in English at the bottom.

If the STI adapter would have been available when I built the bike I would have been all over it, but it turns out I'm pretty happy with the current setup. It's easy to shift several gears at once and the design is time tested."
bicycling,3dqrk5,Crankset,2,Sat Jul 18 23:29:13 2015 UTC,"Nice!  Did you mean you have straighter drop bars now, or straight bars?  I ended up swapping drops for straights and it does work better with the Rohloff shifter.  I love the hub, mostly, but not the shifters.  I thought about the Berthouds, but they wouldn't fit my  drop bars.  This summer the 35s have been great riding gravel logging roads, and the huge gear range makes it possible."

If your weather forecast is accurate, 100% avoid riding from 12-7 or whenever your hottest part of the day is. With 95% humidity, you're probably looking at a heat index of 200 or some shit.

bicycling,3ds6u9,giantnakedrei,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:21:18 2015 UTC,"Luckily, I live in a place with not-so-hot weather.  The highest it's gotten while I've been out is 36C.  But it's almost always 70-100% humidity.  And wind.  Not terrible wind usually, but a pretty constant seasonal pattern of winds (for example, from June - July the wind is pretty constantly south/south-east, except for where the typhoon came through a couple days ago - today's wind was from the west.  But from tomorrow it'll be back to south-south-east.)  I did 117km in mostly 33C 70% humidity on a clear day.  (The middle 30km is along the coast, so it's more like 25C 100% humidity.)  Sunscreen is a must.  I put more on every time I stopped.  I took a small bottle (30ml) with me.  And I took two bottles with me one with nuun electrolyte drink and one with sports drink.  I took a couple nuun tabs and a half-packet of sports drink powder (Aquarius brand.)  I probably drank around 1-1.5 bottles per hour on the bike and more when I stopped.  I got by filling up bottles at convenience stores where I'd stop to grab food.  Drink when you're thirsty, stop when you're tired, eat at least when you stop.  Make sure to take in plenty of calories on a longer ride.  And wear sunscreen - the burn won't hurt until you stop (probably) but it's easier to prevent than deal with the consequences.  And early morning rides are great. (Sun comes up at 4:40?  Get on the road at 5 and be home before the heat really bakes in.) You might deal with more bugs depending on where you ride, but the trade-off might be worth it."

Additionally, you might want to ask for components on the bike and check online to see if it adds up."

bicycling,3drnnq,Fieralds,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:00:53 2015 UTC,"The best bike for you is one that fits well. If you're just looking to commute, I'd recommend you go to a LBS and try out different styles of bike to see what you prefer the most.  If you end up looking for a road bike, research common entry level bikes from major manufacturers. It's quite easy to find a bike that's only a few years old that's almost as good as new. Look for bikes that also aren't using the bottom of the line groupsets (the mechanical components that cause the shifting and transfer your pedaling to the wheel). Shimano 105 is pretty bulletproof, and if you're patient, you can probably find something like a specialized allez or similar with 105 easily in your price range.   For example, http://sfbay.craigslist.org/eby/bik/5127346946.html might be a better fit for you, and is a much better value. Be aware though, that some brands, like scattante, are typically purchased online (bikesdirect.com, etc.) and may not have been assembled properly. The best thing to do if you don't feel comfortable learning and performing a basic tune up is to budget ~$100 to have a local bike shop perform a quick once over and tune up so that you don't run into any issues further on down the line.   Also, if you're going to be parking it publicly, protect your investment and invest in some good U locks!  Good luck with your search!"

Sunglasses that fit comfortably and aren't going to come off are also important.

I stumbled upon a video that showed how to use resistance bands to strengthen the lower legs, and over a few weeks my shin splints went away. I run long distances frequently and have zero issues these days. The key is to bring balance to your leg muscles. Shin splints are a sign that some leg muscles are compensating for others.

bicycling,3dr531,tarjan,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:49:54 2015 UTC,"On a bike, it's really easy to do cardio with the Tabata (HIIT) method.  I like to do mine on a nice flat stretch of road near me - warm up for 10m of easy riding - get your legs nice and loose and get your heart rate up a little bit.  The workout itself is 4 minutes long.  From the start, go at 99% effort for 20 seconds - not quite as hard/fast as you can, but close.  Then just spin easy for 10 seconds.  The interval is 20 seconds on, 10 seconds off for 4 minutes.  (8x 20 second efforts.)  I like to do it like this: on a reasonably flat stretch (usually about 2-3km long without any traffic lights or turns) I put the bike in a pretty low gear - 50x12 or 50x13 (I want to choose a gear so that I don't have to shift mid-effort or rest and throw off the clock.)   Then I start the video clip on my phone - it's got a 20 second countdown to the first interval - so I can stop and start the timer on the side of the road if I need to.  Then it's just sprint through the 20 second efforts (usually out of the saddle for the first couple at fairly high rpm, but by the end it's usually around 50-60 rpm if I'm still getting out of the saddle.)  After the time is done, I ride ride back home at a pretty steady pace.  I usually start at about 120-130 bpm and get up to around 190 bpm really pushing it.    Alternatively, just ride for length while keeping your heart rate around 140-150 bpm.  According to some marketing (and the translation of the Tabata study,) one 4m Tabata effort is as effective as 30 minutes of steady cardio at improving your VO2max (IIRC.)"

When doing a ride with food, try to eat consistently as once you feel like you are running out of energy it is too late and you will be fighting an uphill battle.

bicycling,3dr94y,chronsbons,2,Sat Jul 18 18:32:58 2015 UTC,"It really depends on the person.  To give you an example, I did 65 miles the other day.  Took me just about 4 hours.  I had a PB&J for breakfast before I left, a banana about a quarter of the way through, and a clif bar about half the way through.  I had an extra clif bar in my jersey, just in case, but I didn't end up eating it.     40 miles shouldn't take you 4 hours unless you go really slow.  In that case (unless you are out of shape), you shouldn't be exerting yourself too much to worry about making a precise eating schedule.  It'll probably be closer to around 2 hours and 30 mins.  If it was me I might eat half of a clif bar mid ride.    As for drinks, it depends vastly on exertion level and/or temperature/humidity.  So for 40 miles I could drink anywhere from half a 500ml bottle of water to two bottles of Gatorade.  It really depends on the person.  Same goes for food.  Just take a couple of extra bars, just in case, and don't worry about it too much."
bicycling,3dr94y,adriftinanmtc,2,Sat Jul 18 22:29:07 2015 UTC,"if i was planning on doing a 4 hour ride this is what my food and liquid consumption would look before and during the ride.  night before: Make sure dinner is a balanced meal with some carbs, maybe add a second serving of whatever the carbohydrate is. Also hydrate a lot. I would try to consume 1.5L of water between 6pm and bedtime.   moring before ride: lets asume i am planning to leave on my ride at 10am. wake up around 7:30 eat breakfast. between breakfast and leaving for ride consume another .75L of water or gatorade. procede to make sure bike and tires are good to go between 8-9. 9: make Peanutbutter and honey sandwich and consume while getting kit on and filling water bottles. 21oz bottle with gatorade, 25oz bottle with water.  during ride: Consume food every 45 minutes. food being honey stinger gels and cliff bars, alternating between the two. plenty of water being used to was down each food item. ride would be planned so that a stop between 2-3 to refill bottles was possible."

bicycling,3dq6om,pm--me--puppies,5,Sat Jul 18 11:05:06 2015 UTC,"What are like in traffic? never seen one on the road, any issues with visibility, being spotted by cars etc?"
bicycling,3dq6om,xuot,5,Sat Jul 18 11:36:29 2015 UTC,"There is an upside to the trike there - when you are riding on roads, you get the 'novelty factor' factor, which means the majority of people go ""what the fuck is that"", and stop driving on autopilot. As a result, they generally give you way more than three feet of gap, which is a real plus for me.  The downside of the trike is you are below door height, and in some urban streets, especially with parked cars on the side, you aren't really obvious to all drivers (eg, parked car opening their door in your face, or sidestreet traffic turning into my road etc).   That scenario is pretty rare where I live - never for more than a few hundred meters, and never unplanned, so I will be running my bright orange flags and I will sit in the middle of the car lane while there are cars parked on the side, or approaching side streets to ensure I am completely visible for that stretch, douchy or not - I don't want to get run over or faceplant into someones door."

bicycling,3dq6om,dalesd,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:48:37 2015 UTC,"We appreciate your concern, but there's no evidence that trikes or recumbents are any more dangerous than upright bikes.     Drivers almost always say ""I didn't see him"" after killing a cyclist, recumbent or upright."
bicycling,3dq6om,nivvis,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:21:48 2015 UTC,"I know its just an anecdote. But it got me thinking about safety more. In a world where just a little bit more reflectivity might make a  difference, I choose to have a couple more feet of height."
bicycling,3dq6om,dalesd,2,Sat Jul 18 19:20:00 2015 UTC,"Where I live now, I really don't do road riding at all unless its a club ride - for the one-off things I need to do that I can't reach via the dedicated bike network, I just drive.  The reason I stopped riding at my last place was precisely that I didn't feel safe riding on the roads on any type of bike - every trip you wanted to take involved riding along 100kph freeways with a joke of a bike lane painted on the side, although to be honest, I would feel safer on a trike there - they can see you, they just don't give you any space if you are on 2 wheels. Trikes, they tend to cross the median and give you a ton of extra space."

bicycling,3dq6om,cafe_bustelo,2,Sat Jul 18 12:55:01 2015 UTC,"I am genuinely ignorant -- how fast can you really descend on a trike, since you can't lean in corners? Won't you eventually slide out?"
bicycling,3dq6om,balducien,2,Sat Jul 18 13:09:49 2015 UTC,"To a degree it depends on the trike (eg some have cambered wheels) - but your centre of gravity is very low (16""-20"" on front wheels), and you can lean your butt to the inside of the corner in like this.  They don't explode if you get them up on two wheels while cornering, and in general they slide in a pretty controlled manner, so pushing the limits is a huge part of the fun :-)  Beyond that, you have fully faired trikes (velomobiles) - which will go much faster (80-90kph downhill isn't that unusual, and ~40 on the flat due to the full body fairing) - but they don't corner as well, since you can't lean to any real degree inside the bodywork."

bicycling,3dqlm3,Jon_Knows_Nothing,10,Sat Jul 18 14:29:24 2015 UTC,Get your kit ready tonight. Eat & sleep well. Pace yourself & don't go mad trying to keep up with anyone. Find your own pace. Keep topped up with fluid & carbs during the ride. Enjoy it.
bicycling,3dqlm3,theysellcoke,3,Sat Jul 18 14:44:37 2015 UTC,"I would use it as a massive training ride; getting used to riding at the limit for a long period of time.   Unlike a group ride, where you have basically A, B, and C speeds, you'll see higher variation when packs start breaking up.  For me, that would mean finding a smaller group holding whatever mph, but working on cycling through the pack, pulling above threshold, and then working on recovery.  So if you're into training, you could look at it as the best kind of group ride to push yourself.   I wouldn't start off in the pack with the guys looking to make it a race, but maybe try and stick with those who are riding 1-2 mph faster than what you can average solo. Drafting will require about the same wattage as your solo rides, so you can work on sitting in the front and recovering.   That's the only way to get faster, really.   BUT  If you haven't done this kind of distance before, or aren't comfortable riding the limit for 3 hours, I'd stay with a group that rides your same solo pace and have fun. Take longer turns if you want a workout, or sit in, chat, and have a good time.   Or a mix; when/if you see riders getting dropped, speed up and catch onto them; let them have a draft and slowly come back into the original group.  I dunno; just make sure you bring a lot of food and fill up on water every chance you get.   Also, make sure you can fix your own flat and be self-supportive; don't expect a caravan to stop if you flat or get hungry."

If a group of riders goes off really fast, don't try chase them, if it is mass start, just try keep a straight predictable manor on the road and don't overlap someone's back wheel - especially if it is windy. Image  I'm going to assume you've done a bit of riding before, and done close to the distance - If you end up in a group don't be afraid to move forward and give the guys in front a break, even if it means the speed of the group drops down a little. Don't feel the need to push to your limits as you'll most likely explode and not be able to finish the ride, or you'll finish feeling crap."

bicycling,3dmpec,MsBaconPancakes,7,Fri Jul 17 20:29:34 2015 UTC,"Take the above comment seriously. Anytime I've bonked it's been due to not paying attention to the 100-200 calorie rule per hour (depending on what you are doing, too, serious climbing means needing more calories)."
bicycling,3dmpec,NutzJones,2,Fri Jul 17 21:58:13 2015 UTC,"Completely agree. I didn't think eating during cycling would make a big difference, but it really does."
bicycling,3dmpec,TheDimasBow,0,Fri Jul 17 23:53:37 2015 UTC,"The Velominati say any ride under 4 hours doesn't require food.  ;)   While this isn't always true, listen to your body.  Don't think you HAVE to eat during your ride.  The ""bonk"" you mention is real, but commonly known as a blow up and could be due to a variety of factors and usually a ""perfect storm"" combination of fatigue, lack of quality recovery, the day's nutrition, and hydration."
bicycling,3dmpec,SirNull,2,Sat Jul 18 01:23:39 2015 UTC,Some of my two hour rides need food.
bicycling,3dmpec,barnitosupreme69,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:27:22 2015 UTC,is it wierd on my 12 mile rides i dont even take water?
bicycling,3dmpec,Willie_Mays_HAES,3,Sat Jul 18 03:38:32 2015 UTC,Depends on the weather. I've done 15 mile rides in 100 deg heat and went through 2 bottles and felt like I should have brought more. Probably should have drank a little more before the ride too.
bicycling,3dmpec,Sp4m,2,Sat Jul 18 11:18:20 2015 UTC,That obviously depends on the route and the conditions but I'd say no given you're well hydrated before setting off.
bicycling,3dmpec,_crucial_,2,Sat Jul 18 08:09:00 2015 UTC,"Good tip. I was stopping and eating this ride. I brought 2 Kashi granola bars, an apple, a baggie of almonds/peanuts/raisins and some beef jerky.   I don't usually bring food on my shorter rides, just water. It was upper 80's yesterday evening on my 20 mile and I went through 3 bottles and could have used more."
bicycling,3dmpec,Duckrauhl,10,Sat Jul 18 13:09:42 2015 UTC,"I hope you were wearing a helmet when you hit that wall. Next time, I would advise picking a route without hazards like that."
bicycling,3dmpec,He_that_cant_rip,5,Sat Jul 18 00:36:03 2015 UTC,It was cyclocross.
bicycling,3dmpec,_crucial_,2,Sat Jul 18 00:53:17 2015 UTC,"LOL, this was actually my first long ride with a helmet. I didn't wear one before and just recently picked one up."
bicycling,3dmpec,TheSacredZucchini,2,Sat Jul 18 13:11:16 2015 UTC,"Dude, we are like bike twins or something. I just finished an exactly 52 mile ride today, had gone a max of around 30 before that, and do the same length rides as you regularly. high five"
bicycling,3dmpec,_crucial_,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:57:27 2015 UTC,"I'm curious what bikes you guys ride. I have a Giant Roam hybrid and usually ride the local streets and trails. I like the lockout fork so I can switch it between suspended and solid. Are streets are garbage here and the potholes are tolerable in suspended mode. On the groomed trails I lock it out and it rides great.   When I bought the bike last year I tried a few road style bikes but I just couldn't get used to the feel. I am 6'3"" and 250lbs and have a 34"" inseam. It is hard to find a bike that fits me well. My legs are longer than average for my height so I end up with too much of a reach on frames that fit my legs well.  My 52 mile ride was on a rails to trails bike trail that is a crushed limestone surface. It's actually the first rails to trails path created in the country."
bicycling,3dmpec,Cptn_Slow,11,Sat Jul 18 13:25:30 2015 UTC,Congrats! I just got back from my first ride over 15 Miles.
bicycling,3dmpec,Not2original,10,Fri Jul 17 18:41:58 2015 UTC,"I know 20 miles isn't much for most of you, and it nearly killed me, but it was a huge accomplishment for this fat boy. I can't wait till I hit 30!   Love those milestones!  Just keep spinning, just keep spinning! =-D"
bicycling,3dmpec,WillRedditForBeer,7,Fri Jul 17 16:33:36 2015 UTC,You will hit 30 and have a chuckle about how bad you felt after that first 20. Keep going!
bicycling,3dmpec,britsey,6,Fri Jul 17 16:50:26 2015 UTC,"I only took up full time cycling 4 months ago, and the day I first hit 20 is still so clear in my mind- it feels so awesome and you're right to congratulate yourself. What's also awesome is that it just gets easier from here- getting from 20 miles to 40 miles isn't nearly as hard as 5 to 10 and then 10 to 20. Don't give up, you're doing great!"
bicycling,3dmpec,jlangholzj,4,Fri Jul 17 17:54:46 2015 UTC,"Thanks! That's great to hear. 40 seems so far at this point, but I've already noticed my daily commute is getting so much easier. I'm going for 25 this weekend."
bicycling,3dmpec,baggyzed,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:29:04 2015 UTC,Good! Like the above poster i started ~4 mo ago and did my first 30 miler this weekend. Before that i hit my first 20mph pace on my 20mi stretch. KEEP PUSHING.. Youll be surprised how fast you catch on! Way to go man :)

bicycling,3dmpec,mithrandirbooga,4,Fri Jul 17 18:13:13 2015 UTC,"""Much"" is relative. The true comparison is in how hard you struggled. A professional can knock out 80 miles without trying, that's not impressive. 20 miles from someone who doubted they could do it is strength."
bicycling,3dmpec,sungazer69,6,Fri Jul 17 23:36:00 2015 UTC,"About 4 years ago I thought 20 miles was an amazing distance. I had to stop every 5 miles to rest. Everyone thought that was incredible.  Now I ride 200 miles a week and everyone tells me to shut the fuck up about it.  Congratulations on the descent into madness, my friend. It only gets better from here."
bicycling,3dmpec,RayParkerJr,6,Sat Jul 18 02:56:16 2015 UTC,It's a lot dude.  Very good job.  Keep it up.  A 20 mile ride is a very nice ride these days for me and a very good workout.
bicycling,3dmpec,jacluley,3,Fri Jul 17 16:18:46 2015 UTC,"Hey well done! 20 soon becomes 25, 30, 35 and hopefully my next milestone of 40. Might make an attempt this weekend."
bicycling,3dmpec,sparklekitteh,3,Fri Jul 17 16:46:30 2015 UTC,"Great job, op. Keep it up. I remember a long time ago, I decided to start biking to work. I stopped to rest after the first 6 miles. It's a strange thing to even think about now. I did a century ride just for training a couple weekends ago. First stop was at 40 miles. Made my second stop at sonic at 75 miles. Haha, it's really fun to get a drink other than water or Gatorade in your bottle... It's going to be a treat for long rides from now on, though."

I've lost 30 lbs since then and have ridden two centuries and did a 8200' metric century just last month. Keep riding and increasing bit by bit. Soon, you'll be one of those hard core folks they call ""roadies"".   Soon... I might be, as well."

bicycling,3dmpec,chase_the_dragon,2,Fri Jul 17 20:29:08 2015 UTC,"while the muscle groups used in running and cycling are different, the cardio you have built up while will help in your cycling. I'm mostly a cyclist, but at the gym, I'll sometimes warm up by running 5 km on a treadmill and it's very doable."
bicycling,3dmpec,essayerdenouveau,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:59:58 2015 UTC,"I don't think that's a very fair comparison, I've never rode all the way to 20 miles and I'm fairly confident I can still run a ~6 min mile."
bicycling,3dmpec,chase_the_dragon,2,Fri Jul 17 19:38:37 2015 UTC,"I was relating to overcoming that first goal, not the actual distance."

I can't relate to being that excited about riding my first 20 miles, because I knew I could do it, I've done it, and I know I can do it again and more.  Way back when I ran my first mile, i was ECSTATIC.  I guess this was a personal thing, I shouldn't have posted it on a professional biking forum - sorry."

bicycling,3dmpec,frmDaNorthSide,2,Sat Jul 18 00:24:21 2015 UTC,"Congrats!  keep it up and most of all keep it fun.  This book:  The Complete Book of Long-Distance Cycling: Build the Strength, Skills, and Confidence to Ride as Far as You Want  is on Amazon etc, helped me a ton starting out.  one of the things they note I agree with is that the jump from 20 miles to 50 miles is harder than the jump from 50 miles to 100 miles (totally debatable, my $0.02).  the trials and tribulations of a Century are something you just have to experience to comprehend but you can totally get there.    I've seen heavy guys do the work and up their mileage into 100+ miles a week.  the weight can be tough to take off but the muscle and cardiovascular improvements they make are fun to watch.  big guys can be freight trains on flat roads.  in 2009 I was 60lbs heavier, I'd puke and cramp on a 30 mile ride.  I got a road bike and now I'm into a rhythm of 125 miles a week (6k miles a year) and am completely obsessed.  it's not even so much the exercise, it's the catharsis, the endorphins, the comradery with friends (and strangers) and being in my 40s and in great shape.  oh, and I eat whatever I want and love beer.  keep it fun and remember that the weather ALWAYS looks worse than it is from inside your home than when you're 10 minutes into a ride.

Then I kept doubling that until I got to 32.(not saying I did them consecutively just those were my milestones.) Then everything after that took similar effort. 20 was a huge deal solo and is the same as 30-40 on a group ride. When I rode my first century it wasn't so much harder as just more. Any amount is a step in the right direction and 20 miles is a solid ride. Congratulations. Seriously.
