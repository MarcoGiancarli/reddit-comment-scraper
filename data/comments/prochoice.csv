I could tell you, for example, that if you were living in the states that there would essentially be nothing that you could do, as peoples right to that type of speech (a.k.a. really hurtful, abusive speech that none-the-less has a political motivation, and is not actively a call to violence) is not really limited in the USA.

American voters aren't exactly known for approaching issues with logical reasoning. They'll just look at the video as being ""ABORTION IS FOR CANNIBALS! SEE!

If you take the word ""Liberal"" meaning cosmopolitan and educated (which a lot of liberals sadly aren't anymore, particularly the reactionary SJWs), that's basically a dog whistle for ""Jews who own the media."" I once heard an on-air preacher compare abortion to blood libel sacrifice. He didn't even try to hide his contempt for the ""sheer amount of Jews who go into the medical field.""  I hope this won't be a blow to abortion rights, but with fucking Trump leading the polls and being only slightly ahead of the Christofascist oil scion who made Terry Schiavo suffer on a feeding tube for Jesus, I'm not too optimistic that this won't be a boon for them.

prochoice,3drp3g,Futurist110,7,Sat Jul 18 20:27:18 2015 UTC,"Hey,  This comes up from time to time.  Basically, the reasoning from which I (and many others) derive our pro-choice views and the reasoning for child support are independent.  Abortion is not an alternative to parenthood.  It is an alternative to continuing to carry a pregnancy.  Although many pregnant people who seek abortions cite their unpreparedness for parenthood as a reason for seeking an abortion, they are leaving unstated the additional part of their reasoning, that they do not want to carry a pregnancy to term when they are not ready to parent a child.  On the other hand, child support laws are the result of an observed societal need for the well-being of existing children.  They in no way violate the bodily autonomy of men.  As a reasonable person, of course I disagree with egregious cases, such as men who are raped by women who become pregnant as a result of that rape subsequently being made to pay child support.  I think that the laws regarding child support could likely use extensive review.  But I do not think that the logic behind supporting bodily autonomy for women can be extended to what some have called ""financial abortions.""  There have been several similar discussions on this board in the past.  I encourage you to review them."
prochoice,3drp3g,TrustedAdult,-1,Sun Jul 19 00:44:28 2015 UTC,"The thing is, though, that bodily autonomy isn't the only argument which is used to justify legalized abortion; indeed, some of the other arguments which are used to justify legalized abortion can also be used to justify giving males an opt-out from paying child support.  Also, do you think that men whose vasectomies failed and whose female sexual partners lied or changed their minds in regards to abortion or adoption should be forced to pay child support? Serious question, for the record."

I don't entirely agree with this, though; after all, as I said before, a lot of the arguments which pro-choicers use in favor of legalized abortion can likewise be used in favor of giving males an opt-out from paying child support.  Also, for the record, the bodily autonomy argument has never been entirely convincing to me. Heck, I'm pro-choice, but even I don't view bodily autonomy as being a holy cow.   If you are interested in discussing child support further, you would probably get some rousing support at /r/mensrights.   Yes, I suppose.

The discussion that you are trying to have is a very different one from the one that I was having with Futurist110.  You're doing so in an incendiary way, which, as one of those alleged ""doctors"" you refer to, I don't particularly appreciate.  Your final line is interesting, and illustrates the difference between our thinking.  I think of child support as a decision by the state to improve the well-being of children, and they put the onus on parents because it is a convenient way to do it.  You present it as being a separate, isolated rule -- a sort of external morality.  The explanation and conversation seem to end there.  I think that's part of why Futurist110 took this conversation to /r/prochoice; he was looking for discussion on this issue from people with pro-choice views, with possible implicit differences in their thoughts on parent-child obligations.  You and I agree that child support laws should exist, even if we have different reasons for believing it.  If you feel that it's very interesting to discuss the differences in our reasons, I'm open to it.  Please reread the rules on the right if you would like to avoid being banned.

People, regardless of their anatomy, have the same rights to become or not become parents. Children have a right to be supported.   What we have right now violates ideal 2. Your proposal would fix ideal 2, but in turn violates ideal 3. I think the only way to fix all 3 would be to add your solution, but then have the tax payer subsidize it, but then you are just passing off the problem to the tax payer, who wasn't a party and shouldn't really have to get involved.   Thus, we essentially have to pick 2 ideals out of 3 to follow. For me, the most important are ideals 1 and 3. Taking away someones rights to their body is cruel, and children without a fair upbringing is far more of an affront to equality than violating ideal 2 is.

Your entire last comment demoralized and isolates all women. Clearly you've never known anybody to have had an abortion because it's not a flippant decision that you make on a whim. Many fetal abnormalities revolve around a fetus not surviving outside of the womb or having a very low standard of life. I wouldn't wish that on anybody. If a woman becomes pregnant with a fetus with no brain who would never survive would you find it acceptable to force her to carry that fetus to term and give birth? If that were me I would be heartbroken. I would want to abort because everyday I would think about the dead fetus I was carrying.

The risk of death within a year of having a kidney surgically removed is 2.6%.  You have a family history of diabetes and run the risk of losing kidney function later in life.  You are in law school and can't afford to take time off to donate.  But, the judge tells you, you should have thought about that before dancing.  You must donate.  Then what?  An ankle bracelet to make sure you don't go anywhere?  Finally wheeled into the hospital?  Handcuffed?  Or just under threat of jail time if you don't go?  I'm a surgeon.  I have it engraved in my heart that a procedure without consent is assault.  We have a long history of medical assault in my profession.  Lobotomies, symphisiotomies, and sterilizations.

If you read through the transcript you see that the money given to PP is to offset the costs of the clinic in consenting the patients and gathering the tissue for research. PP is a nonprofit, and this tissue is not being sold on the black market haha, its being used by legitimate researchers all over the world to find cures for cancers and diseases.   Where are these statements made by Dr. Nucatola?  ""Afiliates are not looking to make money by doing this. They’re looking to serve their patients and just make it not impact their bottom line.""   ""Nobody should be “selling” tissue. That’s just not the goal here.""  ""I think for affiliates, at the end of the day, they’re a non-profit, they want to break even. And if they can do a little better than break even, and do so in a way that seems reasonable, they’re happy to do that. Really their bottom line is, they want to break even. Every penny they save is a just pennies they give to another patient. To provide a service the patient wouldn’t get.""   In regards to the patients who donate tissue to research:   ""Every patient experiences a whole wide range of emotions about the experience in general, and so you don’t know where they’re coming at from there. But I think every one of them is happy to know that there’s a possibility for them to do “this extra bit of good,” in what they do. And I think patients respond most to knowing the types of outcomes that it might contribute to, so for example Alzheimer's research, Parkinson’s research. I think most of these patients have some experience with at least one of these conditions or another.""

I work in the healthcare industry - there is a lot the public doesn't know a out what happens to medical waste or what the process is for tissue donation. People freak out when they are ""burning fetuses to heat the hospital"" when what we are talking about is a furnace that burns all medical waste that isn't harvested, and a system that recaptures some of that energy.   In this case - feral tissue is quite useful for research. Providers obtain permission, and try to offset the cost of harvesting and shipping specimens to labs who need them for research. This isn't harvesting organs, as they aren't fully - viable organs, typically. We're talking about tissue, here, and stem cells, in some cases (from the cord). Very valuable for the scientific community. But not making money selling organs on the black market. The level of hyperbole here is outrageous."

prochoice,3d95wt,wandered,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:52:29 2015 UTC,"I will leave this up for now, pending on community response.  Here are my problems with the video:   Video makes 2 references to felonies/fines, right after an interview with someone who admitted breaking these laws, yet there are no references to lawsuits or charges filed. I was surprised to see stemexpress.com is a legitimate site.  They are clearly providing a number of different tissues for medical research with a gestational range of 4 to 20 weeks.  That's pretty heavy.  Though, apparently a more appropriate course of action for what they receive is to dispose of it instead of distribute it for research?  I'm not so sure about that. 2 more references to allegedly broken laws, this time regarding partial-birth abortion, right after a section of the interview with a few details as to how they're performed.  This seems like a convenient segue to inject some unrelated shock therapy. Surprised so see that was actually the CEO of PP at the end of the video.  Though they try to prove a point that the distribution of tissue is indeed taking place, it's pretty clear that no laws are being broken here.   If any laws were being broken, this would be a simple operation to shut down.  Overall I'm unimpressed."

And you can continue to stick to referring to pregnancy as ""motherhood"" and I will continue to refute it. If every woman who became pregnant was considered a mother, there would be a lot more mothers, since 75% of all fertilized eggs never implant in the first place, and 50% of implanted ones spontaneously abort themselves. You can claim to be relying on ""hard science"" but this is a matter of interpretation. We have different definitions of the term ""mother,"" and yours is one often held by opponents of reproductive freedom. I think that justifies a little wariness on the part of this sub."

prochoice,3d7j9b,HeyitsKierston,12,Tue Jul 14 04:06:09 2015 UTC,"This does not look like a baby born at 24 weeks gestation. Perhaps it is a baby born at that point in time and then nurtured by doctors and nurses in an incubator for say the  next ten weeks until the mother could finally hug it.   If you want real pictures of babies at 24 weeks, google neonate 24 weeks.   And remember:    most people don't abort at 24 weeks but much earlier a lot of the people who have abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy do so, because their fetus has been shown by ultrasound or other techniques to be severely handicapped or incapable of living for long.   A neonate born at 24 weeks has a very slim chance of survival. If it survives, the chances of it being handicapped are great."

prochoice,3d1ps3,sotonohito,2,Sun Jul 12 20:24:52 2015 UTC,"Vast oversimplification.  I strongly agree there is a lot of dishonesty in the anti-choice movement, especially among its leadership, and clearly it is more of an anti-sex movement than a pro-life one, but even so, I think it's pretty clear that the majority of these people are doing what they believe is right, misguided as they may be.  Maybe there was absolutely nothing pure about the motives behind this particular action, but to extend that to the entire movement... I'm afraid that would just be too easy."
prochoice,3d1ps3,vagued,0,Mon Jul 13 06:01:19 2015 UTC,"The crowds screaming hate at black students in the 1960's also thought they were doing right, it does not make them any less evil.  I tried taking the nuanced, ""gee maybe this is too complex"" approach.  I was wrong.  This proves it.  I was a sucker, a dupe, I was stupid to believe that they were honest and could be seriously talked to.  They are nothing but enemies, all of them.  Again, let me explain this since you seem to have missed the main point.    The people who claim that it's ok to violate the bodily autonomy of every woman on the planet because they love fetuses and hate abortion so much, have just taken action to increase the number of abortions.  Their actions prove that their words are a lie.  They do not care about fetuses.  They do not see abortion as an evil to be stopped at all costs.  They are lying when they claim that they do care about abortion or fetuses.  Once that explanation for their actions is eliminated, only one other explanation remains: they are simply evil and hate women and sex.  My mind can be changed here easily: present empirical evidence proving that they are not lying."
prochoice,3d1ps3,vagued,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:15:18 2015 UTC,"It's not about empirical evidence–what you're saying is not logically sound.  ""The people who... hate abortion so much, have just taken action to increase the number of abortions?"" All of them?  Even within Colorado, did the actions of these ""pro-life groups"" require the active participation of every single anti-choice person in Colorado?  Of course not.  They may not all have agreed with it, and if they did it was certainly out of ignorance, not evil.  Racism is evil.  Racist actions are evil.  Is every single racist person fundamentally evil?  I'm afraid that while tempting, that would be an oversimplified, unproductive way of looking at the world.    Similarly, what we're seeing here is an outcome of religion.  Religion, I do believe, is essentially evil.  It causes people to lie to themselves on a constant basis, and thereby to others.  It causes people to do evil things.  But does that mean all religious people are evil?  It doesn't, and believing it does will get you nowhere.  It makes sense to believe that the ""pro-life"" movement is evil and deeply dishonest, and everyone who embraces it is by definition your political opponent, but a lot of them are, confusing though it may be, good people, who are not aware of any dishonesty.  Sorry."

prochoice,3d1ps3,cuauhtlatoatzin,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:01:58 2015 UTC,"The fact that some politicians have stopped a program that was going to cost them money (even though in the longer run it was saving money due to needing less medicare and benefits - but politicians have been known to take shortsighted decisions before), does not mean that all people who have the opinion that all abortions are wrong, are evil.   There definitely are pro-life people who see what you and I see: that preventing abortions by reducing the amount of unwanted pregnancies is a good thing, and that this program was therefore a good thing."
prochoice,3d1ps3,bunnylover726,-1,Mon Jul 13 04:17:22 2015 UTC,"You haven't presented any evidence indicating that the so called pro-lifers are anything but the evil I named them to be.  Try again.   There definitely are pro-life people who see what you and I see: that preventing abortions by reducing the amount of unwanted pregnancies is a good thing, and that this program was therefore a good thing.   I see no evidence to indicate that statement is true.  Again, it was not ""some politicians"" that stopped the program, it was the deliberate and concerted effort of the so called pro-life groups in Colorado.  Again, the ""pro-life"" people deliberately took action to increase the number of abortions.  They are lying about their motives, so we must find out what their true motives are.  I suggest, based on actual observable reality rather than their known lies, that their true motives are nothing but hate for women and sex.  Present empirical evidence to the contrary if you disagree.    Until that evidence exists, I see no reason not to assume that 100% of ""pro-lifers"" are not my enemy."
prochoice,3cdcje,FreedomsPower,3,Tue Jul 7 00:59:36 2015 UTC,"How has ""anti-abortion"" turned into ""anti-contraceptive""?  One article claimed that     The IUD is known as a long acting reversible contraception, and may even act as an abortifacient.   but to my knowledge, it's standard to do a pregnancy test before inserting an IUD - I was tested before mine was put in.  I haven't heard of IUDs being used as abortifacients, but at the very least they're not going to ""unknowingly kill [your] unborn child.""    As for IUDs having ""serious side effects"" - there are risks associated with IUDs, (although they're rare), and those risks are thoroughly explained to you before it's inserted.  Your GYN goes over them with you; there are pamphlets galore; you can even research it on the internet.  I know I'm preaching to the choir here, but I feel like conservatives should be happy about something that decreases teen abortion rates so drastically.  It worked in Colorado:     The birthrate for teenagers across the state plunged by 40 percent from 2009 to 2013, while their rate of abortions fell by 42 percent, according to the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment.     What are conservatives really after - more unplanned pregnancies?  Why would some one want that?  Also, what's with all the complaining about no soda or candy bars in schools?"
