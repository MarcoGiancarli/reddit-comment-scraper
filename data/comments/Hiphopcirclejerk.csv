Hiphopcirclejerk,3dqnne,turtlebait2,18,Sat Jul 18 14:51:10 2015 UTC,"Kendrick sits on the couch in the green room, covered in sweat. It's the last stop on the Yeezus tour. Kendrick has spent the last 2 months traveling across the country with his idol and mentor, Kanye West, who was currently on stage right now. The tour life can be exhausting, and also somewhat lonely. Kendrick hasn't seen or been in contact with Sherane in months, and his young libido was still beating. The road groupies sufficed for the time being, but there was a hole in Kendrick's heart. He needed more. He wanted more. He wanted Kanye. But he didn't know how to tell him. Kanye was married with children; Kendrick wasn't even entirely sure he was bisexual. But after seeing Kanye's interview on Kris Jenner, he thought maybe he had a chance. Kendrick looked into the mirror and began to cry. He knew that he could never have Kanye. He could never be with Kanye. Hell, he could never rap as well as Kanye. No matter how many syllables Kendrick spit, Kanye always beat him.  All of a sudden, Kendrick jumped a little as he felt strong hands grab his shoulders and start to massage them lightly. Once he recognized the hands as Kanye's, he relaxed and let his mentor take care of him. Before he knew it, trails of kisses were being traced down his neck and collarbone, only being briefly interrupted as Kanye slid Kendrick's shirt off of his chest. Kanye smiled and leaned into the caress. Kanye's lips moved to Kendrick's ear, ""Very nicely done tonight, by the way."" he laughed a bit before nibbling on his ear lobe. ""I fantasized 'bout this back in Chicago"" he whispered seductively into Kendrick's ear. Kendrick's only response was a soft moan as Kanye pulled him back towards him so Kendrick could clearly feel his growing erection pressed against him. ""Would you like some Yeezy in your Serato?"" Kanye teased as he kissed Kendrick chubby cheeks. Kendrick grinned and twisted his head so he could reach Ye's lips to kiss him. ""How do you say 'fuck me' in Spanish? Me no hablo."" they both laughed before they kissed again, softly. Ye kissed down Kendrick's chest, especially slowing down to pay attention to Kendrick's sensitive nipples. As he sucked gently, he looked at Kendrick's face. The way that he bit his lip and squirmed under Kanye's touch only egged him on further. His hand slipped down to the bulge in Kendrick's jeans and gently started to massage it gently as his mouth still moved slowly downward. As his tongue slid along Kendrick's abdominal muscles, he undid Kendrick's leather jogging pants and helped him to slide them and his pyrex vision boxers down to his ankles so he could more easily kick them off. Kanye took the head of Kendrick's penis into his mouth, swirling his tongue around it, making Kendrick elicit moans of pleasure to the sensation.  ""Ye, I know you want this dick..."" he breathed as he moved his hips up to try to encourage Kanye to take him in further. Ye removed his lips from Kendrick's head to lick along his shaft and take his scrotum into his mouth. He gently sucked on one of Kendrick's tesitcles at a time, making sure that he enjoyed the sensation, but that he was teasing him, just a bit. He used his right hand to massage Kendrick's testicles as he again wrapped his lips around the shaft of his long, slender penis. He took as much as he could into his mouth, having not managed to master the art of deepthroating yet, and bobbed his head slowly up and down, savoring Kendrick's salty taste and his every moan.  Kanye fed off of Kendrick's pleasure, doing his best to repeat every little thing he did that caused him to moan louder, squirm against the couch, or grip his hair tighter in pleasure. Kendrick moaned loudly again, panting. ""Fuck... Ye, I'm gonna... Fuck, I'm gonna cum..."" he exclaimed as his hips bucked, releasing streams of hot, sweet cum into Kanye's welcoming mouth. Kanye did his best to swallow it all, although a few drops dripped from his lips. After swallowing what was in his mouth, he greedily licked up the drops that spilled. Kendrick panted as Kanye kissed up his chest, more quickly than his earlier decent. His lips pressed against Kendrick's greedily, his own lust having grown from his pleasure derived from Kendrick's orgasm. He pulled away gently from the kiss, smiling down at Kendrick.  ""Is it my turn?"" he laughed as Kendrick nodded and stretched his neck to plant a kiss on Kanye jaw. All of a sudden, both Kendrick and Kanye were startled by the sound of something falling in the closet next to them. Out of nowhere, Schoolboy Q falls out of the closet, with his pants down around his ankles and his dick in his hand. Schoolboy had been in the closet masturbating to Ye and Kendrick the entire time. Schoolboy jumped up, screamed “GONORHERRA NIGGA SKEET SKEET” and ran out the door. Kendrick, Kanye, nor Schoolboy ever spoke of the event again."

Yeezus was a turning point in his career where he did an album for how he was feeling at the time and left all his pent up emotion on there.   -/r/hiphopheads

Hiphopcirclejerk,3ctrz2,Hellrazor25,7,Fri Jul 10 19:37:57 2015 UTC,"Unjerk/  Honestly I really do think TPaB is superior to GKMC. It's definitely less accessible off the bat and I didn't feel the same way when it first came out but I think it's absolutely the superior albim  But i really fucking liked that someone said GKMC was more accessible because unlike tpab it has ""trap"" beats lol"
Hiphopcirclejerk,3ctrz2,TimmTuesday,6,Sat Jul 11 03:37:38 2015 UTC,oh i agree 100%. TPAB is definitely a better album. i also think it's funny the guy who said it was awful said he only listened to it once.

Hiphopcirclejerk,3cpq42,anmolsdua,9,Thu Jul 9 21:26:14 2015 UTC,"I hate minions. I hate them so much, I hope they go to a misty yellow capitalist mainstream marketing hell. I don’t know who decided to wake up on one bright ass sunny morning and fling themselves out of bed, eat, and sit down at their desk to design a minion. The fact that some of them have one eye and some of them have two makes me want to bash my head into a brick wall. Who the fuck does that? You know you have children as viewers, why the hell would you trick people like that? God I fucking hate minions so much, stupid fucking anthropomorphic foam earplug pieces of shit go straight to hell, there is a special place in hell for minions. I hate how minions have taken over EVERYTHING in the marketing industry. Who in their right mind, as a designer, cartoonist, or anyone with the least bit common sense decides to pick up an HB pencil and make a sketch of an ugly, yellow tic tac looking creature with one eye and an ugly blue suit. Who the FUCK just wakes up and decides “Hey. I think I wanna design something uglier and more annoying than the crazy frog. It’s gonna be yellow, have an annoying ass voice, one eye, sometimes two, because I want to torture people, and a ridiculous costume. Who knows. Maybe one day, they’ll get their own MOVIE, because why the FUCK not.” I bet the designer of the minion’s mother regrets not letting her boyfriend pull out when he could have because she ended up having to carry a human who would create the prevalent downfall of this economy and world itself for 9 months straight. There’s minion themed shit everywhere. Mom posts on Facebook, on cereal boxes, on BILLBOARDS. There are even TIC TACS that look like minions. This shit needs to STOP. Minions are fucking disgusting. I can’t remember the last time I hated something relatively innocuous as much as I hate these Despicable Me minions. I think their voices are like Satan’s own, only multiplied by a million and pitched to sound like a pitchfork is simultaneously being rammed up each of their asses and down each and every one of their throats, if they even fucking have any. Each and every minion, whether it be on a school notebook, a shipment box, or a billboard, is the spawn of SATAN, not that big bitch named Gru or whatever the fuck his name was from Despicable Me. I want to pick up each and every minion and throw them into a flaming, erupting volcano and watch their yellow skin melt as their pathetic, pitched voices scream into the air for mercy. I have no mercy for minions. They are a nuisance, a pest to everything and anyone who breathes or fucking excretes. I wish the slowest and most painful death to all these ugly, annoying, idiotic and impudent little shits. Death to all minions."

Hiphopcirclejerk,3ck202,jerkbot-3hunna,8,Wed Jul 8 14:57:25 2015 UTC,"Let me interject here.   That literally was what killed rap.   Rap way back when it started was BECAUSE it was real. It was BECAUSE tupac shot a racist cop in the ass that we gave him credit. It was because wer knew how they grew up that we listened to them. You had to do some shit to actually get noticed. You had to archieve.   Right now, with DMX as a shinbing beacon of all the ""Look at me, i'm the greatest"" rappers , which all in all can no longer claim ""I'm from the street, I know how life is"" , and thus have switched to ""Look at me, i'm rich bitch and retarded"" being a literal crackhead ( Or is he clean again? Who the fuck knows or cares), you get the feeling that rap was cool in the same way wrestling was cool. As long as you held up the kayfabee, we came.   I still can smell to this day what the rock is cooking, you know?   Way back then, it was less about the ego trip, and more about if you actually had to say something. Take early 80's rap, and BANG, you could fill entire classroom presentations about the glory and the majesty of rap, and the poetry ( feck, I did it about 2pac way back when... 2 hour presentation)  But when the message became second rate, and the ego became most important, it took the same turn as wrestling. When today Kanye proclaims himself the biggest rock star of all times, I say sure man, in exactly the same tone as when an american that never travelled tells me pabst blue ribbon is the worlds best beer, or when a retarded child tells me he is the emperor of america. I humor him, because I know all that blow and that crack and ""Drank"" he did must have whittled his brain to the stem if his vocabulary is any indication.   Kanye as an artist has peaked. He has had hgis biggest hits, and even through the drugs and through his hedgehog of a wife, he realizes he has nothing more to say. And he is deadly afraid of that.   He is so afraid he is even stealing from the beatles ( who first were more popular then jesus), and solemly rides on controversy.   Right now, the state of rap with all of the self glorification and such is roughly comparable to the career of the undertaker now.   Rap still rides on the wave of popularity from way back then. Rap still pays just as much lip service to its former glory. You are asked to remember the Undertaker as much as tupac, and biggie just as much as macho man randy savage. But today, you look at bloated fake ass wannabees, and all you can do is shed a tear.   And don't get me wrong, I still like rap. And I even admit to enjoying a few kanyees tunes. But the next time you have it, listen to what you are actually listening to.   The beat is dope, but do we actually thank the beat man?   The video may be nice, but do we praise the videoman?   The dance may be sweet, burt do we praise the choreographer?   Nope. We praise the bloated aging wannabe, that tries to milk his audience one last time. Fear glazing over his eyes as he tries to rap lyrics that he payed actual rappers to write while he was in Milano premiering his newest collection of designer clothes that make you look like you shat yourself.   Back then, street was what you were. These were not multi millionaires that wanted to sound hard, theser were kids from the streets that just happened to be shoved on stage and handed a mike.   Today, rappers like Kanye made being street a gimmick, just like wrestling had the gimmicks. Perfectly fine if usedf in moderation, but if all you have is gimmick, it starts lookiung bad pretty soon.   So please, the next time you listen to kanyee, listen to how much original shit he has. How much he has to say that is not praise to his own ego, praise to his greatness, praise to his status, praise to his wife or praise to his ability.   If you find a song that has more then 5 lines original content, I will consider him a rapper. Untill then, he gets to be the worlds greatest pop star."

As there are several death threats in it, and I value my life dearly.  I will be pursuing criminal charges to the fullest extent the law allows.  (2) I am going to subpoena Reddit or your IP address and regular account user name.  I will ask that you be banded from the entire site permanently.  If they chose to not do this I will name Reddit in the same civil lawsuit I intend on filing against you for mental damages.  (3) when the police, the FBI, and Reddit all laugh... I am going to the news.  And trust me the news has a thing for cyber bullying right now.  And while I am a man of large stature, I'd love to watch you e eaten alive in the court of public opinion.  So here is it, your last chance; give me your full legal name, give me a fake address, give me your telephone number...  These will only be used, and I swear on my children, in pending litigation against you... If you don't stop.  If you want to continue this, you'll be responsible for your own undoing.  You have no idea the atrocities I am capable of.  If you truly knew me, you would have never started this. If you have a CCW, this is good.  If you carry a knife, even better.  You'll need them if you intend on stopping a man of my caliber.  And aim high, as that's the only way you'll ever stop me."

I'm well dressed (Gucci, Louis Vuitton, Prada, Hugo Boss, you name it), well groomed, wear the finest aftershave (or cologne as you call it across the pond) and have very little approach anxiety. My problem is occasional dips in self confidence. When I'm feeling confident I get girls. When I'm not feeling confident I don't, girls reject me just the same as you. I'll say the exact same things as I normally would but women can tell what kind of emotional state guys are coming from a mile away. The slightest hint of low confidence or neediness and you're done, it's as simple as that. For all their supposed empathy and sympathetic nature compared to men women are absolutely ruthless."

The Mountain Dew had been used by several of the group's members within the first three days of the Second RAPture and, without their usual abundance of empty calories and sugar, many had already been lost. Not many of the now-isolated fambruhs knew exactly what had warranted such a severe misfortune, but none were willing to part time from grieving their losses to find out. Faintly, one could hear the psychotic whispers of the unfortunate few who had already lost their minds to the madness; Sremmlife.... is... for... phaggs were words repeatedly echoed through the hallways, replacing what little sounds of vigor the house could groan out.  In the corner of the twicely abandoned country club was Yung Richard William III, an ex-Chief Keef enthusiast, now turned into a shivering husk from chronic Mixtape Withdrawal. Laying naked and afraid after being forced to burn his Neon Nike Foamposites and Versace-print joggers, Richard had given up what small sliver of dignity he had left for the temporary warmth of burning polyurethane. ""Who will help us?"" Richard feverishly cried out as the final symptoms rocked his deathbed toward its eventual end.  Suddenly, a sound of rushed footsteps came ever closer to the group, its source being the main corridor positioned on the opposite side of the door. Richard's eye had especially been fixated on that door ever since the Dew Shortage, in hopes of a bandit or thief sent to relieve them from this living hell. For the first time in weeks, Richard felt a dull surge of joy pulse through his body as the door slowly pried itself open.

A mod of /r/IAMA (/u/karmanaut) decided to make the sub private to make a statement about how terrible the admin-mod connections were. That was something most default sub moderators agreed with, so starting with /r/science which also has all these AMAs going on (again, with immense help from Victoria) made their subs private as a protest. I do agree that /r/nfl should stay clear of drama, but I also think that the issue mods are concerned over affects /r/nfl's mods too. At the end of the day, it should be the mods' decision."

I'm glad that this happened. A violent criminal is put behind bars, and my interpretation of the song is validated.  Bobby was always going to be a one hit wonder, this doesn't change anything. This just cements his small legacy in hip hop as ""that guy who managed to make a simplistic song all about killing people into a massive radio hit, then - surprise - turned out to be a violent criminal the whole time"". I wonder what the ridiculous popularity of this song says about the culture in 2014. it is kind of disturbing to be honest."

What history of Hip Hop are you reading? Hip Hop started off as party music, Sugar Hill Gang was partying and flossing on Rappers Delight. Hip Hop was hardly about intelligence, individualism or art. It wasn't until PE, BDP, Rakim and NWA did you really start getting different looks and sounds in Hip Hop.   The only time Hip Hop was about those ideals was the late 90s when the Real Hip Hop movement came on the scene. I should mention, of course, that was when Hip Hop was at one of it's lowest points, post Pac/BIG and pre Dre's 2001. Hip Hop was created to express oneself. Whether it was getting the party started, macking a girl, banging on wax, balling or being socially conscious.  As far as this progression in style and talent being nearly unparalleled in the History of Hip Hop, I will definitely disagree. What is going on today in no way touches what was happening in Hip Hop from 92-97. The progression of style from the 80s, in the introduction of G-Funk, the escape from Boom Bap and happy-go-lucky Native Tongues style into the grimey sound of the East Coast Hip Hop, the emergence of the South and Mid West sounds and styles. Dudes like Dre, Snoop, Quik, Pac, Cube, E-40, BIG, Mobb Deep, Wu-Tang, Nas, Common, MC Breed, DJ Screw, Outkast, Scarface, Master P... just to name a few. The talent pool was nuts."

Ye knew the album was ahead of its time, like with all the others, but took it on himself to drop that joint anyway and absorb the initial backlash for releasing anything not related to the pink-polo, sped-up-soul-sample, poor-but-upstanding-black-kid-from-Chicago College Dropout days (like usual) to release some real sht that made people mad because they had to think and critique our broken society. Like it or not, Yeezus paved the way for other cerebral rappers to retake at least part the stage without getting the hate from typical confused people talking out of their buttcracks because they had already spent it on him. Yeezus didn't invent cerebral rap, just helped save it from underground limbo imo.""  Best post in that thread by far"

Hiphopcirclejerk,3aznaz,rapgamecamus,35,Wed Jun 24 20:02:12 2015 UTC,"Here's the thing. You said a ""Rae Sremmurd is a talented duo."" Has it been enjoyed before? Yes. No one's arguing that.  As someone who is a poweruser who studies trash gimmicks, I am telling you, specifically, in the rap game, no one calls Rae Sremmurd talented. If you want to be ""specific"" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing, fambruh.  If you're saying ""talented artist"" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of GOATs, which includes things from ""Kanye West"" to ""Kenny Lam Lam"" to ""Chance the Rapper"".  So your reasoning for calling Rae Sremmurd talented is because random music critics ""call Rae Sremmurd talented?"" Let's get ""Hopsin"" and ""Macklemore"" in there, then, too.  Also, calling someone a talented artist or a GOAT? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A talented artist is a talented artist and a member of the GOAT family. But that's not what you said. You said Rae Sremmurd is a talented artist, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the Sremmurd family talented musicians, which means you'd call Hopsin's new single, a G-Eazy album, and even any other white rappers talented musicians, too.   Which you said you don't.  It's okay to just admit you're wrong, you know?"
Hiphopcirclejerk,3aznaz,BaconChapstick,8,Wed Jun 24 22:34:40 2015 UTC,"Man.... I don't know. I must be the only one here who thinks these guys are absolute trash gimmicks with no talent whatsoever. I didn't make it through the entire album because they're so god damn awful. They say the most middle school shit I have ever heard. Their lyrics are on par with just about some of the worst, I want to say, in rap history. I see no appeal, whatsoever, in their music. To me, SOLELY sounding catchy doesn't cut it. These guys are just a big flop for me. I sincerely tried to listen to them. 0.5/10"
Hiphopcirclejerk,3aznaz,fichii,13,Thu Jun 25 00:09:04 2015 UTC,"So I was standing in a rather large line at my local Best Buy today behind a couple fambruhs that I know from when I went to that Weezy concert in year younger. It was the only register open so there wasn't much of another option to get my copy of Bino's Because the Internet for the slapper rotation in the whip. I was wondering why the line was going nowhere when I decided to poke my head up front to see what the holdup was. It was a backpacker 30-something year old guy who couldn't believe the store didn't have any music by some rapper named Mobb Deep. This struck me as odd until I found out he was such an old head that he didn't even know he could easily download his music on iTunes. Now all these fambruhs were just staring and there was even two making fun of him. I walked up and handed my CD to the cashier, handed him the itunes giftcard I received for Christmas, and told her to keep the change. One of the fambruhs (I knew these guys from the concert like I said, so I also knew that their parents all make over 6 digits) yelled very loudly, ""See that nathan? He's acting just like Yeezus wants us to."" For some reason this set me off, so I turned around. I haven't shaved in awhile so I'm rocking some nice scruff, a Pink Dolphin tank, and corduroy pants, so it must have been a nice sight. Very loudly, I said ""Like Yeezus? bruh I'm a teenager who makes minimum wage and I was the one who stepped up to help a fambruh? Your hypocritical dickridding is an inspiration to us all."" As I stormed out, a couple of the cart boys started to whistle and cheer, soon shoppers joined in and even the cashier. I gave a wave and went off with a feeling of accomplishment."

Trash gimmicks.  These people want to destroy those of you who say the most middle school shit they've ever heard and control the rest. You've seen them talk on reddit and twitter, they will happily put you to death if they could and SOLELY sound catchy while doing so. Trash gimmicks are the front of a much larger war. It does not begin or end with trash gimmicks and if you don't fight you are going to lose so much more than just lyrics on par with just about some of the worst, I want to say, in rap history. This is the end of the war, they have been winning it for years. Sremmlife was a surprise resistance that popped up after our ""forces"" had been routed and slaughtered on the altar of no talent whatsoever for decades. If you want to live in a world where some big flop and his middle school shit can say ""I sincerely tried to listen to them"" and not make it through the entire album then yeah sure do nothing just protect the trash gimmicks I guess. If that idea disgusts you then it is time to stand up if you haven't already and fight them on every level. Remember the Sremmlife discussion thread? Remember how they made a motherfucking rap group cry on what should have been the best album of their life? Over middle school shit?

Jazz critics have long recognized that the greatest jazz musicians of all times are Duke Ellington and John Coltrane, who were not the most famous or richest or best sellers of their times, let alone of all times. Classical critics rank the highly controversial Beethoven over classical musicians who were highly popular in courts around Europe. Rock critics are still blinded by commercial success: the Beatles sold more than anyone else (not true, by the way), therefore they must have been the greatest. Jazz critics grow up listening to a lot of jazz music of the past, classical critics grow up listening to a lot of classical music of the past. Rock critics are often totally ignorant of the rock music of the past, they barely know the best sellers. No wonder they will think that the Beatles did anything worth of being saved."

Hiphopcirclejerk,3abmuk,sulfuricacidrap,10,Thu Jun 18 19:58:57 2015 UTC,"Kendrick sits on the couch in the green room, covered in sweat. It's the last stop on the Yeezus tour. Kendrick has spent the last 2 months traveling across the country with his idol and mentor, Kanye West, who was currently on stage right now. The tour life can be exhausting, and also somewhat lonely. Kendrick hasn't seen or been in contact with Sherane in months, and his young libido was still beating. The road groupies sufficed for the time being, but there was a hole in Kendrick's heart. He needed more. He wanted more. He wanted Kanye. But he didn't know how to tell him. Kanye was married with children; Kendrick wasn't even entirely sure he was bisexual. But after seeing Kanye's interview on Kris Jenner, he thought maybe he had a chance. Kendrick looked into the mirror and began to cry. He knew that he could never have Kanye. He could never be with Kanye. Hell, he could never rap as well as Kanye. No matter how many syllables Kendrick spit, Kanye always beat him. All of a sudden, Kendrick jumped a little as he felt strong hands grab his shoulders and start to massage them lightly. Once he recognized the hands as Kanye's, he relaxed and let his mentor take care of him. Before he knew it, trails of kisses were being traced down his neck and collarbone, only being briefly interrupted as Kanye slid Kendrick's shirt off of his chest. Kanye smiled and leaned into the caress. Kanye's lips moved to Kendrick's ear, ""Very nicely done tonight, by the way."" he laughed a bit before nibbling on his ear lobe. ""I fantasized 'bout this back in Chicago"" he whispered seductively into Kendrick's ear. Kendrick's only response was a soft moan as Kanye pulled him back towards him so Kendrick could clearly feel his growing erection pressed against him. ""Would you like some Yeezy in your Serato?"" Kanye teased as he kissed Kendrick chubby cheeks. Kendrick grinned and twisted his head so he could reach Ye's lips to kiss him. ""How do you say 'fuck me' in Spanish? Me no hablo."" they both laughed before they kissed again, softly. Ye kissed down Kendrick's chest, especially slowing down to pay attention to Kendrick's sensitive nipples. As he sucked gently, he looked at Kendrick's face. The way that he bit his lip and squirmed under Kanye's touch only egged him on further. His hand slipped down to the bulge in Kendrick's jeans and gently started to massage it gently as his mouth still moved slowly downward. As his tongue slid along Kendrick's abdominal muscles, he undid Kendrick's leather jogging pants and helped him to slide them and his pyrex vision boxers down to his ankles so he could more easily kick them off. Kanye took the head of Kendrick's penis into his mouth, swirling his tongue around it, making Kendrick elicit moans of pleasure to the sensation. ""Ye, I know you want this dick..."" he breathed as he moved his hips up to try to encourage Kanye to take him in further. Ye removed his lips from Kendrick's head to lick along his shaft and take his scrotum into his mouth. He gently sucked on one of Kendrick's tesitcles at a time, making sure that he enjoyed the sensation, but that he was teasing him, just a bit. He used his right hand to massage Kendrick's testicles as he again wrapped his lips around the shaft of his long, slender penis. He took as much as he could into his mouth, having not managed to master the art of deepthroating yet, and bobbed his head slowly up and down, savoring Kendrick's salty taste and his every moan. Kanye fed off of Kendrick's pleasure, doing his best to repeat every little thing he did that caused him to moan louder, squirm against the couch, or grip his hair tighter in pleasure. Kendrick moaned loudly again, panting. ""Fuck... Ye, I'm gonna... Fuck, I'm gonna cum..."" he exclaimed as his hips bucked, releasing streams of hot, sweet cum into Kanye's welcoming mouth. Kanye did his best to swallow it all, although a few drops dripped from his lips. After swallowing what was in his mouth, he greedily licked up the drops that spilled. Kendrick panted as Kanye kissed up his chest, more quickly than his earlier decent. His lips pressed against Kendrick's greedily, his own lust having grown from his pleasure derived from Kendrick's orgasm. He pulled away gently from the kiss, smiling down at Kendrick. ""Is it my turn?"" he laughed as Kendrick nodded and stretched his neck to plant a kiss on Kanye jaw. All of a sudden, both Kendrick and Kanye were startled by the sound of something falling in the closet next to them. Out of nowhere, Schoolboy Q falls out of the closet, with his pants down around his ankles and his dick in his hand. Schoolboy had been in the closet masturbating to Ye and Kendrick the entire time. Schoolboy jumped up, screamed “GONORHERRA NIGGA SKEET SKEET” and ran out the door. Kendrick, Kanye, nor Schoolboy ever spoke of the event again."

Hiphopcirclejerk,3a7vju,Snackhat,7,Thu Jun 18 05:13:18 2015 UTC,wow 4chan commenters are really shitty lol
Hiphopcirclejerk,3a7vju,nnotserPx,7,Thu Jun 18 02:01:08 2015 UTC,it's no different than HHH.
Hiphopcirclejerk,3a7vju,chajimak,11,Thu Jun 18 03:47:28 2015 UTC,yes it is lol
Hiphopcirclejerk,3a7vju,slugga_slugga,4,Thu Jun 18 04:53:51 2015 UTC,Kinda
Hiphopcirclejerk,3a7vju,danrman,5,Thu Jun 18 05:24:04 2015 UTC,"How?  They're both filled with their own memes and they both have incredibly stupid users (white teenagers)  At least 4chan KNOWS it's shit, unlike HHH where the users don't.  4chan threads seem worse because they don't have a filtering system (upvote/downvote) so you get everything, even the shit that would be downvoted to death on reddit.  4chan users are also self aware.  They know they're being racist/misogynistic vs HHH's subtlety (or not so subtle)   Yes there are stupid posts made on 4chan, calling people autistic, the nword, whatever.... But is it really different than this (what it said before being removed), this, when HHH discussed ""keep it 300, like the Romans, those stupid fucking reactions and homeboys ""pimp guides"", and one of the most HHH posts, We should start a Militia to Protect Kanye West...  Also the comment where the kid called Drake the best rapper ever unironically and said guys like Snoop and Dre or (or some other 90s rapper held high) weren't as good as him, but I've spent way too much time on this comment already to find it."
Hiphopcirclejerk,3a7vju,chajimak,7,Thu Jun 18 11:06:26 2015 UTC,yeah i think that three quarters of the comments in this 4chan thread were worse than calling drake the best rapper ever but maybe our priorities lie in different places
Hiphopcirclejerk,3a7vju,EricWasAnHero,2,Thu Jun 18 13:29:05 2015 UTC,"Check /new on reddit. Plenty of shit comments/posts, 4chan just doesn't hide them with up/downvotes. Most threads aren't like that in /mu/ (not as extreme atleast), this is just an obvious meme post. Just like memes and Twitter screenshots have shit discussion and comments on reddit. When you go into an actual thread on mu, fa, graphic design, photo board, etc; there are nice discussions. Plus, you can discover new artists or whatever, because there are no real top comments/posts with the same 10 or 20 artists the whole time hiding the good quality less known people.   TL DR memes = bad discussion on all mediums, good posts on 4chan are better than reddit. Sorry for gettin all serious on hhcj lol"
Hiphopcirclejerk,3a7vju,Psychoti,7,Thu Jun 18 13:42:46 2015 UTC,"i'm neither ignorant of 4chan nor /new on reddit, i just think the guy i replied to was really equating apples and oranges with respect to types of shitposting.   Plus, you can discover new artists or whatever, because there are no real top comments/posts with the same 10 or 20 artists the whole time hiding the good quality less known people.   how much time have you spent on /mu/ compared to other music related boards (non-reddit)?  it's really not very good for discovering new music in my experience, and often devolves into the same artists being talked about time and again."
Hiphopcirclejerk,3a7vju,EricWasAnHero,1 point,Thu Jun 18 13:53:18 2015 UTC,"True. I don't go on often, so there are still tons of artists for me to look at. Never really been on music boards other than reddit and mu :/"

Hiphopcirclejerk,3a7vju,ErykahBaduisagoddess,4,Fri Jun 19 04:12:40 2015 UTC,So I'm a racist for acknowledging that reddit and 4chan are predominately white? And are thus more than likely the stupid things said about another race's culture are going to come from the majority?  I'm fucking white.  You're really going to call me a racist against my own race?

Hiphopcirclejerk,3a7vju,ErykahBaduisagoddess,3,Fri Jun 19 04:31:35 2015 UTC,"Lol I'm just making a broad statement, obviously other people of different races can say stupid things.
