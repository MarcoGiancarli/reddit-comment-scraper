Shoplifting,3e5tk0,stalk_craft,2,Wed Jul 22 04:51:46 2015 UTC,"This might not be return fraud. It completely depends on what the warranty is. A lot of warranties are simply ""you can return it no questions asked within X amount of days"".   Now if he's going in and saying ""it's broken"", then yes that's illegal. It's damn near impossible to convict someone of return fraud in a scenario like that though, because they'd have to prove you knew it wasn't broken, and that you're not just stupid."

Have fun on probation and finding a job with felony theft in your record (you will never work retail in your life).   And you're 21,not some stupid teenager. Man up and take your punishment"
Shoplifting,3du5iq,VanillaThnder,20,Sun Jul 19 20:47:46 2015 UTC,"HAHAHAHA you're a fucking idiot. I bet who ever told you that Target has no security was probably a Target LP or just someone who wanted to see you get caught. Either way I want to buy that guy a drink because he's a fucking genius.  I'm an LP but not for Target but I'll clarify a few things for you. Store security is allowed to tackle and handcuff you. I've done it before and we don't get in trouble for it. Stores in the area will send BOLOs out for people they weren't able to catch. You were stealing hundreds of dollars worth of blu rays at a time, you were number one on their shit list. The retailer I work for gets alerts from other retailers and police all the time, even from our biggest competitors. So even though we compete sales wise, our LP teams talk to each other.  You're 21 and you're a legal adult which means you get to face adult consequences and punishments. Take responsibility for what you have done and stop acting like a child. I'm not just saying this because I do LP and I don't like theft. I'm saying this because you made a choice and now you have to face the music. Welcome to the cold world of adulthood."
Shoplifting,3du5iq,growing_lemons776,19,Mon Jul 20 04:16:01 2015 UTC,"I did reserach and read that it was easy to steal from Target because they have no security other than the people that stand at the door   Are you fucking retarded? Rule #1 of the Internet: NEVER BELIEVE EVERYTHING YOU READ. Rule #1 of shoplifting: Always assume that every camera is real, and that everyone around you is LP. I know it doesn't sound very practical to be paranoid constantly, but it prevents shit like this from happening.   the retail value of what I took that day alone was $1200 so I was charged with grand larceny (a felony).    Did you not know this? This is why you don't get cocky. I have a general rule of not going past $200 whenever I go out lifting by myself.   I'm hoping they reduce the charges and go easy on me because I'm only 21 and kids are supposed to fuck up and do dumb shit.   You're a man. Not a kid. Take some fucking responsibility. You got cocky, now you're paying the price for it."

Shoplifting,3du5iq,randomacc435,3,Mon Jul 20 02:46:06 2015 UTC,"To everyone saying I'm not a kid. I realize that, it was a poor choice of words on my part. What I'm saying is I'm a young adult and I have never been arrested before so I am hoping they show me leniency. Anyway, I had my first meeting with my attorney today to go over everything and he said he wants to see if the DA is willing to offer me a plea deal and drop the felony charge so that all I will plea to is the petit larceny charges. He said Target is known for actually following through with prosecution of shoplifting and having their security people actually show up to court to testify and provide video footage unlike other retailers. He said since the odds are Target will most likely show up at court and bring the videos of me stealing that going to trial is not a viable option for me. He also said I never should have signed that form admitting to the theft. What is making me really nervous is that the court may look at my case as being ""Organized Retail Crime"" related since I was stealing the shit to sell it and make a profit. He says he doubts it will happen since I wasn't working with anyone else to steal, but it's possible. I guess stealing shit to sell it is a bigger deal than just stealing it for yourself. Not sure why, stealing is stealing in my eyes. Why does me trying to cash in on it make it ""more serious""? My first court date is next Monday, so hopefully I can just get probation or some shit and move on with my life."

Shoplifting,3du5iq,VioletCovington,2,Tue Jul 21 03:09:35 2015 UTC,Consider talking to a therapist or counselor. It's a long shot but it can work in your favor to help prove you're serious about getting help and addressing any mental health issues that might have led to you having such a horrible lapse in judgement. My BBF's ex did something similar when he was arrested on a fairly serious drug charge. Everyone could use a little therapy anyway. Good luck to you.
Shoplifting,3du5iq,Theist17,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:15:14 2015 UTC,"I think that they view it as more serious when you steal to sell because you're supplying a market for stolen goods, thus creating a demand for thieves such as yourself, and perpetuating that cycle on a local level.

Shoplifting,3dhrcz,Forlifter,5,Thu Jul 16 11:14:25 2015 UTC,"I added paragraphing/formatting. You're welcome :)  Hello, so I'm rly bored and decided to do a mini tutorial on how to shoplift clothes. Of course, this is for educational purposes only and completely theoretical and I do not, by any means, advocate shoplifting.  Okay so, a few things to note before you hit the store:  1. Tags on clothes  2. Counting at changing rooms   Before you hit the store, you have to make sure if the clothes have tags on them or not. Most of the time, stores use a variety of tags that can be solved with a hook or some really strong magnets n52 magnets). I'm not too sure about how strong and how many the magnets need to be so if someone can clear the air that would be great, but I've tried with 2 small bars of n52 but they're not strong enough. The hook is relatively simple, you can just buy it from aliexpress for a really cheap price. If the clothes have no tags, all the better for you. Assuming the majority of stores have changing rooms, because it'd be silly to not have them, try to brjng a bunch of clothes to the rooms. If you're planning to lift one item, then bring 5 items to the changing room, preferably of similar colour to the one you plan to lift.   Most of the time, there are staff who would count your items or even take them from you. What I've found that works relatively well would be to just bring in 6 items and say you only have 5 with the one hidden somewhere where it cannot be seen. Sometimes, staff are only trying to be helpful and if there is a maximum to the number of clothes you are bringing in, say 10 pieces, saying you have 10 pieces will prevent them from counting how many you actually have. If they choose to take it from you, you can try to bring in a hoodie and place your item within it. However, I'd advise against it because in the event it does fall out, well you're fucked.   So what I usually do is I go with a friend, and when I bring in a few items, I'd try a few and then show them to my friend who will say it doesn't fit very nicely. I'd then proceed to bring in a number of clothes rapidly. Most of the time, the staff won't even bother to count it anymore. When removing tags, make sure that you check every inch of clothing before bagging it. Some clothes might have two tags by accident and you can never be too sure. With the removed tags, you can either clip them to another piece of clothing or bring it out and hide it somewhere. What I like to do is to pretend I'm considering a few pieces and bring it with me, and then dump them back amongst the clothes shelves with the tags hidden inside.  Lastly, walk out smooth as fuck (;"
Shoplifting,3dhrcz,DrugsAndPipeBombs,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:06:49 2015 UTC,"You need a golf detacher for most magnetic tags. For beginners reading this: I wouldn't recommend carrying a magnet or hook (for super tags). If you're caught with it that's pretty much a guaranteed felony charge for burglary (bringing a tool = intent to shoplift). Good luck qualifying for a diversion program or getting your charge expunged with that. Also, they're LOUD and fucking STRONG. It's hard to be discreet with one of those things, especially if you happen to be near a piece of metal and the magnet practically jumps out of your hand and sticks to said metal (SWIM might have had this happen with the frame of mirror in a fitting room). If you really want clothes that are tagged carry a small sewing kit with a seam ripper. Make a small cut as close to the tag as possible and slip it off. I obviously wouldn't do that with very high end clothing but if you're in a typical mall store it's not a big deal, the tiny sewed hole won't be that noticeable."

Shoplifting,3ctxv4,senses3,-3,Sat Jul 11 14:16:33 2015 UTC,It happens quite often at grocery stores and the like. I was stealing soap once and it happened to me. That's the first and last time I get caught without running.

Shoplifting,3ctxv4,growing_lemons776,2,Sat Jul 11 18:22:30 2015 UTC,"It depends on the policy of the store. They may send you a civil demand letter. If they do, pay it and move on. If you don't pay they will get the courts involved. With the civil demand you won't have any kind of charges on your record and it will be like nothing happened. When I did LP at groceries stores I was working through a 3rd party company and not the store itself and we would charge $150 for the civil demand regardless of the cost of the item. Before someone asks, yes we legally could charge that much. The state law allows it.  However the LP could have been taking down your information to file a report with the police later. With my current company if I catch someone under $150 I just take their information, let them go, and go to the magistrate to file charges because I know the police won't arrest them for under $150 unless they have prior charges or a warrant or something. Did the LP ask for your driver's license?"

Shoplifting,3cu7nv,TheTragedyLever,10,Fri Jul 10 20:32:46 2015 UTC,My outside camera is hella good. I can read the plates of cars at the Stoplights near my store.  If I know you stole and somehow can't stop you (waiting for a confirmation of things missing in the fitting room)  I'll call dispatch and give them your car information and direction of travel and/or send your photo out to local stores.
Shoplifting,3cu7nv,VanillaThnder,7,Fri Jul 10 22:16:53 2015 UTC,"Yes if a store has PTZ cameras inside they will also have cameras outside in the parking lots. Usually they are good quality with high powered zoom and it's very easy to get a license plate. If I can't make an arrest for whatever reason I will just call the police, let them watch the video of the theft, and then they have reasonable grounds to pull you over or goto your house and arrest you. This is pretty common at my store."
Shoplifting,3cu7nv,lpdetective,5,Sat Jul 11 20:28:24 2015 UTC,"It depends on the store. But you also have to remember something. Even if they don't get your license plate, they can still likely track you on camera to your car. If you've hit stores multiple times, they are probably just burning the footage to a disk and tallying up the costs. I have several regular thieves in my store who I don't even mess with if I just see them going out the door. I backtrack footage, get video, get faceshots (most retailers have pretty good door cameras) get vehicle description, and turn it over to local PD. The cops do the work for me, and I just see them in court. Oftentimes, I'll wait until they've either done it several times, or it totals up to a felony amount. Some states can bump theft up to felony charges if the subject has done it three or more times."
