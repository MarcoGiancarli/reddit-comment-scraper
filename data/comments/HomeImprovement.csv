Or 2x4 laid sideways   It's like 1-3/4 +1/2 + 3/4 and you're close enough to even.   Take up the baseboards first then put them back in with some quarter round if the height isn't perfect. You can use color matching caulk if you don't like the look of quarter round
HomeImprovement,3e3thk,Dont-be_an-Asshole,2,Tue Jul 21 22:13:05 2015 UTC,"Plywood of varying thicknesses would do the trick. Or rip 2x4s down as slats (1.25"" thick with 1/2"" ply) and put plywood on top of them, might save a bit of money over using straight plywood, but it would definitely add more labor hours.  You're still going to need a reducer because you have 2 heights. Make the floor flush with the lower one and use a reducer on the higher one."

The work you are attempting to do know is likely introducing more lead dust into the environment than had you simply left it on the walls.  In addition to protecting the room, make sure tou protect yourself with the proper protective equipment, and make sure that you are properly decontaminating yourself when you leave the work area, otherwise, you may as well rip down any of the protective measures you are currently using.  If you have not done so, take a look at some of these resources on lead paint: http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/program_offices/healthy_homes/healthyhomes/lead  http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/documents/huddoc?id=DOC_11876.pdf  http://www.cpsc.gov/Global/Safety%20Education/Furniture%20Furnishings%20Decorations/426ProtectYourFamilyFromLeadinYourHome.pdf  Your best bet is to leave the paint alone provided it is not chipping or peeling off.    You may be able to skim coat over the wall, but doing this properly requires some skill.  It also creates a situation where if the skim coat chips off it could expose your child to lead if they decide that the plaster looks like a yummy potato chip."

I tried doing a similar thing with a textured wall a while back, and it wound up looking like a finished adobe wall. Thankfully the guy I was doing it for liked the mission-style look.  My two cents is that if you are going to be in the house a while, get the lead stuff out now. If you eventually sell, you'll have to disclose that you covered over paint you suspected contained lead."

The way I got around it was to fix all the issues myself then have the realtor and buyer re-inspect the issues.  Once they were satisfied, the inspection report was removed from the contract.  That fixed the problem.  What makes this a major problem is the mortgage company will only raise the red flag at closing.  As they're going through the documentation they will ask for receipts from the contractors.  If you can't provide them they will state that there is no proof the issues were fixed professionally and they will decline the mortgage.  This happens A LOT.  Don't get caught out.

If the outlet in question is not accessible (behind furniture), then it goes in the report as further investigation. Cantilevering a countertop 16"" is not typical.

HomeImprovement,3e4j3c,Sloth_love_Chunk,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:17:47 2015 UTC,"You are right about the fire hazard, and the price difference. But cedar shake has a higher wind rating, a higher hail rating and a WAY higher R rating (insulation) than asphalt shingles.     Also, picture a 1930's character home, with cedar siding and a 2015 asphalt roof... Looks wrong.      I appreciate your input, but it's not even close that cut and dry."
HomeImprovement,3e4j3c,Sloth_love_Chunk,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:29:46 2015 UTC,"You're right about the fire hazard and insects do tend to like them. But the type of people who like wood roofs usually aren't concerned with that.   There is nothing wrong with a wood roof. Using the right quality of wood, with a good install and proper maintenance a cedar roof is better than asphalt in many ways. A 3/4"" cedar roof actually out performs most asphalt roofs when it comes to wind and hail. Asphalt attracts heat to the house. Wood is an insulator. Wood also breathes better, minimizing moisture in the building envelope. That 50 year asphalt roof your dad got, is not really a 50 year shingle. Read that warranty carefully. I'd put money on Good quality Cedar (with proper maintenance and properly installed) outlasting that ""50 year"" asphalt roof. I know of cedar roofs that are 80-90+ years old.  Don't get me wrong, I'm an asphalt guy. In many ways I prefer it. I install 100s of asphalt roofs a year. I believe in the 50 year shingle (put it on my own house). But I'm under no delusions that is will actually last 50 years. Seen way to many premature roof failures and those warranties are sketchy as shit. For certain people, cedar is the way to go and I'm more than happy to install the 2-3 a year we get."

HomeImprovement,3e3qnw,upstateduck,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:15:26 2015 UTC,"I had a casual conversation with an AC tech about moving the ducts and he brought up a few issues and suggested that for the cost of moving the ducts I could likely hire a contractor to do the floor.   Issues he brought up:  First, given the amount of existing ductwork and the need to move them high enough to be practicable will entail a non-trivial cost. Second, because in unfinished attics temperature rises sharply with height, cooling costs will rise. Third, along with moving through higher temperatures the added pressure/resistance of the longer lengths will decrease efficiency and raise costs.

HomeImprovement,3e3qnw,Chase003,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:40:07 2015 UTC,"Hate to put it bluntly, but your ""AC tech"" is wrong. Duct are required to be hung by code, it actually gets cooler the higher up in the attic you go (due to fresh air coming in from turbines/roof ridges at the top), and it is much more resistance having your ducts go roller coaster over each and every rafter. As for the ""different temperatures and forces"" preventing you from making splices....well I think that guy is just trying to blow a lot of hot attic air up your backside.  But yes it would be advisable for a reputable contractor to do it, however if you are handy than it really isn't that hard. If you are going to get a contractor to do it though, they should run a few large ducts (12""-16"") that tie into remote plenums situated near the areas they cool with smaller ducts running off them to tie them into the individual rooms."

HomeImprovement,3e2zug,mattlreese,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:36:20 2015 UTC,I am working on my crawlspace over time. The walls had 2 inch foam on them when I bought it. Last year I had people install pieces of foam over the rim joists and on top of the foundation. All seams are foamed. So the insulation is continuous from the dirt up to the floor. The next step is to clean it out and level the dirt floor. I plan on using some sort of reinforced plastic material to cover the dirt. I will run it up the walls a bit. I plan on using some sort of foam to attach the plastic to the concrete footings where they meet the wood supports. I do not want the wood being in a humid environment.
HomeImprovement,3e2zug,n609mike,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:20:05 2015 UTC,"I'm not absolutely certain, but I believe the building code does not allow foam insulation if it isn't covered by a fire-rated layer (i.e. sheetrock) anywhere, including in the crawl space.  - Actually, I think there is an exception for a flash coat at the rim board. -    Foam gives off toxic fumes when it burns, and you are more likely to never get out of the house if the fire gets to the foam before you get out.  You might want to double-check that I'm right, as the fire code is an area of the code I don't work with regularly.  And yes, it's generally better to insulate the walls and keep the crawl space insulated rather than the floor - at least in my region which has cold winters."
HomeImprovement,3e2zug,Brad221,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:06:45 2015 UTC,I think you are right. In a different area we used the foil covered foam because of the fire rating.

HomeImprovement,3e2zug,n609mike,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:54:02 2015 UTC,"Yes. You will notice the difference. We also used 6mil poly. Just make sure that you install the plastic with surgical precision. Get it tight to the exterior wall; don't cut it sloppily. Be neat; use ground staples to hold it in place, and if you're going to store stuff down there or be walking all over it, put down some carpet scraps to protect it. I had a small work shop in my barely 6' clearance crawlspace. I put in a long worktable that hung on the wall rather than sitting on the ground. And I bought some rigid insulation to put beneath the outdoor carpet I bought, just as an extra measure against cutting or damaging the plastic. Anyway, it's a worthwhile investment."

HomeImprovement,3e2lfv,davidstvz,4,Tue Jul 21 14:50:44 2015 UTC,"The original home wiring was 14-3   The original house wiring was 14-3.  But you said you ran a new 14-3 wire to the fan.  What went to the fan before?  What was in the switch box before?  It sounds like it was a 3-way switch (meaning the fan was controlled from two locations with both locations cutting off the lights and fan together).  If that's the case, you're going to have issues because your new switch is not a 3-way switch.  If you had a standard 2-way switch then your new switch simply gets the black from the house to the black on the switch (that's where the juice comes from) and red to red or black on your new 14-3 wire and yellow to red or black on your new 14-3 wire depending on which controls light or fan on the other end.  And all the greens/grounds bundled together, and any whites (separately) bundled.    Problem is, if the house's already installed 14-3 was part of a 3-way circuit, you'll have to figure that out and bypass the old 3-way switch (this will involve removing the other switch, twisting blacks together and capping the unused red and sealing the box with a solid cover and then in the new switch box capping the unused red).  Alternately, you can leave the other 3-way switch where it is, cap the house red in the fancy new switch's box and the remaining switch would function to shut off both the fan and light (overriding the fancy new switch).  Look at the plain old light switch you removed.  Does it have an on/off label etched into the plastic of the switch like this:  http://newyorknyhomeowner.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Switch-from-Lancet.jpg  If not, then it was a 3-way switch and you should have another 3-way switch somewhere."
HomeImprovement,3e2lfv,rxrus2,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:16:08 2015 UTC,"Fan is a new install, no light fixture in the room. Before the switch box was a switch that controlled the top half of the outlets in the room.   My thinking was to connect the old on/off wires to the hot wire so the outlets have full power always, and connect the old hot wires to the fan so that it can have power even without the light.  I was also planning on hooking up the original black (on/off with the outlets in the room) to the hot wire to fully power them then have the light switch hook up to the black (original on/off).   So would I wire the black return wire from the switch in with the hot wires to supply power to the switch?  Thank you so much for your help! I was hoping this would be a quick question haha"
HomeImprovement,3e2lfv,davidstvz,2,Tue Jul 21 15:18:47 2015 UTC,"Ok, so the switch box has your new 14-3 wire, and just one other 14-3 wire (the old one)?  There's no 14-2 as well?  And it used to switch outlets on and off (whether top half or full; no matter)?  If that's the case, That would mean that box has incoming hot power on either red or black and outgoing switched power used to go to the outlets on the remaining color (red or black).  And the ground and neutral/white should be functional.  IF that is correct, you would twist the house's red and black together with the black on your fancy new switch.  That would make the outlets always-on and provide hot power to the new switch.  Then the switch handles getting the power to the fan via your new 14-3 wire with yellow/black controlling the lights and red/red controlling the fan.  Bundle the whites and bundle the grounds.  At the ceiling, the red would go to the fan's wire and the black to the lights (check the fan's manual to see which color is lights and which is fan).

This assumes that OP described the original set up accurately AND whoever originally wired this set up didn't do anything nutty.  It's that last part that would have me double checking it all with a meter first, especially if it was an old house.

HomeImprovement,3e0ul2,DoingHippoThings,5,Tue Jul 21 02:21:22 2015 UTC,I love your garage floor. Was it a concrete base when you started? What steps did you take to achieve that look?
HomeImprovement,3e0ul2,D3fected,2,Tue Jul 21 14:18:05 2015 UTC,"Yep it was concrete, packed with dirt and oil stains. I bought a rustoleum epoxy kit from Lowe's (or maybe it was Home Depot) that was enough for a 2 car garage. First and most important step is cleaning the floor; everywhere o read online said it should take just as long or longer to clean the floor as it is to do the epoxy, because if its not clean enough the epoxy will just bubble/peel off. So to clean...    Grabbed a power washer, soaked the floor. Scrubbed the floor with a course scrubber and degreaser. Powerwash floor, rinse, and repeat. Did that twice.    Then I used an acid etcher (rustoleum sells these too for the kit, Lowes/HD should have them), washed with power washer, then repeated.    Once it was dry (the next day), I started putting the epoxy down with a roller. Helpful to have someone following you sprinkling the color chips because it dries fast.    Edit: I also put a clear coat of epoxy over it as well, this helps hold in all the color chips and adds an extra layer of protection"

First the drain line was clogged leading to standing water in the air handler which was starting to rust things out. Second the tubing protecting the 220v wiring going into the outdoor unit was broken which could allow water to get into the electronics.   Both were quite obvious problems that he wasn't making up. Fixing them wasn't super cheap but wasn't outrageous either. He was low key and suggested fixing them but did not pressure. He mentioned his yearly package for spring / fall tuneups but didn't push it. He also didn't angle for replacing anything anytime soon but rather suggested keeping up with inspections and maintenance to get the most life out of it.   All in all I was pretty pleased.

The question is, what's that worth to you? If the system lasts 15 years that's $1800 in tuneups. Is it going to prevent an $1800 repair? Probably not. Is it going to catch potential problems before they leave you with a hot/cold house for a few days, or possibly prevent a couple $300 repairs? Probably.

HomeImprovement,3e1fmt,johnxxfahmy,2,Tue Jul 21 05:37:31 2015 UTC,"Good PSA, but you are over simplifying the stack effect and the way it interacts with crawl space areas.  Crawls are typically cooler even if they are vented simply because there is less air flow (energy transfer) and its out of the direct sun.  In other cases the relative humidity is lower too because of cooler surfaces condensing all the moisture out of the air (or you air handler and ducts running cool air inside them).  This is why its nasty down there; water condensing out of the air and soaking into everything causing mold and rot.  Despite having vents in most homes the flow usually is just enough to bring in more humid air, slow it down, release the moisture, and move out.  Very much the opposite drying effect purported by most code officials and builders.    So that is what is generally happening causing it to be nasty, it can be a varied mix of effects too however, but in humid climates that is the first source of moisture.  How does it get into your home???  The stack effect is warm air rising and cold dense air falling.  Since your crawl is typically cooler, and your home at that time is usually being cooled actively, leakage through your floor and wall assembly with that effect runs from inside to out (this is under a completely calm wind day).  Now the actual driver that actively pushes through the lower wall and floor assemblies tends to be pressure differences from wind intrusion.  The other more constant route for nasty air in your crawl to get into your home is DUCT LEAKAGE.  If your HVAC system has leakage in the supply ducts then your are pumping a percent of the air you are pulling from the into the crawl (which means you are negatively pressurizing the home with respect to the crawl)  and now you have a new air driver pulling crawl air into the home.  If your duct leakage is on the return side, then you are pushing more air in than you are removing, which means to pull the same amount of air by the fan, the air handler is pulling that air from the crawl directly into the return duct leakage, or air handler access doors (last thing that ever gets sealed if at all).    Do not be fooled to think that a vapor barrier that is laid on the foundation footprint and a little ways up the foundation walls and piers works AT ALL.  Remember capillary action?  moisture gets around those things easily up the concrete assemblies and then sits against the sill plate of your joists.  Not to mention those vents are still open pumping outdoor humidity in still.  TL:DR  Anything short of a sealed crawl (not always conditioned, just don't open the access a lot, or store things in it), does little to mitigate the cesspool that is modern crawl space systems.   More info HERE  Source:  I inspected habitat homes to those standards for this company, they are a well known building science and energy efficiency leader in the Building Performance industry.  EDIT:  H4H were required to have fully sealed, and actively dehumidified crawls for Energy Star V3."

While there are ways to reinforce those walls, I would recommend a tear out and replace. Those DIY fixes will not work in your case and having it fixed will cost somewhere between $5-10K.

HomeImprovement,3e0je7,pbayanir,7,Tue Jul 21 00:51:06 2015 UTC,"Even with the best underlayment you will hear everything, laminate is cheap for a reason. The underlayment is meant to dampen sound for the one who is using the floor. It may very well have underlayment under it already. Check near an air vent. The only thing I can think would be to underlay with sound dampening panels, and use a rubber underlayment, but that is a lot of cost and work. Any way you go, you should know that laminate flooring is extremely fragile when not installed. If you chip the face or break locks it cannot really be repaired. And because it is produced in dye lots it may be hard to find an exact match."
HomeImprovement,3e0je7,Cobwatts,3,Tue Jul 21 01:27:43 2015 UTC,"I totally agree with this comment.  My mother installed laminate upstairs and even though she used the highest end underlayment, every noise is still magnified.    As mentioned, taking apart laminate floor is basically useless because you'll end up with more broken edges than you think.    Best bet...soundproof your ceiling because anything short of removing their laminate entirely, isn't going to work."
HomeImprovement,3e0je7,AbsolutelyPink,2,Tue Jul 21 07:03:44 2015 UTC,I'm going to be the guy and ask if this is reasonable? Is this something people do in condos?   I'm just imagining a scenario where my neighbor suggests I tear up my floors so that it is quieter in their house and SPLIT the costs with them.  I think I would laugh and suggest you tear down your ceilings and properly soundproof. I don't know. Just seems like a BIG request to ask of someone.   This is more just a question about condo living than directly at OP but now it really has me thinking.
HomeImprovement,3e0je7,charliedarwinsfather,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:12:27 2015 UTC,"I have to agree with /u/Charliedarwinsfather. Why would they pay out of pocket for something that they get no benefit from? In fact, they would have to move all of their furniture out, and probably leave their home for several days or more while the work is done.  I would also add that the flooring contractor will probably need to demo the old floor and replace it entirely. No flooring company will want to be on the hook for removing the floor in any salvageable form.  I would look into closed cell spray foam soundproofing in the cavity between your ceiling and their floors, and/or having a contractor add an additional layer of drywall to your existing ceiling (I know this technique works for walls, not sure if it's safe or code-compliant on ceilings)."
HomeImprovement,3e0qou,litlluvbug,4,Tue Jul 21 01:50:29 2015 UTC,"Can't see much from the photo. Hard the lumps bubbles or is everything firm? Either way you would not have to redo the drywall.   Bubbles will be a pita to fix and you'd have to pull of the tape, at least where there are bubbles.  Skim coating is a bit of work. If you have a lot of them you could call a drywall taper - it would probably go real quick and cost less than you think."
HomeImprovement,3e0qou,mingy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:11:10 2015 UTC,"Everything feels solid. Even where it is bubbled out it feels like it is solid. The corners are only bad a 2 rooms. Maybe it was an unskilled DIY job, but the protruding horizontal seams are everywhere in the house and you can push on them and they have some space behind them. Not more than a centimeter,  but definitely feels like they are somewhat detached from the inside frame work, only at the seams though."
HomeImprovement,3e0qou,mingy,3,Tue Jul 21 03:41:21 2015 UTC,Sounds like where you can push on them the tape on those seams isn't stuck to the drywall. You'll need to excise the bubbles and tape over them (no tape means a crack).  I used to have trouble with tape bubbling then I went to mesh tape and setting compound. Man I hate drywall.
HomeImprovement,3e0qou,charliedarwinsfather,3,Tue Jul 21 14:20:41 2015 UTC,"Seconding the vote for mesh. I can't work with the tape.  I've found that working with the powder compound and mixing as needed, as you go, is way easier than buying the premixed stuff. Or maybe i've gotten better at it over time and should try the premixed stuff again?"
HomeImprovement,3e0qou,mingy,2,Tue Jul 21 16:06:58 2015 UTC,"I only use pre-mix for touchups. I really like the fact that if I mix up a batch of Drywall 60, I know its going to be bone dry in a couple hours.   In any event, I read somewhere that you are supposed to use setting compound with mesh because (oddly enough) the mesh is weaker and setting compound is stronger.

HomeImprovement,3e0h53,bigtayy,5,Tue Jul 21 00:32:17 2015 UTC,You should open the window or run an exhaust fan while using the shower (and a short time after) to combat humidity. I also believe you're landlord needs to do something about the mold already present.
HomeImprovement,3e0h53,dotpain,3,Tue Jul 21 00:59:31 2015 UTC,"Do you have an AC that works? Air conditioners dry the air, which helps prevent/kill mold."

I'm fairly certain there is a pipe leakage above me, because there is a wet spot where the paint has been peeled off, but the super is such a lazy bastard he assumes it's not a big deal."
HomeImprovement,3e0h53,YAISEDDIT,3,Tue Jul 21 02:11:58 2015 UTC,If you think the mold is being caused by water damage you're talking about a serious problem and a serious health risk.  You might consider writing the landlord a letter about the problem and putting your rent into escrow until they fix it.  If they don't fix it to your satisfaction it's time to find a new place and take the escrowed rent with you.
HomeImprovement,3e0h53,RalphieRed,2,Tue Jul 21 04:42:42 2015 UTC,Any drywall that is saturated will be pretty soft. You might want to check for soft spots on the ceiling if you haven't already.
HomeImprovement,3e0h53,sd1717,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:14:07 2015 UTC,"For the current mold a bleach/water mix.  Bleach kills mold.  Moved in with a slovenly friend in a dump many years ago and removed a significant chunk of bathroom mold....much, much more than what you've got there.  Once you get it almost gone, apply bleach occasionally, it will go all the way away.  Need to open a window if you don't have a bathroom fan."
HomeImprovement,3e0h53,alukima,2,Tue Jul 21 03:27:24 2015 UTC,You shouldn't use bleach to kill mold on a porous surface. I was involved in a tenant/landlord dispute over mold issues and the city health inspector docked my landlord for improper cleanup for sending the maintenance guy up with bleach to 'clean' it. Here's one article and there are many more citing the reasons for this.
HomeImprovement,3e0h53,sd1717,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:32:59 2015 UTC,"First and foremost, I was talking about what OP, as a renter can do.  He can't do what the article states, so it is of no help.  Bleach does kill surface mold.  Yes it damages drywall if the paint is a porous type, and OP doesn't appear to have drywall, that looks like plaster....which can handle a little bleach just fine. (on a side note, I hate the smear job that has been done on bleach, it's safe, it's strong, but everyone is scared of it. It's literally the recommended cleaning technique for baby toys, yet god forbid using it to clean a countertop)  Also, when your talking about the type of mold shown in your article, I'd agree with the drywall removal as being the only real option to fix this.  However, the pics that OP included can literally come from a couple weeks of showering without a fan.  It appears to be very minor surface mold, more minor than you'd see in basically every college dump, men's bathroom when I went to school (old buildings had a tendency to build bathrooms with no fans or windows).    Your city's tenant board also must be very good to tenants.  My city's would not have done anything as the health effects of mold have not yet been proven, and such minor mold caused from bathroom condensation (and not a leaky pipe in the walls) usually can be cleaned up with bleach, at least as a first attempt."
HomeImprovement,3e0h53,alukima,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:11:01 2015 UTC,"Just looks like basic surface mold. Get a mold cleaner and wipe it up, make sure to ventilate the bathroom properly. If opening the window doesn't fix it ask the landlord to put in a vent. I live in portland and this with happen pretty much instantly in every home unless you keep kitchens/bathroom/utility rooms well ventilated and dry."

It could be a ton of stuff but first you'd want to check the circuit breaker of the electrical line the compressor's running on.  If you know where it is, you should check that the capacitors are good ...which is a common enough thing to go out, depending on the age of your unit.  But if none of this makes any sense at all to you, you may need to call in a pro."

Just one other question or warning though... If the AC is old enough that the capacitor's gone out and you're not having it regularly serviced... Is it cooling well or does it seem like it's running longer than it use to or having a harder time keeping the house cool? If ""yes"", you may need to have the freon level checked and perhaps recharged. That you can't do for yourself but it's worth having done.  EDIT: Just read your ""side question"" above. If the units are icing, you need to have the freon levels checked and (probably) recharged. That's not a DIY. You'll need test guages and the freon."
HomeImprovement,3e0bqu,Sol_Invictus,2,Tue Jul 21 16:06:52 2015 UTC,"The working ac is cooling ok, just concerned about the ice forming on some of the pipe.   How much typically does it cost for freon level checked and recharge?"
HomeImprovement,3e0bqu,Sol_Invictus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:18:30 2015 UTC,"Almost impossible to answer that.   Typically there would be some standard service charge (the cost of coming out to your house) which will vary from area to area depending on where you live... but after that the cost will depend on how much freon they have to use to bring it up to operating level. There are also different types of freon now, depending on the age of your units, with different prices for different types.  A local company would be in a better position to give you a ballpark cost estimate, but they're all gonna tell you it depends on how much freon you need."
