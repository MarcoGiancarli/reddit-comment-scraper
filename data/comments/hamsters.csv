hamsters,3e6fxv,QuotesUnquotes,3,Wed Jul 22 09:05:42 2015 UTC,"DISCLAIMER: I have no idea whether this is vet recommended!!  When I was young, one of our hamsters did something similar, ended up covered in grease and filth.  My mum used a baby wipe to careful get the worst of the dirt off him and then let him have a dust bath (to get rid of the baby wipe smell!). We then just gave him clean bedding every day for a few days in a row so the dirt wasn't being slept in, and he was fine."
hamsters,3e6fxv,ninjamokturtle,2,Wed Jul 22 09:46:17 2015 UTC,Get that hammy a sand bath!
hamsters,3e6fxv,zebradentist,2,Wed Jul 22 10:37:49 2015 UTC,"This might be a time when it's the exception to the rule, I wouldn't give him a proper ""bath"" bath but a damp cloth to take the worst of the grease off might be an idea, just make sure he's kept warm and dried off afterwards so he can't catch cold.   And a sand bath so he can finish the job himself. Poor little guy!"
hamsters,3e6fxv,gallium3,2,Wed Jul 22 10:50:48 2015 UTC,"I second everyone saying to use a damp cloth or baby wipe to clean him. Since he did get greasy, you may want to consider diluting a drop or two of Dawn (Fairy Liquid if you're in the UK) with warm water and using a cloth dipped in that to clean his underbelly (and then wipe again to get the residue off). I know Dawn is used to clean up animals after oil spills, so I think you'd be safe doing that.  The main concern about ""bathing"" hamsters is that you shouldn't submerge them in water...it can cause severe shock which can kill them. As long as you're not planning to dunk your hams unaware into a pool, he should be okay with some lightly dabbed warm water."

Their pups and hamsters are just so precious. Her name is PERFECT (<3 Mono). I love her little blue frog x her bowl is also the best! Where are they from? :)  I have the critter baths for some of my hams; Dusty is about 185g and still fits, and Cady is 190g and still fits, so don't worry about them growing out of it. :D I also find when my pups go home, I tell the owner to give them a day or so to settle in just in case, but then they go to fill up a food bowl and the pup is already up their arm and onto their shoulder, haha. One of the great things about breeder pups! She should be fine with the comfort wheel, just make sure it spins around (sometimes they're stiff, I know it takes a bit to break them in). Ah she's so sweet. x"

hamsters,3e2p0t,freyalorelei,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:02:56 2015 UTC,"How does one go about starting a hamstery? I love Campbell's dwarf hamsters, and after 20-odd years of keeping hamsters of all five pet species, feel confident that I'm experienced enough to go into professionally showing and breeding."
hamsters,3e2p0t,hekomi,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:21:34 2015 UTC,"A lot of research and genetic knowledge. :) There aren't any showing groups in North America except California - similarly it's really difficult to find purebred Campbells except in California. But if you're a passion for it, and are willing to learn and hope to improve the species I can probably hook you up."
hamsters,3e2p0t,freyalorelei,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:11:39 2015 UTC,"Well, I have some knowledge of genetics, insofar as I know not to breed two mottled dwarf hamsters together to produce eyeless pups (the same applies to dominant spot in Syrians). I also know about alleles, homozygous vs. heterozygous genes, and dominant traits. I don't know how all of that applies specifically to hamster color and pattern types, however. It's hard to learn hamster genetics if there's no one to personally teach you. :(  And I REALLY have no clue about showing...I showed my Pekingese, so I'm familiar with competitive conformation, but I don't know how to judge a quality hamster from an inferior one. I need to learn the subtleties.  I'm VERY motivated to learn, however! Hamsters have been a personal obsession for over half my life, and I have dozens of books on the subject. I currently have no hamsters, just two cats, a rabbit, and a betta, and I miss them like crazy."
hamsters,3e2p0t,hekomi,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:10:53 2015 UTC,"I can probably teach you some, but I would recommend checking out AAA Hamsters' Campbells section http://www.aaahamsters.org/Campbells.html and then also giving Moxie Hamstery  http://www.moxiehamstery.com a shout! She's the only one, besides Linda who owns AAA that breeds purebreds and I bet she'd be happy to teach :)"

By using its refined cuteness it can settle with its human targets to silently eliminate them. It runs on sunflower seeds which can be stored in its cheek batteries. A tinier model is currently in development.

hamsters,3dyv5b,VladimirElite,3,Mon Jul 20 17:27:23 2015 UTC,"Probably just being curious and energetic. In my experience, most hamsters are like that. Signs of distress would be ears down and frantic running, like he's trying to hide. Most hamsters just don't like sitting still, I'm sure your little guy/girl loves you as most as they can in their own way"
hamsters,3dyv5b,jukebox_romeo,2,Mon Jul 20 18:53:52 2015 UTC,"My hamster is also like a little dynamo.  Fine at first, but gradually gets faster and faster. I like giving him things to do instead of just running away, like putting him on the sofa where he hides behind the cushions, or putting him in a discarded pair of trousers so he can run through the legs. Also, putting down a little trail of treats seems to keep him occupied, and less focussed on escaping."

hamsters,3dkhgw,virgoshoyru,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:20:30 2015 UTC,"I had a hamster like this. Not all of them are super friendly from the get go (mine took months to get used to me). Just keep doing what you're doing to build trust. Lastly, biting the bars isn't him being aggressive; hamster teeth are constantly growing so they need to chew on things to keep them short. Buy something he can gnaw on (I got mine something but he preferred the cage bars). Good luck!  What's his name?"
hamsters,3dkhgw,maxwellemiller,2,Fri Jul 17 02:24:13 2015 UTC,"he's stopped biting on the bars so much now he's calmed down and i hardly hear him do it and he gnaws on his treat stick/log thing/toilet roll tubes instead thankfully  his name is Drake, I let my friend name him since I wasn't so bothered and he's never had a pet of his own before :)"
hamsters,3dkhgw,PlantyHamchuk,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:30:34 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you're on the right track. Also seconding getting chews. Try not to fear being bitten, your hamster can probably pick up on your tension that something isn't quite right. If you're really worried you can wear thick gloves, just to get your hamster used to being handled, and to learn to not fear hands. Remember that they have a great sense of smell but their vision isn't so hot, and if their home is too small they can get freaked out about things coming into it.  You can always put tissues in your clothes and wear them for a bit (some people stuff them into bras), and then give the hamster the tissues for bedding, just to additionally get him used to your scent."
hamsters,3dkhgw,gallium3,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:03:26 2015 UTC,"I got shafted with a Laura too! It's pretty tiny, once my rescue ham got into a decent sized cage (hamster heaven) she chilled out A LOT. It's understandable being a bit wary of being bitten but most of the time they bite when they're scared or very stressed and he doesn't sound scared of you. If you are hand feeding him I think you're doing well. If you do get an investigative nibble just move your hand away slowly, he's probably just checking you're definitely not food. If you like you can look up some articles on their body language, teeth chattering can be a sign of stress but my girl did it after chewing bars too. If their ears are perked up and curious and they're sniffing you then they're not scared and unlikely to bite. Some hams in small spaces can get territorial and aggressive over their cage and they can nip if they feel like you're coming into their space. It doesn't seem like Drake has this particular problem but if you are worried about it you can use the ball to take him into a dry bathtub with you and let him get used to you being around him in more of a neutral space."
hamsters,3dkhgw,InfintySquared,0,Fri Jul 17 15:22:31 2015 UTC,"Okay, even the most friendliest of hamsters will still gently nibble your fingertip. It's how they say hello. If they're well-tamed, they'll just test you with their teeth but not bite down, it's a little startling if you're not used to it but harmless, I promise.  So basically..."
