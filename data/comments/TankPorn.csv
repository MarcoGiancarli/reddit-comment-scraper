TankPorn,3dq93e,Iowas,3,Sat Jul 18 20:05:40 2015 UTC,"I always wondered whether the steering wheel actually steered the kettenkrad. Cool little beastie, apparently tons got used as tractors on farms after the war."
TankPorn,3dq93e,finackles,4,Sat Jul 18 18:36:26 2015 UTC,"It did, but not in the way you probably imagine. If memory serves, turning the steering wheel actually operates the tread locks.    So turning the wheel to the right applies the lock on the right track, causing the left track to be the only one providing forward movement and as such it will turn to the right. Centering the wheel once more removes the tread lock and causes the vehicle to move forward again.   The wheel on the ground does help it make sharper turns, though."
TankPorn,3dq93e,SJ_RED,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:10:20 2015 UTC,"That's interesting, so if the wheel was missing, turning the handlebars still worked. On motorcycles, steering happens more by leaning than turning the bars,except for parking manoeuvres."

TankPorn,3dq93e,SJ_RED,2,Sun Jul 19 13:27:17 2015 UTC,"Yes it did turn it. The wheel steered it at higher speeds and on roads, etc. If you turn it hard enough though it would engage the tracks to turn like a tank. In rough terrain you could drive without the front wheel, which was recommended."

They, oddly enough, proved reliable and well suited to knocking out allied armour. They also doubled as mobile artillery. The only downside was they could only transport on-board a very small stiockpile of ammunition so they had little in the way of staying power on a battlefield.   The 75mm version was great but the 90mm version was truly something special. However, few of those were produced. Still, the 90mm Breda piece it carried outperformed its famous German counterpart, the 88, in almost every way."

TankPorn,3dqgyl,Collige01,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:25:38 2015 UTC,What's the difference between a rifled barrel and a smooth bore barrel?
TankPorn,3dqgyl,Bluenosedcoop,4,Sat Jul 18 14:34:56 2015 UTC,"Rifled barrels have spiral grooves on the inside of the barrel to spin-stabilize projectiles. Smoothbore barrels do not, so their projectiles need to be stabilized another way.  Many modern tanks use smoothbore barrels because they shoot sabot projectiles more efficiently, and saboted sub-caliber projectiles are usually stabilized with fins."
TankPorn,3dqgyl,Collige01,3,Sat Jul 18 14:46:19 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't know any more than the fact that rifling a barrel must cost some amount of money and that they had to design diffrent rounds for it because just about (if not everyone) everbody else uses smoothbore main cannons. I know one reason is that if a sabot round was fired out of a rifled barrel it would ""tumble"" and not go cleanly through it's target. I'll try and respond when I can if you have any more questions.  Edit: mobile is fun"

TankPorn,3dqgyl,Collige01,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:08:09 2015 UTC,Yeah I understand that but that means they can't use the same rounds that a abrams or leopard could use.

TankPorn,3dqgyl,Seamus_OReilly,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:39:36 2015 UTC,The main difference is that Challenger 2 uses two piece ammunition.
TankPorn,3dqgyl,jimfixeditforme,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:57:56 2015 UTC,"The M1A1 still uses the same Choblam found on the Challenger 1, but the A2 series uses a successor variant, it's similar to dorchester but not the same due to different compositions such as the usage of silicon carbide tiles vs alumina tiles, and of course the Abrams also uses depleted uranium layers in certain slabs of it's armor as well."
TankPorn,3dqgyl,FreeUsernameInBox,3,Sat Jul 18 17:46:35 2015 UTC,"Abrams advantages:  1) Single component main gun rounds makes loading and firing faster.  The Challenger's rounds are 2 part (projectile and charge).  2)  I believe it has better cross country performance.  3)  It's quieter.  vOv  Challenger advantages:  1) Armor is heavier and more evenly distributed.  M1 is concentrated to the front, but is weaker in the flanks.  2) Challenger doesn't have a ridiculous, fuel guzzling turbine engine whose horsepower is governed down by the transmission to keep it from shearing the sprockets and exploding the final drives.  Disclaimer: my experience is from 15-20 years ago, so I may be out of date."
TankPorn,3dqgyl,gijose41,2,Sat Jul 18 14:45:20 2015 UTC,Two piece ammunition can be quicker (depends on stowage configurations) and lets you mix and match projectile natures and charges. Also allows for a smaller crew area as less room needed to swing stuff about.  Also means you can stow the non explosive stuff (shot) in the more vulnerable positions and protect the HE and charges deep below the turret.
TankPorn,3dqgyl,Seamus_OReilly,5,Sat Jul 18 20:54:31 2015 UTC,"On the other hand, single-piece ammunition allows nesting the penetrator in the charge, giving a longer, heavier penetrator. This limits the performance of sabot rounds from the Challenger 2."
TankPorn,3dqgyl,FeroxDraken,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:40:52 2015 UTC,"I don't really think your first point is the case. Even with 155mm howitzers, single part shells are faster loading"

TankPorn,3dov2j,QuerulousPanda,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:39:42 2015 UTC,"No, initially it was designed as a cruiser or medium,  intended to exploit gaps in the enemy lines where opposition had been removed, moving through and attacking the enemy's unprotected lines of communication and the rear areas.  This one has a 50mm gun."
TankPorn,3dov2j,QuerulousPanda,3,Sat Jul 18 06:05:00 2015 UTC,"ahh really? I had it backwards then. .. I had thought the IV was the one that would exploit, and the III would go for tanks, but then the IV ended up having a better anti tank gun so it became the better machine for the role."
TankPorn,3dov2j,OfficalWerewolf,3,Sat Jul 18 06:36:48 2015 UTC,"Well you're not wrong. Originally the Panzer III was the breakthrough tank- it would advance and engage enemy tanks, using speed, armor, and armament as well as tactical superiority achieved by CAS. It would then use it's mobility to engage and wreak havoc in the enemies rear as the infantry mopped up what ever was left. Well, the Panzer IV was a larger tank with similar armor protection with a 75mm howitzer, for killing infantry and destroying fortifications. What happened is that the Panzer III's turret ring was too small, and could not handle a gun bigger then a 50mm, while the Panzer IV was large enough to upgrade to the High Velocity 75mm anti-tank gun. When this happened, the roles switched over."

TankPorn,3dmlxa,Capn_Domovoi,17,Fri Jul 17 15:40:27 2015 UTC,"I'm leaning towards the same rationale that saw efforts to camouflage the gun on the Sherman fireflys.  The 17lb gun armed Shermans were more of a threat to the Germans than the 75mm armed Shermans,  so the fireflys ended up getting fire concentrated on them.  Maybe the Israeli experience has been the ATGM platforms have been singled out for extra loving from their  more conventional enemies (or maybe their own doctrine emphasizes killing ATGMs and they assume everyone else thinks the same)."

Due to the small population and smaller professional military corps they try not to have a fight where 10% or 15% of the unit is could be casualties and ""that's just the cost of doing business"".

For comparison, the US military stockpiled 80,000 of them. Also, by that point they were too vulnerable to be used for much else than recon.   Furthermore, there was a joint US-German project to develop a new Shillelagh-equipped dual-ammo tank, the MBT-70, which was ultimately the grandaddy of both the Leopard 2 and the M1.   In spite of its own middling performance, the Sheridan was the progenitor to some of the best tanks on the field today."

So short answer is I don't know.  However the idea of using the same tube to fire a missile and a conventional shell seems to be a pretty poor one even from a layman's (aka my) standpoint.
TankPorn,3djhc9,TheDesertFox109,3,Fri Jul 17 04:30:57 2015 UTC,"Modern Russian tanks like the T-90 are capable of firing both guided anti-tank missiles and conventional ammunition from the main gun. Of course, these are smooth bore guns, not rifles guns, which I believe the Sheridan's was."

Can't find out that much about its performance but it's pretty formidable on paper:   Models made from computers, where they simulate actual combat conditions between T-90 tanks and M1A1 ""Abrams"" (where each side has 10 tanks), it was shown that long-distance successes of missiles fired from the barrel of the first was destroyed up to 50-60% of M1A1 tanks deployed. In addition, guided missiles ""Refleks / Invar-M"" are an effective weapon against helicopters pose a serious threat to armored units.   Although the source is here so a grain of salt would not be out of order.  Also according to wiki the T72 was also equipped to fire missiles from its main gun. Learning lots of new stuff."

If you are moving and shooting and the enemy has ""normal"" rounds, the normal rounds murder while the missiles fly wild."
TankPorn,3djhc9,fishosaurus,2,Sat Jul 18 05:21:52 2015 UTC,I do note that we haven't tried the same trick since then :)
TankPorn,3djhc9,12Valv,3,Fri Jul 17 04:39:11 2015 UTC,The barrel had a notched keyway for the missile to slot. This caused some sort of structual/stress crack when active firing irregardless of round type. Although the firing the missile made it a lot worse. They fixed it by making the keyway smaller.

TankPorn,3defsl,ironflesh,2,Wed Jul 15 21:01:00 2015 UTC,"Depends on what sort of mobility you are talking about.    The Centurion hardly slows down when going up hills, and only the muddiest of terrain will bog it down.  The Leo will get slowed by hills and bogged down faster than the Cent, but the Leo does perform well in both areas (certainly better than the M60 or T-72).  In the terms of just raw capabilities, the Leo is faster and more agile of the two.  In either case, during that era of tank development, Russia and US got shafted while Britain and Germany stormed the battlefield."
TankPorn,3defsl,HorrificAnalInjuries,4,Wed Jul 15 21:16:06 2015 UTC,The reason why the Centurion is 'slow' per se is due to a speed limiter which caps speed at 40km/h. See the Israeli S'hot Kal  They modified their Centurions and removed that limiter and it can go much faster.

TankPorn,3defsl,WaitingToBeBanned,2,Wed Jul 15 23:36:15 2015 UTC,"I was comparing only mobility of the tanks because guns were more or less similar and ammo was so powerful that it completely negated armor. Leopard 1 beats them all in that regard (Wikipedia):   Centurion 13 hp/tonne; 52 tonnes. Leopard 1 19,6 hp/tonne; 42,2 tonnes. T-55 14,6 hp/tonne; 36 tonnes. T-64 18,4 hp/tonne; 38 tonnes."

I'm sorry if I've rustled your jimmies, but the Leo and Cent could outperform any Russian medium/MTB model up to the T-72.  After that, the T-80 performs on either equal or better footing than the Leo or Cent, and the T-90 is a monstrously quick machine.  By ""outperform"", I by no means mean armor protection.  Even the T-72 had better armor, and probably had the best armor of the lot."

TankPorn,3d730l,SU37Yellow,10,Tue Jul 14 07:33:31 2015 UTC,"While you're right that these really heavy tank destroyers were a material waste, I'm fairly certain they retained popularity because the lack of a turret made them easier, cheaper, and faster to build and maintain. That was a big deal to late war Germany and it's extremely distressed industrial sector.  Meanwhile the additional armour was appreciated, and the lack of a turret was not as huge of a loss as it might seem (Germany used more practical assault guns, like the StuG series, to great effect, and armoured warfare frequently involved hitting targets directly in front of you).  Heavy vehicles like the Ferdinand, Jagdpanther, and Jagdtiger were quite impractical, but you can see how they came to be."
TankPorn,3d730l,FoxtrotZero,6,Tue Jul 14 08:22:54 2015 UTC,"Jagdpanther wasn't all that impractical. Heavy, long-ranged, proven combat-effective gun, sloped armour across the entire front side, decent movement speed."
TankPorn,3d730l,SJ_RED,2,Tue Jul 14 09:42:20 2015 UTC,"Yea I believe they could have made more efficient use of resources to build more jagdpanthers if anything. Not only was the jagdtiger a bit unwieldy, somewhat overkill, and harder if not just as hard to maintain at that stage in the war; the massive gun on the thing was very hard to keep sighted and calibrated. With all the cross country movement required to keep off of roads and out of sight of aircraft, the big 128mm PaK went through a lot of bumps and jostled about quite a bit. Big gun might be nice when you want to deck a Sherman through a building, however it doesn't help much when half the crews are to afraid to do anything and the other half can't shoot straight. Just my two cents."
TankPorn,3d730l,Pugachev_Cobra,2,Tue Jul 14 14:17:32 2015 UTC,"when you want to deck a Sherman through a building   That just sounds epic as hell.   Well-written post, lots of good points. I agree completely, they weren't very practical at all. But damn if they didn't look imposing and awesome."
TankPorn,3d730l,SJ_RED,3,Tue Jul 14 16:16:36 2015 UTC,"Plus these big baddies really could do scary things if they could engage at range.  The Ferdinand was considered a failure at Kursk-but still managed either 12-1 or 10-1 kill ratios.  Without any close support Russian infantry just overran them of course-or they burst into fire all on their own in some cases.  The Jagdtiger was supposed to be ""that"" but better.  Fortunately they were crewed by inexperienced troops and unsupported (again lol).  I am a little more forgiving of the""overkill"" part. Pugachev was on the mark with all he typed except that it seems natural for the German Tank designers to plan for the next generation of enemies.  I am not sure it was a smart move- but I can see the logic. They didn't need this generation of supertank-they need next generation."
TankPorn,3d730l,Baldemyr,2,Tue Jul 14 17:09:00 2015 UTC,"I would agree with the notion of preparing for the future of tank warfare if it weren't for the simple fact that the fate of the war was all but decided by the time the Jagdtigers were coming into play. Certainly by the time they were being fielded it might have been too late to simply say: ""ah well maybe we should just not use these.."" But I would think that somewhere during the development they would have thought to cancel and funnel resources to something more practical. In my opinion, more workhorse tanks such as Pz IVs or Panthers would have been a much better option than specialized tanks. Although, again, by the time this was all occurring I'm not sure anything would have really changed the outcome of the war."
TankPorn,3d730l,Pugachev_Cobra,2,Tue Jul 14 17:29:05 2015 UTC,Completely agreed.   I just mean I could see that line of thinking - even if delusional by that point
TankPorn,3d730l,Baldemyr,2,Tue Jul 14 19:01:01 2015 UTC,"Little late, but I thought I'd throw this in here: there's really two halves of the German tank equation. The first was what they were trying to accomplish, and the second was what they had to accomplish it.  Those in charge of designing and fielding tanks had a taste for trying to keep things as technologically cutting-edge as possible. They were fielding a large array of vehicles, each with an even larger array of variants and types. Any time a vehicle came in for repair, it had to be brought up to the newest standard it could and then worked upon in a non-standardized framework. Likewise the requirements for constructing and maintaining their armour was just too much. These were very sophisticated vehicles and it showed, particularly in things like the overlapping roadwheels and the transmission.  In the meanwhile, Germany was starting to run short of some of the materials it needed. Any sort of advanced metal alloy was probably at a premium and anywhere cheaper materials could be used, they were - sometimes problematically. My understanding is that materials quality was one of the biggest problems with the Panther's gearbox. On top of that, the Allies were running a very large-scale, and very effective long-range heavy bombing campaign against the German industrial centers. Tons of vehicles ready or almost-ready to see service were destroyed in factory bombing campaigns.  I'm a big fan of German WWII tank development for a lot of the crazy and groundbreaking things they did, but one of the things that interests me most was the plans for the Entwicklung series. The idea was to design a ""definitive"" vehicle for each weight class (ranging from 10 ton scout vehicles to 100+ ton superheavy tanks), with the manufacturing process made as simple and streamlined as possible, and maximized part commonality between vehicles. Had Germany embraced this concept sooner and more fully, rather than Hitler's obsession with superweapons, the late years of the war might have gone much differently."
TankPorn,3d730l,FoxtrotZero,3,Thu Jul 16 21:07:56 2015 UTC,"The lack of a turret could also be an advantage in a few instances. I recall the Soviet SU-152's lobbing their massive 152 mm high explosive shells at Tiger I's during Kursk and just knocking the turrets right off, without the need to penetrate."
TankPorn,3d730l,Hermann_Von_Salza,3,Tue Jul 14 16:48:59 2015 UTC,"That's more because the 152 was a fucking massive shell and most tank turrets are secured to the hull by nothing except their own weight. The use of a casement like on the jagdpanzers did however allow for more armor and a larger gun in most cases, in addition to reducing the number of mechanical components that had to be maintained."
TankPorn,3d730l,Yetanotherfurry,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:41:35 2015 UTC,"It also freed up a lot of space, but I still think throwing a multi-tonne turret into the air like a person kicking over a rock is damned impressive."

The T-44 also would have entered mass production if the war was projected toaq continue into 1946.

He noted that it was impossible to get out of the driver's hatch while wearing said apparatus... so the idea was you would stow it (by wearing it) and quickly remove it in order to make a hasty exit if necessary.  Also, being a notional cavalry regiment, all the tanks had names, written on the driver's glacis. Names began with the squadron letter, so in A Squadron they had Agnes, Aunty, Amelia, and so on.

TankPorn,3cr191,Hansafan,2,Fri Jul 10 17:17:44 2015 UTC,"I have yet to see a universal answer to this. It really seems to depend more on the intended use and primary ammunition types. In between 12mm and 20mm is where it is REALLY fuzzy and it is pretty much up to the designer what it is considered if it is in that range.  My rule of thumb is once it get near 20mm, designated for anti-material work, and has high explosive as one of its primary ammunition types, I consider it a cannon.

TankPorn,3cpowg,wikingwarrior,25,Thu Jul 9 19:52:54 2015 UTC,Here we see the Tiger (P) in its natural habitat: Parked on a transport.   No mention of that vehicle is complete without mentioning it's bad-by-Wehrmacht-standards-bad reliability.
TankPorn,3cpowg,LTSarc,17,Thu Jul 9 21:11:04 2015 UTC,It could be worse.  The Maus existed.
TankPorn,3cpowg,Yetanotherfurry,6,Thu Jul 9 21:12:35 2015 UTC,"I can never quite grasp how something could be worse than the panther. I mean, a post-war French report found that it's transmission's final drive or some part only lasted 150 km, that most parts lasted for half as long as they were supposed to, and that the road wheels could even be deformed by sufficiently roughly terrain."
TankPorn,3cpowg,Augustustin,12,Thu Jul 9 23:36:34 2015 UTC,"Most of the problems regarding parts breaking were the type of steel and lack of proper machinery.  The Panther was designed to have the same gearbox/transmission as the Tiger I, but the machinery to manufacture them were either too small in numbers or destroyed from allied bombing.  Another factor was that the original plan to include the Tiger I's drive system was replaced by a simpler to manufacture unit such as the double spur system, but it was more prone to breakage. Against the wishes of the designers and the officers heading the project, they had to stick to lower quality parts.  On top of that, most of the production of the Panthers were done by slave labor, and we all can see the obvious point in sabotage being prevalent in that department."
TankPorn,3cpowg,SMIDSY,6,Fri Jul 10 00:51:36 2015 UTC,"I agree that quality of manufacturing had a part to play, but I would argue the biggest problem with the panther is that its final drive is it is jammed full of strait spur gears. This would have been fine for the original prototype design that was much lighter, but it REALLY needed double herringbone gears like that seen in the US M4 Medium. From an engineering standpoint, they were going to be less reliable than their American counterparts even if they were the same weight, nevermind the extra 18 tons on the Panther. Compounding this was the fact that the transmission and final drive could not be easily maintained or replaced. The entire fighting compartment, including the turret, have to be removed to get those pieces of machinery out. The whole process of changing a Panther transmission and final drive can take 3 days or more with an experienced maintenance crew. Compare that to a few hours with the M3 and M4 medium tanks that have a detachable section of the glacis plate in order to maintain such vital parts more easily.  The first version to see combat, the Panther D, was laughably unreliable when it was first introduced. This illustrates what happens if tanks are rushed into combat before all the problems have been worked out. It never did get to an acceptable level of reliability, but the A model at least usually didn't break down until the severe manufacturing and crew training shortcomings of the very late stages of the war."
TankPorn,3cpowg,lockpickerkuroko,2,Fri Jul 10 06:31:10 2015 UTC,The Maus was pretty much incapable of going over anything but paved ground due to its weight. It would probably surpass the Panther in terrible drive and transmission if it were ever able to drive that long.  It also basically threw shells that hit its turret directly towards its top armor.  It was not a smart tank.
TankPorn,3cpowg,maxout2142,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:16:39 2015 UTC,"The Panther had the same issue with the rounded mantlet, remember. If the Maus had indeed been developed and had time to be further modified, they would probably have  come up with either a sinilar solution to the Panther (adding a chin to the bottom of the mantlet) or developing a different kind of turret.

TankPorn,3cc269,Strader69,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:23:36 2015 UTC,"If you took those angular armour addons off the turret front, it'd probably look even more like a T-64. Like most Eastern tanks, the turret underneath is pretty round."

Unfortunately, I don't have much info on it besides the fact that a family donated it to the post a few decades ago; it was repainted just last year.  They suggested I call city hall to obtain service records and such, I will update when I have more info.  My general impressions: It is smaller than you'd think.  I mean, it is a light tank, I guess I just wasn't expecting it.  The hull is a bit longer than my car, and the turret's maybe 2.5ft tall? Shame the turret's been welded and the engine's out."

Here at Carson we've got all sorts of WWII and Korean War era tanks and APCs (There's what I believe is even an M3 Stuart), tons of Vietnam-era tanks and APCs (At LEAST a half-dozen M40 and M60 Pattons of various generations and configurations, to include at least two CEVs), a bunch of different self-propelled guns (Including one that looks similar to an M7 Priest, but is much more blocky, that I can't identify), a bunch of different M113 variants (To include the TOW-carrier variant), a turretless Cadillac-Gage Commando, and a bunch of old Soviet armored vehicles (Most I assume captured in Desert Storm or OIF). There's even an old MP Corps horse trailer, across the parking lot from the Commando in front of the 759th MP Battalion HQ.  There's even a few Cobras, Hueys, Abrams, and Bradleys on display.  Of the other bases I've been at, Fort Gordon doesn't have a lot, but they've got a lot of cool old field commo vehicles/trailers on display; Campbell doesn't have as much WW2-Vietnam stuff as Carson, but has a lot of Soviet stuff; Benning has all kinds of oddball shit at the Infantry Museum, as well as cool but more 'run of the mill' stuff.  If you're near a military base, go check it out sometime if you're able to gain access - there's probably all kinds of cool shit on display all over the base, at its main gate, in its museum, and at its parade field."

It looks in tip-top shape. Well, it's either an M3, or an M2 medium tank, I'm not positive. Come to think of it, it's probably an M2 medium tank.  Tons of tanks and armored vehicles all over Fort Carson. Off the top of my head, and what I'm aware of, there's about 10 or so Patton tanks, I believe covering every full-production generation of it; there's 2-3 Shermans, I'm not sure what specific variants, but they look like M4A4's when I drive past them; there's at least 1 T-72, I assume an Iraqi one; I think there's an M26 Pershing floating around somewhere...  Of the not-exactly-a-tank variety, there's a Cadillac Gage Commando, of the turret-less variety; there's two APCs that I think are an M59 and an M75; a BMP-1, I assume also Iraqi; an M2 half-track; at least one M114; one or two M2 Bradleys; an M901 ITV; two or three M728 CEVs; I'm pretty sure I've seen an M107 self-propelled gun around; and a self-propelled gun that looks somewhat like an M7 Priest, but has a much higher caliber gun, and a much more blocky appearance.

TankPorn,3bz6cx,ExplosiveMachine,10,Fri Jul 3 10:23:38 2015 UTC,"it will be taken to Putlos Training Area near Oldenburg, Germany. The Tank was confiscated as the owner supposedly breached the War Weapons Control Act, the police claims the tank wasn't demilitarised, owner is filing a lawsuit."

TankPorn,3bz6cx,Higeking,6,Fri Jul 3 17:03:54 2015 UTC,hmm reading a bit closer (with less than perfect german skills) it seems like the dude was being investigated for possibilites of having hidden nazi art.  then they discovered the panther and for some reason decided they wanted to take a closer look (something about it not being allowed within the laws for collecting old war weapons) so either the demilling wasnt enough or its related to the art stuff.

TankPorn,3bqnj2,WulfeHound,2,Wed Jul 1 17:09:21 2015 UTC,"yay, another ""the best tank""-thread.  asking ""what is best X"" is inane as a question, because you dont define what makes something best. An example, israelis like their merkavas very much because theyve been optimized for israeli needs, whereas on for example in US service it would be abhorrent due to lack of speed and engine not running on the US standard JP-7. Likewise, Sweden opted out of Abrams to get Leo 2:s due to their own operational requirements for MBTs (sweden does not have ""unlimited fuel mode"" on like some coutries do), not because Leopard is the ""Best"" (coughthough it obviously iscough)"
TankPorn,3bqnj2,0000013,2,Wed Jul 1 18:21:55 2015 UTC,Leo 2a7 fr the win (Your gonna find alot of responses are personal opinions due to the fact that the m1a2 is the only one that has seen combat. possibly the challenger has too but i dont care)
TankPorn,3bqnj2,dasreactionary96,2,Wed Jul 1 11:08:41 2015 UTC,"M1A2 SEP, or the K2 Black Panther.  Of course, it's pretty much all personal bias, but we can for sure discount the T-90."
TankPorn,3bqnj2,PerryGriggs,3,Wed Jul 1 11:16:46 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing that economic efficiency isn't a factor, because the T-90 has by far the lowest unit cost, as well as best mileage."
TankPorn,3bqnj2,ExplosiveMachine,2,Wed Jul 1 13:15:18 2015 UTC,"Sure, but in combat capabilities, it's nowhere near the best.  Obviously there is more to being the best tank other than combat, but the T-90 just isn't up to scratch. Combine the cost and capabilities, and I'd take the M1A2 SEP and the K2 any day.  Hell, I'd take most any other modern tank, the T-90 is just a death trap."

TankPorn,3bqnj2,rangamatchstick,4,Wed Jul 1 15:55:24 2015 UTC,"The armor on the T-90 isn't very good, the ammo stowage as you mentioned, and the cramped crew space all add up to me never wanting to get inside a T-90."

TankPorn,3bqnj2,PerryGriggs,3,Wed Jul 1 17:16:07 2015 UTC,"Besides the upgraded fire control and targeting systems, the only additional armour to the A2 is the additional DU sheets on the front of the turret.

TankPorn,3bl0k6,InWadeTooDeep,7,Tue Jun 30 13:15:34 2015 UTC,"The way it works is the military creates requirements, usually ""impervious to X gun at Y range"". The designers then usually round up the armour value (no one is going to roll a 55 mm plate when you already produce a 60 mm plate, the technologists are going to kill you) unless it's necessary, then you get your result.  Except in nazi Germany, there Hitler has a large red button marked ""dicker Panzerung"" on his desk that he presses whenever he feels like it."
TankPorn,3bl0k6,TankArchives,3,Tue Jun 30 13:27:13 2015 UTC,"Then what the fuck happened to the T-54/55 and Leopard I? they are both weirdly armoured, immune to some things but vulnerable to others (of the time) in an almost arbitrary pattern."
TankPorn,3bl0k6,InWadeTooDeep,4,Tue Jun 30 14:10:10 2015 UTC,"Different ammunition types behave differently on armor. You should read on how it works, and how and why military doctrine affects the armor, speed and gun of a tank."
TankPorn,3bl0k6,Fradra,5,Tue Jun 30 16:42:38 2015 UTC,"The T-54 was designed to be immune from the front to the current weapons of the enemy (high velocity 88/105 mm guns), but everyone realized that making a medium tank that can resist them from the side is not possible."
TankPorn,3bl0k6,TankArchives,2,Tue Jun 30 18:52:25 2015 UTC,"That would have made sense, but while the front hull was immune to contemporary tank guns the turret was not, and the side and rear of the hull had different levels of armour which did not offer significantly different levels of protection.  The Tiger II makes sense to me, 100mm on the lower plate, 150mm on the upper plate, and 185mm on the turret face with 80mm on the sides and rear of both the turret and hull, and 40mm on the roof, deck, and floor. It was designed to be immune to all contemporary anti-tank weapons from the front and resistant to most lighter weapons from everywhere else, clear cut and simple."
TankPorn,3bl0k6,InWadeTooDeep,2,Tue Jun 30 19:54:02 2015 UTC,"Well the Tiger II hardly went anywhere, did it. Like, literally.  For the Leopard 1 it is known that the designers just threw armour out the window, they realised that nothing will stop HEAT and they instead focused on making it mobile and accurate, and the armour values that it does have are there to keep out grenades and smaller calibre and autocannon fire."
TankPorn,3bl0k6,ExplosiveMachine,1 point,Wed Jul 1 05:48:46 2015 UTC,Mobility is not the topic of discussion...  Why would it have different levels of armour all over the place if it was only meant to protect against autocannons and lighter weapons?
TankPorn,3bl0k6,InWadeTooDeep,2,Wed Jul 1 11:33:26 2015 UTC,"I'm interpreting ""Why would it have different levels of armour all over the place"" as ""why isn't it as boxy as the Tiger II"", because the only way you can have such homogeneous armour values is if all the plates are flat.   problem is, flat armour is not efficient. Sloped armour is, because less thickness at a greater angle can be the same as more thickness and less angling. Play around with these models from WoT with accurateish armour values: Tiger II, T-54 and you will see that the T-54 has more or same armour on the front with less thickness (save the very front of the turret). less needed thickness means less needed armour means less weight, which increases the tank's mobility, and that's something the Tiger II failed at, and that rendered it tactically useless.  Second example of ""all over the place"" is the Leopard 1. The front is thicker because that's what the enemy will be firing at, the tank doctrine of the time (and today) was longer-ranged. If the enemy gets to shoot at your side you've already lost.   Logically, the highest armour is in the front so it can withstand multiple autocannon and lighter weapon hits, not just one, like the side can. The top front slope of the leopard is segmented in two, with differing armour values, that's because the top part is at a greater angle, meaning it can have less armour. Same goes for bottom half. The top of the sides is also thicker than the lower sides, with the top being 45mm sloped while the bottom is 35 unsloped, that's because the top is more likely to be shot at than the bottom (if the tank is in a prepared dug-in position), and the bottom is covered partially by the roadwheels, which are quite thick pieces of steel. T-54 has it the same, with upper side armour being 80mm with lower only 20, because it's covered by the big roadwheels.  Second is weight. The front has to be more armoured in a sense, because the front of the tank is relatively empty (save the driver) while the rear houses the hefty power pack, so the weight has to be balanced out across the suspension.  Third is component layout. You will notice that the bottom of the hull gets thinner towards the rear, it goes from 35 to 16 right after the turret. That's to protect the crew and ammo from mines, while the powerpack in the rear isn't as vital. Same goes for the side armour example.  Just like tank's aren't simple boxes, armour layout isn't simple either, with most modern tanks being covered in reactive or composite armour as well."
TankPorn,3bl0k6,ExplosiveMachine,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:09:28 2015 UTC,"Here is a probably not entirely accurate illustration of what I am talking about.  The armour levels are all over the place, would it not have made entirely more sense to divide the armour into three or four even levels? primary armour on the front of the hull, front of the turret, and side of the turret to resist heavy anti-tank guns, secondary armour on the side of the hull, rear of the hull, and rear of the turret to resist lighter anti-tank weapons, and ternary armour on the floor/deck/roof to resist rifles and grenades and shit? It may have even been simpler.  And my point about the T-54 was that during testing it was found that the hull armour could only be penetrated at less than 500m with the best munitions available while the turret could be penetrated out to 2000m with standard ammunition, that does not make much sense as a design."
TankPorn,3bl0k6,InWadeTooDeep,2,Thu Jul 9 21:00:21 2015 UTC,"Okay I'll explain to you the Maus. The strip of thicker armour (yellow) on the front roof is to protect the two crew members in there. The side armour is segmented into the solid armour (the sponsons, orange) and the armour that covers the tracks (blue). Same goes for the front and back, you can clearly see where the track skirts are. Otherwise it has really homogeneous armour levels, one of the most smooth designs.  And no it wouldn't really make sense to divide it that simply. I may have poorly explained, but it has a lot to do with ballistic shape and weight management, and none of these applied to Maus.  You don't select armour values first and build the tank around that. You lay down requirements for gun, ammo count, crew, engine, and approximate armour requirements. Then you design a tank that could house the crew, ammo, gun and engine, and apply armour appropriately to it's shape.   If you do make armour the priority, you get the useless monstrosity that is Maus.  Also I don't know where you got the T-54 test data from, but you can clearly see in that online tool that it has the more armour on the turret front (the flat part, 220mm) than the hull has effective armour (200mm), and it only gets better toward the turret sides. So anything that didn't go through the hull couldn't have gone through the turret. in general, russian tanks have a very good ballistic shape with highly sloped fronts and bulbous turrets that deflect shells easily, and there's a reason they've been using it up until they introduced ERA."
TankPorn,3bl0k6,ExplosiveMachine,3,Fri Jul 10 07:20:27 2015 UTC,those tanks are essentially the first main battle tanks and the end of the light/medium/heavy tank era. The reasoning being HEAT Ammo became so good that raw thickness of armor was pointless. as HEAT would penetrate it anyway. So they said fuck it. Enough armor to stop small arms. But make it fast and big gun.
TankPorn,3bl0k6,maverck,0,Tue Jun 30 22:21:31 2015 UTC,"The T-54 is almost 20 years older than the Leopard I and was immune to pretty much everything of the time, but only on the front hull.  How much do you think it takes to stop small arms? 70mm at a slope? 35mm at a slight slope? 25mm flat? why all of them?"
TankPorn,3bl0k6,InWadeTooDeep,3,Wed Jul 1 11:46:19 2015 UTC,"How was it weird? The turret front, hull front, and turret sides were all the most likely placed to be hit so they were correspondingly the heaviest armor. The sides were just flat so to provide any meaningful protection they had to be thick. The thing was essentially tactically immobile so the rear had to be very thick too as if even the slightest thing went wrong it would likely be surrounded. Really that's the core of it, the Maus was so slow as to be only a little better than a fixed position so it had to have thick armor all around or it would be an easy kill."
TankPorn,3bl0k6,jdmgto,3,Tue Jun 30 13:23:23 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, but why not have a thinner front plate since it is going to be sloped? or a turret without a shot trap? or similar rear armour for the turret and hull?"
TankPorn,3bl0k6,InWadeTooDeep,5,Tue Jun 30 14:11:23 2015 UTC,"Because the Maus wasn't ever designed logically. It was designed to essential be, ""TEH BESTIST EVAR!"" Seriously though, it was designed to be impervious so I imagine anyone who suggested thinning the armor was summarily executed. The shot trap front turret is because Ferdinand Porsche was a moron. He honestly could not help himself with that stupid design even after it was a proven danger to the tanks. As for the turret, most tanks have heavier armor on the rear of the turret than the hull because the turret rotates and is far more likely to be hit than the hull rear."
TankPorn,3bl0k6,jdmgto,-4,Tue Jun 30 14:15:59 2015 UTC,"Your comment is very shitty, and I dont have time to correct all, so ill just say that Porsche was well aware of the shot trap. The turret was made so to save weight on an already heavy monstrum.  The design is early, so they would probably (later on) changed it as they did on the King Tiger and Panther V."
TankPorn,3bl0k6,Fradra,2,Tue Jun 30 16:39:38 2015 UTC,"Your comment is very shitty,   No, my comment is spot on. The Maus was never a serious tank. It was only marginally less stupid than the Ratte. It was only kept alive because of Hitler's lunacy. None of the decisions made with respect to it's design were made with any real grasp of combat but in an effort to give the aforementioned lunatic a chubby. The Tiger II, as much as I love it, was already pushing the impractically large and well armored thing to it's limits. It's 150mm UFP at 50 degrees from vertical was already impervious to things like the US 90mm HVAP, and Russian 122mm AP at ZERO meters. You could kiss the plate with the gun, fire, and it wouldn't go through. The only guns you'd face that were bigger than that were mounted on cruisers and battleships. So why lay the plate back another five degrees and increase the thickness another 50mm beyond impenetrable? Because 55 is bigger than 50 and 200 is bigger than 150. There's no logical reason to do it. American TD's had 76mm and some 90mm guns and the Pershing barely saw combat in Europe before VE day and it was a proto-type. Even then, it had a 90mm gun which couldn't shoot through a Tiger II's UFP at any range. The 200mm front plate didn't make the Maus any better, it just made it heavier.   ill just say that Porsche was well aware of the shot trap. The turret was made so to save weight on an already heavy monstrum.   Ha-fucking-Ha. Being well aware of a deficiency doesn't excuse you from moving ahead with it. After all, with all the weight wasted in the front plate of the tank a huge vulnerability was opened up since hits to the lower 1/3rd of the mantlet would deflect shots down onto the 50mm armor of the deck. While the guns I outlined above might not go through the UFP, they would slice right through 50mm of armor even on a ricochet and go right down into that fire prone engine compartment. Because for whatever reason Porsche could not get it through their heads that they were the only people who thought complicating a tank with an electric drive system was a good idea. They had already tried and failed multiple times to get an electric drive system into a tank but hey, this tank was one giant rolling failure so who fucking cared. So yeah, save weight... by giving a nice big ""Shoot here"" spot on an otherwise impenetrable front profile. Besides, because of the curvature much of the extreme ends of the curve were accomplishing little but adding weight.   The Maus was stupid from top to bottom. Even if it had been deployed in battle all the Allies would have had to do was just wait for it to break down or get to the first river and encircle it. Hell, given that it would only do about 9 miles an hour on flat even ground they could have done the encircling at any time. Or hell, given it's nearly stationary just bombard it with artillery or ground attack aircraft until it's immobilized and then use it for target practice.  So yeah, sorry if I don't take this joke of a tank seriously, but then again, no one ever did."
TankPorn,3bl0k6,jdmgto,5,Tue Jun 30 17:28:03 2015 UTC,"I doubt that driving into combat was in the Maus' future, maybe it would end up dug into a crossroads in Berlin at best."
TankPorn,3bl0k6,TankArchives,6,Tue Jun 30 18:56:15 2015 UTC,"No, the Maus was never going to go anywhere. Even when it was being designed and Germany's infrastructure wasn't quite yet being aggressively curb stomped by the Allies just moving a Maus from one location to another would have been a challenge and by challenge I mean in many cases completely impossible. Even if you could move it why would you bother? What was it supposed to fight? The 128mm gun it was originally designed with was shooting through the glacis, engine blocks, and rear hulls of most allied tanks on VE day. What was the purpose of a 150mm gun? Well 150 is bigger than 128...  It's just such a phenomenally stupid vehicle."
TankPorn,3bl0k6,jdmgto,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:08:54 2015 UTC,"I don't know who designed it, but there should be a turret without the shot trap, looks like the E-100 one that is in wot but has more armor on the sides, and petrol-electrical drive, it has it's advantages, full torque from 0 rpm, much more control on the track speeds, so there might have been interest in that, probably not reliable enough to have on a war machine, but modern train use this tech. Other than that, yeah, it was not an ""efficient"" tank, but look up the Tzar tank, it's even worse :D"
TankPorn,3bl0k6,EnricoMicheli,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:09:05 2015 UTC,"Yes, there are advantages to an electric drive, however it was certainly not ready to be put in an operational tank and it's still questionable if the advantages are worth it."
TankPorn,3bl0k6,jdmgto,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:39:10 2015 UTC,"To be fair (well, I don't have a source at hand, so might not be so ""fair"") the tester who drives the Maus said it drove exceptionally, better than a Panzer IV, which says it was already better than the first Porsche designs, problem was that Germany's way of designing tanks aimed too much at a state of the art high tech machines the most comfortable to use, that in theory work well but don't cope with reliability, and while that might intrigue me as an object by itself, in war reliability should have a much higher priority."
TankPorn,3bl0k6,EnricoMicheli,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:50:14 2015 UTC,"Well yeah, the Maus would likely drive like a dream because of it's shear size. Things that would bounce a Pz IV around the Maus would just plow through or be too big to be effected by. The problem is that no matter how well it drives it's not driving there faster than 10mph at best. In the field, forget it."

TankPorn,3bgofb,WulfeHound,3,Mon Jun 29 13:59:16 2015 UTC,"Sounds like a fake. They did however design a 20mm gun mount for AA purposes on the Maus. The whole turret needed to be moved to aim it, and it was going to be horribly ineffective, but it was something."

TankPorn,3bgofb,uggmun,3,Mon Jun 29 15:00:10 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I've heard exactly one theory for the Maus that made sense, and that was that Hitler intended to use it as semi-mobile coastal anti-ship batteries, to plug holes in the defenses along the North Sea. The fact that it's self powered and heavily enough armoured to defend itself during transit is a plus. The fact that it can't cross a single bridge in Europe isn't."

I don't believe heavily in flash on cameras, and in my excitement I had my camera set to landscape mode instead of museum mode.  Oops.  I hope this doesn't take away too much from the photos, and I fully reccomend this museum if you ever happen to go to Germany.  Here's a fun little story explaining how I finally got to this museum:  In 2008, back when I was 11 I got a book called Weapons of World War II, a book containing, well... Weapons of World War II.  It had guns, tanks, armored vehicles, aircraft, ships, even special weapons.  Aircraft were the first weapons of WWII that I was interested in, sparked by the history channel series ""Dogfights"".  Next came tanks after a similar series called ""Patton 360"".  My parents recognized my interests and bought this as a gift for my 11th birthday (I still have the book with me 7 years later).  After watching Patton 360 I knew a fair bit about US tanks, and wanted to learn about the other side.  I was especially in love with the Jagdpanther because of it's sleek appearance, symmetry, and clean angles.  The Jagdpanther page of this book looked like this:    http://i.imgur.com/dAG8ukQ.jpg  See that photo of the Jagdpanther in the bottom right of the page?  http://i.imgur.com/X4KXRNZ.jpg  That peice of information had been in my head for a little more than 7 years, until finally this year I went to my long-awaited Munster Tank Museum."

They too have a lot of the German icons: Panther, Tiger, etc.  One of my favourites was the Jagdtiger, so huge.   The most epic part of the day IMO was seeing Tiger 131 drive around the arena. She's surprisingly fast for such a big lady.   Oddest ones out were the Tortoise superheavy breakthrough tank, and the TOG II* (best described as a slow, far too heavy steel snake with paper armour and a 17-pounder)."

The E8 designation refers to the HVSS system and that tank does not have it.   Also the Comet had pretty thick armor for a medium tank... though it wasn't angled.

Reliable torsion bars, they stopped with the christie suspension from T-34s, 100mm high velocity gun, the smoke remover on the barrel, no radio operator and hull gun, i think it even had a stabilizer back then too. Over the years as you said it got to the point where today it is still somewhat usable since you can upgrade it, for example i think a russian company sells a modern turret pack with a british 105mm L7 gun."
TankPorn,3bcz34,KorianHUN,1 point,Sun Jun 28 12:37:13 2015 UTC,for example i think a russian company sells a modern turret pack with a british 105mm L7 gun.   Why?  Pretty sure it's inferior to the 125mm in terms of penetration with modern ammunition.
TankPorn,3bcz34,3rdweal,1 point,Sun Jun 28 15:45:39 2015 UTC,I'm guessing logistics. I don't know if the 105 is a standard NATO round but it'd be more convenient to adopt it if so.
TankPorn,3bcz34,uggmun,2,Sun Jun 28 15:59:14 2015 UTC,L7 gun versions are used by the US armed forces. HERE. It is one of the most widely used tank guns on earth.
TankPorn,3bcz34,KorianHUN,-2,Sun Jun 28 18:13:26 2015 UTC,"Do you have any idea how advanced the 105 ammo is? Russia uses 125 in T-90 and USA uses 120mm on Abrams. Russia i think also uses 125 on T-72. Due to having training rounds in Iraq, the iraqui T-72s got rekt by abramses with real DU penetrators. While the 105 is a few millimeters less wide, it still can penetrate the same tanks with DU rounds as a 125. Remember, it is the ammo, not the cannon."
TankPorn,3bcz34,KorianHUN,5,Sun Jun 28 18:11:53 2015 UTC,"While 105mm ammunition is still powerful enough to be relevant on the modern battlefield, a few mm make a significant difference.  A 120mm bore has over 30% more cross sectional area than a 105mm bore, and since force = pressure x area, for the same chamber pressure this gives a lot more force to the projectile.    Don't forget that even the L/44 120mm gun was considered to be inadequate to deal with armor advances leading to the creation of the L/55 with a longer barrel to squeeze even more performance out of the gun."
TankPorn,3bcz34,3rdweal,1 point,Sun Jun 28 18:29:40 2015 UTC,Meanwhile russians developed a long line of tank launched ATGMs. Where can i read about things like what you said?

TankPorn,3bcz34,uggmun,2,Sun Jun 28 16:09:47 2015 UTC,"Since it's based on the T-54, how would it fair against an Abrams or Challenger 2? I feel like it'll just scratch the paint on the Abrams"
TankPorn,3bcz34,NoMoreOreos,9,Sun Jun 28 12:10:14 2015 UTC,It could theoretically take out a early model Abrams or the export version ones (because of armor packs and stuff) but still if I were in a T-55 and saw an Abrams I would get the fuck out of the tank because it would mean that he saw me 2 minutes ago.

TankPorn,3b9vdp,darthjammer224,8,Sat Jun 27 04:57:56 2015 UTC,"The war museum here in Korea has a bunch of tanks, it's quite interesting how the sizes are. Some of the russian and chinese stuff (t59, su100) had a generally smallish feel to them, although the su100 was quite long. The Shermans were really tall and imposing, as were the various Pattons. They had a T34-85 too, very large feeling.  When you see 'em in pictures sometimes the scale doesn't come through... it's only when you see a dozen guys sitting on top of one, or you actually stand next to one in person, that you realize how fucking big they are.  One of the more modern Korean tanks, their K1 (which i think is actually replaced with something even newer now?) was huge."
TankPorn,3b9vdp,QuerulousPanda,3,Sat Jun 27 13:42:49 2015 UTC,"Stood next to an Abrams at a local air show and looked down the barrel. Absolutely massive vehicles. There was a line to sit in the driver's console, but it was really long (and I'm kinda big and questioned my ability to fit).  I've heard it said that the M4 tanks were constructed so large in part because most of their models (including the original ones) were powered by aircraft radial engines. That said, every nation they were exported to seemed to have high praise for the amount of room inside.  Plus, it probably made the loader's job much easier. Until they started mounting British 17-pdrs (I can't comment on the American 76mm or the 105mm howitzers), I'm fairly certain that not much room was taken up by the gun breech."
TankPorn,3b9vdp,FoxtrotZero,3,Sat Jun 27 19:25:40 2015 UTC,"The m4 had a crew of 5 didn't it? Just think about how much room you need to fit that many people, along with a giant engine, a bunch of guns, a bunch of ammunition for those guns, lots of gas, and so on... it adds up for sure."

TankPorn,3b9vdp,FoxtrotZero,1 point,Sat Jun 27 20:21:32 2015 UTC,"Yes, I believe you're talking about the new K2 Black Panther. But it's more of a complementary MBT to the more commonly used K1A1 MBT (many of them gradually being replaced by the new K1A2 upgrade). The K1 is a great main battle tank, its design was based on the M1 Abrams and the K1A2 upgrade shows it won't be gone for a long time.  Interesting fact about the K2 Black Panther: in 2014, it surpassed the French AMX Leclerc MBT in price record."

TankPorn,3b9vdp,HorrificAnalInjuries,2,Sat Jun 27 17:28:07 2015 UTC,"the most popular version of the Sherman with GIs were the 105mm and 17 pdr versions, largely to do with the characteristics of those guns vs the rest of the guns the M4 accepted.  The 17 pdr was a great tank killer, and was effective even against the King Tiger, though only from the sides and rear, while every other gun that fired AP rounds were either ""worthless"" or ""almost worthless"" in comparison.  Yes, the later 76mm gun could take out panzer IVs and Vs (latter from the sides or rear), but the 17 pdr was the only really reliable anti-tank gun the Sherman ever mounted.  The 105mm gun was favored for another reason entirely, summarized best as ""dat high explosive performance!""  Even if those HE shells were used against tanks, they still gave even the King Tiger a bad day.  Blowing off tracks, rattling the tank (knocking crew out of their positions, among other things), damaging turret rings/optics/guns, sometimes even outright killing lesser German tanks (and just about every Japanese tank) though shear force of explosions.  The gun only got better (and was even more favored) when HEAT was introduced, giving the gun short-ranged killing power against ALL enemy tanks."
TankPorn,3b9vdp,WulfeHound,3,Sun Jun 28 15:47:20 2015 UTC,Except the 17lber was never used by the US and therefor could not be popular with GI's (unless you're referring to the British Army soldiers). The 75mm M3 was a pretty damn good all-around gun even in 1945 and only struggled against the Tiger/front of Panther/Tiger II. The 76mm M1/M1A1/M1A2 was already going to replace the 75mm before Normandy and would have been the main type used by the US during the invasion.
TankPorn,3b9vdp,HorrificAnalInjuries,1 point,Sun Jun 28 22:30:03 2015 UTC,"I am indeed counting the British variant of the tank, and I'm sorry for any misunderstanding on that part.  The 76mm gun was disliked by most troops due to its lower high explosive performance compared to the 75mm gun.  The reason why a slightly smaller gun had better performance with HE rounds was due to the 76mm's higher velocities, which required a thicker shell casing, and thus less room for HE filler.  So, in short, most men who could be given the choice between the 75mm M3 or any of the US 76mm guns would go for the M3, even though it struggled against several key tanks."
TankPorn,3b9vdp,HorrificAnalInjuries,2,Sun Jun 28 23:00:34 2015 UTC,"That's if they could get access to the 75mm, production of them stopped in mid to late 1944."

The T-72/T-90 is a bit unique because it has been constantly modernized since the early 70's, a T-90A  really is a generation apart from a T-72M and would curb stomp it just like an Abrams would stomp an M60."

It was simple and resilient enough, and a brilliant tank still can't beat 20 sufficient ones.  The explanation around the T-54 and profiles is actually correct, it is russian doctrine to design tanks with small profiles.  The one thing he did get definitely wrong is the ""T-64"".

The T-80 was a development of the T-64 but it came after T-72, but it had nothing to do with it. And then the T-90 is a development of the T-72.  Basically you have two lines that overlap in time, T-64 and T-80 were always technology demostrators while the T-72 and T-90 are budget/export cut-down models focused on effective operation rather than advanced technology.

TankPorn,3awiob,Lamb_Of_Columbia,2,Wed Jun 24 19:30:15 2015 UTC,"Cool video.   It's got some obvious flaws that imo would make it ineffective.:   It can't cross difficult terrain - the entire point of inventing tanks was to create something that could cross trenches, cratered battlefields and other shitty terrain that would immobilize other vehicle types. It seemed to lack the ability to actually point and aim its guns. Perhaps if they were mounted in casemate turrets, it might be more useful. As it is it seems mostly a terror weapon rather than a practical war machine.   I think it's a bit funny that they decided ""Hey lets get a bunch of soldiers to build this random thing and then have the propel it with human labor, they wont mind at all!""."

Add a week maybe.   Kharkiv malyshev plant works two shifts and can reactivate roughly two tanks per week,but this stat comes from Tanks in far worse shape than the two T-80s shown. capabilities of the factory are limited since there is a huge amount of ATO equipment waiting for repair,and they're trying to deliver as much T-84 oplot-Ms to the Royal thai army to complete a 200 million dollar contract (They have 30 left to complete) A couple of years ago someone decided to deactivate the plant and a huge amount of machine equipment was sold off,so this process has to be reversed too.

TankPorn,3amyo6,scaffaaa,5,Sun Jun 21 20:27:27 2015 UTC,"Interesting few days for Joachim Peiper.  He fought with the 1st  SS-Panzer Division Leibstandarte, formerly Hitler's personal bodyguard, under Wilhelm Mohnke, part of the 6th Panzer Army under Sepp Dietrich.  Fuel shortages, exacerbated by the use of King Tigers, which often encountered faulty suspensions, meant that only if the Ardennes offensive went just according to plan, on schedule, could it possibly succeed.    As anyone knows, things rarely go according to plan.  There were delays, and Peiper's attempts to reach the Meuse over the Salm and Amblève were thwarted by U.S. Army Corps of Engineers blowing up bridges.  When the weather cleared, his armored column came under attack by P-47's (which could be very effective tank killers, with their extremely high payloads of rockets and bombs compared to most attack aircraft).  Peiper ended up getting accused of failing his ""command responsibility,"" or the ""Yamashita Standard,"" a term which also ended up being applied to Yamashita Tomoyuki at the IMTFE, and Ernest Medina after the My Lai massacre, which stipulated that merely preventing illegal violence by troops, rather than ordering it, was an executable offense, a questionable standard according to some, who deemed it a form of ""victor's justice.""  Peiper ended up being put on trial at Dachau, part of a sort of smaller Nuremberg.  A lot of questions got raised on the trial's validity, and several successful requests were made for commutations of executions by General Lucius Clay, one of which Peiper was lucky enough to receive, being eventually released in 1956.  He got involved with the automotive industry, continued defending the SS's reputation, which he felt had been smeared by Allied propaganda at Malmedy and elsewhere, and had a lawsuit brought against him by Simon Wiesenthal and a few others for alleged responsibility in another massacre at Boves, in Italy, which was dismissed.  He lived in France in the 70's and kept using his real name, which apparently attracted the attention of the French Communist Party.  After receiving some threats, he sent his family back to Germany, and remained there himself.  His home was attacked, his home burned, and his body found with a .22 nearby, dead at 61, the attack widely assumed to have been from Communists, or possibly former French resistance.

It didn't take the Red Army long to figure out the thing had severe weaknesses, however, with an inexplicable lack of a machine gun (only rectified by the ""Elefant"" Tiger-P model in 1944), lack of side vision blocks, of course no rotating turret.  This made it extremely vulnerable to infantry, who would just let it pass and chuck grenades at it, place satchel charges, anything they wanted really, since the Ferdinand crew couldn't do anything about it and frequently didn't even see the infantry until the vehicle was burning and they had to jump out and get mowed down.  Also the crazy weight of 65 tonnes, which added to already existing German difficulties in towing and repairing damaged vehicles, and also led to mechanical breakdowns inherent in operating such a massive vehicle.  Like the Tiger I and Tiger II, it was amazing on paper, and amazing in real life when conditions were right, but conditions were too often not right and made the thing a giant resource vacuum when Germany couldn't afford it.

TankPorn,3akgoo,Hans-U-Rudel,3,Sun Jun 21 11:46:17 2015 UTC,10 degrees just isn't a lot. Anytime you push a track around on soft ground there is a chance you'll pop the track off.
TankPorn,3akgoo,Shaz-bot,1 point,Sun Jun 21 14:44:08 2015 UTC,That disadvantage applies to every casemate-style tank destroyer though and they remained popular throughout WWII and the early cold war era. A 20° gun sweep isn't all that constructive at the typical engagement ranges seen on the eastern front.
TankPorn,3akgoo,0000013,1 point,Sun Jun 21 21:54:06 2015 UTC,you forget the weight. Ferdinand was pretty much the only fixed-turret jagdpanzer that weighted above 50 tons (aside from the ridiculous jagdtiger) and weight has a LOT to do with how fast you cause yourself a big oopsie by pivoting. For example the post-war german kanonenjagdpanzer was mere 27 tons and even the swedish s103 was 42 tons at its heaviest.
TankPorn,3akgoo,countlazypenis,1 point,Mon Jun 22 09:08:11 2015 UTC,"I've seen that the crews were sometimes equipped with add-on curved barrels for their PDWs so they could just poke them out of the top hatch, or wherever, and blind fire."
TankPorn,3akgoo,uggmun,2,Sun Jun 21 16:50:28 2015 UTC,I like how they made the Krummlauf barrels instead of just putting an MG34 mount on the top hatch or a pintle mount in the first place.
TankPorn,3akgoo,USCAV19D,5,Sun Jun 21 18:58:56 2015 UTC,"If you definie ""the classic 88"" as the FlaK 18 and its derivitatives, then no, the Ferdinanand was not armed with that cannon. It had, rather, the substantially more powerful PaK 43, which was essentially the same weapon as the Jagdpanther and Tiger II."

TankPorn,3akgoo,Hansafan,2,Sun Jun 21 07:24:36 2015 UTC,"Like the Tiger I and Tiger II, it was amazing on paper, and amazing in real life when conditions were right, but conditions were too often not right and made the thing a giant resource vacuum when Germany couldn't afford it.   This was really the main problem/flaw in German armour at this time. They kept pouring R&D and production capacity into tanks that should theoretically be amazing in a decisively offensive war, but in reality they were fighting an increasingly defensive war/collapsing on all fronts. Faced with such a scenario, building huge steel monstrosities that are practically impossible to recover or repair in the field is pretty much a waste of resources.  Maybe it performs admirably for a day, then it's disabled for whatever reason and then your position gets overrun - RIP super-expensive tank."
TankPorn,3akgoo,Hetzer,1 point,Sun Jun 21 13:26:56 2015 UTC,"theoretically be amazing in a decisively offensive war   I think it's actually the opposite - the German tanks performed best on the defensive, where they didn't have to drive a lot.  Also, casemate tank destroyers performed best on the defensive, and Germany started making more and more of them as they were less expensive."

TankPorn,3ai56w,Hansafan,8,Sat Jun 20 12:06:11 2015 UTC,"I suppose it's stretching it a bit, but the sidebar does state TankPorn is for all things Battle Tanks, Armored Fighting Vehicles, Armored Cars, Self-Propelled Guns and Support Vehicles affiliated so I'll assume this one's legit.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vespa_150_TAP  As it says in the article, the gun(a US M-20 105mm recoilless rifle) isn't intended to be fired while mounted on the scooter - it was intended to operate in units of two scooters, one carrying the removable gun and its tripod, while the other carried the ammunition.  It all looks a bit silly, but I can't really think of any way to make a more stealthy/low-profile and nimble carrier for a 105mm."
TankPorn,3ai56w,dziban303,10,Sat Jun 20 12:12:53 2015 UTC,"Well, the article also says   The recoil is counteracted by venting propellant gases out the rear of the weapon which eliminated the need for a mechanical recoil system or heavy mounts, enabling the weapon to be fired from the Vespa frame.   Which is what any paratrooper worth the name would try at least once.  Anyway, I never heard if these were used in action, e.g. Vietnam or Algeria. Not that enemy tanks were in abundance in either theater..."
TankPorn,3ai56w,dziban303,4,Sat Jun 20 15:03:10 2015 UTC,"The wiki is badly worded then, since that paragraph heavily implies it was intended to do that(fire while mounted on the scooter). I suppose it could technically be fired while mounted, but there's also this: ""Due to the lack of any kind of aiming devices the recoilless rifle was never designed to be fired from the scooter; the gun was mounted on a tripod, which was also carried by the scooter, before being fired.""  I've never seen any mention of these things seeing active service, but they produced hundreds, so someone believed in the idea, at least."
TankPorn,3ai56w,LouisBalfour82,3,Sat Jun 20 15:09:43 2015 UTC,"The wiki is badly worded then   Yes, the article needs cleanup at the minimum and preferably more sources as well. There were a few irritations, e.g.   The 150 TAP's mounted M20 75 mm recoilless rifle,   Quotation mark to signify plurality? Lack of a preposition or article before M20?  I can't be arsed to deal with it, though; I'm playing video games."

Eastern Germany is lost (most of western Germany is too, so far as that goes.)  You're fighting in your capital city, which is surrounded, by the way.  Odds are excellent you wont see tomorrow, and your sacrifice will accomplish nothing. And yet they kept fighting."
TankPorn,3aaw5r,ethan_kahn,6,Fri Jun 19 00:42:31 2015 UTC,"They fought to hold off the Russians long enough to surrender to the western allies. It made sense in theory as the atrocities committed by the Russians in eastern Germany were well known by everyone behind the front lines. However, the western forces halted their advance as the Russians were promised Berlin and the surrounding region at the Yalta Conference.  The Russians were more than willing to fight for revenge so the other allies declined the opportunity to waste the lives of their countrymen in taking territory they'd soon have to relinquish."
TankPorn,3aaw5r,JustARandomCatholic,11,Fri Jun 19 18:00:59 2015 UTC,"They didn't want to be murdered and their families raped by the Russians.  To be fair, that is kind of what the Russians did through Germany on the way to Berlin...  Great recruitment material for the Volksturm."
TankPorn,3aaw5r,CruxMajoris,3,Fri Jun 19 05:27:16 2015 UTC,"It makes sense to me, to a point. I couldn't imagine giving up the fight, especially when the enemy is in your capital city.

TankPorn,3aaw5r,InWadeTooDeep,9,Thu Jun 18 16:46:27 2015 UTC,"While I haven't quite perfected my study of time travelling mind reading, I can think of two reasons. (Well, maybe 2.5)   Tarps are super handy. Tanks are very cramped. The outside of tanks is not very cramped. Might just be personal stowage. The schurzen, literally ""skirts"", on the sides of German tanks were intended to act as spaced armor, especially against Soviet AT rifles and later, shaped charges, ala the Bazooka. The tank lacks schurzen, so perhaps this was a form of substitute? While it obviously isn't perfect, it does cover much of the outer side plate and a fair bit of the gap between that plate and the wheel assemblies.    2.5 Something the Soviets did in urban fighting, Berlin especially, was attach bedsprings and other things they could find to the sides of their tanks, in an attempt to block the shaped charge effect of the Panzerfaust and Panzerschrek. Perhaps this was a similar make do effort to counteract stolen German AT rockets?"

Zimmerit was applied to german vehicles to prevent magenetic mines being attached. Perhaps this is a crude version, since the Tarp wouldn't be magnetic, preventing their use."

TankPorn,3aaw5r,airborneleaf,2,Sat Jun 20 09:16:19 2015 UTC,"It was discontinued mainly because the Germans were concerned that projectile impacts could ignite the Zimmerit, though of course that wasn't true.  Also waiting for the paste to dry added days to the production process and that wasn't really practical for the Germans at that stage of the war.  Not to mention an increase in infantry anti-tank weapons and the ever-heightening strength of new anti-tank rounds would have soon made magnetic mines, and therefore Zimmerit, obsolete before too long."

TankPorn,3a8izr,dohimer,2,Mon Jun 22 05:35:42 2015 UTC,It makes it easier to reload and it gets the gas out that's in the barrel after a shot.

TankPorn,3a40g4,PowderTrail,6,Wed Jun 17 07:15:52 2015 UTC,It was actually there to make the M31 harder to indentify.
TankPorn,3a40g4,TheHIV123,-1,Wed Jun 17 12:05:19 2015 UTC,"I can see that but why take the effort of removing the gun, putting a fake tube on for the image of a gun instead of just keeping it there where it can actually be useful?"
TankPorn,3a40g4,Hydrogeolo,3,Wed Jun 17 07:22:40 2015 UTC,"Space and weight. The gun is not just the barrel, the breech needs a lot of room because it needs to be move-able as well as having enough room for the gun recoil. You also need to store ammunition which takes a lot of space as well as a few more crewmen. This space was better uttilized for the vehicle's intended purpose, salvaging and repair."
TankPorn,3a40g4,Mjurp,0,Wed Jun 17 07:30:06 2015 UTC,M3 is a pretty big tank. I just think it would be more feasible to keep the gun and 10-15 rounds of ammo just in case. In contrast to removing it and putting up a visage of weapon.
TankPorn,3a40g4,Hydrogeolo,1 point,Wed Jun 17 07:36:43 2015 UTC,German did this too. Pz 2 and 3 were fitted with fake guns to act as scout / spotter.

TankPorn,39zt8p,kulkija,1 point,Tue Jun 16 06:14:29 2015 UTC,Loader is on the opposite side of the turret from the gunner.
TankPorn,39zt8p,TheHIV123,1 point,Tue Jun 16 12:54:58 2015 UTC,"I'm not so sure about that - the commander's cupola is on the left side, raised up with optics.  IIRC the Panther had the same configuration, with gunner and loader cosied up on the right side of the turret, though the loader's position would be lower down for easier access to shells."
TankPorn,39zt8p,kulkija,4,Tue Jun 16 16:03:54 2015 UTC,"I can assure you that the gunner sits on the same side of the turret as the commander, the right side of the tank. The loader sits on the left and has that whole side to himself to allow more room to handle the shells. The gunner sits low on the right side and right in front of the commander with the gun immediately to his left.   You can see the gunner's sight in the picture you linked (that hooded aperture that has a dent in it) and its on the same side as the commander.   I work actually work at a museum that has a T26E3 and I have spent a lot of time keeping the thing running. I took some interior pictures for this album:  http://imgur.com/a/DQDXl  The interior shots are about half way down.   The crew arrangement of the Panther is the same except that the commander and gunner are on the left side of the tank, not the right as was typical for American tanks.   Here is a cutaway of the Panther that shows how the gunner and commander say on te same side of the turret:  http://s1183.photobucket.com/user/Dowly/media-full//panther.jpg.html"

TankPorn,39n0vz,nat_noah,5,Sun Jun 14 00:56:57 2015 UTC,That's a french light tank (AMX 13) turret. Good idea to use that as the 75mm had about the same performance as the Panther gun.
TankPorn,39n0vz,Cohacq,1 point,Sat Jun 13 12:47:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I knew what it was. My comment was mainly regarding its odd looks :)  Also, they would have been smarter to use the Super Sherman's gun, a 105mm also developed from the Panther's gun.   Edit: statement redacted, memory failure resulted in information being incorrectly remembered. The caliber mismatch is also really awkward now that I'm aware of the mistake."
TankPorn,39n0vz,SJ_RED,4,Sat Jun 13 12:51:55 2015 UTC,"where did you get this idea that the 105mm was developed from the Panther's gun?  Even wikipedia tells you that it's a shorter version of the gun from AMX-30, which was developed independently of anything."

I normally consider myself fairly knowledgeable on WWII weapons and armour, so this is pretty awkward, haha. I actually read a comment elsewhere in the thread (the one that you replied to) and since I had read the AMX-gun-based-on-Panther-gun story a while ago but was a bit fuzzy on the details, it clicked together but I didn't realize the wrong information had clicked together. Since I was exploring Osaka's Umeda district, I did not have the time (or the consistent internet connection) to research further.   Sorry about that mix-up, and thanks for the correction."
TankPorn,39n0vz,SJ_RED,1 point,Sat Jun 13 15:12:45 2015 UTC,"The issue is that if the M-51's gun was made shorter, it would be a rather noticeable difference (in the order of 2 or more feet). Compare the barrel length of the M-51 to the AMX-30 and you'll see that they're the same. My best guess on the M-51 is that the use of a HEAT shell with a reduced propellant charge and the large muzzle brake lowered recoil to acceptable levels"
TankPorn,39n0vz,WulfeHound,1 point,Sun Jun 28 19:22:32 2015 UTC,Compare the barrel length of the M-51 to the AMX-30 and you'll see that they're the same.   Unless you have scaled blueprints you can't possibly say that. You have no idea how big the tanks are compared to each other. It is cited that the length was reduced from 56 caliber to 44. Take into note that the AMX 30 is larger than the Sherman and has a hefty mantlet that still counts toward gun length.  The second part is correct.

TankPorn,39n0vz,Hambeggar,4,Sat Jun 13 08:52:39 2015 UTC,a french 105mm gun based on the 76mm from the Panther.   The M50 uses a 75mm French gun based on the Panther's 75mm KwK42.  The M51 uses a French-made 105mm.
TankPorn,39n0vz,ExplosiveMachine,7,Sat Jun 13 09:59:35 2015 UTC,"You mixed up absolutely everything :P  A 105mm gun can't be based on a 76mm gun can it, and beside that the panther had a 75mm gun. The Sherman in the picture uses a French-built 105mm, it is the gun that the AMX-30 uses, but shortened and equipped with a muzzle brake because the sherman can't take the recoil. However, the tank next to it on the right uses a 75mm gun of the AMX-13, which is indeed based off of the Panther's gun. Israel bought some AMX-13s but they were too lightly armoured for their taste so they stuck it's gun minus the autoloader into the sherman.  edit: extra info"

TankPorn,39je1n,InfiniteApathy,17,Fri Jun 12 08:20:07 2015 UTC,"""The gun had a maximum range of 18,500 metres, with the 43.56 kg high-explosive shell which had a muzzle velocity of 880 m/s. The overall length of the gun was over 8 metres, with a barrel length of 7620 mm (50 calibers). The armour-piercing round, weighing 48.78 kg, had a muzzle velocity of 850 m/s. During test firing at armour plates with different thickness, the ISU-152BM have successfully penetrated a maximum of 203 mm of RHA at 90° at ranges of up to 2000 metres. However, during the trials, July 1944, the gun showed some deficiencies such as being difficult to operate by the crew, unreliable work of the muzzle brake and the breech block, and unsatisfactory performance of the shells. In addition, the gun, reaching out too far, was limiting the maneuverability of the fighting vehicle. The self-propelled gun carried 21 rounds of two piece (shell and charge) ammunition, and had a rate of fire of 2 rounds/min. It used the engine, transmission, running gear and electric equipment of the ISU-122.  The gun is so powerful, even the Königstiger can be destroyed after two direct hits in the front. Test with the Maus, the Maus is be destroyed after 8 direct hits in the front and after 1 or 2 shots in the side! Of course, the armor is not strong enough to bounce off 105mm shots from the improved King Tiger and 128mm shots from the Jagdtiger, Maus and more. So, hide you in the bushes and wait until you see your target."""

The whole ""stronk tenk"" circlejerk didn't originate out of thin air, it's a very Soviet approach to problem solving - sophistication be damned, just get the biggest fucking gun you can feasibly bolt onto a vehicle and derp it in the face until it dies from it."
TankPorn,39je1n,P-01S,5,Fri Jun 12 14:33:14 2015 UTC,I wonder if the shock could kill or disable the crew even without defeating the armor.

TankPorn,39je1n,Hansafan,6,Fri Jun 12 16:27:40 2015 UTC,"Yep. If you've ever been inside an enclosed metal compartment, such as a tank(meaning about storage tanks, silos etc. not vehicles) and someone hits it with a hammer on the outside, you can just try and imagine what it would sound like if you replaced the hammer with a howitzer impact. The crew would likely be deaf and shocked unconscious. Plus of course, ""interesting"" things can happen with hardened steel even if it's not penetrated.  I also imagine a lot of components would be damaged simply by the shock waves reverberating through the hull."
TankPorn,39je1n,P-01S,4,Fri Jun 12 16:54:19 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, how vigilant were the Germans about spall protection for the crew? Half the point of HESH rounds is that they spall the fuck out of the armor... A fuck-you sized HE shell would probably do the same."

Might be only from specific rounds though. Also I'm not really technical or science-y but I read something about the concussion waves from some rounds hitting, but mot penetrating, being enough to rupture soft internal tissues.

TankPorn,39je1n,DaftPrince,3,Fri Jun 12 12:45:21 2015 UTC,I can see why it never saw service. Having the 18.5 km range of that gun makes the armor a bit redundant.
TankPorn,39je1n,InWadeTooDeep,5,Fri Jun 12 12:44:17 2015 UTC,"Just because it can reach that distance it doesn't mean it could hit a tank sized target at that range.  While we love to think of ""tank sniping"" as a common occurrence, most armor engagements in WW2 happened well below 2000 yards."
TankPorn,39je1n,Hansafan,2,Fri Jun 12 13:26:18 2015 UTC,"I figured it was intended for indirect fire. I can't imagine they needed such a powerful AP shell before HEAT was reasonably available, and if they were planning to fire HEAT or HE the barrel length only helps with effective range anyway."

TankPorn,39hw12,Sadukar09,3,Fri Jun 12 00:40:29 2015 UTC,"~~You do understand that CITV cover plate indicates it's an A1?  M1 Abrams base model has no CITV cover.~~   Edit: CITV cover means it's A1, but it's still referred to as base model at the factory."
TankPorn,39hw12,ibuildtanks,-1,Fri Jun 12 01:12:54 2015 UTC,You do realize that we do not build M1's anymore so base mod is M1A1.
TankPorn,39hw12,Sadukar09,3,Fri Jun 12 19:12:29 2015 UTC,The base model is M1. M1A1 is an upgrade to the M1. Just because the M1 is phased out doesn't make the A1 its own stand alone tank. Which is what being a base model would mean.  Wrong and wrong.
TankPorn,39hw12,ibuildtanks,1 point,Fri Jun 12 20:47:45 2015 UTC,"I'll explain it easier for you, if you go down to your local Ford dealer and ask for a BASE model F150, are you getting a truck from the 40's or whenever it came out? No, you would be getting a 2015 base model. Since you cannot buy, or build a M1, it would make the base model, or the cheapest one you can buy, the M1A1."
TankPorn,39hw12,yawningangel,1 point,Fri Jun 12 21:11:00 2015 UTC,"Chassis on the F150 change constantly.  Chassis on the M1 has stayed nearly same. M1 Abrams can be rebuilt into M1A1 or M1A2.

If you go to the tank store, which in GDLS's case is in Sterling Heights, Michigan, they will gladly sell you a base mod, or M1A1, or still try to get the M120 they have sitting there sold. But if you ask for an M1, you will be very disappointed when they tell you the price to restart the scratch build capabilities in Ohio....  Iraq wanted new also until they saw the price. We told them to buy base mods built in Egypt, but they wanted ""new"" from USA, not Egyptian crap or something.   Only NATO can purchase upgraded Abrams. Most everyone else gets base mod."

TankPorn,39hw12,happyshlappy,3,Sat Jun 13 03:44:53 2015 UTC,More than likely we blew it up so the enemy couldn't take it (maybe it ran out of gas or was damaged some other way) or on accident. Unfortunately the U.S. has a habit of sending a group of A-10s at our own guys.
TankPorn,39hw12,ibuildtanks,2,Fri Jun 12 00:53:35 2015 UTC,"That seems fairly reasonable. Also, do you know if any Abrams have been destroyed by enemy fire?"
TankPorn,39hw12,EvilGnome01,3,Fri Jun 12 06:03:58 2015 UTC,"You know I personally don't but IIRC it's less than 20 that were totally destroyed. Normally if they take damage (not very often) we ship them back to the U.S., strip them down, and put in all our fancy new toys. Again iirc we haven't made new Abrams chassis since the early 90's.

TankPorn,39hw12,Gerbils74,4,Fri Jun 12 15:10:01 2015 UTC,"Quite a few.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M1_Abrams   Several Abrams that were irrecoverable due to loss of mobility or other circumstances were destroyed by friendly forces, usually by other Abrams, to prevent their capture.[25] Some Abrams were disabled by Iraqi infantrymen in ambushes during the invasion. Some troops employed short-range anti-tank rockets and fired at the tracks, rear and top. Other tanks were put out of action by engine fires when flammable fuel stored externally in turret racks was hit by small arms fire and spilled into the engine compartment.[26][27] A majority of Abrams damaged (post-invasion) were by improvised explosive devices (IEDs).[28] By December 2006, more than 530 Abrams tanks had been shipped back to the U.S. for repair.[29]  Due to the vulnerability of tanks in urban combat, the Tank Urban Survival Kit (or TUSK) is being issued to some M1 Abrams. It adds protection in the rear and side of the tank to improve fighting ability in urban environments.[30]  In May 2008, it was reported that an American M1 tank had also been damaged by an RPG-29, which uses a tandem-charge high explosive anti-tank warhead to penetrate explosive reactive armor (ERA) as well as composite armor behind it, in Iraq.[31][32] The U.S. considered the RPG-29 threat to American armor high and refused to allow the newly formed Iraqi Army to buy it, fearing that it would fall into the insurgents' hands.[33]"

TankPorn,39hw12,Clovis69,10,Thu Jun 11 23:31:41 2015 UTC,"Yes, but this was a decade or two ago.  Since then, newer threats have emerged, mainly better ATGMs and even much more effective shoulder-fired rockets.  Because the Challenger 2s upgrade programs have fallen very far behind schedule, current Challengers would have a very hard time dealing with these new threats."

So the US used the Abrams in urban fights a lot in Iraq and lost handfuls - that shows they are still viable.  Compare that to the 1995 battle of Grozny where the Russians lost 62 to 105 tanks in three days. That showed that the Russian tactics and armor were not viable in the modern urban battlefield.  I'm sure T-80s and T-90s would have faired better...but probably not as well as M1s and Challengers have"

That showed that the Russian tactics and armor were not viable in the modern urban battlefield.   Bolded for emphasis. You can have the best tanks in the world. If you have bad crew and commanders, it isn't going to do much else but explode into scrap metal.  T-80s are good tanks. They just were awful for urban operations against hardened Chechens (many were former Soviet Army). Even more so when the crews are inexperienced, and not fully equipped. Many T-80s went into battle without their ERA loadout, or went into it with the fake metal ERAs boxes instead of live ERAs.  Modern NATO tanks wouldn't fare much better if they took the place of the Soviet tanks (maybe their crew would've lived longer) in the same situation."

In the Type 90's case it is a licence-produced Rhinemetall gun, but for the Type 10 it is an indigenous gun designed by Japan Steel Works, with a new type of APFSDS. Both have autoloaders.  Secondary armament is the same: a licence-produced M2 Browning .50 cal above the commander's hatch, and a coaxial Sumitomo Type 74 7.62mm machine gun, which can be removed by the crew and used as a normal infantry support weapon.  The Type 90 weighs 50 tons, and the Type 10 weighs 44 tons (varies depending on modular armor configuration). The decrease in weight was one of the main points of the Type 10, as the Type 90 was too heavy to freely operate in most parts of the country.  Both have a top speed of 70km/h but the Type 10 is able to maintain the same speed in reverse.  That's it off the top of my head.  What else would you like to know?"

TankPorn,39ar14,WhiteRevan,2,Wed Jun 10 19:23:18 2015 UTC,"Personally I think they considered that it makes no difference, an RPG round hitting a window will penetrate just as well as a round hitting the rest of the side armour. As for protection again small arms, there would probably be extra armour inside so they could go to 'closed down' mode when needed; features such as this has been featured since the BMP-1.   Or maybe they did the extra trollish thing of making armour around those window extra strong to trick people who aim there. :)"

TankPorn,3988bf,tijger897,2,Wed Jun 10 09:22:28 2015 UTC,380mm... seems a little bit like overkill. They would have been better off just using a 155mm system really.

I'd say the majority comprised of either people who seemed to be the family of the GSDF soldiers or mil geek types. There were other people who didn't immediately stand out as either, who were probably more along the lines of straight-up patriotic types.  There was no flag waving, and when the anthem played on the speakers (before the demonstrations began), no one joined in. There were no anime mascots or things like that. There were a lot of kids so there were some child-oriented stuff, like a really big bouncy castle.

TankPorn,38sc9e,TehDinoReaper,9,Sat Jun 6 12:38:37 2015 UTC,"It's firing from a prepared position at distant targets, as opposed to leading an armored assault - that counts as artillery in my book, a frequent role for tanks during the Korean war and indeed such experience led to the provision if indirect fire equipment in the M60   The M60 series has instrumentation that allows indirect fire as ad-hoc artillery if needed by virtue of having a compass on board."

TankPorn,38sc9e,mr_bynum,1 point,Sun Jun 7 02:24:02 2015 UTC,"The Shermans sent to Korea were refitted with 76mm cannons in Japan because they were expected to deal with the North Korean T-34s which were causing all sorts of havoc against the 75mm armed M24s that were first sent. The version of the Sherman that was also used was the M4A3E8 which had been kept in reserve after the war, plus the howitzer armed Shermans were still around (but few in number)  The 75mm Shermans were actually retired in the late 1940s, the ones in Japan that were rearmed were basically left there from the war (they were M4A3s if you were wondering)."
TankPorn,38ts5r,Gnome_de_Plume,7,Sat Jun 6 19:24:18 2015 UTC,Yep Mark VIII.   The thing on the back was a water tank they added because the Liberty engines kept overheating. Which is not as awesome as what they first tried to do with that space: carrying another tank.

The type 79 uses a licensed copy of the L7, which has the bore evacuator in the middle of the barrel. Since it is also a t-54 derivative, it is visually similar to a type 59."

TankPorn,38e1zo,Retiv,0,Thu Jun 4 10:26:34 2015 UTC,"What about the Pershing, or T-44? Either can be considered an attempt to balance Mobility, Protection, and Firepower into what is now recognized as the MBT mold."
TankPorn,38e1zo,zach9889,14,Wed Jun 3 19:33:24 2015 UTC,"Again back then it was mainly down to what each nation classed their own tanks as, The T-44 was a medium tank and the Pershing was actually designated a heavy tank by the US till the M103 was created and was then re-designated a medium tank."
TankPorn,38e1zo,Bluenosedcoop,6,Wed Jun 3 19:40:03 2015 UTC,"The Pershing was designated as a heavy tank though. It was designed (originally) as an upgrade for the Sherman to respond to the threat of Germany's heavy tanks like the Panther and the Tiger, not to take on the role of that of a balanced MBT."
TankPorn,38e1zo,gijose41,0,Wed Jun 3 21:02:22 2015 UTC,"it could be said that the british centurion was also an attempt at dealing with those tanks, as it had it's thick armor specifically to counter 88mm guns"
TankPorn,38e1zo,PowderTrail,-1,Thu Jun 4 05:39:10 2015 UTC,"Britain considered the Centurion an MBT   So it's only a matter of ""who used/coined the designation first"" and not about actual ability of a vehicle to perform in multiple roles due to balanced design?"
TankPorn,38e1zo,Bluenosedcoop,8,Wed Jun 3 21:26:00 2015 UTC,"Back Post-WW2 and even now there's no clear definition of what an MBT is, It's not like all these countries were working together to decide such insignificant things because ultimately the designation fo the tank meant little when it was on the battlefield doing its job."
TankPorn,38e1zo,PowderTrail,1 point,Wed Jun 3 21:49:56 2015 UTC,"there's no clear definition of what an MBT is   Well, there is this:   A tank with a good balance of firepower, cross-country mobility, and armoured protection, and therefore capable of carrying out the roles of breakthrough, exploitation and infantry support.   And this one fits older platforms than Centurion.   It's not like all these countries were working together to decide such insignificant things   I did not imply that they did. What I said is this: Centurion is world's first MBT because somebody in Britain invented an ambiguous/meaningless term that ""stuck""."
TankPorn,38e1zo,Bluenosedcoop,2,Wed Jun 3 22:35:35 2015 UTC,"A tank with a good balance of firepower, cross-country mobility, and armoured protection, and therefore capable of carrying out the roles of breakthrough, exploitation and infantry support.   Just about every tank ever can fall into that definition that's why i said there's no CLEAR definition of what an MBT is because any attempt to describe it ends up being too vague/broad."
TankPorn,38e1zo,PowderTrail,3,Wed Jun 3 23:11:54 2015 UTC,I would argue that heavy and light tank categories do not fit the balance part. So since it's so vague I think it's fair to say that this is a buzzword used to describe modern medium tank. That's is my take anyway.
TankPorn,38e1zo,chechcal,1 point,Wed Jun 3 23:26:16 2015 UTC,"I think it has more to do with the phasing out of heavy tanks.  Prior to Centurion and other MBT's, you had a mix of medium tanks and heavy tanks.  The introduction of the MBT concept eliminated the heavy tank, and brought the focus to a single design that was mobile and mounted a heavy gun capable of defeating any opponent.    So long as your army is fielding a mix of medium and heavy tanks, you don't really have a main battle tank."
TankPorn,38e1zo,number676766,2,Thu Jun 4 00:22:59 2015 UTC,"I think it's contextual depending on a nation's armour doctrine. An MBT became the standard because we moved away from light/medium/heavy classifications into one platform that fulfilled and excelled in the tank role, one platform that did the same in fire support and troop transport/recce, one platform that did the same as an SPG platform, and so on."

TankPorn,38e1zo,FokkerPilot12,17,Wed Jun 3 19:13:11 2015 UTC,"While there is no universally accepted definition of what an MBT was back then, The T-34 and Panther most certainly fall right outside of what any country back then called an MBT and were called Medium tanks by both the Soviets and Germans.  First Soviet MBT was the T-54, British was the Centurion, German was the Leopard 1, American the M48 Patton, China would be the Type 59."
TankPorn,38e1zo,Yianna,2,Wed Jun 3 19:26:56 2015 UTC,"Soviet's first sort-of MBT was T-64A, but they still called it medium tank. Hell, new Armata-based tank T-14 is still called medium tank in factory documentations."
TankPorn,38e1zo,Yetanotherfurry,1 point,Thu Jun 4 10:27:48 2015 UTC,"Regardless of the evolution of the idea of an MBT it typically refers to a tank that can perform all the duties required of it ie, infantry support breakthrough and anti tank.  t-34 85 and panthers were definitely used in what easily could be considered an MBT role. Even though they didn't get a pretty little MBT label"
TankPorn,38e1zo,chechcal,5,Fri Jun 5 15:27:40 2015 UTC,They come from a time where the MBT wasn't an idea yet though right? Their official designations were medium tanks.
TankPorn,38e1zo,bathoz,0,Wed Jun 3 19:22:50 2015 UTC,Thats true but they were often used like modern MBTs. Allrounders that can fit more than the role of the Medium tank.
TankPorn,38e1zo,burning_phoneix,8,Wed Jun 3 22:01:33 2015 UTC,"The T-34 was simply the lightest and cheapest tank that the Soviets had that wasn't obsolete, and was deployed accordingly as a line unit, while the Panther was handled similarly to the PzIV and PzIII before it.  We may as well award the title to the PzIII, as it was the first tank to be used as an independent and capable combat vehicle."
TankPorn,38e1zo,HelmutVillam,7,Wed Jun 3 22:17:07 2015 UTC,"You can argue the same for the US Shermans and the British Cruisers then.  The concept of MBT hasn't even existed yet. Workhorse ≠ main battle tank  Also, others here pointed this out already, but I'll say it too: These were designated as medium tanks (except for the Cruisers)."
TankPorn,38cosv,3rdweal,9,Wed Jun 3 10:51:36 2015 UTC,"source video  Wiki article about this rather obscure vehicle.   The IT-1 (Russian: Истребитель танков–1, Istrebitel’ tankov–1, ‘tank destroyer-1’) was a Soviet cold war missile tank based on the hull of the T-62. The tank fired specially designed 3M7 Drakon missiles from a pop-up launcher. It saw a very limited service between 1968 and 1970. The large deadzone around the tank created by the missiles' minimum range combined with the limited amount of ammunition carried made it unpopular with the military.

As it was never fielded one can conclude that it did not work as planned, or if it did was considered to be an unnecessary complication."
TankPorn,387kz2,hopsafoobar,14,Tue Jun 2 12:40:14 2015 UTC,"I feel like adding an motor to the body of a sabot round is going to mess with the basic accelerating principle of the thing. On top of that, you need high tolerance miniaturised hypersonic engine components (expensive) and a fuel reserve (where?) without lowering the cross sectional density of the core projectile which is critical for penetration. Finally you're looking at doing this to a projectile which was already overmatched to almost all contemporary armour at combat ranges, and on top of that the limiting factor in lethal range (I'd expect) would be firing accuracy (what, 2000m in the 70s?) not round energy which would probably happily sail on for 3-5km.  So you're complicating something that works, adding huge expense and technical burden, to achieve the same performance at the same range. That's called over engineering. Take that money and spend it on better fire control systems."

TankPorn,387kz2,TankerD18,2,Wed Jun 3 00:48:24 2015 UTC,"It looks really cool. I wonder what got it canned though. I imagine it would have to be problems with getting the engine to work after firing it out of a cannon. Or if it was engine propelled the whole way then it probably wouldn't get going faster than the traditional penetrator.   Either way it must have led them to the conclusion that regular APFSDS, HEAT and cannon fired ATGMs are more effective."

TankPorn,37t72u,michaelconfoy,13,Sat May 30 04:51:00 2015 UTC,"In accordance with a directive from Hitler in March 1941, self-propelled artillery pieces mounted on the Pz.Kpfw.B2(f) chassis were to be created for the purpose of escorting the Flammenwerfer auf  Pz.Kpfw.B2(f) (flamethrowers installed in the captured French Renault Char B1bis chassis).  The Flammenwerfer auf Pz.Kpfw.B2(f) went into action against Russian positions in June 1941 without any escorting self-propelled artillery. Due to the mechanical unreliability of the Renault B2 chassis, the unit (Panzer-Abteilung (Flamm) 103) was disbanded by mid-July 1941, long before any of the 16 self-propelled guns were actually produced.   On 5 January 1942 the Waffenamt planned to produce the single series of 16 le.F.H.18 auf   Pz.Kpfw.B2(f) at the rate of five in January, five in February, and six in March 1942.  The machines were designated alphabetically in capital letters (A - P).  These were subsequently issued to the I.Abteilung/Artillerie-Regiment 93 of the 26.Panzer-Division, which was to be formed with three batteries each with four le.F.H.18 (SfI) in accordance with orders dated 22 September 1942.  As recorded in a strength report dated 31 May 1943, this unit still had fifteen 10.5 cm le.F.H. auf Fgst.Pz. Renault B2, of which 14 were operational. By this time, 12 ""Wespe"" had already been issued to the I.Abt./ArtI.Rgt.93 as replacements for the le.F.H.18/3 (Sf.) auf G.W.B2.  Orders were issued to transfer the G.W.B2 to the 90.Panzer-Grenadier-Division on Sardinia, but it has not been determined whether this order was carried out or what was the ultimate fate of these self-propelled guns. Unfortunately, none of these vehicles survived after the war."

TankPorn,37t72u,Wakka_bot,1 point,Sat May 30 14:31:40 2015 UTC,"One thing to keep in mind is that the B1s armor was very strong in comparison to the guns it faced, so not many were destroyed beyond repair"

TankPorn,37pdz3,SU37Yellow,3,Fri May 29 16:40:41 2015 UTC,That makes sense. I always forget that back then they didn't have all the awesome tools and materials available to us today that allow for such increased visibility of the battlefield - or rendering visibility irrelevant.

And yes, you're right, its speed was one of its biggest tactical advantages in combat, and combined with its great maneuverability, proved incredibly effective against enemy armored formations. If I recall correctly, there was a skirmish between the M18 Hellcats and German Panthers and Panzer IV's during the Battle of Arracourt, where eight Hellcats destroyed 19 panzers by making use of high ground, quick-fire maneuvers and its speed (while losing only three themselves)."

TankPorn,37pdz3,Noble-6,1 point,Sat May 30 08:52:22 2015 UTC,What exactly were the advantages of this over the Sherman?
TankPorn,37pdz3,FoxtrotZero,5,Fri May 29 19:56:35 2015 UTC,"The Sherman was designed to engage and support infantry, not primarily as a tank-to-tank combatant. In American armoured doctrine, when enemy armour was involved, the tank destroyers were called up. American Tank Destroyers were designed to be highly mobile. They have very little armour, but they were fast and fielded large guns in turrets. An open top increased visibility, situational awareness, and probably eased loading. They were designed to snipe, flank, and ambush enemy armour.  This is unlike the casemate tank destroyers built by the Germans and Soviets. This was mostly a cost-saving measure, as removing the turret made construction simpler and allowed for a larger gun (without having to make a ridiculously large tank, like the Konigstiger). It was possible to save on weight and inprove mobility, but thicker frontal armour was usually preferred. Obviously the casemate style didn't permit for the flexibility of a turret."
TankPorn,37pdz3,P-01S,4,Fri May 29 22:49:29 2015 UTC,"American TDs in general were designed to hunt tanks, so the typical bullet points would be   Light armor Open top Good visibility Light weight Fast Big, long range gun   He who shot first often shot last in WWII tank combat, so while some of it is hindsight, the idea behind lightly armored and heavily gunned tank hunters is sound. Shermans, by contrast, were designed to support infantry and attack things like bunkers and fortifications."
TankPorn,37pdz3,burgerbob22,3,Sat May 30 01:13:55 2015 UTC,"They were meant for different uses. So not really directly comparable. The Hellcat is much faster, better mobility, better visibility, but little to no armor protection."

TankPorn,37k9sb,NikkoJT,12,Thu May 28 16:24:42 2015 UTC,"IIRC they are stabilizers or recoil dampeners for the main gun. Because the Super Pershing had a larger gun than the regular Pershing, the original stabilization systems couldn't handle the extra weight without assistance. Some later models had improved internal systems and didn't need the external tubes.  quick e: I see someone's downvoted.

TankPorn,37k9sb,MrMann02,3,Thu May 28 16:35:18 2015 UTC,"They're hydraulic jacks (or springs or something) to cope with the added weight of the longer gun (also why the turret has the big counterweight on the back)  I'm not the person who downvoted you, BTW"
TankPorn,37k9sb,dmanbiker,2,Fri May 29 02:13:08 2015 UTC,"I'll add a bit to the other guy who responded to you. The longer gun on the Super Pershing was much longer and heavier than the normal 90mm gun on normal Pershings.  So you're basically right, except it has nothing to do with the recoil of the gun. It just helps with the elevation of the longer gun by balancing it better. It was mostly a stop-gap measure, since, as you said, later tanks with this gun did not need it.   It's also worth adding that on the up-armored Super Pershing that was in the European Theatre had weird spaced armor, bunny ear things on it because the big piece of applique steel they welded on over the gun-mantlet was so heavy that the gun would sag, so those pieces of steel were added as additional counter weights."

That's cool, I knew variations of the ""WoT SP"" existed but I didn't think they ever saw time in WW2, as I believe you say they didn't if the pictured one is the one of description. Sometimes  I have to remind myself though, pershings saw combat in Korea too."
TankPorn,37k9sb,NikkoJT,5,Thu May 28 16:51:30 2015 UTC,"Most of the ~25 Super Pershings built never went to Europe in WW2, and the only one that did (an early model, T26E1-1, with a T15E1 experimental gun) received the mantlet armour and glacis armour when it arrived in Europe. It saw some limited action as /u/kevinkim26 said, and was eventually left in a dump in Germany and never seen again.  The other T26E4s just had a gun upgrade (the T15E2) and would have looked much like the one in OP's picture. I'm not sure exactly what happened to those - it's possible they went to Korea with the normal Pershings, or they might have just sat around in warehouses. Apparently the T15E2 gun wasn't a great success, though.  Although the Super Pershing in WoT is called a T26E4 in game, its improved armour, stabilizer springs, and T15E1 gun mean it's actually the T26E1-1.  Edit: actually, OP's title is incorrect (possibly as a result of the inaccuracy in WoT). The tank in the photo is the T26E1-1."

TankPorn,37k9sb,NikkoJT,1 point,Tue Jun 2 11:36:43 2015 UTC,"The T26E1-1 already had a T15. That's what made it different from the regular T26E1. The difference between the T26E1-1 and the T26E4 is that the E1-1 had a T15E1 gun and the E4 had the T15E2 (aside from the E4 not having additional armour applied, since that was a field modification). Both had T15 guns, but they were different models."
TankPorn,37k9sb,Legiondude,1 point,Tue Jun 2 11:39:33 2015 UTC,"T26E1-1 was built with a 90mm M3(Ref: Hunnicutt, Pershing p105) like all the other T26E1's, the T15's addition to that specific vehicle was what got it redesignated(Ref: Hunnicutt, Pershing p28) to T26E4 Temporary Pilot #1  THEN it went through firing tests at Aberdeen, then it was shipped to 3AD, then it was modded with the extra armor and sent into action.

TankPorn,37hxi0,Mak_i_Am,2,Wed May 27 21:34:40 2015 UTC,Do any experts care to weigh in on this vs. an Armata?
TankPorn,37hxi0,CuriousBlueAbra,22,Wed May 27 20:58:57 2015 UTC,"No experts - can an interested party chip in with a couple of pennies? The obvious qualification is, comparisons aren't the best way of dealing with tanks - they're all designed differently with different objectives in mind. Don't make too much of this.   Fundamentally, the architecture of the two tanks are different. Merkava is manned turret, engine forward. Armata is unmanned turret, engine behind. Guns - both can lob ATGMs, but Merkava has a fairly average 120mm L/44, while Armata is supposed to have the best 125mm of all time. How good that actually is is unknown, but it's probably better at lobbing KEPs. Merkava has a semi-automatic loading system with a big store of easily replenishable reserve ammunition in the rear-hull, whereas Armata looks to have a high capacity carousel autoloader with some reserve ammunition in a comparably difficult-to-access configuration. Protection: As much focus on the protection along the frontal hull on both tanks, but radically different approaches. Merkava has an engine that naturally reduces the ceteris paribus protection you can place on the glacis (weight balance etc), Armata just has a big slab of armour. Former is probably good against HEAT, latter is probably an ERA-reinforced nightmare to penetrate. Respective weight - Merkava is far heavier, but Armata has far less surface area to armour (thanks to unmanned turret) so not necessarily a good way to compare. Both are NBC reinforced. Armata (as the angled turret cover and rubber skirts seem to suggest) is also optimised to reduce its signature, something it can presumably do further with Nakidka applique - this is something that's not the case with the Merkava. Mobility: Armata has a better p/w ratio and a better suspension, probably a bit nimbler (when the engine doesn't break - the Armata's 1500hp diesel, despite being in development for 30 years, is suffering from teething problems). On the other hand, Merkava isn't designed to move quickly - the IDF doesn't have many scenarios around where they'll need to blitzkrieg the Fulda Gap, whereas the Russians have at least one eye on that sort of rapid, offensive combined arms warfare. Electronics: Both tanks are very solid on this front (Israel has a great electronics sector, Russia has decades of experimentation on tank-related electronics), with the Merkava and the T-14 having in common passive thermals and a hunter-killer capability (though the crew in the Armata are so close to each other the commander might as well tap the gunner on the shoulder and just point at what he wants him to shoot) on the fire control front, a hard/soft kill active protection system (both the products of long periods of development) and 360 degree situational awareness cameras. They both have active protection systems cue at least partially by MMW radar, but while the Armata's radar is supposed to be feeding into to the FCS, I don't know if that's the case with the Merkava. Otherwise - the Merkava has an advantage in being hooked up to a functional tactical battle management network (something the Armata is equipped for and the Russians are working on, but don't quite fully have in place). One caveat - I want to know where the Armata's thermals are coming form. They'd been relying on the French until the T-90MS, and losing them as a source of parts must have had some impact. Crew and personnel: Fundamentally different in both vehicles. Merkava's roomier, and has space at the back for evacuating the crew of other tanks in a pinch - it's much more capable of staying out in the field for longer, and it's probably faster to resupply and send back out. Such is the nature of a tank born after 1973. The Armata, on the other hand - no rear-of-hull space for evacuations, and the crew space is probably a lot more cramped. It's meant for bursts of high-efficiency performance in intense, high-tempo conventional warfare. Different doctrines inform different layouts. Upgrade potential: The Armata is designed to be a fundamentally improveable tank - reflected in the rumours that the turret is capable of housing, and will eventually house, a 152mm gun. The Russian reliance on ERA for protection (on the Armata, this seems to apply primarily to the hull) also means that they can remove and replace ERA bricks as they improve it. Merkava, on the other hand - it's improveable, and its turret armour is incredibly modular, but the hull itself is limited by the front-engine layout and other systems like the gun... well, it won't be housing a 152 anytime soon. Doctrine: As stated above, the Merkava was originally a tank designed to fight long battles on the defensive, very adept at preserving crew, staying in the battle for a while and being resupplied quickly - which turned out to be quite good at, and was gradually adapted to be, a tank that was good at low-intensity combat support while maintaining its ability fight any conventional war that Israel might find itself in. The Armata, on the other hand, is designed for high-intensity combat in a cutting edge combined arms conventional battlefield. They're designed for different militaries expecting to respond differently to different contingencies.   Just a quick rundown from my perspective, may have missed a lot of things. Could the Armata beat the Merkava one-on-one? Yes, probably. But that's not the point."

TankPorn,37hxi0,anemonian,1 point,Thu May 28 13:01:03 2015 UTC,"Some points i want to add about info in your post:  1) Merkava has its own ""Nakidka""-like kit to reduce radar signature, it is simply not used for obvious reasons.  Photo: http://i.imgur.com/VR8YNqn.jpg  2) T-14's engine did not suffered techincal problems, one T-15 transmission did. How much problems new negine have is unknown, but major source of breakdowns will be crews, that are needed to be trained to work with new X-shaped diesel.    3) T-14's ERA is not totaly an ""ERA"", it is more like hybrid of passive and reactive armor, between NERA and ERA.  4) IIRC Merkava don't have 360 degrees close-range observation cameras. There is video of Merkava 4 trying to find 2 HAMAS terrorist right next to it (~10 meters away), while those 2 guys were throwing grenades at that tank. That ""fight"" was 30-40 minutes long with officer screaming at radio trying to make crew see where HAMAS militants were. T-14, according to tanks we saw, are equipped with frontal, rear, and 4 side cameras (2 per side).  5) IIRC UVZ officials noted that they use new Russian-made thermals.   6) Merkava is ""roomier"" only for loader. Other members don't have much space, because bulk looks of Merkava 3s and 4s are result of big add-on armor modules. Under those armor modules there are real tank hull and turret, and they are not so big. I don't know exact numbers for T-14, but i don't think that there is serious/critical differences in space per crewmember ratio for both vehicles. UVZ claims max comfortable time for crew to work inside of the T-14 is  72 hours.  7) Armata chassis can support weight up to 63-64 tons without modifications. Currently known stats for T-14 claims 48-53 tons (depend on used kit). Another thing is that UVZ already have tank with unmanned turret armed with powerfull 152 mm gun tested.  Overall, good post."
TankPorn,37hxi0,Retiv,1 point,Thu May 28 13:35:51 2015 UTC,"1) Interesting! Wasn't aware of that. (incidentally, what's the name of the Israeli cover?)  2) http://www.themoscowtimes.com/article/520324.html - the official account was that it was a planned stop for an ARV demonstration, there're suggestions that the driver screwed up, but whatever the case, the T-15 transmission failed visibly and there were reports already that the T-14 was having drivetrain trouble during testing. Not sure what it is, but it seems to be enough to stop the tank.  3) Interesting - how does it work? I can read the Russian, if you have a link you can direct me to.  4) http://www.defense-update.com/directory/tss-vectop.htm  5) Aha, alrighty.  6) http://i.imgur.com/WP10Cos.jpg - it really isn't that bad inside the Merkava under all the armour, certainly not by the standards of tanks like the Leclerc and Type 90. Of course the Merkava IV's turret isn't all crew space (I've already noted that in my post - ""Merkava, on the other hand - it's improveable, and its turret armour is incredibly modular""), but that doesn't mean that the turret under the modular blocks is as cramped as you might think.  http://imgur.com/a/Rq7g1 - or this.  E: Just to put things in perspective, the Type 90's turret is so cramped they literally had to design a new tank because the old tank didn't have enough room for a battle management system and a few screens. (that, and it was a bit too heavy)  72 hours? With all the electronic subsystems that they'll have to manage? That sounds a bit optimistic.  7) Yep, I wrote about this too - ""reflected in the rumours that the turret is capable of housing, and will eventually house, a 152mm gun""  Many thanks! :)"
TankPorn,37hxi0,anemonian,0,Thu May 28 17:02:00 2015 UTC,"1) Don't know that, sorry.  2) That stop was driver's error. There is another video that show how that tank drives from square on its own, after several minutes of UVZ personal pressing some buttons on driver's control panel. Apparently, driver engaged ""parking brake"" which created that funny scene with BREM trying to tow an immovable T-14.  3) No official source, only ""insider"" info.   ""In fact, the concept of the ""ERA"" is not appropriate to current protection. It is a composite of ballistic and explosive reactive armor.      Here, somewhere before, people posted an image of placard from the show. As always, the most interesting was missed  :)      ""Active"" armor is special protection material with explosive layer sprayed on the inner side of it. And this layer is very thin. The amount of explosives - small. Traditional ""throwing of the plate"" [K-5 works like that - it ""launch"" a plate using explosion energy] does not occur. BUT! a huge part of the explosion energy is transferred into internal energy (vibrations...) to ""reflective/deflective plate"" [Otrazhaushaya plastina]. Plate is destroyed and the APFSDS projectile / HEAT jet as well. By the way! The plate is quite resistant to small arms fire. Protection modules can be a single layer - for example, in the VK [as i understood - external hull/Vneshiny Korpus] of the 149 [Object 149, Armata-based Heavy IFV T-15], and it can be layered (side armor modules) which give you anti-tandem protection and destruction of the long-rod APFSDS...""  4) I only saw rear camera (for driver) in actual use.  6) Plenty of their work is automated. Don't know details, those are UVZ claims."

TankPorn,37ih5i,anemonian,6,Wed May 27 21:43:54 2015 UTC,"Frontal hull ammo storage? Really?  I've got to give it to them, I can't think of a single worse place to store ammo inside the vehicle."
TankPorn,37ih5i,LTSarc,5,Wed May 27 22:37:28 2015 UTC,"In all fairness, the Leopard 2, Type 90, Type 10, Leclerc, Ariete, K2 and a host of other tanks do this. In most cases, with varying degrees of protection - some sufficient, others not. :P  The T-series is fine on paper (sort of - unless something torches the carousel) but as they found in Chechnya, the de facto practice of storing ammunition everywhere in the hull was a bad idea."
TankPorn,37ih5i,LTSarc,1 point,Wed May 27 22:48:03 2015 UTC,"I understand the (somewhat risky) use of hull storage for more reserve ammo, but this is in the very front. The place most likely to be shot at, even if it is less likely to be penetrated."
TankPorn,37ih5i,LTSarc,3,Wed May 27 23:07:00 2015 UTC,"Well, consider it thus:   Back of the hull: taken up the engine. The turret bustle: only has so much space. The turret basket: limited room, especially because of the two or three crewmen inside it.   So unless you're an Abrams (which has a very well designed turret and a manual loader, which increases the amount of storable ammunition), or a T-series tank (with a carousel autoloader), or a Merkava (with ammunition at the back and an engine at the front), there're only so many places you can put the rest of your ammunition.  Bustle space can be limited for many reasons - it might be a question of autoloader capacity like the Leclerc or Type 90, it might just be a function of antiquated base design and poor electronics placement like the Leopard 2.  That having been said, the hull position isn't as bad as you might think, for a few reasons.   The first - it can, in fact, be adequately segregated from the crew (though this isn't the case with all hull storage). Individual round casing, a bulkhead separating it from the crew space, even a blowout panel under the tank - these are all possibilities.   The second - if you're fighting, as you ideally should, from behind partial protection or hull-down, the chances of something detonating those rounds goes down. Not that tanks will be able to fight under ideal conditions all the time, but there's a reason the British take pride in the fact that all their explosive ammunition/propellant is kept below the turret ring.  The third - following on from the above, turrets are more vulnerable than you might think. Along the frontal arc, they're the most heavily armoured part of the tank. But as a general rule, in hull-down engagements, most of the enemy's rounds will be going for your turret, and anything that hits the side or penetrates the front may well get through into the bustle. And in the modern battlefield, with top-kill, plunging trajectory ATGMs, smart EFP artillery rounds and a whole lot of other things to worry about, the turret isn't necessarily the safest place to be."
TankPorn,37ih5i,ihatehappyendings,2,Thu May 28 00:41:55 2015 UTC,"It is interesting you mention the British experience as I thought the Chally 2 Blue-On-Blue incident would actually show why this is a bad idea. Despite the use of individual cases and water jackets, internal blast wave still cooked off the hull magazine and obliterated the vehicle. And this was a wave from the turret area (HESH hit on open hatch), so moving it below turret ring didn't really help from distance either.  As to the turret deal, its simply that turret storage is closer to the loader (Either manual or mechanical) for faster loading times, and that it is possible to incorporate blow-out panels without compromising armor much. A frontal hull magazine like this would have to have a blow-out panel on the frontal hull or beneath, and weaknesses in those places are unacceptable.   From a survivability standpoint Abrams-style turret storage or Merkava's engine-front, ammo-rear layout are the best. I don't know why you would design a modern tank with such a layout, even the Challenger has the explanation of being derived from the old Chieftain layout."
TankPorn,37ih5i,Tarnsman4Life,3,Thu May 28 02:05:57 2015 UTC,"The blue-on-blue incident was an exceptional case - it has to do with the unfortunate and extraordinary occurrence at hand, where a HESH round (increasingly uncommon) struck an open hatch, thus allowing for bits of the molten explosive to spill into the turret and ignite (according to the expert's review) the stored HESH (in turn dispersing more molten explosive), then probably the charge bins. Normally, you wouldn't have bits of molten explosive spilling into the tank from an open hatch - spall-lining generally limits the amount of material that can spray through a tank following penetration, and KEPs don't tend to blow things up as vigorously as burning HESH does (not even DU alloys). That having been said, it does have implications for the Challenger in particular concerning top-kill munitions in particular that'll have to be taken into account.  You say this, but the Leopard has an escape hatch below the hull. It's not unprecedented for there to be openings below the tank. Beyond that, bulkheads between the hull storage and the crew are also an option - the revolver drum for spare ammunition on the Leclerc is rather more survivable than the dispersed bins on the Challenger.  The point is, you can't always fit enough rounds in the bustle, and in that event, alternate storage needs to be found. Because turret baskets tend to be rather close to the powerpack, the front of the tank is the only candidate for reserve storage.  Merkava layout isn't an option for everybody - frontal engine compromises KEP protection, causes a weight imbalance that requires correction, raises the tank's profile, and makes the tank more prone to mobility kills. As above - autoloaders plus large engines tend to require frontal ammunition storage. The same applies to compact turrets. Otherwise, it's generally bad design - Leopard, for example, stores electronics (and used to store the hydraulic turret mechanism) in its limited bustle, which effectively halved the available bustle space."

TankPorn,37eqo1,Vertigo666,3,Wed May 27 05:33:02 2015 UTC,"AGDS - well, it's not all that clever or fiddly. The problem is that it's essentially two weapons systems in the same turret, and one of them (ADATS) isn't all that good at what it does. With a fire and forget missile like Stinger or Mistral in place of ADATS, it'd be a pretty straightforward anti-air gun.  Fastdraw is even simpler, and the Israelis have used a rudimentary but similar system on their Merkavas for years. All it does is take the round the gunner picks and automatically cycles the magazine so the loader can just take the round and put it in the gun without searching or thinking - effective idea, but nothing revolutionary."

Take the TTB I've put on that album - 60,000 loaded rounds worth of testing and full mechanical redundancy. Just because it has moving and mechanical parts doesn't mean it's going to break every few minutes - at the point at which it has two of everything and it's proven to work reliably (under test conditions, mind), you might as well consider the TTB's carousel the A-10 of autoloaders. :P"

(Armchair analysis alert) I guess if they are happy with a tracking radar the size of a frying pan, it'll fit, but there's still not much room for the electronics. Usually those fill about 1/3rd of a trailer. Generally it appears they were trading off air defence capability against more armour."
TankPorn,37eqo1,LTSarc,2,Wed May 27 10:39:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'd be inclined to agree on that front - the tracking radar will be rather limited in capacity. But all it has to do is track single targets within gun range - ADATS would be guided by the FLIR/Laser module in the centre of the turret anyway. So it can afford to be limited.  E: Armchair analysis, though. I think the people who came up with the concept know better than me. :P  The thing about SPAAGs is that they're only as capable as their armament - so if you're looking at something like Otomatic, there's some incentive to have a capable tracking radar, but twin Bushmasters doesn't really call for the most capable system around. At the end of the day, this isn't going to take the place of a dedicated air defence network - it's just meant to take potshots at helicopters within range, possibly planes, and also armoured vehicles (because ADATS is an awkwardly dual-role missile)."

The ""shot down"" F-15 turned out to be a dropped fuel tank. The pilot dropped his pylon (Which is why you see AIM-9s attached to it) for some reason or the other. Biggest clue that the plane wasn't shot down is that well...they can't provide the rest of the plane!  A lot of alleged Saudi losses on the border are exaggerated. Houthis claimed to have shot down two Apaches over Yemen when both reports show the same Apache, which had techincal difficulties, landed on the Saudi side of the border, was patched up and returned to base.  You can see the Apache here, guarded by an M60A3 allegedly (I can't tell, picture quality is shit):  https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CEtEITHW0AAuDOB.jpg:large  Not to mention that this whole thing we're talking about is Yemen, which is not ISIS.   EDIT:  Here's the supposed downed F-15, clearly showing it's just an external fuel tank:  https://twitter.com/saikhamk/status/602434350785802240  I haven't heard anything about burned our patrol cars or captured batteries but be wary of pictures, Saudi Arabia had a short war with Yemen a few years ago where Saudi forces advanced into Yemen and some CQC happened so the pictures could have come from there or from some more recent border clashes."

TankPorn,37ct05,Yetanotherfurry,2,Wed May 27 00:18:50 2015 UTC,"Export versions of tanks are generally.... Terrible.  The m1 export version is essentially a second gen MBT not a third as an non export would be.  It lacks modern composite armor, modern fire control, modern communications, modern optics. Export version tanks are generally crap, but are normally sold in areas of the world where they would be up against similarly classed armor."

TankPorn,37b33e,Pillowsmeller18,11,Tue May 26 13:37:30 2015 UTC,I don't think the Western Allies would have dropped nukes anywhere in Europe. Not in 44-45 at least. The Soviets would've 100 times over if they had gotten them before the war was over.
TankPorn,37b33e,Perry87,3,Tue May 26 14:40:11 2015 UTC,"General Groves himself didn't want to drop the bomb in Europe. Roosevelt, on the other hand, would ask Groves if it was possible due to being shaken up after the Battle of the Bulge."
TankPorn,37b33e,TouniXVIII,2,Tue May 26 19:18:19 2015 UTC,"I think after Yalta there was no way an atomic bomb would've been dropped on Europe. Any bombing on a future Soviet controlled sector of Germany may have been seen as intimidation or a deliberate threat to the Soviets. Not to mention the economical and environmental damage it would've done to the land. If the western allies would have dropped one on ""their"" area of Germany/Berlin, it would have cost the Allies dearly politically keeping in mind their intended post war rebuilding efforts."

TankPorn,37b33e,ExplosiveMachine,6,Tue May 26 10:28:31 2015 UTC,I like how it chucks it out far enough that someone has to throw pick it up afterwards
TankPorn,37b33e,Swww,6,Tue May 26 11:07:44 2015 UTC,"While the Pershing is indeed one the best Allied tanks produced during the twilight of the war, it had major problems that caused it to be replaced quickly with the M46/47 Patton. It's torsion bar suspension system was horribly overstressed and tended to break down. The Ford GAF engine was practically the same engine powering the Sherman except now in a tank 11.5 more tons than it's original host. Still, it was mostly suited to the flat terrain of Europe and not the hilly terrain of Korea."
TankPorn,37b33e,TouniXVIII,9,Tue May 26 19:28:30 2015 UTC,It was the only tank the Allies had that could go toe to toe with a Tiger I or II other than the JS/IS tanks the Soviets introduced in late 1944. It was the only tank in the US inventory that could do that.   Interesting read about the Super Pershing... http://www.3ad.com/history/news/super.pershing.1.htm
TankPorn,37b33e,silverfox762,2,Tue May 26 14:39:20 2015 UTC,"toe to toe with a Tiger I   Wouldn't say that. Anything armed with the 17 pounder could, and so could anything armed with the M1 76mm gun could too."
TankPorn,37b33e,TheHIV123,3,Wed May 27 01:37:22 2015 UTC,"Something armed with a 17 pounder but inadequate frontal and turret armor isn't going ""toe to toe"". It can certainly kill a Tiger, but slugging it out is another matter."
TankPorn,37b33e,silverfox762,7,Wed May 27 03:17:55 2015 UTC,"Tanks don't slug it out shot for shot less things have gone wrong. Those who see the enemy first usually win regardless of armor. That's why American TD battalions were so effective at killing tanks. They had crap armor but they were trained in tactics designed to maximize their strengths and so they did well. Some of the battalions had kill/loss ratios of as much as 10:1.   Just look at Wittmans final attack, those Shermans cut his Tigers to pieces.  If that's not going toe to toe then I don't know what is."
TankPorn,37b33e,TheHIV123,-6,Wed May 27 12:38:53 2015 UTC,You must be miserable to be married to.
TankPorn,37b33e,silverfox762,9,Wed May 27 12:55:41 2015 UTC,Just because you don't know what you are talking about doesn't mean you need to lash out at me.
TankPorn,37b33e,TheHIV123,-3,Wed May 27 13:08:13 2015 UTC,"If you think that's lashing out, you're in for an eye opening experience on the internet. I made an honest observation.   ""Tanks don't slug it out"" is pedantic bullshit. It's a figure of speech and maybe I should have gone into paragraphs talking about survivability of first shot encounters, but if you'd actually given a shit about my original question ""Source?"", instead of being pedantic about shit, you might have gotten a different answer."
TankPorn,37b33e,silverfox762,2,Wed May 27 13:28:49 2015 UTC,"Again with the lashing out. You really need thicker skin. I pointed out that you have a skewed sense of what tank combat is like, and you don't like that. Insulting me like that is pathetic. If you think I am being pedantic you could have said so.  Also you didn't ask me for a source.   Again, going toe to toe with other tanks does not mean trading shot for shot. That is why American TDs were so effective and why US studies found that the Sherman was a more effective tank than the Panther. Simple statistics like armor thickness and gun caliber just don't tell the whole story."
TankPorn,37b33e,TheHIV123,-1,Wed May 27 13:36:49 2015 UTC,"Again, that's not lashing out in any way shape or form.  So you took from one sentence my entire knowledge of armored warfare from the mid-20th century? Choosing to be concise and using a figure of speech, rather than being pedantic and going on for pages about first shot survivability is ""having a skewed sense of what tank combat is like""? Tank combat IS usually immediately fatal to anyone not housed in many layers of composite/reactive armor. IF you wanna be pedantic about shit, we're talking about ""WAS"", 70 years ago. You repeatedly talk about ""is"", and draw all kinds of conclusions from a single figure of speech. Yeah, that's being pedantic and a pain in the ass and living with that kind of pedantic shit would be a nightmare. ""Honey, did you put down the toilet seat?"" ""No, I put down the LID. Get it right. Your understanding of bathroom nomenclature is sorely lacking"". Get my drift?  And I did say you were being pedantic, and I've done it again.  By the way, the studies that show the Sherman as more ""effective"" than the Panther, if I remember correctly, weighted reliability and ease of maintenance as a huge factor in that conclusion. Those same studies also showed that the ""effectiveness"" wasn't in relation to specific crews inside the tanks when facing German armor and AT guns. As one retired German tanker said to me in the late 90s ""you could kill 100 Shermans and there'd be 100 more right behind them"". But then again, I don't know shit about armored warfare 70 years ago except from first-person conversations and reading the same things most people interested do, from Franz Kurowski to Liddell-Hart, and so on.  So get over your pedantic self and if you want to have a conversation, start by not making presumptions about what I know from a single figure of speech."
TankPorn,37b33e,silverfox762,2,Wed May 27 13:54:35 2015 UTC,"No you didn't say I was being pedantic until after you insulted me. You seem to be incapable of having this discussion without getting angry. You said that no Allied tank except the M26 could go ""toe to toe"" with the Tiger. That is simply wrong and the combat record shows that. Lots of stuff could kill the Tiger and the M26 wasn't even the only Allied tank with comparable armor.    No those studies did not take into account reliability. They solely looked at performance on attack and defense. Zaloga talks about it in this book. And here is a summary of the study from a different book.   The study simply took into account the actual results of combat. I don't know specifically which you are referring to.   Further as the war went on Allied crews became much better than their German counterparts. The German training system was crumbling by the end of 44 and combining that with fuel and spares shortages meant that tank crews got less and less training. That is part of why so many of the larger tanks like the Panther and Tiger suffered so many break downs towards the end of the war even after much of their teething problems had been worked out. And I am not sure how your quote from a German tanker is really relevant to that particular point.   Also you might want to try reading a little bit more modern scholarship than Hart and Kurowski, their books are interesting but dated. Kurowski in particular is a very poor source as he gets a lot wrong, and tends to portray the Wehrmacht as the best fighting force ever and it's men all heroes, though given his role during the war that shouldnt be too surprising.  He is sort of like an American Stephen Ambrose, which to be clear is not a good thing, though from what I remember Ambrose tended to do a better job sourcing his works. I believe that his German wiki entry even calls him a ""revisionist"". Hart on the other hand was a shameless self promoter and tends to take credit for things he had very little to do with. And honestly if that is a good indicator of your source of knowledge on the subject then I can see why we are having this conversation. If you would like I can give you some book recommendations."
TankPorn,37b33e,TheHIV123,-1,Wed May 27 14:25:09 2015 UTC,"Or are you taking my use of ""four letter punctuation"" as ""lashing out""? Sorry, but it's effective communication sometimes. Not anger. I was a Marine enlisted man, not a ring knocker."
TankPorn,37b33e,silverfox762,2,Wed May 27 13:58:49 2015 UTC,I don't care about swearing but it's not effective if you simply choose to insult me instead of actually making it clear as to why you have a problem with what I am saying. Regardless of your word choice you decided insult me instead of actually engaging in a discussion. We can still have that discussion but if you continue to insult me then I wont be participating any further.   Also I apologize for responding in kind.
TankPorn,37b33e,TheHIV123,5,Wed May 27 14:30:12 2015 UTC,"You're an asshole.  Just because you were mistaken on how armored warfare worked, you say ""you must be miserable to be married to."". What's the point in you doing that?  Try debate instead of insults next time."
TankPorn,37b33e,PerryGriggs,-4,Wed May 27 17:08:58 2015 UTC,"Gee, I'm so intimidated. And I'm not mistaken on anything. I used a figure of speech that set off a fire-storm of pedantic bullshit."
TankPorn,37b33e,silverfox762,2,Wed May 27 17:24:48 2015 UTC,"Gee, I'm so intimidated.   Wasn't trying to intimidate you.   And I'm not mistaken on anything. I used a figure of speech that set off a fire-storm of pedantic bullshit.   The problem being in armored warfare ""slugging it out"" has an actual meaning, so it isn't really pedantic, seeing as it isn't a small detail in any way."
TankPorn,37b33e,PerryGriggs,-1,Wed May 27 17:56:48 2015 UTC,"Then a simple explanation that I was misusing a term might have been far more productive.   But just for shits and giggles, to my original point, given the choice of the M26 or an M4 in any variant, which would YOU rather face a PzVI in? That was my original point, and anyone NOT being pedantic would have been able to discern that."
TankPorn,37b33e,silverfox762,2,Wed May 27 18:16:28 2015 UTC,"If you simply wish to pit two tanks together in a vacuum then of course it's best to take a heavy tank. But if you want to actually win a war you ought to pick the Sherman every time.   And that is why I think you have a skewed perception of tank warfare. The situation you are presenting is not one that existed in reality. Tanks operate in the context of the armies in which they fight, with all the supporting arms that go with that.   That's why despite the local danger that a Tiger presented it was never such a concern that it convinced US planners to think that what they had was inadequate. That is why we went into Normandy with tanks armed with 75mm guns. That weapon had been perfectly adequate up until then, and even the few Tigers encountered had been dealt with.   It was the Panther that actually motivated the Allies to upgun all their equipment because unlike the Tiger it was actually present in numbers that mattered and in many ways was the more dangerous tank.   And that is why your question doesn't matter, the Sherman was good enough to do the job that was asked of it and fit well into the Allies' force structure. Just because it couldn't sweep the floor with the occasional heavy tank doesn't really mean anything because it could and did manage to deal with them anyway. And especially once they were upgraded with more powerful weapons the Tiger I could be killed at normal combat ranged by nearly every tank on the battlefield."
TankPorn,37b33e,TheHIV123,0,Wed May 27 18:31:56 2015 UTC,"it also would've been for more productive to counter with your own arguments, instead of insulting him."
TankPorn,37b33e,PerryGriggs,1 point,Wed May 27 18:29:46 2015 UTC,That encounter never happened and has been largely debunked since the Super Pershing and the Tiger II were never near enough to fight one another.

TankPorn,37b33e,silverfox762,1 point,Wed May 27 04:11:34 2015 UTC,"Absence of proof is not proof of absence. A book making no mention of something doesn't mean it didn't happen. There are stories of US troops returning to Holland and Belgium 50 years later to find that locals tell stories of their deeds (one guy even found a beer with a picture of him carrying beer in a helmet on the label, 60 years after he carried beer in his helmet to the wounded in the local church). The common factor is that knew no one had ever asked them about these deeds, outside of family, and many incidents get recorded briefly or barely and are lost to time. Can you source a credible report that this didn't happen?"

Irwin's memoir Another River, Another Town describes his many encounters with enemy armor and armored infantry in late-war Germany pretty well, albeit a bit too briefly sometimes, so this is a great additional read for me. Interesting to note that Irwin and his crew members were originally in a 76mm M4A3 Sherman; it was knocked out by a Panzerfaust during a skirmish in Espchenrode and they received their replacement tank, the T-26 Super Pershing, shortly after. Another interesting note, the site claims Pete's (he was the loader) last name is not yet known, but according to the memoir, it's Kowanski, and Irwin's tank commander's last name was, according to the memoir, Matira, not Maduri.  One of Irwin's most interesting enemy armor encounters along with the Pershing vs Tiger II was his Sherman's fight with a Jagdtiger. (Blew out the Jagdtiger's front drive sprocket with an HE round after running out of AP rounds.)"

Might actually be the demonstrator Gepard 1A2 + Stinger turret KMW came up with but the Bundeswehr never bought.  Modularity on a budget, I guess. ;)  E: A key difference between the Gepard and other Western-pattern SPAAG turrets like the Marksman is the placement of the targeting radar at the front of the turret, as opposed to on a mast on top with the search radar. Allegedly, the Germans had patented that particular radar placement, thus preventing competitors from doing the same nifty thing - something the Japanese apparently found out to their disappointment when they were designing the Type 87!"
TankPorn,3795lt,SmokeyUnicycle,3,Tue May 26 01:07:29 2015 UTC,"The Marksman system is designed to be mounted on any chassis with minimal difficulty, so seeing it on random MBTs is common, much more so than the Gepard.   I'd very much like a source for that patent claim as well."
TankPorn,3795lt,SmokeyUnicycle,6,Tue May 26 01:11:41 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, that's what it was designed for - but that doesn't change the fact that this is a Gepard turret. Marksman as an option would have been new-build - not really necessary if the Germans were opening up their stocks of Gepard turrets. :P  Well, if you've access to Japanese magazines and translations, I recall seeing it in a back-issue of PANZER (July 2008, maybe?) - though that in itself (the magazine has a bit of a reputation) calls the reliability of the claim into question, hence the 'allegedly' above. Otherwise, it's a claim that appears to have propagated across the internet, without any scans of the magazine article in question to accompany it (alas) - including this fairly comprehensive guide to the Type 87. http://combat1.sakura.ne.jp/87SHIKI-T.htm  E: Oh, and their 2012-13 guide to GSDF equipment has a section on the 87's development that explicitly describes the 87's early developmental stages as an effort to marry a turret inspired by the Gepard to a surplus Type 61 chassis, a plan that fell through when it turned out that the 61's hull didn't have the space to accommodate a SPAAG turret of that kind.  Before anybody brings up the Tunguska - I doubt KMW had the power to file patents in the USSR at the height of the Cold War. :P But there's definitely past precedent for Gepard-related technologies to have patents filed in the US, Canada and Japan as well as Europe - http://www.zeit.de/1994/41/sparziel-verfehlt - so while I can't provide you with the specific government documents that show that this dispute actually occurred, there's no reason why it couldn't have.  E: But then, I didn't make the comment in an attempt to radically change the historiography of the German defence industry or anything - just a moment of levity courtesy of a somewhat amusing anecdote.  E2: That said - the Type 87 and Marksman turret were both designed in the 80s, in the West, and share the same turret layout. It takes until 1994 for another SPAAG with a similar armament - Loara - to emerge in the West. That more or less overlaps with the period where the Bundeswehr stops investing in the Gepard for the most part, KMW stops upgrading it and it begins to slide towards obsolescence/retirement. So the radar layout clearly works, but for some reason two turrets designed in the 80s don't have it during the Gepard's prime. It's definitely a possibility that the Gepard itself was the reason why they opted to use a different arrangement."
TankPorn,3795lt,hopsafoobar,1 point,Tue May 26 01:39:10 2015 UTC,"but that doesn't change the fact that this is a Gepard turret.   No... why would it?   It is said that 87AW adopted the antenna arrangement different from that of Geparuto in relation to the patent.   Huh, interesting.   I'm kind of skeptical that a design that would seriously impact performance would be limited by international patents which are usually weaker, but maybe."
TankPorn,3795lt,ASACschrader,1 point,Tue May 26 07:59:55 2015 UTC,"Not sure - the Marksman keeps being brought up, and I have no idea why. There're plenty of other SPAAGs that look like the Gepard. :P  Sure, but this wouldn't seriously impact performance - after all, the Type 87's evidence that they found a solution. If there's a ready solution, I expect they'd just choose to forgo the trouble, whatever the marginal increase in performance. It's a similar case with the 120mm the Japanese licensed from Rheinmetall with a 'no technological spin-offs' caveat attached to it - though the Japanese already had a domestic 120mm program in the running before they chose to license Rheinmetall's gun, and though they continued developing that (no doubt with input from the licensed gun) throughout the 90s, they decided nonetheless to proceed until 2009 with Rheinmetall's licensed gun, opting not to retrofit the Type 90 with a domestic gun and waiting until the Type 10 way down the line to do that. There're probably budgetary concerns involved in that decision too, but I'm sure they recognised that coming up with a new 120mm gun and cutting the flow of licensing fees to Rheinmetall in the mid-90s would have caused obvious problems - again, whatever the marginal capability improvements."
TankPorn,3795lt,MisterMeatloaf,1 point,Tue May 26 08:46:24 2015 UTC,"I have no idea why   Because the Marksman turret gets slapped on everything  by design, is why.   It just seems strange to me to even be able to patent that, there's like 3 places to put a radar dish on a vehicle haha."
TankPorn,3795lt,SmokeyUnicycle,1 point,Tue May 26 16:17:41 2015 UTC,"Well, by concept. It didn't sell well enough to be built in quantity, let alone to be slapped on everything. :P  Naah. I mean, with the traditional search/tracking duo, you can have them arranged like the Gepard, on a single rear-turret mast like the Type 87 and co, or one in front of the other on separate mountings like the Otomatic, or side by side like the M247.   You can also have single radar (search or track) mountings, on an exposed, raised mounting like the Shilka, or in a ballistic housing like the LvKv 90. It's an arrangement that may well become increasingly common if SPAAGs are still popular when AESA begins to proliferate a bit more.  The possibilities are endless. ;)"
TankPorn,3795lt,Hydrogeolo,2,Wed May 27 01:15:00 2015 UTC,"Even between Gepard and Marksman, there is a lot of commonality, namely the exact same 35mm KD-series guns."
TankPorn,3795lt,Tarnsman4Life,1 point,Tue May 26 12:36:13 2015 UTC,Type 87 and Loara ended up using the KDE as well. Probably because the Gepard used it first. :P

TankPorn,3795lt,SmokeyUnicycle,2,Tue May 26 04:31:41 2015 UTC,Is it just me or did NATO strategy in a potential conflict with the USSR rely almost totally on air superiority?
TankPorn,3795lt,walruskingmike,9,Tue May 26 02:52:49 2015 UTC,"Absolutely not. It also depended heavily on strategic well defended battle positions for armor to stonewall any USSR advance. It's why NATO tanks can depress their gun lower than Soviet tanks, and why NATO tanks are heavier and require more logistical support - they could afford it. NATO tanks weren't supposed to be advancing hundreds of kilometers at a time.  Air superiority is a huge strategy, but it must be coupled with resilient ground combat forces.  Source: endless LPDs on cold war tactics."
TankPorn,3795lt,regsvanlinks,3,Tue May 26 03:07:03 2015 UTC,"Very cool info TY; I was just curious then why the US and much of NATO never seemed to heavily invest in anti aircraft guns and missiles or at least as heavily as the USSR. The USSR had a wide variety of very capable systems. Short range systems like the Strela, OSA, ""Gopher"". Medium range systems like the KUB and TOR family. Various long range systems. The US never seemed as fully vested, especially in the short range systems. The HAWK was a very capable system but didn't have the mobility of the KUB. In the short range the US never seemed to develop a real answer beyond the ""stop gap"" systems of the MIM-72 and the VADS."

Plus the firepower from that 88mm.  2) M4 Jumbo 76 - The iconic profile of a Sherman, the armor of a Jumbo, and the firepower to challenge most German tanks? Hell yes.  3) Sherman Firefly - As you probably guessed, big Sherman fan, and the British variant is no exception.   4) Stug. III & Stug. IV - Its so cute, yet so deadly and intimidating at the same time. I prefer the long barrel version better.  5) Pzkfw IV ausf. H - Personally, I think the Pz. IV is ugly.

TankPorn,3787rw,Darkmango42,2,Fri May 29 10:35:17 2015 UTC,"The biggest setoffs to the E8 are the design and armor. The 76 mm is pretty neat; that's why I like the Firefly and Jumbo 76, and partially the E8. But I also like the thick armor of the Jumbo as well. Both the E8 and Firefly are pretty soft targets, like their original counterparts. The reason I chose the Firefly over the E8 is purely cosmetic. 1) the strange skirts to the side may have function, but they look ugly to me. 2) I like the look of the original Sherman more, so the Firefly, being a simple up-gunned Sherman, looked more appealing."

TankPorn,3787rw,LeuCeaMia,0,Wed May 27 00:02:45 2015 UTC,"It had a seven man crew.   Did the Sherman use the same crappy 75mm for a while?   You mean the 75 mm M2? The velocity was low because they meant for it to be used as artillery support. Experiments were even undertaken to shorten it further to 71.5"" but the muzzle blast was too much.   Still, the 75 mm M2's penetration was a bit better than the 37 mm M6 against the Stug III's armour although when compared to some actual dual purpose / later dedicated AT guns it begins to fall behind.  The 75 mm M3 was developed for the M4 prototype, the T6 but the prototype and the first two M4A1 mediums mounted the 75 mm M2 due to the unavailability of the 75 mm M3."

So it might be that he took all these photos (maybe on behalf of GIAT) and the PAC 90 is one that he uploaded himself, or it might just be that he's taken a photo of a photo or something like that. Not 100% sure. :P"

TankPorn,3780xu,ExplosiveMachine,1 point,Mon May 25 21:38:26 2015 UTC,"Yes that is correct, the carousels meant that only a single crewman had to man the turret loading, that was just what I wanted to point out :) The autoloader got more and more common though, thus the growing tendency of smaller akwardly (ergonomically) shaped turrets"
TankPorn,3780xu,ShadeO89,1 point,Mon May 25 21:48:43 2015 UTC,"True. I'm hoping you mean that the carousels meant that only one crew member was manning the loading, because there's still a gunner and a commander :)  Only the russians adopted the autoloader though, it's very interesting. They overall have (had, I guess, the Armata is giant) the smallest tanks, too. I guess the benefit of a loader is more manpower, and increased storage safety, as the ammo can't burn the inside of an abrams from the bustle, but hit a T-72 below the turret and the whole thing goes off."
TankPorn,3780xu,ExplosiveMachine,1 point,Mon May 25 21:55:59 2015 UTC,"Fixed...  Yeah the funny thing about the Armata is that, to my knowledge, it has an unmanned turret, which seems counter intuitive when looking at the soviet trend of having small turrets.  So when they make an unmanned turret, they suddenly diverge from this trend.... Strange"

Something like this (hastily translated):  Engine => A power-up courtesy of a 200-250PS water-cooled engine.  Transmission => A driveability improvement via the introduction of a sixteen-speed transmission (12 forward, 4 reverse), coupled with a torque converter and a multiple stage reduction final drive.  Tracks => The use of reinforced rubber tracks to make the system more quiet and efficient overall (by around 10-15%).  Armament => The use of a revolver-type autoloader to increase the RoF (6x2 ready rounds).  FCS => The addition of an OICW-pattern fire control system (adjusted for the RR's rounds, of course) to allow the vehicle to operate in all weather and day/night conditions.  Warhead => The use of a HEAT-MP warhead with an added thermobaric effect.  Chassis => The use of a deployable shield offering protection up to .50 cal.  Other => Field rations storage, and an air conditioning unit (500W)  Additional => If there's enough money, the use of a high-precision guided munition for the RR. Why not stick on a pair of 70x7R rocket pods for suppressive fire while we're at it?"

TankPorn,375d1x,anemonian,9,Mon May 25 00:47:41 2015 UTC,"As a sort of addendum to this post:  http://i.imgur.com/LIMiuKD.png  The image above is a representation of what the Japanese MoD expected from the Type 10 long before it became the Type 10 - between 1996-2000, when the TRDI were researching what they then called the Future Combat Vehicle. Back then, there wasn't any of this political speak about it being a 'guerilla fighting tank' - it was, pure and simple, a lightweight, networked tank designed to respond to the challenges of what the US had used the platform of its stunning Gulf War victory to enunciate as a Revolution in Military Affairs.  As you can see, the design was quite different to that of the Type 10 as it eventually ended up - but comparing it with the diagram of the Type 10 without its modular add-ons, there're aspects of it that haven't - the vaguely asymmetric turret, for example.  That having been said, it differed from the Type 10 in one key respect - its housing (you can tell by the periscopes) of two personnel in the hull. This is what's commonly referred to as a 'semi-overhead turret', where the design almost, but not quite, manages to separate the turret and its ammunition from the hull and its crew. This means the turret has a lower frontal profile (and hence a lower frontal profile to armour, which means comparatively lower weight), and that less of the crew is exposed to danger when the tank is hit along its turret (fewer crew stations in the line of fire). On the other hand, I can't help but recall a point made by TouniXVIII the other day concerning the Armata, and the problems in practice of having a turret and autoloader isolated from the crew:  http://www.reddit.com/r/TankPorn/comments/36k7zz/looks_unreal_the_t14_armata_at_the_moscow_victory/crfj58t  The Type 90's autoloader, and presumably the Type 10's derived from it, had a hand-cranked mode which could be used in the event of autoloader failure. Presumably, in the model presented here, at least part of the advantages accrued in an overhead turret like the Armata's could be coupled with the redundancy of manual access to  subsystems like the autoloader or vision blocks in the event that electronics or mechanisms stop working mid-combat. Perhaps not the ideal solution, but a potential and interesting one nonetheless - if not all that pretty to look at. Under the modules, at least."

TankPorn,3724jr,Flabergie,1 point,Sun May 24 14:34:15 2015 UTC,It would actually be easier than that. Tracked vehicles will tend to want to drive in perfectly straight lines.
TankPorn,3724jr,oneupmanshipwreck,1 point,Sun May 31 16:48:42 2015 UTC,Not overly. The lane would generally be cleared in a straight line. because of how they are controlled and the tracks they use armoured vehicles are -very- easy to drive in straight lines.
TankPorn,3724jr,oneupmanshipwreck,1 point,Sun May 31 16:46:59 2015 UTC,And that tank would breach a lane through the minefield that would allow other vehicles to follow. In a pinch dismounted infantry could walk very carefully on the tracks as well.
TankPorn,3724jr,oneupmanshipwreck,2,Sun May 31 16:53:23 2015 UTC,"I agree that Infantry could walk in the tracks.  But for lane clearing, devices like the flail or the American Aunt Jemima rollers are needed to clear a usable path. With this device only vehicles with the exact same wheel spacing would be able to follow.  This would eliminate virtually all trucks,carriers,jeeps etc from following the tracks."
TankPorn,3724jr,Flabergie,1 point,Sun May 31 17:19:18 2015 UTC,"But for lane clearing, devices like the flail or the American Aunt Jemima rollers are needed to clear a usable path.    The flail was mainly useful against antipersonnel mines. It didn't always exert enough ground pressure to deal with anti-tank mines making rollers and plows necessary.   They still use essentially the same systems while the large and cumbersome American rollers have fallen by the wayside.  http://media.defenceindustrydaily.com/images/LAND_Leopard_C2_Mine_Plough_Afghanistan_lg.jpg  http://anzacsteel.hobbyvista.com/Armoured%20Vehicles/Images/mcrs07.jpg  The CIRD pictured in the post, of Canadian design was more effective than many of the options such as the flail as it could be used in a reconnaissance role. the flail tanks when operating were limited to a maximum speed of 1.5 mph. The CIRD and the flails were each designed to work in support of each other.  The CIRD tank would pull an explosive filled hose across the minefield in its wake. when it got the the end of the hose, about 500 metres, the charge was detonated. This would clear any mines in the lane that were not cleared by the rollers themselves. This would create a lane about 11 feet wide. Other variations on the mine rollers were combination mine roller and plow mounts.  The Americans sent the CIRD across the channel on D-day but appear not to have used them on their Shermans until late in the war. The Aunt Jemima roller was large, slow and cumbersome, but it was deemed to be ""good enough"" and there was little effort to replace it as the war was drawing to a close."
TankPorn,3724jr,oneupmanshipwreck,3,Mon Jun 1 02:08:04 2015 UTC,"The weight is part of the design, the wheels need enough force to detonate mines that are calibrated to only explode when a tank rolls over them."

Those springs provide the force that exerts the ground pressure on the mine rollers. The rigid frame to the tank hull allows the weight of the vehicle to be transferred to the rollers through the springs. There was a version that used weight as opposed to springs to exert ground pressure on the rollers:  http://ww2history.ru/uploads/2008/1296541656_4-416.jpg  http://ww2history.ru/uploads/2008/1296541573_3-416.jpg"

There were a couple of different versions that could be used for clearing mines. It really depended on what kind of mines you were clearing, anti-personnel or anti-tank, and what would be going through the lane you cleared. Clearing a lane with 2 tracks like that would allow other tanks and wheeled vehicles to move through the breach in the minefield.  Churchill flail tank, it was made in regular Churchill with the Crab flail, Churchill GC and in Churchill AVRE versions, believe it was called the toad. These were mainly designed for anti-personnel mines and were for clearing lanes for infantry.  http://churchilltank.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Churchill-Mark-VII-converted-to-a-Toad-Flail-for-mine-clearing.jpg  http://www.lordadmiral.com/WWII/0032-FlailTank.JPG  http://www.milweb.net/features/toad/9.jpg  http://www.accurate-armour.com/images/MH_TOAD_a.jpg  The Churchill plow in various versions could be used to clear mines. These were mainly used for anti-tank mines. It would clear a lane that other vehicles could follow in. Generally the anti-tank mines would be exposed or dug up by the plow, they would later be dealt with by follow on engineers.  http://www.dday-overlord.com/img/chars/char_bullshorn_plough.jpg  http://www.combatreform.org/AVREwithmineplows.jpg  http://www.combatreform.org/AVREmineplowwithsledsideart.jpg  There were other similar versions with rollers for clearing mines, this is a variation on the one pictured. You can see that they use weight as opposed to the large springs to exert ground pressure on the rollers. I am presuming that this would be superior to the one with the weights as it would be less likely to be damaged by a detonation.  http://ww2history.ru/uploads/2008/1296541656_4-416.jpg  http://ww2history.ru/uploads/2008/1296541573_3-416.jpg  They also had various bulldozer attachments which could work for both in a pinch.  http://www.accurate-armour.com/Graphics/C099e.jpg"

TankPorn,36ydmg,anemonian,4,Sat May 23 03:57:11 2015 UTC,"And if you were thinking that, at one 40mm CTA autocannon and a 7.62 RWS, it looks a little undergunned, the proposed turret would have been able to accommodate ATGM boxes on either side of the turret.  It was 'inspired by the BMPT' - a combination of heavy tank armour and an armament based around autocannon(s) and missiles. In terms of role, on the other hand, its big combined optronics/radar mast at the back of the turret would've meant that it would've been able to one-up the BMPT, acting not only as fire support but a recce-in-force vehicle in both open and urban environments."
TankPorn,36ydmg,Lion_Of_Night,3,Sat May 23 04:03:16 2015 UTC,"Still though, the original chassis has an awful lot of steel to lug around. Wouldn't this be the worst of both worlds?"
TankPorn,36ydmg,SouareInTheMorning,1 point,Sat May 23 15:43:16 2015 UTC,"The French evidently agree - the vehicle that eventually won the EBRC tender was a 17t 6x6. And it's fair enough, given that the 6x6 carried the exact armament the T40 proposal would have carried (40mm CTA and missiles) at what I presume is a bit less than half its weight. :P  That having been said, there're two reasons the T40 should be given a second look:  i) Protection weighs a fair bit, but protection is still valuable. That is to say, the T40 wouldn't necessarily have been a bad idea in isolation given that it attempted to replicate a combination of attributes that many nations have considered to be of potential use for a while - heavy armour and infantry/light vehicle optimised weaponry are what you see, after all, on the BMPT, on the Namer in its 30mm RWS-equipped iteration, and others. Having a lot of armour and a lighter armament could have been of use for a French military that finds itself engaging increasingly in the sort of LIC and MOUT operations the Russians and Israelis developed similar vehicles in light of.  ii) Cost is another, very important, world in this equation. The T40 proposal didn't require new buy vehicles - it would essentially have made T40 turrets available to armoured formations, to be retrofitted onto Leclerc hulls (and vice-versa) according to operational requirements. The potential cost-savings would've warranted a second look, at the very least.  At the end of the day, though, you're sort of right - the weight was definitely a big no-no. EBRC was meant to replace vehicles like the AMX-10 RC or ERC-90, both examples of vehicles that've given the French the ability to deploy armoured support without the logistical tail of a Leclerc formation in its many operations overseas. It lends them a flexibility in overseas deployments that French planners can't have overseen - given that they've already developed tactical procedures for the use of lightly armoured direct support vehicles, trying to replace them with a main battle tank conversion would've essentially equated to solving a problem that'd already been solved in the preceding decade of war. They opted to retain the deployability advantage - a wise decision, in your opinion (it seems) and mine too. ;P  Two other things that contributed to the demise of this proposal, in my opinion (not that I think it was ever really considered properly, for all the reasons here and potentially more):   There's no cost advantage if the entire Leclerc fleet is already being used. The tank force has been downsized and the remaining vehicles are either just enough to maintain the current armoured force configuration, or being kept in warehouses and being harvested for spare parts. There's no leeway in the current Leclerc fleet to give up four or five tanks up for an armed recce role that other vehicles had previously satisfied. And for a lower price, too - the Leclerc tank, by all accounts, is a hellishly maintenance-heavy vehicle. Active protection is the technology of the near-future, and the EBRC program is part of a wider program that, ostensibly, is trying to re-equip the French Army for that near future too. I suppose the French calculation is that within an acceptable number of years they'll have a workable APS they can fit to the EBRC Sphinx, at which point - poof - its vulnerability to anything that isn't a tank goes down radically. And who knows? Maybe the British will be able to make their much-vaunted electrical armour do something that slat protection doesn't already do by then too. :P"

Working the clutch might also be a difficult.   Though perhaps the most difficult part might have been actually manipulating the brake levers. Those are uncomfortable far away from the driver's seat unless you have the seat lowered to you can button up."

TankPorn,36livx,Jammybeez,3,Wed May 20 13:44:41 2015 UTC,It's a french TOG II*...
TankPorn,36livx,Fred42096,2,Wed May 20 15:27:31 2015 UTC,Pardon?
TankPorn,36livx,Brynjolf-of-Riften,3,Wed May 20 16:32:12 2015 UTC,He's basically saying it's the French version of the (in)famous British TOG II*. They're both extremely long and impractical for their time considering when they were built. Here's a picture
TankPorn,36livx,Brynjolf-of-Riften,2,Wed May 20 22:22:37 2015 UTC,"Damn, did they ever use it in combat?"
TankPorn,36livx,uggmun,3,Wed May 20 23:12:22 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, no. The TOG II* used the same 17 pounder gun they slapped in the Archer, the Achilles, and most famously, the Sherman Firefly. It was just too impractical, and it's huge size, coupled with its sheet metal armor and insanely high silhouette, it was extremely underclassed."
TankPorn,36livx,Brynjolf-of-Riften,2,Wed May 20 23:19:22 2015 UTC,"I find it funny how TOG stands for ""The Old Gang."" The TOG II was a World War too late to be of any use."
TankPorn,36livx,LeuCeaMia,3,Thu May 21 02:12:32 2015 UTC,"Well it was designed with trench warfare in mind, if WWII had ever come to that, then it quite possibly could have seen service. The TOG II* is just impractical for the way WWII was fought out no matter how you look at it. It had the same armor as the Russian KV-1, KV-1s, and KV-2 tanks but underwent trials long after the guns designed to destroy armor that thick were used and designed. Maybe if it had been finished in the late 30s, or went into production in maybe 1940 it could have been more useful, but considering it underwent trials after the Panther and the Tiger were conceived it might have, just maybe have stood a ghost of a chance. And that's only one problem with the TOG'S design. It was extremely heavy,extremely slow, ungodly long, and also extremely tall. It would have been spotted a mile away from any threat whatsoever, and the Luftwaffe would have had the time of their lives destroying it. It had essentially the same armor as the more famous infantry tank, the Matilda II, but it was bigger than two Matildas stacked on top of each other."

TankPorn,36k7zz,Pyronaut44,6,Wed May 20 06:23:50 2015 UTC,That's because most of the sides and top of the turret are actually a thin sheet metal cladding. There's a diagram of it without the cladding somewhere but basically the actual armoured part of the turret is considerably smaller than it outwardly appears.

TankPorn,36k7zz,anemonian,1 point,Wed May 20 14:45:43 2015 UTC,"To be fair, I'd be willing to bet the turret isn't quite finished yet. Even if they are going to have a 'shell' around a inner smaller turret core, the shell is really.... lazily done.   Futhermore, the vehicle appears to be a straight derivative of the old Ob'yekt 187 design (Which was not coincidentally also designed to be a family of vehicles, and shares many parts with this vehicle) that UVZ has kept mostly classified since the 80s. Which is interesting, because the 'interior' turret drawing posted on here reminds me a ton of the Ob'yekt 187 prototype's turret design."
TankPorn,36k7zz,LTSarc,2,Thu May 21 00:17:09 2015 UTC,"187? 187 was a T-72 upgrade.  If you mean 195, I sort of agree (it's not a 'straight' derivative), and I called it: https://www.reddit.com/r/TankPorn/comments/3040wp/supposedly_this_is_russias_new_armata_afv/cppyucc  E: disclaimer - as did most of the rest of the internet. It was not, admittedly, all that hard to jump onto the bandwagon after it became clear that the tank would be crew-in-hull. :P  E2: though holy shit, the little image I dug up at the time seems to have been an almost exact match - all the way up to the placement of the optics, the APS, other electronics, stub ejection hatch and the lack of a coaxial  As far the shell is concerned - well, it's definitely designed as a modular vehicle, so if improvement is necessary I'm sure it can be. As it stands, it'll probably be altered before production, but in its current form it largely makes sense - with no bustle or crew to protect, there's no need to heavily armor too much beyond the mantlet, and thus the casing is probably to protect the tank's external electronics from small arms and fragments while also reducing the tank's radar signature (since MMW as a component of FCS looks to be the way of the future)."
TankPorn,36k7zz,anemonian,2,Thu May 21 00:27:14 2015 UTC,"No, I mean the 187. The 187 did start as a T-72B upgrade like its cousin the 188/T-72BU/T-90, but by prototype #6 shared very little with the T-72. The hull shape, 'interior' turret shape, roadwheel design, engine, gun, and several other details were shared between T-14 and the final 187 design. I'm not saying the 195 has no influence, as its the same team and the 195 was likely built on top of the 187 experience, with once again the same A-85 engine and next-gen gun. Technically the 2A66 125mm was tested on the 187, as the 2A82 was not yet available.  Just food for thought, all of this stuff is still super classified. Supposedly parts of the 195 are included in the T-14, so there is that."
TankPorn,36k7zz,LTSarc,2,Thu May 21 00:37:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's fair to say that vehicles 5 and 6 were definitely beyond the point of simply being T-72 derivatives. It's also correct to point out that it informed the development of the 195.  But in turn, it's important not to overstate the input of the 187. For one - the hull shaping of the 187 probably informed the protective aspect of the T-14's hull, but not the crew housing. 195 coupled the  protective features and engine housing of the 187 with the vital crew-in-hull element, and given that the 187 is better seen as a stepping stone than a defining element of the T-14's design. Roadwheels seem to be quite different on the T-14 to both, really.  Concerning the armament - yes, the 187's 2A66 definitely informed the development of the 2A82. On the other hand, the 2A82's development continued in other vehicles, and if Rogozin's hinting at the development of a 152mm T-14 is actually grounded in truth, then there's an obvious line to be drawn between 195 and T-14.  Concerning the 'interior' turret shape, I have to admit, I'm at a bit of a loss - there's very little information to go by. However, at the point at which 195 and T-14 are both crew-in-hull tanks, there's obviously going to be more similarity between these two vehicles' turrets in one key sense - though given the 195's projected 152mm armament, the T-14 may well have inherited a 187-derived autoloader.  So yeah, 187 informed 195 (and all of later Russian tank development to some extent), so you'll definitely see some of its features reflected in the T-14. But it's a bit harder to draw direct lines between the 187 and T-14 that don't run through the 195.  As you say though - a lot of this is classified, so I'm at a bit of a loss. It also doesn't help that my specialty is France and Japan, not the obscure, complex and classified hellhole that is late Cold War and 1990s Russian tank development. If you have any sources for what you've just talked about, I'd be very interested to read through them - would love to know more if somebody has information that'll disprove my current understanding."
TankPorn,36k7zz,anemonian,2,Thu May 21 01:12:42 2015 UTC,"My working assumption is that the 195 and T-14 were parallel developments, with the intention of the 152mm armed 195 to be the service tank. What became the T-14 was likely some plan B, with bits of the 195 folded in when that failed. The development trees look a bit like an MC Escher drawing.   Tank net has some pics of the 187 #6 model, and some of the hulks stored at Kubinka, but details on both of these are nearly nonexistant. Sources are confused and often contradictory, Fofanov is no longer updating and has not for quite some time, and there is no Hunnicut to write a book that cuts through the mess.  A hypothetical development path would be 187 -> 195 / ""187v2"" Plan B (pure conjecture here based on UVZ's prior dev patters of a main and a backup) -> Armata. I could be totally and utterly wrong, and this could just be a renamed 195.   But the more blocky, smaller turret suggests that after the more radical 195 failed, they went back to a more 187 inspired vehicle while keeping the hull and system improvements developed during the 195. Poor black eagle, nowhere to be seen.   All of the sources out there are various Russian webpages, nothing authoritative. It really is a pain to try to piece this together.   Ovtaga has the best write-up on the 187 (Which is sort of damning with faint praise, really): http://otvaga2004.ru/tanki/istoriya-sozdaniya/drugoy_t90/  There isn't even that much known on the 195, sadly. I really wish I had more sources to give out."
TankPorn,36k7zz,LTSarc,3,Thu May 21 01:35:55 2015 UTC,"I'm back!  Basically, the long and the short of it is, you can't draw direct continuity in Russian tank development from the 80s to the 2010s without taking the political-economic climate into account. Of particular note is the 90s and how the military-industrial complex crawled out of that particular 'decade of shame' with a steadily worsening limp, something that essentially came to a head in 2010.  To tl;dr it a bit, as you're probably aware, Russia post-Cold War wasn't in great shape; naturally, that fed into the ability of the defense-industrial complex to function effectively. While research continued, it didn't have quite the R&D funding  or higher direction of the Soviet era, and thus most of what they were doing was an aimless continuation of USSR-era projects. Eventually, the T-80 fell out of favour after Chechnya, and Uralvagonzavod found itself sitting on top of a contract to produce T-72BUs (hastily relabelled the T-90 to dissociate it from the well-publicised disaster of an operation that was First Grozny) into the next millenium, further bolstered by the procurement in '99 of an upgraded T-90 that brought its KEPs up to snuff, and then the 2001 decision by India to purchase T-90s too. It was enough to keep the company going, and presumably they'd been given the green light to go ahead with Obiekt 195 as well. 187's development fed into both the T-90 and the 195, but the 90, even in its upgraded iteration, didn't feature some of the more radical features of the 187's later model. The expectation was probably that the 195, not T-90 (despite its redesigned hull and turret) would succeed the 187 in that regard.  But then, there's a break in the linearity, courtesy of that 'limp' I referred to earlier. That comes in 2010 - largely because of the appointment of Anatoly Serdyukov as defence minister in 2010, the effects of which were huge. As well as the host of organisational reform that followed, the Ministry began to get combative in its industry relations too. 2010's where it comes to a head - after some combative comments (one good example is the deputy defense minister calling the BMP-3 a 'coffin', which the arms exporting concerns were very displeased by), the Ministry cancelled its BMP-3 buy, refuses to purchase the T-95 or BMPT, and publicly criticises the T-90. Their objection is twofold - Russian equipment isn't good enough, and to boot it's actually quite expensive. So, the Obiekt 195 is cancelled.  Serdyukov gets fired in 2012 - a combination of his treading on too many fingers and Putin's realisation after the 2011 elections that representative democracy was a clear and present danger and that he had to court the military and defence industry as electorates, not just bureaucracies. It also doesn't help that UVZ gets a lot of political capital in 2011 when one of Putin's trusted aides gets assigned its chairmanship, which gives them a strong voice (for six months, but a crucial six months at that) in Putin's ear.  He's gone, but the general shift towards modernisation isn't - the commander in chief of the Army has already taken the opportunity in 2011 to criticise the industry, something the military hadn't done before, and in 2012 the Deputy Prime Minister indicates that Russia will demand the 'best new weapons'. On top of that, the Russians are gradually formulating a more coherent approach to their defence modernisation, taking into account the pressures of its professionalisation and the need for rapid deployability to respond to a variety of threats, culminating in programs like Ratnik for the Ground Forces.  That's key - essentially, UVZ are told in 2010 that the 195, the culmination of their R&D, isn't enough. On top of that, a graddually clearer vision for Russian defence modernisation guiding procurement, requirements have gradually changed. It's not that the 195 was a fundamentally bad concept and they reverted to the 187 as a 'second choice'  (they stuck, after all, with an unmanned turret and other 195 design attributes) - rather, the 187 fed into the 195, and they were told that the 195 wasn't good enough. So during that gap between, say, 2011 and 2015, both UVZ and the Army filled their mutual requirements with filler projects like the T-72B3 modernisation packages (which kept UVZ more or less solvent), while UVZ worked on taking the 195 and making it better.   Hence, I think that 187 -> 195 -> T-14 is a more likely progression than 187 -> 195 -> 187 again -> T-14 because the 195 was likely built from the 187 anyway, and the Defense Ministry's objections weren't with the 195 specifically, but with their having to buy Cold War equipment in general at 21st century prices. So they took the 195 proposal, stuck with the core design tenets (unmanned turret, well-protected hull derived from the 187, automotive parts like the A-85 engine that the 187 started with and that fed into the 195), while most likely altering the tank so that it came with a more comprehensive package of electronics, at a lower weight range, with more modularity/upgradeability and so on. Price was definitely a big issue too - I don't get the impression that the defense ministry was satisfied with the prices of the first lot of vehicles, certainly.  tl;dr again: Russia's problem in '10 when it cancelled the 195 wasn't necessarily the 195 concept itself, but the fact that they were being forced to buy Soviet era materiel, more or less, reflected in a blanket rejection of products from the Obiekt 195 to the BMP-3. The T-14 probably marks a shift away from both the 187 and 195 in that regard, with UVZ responding to the Defence Ministry's objections alongside other major firms (Kalashnikov, Kurganmashzavod etc) by presenting a more acceptable 'modernisation' option in line with a more coherent Russian vision for the future of their military, and utilising the technology developed on the base of both the 187 and 195 in the development of a somewhat different vehicle that reflects the contemporary, and not two-decades outdated, concerns and wants of the Russian military (deployability, modularity, electronics etc).  It's speculation on my part, but I feel that the break in 2010 with the defence industry is an underappreciated shift in Russian procurement policy; with ground equipment in particular, it appears to have marked a shift away from the purchases they'd been happy enough to make since the end of the Cold War towards a more coherent program for materiel acquisitions informed by a clear vision for modernisation into the next decade."

As for what I think such a design will spawn, if the armor on the hull, the turret, and the crew compartment increase as a result of the saved weight of the uncrewed and autoloading turret, I feel as if the armament side of things will start to swing towards large-caliber HE and HESH rounds or the incorporation of explosive fillers into penetrators to knock out and destroy the turret and it's components, making the tank combat ineffective."

Basically a uniform weapons system.  As far as price is concerned, each vehicle is roughly $7.4 million, so not the cheapest things in the world. My guess is that Russia designed this system so that they can build more tanks/SPG's/IFV's etc. faster and more easily since they all will run on the same base model. This seems to be the case also since they plan to produce at least 500 tanks a year, with 2300 vehicles in total across the entire platform by 2020.

Tiger 11, together with six other Tigers, were destroyed its crew after becoming bogged down after heavy rain. This Tiger's turret was flipped upside-down by the explosion. The Tigers were part of 7. Kompanie/Panzer-Regiment 7 at the time, as part of Operation Ochsenkopf, though they were originally assigned to 1. Kompanie/501. schwere Panzer-Abteilung. After being delayed at the battle of Sidi N'sir, the Tigers were ambushed at Hunt's Gap on 28 February, where they fought for several days. During the battle, the commander, Oberleutnant Hartmann, was wounded. Of special interest is the deformation at the middle of the gun barrel, indicating overheating due to prolonged firing.    edit: Here are more pictures, a map and some info about Hunt's Gap where 11 was destroyed with two other Tigers."

TankPorn,36etx8,0000013,7,Tue May 19 04:15:35 2015 UTC,"German-Japan ""Alliance"" was never that close due to distance to be honest.  for all those wondering the weird marital bed statuses of ww2 powers in the 30s, Hitler for one was very opportunistic and and twitchy in his plans so just like many others he kept on trying to secure deals and alliances on whichever side the wind was blowing (and tungsten is as good a reason as any, really).  Not unlike france or UK, to be honest, who also kept on trying to make alliances with whoever sounded the strongest opponent to germany.  There is a reason germany and USSR ended to start the war on the same side, but it is also a possibility the war could have started with germany and poland being against USSR, UK and France.  One of the main reasons the Molotov-Ribbentrop treaty was signed was due to UK betting that Poland would be a stronger ally militarily against Hitler than USSR, which meant that the british negotiating party sent to Stalin never really had any authority to give Stalin what he wanted in exchange for a pact against germany- namely the parts of poland and eastern europe that he was promised in the molotov-ribbentrop."

TankPorn,36etx8,Tammo-Korsai,6,Tue May 19 00:18:21 2015 UTC,"Look up Sino-German relations during the interwar period. Huge allies. Chinese soldiers were often trained by German officers, used Kar98 Mausers, and wore the Stalhelm. They were very close."
TankPorn,36etx8,pt_Hazard,5,Tue May 19 00:20:05 2015 UTC,"This cooperation frustrated the Japanese to the point they nicknamed the Battle of Shanghai the 'German War' as German advisers wrote up Operation Iron Fist for a major Chinese attack on the SNLF base, then went even further when some officers personally waded into combat.   It really does bewilder me that Germany switched around and got friendly with Japan as even after the advisers went home, they sold China some Sdkfz 221 and 222 armoured cars with the means to make spare parts in exchange for more tungsten. But in the eyes of the world at the time, China did appear to be on course to capitulating in 1938 after the Rape of Nanking and other defeats.   TL;DR: Germany would do anything for a klondike bar tungsten shipment."
TankPorn,36etx8,Tammo-Korsai,6,Tue May 19 00:57:01 2015 UTC,Tungsten was more valuable than  gold because it could be used at the core of many armor piercing tank rounds right? Or did it have any other uses?
TankPorn,36etx8,Mrprocrastinaut,5,Tue May 19 03:36:26 2015 UTC,Machine tooling was another valuable application.

I mean a lot."
TankPorn,36bpn6,HorrificAnalInjuries,6,Mon May 18 03:10:42 2015 UTC,"Firstly, the spaced armor that the tank has in this picture was bolted on after it was delivered to Europe to attempt to give it survivability against King Tigers   That's what Belton Cooper thought at least. Apparently it was his responsibility to design and install the applique on 3AD's T26E4. The add-on armour on the glacis is made out of two layers of 1.5"" boiler plates. The top layer set at 60 degrees while the other at 52 degrees from vertical.   The armour covering the mantlet is cut from the ""faceplate"" 88 mm thick out of a knocked out Panther. In order to counter balance that however they added on the boiler plate ears to it on top of the equilibrator springs and the counter balance at the rear of the turret bustle that the T26E4 already started out with.   Secondly, that gun had a lot of penetration. I mean a lot.   From Hunnicutt  At 30 degrees from 500 yards    T44 HVAP had 244 mm of penetration  T43 AP had 132 mm of penetration   For comparison the short 90 mm M3 L/52.5's T33 shot could penetrate the Panther's glacis from 1100 yards (T33 AP actually does better than T30E16 HVAP against its 55 degree glacis)  while the T33 shot out of the long 90 mm T15 L/72.6 could penetrate it from 2600 yards."

TankPorn,36bpn6,LeuCeaMia,3,Mon May 18 11:15:02 2015 UTC,I believe they had to add counterweights because the gun was so long it would upset the balance or kill the elevation mechanism?
TankPorn,36bpn6,lockpickerkuroko,2,Mon May 18 06:50:11 2015 UTC,"The external equilibrator springs, to help the gun elevate, were only on the T26E4 because the new internal hydropneumatic equilibrator wasn't yet in production.

From: Belton Cooper's Death Traps   Next, we road-tested the tank, then drove it to the edge of the vobridge to test-fire the gun. We looked around for a suitable target and finally found a knocked-out German Jagdpanzer IV assault gun that had been hit by a single shot to the flank and had not burned. We hooked it up to one of our wreckers and dragged it to the other side of the vobridge, on the first level about fifty feet below the crest. The Jagdpanzer was positioned with the forward glacis plate facing us. The distance to our target was approximately a mile and a half.  When we looked at the target, I was dumbfounded. The 90mm projectile penetrated four inches of armor; went through a five-inch final drive differential shaft, the fighting compartment, and the rear partition of the fighting compartment; penetrated the four-and-a-half-inch crankshaft of the Maybach engine and the one-inch rear armor plate; and dug itself into the ground so deep that we could not locate it. Although we had been told by the ordnance officers from Aberdeen that the tank gun could penetrate thirteen inches of armor at a hundred yards, it was still difficult to believe this awesome power. We all realized that we had a weapon that could blast the hell out of even the most powerful German Mark VI Tiger."

TankPorn,369hlh,-BiD-,3,Sun May 17 15:48:41 2015 UTC,"No, not really but this story has 2 sides. The E-10 was originally called the Hetzer(in documentation), and not the Jagdpanzer 38(t). E-10 was a tankdestroyer project similar as the 38(t), but the German soldiers used the name Hetzer for the 38(t) version during the war (Guderian also wrote a note that this name has been spontaniously coined by them). After the war this name became known for the 38(t) instead of the E-10, while the E-10 has this name officially in documentary (though never deployed). Some say people (historians, (ex-)soldiers, allies) messed up and confused both projects and their names, and thus the 38(t) became known as the Hetzer. I hope this explains it."

Well, it's either an M3, or an M2 medium tank, I'm not positive.   Come to think of it, it's probably an M2 medium tank.  Tons of tanks and armored vehicles all over Fort Carson. Off the top of my head, and what I'm aware of, there's about 10 or so Patton tanks, I believe covering every full-production generation of it; there's 2-3 Shermans, I'm not sure what specific variants, but they look like M4A4's when I drive past them; there's at least 1 T-72, I assume an Iraqi one; I think there's an M26 Pershing floating around somewhere...  Of the not-exactly-a-tank variety, there's a Cadillac Gage Commando, of the turret-less variety; there's two APCs that I think are an M59 and an M75; a BMP-1, I assume also Iraqi; an M2 half-track; at least one M114; one or two M2 Bradleys; an M901 ITV; two or three M728 CEVs; I'm pretty sure I've seen an M107 self-propelled gun around; and a self-propelled gun that looks somewhat like an M7 Priest, but has a much higher caliber gun, and a much more blocky appearance.

You'd have to have a 'valid reason' for visiting the installation, I'm not sure if 'looking at display tanks aaaaaaaaallllllllllll over the post' would qualify. Not saying it wouldn't, but it might not.  You'd also need valid and current state or federal ID, no wants or warrants (when applying for a visitor's pass, they'll run you through an NCIC background check), and if driving, valid registration and insurance on the vehicle you're operating.

TankPorn,35xoaf,YT4LYFE,12,Thu May 14 18:44:46 2015 UTC,"video source   Impacts against hard targets result in local temperatures as high as 1,800°C, which results in a phase change in uranium from solid to liquid. At these elevated temperatures, the uranium reacts readily with atmospheric oxygen. The oxides formed subsequently condense to solid aerosol particles. Oxidation is the source of the pyrophoric nature of DU impacts and is not present with WHA impacts. This burning effect enhances the effectiveness of DU penetrators, particularly inside the target.    http://www.journal.forces.gc.ca/vo4/no1/research-recherch-eng.asp  edit: comments on the original video suggest this was actually a tungsten round."

This is irrelevant to the post but I still want to talk about them a bit, the difference is that the SU-152 was produced on the KV-1S heavy tank chassis, while the ISU on the later IS tank chassis.   While they had obviously the same gun, the main difference is in the rear (where SU has the old KV style overhang and ISU has the sloped IS rear), the height of the superstructure (ISU has a higher structure with steeper slopes but the SU has a higher chassis so they're the same height) and most importantly for my example, on the front glacis.  The SU has the KV's front, with the thin extra armour plate on the edge between the top plate and bottom plate, while the ISU has IS's smooth front. The position and design of the towing hooks also differs.  I made a little image beacuse I have too much time"

No, seriously, I know it had armour, but the ISU-152 did seem to have very little armour in the front and a large profile, which made it a sitting duck a lot of the time. I assume that, like the SU/ISU series assault guns, this thing was rushed into service just for the sake of getting more high-calibre guns on the field to deal with German heavy tanks, right?"
TankPorn,35x919,Happycamper101,6,Thu May 14 08:12:47 2015 UTC,"90 mm of slightly sloped armor is not very bad, it is Tiger level of frontal armor, lol."
TankPorn,35x919,Retiv,4,Thu May 14 15:10:39 2015 UTC,"Well the SU-152 in the picture was the first attempt at a seriously large assault gun, and the large superstructure was needed to house the large gun.  However, it wasn't made for fighting German heavy tanks, or even tanks in general. It wasn't a tank destroyer, The original design was intended for destroying heavy fortifications, hence the giant gun, the tank was meant to stay in the back lines and fire on enemy fortified positions such as pillboxes, it could also perform an artillery role from a longer distance.  The one in the picture was most likely knocked out by an artillery shell, or an anti-tank gun, or maybe a tank if they lost the position and were overwhelmed by the enemy.  The tank got it's reputation as a tank killer by chance, as the crews realised that the gun was large enough to knock out any German heavy tank, and the modernised ISU version sported more armour for the sake of better protection closer to the frontline, and it was adopted as a tank destroyer after that."
TankPorn,35x919,ExplosiveMachine,4,Thu May 14 16:21:26 2015 UTC,"Little armor is all perspective of what it might fight. Against a Tiger it didn't stand a chance, but against a PzIII or PzIV it would fair much better."
TankPorn,35x919,maxout2142,4,Thu May 14 15:10:31 2015 UTC,"Little armor is all perspective of what it might fight   You are correct. It had little armour because the original targets couldn't really fight back - it was designed to deal with bunkers and pillboxes around and in Stalingrad, as a replacement for the not-that-successful KV-2.  The later ISU-152 had more armour when it also performed a role as a heavy tank destroyer."

Apparently this Leopard got sand in its barrel when driving through some dunes which led to this when the crew tried to fire.   That's all I got though... Sorry!
TankPorn,35vay9,Peabush,30,Wed May 13 20:32:27 2015 UTC,"Ill check with the my squadron. Someone is bound to know what happend here. Wait out.  Edit: You are right. Aparantly the Royal hussars from 2/1 GHR (2nd squadron 1st battalion) were on a live fire exercise in OKSBØL Denmark. And under a march from what we call Bajshøj to a location called the ""old petrol station"" They drove into a sand dune and had the gun dug into it.  And did not care to check the barrel afterwards. When they eventually fired it was with the sad result you are seeing here. An act of carelessness and being caught in the moment.   The commander of this tank happend to also be an officer who was then stationed in a different regiment as commanding officer for a unit of sergent recruits. On the Danish Army Sergent School, which was i Sønderborg at the time.   Also the same crew managed to drown another tank aswell as topple one on the side during the same exercise."

TankPorn,35vay9,Drallo,8,Wed May 13 20:58:00 2015 UTC,I've seen pictures of a similar thing happen to an Abrams (smooth bore) at NTC.

TankPorn,35vay9,Peabush,8,Wed May 13 22:37:37 2015 UTC,"That would cause the same problem as a live shell, if the barrel is clogged."

TankPorn,35vay9,Peabush,4,Wed May 13 22:36:41 2015 UTC,It is. Just ask the germans. ;)   A crew of Leopard 2 tankers from Germany were getting annoyed at their tank commander for leaving his beret everywhere.  They then shoved it into the tube prior to loading the gun and closing the breach to teach him a lesson.  Gun exploded and a similar result to the image above.  I don't think neither the crew or the commander was in good standing afterwards.  A freaking beret!
TankPorn,35vay9,3rdweal,3,Thu May 14 01:07:04 2015 UTC,"Judging by the terrain we can see in the pic, it looks like thick, dirty coastal sand as opposed to thin desert sand.  I can see a tank barrel getting jammed up with that stuff."

TankPorn,35jlgw,TouniXVIII,1 point,Mon May 11 13:47:31 2015 UTC,Something seems off about this. I remember watching a documentary and it said that when the Germans first encountered the Churchill they were told to leave them since they were outdated technology. The appearance and performance of tank made the Germans think the British were sending WW1 era tanks to their doom. Maybe this was just for testing or something.
TankPorn,35jlgw,brandx1982,2,Mon May 11 05:48:59 2015 UTC,"To be fair, later Marks of the Churchill were extremely effective against German medium tanks with both the 6-lber (57mm) gun and the 75mm Vickers HV. Although they were slower than hell, their armor would have proved problematic for lower velocity guns in Allied service if they had used later captured models."

TankPorn,35iz99,MrJalepeno484,9,Sun May 10 21:31:50 2015 UTC,"It's beautiful because it's a stopgap measure, a careful balance of what the allies knew they needed (a mobile armoured platform with the 75mm gun) and knew they could do (American factories didn't yet have the ability to cast a full turret large enough for the 75mm gun).  But the U.S. had been slacking in tank design, and the British needed tanks yesterday, so it got slammed into production, and actually did very well in Africa all things considered.  If you ask me, it's a shame none of the American heavy tank projects throughout the war were really successful (both the T14 and T1 Heavy were more or less scrapped, and the Pershing came in too late to see a whole lot of action).  Of course, strictly from an engineer's point of view, it's also a shame the Germans never got the Entwicklung programme off the ground, the Russians never built the KV-4 (whatever ephemeral plans they had for it), and that Porsche never designed a tank that wasn't a mechanical nightmare."
TankPorn,35iz99,FoxtrotZero,2,Sun May 10 23:52:37 2015 UTC,"it is very likely that if it hasnt been for Mr. McNair, the Pershing wouldve been in production and in europe a lot earlier."

TankPorn,35iz99,FoxtrotZero,1 point,Tue May 12 00:28:05 2015 UTC,"you get the simplified version from english wikipedia.  Basically, McNair was artillery general who was strong advocate of the tank destroyer doctrine, which meant tanks should not need to be able to fight other tanks, because tank destroyahs!!!!  unfortunately he was ALSO big on forming the ""battle need"" setup for thye supply lines, where he ran for straightforwading the efficiency- as few models, as few different parts, as few different systems as possible- read: sherman and sherman-based TDs only.  it is basically the same tragedy as with the british who declared at the end of 1943 that any tank design that was not guaranteed to be in production by 1944 should be postponed in favor of building those that could be fielded as fast as possible- again a reasonable idea, but led to the fact that the brits got their hand on one of the best tanks in the world (centurion) an year too late.  of course, these are all ""what if"" scenarios, so the alternative COULD have been that rushing pershing and centruion wouldve led into a cascade of disasters with unreliable, untested new tanks."

TankPorn,35a7ht,thefonztm,14,Fri May 8 16:00:44 2015 UTC,"A good start.   It also doesn't have a tank's targeting system for engaging targets at tank ranges, which are point blank to 5000 meters. The gun doesn't even depress to zero elevation for point blank engagemnt, much less the slightly negativ  elevation of modern tanks. Nor does it fire any  armor piercing ammunition. Usually the massive guns on them (about 20-30% larger than a tank's) require them to deploy a rear entrenchment buffer to transfer the recoil energy to the ground too.   Still, a very good video.

TankPorn,35a7ht,thefonztm,9,Fri May 8 16:55:49 2015 UTC,"Length wise, the profile isn't too different. Height wise, it is much taller. Tanks are designed to have low profiles to provide a smaller target. Also notice that the turret doesn't have a 'tank-like' geometry. Even if it's armor was equivalent to the tank's it is much more vulnerable because it provides large, flat, vertical surfaces. A tank's turret is designed to deflect incoming fire.  2S3 (vehicle in OP's video.)  An Abrams  A Leopard  A T90  The fancy-pants Armata  It's no banana, but you can use the crew members to get a reference point for the size of the turrets.  Also, we need to consider the purpose of each vehicle when looking at the size of the turret. The 2S3 has a large turret to give the crew plenty of room to work fast and also store ammunition. Those considerations are also present in the tank turrets, but the solutions are different. Since  the tank is expected to face direct combat, protection has been emphasized over providing plenty of space for the crew to work.  This is not a complete set of reasons (there are many more), but it should be a good starting point if you want to dig more."

It is real easy to loose your bearings just looking through a sight or at a computer display. Anyone who has tried to TC a stryker in its original configuration will know that it is incredibly difficult which is why most units move the Stryker commander to the back of the vehicle to use the air watch hatches.

TankPorn,34zbi0,ImOP_need_nerf,16,Wed May 6 01:22:27 2015 UTC,"I know you're just messing around, but a TC needs to fight from the hatch. Taking that away from him will severely degrade this tanks fighting ability and survivability.   This is what happens when designers and engineers don't truly understand the needs they need to fulfill with their designs. Sensors and cameras can not fill the gap that simply sticking your head out of the hatch can. They want to increase crew survivability so they plan around the concept of keeping crews buttoned up at all times. But they loose sight of the fact that a certain amount of assumption of risk on the TC part (fighting more exposed from the commanders cupola) actually lessens the overall risk for the entire crew. The added benefit of being able to see and fight the battle reduces the likely hood that you will be hit.   This is especially the case in modern combat which is moving more and more into urban environments. Being completely buttoned up in a city without the ability to at least go to the open-protected will leave this vehicle severely exposed and surrounded by blind spots. Coupled with the fact soviet doctrine allows for tanks to fight as a single unit in stead of in fixed sections or with a wingman means that this tank will be left alone and exposed to dismounted threats."
TankPorn,34zbi0,rscott89,15,Wed May 6 01:39:55 2015 UTC,"These are salient points, but also consider that modern tanks offer previously unavailable levels of target location, identification, tracking, locking, friendly location and movement, etc. Traditionally TCs didn't have these luxuries. In the end NO crew isn't a bad way to go, and future wars will be fought with robotics, predominantly. On one hand it's a good thing, on the other it will make governments less likely to hesitate before deploying their killer robot armies. Like what we do in Pakistan with drone bombers - zero fucks given - yet imagine the shit storm that would follow if they drone bombed some random suburb in AZ!"
TankPorn,34zbi0,ImOP_need_nerf,5,Wed May 6 04:51:48 2015 UTC,"People always mention drones being a PR disaster, but it's the opposite. We've killed thousands of people with the things, and almost no one in the public cares because our own soldiers aren't at risk.   The next generation of Western designs are going to be interesting I think. What isn't automated is going to be completely built from the ground up for survivability, because the lesson of the last decade is so long as none of the troops die the military can act with impunity."

Wait, what the fuck? If that was done some decades ago that would be national news, and an act of war.... Why isn't Pakhistan raising a stink? Oh wait, they are... WE just don't give a shit. So much for national sovereignty. This is part of why I still think voting for Obama was the right choice, but I'm not necessarily at the same level of pride about it.

TankPorn,34zbi0,CoolGuy54,1 point,Wed May 6 03:19:14 2015 UTC,"I'll agree training can help you become more comfortable with your systems over time, to the point that it begins to feel natural. I love my CITV and can use it flawlessly to identify and designate targets. That being said, when the CITV fails, I have contingency sights or can just fight from the hatch. Like I said below you should never plan for an asset or equipment because at some point it will fail when you need it most. In my Abrams we have 4 different independent sights the last of which is little more than a scope over the gun-tube which is almost impossible to knock out. We have these because we know that at some point the other sights will/could be destroyed.   With the crew being kept in the hull and the reliance on the advanced technologies I just don't see how the contingencies are there. Tanks are very maintenance heavy, things will break on them and thats just a fact. Tank crews become very good at fixing and maintaining their equipment. But the more you put computers and cameras and other things which can't be fixed with a wrench and a sledge-hammer or covered down on by other manual or mechanical systems the more you increase the possibility that the vehicle can be deadlined by small problems. One camera breaks, one screen goes out, one electrical system shorts out and all the sudden your vehicle is severely degraded without a back up system or capability to keep it in the fight.    Don't get me wrong, straight up in the initial fight I don't think this vehicle would have major issues as long as the crews are well trained and adapted to fighting in front of screens. But in sustained combat and over long maneuvers, issues will begin to show and they wont be able to be circumvented."

I believe the Indian Su-30MKI also had some major issues with its Russian developed engines.  On top of that, the Armata is huge departure from traditional Russian tank design. From what I understand, it's far taller and heavier than its predecessors, and has a completely different shape to it. Russia's been using designs that evolved from the T-54 ever since the 1950's, I can't help but feel there's going to be some significant issues to work out even without considering the more advanced features. And not just from a design perspective, but from a doctrinal one as well.  Hell, its not even a Russian problem. Everyone has issues with newly developed vehicles. You just hear less about them with Russia because their so secretive about them."

I understand that there are very smart and highly qualified people who designed this. But also from my experience with many US vehicles which also have experts design them, there are always flaws which stem from the disconnect between the people designing the vehicles and the people fighting in them.   I used the Stryker as an example, a very expensive, overly designed military vehicle engineered by highly skilled and qualified individuals who placed the vehicle commander inclosed inside the stryker with no hatch of his own convinced that he could use cameras, and integrated vehicle systems like the FBCB2. What happened with that is when it got to the force and units started to use them they found the commander could not do his job from where the experts had positioned him. As such, many units retrofitted the insides of their Strykers so that the commanders equipment was moved the the rear of the vehicle so he could use the airwatch hatch as a vehicle commanders hatch.    I don't doubt that these engineers have good intentions, hell they may have designed it so well that it defies conventional thinking and will overcome its perceived short comings and this design will become the norm of all future tanks. But, that is unlikely, the general tank layout has not changed much since world war 2 because it works, this goes against that. Until we see it in a conflict we wont really know for sure what it can do."

TankPorn,34zbi0,rscott89,0,Wed May 6 14:06:49 2015 UTC,"I think using VR would be a great asset for the crew. However, you should never plan for an asset or a piece of equipment without having ample contingencies. Any plan that hinders on one single piece of technology is doomed because at some point that equipment will fail and when that happens you are fucked. As an added piece of tech, sure VR would be great, but you have to be able to fight without it. This vehicle does not seem to have the necessary contingencies for if the systems go down, just like relying on VR to cover dead space will fail when that VR system breaks. It would be a great addition to any fighting vehicle, but should not be something you turn to as a make up for poor design."

TankPorn,34zbi0,rscott89,2,Thu May 7 04:12:11 2015 UTC,I am just trying to give people some insight into what I see from my experience as a tanker. If your experience from inside a tank differs from mine please share.
TankPorn,34zbi0,Aedeus,7,Thu May 7 10:35:06 2015 UTC,So are they fucked if there's a malfunction?  With 0 crew in the turret it seems like corrective action and manual control is out of the question.
TankPorn,34zbi0,rscott89,6,Tue May 5 23:21:17 2015 UTC,"I'm nowhere near the military or tanking but I'm curious how many malfunctions a tank crew sees in combat. How many of those are fixable in the heat of battle? I know that auto loaders are more complicated and less reliable than manual, but Russia apparently feels that with their experience it's still worth it.   Beyond that you can't hand crank the turret or similar manual overrides so I'm curious what types of issues normal tanks face in the field that could be fixed by a crew member.   Lastly, something we can only guess on is that maybe by removing the crew not only is space saved but that there is room for many levels of redundancy not available to conventional tanks - but that will be pure speculation for a long time I'm guessing."
TankPorn,34zbi0,spankaway,2,Wed May 6 14:12:05 2015 UTC,"Tanks are incredibly maintenance heavy. For every hour a tank is in a fight plan for 2-3 in maintenance. its something tankers learn very quickly to appreciate, take care of your equipment constantly and it will take care of you, otherwise it will fail you when you need it most. Top off POL every chance you get, check the track tension and all the grease points, make sure everything is properly lubed and secured or else you will have issues.   Things break, which is why we have many redundant systems within the tank. For example in the Abrams I have 4 independent sights so that I have contingencies for my contingencies should my sights get knocked out. There are a number of ways to do everything on the Abrams, electronically, mechanically, and manually. This vehicle doesn't seem to allow for all those contingencies based on what we know of the layout. There may be more that we can't see, but based on just the fact that it relies on an auto-loader without the crew even in the turret to trouble shoot problems I see that as a very big assumption of risk on their part."
TankPorn,34zbi0,Aedeus,11,Wed May 6 15:07:12 2015 UTC,Keep in mind that Russians have something like 50 years worth of experience with autoloaders. This development doesn't come from nowhere.
TankPorn,34zbi0,spankaway,0,Wed May 6 15:37:50 2015 UTC,Yes but mechanical failures will happen at some point.
TankPorn,34zbi0,senoritaoscar,8,Wed May 6 16:49:40 2015 UTC,Of course. There are always compromises. Fly-by-wire/unstable airframe systems were controversial for the same reasons. The question is whether the trade-offs are worth it.
TankPorn,34zbi0,KorianHUN,-1,Wed May 6 17:21:59 2015 UTC,"Yes, and they also seemed to think keeping all the ammo in a ring under the turret was a good idea."
TankPorn,34zbi0,LeuCeaMia,4,Wed May 6 17:22:27 2015 UTC,"It is needed for the autoloader to load fast enough. Yes, on the Abrams, it is in a separate compartment, but if something pierces through the turret and kills the crew, then the tank can't function either. Russians still carry traces of the soviet military doctrine, by giving up one thing to gain a new advantage (faster loading by autoloader), but if you look at their plans, they don't think the tank will be hit anyway. In the age of soon available full active protection, they don't have to think about getting hit for a long time."
TankPorn,34zbi0,KorianHUN,1 point,Wed May 6 20:30:38 2015 UTC,"One of the advantages of the Object 640 ""Black Eagle""s bustle autoloader is that it loads rounds much faster.

The Challenger 1/2 stores the propellant charges and HESH in the fighting compartment, below the turret ring while APFSDS is stored in the turret bustle."

But for me, I think I'm more skeptical of the quality of the optics than their vulnerability. 'Will they allow the T-14 to engage targets at ""safe"" distances?' might be a better question.    Is the new composite armor as great as they say? Is the engine reliable? Are the targeting systems accurate? Is the remote turret responsive and rugged enough for combat? Etc. etc. etc.    Unfortunately, the world may only get answers to these questions when Russia decides to use the T-14 against a comparable opponent...

TankPorn,34y90k,finackles,20,Tue May 5 18:08:20 2015 UTC,"99% Hindsight.  There's also the issue of it's place in history. When this tank was originally designed it would have been a capable tank. Most anti-tank guns were about 37mm. It's armor would have been sufficient as well. There's also the issue of tactics. Germany really brought the idea of highly mobile tank warfare to the fore. Prior to that tanks were largely envisioned plodding forward, supporting the infantry.   Few people really comprehend just how fast the development of military tech went in WWII. In less than six years you went from German invading Poland with the 20mm armed PZ II to the King Tiger. From the Hawker Hurricane to the Meteor. From the B-10 to the B-29. From 100lb bombs to Fat Man."

TankPorn,34y90k,P-01S,4,Tue May 5 20:06:54 2015 UTC,Well the UK had interesting ideas. I was obviously generalizing a lot. The Cruiser/Infantry tank divide in the UK army was an interesting one. Ultimately what they found was that neither branch was getting it entirely right.  North Africa wasn't really unlucky so much as it was their first chance to put their tank tactics to the test.
TankPorn,34y90k,jdmgto,2,Tue May 5 20:50:02 2015 UTC,"by the time the UK was engaging german tanks, the germans had experience in numerous fronts.

TankPorn,34tt5o,Kytescall,3,Mon May 4 14:37:38 2015 UTC,"Image source.  Its full name is the CBRN (Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear) Remote Operated Work Vehicle System, which is a mouthful so I didn't put it in the title. It is derived from the Facility Work Vehicle which I posted yesterday (info).   It was developed following the Fukushima disaster, and as its name suggests, it is designed to do engineering work (remove obstacles, etc) and recon in various types of contaminated areas. It no longer appears to have a power shovel, but adds a robotic manipulator arm, as well as a wide array of sensors such as optical, IR, and gamma-ray cameras.  Part of the system are these optionally manned signal relay vehicles which extend the range at which the operators can control the main vehicles.  Even in the original manned Facility Work Vehicle, some functions could be performed autonomously (for example, the shovel could be made to dig in a preprogrammed manner without further input from the operator), so it's reasonable to expect that this UGV can perform at least some autonomous functions as well.

We actually didn't replace the engine in the M5, we replaced the pressure plate within the clutch of the M3. The repair was necessary because it was so worn out. And given that it was the original pressure plate it was in need of a new one. Unfortunately, after replacing the pressure plate the first time the clutch wouldn't engage.  Long story short the new plate was defective and the track almost didn't make it to the event."
TankPorn,34sla1,TheHIV123,2,Sun May 10 20:58:20 2015 UTC,"That's awesome! I hope you had fun. It gets a little warm doesn't it?   Yes I had a very good time.   We actually didn't replace the engine in the M5, we replaced the pressure plate within the clutch of the M3.    Perhaps I misheard the crew then, because they and a number of the other people seemingly involved with the vehicle all mentioned that the twin Cadillac V8 had been replaced with a single V8. And upon inspection of the the interior the single drive shaft seemed to support their claims. Additionally the twin mufflers on the bottom of the tank are certainly not original, so something must have been changed."

TankPorn,34nlgi,Victory1160,20,Sat May 2 20:24:18 2015 UTC,"Boo 👎 where is my smoothbore?  (Cool picture, man!)"
TankPorn,34nlgi,hauntingbadger,7,Sat May 2 20:57:38 2015 UTC,What is the advantage of a smoothbore? I was under the impression that a rifled barrel is more accurate?
TankPorn,34nlgi,Hans_Adler,7,Sun May 3 01:08:30 2015 UTC,"Modern APFSDS tank shells use fins to stabilise themselves (like arrows), they do that because of their high length-to-diameter ratio. The higher the ratio the higher the spin rate must be to provide stable flight. Since they have a dartlike shape it's impractical/impossible to properly stabilise them with spin.  I would also assume it's easier to use smoothbore guns for other types of projectiles like canister shots or missiles since you don't have to worry about preserving the rifling.  EDIT: proparly -> properly"
TankPorn,34nlgi,PowderTrail,4,Sun May 3 03:23:17 2015 UTC,This is the reason. Along with the point that HEAT is supposed to be less effective when spin stabilized due to the dispersion of the molten penetrator through angular momentum.
TankPorn,34nlgi,TankerD18,1 point,Sun May 3 04:16:30 2015 UTC,"Huh, really? Nice to know."
TankPorn,34nlgi,PowderTrail,1 point,Sun May 3 04:18:33 2015 UTC,"Yep. This effect was even known in WW2. The German Army developed HEAT projectiles where the shaped charge was stabilized with ball bearings. So even though the shell was rotating, the inside of it stayed stationary, allowing the penetrator to form perfectly. Didn't go into production though because they made the PAW 600 already: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8_cm_PAW_600"
TankPorn,34nlgi,Type-21,5,Sat May 9 16:34:42 2015 UTC,There reaches a certain point with high velocity the rifling won't make too much of a difference. The NATO 120mm shells are all stable out to extreme distances without the rifling. That's about the gist of what I know. Others may be able to explain it better.

Finland was way farther on axis camp than many other of their ""allies"" and the butthurtness and theory of fnland ""fighting its own war merely at the same time"" has been proven rubbish long ago.  so whilst the swastika predates the nazis, finns were fighting most of the war on their side, switching at teh very end due to the truce terms with USSR.

TankPorn,34fndl,benadril,1 point,Fri May 1 05:34:18 2015 UTC,"Imo, the key difference here is the word ""Reactive"".  In NERA armor, the elements within it behave or react differently and interact with each other to stop the incoming projectile. Things like different materials to absorb the impact.  Spaced armor uses the property of the outer casing, where the armor is no different from that of the main hull. There are no elements within Spaced Armor that would ""React"" to the incoming round."

TankPorn,34d09m,BitchpuddingBLAM,3,Fri May 1 03:06:33 2015 UTC,"Given the Chaffee's light weight and relatively delicate turret ring, a 90mm gun firing full-charge rounds ala the Pershing or M36 would probably damage the tank pretty quickly, as the recoil threw the gun back into the turret after every shot. The Chaffee normally wouldn't have the mass or the room to take a gun of that caliber.   Reducing the propellant charge lowered the ""firing pressure"" of the gun and decreased the strain on the chassis, in exchange for a corresponding decrease in muzzle velocity. This allowed the Chaffee to feasibly mount a 90mm gun."

TankPorn,348w6m,Luneworm,3,Wed Apr 29 12:27:59 2015 UTC,lets call in an expert on destroyed tanks  /u/3rdweal
TankPorn,348w6m,Perry87,2,Wed Apr 29 17:12:25 2015 UTC,"Would you think it has to be blown apart like this to be considered destroyed?  Due to the nature of armor, what might seem at first glance to be a perfectly intact vehicle save for a small penetrating hole might be well and truly devastated on the inside, enough to be beyond repair."
TankPorn,348w6m,3rdweal,2,Thu Apr 30 01:30:02 2015 UTC,What's up with the top of the turret by the gun did some ammo cook off when it was being loaded or something
TankPorn,348w6m,TexasTango,2,Wed Apr 29 07:33:22 2015 UTC,"You mean how it looks kinda bowed up there? It is kind of a weird place and shape to be damaged. It looks like it's right on the front seam of the turret, with the most damage in the front edge.   It seems like if the ammo had cooked off, it wouldn't have split a seam on the turret like that. but it's odd for sure."
TankPorn,348w6m,QuerulousPanda,2,Wed Apr 29 08:20:08 2015 UTC,I bet just the one loaded/being loaded cooked off and split along the weld lines. Could've been a bad round.

TankPorn,3441rv,burgerbob22,9,Tue Apr 28 08:02:25 2015 UTC,"Well, yes and no. The M41 is still being used, but Denmark retired theirs in the late 90's. Several of them are being maintained for demonstration purposes by the veterans who used to crew them. Interestingly, these M41s still regularly live-fire ammunition, since the Danish Army no longer has any other use for the large amounts of 76mm ammunition it has lying around.   I know Uruguay and my native Taiwan both have M41s in active service, with substantial modifications in both cases."
TankPorn,3441rv,ExplosiveMachine,5,Tue Apr 28 09:26:49 2015 UTC,"I like it's small size. And yeah, there are plenty old tanks around, I think Chile still uses M24 Chaffees, upgraded, of course.  I doubt that M41 is being used as a front-line vehicle, it's gun is too underpowered, it probably serves as reconnaissance or a counter to IFVs."
TankPorn,3441rv,sleepingpie,2,Tue Apr 28 08:52:56 2015 UTC,Yeah I would assume they fill somewhat of an IFv role themselves
TankPorn,3441rv,TouniXVIII,2,Tue Apr 28 15:52:07 2015 UTC,"To be fair, the M32 76mm gun was as far as someone could push the 76mm gun and ammunition. Given the chance it will go through the side and rear of anything in service today, just not the front."

TankPorn,33zx4f,Legogeek14,6,Mon Apr 27 11:32:42 2015 UTC,Stugs are simple in WT. Just aim for the flat bits on the front. Shoot the drivers hatch first (80mm flat armor) and then go around the side.
TankPorn,33zx4f,Cohacq,3,Mon Apr 27 13:31:11 2015 UTC,"They're so compact, as long as you don't shoot the slightly more angled bits, practically anywhere is good enough"

TankPorn,33zx4f,Cohacq,8,Thu May 7 06:46:09 2015 UTC,"That's a Ferdinand, not an Elefant. They were renamed Elefant after they had zimmerit paste and an MG34 fitted for the radio operator, since they lost so many to infantry using magnetic mines on early models.  Fun fact, it's named after Ferdinand Porsche, since he was the principle designer."
TankPorn,33zx4f,HennoGarvie,3,Mon Apr 27 20:52:46 2015 UTC,"I believe the originals were repurposed Porsche tigers, he had a bunch made in preparation and Hitler chose the other Tiger design so Porsche put his excess tank chassis to use."

TankPorn,33zx4f,snailmanteh,1 point,Tue Apr 28 23:40:31 2015 UTC,"IIRC, magnetic mines were only used by the Germans (the zimmerit paste was useless). They must have taken them out with normal AT grenades or satchel charges."

The targets again from left to clockwise read:  Hit the gas canisters  Hit the sight  Hit the turret  Next is showing tank from the back  Eliminate the crew by using the high caliber machine guns  Hit the engine block  Legend below explain the signs:  Arrow: throw a bottle filled with flameable liquid at the slits and screens  Bullseye: Shooting-Machine gun fire to be used on viewing slits and slits between armour  Bullseye with arrow: Use the turrets, anti-tank rifles, anti-tank greandes to hit sides, tower, gas canisters, and engine blocks.   Edit: There were different issues of that booklet. Earliest I can find is from around 1942, another. Museum in Saint-Peterburg has a pretty awesome poster for Tiger.

TankPorn,33y5ff,tijger897,3,Mon Apr 27 11:36:16 2015 UTC,"Because nobody maintains it. They just paint the tanks on the outside, protect the optics, park then in the hagar and leave them to rust.  edit: the suspension is not torison bar but hydro-pneumatic so the system is most likely drained of fluid."
TankPorn,33y5ff,ExplosiveMachine,1 point,Mon Apr 27 13:36:57 2015 UTC,"Yes but the suspention tortiobars dont break randomly.  It is because of wear and tear in the long run? Also the Kubinka museum does maintain tanks. They restore some and have a running t35, t44 and object 268."
TankPorn,33y5ff,tijger897,2,Mon Apr 27 14:29:20 2015 UTC,"Ah here we go. The suspension is not torsion bar but hydro-pneumatic. The system was probably drained so it didn't start leaking.  Well, it can't maintain all of it's tanks, I know that the Object 704 for example is in really bad shape inside but the optics are protected with oil and tape so if it has to be used it still can be."
TankPorn,33y5ff,ExplosiveMachine,1 point,Mon Apr 27 14:55:20 2015 UTC,Ok thank you and yes i know some are in really bad shape.  They won't even restore the maus because it's a German tank :(
TankPorn,33y5ff,tijger897,2,Mon Apr 27 15:08:13 2015 UTC,"No, I'm pretty sure they can't restore the Maus because it would take insane amounts of money to get it to a historical state.   Wargaming decided to help fund it, but even they backed off, because everything missing from inside the tank, so everything, would have to be fabricated anew. The engine, generators, motors, gun, second gun, turret hydraulics, everything made from nothing by blueprints."
TankPorn,33y5ff,ExplosiveMachine,1 point,Mon Apr 27 15:20:28 2015 UTC,Yea true. But maybe one day a billionaire will help restore it!
TankPorn,33y5ff,tijger897,0,Mon Apr 27 16:18:29 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend watching ""Inside the Chieftain's Hatch"" on Youtube. It's a great series that tours the insides of historic AFVs in a great level of detail. Many of the tanks in Kubinka are in a surprisingly decent shape on the interior.  Except for the Maus. No engine, no turret basket, 128mm gun is held in place by a wire, etc. Restoration would be impractically expensive if not impossible. We're lucky to have what we got, since the Germans did a half-assed job of destroying the Maus prototypes."
TankPorn,33y5ff,uggmun,13,Mon Apr 27 19:35:41 2015 UTC,Fun fact!  It was designed to withstand a nuclear shockwave.
TankPorn,33y5ff,Thatcommander,3,Sun Apr 26 20:04:46 2015 UTC,Wasn't it also powered by a nuclear engine? Or at least intended to be powered by one?
TankPorn,33y5ff,GeorgeWShrub,3,Sun Apr 26 21:11:27 2015 UTC,"Is this true? I tried to find examples of a nuke powered tank, but I didn't think any made it off the drawing board."
TankPorn,33y5ff,boulderdrop,2,Mon Apr 27 02:48:50 2015 UTC,Dude idk that's what i was asking. I could've sworn it was this project tank.
TankPorn,33y5ff,GeorgeWShrub,3,Mon Apr 27 03:37:58 2015 UTC,It was only designed to withstand a nuclear blast I'm pretty sure... Back then I doubt the soviets had the technology to build a nuclear reactor small enough to fit in a tank. I doubt they even have the technology now. Even if it were possible though... it'd be the worlds most expensive tank.
TankPorn,33y5ff,GeorgeWShrub,7,Mon Apr 27 04:13:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah that makes sense. There are also some really cool high quality pics of this tank in the museum it's sitting in. It's called the kibinka museum. I know i probably spelled that wrong, it's the one with the maus in it."

TankPorn,33y5ff,MidnightButcher,1 point,Mon Apr 27 07:46:08 2015 UTC,They probably could manage a nuclear powered tank now or in the near future. It probably wouldn't be that practical - would likely need to be very lightweight and big. Remember the Curiosity rover on Mars is powered by a plutonium(?) reactor
TankPorn,33y5ff,hopsafoobar,5,Mon Apr 27 08:41:35 2015 UTC,"No, it's not a reactor, just an RTG. It does not sustain a critical reaction with control rods, cooling fluids and all that jazz, it just uses the warmth from the natural decomposition of plutonium isotopes to power a peltier element. Output is just a few watts."
TankPorn,33y5ff,MidnightButcher,1 point,Mon Apr 27 09:29:43 2015 UTC,"Oh thats right, I had forgotten about the rovers. It's probably entirely possible now then.

TankPorn,33y5ff,I_Literally_EatBears,2,Mon Apr 27 17:33:43 2015 UTC,"Someone else has mentioned it isn't a true nuclear reactor in the rovers.

TankPorn,33oc68,michaelconfoy,4,Fri Apr 24 04:00:35 2015 UTC,"*M4, not M4A3 if I'm not mistaken.   /u/theHIV123, am I wrong?"
TankPorn,33oc68,bardleh,5,Fri Apr 24 08:02:39 2015 UTC,"I agree with you for a couple of reasons.   First the drive sprocket is the ""plain"" type. Different companies had different designs for their sprockets and American Locomotive Company went with a design that was as simple as possible. Now their sprocket could have shown up on a different tank, the sprocket is a high wear part after all, but that it is there strongly suggests this is an M4 built by ALCO.  The second thing that I believe shows it to be an M4 is the air scoop on the back of the tank. If you look at the second guy from the left you can see the air scoop right behind his head. This would not have been something that featured on the M4A3. It didn't have the over heating issues of the M4 or M4A1 and so it didn't require the scoops for cooling.   Also, on Ford M4A3s there were brackets on the turret bustle for mounting and storing the AA machine gun. That those are missing is also a strong indicator that this isn't an M4A3.  I would say that is about all I can see as for features specific to an M4. Looking at the glacis doesn't help because Ford used the same shape on their drivers hoods, and the same type of lifting rings. So that is sort of a wash.  So yeah, I agree with you, good spot!"

TankPorn,33oc68,Mrprocrastinaut,3,Tue Apr 28 12:18:24 2015 UTC,"Well thank you. :)  As for your question: I am lucky in that I work at a museum on weekends that actually has an M4A1E8 (as well as a number of others) and I have spent a lot of time in an around it. We are also producing an informational video about it to display next to the tank and I was the one who did all the research for it.   But beyond that I have just taken a lot of time (and more than a little money) to collect and study information on the M4. I don't know what it is about the M4 that ignites my passion the way it does but there is no other tank out there that has quite the same effect on me.   That said, I have collected some of my favorite online resources on the M4, and other tanks too, in the tankporn wiki:  http://www.reddit.com/r/TankPorn/wiki/booklist"

TankPorn,33iir1,ExplosiveMachine,4,Wed Apr 22 20:15:18 2015 UTC,"A bit of background info (because I love prototypes):  It was a development of the T-28, it mainly focuses on improving the mobility with the new Christie suspension as used on the BT tanks, as well as incorporating a sloped front design, while still retaining T-28's triple-turret design with double machine gun turrets and one big turret housing a 76.2 mm KT-28 cannon.   Also note that the drive system does not use BT's track system, where they have guide teeth every second link, driven by a strange sprocket that engages the teeth, it has normal tracks driven by a sprocket on the rear. It looks like a combination of t-28 and T-34 drivetrain.  This prototype did not, however, lead anywhere. T-34 evolved from the A-20. It still looks cool though."

TankPorn,33dmo9,QuerulousPanda,17,Tue Apr 21 17:51:02 2015 UTC,"Judging by the roadwheels and front mudguards, this could actually be a SD-100. But the SD-100 is just a SU-100 build by licence in Czechoslovakia, so not many differences.  this is definitely a SD-100, because it has T-54's roadwheels, but the one in the picture doesn't, but it still has the late ones.   Here is another confirmed SD-100, but this is an original SU-100. The roadwheel differences are obvious, so are the midguards.  The third difference is a new radio, but we obviously can't see that. And I don't know why I'm even writing this. Just extra info, I guess."

TankPorn,33dmo9,InfiniteApathy,1 point,Wed Apr 22 21:03:46 2015 UTC,"I just went back there today, and spent a bit more time.  I ended up finding a T34, another Sherman, and two crazy looking ampibious landing vehicles I've never seen anything like before.  The APC's were cool, the SPG's were pretty awesome looking, and some of the airplanes were nice too. They have a B52, and I must say, I was actually surprised at how small the B52 was. I mean, it's not tiny, and it was the biggest plane there by far, but I guess considering the power they can carry, I was expecting something far more massive.  The chinese/soviet vehicles were surprisingly small too. I almost couldn't imagine how anyone could even fit in them. The t34 was quite big but the t59, t63, and su100 were all surprisingly dinky, especially compared to the far more massive and imposing feeling american tanks next to them.  Besides that, I thought it was interesting just how complicated all the various machines are, so many little pipes and hoses and bits and pieces. Especially on the SPG's, there are so many little hoses and boxes and things all over the guns and mounts, it's amazing any of it works.   I guess when most of your exposure to tanks and such is through games and photos, it's a whole different ballgame to see one in person. Too bad all of them were closed off, so you couldn't go inside!"
TankPorn,33dmo9,1rankman,1 point,Thu Apr 23 07:20:54 2015 UTC,Did these often stuff the barrel into the ground? Looks like it would take 3 seconds of inattention and one good NJ pothole.

TankPorn,33doap,HanselShotFirst,1 point,Wed Apr 22 05:10:23 2015 UTC,"Yea, loud because of the Diesel engine. You can easily hear them coming. Not like the abrams. Which are surprisingly quiet if you don't know where they are with the Turbine engine. The K1 is an entirely different beast in that aspect. Also they have really neat tank rounds that actually have shells left over unlike the abrams where we just have the (sound like this, not sure of the spelling), halvf-caps. And that suspension looks like a low rider hydraulic system. We'd be sitting there at gunnery with their tank next to us. And all of a sudden I'd notice it was higher, or lower, or the front was up, or the back was up. It was cool."

TankPorn,33dsmj,Paki_Meister_4000,7,Tue Apr 21 18:34:28 2015 UTC,We are also trained that era is very hard for infantry support and us doctrine is typically infantry with the tanks.  I'm a remf though so I could be wrong
TankPorn,33dsmj,beastrabban,14,Tue Apr 21 22:06:58 2015 UTC,"In Russia, it's a one-or-the-other mentality, the T-90 has it everywhere, but beneath it not much armour, so wherever the little blocks go boom boom it has reduced resistance. You could say it's very effective and light, but single-use armour. It can also be easily replenished outside the field, if the tank wasn't knocked out.  The western doctrine focuses on better overall armour for sustained fire, usually composite, that is supposed to be able to take more than a few hits. Cobham armour (on the Abrams and Challenger) is an example. Result is a heavier tank, but one that can take quite a beating before having to be refurbished.  But ERA is still used on western tanks, usually on sideskirts to protect the suspension elements, or on tanks that don't have modern armour, they very often have ERA to extend their service, like this M60, exactly because it's easy to apply, light and works well long enough."

Cobham armour (on the Abrams and Challenger) is an example. Result is a heavier tank, but one that can take quite a beating before having to be refurbished.   Well Siliceous Core (glass) or ceramic armor, still degrade after being hit.   From: Evaluation of Siliceous Cored Armor for the XM60 Tank   After  impacts  with large  caliber  HE  rounds,  siliceous cored armor  will  maintain  protection against  HEAT  rounds  except  in those  areas  directly  damaged  by the  HE  firings. Repaired  castings  will  maintain  high  levels  of  protection  against  HEAT  and  HEP  round  attacks  but  will  suffer  a  loss  of protection  against  kinetic energy  projectile attack.   From: Steel Beasts Manual   The second major drawback of ceramics is that they shatter on impact because the mechanical strength can’t survive the shock waves bouncing off the free tile edges. In tests, the resistance of a shattered steel-ceramic target ranges from 95% vs. AP shots to 80% vs. APFSDS. In addition, test on AP impacts of sloped ceramic-steel targets show that resistance is less than the LOS value, when the slanted resistance of RHA is more   Heavy ERA containers actually stay put even after detonation, providing some form of protection."
TankPorn,33dsmj,LeuCeaMia,1 point,Wed Apr 22 06:09:56 2015 UTC,"That's interesting, of course any armour degrades, but composite still doesn't disintegrate, but apparently the new Kontakt doesn't either. Thanks for the links!"
TankPorn,33dsmj,ExplosiveMachine,2,Wed Apr 22 07:15:50 2015 UTC,"I knew someone would bring the M60 up, but I didn't know how to get my point across, I know how I should have said something like main battle tanks.  Why do they still use the M60 anyway?"
TankPorn,33dsmj,ExplosiveMachine,10,Tue Apr 21 21:36:22 2015 UTC,"because it works, it has a gun that can fire modern amunnition, and there are lots of them left over. You don't just throw away tanks when you need them.  Also I think those M60s were deployed as special vehicles, with their dozer blades and all, not as frontline vehicles."
TankPorn,33dsmj,stahp_tank,4,Tue Apr 21 21:43:26 2015 UTC,"I think they were used in the 1991 gulf war, and that's the last time the M60 was used by the US military"
TankPorn,33dsmj,1d8,2,Tue Apr 21 22:18:23 2015 UTC,they were used in the gulf war by the usmc as that was still their mbt at the time

TankPorn,33dsmj,Panda_Cavalry,2,Wed Apr 22 05:32:09 2015 UTC,"Ohhh ok, you make so much sense. Tagged you as sense man because sensible doesn't work."
TankPorn,33dsmj,Panda_Cavalry,6,Tue Apr 21 22:02:11 2015 UTC,"Well, it's not like they don't use ERA.   However, I suspect the reason countries like the US and Germany haven't yet covered their MBTs of choice of bricks ala T-90 is because ERA is a one-time use sort of thing - however effective it may be against a single hit, it gets used up and is ineffective against a second consecutive hit in the same place. Since NATO likes to keep their tank crews (relatively) safe, composites like Chobham and Dorchester are a better (if more expensive) option for extended frontline stays.   As with the Challenger 2 above, though, sometimes having both doesn't hurt."
TankPorn,33dsmj,MarsMJD,2,Tue Apr 21 19:07:25 2015 UTC,"Hmm, wouldn't both all those armours stuck together just make a huge piggy bank then? Not really worth the dosh?"
TankPorn,33dsmj,Mrprocrastinaut,1 point,Tue Apr 21 21:34:09 2015 UTC,"As far as I can tell, ERA on NATO tanks is used mostly to augment areas of thinner armour, where having an additional layer of protection is helpful. The Challenger 2, for instance, concentrates its ERA package along its sides and the lower hull.   Especially handy in the event of ambush or IEDs containing explosively-formed penetrators, although sometimes, even ERA won't stop a tandem HEAT charge."
TankPorn,33dsmj,LeuCeaMia,2,Wed Apr 22 08:35:05 2015 UTC,Canadian Leopards 2A6's are often equipped with them. I saw one with ERA while it was being shown off to the public at the Calgary stampede. It plated onto the side and rear of the body and on the sides of the turret iirc.

Such as when you are changing from primary to secondary battle positions, or when you're crossing a large danger area such as an open valley. It's also used to conceal the tank's position when being engaged in order to move to a safer point."
TankPorn,33e055,SapperBomb,1 point,Wed Apr 22 05:38:25 2015 UTC,The smoke launchers on tanks are used specifically when a tank needs to withdraw quickly. They pop the smoke and it creates a 100 meter smoke screen directly in front of the tank so it can withdraw backwards

TankPorn,33boxi,killswitch247,3,Tue Apr 21 10:48:50 2015 UTC,the difference is that the german design uses just a fraction of the rubber that the m3 uses. that's the same reason as for the schachtellaufwerk of the tiger and panther tanks.
TankPorn,33boxi,Mrprocrastinaut,3,Tue Apr 21 19:21:40 2015 UTC,"No, the overlapping roadwheels are there to more evenly spread the ground pressure across the tracks. You're thinking of the resilient road wheels (steel tyred) present on late Tigers."

TankPorn,33b9i3,metro654,1 point,Mon Apr 27 18:51:13 2015 UTC,"The gunner more than likely sits in a position straight below where he'd normally sit in the turret. To be completely honest, unless the entire turret now belongs to the autoloader which seems insane considering the other designs out there, I see no reason why crew can't still be in it."
TankPorn,33b9i3,TouniXVIII,2,Tue Apr 21 19:21:45 2015 UTC,Yea that makes sense. The question is weather or not he's in the turret solo or not. That would be pretty lonely. Then again the sight (or the sight like object) looks like it's more centrally mounted which could indicate that the gunner is centered in the turret.
TankPorn,33b9i3,Mak_i_Am,4,Tue Apr 21 20:23:00 2015 UTC,"I think the gunner sits between the commander and the driver. It's hard to see in this image, but here you can see that there is a single viewing prism in the middle: https://i.imgur.com/YMpyX8n.jpg"
TankPorn,33b9i3,henbruas,1 point,Tue Apr 21 20:45:14 2015 UTC,"I saw that earlier, but that would make no sense to just have that one vision prism for the gunner as back-up. It would make more sense to give him a true back-up sight coming through that upper plate just below it."

Seems more logical that he would have 3 and the gunner would have 1, the gunner views the surroundings through the sight anyway.  Additionally, if you watch images from previous May parades, you will see that the standard is the commander standing and saluting and the driver sitting with his head out of the hatch, while the gunner is not visible."

TankPorn,339bqn,TheHIV123,6,Mon Apr 20 18:11:18 2015 UTC,"From what I've been able to find, the turret was cramped beyond all belief, but the reason the turret even had enough space to fit the breach of the cannon and have enough empty space for the recoil was due to the extended turret bustle that was added for the Firefly in the first place.  The gun was also shortened from 57 calibers to 44 calibers, a new muzzle brake installed, and the cartridges, originally designed for the 105mm F1 gun, shortened. The decision was also made to use HEAT rounds instead of KE rounds to help dampen the recoil even more. In fact, the Argentinian version of the CN-105 L/44 was very similar to the Israeli version."
TankPorn,339bqn,TouniXVIII,3,Mon Apr 20 22:07:10 2015 UTC,"The decision was also made to use HEAT rounds instead of KE rounds to help dampen the recoil even more.

Also the Ausf A. came after the Ausf D, it isn't alphabetical. It's the Ausf D, which has a drum with vision slits cut out of it as a cupola."
TankPorn,3362ya,LeuCeaMia,3,Tue Apr 21 10:05:49 2015 UTC,"Panther D was the initial production panther that went to Kursk, it does not have a hull MG ball. It's most likely a Panther A because of the improved turret, ball MG, and no chin on the gun mantlet."

TankPorn,3362ya,ltsReno,2,Mon Apr 20 12:51:16 2015 UTC,Generally speaking the German tankers had become very adept at hiding in the Normandy boccage and taking out Sherman tanks before being seen. This led to a lot of American tankers saying they were killed by a Tiger they couldn't see when in reality it was probably a Panzer 4 or maybe a Panther because most of the Tigers were fighting in the East.
TankPorn,3362ya,Darneil,1 point,Mon Apr 20 16:37:35 2015 UTC,A Panther would probably be reported as a Tiger II though?
TankPorn,3362ya,henbruas,2,Mon Apr 20 15:41:29 2015 UTC,"More like the opposite since the Panther predates the Tiger Ausf. B by a year.   Oskin reported that he and his crew knocked out 3 Panthers.

TankPorn,3362ya,LeuCeaMia,4,Tue Apr 21 10:18:55 2015 UTC,"From Normandy to VE day there are only three verifiable instances where the US actually encountered a Tiger 1.  There weren't a lot of Tigers by the time the US landed in France, and they were all concentrated in the British sector, but everything was always reported as a, ""Tiger.""   This even lead to the myth that a Super Pershing squared off against a King Tiger. Except that the closest German heavy armored division was over 80 miles away from where it would have occurred. Maybe the Germans had a teleporter?"

TankPorn,331m5q,CybranM,3,Sun Apr 19 02:16:26 2015 UTC,I wanted to see a T34 as well to see if its famed cross country capability stood up to testing.
TankPorn,331m5q,Flaxabiten,6,Sun Apr 19 13:55:14 2015 UTC,Awesome video! I was unaware the Sherman had so many failings from a cross-country POV. Or that the Panther was so good.
TankPorn,331m5q,Peli-kan,2,Sun Apr 19 03:40:40 2015 UTC,"Well most of the sherman's problems were eliminated with the arrival of the horizontal volute spring suspension (like on the M4A3E8), which used almost double-width tracks. In the video the Firefly is shown which still has the old narrow suspension design, the new one improved the mobility of late shermans by a lot. Another solution were additional grousers fitted on the outside that increased the track width.  normal vertical volute spring | model with additional grousers | horizontal volute spring with steel tracks  The panther really is the best in this regard (and was pretty much the best tank produced during WW2), shame the same can't be said for it's final drives which completely disabled it when lots of torque was needed. I think it was because of sprocket designs, sherman used double ones (whatever the technical name is) which were much stronger than the panther's single design which was very prone to breaking."
TankPorn,331m5q,ExplosiveMachine,1 point,Sun Apr 19 09:45:54 2015 UTC,"So if they had fixed the sprocket, do you think the Panther would have lost most of it reputation of being unreliable?"
TankPorn,331m5q,Cohacq,6,Sun Apr 19 19:09:25 2015 UTC,"There are many other breakdowns, but those are common on all tanks, the final drive is exclusive to the Panther, so Very likely. A final drive or transmission failure takes out the tank, or rather, turns it into field artillery since it can't move. Therefore it has to be repaired.  Thing is, the sherman had a bolted-on front panel that, in the result of a transmission breakdown could be just unbolted and the whole thing fell out forwards. Bam. Done. The Panther had a solid plate and the transmission had to be accessed through different means like lifting it through the top.  That would be fine if the transmission didn't have to be fixed, but it was so overly-armoured (because nothing satisfied Hitler) while retaining it's designed-for-lighter-loads final drives and transmission, that tended to break, a lot. Like, a lot.  Not only that. Panther was capable of neutral-steer (when both tracks turn in opposite directions), and it's insane engine could actually get it up and moving to very good speeds. However, due to the unreliability of the final drives and gearbox in general (although mostly final drives), it was advised that it should never be put in the last gear on roads or drive above certain speeds on rough terrain.  Many people say that the Panther was over-engineered. It wasn't. It was complex, sure, but the original design would operate fine. Thing is, they stuck so much armour on it while not stepping up the robustness of the mechanics that it just didn't work properly. And a tank that can't move is bound to get a bad reputation.  edit: Thank you kind fellow tank enthusiast! Much appreciated."
TankPorn,331m5q,ExplosiveMachine,1 point,Sun Apr 19 19:20:09 2015 UTC,Another reason was that parts of all kinds were low quality and in short supply when the Panther was produced  (late war). Allied bombing was partly to blame.

TankPorn,330rbb,FoxtrotZero,2,Sat Apr 18 16:17:09 2015 UTC,"I'm no expert, but broadly speaking, I'd say it seems like a lot of it is pointing up, or at least at a 45 degree angle. You normally don't expect anti-tank fire to come from a much different elevation than yours."
TankPorn,330rbb,Peabush,2,Sat Apr 18 17:45:22 2015 UTC,You don't suppose it is to avoid incidents where dismounts would get hit by fragments if it was struck? But the angles are no different to your average T tank.
TankPorn,330rbb,FoxtrotZero,1 point,Sat Apr 18 20:48:16 2015 UTC,"Right, but they don't deflect, so the angle is really only a question of ""where you're trying to block fire from"".  You might be right. Having the armour pointed up like that would possibly help protect infantry, but honestly, the concussive force alone would be good reason to keep your distance from a tank."
TankPorn,330rbb,Peabush,1 point,Sat Apr 18 21:14:38 2015 UTC,I am not thinking of deflection. But the fragments from the era blocks that go boom if it is hit. Also the armor is thicker if at an angle. So there is that.
TankPorn,330rbb,FoxtrotZero,1 point,Sun Apr 19 08:02:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I don't know how much shrapnel these things put out. You will have a disintegrated shell to deal with. Either way, I don't know if it's ever a good idea to be operating so closely to tanks (though I think the Military does a lot of things that aren't ""good ideas"", like running towards people who are trying to kill you, so sometimes it just has to happen)."
TankPorn,330rbb,wikingwarrior,2,Sun Apr 19 16:44:23 2015 UTC,"If it's at a far enough distance I suppose it would, sort of like the ships at Jutland. Also in Urban Combat against RPG (the biggest reason to use ERA) it seems reasonable to me. If I were to ambush a tank, you'd bet your ass I'd use plunging fire if I could.  Besides shit is light, throw it on wherever."
TankPorn,330rbb,FoxtrotZero,1 point,Sat Apr 18 18:05:55 2015 UTC,"Well if I wanted to prevent against RPG fire from building tops, seeing as how they're HEAT projectiles, I'd go with some sort of mesh/grille material like they're using in all of the TUSK kits.  I'm not saying it's a bad layout. It looks like it'll give you a decent chance of intercepting a projectile regardless of where it's coming from (though you have to admit, the top of the turret where the thin armour and the hatches are all, as well as the engine deck, constitute a much larger target where aircraft is concerned).  I'm also not familiar with the exact conditions they're dealing with. Given that they're plowing through sand berms, it might be that they're expecting to deal with enemy contacts at varying elevations."
TankPorn,330rbb,SmokeyUnicycle,3,Sat Apr 18 18:35:26 2015 UTC,"seeing as how they're HEAT projectiles,   You do realize this is light ERA, right?"
TankPorn,330rbb,FoxtrotZero,1 point,Sat Apr 18 19:45:48 2015 UTC,"I'm not entirely sure what you're getting at. Yeah, it's ERA. Yeah, it'll stop a HEAT round (unless you're... trying to tell me it won't?). But if that was expressly the threat you're trying to protect against (which was /u/wikingwarrior's proposed reason for the high angle), then some sort of mesh or grille would be cheaper and allow for better coverage."
TankPorn,330rbb,CoolGuy54,1 point,Sat Apr 18 20:32:36 2015 UTC,Isn't ERA lighter than a grille?
TankPorn,330rbb,wikingwarrior,1 point,Sun Apr 19 02:06:48 2015 UTC,Well they didn't use the mesh/grille in Desert Storm so I assume that ERA was the avaliable alternative (I'm assuming this is desert storm).
TankPorn,330rbb,orthag,2,Sun Apr 19 01:52:09 2015 UTC,"Angled armor works better, though. The point is it deflects the round up and away from the tank."
TankPorn,330rbb,FoxtrotZero,3,Sat Apr 18 18:10:16 2015 UTC,"Depends on the projectile you're dealing with. With WWII era-style solid cored projectiles (which were basically giant bullets) and HEAT shells, then yes, that's a possibility. With modern discarding-sabot kinetic penetrators, deflection isn't really intended, or as big of a thing. They're designed to put as much force as possible in as small an area as possible, and if they don't find purchase, they'll just kinda obliterate themselves.  That's why modern tanks have armour layouts with big slab sides instead of steep angles and curves: They're not designed to deflect, they're designed to have as much of that kinetic energy as possible be absorbed by the composite armour (the primary component of which is special-made ceramic plates that absorb that energy by fracturing).  You're also forgetting, though: those aren't just add-on plates. If they were, they'd be abso-fucking-lutely useless against any meaningful projectile (I guess they could make HEAT shells detonate early, but that's not a very good layout for that). It's explosive reactive armour. When it gets hit, it's going to explode, stopping and/or destroying the projectile with it. Deflection doesn't even enter into the equation."
TankPorn,330rbb,CoolGuy54,1 point,Sat Apr 18 18:31:38 2015 UTC,"I thought ERA wasn't much good against Kinetics?  ...  Wikipedia says ""To be effective against kinetic energy projectiles, ERA must use much thicker and heavier plates and a correspondingly thicker explosive layer. ""  These look thin to me? Dunno, out of my depth."
TankPorn,330rbb,LeuCeaMia,1 point,Sun Apr 19 02:10:07 2015 UTC,ERA works best sloped so that it not only disrupts the HEAT jet but also forces it to cut a slot rather than a hole through the armour plates fed into it.

The Iraqi forces were thought to be much better than they were and I think they were pretty much putting it wherever they could.  Better safe than sorry.    Also, the M60 dozer tanks were just monsters that would never die."
TankPorn,330rbb,itstanktime,2,Sat Apr 18 16:21:33 2015 UTC,"The majority of modern anti tank missiles go up and then come down on the target.   The turret and front slope of an M60 have a really good slope that is excellent at deflecting rounds so missiles and heat rounds (that have a high trajectory) are going to be what you want to protect against.   Also, the plate seem to be focused on critical systems, such as the driver, crew, gun trunions, turret ring and ammunition."

Edit: Reason I say so is that if that was a deflection off of anything hard, like another hulk, or a building it would mangle the shit out of the penetrator. Heck, even most ground strikes whup the crap out of them if you get the chance to find one on a plywood target range. If that was still straight when it hit sideways, it absolutely hit soft dirt and bounced. And man let me tell you, tank rounds bounce like freaking crazy when they hit the ground going down range. I've seen inert training HEAT projectiles bounce 3 or 4 times. It's like skipping rocks on the water, except they go so fast and have so much kinetic energy they will skip right off the ground."

Which is a ""target practice cone stabilized discarding sabot with tracer."" More commonly known as a training sabot round, it's made of steel, and designed to fall out of the sky a long time before the service penetrators would. The real ones are much longer, and made out of depleted uranium or tungsten which makes them much more expensive and impractical for training. You know, that and the whole DU being a lil radioactive thing if you're an American tanker.   That's a very interesting hit though. It must have bounced off a berm, or the ground near the target hulk, and slammed into it sideways. If that was a plywood gunnery target that's a hit as far as the tower is concerned."

This projectile imprint shows it extremely intact. It's almost a perfect imprint. If the penetrator hit anything real hard like armor it would not come out so intact.   It was likely travelling sideways when this happened. Like a belly flop   https://www.reddit.com/r/MilitaryGfys/comments/2mzg2o/m1a1_loading_and_firing_m865_tpcsdst_rounds/cm8xkgh  if you check out this guys post, and look at our imprint. you can see that the round looks short.

Apparently, the local military command got wind of this, and it kind of escalated an already tense situation a bit when the next day, he was picked up from school by GIs in a Jeep and two tanks, which escorted him to his school and made sure he could ""pass the border safely"".

TankPorn,32syl6,Terrh,15,Thu Apr 16 13:59:53 2015 UTC,"Armor and gun wise the T-55. Technology, crew, range finding and gunnery the M48. Overall? Its a toss up. IMO the M48 but I'm a fanboy of America tonks."
TankPorn,32syl6,Hambeggar,27,Thu Apr 16 14:08:18 2015 UTC,"Of course at point blank range, all that really matters is who fires first"
TankPorn,32syl6,LeuCeaMia,10,Thu Apr 16 15:02:02 2015 UTC,"armor and gun still matters, but both of those tanks could likely pen the hull of the other at that range so yeah, I think you're right."
TankPorn,32syl6,0000013,8,Thu Apr 16 16:14:36 2015 UTC,"At that time (by 1961) armour did not matter. This was around the time where HEAT shells were being heavily developed. As early as ~1958, the D-10T (main gun on T54/55) were capable of firing HEAT shells which were able to penetrate ~280mm RHA. By 1961 they were firing HEAT capable of ~380mm penetration. (BK-5 and BK-5M)  HEAT does not suffer from range either. It has the same penetration at all ranges since it relies on ""chemical force"" and not kinetic force.  This is why the Leopard 1 was developed with such little armour. The ammunition being thrown around was so devastating to armour, that there simply was no point in the additional weight."
TankPorn,32syl6,Hambeggar,1 point,Thu Apr 16 20:19:31 2015 UTC,HEAT however does suffer from failing to fuse if the armour is too steeply angled.   90 mm M431 HEAT fails to fuse at a combined angle of 60 + 20 degrees (equivalent to 62 degrees).
TankPorn,32syl6,0000013,1 point,Fri Apr 17 05:11:55 2015 UTC,"HEAT efficiency does not rely in impact speed yes, but the thing with range is that the lower your round velocity, the higher the arc and the longer the lead required for a moving target, which means that even though you have the same penetration from 2 miles than from 200 meters, the tricky thing is to get the initial HIT that the penetration is to the enemy, not to the bunnies running around."
TankPorn,32syl6,Hambeggar,1 point,Fri Apr 17 09:56:10 2015 UTC,Good thing by the 60s HEAT was able to hit speeds of 950m/s+ due to better fuses.
TankPorn,32syl6,rosecenter,1 point,Fri Apr 17 10:40:31 2015 UTC,"Still halfway compared to KE rounds, meaning that your trajectory is gonna be a ton higher, and range estimation has to be much more precise to hit the target."
TankPorn,32syl6,burgerbob22,1 point,Fri Apr 17 14:37:19 2015 UTC,But KE rounds at great distance that you're talking about would be ineffective since they lost most of their energy by the time they connect.
TankPorn,32syl6,Hetzer,-4,Fri Apr 17 15:01:01 2015 UTC,armor and gun still matters   I think the Nazi Panther agrees with you.
TankPorn,32syl6,LeuCeaMia,2,Thu Apr 16 22:16:47 2015 UTC,What?
TankPorn,32syl6,Zekkystyle,0,Fri Apr 17 02:59:24 2015 UTC,I'm talking about normal combat range. Here your right. If someone did miss at this range the M48 would have the advantage as its turret was more spacious and the 90mm AT rounds easier to move being slightly lighter and shorter than the T-55s 100mm.
TankPorn,32syl6,CWinter85,5,Thu Apr 16 16:52:40 2015 UTC,"I think it would depend on if it's a variant of the M48 that has the L7 105mm.  If it did, the victor is probably just whoever shot first."
TankPorn,32syl6,bardleh,3,Thu Apr 16 14:16:09 2015 UTC,"This is a 90mm version. The L7 wasn't accepted till the 70s to bring it up to speed with the M60A1 and A3. Personally that tank, the M48A5 was vastly superior to the T-55 AND the T-62 in my opinion."
TankPorn,32syl6,metro654,2,Thu Apr 16 16:48:10 2015 UTC,Although by the time the M48A5 was first accepted the T-72 Ural was already in production. Still the M48A5 better be better than the T-62 model 1962; it's more than a decade younger.  The US Army Material Systems Analysis Agency did feature the M60A1 and T-62 in its tank quality graph for Major General (ret. as General) Paul F. Gorman's Paper.

TankPorn,32syl6,BanditMcDougal,1 point,Fri Apr 17 07:11:14 2015 UTC,I believe that came down to the Egyptian use of ATGM more than their actual tank on tank warfare. Besides at that point the M48 was more than 20 years old.

TankPorn,32t3u0,LeuCeaMia,1 point,Fri Apr 17 04:55:42 2015 UTC,"The leopard and challenger store some ammo in the hull, but most is stored in a bustle aswell from what I have heard. The ammo in the hulls of these tanks is really just reserves. Also another example would be the merkava."
TankPorn,32t3u0,rangamatchstick,5,Fri Apr 17 05:52:32 2015 UTC,"Look at Leopard 2's rack, that's 27 rounds only 15 are in the turret with the rest of the space taken up by the turret drive. It even takes up the entire height of the hull so a penetrating round is either going through it or the driver.  While the Challenger stores the propellant charges and HESH below the turret ring in the fighting compartment with only APFSDS in the bustle."
TankPorn,32t3u0,LeuCeaMia,-2,Fri Apr 17 05:59:05 2015 UTC,wow.....how the fuck did knowone learn from WW2 internal detonations and soviet tanks going up like firecrackers!
TankPorn,32t3u0,rangamatchstick,4,Fri Apr 17 06:24:27 2015 UTC,"Ammo is heavy, large, and you have to carry a lot of it on the tank. Further, the hull is basically a dead-shot anyway: the glacis plate is the strongest point, hull side the weakest by far in comparison to the size of the target.  so base philosophy for the tank goes that if  enemy has your hull side on their sights with 90 degree angle, then its not the fault of the tank youre dead, its the fault of the crew. trying to fit entire ammo rack inside protection and blow-off panels means you either have ridiculously large turret, comparably limited ammo onboard or storing the reserve ammo somewhere that you cannot reach without getting out of the tank."
TankPorn,32t3u0,0000013,1 point,Fri Apr 17 17:23:13 2015 UTC,"I completely agree, what about external stores on armour bustles on the rear of the turret? Also on a typical mission how many rounds would a tank use?"
TankPorn,32t3u0,rangamatchstick,2,Sat Apr 18 04:57:23 2015 UTC,"external stores means getting off the tank to reload and making the turret longer. longer turret means more overhang, harder time traversing turret in cramped spaces (forests) et cetera et cetera.  as for how many rounds a tank will use on a ""mission"" depends very heavily on the use of the tank. Fulda Gap and policing Baghdad had totally different ammunition requirements, so there is no ""typical mission"" at the moment"

TankPorn,32mnbf,TouniXVIII,4,Wed Apr 15 00:32:45 2015 UTC,"Swingfire was a British wire-guided anti-tank missile developed in the 1960s and produced from 1966 until 1993.  The name comes from the ability of the missile to make a rapid turn of up to ninety degrees after firing to bring it onto the line of the sighting mechanism. This means that the launcher vehicle could be concealed and the operator, using a portable sight, placed at a distance in a more advantageous firing position.  After a lengthy debate, the Swingfire was replaced with the Javelin in mid-2005 to meet new and changing situational requirements. The British Army invested heavily in the Javelin, and it is now the main heavy anti-tank missile system in use by the British Army.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swingfire"

In fact, the very gun the KPZ-70 was armed with eventually came into service with those exact tanks."
TankPorn,32kxt0,R-J-B,3,Tue Apr 14 17:57:33 2015 UTC,What all armor did it have and how maneuverable was it
TankPorn,32kxt0,FoxtrotZero,11,Tue Apr 14 18:07:41 2015 UTC,"http://i.imgur.com/5UgSIvL.jpg - Armor Layout  The armor was quite thick and was able to withstand any and all HEAT rounds in service at the time due to the layering of laminate and steel plates as well as able to reliably prevent 105mm APDS rounds from the L7 guns from penetrating it. It also incorporated a lot of dead space due to the entirety of the crew being situated in the turret, including the driver. The reasoning for this is due to the fact that both the US and Germany realized that while APDS rounds were still a threat, the main threat came from higher penetration and more lethal HEAT rounds which exploded in popularity after the Second World War.  It boasted a 1,500 HP engine allowing it to go around 69 km/h both forward and in reverse and do so quickly with a hp/t ratio of around 29.82. Even running at these blistering speeds, the hydropneumatic suspension, which was also fully adjustable in terms of height like that of the S-Tank, kept the ride smooth as silk for the crew, even while going over obstacles.  http://s47.photobucket.com/user/Rhinofex/media/MBT70peak.jpg.html - Example of the adjustable suspension  http://vpk.name/file/img/MBT-70_NII_Stali.jpg - Obstacle test of an American MBT-70"
TankPorn,32kxt0,AdwokatDiabel,2,Tue Apr 14 18:24:50 2015 UTC,Is there a reason that sort of hydropneumatic suspension isn't in service with current MBTs?
TankPorn,32kxt0,AdwokatDiabel,3,Wed Apr 15 04:55:30 2015 UTC,"Actually, the AMX Leclerc, Challenger 2, and the Type 10 all have a hydropneumatic suspension. It just all depends on the designer of the tank, if the army in question feels the need to put in such a feature, and if it's worth the extra cost and maintenance."
TankPorn,32kxt0,BeondTheGrave,5,Wed Apr 15 07:37:44 2015 UTC,This tank would've been much more successful if they ditched the gun-missile system...
TankPorn,32kxt0,AdwokatDiabel,7,Tue Apr 14 19:03:18 2015 UTC,"That's debatable. While it's true that the extended XM-150 gun/launcher was as problematic as the M81 gun/launcher, it was still highly accurate and, due to it's increased length, was now capable of firing more types of rounds, such as APDS. One of the main problems with it wasn't so much the gun as it was the autoloading system which tended to deform the caseless ammunition.  In the end, it was cost that killed it, not the underlying problems with the gun."
TankPorn,32kxt0,FoxtrotZero,-2,Tue Apr 14 19:52:58 2015 UTC,"But the underlying costs were due to problems with the gun and autoloader system.  If they just used the 120MM Smoothbore, it would've been much better off.  The projectiles and cases were much more durable than the ammo used in the XM-150."
TankPorn,32kxt0,FreeUsernameInBox,6,Tue Apr 14 19:59:29 2015 UTC,"This isnt exactly true. The Shillelagh was expensive, but so too were the TV cameras (every crew station had one), the advanced armor, the sophisticated targeting computer and sensor suite, the hydropneumatic suspension, and all the other crazy features they gave the tank. Ultimately the tank was supposed to cost $1.2 million each in 1970 dollars, which was almost twice what the designers had originally planned.  Plus the Germans were pissed that the thing weighed so much. They wanted to ditch some armor thickness to make it weigh less, and the Americans were simply unable to also accept that."
TankPorn,32kxt0,BeondTheGrave,4,Tue Apr 14 20:48:22 2015 UTC,"Again, not entirely. The American and German designers argued about every little detail involving the project. One of the largest cost jumps was due to the adoption of both standards of measurement (Metric and SAE). Then there was also the problem that the weight had grown to the point that the tank needed it's own ARV and bridge layer, which added onto the cost, as well as the problem of switching from the original gas turbine to a normal piston-driven engine in the American prototypes."
TankPorn,32kxt0,RazgrizS57,4,Tue Apr 14 20:04:10 2015 UTC,"Ahh, I forgot about the measurements part!  So stupid the US wanted to stick with SAE!"
TankPorn,32kxt0,BeondTheGrave,1 point,Tue Apr 14 20:10:15 2015 UTC,"Why did the Americans switch to a piston engine, and then go on to include a turbine in the Abrams?"
TankPorn,32kxt0,n23_,3,Wed Apr 15 04:57:52 2015 UTC,The piston engine switch in the MBT-70 prototype was due to the fact that the tank was kicking up so much dust that it was clogging the intakes. The majority of the M1 Abrams was built around it's turbine powerplant and made in such a way that the intakes wouldn't become clogged from the dust it was kicking up after the lessons learned from the MBT-70.  One could also say us Americans are stubborn as well.

TankPorn,32fj6x,TankerD18,8,Mon Apr 13 12:53:01 2015 UTC,"All IFVs are meant to handle urban combat where the MBTs fall short. The IFVs are usually designed to compensate for their respective tank's weaknesses like the length of the gun tube, and the inability to elevate the main gun to roof level. Auto-cannons are compact and easy to elevate high up. Then you have the pack of angry dudes in the back who will go mess up anything that comes from any building."
TankPorn,32fj6x,hopsafoobar,8,Mon Apr 13 14:13:59 2015 UTC,"But this thing goes way further than an IFW, it doesn't carry any troops, it's just a gun carrier! I wonder what tactics they envision for it and how it's supposed to be better than a normal IFW. The Russians do have one of those, right?"
TankPorn,32fj6x,TankerD18,6,Mon Apr 13 14:17:52 2015 UTC,"Reading into a bit, it's on a T-72 chassis. So yeah that's more like a lightly gunned tank than a BMP. That'd still be hard to defeat short of a main gun round or a RPG/ATGM hit.   Ohh, and the Russians/Soviets have(had) the BTR series of wheeled IFVs too."
TankPorn,32fj6x,TankerD18,2,Mon Apr 13 14:26:39 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. The BMP and BMD 1-3 are all IFVs that carry troops. As a weapon platform like this I could see it being used as a scout vehicle like scout Bradleys, or as a mechanized infantry support system, kind of like the Stryker MGS, but with missiles and dual autocannons instead of a remote controlled tank gun."
TankPorn,32fj6x,eighthgear,1 point,Mon Apr 13 14:20:27 2015 UTC,"I know that SPAAGs (self-propelled anti-aircraft guns) like the Shilka have proven useful in urban combat, thanks to their high rate-of-fire and gun elevation. However, SPAAGs tend to have paper-thin armour.  The BMPT, on the other hand, has similar if not superior protection to a T-90 tank and turret is unmanned.  It sort of reminds me of interwar tanks, many of which were armed with machine-guns rather than large-calibre cannons. That wasn't that great of an idea back then, but nowadays, I can definitely see tanks that are armed with autocannons being quite useful in urban combat."

TankPorn,32e3de,anemonian,17,Mon Apr 13 01:04:21 2015 UTC,"Of course, this sort of thing isn't a common sight in most of Japan, where the 50t Type 90 breaks all sorts of laws (and roads). But the northernmost island of Hokkaido is home to the 7th Division, the Ground Self-Defence Forces' only armoured division - with a core striking force comprised of three full regiments of cutting-edge Type 90s, well supported by a regiment of Type 99 155mm howitzers, another regiment of integrated air defence assets, an infantry regiment, an independent recce battalion and a helicopter squadron (amongst many other things), the 7th Division is considered to be the single best armed and equipped division in the GSDF. But then, that's not too surprising - since its official formation in 1962 with the creation of the GSDF's 13 divisional system, the 7th Division has been at the core of the ground forces that would be the first to fight any potential invasion of the Japanese mainland from the north by the Russians.  What that means is that, on occasion, folks up north will see something that you'll be hard pressed to see on any of the other islands of Japan - columns and columns of Japan's heaviest armoured vehicles trundling from Point A to Point B along public roads. And the heaviest of them all, of course, is the formidable Type 90 tank seen here - more than capable of fighting off hordes of T-72s, but as powerless as any law-abiding vehicle in front of a red light (apparently)."
TankPorn,32e3de,Karmago,5,Mon Apr 13 01:14:25 2015 UTC,"Thank you, that was very informative. Do you know anything about the new Type 10 MBT and how it will be integrated into the JGSDF?  Being that the Type 10 is lighter and designed for more urban combat, will other divisions receive them in bulk as well outside of Hokkaido?"
TankPorn,32e3de,heavyindustry,19,Mon Apr 13 02:12:06 2015 UTC,"The Type 10's a bit tricky - since the 2000s, when the tank force for the future was supposed to consist of 600-odd vehicles, half in Hokkaido (mostly Type 90s, some Type 10s) and half elsewhere (Types 10s), two successive governments cut the prospective tank force rather savagely.   The first cut occurred when the DPJ came to power in 2009 - one of the decisions they promptly made within a year was to cut the tank force by 200 vehicles, doubtlessly influenced by the burgeoning financial crisis and their electoral mandate to do something about it.   The second cut, oddly enough, occurred under the somewhat more security-focused and nationalist revisionist LDP government that was brought into power December 2012. As we all know, the Abe government's made a big show of shifting Japan's security focus south, towards its outlying islands and growing Chinese military power - in line with that, they cut the plans for the future tank force from the DPJ's 400 tanks to an even more miniscule 300. Given that the GSDF tank force in 2013 (when they announced this) was 760 vehicles strong, that's a rather steep cut. It's also doubly odd because the new GSDF plans drawn up in 2013 call for 600 tanks in the future force, which could be taken at face value as a reversal of the DPJ's initial cuts.  The core reason for this 100 vehicle cut has to do with some creative renaming that's alleged to have occurred after the Ministry of Finance put pressure on the MoD to cut their growing budget. From 2007 onwards, the Japanese had been developing a 105mm armed 8x8 (the MCV) - intended as an infantry support vehicle, it was supposed to be attached to the mechanised infantry. But instead, the decision was made that, should the MCV be treated as a 'tank' for budgetary reasons (instead of an infantry support vehicle), the GSDF could still be equipped with 600 'tanks' in the future, while still cutting the actual tank force by some 100 tanks. So, from 340 Type 90s, 370 Type 74s and 50 Type 10s in 2013, the GSDF tank force of the future will probably look a bit more like this:   200+ 8x8 Manoeuvre Combat Vehicles: to fill the gaps left by the Type 74's retirement on Honshu. ~200 Type 90s: Down from the current 340 to meet the GSDF requirement for 300 tanks, most likely. These will stay in Hokkaido, as they're not really useable anywhere else. ~100 Type 10s: As with most Japanese tanks, the first Type 10s were assigned to the Fuji School and the 1st Armoured Instruction Group. From there, 13 tanks were assigned to a company of the 1st Tank Battalion as part of the capital area's defence forces. The 2nd Tank Regiment (2nd Division) up in Hokkaido was equipped with Type 10s, but that's because the 2nd Division's been nominated as the testbed division for the development and implementation of the GSDF's prospective new C4ISR architecture. It's not a permanent deployment, and Type 10s won't be deployed in Hokkaido in the long term - minus the instruction and capital area tanks, it's likely that the rest will all be deployed in and around Kyushu (the 2nd Division's tanks will likely be shifted south once they're relieved of their C4ISR testbed role). I've heard talk of a tank group directly under the command of the Western Army, but for now initial deployment of the Type 10 in Kyushu is with the 8th Tank Regiment (8th Division).   Hope that helps. JGSDF planning has been a mess for the better part of a decade, alas - too many administrations!   E: The Type 10 being designed for urban combat is, well, an urban myth - during the latter stages of its development, the big craze became fighting guerillas and landing forces along Honshu and Kyushu, so they bigged up the Type 10's supposed guerilla-fighting capabilities to secure funding. In reality, the infantry support/guerilla engagement role was meant to be the realm of the MCV (hence its being directly attached to the infantry) - the Type 10 is a little too expensive and a little too capable to be used as an infantry fighting tool. The GSDF brass's true intentions should have been obvious from the moment they put it into service without thick side armour or an RWS - the Type 10 wouldn't make the best urban tank in its current configuration. ;P  The Type 10 was developed as it was because of two key limitations on the Type 90's part:   Weight: As the old mantra goes, it's very easy to make a tank much heavier and very hard to make it a little lighter. The Type 90 at 50t is too heavy for operations outside Hokkaido, and the Type 10 was supposed to give the GSDF across the rest of Japan a decent armoured striking force. Under the current prospective force configuration, it'll be doing in Kyushu what the Type 90 does in Hokkaido, more or less. C4I: The Type 90 is a rather cramped tank, and it doesn't have room for anything more than the most basic C4I implementation in the form of a T-RECS (yes, this is actually what the GSDF battle network is called) terminal inside an occasionally spotted upgraded variant. The Type 10 is designed from scratch to be a fully C4ISR integrated tank, in line with the GSDF's view to the future - while the 7th Division and co up north will rely as always on their enormous preponderance of armoured force in the form their many Type 90s as a deterrent against the Russians, the Type 10s in Kyushu are intended to be part of a more modern networked GSDF capable of fighting more efficiently against a variety of threats (island-based, asymmetric, spread and so on) alongside the variety of assets that'll be fielded soon enough in the region under the command of the Western Army (plus the GSDF Central Command, who'll have direct control over the GSDF's rapid deployment assets - the new Amphibious Rapid Deployment Brigade and the 1st Airborne Brigade)."

TankPorn,32e3de,Karmago,1 point,Mon Apr 13 05:55:41 2015 UTC,"Wow, thank you. that's a lot of interesting information. It was my understanding that the LDP would always find any opportunity to amp up their funding for anything security related. Do you think that more emphasis is being placed in funding the JMSDF now that a potential theater of conflict will take place in a more maritime environment with China?   Also, do you see the MCV being adept at its intended role in urban conflict as well as say, a main battle tank? I'm not too informed of the MCV's armor and capabilities but with a 105mm cannon and a 8x8 wheeled configuration, it sounds like more of a fast-attack tank destroyer more fit for hit-and-run attacks that might be suited for rapid deployment particularly in Japan's mountainous and narrow urban terrain. A lack of armor and treads seems like they'd be its only disadvantages compared to a tank. Thoughts?"
TankPorn,32e3de,HorrificAnalInjuries,3,Mon Apr 13 05:02:50 2015 UTC,"Not at all, my pleasure! (and many kindly thanks for the gold :) )  The LDP under Abe's always been on the (much) more aggressive, nationalistic side of mainstream Japanese politics as far as foreign policy and security are concerned, and the gulf between him and his counterparts is only widened by the fact that the previous government was much more concerned with cutting the budget and spending scarce money on things like rebooting the economy and rebuilding up north after the '11 earthquake. So in that sense - the LDP is more hawkish than the DPJ at a basic level, the DPJ when they came to power did so with a mandate to save money, not spend it, and even within the LDP Abe's on the more hawkish side of things (factional politics within the LDP is so diverse that it's effectively a political system in itself - see: catch-all parties, United States :P ). Put all that together, and Abe looks a lot more security-focal than his counterparts.  Concerning MSDF funding, it's worth remembering that it's always been a well-funded service - even when the Japanese were angling themselves against the poorly Soviet Pacific Fleet back during the waning days of the Cold War, they had a fairly impressive complements of relatively new destroyers, a decent submarine fleet and an indigenously developed air-to-ship engagement capability (this naval focus only expanded with the 1983 decision on the part of the Japanese to assume responsibility for the proactive defence of their SLOCs).   Rather, I think the sharp increase in MSDF procurement is less a reflection of a renewed focus on the maritime environment and more that of an escalated change of focus within it. The post-Cold War MSDF was characterised primarily by two things - the procurement of sophisticated air defence assets towards an anti-ballistic missile capability (the Atago class buy comes to mind), driven by the threat of North Korea, but also the low-scale procurement of vessels like the Hyuga class DDH or Soryu class SSK/SSP to respond to the developing militaries of the region. The Japanese before Abe were more than aware that China was rising, and you can see that in their procurement decisions - it's just that the more public changes in policy and doctrine came afterwards, alongisde bigger and better publicised new procurement, which makes it seem like a hasty change of tack.  With the MSDF, I think the Japanese are configuring themselves for the possibility of a force confrontation over the southern islands, and actually trying to develop their force in such a way that they won't be reliant on the US to guarantee their own territory in the short term. You can see that in the sort of things they're buying - more and bigger helicopter destroyers, more submarines, destroyer escorts and so on. They're the sort of purchases that don't assume US sea control within a handful of days, and I think that's the result of some caution within the Japanese security establishment over the  ability and willingness of the US to intervene in favour of Japan in the event of a confrontation with China over territorial issues. On one hand, that's a capability question - partly alleviated by the pivot and the US commitment to put more boots in East Asia, then reversed by A2/AD and the significant caution the US has shown since the Chinese played that card - and on the other it's a political problem, with the Abe administration desiring a free hand in foreign policy formulation that the US probably isn't willing to fully back. Having an SDF and a Japan that's willing to peacekeep in lieu of American lives is what the US has wanted all along, but not at the cost of having an increasingly independent and vocal set of nationalists in government.  The MCV - let's start with the easy bit. Wheels aren't actually a disadvantage in this case, I'd argue - Japan is a developed country with considerable road infrastructure, and this exploits that. An 8x8 won't do awfully well if it's trying to climb mountains, but the MCV is meant to provide heavy fire support to infantry in urban areas and possibly provide a modicum of striking power to head off heavier enemy assets like armour, which won't exactly be tearing through the forests either. Being able to travel at 100km over roads with no thrown tracks or trailers is a pretty handy capability - couple that with, say, Type 96s and HMVs and what you have is the ability to rapidly converge military assets across more or less the entire coastline of Japan from military bases using existing infrastructure and minimal logistical support - that strategic mobility potential is key. The MCV is probably not going to be the best expeditionary vehicle, and you don't want to mount the Ardennes offensive with one, but it's uniquely suited to 21st century warfare within the borders of a first world nation.  Urban combat - well, on one hand, I think the Japanese have a slightly rosy view of MOUT, but on the other I do think it's unfair to accuse them of not having done their homework. Bear in mind that the last thing the Japanese are expecting to have to deal with in Honshu is a Grozny-style scenario - GSDF doctrine calls for the vast majority of enemy forces to be stopped and defeated at the beaches, which means that any urban combat scenario in their mind would involve pockets of isolated resistance or commando/guerilla infiltrators. In that 'light' MOUT role, the GSDF's been training up its troops for building-to-building combat - rather than tearing through the middle of town spewing autocannon fire like the BMPT, the MCV's 'support' role would probably involve sitting back at a leisurely distance and hitting anything the infantry point out over the fancy new battle network with an HE round. Anything heavier would have to go through the MSDF, three concentric rings of AShM assets, minefields, artillery and ATGM equipped infantry before they can find their way into a populated are (or, well, in theory at least).  So yeah - the 105mm MCV is a rapid deployment vehicle that works in theory because Japan has roads, and because it's meant to provide fire support from a distance rather than plonk itself in front of the infantry. In that sense, it's more of a gun carrier. Now, whether that actually works in practice - that's a separate question entirely."

The Uniform is covered in pockets that allowed a Paratrooper to land with maximum equipment and keep mobile with it on his person when he touched down. Not to mention, a lot of the Airborne Helmets were covered in webbing to allow them to cover it with local foliage to add to their camouflage."

TankPorn,32emz6,Perry87,2,Mon Apr 13 14:11:46 2015 UTC,"That's rather confusing seeing as the original IS rolled into combat in October in 1943 and the Jagdtiger production cycle began over a year before that.

TankPorn,32bi54,CrazyBaron,4,Sun Apr 12 19:21:11 2015 UTC,After participating in a Stryker MGS gunnery recently I no longer fear any combat vehicle with an auto loader.
TankPorn,32bi54,CrazyBaron,5,Sun Apr 12 14:22:07 2015 UTC,"But is that an autoloader problem or just a Stryker MGS autoloader problem? Not that I'm in a position to know first-hand or anything, but from what I gather the M1128 isn't the most dependable vehicle out there..."
TankPorn,32bi54,0000013,2,Sun Apr 12 14:27:35 2015 UTC,"The characteristics of the autoloader in general make it unfeasible in true combat.  To have rounds stored in a replenisher that has to be loaded into a carousel, and the time it takes to do that, plus switch rounds or index different ammo...   An automated loading system is 100% a combat liability. A human loader can do all those things quicker and offer a second set of eyes and a second set of hands."
TankPorn,32bi54,CrazyBaron,8,Sun Apr 12 15:40:55 2015 UTC,"Concerning the rounds stored in the replenisher (or all over the crew compartment, as the Russians do it), this isn't a problem that's exclusive to autoloaded tanks, nor is it a problem that autoloaded tanks necessarily need to have. On one hand, the Leopard 2's ready ammunition supply is 15 rounds on one side of the bustle - lower than any in-service autoloader on a main battle tank, Western and Eastern Bloc alike - and after that, the bustle supply needs to be reloaded from an equally inconvenient store of 27 rounds to the left of the driver. On the other hand, as the Meggitt or FASTDRAW autoloader proposals for the Abrams show, it's entirely possible to have anything between 34-36 rounds of ammunition in ready storage in a blow-out panel equipped bustle autoloader - around twenty rounds more than the Leopard 2 or Ariete, and still more than the ready supply of tanks like the Challenger 2. If you opt for a TTB style carousel autoloader with an isolated crew compartment at the front, you have 44 rounds of ready ammunition and no need for a secondary ammunition supply.  The indexing of ammunition is hardly a problem either - the Leclerc autoloader's computer is capable of managing up to six different types of ammunition in the autoloader at any given time, which are indexed during the loading process. If more types of ammunition need to be managed, it won't be all that hard to upgrade the computer accordingly. All the gunner has to do is select the ammunition type, and from there the computer can be relied upon to ensure it's loaded - at worst, in a modern bustle autoloader, this is a process that's probably going to take two seconds at most. In practice, if the commander has designated targets beforehand (as the commander does), the gunner can select required ammunition sequentially and the process takes no time, because the belt cycles to the next round during the firing cycle.  The switching of rounds is still a problem for most in-service autoloaders - but removing a loaded round from the breech is hardly a considerable obstacle in the face of modern technology. If it was considered a critical enough capability to spend time and money on, do you think it'd be particularly difficult for modern, industrialised countries like France or Japan to work out a reliable system to do the job and retrofit it onto their autoloaders? And that's the thing - the arguments you're citing are the same arguments the US Army has been rehashing since the 1980s about why manual autoloaders are more desirable than automatic loaders.   During that time, the reliability of autoloader systems has increased considerably as the systems have matured, the electronics that control them have become increasingly capable and sophisticated, and the effective loading rate of autoloader systems has gone from the 7-15 seconds per loading cycle of the T-72 series to 4 seconds per loading cycle for the Type 90 in the 90s, and allegedly some 3 seconds for the Type 10. And unlike human loaders, with current reliability levels (don't mistake the hurried and poor systems integration of the Stryker MGS for the quarter century of autoloader development and integration that both France and Japan have behind them), that's 3 seconds per loading cycle for every single ready round in those bustle autoloaders. So while a human loader's personal best might be marginally better than that of a modern autoloader, over extended combat and the full complement of ready rounds in a given tank, the autoloader will be able to maintain that personal best while that can't really be said to be the case for the human loader.  In practice, that's a loading rate that's more than adequate for a current tank's target engagement cycle.  Humans evolve rather slowly. Autoloader mechanisms and electronics evolve with every software update and mechanical improvement made to them, and every new autoloader system designed - there've been rather a few of all of the above since the US Army started to make the arguments you're making concerning autoloaders.  The funny thing, though, is that the above isn't even the key reason for most of these militaries adopting autoloaders. The ideal human loader you're describing here doesn't grow on trees - in a modern Western military, what you're describing is the recipient of a salary and pensions, the product of a not inconsiderable investment of time and money and regular training, a skilled professional soldier trained and built up to do what they do. The real benefit of an autoloader for the Soviets in the 60s and Western militaries post-Cold War alike has to do with the fact that you can, in fact, cut one person from every tank crew. For the Soviets, that meant that a T-series tank didn't require as many trained personnel to field and that a key function of the tank was made mechanical and thus not reliant on regular training, meaning that more T-64s/80s could be fielded with an equivalent number of 'elite' troops and that T-72s could be fielded more effectively in the hands of conscripts. For the French, the Japanese and now the South Koreans, what that meant was that one professional, trained, paid crew member could be cut from each tank, partly counterbalanced with improvements in their respective logistics corps while still making considerable money and time savings and allowing them to field larger tank forces for an equivalent amount of money after the initial investment into developing and installing the autoloaders was made. In essence, the debate wasn't really about pure capabilities in the first place - it was about, on balance, a mild capability loss in exchange for considerably lower costs and requirements. The better autoloaders become, the more convincing an already convincing debate from an administrative perspective becomes."
TankPorn,32bi54,CrazyBaron,2,Sun Apr 12 19:03:53 2015 UTC,"Yep, I've seen a good well trained human loader load a 120mm shell in around 3 seconds, auto loaders on a T-90 can take up to 5. Not to mentioned, as you said, its a complete liability. You can't really just stop in the heat of battle to do repairs if that loading mechanism screws up."

Being Japanese, it's naturally twice as powerful, twice as accurate and probably twenty times as expensive as all the other guns."

TankPorn,328yn1,ironflesh,1 point,Sun Apr 12 08:39:59 2015 UTC,"Can you explain more about the gun? Is the difference that it fires at full pressure, unlike other MGSs which fire at low pressure?"
TankPorn,328yn1,Thatdude253,1 point,Sun Apr 12 00:20:52 2015 UTC,"First and foremost, I was joking. :P Just poking fun at the Japanese propensity to big up their really expensive gear.  That said - it's likely to be a pretty decent gun nonetheless. For one, the continued use of the 105mm is so the new weapons system can inherit the ammunition supply of the Type 74 as it's phased out, so it's more or less assumed that it'll be able to fire the full range of 105mm full pressure ammunition. I may have mentioned this before, but part of the contract with Rheinmetall for the 120mm gun on the Type 90 is that the Japanese wouldn't use that technology to develop their own - hence, during the 90s, the Japanese ended up applying their technological developments to their stock of 105mm rounds. The Type 93 APFSDS round currently used can penetrate a bit over 400mm of armour fired from an L7, and if the Japanese choose to apply their considerable developments since the early 90s in munitions technology to a new 105mm APFSDS, it'd probably match early 120mm rounds in penetration.  Naturally it's not the only MGS out there with a full pressure gun (Rooikat, Stryker come to mind), but the MCV has the added advantage of having very decent mobility characteristics - a superior power-weight ratio and what appears to be very decent stabilisation and recoil control (there's a shot of the gun firing a round more or less directly sideways while on the move in the GSDF's promotional video) means that it'll be able to take its very decent gun and use it effectively while on the move."

TankPorn,324dt6,senoritaoscar,9,Fri Apr 10 20:03:26 2015 UTC,Why is everyone going nuts about this tank? Nobody seems to give the latest Japanese tank that came out this much attention
TankPorn,324dt6,anemonian,24,Fri Apr 10 16:40:33 2015 UTC,"The Type-10 is pretty badass. But the reason for all the buzz around the T-14 is that it's going to become the first tank in active service to feature an unmanned turret. Plus, the crew is enclosed in an armored capsule ""sealed-off"" from the rest of the tank. (Also, the huge emphasis on crew protection marks a gigantic shift in design doctrine for both the Russian military and defense industry, so there's also that.)"
TankPorn,324dt6,anemonian,5,Fri Apr 10 16:53:09 2015 UTC,I think they did away with that autoloader carousel around the turret so they won't get ammoracked so much anymore.
TankPorn,324dt6,anemonian,3,Fri Apr 10 17:21:33 2015 UTC,"I heard about that, too. However, the turret bustle seems pretty small to carry a significant number of rounds when looking at all of the pictures that have come out so far. Unless someone with more knowledge about it can comment, I guess I'll have to wait until after May 9 for the details."
TankPorn,324dt6,captainzero0,3,Fri Apr 10 17:41:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah - I thought one of the earlier images seemed to point at a bustle autoloader, but with this image (and the other ones on the source page) in mind that's starting to seem a bit unlikely. Which, bluntly, is quite silly. :P"
TankPorn,324dt6,captainzero0,3,Fri Apr 10 18:40:37 2015 UTC,"I agree: I honestly don't see the reason behind going through the trouble of adding all of those survivability features...only to store all the ammo inside the hull... If that's the case, I honestly hope that the armored crew compartment is all it's cracked up to be."
TankPorn,324dt6,spudicous,4,Fri Apr 10 20:02:40 2015 UTC,"Well, I mean, you can install blow-out panels under a carousel autoloader too, and you can minimise the possibility of a catastrophic hit to the compartment by, say, isolating the individual carousel cartridges in some way or another to prevent chained detonations. So from a safety perspective (though I'd argue bottom-of-vehicle panels compromises its underbelly protection somewhat), you can adequately isolate the ammunition from the crew, even with a carousel autoloader. For the most part, when T-series tanks went up in flames or had their turrets blown off in, say, Chechnya, it had a lot more to do with the spare ammunition crewmen were keeping outside the autoloader and pretty much all over the tank. :P  But for the most part, anything you do with a carousel autoloader can be done with a bustle autoloader with less trouble and downsides. The Russians already have handy patents in place for fairly innovative removable and reloadable en-bloc autoloaders, the Americans proved with FASTDRAW that you can install safety-proofed bustle autoloaders with ammunition capacity superior to that of a carousel (which is fundamentally limited by the vehicle's turret ring), and if you stick all your ammunition in the back instead of inside the tank, your tank ends up having more growth potential in performance terms - for example, you don't end up having to constrain your APFSDS penetrator lengths on one family of tanks (T-72) because the turret ring diameter (limited) and the ammunition layout (two-piece) didn't allow for much expansion. :P  I'd wager the Russian reasoning revolves around a number of things - their experience with carousel autoloaders and the fact that you can't put much ammunition behind a turret with a small frontal profile safely (hence the M1 TTB using a carousel autoloader - and Jordan's Falcon turret being a bit of a poor design). But even then, there're some rather innovative designs ranging from the 70s all the way up to the current day that could get around the latter problem in particular - the Russians just aren't being particularly adventurous on that front, it seems."
TankPorn,324dt6,anemonian,2,Fri Apr 10 22:55:55 2015 UTC,"Well, that was pretty much a TIL if I've ever had one; haha. But, thinking about it now, it makes sense for the Russians to go with a system that they have experience with. Especially considering that the T-14 is supposed to be a cheaper alternative to the T-95 (which was supposedly cancelled due to its pricey-ness and technological complexity)."
TankPorn,324dt6,anemonian,3,Sat Apr 11 00:22:14 2015 UTC,"In all fairness, they've probably learned their lessons from the T-72 and accounted for the upper necessary limits of a 125mm penetrator's length in this day and age - the great advantage of that weapons system, after all, is that they've had enough time to develop over 11 different APFSDS variants over 3-4 different tanks and two different autoloader configurations before the Armata. It's quite a mature gun system in that regard. They probably won't have that same problem again,  Even then, though - it's easier to separate a bustle autoloader from the crew, less inconvenient to set it up with blow-out panels, and much, much easier to reload if configured correctly (i.e. with a direct reloading port at the back of the turret). Looks like a lack of imagination to me.  Concerning the T-95, you're sort of right, but sort of wrong. It's worth bearing in mind that the period between the T-95 and the T-14 isn't just marked by changes in tank development - throughout that period, the Russian military's moved much more decisively towards the professionalisation of its force (they're tired of relying on the VDV for its force projection in the near abroad), they have a much clearer picture of what their future Army will look like, they've come to an understanding with their defence industry that substandard products won't be purchased, even if that's at the expense of key defence concerns, they have a more clear and present threat in the form of a Europe and America angling to confront them over their plans for what they consider their backyard, and they have a lot more money in the defence budget to splash on procurement. All that's contributed to the Russians going from low-rate BMP-3 procurement and essentially T-72 upgrades to suddenly buying out several armies' worth of brand new Armata and Kurganets vehicles and derivatives, amongst other things."
TankPorn,324dt6,anemonian,1 point,Sat Apr 11 17:47:38 2015 UTC,"You sir deserve an upvote, also what do you think should be the US response to the t14*"
TankPorn,324dt6,TheLuftwaffle,5,Fri Apr 10 17:02:11 2015 UTC,"Well, I don't really see why the US would need to ""respond"" to the T-14 as much as it would need to ""respond"" to the Merkava. I mean, the US already has more Abrams tanks than it needs and the latest version of it seems to have a good amount of service life left in it. However, if the DoD wanted to, I suppose it could replace it's currently tracked armored fleet in the near future with a common chassis platform like the Armata. (Which is already the same concept behind the Stryker family of vehicles,  btw.)"
TankPorn,324dt6,Painkiller90,1 point,Fri Apr 10 17:52:30 2015 UTC,With the current level of tension and relatively out dated tech on the Abrams you'd think they would have an modernization program for tank on tank engagement
TankPorn,324dt6,TheLuftwaffle,6,Fri Apr 10 20:18:01 2015 UTC,"The planned a3 version of the Abrams replaces the copper wire with fiber-optics, and updates the fire-control system. Pretty good if you ask me."
TankPorn,324dt6,Painkiller90,3,Fri Apr 10 20:59:32 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure there're any hard details for what an A3 would like like out there just yet, are there? (I might be wrong, I don't really keep an eye on US tank development these days :P)  For now, the upgrade we're looking at is ECP 1, which is a combination of hard upgrades (better network integration, better armour and IED proofing, a design-integral APU) but also logistics improvements (easily replaceable modular electronics) and the groundwork for future improvements (higher on-vehicle electrical capacity and an ammunition datalink).  To be honest, though - however fancy the Armata ends up being, the M1A2 SEP V2's still a pretty capable tank. It's just that there're a few prickly questions about the former's capabilities that'll have to be answered in future upgrades to the latter - how effective/what are the design principles underlying the new Malakhit ERA, how effective is the new 2A82 gun and its ammunition, and what's the strategic mobility of the new tank and associated vehicle family like, given current and then future Russian airlift capabilities in particular, amongst other things.  And that's the thing. While the upgrades that're supposed to be installed on the ECP 1 are more or less decided upon, I think the -A3 or any more substantial upgrades aren't set in stone because the people responsible for those projects are watching and waiting to see what new tanks like the Armata bring to the battlefield, both on a tank-on-tank and then in a broader strategic and logistical sense, before going on to develop a next-generation tank of their own."

TankPorn,324dt6,RoflSeal,8,Fri Apr 10 23:19:41 2015 UTC,"Type 10 got plenty of attention! It's actually quite funny - when it comes to things like layout or function, the Type 10's a distinctly uninteresting tank (and hence, interest fizzled when other countries started announcing their own new tanks or tank upgrades). The really interesting bit about the Type 10 is in the slightly more opaque technological side of things - very funky protective materials, a very impressive power/drivetrain and so on. :P"
TankPorn,324dt6,On3Sh0T,3,Fri Apr 10 18:42:36 2015 UTC,Because people are wondering how this will compare to the Abrams and other Western tanks since Russian equipment is often exported quite liberally.
TankPorn,324dt6,On3Sh0T,7,Fri Apr 10 21:08:10 2015 UTC,Russia does have a habit of not exporting their high tech tanks. The T-64 and T-80 were never exported because they were deemed to innovative and technology laden.
TankPorn,324dt6,CrazyBaron,2,Fri Apr 10 23:13:20 2015 UTC,"Oh I know, but they also exported the T-90 which is still considered a very advanced modern main battle tank. In fact, I'm pretty sure that it's considered to have eclipsed the T-80."
TankPorn,324dt6,dan4daniel,5,Sat Apr 11 00:14:48 2015 UTC,"T-90 is still just an upgraded T-72. The T-80 was only ever exported after the fall of the Soviet Union, mostly to pay off foreign debt (South Korea)."
TankPorn,324dt6,anemonian,2,Sat Apr 11 10:19:01 2015 UTC,"Except that just like with T-72, there is two different T-90, one for Russian army and second downgraded T-90 for export."

It doesn't have to be big either.  Imagine a small quadcopter that could fly right up to someone's face and explode, carrying say just 10 grams of HE.  This gfy shows what that amount of HE in a 20mm shell can do.  A swarm of such devices would be almost impossibe to defend against."
TankPorn,323i4c,Panda_Cavalry,8,Fri Apr 10 07:31:55 2015 UTC,"Any info on it? Looks interesting to me, it's kinda cute ... like a little pillbug or something.  But with a gun on top of it .... and are those flares on the front?"
TankPorn,323i4c,Ubel,3,Fri Apr 10 18:16:04 2015 UTC,"That's actually a BGM-71 TOW missile launcher on the top, which gives the Raketenjagdpanzer (god, that's such a fun name to say) a maximum effective range of 3.8 km. As for the cylinders strapped to the front of it, those are smoke dischargers. For when you need to GTFO out of a hot zone.  For more info, the internet is your friend."
TankPorn,323i4c,Ubel,2,Fri Apr 10 19:12:54 2015 UTC,.... I KNEW IT.  Seriously I really suspected that was a missile launcher due to it looking nothing like any gun I've seen but I'm really a layman when it comes to this as my knowledge of tanks is limited to playing World of Tanks and reading some wiki articles and browsing this subreddit and imgur posts :)  So I arrogantly assumed it was some kind of weird low caliber gun but I guess that is dumb lol.
TankPorn,323i4c,Bartsches,1 point,Fri Apr 10 23:13:39 2015 UTC,"The caliber would describe the barrels internal diameter ;) With 152mm the caliber of a tow is larger than that of current Nato (120mm) or Russian (125mm) mbt main guns. What you are meaning is the barrel length.    As a rule of thumb the higher the caliber the larger the round. The longer the barrel the more accurate and faster the same round gets, giving it higher max and effective engagement ranges. This is only true as long as no adverse effects appear which is one of the reasons why the Abrams didn't get the longer gun if my memory serves me right.  The guns which are probably closest to a tow launcher would be recoilless rifles albeit they usually have longer barrels as well."
TankPorn,323i4c,Ubel,1 point,Sun Apr 12 09:18:57 2015 UTC,"It doesn't look anywhere near as large as 152mm, which is why I said low caliber, but I guess that's just because I'm used to seeing anything that caliber be much longer as well."
TankPorn,323i4c,Bartsches,1 point,Sun Apr 12 10:07:21 2015 UTC,Also that's made out of thin sheet compared to the much more massive cannons making the outer diameters much closer to each other.
TankPorn,323i4c,dan4daniel,2,Sun Apr 12 10:13:09 2015 UTC,Why would you build this when you could just mount a TOW on a jeep and do pretty much the same thing cheaper?
TankPorn,323i4c,Exxec71,3,Fri Apr 10 21:37:17 2015 UTC,Knowing Germans it was to protect personnel from small arms fire and snipers. Also before you mention heavy anti material rifles consider the terrain which is somewhat dense forests that may require closer shots and/or give away your position. Probably why they ended this.
TankPorn,323i4c,Lion_Of_Night,1 point,Fri Apr 10 22:43:46 2015 UTC,"I guess it would be Primarily about cost: Western Military are guilty as any other bureaucracy when it comes to penny pinching. In this case: modifying a tank that was designed to fit a very specific tactical role to be a practical addition to the modern battlefield (on paper atleast) would be less ""cost prohibitive"" than making a new tank chassis and armament system.   Secondly, I would like to give my own opinion which is informed from purely my own experience as a foreigner who worked with the Bundeswehr: I found them to be exceptionally humane as a military organisation, the welfare of their troops was always a high priority. With that said; I strongly suspect that this vehicle was designed to act in the defense of West-Germany in the event of the unthinkable. The crew would be shielded from atomic fallout and the cabin could generate a interior, negative pressure in an attempt to stop unreacted radioactive particles from poisoning the crew.  Once again, this is pure speculation on my part. :)"

The cylinder on top is a turret, as you might guess, which would've mounted a single .30 caliber machine gun.

TankPorn,322854,TaciturnHeretic,12,Fri Apr 10 00:55:43 2015 UTC,"Being part Japanese myself, I can't help but find your comment a little bit... problematic. :P  The Type 74's a good looking tank! It's very much a relic of past times, though - it's precisely because it has a curvy steel turret that it ended up being made obsolete within years of its being introduced into service.  http://island.geocities.jp/torakyojin88/image/f93.jpg  There was actually supposed to be an upgraded 'G' variant with better electronics, applique armour and so on, but it turns out the Japanese are very bad at upgrading their tanks. In this case, the cost went through the roof and it was cancelled, in the case of the Type 90, they ended up making the tank's interior so compact it essentially had zero growth potential. :P  It's still formidable, mind you (if you can ignore the terrible armour) - bound by their 'we promise not to mess with your technology' contract with Rheinmetall throughout the 90s (because they couldn't make their own 120mm gun with the time and money at their disposal, the Japanese ended up using a German 120mm for the Type 90), the 105mm round for the L7 ended up being the platform for most Japanese APFSDS development during that period. That's probably why they ended up transplanting a 105mm gun onto the new 8x8 MCV - because they have decent enough ammunition for it."

Could be close combat but without context the most common translation is melee.  And thats what I think when I read ""Nahkampfkanone"".  Nahkampf is physical."
TankPorn,31s0en,Fradra,4,Tue Apr 7 23:21:50 2015 UTC,"Actually, the etymology of the word is 'nah' (near) + 'kampf' (combat). In German as in English, what 'close combat' means is entirely context-dependent - it can refer to hand-to-hand combat, but I'm pretty sure 'panzernahkampf' doesn't involve punching steel plates while dodging coaxial fire.  That, and whatever Germans may say about the linguistic competence of their Alpine neighbours, I'm also pretty sure the Swiss have a better grasp of German than you. :P  E: (well, the Swiss-German speaking ones)"
TankPorn,31s0en,Yianna,-9,Wed Apr 8 00:18:28 2015 UTC,"Geez you really wanna start an argument about this?  If you take the word apart of course it will have a different meaning.

I linked you the wikipedia article but you chose to ignore that.  A Nahkampfwaffe refers to a melee weapon not a ""close combat weapon""  I very much doubt the swiss have a better grasp of geman than me."
TankPorn,31s0en,Fradra,3,Wed Apr 8 00:48:32 2015 UTC,"So you think, instead of you being wrong, that the Swiss actually named an armored vehicle ""hand to hand weapon""? You gotta work with context man. Take ""Fallschirmjager"" for instance, which could be translated to ""case screen hunter"". But I'm sure you know that's not what it means. Phrases like this that don't translate well can be found in literally every language.   I'm sure if you explained exactly why you are right and everyone else, including the Swiss Army, is an idiot, we could resolve this."

TankPorn,31s0en,Yianna,4,Wed Apr 8 07:36:13 2015 UTC,"Yes, you are right, its a valid translation, just a very stupid one. Let the natives direct you on this one. Context is as important a part of translation as the words can mean different things."

TankPorn,31se6u,VikingSlayer,3,Tue Apr 7 22:41:00 2015 UTC,"As for the idea - you're sort of right, actually. The engine and the glacis in the same place necessarily limits the protection you can have along the frontal arc of the tank by virtue of a higher initial weight imbalance - there's only so much you can compensate for with stuff at the back. Essentially, what that means is that for all the protection the engine affords, you're doing that at the expense of glacis protection - if you're trying to defeat HEAT munitions, that's not so much of a problem (the engine's a mishmash of uneven metal parts and spacing, which is great for disrupting shaped charge jets), but against KEPs it's no substitute for effective glacis armour. There're also other issues, some fiddly and technical, others decidedly simple (if you mount the turret behind the engine, your turret mounting is at the same height as the engine deck, which makes the tank's overall profile taller than a design where the engine deck can rise behind the turret). It's also much harder to maintain the engine - pulling it out the front is much more difficult than a powerpack conversion out the back.  But once you've cleared that hurdle - well, it's a slab of metal between your crew and most things flying towards them, and having your spare ammunition behind the crew rather than in front of them reduces its susceptibility to exploding in the face of incoming munitions. In the case of the Merkava, the space at the back also allows for rapid ammunition reloading or emergency personnel evacuation, which is quite a handy capability to have. It's not all bad."

TankPorn,31pfh4,killswitch247,7,Tue Apr 7 04:18:47 2015 UTC,I heard late war German armor was very brittle for reasons I can't remember. Perhaps it was a regular shell that did it?
TankPorn,31pfh4,killswitch247,9,Tue Apr 7 05:11:34 2015 UTC,"late war German armor was very brittle    the first signs that german armour quality detoriated were found in late august '44.  source   for reasons I can't remember   lack of alloy metals, mostly nickel. caused by the lack of access to the world market (obviously) and the allied bombing raids which focussed on these industries. also rushed production, because proper face hardening takes time.  source page 114ff (127ff if you count the pdf pages)"
TankPorn,31pfh4,Incrediblebulk92,0,Tue Apr 7 09:06:09 2015 UTC,"Could it not also have been caused by land loss   well, no. or yes. depends on your definition of land loss.  the german's sources for nickel were in finland, greece and norway. all of them were rather small, a german report from 1940 states that the whole european industry had to import 87% of its needs for nickel from overseas (source page 16). the nickel mining in the german reich itself could only produce a ""vanishingly small fraction"" of the industry's need (same source, page 1). finland switched sides in september 1944, so it isn't really land loss. in greece german forces retreated in late 1944 and british forces landed in october. norway was still occupied at the end of the war, but it's questionable whether there were any safe shipping routes in the last months of the war.  on another note: the main nickel producer at the time was canada, whose output was 20 times as large as the 2nd largest, new caledonia, which is a small french colony/overseas departement in the southern pacific.  edit: on yet another note: german steel usually exchanged nickel alloyed steel with chromium-manganeese alloys, which are not worse than nickel. germany had a significant manganeese mining of its own, but the main sources for chromium were imports from turkey and mines in the conquered-and-then-split-up yugoslavia. germany invested heavily in the yugoslavian mining and infrastructure and multiplied its output within the few years of occupation.  partisan activities started to hit the yugoslavian mining industry as early as 1940, but the overall output only started to decrease in 1944. as turkey stopped the chromium export in april 1944, the mining in yugoslavia, greece, albania and bulgaria was enough to fulfill the german industry's needs. this was, of course until romania switched sides in august, bulgaria in september and belgrade was liberated in october.   The Jumo engines also had trouble with Steel Quality which is relevant.   same as with the early snecma atars. better steel quality improves jet turbines significantly, since you can downsize the internal cooling and run them with higher temperatures and pressures for a much longer time."
TankPorn,31o0x4,MaxRavenclaw,11,Mon Apr 6 20:19:47 2015 UTC,"Greetings, tank masters of /r/tankporn!  I have a small math exercise for you. The Black Prince prototype had a Bedford Type 120 horizontally opposed 12-cylinder (says wikipedia). It has the data noted below. My question is, how would the data be altered if instead of that engine, it would have the Rolls-Royce Meteor Mark III V12 petrol?    TANK WEIGHT HP P/W RATIO RANGE ROAD SPEED OFF-ROAD SPEED ENGINE    A43 Black Prince 51 350 7 160 17 12 Bedford Type 120 horizontally opposed 12-cylinder   A43 Black Prince 50 600 12 160 20 15 Rolls-Royce Meteor Mark III V12 petrol    I would do the math myself, but I can't find the respective weights of the two engines. Maybe someone here has a book or something.  TL;DR   What is the weight of the Bedford Type 120 horizontally opposed 12-cylinder? What is the weight of the Rolls-Royce Meteor Mark III V12 petrol? How much would the Black Prince's range and speed improve if the Rolls-Royce Meteor Mark III V12 petrol would have been installed on it?   Thank you!  EDIT  OK. Using the info from here and here I tried to solve this.  I'll assume the Meteor has 800 kg, which is between the 744kg and 861kg (1900 pounds) suggested above. I'll also presume that the Bedford really is 1500kg. That makes the weight reduction of the tank around 700kg. So the tank will be 50.3 tonnes. P/W ratio will be aprox 12. Doing a short statistical analysis of the various P/W ratios and their relationship with speeds on WW2 tanks was mostly inconclusive, even if higher P/W ration generally meant higher speeds (duh). Imma go with 20, like /u/ExplosiveMachine suggested. I'll leave the road range unchanged.  Thank you everyone for the help!  EDIT 2  WOW. 70+ Upvotes?! Thanks guys!"
TankPorn,31o0x4,ExplosiveMachine,3,Mon Apr 6 20:21:27 2015 UTC,"okay so the Merlin weighs 744 kg. The Meteor was made from steel rather than light-weight alloy, but it also had lots of components removed (the supercharger and reduction gear for example). So let's say the weight stayed the same.  The Bedford, well, the only info I could find was on the World Of Tanks wikipedia which says 1500kg but I don't know where they got that from. it's two Bedford six-cylinder lorry engines but info on that is even scarcer. the wiki people may have pulled it out of their asses, but we can use that.   so with the Meteor it weights rougly a ton less, so 50. That gives us a P/W of 12, which is a lot more. How that translates to road speed is pure speculation, of course it's going to be higher, but how higher, we don't know. Maybe around 20 km/h on a road?   The range I'm guessing would be lower though, or maybe not since the engine is clearly more efficient, we just don't know!"

TankPorn,31o0x4,DeusExCalamus,0,Tue Apr 7 07:20:28 2015 UTC,"Don't forget about maintenance and reliability. This (using aircraft engines) hindered the large German tanks. There is no real need to save weight on a tank engine, it should be built to withstand huge abuse, long hours of operation and maintenance with a minimum of labor skill and tools."
TankPorn,31o0x4,dziban303,9,Mon Apr 6 23:01:14 2015 UTC,"Er, the German tanks didn't use aircraft engines, if anything, they were closer to boat/marine engines. Closest thing I can recall that used an 'Aircraft' engine is the radial engines in some Shermans and the Lee/Grant tanks, and the Ford GAA/GAF/GAN V8s, which were originally designed as aviation engines."
TankPorn,31o0x4,dziban303,1 point,Tue Apr 7 03:08:15 2015 UTC,The Rolls-Royce worked well enough for the other tanks it was put on.

EDIT: Read another reply. Apparently yes.
TankPorn,31o0x4,dziban303,2,Tue Apr 7 07:19:13 2015 UTC,"It's less a math question than a research question!  In regards to your question, I can't find any manuals regarding the weight of the Meteor, but it would certainly be heavier than the Merlin from which it was designed, although at nearly the same displacement (say, 27 liters). Maybe 1900 pounds?   As someone with a science background, I want to punch myself for mixing metric and imperial units, by the way."

TankPorn,31l15p,TheHIV123,2,Mon Apr 6 03:10:40 2015 UTC,Is it not an M4A3(105)HVSS? Or is the AFVDB a lower quality source than I thought? http://afvdb.50megs.com/usa/m4sherman.html#M4A3(105)HVSS
TankPorn,31l15p,PTSFJaeger,2,Mon Apr 6 04:21:10 2015 UTC,"Well yes it seems to be, but the hull looks to be a small hatch M4A3 built by Ford. As far as I am aware none of those where converted to the 105 type during the war. M4A3(105)s had the new redesigned hull and they were built by Chrysler. That is why I thought it must have been a post war rebuild or a test bed of some sort."

TankPorn,31l15p,TheHIV123,3,Mon Apr 6 13:40:28 2015 UTC,Why is the turret on the Abrams backwards like that?  Is that how it's stored to reduce the stress on the parts?
TankPorn,31l15p,ThoseTwoRobots,3,Mon Apr 6 04:30:17 2015 UTC,It's how they transport them. When the turret is backwards like that it takes up less space because the gun is protruding as far out as it is facing forward. I guess they never rotated it back when they added it to the collection.
TankPorn,31l15p,JNT11593,2,Mon Apr 6 08:15:26 2015 UTC,Ahh okay that makes sense.
TankPorn,31l15p,ThoseTwoRobots,2,Mon Apr 6 10:32:31 2015 UTC,That's also the only place where the Hatch that goes from the Driver's Hole into the Turret Basket lines up. So at the very least the turret has to be put into that position for the driver to get out without leaving the Driver's Hatch open.
TankPorn,31l15p,Mak_i_Am,2,Mon Apr 6 13:26:08 2015 UTC,Cool pics. From what I understand M60s with the clam-shell turret are actually pretty rare nowadays so it's pretty cool to see one with newer M60 variants.

You don't shoot sabot at light skinned targets because without armor to slam through it doesn't have very much in the way of secondary effects.

Be it APC or IF or a truck, a centerline penetrations gonna bring a world of pain to the vehicle in question.   for unloading a round, remember that many NATO tanks use semi-combustible casing rounds: most of the casing is cardboard and burns up during firing. thats why you dont want to yank them off a gun if you have been firing it a lot recently- the hot chamber might do miracles to teh cardboard even pre-firing. (note that this isnt most likely a nato tank, since ukraine, but still)  TL;DR speed is the key to staying alive in a tank, and loading a new round is always faster than unloading the previous one and then loading a new round, obviously."
TankPorn,31idcv,rangamatchstick,3,Sun Apr 5 17:25:00 2015 UTC,"In Nato, tanks usually start out with an AP round loaded in combat zones. They need to fire it off to switch to something more appropriate if a tank isn't encountered first.  I imagine its a similar thing in CIS states too."
TankPorn,31idcv,TexasTango,3,Sun Apr 5 15:31:25 2015 UTC,"Oh I see. Could they not unload the round once one's loaded? Or is it just a case of firing first, regardless of current ammo?"

TankPorn,31ern8,KingofCoconuts,4,Sat Apr 4 11:05:40 2015 UTC,what kind of effect would this hit have on the crew of the tank? does it just pass right through or does it explode inside the tank?
TankPorn,31ern8,KingofCoconuts,10,Sat Apr 4 15:24:32 2015 UTC,"It doesn't have an explosive element, but it does knock off a lot of high velocity fragments from the armor that would be more or less equivalent to detonating a small grenade inside the turret.  Also if it is a Depleted Uranium round there will be an incendiary element as the fragments knocked off the projectile combust.  In a nutshell, it's unlikely that anyone in the turret survived the impact."
TankPorn,31ern8,snotrokit,2,Sat Apr 4 15:28:13 2015 UTC,thanks for the quick and informative answer. i didn't know they used uranium ammunition in tank shells.
TankPorn,31ern8,burning_phoneix,8,Sat Apr 4 15:30:01 2015 UTC,"If you're interested in reading more about why DU is such an effective material for making penetrating cores I find this to be a very good article.   Impacts against hard targets result in local temperatures as high as 1,800°C, which results in a phase change in uranium from solid to liquid. At these elevated temperatures, the uranium reacts readily with atmospheric oxygen. The oxides formed subsequently condense to solid aerosol particles. Oxidation is the source of the pyrophoric nature of DU impacts and is not present with WHA impacts. This burning effect enhances the effectiveness of DU penetrators, particularly inside the target."
TankPorn,31ern8,fargin_bastiges,5,Sat Apr 4 15:45:16 2015 UTC,"As was expressed to me at gunnery school in Knox,  it's akin to a white hot flaming blender in a pressure chamber. Good luck surviving that one.  Don't get shot."
TankPorn,31ern8,pimpolho_saltitao,2,Sat Apr 4 20:11:28 2015 UTC,i didn't know they used uranium ammunition in tank shells.   DU ammunition is the gold standard for anti-tank rounds now.  Tungsten is okay but not using Uranium is handicapping your armor penetration capabilities.

TankPorn,31fin6,ethan_kahn,13,Sat Apr 4 16:25:16 2015 UTC,"When Life Gives You Lemons… Buy a Tank!  In 1943 the 38 year old Ukrainian woman Mariya Oktyabrskaya learned that her husband had been killed while fighting the Germans in World War II.  A terrible loss for any spouse, Mariya grieved the loss of her husband in a way that is typically unusual for most widows.  She sold all of her worldly possessions and used the proceeds to buy a T-34 battle tank.  She agreed to donate the tank to the Red Army, but only under one condition; that she be the driver of the tank.  After completing five months of tank training, rare considering most Soviet tankers were rushed into battle, Mariya and her tank “Fighting Girlfriend” joined the 26th Guards tank brigade in September of 1943.  Mariya’s skills and bravery would be proven during her first action on October 21st, 1943.  There she and her tank crewmen spearheaded an assault on a fortified German position, smashing through enemy lines while destroying several machine gun nests and artillery pieces.  Throughout the next year she gained a reputation as a veteran tank driver and courageous fighter.  Also a skilled mechanic as well as driver, when her tank was damaged she would often jump out into the open, exposing herself to enemy fire, so that she could conduct repairs and get back into the fight.    On January 17th, 1944 while conducting her usual routine of sowing terror and destruction, Mariya’s tank took a hit from an anti-tank gun which disabled the vehicles tracks.  Under heavy fire, and despite the protests of her crew, Mariya exited the tank to conduct repairs.  Exposed to enemy fire she was struck in the head by a piece of shrapnel.  She lingered in a coma for two months before passing away on March 15th, 1944.  For her bravery and fierce conduct during World War II, Mariya was posthumously award the Heroine of the Soviet Union title on August 2nd, 1944.  Aleksandra Samusenko also bought her own t-34 tank too."

TankPorn,31b4jt,TheHIV123,12,Sat Apr 4 02:40:12 2015 UTC,It was a book and a HBO movie that depicted the development of the M2 Bradley. It showed the process that eventually turned the Bradley into a Frankenstein not optimized for any single purpose.
TankPorn,31b4jt,burning_phoneix,3,Fri Apr 3 14:46:01 2015 UTC,"To be fair to the Bradley, it seems the US Army has not actually used APCs as APCs since, like, WWII. So giving the ""troop carrier"" big guns kind of makes sense, because one way or another it is going to get thrown into battle... Hell, in Generation Kill (and the real life events that inspired it) they use Humvees in place of IFVs...  Pentagon Wars only shows through the part where the Bradley program was exposed for the clusterfuck that it was. There were revisions afterwards."
TankPorn,31b4jt,P-01S,8,Sat Apr 4 05:21:17 2015 UTC,Eventually it did prove its worth though.  It's been a big success since all of its troubles were ironed out in the 80's.

TankPorn,31b4jt,burning_phoneix,5,Sat Apr 4 12:33:13 2015 UTC,"To be fair to the Bradley, everything they made fun of in that clip above is now a standard feature on every IFV, even Russian ones: Aluminum Armour, 20-30mm fast firing gun in a turret and ATGMs mounted next to the turret."

The turret was necessary in a Post-BMP-1 world. A souped up M113 was not going to cut it. They needed a turret, they needed a bigger gun.   History has also justified the fact that they added ATGMs to the turret as it became a standard feature on every IFV that came afterward....hell, even some Humvees have TOW missiles equipped."

The BMP-3 has is the only APC with a 100mm gun. BMP-3 is light enough to float without extra flotation. So in other words, its the farthest away from your description. Its an anti-Bradley.  I find your vague ""if it has armor its a tank"" description quite amusing."
TankPorn,31b4jt,Synthetics66,2,Mon Apr 6 01:11:13 2015 UTC,"The BMP-3s armor is mainly steel.   It's an Aluminum alloy with some sections on the front reinforced.   The BMP-3 is the only thing out there that has ATGMS INSIDE the turret.   Indeed. That's the benefit of Russians sticking with tube missiles and perfecting them instead of giving up (ie, shillelagh) but still, the main point was that the clip in pentagon wars was ridiculing the notion that the generals wanted an IFV with the capability to take out tanks....which today we know is a standard feature on IFVs.   The BMP-3 has is the only APC with a 100mm gun.   Indeed, but it also has a 30mm chaingun in the turret as well. A feature that the BMP-1 lacked and the BMP-2 had because....the 76mm large gun wasn't very effective on the BMP-1 and was switched out for a 30mm autocannon. Like in the Bradley (Yes, I know the BMP-2 entered service before the Bradley. My point is that large guns seemed to be not effective on IFVs at the time.)   BMP-3 is light enough to float without extra flotation   That's nice but was not a point we were even discussing.   I find your vague ""if it has armor its a tank"" description quite amusing.   Where...did I mention that? No really. I do not recall saying that.  And I find it funny that you only mention the BMP-3 considering I mentioned it influenced future IFVs such as the British Warrior, Italian Dardo, German Puma, Japanese Type 89, Swedish CV-90, Korean K-21 and the Spanish-Austrian ASCOD.  All these nations switched from Battle taxis like the M113 to Heavy tracked IFVs with ATGMS, 20-40mm autocannons, light armour and large turrets. Just about the same thing as the US when it made a tracked IFV with ATGM, 23mm autocanon, light armour and a large turret.  Hmm...wonder why?  Don't get me wrong, if you gave me a choice, I'd choose the BMP-3 every time over the Bradley. I also think the Bradley has a lot of problems but that doesn't mean it didn't have a lot of good ideas. Not to mention that the BMP-3 came out 6 years after the Bradley and had the benefit of using the experience of the BMP-1 and 2 to learn from.  Hell, the BMP-1 was a revolutionary vehicle but the execution was rather.....lacking. Its greatness lies in the concept it introduced rather than the merits of the vehicle itself. Just like the Bradley."

TankPorn,31b4jt,P-01S,1 point,Sat Apr 4 02:29:48 2015 UTC,It can also be switched to an ambulance configuration... I don't think there is another ambulance in the world that is also a main battle tank!  ... basically it's designed to be the best urban MBT it can be.
TankPorn,31b4jt,SmokeyUnicycle,3,Sat Apr 4 02:52:14 2015 UTC,"Well, not really - otherwise they wouldn't have had to later modify the Mk. III for urban combat. :P The ambulance modification is fairly unexceptional - essentially, if you've got a fixed amount of space at the back of the tank, you can use that for whatever fits in that space, and one of the available options is to install stretcher and medical equipment fittings to make it MEDEVAC capable. It's as exciting as, say, sticking four stretchers in the back of an IFV instead of its troop complement.  To be honest, back when the Merkava was first designed, the Israelis were less worried about LIC and more concerned by the prospect of fighting other tanks - the rear ammunition bay was arguably a direct result of lessons learned from Yom Kippur, where the Israelis found that fighting plenty of enemy tanks with a limited supply of your own meant that you'd take tank losses and would need to resupply often. The rear storage space was a sort of two birds, one stone approach to that - not only was ammunition resupply made much easier by sticking a big door in the back through which ammunition could rapidly be shunted in, valuable tank crews could also be recovered without trouble by throwing out the ammunition and putting them in the back, to be assigned with all due haste to another available tank."

TankPorn,31b4jt,SmokeyUnicycle,1 point,Sat Apr 4 02:22:06 2015 UTC,Who would ever suggest an APC could shrug off RPG hits?  They're designed to protect from shrapnel and small arms.  Heck an RPG will kill a tank if it hits outside the armor envelope.
TankPorn,31b4jt,Aemilius_Paulus,7,Sat Apr 4 03:20:40 2015 UTC,"Have you seen or read Pentagon Wars? The officers in charge of the Bradley project falsified data and staged tests, e.g. using shitty knock-off RPGs and doing penetration tests with no gasoline or ammo in the vehicle."
TankPorn,31b4jt,SmokeyUnicycle,2,Sat Apr 4 03:23:58 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure why they tested RPGs versus an IFV though.  A basic RPG-7 rips through 500-700mm of steel, how can anything short of an MBT withstand that? Even ERA isn't effective since the RPG-7s have tandem warheads now.   That's like testing a 14.5mm HMG on body armour. Of course modern body armour will never protect you from something like that. Even most troop carriers only protect against up to 12.7mm tops."
TankPorn,31b4jt,Aemilius_Paulus,2,Sat Apr 4 04:10:45 2015 UTC,Because it makes the IFV look good to people who don't know what shaped charges do to aluminum... People such as congressmen.

While figuring out exactly what your armour can stand up to is important, it's also quite important to know what happens after your armour fails - depending on how your design deals with post-penetration effects, it could literally mean the life or death of your crew and complement."

In 1990 a 74-year-old villager helped locate the tank and it was recovered and offered as a Glasnost-era gift to Canada. It was presented to the Canadian War Museum by independent Ukraine in 1992 and stands on display in the LeBreton Gallery.   A remarkable state of preservation for a vehicle that spent so long underwater."

TankPorn,3185fy,3rdweal,1 point,Fri Apr 3 04:07:23 2015 UTC,Tell me more!
TankPorn,3185fy,clee-saan,3,Fri Apr 3 10:51:24 2015 UTC,"It's a modified Magach 5 designed to be an NLOS missile carrier - they've crammed an unholy number of missiles into an armoured shell, stuck a proprietary guidance antenna on top (that curvy thing to the right-rear of the turret) and hey presto, you have a missile tank that works.  Aside from being a potent anti-tank weapon, Spike NLOS is also quite a handy ground-based sub-cruise missile of sorts, capable of precision-striking positions and other softer targets (that's why the British procured Exactor, ostensibly), and that seems to be the role the IDF were using the Magach Tamuz in during Operation Protective Edge in 2014."
TankPorn,3185fy,3rdweal,1 point,Fri Apr 3 13:32:51 2015 UTC,And then they stuck a pipe on the other end to make people believe it's actually a tank and looking the other way?  What's the point of that if it engages targets over the horizon?
TankPorn,3185fy,3rdweal,3,Fri Apr 3 13:50:37 2015 UTC,"It's a minimal investment for a decent return, isn't it? The tank has the capability to be beyond its enemy's LOS while engaging them, but as with many capabilities, that doesn't necessarily equate into the battlefield luxury of always having that advantage. If it's spotted by enemy recce, or from the air, or caught in transit or its firing position by enemy forces, it looks less like a technology packed missile carrier and more like an antiquated tank, all thanks to the magic of a metal tube (which is left over from the tank conversion anyway) :P  E: There's past precedent for this sort of thing - for example, the dummy guns installed on command vehicles from the Cromwell back in WWII."
TankPorn,3185fy,3rdweal,1 point,Fri Apr 3 13:55:06 2015 UTC,"Fascinating.  I had a discussion somewhere recently as to whether the conventional gun-armed tank was obsolete, if I recall correctly the conclusion was that there would be a place for both conventional tanks and an armored ""missile truck"" on the battlefield."
TankPorn,3185fy,farbtoner,1 point,Fri Apr 3 14:03:03 2015 UTC,"This discussion pops up several times a tank generation - but it's been (exactly) a hundred years since the Landship Committee's first prototype, and tanks are still here.  Ultimately, the two vehicles you're describing have markedly different roles, and your conclusion is arguably correct - there's room for both on the battlefield.   On one hand, missile capabilities have become ever more impressive with the minituarisation and cost reduction of IIR sensors, ever improving targeting algorithms and a much more sophisticated network environment in many higher level militaries, which means that tanks (amongst many other targets) are increasingly outranged and vulnerable on the battlefield. It doesn't help that missiles are rather easier to install on light vehicles than large calibre guns, which makes them easy to proliferate around the battlefield (if not a tad expensive).  On the other hand, there's still nothing quite as formidable in terms of mobility and striking power as the tank - it is, after all, a bundle of armour, sensors, engine power and heavy armament capable of tearing across difficult terrain while shearing through anything in its path. And that's just tanks now - as we speak, there's technology being actively looked into that seeks to negate the vulnerabilities discussed above in a variety of nations from a variety of possible angles. That means sophisticated IR spectrum camo (ADAPTIV), less sophisticated IR spectrum camo (Barracuda MCS), hard-kill protection systems (Trophy), passive protection (the Malakhit that's supposed to be installed on the Armata), multispectral smoke, IRCM and lots, lots more. On top of that, we're looking at constant mobility, lethality and logistics improvements in both existing and future platforms.  For the time being, at least, I think the tank's here to stay. :P"
TankPorn,3185fy,TheHIV123,1 point,Fri Apr 3 14:18:49 2015 UTC,"On the other hand, there's still nothing quite as formidable in terms of mobility and striking power as the tank   Do you have time to welcome the Lord LOSAT into your life?"
TankPorn,3185fy,SmokeyUnicycle,1 point,Fri Apr 3 14:27:11 2015 UTC,"A HMMVW equipped with four LOSAT missiles isn't particularly mobile or capable of offensive operations! In terms of battlefield utility, even if it can kill four tanks per reload, that doesn't compare to the offensive potential of an armed and armoured bundle capable of cross-country rapid mobility, engaging targets on the move, equipped with sensors to pick out enemy vehicles long before they pick it out. That is to say - there're many things that can destroy a tank, but not many things that can do the vital job of a tank nonetheless. It's arguably why the tank has come this far, and why such effort is put into ensuring its continued viability.  Concerning LOSAT, it's designed for considerable overmatch - it's the conceptual equivalent of firing a Tomahawk at an MG in a window. It'll kill your target, no problem, but it's rather too much - and that comes at the cost of ammunition capacity, mobility and, well, cost. The missiles are huge.  CKEM is a slightly more practical concept, but even then, it's a big, kinetic energy munition that requires LOS to be usable - as the difficulties had with MRM-KE show, N/BLOS KE is a much more difficult prospect.   Which means that, put against systems like Tamuz/Spike NLOS, the key difference is this - do you want to bet on your HMMVW spotting and engaging a tank, comfortable and equipped with sensors, computers and weapons for LOS superiority, first and successfully, or would you rather sit your lightly armoured missile carrier 25km back and use your superior network and sensor environment to top-kill them from beyond their line of sight?"
TankPorn,3185fy,3rdweal,2,Fri Apr 3 14:44:46 2015 UTC,"do you want to bet on your HMMVW spotting and engaging a tank, comfortable and equipped with sensors, computers and weapons for LOS superiority, first and successfully, or would you rather sit your lightly armoured missile carrier 25km back and use your superior network and sensor environment to top-kill them from beyond their line of sight?   The second one!  My point was that a gun-armed tank, while formidable, can be killed in so many ways that its a surprise that armies bother with them anymore. That being said, the advances made in active protection systems is truly impressive, the arms vs armor race continues.  I would envisage a future tank being a low profile turretless armored box with a large battery of mini-LOSATesque guided missiles, with maybe a couple of RWS for local defense."

TankPorn,315th3,anemonian,2,Thu Apr 2 18:48:35 2015 UTC,"In its time and theatre, yes - good protection, good armament, good mobility. Compared to many other French tanks, it was also designed from the get-go with a radio, which was a plus.  That having been said (and this is a characteristic quite a lot of French tanks seem to have), its battlefield endurance was somewhat limited in theory by the fact that the commander was hideously overworked. And the photo you're looking at certainly isn't one of France in 1940 - the T-34/76, for example, was rather more capable than the early Panzer IIIs and IVs (at best) that the Somua might have expected to face during the Battle of France. It only took a handful of years for it to become obsolescent.  And, of course, the effectiveness of a tank is ultimately mostly dependent on how it's used - as the French Army's defeat in 1940 indicates. :P"

I always enjoyed watching the tanks moving around so I watched some Abrams being offloaded. One driver started drifting a little too much and despite the frantic gestures of the ground guide, the tank slid off the side of the flatcar. It ended up crushing the CITV and I think it crushed the gunner's sight as well.  Good memories from the Ft. Hood railhead."

Did a support op once for C 1/5 Cav where they had to provide us a driver and tc for our truck so I could do my job. It was about 20 degrees outside and the HMMWV's heater couldn't keep our soft shell truck warm so the TC they gave us had me and my partner go stand about 15ft behind one of their tanks. Warmed up really quick. Somehow the Brad made it onto my license and I was in somewhat well with our engineer company's 1SG. Asked if I could actually learn to drive it and he said sure.

By then end of my service i knew the bradley better than most others. Mostly this was because 9/10 of the time if something was wrong it was above my 'level' to fix it. So a mechanic had to be there to supervise. If i didn't know how to fix it or what was going on i would pester the mechanics on ""what does this do /how do i fix this issue "" .. some mechanics  love when you ask questions  and others just wanted me to shut my trap and let them work."

TankPorn,3101qt,pdcjonas,7,Wed Apr 1 12:08:35 2015 UTC,It's there to act as a stabilizer.  The front of the tank while on the incline isn't fully planted in the ground and is instead being lifted utilizing hydraulics and the back to lift it off the ground and act as a backstop resulting in a sturdy firing platform while maintaining a low profile.

TankPorn,30zz9w,crimson_blindfold,3,Wed Apr 1 17:07:10 2015 UTC,"The K2's bustle autoloader looks a bit like the Type 90 or Leclerc's: like this.  http://i.imgur.com/WdHHSR4.jpg  I wrote a full explanation of how they work a while ago, like so:  ""'Bustle' autoloaders: it's in the name, with the autoloader located in the bustle (the rear section of the turret). The way in which the ammunition is arranged differs from vehicle to vehicle, but the key here is that the ready ammunition is all stored behind the gun breech itself, rotating into position in the bustle before being rammed forwards into the gun.   http://i54.photobucket.com/albums/g108/Luciano_32/mbt70-02.jpg  What you can see above is the bustle autoloader proposed for the MBT-70; this is pretty much the 'basic' model which most in-service bustle autoloaders adhere to. A rotating belt of ammunition is packed into two rows at the back of the turret, and whenever the gunner picks a round the belt is mechanically cycled until the chosen round is in front of the loading port (which is aligned with the gun's breech). From there, a loading 'tray' extends out from the loader compartment to the gun, and a rammer behind the ammunition belt pushes the round into the autoloader. Simple stuff - you can see why its been kept around. Its most modern iteration, the autoloader of the Leclerc, looks a bit like this:  http://www.armyrecognition.com/europe/France/vehicules_lourds/Leclerc/Leclerc_Char_Technical_information_France_03.jpg  Other takes on the basic concept of a bustle autoloader do of course exist, but most of them never really progressed beyond the paper or rudimentary testing stage. The obvious exception is the autoloader on the AMX-13, which is an ancestor of sorts to the autoloaders we see on contemporary Western tanks.  https://sg.hu/forumkepek/2012_10/amx13.gif  http://0-media-cdn.foolz.us/ffuuka/board/tg/image/1384/97/1384978536058.jpg  The autoloader on the AMX-13 is a bustle autoloader (the ready ammunition is stored in and loaded from the bustle), but it's not a belt autoloader like the ones we've seen before. Rather, it uses two rotating ammunition drums, one on each side of the bustle, from which rounds are loaded; a drum is cycled around, deposits the chosen round on the loading tray between the drums and the round is rammed into the breech. Slightly different - in fact, this particular arrangement as designed for the AMX-13 caused a little bit of trouble, because the cramped internal dimensions of the tank together with the way the drums are designed (because they're tapered towards the front), you couldn't actually reload the autoloader from within the vehicle. On the Leclerc, on the other hand, you can take the vehicle's reserve ammunition (located in the hull) and reload the autoloader from within the vehicle.  The American FASTDRAW proposal is sort of a spiritual 'successor' to the AMX-13's dual drum layout:  http://img4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20130213040324/facebooknations/images/e/e0/Abrams_Autoloader_System.png  It proposed two powered 18 round drums to be installed in a modified Abrams (loaded with the rounds facing backwards, to be rotated as they're loaded, to allow the autoloader to fit into the Abrams' turret), essentially to maximise capacity while preventing what you call 'fratricide' - in theory, because of the way the autoloader is designed, if one drum detonates you can still use the other one to keep the tank fighting.  There've been other, fairly interesting proposals for bustle autoloaders that have come up over the past twenty or thirty years too: large, two-piece autoloaders for the 140mm tanks the NATO nations were planning to bring into service, or removable bustle autoloaders for easy reloading as proposed for the Russian 'Black Eagle' technology demonstrator. This is just a simple explanatory piece, and not an exhaustive list, so I'll leave them out. :P"""

TankPorn,30zz9w,Vertigo666,2,Thu Apr 2 22:06:30 2015 UTC,"Hope this helps!  ""'Carousel' autoloaders: You'll definitely have come across these before, with every Russian main battle tank since the T-64 using an autoloader of this kind. The carousel autoloader is fundamentally different to the bustle autoloader in that it actually stores its ammunition in the hull - again, in fact, it's in the name. If you've ever seen a carousel ride at a fairground, that's pretty much exactly how it works: there's a 'ring' of ammunition around the turret basket (the 'basket' being the cylindrical section of the turret that extends into the hull), with a loading mechanism behind the gun's breech that can take a cartridge and load it into the tank. Alas, these are actually rather difficult to explain without the use of detailed diagrams - essentially, because the turret basket isn't large enough to be able to store rounds vertically or horizontally and then load them into the gun in one piece, these Soviet autoloaders have actually opted for two-piece ammunition which can be stored in a fairly compact arrangement inside the tank's hull and loaded into the gun without taking up too much space. There're two main 'branches' of Russian carousel autoloader development, with the T-64/80 family opting for a slightly more complex but faster (and rather elegant) solution and the T-72/90 using a somewhat simpler but slower arrangement. We'll start with the T-72/90, because, really, who uses T-80s anymore?  In fact, there really isn't that much to explain when it comes to the T-72 - it'll make a lot of sense when you see it. Here's a cross section of the autoloader.  http://i.imgur.com/l6xory6.gif  Looking at the cross section, you can more or less see how it works. The thing at the bottom of the turret basket is the ammunition carousel, which rotates around and feeds ammunition into the gun via the loading mechanism behind the gun. The carousel itself looks a bit like this:  http://fofanov.armor.kiev.ua/Tanks/EQP/al-72.2.gif  The way the T-72/90 autoloaders work is comparatively simple. If you look at the cassettes, you can see that the ammunition is in two pieces - you have the segment at the bottom, which is the main round (which is loaded first), and the segment above that, which is the propellant charge (loaded second). When a cassette is moved to the loading position along the same arc as the gun breech and the loading mechanism, the cassette itself is 'hoisted' up to the breech so that the bottom of the cassette (the 'round') is level with the gun breech. From there, the round is rammed into the breech, the propellant charge is moved into the previous position of the round - it's then rammed into the breech as well, and the gun is ready to fire. You can see how it works in the diagram below.  http://fofanov.armor.kiev.ua/Tanks/EQP/al-72.1.gif  So, cassette is hoisted up, round is rammed into the breech, propellant falls, propellant is rammed afterwards. The obvious disadvantage here is that the loading process requires two movements, which makes it comparatively slow - on the other hand, it's incredibly simple. The diagram below should show you how the whole assembly fits into the T-72.  http://i.imgur.com/l6xory6.gif  If you understand how that works, prepare yourself for some serious buggering of the mind - the T-64/80 has a very different autoloader.  It's easiest to understand the way in which the T-64/80's carousel autoloader works if you remember one thing - unlike the T-72, the designers were prioritising speed. If you're to divide up the T-72's loading process into stages, you'd get four: the cassette is hoisted up, the round is rammed, the propellant charge falls into place and the propellant charge is rammed. In the T-64's case, that's reduced to two stages - the cassette folds out and upwards into position, and the full round assembly is rammed.  http://i.imgur.com/N5m31tS.gif  This diagram's going to be a bit difficult to decipher - I'll walk you through it. If you remember how the T-72's autoloader was structured, this isn't fundamentally different - the gun is in the same place, and there's still a rotating carousel. The difference in this case is that, where the T-72 stores its rounds in two pieces, one above the other, the T-64's autoloader has a large turret radius to play with, and consequently stores its rounds in two pieces that form an 'L'. Number '10' on the diagram is where the front of the 'round' is, which is the bottom of the L, and the cylinder stretching upwards from number '2' is the propellant charge. This is the storage configuration of a cassette in the T-64/80 autoloader; if you look at the other side of the turret basket on the diagram, you can see an ammunition cassette without the loaded ammunition. It works the same way as it does in the T-72 - the carousel rotates around the outside of the turret basket.  http://btvt.narod.ru/4/t-80.files/mz-80.jpg  If you look at this diagram, you have a very good illustration of the two stage loading process of the T-64's autoloader. The cassette's starting position is to the right of number '2' on the diagram; you can see that the 'L' shaped cassette has folded upwards so that the forward 'round' part of the cassette has gone from being under the propellant charge to being to its left. This is the 'ready' position of a T-64/80 cassette about to be loaded.  This is where it gets a bit tricky to explain. What you can see on the diagram is that the cassette in its 'ready' position goes from there to being folded out between number '5' and '10' on the diagram, ready for loading - the real genius of this particular autoloader is that it gets to that position in one, clean movement. I could try to explain the movement in words (and you might already have understood how it works, in which case you've saved me a lot of trouble), but I think this is a better way of explaining it. Take your right arm, and fold your forearm upwards along your upper arm so that your hand is around where your shoulder is (and it looks a bit like the T-64 cassette in its 'ready' position). From there, extend out your forearm forwards along a horizontal line from your shoulder - now, your arm should be stretched out in front of you, in a line running horizontally from your shoulder to your hand. This is pretty much the way the T-64 autoloader works - the folded up cassette in its 'loading' position unfolds in one clean movement so that the two pieces of the round are in position to be loaded, allowing them to both be rammed at the same time into the gun from there.   It's definitely more complicated than the T-72's autoloader, but was also consistently one to two seconds faster from the beginning to the end of their respective loading processes - between that, the more sophisticated computerisation of the loading system on the T-64/80 (which the T-72 family only received in the T-90) and the larger rounds that could be stored in the T-64/80's autoloader (again, something that was only remedied with the T-90), the T-64/80's 125mm armament was decidedly more potent as a weapons system.  Obviously, carousel autoloaders weren't an exclusively Soviet idea - the US actually proposed something of the kind for the M1 TTB (Tank Test Bed) technology demonstrator. The images below are of the TTB and a diagram of the proposed autoloader, in that order - you'll notice that the arrangement doesn't leave any room for crewmen in the turret or turret basket. The TTB's design was meant to minimise the tank's profile and maximise its ammunition capacity by putting all three crewmen at the front of the hull.  http://btvt.narod.ru/3/blok3/abrams_7.jpg  http://i.imgur.com/SKOagYu.jpg"""

Which meant that every tank really had to stop to fire and hit at normal combat ranges, and the Strv 103 was thus not really a 'defensive' tank per se - just a tank that cleverly exploited the limitations of the era by using the requirement to stop and fire as an excuse to radically lower the tank's profile.  Of course, that calculation didn't necessarily play out when multiple axis stabilisation became fairly mainstream over the next decade, because it meant that turreted tanks could both fire on the move and fire faster after coming to a stop. But as the following link shows, the Strv 103 at its prime was certainly capable in the right hands of beating turreted tanks on the offence.  http://home4.swipnet.se/~w-42039/comparisons_with_turreted_tanks.htm"

The tank had crazy elevation for a tank that relied on its suspension to move the gun, though, and what that meant was that a well trained tank crew firing from a reverse slope could turn the 103 into what I presume would have looked a bit like a 105mm-toting, death-dealing pancake."

TankPorn,30vsd1,ethan_kahn,6,Tue Mar 31 02:37:02 2015 UTC,A gas turbine engine? I thought the reason the Black Eagle was cancelled in the first place was due to the terrible performance of the gas turbine engine in the T-80 it was based on. Strange that they would revert to it now. Maybe because Russia's defence ministry isn't run by the Soviets any longer so they changed their perspective.

TankPorn,30vsd1,InWadeTooDeep,4,Sun Jun 14 05:53:36 2015 UTC,"The concept of a fully automated turret seems like a pretty smart, modern choice.  The US has been investigating something along those lines since the 1950s, and they concluded then that putting the crew all in one place greatly increases the potential armor and radiological protection for the crew. Id be surprised if the next gen of NATO vehicles didnt also include something similar.   What I dont get is the preponderance of cannons and MGs.  Neither seem particularly useful except in specific circumstances, especially given that Russian AAA has historically been on point.   If nothing else, I cant wait to see this thing in the May Day parade. And Id love to see how NATO responds with their own eventual models."
TankPorn,30vsd1,BeondTheGrave,3,Tue Mar 31 19:40:02 2015 UTC,The automated turret is indeed interesting. The biggest problem IMO are malfunctions of the autoloader. If this thing has some kind of problem you are pretty much fucked...

TankPorn,30t14e,IAMARobotBeepBoop,1 point,Thu Apr 2 03:32:26 2015 UTC,It expels all the gasses from the expended round out of the gun tube so they don't come back in to the turret through the breech.
TankPorn,30t14e,Tankrgod,1 point,Thu Apr 2 03:40:47 2015 UTC,Did the gases go into the T-54s turret bc it didn't have this thing?

TankPorn,30t14e,killswitch247,3,Mon Mar 30 17:19:59 2015 UTC,"do you mean these ones? first one looks more like a german 105mm howitzer, 2nd one like a soviet 45mm at gun"
TankPorn,30t14e,BeondTheGrave,1 point,Mon Mar 30 17:31:20 2015 UTC,"Indeed, well spotted!"
TankPorn,30t14e,killswitch247,1 point,Mon Mar 30 18:25:13 2015 UTC,"Id guess that the small ones are M-3s while the larger ones are some variation of a 105mm howitzer, probably the M101 or M2. Given this is an American production, American surplus is probably the cheapest to get a hold of and rent out for an afternoon.   Though there were a lot of Soviet 45mms made, and its not impossible that they got some of them. I cant really tell from that angle, and both guns look a lot alike. Itd be pretty easy to see which gun it was by looking at the gun shield, as the M-3 and 53K have completely different gun shields, if we had a different angle.  Its also possible that a collector or propmaster modified an M-3 barrel with a 53K looking shield. Its amazing what people are doing these days to get authentic looking WW2 vintage kit."
TankPorn,30t14e,BeondTheGrave,2,Mon Mar 30 20:11:14 2015 UTC,the wheels look more like the 45mm carriage. 37mm m3 vs. 45mm  it also looks like the gun shield is angled and not perpendicular like the m3.

TankPorn,30t14e,snotrokit,2,Mon Mar 30 20:20:04 2015 UTC,It's a T-54. I'm pretty sure a T-55 would have a more rounded turret.
TankPorn,30t14e,ExplosiveMachine,7,Mon Mar 30 15:46:43 2015 UTC,From the outside they are virtually identical. 54 has no bore evacuator.
TankPorn,30t14e,Chops_II,6,Mon Mar 30 16:51:44 2015 UTC,"And the T-54 has an overhang at the rear of the turret, a detail many leave out. obvious here.  I find it very interesting how the turret developed from the T-34-85 and T-44 turret with tons of overhangs, on one of the T-54 prototypes as well, and only with T-55 did the Russians realise that any overhangs were completely unnecessary and just made shot traps so they just met the hull and turret side at 90° and were done with it."
TankPorn,30t14e,Chops_II,2,Mon Mar 30 18:05:31 2015 UTC,"Ah yes, according to the wikipedia article, the overhangs were removed for the T-54-3 version. The A and B versions are later than this as well."
TankPorn,30t14e,LengthyWarfare,1 point,Tue Mar 31 01:34:33 2015 UTC,"If war thunder is realistic, then there were a few variants of the T-54, the later one(s) without the overhang."

TankPorn,30rmba,SawedOffLaser,3,Mon Mar 30 04:58:36 2015 UTC,"I've never seen this picture before but I really want to say this tank was more than likely knocked out by Allied fighter-bomber aircraft. Either it could have been taken out on its way to the front lines before ever having made it into combat (as many German tanks were in Normandy) or it was dug into some really well fortified position. The Allies would have attacked with ground forces, met stiff resistance centered around tanks like this and then fallen back. After retreating to a safe distance they would call for air support. The droves of fighter-bombers that prowled the skies of Normandy would have swarmed the area and bombed/strafed anything that moved or looked even slightly suspect.   After the war Fritz Bayerlein the commander of the Panzer Lehr Division recorded the effects of the allied air attacks. General Bayerlein, like all the other divisional commanders on the ground, knew that in the face of allied air superiority it was almost suicidal to move during the day. Nonetheless, in their desire to rush as many troops into battle as quickly as possible the German High Command proved to be stubbornly inflexible, as Bayerlein bitterly recalled:  ""At 2 o'clock in the morning of June 6th I was alerted that the invasion fleet was coming across the Channel. I was told to begin moving north that afternoon at 5 o'clock. Well this was too early. Air attacks had been severe in the daylight and everyone knew that everything that could fly would support the invasion. My request for a delay until twilight was refused. So we moved as ordered and immediately came under allied air attack. I lost 20 or 30 vehicles by nightfall. At daylight next morning, the commander of the 7th Army gave me a direct order to proceed and there was nothing else I could do, so the vehicles moved off as ordered. By the end of the day I had lost 40 trucks and 90 others. Five of my tanks were knocked out and 84 half tracks, prime moves and self-propelled guns. These were serious losses for a division not yet in action.""    pg. 157 - German Tanks At War by Bob Carruthers"

While you posted an interesting quote this is entirely unfounded speculation. Relatively few tanks were directly knocked out by fighter-bombers, fewer than 7% of German losses actually. It is far more likely that this tank was knocked out by Allied ground forces, or abandoned after being destroyed by the crew, which I guess could be indirectly attributed to the air forces depending on the circumstances."

Flamethrower-armed Shermans used by the USMC in the Pacific went by the ""Zippo"" moniker, but other very similar conversions had different labels (ex. ""Ronson"", ""Crocodile"", ""Badger""), depending on the manufacturer.   The Fireflies shown in the article were actually formerly used by the Lebanese Army and its succeeding militia groups.

TankPorn,30k5j1,JNT11593,3,Sat Mar 28 01:53:21 2015 UTC,"I had an old CSM who started his career on the M60. He told me that it was a lot roomier than the M1 in the turret, that you come to a complete stop to fire because the stabilizers sucked, most of them topped out at like 25 mph, and he recounts losing his toolbag on multiple occasions because the escape hatch on his tank had a loose latch."
TankPorn,30k5j1,TankerD18,3,Sat Mar 28 06:40:44 2015 UTC,"I have been inside one, there is so much room that you can stand up and still have a few inches above your head."

TankPorn,30k5j1,TankerD18,2,Sat Mar 28 17:36:36 2015 UTC,I recall from hearing stories from Saudi soldiers in Desert Storm regarding the roominess of the M60.  They didn't like army food (who does?) and decided they'd have fresh as fresh can be. They bought a bunch of sheep from local shepherds and just tossed some hay in the corner of the tank and let the sheep live there till they ate it.

TankPorn,30k5j1,finackles,2,Sat Mar 28 18:14:51 2015 UTC,"First time I ever heard of ERA, concept seems to have been around for quite a while. Neat idea, the fact that personnel have to stay away from it is an interesting point. My head can't quite grasp that setting explosives off on the hull is a good idea."
TankPorn,30k5j1,burning_phoneix,1 point,Sat Mar 28 20:33:36 2015 UTC,They explode outwards so the tank is completely unscathed.
TankPorn,30k5j1,finackles,1 point,Sun Mar 29 13:01:08 2015 UTC,"Newton's third law makes me wonder how this works, but I presume it must. Sort of feels like they must have to thicken armour to counter the explosion but if it's fast enough to counter the impact of the enemy round maybe it doesn't have to be that powerful."
TankPorn,30k5j1,burning_phoneix,1 point,Mon Mar 30 00:38:21 2015 UTC,"Well technically, since the explosive itself is much smaller than the explosive of the shell and dissipates over a wider area, it's effect is very limited on the armour underneath it.   That being said, it could damage weak armour which is why you rarely see it applied to rear armour and the like."
TankPorn,30k5j1,WerdnaS,2,Mon Mar 30 04:17:12 2015 UTC,"Any time I've seen a photo of the M60 or its derivatives, none of them have had side-skirts on them. Is there any reason for that?"
TankPorn,30k5j1,burning_phoneix,1 point,Sat Mar 28 22:28:36 2015 UTC,I believe  (and don't quote me on this) that the designers didn't see a need for side skirts as they don't have much of an affect on the latest generation RPGs (RPG-7) and HEAT (AT-3 Sagger) rounds of the period and most American tanks were already at the weight limit anyway and couldn't afford any additional Armour that was found to be of limited value.

The back deck looks like an Abrams as well with a bit of le clerc boxy-ness, the front slope looks like it's from a merkava, and the side skirts although remove-able remind me of a challenger2, I may be wrong but it looks like all of those to me for a fictional tank."
TankPorn,3073yy,Ness341,9,Wed Mar 25 01:46:39 2015 UTC,"Ack, you've put in so much effort! It's actually mostly based on one tank, the Japanese Type 90, with (as you spotted) a gun length extension to shift it up to L/55 from the original Rheinmetall L/44. Front slope is probably somewhere between the Type 90 and, say, the Leclerc (on the former, the tracks extend past the point where the glacis meets the drivetrain a little bit more than they do on the latter) - Merkava's is distinct to both and a lot of other tanks besides because it's meant to accommodate a diesel engine instead of a driver and occasionally reserve ammo (as I'm sure you know!)  Side-skirts are slightly odd - it's probably closer to a Leclerc than anything else, though it's hard to tell because I've removed the rubber extensions."

It's funny, the impression I get is that the Abrams is a bit like the Leclerc in one sense. They're both brilliant tanks at what they do - just so long as you've got a very good logistics and maintenance chain behind you. Doubly so if you're a driver - the Leclerc's hyperbar drinks almost as much gas as the Abrams' turbine does and manages to be twice as complicated too :P"

The turret storage is based directly off the Leclerc, except I've reversed the placement of the basket and the protected box. The Leclerc doesn't actually have a 'proper' bustle rack like the Abrams - what it does have is protected storage in the modules running along the sides of the turret for tools and whatnot. This tank doesn't, alas.  As for the mantlet and the turret shaping - well, the Leopard and Type 90 don't differ too much in that respect! (the latter's turret is surprisingly harder to draw, though) Height-wise, the turret's somewhere between the two, and I guess the way the mantlet's drawn reflects that."

From the landscape, it reminds me of some of the photos from the airport in the east (I don't remember the name) that had a half dozen or so tanks taken out at it. It looks to me like an RPG or something similar set it off, and it just tore the tank apart.  Looking at ti again, the Ammo certainly went off. Whether or not that was the start of it or happened as a consequence, the turret doesn't cleanly separate that distance without a cookoff."
TankPorn,303caz,Cptcutter81,1 point,Tue Mar 24 09:07:21 2015 UTC,All the tanks that got ammo racked that I saw tended to lose the turret but still had a mostly good hull.

TankPorn,303caz,rangamatchstick,1 point,Tue Mar 24 12:42:28 2015 UTC,"really depends on how the ammo was hit, sometimes it will just be a slow burnoff where the propellant charges get ignited slowly and just burn off creating that jet of fire you see come from the hatches. Other times the ammo is hit hard and detonates all at once creating the destruction seen in this photo.  This happens with the T-** tanks as the tanks use 2 piece ammo, where the warhead and propellant are stored seperately and the auto loader loads the warhead,then the propellant charge. The propellant charge is cased in a fully combustible pyroxylin-cellulose, TNT-impregnated tube with metal base.

After the end of the hostilities, the M-10 remained in the Finnish service; in the 1980s there were some considerations of modernizing it, but the idea was dropped; the guns were stored in the army depots until 2000 and then they were finally retired."
TankPorn,303j9p,grospoliner,1 point,Tue Mar 24 16:32:17 2015 UTC,They were gun howitzers before they were mounted onto tanks.

But then again, I found out recently that Finland didn't issue socks to the infantry until the last two decades. Also they're still using ancient rifle chassis, many of which were taken from the Russian Tsar."

I doubt those painted crosses will matter much in the dark or at anything more than a couple hundred metres.  Also I'm not sure I'd like to be in a friendly tank and have to check every kv1 I see that it doesn't have a cross painted on the side.
TankPorn,303j9p,acardiacus,1 point,Tue Mar 24 18:11:36 2015 UTC,afaik KV2's were usually used by artillery officers / spotters by the germans because of their height. Granted I'd rather avoid being in a captured tank aswell during wartimes.

The pictures in the thread you linked appear to be a new SPG, however I don't even know what Russia uses currently for SPG's, so it could just be those SPG's were uh... cold, and needed covers."
TankPorn,302zxi,Jharkie,3,Sat Mar 28 07:06:38 2015 UTC,Source. (In Russian.)  EDIT: Does anyone else think that the chassis look similar to the ASCOD's?
TankPorn,302zxi,anemonian,3,Tue Mar 24 01:29:43 2015 UTC,"Not really an ASCOD - if anything, I feel as though the Russians have taken notes from the Chinese? The lower glacis is much more exposed than it would be on comparable vehicles, and I feel as though that's directly related to the vehicle's swimming performance (which the BMP-series has been having trouble with for a while).  Aside from that, its turret is set somewhat further back, I guess, and it's much lower profile (being unmanned, if I remember correctly) than the ASCOD family's equivalent (in its conventional 30mm guise). Unlike the Armata, the appearance of the Kurganets and its components are anything but secret ;)  http://rm-cdn.serverhost.ro/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/cmjaC.jpg  Don't forget that the plan down the line is for it to be equipped with a larger cannon in the 45-57mm range.

TankPorn,3042cj,Enlil42,4,Tue Mar 24 10:02:16 2015 UTC,"Modern T-72s are a decent tank. The only ones we've seen in combat are stripped down, el cheapo ex-soviet tanks using old ammunition and lower velocity guns. I'm sure a modern T-72BU or BA would pose a lethal threat to a Leopard or Abrams and the Moderna was just that, a modernized T-72 with a scary looking turret.   Tank on tank I'm sure modern Russian and modern western tanks are a deadly match for each other, neither having any definitive advantage except that Russian tanks tend to be smaller and lighter. Another thing is that there is no Abrams to have front ERA like the Moderna does which could nullify incoming rounds (to what effectiveness I have no idea, I believe it can stop just about anything once).   I don't believe either side, when comparing the cutting edge, has any advantage to speak of, especially when they're just going to get drone striked as soon as they come out of cover"
TankPorn,3042cj,0000013,3,Tue Mar 24 10:16:56 2015 UTC,"Modern T-72s still have the same core problem than the ones that were knocked down by the thousands the last 35 years: theyre soviet tanks built for cheap and easy operation around an autoloader thats stores the entire tanks ammunition load basically between the crew..  Thats why anything built on that chassis has to be taken with a grain of salt, no matter how many 20mm oerlikons get bolted to the side. because for every notion that the ones killed around the middle east are export models or have reduced armor or weaker weapon systems (and my country used export t-72s as late as ten years ago!) the fact remains that whenever the unfair battle of modern western tank vs any variant of t-72 has come to pass, the burning husks have been the t-72s.  That, and the pictures of stuck 125mm sabots sticking out of abramses and challengers kinda gives bad background to claims that the ""modern"" T-90s are anything else, really.  P.S also the hype over the T-95 that never realized, in addition to all the cutbacks in development last 25 years due to collapse of the USSR are not helping it at all, either."

TankPorn,300vp8,TheHIV123,3,Mon Mar 23 18:23:59 2015 UTC,Is it maybe a trailer specially constructed to be towed by the M2? It looks like it has more ground clearance than the chassis in the front.  You'd think that the horizontal bar to the rear wheel would make it easily identifiable though.

TankPorn,3001rd,Captain_English,6,Mon Mar 23 12:12:10 2015 UTC,The steel being heavier actually adds to it.

TankPorn,3001rd,crimson_blindfold,3,Mon Mar 23 13:54:55 2015 UTC,I'm sure there's steel cable or plates inside. The question is how do you replace a broken track? Is it continuous or linked?   I've seen a tracked bobcat excavator with a rubber tread and the whole thing had to be replaced if it broke. I wonder if it's the same.
TankPorn,3001rd,Peabush,1 point,Mon Mar 23 15:22:16 2015 UTC,"Replacing rubber tracks is a hazzle, but not too bad. Logistics bring you a new track, pop it on there, it is man power consuming compared to steel tracks, as it has to be lifted into place. And those bad boys are a tad heavy."
TankPorn,3001rd,crimson_blindfold,2,Mon Mar 23 16:20:57 2015 UTC,"I can imagine, though what would you do mid-mission? Say it hit a rough patch or mine and the track tore. What can you do then? This thing has to carry a spare and a jack system of some sort."
TankPorn,3001rd,Peabush,2,Mon Mar 23 16:27:27 2015 UTC,We have the tools required on the vehicle for this sort of task.  All that is needed is a new track. But these tracks are very durable and require little to no maintenance. The wires inside will keep it in place. Even if torn or severed partially you can still drive until you are in a position to work on it.   I am trying to find an article where this happend.
TankPorn,3001rd,Tsiklon,1 point,Mon Mar 23 17:01:29 2015 UTC,"Ah, I mean does the vehicle carry it's own lift or crane? I can't imagine the treads being easy to handle unless you had your entire crew to install a new track.  At least the video of the bobcat excavator shows you need substantial tools (some that can not be carried in the CV9030) to lift and remove the track. I'm wondering what kind of hardware is necessary to repair. In a linked track, you could carry replacement sections and pull a cable through the suspension to reset the whole track. You may not even need to lift the tank."

TankPorn,2zyzuj,thefonztm,4,Mon Mar 23 16:23:09 2015 UTC,"Actually, several hundred of them were produced and many fought throughout the battle for France. Commanded by officers like Pierre Bilotte they proved to be excellent against the low penetration guns of early war PzI-IVs.   However, they were unable to compete with the overwhelming numerical superiority of German armor and aircraft."
TankPorn,2zyzuj,Saelyre,3,Mon Mar 23 17:30:04 2015 UTC,"This is not to imply that the B1 series of heavy tanks could be considered, ""good.""   They were unreliable, heavy due to overly complex internals, grossly expensive to make (something to the tune of half the French army's budget was feeding into this thing) and had a few critical design flaws, such as the hull mounted howitzer, and poor optical layout making it difficult to know what was going on outside, even by tank standards.   It isn't that the B1 was especially good, its that the German armor was, in large part, mediocre. Their success in France was more a story of organization than anything else. A lot of France's armored forces hadn't even been trained on modern tanks, and unsurprisingly while Germany's tanks like the Panzer 2 were fairly inadequate, they were largely dealing with FT17's."
TankPorn,2zyzuj,0000013,1 point,Mon Mar 23 19:06:32 2015 UTC,"good summary. The thing is that the B1 is still on its layout largely on the interwar period in tank design starting from tracks and ending in the weapon configuration.   The reason the blitzkrieg was succesful in france was that the french army had been waiting for and trained in teh idea that there is going to be a second round of world war one rather than a whole new world war. the germans actually pressed service a ton of french equipment to bolster their ranks- something Stalin was very, very angry about, having hoped that france weakens germany rather than provides it with a ton of motorized supply. Had the germans not captured the massive amounts of french trucks for example, operation barbarossa would have been even more horse-drawn than it ended up being."

TankPorn,2zoa0c,michaelconfoy,9,Fri Mar 20 06:14:51 2015 UTC,"The commander could not see very much through the often distorted, cloudy glass of the vision ports on his cupola and was reliant on his binocular periscope.   The decline in quality caused by the evacuation of the Izyum optical plant, doesn't apply to the entirety of the war.   Evaluation Of The T-34 And Kv Tanks By Engineers Of The Aberdeen Proving Grounds  Optic: The general opinion: the best construction in the world. Incomparable with any existing tanks or any under development.   The Panther, by contrast, had excellent optics including a pair of clear, high quality periscopes for the driver, hull gunner, and loader; a 5x magnification sight for the gunner; and a panoramic rangefinder sight for the commander. This, coupled with the 360º-view provided by the vision blocks in the commander’s cupola, gave Panther crews far better situational awareness than T-34-85 crews.   He purposely glosses over the lack of a gunner's periscope, one the most notable deficiencies of the Panther.   Once the commander has located a target, it takes between 20 and 30 seconds until the gunner can open fire. This data, which is significantly greater than that of the Sherman, stems from the absence of a periscope for the gunner.   In most tank-on-tank engagements, the outcome was determined by who held the initiative, rather than by who had the thicker armour or bigger gun. The Panther’s crew, with their superior sights, usually spotted their opponent first, giving them time to move into a good position and set up a shot.   The Sherman did a heck of a lot better job at engaging first than the Panther did.  the US Army’s Ballistic Research Lab which studied WW2 ETO tank vs tank engagements(98 of them if you were wondering) and concluded the following: The most deciding factor of who wins a tank engagement is who engages first. Crew training and other factors also played a large role. The average distance at which a US tank kills a Panzer(late IV, V, & VI) was 893 yards(816 m). Comparatively the average distance Panzers killed US vehicles as 943 yards(862 m). During Panther v. M4 engagements the Panther had a 1.1:1 advantage while on the defensive, however the M4 had an 8.4:1 advantage while on the offensive. Overall the M4 was 3.6 times as effective in combat versus the Panther.   The most important feature of the Panther’s crew compartment were the escape hatches: the driver and the mechanic had large hatches over their seats, the commander had his cupola hatch, and the loader had an escape hatch in the rear of the turret directly behind his position. Only the gunner didn’t have easy access to a hatch; he had to climb up onto the commander’s seat or scramble under the gun to get out.  Even with its larger turret, the T-34-85 was very cramped on the inside. This situation was made worse by the lack of an effective heating system, which forced crews to wear padded overcoats inside the tank. Bulky winter clothing often caught on control levers or, worse still, wouldn’t allow the crew to fit through the escape hatches (one in the front for the driver, two on the roof of the turret, and one tiny hatch in the floor of the hull) when the tank was hit.   That's pretty biased take on the Panther having one more hatch. The crew compartment heater came late into the Panther's life, October 1944 also around the same time they implemented an elevated driver's seat before then the driver could not drive with his head outside the hatch; they're some of the last modifications made to the late Ausf Gs.  The space inside T-34-85 doesn't stand out compared to other tanks of its weight class, its definitely far roomier than something like the Panzer IV.   The T-34-85 also lacked a turret basket – crewmen in the turret had to stand on ammo crates (which served as the tank’s secondary ammunition storage bins) to perform their tasks. In battle, the crew had to move to keep up with the rotating turret while trying not to trip on open crates and discarded floor panels under their feet.   The T-34-85 like most tanks has seats for the turret crew, which revolved with the turret. Only the loader had to deal with moving around but it makes it no different to the wet Shermans, which had the turret basket under the loader gutted so that ammo could be stored down low instead of in the sponsons. Sacrificing a turret basket is a trade off for more ammo stored in safer locations, the M26 Pershing didn't have one neither did the Panzer III.   That the T-34-85 outnumbered the Panther is a well-known fact, but the consequences of this imbalance for individual tank crews are often overlooked. Between the beginning of Panther production in spring 1943 and the defeat of Nazi Germany two years later, 6,000 Panther tanks were built.   The Panther never replaced the Panzer IV they were still building it till the end along with Jagdpanzers and Stugs, which formed the majority of armour built.   T-34-85: Top Speed 38 km/h (26 mph) GAZ V-12 400hp.   Oh dear, that speaks volumes on lack of research done on that article, not a single citation and a lot of Wikipedia links. Instead of using penetration data from a chart with both guns, the 30 degree German penetration data is equated to Soviet 0 degree data. The Panther's automative stats seem to come from the late Ausf D early Ausf A's of May to November 1943, since before May it hadn't received the HL 230 yet and after Novermber they governed it to 2500 rpm limiting its top speed to 46 km/h. Top speed isn't road speed though, there a reason why the Tiger isn't considered as fast as a Sherman in spite of their similar top speed. Their basically using a Panther that inherits the best traits of all those produced, with none of the negatives such as Panthers built in 1945 no longer having a seat for the loader."

TankPorn,2zkxsd,Miami33155,6,Sun Apr 5 00:25:08 2015 UTC,"Mostly by France from what I've read.   edit   While their numbers remain uncertain, Syria received around 60 Panzers that were refurbished in France during 1950-1952, followed by 50 others purchased from Czechoslovakia in 1954. A Soviet DShK machine gun on an anti-aircraft mount was retrofitted on the cupola. These were used to shell Israeli settlements below the Golan Heights, and were fired upon in 1965 during the Water War by Israeli Centurion tanks. Syria received 17 Panzer IVs from Spain; these saw combat during the Six-Day War in 1967. wiki"

TankPorn,2zkxsd,burning_phoneix,3,Thu Mar 19 17:44:02 2015 UTC,"The thing is that sherman is a product of the forties whereas PZ4 dates to the thirties- not a difference of many years but in terms of development nearly an entire generation older.  You could up-gun a sherman from its old weaponry and still retain most of the characteristics and shermans are built with sloped armor from the beginning.  PZIV in the other hand, whilst designed to be up-gunned eventually was never designed to exceed 20-ton weight limit, meaning that once the F2/G kicked in with the new gun and front armor, your tank was now very front-heavy. fast forward to the end of the war, and PZIV was absolutely obsolete.  But to be honest, it was about the only tank that was in production all the way from 1939 to 1945  in the sixties, it would be slow, lack a stabilizer, lack firepower to take on anything newer and have very little protection."

There were tens of thousands of T-34s. They basically won with numbers. The T-34 was a great tank but you're acting as though the tank was superior to say a German Panther. It definitely wasn't. Panthers had a 9 to 1 kill ratio on the T-34. By your logic the M4 Sherman out classed the German tanks as well."
TankPorn,2zkfc2,kris_random,2,Fri Mar 20 01:44:59 2015 UTC,"He said it outclassed everything the Germans had ""at the time"". The T-34 was introduced in 1940, three years before the Panther.  It outclassed the Panzer IV variant at the time which had only a short barreled 7.5cm L/24 gun designed to fire HE and not fight tanks.  The only thing that could reliably stop T-34s and KV-1s in the early days of Barbarossa was the 88 Flak gun."

The tanks where only build to last 1 month since by that time they where shot by enemy fire anyway. The only way they stood a chance was to attack with enough tanks so that the Germans where not fast enough to shoot them all. If u are unable to penetrate the front of an enemy tank u can't be a successful tank.
TankPorn,2zkfc2,VaultBoy90,3,Fri Mar 20 17:38:52 2015 UTC,"If u are unable to penetrate the front of an enemy tank u can't be a successful tank.   Which is why the German Panzers were completely unsuccessful in the Battle of France.  Also why the Battle of Arracourt ended the way it did, with 75mm M3 armed Shermans fighting against Panthers.  Front armour isn't everything, there's still such as thing as sides and rear which is why in spite of its better upper glacis (140mm LoS) the Panther took less hits to knock out than the Tiger. The general rule is that the frontal 60 degree arc accounts for less than half of all hits taken.  But even then... The T-34-85's ZiS-S-53 can penetrate the front turret armour of the Panther. The Tiger's hull on the otherhand could be penetrated from 1000 m.   http://chris-intel-corner.blogspot.be/2012/07/wwii-myths-t-34-best-tank-of-war.html?m=1   That article downright plagiarizes this page, which is in essence just a cherry picked version of this book.   Longer review by Cookie Sewell.  But really chris intel is considered mostly a joke. It completely ignores the distinction between a Soviet and a German loss, which I already posted and assumes that all those BTs, T-26, T-60, T-70 magically turned into T-34s."

TankPorn,2zgcce,BeondTheGrave,3,Wed Mar 18 15:41:12 2015 UTC,"Do modern tanks even use pure HE anymore?

TankPorn,2zgcce,A_Certain_Anime_Baby,1 point,Thu Mar 19 12:42:19 2015 UTC,They're soviet HE-FRAG rounds
TankPorn,2zgcce,SapperBomb,4,Thu Mar 19 14:01:45 2015 UTC,http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/125mm_he-frag_OF-19.JPG  http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/14/125mm_he-frag_of-26.JPG  Your gonna say your positive about a few fleeting frames of an incoming round when it is more likely that it's a HE-FRAG round that looks alot very similar to the HEAT. The T72 carries twice as many HE rounds than HEAT in the standard battle load out. I'd also say that it's more likely that the tank is firing at a soft target or dug in troops than at an armored vehicle which HEAT rounds are designed for. If I had to make a quick threat assessment based on those few frames I would say it's HE. As part of my job is understanding the difference between ammunition I wouldn't risk my life and reputation based on this limited information.
TankPorn,2zgcce,pavester,4,Wed Mar 18 19:03:58 2015 UTC,"Here is a frame from the video showing the round and fin count. As you can see it has 6 fins.   And now, here is the 3OF26 HE-FRAG-FS pic 2 round, the most widely used HE-FRAG-FS round in use. Only 4 fins are used.   Thus leading to the conclusion of the round being fired in the gif being a 3BK19 HEAT-FS round or similar HEAT-FS round used by the 125mm smoothbore cannon that equips the T-72."
TankPorn,2zgcce,A_Certain_Anime_Baby,4,Wed Mar 18 19:39:32 2015 UTC,I'm basing my assessment on the shadows that form a ring around the base of the penetrator that would otherwise be absent if the shape of the warhead was that of the HE-FRAG rounds. You're also assuming that the crew is carrying a proper load of ammunition that would otherwise be seen under normal battle conditions put there by adequately trained crews. This is not a given under the circumstances in syria. The crews are poorly trained and load their tanks overwhelmingly with HEAT and HE-frag rounds. Regardless of what a properly trained crew would do you can't accurately gage the actions of poorly trained Syrian tank crews by those standards.  While it should be an HE-FRAG round the way the light shines on it in flight makes me near certain it's a HEAT round
TankPorn,2zgcce,SapperBomb,2,Wed Mar 18 19:12:06 2015 UTC,What strikes me as odd about it being a HEAT round is that the Syrian Army is hardly encountering any rebel armour. Only small amounts of captured SAA tanks. Why would they be using a majority of HEAT when they would obviously find more use in a HEF round. The Syrian Army is not the greatest trained but I'm sure the crews have an understanding of the weapons effects that they use.
TankPorn,2zgcce,A_Certain_Anime_Baby,3,Wed Mar 18 19:24:52 2015 UTC,"They balance between HEAT and HE-FRAG, but HEAT shells aren't useless against infantry particularly if they're behind walls or even multiple walls which is often the case in urban areas where the SAA and it's associates operate. The shaped charge can go through structures with ease and it has an explosive / minor fragmentation effect to it"
TankPorn,2zgcce,pavester,1 point,Wed Mar 18 19:33:04 2015 UTC,"Even if a HEAT round is intended for anti-armor uses,  they'll contain some amount of HE and produce shrapnel.  You also have to think that before the civil war in Syria, the Syrian military was one of the top 5 countries with the most main battle tanks with ~3500 tanks, Russia at 20,500+ tanks was first, China was second with 6800+ tanks and the US in 3rd with 5800+ tanks.  As such they would have a massive supply of various tank ammunition stockpiled, primarily due to the Arab-Israeli conflicts in the pass."
TankPorn,2zgcce,SapperBomb,1 point,Sun Mar 29 07:39:12 2015 UTC,"For sure. But a HEAT round has a fraction of the high explosive that an HE round has, just enough to collapse the liner and propel it and the casing of a heat round is alot thinner so the fragmentation effect is smaller. It's still there tho"
TankPorn,2zgcce,pavester,1 point,Sun Mar 29 14:29:16 2015 UTC,"It's a HEAT-FS round, you can see in the gif the roung has a flat front with pointed tip in the middle....The exact design of most HEAT rounds used by T-** tanks."
TankPorn,2zgcce,InfiniteApathy,-1,Wed Mar 18 19:20:44 2015 UTC,It is HE of some flavor. At first glance it appears to be a base bleed shell but I believe its just atmospheric disturbance from it's speed.

TankPorn,2zgams,rangamatchstick,1 point,Wed Mar 18 11:10:59 2015 UTC,"While that's true, I doubt even the best armored tank on the modern battlefield would survive being struck by a 1,000 lb object dropped from the air, we're talking about somewhere like 10 million ft lbs of kinetic energy."
TankPorn,2zgams,rangamatchstick,3,Wed Mar 18 11:15:59 2015 UTC,"yeh true, maybe from the front (maybe) but I would expect the kinetic energy of a tank round, even just a standard AP to be greater than even a 500kg bomb due to the velocity (remember kinetic energy equals HALF mass multiplied by velocity SQUARED)."
TankPorn,2zgams,ironflesh,3,Wed Mar 18 11:22:47 2015 UTC,"The M829A3 120-mm APFSDS penetrator weighs 22 lbs and leaves the muzzle at 5,100 feet per second, that gives us 9 million ft lbs.  A 1,014 lb Mark 83 bomb traveling at say 800 feet per second would have just over 10 million ft lbs.  Naturally the much lower sectional density and softer material would not result in the same levels of penetration, but the hammer blow from such an impact would definitely put a tank out of action."

TankPorn,2zdw0c,WhiteRevan,1 point,Wed Mar 18 00:01:20 2015 UTC,The angle is the real issue. It seems like the turret is turned further than it is because of the angling of the side turret.

TankPorn,2zdw0c,WerdnaS,2,Tue Mar 17 22:45:28 2015 UTC,"What's with the Leopard 2 style turret ""sharpness"" for want of a better word."
TankPorn,2zdw0c,Tsiklon,2,Tue Mar 17 22:53:16 2015 UTC,"In short: you are wrong.  Long form: the stridsvagen 122 is a leopard 2a5 derivative, and shares the identifying features of that model. Most notably, the 2a5 features wedge shaped spaced armor mounted to the fron of the turret. No model of the Abrams features anything similar. In addition, leopard 2's commander viewports are partially embedded in the front of the turret, which is visible in this photo. The abram's commander periscope is mounted on the roof.   Now let's move to the hull. The leopard 2 has a sloping edge between the upper and lower glacis. The Abrams has a sharp angle.  And these are just the major identifying features.  Edit: chances are you are being sarcastic, but I figured I would provide this anyway."
TankPorn,2zdw0c,zdude1858,8,Wed Mar 18 00:47:42 2015 UTC,I know that it isn't an Abrams. I just thought I'd try to be humorous by referencing the label on the side of the tank that you can see if you zoom in on the photo.

TankPorn,2z8pkw,3rdweal,3,Mon Mar 16 15:44:32 2015 UTC,It's beautiful
TankPorn,2z8pkw,NTeC,7,Mon Mar 16 16:55:40 2015 UTC,I'd hate to be the guy who has to get out of the tank to use it in the hopes of hitting a plane.  Are there any statistics showing how effective (or ineffective) AA MGs on tanks were during WWII?
TankPorn,2z8pkw,airborneleaf,9,Mon Mar 16 19:54:11 2015 UTC,"I would take a stab and say it wasn't very effective, the British machine guns took, on average, 4 and a half thousand rounds to bring down a German plane. So I'm going to assume the MG34 on a Panther for the AA role, unless the gunner was EXTREMELY lucky, didn't fair very well"
TankPorn,2z8pkw,Brynjolf-of-Riften,8,Mon Mar 16 20:36:15 2015 UTC,Wow now that's a statistic.
TankPorn,2z8pkw,KLDzzz,2,Mon Mar 16 23:38:36 2015 UTC,"Considering the MG42 fired some 1200 rpm I would imagine that number would be higher for Germany. All things considered 4,500 rounds per plane is really low."
TankPorn,2z8pkw,maxout2142,2,Tue Mar 17 15:27:34 2015 UTC,But from a tank? You're not gonna be knocking Spitfires out of the sky very often
TankPorn,2z8pkw,Brynjolf-of-Riften,8,Tue Mar 17 16:18:30 2015 UTC,Limited effectiveness.   Their point was more about giving them something rather than a highly effective AA platform.
TankPorn,2z8pkw,MdB1,6,Mon Mar 16 23:04:42 2015 UTC,"I suppose the AA MG was mostly for deterring enemy planes instead of actually destroying it. An enemy aircraft how unlikely a fatal hit may be, probably wouldn't stick around when bullets start flying around it."
TankPorn,2z8pkw,SMIDSY,4,Mon Mar 16 21:45:59 2015 UTC,"A 7.92mm MG is a bit of a stretch against a late WW2 aircraft, certainly with the MG34's blistering rate of fire you would have a good chance of scoring a couple of hits, but actually bringing down the offending machine would be very unlikely unless you scored a very lucky hit.  Then again, there is such a thing as volume fire:   The key to success in engaging enemy air is to put out a high volume of fire. The more bullets a unit can put in the sky, the greater the chance the enemy will fly into them. Even if these fires do not hit the enemy, throwing up a wall of lead in the sky can intimidate enemy pilots, ultimately breaking off their attack or distracting them from taking proper aim. One of the most important points about volume fire is that once the lead distance is estimated, you must aim at the estimated aiming point and fire at that single point until the aircraft has flown past that point. Maintain the aiming point, not the lead distance. Once you start firing, do not adjust your weapon."
TankPorn,2z8pkw,P-01S,2,Tue Mar 17 01:33:51 2015 UTC,"On German tanks, the MG on the commander's cupola could be fired from a person sticking out of the hatch. The position in this photo allows for more comfortable movement while tracking the aircraft.  As for the effectiveness of such weapons, all I can say for sure is that it is better than nothing."
TankPorn,2z8pkw,CannibalFruit,4,Mon Mar 16 21:25:11 2015 UTC,"It expends ammo, so... it is not necessarily better than nothing."
TankPorn,2z8pkw,MdB1,2,Tue Mar 17 00:09:11 2015 UTC,It also requires a trained man or two to be standing on a target rather than having their head down in cover. Worse than nothing in my opinion.
TankPorn,2z8pkw,P-01S,2,Tue Mar 17 04:24:02 2015 UTC,They were never meant to take out enemy planes. Its intended purpose is to deter the enemy pilot from diving on their tank.
TankPorn,2z8pkw,P-01S,2,Tue Mar 17 02:49:52 2015 UTC,"I've always wondered, how come during that era of warfare anti-aircraft MG's and cannons were fitted with those larger, round sights (as seen attached to the MG34's barrel in this picture) instead of using standard iron-sights?"
TankPorn,2z8pkw,hopsafoobar,6,Mon Mar 16 21:43:37 2015 UTC,Standard iron sights are useless when dealing with a fast target maneuvering in three dimensions
TankPorn,2z8pkw,MdB1,1 point,Mon Mar 16 22:02:51 2015 UTC,Some might say the anti-aircraft sights were also useless... At least against WWII planes.
TankPorn,2z7xy7,3rdweal,3,Mon Mar 16 10:53:02 2015 UTC,x/post /r/DestroyedTanks  source  An 88mm entry hole can be seen in the up-armored section on the side.

TankPorn,2z7xy7,Gaping_Maw,2,Mon Mar 16 14:22:20 2015 UTC,Would that be a gruesome job?
TankPorn,2z7xy7,grospoliner,3,Mon Mar 16 14:55:29 2015 UTC,"Given the location and the angle it is on, it doesn't look like anyone was actually killed. The shot probably knocked out the engine and the crew would have abandoned it since they were under fire from a superior weapon. A lot of armored vehicles have to be abandoned because of mobility or mission kills (damaged engine, track, or guns).  At worst the angle is misleading and the commander or loader was killed/injured.  Edit: Here's a side view of the Sherman for comparison. The plate is definitely situated in line with the commander side on."
TankPorn,2z7xy7,bamaster,1 point,Mon Mar 16 16:34:21 2015 UTC,If you look at the picture you posted of the cutaway the applique armor is specifically positioned to protect the ammunition storage.
TankPorn,2z7xy7,grospoliner,1 point,Mon Mar 16 20:06:17 2015 UTC,Yes it is. Considering the turret is still on the M4 I'm guessing the ammunition didn't explode.

TankPorn,2z7xy7,grospoliner,1 point,Mon Mar 16 23:12:38 2015 UTC,I suppose. There also doesn't seem to be any scorch marks. If it did they did a good job of cleaning it first.
TankPorn,2z7xy7,TheHIV123,3,Mon Mar 16 23:19:42 2015 UTC,"There is still white paint on the gun mount, unless they repainted it before they took it out that tank didn't brew up."
TankPorn,2z7xy7,Perry87,2,Tue Mar 17 02:17:45 2015 UTC,Yeah I think you're  right. Maybe they expended the ammunition from that area before it was hit
TankPorn,2z7xy7,LeuCeaMia,1 point,Mon Mar 16 23:21:32 2015 UTC,"Considering that normally ammo would be stored behind those uparmored sections, it's damn lucky it didn't brew up. Either it missed the ammo by a hair or that particular rack was empty."
TankPorn,2z7xy7,0000013,3,Mon Mar 16 19:24:35 2015 UTC,"British had at least back in the first world war a strict policy that tank salvage crews were not allowed to talk about their job to live tankers. because ""im the guy that wields the spatula when we get teh rest of the crew out, and joe here has the hose"" isnt goood for morale."
TankPorn,2z7xy7,QuerulousPanda,2,Mon Mar 16 16:49:28 2015 UTC,"I can't even imagine how horrendous that job would have been.   What may be worse though is if they missed a spot and the tank went back into service and the crew found a piece of someone, or worse, smelled them. That probably happened with some frequency too... brutal."
TankPorn,2z7xy7,AdwokatDiabel,3,Mon Mar 16 17:48:01 2015 UTC,That wouldn't happen.  The tank would be disassembled and rebuilt and then re-painted inside and out.

TankPorn,2z481l,AWildDiggerNick,4,Sun Mar 15 16:29:53 2015 UTC,"Might be a stupid question, but what are the Navy doing with tanks?"
TankPorn,2z481l,mrparsnip,3,Sun Mar 15 19:58:41 2015 UTC,From this site:  The Royal Navy's role in tank development may seem incongruous but was in fact merely an extension of the role they had played thus far in the use of armoured cars.  The navy had deployed squadrons of armoured cars to protect Allied airstrips in Belgium against enemy attack.  It was this experience that Churchill drew upon when offering his department's support for the 'landship'.
TankPorn,2z481l,FoxtrotZero,2,Sun Mar 15 20:02:34 2015 UTC,"If you can find it I recommend the book 'band of brigands'. It deals with the armoured car actions in 1914 as well as development of the tank and it's early actions.   As to why the Navy had them I would suggest it was because Churchill as head of the navy (I forget his actual title sorry) had the influence to start them working on it.   The Army and government had several men pushing the idea and Haig became a supporter once he realised its potential. This was partially what caused the initial failures on the Somme, Haig wanted what was available rather than waiting for a sufficient force and he spread them out piecemeal against the tank commanders advice.   Edit: clarity"

TankPorn,2z3vxs,kombatminipig,2,Mon Mar 16 01:24:05 2015 UTC,"Hey, don't knock it...it would probably have done its job very well had things gone down that path. It's very much a tank destroyer and not an MBT. The while point of the design was to hide in forested terrain, where it could dig itself in thanks to the built in digger blades, take shots at enemy armor and then get the hell out, utilizing the feature that it went as quickly in reverse as forwards.   It also had the most adorable way of pooping out spent shell casings."
TankPorn,2z3vxs,MarsMJD,1 point,Wed Mar 18 10:44:34 2015 UTC,"But the problem isn't the tank destroyer design, its the fact that aiming the gun requires the entire tank to move. Shooting out the suspension or the tracks on one of those things is enough to completely disable it's combat abilities. Or hitting a bad bump will potentially disable your vertical elevation.   Plus this thing literally cant move and shoot at the same time, as it requires the same components to do both, forcing the operators to make trade-offs no matter what. Even a world war 2 stug could drive backwards and still hit targets in an arc in front of it (albeit poorly). With this thing, driving backwards would restrict it's targets to directly in front of it. If it tries to aim left while driving, it will start veering to the right. And that's just the horizontal traverse. The vertical is even more fucked as every single bump in the road will bounce the barrel as there is no possibility for aim stabilization when the suspension controls the vertical aiming and the barrel is fixed to the entire hull. Every vibration will affect the aim.   Not to mention the problems with maintaining a hidden position when aiming requires the entire tank to move. You would quite likely give away your position before you even fired a shot.  There is a reason why this is the only tank ever made like this, and why it was replaced with a turreted design.  I will admit though that the ""pooping"" out shells is pretty adorable :P"

TankPorn,2z0pvw,IndonesianGuy,3,Sat Mar 14 15:15:32 2015 UTC,"I should hope so; those tanks were first mass produced in 1972, and (Correct me if I'm wrong) production ceased when the T-80 came out.  Given that it was designed in the days when armor meant nothing thanks to HEAT ammo being able to penetrate any reasonable thickness of armor, the T-72 had no real armor to speak of when compared to its predecessors, and was on par with its 'playmates' such as the Leopard 1.  Also like them, it was very fast, and very accurate.  Now, given I'm sure that Syria took receipt of these machines fairly early on, you are talking about what, ten generations of crew?  Now, not to be a complete know-it-all ass, I'm sure you were referencing within the scope of this conflict, to which I have a Tom Clancy quote which could not be more accurate with ANY tank of that day and age: ""the T-72; that's an easy way to kill four people"".  So yes, I wholly agree that this tank is on its second, or even fourth, crew since the beginning of the war.  Edit: as /u/yosp pointed out, the T-72 and T-80 do have armor to speak of, and the abilities of the tank are more down to the crews."
TankPorn,2z0pvw,HorrificAnalInjuries,8,Sat Mar 14 15:35:12 2015 UTC,"The T-72s frontal armor and turret armor are actually quite formidable. I think the main weakness of this tank is the fact that the ammo is not stowed separate from the crew.    All in all a tanks performance is best judged by the training the crew received. Take the T-80 you mentioned. The tank had very good armor protection and lots of technological improvements. So when they were sent into Grozny, Chechnya they were expected to crush the rebellion. Turned out the T-80 performed terribly in Grozny. Militants that were armed with RPGs that cost a fraction of the T-80 were able to take them out like shooting fish in a barrel. All of this went back to the crews training. Russia was using 18-20 year old conscripts that had insufficient training and got slaughtered. Poor tactics and training led to their demise."
TankPorn,2z0pvw,yosp,1 point,Sat Mar 14 16:33:06 2015 UTC,Poor tactics and training led to their demise.   I'm ignorant of these matters. Did they rush ahead of their infantry cover? Or what tactics would have protected them?
TankPorn,2z0pvw,ExdigguserPies,2,Sat Mar 14 21:37:34 2015 UTC,It was a mixture of the tankers not being familiar with their equipment (Chechnya was the first combat operation which the T-80 was fielded) and also the tanks had no infantry cover which is tactical suicide. The T-80 also wasn't suited for urban combat.
TankPorn,2z0pvw,yosp,3,Sat Mar 14 23:26:50 2015 UTC,"Probably driving over hill and dale (i.e. breaking cover) would be a very large killer of tanks, as a spotted tank is one soon killed (Unless it's something like a Leo 2/Challenger 2/Abrams, then it's just annoyed).  In general, you want to keep your tank(s) largely out of line-of-sight of enemy forces until they've been engaged by infantry, to which then you use the armor for a spot of surprise buttsecks.  The T-72 and T-80 (and any tank from either line, really) both are low profile machines, for a tank at any rate.  The Commander's hatch is hardly above the engine deck of most western tanks when you are comparing height between the two.  Combine this with their speed and mobility (and a good, well-trained crew), a Russian tank of either line can get to some unexpected areas and cause a lot of havok.  This can also work in reverse: when the tank encounters a threat that is too great for it to undo in one or two shots it can very easily, and very quickly, get the hell out.  Relocate, reload, and reappear from a new location, get a shot off, relocate, reload...  You get the drill.  In short; the best tactic for tanks in general is to remain unseen until it is too late, then disappear again."

The only tank that fits that description is the S-Tank.   Unless it's something like a Leo 2/Challenger 2/Abrams, then it's just annoyed   No tank is completely immune and most modern tanks have similar levels of protection.   a Russian tank of either line can get to some unexpected areas and cause a lot of havok. This can also work in reverse: when the tank encounters a threat that is too great for it to undo in one or two shots it can very easily, and very quickly, get the hell out. Relocate, reload, and reappear from a new location, get a shot off, relocate, reload... You get the drill.   Early T-72s have an awesomely bad reverse speed of 4.18 kph..."

Communication and electronic systems are nothing other tanks dont already have, and the main NATO tanks (Abrams, Leo 2 and Challenger 2) have all recently undergone upgrades in this sector, and/or undergo constant upgrades, so their comparable systems are at least as good, if not better.  It does have nice APS/soft kill systems which its competitors lack, however.   T-14   We'll have to wait and see about this one. Looks like it could be a good tank, definitely next gen if the Russians dont skimp on the specs.   Although the notion of Unmanned ground vehicles outside of little drones for infantry use is absurd.

What is known is that the PLA can always add more; their turret design revolves around the concept of add-on armour blocks. This is what a ZTZ99A turret without armour blocks looks like: https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7461/15990957562_8255605837_o.jpg  https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7561/15805903307_f331a64a26_o.jpg  As for the suspension system, the ZTZ99's suspension is a hybrid torsion bar and pneumatic system as a compromise between cost and smoothness; it's not as advanced as the Type 10 or K2's fully pneumatic suspension but it's nowhere near ""massively outdated"". The ZTZ99A has a new chassis and possibly new powerplant, it's reasonable to assume the chassis remains a hybrid tor-pneu system but it's anyone's guess at this stage.   No one has identified any APS on the ZTZ99 or 99A; only a laser soft-kill system has been seen. That's not to say China hasn't been developing one, but none have been put to use right now."

There is also the argument that drones are pretty rare on the battlefield, and there are really no decently sized conflicts in which they are used, so one could easily deduce that there is not much point at the moment to hacking them unless they pose a significant risk, which few, if any, do.

TankPorn,2z1a3w,AdwokatDiabel,5,Sat Jun 20 09:27:26 2015 UTC,"American here, the best tank in the world today is the South Korean K2 Black Panther.  Reasons:   It leverages lessons learned from both Russian and US/NATO MBTs including the T-80 series, M1 series, and German Leopard series It has a modern auto-loading system with a high rate of fire while still protecting the crew from ammo explosions (so basically the best of a T-90 and M1A2) It's FCS system is on par or superior to most Western vehicles It's fairly lightweight at 55 tons.  I suspect this is what you get when you have a ""clean sheet"" design and incorporate new technology from the get-go.  M1A2 is about 72 tons, Leo II is about 68 tons, T-90 is 48 ton. It's armor package is a blend of composite armor and ERA.  Future variants will have nERA which should have benefits similar to ERA without the explosion.  Remember, they had access to Kontakt-5 armor as well which proves to be quite capable versus modern APFSDS ammo It's ""soft-kill"" system is unmatched by any NATO member.  Russia's T-90 series comes closest.  It has Radar Warning and Jamming systems.  Laser Warning receivers.  Smart smoke deployment systems which fire smoke in the direction of incoming lasers while also giving the crew improved responsiveness by allowing the gun to ""slew-to-threat"" Ammunition wise, it has smart beyond line of sight ammo which deploys submunitions to defeat enemy armor.  Russia and Israel have similar laser guided systems, but SK's ammo is autonomous (""fire and forget"")   tl;dr: It is the ""best"" tank because it's also the ""newest"".  It's built by a nation with considerable acumen in military arms production.  Leverages advances in armor design from Russian and US sources.  Has one of the best tank guns onboard in its longest (L55) format."

Thirdly the Merkava IV, also because of looks, the Trophy active protection system, IFV-capability and extreme focus on crew survivability.   Fourth the M1A2SEP (or whatever you want to call it).

TankPorn,2z1a3w,vlepun,5,Tue Mar 17 06:37:17 2015 UTC,"It remains a fact that the logistical side of the M1A2 is the most complex of any main battle tank currently fielded, which I consider to be a drawback no matter who fields it.   The same with the turbine engine, it requires enormous amounts of logistics and maintenance, has incredibly poor mileage and it roasts crew behind it. Ditch it and use a diesel powerpack, such as that of the Leopard 2 or LeClerc XXI.   As for the other thing: All MBT's I've listed do so to a certain degree.

There are almost 9,000 Abrams to 400 Challengers, of course the Abrams will see more combat, take more hits, and we will see more stats on how it stands up to fire. Most Abrams I've seen destroyed were not even really 'destroyed' they were immobilized and they just blew it to prevent it from going to the enemy and then friendly fire is another issue along with IEDs, I do not think many Abrams have actually been taken out by enemy fire other than IEDs. I bet if the Challenger 2 was replaced with the Abrams in terms of number and how widely deployed they were for a decade almost, you'd see very similar statistics on how they held up to enemy fire."

If the tank is stationary with its engine on, the Gas turbine in the Abrams burns almost as much fuel as it is while moving.   And tanks spend a lot of time stationary."

Just because they have been in the same wars doesn't mean they have had the same exposure.   In general that's true, but both in Iraq and Afghanistan both tanks have had their fair share of combat exposure.

I think it'd have to be the Leclerc, simply by virtue of the fact that it stands at the intersection where interesting aesthetics, unique technological innovation, functionality and my own national interests collide. :P  The 'best', of course, is a rather different question. Before you ask that, you have to ask yourself what most design bureaus or ministries of defence will ask themselves before they endeavour to even put pen to paper - what is this tank supposed to do? Where is it supposed to do it? It's only once you have a decent idea of its intended function, of the doctrine that'll direct its movements and the conditions that'll dictate its effectiveness that you can really put together a list of the things you want to see in said tank."
TankPorn,2z1a3w,Gerbils74,6,Fri Mar 20 00:37:48 2015 UTC,"I think it's a fairly even tie between the chally 2, m1a2 and Leo 2a6/7."
TankPorn,2z1a3w,0000013,3,Sun Mar 15 03:08:03 2015 UTC,"as with any ""what is the best"" questions and listings, the problem is the question itself, not the answer.  because you havent defined best- and in the question you dont really ask for best either, but favorite.  even if you define ""best"" by the crudest possible factors as a sandbox ""who would win"" the question is inane because many MBTs are designed around a predetermined set of operational requirements such as the merkava (crew survivability first, armor second, mobility last) and challenger (armor first, everything else second, ability to use HESH as the priority for armament) and T-72 (ability to crank out massive numbers with low costs and to hell with crew safety)  so if looking at the tank that is ""best"" in a theoretical sandbox where the operating costs, weight, logistics train and unit price dont matter, then the obvious ""best"" is the tank that was designed with just such an ethos in mind, the Abrams. If your looking for the best tank to use when your budget is a shoestring, anything made in the USSR. And when looking for something to close the fulda gap, then the leopard 2."

The way I handle this question any time I hear it is by stating it's all up to the situation at hand.   Looking to defend the hell out of a square of land? Look no further than the Challenger II.   Need to get somewhere fast and put down fire? Leclerc and Leopard II.   Need an MBT that is a jack-of-all-trades? Ariete and the M1 Abrams.   Fighting on a lot of hilly terrain with your MBT? Type 10.  Need a tank capable of holding it's own against the following tanks, but don't want to rely on surplus? Type 99. ('The development of the new tank was initiated in the early 1990s during the Gulf War. Western tanks had destroyed numerous Iraqi Soviet-made T-72Ms, and were superior to the most advanced tank design in the PLA at the time, the Type 90 tank. The PLA realised that the Type 90 were still no match for the Western MBT designs such as the Challenger 2 and M1A1, and initiated a project to develop a new, modern main battle tank which eventually resulted in the Type 99.')  Need to swarm that area over there and don't really care about losses? T-72.  You want to do the previous, but care about losses? T-90.   Don't mind cost and want the most advanced MBT you could buy? K2 Black Panther  Looking for an MBT that is extremely safe for the crew and is capable of also filling the role of an IFV? Merkava"
TankPorn,2z1a3w,InWadeTooDeep,3,Fri Mar 20 19:05:32 2015 UTC,"Tough to give an overall ""best"". As far as affordability probably the T-90 or one of its variants. As far as ""open range"" cold war style fighting, my vote would be the LeClerc. If we're talking about Urban Combat I vote for the Merkeva IV.   I like ""hard kill"" anti missile systems over soft kill stuff. Hard Kill has been shown to deal handily with some of the latest Russian/ExSov ATGM's and ""personal"" anti tank weapons."

TankPorn,2z1a3w,vlepun,3,Tue Mar 17 10:18:28 2015 UTC,"I think you are misinformed.   Russia has 930-1000 T90A 'Vladimir' MBTs in service as of last year  Russia has cancelled future purchases and allocated all armor funds to the Armata project, which will equip the services with 2k T14 tanks by mid 2020s  Saying the T90 is a dressed up T72 is a bit of a whitewash TBH as well, as the tank is a T72-T80 hybrid, which renders it a completely new main battle tank compared to previous versions. It even has a fundamentally different mantlet. There are many other reasons why the T90 is classified as a new main battle tank, and not a T72."
TankPorn,2z1a3w,eskimobrother319,1 point,Sat Mar 21 08:00:25 2015 UTC,"I think you are misinformed.    No, I'm not. I just didn't phrase it with enough nuance added. It was a response to the sheer number of Abrams available, which is still four times as much. Eeven taking the high estimate of 1000 T-90A, which I seriously doubt as the T-90A is reportedly too expensive to field for Russia.   Besides, Russia's mainstay tank is still the T-72 in various models."
TankPorn,2z1a3w,nucleaireagle,1 point,Mon Mar 23 14:06:00 2015 UTC,"A T90 export model, the T90S, which is the T90A essentially, is only 2 million dollars not including other estimates for fines and what not countries pay. (Which Russia doesn't have to pay) Russia has allocated 300-700 billion dollars to modernize its entire military. I will say this again, Russia is not buying anymore T90As because they have allocated their modernization funds to produce the T14 armata tank (newest Russian tank, look it up) along with an entirely new combat platform. They can easily afford to buy 2000 more within the next 3 years, but are choosing to produce 2000 T14 tanks. This can be found on the damn wikipedia page for this tank. (The T14 is currently the most modern battle tank in the world, with 20 produced for testing so far)   which is still four times as much.   Most in storage, and we all know what happens to tanks in reserve.   Besides, Russia's mainstay tank is still the T-72 in various models.   No, thats like saying the Soviet Union's main tank was the T26 and not the T34 just because the amount they have.  Also, allow me to add, the T90A incorporates features from an experimental Soviet battle tank that was never produced. Its entire turret is actually derived from this experimental tank, thats why you see such a huge difference between a T90A and say a T72. The T90A is truly an entirely different and new tank. (See: Object 187)"
TankPorn,2z1a3w,PRiles,0,Mon Mar 23 17:32:19 2015 UTC,"will say this again, Russia is not buying anymore T90As because they have allocated their modernization funds to produce the T14 armata tank (newest Russian tank, look it up) along with an entirely new combat platform.    According to Russian sources (amongst other lenta.ru, look it up) that's not true. The T-90(variant here) is underperforming and is too expensive for Russia's armed forces to field, which is why they are instead upgrading the T-72 fleet to T-72B3+ standard and are ordering more of those. It has nothing to do with a completely unproven experimental design.    No, thats like saying the Soviet Union's main tank was the T26 and not the T34 just because the amount they have.   It's not. And you used the same argument to prop up the T-90 as the mainstay tank which it is not. The T-90 is the expensive, high-end tank. The T-72 is the mainstay tank. Go look up Russia's military doctrine of today and the past."

Her Section Commander was Capt.G.Nixon and her Company Commander was Major R.O.C.Ward. No. 12 Company formed the second wave of attack in charge of the capture of the Hindenburg support line in the sector west of Flesquieres.  As the tank Deborah entered the village of Flesquieres, the leading company of the 153rd Brigade which was following the tank had to withdraw in face of sustained enemy fire. The ruins and cellars gave perfect cover to snipers and machine gunners and the tank had difficulty in locating them. After the tank had passed, they re-emerged to try and stop its progress. As D51 left the shelter of the last houses in the street, it came under fire from a field gun, and the tank was put out of action. 2/Lt Frank Heap was awarded the Military Cross for his brave efforts. The citation speaks for itself:  “In Cambrai operations near Flesquieres on November 20th 1917, he fought his tank with great gallantry and skill, leading the infantry on to five objectives. He proceeded through the village and engaged a battery of enemy field guns from which his tank received five direct hits, killing four of his crew. Although then behind the German lines he collected the remainder of his crew and conducted them in good order back to our own lines in spite of heavy machine gun and snipers fire”.  D51 Deborah was not discovered until the next day, when the Scottish infantry found it. The four crew who had been killed, were buried next to the tank. After the war the four bodies were re-interred in the Flesquieres Hill British Cemetery. The village was not retaken by the Germans until March 1918.

TankPorn,2yuiec,TankerD18,5,Fri Mar 13 05:49:00 2015 UTC,"I was on SEPs and A1s during my career, a modern A1 will smoke an enemy tank almost quick as a SEP will, as far away as a SEP will, and as accurately as a SEP will. Having been a gunner on both of them the only thing I prefer about the A2 (from the gunner's seat) is the display that lets you check out your settings and configurations without having to mess with the old calculator screen on the A1 gunner's computer panel. The only fundamental difference (at least from the crew's point of view) with the A1 and A2 SEP is that the SEP has the CITV which makes follow on shots faster. Everything else is pretty much peripheral/crew interface upgrades like improved displays and built in BFT. At this point the thermals, and BIOC the A2 has have been reverse implemented into the A1s. Now that I think about it the upgraded A1s I ended my career on had a BFT too.   With that, it's not like the A1 doesn't have the same armor, engine, and gun as the A2. They aren't obsolete by a long shot. And as far as the original M1 is concerned, they have all been upgraded to the A1 or A2 standard, or they're lawn ornaments in front of ranges and next to post welcome signs. Seriously, the only time I've ever seen the old 105mm M1 is as a decoration.  Everyone parading the glorious T-90 seems to be forgetting that the T-90 is just a modernized T-72, a second gen system. If we were looking at an uparmored and upgunned M60 we'd be on the same level here."

TankPorn,2yuiec,ddosn,-4,Sat Mar 14 16:51:15 2015 UTC,"So lets have a look here:  Type 99 - Hybrid copy of the Abrams, Merkava and T-72. Just look at its specs. It really isnt anything that special. Looks nice though and is a slightly above average third gen tank.  Arjun: India's copy of the Challenger 1. Decent tank. Typical 3rd Gen.  Type 10: High Tech copy of the Leopard 2, with fancy armour.  C1 Ariete: Nice little Italian tank. Generally average Third gen MBT.  T-90: Good, above average gen3.5 MBT.  Leclerc: Gen 3.5 tank. Above average, but nothing fantastic.  Merkava: Latest version is a good gen 3.5 MBT, the lesser versions are average Gen 3's.  Challenger 2. Fortress on wheels. No known AT weapon short of air-based AT, huge IEDs (think large dairy chains) or artillery based can take this mother out. Best protection by far against non-sabot attacks by far, very far. It also has one of the best if not the best defense against penetrators as well. Challenger 2 CLIP is a fantastic Gen 3.5 MBT, more than a match for any of the other tanks listed there, even if it isnt autoloaded.  Leopard 2: Good gen 3.5 tank if you are using the very latest versions. Older versions are average Gen3. Nothing special. As the Israeli's said ""The leopard 2 is a good tank, unless you want to go to war"".  Abrams: M1 is massively outdated, M1A1 is not far behind. M1A2 is aging as well. Probably the best Gen 3 tank out there.  EDIT: I guess 2 people are salty that i 'insulted' their precious Abrams and Leopard 2....... But face it, they are aging tanks, and the only one of them that has had any extensive upgrades at all to keep it in line with the technology is the Leopard 2.  The Abrams has had some upgrades, but not much. Hell, most of its armour is first gen Chobham, which is greatly outdated by modern composite armour standards.  By example, the Challenger 2 has state of the art pretty much everything, even its electronics, communications and computing/targeting systems were recently upgraded across the board for all tanks. There is also rumour that the Dorchester armour is continuously upgraded with better materials when they become available, which it could be as we still know jack shit about what is actually in dorchester armour."

TankPorn,2yuiec,n00bsk00lbus,1 point,Thu Mar 19 23:06:28 2015 UTC,"[Citation needed]   No citation needed at all, I simply dismissed the claim your claim since you presented no evidence.    Also, during the gulf wars, the Challenger 2 was beings used for operations as much as the Abrams (including the Abrams HA version) and was getting hit just as much, by the same weapons with the same regularity.  5% of the Abrams were sent home destroyed or critically damaged. No Challenger 2s were lost to enemy fire.   Gulf WARS? The GW1 was in 1991 and the first Challenger 2 was produced in 1993.   Set back for repair due to damage and lost to enemy fire are two different benchmarks. You are using a very wide benchmark for the M1 (sent back for repair) and a very narrow one for the Challenger 2 (destroyed by enemy fire).   It's no secret that the Challenger 2 has a very well protected turret, but the hull protection is not nearly as good and there is a large weak spot around the drivers hatch.    Also, its gun is pretty much the same as comparable NATO tanks. All are 120mm, all have pretty much comparable ammo etc etc.   LOL no, not even close. The Challenger 2 uses two piece ammo that limits the length of the projectile, photographs of these projectiles are available and you can estimate the dimensions to reasonable precision. Armor perforation is very heavily dependent on length/diameter ratio of the projectile. While you can can have a high L/D ratio while being length limited your projectile will be very light and since practical chemical energy guns are limited to under 2000 m/s muzzle velocity your projectiles momentum will be very low limiting perforation. There are published equations that describe the perforation of RHA targets by long rods (Lanz-Odermatt equation), in pretty much every model for perforation the importance of L/D is clear. Even taking account the L30's barrel length advantage there is simply no way the L27A1 out of an L30 can compete with an M829A3 out of an M256.  Rifled guns also suck, except for a very specific and special low twist ""rifled"" gun that has never been produced as far as I can tell. They are more expensive to produce (obviously). They wear out faster than smoothbores. They require slipband obturators for HEAT and APFSDS projectiles. The slipband obturators are not perfect and the rounds still have a significant rotational velocity, this means valuable (linear) kinetic energy is lost to rotational energy. The slipband obturators also complicate sabot design meaning losses due to a heavier sabot.    Care to elaborate?   The sight does not have 2 axis stabilization like the M1A2 or Leopard 2's IR sight. It sits on top of the gun and when a fire control solution is fed to the gun it causes the sight picture to jump in both elevation and traverse. It also has a large parallax with the LRF. To my knowledge this sight has not been upgraded and is not of the same quality as the sights on the latest M1A2 models.   Only the Challenger 2 does not have an CITV last I checked which is a major disadvantage.   The charges are stored in the hull, below the turret ring.   Which are still inside the crew compartment or the loader would not be able to access them.   All tanks can have their armor perforated even by handheld AT weapons, relying on armor over other survivability methods like good safe ammo storage is probably the most foolish thing you can do in tank design. Most tanks are lost due to ammunition fires."
TankPorn,2yuiec,ddosn,1 point,Fri Mar 20 02:47:29 2015 UTC,"It's no secret that the Challenger 2 has a very well protected turret, but the hull protection is not nearly as good and there is a large weak spot around the drivers hatch.   The front of the hull is as well protected as the turret. The RPG29 that supposedly penned the front hull actually went under and penned the (at the time) unarmoured belly that was just plain RHS.  That has since changed. In the first upgrade pack, the belly armour was upgraded (read: packed full of dorchester armour) to such a degree it has comparable protection as the turret and front hull.  The sides of the hull are also very well defended, maybe not as much as the front or any side of the turret, but still very well armoured (took a direct point blank hit from a 130mm cannon with no damage and also took MILAN AT missiles to the flank and no damage either. MILANS can take out Abrams). This protection was since upped even further with the addition of dorchester side skirts and then again with the inclusion of ERA, double protection for urban warfare.  The rear third of the hull and turret were up-armoured with bar armour and the side of the turret got extra blocks of dorchester attached.  You seem to be comparing a 1993 vanilla Challenger 2 to a 2015 M1A1 HA/M1A2 SEP. At least use a Challenger 2 Streetfighter as comparison material.  If the Challenger 2 really was inferior to the Abrams, the UK would never have commissioned them as the whole reason the UK didnt take the Abrams or the Leopard 2 was because they did not fit the British armoured doctrine of Armour first, then firepower, then mobility.  Regardless of what upgrades came later, the Challenger 2 vanilla first production has superior armour all round compared to vanilla Leopard 2s and Abrams. This means it has a higher base to work from when adding further armour, so it is far from 'obvious' that the Challenger 2 has inferior armour to the Abrams and Leopard 2 (the former of which still only uses Chobham MK1 as its armour base, not the Dorchester Chobham MK2 like the Challenger 2 and the latter of which uses perforated armour as its base).   LOL no, not even close.   So explain why the C2 has the longest range tank kills of any modern tank. Why it has comparable or, in many cases, superior accuracy. How it managed to destroy two tanks with 1 shot, the shot clean going through one entire tank before going through another and burying itself in the second tanks engine block, and this occurred at ranges other tanks can only take out one tank max.   Even taking account the L30's barrel length advantage there is simply no way the L27A1 out of an L30 can compete with an M829A3 out of an M256.   So you are comparing a good DU penetrator with the absolute best out there, not the rough NATO average which is what I mentioned?  No other NATO nations other than the US and UK use DU, which time and again has shown it is superior to Tungsten and other penetrator matierals. This means that, whilst the UK CHARM 3 might not be as good as the US M829A3, it is at the very least as good as, if not superior to, most if not all other NATO rounds.  And the Charm 3 is not a small round.   Rifled guns also suck   See above. For quickness: ""So explain why the C2 has the longest range tank kills of any modern tank.

The sight does not have 2 axis stabilization like the M1A2 or Leopard 2's IR sight. It sits on top of the gun and when a fire control solution is fed to the gun it causes the sight picture to jump in both elevation and traverse. It also has a large parallax with the LRF. To my knowledge this sight has not been upgraded and is not of the same quality as the sights on the latest M1A2 models. Only the Challenger 2 does not have an CITV last I checked which is a major disadvantage.   The challenger 2 in its first upgrade package had an entire optical and electronic upgrade and overhaul, which was furthered in the second upgrade package. Also, as the IR sight has not negatively effected the Challenger 2's combat performance and I have found absolutely no mention of the problems you mentioned elsewhere, i can only assume you are full of hot air on this one, sorry.   Which are still inside the crew compartment or the loader would not be able to access them. All tanks can have their armor perforated even by handheld AT weapons, relying on armor over other survivability methods like good safe ammo storage is probably the most foolish thing you can do in tank design. Most tanks are lost due to ammunition fires.   And not one Challenger 2 has been lost in combat, other than a blue-on-blue incident when a friendly round bounced off an open hatch and exploded inside the tank, which caused an ammo explosion. However, any tank (even the Abrams) would have ignited as what caused the ignition was a HESH round exploding inside the tank, which would have rendered any ammo protection moot as the round is designed to bust buildings, bunkers and light vehicles (and infantry)."

No Western MBT has a hull as well protected as the turret, tanks are designed to fight from hull down positions.    Regardless of what upgrades came later, the Challenger 2 vanilla first production has superior armour all round compared to vanilla Leopard 2s and Abrams.   You are comparing a tank that entered service in the 90's to tanks that entered service in the late 70s early 80s. The M1A2 is a more fair comparison given the date it entered service.    (the former of which still only uses Chobham MK1 as its armour base, not the Dorchester Chobham MK2 like the Challenger 2 and the latter of which uses perforated armour as its base).   US and British composite armor development programs diverged a long time ago. The M1A2 does not use ""vanilla"" Chobham.    So explain why the C2 has the longest range tank kills of any modern tank.   With the statistically relevant sample size of one. Also it was a C1 that did that shot.    Why it has comparable or, in many cases, superior accuracy.   Greek tank trials beg to differ... time for the propellant excuses.

This means that, whilst the UK CHARM 3 might not be as good as the US M829A3, it is at the very least as good as, if not superior to, most if not all other NATO rounds.   DU alloy is superior but not massively superior to WHA. CHARM 3 doesn't stack up that well to a DM-53 fired out of an L44 or L55 either, it's simply too short.

To my knowledge the Challenger 2 in British service has had only one version of the TOGS II sight. It still lacks a CITV as well. Challenger 2 has only seen combat in Iraq and Afghanistan, if we benchmark tanks by those two conflicts than we might as well get rid of long barreled guns since AT is useless against guys who's newest tank is from the 70s.    And not one Challenger 2 has been lost in combat, other than a blue-on-blue incident when a friendly round bounced off an open hatch and exploded inside the tank, which caused an ammo explosion. However, any tank (even the Abrams) would have ignited as what caused the ignition was a HESH round exploding inside the tank, which would have rendered any ammo protection moot as the round is designed to bust buildings, bunkers and light vehicles (and infantry).   Challenger 2 hasn't seen major mechanized combat, how well you did in COIN ops is not really a good measure, tanks aren't even designed for COIN. How many Challengers were in country vs how many M1s? You think that may have skewed the stats a little?  The M1 has ammo stored in blow off panel equipped compartments, an ammunition fire would not enter the fighting compartment, this has been tested many times.

During the Iraq war, in the areas where the British and US were both deployed together, there were roughly similar numbers of Abrams and C2s. Both tanks were going all the time.

It was hit by the same weapons, with the same if not higher intensity. The C2 was hit with weapons that easily scrapped Abrams tanks (MILAN, DRAGON and other ATGMs, as well as the latest versions of the RPG) and still the C2 lost no units, whilst the Abrams lost 5% of their number.   The M1 has ammo stored in blow off panel equipped compartments, an ammunition fire would not enter the fighting compartment, this has been tested many times. There is no debate here, the M1's ammo storage system is much safer.    You didnt listen to what I said.

If you try and fire the wrong type of ammo out of a handgun, yes it may work but it was be far less effective than firing the correct ammo.  If someone fire the wrong ammo out of a gun and then tried to use that as an example that the gun is shit, then they'd be laughed out of the room. Same with the Greeks using the wrong ammunition in the C2's cannon.  You dont get debris and cannon damage from using the right ammo.....

Seems you were right, the old sights did suffer from some negative effects (mainly due to how old they are, obsolescence and technical support issues). Whilst they weren't serious, the optical suite is set for a full upgrade. The electronics have already been done.  Other projects that are in the works is further upgrading the C2 to have top of the line hydrogas suspension (better than its hydropneumatic suspension at the moment) and upgrading the Perkins engine to 1500hp.  The Warrior is also getting an overhaul by a combination of General Dynamics and Lockheed Martin. Upgraded armour, weapons, electronics, optics, a new 40mm autocannon (or a greatly upgraded 30mm one) and new AT and AA missile pods.   Unless this is a new development or you are referring to the Challenger 2E, no it doesn't. The commander's optical sight is a SAGEM VS580-10 which has a LRF but no IR.

Tanks like the Abrams, C2 and Leo2 were not just designed to be defensive mobile bunkers. They were designed to lead charges as well.   Most good hull down positions are going to expose little to no part of the hull. It is vital for a Challenger 2 to assume a good hull down position because it's upper hull has that vulnerable drivers hatch spot. The Challenger 2's (and Leo 2's) armor is overall more biased towards the turret than the Abrams'. Both the Challenger 2 and Leopard 2 have hull ammo storage inside the fighting compartment, the idea here is that since they will mostly be fighting from hull down positions this wasn't a big deal.  You are correct that Western MBTs are designed to be multipurpose, but the Leopard 2's and Challenger 2's armor and ammo loadout schemes are more geared towards hull down fighting. I suspect the designers of the Leopard 2 (and some degree Challenger 1/2) didn't expect the tanks to last very long into WW3. The many M1s would have been arriving later into WW3 and the ability to attack would have been seen as more important. This is why the M1s armor is more biased towards the hull (the turret is still stronger than the hull though) and why hull ammo storage inside the fighting compartment was avoided.    No i am not speculating. The M1A2 is still an M1, just upgraded. It still uses Chobham MK1 as its base armour.   Sure you are, the M1s armor is not know publicly, you have no way of knowing exactly what sort of composition it debuted with originally and what sort of upgrades were applied.    Can you prove it was a 'lucky' shot? That is speculation.  And with modern systems, i think it would be relatively fairly easy to get a shot on target at 5km.   Again I don't need to prove it was lucky, it has only happened once, you need to prove it is repeatable. Ask any tanker if they think 5000 m shots are something they expect to happen.   We don't really have much hard data on the accuracy of these guns.    So its OK to cherry pick evidence that is anti-C2? It is widely regarded as dubious evidence against the C2. I cant find anyone stating the Greek tests were decent displays of the C2's abilities.   If I'm going to be honest with you, I do accept that the C2 was probably having issues with the propellant and could have performed better. But I don't think it would have beat the M1 and Leo2 on the gunnery scores, would probably have been much closer.    Other projects that are in the works is further upgrading the C2 to have top of the line hydrogas suspension (better than its hydropneumatic suspension at the moment) and upgrading the Perkins engine to 1500hp.   The engine upgrades will be appreciated I'm sure.   The M1 is also due for an engine upgrade. The gas turbine was a good idea at the time but it's advantages are spoiled by being in a tank. The AGT1500 is recuperated (this is more or less a requirement for fuel efficiency). The recuperator (among other things) spoils its excellent IR signature so it looks similar to other Western MBTs in IR.   Yes I know it's not intuitive but turbines have very good IR signatures.   http://i.ytimg.com/vi/58N6Plr17GU/hqdefault.jpg  In mil power notice that most of the IR signature is from the exhaust nozzles, very little from the gasses. The fuselage is also quite bright relative the nozzles.   http://i.imgur.com/R9jNF9Q.png  From the front the signature is almost entirely the fuselage and things like the pitot tubes.   I can explain the physics if you wish, it has to do with atmospheric absorption at certain wavelengths and the way IR imagers must be built.    The Warrior is also getting an overhaul by a combination of General Dynamics and Lockheed Martin. Upgraded armour, weapons, electronics, optics, a new 40mm autocannon (or a greatly upgraded 30mm one) and new AT and AA missile pods.   The new 40mm gun and ammo is impressive. From what I can gather the vehicle has an IR gunners sight as well as 360 degree low light cameras. Any word on a CITV? I haven't seen much on ATGMs either, though I think an export version of the Warrior (Desert Warrior) had them (TOW).  For an ATGM TOW 2B Aero would be a good choice. Integrating Javelin with a vehicle might also be interesting but it seems Javelin's range is limited to somewhere around 2500 m due to the sensor in the missiles nose, IIRC it must lock on before launch.    I don't think anti-air capability is necessary, the RAF+friends can handle anyone.    Just look at the casualty reports. And the C2 managed to survive 5 huge IEDs in a row. In fact, the driver got awarded one of Britains highest honours for braving the bombs.   I don't wanna get into a who has the best anecdote contest.   I never said 'sent back for repair' i said destroyed or critically damaged (and therefore scuttled, either by other NATO tanks or by the airforce).   I can't find a source on this, as far as I can tell less than 40 tanks were total write offs. Given that there were many many more M1s in country than C2s these statistics do not surprise me.    Of course, but that only means something if the enemy can penetrate your armour.   Any tank can have its armor perforated, even hand held AT weapons can perforate armor if they hit a weak point/side/rear/top."

TankPorn,2yojc7,lapinrigolo,22,Wed Mar 11 16:37:52 2015 UTC,"well, if you look at the picture here, then at one of a Panther ready for battle, you will notice two things:  the obvious: there is no turret; not-so-obvious: there is no armor.  The point of having a tank refurbished as (in this case) a crane is because of the load capacity of the suspension and the power of the engine.  Having been stripped of its armor and turret, the Panther is a much lighter machine and can carry multi-ton loads while still being mobile.  With the turret ring still in place, it is possible to very quickly add something like a crane and render a frightful piece of engineering into something more passive but still useful.  So while you are on the right train of thought, it isn't the armor that makes a tank frame so useful for this sort of repurposing, but rather the load capacity, mobility, and ease of conversion."

TankPorn,2yo0o2,GeneralSchnitzel,2,Wed Mar 11 20:29:48 2015 UTC,"How would the Leclerc hold up (theoretically) against a T-90, Leopard 2, or M1?"
TankPorn,2yo0o2,vlepun,5,Thu Mar 12 06:41:25 2015 UTC,"The LeClerc is an excellent tank. In fact, of all of the competitions it entered, it won most iirc. The reasons countries don't buy them is because they're very expensive tanks (and also because of politics).   The armour of the Leopard 2 (A5/A6M) and the LeClerc XXI is the same. It's developed in the joint FrancoGerman Armoury, and of course it's classified.    The LeClerc is also a very fast tank (just like the Leo2 and the T-90), although the powerpack has a tendency to break down/need a lot of maintenance. Which is rumoured to be a reason why the Arab LeClercs use the Leo2's power pack.   I do know the LeClerc is a very fast, accurate tank that can keep firing while traversing through very rough terrain at the same rate of fire as in normal terrain due to its auto-loader. There are also reports by French tank crews that the LeClerc is able to achieve 95% accuracy on the first hit at >4000m, although I've never seen that claim be substantiated.   Overall, all of those tanks are probably very equal (I don't know that much about the T-90 except that they've derived it from the T-72, so I'd put that one on the bottom), and which one would win is largely depended upon the skill of the crews and the tactics employed."
TankPorn,2yng5a,Panda_Cavalry,4,Wed Mar 11 05:53:19 2015 UTC,"The AMX-30 is actually better armoured than the  Leopard 1.  It's glacis is 80 mm @ 68 degrees, 213.5 mm LoS for comparison the Leopard 1's 70 mm @ 60 degrees is only 140 mm LoS.  The AMX-30's frontal armour is closer to the M60 (220.0mm) or Centurion Mk 10 (222.1mm)."
TankPorn,2yng5a,LeuCeaMia,1 point,Wed Mar 11 14:09:03 2015 UTC,Fun quirk in the cold war french tank design is the use of autocannons as coaxial weapons- at least some of the AMX-30s used a 20mm autocannon as the coax for the main gun which is a relatively rare concept for an MBT.
TankPorn,2yng5a,0000013,1 point,Wed Mar 11 06:16:00 2015 UTC,why is it rare? just too overpowered or too big ammunition to be an efficient secondary weapon?
TankPorn,2yng5a,QuerulousPanda,1 point,Wed Mar 11 11:20:51 2015 UTC,Possibly a combination of both.  I've read that the USA didn't want to use the 20mm autocannon from the MBT-70 in their Abrams because they already had a machine gun that could take care of whatever the tank would face while also having a lower caliber than the autocannon.
TankPorn,2yng5a,Leverno,1 point,Wed Mar 11 12:31:28 2015 UTC,"No such thing as overpowered weapon when its on a stable firing platform.  Mostly the reason is the size and ammunition- as leverno noted a 7.62 GPMG can kill anything the tank needs to kill with the secondary weapon and takes ton less space when you remember the ammo size. if your opponent isnt gonna be taken out with MG-fire, youre gonna use the main gun anyway and having yet another caliber of rounds in your supply train is bad logistics..  French also used .50 HMGs as coax (actually still do) which is a ""step down"" as far as coax weapons go, but still larger than usual."
TankPorn,2yng5a,0000013,1 point,Wed Mar 11 13:22:20 2015 UTC,"Ah I guess overpowered wasn't the right word.. I just meant, it was bigger and more powerful than was necessary to deal with the intended targets (which is what you said)."
TankPorn,2yng5a,QuerulousPanda,2,Wed Mar 11 17:42:30 2015 UTC,"the problem is never that something is ""too powerful"" but instead that ""gaining the too much power causes other problems such as wight/ammo amount/reloadtime/size/cost""  if any theoretical military COULD fit a laser gatling cannon with 15 meters of RHA penetration and 5-meter fireball into a tank with the same amount of space and ammo consumption as the current weapon system, nobody would ask twice if its ""too powerful"" but instead give a girlish ""sqwee"" and install it anywhere they could. the drawbacks that at some point there might be friendly or civilian too near isnt a real drawback compared to the massive advantages."
TankPorn,2yng5a,0000013,1 point,Wed Mar 11 17:55:46 2015 UTC,"Because main guns were getting bigger and so was the ammo, which means fewer rounds stored. The idea was to use an autocannon to deal with light / medium targets while saving main gun ammo for tanks and hard targets."

They had been part of the defence of Dunkirk and a bomb or artillery shell had exploded nearby and literally buried them alive there and that was that. In the confusion of the retreat they were just forgotten and lay there for decades before someone found them.   I'm sure there must be many things like that from that time all over Europe.

TankPorn,2ykaso,LeuCeaMia,3,Wed Mar 11 02:06:49 2015 UTC,"Well, to the defense of the 37mm it was used by literally everyone before the war and during the war- germans, US, british (well OK, 2-pounder is 40mm), russians (alongside with 45mm, their 37mm is actually a copy of the german one ) french used 47mm guns, too.  So the thing that made it a door-knocker is that KV1 was just ridiculously well-armored for the first few months of its existence- a fact that led the soviets to develop their 57mm ZIS-2 because their logic was that they need to have an AT gun that can kill their own heavy tank- which at this point of development was a ridiculous overkill of course, given that the KV1 had frontal armor twice over anything germans brought into battle in 1941. Long story short, now that they realized that their expensive AT-gun was was overperforming and overexpensive, they swapped producition back to the ""good enough"" 45mms and 76.2 guns which cost a fraction of the price of the 57mm ZIS-2.  ..And of course the next thing the germans did was bring up a Tiger at the end of 1942. well, whaddya know."

TankPorn,2yg8mb,Daftmau85,5,Mon Mar 9 18:03:47 2015 UTC,It was never meant to be used that way. Its gun was devastating against German fortifications/entrenchments which were a hell of a lot more common than tank battles. They are called breakthrough tanks for a reason.
TankPorn,2yg8mb,Jammybeez,-8,Mon Mar 9 19:42:07 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure I would agree with this. The sole reason behind IS2's construction was because the CCCP needed an answer to Tiger's and Panther's heavy frontal armours, not because they have trouble with bunkers or entrancements (Which the KV-8* series was perfectly fine at dealing with)."
TankPorn,2yg8mb,Zed03,10,Mon Mar 9 20:25:14 2015 UTC,"Wikipedia (and every single other source that i've seen so far) state that to be the exact opposite. Having a 122mm gun with separate-loading shell for shooting at medium tanks is kinda wonky logic at best, especially when the mainstay of the soviet fleet was the T-34 which had the lucky role of swarming over the enemy in pure numbers.  Further on this, given that as has been stated previously, IS2 is a breakthrough tank, and on that role (punching through the main defenses) it would encounter something on the ratio of at least 5-10 anti-tank guns or fortified positions for one german tank.  If the role of the IS2 would have been pure tank-to-tank combat, it would have been armed with the same gun as SU100, but given that unlike the 100mm, 122mm D-25Ts were MUCH more commonplace and easier to produce not to mention very suitable for the breakthrough work,  the logical conclusion was to give it the massive D25 instead of the more ""specialized"" and less manufactured 100mm gun.  This is further pointed out in the later development given that the gun choice for the next generation of battle tanks (the T-54) was the now-readily available 100mm gun and only keep the 122 on the fading heavy tank series.  As for the ""one-shot-kill"" ratio, thats vidya game talk."

TankPorn,2yg8mb,0000013,4,Mon Mar 9 20:57:47 2015 UTC,"One piece shells do not automatically mean higher rates of fire.  The Super Pershing gun the 90 mm T15 went from single piece ammunition (T15E1) to two piece ammunition (T15E2). It was easier to handle and load the separate parts rather than maneuver such a single long unwieldy round.  The Soviets tried one piece 122mm shells and it did not improve things.  For those reasons the Tiger Ausf B ""King Tiger"" and IS-2 actually had similar rates of fire."
TankPorn,2yg8mb,LeuCeaMia,6,Wed Mar 11 14:41:08 2015 UTC,"I think they were one of the most feared tanks by the Germans without a doubt. I wouldn't be surprised if the IS2 had one of the highest 1-shot kills out of any tank in WW2. Yes Germans had the advantage in crew training and fire rate, but I'm sure they were sweating bullets knowing that some noobs could kill them in 1 pull of the trigger. German tank commanders explicitly told their armour not to engage the IS2. Source 4:10"
TankPorn,2yg8mb,Zed03,5,Mon Mar 9 20:28:01 2015 UTC,a russian source on a russian tank seems a little biased..
TankPorn,2yg8mb,biggs2961,3,Wed Mar 11 02:13:21 2015 UTC,"The crew skill thing was true at the start of the war, and gradually reversed due to Germans losing crews and the Soviets becoming more adept at tank warfare. By the end of the war USSR boasted more seasoned veteran tank commanders, gunners etc. People often mention that as a constant, but just take a look at who was left to defend Berlin - old men and teenagers."
TankPorn,2yg8mb,ImOP_need_nerf,5,Tue Mar 10 04:02:06 2015 UTC,"To reload also they had to lower the barrel, so pretty much Germans had clear sign when they reload."
TankPorn,2yg8mb,Zed03,2,Mon Mar 9 18:34:03 2015 UTC,"Yup, about ~6 rounds per minute for panther/tiger, and ~2 rounds per minute for IS2."
TankPorn,2yg8mb,LeuCeaMia,1 point,Mon Mar 9 20:25:42 2015 UTC,"2.5 rounds per minute is for the early screw breach design used in the gun of the trial IS-122.  The rate of fire improved with each iteration, as more and more automation was applied, reaching 4 to 6 rpm.   Production IS-122s differed from the trial version by a D-25T gun with a horizontal semi-automatic sliding breech, which increased the rate of fire. Modifications to increase the rate of fire were carried out throughout the tank's life. ""I had a habit of following tanks to the front lines,"" remembered Kotin in a 1977 interview with Voyenniy Vestnik. ""I don't ride them into battle, but I examine the aftermath. ... I remember we tested an IS. The shell was heavy, the loaders complained that loading takes too long. I climbed into a tank, tried to lift a shell, and confirmed that it was very heavy. I needed to do something. The [Kirov] factory quickly developed a special mechanism for loading shells into the breech."" Kotin's device seems to have been effective. In a letter to the Commissar of Armament Ustinov, concerning re-armament of the IS tank with a 100 mm gun, the engineers wrote ""We consider it imperative that the D-25T remain in the IS-2. Latest trials at the ANIOP resulted in a rate of fire of 4-6 rounds per minute""."
TankPorn,2yg8mb,LeuCeaMia,2,Wed Mar 11 14:52:27 2015 UTC,That's a myth.   Although in general changing the elevation of the gun so that the loader can have an easier time is a common practice in all tanks.
TankPorn,2yg8mb,Adan714,2,Wed Mar 11 14:55:51 2015 UTC,Much better than American M4.
TankPorn,2yg8mb,Mrprocrastinaut,6,Tue Mar 10 08:08:10 2015 UTC,I imagine it's a real bitch to try and fit a piano inside the fighting compartment of an IS-2.
TankPorn,2yg8mb,0000013,3,Tue Mar 10 10:20:30 2015 UTC,"To be honest, you cannot imagine how much stuff you can fit inside the tanks fighting compartment, even if its a russian one.   There is only one place where you can stuff more personal souveniers and ""totally vital personal equipment"" than inside a tank and that is outside of the tank, strapped all over the vehicle.  But i agree, pianos are on on the harder side of things-you-can-bring-along-to-a-war."

TankPorn,2yerh4,nugohs,8,Mon Mar 9 07:16:22 2015 UTC,"Searching ""Destroyed T-34 in Elefant/Ferdinand gun sight"" turned up with only a link to this thread. So I did some searching and found this thread about German optics  which linked to a PDF on ""Panzer gun sights"", detailing the mil system used, what the symbols mean, and how to range targets. Now, looking at these sketches I noticed that they did not resemble OP's original image. Hmm.   Doing some more searching turned up with this thread from live.warthunder.com. The caption reads ""T-34 in the gunsight of an Elefant tank destroyer"". Hey, maybe I'm onto something, but no. User ""MrLKL"" states ""Looks like a Panzer III to me."" So I zoomed into the image and noticed a similarity between the tank shown, and the PzKmpf. III medium tank. Notice the frontal armour, how it appears to slope into a vertical front plate? Interesting.  So, if this is a Pz III, what could have possibly knocked it out? The surrounding environment looks a lot like the vast plains of the Eastern (or Western) front of the USSR. So it must be a Russian gun. Google-ing ""Russian gun sights"" produced this post to the World of Tanks forums by WG ""military specialist"" The_Chieftain. Quoting his post, ""I strongly doubt that they are interchangeable, unless the D-25-T had identical ballistics to the 7.5 L/48, though the mil scale idea seems to have been copied"", so maybe it's a Russian 122mm D-2-5t gun. Searching for 'Russian 122mm D-2-5t gun sights' on Google presented this sketch showing how to range the gun.  So what does this mean? TL;DR From what I can gather the tank shown is a German PzKmpf. III medium tank, knocked out during fighting by a Russian 122mm d-2-5t cannon, mounted on either an ISU or IS chassis.  Bonus comic"

A Pz.Kpfw* III, like majority of early German tanks, are very box like due to the ""thick strong armour"" logic of Hitler, hence affectionately known as Fascist Box Tanks.

TankPorn,2y5nyh,AshamanTest,20,Sun Mar 8 17:50:49 2015 UTC,"I have made a lot of research on this thing (meaning mostly searching on the internet and contacting a few people that also try to find information about it) and tried to figure out by myself what this thing could be for. I have made this post not too long ago hoping that it might help to solve the mystery. Now the conclusion of my research is that we dont know ANYTHING about it besides the famous list of established facts that you see everywhere. Everything else is pure speculation.  Now speculation is still interesting though:  Some people think that this might be a mobile blast shield for a controlled demolition. This would mean that the gun port at the front is actually for the cable of the explosives.  If you take a look at the thing you will quickly realize that it can only move on a smooth surface because it has this tiny wheel at the back that would jump over every pebble and get stuck everywhere. It would be like trying to use a skateboard on the beach. You can also see that little hinge above the wheel which might be used to connect the vehicle to a Kettenrad or something that would tow it. The whole arm on the back might also be a temporary construction because this was probably still in development when it got captured by the soviets. What many people dont realize is that we dont even know for sure if this a military vehicle. It could be for something completely different. The Dunkelgrau paint might have been applied by the Kubinka staff or by the germans for whatever reason. The germans sent all kinds of stuff to Japan! Not only military technology.  Most people think that this is a reconnaissance vehicle but I dont think thats likely because it only has 1 vision slit which is tiny. You could see barely anything. It would probably be powered by a small combustion engine which is pretty loud for a 1 man reconnaissance vehicle and it would probably be really slow. And a radio wouldnt fit in it either.  You would probably be able to do better reconnaissance alone, on foot, with a pistol and some signal flags.  TL:DR No idea what that thing is."

A simple augmented arm that can rip off wings or rotor blades covering your real arms along with a jetpack letting you jump on top of a tank is sufficient.    Come to think of it, I guess I'm describing an unarmored Iron Man suit.  Realistically, you could do tons of damage to enemies with such a suit.  Wait atop a building, spot a tank.  Fly down, rip the turret off (or just twist it), fly away before anyone realizes what happened.    I think only a heat seeker would be a deal issue."
TankPorn,2y4od9,TankArchives,1 point,Sat Mar 7 10:47:29 2015 UTC,"And, as mentioned earlier, if the jet pack is fast enough, you can take out a helicopter.  Chasing a jet would likely leave you unconscious, so I guess they're safe from jet infantry."

I still hear reports of vehicles getting destroyed by IEDs even though we have IED detection.  Likewise RPGs are still successfully used.  Tanks are still being used despite being no match against jets and helicopters and tankbuster bazookas.    Infantry with augmented limbs aren't going to be one man armies like Iron Man or marines in video games, but they'd still have their uses in battle.  If nothing else, they'd make great additions to infantry groups.  Perhaps by clearing away rubble or even just punching away vehicles designed to trap tanks (I heard a common tactic is to trap tanks in tight mountain passes by destroying the first and last tank).  By punching away the damaged tank (after flying up and nabbing the guy that shot the tanks), the rest are free to continue.  Sure, the armored guy is still vulnerable, but it's better to have options."

I figure it will be more like a Space Marine Terminator giving heavy fire support.  Don't forget that distance is the best defense - modern fighters can kill enemy aircraft before they can even see them, here are some stats for the AIM-7 medium range missile from the 1991 Gulf War, over two decades ago:   The most common version of the Sparrow today, the AIM-7M, entered service in 1982 and featured a new inverse monopulse seeker (matching the capabilities of Skyflash), active radar fuse, digital controls, improved ECM resistance, and better low-altitude performance. It was used to good advantage in the 1991 Gulf War, where it scored many USAF air-to-air kills. Of 44 missiles fired, 30 (68.2%) hit their intended targets resulting in 24/26 (54.5%/59.1%) kills. 19 kills were obtained beyond visual range.   More than half of the kills occured beyond visual range, there's no reason to believe that close combat will become the way of the future."

This was as the name suggests (Versuchtsträger=testbed) more of a test and they never meant to mass produce it because they wanted to try out all the new technology they developed. In one of the tanks for example one gun has an autoloader and the other has to be manually loaded. Many of these technologies would later be used in the Leopard 2.  edit: This is kinda like the Stridsvagn 103! On that tank the gun didnt move at all and had to be aimed with hydraulics in the suspension.  edit: Oh and the tank in the pic is a GVT which stands in Augustdorf, Germany."
TankPorn,2xy6kh,killswitch247,9,Wed Mar 4 22:40:10 2015 UTC,"its gunsights were completely stabilized and independend from the movement of the tank, much like a modern turreted tank's optics. the tank had a 3 man crew (driver, command, gunner): the driver pushed the vehicle into a high speed zig-zag course, the commander designated the targets, and the gunner just aimed at them and kept the reticle over the target. if the gun lines up with the reticle, the shot breaks automatically.  the system worked fine, but it was too much of a one trick pony."
TankPorn,2xy6kh,3rdweal,2,Thu Mar 5 02:15:26 2015 UTC,"if the gun lines up with the reticle, the shot breaks automatically.   A bit like the vaunted ""tracking point"" technology?"

TankPorn,2xy6kh,3rdweal,2,Thu Mar 5 07:51:57 2015 UTC,"The pool of skilled shooters who can make 500 yard+ shots and are of flexible morals can't be that small, so I don't think that the lack of assassinations by long range rifle shots is for want of capable marksmen."

TankPorn,2xvft2,pt_Hazard,2,Wed Mar 4 16:35:56 2015 UTC,Wasn't it supposed to have a 75mm gun also? So the Panther is actually a more mobile heavy tank?
TankPorn,2xvft2,lockpickerkuroko,3,Thu Mar 5 01:15:00 2015 UTC,"Correct. Pre-1941 the design parameters changed quite a lot with weight class requirements ranging from 30-40 tonnes. All the prototypes were to be armed with 7.5cm guns of various barrel lengths. After the Germans encountered the T-34 the design was finalised as a 45-tonne design fitted around a tank-based version of the Flak 18/36 which at the time (late 1941) was the only gun capable of penetrating the T-34.  I'm not exactly sure about this part, but according to Albert Speer Hitler's demands meant that the original 45-50 tonne design for the Tiger ended up in a 57-tonne production version of the Tiger, and the same happened with the Panther, where Hitler insisted on slapping more armour and bigger guns, resulting in the 30-35 tonne design becoming a 45-tonne machine, near the original weight of the Tiger.   TL;DR: Although designed differently and with different express purposes the Panther is in effect the original Tiger design post-1941 (after Barbarossa) with a 7.5cm gun."

The same occurs with infantry protection all the time.  In fact, due to the stagnation of armor development, I wouldn't be surprised to see nations such as the UK do the same thing with their excess guns when they start to scale down their military due to the fact it would be much cheaper to create and maintain while still keeping the ability to knock out opposing armor."

The fact it had the same frame and parts as the medium tank M14/41 made it easily repairable for when they broke down. After Italy surrender many of these tanks were captured and used by the Germans for anti-Partisan work. they were also given to the RSI (the Italian puppet government's army in northern Italy). The main issue that every one had with the tank was the Riveted Armor plates, even tough it was thicker then the M series tanks and hit from a AT gun (or any large caliber gun really) would make the rivets pop on the inside of the tank, this could be fatal for every one inside.

TankPorn,2xf8ir,LeuCeaMia,5,Sat Feb 28 02:27:08 2015 UTC,"Interesting thought. It does beg the question though, what is the modern ""medium tank concept"".

We don't need the latest and greatest in armor technology, we just need something that we can plop on a hilltop to blow crap up or use for infantry support."

They ended up with the leopard, with armour enough to stop 20 mm cannon rounds only. Their next tank, the leopard 2A4 through 7 have abandoned this doctrine, and focuses on more armor than its predecessor.   why? Because armor and anti-tank is in a constant battle, but now we have developed a diverse set of armour types, more complex and plenty, than the homogenous armour plating in the 60s.   The thing is, armour is still useful, but only a 3 gen. MBT can risk taking a shot from the newest anti-tank systems.  Edit: an to a"

TankPorn,2xf8ir,Pyronaut44,5,Sat Feb 28 04:40:00 2015 UTC,"It's the cycle of armor vs anti-armor weapons, look at the Leopard 1 back in the sixties:   Mobility was the priority, while firepower came second; armour was seen as less essential, as it was believed that no real protection against hollow charge weapons was possible anyway.   If we look at naval warfare, anti-ship weapons are now so capable that it makes little sense to burden vessels with armor, as opposed to anti-missile and CIWS systems to offer active protection.  In the same vein, I believe active protection systems will be the way of the future, with passive armor made sufficient to deal with small arms and the like."

With the rise in active protection systems and more advanced composite armours weapons will become less effective in the future until armour is ahead again, and then research/money will turn to weapons again and it'll start the whole cycle again."
TankPorn,2xf8ir,burgerbob22,1 point,Sat Feb 28 08:17:17 2015 UTC,Because it still works. Abrams have shot at each other point-blank with APFSDS and bounced every shot in friendly fire incidents. Challenger IIs have survived dozens of RPG hits in succession with no damage.

This tiger's drive train was neither robust enough nor did it have a proper factor of safety."
TankPorn,2xbl3e,stug_life,1 point,Fri Feb 27 18:10:25 2015 UTC,I disagree.  Even today German cars are over engineered.  Requiring parts to have such a precise tolerance is one example.

If the tiger were over engineered it wouldn't have had the reliability issues that it did.  Over engineering would be applying a safety factor of like 10 so that under any conditions it wouldn't break.  The german tanks of WWII were overly ambitious.  Heavily armed and armored but with drive trains that could not withstand the stress that they were being placed under.  The Tiger I and II, Jagdtiger, Panther, and Jagdpanther all suffered from this."

The Army does not forbid tanks to engage tanks, the Army encourages young lieutenants and platoon sergeants to enforce a firing discipline that enables the platoon to save main gun ammunition by calling for fire whenever practical."

There is a persistent myth that WWII US army doctrine called for only TDs to engage tanks, with tanks strictly in an infantry support rule. This is false."
TankPorn,2xbl3e,maverck,3,Fri Feb 27 21:50:21 2015 UTC,"First of all, US Armor doctrine is still pretty firmly rooted in our experiences with armor in WWII. No, Korea, Vietnam, and the Gulf War did not influence armor tactics that much.   Secondly, I'm not talking about World War II. I am making the comparison that it is true that today armor doctrine very strongly encourages the use of support elements when possible before expending large amounts of main gun ammunition.  I'm not here to argue WWII tank tactics with you. I'm making an interesting comparison between OP's posted article and modern US armor tactics, in the spirit of adding to the discussion. Get off my nuts about WWII tactics, and stop being a dick."
TankPorn,2xbl3e,hydrogenjoule,1 point,Fri Feb 27 22:00:58 2015 UTC,"Well part of the issue is after Patton pushed for the M4 to not be replaced by the pershing, we ended up with tanks that couldn't go toe to toe with the enemy late war tanks in a gun duel.  That shaped tactics at the time.    Now in your M1 you are king shit of fuck mountain and you are definitely engaging enemy armor."
TankPorn,2xbl3e,spudicous,2,Fri Feb 27 23:24:05 2015 UTC,"Patton pushed for the M4 to not be replaced by the pershing   That's a myth propagated by Belton Cooper's ""Death Traps"".  Even then in end, they still got the Pershing's gun into action mounted on the M36 GMC.   While the Pershing itself was ill suited for an early release.   Although Ordnance pushed for the T26 to be given battlefield testing, AGF refused to countenance it until Armored Board, part of AGF, had completed their testing and declared the vehicles battle-worthy. They may have had a point: Testing of T25E1 at Aberdeen, Phoenix and Milford Proving Grounds all indicated a large number of failings. Armored Board subsequently declared that the vehicles be considered not battle-worthy. Testing of T26E1 at Aberdeen, Milford and Ft Knox indicated the same general deficiencies in the heavier tank as the lighter, but since T26 wasn't any -worse-, and still had more armour, it was recommended to abandon T25E1 and continue with T26E1.   Armored Force considered T26E1 to be not battle-worthy, principally because of the following major defects:  Inadequate engine cooling, mechanical unreliability, inadequate gun mantlet armor, inadequate grousers and insufficient track life, unsatisfactory stowage arrangement.  So significant were the changes required, that it also resulted in a new nomenclature to E3.    Nicholas Moran did a whole series of articles on the Pershing, I recommend reading them.  Part 1  Part 2  Part 3   M1 you are king shit of fuck mountain and you are definitely engaging enemy armor.    That wasn't always the case back when there was another super power on the block."
TankPorn,2xbl3e,StranaMechty,1 point,Sat Feb 28 03:58:10 2015 UTC,The capabilities have definitely evolved. I think a big part of it is that commanders want to expose armor to the minimum amount of fire possible. Especially seeing as a lot of our doctrine is oriented towards going toe to toe with the Russians. That's a lot of okay tanks vs a modest amount of really good ones.
TankPorn,2xbl3e,hydrogenjoule,1 point,Sat Feb 28 00:01:12 2015 UTC,"They didn't really call for artillary. The Tank Destroyer division was designed for taking out hostile tanks. If shermans came into contact with German Armor they were meant to pull back, call for Tank Destroyers. Let them handle it. Shermans were really bad at fighting other tanks. They had a shitty gun and bad armor that was easily penetrated. Later sherman models fixed this but they were very rare."

TankPorn,2xbl3e,hydrogenjoule,0,Wed Mar 4 01:25:59 2015 UTC,"Yea, is not entirely accurate, but there is truth to it. Shermans were never Supposed to engage tigers, that was the job of tank destroyers such as the m18 and m10 ""hellcat"" and ""wolverine"". Shermans were designed to exploit breakthroughs created by infantry and artillery. The 75mm gum was excellent at lobbing high explosive shells at building and anti-tank guns."
TankPorn,2xbl3e,TheHIV123,7,Fri Feb 27 17:07:33 2015 UTC,"Allow me to quote from Wiki:  “U.S. Army doctrine held that tanks did not fight other tanks but supported infantry”  This is common knowledge. As a result, there was never any need to equip the tanks with a gun capable of dealing with the German tanks, the Tank Destroyer force can do that job. The end result of this policy was a woefully inadequate standard tank which was all but incapable of dealing with the opposition it faced, resulting in otherwise avoidable death. The error of this way of thinking was finally identified by the end of 1945 and the tank destroyers gotten rid of, making the Tank Destroyer Branch pretty much the shortest lived branch in Army history. Simple, really, we've all pretty much heard it.  One of the things that gets drilled into you in OCS is “Show me the regs.”  Armored Force doctrine was laid out in FM 17-10, it’s available online in PDF format. Next time someone comes back to you with the statement that “American tanks weren’t supposed to fight other tanks”, give them the link to the FM, and ask them to show you where, in the written doctrine signed and approved by General Marshall, Chief of Staff of the Army on behalf of the Secretary of War with force of direct order, it says that tanks were not to fight other tanks.  Here’s the short version. It doesn’t. He or she will be looking for a while. (Indeed, it states that both medium and (optimistically) light tanks could perform the anti-armour role)   http://worldoftanks.com/en/news/21/chieftains-hatch-can-openers-americas-successful-failure/"

TankPorn,2x2562,rangamatchstick,4,Wed Feb 25 17:56:11 2015 UTC,"Russian tank design for the post war period placed emphasis on the lowest and smallest possible silhouette. This lead to the adoption of the autoloader to do away with the need for a standing loader, allowing the height to be lowered still further. This required the ammunition to be placed exposed on a carousel around the turret ring. Combined with the paltry size of the fighting compartment of Russian tanks this combines to cause a high chance for catastrophic ammunition fires and very poor crew survival rates. Nowhere has this been more apparent than the conflict in the Ukraine: Both sides have been making heavy use of tanks such as the T-72, and BMP family IFV's with their paper mache armour, and understandably losses of armour on both sides have been absolutely dreadful."

TankPorn,2wt7wf,warbirdfrank,7,Sun Feb 22 23:28:47 2015 UTC,"There are two tanks known as IS-3. IS-3 (Object 244) was an IS-2 rearmed with the long-barrelled 85mm cannon (D-5T-85-BM). It was developed by LKZ (in Leningrad) and was not taken in service. IS-3 (Object 703) was developed in late 1944 by ChTZ (in Chelyabinsk) and left the factory shop in May 1945.[23] This tank had an improved armour layout, and a semi-hemispherical cast turret (resembling an overturned soup bowl) which became the hallmark of post-war Soviet tanks. While this low, hemispherical turret may have improved protection, it also significantly diminished the working headroom, especially for the loader (Soviet tanks in general are characterized by uncomfortably small interior space compared to Western tanks). The low turret also limited the maximum depression of the main gun, since the gun breech had little room inside the turret to pivot on its vertical axis. As a result, the IS-3 was less able to take advantage of hull-down positions than Western tanks.[24] The IS-3's pointed prow earned it the nickname Shchuka (Pike) by its crews. It weighed slightly less and stood 30 centimetres (12 in) lower than previous versions. Wartime production resulted in many mechanical problems and a hull weldline that had a tendency to crack open.[25]  The first public demonstration of the IS-3 came on 7 September 1945 during the Allied victory parade on Charlottenburgerstrasse in Berlin with the heavily reinforced 71st Guards Heavy Tank Regiment of the 2nd Guards Tank Army.[23] The IS-3 came too late to see action in World War II.  Starting in 1960, the IS-3 was slightly modernized as the IS-3M, in a manner similar to the IS-2M."
TankPorn,2wt7wf,Mrprocrastinaut,5,Sun Feb 22 23:29:20 2015 UTC,"Interesting, thank you very much. It's also necessary to mention the huge stink this kicked up amongst western observers and tank designers when it appeared. They got a huge shock when the realized this was immune to all existing tank guns, and led to the development of the M103 and Conqueror with their massive 120mm guns. Then more capable tanks guns like the Royal Ordnance L7 were produced and the Soviets lost their interest in heavy breakthrough tanks, as the IS-3 was a bit of a disappointment anyway."
TankPorn,2wt7wf,burgerbob22,2,Mon Feb 23 00:41:04 2015 UTC,"Yup, I think the funniest part is how it made the Allies go nuts and make a bunch of new designs, when in fact it was not a very good tank in the first place."
TankPorn,2wt7wf,bamaster,5,Mon Feb 23 02:59:22 2015 UTC,I think the is3 was a very good tank. VG.. When you compare it to other ww2 heavy tanks which is what it is and what it was designed for.  The main flack it received was it's performance in the six day war which was 23 years and many generation of tanks after it was designed.  The is3's main design flaw is it was designed when it was already becoming obsolete due to no one being able to see the future and the death of the heavy tank.  By the standards of the war it was designed to fight in it was a good heavy/breakthrough tank.  After the MBT started to materialize it was hopeless.
TankPorn,2wt7wf,burgerbob22,2,Mon Feb 23 03:17:32 2015 UTC,"Well, judging by the info on Wiki (not a whole lot) it was cramped and had a lot of mechanical problems. It definitely technically outclassed anything in the West on paper."
TankPorn,2wt7wf,bamaster,3,Mon Feb 23 03:27:34 2015 UTC,All Russian tanks are cramped that's just their hallmark although the is3 was worse than most.  Russian tankmen were general chosen on basis of size.  The ergonomics were shit for sure but again it wasn't intended to fight a mobile war it was intended to push a breakthrough and then fall behind when the mediums had pushed through the hole it would create.  A lot was sacrificed just to give it maximum protection.  Also the main reliability problem cited were during the 6 day war when the Egyptians were using it to fight in the desert which it wasn't designed for.  Early problems with reliability were war time production related which was normal for most Russian equipment made during war time and shortly after.
TankPorn,2wt7wf,LeuCeaMia,2,Mon Feb 23 03:42:31 2015 UTC,All Russian tanks are cramped that's just their hallmark   Strangely enough when actual figures are involved Soviet tanks don't really stand out. In fact the T-34 has much more headroom than the Panzer IV and each T-34 crew member has more volume to work in than they would in a Cromwell.
TankPorn,2wt7wf,bamaster,2,Mon Feb 23 14:47:06 2015 UTC,"Every book I have read and even tanks of the era I have looked inside says the opposite.  https://books.google.ca/books?id=TErrAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA29&lpg=PA29&dq=internal+space+of+russian+tanks&source=bl&ots=evfy0MudhR&sig=ywWg-98JkZexo5CJdaavjXc3I6g&hl=en&sa=X&ei=E8jrVM6SEoGnyATXpoDoCw&ved=0CC0Q6AEwCw  In fact that's the only reference I have seen to this. And the is3 and all the hemispherical turreted tanks that followed had the same space issues.  I personally know a tanker from the ex Soviet Union who has nothing but bad things to say about how tight it is inside the armor he operated and he's a 5'5"" Uzbeki."
TankPorn,2wt7wf,LeuCeaMia,2,Tue Feb 24 00:44:30 2015 UTC,"Most of what's written is by Americans comparing them to American tanks, which tend to be the most roomy.

Inside the Great Tanks gives a detailed look around by the staff of the Patton Museum, who actually have access to the vehicles. It's certain crew position in certain tanks, they make no blanket statements and even the American tanks they got into had problems.

TankPorn,2wt7wf,bamaster,1 point,Tue Feb 24 04:56:51 2015 UTC,In sure all tanks have certain stations that are tighter than others but Soviet tanks were smaller in general this is just a fact.  A t55 is a full 3 feet shorter in length than a m48 and 2 feet shorter in height and still has a crew of 4...  And this trend is normal for all american vs Soviet tanks.  And the leopard is an even longer tank.  Yes the AMX is small but they only made 3000 so it was really a non entity.

TankPorn,2wt7wf,ExplosiveMachine,3,Mon Feb 23 16:36:39 2015 UTC,"Yes. This is well represented in the game World Of Tanks, this tank's armour is best on frontal only, as soon as there's an angle one of the plates is less efficient.   Also, having one straight plate instead of two reduces the amount of welds necessary from three to one, which greatly reduces any chances of cracking."

TankPorn,2ws6ym,ddosn,4,Sun Feb 22 21:42:28 2015 UTC,You're thinking about the Bhishma.   The Arjun is an indigenous design while the Tank EX is a hybrid of a modified T-72M1 hull mated to a modified Arjun turret; the T-90S only came to serve and be built in India because of how delayed the Arjun was.

War movies like Fury, We Were Soldiers and Black Hawk Down have set the standard high, with their gritty realism, historical accurate equipment, top notch acting, and fantastic effects.   Patton has some solid acting but the effects are super dated and they used the wrong tanks.  So the only tank movie that I can think of that hits all points is Fury, which I loved.

It stalled the Division's advance for a full day while being attacked by a variety of antitank weapons, until it finally ran out of ammunition.[11][12][d][e]""  At any rate you can't compare fortified positions versus a tank missing a track and stuck in the road"

TankPorn,2wnb2e,LeuCeaMia,6,Sat Feb 21 11:06:55 2015 UTC,"The T95 was the precursor to the M60. It also formed the basic platform for research from 1960-63. So T95 platforms got the Shillelagh first, the experimental 120mm Delta, and some of the advanced fire control systems that went with. Plus, Ive also seen T95s with the Hydropneumatic suspension that let the ""S""-tank kneel, and was on the MBT-70. However, as projects like the Shillelagh were directly applied to the M60A1, the T95 was abandoned as a test platform.   Pretty neat!"

TankPorn,2wnb2e,global336,5,Sat Feb 21 17:36:53 2015 UTC,"The 120mm Delta gun was essentially the precursor to the current generation of 120mm gun mounted on tanks like the Leopard 2 and the M1 Abrams. It was a smooth bore cannon capable of firing a APFSDS round at a velocity of around 1,615m/s and exhibited all the characteristics typically associated with a smooth bore gun. However, the project was cancelled due to High Command's obsession with guided missiles like the infamous Shillelagh."

TankPorn,2wnb2e,global336,6,Sat Feb 21 20:10:49 2015 UTC,"TouniXVIII is exactly correct, but Id just like to add that the DELTA wasnt completely abandoned.  The Germans took the gun and reworked it into their version of the MBT-70, as well as their Keller prototype.  It would further serve as the basis for the 120mm guns which were put on the Leo2 and the M1A1.  So the DELTA is like the grandaddy of the guns we use now."
TankPorn,2wnb2e,BeondTheGrave,2,Sun Feb 22 00:52:32 2015 UTC,"Plus, i'd like to point out that the current cardboard-cased 120mm shells weight 14-24 kg depending on type so the 152mm cannon had a serious issue with ammo size."
TankPorn,2wnb2e,0000013,2,Sun Feb 22 10:06:55 2015 UTC,"Strangely enough the MBT-70's gun wasn't entirely dependent on ATGMs for long range AT. The 152 mm XM150E5 could fire APFSDS-T XM578E1, which had a muzzle velocity of 4850 ft/sec (1478 m/sec)."
TankPorn,2wnb2e,BeondTheGrave,2,Sun Feb 22 02:23:48 2015 UTC,"The APFSDS rounds never really worked well for the 152mm gun. They had a tendency to break up mid flight, and never quite met the target cost and efficiency markers. It was actually a major point of contention between US and FRG designers, and the reason why the FRG went with the 120mm gun."

TankPorn,2wnb2e,RampagingTortoise,4,Sat Feb 21 17:51:16 2015 UTC,I believe it used a development of the M48 turret. It would be further developed into the M60 turret later.

Note that this picture (obviously) is the turret removed- in reality with turret facing 12 o clock that rack is not really that clearly visible to any crewmembers aside the driver- for loader its too low and all the gun stuff is in the way, for gunner the gun is in the way, the drvier literally sits the next door as shown here but to actually peep at it he has to check behind his chair anyway.  Which means that when you reload the turret (which has 15 ready rounds), you traverse to 3 o'clock and voila- the turret ""cage"" that prevents people from sticking legs and hands out of the turret whilst its rotating has a clear opening so the loader can pick 15 of those 27 babies up and refill the turret.  Also not pictured is the turret floor if anyone is wondering why the torsion bars are visible."

TankPorn,2wfk6u,skweeky,6,Thu Feb 19 16:23:52 2015 UTC,For the 15 rounds in the turret yes.
TankPorn,2wfk6u,0000013,1 point,Thu Feb 19 16:57:38 2015 UTC,"As leuCeaMia stated and linked the pic so kindly, the turret ammo compartment has blast door and blowoff screens on the top. The blast door is operated by a big red switch you can either butt-check or elbow thats on the side of the loaders suite- and when power is off you need to use emergency opening lever thats on the edge of the blast door.  The reason L2s dont have hull storage blast doors is that the compartment top is under glacis plate which you really, really dont want to weaken and unlike M1 it contains a lot more ammo. if you check the other thread they have suggested that they blast-door the hull compartment to vent downwards but thats not gonna happen most likely- the basic gist being that if you take a hit that low in the hull from your side, youre already doing something you really really shouldnt."

TankPorn,2wdhwz,OfficalWerewolf,1 point,Fri Feb 20 05:16:29 2015 UTC,"Technically three piece, but the primer is loaded in a magazine.  With two piece ammo each part is smaller and easier to handle, so the difference in reload time isn't really that pronounced. The loader can pick up the 2 parts right away and push the round into the breech using the charge.  The Soviets tried one piece ammo for the 122 mm D-25, it didn't really improve things.   Based on these results, GBTU considers it unreasonable to switch to a single piece shell for the 122 mm D-25 gun in the IS-122 tank and ISU-122S SPG for the following reasons:   The rate of fire is not increased, as it is more difficult to load a single piece shell. It is impossible to load the tank gun at an angle of elevation of 10 degrees. The ammunition capacity of the SPG increases by only 4 shells, and the ammunition capacity of the tank decreases by 1 shell."""

I had planned originally on doing it on the ""Starship's"" development history, but there wernt enough primary documents available to say what I wanted to say. As a result I've shifted over to the MBT-70, which I would argue is a conceptually similar tank.   I've also read through and have available a copy of R P Hunnicutt's Patton, which includes a detailed section on the Starship. I'd say it's one of the best things yet written about it."

TankPorn,2w79o9,BeondTheGrave,22,Tue Feb 17 20:54:59 2015 UTC,"Well the tank was developed in response to a 1958 report entitled the ARCOVE report. Basically, ARCOVE said that the best armament for a tank should be High Explosive Anti-Tank missiles, as opposed to the conventional HEAT or Kinetic Energy rounds which dominated the post-War designs. The report argued that missiles would be more accurate (since you could guide them) and do more damage, because at that time the steel armor of most tanks as too thin to stop HEAT missiles. Heres an explanation of how HEAT warheads work. But basically, HEAT's main advantage is that its a high explosive warhead specifically shaped to send a stream of metal through a tank's armor. Unlike the armor piercing high explosive shells of World War Two, or the Kinetic Energy projectiles used today, HEAT never loses its penetration capability over distance, because it works off of a chemical reaction. The only limitation on how much steel armor you can penetrate is the diameter of the warhead. Further, missiles can maintain their accuracy and lethality over a long distance. HEAT warheads allow them to penetrate the same amount of armor, and theoretically a guidance package would give the missiles high accuracy over long distances as well.   Anyway, after the ARCOVE report came out, the Army switched from traditional tank guns to missile guns. This is where the M551 Sheridan came from, as well as the American MBT-70 prototypes. As these development programs progressed, it was acknowledged that the M60 would also have to be brought up to the MBT-70 missile armed standard. Most of the work had already been done, as a prototype M60 had been retrofitted to help develop the Shillelagh launcher used in the M551.   By 1962-1963, work began on taking the M551 combat suite and applying it to the M60 platform. In addition to the Shillelagh launcher and guidance system, the designers also designed the unique turret which gave the ""Starship"" its unique silhouette. They used the extra room permitted by the short gun to rearrange the crew compartment. The loader and gunner were moved down, and the commander was put behind the breach of the gun. This reduced the frontal profile of the tank, which in theory would have made it harder to hit.   These upgrades proceded apace, and by 1967 the Army Material Command authorized and paid for ~540 turrets to be retrofitted onto the hulls of M60A1s then in production. This coincided with the production of the first MBT-70 prototypes, and represented the high water mark of the missile-tank concept. This was a critical period, because the M60A2 program was intended to upgrade the M60 platform to the MBT-70 standard. After 1967, the MBT-70 program began to fall apart, and the M60A2 program lost a lot of its impetus. After all, why would you upgrade the M60 to the new standard, when the new standard was falling apart?   But the AMC had already paid for all those turrets, so they had to use them. By 1970, the final trials of the M60A2 were being completed. Unfortunately, it showed that there were serious problems with the technology of the M60A2. Namely, while the tank was mechanically sound, the electronic suite which controlled the missile system was prone to failure and often required frequent maintenance. Several attempts were made to remedy those problems, but short of redesigning the Shillelagh system, there wasnt much hope of improving the reliability of the M60A2. And the MBT-70 program collapsed in 1969, which as weve discussed killed a lot of the interest in missile armed tanks.   By 1974 most of the ~540 tanks had been deployed to Europe, primarily with the 2nd Armored Division. There they augmented the existing fleet of M60A1s, which lacked the long range capability of the Shillelagh missiles. Unfortunately, technological problems plagued the Shillelagh system, and the unique turret prevented any traditional armament.  Ultimately, by 1980 the entire concept was abandoned and the M60A2s were all decommissioned. Some were scrapped, others went to museums or rust yards. But some were rebuilt as M728 Engineering tanks. I believe that the process entailed re equipping the tanks with a new turret as well as the CEV's gun and a frame mount."

TankPorn,2w79o9,n23_,4,Tue Feb 17 22:24:29 2015 UTC,"I've always heard the sheridan was a bit of a failure due to problems with the gun/launcher, why did they then decide to put the same failed weapon on the M60 too?"
TankPorn,2w79o9,BeondTheGrave,3,Wed Feb 18 00:16:32 2015 UTC,"Firstly, the M60A2 project started right after the M551 project. Within a year of starting the Shillelagh project, and upgrade package for the M60 was being designed. It should demonstrate just how much the Army believed in this technology.   However, the major Shillelagh project was the MBT-70 program. The M551 was just a recon vehicle, and the A2 program was an upgrade package to bring the M60 in line with the MBT-70. As long as the MBT-70 program had life in it, the Shillelagh the primary armament for future American tanks.   The issue was that the AMC bought into the M60A2 concept before the MBT-70 program came to fruition. It made sense at the time, considering the MBT handnt quite flew off the rails yet. But once the MBT program collapsed, it left the Army with a few hundred A2s that no longer made sense."
TankPorn,2w79o9,Tarnsman4Life,2,Wed Feb 18 01:54:10 2015 UTC,"Why is it, in your opinion the US and NATO pretty much abandoned the concept of having a ""tube"" fired ATGM for their MBT's while the Soviets really developed the concept into a lethal, effective system? The US only really made the one attempt until very recently where as the Soviets fielded and upgraded gun-fired ATGM's from the late 60's through today.   Also, was the M60A2 widely deployed in the European theater or was it limited to platoon or company size units which were uncommon?"
TankPorn,2w79o9,BeondTheGrave,1 point,Wed Feb 18 05:07:08 2015 UTC,"I think that the US's aversion to tube fired ATGMs stems from two things. The first was their bad experience with the Shillelagh missile. The United States bought deep on the concept of the gun/launcher system, and designed 3 tanks around it (the M551, MBT-70, and the A2 upgrade package for the M60). But then when the missile didnt work out, it became a really embarrassing, and expensive, failure. I think that the M1 was designed with that in mind, and completely dispensed with the missile armed concept. Remember too that the XM1 project started just a few years after the MBT-70 program collapsed.   Also, I think there is a larger issue around the use of ATGM's. Specifically, the design of modern armor reduces the effectiveness of HEAT warheads. They are definitely effective, but it turns out that they werent the panacea that planners in the 1950s thought. You could put missiles into a tank's larger armament, but when APFSDS is just as effective, you have to ask ""why?"" Im not really sure what the answer is. The Soviets/Russians clearly believe in the concept, or at least appreciate the flexibility. But Im not really sure why they feel that way. I do know that theyre pretty singular in that regard though. The Germans never believed in the gun/launcher concept, favoring traditional guns. And the US is pretty soured on the concept. All of which means that the Russian's are pretty alone in using ATGMs on their MBTs.  As for the deployment of the M60A2, I think that they were all deployed to Europe. The records are pretty hard to navigate here, and its harder than you might think to figure out what kind of equipment a unit might have. What I do know is that the A2 was only deployed to Europe, and that some number went to the 2nd Armored. But Im not sure if the tank was equipped to any separate brigades or regiments, or any other armored divisions."
TankPorn,2w79o9,Tarnsman4Life,2,Wed Feb 18 14:30:12 2015 UTC,"I agree with pretty much everything you said; I never understood why the US did not adapt their only really effective ground launched ATGM system the TOW to an MBT. With the introduction of ERA you lose effectiveness of HEAT rounds, but then they added stand off probes and tandem warheads to the TOW negating much of the protection ERA gives you. Could it have boiled down to the simple fact than most later NATO, specifically US tanks had pretty good fire control systems so they could hit with a Sabot out to an extreme range whereas the soviets were less confident in the ability of their tanks with somewhat simpler electronics hitting back at the same range?  I read somewhere the soviets also deployed gun-launched ATGM's to counter NATO ATGM carriers but it seems to me that artillery and gunships would be better suited to counter that threat.  Oh another question because this kind of relates to the MBT-70; any idea why the US abandoned the idea of a secondary cannon caliber armament for their MBT's? If I remember correctly the ""XM1"" at one point was supposed to (or at least it was discussed) have a coaxial 20 or 25MM cannon."
TankPorn,2w79o9,BeondTheGrave,1 point,Wed Feb 18 14:41:09 2015 UTC,"The 20mm cannon on the MBT was the German's idea. They wanted to use it in a retractable mount to deal with Soviet attack helicopters and thin-skinned vehicles. The US has usually prefered the smaller .50 cal for that role, and when they designed the M1 they returned to the .50 cal. Its smaller, lighter, can carry more ammunition, and still does a pretty good job against trucks, infantry, and helicopters."
TankPorn,2w79o9,killswitch247,2,Wed Feb 18 15:12:15 2015 UTC,"The Soviets/Russians clearly believe in the concept, or at least appreciate the flexibility. But Im not really sure why they feel that way. I do know that theyre pretty singular in that regard though. The Germans never believed in the gun/launcher concept, favoring traditional guns. And the US is pretty soured on the concept.   did the u.s. even invest in the development of capable anti tank guns during that time? the m60's 105mm gun was a british design and the abrams' 120mm is a german one, so it might be possible that the americans had abandoned the high velocity tank gun research/development altogether for a few years."
TankPorn,2w79o9,LeuCeaMia,2,Fri Feb 20 13:30:05 2015 UTC,"The 105 mm L7(as the X15E8) competed with newly developed guns.    The 105mm T254 - American gun compatible with L7 rounds The 120mm T123E6 - basically a light weight version of the M103's M58 gun, it fits inside M48A2 like the rest of the guns. The smoothbore 90 mm T208E9.   The T254 won and the T254E2 was standardized as the M68.  The 152 mm XM150E5 was concurrent to the development of the 120 mm being fitted to the MBT-70 and KPz 70 respectively. The XM150E5 was basically a longer higher velocity version of the M60A2's gun. It could fire APFSDS with performance equal to or exceeding that of the 105 mm M68's.  The Rheinmetall 120mm is actually the result of the Germans continuing development of the American smoothbore 120 mm Delta gun, which the Americans dropped early in the MBT-70 program."
TankPorn,2w79o9,BeondTheGrave,1 point,Fri Feb 20 15:38:13 2015 UTC,"The United States developed a 120mm gun for the MBT project, called the DELTA gun system. The DELTA was beat out early by the 152mm launcher, but the Germans insisted that a 120mm gun also be developed for the MBT project. They took the design work for the DELTA, and eventually used a modified version to put on the German MBT-70. That gun in turn was modified for the Leo2.   But as far as the US is concerned, the Shillelagh project really put American gun development on the backburner for about 10 years, and put us a little bit behind European NATO in terms of tank gun development. It wasnt a huge issue, because we could and still can just use British and German guns, as well as American made ammunition, but the Shillelagh did take time, energy, and money away from other conventional gun development projects.  Though, I should also point out that the m60 and M60A1 were still armed with a British gun, so there might be deeper reasons why the Americans seem to like using British and German guns."

TankPorn,2w79o9,BeondTheGrave,8,Tue Feb 17 18:50:33 2015 UTC,"The M60 and M60A1 have pretty big turrets. The M60 was not only tall, but it was wide, which gave the enemy a lot of turret to try and hit. This was partially necessary to incorporate the breech of the 105mm gun, as well as the ammunition and a comfortable crew space. The M60A2 reduced the frontal area of the turret by moving the Gunner and Loader down, while the commander was moved to sit in line with the breech (under where you see the Cupola). This reduced the frontal area of the tank, as well as the total weight of the turret. And because the 152mm gun/launcher is so much smaller than the 105mm, it didnt negatively impact the the firing performance of the tank. Well, no more negatively than giving the tank the 152mm in the first place."

I've always been interested that Western tanks didn't have their own through-the-tube missiles when the Soviets had it with the T-64 and T-80.  I know of the STAFF rounds and such, but it never seemed like they took off much."
TankPorn,2w79o9,BeondTheGrave,5,Tue Feb 17 21:46:40 2015 UTC,"The 152mm gun could also fire HEAT and White Phosphorus ammunition. There was attempts to design KE projectiles for the tank, but it never panned out. The KE rounds often broke when they were fired, which is very bad.   The main issue with the Western missiles was that they wernt as efficient as KE rounds at shorter distances, and the accuracy of the rounds was usually lower than promised. Proponents of the gun/launcher system argued that missiles could achieve 90% accuracy and a guaranteed 1st-round kill in the 2-3000 meter range. That was a massive over estimation of their accuracy, and after the deployment of ceramic composite armor and ERA panels, HEAT rounds couldnt even guarantee a first round kill.   The main difference between the American and Soviet designs is that the Soviets made their missiles an extra kind of ammunition, while the American program focused on making missiles the primary ammunition. I think that the failure of the Shillelagh soured Americans and Germans on the whole tank missile launcher. And given the predominance of APFSDS ammunition, there isnt much of a reason to deploy HEAT based missiles anyway.   But Im not sure why the Soviets adopted their own missiles. I imagine the early program was an attempt to explore the concept which the Americans were so enamoured with. But the fact that theyre included on the T-80 and the T-90 (I think) suggests that they have found some value in the concept. Im not exactly sure what they think the advantage is, but I know that after Shillelagh, the Americans have completely rejected the idea."
TankPorn,2w79o9,onacho,1 point,Tue Feb 17 22:51:02 2015 UTC,"I've always thought it was, perhaps, to compensate for a deficiency in the long-range accuracy of their guns as compared to the Western 120mm."

TankPorn,2w37cf,generic93,3,Mon Feb 16 21:43:08 2015 UTC,"If you load a round into the breach, usually HEAT, it acts as a plug and prevents air from getting into the tank.  If you need to fire that round, the breach can be set to prevent the spent shell from ejecting."
TankPorn,2w37cf,Cromptown,3,Mon Feb 16 21:57:09 2015 UTC,"Not to mention the NBC system pressurizes the crew compartment, so ejection of the round theoretically wouldn't compromise the crew compartment so long as the loader was quick."
TankPorn,2w37cf,TankerD18,4,Mon Feb 16 22:07:26 2015 UTC,"i feel like there needs to be a little clarification. The ammunition is semi-combustible so the spent shell is more just an end piece and all soviet tanks since the T-64 have used auto-loaders which allows for a more effective NBC system. You're correct that the pressurized crew compartment keeps contaminants out and that, combined with more efficient bore evacuation due to the auto-loader, is what keeps the NBC system up."

Also, as a loader, if I was in an AoE and I had the NBC system working, I wouldn't open the breach unless I was in my personal NBC gear.  Even with the bore evacuator and over-pressurization, I don't think a human would be able to reload the cannon fast enough to not contaminate the fighting compartment."

TankPorn,2w37cf,bluedistraction,2,Mon Feb 16 23:34:02 2015 UTC,nope. Theoretically they can maintain the NBC system indefinitely even while firing.

It comprised large cast irregular shape structures of variable thickness and slope. The all-cast front part of the hull was rounded in shape with thin armour panels against HEAT projectiles, which ran around the edges of the front and sides of the hull. The sides of the hull were also cast and had similar protective armour panels.  The all-cast turret, with a maximum armor thickness of 319 mm,[2] was rounded and had anti-HEAT protective panels.

The death of the concept wasn't entirely due to the end of the Cold War per se - rather, the incorporation of traversing sensors (commander's independent sight, RWS and so on), the use of digital interfaces to collate the visual inputs at the disposal of vehicle commanders and the simple realisation that gun ports compromised protection meant that they were, for the most part, omitted in later designs and armoured over where they existed."

I was bracing myself for a bunch of BS but was pleasantly surprised... oh wait I spoke too soon, there he goes. 30 to 50% of Shermans broke down? lol, the Sherman had a readiness rate of about 80% during the war.  1/10 did not like the video, the narrator was annoying for both his ignorance and his bad jokes, and it bothers me that someone who obviously has so little interest in tanks got to participate in something like that.  Also, I like how in the side by side comparison of the two Shermans he was comparing two M4s that were of totally different production runs. Seriously, what the hell.  What a bunch of garbage."

This T-34 was legitimately knocked out by the Germans - you can see the evidence of fire along where the roadwheels have had their rubber rims burned off.  It also appears that the driver's hatch is missing, perhaps blown off.  It may have taken a hit and shed the track somewhere behind, or the track might subsequently have been removed for some other reason.  It looks like the bow gunner's MG is also gone.

The gun hasn't been traversed at all.  There's no sign of any penetration whatsoever nor any ricochets. This tank probably hasn't seen any combat at all.  It looks like they cleanly dismounted every piece of removable equipment. There no sign of damaged tow cables, MG, fuel boxes, spare track links, shovel, tool box, headlamps and of course the driver's hatch (there's no deformity or damage to what's left of the hinge).

Marching into Darkness convincingly shows how and why these atrocities could occur. A major contribution. (Karel C.

The M4A3E8, firing 76 mm HVAP rounds, was a closer match to the T-34-85 as both tanks could destroy each other at normal combat ranges; however, the HVAP round gave the M4A3E8 an advantage in penetration."

HE, not so much as there isn't a ton of penetration with those.  The APFSDS rounds (whatever the newest incarnations are, I've been out quite a while now) might be too much - they might just cut right through leaving little holes on the way in and out.

The T34 would still scare the hell out of me as a dismount without a javelin/tow or something similar with me though."

It's riged like that to increase overall thickness while using less paste.  It's not known whether it actually worked though."
TankPorn,2vq9me,ExplosiveMachine,1 point,Fri Feb 13 09:25:59 2015 UTC,I am not 100% sure on this but I think Germany was the only nation in ww2 that used magnetic mines and they assumed the enemy would have these mines too. They stopped using Zimmerit when they thought it could cause fires.

Which sounds pretty reasonable. It also makes no sense for Russians to send these relics to the rebels when they have other more modern tanks coming out the wazooo in their stock piles. If you're going to go to the effort to send them tanks, why waste that effort on relative crap. You can hide a T-55 or T-72 just as well as those antiques, and if you're not worried about doing it on the sly, again - why send crap."

TankPorn,2vpxi1,Luneworm,-9,Sat Feb 14 01:37:20 2015 UTC,"So many commonly used arguments in one reply! Here goes: The biggest lie is that Russia of pro-Russian rebels have shot down the passenger liner. Had it been so, the proof woud have been all over the media at once. Now, the investigation of the incident is being conducted in complete secresy - and Russian experts have been excluded, Russian MoD has published satellite imagery of a Ukrainian fighter jet launching an air-to-air missile into the jet. All the advocates of the anti-Russian theory have so far failed to provide concrete evidence. There are reportedly a lot of volunteers from Russia, even military personnel on un-paid leave. However, several Western journalists that interviewed the rebels AND representatives of the OSCE never found any Russian military personnel as such. On the other hand, there are several incidents with Russian paratroopes dying in 'training' wth no official eplanation, also reported in the Russian media. Keep in mind that the regions now under the control of the rebel used to have military storage facilities, so that partly explains the absence of suppy shortage. Another explanation is that Ukrainian military lost a lot in the operations. I understand that both sides to the conflict  propagate and advocate their point of view in the media, and there's massive propaganda from both sides - I cringe at RT's news, too! I only ask of  anyone reading this to keep an open mind. EDIT: u/0000013 I suggest you pm me if you want to debate a bit more. Although I'd rather delete everything than carry on this mind-poisoning discussion. Upvote for 'no more politics'"
TankPorn,2vpxi1,Bearmanly,5,Fri Feb 13 12:29:16 2015 UTC,"The ""photograph"" of the Su-27 launching a missile at the airliner was pretty obviously faked considering how close it depicted the two aircraft."

SU25 cannot reach high enough to shoot down a cruising passenger jet  military personnel on unpaid leave usually dont get to bring their AFV with them- at least not in the western world. We used to ask if we could take tanks on a night leave to the city but apparently its not permitted by regulations and also any traffic via public roads will need to be informed to the road authorities so tehy know if tehy need to fix messed-up roads.  but i digress. no politics. so im afraid you personally are going to suffer from the sanctions for a while, ukrainians are gonna enjoy their civil war as long as Putin keeps it going, and the west is gonna keep pouting.  Oh, did you by the way read that the new peace proposal listed 9A52-4 Tornados as one of the systems which will have to be called off the conflict zone? because funny enough, the only nation having the mentioned artillery piece is russian federation.  well, guess they got lost in the mail to leningrad oblast or something."

TankPorn,2vpxi1,itstanktime,8,Fri Feb 13 02:00:34 2015 UTC,"Sometimes HE and being mostly bullet proof is all you need. They did their fair share in Bosnia in the 90s.   You could think of it this way too; way easier to keep running then a modern MBT, still has comparable maneuverability to semi modern armor and can still pen a semi modern tank from the sides in an ambush.   Any AT weapon carried by infantry now is going to go through it, but it will also give hell on the battlefield if anti armor forces are not actively hunting them.   Also, pretty much disposable as an AFV. No one but collectors are going to miss them if they get destroyed or otherwise lost."

Supporting the infantry, lobbing HE-frag and working the coax is a tank's main job, at least that's how the Soviets loaded them up for. It's not like they have to use them in an AT role against T-64s. The T-34-85 is still better armed and armoured than any AFV in the Philippine Army, and numerous other third world armies."

TankPorn,2vpxi1,itstanktime,1 point,Sat Feb 14 04:12:02 2015 UTC,"Also, it will force the Ukrainian Army to carry a more mixed load on their tanks. APDS rounds will likely over penetrate a t-34 leaving it mostly operable. The Israelis and Americans have had that problem fighting old Soviet armor in the past."
TankPorn,2vpxi1,0000013,2,Fri Feb 13 04:26:00 2015 UTC,"I seriously doubt this.  not that it will overpenetrate, but that anyone is retarded enough to stay inside a tank that has been perforated with an APDS round.  the fighting compartment in tanks are excessively cramped, and in anything made by soviets doubly so. So firing an APDS through tehre from ANY angle at ANY spot will:  a) break something or someone real bad. b) cause anyone with their senses to bumfuck off from the vehicle in question faster than a snowball out of hell.  furtheron, even if you have APDS ready and you see a soft target, you use the APDS and then load a new shell of the type you need rather than unload the one you have ready.  as for t-34 not being usable- they certainly are NOT easier to operate than T-72 due to spare parts being less abundant and the wear and tear being 70 years rather than 35 logistically but a cannon is always a cannon, so for all intents and purposes an 85mm gun can still make a orders of magnitude larger holes in stuff than your personal firearma nd from much farther range.  then again this is not part of teh topic since the topic has already been debuffed with reason: absolutely no reason for russians to import t-34s when they can just keep blitzing their t-72s, SPAA and Grads across teh border and having VDV ""get lost"" on the wrong side of border with their equipment"
TankPorn,2vpxi1,hydrogenjoule,1 point,Fri Feb 13 10:40:03 2015 UTC,you use the APDS and then load a new shell of the type you need rather than unload the one you have ready.   Especially on an autoloader tank!
TankPorn,2vpxi1,0000013,1 point,Fri Feb 13 14:54:30 2015 UTC,"i think an autoloader can swap shells (and if so it is easier than with manual loader- cranking a Rheinmetall L/44 open by hand, then extracting and storing the sabot round, then putting in a HEAT one takes about the same time as firing the sabot, loading heat, firing that heat and loading another sabot) but the point is moot- its 99/100 times faster to just fire twice unless you have the time (waiting in ambush) or absolutely have to conserve ammo.  shooting at infantry (was referring to vehicles as soft targets) is ofc a different thing entirely."
TankPorn,2vpxi1,itstanktime,1 point,Fri Feb 13 15:48:40 2015 UTC,"It is super easy to pull a round from a 120, open the breach with one lever swing and pull the round out. However, you just usually fire what's in there and load the next round. It is much easier and safer then trying to put the round back in the rack and pull out the proper one. It takes a typical Russian autoloader about 7 seconds to reload. I am not sure how long or if it can unload a round once chambered by the mech."
TankPorn,2vpxi1,0000013,1 point,Sat Feb 14 19:19:57 2015 UTC,"as steated, its not HARD, but it damn sure isnt FAST to swap rounds. oh and add into the time it takes to load the heat the time it takes when you fuck your intercom cable around the HEAT shell- i have NO IDEA why it happens but it tends to happen way too often in training- sabot, no problem, HEAT, your cord is around the thing."

The best course of action would be to engage with whatever and then a follow up shot if there are not flames shooting out of the hatches."

TankPorn,2vpxi1,itstanktime,1 point,Sun Feb 15 07:09:11 2015 UTC,"As far as over penetration goes, APSD will tend to knock the crew unconscious for a little bit (if the hatches are closed) and just moderately damage the tank. Thin armor doesn't produce much spall and doesn't trap the round so it tends to just pass through, negating the biggest damaging effects from the round. This happened to the Isrealis enough that they ended up shooting tanks till they changed shape or suffered obvious catastrophic damage. In the battle of 73 Eastings, the only American death was from a BMP-1 (very light IFV) who took a sabot round that disabled the vehicle but did not knock it out. The gunner was able to fire a 73mm round into the turret of a brad killing the TC. This is after it was engaged by an M1 with a 120mm sabot.   Spares are pretty plentiful for the t-34 and you can always cannibalize damaged vehicles in the field for parts. Also, almost nothing on the vehicle is electric minus the turret traverse mech. Everything is controlled by long metal rods that run to the engine compartment. It is super super easy to make most of the parts for it out of mild steal and junk just laying around. The engine is really reliable. As long as you are able to turn it over, it will work. The steering is the old track brake system as apposed to a cross drive like the t-72/t-64 and up have. Really easy to repair.   Lastly, it is a lot easier to give a T-34 to a novice crew and have them be semi effective with it then a T-72. The T-72 isn't really that easy to operate if you do not have good training. The T-34 can be operated by anyone who could drive a tractor and learn to stuff rounds in the maingun."
TankPorn,2vpxi1,0000013,1 point,Sat Feb 14 19:16:49 2015 UTC,"on the overpenetration thing and the BMP- it takes a crew with balls of steel or zero self preservation to actually continue fighting after a shot like that.  plus BMP has a ton more ""empty space"" considering that theres the entire infantry compartment in the back."
TankPorn,2vpxi1,itstanktime,1 point,Sun Feb 15 06:49:07 2015 UTC,Apparently the BMP was immobile from a penetrating shot. If the turret was functional it probably passed through the front slope and then the pack on the TC's side. The driver probably got gibblitted.

The only excitement there had been when an M8 armored car from Troop B destroyed a Tiger tank. The armored car had been in a concealed position near the boundary of Troop B, 87th Cavalry Reconnaissance Squadron and Company A, 38th Armored Infantry Battalion, when the Tiger approached the lines at right angles to move along a trail in front of the main line of resistance. As the tank passed the armored car, the latter slipped out of position and started up the trail behind the Tiger, accelerating in an attempt to close. At the same moment the German tank commander saw the M8, and started traversing his gun to bear on it. It was a race between the Americans, who were attempting to close so that their 37-mm gun would be effective on the Tiger’s thin rear armor, and the Germans, who were desperately striving to bring their 88 to bear. Rapidly the M8 closed to 25 yards, and quickly pumped in three rounds; the lumbering Tiger stopped and shuddered; there was a muffled explosion, followed by flames which billowed out of the turret and engine ports, after which the armored car returned to its position.

TankPorn,2vmj70,unknownchild,3,Thu Feb 19 04:42:54 2015 UTC,"Question: wasn't the Sherman called a ""Ronson"" on account of its tendency to catch fire (rather than set fire to someone else)?  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M4_Sherman"
TankPorn,2vmj70,barbaracelarent,6,Thu Feb 12 13:55:31 2015 UTC,"Not exactly. There is a lot of debate about where that name originated, in large part because no one has been able to find an example of that Ronson slogan in prewar advertising beyond one ad which has a somewhat similar slogan from 1927. Ronson did use that slogan in the 50s however.   What's a lot more likely in my opinion is that that nickname is a postwar creation, just like the name Hetzer for that German TD is. Ronson actually made flamethrowers for the Sherman during the war though, and those tanks were sometimes called Ronsons, or Zippos (Zippo made flamethrowers too). So I personally believe that that name was co-opted to refer to the Shermans tendency to burn when knocked out. Which I should point out was not an unusual characteristic for tanks of the era, and indeed the Sherman wasn't even a particularly bad offender in that area. The Panzer IV was noted by Allied studies to be even worse for instance.   So the answer is that while it is possible that the tanks were called Ronsons during the war to refer to their tendency to burn, it's unlikely given the dearth of prewar Ronson advertising carrying such a slogan."

But, of course, this is a national museum, and we all know that people go to these places because you want to see things that you won't see elsewhere.

TankPorn,2vesfj,Mrprocrastinaut,10,Tue Feb 10 12:18:54 2015 UTC,"Still useful for more lightly armored targets, and especially against buildings and structures."
TankPorn,2vesfj,Mrprocrastinaut,4,Tue Feb 10 13:46:41 2015 UTC,To be honest I think that a conventional HE shell is just as suitable and effective for those roles.
TankPorn,2vesfj,Mrprocrastinaut,13,Tue Feb 10 13:48:22 2015 UTC,"Actually HESH is more effective than HE: HESH was originally designed during the second world war to be an anti-structural weapon, known as ""wallbuster"" rounds for use in urban warfare. Their effect against man made structures is far greater than that of conventional HE because of the way HESH is supposed to squash against the target. Also, HE produces a lot fragmentation which is a risk to friendly infantry in urban operations, whereas HESH produces very little. Also, HE has very little anti-armour capability, unlike HESH."
TankPorn,2vesfj,Mrprocrastinaut,-4,Tue Feb 10 14:58:50 2015 UTC,"Against a reinforced bunker, HESH would be more useful, but against a conventional urban structure I would think that an HE shell entering a room and exploding is pretty effective.  Against armor, a direct hit from a large caliber HE shell will easily put an MBT out of action even if it doesn't penetrate, and against light armor like an APC or self-propelled gun it would have no problem going through.  edit: downvoters, I'd like to see your argument if you disagree ;)"
TankPorn,2vesfj,Mrprocrastinaut,9,Tue Feb 10 15:06:10 2015 UTC,"No, HESH is very much more effective against most urban structures and not just the most heavily reinforced ones, without the frag risk to friendly troops. Civilians structures can be reinforced to resist the effects of a HE shell, and even conventional reinforced concrete can be a tough nut to crack.  As for HE knocking out any main battle tank, yeah I don't think so. It can certainly do a lot of damage to external equipment like sights, radio aerials, equipment containers etc, but knocking one out is unlikely."
TankPorn,2vesfj,carl_pagan,3,Tue Feb 10 15:18:06 2015 UTC,"Not sure about that, have a look at this demonstration of the Bofors 3P 40mm HE shell.  It will penetrate 18mm of RHA, meaning most armored vehicles short of an MBT would be vulnerable, or 6 inches of reinforced concrete.  We're talking about a 40mm shell here, a 120mm tank main gun is at least an order of magnitude more powerful.   It can certainly do a lot of damage to external equipment like sights, radio aerials, equipment containers etc, but knocking one out is unlikely.   Added to the possibility of blowing off a track, all that damage you mentioned would render a tank combat ineffective, at least a mission kill and probably a mobility kill."
TankPorn,2vesfj,killswitch247,10,Tue Feb 10 15:34:59 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, we can agree each round has its strengths and weaknesses against a variety of targets. I still disagree on engaging tanks with high explosive shells: Can HE badly damage a tank? Without a doubt. Is HE a guaranteed kill (mobility or otherwise) against an MBT? Definitely not. Does it even matter what effect HE has against opposing MBT's when you will be engaging these sorts of targets with APFSDS or HEAT anyway? No it doesn't."
TankPorn,2vesfj,hopsafoobar,2,Tue Feb 10 15:55:00 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying that an HE round is the best round to use against an MBT, but if you're desperate and manage to land a direct hit it will probably work.  Shells from Soviet 152mm SP guns for example could not generally penetrate the armor of the German heavies they were up against during WW2 but were still successful when it came to putting them out of action."
TankPorn,2vesfj,global336,7,Tue Feb 10 16:02:46 2015 UTC,"Yes or course, desperate times desperate measures. The use of 152mm guns as anti tank weapons was very interesting, the sheer power of the blast would often tear off the turret or kill the crew through spalling. Another interesting anecdote I read comes from the Siege of Sevastopol: the 305mm guns of the Maxim Gorky battery engaged and destroyed German tanks by firing solid steel practice shots when they ran out of HE rounds:    On June 17 30th battery was completely encircled. Next day it fired all remaining live shells. Battery gunners used whole shots, which were stored before war for training purposes. One such shot torn off turret of the German tank, which tried to fire from Sofia Perovsky state farm. When no more shells remains in stock, battery fired 70 kg powder charges, three at once, and lucky shot, producing jet stream of powder gases with temperature up to 1000 degrees Celsius, reportedly, could obliterate approaching German infantrymen    Source"
TankPorn,2vesfj,Hwatwasthat,2,Tue Feb 10 16:14:47 2015 UTC,"Against armor, a direct hit from a large caliber HE shell will easily put an MBT out of action even if it doesn't penetrate,    You are probably right about that. I don't think even a Modern MBT would be in good shape after a direct hit from a 155mm artillery shell."
TankPorn,2vesfj,P-01S,3,Thu Feb 12 06:09:30 2015 UTC,"To be honest with stuff like Excalibur available these days that can drop out of the sky almost vertically practically guaranteeing a direct hit with upbeat prog rock playing in the background, the shell would have little difficultly in penetrating the relatively thin top armor of a modern MBT and blowing it apart.    Since there's no practical way you can really increase the armor sufficiently in this area the way of the future would be to actually intercept the shell before it hits."
TankPorn,2vesfj,P-01S,5,Thu Feb 12 10:14:00 2015 UTC,conventional he shells usually contain more metal for 'shrapnells' than explosive material and the explosive force goes in all directions. hesh shells contain far more explosive and the majority force is directed towards the front.

TankPorn,2vduoi,Big_ol_Bro,15,Tue Feb 10 05:11:57 2015 UTC,"The original US-made M3 got the nickname ""Lee"" and once the british got their limey hands on it and configured it to suit their needs   (removed the THIRD turret on top of the entire thing housing one machinegun because they figured that one turret and two guns for 1 tank is already tad too much moving parts per tank you very much and moved the radio into the commanders position from the front)  they realized they need to rename it so people dont get mixed up. So being british and figuring out that the original was named after Lee, they named their configuration after his colleague on the other side of the war, Grant."
TankPorn,2vduoi,0000013,8,Tue Feb 10 05:55:26 2015 UTC,"i think Britain named the Lee, too. In WW2 the US was in the habit of referring to tanks by number and type (the M3 Light, M3 Medium, M4 Medium), and when they entered British service they'd be named for a Civil War general (Stuart, Grant & Lee,  and Sherman). The UK operated some M3s with the US-pattern turret(s) (as the Lee) and some with the UK-pattern one (as the Grant)."
TankPorn,2vduoi,BigRedS,3,Tue Feb 10 07:30:19 2015 UTC,"very likely, because as i recall it none of the ""names"" were really design-approved but given later on- and the ""official"" listing name for the lee in US inventory was Medium tank, M3"
TankPorn,2vduoi,0000013,3,Tue Feb 10 09:34:26 2015 UTC,"Britain named all of the WWII tanks, as far as I am aware."
TankPorn,2vduoi,P-01S,2,Tue Feb 10 22:50:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I know they started getting official names at some point, but I'm not sure when. At a guess it's when they stopped being Civil War generals, but I'm not hot enough on US history to be able to spot which those are."
TankPorn,2vduoi,BigRedS,10,Tue Feb 10 23:16:29 2015 UTC,Who's the dickhead that downvoted a legitimate question? Not everybody knows the difference between the two.
TankPorn,2vduoi,GeorgeWShrub,6,Tue Feb 10 05:24:01 2015 UTC,"The Grant and the Lee are both names given by the British. The Americans produced the M3 as a stopgap until something better was possible (the Sherman).  The British were shown the M3 and requested a version with something like 50 modifications, most notably a new cast turret with room for the radio and a regular cupola in place of the commander's blister turret. Minor stuff to, like a cloth cover for the sponson gun for use in desert combat and some decent sized cargo boxes.  The new variant was dubbed the Grant, and the original American pattern the Lee, to prevent confusion. Having vehicles with guns quickly became more important than getting them to exact specifications, so the British ended up with both Grants and Lees."

TankPorn,2vduoi,Bommer-Sooner,2,Tue Feb 10 19:47:32 2015 UTC,"Yes, Infantry Fighting Vehicle. At no point in it's design was it ever thought to engage tanks one on one. It is designed to carry infantry around the battlefield and provide support for them. At no point has the army ever, even once, had as it's go to plan be to engage enemy tanks with Bradleys as a first option."
TankPorn,2vduoi,jdmgto,3,Tue Feb 10 20:03:33 2015 UTC,At no point in it's design was it ever thought to engage tanks one on one.   Which is why it has a TOW missile launcher in addition to an autocannon?  The development program for the Bradley was such a clusterfuck that there is a comedy movie about it. Edit: And congressional hearings...
TankPorn,2vduoi,P-01S,2,Tue Feb 10 22:52:55 2015 UTC,There's a difference between being designed to engage tanks and having an emergency back up.
TankPorn,2vduoi,jdmgto,3,Tue Feb 10 22:54:56 2015 UTC,"It was designed so that it can engage tanks. It was never meant to be a tank hunter, but not insignificant amounts of weight, expense, and interior room are taken away from allowing the Bradley to carry troops and are instead devoted to allowing the Bradley to fight tanks.  During the development phase, the Bradley was redesigned with the TOW launcher in mind. It isn't like bolting an MG mount to a jeep."
TankPorn,2vduoi,P-01S,3,Wed Feb 11 00:53:23 2015 UTC,"I thought the M3 was designed to engage tanks while scouting (for the M1, of course). That's its primary differentiator from the M2 - a TOW armament giving it a modicum of anti-tank shoot-and-scoot ability."

TankPorn,2v68sb,Shaz-bot,4,Sun Feb 8 12:37:18 2015 UTC,"There was mixture of antifreeze, water and corrosion inhibitors contained in chambers around the ammo. Still most of the improvement in survivability came from relocating the ammo down low.  From : Sherman Minutia   The 1950's rebuild specifications included an order to convert the tanks to dry stowage. The ""wet"" part of ""wet stowage"" had been somewhat questionable from the start. Each 5 round 76mm ammunition rack had 3 sealed chambers that were filled with liquid. It was thought that if the ammo rack was penetrated, the liquid would be dispersed, and at least slow the progress of an ammunition fire in order to give the crew a few more seconds to escape. Above, several of the racks are shown in place. We've circled the filler plugs of the liquid containers, including the one for the 6 round ready rack mounted on the turret basket floor. Some of the men involved in the wet stowage program were not convinced of the worth of the liquid chambers, and requested additional comparative trials. They noted that relocating the ammo bins to better protected positions on the floor of the hull (as the British had requested in 1942) was the most effective part of the modification. They also mentioned that tankers wanted to carry as much ammo as possible, and the inclusion of the liquid chambers came at the expense of an additional 10 to 12 rounds. In any case, the rebuild specification directed that the ammo racks be drained, and the filler holes plugged."

What about the part where Britain and France rejected the proposals for an alliance against the Nazis, why they made the non-aggression pact in the first place.   Jeez I wonder why they thought they could get a piece of Poland. Why they still signed it even when the Anti-Comintern Pact was already set in place by the Axis. Maybe, its because Britain and France signed the bloody Munich Dictate behind the backs of their Czechoslovak ""allies"". The ensuing sitzkrieg just proved them right. Bending over backwards meant forgetting what it means to be an ally apparently.    The Allies generally bent over backwards to avoid war.   FYI you seem forgetting that by definition the Soviets are part of the ""Allies"", the original UN of 1942, as is China.

I don't know the variants that well but Fury was set in '45 so some enhanced version of the Sherman is plausible. Just curious which one was closest.  When they first go into the town, one of the following Shermans appears to have a much smaller caliber gun on it. You only see it briefly, it might have been a 37mm bore. Was I actually looking at a Sherman or something else entirely?  At one point grenades are used from inside the Sherman to the outside. They are ""tossed"" from the crew compartment not the cupola. Where exactly were the side hatches located in order to get the grenades out?"

Was I actually looking at a Sherman or something else entirely? - If I had the clip from the movie, I could help here, however, if I was to make a guess, it is possible it was an early production model armed with the initial 75mm M3 L/40 gun, which would have looked smaller in caliber due to the fact that they do not have a muzzle brake like the 76mm M1 gun does.  At one point grenades are used from inside the Sherman to the outside. They are ""tossed"" from the crew compartment not the cupola. Where exactly were the side hatches located in order to get the grenades out? - http://www.strijdbewijs.nl/ardennen/bas02.jpg  http://moore-familytree.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/Moore-sydney-M4-Sherman-Tank.jpg  There are two loading hatches on both sides of the turret it would be possible to do so."

This is exactly correct. I rewatched it and it was the perspective of the Sherman w/ 75mm behind the Sherman w/ muzzle brake.    There are two loading hatches on both sides of the turret it would be possible to do so.   Correct again. On rewatch I saw the crew reach up & out with the grenades on either side. So loading hatches it was."
TankPorn,2v7lxr,maxout2142,3,Mon Feb 9 00:48:46 2015 UTC,"I will try and keep this spoiler free.  My main questions are these:  Was the Sherman depicted an Easy 8 variant? I don't know the variants that well but Fury was set in '45 so some enhanced version of the Sherman is plausible. Just curious which one was closest.  When they first go into the town, one of the following Shermans appears to have a much smaller caliber gun on it. You only see it briefly, it might have been a 37mm bore.

Where exactly were the side hatches located in order to get the grenades out?   Yes it was an m4a3e8 ""easy eight"".  Easiest identifiers being the 76mm gun and the hvss suspension and tracks.  I'm not sure what scene your referring to but there was no m4 with a 37 in the movie or otherwise.  There were a few other variants seen in the movie, I know the 75mm was on one of the ones accompanying them and I believe the other was the variant with the 105mm howitzer.  I watched it when it first came out so I may be wrong but that's how I remember it.  I remember the grenade scene but not the specifics.  But they had the two front hatches for the driver and co-driver/machine gunner, plus the two on top of the turret, plus there was the ones on the sides of the turret to choose from.  As I recall they were all chucking grenades profusely from every hole in the tank.. Hehe."
TankPorn,2v7lxr,TouniXVIII,1 point,Mon Feb 9 14:03:35 2015 UTC,"I rewatched it last night for better context. The ""small"" barrel Sherman is the perspective shot they used. It is farther back behind the lead one and in comparison to the muzzle brake on the lead, the standard 75mm looks dinky. It only is a few frames but that was the impression it left.  Found the tank used, from the wiki -  ""The Bovington Tank Museum's M4A2E8 Sherman in 2009, the tank which portrayed Fury in the film; A2 versions are visually very similar to M4A3E8s, the principal US Army late war model and the type depicted in Fury""  Before I watched Fury, I had no idea there were so many variants on the M4. As of this morning, I've read a bit about all of them. I also realized that the M4 went from a late interwar design to pretty damn capable in sort order. New respect for them I guess."

And as a commander you kinda want to see around as much as you can. thats why most of the commander hatches on modern tanks are designed around the idea ""how can we open this without exposing ourselves (leopard 2 up to a4/can we open it a BIT and peek out whilst it gives us cover (merkava)"
TankPorn,2v7lxr,maxout2142,-1,Wed Feb 11 02:50:03 2015 UTC,Getting shot by typical (heavy) German fire or loosing 10-20 degrees of view in every direction in safety. Choices.
TankPorn,2v7lxr,0000013,2,Tue Feb 10 10:03:17 2015 UTC,"That ""safety"" is dubious when you consider the possible consequence being missing a threat to the whole tank you included.  a TC peeking out of an open hatch -especially in a moving tank- really is a very small target. ofc this doesnt mean you should have your entire head and upper torso out, thats just movie posing.  germans especially lost many tank commanders due to this because they saw it as way too valuable an advantage compared to untrained russians in 1941-43 who buttoned up the first moment they saw or heard the first gunshot and lost their sense of surroundings completely.  you dont realize how much of ones visual understanding of their surroundings relies on the allowed field of view until youve tried it yourself, really."

TankPorn,2v7lxr,LeuCeaMia,2,Thu Feb 12 05:09:14 2015 UTC,"Red orchestra has nothing to do with simulators really. Seriously.   you really think that RO has anything to do with ""simulation"" and youre fundamentally going wrong.  WHY? because in RO, the combat is very limited. both teams have X amounts of players and X amounts of vehicles, and you can see it with tab hence, you know there are X amount of tanks, and you only have X amount of areas to look for- quite unlike real life. You also always fight in a terrain youve fought in previously, and terrain that is videogame- no bogging down, no sudden rocks, no ditches. Seriously, trying to draw any conclusions from red orchestra in figuring out how world war 2 was fought is frankly very retarded.  you also have only one ""standing up"" mode, which is literally sticking your frigging head out like a parade dummy.  all these are fundamentally wrong.   in real life, you arent ""safe"" inside your tank in combat, and never have been since the frigging birth of the tank. And im not talking merely about AT weapons. anything that can immobilize you can kill you, and for a sherman a sudden very unfortunate rock or depression is all that is needed for it. Also using the terrain to the fullest is the first key to staying alive  ESPECIALLY BECAUSE UNLIKE IN VIDEO GAMES YOU NEVER KNOW THE EXACT AMOUNT AND CAPABILITY OF ENEMY AT AT THE SITE and in this a single glance with your full FOV can give you tons of more visula information on your surroundings than a minute-long peeking session from 3 frontal windows of your cupola.  as a TC, your task is to command the tank, and that includes knowing where to go with it and how to position it- which means having as good picture of your surroundings as possible.  there is a reason you dont understand this and the reason is youve never SEEN the difference yourself between being limited to your cupola and being able to check the surroundings.  Also, you dont understand how fucking small target a TC who pops out or peeks just at the edge of his hatch is from past 100 meters. it is NOT red-orchestra type massive target, ok?  lets quote the one guy who usually starts this conversation: otto carius mkay?  “The most important consideration came after all the material conditions were filled. The personal aggressiveness of the commander while observing was decisive for success against numerically vastly superior enemy formations. The lack of good observation by the Russians often resulted in the defeat of large units. Tank commanders who slam their hatches shut at the beginning of an attack and don’t open them again until the objective has been reached are useless, or at least second rate. There are, of course, six to eight vision blocks mounted in a circle in every cupola that allow observation. But they are only good for a certain sector of the terrain, limited by the size of the individual vision block. If the commander is looking through the left vision block when an anti-tank gun opens fire from the right, then he will need a long time before he identifies it from inside the buttoned up tank.  “Unfortunately, impacting rounds are felt before the sound of the enemy gun’s report, because the speed of the round is greater than the speed of sound. Therefore, a tank commander’s eyes are more important than his ears. As a result of rounds exploding in the vicinity, one doesn’t hear the gun’s report at all in the tank. It is quite different whenever the tank commander raises his head occasionally in an open hatch to survey the terrain. If he happens to look halfway to the left while an enemy antitank gun opens fire halfway to the right, his eye will subconsciously catch the shimmer of the yellow muzzle flash. His attention will immediately be directed toward the new direction and the target will usually be identified in time. Everything depends on the proper identification of a dangerous target. Usually, seconds decide. What I said above also applies to tanks that have been equipped with a periscope. … “No one can deny that the many casualties among the officers and other tank commanders were due to exposing their heads. But these men didn’t die in vain. If they had moved with closed hatches, then many more men would have found their death or been severely wounded inside the tanks. The large Russian tank losses is proof of the correctness of this assertion. Fortunately for us, they almost always drove cross-country buttoned up. Of course, every tank commander had to be careful while peering out during positional warfare. Especially since the turret hatches of tanks in the front lines were continuously watched by enemy sharpshooters. Even a short exposure could be fatal for the tank commander. I had commanded a folding artillery scope for just such cases. Actually, such a scope shouldn’t be missing in any fighting vehicle.”  TL;DR its dangerous but whole tank dying due to not identifying a threat is far more dangerous."

TankPorn,2v32gx,bamaster,2,Sat Feb 7 23:53:54 2015 UTC,"It probably slowed them down a bit but the real issue was the extra weight on the suspension. The VVSS suspension was nearing the limits of its capabilities given the limited space it had for springs. All the sandbags and concrete and other stuff the troops used to improve the armor basically just helped to overload the suspension and reduce its life. All those sand bags and things also had very little impact in actually improving the armor, though it did help to make the men more comfortable and so most commanders overlooked its use."

One reason it looks shorter may be because the gun has been knocked from its cradle from an internal explosion or some other traumatic event.   The panther's 75mm has a different muzzle break. The first baffle is smaller and more angular than on the second (looking from the breach down the barrel).   Just google search the two tanks and you'll see what I mean  edit* Also, the length of the two guns is actually pretty similar (only 1m difference) so I doubt you could use the length as a way of identifying the difference between the two."

From: http://preservedtanks.com/Profile.aspx?UniqueId=47   This Ausf G has a plaque on its glacis plate that reads: “Built in 823 Armd Troops Wksp REME No.6 BAOR 1945”. It was number six of the Panthers and Jagdpanthers built by the British. It is fitted with swirl-cowl exhausts, and is missing its engine cover plates. It has the same cupola and other late features as the Bovington example, including having fittings for tools both on the hull side, and on the hull rear and engine deck (source: L. Archer). It was transferred from the RMCS at Shrivenham in England. This was in 1985, in exchange for a Marder MICV. While on display there it had two large non-standard headlights fitted. It also had three long bolts and a metal cylinder welded to its glacis, of unknown purpose, which have since been removed. It spent some considerable time in storage at the Trier depot in the late 1980’s. The turret and main armament were restored by the Navy arsenal in Wilhelmshaven/Kiel, and the hull with all sub-assemblies, including its British gearbox, by the Wehrtechnische Dienststelle für Kraftfahrzeuge und Panzer (WTD 41) in Trier. It is now part of the Koblenz BWB collection and will be displayed once further restoration is complete. It is in running order. It has an imitation Zimmerit coating (although this was dropped from September 1944) and carries the turret number “801” and the name “Ulrike”. (Photo: R. Besecke)."

That's if you even work it out at all before you're hit again.   Why would they need to know where they've been hit? they can just gtfo either way   When they take a massive hit like that, it would be panic and confusion. They won't be like ""Oh we just got hit by one of the most lethal guns of the war and the engine is destroyed and filling eveything with smoke, better get out guys. Trust me, it's happened to me before"".   No they'd be scared as fuck and won't need anyone to tell them to gtfo asap."

They'd hear and feel it, they just wouldn't know what just happened since they'd all be deafened by the sound, disoriented by being thrown around and blinded by the smoke a few moments after impact, especially since the engine is what got destroyed.   Its funny how you attack people's lack of experience in armored combat, then draw your own conclusions on what the crew would be experiencing after being hit."

TankPorn,2unesk,BeondTheGrave,1 point,Tue Feb 3 20:34:57 2015 UTC,Hey! Im researching this baby. Any questions?
TankPorn,2unesk,rangamatchstick,3,Tue Feb 3 21:42:28 2015 UTC,"I'm still really confused by the system wherein the entire crew was in the turret, or something? And something about the driver being built into a swivel mount?"
TankPorn,2unesk,FreeUsernameInBox,3,Wed Feb 4 00:48:34 2015 UTC,"The MBT did actually put all of its crewmembers into the turret. The Commander, Gunner, and Loader all sat above the driver, on level with the gun, and rotated with the turret. The driver, OTOH sat lower near the front of the turret. His station was specially designed to counter rotate to allow him to point ""forward"" no matter where the rest of the turret pointed. This solution was actually pretty effective as it made the tank's hull more compact and reduced the ultimate silhouette of the tank. Unfortunately, it was a more expensive solution, which was bad for a tank project that was way over budget, and a tank which cost 2x per unit what it was supposed to.   The Germans actually sought to redesign the tank late in the project with a driver in a traditional hull mount. But that idea wasnt accepted by the Americans for other reasons. I think that the later Keller tank was built around this design though."
TankPorn,2unesk,rangamatchstick,-4,Wed Feb 4 04:38:22 2015 UTC,"I still cant believe one of the issues involved in the design of this tank was that the american and german designers argued over what measurement system! Surley you would listen to the guys who kicked your ase in design of tanks and vehicles for a decade, damn americans hahaha."
TankPorn,2unesk,FreeUsernameInBox,2,Wed Feb 4 15:22:00 2015 UTC,It wasn't one side saying their measurement was better. Wether the tank was produced in metric versus standard would have no bearing on its effectiveness. What the argument was for was because each side already had factories tooled in their measurements and to have to change over whole factories production lines in order to manufacture this tank would be costly and time consuming. It wasn't an arbitrary dick measuring contest between the U.S. And Europe
TankPorn,2unesk,rangamatchstick,2,Wed Feb 4 14:13:02 2015 UTC,"Surley you would listen to the guys who kicked your ase in design of tanks and vehicles for a decade   When exactly was this? More than a few years before WW2, both the US and Germany had no tanks or lightly armoured tanks armed with machine guns. It's only really from 1939-1941 that the US was behind, and that's mostly because the US hadn't got into the war yet. The M3 Medium was able to dominate the Afrika Corps despite its' many shortcomings, and the M4 Medium was far and away the best tank of WW2. The US lead just kept opening up after that. Germany only got back in the same league as the US with the Leopard 2, and that hardly constitutes an ass-kicking."
TankPorn,2unesk,FreeUsernameInBox,-2,Wed Feb 4 22:11:20 2015 UTC,"""m4 medium was the far and away the best tank of ww2"" HA! Next joke please. The only good thing about the m4 was the same as the t-34, its was easy to mass produce. Thats basically the only reason they did well other than reliability."
TankPorn,2unesk,rangamatchstick,2,Thu Feb 5 10:29:07 2015 UTC,"It was mass produced in vast numbers, it was reliable, it was far and away the most ergonomic, it had a good gun which was succeeded by an excellent gun, and it was well armoured. The T-34 was actually a pretty poor tank next to the M4. When introduced in 1942, it totally outclassed the Pz III and Pz IV in North Africa. Right up until VE day, M4 crews had the best chance of survival if they were hit, and favourable kill ratios agains all German tanks - even Panthers.  Most of the failings of US armour were doctrinal, not equipment issues. The infamous tank destroyer doctrine, for one - and even that makes sense in context."
TankPorn,2unesk,FreeUsernameInBox,-1,Thu Feb 5 13:55:36 2015 UTC,"PZ3s and 4s, obviously, but I would of expected them to be pretty even considering armour thicknesses, guns and general mobility. As for panthers....yeh..right. Also good gun? the stuby 75 for good for infantry support but mite aswell of been a pee shooter against most armour."
TankPorn,2unesk,rangamatchstick,3,Thu Feb 5 14:32:00 2015 UTC,"Nope, the later PzKpfw IV models were about on a par with the Sherman, but with poorer armour, dismal ergonomics and reliability. I'm afraid the statistics don't lie on the Panther issue, anecdotes don't win wars.  The 75mm was comparable to the Russian 76mm used on the T-34, but with a better HE shell. Since the average tank did spend most of its' time supporting infantry, that's not to be sneezed at. The 76mm was equivalent to the Soviet 85mm. Again, a very good gun for the job. When asked what the ideal tank platoon looked like postwar, tank officers favoured having three tanks with a 105mm howitzer and one with a 76mm gun. Hardly the response you'd expect from people desperate for better AP performance."
TankPorn,2unesk,FreeUsernameInBox,-1,Thu Feb 5 15:55:48 2015 UTC,"""history is written by the victors"", compare the panther and an m4 sherman from an engineering perspective. Understandable they would prefer the three 105mm howitzers as german armour the 105mm howitzer couldnt handle (tiger 1 or 2 (lol good luck with the 2), panther or jagdpanthers were rare)."

But enough about that, I wanna talk about the armored division gameplay. After all, we're all here for the armor anyways.   I've only advanced through the light armor on the American side, but the Germans have their very own trees of light, medium, and heavy tanks. The gameplay is solid, and driving a tank actually feels like a tank. You need to keep your tank buttoned up with enemy infantry about, to keep from being sniped. When they aren't around though, it's a good way to get a better view than looking through the porthole or sight on your tank.

Hopefully when the game leaves the beta stages there will be more aviation content, maybe even bringing the level requirement back and giving early pilots interwar planes."

TankPorn,2uf2fj,infinus5,3,Sun Feb 1 21:28:43 2015 UTC,"Possibly, A lot of them are in very bad shape It's something like having to use 5 of these to make 1 usable tank even with new parts depending on the tanks.  T-72s Ukraine doesn't have any of the required places to build new parts so they either have to improvise or skip,  Similar problems with the T-80, lack of parts.  The T-64B/T-64BVs have been pretty garbage so far, and they take longer to upgrade to the T-64BM  They are just building brand new T-84s in mass rather then mess around with these tanks in storage."
TankPorn,2uf2fj,Jeffgoldbum,4,Sun Feb 1 23:44:20 2015 UTC,still they manufactured thousands of them.  making a few good tanks from the dead ones is still worth it.
TankPorn,2uf2fj,infinus5,2,Sun Feb 1 23:45:30 2015 UTC,They are building t-84's?? I thought they had like 10
TankPorn,2uf2fj,Alex1296,2,Mon Feb 2 00:13:39 2015 UTC,"They said they will be, all of the other tanks they have are apparently old Soviet export versions like the T-72 that they have no replacement parts or old T-64s which have proven to be pretty bad, and there T-80s aren't much better then the T-72's situation.  The T-84 was a ""homegrown"" tank for Ukraine so they have the capability of making them easier then anything other tank at the moment"

TankPorn,2uf2fj,global336,1 point,Mon Feb 2 20:23:33 2015 UTC,"T-64, T-72, and T-80. What's the difference between them?"
TankPorn,2uf2fj,burgerbob22,1 point,Mon Feb 2 20:36:24 2015 UTC,"I posted links for two- the T-72 is another development of the T-64, but was meant to be cheaper and easier to build."
TankPorn,2uf2fj,sleepingpie,1 point,Mon Feb 2 20:49:26 2015 UTC,T 80 is the t72 refit right?
TankPorn,2uf2fj,SmokeyUnicycle,4,Sun Feb 1 19:28:48 2015 UTC,"Negative, that's the T-90.   T-80 is related to the T-64 but is it's own separate line."
TankPorn,2uf2fj,stratmatex,1 point,Mon Feb 2 05:58:47 2015 UTC,They're both based off the T-64 but we're built in different factories. Apparently the 72 is a much easier tank to maintain and doesn't have the tendancy to blow up when hit as the 80.
TankPorn,2uf2fj,stratmatex,8,Sun Feb 1 19:54:43 2015 UTC,"It's the other way around.   Early T-72's had a problem where the ammo would cook off EXTREMELY easily. This was fixed with KONTACT-5 ERA. But once the ERA is expended, the crew would have a much higher chance of being burned alive.    The T-80 was designed to be a more safer tank, and an all around better tank. But the Russian Military wasn't very fond of the Turbine engine, so in comes the T-90A."
TankPorn,2uf2fj,Jeevadees,1 point,Sun Feb 1 20:00:49 2015 UTC,Really? I thought lots of T-80s got fried in Chechnya.
TankPorn,2uf2fj,stratmatex,6,Sun Feb 1 20:05:26 2015 UTC,"Well, both got fried, just the crew in the T-80's could get out fast enough before the whole thing went up. The biggest problem with the tanks in Chechnya was that the conscripts didn't fill the Reactive Armour with anything. It was just an empty steel shell, so pretty pointless. RPG's had no problem going through that stuff. Not filling the T-72 ERA in Iraq was also a problem. (Not to mention the Iraqis trying to make their own ammo because they didn't trust the Soviet rounds that where shipped with the tanks.)  In the first Chechen war, the Russians would literally drive tanks into Grozny without any infantry support whatsoever. They would be taking Anti-tank to the top and rear all the time, and any tank would be disabled from that."
TankPorn,2uf2fj,Jeevadees,2,Sun Feb 1 20:15:21 2015 UTC,"Did you read this stuff in a book? Cause if so, I'd be interested in reading it too. If not, any link for more reading would be nice too please."
TankPorn,2uf2fj,SgtJamie,2,Mon Feb 2 06:22:18 2015 UTC,"I have sorta just accumulated all of the stuff I know from years of studying the Russian army, as well as other armed forces. I find it very interesting. Almost everyone in my family was once in the Russian or Soviet army, some very high ranking, and I have had the privilege of being able to talk to them. The best thing to do is to just study the systems from a lot of different perspectives, as their is usually a lot of bias.  Stuff like Russians calling their tanks unstoppable death machines, and Americans calling Russian tanks shitty pieces of scrap metal. I know that their is a lot of patriotism for Russia in my family, so I usually don't ask them about how ""good"" a piece of equipment is, but they are very knowledgable none the less."

TankPorn,2uf2fj,dubdubdubdot,1 point,Mon Feb 2 05:59:34 2015 UTC,"doesn't have the tendancy to blow up when hit as the 80.   All Soviet tanks have this tendency. It's to do with the ammo storage.   The T-72 was the cheap tank, whereas the T-64/T-80 was the expensive, high-end, technologically more advanced tank. The T-72 is therefore cheaper to build and maintain, but due to its design choices, it's also the lesser tank in terms of safety and survivability."

TankPorn,2uby8i,InfiniteApathy,9,Sun Feb 1 01:08:57 2015 UTC,"historically most, if not all, gun based AA weapons have been used against terrestrial targets in war. possibly the most famous, and effective, was the PAK 43:   The Pak 43 (Panzerabwehrkanone 43) was a German 88 mm anti-tank gun developed by Krupp in competition with the Rheinmetall 8.8 cm Flak 41 anti-aircraft gun and used during the Second World War. The Pak 43 was the most powerful anti-tank gun of the Wehrmacht to see service in significant numbers, also serving in modified form as the main gun on the Tiger II tank, and Elefant, Jagdpanther and Nashorn tank destroyers.  The improved 8.8 cm round had a relatively flat trajectory out to 910 m (1,000 yd) and was able to frontally penetrate any Allied tank at long ranges. Even the Soviet IS-2 model 1943 tanks and IS chassis-based tank destroyers were vulnerable to the Pak 43.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8.8_cm_Pak_43"

Why would you sacrifice a crew member and about 3 rounds per minute for a other piece of equipment that can break, let alone can't change ammo type once loaded?   In my experience, nothing beats human intuition and training."
TankPorn,2u2if6,I_Literally_EatBears,3,Thu Jan 29 19:50:33 2015 UTC,"I think the way military technology is heading, automation replacing soldiers is going to be the standard.  While the Leclerc's autoloader is probably flawed, its the inevitable future of armored warfare.  This is just a start, I would imagine future autoloaders will be able to switch munitions on the fly.  I recently saw pictures of tanks with turrets that were entirely remotely controlled.  They had a lower profile/size."

TankPorn,2u2if6,mackalack101,5,Thu Jan 29 19:59:01 2015 UTC,"That's the thing though. The human body can be trained to overcome a lot of things, fatigue included. And on a combat ready tank crew, human error is very slim.   Just stating my personal opinion though, when the shit hits the fan, I'd rather have a human loader on my crew than a machine one."
TankPorn,2u2if6,TacoMaster235,1 point,Thu Jan 29 20:18:54 2015 UTC,"The advantages of an autoloader don't become clear until you ""zoom out"" and see that the people replaced by those machines can be drivers, gunners, and commanders in other tanks. So for every three tanks with an autoloader, you get enough crew saved for another tank. This can save the military a lot of money in training, housing, pension etc in the long run, and it allows more tanks to be fielded as well.  And sure, an autoloader might break, or it might not be as fast as a human loader, and it might be better to have 4 people to perform maintenance, but in a ""hot war"" scenario the average MBT's life span wouldn't be long enough for that to matter.  At the end of the day, its really all about the strategic economics, not tactical superiority."

TankPorn,2tzgmt,SMIDSY,15,Wed Jan 28 19:31:47 2015 UTC,"Not sure about the price in background, but if it has the same fuel capacity as the M1A1 (i think this is an early M1 105mm, but I could be mistaken), about $650 (($1.35 x 500gal)-margin of error). I assumed the fuel capacity and was leaning toward the fact that if they were that hard up for fuel to pull into a gas station, they were really REALLY low."

TankPorn,2tzgmt,QQ_L2P,7,Wed Jan 28 22:32:17 2015 UTC,"By running them over, yes you can beat just about anyone. $650 is actually pretty low compared to JP-8. I think the price for JP-8 is around $3.62 per gallon Based on the government's estimate for FY14. Today's tanks cost around $1640 to completely fill now (M1A2 models have 50 gallons less capacity due to additional batteries). It takes 8-10 gallons just to start the damn thing. So that's $36 just to turn it on."
TankPorn,2tzgmt,elshiftyx,8,Wed Jan 28 22:44:31 2015 UTC,"Holy crap, that's impressive!  I suppose it's a good thing they weren't driving cross country in the UK. Diesel is 113.81 pence/litre. That's (using Imperial gallons) 113.81*4.55 = 517.84 pence/gallon, which translates to 7.85 $/gallon.  Or using US gallons = 431.34 pence/gallon = $6.53/gallon.  For the modern tank that's either (assuming 453 gallon tank if I did the maths right); $3,556 or $2,958 respectively. Might be a touch more if you want the premium stuff though. 13 pence/litre more, lol."
TankPorn,2tzgmt,QQ_L2P,1 point,Wed Jan 28 23:00:31 2015 UTC,"Not additional batteries. It has the same number as the A1, but only uses 4 to start instead of all 6. The loss of fuel was because of the under armor APU. It took some space originally used for fuel. Also, not on the A2 but the A2 SEP. The A2 has the same tanks."
TankPorn,2tzgmt,itstanktime,18,Thu Jan 29 03:13:19 2015 UTC,"OP here.  Yes, this is OC.  I have tons of pics like this from back in the film days, so I will have to break out the scanner for you all.  This is late 80's early 90's.  Long before digital cameras.  Long story short, we had just transitioned from M60-A3's to the M1's and were scheduled to go into the training area for some driving practice.  For some reason I don't quite recall, the fuel truck was somewhere else, so we asked top (1st Sgt) if we could take the track down to the Amoco and throw some fuel in it with the company card.  We were kidding, but he thought about it for a moment and said sure.  We looked at each other, secured 2 Hummers for escorts and took off.    As for how much, these were the M1 slicks, and if I remember held 400 some gallons in all 3 tanks.  300 in the main and 50 in the saddle tanks in the hull.  The crossfeed pumps in the saddle tanks were constantly broken and to service them you had to pump all of the fuel out of the tank so they were NEVER used.  I believe that was fixed in the A2's and beyond.  I think we put a few hundred gallons in it that day, just enough to scoot around a bit until the fuel trucks could come in the next few days."

TankPorn,2tueao,mojohand2,3,Tue Jan 27 23:08:48 2015 UTC,I've read a convincing argument that German army got more bang for the reichsmark from this assault gun than any other AFV they manufactured during the war.
TankPorn,2tueao,Todda468,3,Mon Feb 2 02:43:07 2015 UTC,"Mainly because it was, without original intent, the kind of vehicle they needed for much of the war, calling it an ""assault gun"" is quite misleading as it has a tank gun instead. It's more accuretly a case-mate tank. The only difference between it and tanks is the lack of a turret.  Now a turret can be a good or a bad thing, it makes the tank taller, more expensive, slightly more fragile, but it also helps to observe your surroundings on the move, engage targets on the move. Most of the time a turret is worth it but when the war is going badly and you're on the defensive most of the time it's not. Like standard tank destroyers it can easily be camoflauged and ambush approaching tanks, with smart positioning it's quite possible for a commander to ensure the enemy always faces his front."

TankPorn,2ttdkx,ddosn,2,Thu Jan 29 00:16:58 2015 UTC,"Eh, not really. Prior to commissioning the Leclerc, France had considered importing their replacement for the AMX 30. They looked at the Leopard 2, Merkava, and (ironically enough) the Abrams, but decided, for various reasons, that just building an MBT from scratch according to their own specs would be easier.   There are a number of differences in between the Leclerc's capabilities and those of the M1. The first is that the Leclerc's GIAT-made 120mm is 52 calibers long rather than the 44 calibers of the M1's Rheinmetall, granting the Leclerc superior muzzle velocity.   However, on the flip-side of things, the French have stubbornly refused to utilize Chobbham armour in the Leclerc's design, stating that Chobbham was ""too specialized towards defeating HEAT rounds"". Instead, the latest Leclerc variants use a modular armour design, including titanium inserts, individual composite armour units and ERA blocks. While allowing for a certain degree of customization according to necessity, overall effective armour thickness is generally less than that of the Abrams.   The net result is a tank that theoretically has more firepower than the Abrams and is considerably lighter, but at the (relative) expense of armour protection. The Leclerc has yet to actually see deployment in large-scale combat, but French reports from UN peacekeeping missions have so far come back satisfactory."

TankPorn,2tsa04,cpm1888,3,Tue Jan 27 00:46:20 2015 UTC,It looks like it has a couple of decent holes in the front of the hull. I thought their frontal armor was roughly equivalent to a tiger. What could have done that? A Jackson?
TankPorn,2tsa04,Cuddles1612,3,Tue Jan 27 02:04:23 2015 UTC,From what I could find they operated M10s and M36s so I would say the M36 is the best candidate
TankPorn,2tsa04,Pugachev_Cobra,4,Tue Jan 27 02:27:18 2015 UTC,"One of the most important lessons the Germans learned from the eastern front was the importance of sloped armor. This is apparent in the design of the Panther, as the frontal armor was sloped to increase the effective thickness. However, it appears that this Panther is slightly bogged down in the mud and the front of the armor is at a bit of a flatter angle than it would have been if the tank was level. The armor would have been, as a result, easier to penetrate."
TankPorn,2tsa04,PopeTheoskeptik,1 point,Tue Jan 27 03:57:33 2015 UTC,"Maybe combine that with the possibility that the M36 (or whatever) could have been a bit higher up a hill or suchlike, the glacis effect would be even further reduced."

TankPorn,2tsa04,HiPSTRF0X,1 point,Tue Jan 27 02:50:22 2015 UTC,"The Panther's armour was actually slightly more than that of a Tiger, and it was more practical as a tank due to lack of mechanical failures. Probably a 90mm round through that upper glacis."
TankPorn,2tsa04,Wartz,4,Tue Jan 27 11:55:16 2015 UTC,"it was more practical as a tank due to lack of mechanical failures.   Uh, what?  The first production model of the Panther had abysmal reliability. Engine fires, turret motor, tracks, transmission, engine life, you name it, it broke. It was a bitch and a half to tear down for maintenance too.  The Ausf D had maybe a 35% operational rate at best. The Ausf A (the most common model) was somewhat better (50%) but still suffered from constant final drive breakdowns."
TankPorn,2tsa04,HiPSTRF0X,1 point,Wed Jan 28 14:48:51 2015 UTC,I was comparing it to the Tiger. It most likely did way better than the Tiger...
TankPorn,2tsa04,Wartz,4,Wed Jan 28 14:53:34 2015 UTC,"The Tiger had an solid operational rate once it got past it's first few months in service during 1942-43, provided it was properly maintained. It needed constant lubing unlike other tanks. The biggest problem with Tigers is they were so heavy that they were often impossible to recover if they did break down in the field. Even just getting stuck in the mud usually required another Tiger to pull it out, putting severe strain on the towing Tiger's engine. It had other issues too, like a very slow turret rotation speed, not to mention the expense in materials, reichmarks, manufacturing labor, transport, and huge maintenance crews, but on the whole the tank worked fine.  Tigers gained a bit of a bad rep for serviceability because by the end of the war, the Germans no longer could have big field maintenance crews sitting out in the open behind their lines. An army constantly on the retreat doesn't have the time or ability to send tanks back to be maintained. New parts stopped coming too because rail lines and logistics depots were constantly raided. Airpower shut it all down."
TankPorn,2tsa04,HiPSTRF0X,1 point,Wed Jan 28 15:02:11 2015 UTC,"Henceforth overall reliability of the Panther rage did way better than the Tiger due to higher efficiency per unit. Tigers were pretty much amazing for it's shock factor the first time it was seen, but eventually things like the Firefly and Jacksons/Hellcats made it rather redundant."

TankPorn,2tor9d,pixeltehcat,1 point,Mon Jan 26 09:52:45 2015 UTC,"Nah in terms of kill ratio the Elephant was the most effective.  It reached an average ratio of 10:1.

TankPorn,2tor9d,Baldemyr,2,Mon Jan 26 15:04:54 2015 UTC,"I've not read of serious issues with the Jagdpanther.

TankPorn,2tor9d,pixeltehcat,2,Wed Jan 28 22:41:22 2015 UTC,Why would an unsuccessful tank be the best?
TankPorn,2tor9d,Wartz,3,Wed Jan 28 22:51:18 2015 UTC,"By successful I mean most kills. The Stug was in service from, what, 1940?  Produced in the thousands and spread over all fronts. Of course it's going to rack up thousands of kills. The Jagdpanther was a purpose built tank killer with a magnificent gun, great optics, good armor and good mobility. It was a near perfect balance of all the elements that a tank destroyer needed. It could deal with any Allied armour, at long range, take some punishment and move fast if it had to...all better than the little Stug, which was, it should be noted, not intended as a tank destroyer originally. But it came too late and in too small numbers to reach its potential. Compare the Fw190D9 with the Me109E. Or a VW Beetle with a Porsche911, if you will. One is better than the other, but the ""lesser"" one is demonstrably more successful."
TankPorn,2tor9d,pixeltehcat,0,Wed Jan 28 23:32:44 2015 UTC,"And what if you factor cost and manufacturing time into that kill ratio?  Also, the Elefant has a rather small data set to go off of."
TankPorn,2tor9d,P-01S,2,Mon Jan 26 15:25:09 2015 UTC,"Considering the Elefant were made from left over Tiger (P)'s?  Hard to argue with that efficiency right?  However I will concede that the argument was ""effective"".  That could mean more then just ""ability to kill"" and that the nature of the Elefant means we will only ever have a very small data set."
TankPorn,2tor9d,Baldemyr,1 point,Mon Jan 26 16:02:47 2015 UTC,"But if you factor in R&D time, time and cost to retool for Elefant production... How many smaller, cheaper armored vehicles could they have made?"
TankPorn,2tor9d,P-01S,3,Mon Jan 26 16:09:38 2015 UTC,But then we go back to the 10-1 kill ratio.   You need crews (for all those lesser vehicles)and you need kills.  Plus the Elefant was an ad-hock development itself so I doubt it had an overly long research period.   I am by no means a big Elefant fan-but those T34s were quite a shock to the Germans and these things did their job well in dealing with them(not so well in dealing with infantry though).  So basically what I am saying is :  The Elefant was a wonderful killer of tanks.  Since they had the hulls anyways it was a good use for the parts and didn't require as much work to get out in the field as some of the newer designs.  It was prone to breakdowns but not as much as the Jagdpanther and overall performed well.
TankPorn,2tor9d,Baldemyr,-1,Mon Jan 26 16:29:01 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say only a few. A couple dozen at least.  They only had such a bad kill ratio because they came so late and by that time, many Allied medium tanks could take them out rather easily since their guns were better than German armour. With such low speed and massive weight, you'd expect it to be impervious to most attacks, but it wasn't. The fucked up supply lines didn't help either, since crews would be forced to destroy or abandon them after minor breakdowns.  The Ferdinand did much better because it was more versatile with it's smaller gun that was still lethal to all tanks, and it was lighter therefore easier to transport. If Germany somehow fielded a vehicle like the Jagdtiger earlier in the war when Allied tanks weren't all tank killers and their supply lines weren't so stretched, they would have performed amazingly well."
TankPorn,2tor9d,airborneleaf,3,Mon Jan 26 11:37:58 2015 UTC,"Nope, pretty sure that any western allied tank including the firefly would not be able to penetrate the frontal armor of a jagdtiger. The real problem wasn't the design, these things could kill anything easily. Problem was they either ran out of fuel, broke down, or were lost to allied air superiority."
TankPorn,2tor9d,TehBrownSheep,3,Mon Jan 26 12:29:18 2015 UTC,"They didn't have to. The QF 17-pounder using APDS in the later stages of the war could get through more than 200mm. Since they would never think of attacking from the front, the side armour that was only 100mm wouldn't put up a fight at all. Packs of late medium tanks were lethal to any other tank.  I'd say the design itself was a pretty big flaw. They extended the hull to fit a large enough casemate to fit the Pak 44. They already had the Pak 43, which had no trouble taking out any Allied tanks, so the Pak 44 as an armament on a vehicle was too overkill with no great benefit. It just made it needlessly heavy and complex."
TankPorn,2tor9d,airborneleaf,1 point,Mon Jan 26 12:58:15 2015 UTC,I completely agree with you.
TankPorn,2tor9d,TehBrownSheep,1 point,Mon Jan 26 13:58:45 2015 UTC,The Pak 44 was there to deal with the next gen of allied heavy tanks.  Kinda an odd time to be planning ahead.
TankPorn,2tor9d,Baldemyr,2,Mon Jan 26 15:06:02 2015 UTC,"It was pretty clear even to the Germans that the Allies weren't going to be fielding as many heavy tanks as they probably should have. Simply too many American projects were failing terribly. Why they ordered 150 is beyond me.  In hindsight, it's probably a good thing that the Allies had limited heavy tanks. It meant the Germans were producing expensive, time-consuming vehicles such as the Jagdtiger when they weren't at all needed."
TankPorn,2tor9d,airborneleaf,3,Mon Jan 26 15:19:29 2015 UTC,"Only one Super Pershing even saw combat... Basically the same issue as German super-heavies had: It would have kicked much ass if it were produced in large numbers, but it wasn't produced in large numbers  Germany also just produced too damn many different models. The PzKpfw I was obsolete immediately, the II and III were made obsolete by middle of the war, but the use of PzKpfw III chassis for the StuG III was good. The PzKpfw V was probably a wasted effort. The PzKpfw VI could have been much more of a factor, I think, if it were produced in favor of other heavy and super heavy tanks. The Elefant and Maus were pointless. I forget how many SPGs and TDs they produced... But there were a lot. The aforementioned StuG III was good, though, and the Hetzer was also built on an existing chassis (38t)...  But it seems like where the US produced incremental upgrades to the M4, Germany kept designing new tanks."
TankPorn,2tor9d,P-01S,1 point,Mon Jan 26 15:40:43 2015 UTC,yeah. Agreed.  I love the King Tiger-both because it was awesome and because it helped us beat the Nazis.  All these ridiculously expensive machines and yet we won with M4s and T34s
TankPorn,2tor9d,Baldemyr,1 point,Mon Jan 26 16:00:38 2015 UTC,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but aren't APDS rounds especially angle agnostic? That is even more damning against the Jagdtiger.  I think the Americans had the right idea by fielding a mix of M4s and quick, heavily armed TDs. For the Western Front, anyway. Sure, they aren't as impressive on paper as heavy and super-heavy tanks, and they don't have nearly the psychological impact, but they worked! They worked for the Germans, too. They just didn't have the numbers."
TankPorn,2tor9d,P-01S,0,Mon Jan 26 15:37:54 2015 UTC,"You mean the angle of the armour has no effect? I think so, unless the armour is very sloped. The only way a Jagdtiger's armour would bounce an APDS penetrator is if it hit at nearly a 180 degree angle, which is pretty damn unlikely."
TankPorn,2tor9d,airborneleaf,0,Mon Jan 26 15:51:24 2015 UTC,Because there were so few of them. It's like when you get a new tank and win 5 games in a row and get 3 k damage each
TankPorn,2tor9d,Gerbils74,0,Mon Jan 26 09:38:10 2015 UTC,What?! Surely the StuG III would be the most effective tank destroyer?  The Elefant almost didn't even see combat.  It does not matter how good a tank looks on paper if not enough of them are produced to have an effect.
TankPorn,2tor9d,P-01S,1 point,Mon Jan 26 15:23:57 2015 UTC,"Well beats me, I don't know where I read it but I read that the Elefant did a great job at killing tanks."
TankPorn,2tor9d,JayKayGray,2,Mon Jan 26 15:37:47 2015 UTC,"In war, logistics are more important than individual performance. The US produced more M4 ""Sherman""s than Germany's total tank production. And the US also fielded a lot of TDs.  The StuG III was based on the PzKpfw III chassis, so as the PzKpfw III became obsolete, the existing tanks could be turned into StuGs.  The Elefant, by contrast, was rather unique. It needed its own parts and supply chain for manufacture and maintenance."

TankPorn,2tmv9f,JCPenis,3,Mon Jan 26 05:17:54 2015 UTC,"Actually, some of them did!   Germany began research on IR gear in the 30's of which there were two designations: Infrarotstrahlung or IR and Ultrarotstrahlung or UR, the obsolete name for IR. AG and Zeiss (or is it AEG and Leitz, it depends on who translated the text?) were the most senior developers of this equipment and in early 1942 the ZG 1221 solution was tested on a Pak 40 AT gun. With the ever-increasing air superiority of the Allies making daytime travel nearly impossible for panzer units, a great emphasis was placed on the speeding up of the development of the infra-red devices to be used by the Panzertruppe. General Guderian suggested an IR gun sight created for the 75mm Pak ought to be further developed for the Panther as well. A variation of the ZG1221 known as the ZG1221k was fitted to the commander's cupola of Panther turrets by way of a mount installed in the commander's hatchway. The headlamp gave the commander the ability to see ahead of the vehicle approximately 100 meters. By most accounts the range was inadequate and led to the development of an IR observation vehicle known as the ""Uhu"". Based on a Sd.Kfz.251/20 a 60cm searchlight was mounted in the fighting compartment. During operations one observation vehicle was assigned to a Panther unit comprising five tanks. The visibility range of the infra-red viewer mounted on the Panther was increased to 700 meters through the capability of the Uhu searchlight."

TankPorn,2t9kex,dubdubdubdot,1 point,Wed Jan 28 23:17:07 2015 UTC,Fair but the BMD 1 was never mentioned and the BMD-4 was made in 2005.  More appropriately you're essentially comparing the BTR-70 and m113a1 and saying the BTR is superiors or the time  because the BTR-90 has a 30mm cannon and Konkurs anti-tank missiles.  The Sheradin is also a light tank and has a larger caliber weapon as well it should be noted that the BMDs are not noteworthy for their transport ability.
TankPorn,2t9kex,wikingwarrior,1 point,Wed Jan 28 23:28:02 2015 UTC,"Right, its a BMD1 in the gif, I made the mistake of calling it a BMD4 before. The BMD1 could carry 6 troops, had 3 ATGMs, 73mm smoothbore cannon and coaxial 7.62mm, 2×7.62 mm PKT bow tank machine guns."

I'm not saying the Sheradin was vastly superior, but I do think it was better armed overall, less weapons but more effective.  Also it might be the BMD-2 I'm thinking of, but I was under the impression that with full equipment on, it was worse at transporting troops than claimed."

TankPorn,2t5efx,Hetzer,3,Wed Jan 21 13:51:26 2015 UTC,"I've been playing since tanks came out which was about 10 months ago or round about that. However I do have all the tanks from Tier 1-4 in Germany and all Tier 1-3 for Russia in that 10 months as well as tier 1-2 for US.  This is without a premium account at all.   Progression in WT is different than WoT. WT requires that you have at least 6 tanks of a tier to go to the next tier as well as having the previous tanks leading up to the tank you want.  Playing Realistic/Simulator I'd say it would take you maybe 3-4 months? But leaning towards 3. Then half that time if you are running a premium account. This is me guesstimating.  Actually now that I think about it, since it would be around the same time. It took me 26 days to unlock Tier 1 & 2 for US and with 2/6 for Tier 3.

The Germans never tested it against allied HEAT before they adopted it. They also never placed it on top of armour thick enough to brave ATR fire (e.g. the sides of the Tiger tanks). When the Germans eventually got around to testing them with their Panzerfausts and Panzerschrecks, the schürzen was found to be useless. The Soviets also tried with the same results.  http://ftr-wot.blogspot.com/2013/05/the-schurzen-against-heat.html  http://balagan.info/why-were-schurzen-introduced-in-ww2  http://www.panzerworld.com/german-armor-myths#schurzen  Modern chain/slat armor works by deforming the copper cone or damaging the fusing mechanism of the HEAT round while the skirts on most modern tanks are made with composite armour or ERA, at least on the sections over the crew compartment.

TankPorn,2t4bu0,doodeman,12,Wed Jan 21 05:12:46 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily as the Panther's infamous final drive had simple straight cut teeth vs the helical or planetary gearing used in allied tanks. It wasn't complicated; it was simply inadequate for a vehicle of its weight. They lasted on average 150 km in post war French service so it begs the question how did the Soviets get enough replacements/substitutes to keep em running for a reasonable amount of distance.  The Tiger Ausf E on the other hand was ""generally mechanical reliable"" as long as maintenance was conducted properly and there was an adequate supply of spare parts. As for anecdotes, Otto Carius in ""Tigers in the Mud"" never complained about any sort of ""unreliability"" exhibited by his Tiger. Still IIRC supporting a heavy company of Tigers was 3 times the logistical burden of a medium company.  Then again the declining quality of crews was also a factor. For example the T-34 is always known for being quite reliable as Koshkin's 2880 km round trip trial from Kharkov to Moscow can attest to but during the start of Operation Barbarossa, the vast majority of them were lost due to mechanical failures since even trivial issues couldn't be adequately solved by the hastily trained tank crews.  Still form your own opinion on the Panther, here's tank-net/WoT forum's Walter_Sobchak's collection of snippets about the Panther's reliability from a variety of books."

My guess is that they captured these tanks in running order, and used them until they broke down, which probably wasn't very long. Either that, or these are simply staged propaganda photos.   Remember also that the Panther had a petrol engine, while all the Soviet tanks had diesel engines, which would complicate the logistics of keeping them running even more."

It's highly unlikely that the Soviets would bother even trying to fix them, since getting spare parts would be a matter of scavenging wrecks and captured tanks.

Plus, there is no place to store BII short of strapping it to the outside of the vehicle.   Can someone explain to me what is their intended role?

It shows children from the FDJ which was a youth movement in the DDR (East Germany) that are taking part in a parade, driving around in a tiny T-54 and a T-34 (in the background). This photo is from a propagando film from 1977 called ""Es lebe die Sonne"" which was part of the secret Stasi archives and got released in 2009.  I would have loved to drive around in one of these as a kid. I wonder were they are now...  Here are a bunch of photos and the Propaganda film:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9P3dI7mSAaw#t=228  Pictures  The guns are real (Both tank guns and handguns/rifles). The tanks seem to be powered by small combustion engines and they made small versions of the following tanks:  T-54/55  T-34 (57 and 85)  SU-100  ISU-152 (I think?)

TankPorn,2su89v,ethan_kahn,9,Sun Jan 18 16:23:28 2015 UTC,"I love 40K but the artists have a very poor idea of where technology has been and where it's going.  Rivets as a construction method for example are a terrible idea for armor, they shear under strain and become secondary projectiles, they were phased out as soon as welding became a practical alternative more than half a century ago.  The same could be said of the sponson and hull guns, that's a throwback to the 1930s at best.  It's a cool aesthetic but has no real technical basis.  The Tau Hammerhead for example is certainly a better approximation of what a heavy tank-like vehicle would look like 40,000 years in the future."
TankPorn,2su89v,3rdweal,19,Sun Jan 18 18:09:55 2015 UTC,"Well, to be fair, humanity in the 40k universe underwent what's basically a technological dark age, losing all sorts of technology.Innovation is even frowned upon - Sure, humanity does have tanks that aren't covered in rivets, but those are super rare and essentially looked at as holy relics - In fact, a Baneblade is basically a chapel with tracks, and a titan is a cathedral with legs. I mean it.  The 40k universe isn't really meant to be practical, and humanity definitely is anything but practical - Their standard tactic is deploy millions of shitty footsoldiers and thousands of tanks, throw that at an enemy until that enemy dies. The death of a billion humans in 40k is genuinely insignificant because of grimdark."
TankPorn,2su89v,KFJ943,24,Sun Jan 18 18:21:01 2015 UTC,"The reasoning behind all of it is actually pretty good. Sure, the goal is just to be as grimdark as possible, but the internal logic of the 40k universe is actually fairly well constructed compared to many other scifi universes (don't get me started on Star Trek for example). Warning, big wall of text incoming.  The first thing to remember is that hell in very real in the 40k universe. It's called the Warp, is filled with horrible deamons and Chaos Gods who snack on souls, corrupt everything they touch and ever try to invade reality, and everything FTL-related literally involves going through hell. So transferring equipment or even data is dangerous and slow, thus both limiting supply lines and the spread of knowledge. There used to be a vast human civilization with pretty much the peak of technological capability: advanced AI, near-immortality, godlike manufacturing systems,... However somewhere in the 20th millennium the AIs tried to wipe humanity out, the Warp went from ""pretty calm"" to ""opening a massive rift into reality thousands of light years wide"", alien aggression skyrocketed and humanity was basically thrown into scattered isolated pockets, most of which returned to a barbaric state (at least those that survived). Most technology and production capability is lost.  Queue the God-Emperor. In the 30th millennium He unites the warring tribes of Earth and embarks on a grand crusade to reclaim the galaxy, using legions of genetically engineered super-soldiers led by 20 pseudo-clones of Himself. However, half these legions and their pseudo-clone leaders rebel due to daddy issues, so once again a massive galactic war killing off even more technology and production capability.   For the past 10.000 years humanity in the 40k universe has seen constant war against aliens, daemons, heretics, seperatists,... The Imperium is the only hope for humanity's survival in a galaxy determined to wipe the species out forever. And if a few trillion people have to be sacrificed to protect the species, it's a small price to pay.   So how does this factor into the apparent low-tech equipment? Well, for starters, if you have been at war for 10.000 years you tend to go with stuff that is easily mass-produced, needs little maintenance and as little supply lines as possible. A riveted hull in the 40k universe is produced easier, far more quickly and cheaper than a welded one, with far more existing production lines. Retooling a production line is literally expressed in ""amount of planets lost due to lost production"", so is rarely worth it. Warm bodies is literally the only resource the Imperium has in anywhere near sufficient amount, so they expend that resource more freely to save on other resources. So everyone gets a riveted hull except the small amount of super-special super-soldiers, because those are the only ones whose lives is worth the investment.  New research is discouraged in favor of recovering old tech because not only is the old tech countless times better, but new research also carries the risk of deamonic corruption. Your new transistor design may be 50% more efficient, but in reality the idea was unknowingly planted in your head by a deamon lord and the new design spells out his name in some arcane language. Start mass-production and soon portals to hell open up all over your planet. As a result innovation is slow, deliberate and intensely studied for centuries before anything is done with it.  Humanity in the 40k universe is actually extremely practical. A Baneblade is basically a recovered ancient design for a light combat vehicle. The Imperium's MBT, the Leman Russ, is a recovered ancient farming tractor design refitted with guns iirc. The designs for real tanks have been lost for nearly 20.000 years, as are the manufacturing facilities. A tank like the Baneblade runs on pretty much any energy source, from highly refined fuel to radio-active material to even wood. Its energy weapons can be recharged by exposing them to sunlight or by throwing the batteries into a fire. It has a chapel because faith actually works in protecting the vehicle and its crew against the ever-present daemonic corruption. It sports relatively little advanced targeting equipment or smart weapons because those are expensive, maintenance-intensive and often barely functional due to the amount of electromagnetic radiation on a 40k battlefield. It's more effective to simply use those resources to build more guns.  The Tau appear high-tech because they are a tiny power tucked into a safe corner of the galaxy. They have no long supply lines, no pressing resource shortages, no constant threats and don't engage in wars on anywhere near the scale the Imperium does. They have the luxury to be able to consider an individual life valuable and build their vehicles accordingly.  Imperial tech is actually far more advanced, but is relatively rare due to the Imperium's many constraints."

TankPorn,2su89v,Hans-U-Rudel,6,Mon Jan 19 13:57:13 2015 UTC,"The 40k ""universe"" is vast and its authors tend to leave a lot to the imagination of the reader/player. Where in other popular scifi you are reading about the people in charge right in the middle of an universe-defining story, most 40k stories are about a simple cog in the machine during events that, though affecting billions, are fairly unimportant to the galaxy as a whole. Most of that backstory I posted is cobbled together from several editions of rulebooks and novels.  There are many options if you want to get into the lore. You could start playing the videogames (Dawn of War series or Space Marine are good introductions), but these tend to skip on the whole grimdark aspect. You could read around on wikipedia, the Lexicanum wiki or 1d4chan (for a more light-hearted approach). If you have money and a kidney to spare you could even start playing the game, since the rulebooks contain loads of background information.  But I think the best introduction is the novels. There's loads of them, ranging from excellent to utter crap. There's two main ""universes"" so to speak. The 40k universe deals with the events at the end of the 41st millennium and is the setting the tabletop game and videogames are set in. The more recent spinoff is the 30th millennium setting, the Horus Heresy series. They basically took what had up till then been legends of the Imperium's origin and expanded it into its own full-blown setting. Less grimdark and more action hero vibe than 40k fiction.  The genre of the books depends on the subject matter. Imperial Guard books read like war novels. Space Marine books are more action hero oriented, and only the best authors can write Space Marine characters with some actual depth. Inquisition books mostly deal with politics and everyday life. Books focusing on alien races can be just about anything.  Some suggestions for good starting books:   Anything by Dan Abnett, especially his Eisenhorn trilogy, Titanicus, Double Eagle and Brothers of the Snake. Ciaphas Cain series for a light-hearted look at the Imperial Guard Helsreach for some well-written Space Marines and for introducing one of 40k's most popular battlefields: the planet Armageddon. Dead Men walking for a nice look at Imperial life, my favourite Imperial Guard regiment and for nicely emphasizing the grimdark."

TankPorn,2su89v,wikingwarrior,3,Mon Jan 19 06:22:24 2015 UTC,"Because god forgive us if the universe that involves space orks strapping themselves onto giant rocks and hurtling themselves through space to crash land on a planet, reproduce via spores and kill everything with giant pieces of metal that function as guns simply because the Orks think they should isn't realistic. :P  Honestly I get what you're saying, but at some points the rule of cool is just enough, and if you want a Gothic stylization to a tank without strapping a gun to a cathedral, rivets are a surprisingly good choice."

TankPorn,2sg71i,Hambeggar,4,Thu Jan 15 01:33:01 2015 UTC,"As /u/Perry87 already said, not enough tension on the front idler, and the second thing is, these tanks have drive sprockets at the rear. That means that the tank moves when the sprockets pull the tracks from beneath the tank, moving it forward, and then just push the track over the return rollers, making it sag. If the tank was going in reverse, the top tracks would be tense as the sprocket was pulling them forward.  I made a paint sketch of how it works. German (and early american) tanks have it the other way around, because they have drive sprockets at the front."

TankPorn,2sg71i,Jammybeez,1 point,Thu Jan 15 06:08:53 2015 UTC,"I would say no. According to wikipedia the Soviets lost ~2000 tanks in the Battle of Berlin. Although a high number for the Allies, for the Russians that's nothing. They lost ~6000 at Kursk, ~4000 at Stalingrad, ~5000 at Białystok–Minsk during Operation Barbarossa (just to name a few battles for context).  Comparatively, the US loss 20,000 tanks in the entire war (although that number includes Japan).  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equipment_losses_in_World_War_II#Land  However, I will say that the development of the panzerfaust and panzerschreck turned the streets of Berlin into a death trap for tanks with all the Waffen-SS and Hitler Youth running around."

TankPorn,2sg71i,MisterMeatloaf,6,Thu Jan 15 03:48:03 2015 UTC,"Take it with a grain of salt as the Soviets counted losses in a very peculiar manner   German army and the Red Army counted their losses differently. Whereas the German army considered a vehicle lost when it is both destroyed and irrecoverable, the Red Army considered a vehicle lost even if it was repairable, including vehicles that got stuck in mud, fell off a bridge, etc."

TankPorn,2seg8f,irishjihad,6,Wed Jan 14 14:16:46 2015 UTC,"According to the IWM page:   Service history unverified - vehicle identitiy unknown with accuracy. The vehicle production number was on the piece of armour plate removed and disposed of by the Army when the vehicle was in the care of RCMS Shrivenham (no records kept). However, the Department of Tank Design report on the vehicle (M.6815A/8 No 1) states it is 300054 - an early 1944 production number. On at least two occasions the vehicle has been claimed as the one destroyed by Lieutenant Hugh Griffiths (later Lord Griffiths) 2nd Armoured Reconnaissance Battalion Welsh Guards, Hechtel, 1944. Indeed the IWM caption currently with the vehicle states this. This is a dubious claim. The identification is based purely on the location of the three shot grouping which knocked out the vehicle. A Mr Spielberger, a veteran of Panzergruppe Lex, part of 5th SS Panzer Division Wiking, makes a more convincing case that the vehicle was from his unit and was abandoned in northern Germany, near Gifhorn in April 1945 after an engine fire (there is evidence of such a fire). Two photographs (possibly taken by US Signal Corps photographers) in a book published by Spielberger called 'Sturmartillerie' definitely show the vehicle after abandonment. However, another correspondent (C S Layton) points out that the number of early production details on the vehicle mitigates against this claim (because Spielberger claims vehicle came to the unit in March 1945 straight off the production line)."

The BMP-1KSh had the armament replaced by the AMU ""Hawkeye"" 10 m long telescopic mast. It also has  extra folded down aerials on the sides. There were quite a few variants of the  BMP-1KSh but I can't find a picture to match this one exactly.  The Artillery reconnaissance vehicle PRP-4M ""Deyteriy"" was fitted with a fake gun mantlet. I understand the Russians did this so you could not pick out the command vehicles from other BMPs when doing reconnaissance on them. In the picture, it looks as though the mast/barrel is not attached to the turret which leads me to think along these lines too..  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMP-1_variants"

TankPorn,2s9mvw,LeuCeaMia,3,Wed Jan 14 00:46:02 2015 UTC,"You should see how Soviet tanks were inside.  IIRC their post-WW2 tanks required crews to be 5'7'' or LESS. Also German people that were children during WW1 and the early 1920s had stunted growth, so it might not have been that hard to find men that could fit in the E-10."
TankPorn,2s9mvw,Goons_Forever,1 point,Wed Jan 14 01:05:16 2015 UTC,"IIRC their post-WW2 tanks required crews to be 5'7'' or LESS.   It's not the tanks its just the recruitment standards (175 cm for the driver of a T-72) of the Soviets. The nations they exported their tanks or designs to had less stricter standards; e.g. the Finns and East Germans didn't seem to have problems fitting 6+ foot crewmen into their T-72s.   Their WW2 tanks are far from the least comfortable, so it wouldn't make sense for them to suddenly sabotage their ergonomics post war. A blanket height doesn't really make sense since every one of the crew positions in each and every type tank has different space characteristics."

TankPorn,2s9mvw,Goons_Forever,1 point,Mon Jan 19 18:23:09 2015 UTC,"IIRC in real life the 75mm L48 gun was capable of scoring kills closer up on heavies, but could do distance kills from the side and rear of the heavies; it could kill a T-34 or Sherman from a significant distance to the end of the war.  Is it not similar in the game?"

TankPorn,2s8s0a,burgerbob22,3,Tue Jan 13 08:44:35 2015 UTC,"Technically the designation would be M4A3(76)W HVSS. The E8 originally referred to just the HVSS suspension but with the complete switch over the arming Shermans with the 76mm gun it came to mean what we all recognize it as.   That is to say that M4A3E8 would be correct, but M4A3E8(76)W HVSS would be redundant, Its either M4A3(76)W HVSS or M4A3E8."

TankPorn,2s8s0a,McDutchy,1 point,Mon Jan 19 15:37:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it doesn't look all that appealing but I guess Gaijin decided to go function over form. Most hobby models of the E8 will show it without skirts but one can see them with the skirt mounting holes.  I assume Gaijin decided to go with the fresh production of the E8 since the skirts actually are a modeled piece of armor in-game and thus would help against HEAT and so on.  Extra info: Notice the mounting holes on the skirt supports.  http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/90/M4A3E8.JPG  Fresh production drawing of the E8:  http://i.imgur.com/EVn7Mtv.jpg"
TankPorn,2s8s0a,Hambeggar,1 point,Mon Jan 19 15:51:01 2015 UTC,In WT they are not modeled as armor. Tracks are but the skirts are transparent.
TankPorn,2s8s0a,McDutchy,1 point,Mon Jan 19 15:54:25 2015 UTC,"The Gaijin dev for tanks has said that skirts are modeled, they just do not show in the hangar armour inspector. They used to show in GF CBT until people complained that they could not inspect the armour behind it. I was one of those people complaining.  If you've played against the Pz3 M and Pz4 H, you would know they are indeed modeled.  EDIT: spelling."
TankPorn,2s8s0a,Hambeggar,2,Mon Jan 19 16:00:08 2015 UTC,It's easy to recognize how wider tracks the M4A3E8 had compared to other earlier variants. It had far better cross country abilities   (earlier Shermans tend to get stuck in bogs and muddy terrain due to its narrow tracks and higher ground pressure - that's why Soviet and German tanks had much wider tracks as well).
TankPorn,2s8s0a,videki_man,3,Tue Jan 13 13:37:24 2015 UTC,"Some German tanks had wider tracks. Most were still some variation of the Panzer III and IV chassis, and those did not have wide tracks."
TankPorn,2s8s0a,TheHIV123,1 point,Tue Jan 13 17:25:28 2015 UTC,"Indeed! That's why the Germans equipped many of their earlier tanks with so called Ostketten, or wider tracks (literally east-tracks) e.g. Panzer III or IV, and of course many vehicles using their chassis."
TankPorn,2s8s0a,videki_man,1 point,Tue Jan 13 19:17:46 2015 UTC,"Yes, the Americans had a similar solution for the Sherman."
TankPorn,2s6i9d,eskimobrother319,28,Mon Jan 12 17:03:18 2015 UTC,"At first I had thought this tank was something fresh off a Holywood set, but apparently it was an Army prototype around the late 1970s. Its either the High Survivability Test Vehicle - Lightweight (HSVT-L) platform, or the later Rapid Deployment Force Light Tank (RDF/LT). The HSVT had a 75mm gun, a .50cal ""coaxial"" gun in a really side mount, and a 7.62mm mounted MG. Likely, this is the RDF/LT, which is basically the same tank minus the MGs (it moved the 7.62 external MG to the Coax position).   It was a joint US Army and Marine Corps tank that was designed to provide light infantry support, while being heli-mobile. Additionally, the prototype was designed to have a replaceable turret. It could have the manned turret seen in this photo, or an automated cannon, which eliminated the loader spot, and allowed room for two AA missile pods, four missiles each. The funny looking gun is the ARES XM247 75mm automatic Cannon. It has impressive elevation, and suggests that it featured a high rate of fire. However, the ARES project fell through (reasons unknown), which required a redesign of the RDF/LT tank. However, the larger problems with the RDF/LT program killed this line of tank design. The Army wanted something bigger than the 75mm ARES or the 76mm gun on the redesigned RDF/LT. That killed this prototype, but pushed the Army towards the XM8 program. Additionally, the Army's TOW and HMMWV programs, as well as the Marine Corps LAV program, began to bear fruit. The HMMWV/TOW system promised high mobility and lethality against tanks, while the MC's LAV brought the Corps back to its amphibious roots.   Source:  R.P.

TankPorn,2s6i9d,BeondTheGrave,2,Mon Jan 12 18:37:56 2015 UTC,"Nice work. I was surprised to see that thing was a cannon, but I see it now that you mention. For some reason I initially thought this was some obscure combat engineering or armoured vehicle recovery platform, and that was some kind of cherrypicker crane or winch system.  Now that I'm not on mobile, that's a really strange tank. It's quite low to the ground and the slope on that upper front plate is insane - That ""automated"" turret is also a really cluttered profile, not sure what to think about that.  Any idea what's up with the metal boxes with crossbars on the back? Some sort of stripped-down mount or something?"
TankPorn,2s6i9d,FoxtrotZero,5,Tue Jan 13 03:08:19 2015 UTC,"On OP's image it's so low on the ground because all the torsion bars either snapped or were removed, so it's now sitting on it's belly. And I guess the frames on the rear would be stowage boxes.  image of it in it's prime"

TankPorn,2s6i9d,__Titans__,2,Wed Jan 14 06:47:44 2015 UTC,"Well they still use the Abrams, though that comes with all the baggage of using the Abrams. In terms of some kind of light tank or lightly armored infantry support vehicle, theres not really much. The Stryker MGS could operate in that role, but the I dont think the Corps uses the Stryker. The M551 is gone, and the M8 never saw mass production. So that leaves the US without a light tank. But on the other side of the coin, it also suggests that neither the Army or the Corps really want a light tank."

TankPorn,2s6i9d,PowderTrail,3,Mon Jan 12 17:23:30 2015 UTC,If the sites accurate it only has a 160km range. That's just short of 100 mile range. I'm not sure I'd be comfortable with that if I was in one during a long fight. I would hate for it to run out of fuel while moving around an active battlefield.  Edit: Someone linked another source below where it states a 298 mile range. I'd personally be OK with that. As a side note I've always been fascinated with small tanks. I especially like Sweden's Stridsvagn 103 aka the S-Tank.
TankPorn,2s6i9d,MustTurnLeftOnRed,2,Mon Jan 12 19:14:43 2015 UTC,It still seems quite poor (70 km less than Leo 2) considering it is a light vehicle (roughly 1/4 of Leo 2).   I've always been fascinated with small tanks   Super heavies is where it is at.

The only way to access them is internally, their inside the hull sponsons with nothing protecting the crew. The Tiger Ausf E/H doesn't even have its ready rack in the turret. The loader was expected to load from the sponsons once the ready rack has been depleted.  This contributes to why the Tiger Ausf. E/Hs, Panzer IVs and dry Shermans had a brew up rate of about 80%. For comparison the wet Shermans had a rate of at most 15% since all the ammo was relocated down low at the bottom of hull in addition to the bags of watered down antifreeze."

Not that I wish even more harm on the suffering Russian people... too many died for sure... but if Germany had been a little more effective in their defenses, after the Soviets had turned the tide.

And here is what is assumed to be him kneeling on the tank examining the vehicle with someone from the military"
TankPorn,2s1aky,Bounty66,14,Sun Jan 11 20:12:17 2015 UTC,"I saw a kinda dilapidated example at Ft. Knox Kentucky when I was in basic training in 1997. I was training to be a tanker.   It is massive. Each corner or ""fender"" has a hoist or crane to remove the outer tracks to facilitate track repairs or maintenance. While its length and width is huge it was the height: it was slung lower than I thought it would be as I've seen pics a teenager in those days. I would've thought it'd be much ""taller"".   From my understanding it wasn't meant to hunt other tanks. It was to heavy and slow to be a tank destroyer. Which also mean it could never really be used as a heavy tank either as it could never keep up to support light to medium tanks. It couldn't even be considered an infantry support tank (slow but able to keep up with infantry walking pace, a British tactic by ww2).   It was simply meant to intimidate the enemy and be used as a bunker buster. The German Maus by comparison may not be able to cross many bridges so Porche and (Krupp?) designed their super heavy to ford rivers submerged if needed. The T-28 American super heavy couldn't as far as I know.   Ultimately the super heavy class of tanks proved to be too expensive, to vulnerable, offered little speed/mobility, and where effectively proven almost useless. Only the Soviets came close to offering a massive useful tank."

In terms of its forward profile, it presents as much as, say, the Leopard 2A4 or thereabouts.  That, and the tank's armament is a fair bit more monstrous than its size. Load that 40mm autocannon up with 3P ammunition (as it probably would have, had the tank entered service), and it becomes capable of spewing airburst hell at anything its thermals catch sight of - say what you will about hitting it with ATGMs, but I certainly don't want to have to be the one carrying the ATGM into its firing position..."

Like so many stories our begins a few years before her final fate, in the busy industrial city of Birmingham located in the English midlands on what was most likely another damp and overcast day, it was here at the Birmingham Railway Carriage and Wagon Company or the Metropolitan Cammell Carriage and Wagon Company or the Vickers Armstrong Factory that our valentine rolled out of, the date; February the second 1943.  Some have said that our valentine was made in Canada, and this is the first point of contention, but the WD number being stamped on her hull Indicates it was British and built as part of batches T122698 - T123157 under order TM6116 in 1943 from here she was due to be shipped out via the Arctic convoy to the USSR, a journey some 2394 valentines had made from Britain and 1388 Canadian vehicles had taken, with 320 being lost at sea. however a lot of lend-lease deliveries to Russia were made through Iran or between Vladivostok and the American West Coast by Russian merchantmen in the Pacific, since Russia was neutral in the Pacific War between Japan and the United States. Which journey our Valentine took is a mystery but from either Murmansk or Vladivostok she was assigned to her proud new owners. It is often said the Soviets were not grateful for the supplies given and the commissariat would tell people they were soviet built, but even the lowliest conscript generally knew better, and one of the few vehicles that was actively asked for and openly welcome was the Valentine."

What-if builds are like speculative fiction in scale model form.  Like paper panzers becoming reality if the second world war had gone into 1949, or imagining if some Western aligned countries had ended up in the Soviet sphere and building models of Warsaw pact hardware in makings and camouflage they never sported in real life.

TankPorn,2rewsn,angrydroid,5,Tue Jan 6 03:40:52 2015 UTC,I find it a bit difficult to believe that a small shaped-charge on a pole would be sufficient to overturn the entire tank.   yeah very plausible
TankPorn,2rewsn,angrydroid,8,Mon Jan 5 18:13:37 2015 UTC,I'd be more inclined to believe it the result of stories I heard about Japanese soldiers left behind hiding in spider holes with basically an artillery shell and a hammer to set it off as tanks drove over them. These shaped charges would have penetrated the interior surely but they were not very high yield in the boom department.
TankPorn,2rewsn,angrydroid,3,Mon Jan 5 18:40:38 2015 UTC,that is an interesting hypothesis that I haven't ever heard before but I def would believe it. I've read stories about how they prepared for the land invasion from the Americans and made very very elaborate tunnels in the mountain regions. That would've probably ended in a bloody stalemate. They were ready for the Americans.
TankPorn,2rewsn,wikingwarrior,9,Mon Jan 5 18:48:18 2015 UTC,It would seem that I may be onto something here. Based on some brief research it would appear this particular wreck fell victim to a buried aerial bomb. Seems to be a pretty well-documented incident.

At risk of pedantry, I'd just point out that the ""lunge mine"" that you linked to isn't really what I would consider a proper improvised device in that it appears to be manufactured. Basically it's just sort of a panzerfaust minus the rocket propulsion.

TankPorn,2rewsn,LouisBalfour82,1 point,Tue Jan 6 15:50:35 2015 UTC,"More famous for them? Yes yes it was. Maybe not more likely, but  the problem was that the MkIVs, Stugs and I think MkIIIs kept their ammunition in steel lockers, so their ammo was less likely to get damaged in the event of a penetration, the Sherman (and most other tanks of the era) did not, of course a huge percentage of what American tank crew saw were these tanks, so they assumed they had a weakness rather than the Germans just having a strength.  Certainly when the glycerin based wet stowage system on the M4A1 76 and later model of Shermans it was actually significantly less likely than the average tank, but that was later in the war.   But there was a reason it was called the ""Ronson"" and ""Tommy Cooker"" though, they burned.  TL,DR: Yes they burned more than their better protected German counterparts but not more than any other tank probably."

Patton (1970) used M48 Pattons to play both US and Afrika Korps tanks (rather amusingly) The Misfit Brigade (1980) used SU-100s as stand-ins for Jagdpanthers The ""Tiger I"" in Saving Private Ryan (1998) was built around a T-34-85.  Band of Brothers (2001) used a replica Jagdpanther, built on the chassis of a T-55. White Tiger (2012) uses a (very unconvincing) replica Porsche Tiger, built on the chassis of an IS-2.

The Crusader has that type of armour built into its design.  Notice that the spacing between the hull and the skirt is much more pronounced with armour intended to defend against HEAT through predetonation."
TankPorn,2r9x9w,LeuCeaMia,2,Sun Jan 4 11:10:33 2015 UTC,"HEAT rounds weren't much of a threat (if a threat at all) at the time schürzen was introduced, but that doesn't change the fact that it proved effective in defeating them...after all, the Soviets introduced similar measures, in part to defeat panzerfausts and panzerschrecks."
TankPorn,2r9x9w,dziban303,1 point,Sun Jan 4 22:21:38 2015 UTC,"The schürzen would actually make penetration more likely since the spacing actually helped early HEAT rounds.  Shaped charges operate best if they detonate a certain distance instead of on contact, further away the larger the diameter of the warhead.  The M1 Bazooka was introduced in June 1942 while the RPG-43 was introduced in 1943 so ironically schürzen came out in mass when the allies were already equipped with man portable HEAT leading to the myth that it could actually defend against such threats."
TankPorn,2r9x9w,LeuCeaMia,1 point,Mon Jan 5 04:04:49 2015 UTC,"No but they did work against HEAT rounds, completely accidentally by doing just that and their later wire mesh variants were intended for just HEAT rounds."
TankPorn,2r9x9w,wikingwarrior,1 point,Tue Jan 6 19:46:49 2015 UTC,"The distinct lack of schürzen on the sponsons and the turret sides and rear of the Panther, Tiger Ausf E and Ausf B, all of which easy places to penetrate with a bazooka, is pretty telling that it was only effective against AT rifle rounds. Their spaced completely inappropriately for use against HEAT.  Mesh schürzen works like perforated armour to produce yaw in AT rifle rounds making them more effective than the simple 5 mm plates against ATRs."

TankPorn,2r9x9w,ironflesh,3,Mon Jan 5 16:48:24 2015 UTC,"Apparently it was developed because it's a weak point on the Merkava where hits from rockets can jam the turret.

TankPorn,2r6fms,Tied12,1 point,Sat Jan 3 11:38:33 2015 UTC,"Apparently the T-80 they were based on were beyond improvement and performed so poorly they didnt want to base off it.   Nope, what happened was that the company which made T-80Us, Omsktransmash was going bankrupt by the early 2000s and the one making T-80UDs became owned by the state of Ukraine when the USSR dissolved. Which leaves UralVagonZavod to develop the new tank.   UVZ had nothing to do with the Object 640 nor the T-80; the product code they were assigned to is Object 1xx. They made the Object 172(T-72), 187, 188 (T-90), 195 (""T-95"") and 148 (""T-14"") so it highly unlikely they'd ever throw away their own ideas and base their latest tank on something their competitor made.

TankPorn,2qz8fa,DeusExCalamus,7,Thu Jan 1 06:32:37 2015 UTC,"reduce recoil,  help vent the gasses from the gun in a direction that kicks up less dust, etc"
TankPorn,2qz8fa,Yianna,4,Thu Jan 1 06:41:26 2015 UTC,"A lot of muzzle brakes also reduce noise and pressure at the muzzle because they turn one big boom into many smalls booms that leave through different holes at sligthly different times. The ISU-152s muzzle brake is a good example for this because the pressure in the barrel is released ""slower""."
TankPorn,2qz8fa,DeusExCalamus,3,Thu Jan 1 17:20:47 2015 UTC,"Yep, this is true. I also read somewhere (I don't remember where now) that if the brake on the King Tiger (or maybe it was the JagdTiger) was damaged, the crew weren't supposed to fire the gun, because it would damage the tank"
TankPorn,2qz8fa,LeuCeaMia,1 point,Thu Jan 1 22:11:38 2015 UTC,"if the brake on the King Tiger (or maybe it was the JagdTiger) was damaged, the crew weren't supposed to fire the gun, because it would damage the tank   That's true for all tanks with muzzle brakes as compensating for recoil is their main purpose. If the tank's recoil system could be made sufficient on its own there's no reason to have a muzzle brake although a blast deflector may be fitted. Directing exhaust gasses backwards towards the tank, the crew and any nearby supporting troops is best avoided.   Which is why the Panther Ausf F got rid of the muzzle brake because the new system could handle the increase in recoil force from 12 to 18 tonnes. Also why you don't see any muzzle brakes on most modern tanks that and they affect APFSDS accuracy."
TankPorn,2qz8fa,DeusExCalamus,1 point,Fri Jan 2 10:37:20 2015 UTC,"Also why you don't see any muzzle brakes on most modern tanks   A shame, I rather like the look, I think it makes them look meaner."

You are right, and especially in 1943 the Stuart, which had been built since the 30's, was much more readily availible.    I think it was the Panzer III that mounted the 50mm.

TankPorn,2qw2y4,lljkotaru,5,Wed Dec 31 13:22:21 2014 UTC,There is no escape hatch near the commander or gunner. The ammo carousel occupies the entirety of the bottom of the fight compartment.  The driver does have access to an escape hatch however.

TankPorn,2qw2y4,solipsistnation,3,Wed Dec 31 15:05:42 2014 UTC,"Not on T-72s. The ammo is in a carousel immediately underneath the turret. There's a 3-man crew and an autoloader. M1 Abrams tanks have 4-man crews and no autoloader, and the firewalls you're thinking of, plus panels that can easily burst upward, directing ammo explosions away from the crew. The Soviets went with an autoloader figuring that if there was a nuclear war and their crews were dying of radiation poisoning, they could still load and fire the gun..."
TankPorn,2qw2y4,kickah,3,Wed Dec 31 15:59:44 2014 UTC,your conclusion about autoloader is absolutely wrong
TankPorn,2qw2y4,solipsistnation,2,Wed Dec 31 22:45:21 2014 UTC,Oh? I've heard it from a number of sources. What is yours?
TankPorn,2qw2y4,kickah,3,Wed Dec 31 22:54:22 2014 UTC,"main reason - the tank needs less crew. 2. size is smaller 3. and so is weight. It takes less resources to manufacture.  Tanks are only equipment that would work in ""nuclear"" conditions. it is absolute nonesense to claim that tanks were built for smaller to somehow minimize damage from radiation YET no other measures were taken. Sorry bro, I didn't mean to be mean."
TankPorn,2qw2y4,solipsistnation,2,Thu Jan 1 04:22:21 2015 UTC,"No worries. I like talking about this stuff, and if I'm wrong, I'm wrong. I'd go tell the people I heard that from (mostly MVTF tour guides), but I'm not really in contact with them any more since the MVTF closed down.  It seems like a lot of expensive equipment just for smaller size, is all. Maybe the nuclear war thing was just a useful side effect of the autoloader. Was it enough of a difference to make up for having more complex equipment to build and maintain?   It is a pretty good illustration of the difference between US and Soviet tank designs, either way-- 4-man crews and larger tanks vs. 3-man crews and smaller tanks, and the other differences."
TankPorn,2qw2y4,LeuCeaMia,2,Thu Jan 1 04:58:38 2015 UTC,"The Soviets went with an autoloader figuring that if there was a nuclear war and their crews were dying of radiation poisoning, they could still load and fire the gun...   The Soviets started the NBC protection craze in the first place... Their tanks have had it installed as standard in some form since the T-55.  The bottom of the hull was the safest place to store ammunition back when the T-72's autoloader was designed, almost half a century ago. Note that neither the M60, Chieftain nor the Leopard 1 had blow out panels.  Newer bustle autoloaders like that on the Object 640 or the T-84 Yatagan have blow-out panels.  From: Vasiliy Fofanov's website   Note however, that opposite to a common belief the carousel is well protected from above. During loading, the round passes through the door that closes after the tray has retracted, and therefore in the case of turret penetration the incandescent splinters will land on the autoloader roof and not ignite the carousel. Nevertheless, the extra rounds stored in the fighting compartment are very likely to ignite in this case, and of course the lower hull penetration is quite deadly.  In other words, not the autoloader per se, but the whole notion of placing ammunition inside a fighting compartment makes the tank very susceptible to catastrophic fire if penetrated from virtually any angle. This has been amply illustrated by the conflicts in which T-72s and T-80s have participated.    Indeed storing ammo as low as possible is part of the reason why the M4 (W) Shermans were so much more survivable compared to the Panzers and early Shermans (15% vs 80% brew up rates). Still the watered down antifreeze jackets makes them a less likely to brew then even T-34s (15% vs 25%). The autoloader itself however can only fit about half a regular ammo load.  While the Russians address the loose crew compartment ammo by storing them outside. Partly why the Second Chechen War had much better after penetration survival rates than the first."
TankPorn,2qw2y4,solipsistnation,2,Thu Jan 1 03:43:48 2015 UTC,"Do you know if the carousel is less protected in T-72Ms vs. non-export T-72s? It seems like when I was poking around a T-72M that the carousel was pretty exposed, but that vehicle had been around and might have been partially dismantled before ending up in a private collection."

TankPorn,2qu4kx,dubdubdubdot,3,Tue Dec 30 18:32:19 2014 UTC,"From the video description, feel free to point out any errors:  The new Russian military T-14 Armata Main Battle Tank Concept could make a very good rival to the US military M1 Abrams Tank. The ""Armata"" Universal Combat Platform is a Russian advanced next generation heavy military tracked vehicle platform. The ""Armata"" platform is intended to be the basis for a main battle tank, a heavy infantry fighting vehicle, a combat engineering vehicle, an armoured recovery vehicle, a heavy armoured personnel carrier, a tank support combat vehicle and several types of self-propelled artillery under the same codename based on the same chassis. It will also serve as the basis for artillery, air defense, and NBC defense systems.[1]  Type Tracked Heavy Armored Vehicle Place of origin Russia Service history Used by Armed Forces of the Russian Federation (Future) Production history Designer Ural Design Bureau of Transport Machine-Building, Uralvagonzavod Unit cost unknown Produced 2015 Specifications Weight 55 tons Crew 3 Armor classified Main armament Depends on versions (125mm smoothbore 2A82 tank cannon on the tank version) Secondary armament Depends on versions (remote controlled Kord-12.7 mm heavy machine gun and PK machine gun on the tank version) Engine A-85-3A diesel engine 1,500–2,000 h.p. Transmission 8-speed automatic gearbox Speed 75 kilometres per hour (47 mph)  Origin of designation[edit] The name designation of this tank (or more correctly ""prospective family of heavy unified battlefield platforms"" – ""перспективный ряд тяжёлых унифицированных платформ поля боя"") ""Armata"" is the plural of the Hellenic (Greek) word ""arma""(άρμα), which means weapon and was an old Russian word for early guns. This was wrongly transcribed as ""Armada"" by journalists on several occasions.[2][3][4]  Development[edit] Prototypes of heavy armored vehicles based on the Armata combat platform are planned to be presented at the defense exhibition Russian Arms Expo in Nizhny Tagil in September 2013.[5] Testing of the Armata will begin in November 2013.[6]  The new tank is under development at Uralvagonzavod in Nizhny Tagil. The first deliveries of the tank to the Russian Armed Forces are scheduled for 2015 and mass production is due to begin in 2016.[7] A total of 2,300 MBTs are expected to be supplied by 2020,[8] modernizing 70 percent of the Russian tank fleet.[9]  According to the General Director of Uralvagonzavod the first vehicles will be shown in the 2015 Victory parade.[10]  Design[edit] Russian Lieutenant-General Yuri Kovalenko states that the ""Armata"" combat platform will utilize many features of the T-95 tank, of which only a few prototypes have been built. In the main battle tank variant, the ammunition compartment will be separate from the crew, increasing operational safety while the engine will be more powerful and the armor, main gun and autoloader will be improved.  According to preliminary reports, the new tank designated T-14 will be less radical and ambitious than the canceled ‘Object 195’ or T-95, it will weigh less, therefore, become more agile and will be more affordable, compared to its more ambitious predecessors. Additionally, the Kurganets-25 tracked armored vehicle provides high degree of commonality with the new Armata tank. The Kurganets-25 will evolve into various models, gradually replacing BMP and BMD and MT-LB and other types of tracked armored platforms.[8] The Kurganets-25 will have modular armor that can be upgraded for specific threats, be armed with a 2A42 30 mm autocannon, and have four Kornet-EM anti-tank guided missile launchers.[9]  The tank will have an unmanned, remotely controlled turret. It will be digitally controlled by a crewmember located in a separate compartment. It is believed that this would eventually lead to the development of a fully robotic tank.[11]  Vehicles of the Armata platform will be equipped with the radar and other technologies found on the Sukhoi T-50 fifth-generation jet fighter. They include a Ka band radar (26.5-40 GHz) based on AESA radar. The devices should be ready by 2015.[12]  According to the Steel Scientific Research Institute enterprise, the company that is developing the material, the new armor does not lose its qualities and can be used in Arctic temperatures.[13]  The Armata tank will have a remote weapon station turret and an automated control system, with the crew protected by an armored capsule. It will have an externally mounted 125 mm gun with 32 rounds of ammunition; in addition to tank rounds, a new laser-guided missile able to be fired from the main gun with a tandem anti-tank warhead and a range of 5,000 m (16,000 ft) is planned to be created. Secondary armament will consist of a 30 mm cannon and a 12.7 mm machine gun.[14]The 30mm gun may be effective against lots of civilian vehicles, terrorist bomb cars, light military vehicle and military equipment such as radar and equipment of tank and APC."

TankPorn,2qu4kx,CannibalFruit,1 point,Tue Jan 6 06:19:00 2015 UTC,"Saying and doing are two completely different things.  We all know military contractors and militaries in general have lofty hopes and even loftier expectations and wishes, which usually come to nothing.  And I highly doubt they'd be autonomous, more like piloted by humans, probably remotely."
TankPorn,2qu4kx,brendon114,1 point,Tue Jan 6 22:24:07 2015 UTC,"They dont intend for it to be fully autonomous, theres a line in there somewhere about making sure humans are controlling any lethal actions, but as far as giving waypoints and letting it observe its surroundings that is what they want."

TankPorn,2qu4kx,Brother_Morr,-8,Tue Dec 30 22:05:29 2014 UTC,"/u/jeffgoldbum deleted this comment:   In a theoretical situation ignoring air forces, logistics and a few other things like that, Russia has 18,000 generation 3 tanks either active or in proper storage, Russia also has thousands of second generation tanks mothballed, Same with their APCs/IFVs, they have tens of thousands of them, many have some sort of ATGM system, or at least an auto cannon. The whole of NATO has something like 16,000 tanks of all generations, and just about the same number of APCs/IFV So in a theoretical situation, Russia has more armored vehicles then NATO, and ignoring a lot of other major important factors, they have the stronger ground forces. In reality, Russia could never support even half that force, and even then they could only do so for a relatively short time NATO has more planes, more bombers, they have better trained troops, they have a lot more troop anti tank devices, plus unlike Russia they could support the majority of their armed forces for some time. However a conventional war would still be drawn out for months or years, kills thousands and probably millions and cause devastation over most of eastern Europe and into Russia So how does this answer your question, Well even if they could only make 100-300 of the it would still have an overall impact depending on how they where used, Probably much like a strong support tank.   Russia wont let there be a conventional war on their borders or in their airspace, they will use tactical nukes on any fleet or base that NATO would try to operate from and if by some nato miracle it does happen, Russia has China as an ally that NATO would also have to account for in the pacific and Iran/Syria/Lebanon in the middle east who will attack the Gulf and close the strait of Hormuz. Turkey has also been showing signs of siding with Russia with recent energy contracts. Russia has NATOs nuts in a jar that's why the US backed down over Syria and uses war criminal proxies on Russia's border instead."

Meanwhile similar comments that are anti Russia get upvoted without second thought. You could just ignore the comment and move on you know.

TankPorn,2qt0qb,rangamatchstick,1 point,Tue Dec 30 22:17:55 2014 UTC,maybe some of their features are used on the russian modern tanks?
TankPorn,2qt0qb,AdwokatDiabel,7,Wed Dec 31 00:45:47 2014 UTC,"A glimpse of the past, an Object 187 in trials, apparently a screen cap from a video.  One of the most peculiar features of the Object 187 is that its glacis isn't at the 68.5 degrees standard set by the T-64.   That feature plus the welded slab sided turret, makes it no longer look like it was designed in the 60s' when spherical cast turrets and simple wedge shaped glacises were the defacto world standard. Although personally I love the look of 60s' tanks over modern ones."
