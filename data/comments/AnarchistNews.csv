With their weapons trained on the men, officers scream at them to keep their hands up.  While two of the men in the videos remain motionless, Diaz Zeferino appears confused by the officers’ instructions. He drops and raises his arms repeatedly, showing the officers his hands and stepping backward and then forward a few paces. A laser dot from an officers’ pistol can be seen on his shirt.

AnarchistNews,3e3j2t,burtzev,0,Tue Jul 21 23:40:40 2015 UTC,Fuck off  Not every one subscribes to every sub. If this wasn't posted here I wouldn't have seen it.  While your busy being upset about internet points op is busy trying to increase the scale of dialogue about living wage.
AnarchistNews,3e3j2t,MyLoveHammer,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:07:37 2015 UTC,"Actually he's doing no such thing. Have a look at his posting history, and you may begin to understand why he is possibly the most banned person on reddit. As I have said before I am not the only person he copies from, and actually not the major one. He has bots that scan certain people and subreddits to pick up what they post and repost it, not uncommonly in more than 15 or 20 places. In actual fact postnationalism is the most ultimate points grabber I have seen in all my years on reddit. Also, to repeat myself I have made it plain several times that I don't give a shit if he copies anything of mine without attribution except for items that come from r/worldanarchism . That is a sub that I wish to promote because it has a clear and consistent ideology that I wish to propagate. As for pn he will gladly repost totally contradictory opinions for the sake of his karma. He doesn't care.  I don't know how many times I have communicated my displeasure with pn's parasitism to him, but I most certainly intend to continue doing so. Now, as to pn's being a ""friend of the workers"", once more examine what he actually posts. In fact he has only two political views, maybe three if you include his use of 'free speech' as a defence after he offends people for totally non-political reasons.  These two views are 1) being in support of open immigration - which is ok and continued promotion of any and all free trade agreements which, of course reduce wages and not only in the wealthier countries but in the poorer countries that sign them. That's it. Nothing more. To misquote Churchill, ""some living, some wage"". The 'dialogue' about a 'living wage' is all over the internet, and you can easily find it. If you want to stick to reddit follow r/labor, r/progressive, r/demsocialist, any of the 'reform' socialist subreddits launched in disgust with the Stalinist influence at r/socialism or God knows how many more.  The last time pn and his habits were discussed on this board was about 3 months ago See http://www.reddit.com/r/AnarchistNews/comments/31hxwo/so_upostnationalist_seems_to_be_blatently? (The title continues ""...spamming/trolling us at this point). A lot of the evidence presented there was in reference to my own posts, but at least one other person chimed in with how pn was ""reposting his items within seconds"" of his posting them.   I said there what I said here today. I didn't care then about his copying in matters unconnected to the subreddit I am presently promoting. I, however, have opinions that I wish to promote, and unlike pn I have promoted these opinions for coming on 45 years without any personal gain and sometimes with personal loss. This sort of willingness to fight for a cause is alien to the mind of somebody like pn who is dedicated only to himself. If I was a better person I'd pity him, but my moral development isn't that high.  There is a simple solution for pn - if he ever stops acting like a two bit con man - in my case. He can post anything from me that is not connected with r/worldanarchism under the pretense he has found it and is familiar with it or even vaguely knowledgeable about the issues involved. When, however, he attempts to pretend concern about issues that are promoted by r/worldanarchism I demand proper credit because the causes promoted there are very much not anything to do with any personal advantage of mine.  That's it, except for the fact that it is a sign of maturity to not begin comments -even on the internet - with the words ""fuck off""."

AnarchistNews,3dyo14,shattered-edifice,2,Mon Jul 20 16:38:05 2015 UTC,"Interesting article. I note that the author is quite happy in quoting the 109 out of 201 members of the Syriza Central Committee who signed the statement against the government's acceptance of the EU terms. They are less forthcoming with the fact that the 39 MPs who didn't vote for the agreement were outnumbered by the rest of the 149 Syriza reps. Nor do they mention the fact that some of these 39 either abstained or were conveniently absent at the time of the vote.  It's a normal human failing, selectively choosing the evidence, but it gives a distorted picture of the strength of the Syriza 'left'. It should also be pointed out that the author refers to 3 different oppositions within Syriza, 'Left Platform, Left Current' and 'Red Network'. The opposition to the 'moderates' in power within the party are anything but a united force.   Personally I wouldn't hope for much success on their part. The difference between the numbers in the CC and the numbers in Parliament show one thing that anyone familiar with faction fighting in social democratic parties know. The winners, who are pretty well always on the right wing, have a clear realistic picture of what realpolitik it takes to win. They will set out to capture the important levers of power within the party. The leftist islands can be left for a later cleanup. The leftists, meanwhile, are almost always obsessed with having the 'correct program', the fine details of which they will argue endlessly about with each other while the world outside goes on. I wonder exactly how one is 'elected' to the CC of Syriza.  What happens in the next year will be interesting to watch. The situation is complex because not only is Syriza a coalition of factions but so are the oppositions, both inside and outside the party. For me it's like a refresher course, so to speak, of how social democratic parties operate internally.  Given the relative youth of the party the controlling elements haven't had time to develop the usual unspoken levers of control that the right wing of such parties usually has - I ""think"", there may be routes of influence impossible to see from the outside or even to the 'inside' of naïve but enthusiastic members unconnected with a faction.   Syriza is also different from a lot of social democratic parties in the Anglosphere in that there is no 'two front battle' within affiliated unions. Or, to second guess myself again are there also union battlegrounds in those brought in by PASOK deserters to Syriza ? Watch these buggers. They are crafty indeed as the case of both Spain and France has shown. The bureaucrats are totally able to change their visible ideological clothes while never getting up from the desks they occupy."

These incidents happen all too often, too many officers poking their dicks and pussies into too many peoples business. However, it's not really their fault that we accept such PISS poor excuses for the people we expect to protect and serve us as well as uphold our laws. I know not all officers are bad, recognize the job is often incredibly difficult/stressful, and respect anyone who puts on that uniform knowing they might die in the line of duty, but all that respect goes out the door when you lose your temper and body slam a harmless, handcuffed, girl to the floor because you can't control your rage.

Re what had occurred at a remote aboriginal community, shortly after Queen Elizabeth visited the Flying Doctor Base at Alice Springs, March, 29, 1963.  Some time after her visit images that appeared to have been taken with modern circa 1963 photographic equipment, which resembled official police photographs, were passed from hand to hand at Port Augusta High School.  The one I saw showed an aboriginal girl of about 8 yrs whose body was severed completely in two, from about her breast bone one side to her kidney region the other.  The Northern Territory politician who raised the matter on a number of occasions in the face of hostile criticism, is thought to have met his demise at the height of the controversy, check Hansard.   Edit: At a game of football in Alice Springs in 1966, a middle aged aboriginal man approached the group I was with and told an identical story, that the Royal Party including the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh had carried out a massacre at his home community.  His tale evoked memories of the photograph I had seen at school three yrs before, and of the news reports re the questions in Parliament .. he wandered thru the crowd telling everyone the same story.  A local bloke said he was on about the same thing all the time, and that he repeated the same material to everyone he came in contact with, the local consensus was that it was true, but in the absence of an official inquiry what the Hell are you gonna do about it.    As well News.Yahoo should follow up on the matter of 17 yo Latvian Alisa Dmitrijeva, who went missing from her home in August 2011.

At that time, both my parents' jobs involved cleaning toilets at a private school. ... After this experience (and others like it), I found myself alienated by the feminist movement, at least in the way it was expressed in its upper-middle-class form at an upper-middle-class university. While I maintained my commitment to the fight for women's equality, I turned instead to local labor organizing""  ""These Marxists [Frederick Engels, Rosa Luxemburg, Clara Zetkin, etc], while staunch theorists and fighters for women's liberation, also strongly opposed the feminist movements of their time--composed largely of upper-class women interested primarily in winning rights for the women of their own social class, often at the expense of the working class.""  ""For example, the early-twentieth-century German women's suffrage movement did not challenge the property requirements that denied working-class men the right to vote--knowing that such requirements would also deny voting rights to working-class women. Maintaining such property requirements could only strengthen the political weight of the middle and upper classes, while the working class would remain politically voiceless. ""  ""The self-identified women's liberation movement of the 1960s and 1970s was composed not only of liberal, predominantly white feminist organizations but also of socialist feminists and Marxist feminists, as well as Black feminists and other feminists of color.

AnarchistNews,3d1nek,burtzev,4,Sun Jul 12 20:05:00 2015 UTC,"The first thing you should 'make of this' is that you should chose evidence that actually supports your case. The article you linked to states very clearly that there were times when the debt was reduced ie part of it was written off and the payment term extended. It is as if I were to take out a $5000 loan with an agreement to pay it back in five years. One year later my debt would be reduced to $4000, and the new terms were ten years. Six years later the debt would be reduced to $2000 and I would be given 20 years to pay. Finally, ten years later, the sum would be reduced to $500 and I was given a final 5 years to pay. At the end of that term I paid it off. I'd like it if I could get loans from the same lenders as Germany did.  As to 'tu quoque' it doesn't apply in a situation where the argument is about the moral standing of one party in relation to its denigration of another party. In that (this !) case ""you too"" is very applicable because the subject is very much the moral standing of an accuser."
AnarchistNews,3d1nek,Reset_the_World,6,Sun Jul 12 20:22:36 2015 UTC,"Well I disagree. Invoking the 'tu quoque' card may be a debate ender in philosophy seminars, but in the real world where interests are at stake (always) and it is a matter of political debate it is very much legitimate. In other words 'academic purity' is only applicable when there is absolutely nothing at stake. Life is not a seminar.  To be all academic about it the 'argument by analogy' I presented is very much to the point. No doubt any debt can be paid off if it is reduced enough and delayed long enough. A recipient of such generous largesse isn't on the 'moral high ground' when dunning others to 'replay their debt' unless, of course, they are willing to extend the creditor the same advantage they had. The whole matter is actually in the Bible where Jesus speaks of motes in your neighbour's eye and beams in one's own. One of the many quotations about hypocrisy."

AnarchistNews,3c6q86,spotries,3,Sun Jul 5 13:26:40 2015 UTC,"There are a few funny things about that -- not all of which can be entirely blamed upon Wisconsinites.  First, and in my mind perhaps most disturbingly, is what happened to the offices of a coalition which was largely behind the recall.  We Are Wisconsin was the group that passed the petition and then was getting out the vote against Walker in the recall election.  Their offices burnt to the ground 10 days before that election.  For whatever reason... not much was ever made of that incident.  Walker won the recall election and everything proceeded as if nothing happened.    Second... the candidate that the Democrats ran against Walker was they guy he just beat.  That wouldn't be so bad except for the fact that the guy was anti-union -- which was pretty much a central factor in the whole election.  So, of course he lost.    Third... in the most recent election they may have fielded a more viable candidate, but Walker with all of his Koch money and support massively outspent her.  And it seems like nobody knows how to win an election if they don't spend the most on the campaign.    Again, I'm not totally excusing or justifying everything that happened in Wisconsin... but it deserves to be put into perspective.  And 100,000 people did march on the state Capitol and tens-of-thousands stayed there for days.  They should have coordinated a general strike, but top union officials put the kibosh on that pretty quick.  So... it can be difficult to beat an Imperial Walker."

AnarchistNews,3c94xh,VincenzoDR,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:52:39 2015 UTC,"Good for you for deciding to vote for someone who supports our interests. Voting shouldn't be considered incompatible with Anarchism because voting is one of many ways how the people can make their voice heard. Not voting would mean that only the corporatists would have power because someone is getting elected no matter what. Better to make sure the person elected is someone who represents the views of the people than allow the opposite to occur.  Not voting is half a vote for the opposition and demonstrates tacit consent towards the opposition.  Democracy doesn't exist without civic engagement. Isn't it at least a little suspicious that the billionaire corporatists that bribe our officials want to make it harder for us to vote? That's in addition to the fact that ancap Stefan Molyneux is trying to convince people not to vote as well. It's as if they have something to lose when there's an informed and active electorate. Sure beats opposing our natural allies (like Bernie) who represent our views and put those views in a positive light so we can gain supporters. Revolutions don't happen until most people want it and they won't want one if we don't show by example that we are more practical and more just. To not vote is to be reactionary as it is counter productive to turn our backs on the hallmark of Anarchism: democracy.  So if you consider Anarchism to be practical opposition to illegitimate power, and not just opposition to government, I'd say that voting is an important part of Anarchism."

Overdiagnosis trivializes the difficulty that those people experience and can lead well-intentioned people to reduce a serious disability to nothing more than ""imagination.""

AnarchistNews,3bc8fw,msc7683,2,Sun Jun 28 11:30:48 2015 UTC,"Actually not. The word 'communism' had a meaning long before the birth of post-modernist fashion, and it will have a meaning long after said fashion is consigned to the same archives in which Thomist philosophy, Hegelianism, Christology, positivism and dozens of other 'new and brilliant insights' reside. It means an economic system wherein individuals and families contribute labor in common and take goods from a common stock. In  practice such systems have usually been administered by an authoritarian ruling class and with rather strict sanctions via social convention. The longest lasting example in historical times were the Jesuit Reductions of South America.  This economic system is quite (and obviously) separate from the modern states that have used 'communism' as an ideological justification. Those states are what is more commonly understood as ""communist"" in everyday speech. The actual original and economic meaning can be better gathered from reading say the Bible than from any Stalinist propaganda.   Stalinist states have been ""communist"" in the same sense as the Holy Roman Empire was ""Holy"" and ""Roman"". They most certainly deserve to be demonized, and one of the authors you mention, Zizek, makes a very good and persistent effort at exorcising said demon. He did, after all, have the perspective given by having lived under one such class system.  The 'socialism' the author of the article is speaking about is not synonymous with communism. In actual fact pretty well every modern society, perhaps every society ever, has segments of its economy that are ""communist"". It couldn't function otherwise. The largest segment of our present economies happens within the bounds of family relations. Communism in the original sense is mostly about distribution. Socialism is about power relations in production.  Nope, I'm not searching for the word ""communism"" at all, and neither is the author."

AnarchistNews,3b7pys,shattered-edifice,2,Fri Jun 26 17:19:36 2015 UTC,"""What is more useful to us as anarchists is using intersectionality to understand how the daily lives of people can be used to talk about the ways in which structures and institutions intersect and interact. This project can inform our analyses, strategies, and struggles against all forms of domination. That is, anarchists might use lived reality to draw connections to institutional processes that create, reproduce, and maintain social relations of domination. Unfortunately, a liberal interpretation of intersectionality precludes this kind of institutional analysis, so while we might borrow from intersectionality, we also need to critique it from a distinctly anarchist perspective.  It is worth noting that there really is no universally-accepted interpretation of intersectionality. Like feminism, it requires a modifier in order to be truly descriptive, which is why we’ll use the term “anarchist intersectionality” to describe our perspective in this essay. We believe that an anti-state and anti-capitalist perspective (as well as a revolutionary stance regarding white supremacy and heteropatriarchy) is the logical conclusion of intersectionality. However, there are many who draw from intersectionality, yet take a more liberal approach. Again, this can be seen in the criticisms of “classism” rather than capitalism and class society, and the frequent absence of an analysis of the state. Additionally, there is also at times a tendency to focus almost solely on individual experiences rather than systems and institutions."""

The 5 volcano summits in that region are all sacred to native islanders, ( only high-ranking tribal chiefs were allowed to even set foot on the summits.)  BUT only the very summit, Kūkahau‘ula, is sacred and forbidden, the rest of the volcano is not....natives have been exploiting the volcano for centuries now...Around 1100, natives established adze quarries high up on Mauna Kea to extract the uniquely dense basalt and starting around 1600 started planting tons of farms alongside Mauna Kea.   The observatories on Mauna Kea, are not on the summit, right next to it in fact. The TMT is not being build on the summit. In fact the observatories are already in the zone that has the fewest historical sites, and these were build around.   So no sacred land is being violated. And its not like the astronomers are all ""fuck your culture, were building telescopes!"", the viewing conditions can`t be replicated anywhere else, Mauna Kea is one of the two best sites on the planet for ground-based astronomy.   Did these protesters not realize that the near-summit of Mauna Kea, where the telescopes are, was already being used as a site to observe astronomical phenomena for hundreds of years, by native Hawaiians?  I think they are misinformed and their heart and energy are awesome just directed at the wrong target.

AnarchistNews,3abc6t,fabchi,0,Fri Jun 19 01:59:01 2015 UTC,"A lot of this is arising from procedures of arrest as they come head to head up against reactions that may be rather emotional and have a lot of mayhem involved. Ultimately I think the police are reacting violently against disorganized behavior. One might even call it anarchic. This dimension of what might be called local, immediate anarchy is not explored very muchow by anarchists, as far as I can see. I'm not taking a position on it here; it can go various ways. It tends not to work very well in favor of those who are engaging in a strong emotional reaction, but even there, what might be called emotionalism seems to stand in opposition to a certain kind of  order. But it is a definite coping strategy, one I associate with black culture among others.  My position on it is utterly, one might even say sublimely, complex. To say the very least.   In terms of order, the problematic immediately involves a general problematic of anarchism: that it is ordinarily understood to have to do with rulers as such and not order as such. This is a tremendous failure of anarchism all over the place as far as I'm concerned. Whether you can have a lot of order without rulers I doubt but on the other hand anarchism as it is usually conceived amounts to a kind of tyranny of a particular kind of rule following person, and rule enforcement, as we know here, seems to amount to a kind of communism of a certain kind of a rule follower.   Those who use the mayhem strategy also have a tendency, oddly enough, to cleave to rulers; so you find a lot of might makes right and Big Daddy configurations in black culture. One of the strategies against that really is more mayhem, which can render Big Daddy a bit impotent. It also enforces the use of greater force, like the arrests here, which may end up playing against the cops, which is actually one of the purposes of the mayhem strategy. All of which is very infuriating to the cops, which is very interesting to think about. But then that does lead to a lot of backlash by the cops and so forth. The important issue here seems to me to be to view this as a struggle between order and disorder in certain ways. In this case I am tending to side with the people who were arrested, while I can see both sides. Change the stakes and it all gets very interesting and compelling.  It is very easy to see the outlines of a tyrant of order whose position against emotionalism is very corrupt. But the same can go for cultures of mayhem and emotional reaction. It then becomes a much more philosophical project of managing a Nietzschean multiplicity. Two moralities,  and no way to decide between them.  But for political reality. I say, side against the tyrant. Follow the blood,  screaming and children. Look for those who don't or won't develop solutions and humanity when, in comfort, they can."

The Zionist infiltration of Australian and Queensland politics, is not limited to granting TerrorGrüppe Kurzberg free passage.   One pillar of the local Jewish community Sam Doumany, who as Queensland Attorney General thru the 1970's and into the eighties, failed to adequately prosecute for the 1973 Whisky Au Go Go fire, that killed fifteen ppl.  Who rejected the advice of the Queensland Coroner, and decided Vince O'Dempsy and another man would not be prosecuted, for the disappearance and murder of a Brisbane mother and her two school age daughters, the wife and children of one Billy McCulken.  Who was due to say in court he torched another Brisbane nightspot, at the behest of one Inspector Tony Murphy of the Queensland Police, Doumany likewise decided that affair would not proceed!  Advice to the entire Australian political and legal establishment, and to the entire Brisbane Jewish community, is show cause why your silence on these and the following matters.  Should not make you culpable as fellow travelers with the guilty parties, thus liable to arrest, trial and prosecution on the same capital charges!  Katherine Schweitzer was murdered in Sydnet Au. just weeks after her story went world wide, says her family was deported from Budapest to Auschwitz in 1944, whence only she survived out of fourteen, by another Jew was living a few doors up in Sydney, George Soros is believed to have been involved!

If you wish to be a truly pure Jain you end up starving yourself to death out of a reluctance to do any harm to any other living being. People can't live on salt alone. Out of millions of Jains at any one time there are only a few dozen going this route in India. It's basically unheard of in the diaspora. The greatest and most obvious reason why Jainism still exists is simply that at all times and places 99.9999% of the population will always choose to be 'impure'. Seems to me they make the sensible choice."

AnarchistNews,38c1vj,Potss,1 point,Wed Jun 3 22:16:42 2015 UTC,"Yes it was meant for you, even though you weren't the first accuser. If you weren't merely trying to clarify the original accusation then claiming that ""they do not apply their supposed values to their on lives"" is more than an allusion to purity. It is a direct implication/statement that the person who wants the amplifiers isn't ""pure"" because he wants said consumer good. If you say he is ""hypocritical"" you are applying a standard of judgement that judges his ""purity"" in relation to either his views, the views you think he holds or perhaps the views you think he should hold.  I don't know how many thousands (perhaps tens of thousands) of times I have heard similar accusations of hypocrisy/impurity leveled by leftists over the decades. Sometimes it sticks to the target. Usually it doesn't. It hardly ever sticks in the case of consumer goods. The only way it could be properly defined as hypocrisy would be if the target consistently demanded some renunciation of consumer goods from others. In such a case he would be ""hypocritical"" because he was impure himself.  In actuality it makes no difference whatsoever to the wider world if the target gets his amplifiers or not. His act of 'impurity/immorality' has no demonstrable physical consequence. If he doesn't buy the amplifiers someone else will. End of story. The only standard of judgement is about his personal character/purity. That is judgement of his purity or lack thereof. If he was doing something that had a real physical effect, such as being a boss then the accusation would have had a base in reality.  Once more, if you were merely explaining the original accusation I stand corrected. If you were supporting it then see above..."

That however isn't the point.  The point is that these individuals are not even conscious of these concerns, even though their ideologies would have them be if they applied it to their own lives.

And although Zinn has had a great influence on my personal philosophy, it pales in comparison to Chomsky's. I discovered anarchist thought because of Chomsky; before him, all I knew was that I never quite felt comfortable identifying with either the ""left"" (Democrats) or the ""right"" (Republicans) here in the United States. But I did know that something was wrong with the world, and it was Chomsky who initially opened up my eyes and revealed the nature of power and authority. Because of him, I went on to study the radical left and found that I was not so strange for questioning authority - that it was not just in my nature, but that it was a positive trait.  I'm getting sad just thinking about Chomsky's age; I believe history will look back on him as one of humanity's greatest assets that was never fully appreciated in his time. He is a singularly unique individual."

He presents revolution as a taking over of power and on the other side talks about the Native American ability to survive. Resistance has been a key component of anti-colonialism and can be seen all around the world and throughout history. It's been part of the indigenous struggle against the colonialists and early American settlers, the Spanish, and others. It can bee seen in the Mohawk resistance in Oka in 1990, the Rojava revolution, and in the Zapatistas.  I agree with his criticism of industrialism, and given the time of writing (1980), I could see why he'd think such in light of the manifestations Marxism took at the time. However, to discredit Marxism entirely is unfortunate. You could argue that Marxist industrialism was a means of offering a realistic resistance against the force wielded by the capitalist.  What I think serves as a counter-point to his argument, or rather something that adds to the conception of Marxism in this conversation, is what other indigenous struggles like the Zapatistas and the Kurds in Rojava have done with Marxism"
