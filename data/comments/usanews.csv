usanews,3dueqd,louis-wu,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:03:03 2015 UTC,Perhaps states should have the ability to negotiate prices for drugs and services in the same way other countries do?
usanews,3dueqd,daylily,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:26:05 2015 UTC,They already have that ability for what good it does them -- which is not a lot.  Costs for expanded Medicaid were very predictable and that is why many States refused to expand Medicaid.   But as to why we all have such outrageous costs for medicine it is only because our federal government allows it. Americans pay American drug manufacturers many times more than other countries pay those same companies for the same drugs. Our government even bans us from purchasing those drugs through pharmacies from other countries.   A simple law that drug manufacturers could not charge Americans more than their average cost world wide would fix the problem.  But it won't be fixed because our representatives owe the drug manufacturers for large campaign contributions.
usanews,3dueqd,daylily,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:26:14 2015 UTC,What really seems most unjust is the governments standing in the way of individuals making purchases from outside the country and having them shipped in. I don't understand why tarriffs on imported goods protecting millions of workers is bad but a tarriff  or law preventing an individual purchasing an inhaler from Canada is unfairly cutting into profits of a drug company.

usanews,3diwlm,Taviiiiii,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:41:47 2015 UTC,"Not just slow.  Many people wouldn't hear about it at all.  How would you get news?  Television and newspapers.  Some people didn't have either one.  Even those that had a tv wouldn't see the news unless they flipped to that channel, which might not happen on the family/community television.  So then you're left with word of mouth, but that's extremely unreliable and might not even be an option if the news isn't picked up by a major news outlet.  Now almost everyone in the US has a cellphone, and many of those have smartphones that have internet access and can provide those instant updates you mentioned.  Then there are tablets, portable computers, desktop computers, and ways to watch television on those without bunny ears or a cable television plan.  We are no longer restricted to learning about the news from major news outlets.  We can filter Twitter posts, visit specific news websites for small regions, go to region or event specific websites such as subreddits on this website.  While we have a lot available to us, I hate the lack of quality.

But I can hardly fault some person who objects to the crimes of our government and who is brave enough to try to provoke the apathetic American people to pay attention to our government's crimes and to counter-attack against our attacking military.

My mother in law lived in a neighborhood run by an HOA and was not allowed to put out any holiday decorations. No Halloween, Thanksgiving, or anything. No decorative plants, and deck furniture had to be of preapproved types.

usanews,3di9mv,GunnieGraves,2,Thu Jul 16 18:26:00 2015 UTC,"In this particular story, it starts off with the fact that 4 owners complained. After this happens, the Board has an obligation to enforce the rules. The news story spins the article as though the HOA is evil and doesn't want children to be happy. In reality, the Owners (parents) knew what their kid was intending to do and knew that he was going to do it in common area. His quote alluded to the fact that he was aware that this was against the rules. Those parents should have at least sent a heads up to the manager to see if they needed approval. The fact that 4 people complained in under 2 hours tells you that there is something more happening here.   I'm not disagreeing with you at all. A lot of board members are busybodies and bitchy turds. The thing is that those Board members have to protect the rights of the owners who don't want the lemonade stand. Since that rule is in the contract, that boy was infringing on his neighbor's rights to live in a lemonade free HOA.   This particular story seems like a good example of shooting the messenger."

So in the end legalizing it wont solve the problem because most people will still just buy it from someone else. Those farms will operate however that need to make themselves the most profitable. What WILL solve the problem is perhaps requiring pot and even other crops be grown in more sustainable methods. Right now they use all this water because they can and its cheap.

For example:   Let’s say we grant that it’s morally acceptable to smoke weed. Is it morally acceptable, then, to spark up a joint every day at lunch? Sure, as long as you’re not endangering others. It’s still not terribly wise, though.  If your unemployed roommate drifts through life perpetually stoned, you may resist telling him what he’s doing is morally wrong, but it is, in some sense, not OK. Does being a good and tolerant citizen mean you should shrug when a person chooses to spend his life wasted?   This is a fundamentally dishonest.  The question of whether marijuana use is morally acceptable is not the same thing as the question of whether being unemployed and dependent on others is morally acceptable.  Yet the author insists on conflating the two issues as if they are one and the same."

I've worked a wide variety of jobs to make ends meet sometimes three at once and being paid minimum wage sucks. It honestly feels like indentured servitude and the reality of the economy in America and the shrinking of old style blue collar jobs means we have to increase the wage if we want any kind of real buying power in the lower and middle class.

I would recommend checking out the military for those in that situation. They might be able to get in as officers with that otherwise useless bachelor's degree in communications or w/e they got. Another option is teaching in Asia. Korea is a great option for this. Also -- blue collar work does exist. I know people making great money in HVAC, landscaping, working in a copper plant, and working on power lines. Trade schools are typically free if you choose to go that route for high school. Many states offer them.   Before I was 16 I had numerous odd jobs, the steadiest one being paper boy which I started around 11 yrs old. While in high school I worked at Wendy's for 20-30 hours during the school year and full time during summer. During summers in college I would have a full time job and a part time job. During senior year in college I was worked 80+ hour weeks for a couple of months while in school. These jobs paid $10.50/hr and ~$11.50/hr with no degree required. After college I took what I could get, a $15/hr temp job at a large Pharmaceutical campus. A contact from that job gave me a recommendation for a full time job that I was applying for at a different company. The rest is history. ""Silver spoon""? Not really, in an American sense. In a global and historical sense sure, since this is an incredibly wealthy country with nearly limitless opportunities.

usanews,37ccji,His_Self,1 point,Wed May 27 11:34:37 2015 UTC,"Walmart does many things with its profit. Some of it is given to charity, some of it is given back to every employee in the form of the annual bonus, some of it is returned to share holders who then use that money for whatever purpose they desire, and some of it is used for investment in the company. This could mean more stores, investment in the DCs, or repayment of any debt the company might have."
usanews,37ccji,therealgillbates,1 point,Wed May 27 14:37:45 2015 UTC,"The point was that. No matter how much profit a company makes. A business is not going to hire more people than needed to get the job done. That also translates to a store is not going too under staff and try to run a store if they have to pay their employees more than slave wages. Example. Costco is only 2nd to Walmart is sales. Costco pays their employees $15.00 an hour plus benefits and they do just fine in profits, wages have not hampered Costco in anyway in opening up new stores.  So there it is. Why can Costco pay decent wages and Walmart cannot? Considering the Walton family has more money than the lower 85% of American families combined. I believe they can afford it."
usanews,37ccji,His_Self,1 point,Wed May 27 17:57:24 2015 UTC,"Costco is a completely different company with a very different model. People pay an annual membership fee to shop there, and most things are actually not bargains. I actually had a produce associate at Costco try to sell me on a 2 pound package of strawberries for $3.99 by telling me they're losing money on that and you can't beat that price. I told him I just bought strawberries for 99 cents per pound at Aldi. He had nothing to say to that. A few things are a good deal at Costco, but most things aren't. The Waltons have that money because of the success of the business. I see even though Walmart announced that it's voluntarily  raising its wages recently there's still all this hate for the company. If the employees are not happy with their wages at Walmart they can look for work elsewhere. Most employees at the Walmart I worked at loved the place. Other retail jobs in the area simply weren't as lucrative as Walmart, and the hours weren't always steady like they were in Walmart.  I started at $11.24 per hour to stock shelves at Walmart in summer 2003 and finished working there after Christmas 2004. When I wanted full time I had full time. Most others were full time and got full benefits.  Even as a seasonal employee I still got the annual bonus that came in around March. For entry-level retail work they're actually better than average. They were certainly better than my other retail job options at the time. It's also a very generous company, a driver of innovation, and a fairly green company as well. I know people like to hate on Walmart but they dislike it for the wrong reasons."
usanews,37ccji,His_Self,1 point,Wed May 27 18:05:34 2015 UTC,"Please explain how the business model is different. They are in direct competition with one another.  Also I have had a executive membership with Costco for more than a decade. I have yet to pay a dime in membership costs due to its 2% return on purchases. I've always got my membership cost back plus extra at the end of every year. Along with the higher quality items that they sell. with the no question return policy that they have and lower prices on most items than most retail establishments. Costco is a deal. But I'll tell you the one reason I despise Walmart. With the lower wages that they pay their employees, most employees qualify for government assistance. So what happens is ""I"", in my taxes, end up paying Walmart employees in the form of assistance because the company won't. And the Waltons, in the long run are putting my tax money in their pockets. So yes I guess you are correct, Walmart does have a different business model. Even though I don't shop there, they still end up getting my money. Seems somewhat dishonest to me.  It's also a shame it took a public outcry before they decided to up wages."

usanews,36ipnl,TheGhostOfTzvika,2,Tue May 19 18:03:08 2015 UTC,"From the article --  ' The Christian share of the U.S. population is declining, while the number of U.S. adults who do not identify with any organized religion is growing, according to an extensive new survey by the Pew Research Center. Moreover, these changes are taking place across the religious landscape, affecting all regions of the country and many demographic groups. While the drop in Christian affiliation is particularly pronounced among young adults, it is occurring among Americans of all ages. The same trends are seen among whites, blacks and Latinos; among both college graduates and adults with only a high school education; and among women as well as men.  ' To be sure, the United States remains home to more Christians than any other country in the world, and a large majority of Americans – roughly seven-in-ten – continue to identify with some branch of the Christian faith.1 But the major new survey of more than 35,000 Americans by the Pew Research Center finds that the percentage of adults (ages 18 and older) who describe themselves as Christians has dropped by nearly eight percentage points in just seven years, from 78.4% in an equally massive Pew Research survey in 2007 to 70.6% in 2014. Over the same period, the percentage of Americans who are religiously unaffiliated – describing themselves as atheist, agnostic or “nothing in particular” – has jumped more than six points, from 16.1% to 22.8%. And the share of Americans who identify with non-Christian faiths also has inched up, rising 1.2 percentage points, from 4.7% in 2007 to 5.9% in 2014. Growth has been especially great among Muslims and Hindus, albeit from a very low base. '    'Highlights' in the report:   ' Whites continue to be more likely than both blacks and Hispanics to identify as religiously unaffiliated; 24% of whites say they have no religion, compared with 20% of Hispanics and 18% of blacks. But the religiously unaffiliated have grown (and Christians have declined) as a share of the population within all three of these racial and ethnic groups. ' ' The percentage of college graduates who identify with Christianity has declined by nine percentage points since 2007 (from 73% to 64%). The Christian share of the population has declined by a similar amount among those with less than a college education (from 81% to 73%). Religious “nones” now constitute 24% of all college graduates (up from 17%) and 22% of those with less than a college degree (up from 16%). ' ' More than a quarter of men (27%) now describe themselves as religiously unaffiliated, up from 20% in 2007. Fewer women are religious “nones,” but the religiously unaffiliated are growing among women at about the same rate as among men. Nearly one-in-five women (19%) now describe themselves as religiously unaffiliated, up from 13% in 2007. ' ' As the ranks of the religiously unaffiliated continue to grow, they also describe themselves in increasingly secular terms. In 2007, 25% of the “nones” called themselves atheists or agnostics; 39% identified their religion as “nothing in particular” and also said that religion is “not too” or “not at all” important in their lives; and 36% identified their religion as “nothing in particular” while nevertheless saying that religion is either “very important” or “somewhat important” in their lives. ' ' While the mainline Protestant share of the population is significantly smaller today than it was in 2007, the evangelical Protestant share of the population has remained comparatively stable (ticking downward slightly from 26.3% to 25.4% of the population). As a result, evangelicals now constitute a clear majority (55%) of all U.S. Protestants. '  ' The share of the public identifying with religions other than Christianity has grown from 4.7% in 2007 to 5.9% in 2014. Gains were most pronounced among Muslims (who accounted for 0.4% of respondents in the 2007 Religious Landscape Study and 0.9% in 2014) and Hindus (0.4% in 2007 vs. 0.7% in 2014). ' ' Hindus and Jews continue to be the most highly educated religious traditions. Fully 77% of Hindus are college graduates, as are 59% of Jews (compared with 27% of all U.S. adults). These groups also have above-average household incomes. '"

Applying scrutiny to the Prophet Muhammad is not an act of “hurting” Muslims or causing them “humiliation.” Instead, it can actually lead Islam to a better place—one where the imagination of every writer, artist, and citizen can run free, without fear of violent retribution.   That brings to mind a certain play that's popular on Broadway and across the country, The Book of Mormon.

The FBI publishes reports, but police forces are not required to submit data. The incomplete FBI figures show that at least 461 people died in “justifiable homicides” in 2013, an increase of 33% since 2005. Other sources suggest the true number could be as high as twice that. In Britain, by contrast, police shot and killed precisely no one in 2013.  ' American police resort to violence more partly because they meet it more. “We’ve never had a population who are so well-armed,” points out Ron Teachman, the chief of police in South Bend, Indiana. Twenty-six police officers were killed with guns in the line of duty in 2013, far more than in any other rich country. “When you go to a police academy, the first thing they say to you is that it’s dangerous and you could get killed out there,” says Jim Bueermann, a retired police chief and the head of the Police Foundation, a think-tank.

Some try to shut down pot shops but that's because they don't want pot being sold at all, not because they disagree with the values of the owners. The left is in favor of the ACA, which is bad for small business. They also try to financially destroy small businesses that don't share their values. Look to Memories Pizza for an example.   The left undermines the military and wants to shrink the size of the military. Vietnam was a fruitless war because of the fruitcake left wing. Iraq was a victory until Obama ignored his predecessor's advice and his own advisers and completely abandoned Iraq and the power vacuum was filled by ISIS.  The right wing defends and celebrates the military. Those ""wounded warrior"" funds advertize on right wing media, and for good reason. Those folks are more likely to support them.   The whole ""black lives matter"" shit puts the narrative before the facts. The shooting in Ferguson was justified. It's too early to tell for sure about Baltimore but reports suggest that the guy they rioted over in Baltimore may have intentionally hurt himself.  See this poll.

That doesn't mean they don't want a efficient military to protects its people.   And you're having a strawman argument with the Ferguson and Baltimore situation as well as this poll. Just because you're cautious or apathetic towards police doesn't mean you think they're unnecessary or want to harm them. In fact, the poll you gave says ""Net Favorability"" of the police is high with both Dems and Republicans, 66% and 85% respectively.  The point is, its wrong to say the left hates those things."

It's not about the business, it's about the activism. The right is more hands-off, let business do their own thing. The left generally does not like small business, medium business, or large business. That's just a fact of life in the US.   Rand Paul is a lunatic. The military is necessary. As we have seen under Obama, when the US pulls back in the world bad people usually fill the power vacuum. The military needs to do more than just protect the homeland. It's here to defend our economic and strategic interests abroad. Without the US military the modern world economy would not be possible, at least how we know it.   It takes a degree of ignorance to support of the protests in Ferguson. 19% difference in net favorability is high.
