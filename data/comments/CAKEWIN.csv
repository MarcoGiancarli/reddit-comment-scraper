CAKEWIN,3dm9et,PoppetRock,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:21:22 2015 UTC,Do I just use aluminum foil? I'm totally self taught and don't quite know how to fancy up the cake boards :) Any advice would be great!
CAKEWIN,3dm9et,PoppetRock,3,Fri Jul 17 16:29:12 2015 UTC,"Same here! I'm very small time, so I feel you. Foil is a no, but one thing you can do is cover your board in coordinating fondant and wrap a ribbon around the corrugations. If you double up your cake circles, with the corrugations going opposite directions, you've pretty much made a cake drum, and you can find some great ribbon just wide enough to cover those sides.   What I do is use scrapbooking paper on top, ribbon on the sides, then cover the whole deal in cellophane. Super cheap, especially with coupons from the craft stores.   Check out the groups ""sugar geeks"" and ""Unruly bakers"" on Facebook; lot of really helpful people in there! Some of the really big names come through with tutorials and advice."

CAKEWIN,3dezt7,Nikki4321,2,Wed Jul 15 19:23:06 2015 UTC,Nice bouquet!  This might be a lame question...how on earth do you keep those cupcakes from falling off the bouquet? And even if the cupcakes stay won't the frosting slide right off? Color me thoroughly confused.
CAKEWIN,3dezt7,JustBarb,2,Wed Jul 15 22:54:15 2015 UTC,"In my experience if you allow the cupcake to completely cool and then frost it, the frosting acts like a glue and generally will stick to the cupcake once it's let sit for a bit.  As for the ball, I use a Styrofoam ball (cut in half).  I poke toothpicks (I found wood works best) 1/4 the way into the styrofoam ball and then place the cupcake on (if you're using a wrapper i pre-poke them.  After they bake I will use a metal skewer and make a hole in the middle)  Helps if you refrigerate the cupcakes a while before trying to make the boquet too."

CAKEWIN,3dezt7,JustBarb,2,Thu Jul 16 01:53:19 2015 UTC,"Hi! I'm glad you like them!  Here's the story. I made them from scratch so they were a little denser than box mix.    So!  I got a pot, filled it with rocks age hot glued a styrofoam ball to it.  Made cupcakes, and pinned the naked cakes to the ball with toothpicks.  The ones on the sides got 2,one at an angle, top and bottom ish. Then I took them all off, but the toothpicks stayed in the ball.  It looked like home decor for Hellraiser.  Then I base frosted all the cupcakes, airbrushed them green, put buttercream roses and leaves. First experiment failed when I put them back on the ball, they slid off. so when I did the ACTUAL cake,i decorated them, let them dry overnight so they cemented together, drove the wicked ball and cupcakes to the venue, then just stabbed them on the existing toothpicks!  Filled it in with green tissue paper squares and there you have it!! It was A HUGE success!"

For the modeling I used Renshaws Flower and Modeling Paste which was a pretty decent substituents for the normal half and half sugarpaste/flower paste I would use. I also tried Renshaws Covering Paste to cover instead of straight up Sugarpaste. It was abysmal and ripped under its own weight no matter how thick / thinly I rolled it. If anyone has been successful with it I'd appreciate your tips as I totally failed !

This is a cake for a friend's party to celebrate both Independence Day and his ""Wetting Down"" (a celebration of officer promotion in the Coast Guard).  The top tier is chocolate covered in buttercream, and the bottom tier is strawberry covered in a strawberry cream cheese frosting.  Only the decorations are fondant.  The flag and fireworks are made of a 50/50 mix of fondant and gumpaste.  I'm definitely more proficient with covering cakes in fondant, so I was a little nervous about these just being smoothed buttercream and cream cheese.  Not my best work, but I was pretty happy with the result!  Edit Oh, about the decorations.  The blue and silver bars on the red stripes are his new collar device after his promotion, and the crossed anchors are his CG specialty symbol."

The easiest way to get a professional looking cake is to start buying fondant, that simple. Fondyx is by far the best IMNSHO, but satin ice is more of an industry standard.  Now if you're not ready to bite that expensive bullet and want to stick to making your own there are still a few things you can do:   Wear gloves as often as possible to help keep the heat from your hands from melting the fondant.   Add Tylose to your fondant recipe to stiffen it up. A little goes a long way!  Try a different fondant recipe. I don't have one off hand but I'm sure someone else here does!   Make sure your work and storage conditions are ideal. Keep the ac and fridge cool, don't over knead your fondant before use, etc.  Use barriers between your hands and the fondant as often as possible. Use fondant paddles instead of your hands, gloves, viva paper towels, acetate, etc.  Just a few quick tips off the top of my head! Feel free to ask any more questions! :D"

To get the imprint on the 5 and the side of the cake, I used an imprint mat.   To get the impression onto the buttercream, I put it in the fridge to harden up and then dusted the mat with some powdered sugar.

CAKEWIN,3ap3rq,zenbuffy,1 point,Mon Jun 22 10:24:01 2015 UTC,"Some (sadly not very good) photos of a 21st cake I made over the weekend. The inside is chocolate biscuit cake, and this was the first time I ever carved up chocolate biscuit cake into a shape, and combined multiple pieces to make a larger cake.  The cake itself was pretty big, that's an 18"" x 30"" board it's sitting on, and it was modelled on a bass guitar which is owned by the recipient.  Unfortunately, I had a migraine all through finishing and photographing this cake, so the pictures are terrible. I didn't realise that the blurriness in the pictures wasn't just my eyes acting up as a result of the migraine! So, lesson learned - I need to learn better ways to photograph large cakes, and cakes with bold, contrasting colours (like black and white) without having awful blurry results.  Still, despite the trouble with my head, and the sub-par photos, I'm proud of the results here. I'm still a cake novice, so every time I stretch myself with a more difficult cake, I try new things and learn new skills. I had read tips on working with black fondant, and also on getting a lasting sheen on the fondant (which worked better than a matt appearance for the guitar) and I was glad to put those into practice.   It was also interesting to try my hand at shaping and carving up chocolate biscuit cake. I can see how I'd improve here too, perhaps by inserting cardboard supports or similar into my baking tins to have less waste after carving (although I cut up the leftovers into chunks, and used them as mix-ins in some homemade icecream, so that wasn't really a waste!).  Onward and upward, I think this is maybe my 5th or 6th cake, and my 3rd paid cake, so I've still got absolutely loads to learn!"

I picked up some blue colored fondant, some white fondant, some snow-flake cutouts and went to town.  First time ever using fondant and it was really hard out of the box.   Steamed it all once done and used some crystal sugar for 'snow'.  I should have made more buttercream icing to do a bottom trim but this was all about learning.  This was for her family party and her kids party was coming up and I'd need to make 2 cakes for that.  Family thinks it turned out great but as everyone else knows, the fondant was just peeled off as no one liked it.  Decided to try MMF for my next cake and a different buttercream recipe.

Work FAST and be careful not to do it too vigorously because the heat from your hands will make the icing sweat. Good luck :)

Since I wanted to try out MMF, I figured I may as well give it a test run.  The MMF didn't roll out thin enough for my liking.  The family liked this fondant much better over the store bought one but still said it was too thick.  I found that it bounced back a bit after being rolled out to 1/8"" and almost ended up being 3/16"" instead.  For my next one I'm going to roll it 1/16"" to see if that helps.

I did start out with a dark grey (The photos they look blue, but they were actually grey in color D:) and kept adding more and more buttercream, except for the one single black rose and the white roses.  It was a pain as the more colored gel I added, the softer the roses would be. I had to make 4, freeze them, put them on a tray and repeat.

CAKEWIN,37u5do,Lumos309,1 point,Sat May 30 12:23:42 2015 UTC,"Chives look pretty much like grass - well, the young plants, anyway - but I'd advise not to eat chives with a sweet cake. Also: if you do decide to use chives or something similar (in a planting pot), then please make sure to put something under the cake, so it doesn't touch the soil.  I think you can obtain a fairly even smooth spherical shape with just icing, but it takes a bit of work and practice. You could try piping smaller spheres on a plate for practice beforehand, so you can scrape the icing up and use it for the real cake (or try another sphere) afterwards.   You have to think about the consistency of the icing, too. If your icing is very soft (and is something that doesn't get more solid in a fridge), it's not going to hold the shape very well."
CAKEWIN,37u5do,wivella,1 point,Sat May 30 13:05:09 2015 UTC,"please make sure to put something under the cake, so it doesn't touch the soil   I was thinking of making a simple, edible, dark-coloured base (perhaps the offcuts of the main cake as I plan on making a chocolate one) instead of actual soil.   You have to think about the consistency of the icing, too. If your icing is very soft (and is something that doesn't get more solid in a fridge), it's not going to hold the shape very well.   I'm probably going for a basic buttercream frosting, This should work as long as I keep it cool throughout shaping and transport, right?"
CAKEWIN,37u5do,wivella,1 point,Sat May 30 13:14:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think buttercream would work well.  Oh, so you're making the grass on top of another cake. Well, in that case it's probably kind of hard to use actual grass.   You could maybe try to make each grass blade of coloured marzipan, though that would most likely take lots of effort. Or maybe make dandelion leaves or... I don't know. Some star tips can make pretty tall peaks, too. Or maybe just use a very small round tip and a fairly stiff frosting to make short ""grass"" (because anything taller than ~1 cm/0,4 in would probably just collapse).   And apparently there are special tips (#1, #2) meant for piping grass-like things. Who knew. (I certainly didn't - until I looked it up ~5 minutes ago!)"
CAKEWIN,37u5do,bakingNerd,2,Sat May 30 13:58:56 2015 UTC,"Hmm, making individual blades of grass out of marzipan is way too time consuming. Then again it just dawned on me that making strands one by one is the only way to get realistic looking grass... so never mind. Star tips it is.  And somehow I don't find the special tip ""grass"" that beautiful... it just looks like a mess to me.  Thanks for your help!"
CAKEWIN,37u5do,snowbie,1 point,Sat May 30 14:28:24 2015 UTC,"For the smooth finish, find a recipe for a ""crusting"" buttercream. Basically you smooth it out best you can (and quickly!). Then let it sit for a bit and a crust will form over the buttercream so it's no longer sticky to touch.   Once it is at this stage take a paper towel with no pattern (I use VIVA) and place it over the section of frosting you want to smooth over. Apply light pressure back and forth to smooth it over and take a look. Just a warning that too heavy pressure will break the crust and the frosting will stick to the paper towel - after the first section you'll get the hang of how much pressure is enough.   For the grass I've only used the tips, but I suppose you could order off Amazon some of that edible grass used for Easter baskets and try something with that?  A little bit of edible powder or spray color could make it look more realistic."
CAKEWIN,37u5do,bakingNerd,1 point,Sat May 30 14:50:43 2015 UTC,"Thanks- I had never heard of crusting buttercream before. I'll definitely consider it. A common theme among the recipes that I found is that the buttercream is super sweet, but one website says that the large amount of sugar is key to getting the crust. Do you think that the buttercream will still turn out right if I reduce the amount of sugar used?"
CAKEWIN,37u5do,sarahaasis,1 point,Sat May 30 15:05:55 2015 UTC,high sugar to fat ratio is what you need to make it crust. lower sugar to fat ratio is needed for making it smooth

CAKEWIN,36zfrg,wildtkl,2,Sat May 23 14:46:26 2015 UTC,"I agree. This is great work.   Here in Australia we often use chocolate ganache under the fondant. It sets up harder than buttercream which helps to stop the bulge. I use a stiff frosting too.   Make your fondant thicker. From the look of the edge it's about 1/8""? Go at least twice that and you'll find it much easier to smooth the corner.   Other than that, aesthetically I'd make the figures slightly larger. But now I'm getting totally picky.   This is awesome work. Please keep posting!"

CAKEWIN,36zfrg,sarahaasis,1 point,Sun May 24 08:36:44 2015 UTC,"Wilton instructor/ professional decorator here.  I didn't actually notice it until some of the other comments, but about the bulge in the center - the best thing I've found to avoid that is not to fill the center completely.  When you ice between the layers, leave a 1/4"" space around the edge.  Then when you stack the second layer, lightly push down on the top of the cake before you ice the outside (I like to use a greaseproof cake board held upside down for this, so you don't pull too many crumbs off).  The reason for the bulge is that as the cake settles, the filling is pushed out the sides.  I find that this method eliminates it completely, provided there isn't too much filling.  I hope this helps!  But, like I said, I didn't even notice that at first, your work is awesome!  One more thing:  on the ""1"" sign on the front, it looks like you used edible markers, correct?  I usually use a paintbrush and gel or powder colors mixed with lemon juice (as the juice evaporates it helps to dry your paint).  I would use a piece of cardstock (heavy paper) or a straight-sided scraper as a guide to make nice, even lines.    Omg those figurines are perfect though.  The cake is awesome, and only other professionals will pick up on the teeny little imperfections.  This is fantastic work, I hope you plan to pursue decorating as a career!  I have a decorating business from home, so if you're in the US, I may be able to answer some questions about obtaining a business license, if you're interested.  Keep it up!"

CAKEWIN,36m94f,zenbuffy,1 point,Wed May 20 12:38:06 2015 UTC,"This is my fifth large fondant project, and my second ever cake order, for a birthday boy who is really into online trading.    A pretty fun challenge, trying to figure out how I'd get my laptop to stand up without the screen falling over, and how I could support something so heavy, but I'm happy with how it turned out. (I solved the ""support the screen"" problem by using three cake pop sticks which go up through the screen and down into the cake. They served both to secure the laptop on the top of the cake, and stop the screen from flopping over!) A good learning experience for me this time, working with supports and all that. Black fondant remains an interesting, finger-staining thing to play with, and I'm loving adding on details with edible food paint and colours."
CAKEWIN,36m94f,Beepolai,1 point,Wed May 20 12:42:39 2015 UTC,"Just a comment on supports:  try using bamboo skewers, or for heavier jobs, wooden dowel rods, sharpened at one end (a regular pencil sharpener will do the trick). Then if you use several cardboard cake boards, stacked, taped together and covered (in foil or fondant), you can actually stick the dowels through the board itself for a really strong support structure.  Looks great, BTW!"

I try not to handle it too much but it only takes a couple of seconds of kneading before it seems almost too soft to work with.  Do you have any suggestions?

I always wanted to learn how to do petit fours and blowing sugar and such :D
CAKEWIN,359o05,deedlezx,1 point,Fri May 8 23:59:07 2015 UTC,"As far as school goes, I think it's a great idea. It was the best decision I ever made, and I just LOVED the classes. But don't feel that you need a degree. You don't. A lot of community colleges offer certificates, or you could just take a class here and there. I do recommend taking your basic culinary class along with in pastry classes. In pastry, a lot of cooking methods cross over with pastry. Also brushing up on knife skills will make your finished dessert look cleaner and more put together. I know it's hard to go back to school as an adult with a full time job. Just know that you don't need a diploma. A lot of places will hire you based on your decorating skill and the pastry classes you have taken.  Petit fours are cut out of a sheet cake. If you want layers and filling, you just torte ( cut a cake in half to fill it) it and fill it will your choice of jam, then cut the shapes out with your choice of cutters. They are traditionally glazed with icing fondant, which is a very involved process. I used to have a picture of me working it on a marble slab, but I lost it on my old phone. :(   You would also be surprised with what you can learn on youtube as well. And also your piping is beautiful."

If I was going to nit pick I'd say it's a shame that the sides aren't perfectly square. Like there is some overhang. Also covering the cake board is the easiest way to take your cake to the next level.

CAKEWIN,353dt9,JeronixUK,6,Wed May 6 19:42:55 2015 UTC,"Not a pro but I've put fondant on tons of cakes (hundreds at this point). I've used MM fondant, Wilton, Fat Daddy and currently prefer Satin Ice. I really don't think choice of fondant is the issue.  The problem is when and where you trim the icing off. In ""crazy style"" cakes this is naturally harder because the top of the cake is wider than the bottom.   The trick is to use the smoother or your hands(by pressing and wiping and pressing)  to slightly stretch the fondant down. The idea is to get the wrinkly/foldy part down past the bottom edge of the cake. I find this is easier to do if I put the cake on a large can or cylinder that raises the edges from the counter.  Then trim it with a knife or pizza wheel slicer. I like to trim just shy of the bottom because the fondant is still moving ever so slowly, tends to prevent bulges. I hardly ever have folds at the bottom following this."
CAKEWIN,353dt9,shadeofmyheart,3,Wed May 6 21:37:09 2015 UTC,I'm referring to the small folds
CAKEWIN,353dt9,LovelyRage,3,Wed May 6 19:43:41 2015 UTC,"The fondant will be more likely to fold the thinner it gets. Keep it thick. Fondant is meant to stretch and spread which means covering a cake that has a narrower base is going to take some practice.   When you roll out your fondant, leave the edges noticeably thicker than then center (1/4"" difference as a guess) then also keep the rollout smaller than what you would size for a standard shape cake.   Let's say you're covering an 8"" round 2 tier layer, that would mean roughly a 15"" diameter rollout. But since you have a smaller base, you're roll out should equal the size difference between the top and base of the cake. 8"" across the top, 6"" base = a 2"" difference. So instead of 15"" diameter, you're rollout should be 13"" WITH the thick edges. (edit: Fixed a number or two)  The center will still stretch to cover, since your whole rollout is thick, but the edges will be more likely to compress than fold. But that's where the practice comes in.   I don't know how to type an explanation for it, but I work the thick edges inward while smoothing the excess... Upwards. If it stretches down, it thins, then folds. If you work it in and upward, you should be able to get it to take shape. But make sure your cake is hard!! Or else it'll just be mushy and will leave stretched spots in your fondant which is no buena."
CAKEWIN,353dt9,LovelyRage,2,Wed May 6 21:40:14 2015 UTC,"What kind of fondant are you using?  Do you trim/shape your cakes after you stack them?   Do you frost your cake or do you put the fondant on bare?  Do you freeze your cakes after baking, before decorating, so that they are more firm?"
CAKEWIN,353dt9,barristonsmellme,2,Wed May 6 20:00:29 2015 UTC,Ready to roll stuff not sure what more information you need sorry   No I don't stack before I trim  Yes I put frosting on before icing  And no I don't freeze then
CAKEWIN,353dt9,Jenniflower1234,1 point,Wed May 6 20:02:44 2015 UTC,Did you put the icing on the cake after you put the top tier on? the bottom tier looks great so I thought it may be that.
CAKEWIN,353dt9,Caffeinated_Caker,-1,Wed May 6 20:39:24 2015 UTC,"The fondant you're using is the issue. The ready to roll stuff has no elasticity. Check out this tutorial: http://artisancakecompany.com/recipe/the-best-marshmallow-fondant-recipe-ever/ You'll never go back. It the best recepie ever and works out to be way cheaper. Also, grab one of the Wilton fondant smoothers. It'll help make it all look better."
CAKEWIN,353dt9,muchtea,3,Wed May 6 20:37:37 2015 UTC,There are plenty of great quality ready to roll fondants. My preference is satin ice. I've converted many people who thought they hated fondant to loving it. The problem here is most likely inexperience in covering cakes. I recommend some youtube videos and lots of practice. Here's a nice tutorial.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oAfNAG4dw4  You really just have to get the feel for it.
CAKEWIN,353dt9,Montrealgirl,1 point,Wed May 6 22:10:02 2015 UTC,"Not an expert by any stretch of the imagination but I think that fondant will mould to the shape underneath but only if it's very slowly done - if you use a fondant smoother starting from the top, going over the edges then down to the sides in a smoothing motion. It's difficult to describe on text but this is the video I learnt it from: http://youtu.be/Q9iquCQGFKU. Having said that I still end up with folds 8 times out of 10 so I sympathise!"
CAKEWIN,353dt9,jyauu,1 point,Wed May 6 20:42:07 2015 UTC,"From the looks of it, in my opinion, you need to refrigerate your cake a little longer before covering it with fondant, Once it is hard you can start spreading and stretching the fondant over the cake, flatten out sides using a palette, then use the none-sharp part of the knife to outline the base of the cake, and then cut it with a clean knife. you shouldn't have any problems! Hope it helps!"

The only thing i would say to improve that, is less frosting, by that i mean if you only do enough frosting that it sicks out rather than droops down it gives a more effective fur texture. Also with the sully figure, if you wanted a fur effect use a toothpick to rough up the fondant.  But honestly its great just as it is."

CAKEWIN,33jl8j,_aubaub,2,Thu Apr 23 01:12:08 2015 UTC,I got my first job decorating cakes in 08 by walking into Sam's club and straight up asking for a job because I was hard working and willing to learn. They hired me. That is the best way to learn. The only way to get good at cake is to do it over and over again. It took me months to get my roses looking like I wanted them to. And that involved  me leaving work and going home and practicing in front of the tv for a few hours. Then going back in the next morning and doing it all over again. Congratulations on your job. This cake looks great and you'll only get better from here. Remember that every cake decorator you meet will show you a new different way of doing things. Watch and learn and practice!
CAKEWIN,33jl8j,Caffeinated_Caker,1 point,Thu Apr 23 01:55:44 2015 UTC,Thank you!!  I have definitely grown to love it so much.  I still need to get roses down but practice makes perfect!

Also, along with what /u/Caffeinated_Caker said...I would try watching Youtube. Oddly enough, it helps a lot! Look up Liz Larson as she's a favorite of mine.  Great job btw!"
CAKEWIN,33jl8j,ka_hime,1 point,Fri May 8 07:02:31 2015 UTC,Yes!  I did a Big Hero 6 cake and the kid's excitement was the BEST part.  It fills me with joy.    Thank you! :)

CAKEWIN,33cgcr,yrddog,3,Tue Apr 21 13:39:56 2015 UTC,I recall a disasterous cake I made for a family member's birthday some years back. I wish I'd taken the result with this sort of attitude and at least had a bit of a laugh. Nope! What did I do? I picked the goddamned thing up in my bare hands and smashed it into the nearest bin. Declaring myself done.
CAKEWIN,33cgcr,Dtapped,3,Tue Apr 21 18:02:28 2015 UTC,The funny thing about cake disasters is that there's still opportunity to make it such that people simply will not care what it looks like because they know it's going to be delicious.  And that's what you did.  Cover it with candy and crisis averted!  I am a professional cake decorator and I'd rather eat your creation than mine any day.
CAKEWIN,33cgcr,Caladriel,2,Wed Apr 22 03:04:33 2015 UTC,"My first real attempt at making a proper cake went... not well, I didn't wait long enough to start moving bits around and it just fell apart when I put the icing on.  what did I do? (after shouting For fuck's sake!) - I chucked some glitter on it and we ate it anyway and it was the best goddamn cake I've ever eaten, in fact, thanks to the way it fell apart the cake was infused with the delicious icing  Sometimes disaster is fantastic"

The tips just kept bursting out.   The top border was meant to be an elegant shell shape. Instead, it looks like shoddily arranged turds. And I ran out of icing for the top border, so I had the brilliant idea to add two little purple turds to finish it off. Beautiful.  The only part that I like (aside from the taste) is the flowers. They still look shitty, but not as shitty as the rest of the cake. I made some extremely thick, pliable buttercream and shaped them (I have a rose petal tip, but like I said, that wasn't working out).  This was... for my mom's birthday. I'm so sorry, Mom."

CAKEWIN,2zwozy,Shortkaik,1 point,Mon Mar 23 04:25:08 2015 UTC,"I've also found a couple of ways to get them to work better, in addition to putting some corn starch on them:     Allow the strip of fondant to dry out a minute or so before applying the cutter. Use a combo of fondant & gum paste, it will be strong and less likely to tear. Once you've got it in the cutter, stick the cutter in the freezer for a couple of minutes before trying to get them out. Use a needle or tip of an exacto knife to pry the corners out to give it a start before tapping.   They can be fussy and time consuming but the resulting letters look great!"

For flesh tones, I thin down food coloring with a LOT of vodka, and spatter reds, blues, browns and yellows all over the skin with a chip brush. I cut the bristles down so I have better control. You can do the same thing with the airbrush, like you mentioned. I just prefer a chip brush. Then I deepen the wrinkles with red, blue and brown airbrush color. The shading is mostly done in browns and reds. Since he has freckles, I finished it with a darker reddish brown spatter."

CAKEWIN,2yeqth,imakethingsgoboom,2,Mon Mar 9 04:16:15 2015 UTC,"Freeze the cake and then cut it while it's frozen. If you don't have freezer space, at least refrigerate it for a couple hours to firm up the cake. After torting the cake, if you notice the top layer is still too delicate to pick up with your hands, use a cake board or any stiff piece of cardboard (that is the same size or larger than the cake) to slide it in between the layers, then lift and remove. Leave the top layer on your board until you have iced the bottom layer. Using the board, slide the top layer off onto your frosted cake. Good luck!"
CAKEWIN,2yeqth,PM_ME_JOY,2,Mon Mar 9 09:49:49 2015 UTC,Thank you for your help! I wasn't able to freeze it but it had already been in the fridge overnight. I managed to find a piece of cardboard large enough to hold the cake and from there it was much easier than I thought it would be. I did forget to put dowels and cardboard in between the tiers though so I had to pull the top two layers off and start again when I saw them starting to sink into the cake.  Surprisingly though everything turned out much better than I expected. This was by far the largest cake I ever made and only my second time using fondant. What a blast!   Thanks again. :)
CAKEWIN,2y94ra,NotYourCakeBitch,1 point,Sat Mar 7 17:06:54 2015 UTC,My black fondant and black icing always turn out bitter and gross. Almost as if a pen exploded in your mouth. Even if I start with chocolate flavoured fondant or icing.... How did yours turn out?

CAKEWIN,2xn41p,lalalava,1 point,Mon Mar 2 05:33:30 2015 UTC,"Hi all! Here's my overview for the 3rd level of the new Wilton Course classes. I'm not sure what was in the old one, but this course concentrated on gum paste and fondant - my first time working with them! It was very different working with these versus buttercream or royal icing -- it felt just like clay! But you had to be very careful about keeping particles out of the fondant and avoiding cracks. What we learned:  Lesson 1 -- Mixing / coloring fondant and gum paste, basics (powdering and greasing). Making strips (and bows, quilling, and ribbons from them), flower bases, and leaves  Lesson 2 -- Calla Lilly, rose and bud  Lesson 3 -- Carnation, daisy, ruffle, and chrysanthemum  Lesson 4 -- Covering a cake in fondant, borders, overlays and inlays, fondant painting  I enjoyed this class and the stencils you get are really useful! You only have to make a cake for the final lesson. While what you make is pretty, it's not as edible as buttercream. This gets closer to wedding-cake level flowers though. I recently finished Course 4 too, so expect a post about that soon as well. Let me know if you have any questions!"

It was very similar, except the bows were made with wider, shorter loops, and there was no quilling or painting.  They left out a few smaller, easier projects to make room for some of the more interesting techniques.  I'm the most excited about fondant painting; it's just nice to have a change of pace and really get ""artsy"" with it.  Most of the products are largely the same, the only difference is they're purple now.  :/  I do love the new ribbon cutter, it beats the pants off the original design.

I did roll it reasonably thin, but I could probably go thinner with more practice, and I intend to be doing lots more practice :)  I showed it to some friends, and they mentioned a ""finish"" around the bottom too. You're right, needs something around the bottom, a border of some sort. I didn't really realise til I stepped back and looked at it, but that definitely would have made it look a bit more finished.

It brings a very high level of consistency from batch to batch.  And at least from the business side of things, it keeps labor cost down since there's no extra time spent measuring out dry ingredients.  It should also be mentioned that out of those 5 bakeries, only one didn't freeze their cakes after baking.  And that was only because it was a shit-show of a bakery that under-charged, under-paid and only had a single deep freezer.  They also had the driest cake I've ever worked with."

CAKEWIN,2wcoji,mrs_doorknob,4,Wed Feb 18 20:48:06 2015 UTC,"I was a little belated with my Valentine’s cupcakes this year, but here they are. I made hazelnut praline ganache, angel food cupcake, and lemon pomegranate cupcakes.   The hazelnut praline ganache cupcake recipe can be found here. I used a different buttercream, as I was too short on time and too impatient to do a Swiss meringue buttercream. I used my base buttercream recipe, as seen below, and then I added ½ cup of Nutella to it. As for decoration, I used a Wilton 2D tip to pipe and then used dark chocolate hearts that I made in a mold and dusted them with bronze luster dust.   The angel food cupcake recipe can be found here. Due to my desire for my cupcakes to last longer and be more stable, I scratched the cream cheese whipped cream topping and opted for Dream whip. For the dream whip frosting I used 2 packets of Dream Whip, 1 cup of whipping cream, and 1tsp of vanilla, whipping on medium speed for 3-4 minutes. I used a Wilton 2A to pipe the frosting and made chocolate covered strawberries to top them with. For tips on chocolate covered strawberries of various designs, visit here.   The lemon pomegranate cupcake recipe can be found here. For the buttercream I used my base recipe, subtracted the whipping cream and ½ of the vanilla, and then added the ½ cup of pomegranate juice specified in the original recipe (make sure to follow the directions and reduce the pomegranate juice by ½). I used a Wilton 125 tip to pipe the roses, you can look here for more tips on how to pipe buttercream roses.   Base buttercream recipe (enough to frost 2 dozen cupcakes)  Ingredients   2c unsalted butter, room temp 6c sifted powdered sugar 3 tsp vanilla extract 1/2 tsp salt 1 tbsp heavy cream   Instructions    Beat butter on medium until fluffy with paddle attachment  Reduce speed to low, add sugar slowly until sugar is moistened  Continue to mix at med-high speed until well combined  Add vanilla extract, salt & heavy cream  Continue to beat frosting 3-5 minutes until blended and smooth  Add more cream if too thick"

CAKEWIN,2w48a4,infiniteloooop,2,Tue Feb 17 04:15:28 2015 UTC,Yeah store bought icing isn't the greatest for piping. I make my icing by hand. It's a American buttercream in these pictures and it's super easy to make if you have a few moments.   2 Sticks of softened unsalted butter  2 1/2 cups of confectioner sugar  1 tablespoon of flavoring of your choice   Simply cream the butter and slowly add in the sugar and when it's well combined add in your flavoring. (If it seems a little too thick go ahead and add a bit of milk.) Though this is a recipe I loosely follow because depending on what flavors I'm going for.
CAKEWIN,2w48a4,infiniteloooop,2,Tue Feb 17 05:07:51 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much! I've been putting off practicing because of my terrible icing choices, hah. Last question, does it need to stay chilled while using it in order to make sure it'll retain the piped shapes? Or does the ingredients alone make sure it's a stronger icing for piping?  Again, thank you. Saved your comment for when I mess around with piping in the future!"
CAKEWIN,2w48a4,infiniteloooop,2,Tue Feb 17 15:58:55 2015 UTC,No problem! And the answer to that question is nope. American buttercream doesn't need to stay chilled for quite a bit and will hold its shape when it's the right consistency. Though if your kitchen is hot your buttercream will start to soften and may not hold its shape well. So be aware of the temperature of your kitchen when you want to practice piping! If it does start to soften a couple minutes in the fridge should put it right back to where you want it!

Take it out, wipe it on a paper towel then smooth my icing. It takes quite a bit more time, but the heat of the spatula blade makes the buttercream soften just enough to glide over & smooth it out.   I've usually had my cake in the fridge for 20 minutes to firm up the buttercream beforehand.  I've also crumb coated heavily & smoothed that out, let it set up in the fridge for 20 minutes then melted another batch of buttercream to where it's just pourable but not hot enough to melt the crumb coat, then poured buttercream over the entire cake. Takes less time, but a little more risk as you might not end up with it all over the sides, etc.  Trial & error."

CAKEWIN,2vcvy1,ours_de_sucre,3,Tue Feb 10 00:37:56 2015 UTC,"Probably a combination of gravity and humidity. Fondant stretches easily. Might also be down to how you stuck it on. Buttercream isn't superglue, and if it got warm, it probably couldn't hold the fondant in place"
CAKEWIN,2vcvy1,LittleBitOdd,2,Tue Feb 10 02:07:50 2015 UTC,"Could be humidity, and/or the consistency of your buttercream. If your buttercream is too soupy, it can shift or bubble up in places, moving your fondant with it"
CAKEWIN,2vcvy1,missingno__,1 point,Tue Feb 10 03:47:56 2015 UTC,"No idea without pics, but here in Australia where it can get hot, we often use ganache rather than buttercream under fondant. It's possible your buttercream softened under the fondant if it was warm."
CAKEWIN,2vcvy1,lessnonymous,1 point,Tue Feb 10 09:16:52 2015 UTC,Did you put the cake in the fridge after you covered it in fondant?
CAKEWIN,2vcvy1,Fortunekitty,1 point,Tue Feb 10 13:20:27 2015 UTC,"I've found this to happen to me when I use some buttercreams under fondant.  My favourite buttercream goes on so smoothly and is really tasty, but it's too soft for fondant - I've learned the hard way.  If I'm covering a cake, I tend to stick to ganache or something more solid like SMBC."
CAKEWIN,2vcvy1,Shortkaik,1 point,Tue Feb 10 15:53:14 2015 UTC,Thanks so much for the comments everyone. I think my buttercream got too soft and the humidity didn't help. I think next time I'm going to use ganache create a sturdier cake.

CAKEWIN,2v3kml,ayshasmysha,7,Sat Feb 7 16:05:13 2015 UTC,"As you asked, here's a couple of things I see immediately:  ""Paris 7"" needs a firmer/thicker/smoother crumb coat. Fondant will only be as smooth as its foundation - though you can fudge it a bit with thicker fondant.   The other criticism is nothing to do with the cake: it's the photography. Everything looks like it's taken with dull yellowish light and so all the colors have a yellow/green tone and look dull*. After you finish each cake take a well prepared photo.   Here's a ""How to photograph a cake"" tutorial I wrote.   You'll also notice that my best looking photos are taken on a black satin background. Black suits my brand, so you might want to go white or even have a few bright colors you can use. The last thing you want is to take the picture on the table at the party - unless the whole table is part of the setup and you can get good lighting.  * If your buttercream actually does come out with a yellowish tinge, add some purple. This will give you a much less noticeable neutral off-white."
CAKEWIN,2v3kml,RickMeasham,3,Sat Feb 7 20:31:16 2015 UTC,"I'm not the OP but thanks so much for the purple trick, I occassionally have the butter/yellow issue too."
CAKEWIN,2v3kml,spankdiazz,1 point,Sun Feb 8 00:39:22 2015 UTC,Thanks Rick for your feedback. Firstly that trick for getting white buttercream? Wow! My buttercream is yellowish because of the butter. I saw that Wilton had this whitener product but it looked so gross I just ruled that out. I even have that shade.  I noticed that too about the Frozen cake. The buttercream wasn't on there smooth enough which is annoying as I've actually done smoother cakes in the past but I had already posted that on this subreddit a few months ago.   My photography is awful! Thank-you for the tips. Mostly I need to invest in a camera and not use my phone for this. I really like the black satin look. Maybe I can get a yard of fabric and use that?  Thank-you for your feedback. I really appreciate it. :)
CAKEWIN,2v3kml,zenbuffy,1 point,Sat Feb 7 20:47:33 2015 UTC,"White buttercream from purple colouring? Amazing! I would never have thought of this, but wow, that really does make a difference.

CAKEWIN,2v3kml,mrs_doorknob,2,Sun Feb 22 21:42:38 2015 UTC,"One of the things that stood out to me is in regards to the body proportions to your figures. The torso to the Iron Man as well as both Elsa's are way too long. The legs should always be longer than the torso.

CAKEWIN,2u4q1o,kwacky-keeta,1 point,Fri Jan 30 10:58:16 2015 UTC,Actually it was quite easy and only took about 10-15min! I used a silicone mat and the gold and white cake lace paste. I was at a cake exhibition and heard that if you make a metallic colour such as gold or silver its always best to go over the mat a second time with a coating of the white cake lace and then bake again as this makes the final product more flexible. It peeled out of the mat so easily.

Your fondant is totally smooth and overall beautiful.   If I can offer a few tips (and feel free to disregard this part if you're not looking for any!), the belly button is a bit large and disproportional, and frankly kinda nipple like.  With the airbrushing it almost makes the tummy look like a boob! And the airbrushing on the top of the dress is a little uneven. Next time you may want to consider using a separate piece of fondant in the desired color  and use the belt to hide the seam.  But again, super great job! You've definitely mastered a lot of really tough skills, just maybe got a little airbrush happy. ;)"

The customer wanted certain things that I found to be the most unappealing about a pregnant belly. The line and that popped out belly button.  And since I've never been pregnant, that's what I recalled it looked like from memory. 😊.  It looked less boob like in person. And I have like 20 pics of it and all I see is a giant boob.   And the top, I completely agree.  For other reasons and time constraints, that was the best that I could do."

We charged the normal price we'd add to a cake for it, so like $6.   You're probably looking for one to buy for yourself though, and I know Bakery Craft sells a nice selection of them."
CAKEWIN,2rbid1,laurynelizabeth,3,Sun Jan 4 21:21:25 2015 UTC,The problem comes from the silly chips they put in the ink cartridges. Only Canon seem to have avoided it. With printing ink you get around it by refilling. But you can refill ink with food coloring. So it basically comes down to whether you can get food dye cartridges for whatever printer you're looking at buying.
CAKEWIN,2rbid1,lessnonymous,2,Mon Jan 5 10:00:12 2015 UTC,I have a feeling normal printers work fine as long as you have only ever put edible ink in them.
CAKEWIN,2rbid1,bakedNdelicious,6,Sun Jan 4 21:25:14 2015 UTC,"This. Unless it's for commercial use and it's going to be used heavily, a regular printer will work fine. Just buy one dedicated to edible image printing and only ever put edible image ink in it.  Source: The bakery I work at has a regular printer for edible images. We use it a lot, and it only jams/malfunctions occasionally."
CAKEWIN,2rbid1,PicklesMcGeezac,3,Sun Jan 4 23:51:50 2015 UTC,They are.  Just make sure you get the printer new and that it is a model compatible with the type of edible ink cartridges you want to use.  You'll also have to remember to adjust the paper thickness setting so you don't shred your edible image sheets.

CAKEWIN,2r4rpd,lalalava,2,Fri Jan 2 20:21:07 2015 UTC,"Hi all!  I finished the new Wilton Course 2 (they updated the courses sometime in the summer). Here's an overview of what the course is like if anyone is curious about taking it! Most of the description is in the album, but basically this is what you learn:  Lesson 1 - Making a parchment bag, Cornelli lace, brush embroidery, petal, blossom (all buttercream)  Lesson 2 - Royal icing, rosebud, half rose, Wilton rose. All in royal icing  Lesson 3 - Various flowers -- violet, pansy, lily, poinsettia. All in royal icing  Lesson 4 - basetweave (yay!!), reverse shell, rope, final cake! All in buttercream  This course is very different from Course 1 in that: 1) you only make any baked goods for the final lesson (a final cake), and 2) most of the class is in royal icing. Royal icing is fairly difficult to work with, so this class ended up being difficult! I'm not sure how it differs from the old course, except there is no intro to fondant / gum paste, which apparently existed in the old course. I really liked learning the flowers in this class and the basketweave is something I've always wanted to learn, but I wasn't a fan of having to use royal icing (sort of like a necessary evil -- good technique to know, but I probably won't use it again).  I'm starting Course 3 next week -- super excited! Let me know if you have any questions about Course 2.

CAKEWIN,2q0cj1,egregious_girl,3,Sun Dec 21 22:25:57 2014 UTC,Looks awesome.   Like stained glass. If that's the effect your were going for I'd suggest brushing thinned down clear piping gel or mirroir glaze on top to make it shiny.  Really nice work though.
CAKEWIN,2q0cj1,Angrybakersf,1 point,Sun Dec 21 23:39:09 2014 UTC,"Thank you! Yes, it is meant to be stained glass. I couldn't think of any way to make it shiny, this is the first cake I've decorated as an adult so don't know any pro techniques as yet."
CAKEWIN,2q0cj1,Angrybakersf,2,Sun Dec 21 23:51:30 2014 UTC,"Cool.  Yes, clear piping gel can be thinned down with water (or kirsch/vodka) then brushed on and it will shine nicely.  Also simply letting the cake sit in a fridge uncovered will usually cause it to get slightly wet.  Keep up the good work"

CAKEWIN,2oijq4,Kim1885,5,Sun Dec 7 02:29:32 2014 UTC,A smash cake is when you make a smaller cake for the kids to wreck in their high chair or whatever. It's meant to be 'smashed' with the kid having fun eating it. The other cake is the one to be sliced up for the adults and is commonly more decorative or more delicate/intricate.

Fill between the layers with whipped cream mixed with crushed oreos. Put more whipped cream/oreo mix on top and decorate with oreos. The above cake is even better if you incorporate a layer or 2 of crunchy meringue. This can be done by either baking a layer of meringue seperately, or what i like to do is put the chocolate batter into 2 pans, and then spread meringue over the batter. Bake it all together.  Put oreo halves at the bottom of your cupcake pan and bake chocolate cupcakes on top. Super easy ""ice cream pie"": Crush oreos and press into a crust shape. Fill with softened vanilla ice cream.

CAKEWIN,2nefr2,mrs_doorknob,3,Tue Nov 25 19:30:47 2014 UTC,"For the vanilla bean raspberry cupcakes I used this recipe (1) with a fresh raspberry filling (2). For the Oreo cupcakes I actually used two different recipes due to me needing a frosting that would last longer. The cupcake base was found here (3), I would suggest using single stuffed Oreos and filling a little over ¾ full, as mine didn’t rise well due to the excess oil from the double stuffed Oreo cookies. The frosting I used was modified from (1); I took out the vanilla bean and added 12 finely crushed Oreo cookie tops. I decorated both sets of cupcakes with dark chocolate candy melts in various molds and gave them the added sheen with bronze luster dust.

CAKEWIN,2nefr2,blckazn,2,Tue Nov 25 20:52:55 2014 UTC,"Thanks :) The first tip I would suggest is using a small amount of cooking spray in the molds and then dabbing it out. Next, make sure the chocolate melts are completely melted;this makes sure they fill the entire space before hardening as they tend to harden pretty fast. Third tip is to lightly tap the tray or drop it onto the counter about 1/2 inch a few times; this gets out all of the extra bubbles trapped in the chocolate.  My first batch was not so pretty, but the changes I made helped a lot."

CAKEWIN,2n5l75,jammydodd,2,Sun Nov 23 09:05:39 2014 UTC,"How big does it need to be? I think you can use three square cakes (2x8"" and a 10"" for the middle?) for the body and carve it so it has that shape. One 8"" round cake for the head where you lop the sides off. The legs can then be decorated structural supports like pipes with the rice krispies mix wrapped around it and covered in fondant or modelling chocolate. The best place to start is to draw out a breakdown of the main components of the AT-AT walker and that would give you a good idea on how to start. Goodluck! I'd love to see the result."
CAKEWIN,2n5l75,ayshasmysha,1 point,Sun Nov 23 14:00:33 2014 UTC,"Thanks for the response! Size is not terribly important, just large enough so that I can get some decent detailing onto it. This is really just a tradition amongst five or so friends, so the cake is generally a fair size that lasts a week in the house. :) Opposed to the stand up version, I have also seen one laying down that had been ""captured"" so to say. I will draw up my components and see where to go from there! Will post some pictures when I do it."
CAKEWIN,2n5l75,Shortkaik,1 point,Sun Nov 23 14:13:07 2014 UTC,"My tips on the detailing would be... make sure you've got a nice new sharp blade in your knife!  You should make the turrets from the 'head' ahead of time.  I recently made a Starcraft cake, and I wanted to add a sort of 'banged up' look to the metal.  You can dust on some black color dust, but I didn't have any at the time and used cocoa powder.  Worked really well!   Good luck!  I'll be watching for pictures :)"

CAKEWIN,2mzsfx,Shortkaik,3,Fri Nov 21 16:07:43 2014 UTC,"Question for you - I've always wondered how to go about massive orders like this. On the rare occasion I get asked about something this large I opt to just decline.  How far in advance do you start the baking? Do you bake all 500 in one day? And where do you store them?  I also just realized this says mini-cupcakes, oops (: I was imagining a giant hoard of regular/large cupcakes."
CAKEWIN,2mzsfx,twishling,1 point,Sat Nov 22 01:50:01 2014 UTC,"500 mini-cupcakes is still a lot! :)  I've also done an arrangement with 200 regular cupcakes (link)  I baked about 1/4 of them in advance (2-3 weeks) - I had a few other orders for chocolate/vanilla cakes/cupcakes and I made extra batter and baked up whatever cupcakes I could with it, then stored them in the freezer.  You can layer them on top of each other if you put some plastic wrap between.  The rest of them I baked the day before the order was due.  My oven was running the whole day, basically.  I also made the icing and music note decorations the day before... they could/should have been done earlier but I had a really crazy week and just didn't get the time!  I stored/transported them in these great ornament containers I got at Target.  They are so cheap and useful for mini/regular cupcakes!  And they don't take up a lot of space.  And only $10!"

I used my 3D printer to make a mass music note cutter (5 at a time) for the fondant decorations which made that process much faster.  About 30-45 mins to set up (2 people)."

The ""cheese"" was lemon flavored candy melts. The baker/decorator didn't realize it was lemon until she was working with it! The ""hot sauce"" was a combo of fig butter and cranberry-apple butter.

CAKEWIN,2mc5g9,ours_de_sucre,1 point,Sat Nov 15 12:14:32 2014 UTC,"Bravo! For some one who just turned 17, this is awesome!  Great job really, it's far nicer than the cakes I was making when I was your age!    Some helpful tips for next time:    -If you are making figures,  I would suggest making them in advance and have them dry out sitting on styrofoam cake dummies that match the cake sizes you will be doing for real. When making the body it's ok to spilt it up into different sections so you can work small amounts at a time. The legs for example can be shaped and placed onto a cake dummy to dry as you make the body. If you're bending the legs over the edge of the cake too long after making them they will tear.      -get yourself a small pizza wheel cutter (they sell them in the cake section at Michaels for a couple bucks) and a plastic ruller so you can make clean straight cuts for things like the name plaque at the bottom. These tools are so handy and you will use them for everything!     -Go to the hardware store and get yourself a large putty scraper. They sell them in large sizes (get one 6-7 inches long). These are the best at smoothing out sides. If you have your cake on a turn table you can spin it while holding the scraper to the side to make sure the sides are perfectly smooth. You can also run the scraper under hot water first to help with the sides. It looks like the yellow tier is starting to bow out at the bottom.  If you have a mousse filling, make sure you make a buttercream wall to keep the mousse from giving out under the weight of the cake.    Seriously keep up the awesome work!  With cakes, you only get better as you go along."

CAKEWIN,2m1l1e,ayshasmysha,5,Wed Nov 12 23:36:38 2014 UTC,Very pretty but doesn't this type of cake go stale quickly? You don't even have the cake crust to protect the cake with. I've always liked the look of them but I have often wondered how long that cake would last and how much would go to waste. Of course it's something I often do for when it's just family but then they get eaten up in a day or two.
CAKEWIN,2m1l1e,ayshasmysha,2,Wed Nov 12 11:57:36 2014 UTC,"with this type of cake, I always prepare the day before, and ensure that it is a recipe with a fair amiunt of mousture and a fine crumb.  I havent had an issue with going stale yet!  my practice cakes even withstood refrigeration, uncovered, for several days!  i do think it definitely depends on the recipe..."
CAKEWIN,2m1l1e,HobbitLass,2,Wed Nov 12 23:35:29 2014 UTC,I will play around with it. I always add syrup to my cakes too but I will do a trial where I'll just leave the cake out. It's always a nice option to give to clients especially because it would be cheaper than the decorating hooplah!
CAKEWIN,2m0snh,flyingbatbeaver,1 point,Wed Nov 12 00:24:52 2014 UTC,"Don't go for duffs. His brand name is what is bumping up the cost.  Buy a machine that offers replacement parts for absolutely every component, at affordable prices.  Mine breaks easily and often.  It's much cheaper to buy just a new needle, crown, air gauge, etc, than it is to buy a whole new airbrush or compressor. You also want the ability to increase/decrease the air flow pressure. A bottle of airbrush cleaner is necessary.  A little squirt of that in a bowl of warm water, take your airbrush apart and let it soak, and voila! No longer broken."
CAKEWIN,2m0snh,miss_bea,1 point,Wed Nov 12 01:32:34 2014 UTC,"What brand would you recommend? The one I keep seeing on Amazon, master airbrush, has mixed reviews. Regardless of the different price points they have. Talking about how the compressor craps out on them and whatnot.  At work I use a kopykake airbrush machine, that thing is awesome, but not $200+ awesome. I know I will get what I pay for, but again, I don't see myself using it often enough to let something that expensive just sit around and get used twice a year"

This is the one she uses the most.  As far as compressor goes, the ones they sell for nails will work to.  The key is to remember to clean it right after you use it.  You have to take the needle out and clean it well."

It's officially the biggest stacked cake I've ever made, and I had to get my Dad to help me deliver it because I couldn't even lift it!  I made all of the decorations from fondant/sugarpaste, and painted it using my brand new airbrush (very fun!).  Please ignore the random pins - I had to put on a few of the decorations at the venue and I was using the pins to prop them up while the royal icing dried.

CAKEWIN,2l6z5j,Abbadabbey,1 point,Tue Nov 4 20:29:22 2014 UTC,"I actually make my own fondant which is super easy and way cheaper. This is the recipe I use http://www.wilton.com/recipe/Rolled-Marshmallow-Fondant  Some tips I have for you:  You can save your fondant in a Tupperware and use wax paper to separate your colours so they don't bleed into each other If your fondant dries out and becomes crumbly, you can add a little bit of water and Crisco and keep kneeding it in until you get the right texture Also, make sure you are using gel food colouring instead of liquid; it has a richer colour, you don't need to use a lot and it won't change the consistency of what you're working with. This is a great video to see the whole process and consistency http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaKqSND8sPc Good luck :)"

I think it's funny how there's always one distinctive feature in well-recognized characters that you don't realize they really need to have perfect in order to make them really shine as that character.  Elmo's fur continues to elude me.  I have to literally trace him for him to look perfect.  For Olaf, it's his upper lip.  For Thomas, it's his nose.  Weird, seemingly trivial details that end up being their defining features."

I was a bit disappointed though, we were using styrofoam dummies rather than cake (which rather defies the point), but the classes would've taken way too long if we'd had to carve cakes too. There was drama though, Mayen was using an Agbay leveller to cut up a dummy and accidentally sliced her index finger open. The organisers had to call in all manner of favours to get a nurse to come and patch her up on-site so the class could continue  You missed a brilliant time, they had a cake-off on Saturday night, where two teams of tutors had an hour to decorate a cake on the theme ""80's movies"". Absolutely epic  Also, half the attendees were stalking Paul Bradford, it was a little bit creepy  No word yet on whether there'll be another one, but I do think it's worth the expense"

CAKEWIN,2k8n72,flyingbatbeaver,1 point,Fri Oct 24 22:37:35 2014 UTC,"I might be able to answer some of your questions. I'm not an instructor myself, but I do schedule all the classes at a JoAnn Fabrics.  I usually schedule level 1 once per month, and the higher levels once every two months (they're all four sessions at two hours each). This might vary depending on how popular Wilton classes are at your particular store (they're really not that popular at mine).   When I schedule classes, I do it based on both the instructor's availability, and based on what time of the day/week that people will have free time and be available to take classes. Like most of my classes are scheduled on nights and weekends, just cause that's when most people happen to be free. I also have to make the schedule 3-4 months ahead of time, but this might also vary depending on your store. I don't know how Michaels does it.  One of the former Wilton instructors is still a good friend of mine, and she says that the worst part for her was having to try and market Wilton products. When you teach the classes, the Wilton people will also try to get you to sell people shit they don't need. You are encouraged to be a salesperson as well as an instructor, and she kind of hated that part.   I'm not exactly sure how the pay works for Wilton instructors because they are paid through Wilton and not through us, but I can probably get back to you on that."

CAKEWIN,2jnrqt,SenileJunta,17,Sun Oct 19 11:21:14 2014 UTC,"Well.  There is still cake under the fondant. You don't have to eat every part of what could be served. Would you eat the bones with ribs? Or the spoon with soup?   There are also many types of fondant. Undoubtedly a vast majority of people that ""hate fondant"" hate the cheap, store bought, play-dough-esque fondant. Even if you manage to dislike the many types of fondant in all it's forms, a lot of people still enjoy it or just don't eat that part.   Working with fondant is hard and takes skill.   Not to mention there's no fondant at all on this cake, yet you still feel the need to cater to the ""we hate fondant"" circlejerk that often pops up with your silly comment.   Especially in a sub dedicated to the decoration of cakes.   Whilst I'm sure it's nice, saying that icing sugar drizzled between two pieces of sponge looks better than fantastically crafted cake decorations (which still have cake underneath them) is just flat out stupid.   If you'd rather eat cake than look at it, go and eat a cake instead of looking at them."
CAKEWIN,2jnrqt,barristonsmellme,-4,Sun Oct 19 12:18:24 2014 UTC,"Actually that's a good point, I am sorry. Although the spoon analogy was terrible, the bone was pretty good. I find that the marrow is delicious to suck the juices from but, you're right I don't eat the bone. It does add flavour to soups & stocks if you leave it in. It is a terrible shame to waste so much food though. Decorating cakes doesn't have to be just fondant though, I was voicing my opinion that I disliked it very strongly. I can't :( no cake in the house. Thank you for the feedback. I'm sorry if my comment offended you but I was voicing that fondant is not nice. While you make a very strong point that I don't have to eat it which I never actually thought of doing, :p I dislike wasting food."

CAKEWIN,2j6y4f,ayshasmysha,3,Tue Oct 14 06:28:26 2014 UTC,I think you should work on it. Rose piping can look very elegant and clean. Maybe use a thicker consistency as the icing there looks a little bit too soft for that. Also try sticking to a solid colour or two lighter colours?  http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-DzUkKonwfw8/Udr-AIDCRqI/AAAAAAAAATA/H-PwFiKlwiE/s1600/rose+swirl+cake+tutorial+pic+1.jpg

I was working off of sweet pea flowers http://www.countryliving.com/cm/countryliving/images/Bicolored-Sweet-Peas-GARDEN0407-de.jpg  and a machine quilting pattern http://www.sewthankful.com/Trailing-Vine-quilting-pantograph-pattern-Lorien-Quilting.html  and then right before I started, I found a dead gnat on the cake so I'm not sure if it was a bad plan, or just corrupted by anger."

CAKEWIN,2j0bcq,APacman,4,Sun Oct 12 11:32:27 2014 UTC,"Actually, I used marshmallow fondant for the brain design! After I had already committed to that, I realized I could have tried it with butter cream.   I started by torting two 8 in red velvet cakes. I then filled them with cream cheese frosting and stuck it in the freezer so that I could give it a basic carve before the final layer of frosting and the fondant.  The blood was a strawberry jam that I pureed and then ran through a sieve to remove seeds. I added a small amount of blue food coloring to get a more realistic color. :)  This is the tutorial that I mostly followed."

CAKEWIN,2izll2,Quib,3,Sun Oct 12 04:30:14 2014 UTC,"Sorry for the length, I am not a professional recipe writer.  Cake:  1 1/2 tablespoon loose Earl Grey  1 cup unsalted butter  1 1/2 cups flour   3/4 teaspoon dried lavender  1/4 teaspoon plus   1/8 teaspoon baking powder   1/4 teaspoon kosher salt   1 cup granulated sugar  3 tablespoons milk  3 large eggs  3 tablespoons sour cream  1 teaspoon vanilla powder or 1 inch vanilla bean  preheat oven to 170 C makes 2 8 inch rounds   melt butter and add the tea, steep for a few minutes and then strain out the larger leaves and toss them. let the butter cool in a large bowl to room temperature.   In a medium bowl mix together the flour, baking powder, salt, and vanilla powder (if you use the bean I would wait and add it to the wet ingredients).  In the large bowl, cream the sugar into the butter. Then add the sour cream, milk, and eggs. Slowly add the flour mixture a little at a time until all is mixed. (It's a thicker batter than most cakes so don't worry if it looks a little thick) fold in the lavender.   Bake at 170 until a toothpick comes out clean (should be around 30 minutes depending on what size pan you used). If you are doing a thicker  sheet cake you can reduce the temp to 160 and bake for 40 or so.   Frosting:   3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice  1 teaspoon lemon zest  2 tablespoons milk   1 stick unsalted butter  2 1/2 to 4 cups sifted powdered sugar depending on what consistency you like ( I used 3)  (optional) Half a pinch of dried lavender  soften butter, mix in milk, lemon juice, zest, and lavender. add powdered sugar until satisfied."

CAKEWIN,2iwzgb,can_stop_will_stop,1 point,Sat Oct 11 21:22:29 2014 UTC,I've worked in a grocery store bakery before. Often the people writing on cakes don't speak English so they don't necessarily catch mistakes and just write verbatim.  It's also possible that someone wrote the info in the wrong spot on the order form and the decorator took a chance and wrote it anyway.   People get some weird things written on cakes. It's not always obvious whether or not something's supposed to be there.

CAKEWIN,2id8t7,PandaPandamonium,5,Sun Oct 5 16:48:04 2014 UTC,For sculpting cakes its best to use a dense type of cake like a pound cake. Also if you are not putting in dowels to support the weight correctly you will end up having the cake break apart. If you arent a big fan of the baking part and only want to decorate you can buy topsy turvy cake dummies made from Styrofoam to decorate and then just make some simple cakes to cut up and serve.
CAKEWIN,2id8t7,ours_de_sucre,2,Sun Oct 5 17:34:46 2014 UTC,"I didn't even get to the stacking part before each tier split down the middle. Each tier itself isn't strong enough to support everything. So is it the cake recipe or how I'm cutting down the sides? (going 6"" to 5"" bottom and 9"" to 8"" bottom)  I followed the recipe in this link so that a box mix would be more dense and people said it works however it just isn't  working for me.  http://www.cakecentral.com/a/durable-cake-for-3d-and-wedding-cakes  (I do have the dowels and what not for it though.- I've done normal 3 tier cakes before and know how to do supports)"
CAKEWIN,2id8t7,LittleBitOdd,2,Sun Oct 5 19:13:18 2014 UTC,"I have never found box mix to be good for sculpting, you need something dense  Could you explain how you're going about the topsy-turvey aspect? Like are you making two separate tiers and stacking using the common method, or are you doing something mildly insane like stacking up equal layers and trying to carve a topsy-turvey cake shape out of it?"
CAKEWIN,2id8t7,jopilon669,1 point,Sun Oct 5 18:24:10 2014 UTC,"I made a 2-layer (each was about 1.5"") 6"" round tier carved the sides down so on the bottom it was 5"".

CAKEWIN,2id8t7,jopilon669,1 point,Sun Oct 5 19:09:22 2014 UTC,Box mix as a base can be good but you need to cut the water to one cup and the oil to a quarter cup.
CAKEWIN,2id8t7,misswhitnum,1 point,Sun Oct 5 23:27:32 2014 UTC,Also you need to use straw or something to distribute the weight.
CAKEWIN,2id8t7,Moustic,2,Sun Oct 5 23:28:32 2014 UTC,"cakes dont gain structure from butter/oil/water, those ingredients add moisture, which adds air and air = more of a crumb.  Flour and eggs give structure to a product, although lots of egg whites can have the same effect as the other liquid ingredients.  if you're experimenting with different measurements, try one but add more egg or flour.    As far as what type of cake, I usually use a white cake.  Pound cake is dense, but i don't think it tastes great."

You do need to get a nice even crumb coat underneath and buy some fondant smoothers - this is the video I used when I was learning: http://youtu.be/Q9iquCQGFKU.

CAKEWIN,2i5w9v,lalalava,4,Fri Oct 3 05:09:12 2014 UTC,This is great! I just signed up for Course 1 starting next week and am really excited to start learning how to decorate. Now I have a small preview of what to expect :)
CAKEWIN,2i5w9v,Ziharrkk,2,Fri Oct 3 05:27:47 2014 UTC,Yayy post your class projects once you're done!! I thoroughly enjoyed the class (though it was a lot of work baking something and preparing lots of icing each week!! My labmates appreciated it though). I'd be curious to compare people's experiences!
CAKEWIN,2i5w9v,LadyMasterChemist,3,Fri Oct 3 06:00:47 2014 UTC,"I tried searching all over the internet for information on what the redesigned Course 1 was like but couldn't find information! So I'm hoping this will be helpful to any redditors interested in the class. I took the old course about 5 years ago but there are some differences -- like you don't all have to make the same weird cupcake cake in class 2. I haven't decorated a cake for 5 years (and I was super amateur then) so these are nowhere near professional!  I took the class at a local Michael's art store. It was 2 hours / week for 4 weeks. There were 4 students but by the last class it was just me :-(. The course itself cost me $20, the kit is about $25 (I just used my old one), and I bought about $40 in extra materials (parchment paper, larger spatula, cake carrier with a turntable).  Let me know if you have any questions! And I'm signed up to take the next course starting next week!"
CAKEWIN,2i5w9v,LadyMasterChemist,2,Fri Oct 3 05:13:42 2014 UTC,"I don't know if your instructor taught you this, but something helpful for your base frosting is to do a crumb coat, where you spread a thin layer of frosting over the cake. Don't worry about how messy it is, thin and covered is the important part. Then, you let that set (at room temp or in the fridge), and come back to do a full frosting coat. Its much easier to spread frosting on top of hardened frosting than it is to spread on cake, so the crumbs get sealed in the ""crumb-coat"" and your final frosting is more polished. Here's instructions.  You can also use Viva paper towels or parchment paper to smooth the surface of the frosting. Place the paper on the surface and run your hands across it to smooth it out. It won't fix massive craters, but it definitely makes things smoother.  Here's a great video on overall smooth frosting."
CAKEWIN,2i5w9v,kawaii1105,1 point,Fri Oct 3 17:47:35 2014 UTC,"Thanks so much for this advice! Yup, my instructor mentioned it, but at the point I realized my cake was too crumbly, I had run out of frosting to do a second layer! I'll definitely make more for future cakes though.  Another problem I had was that sometimes I would have many small clumps of powdered sugar in my frosting. I used butter and would hand mix... ideas on the best way to solve that?"
CAKEWIN,2i5w9v,kduluth,2,Fri Oct 3 19:56:16 2014 UTC,"Sift your powdered sugar before adding it to the bowl, that should eliminate clumps."

CAKEWIN,2i5w9v,kawaii1105,1 point,Fri Oct 3 06:02:09 2014 UTC,I am a current instructor. Always start with the least amount of water or milk!  Often times it softens a bit later. Also keep in mind if you use butter instead of shortening the heat from your hands will soften it further. Take breaks and throw the icing in the fridge for a few minutes before you continue!
CAKEWIN,2i5w9v,DeeAmi,1 point,Fri Oct 3 13:48:19 2014 UTC,"Are you using the recipe from the book? And if it's too warm then the frosting will start to melt. If you're still having trouble with it, try making it thicker than you think it should be, that way you can use it longer before it will become too soft."
CAKEWIN,2i5w9v,LadyMasterChemist,1 point,Fri Oct 3 14:08:22 2014 UTC,Hmm well if it's made with real butter then it's most likely getting too warm from your hands as you work with it. :/
CAKEWIN,2i5w9v,DeeAmi,2,Fri Oct 3 18:03:38 2014 UTC,I am so incredibly happy you posted this.  One of the local bakeries is offering a cake decorating class.

CAKEWIN,2i5w9v,LadyMasterChemist,2,Fri Oct 3 21:34:31 2014 UTC,"Just a warning, Wilton's courses come with a LOT of materials you have to purchase and bring in, and then you also have to bring your own frosting and cake/cupcakes/etc. However, Michael's usually discounts the first course by 50%, so you would definitely save money doing the Wilton course. I imagine you'd learn more from the local bakery course though. I personally felt Wilton's course 1 was very basic.  Bonus: Here's my final cake"
CAKEWIN,2i5w9v,anonymousxo,1 point,Sat Oct 4 08:51:50 2014 UTC,"The local class is very basic.  I read and re-read the flyer to determine what the $75 was going to get me.  Absolutely nothing different than the Wilton ad.  I have the Wilton Ultimate Decorating Set, so I am not sure how much more I would need in supplies.    Perhaps, I have my nose in the air regarding the local class, it is offered at a bakery that wanted me to work on Saturdays baking for catering events.

CAKEWIN,2i5w9v,lasombrayelalma,1 point,Fri Oct 3 17:41:03 2014 UTC,"The Wilton classes are definitely a bargain, and it's often not hard to find tons of discounts and coupons (often up to 50% off) when you buy stuff at Michael's. To make up for it, the class sometimes feels like an infomercial for tons of somewhat useful but not really necessary Wilton products to make up for the low starting price though. But I'm ok with that for the price! I feel like Wilton is also a recognized name (and you get a certificate at the end!) so if you plan on making cake decoration into a career, Wilton ""certification"" might mean more than classes from a local shop."

CAKEWIN,2hsmfu,beccamarieb,5,Tue Sep 30 00:25:45 2014 UTC,"I used to think it was funny, but then more than one person (thousands, actually) started naming their children Nevaeh. Now I just make this face when I think about it."
CAKEWIN,2hsmfu,LittleBitOdd,4,Tue Sep 30 01:21:06 2014 UTC,"I do wonder about the type of person who names their child Neveah. Like are they all teenagers who think it's clever and unique, or are there well-educated adults who pull this shit?"
CAKEWIN,2hsmfu,cupcakewin,5,Tue Sep 30 02:10:37 2014 UTC,The only people I know who named their kid Navaeh was on 16 and pregnant........
CAKEWIN,2hsmfu,LittleBitOdd,5,Tue Sep 30 02:18:08 2014 UTC,I saw one on Maury who wanted to name her kid Legna Tnes Neveah. She seemed pretty unhinged anyway
CAKEWIN,2hsmfu,thebutchershouse,2,Tue Sep 30 02:20:44 2014 UTC,Why are you in disgust over the name Mason? It isn't a new or uncommon name by any standard. Neither is Colton.  Nor are either of them usually spelled.  I agree on Hudsyn and Nevaeh though.
CAKEWIN,2hsmfu,beccamarieb,3,Tue Sep 30 05:50:00 2014 UTC,"I think it has to do with the twee/crunchy crowd and their obsession with precious names that end in -on. Mason. Paxton. Madison. Colton. Jaxton. Jayson. Jackson. Whatever other bastardized versions they come up with. But you're right, Nevaeh/Hudsyn are a different type of annoying baby name than Colton/Mason. I could write a thesis on annoying kid names :P"
CAKEWIN,2hsmfu,thebutchershouse,1 point,Tue Sep 30 08:29:31 2014 UTC,"Didn't even think of it like that.  So many names ending in -n specifically,  Jayden,  Aiden, etc were especially popular. A good amount of names in the top 100 probably end with an -on or an -en.  My boyfriend has a personal hatred of the popularity of the name Mason since that is his name.  That was why I was so curious as to your reasoning."

CAKEWIN,2g8hew,danilane,3,Fri Sep 12 21:02:14 2014 UTC,"Lovely. Very clean work. How did you get that off the counter top without marking the base? I'm impressed.    One tip that I learned was to hot glue pop bottle caps to the bottom of the base to give it some feet. Picking up and moving the cake is 10000x easier, and if you glue the caps closer to the center, they are virtually invisible."
CAKEWIN,2g8hew,theproperpeach,3,Sat Sep 13 00:06:25 2014 UTC,"Thank you! & that is a brilliant idea! I didn't move this cake however. I'm super weak, my arms would probably break if I tried lifting it! I work at a Cakery, my boss helped me move it. But I took care of the rest, start to finish.  & my clean lines are from a tutorial I found online. I mix candy clay with fondant (equal parts). Cover the top of the cake first, then wrap fondant around the side (using water to make it stick to the ganached cake). Then taking water, I blend the seams together. You can get it almost perfect! I love it because I'm awful with covering a cake the regular way, always get tears or thin spots."
CAKEWIN,2g8hew,theproperpeach,2,Sat Sep 13 00:14:50 2014 UTC,"That sounds really interesting. I've never tried covering a cake that way, with the fondant in separate sections. If you find the tutorial you watched, will you post it? Thanks!"
CAKEWIN,2g8hew,sjgw137,3,Sat Sep 13 00:20:04 2014 UTC,"So it wasn't a video, it was an article.  Here is the link (I hope that worked, I'm still new to this). But like I said, I find it works easier to cover the top first, then use a razor blade to trim it to fit (while on the cake). Then wrap the sides & cut this fondant so there is maybe a few centimeters above the top of the cake.  Then take he water to the back seam (if desired) & to the top. Then I use a paddle to smooth it. But I only do this on cake we ganache, never tried it on buttercream but I think the success rate would be lower since it's much more hands on.  But I love it & it gives me those sharp edges. You can even roll the fondant mixture out & walk away for 10 mins & it'll still be soft!"

After I got my job at the Cakery, I learned about using ganache on the cakes (I was taught a makeshift one with the candy melts). & from there I found this tutorial. But my boss hates it which is infuriating because she does the regular way, causing rips, but charges an arm & a leg for it! I think customers deserve what they pay for."

Ingredients:  1 cup softened butter  1/2 cup cocoa powder, sifted  5 cups powdered sugar  1 teaspoon vanilla  3-4 tablespoons milk  Directions:  Whip butter and cocoa together until smooth in large bowl.

CAKEWIN,2f8z4o,oroboros-san,4,Tue Sep 2 11:01:55 2014 UTC,"OK you'll be wanting a fairly dense cake if you're carving a shape - but it would have been better to bake the cake a few days in advance as it will be too soft to carve without mega crumbs.  But a basic cake is all you'd need :-) Fillings you can do anything you like,  you just want to make sure they're not going to slop out the edges and ruin the fondant. I've done choc cake with peanut butter/chocolate/hazelnut fillings but you could do any number of cake/filling combos.  No matter - if you want to keep it easy (and cheap!),  I make marshmallow fondant which tastes like marshmallow (duh) is easy and works as well as store bought for covering cakes.   1 and a half cups (or so) icing (powdered) sugar (add extra as you knead - it's almost done when it's not sticking to you anymore)  1 tablespoon water 1 cup marshmallows  Put marshmallow and water in microwave. Nuke for 30 seconds and stir till smooth.  Add to icing sugar and combine/knead until it becomes a ball of dough.  Use crisco to coat your hands (not much) and bench to stop everything sticking. You want a nice smooth ball with a bit of stretch to it - think pizza dough.  Rest the ball for a while first - 30 mins should be fine.   Knead again, then roll it out and cover cake.   I cover cakes in frosting first to help the fondant stick. Use a flat edged utensil (square piece of plastic is good) to smooth out fondant.   If you want to know anything else at all,  something I've missed,   please don't hesitate to pm me :-)"
CAKEWIN,2f8z4o,HandmeMOREchocolate,1 point,Tue Sep 2 13:31:55 2014 UTC,"I think i'll do a basic cake, chocolate and peanuts filling. I'm considering a round cake, so I think I'l cut it in three and fill in between so that it doesn't get too dense and dry. I'll be sure to check that no peanut leave the cake borders. Plain chocolate for sticking the fondant.  I have only one question: If I cover the cake with frosting and then add the fondant, will it hold on the refrigerator for maybe 8 hours and then a car drive? Or should I just fill the cake and keep the frosting on the fridge and cover and add the fondant right when I'm about to serve? I'm a bit scared, as I'm doing the cake in the morning, and it's supposed to be served after dinner. The temperature here is pretty warm (right now it's 1am and 23C/74F) and I'll have to move the cake in a car at 7pm, so I'm very afraid that the icing will melt and the fondant will slip. Maybe I should just keep the fondant and the icing on a cooler and assemble the cake at his place?"
CAKEWIN,2f8z4o,HandmeMOREchocolate,1 point,Wed Sep 3 00:08:28 2014 UTC,The wonderful thing about fondant is it works as insulation for keeping the cake moist inside. The frosting soaks into the cake making it soft too. I keep my cakes in the fridge in summer but it gets really humid/hot here.  23C isn't bad and as long as the cake is kept out of direct sunlight and heat it should be fine :-) Oh and air conditioner in the car.  Good luck!!!

While I don't have any specific tips or info for you, I have learned a lot on YouTube.. kind of saves you some frustration while you're waiting for a reply on here.  Idk where you live, but if there's a Joann Fabrics or Walmart in your area, you may be able to find Wilton brand pre-made fondant. There's a whole baking section in Joann's, but if you check at Wal-Mart, it won't be in the normal baking aisle. There's a small section that's usually located around the scrapbooking or party section that sells mostly Wilton cake decorating supplies, such as the fondant, tubs of buttercream (I still prefer home made) piping tips, fondant supplies, cake boards and boxes, turntables, etc. I hope this is helpful."

CAKEWIN,2f69jm,EnlightenedPenguin,4,Mon Sep 1 18:13:30 2014 UTC,"Are you looking for someone to make this for you, or are you open to making one yourself?  If you could figure out a way to make the cake into the shape you want, maybe cover it in fondant. Print out a large copy of the badge, lay wax paper over the print out and trace the details. Then you can lay the wax paper over the fondant cake and take something.. maybe a closed click-pen (or something else with a fine tip) and gently trace the details in order to create an indent of the image on the cake. From there you could either pipe/trace the indented details, or use some kind of cake paint to trace it.   Sorry if this doesn't make sense.

CAKEWIN,2f69jm,PoniesRBitchin,1 point,Mon Sep 1 15:47:01 2014 UTC,If you don't have much experience with fondant (I actually prefer not to use it as I think frosting  tastes better) you could cut out the cake in the right shape then do your best to evenly frost it with buttercream. Let the cake refrigerate for about 20 minutes then use wax paper or a paper towel to gently pat the frosting and it will make it flat and smooth giving you a nice finished look that you can decorate on. Here is a video demonstrating:  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8g-qma7jLQ  Good luck! He sounds like a great guy

CAKEWIN,2f69jm,EnlightenedPenguin,2,Mon Sep 1 18:11:21 2014 UTC,I've done this with buttercream. You have to wait for it to dry out a bit and sticking it in the fridge.   I used a toothpick to trace with the wax paper. Then I used different colored buttercreams and tips to create what I wanted.

Yes, there is fondant that tastes like plastic but I just don't use that kind. The Duff brand fondant that's carried at most craft stores actually tastes pretty good and you can make marshmallow fondant if you want to make it yourself. Also, when making cakes I always frost the cake pretty thick under the fondant so the people who've only ever had gross fondant can peel it off."

CAKEWIN,2edhu3,ayshasmysha,1 point,Sun Aug 24 03:21:21 2014 UTC,I think that is a beautiful cake but the only thing I can suggest is to cut the polka dots out earlier so they have time to harden. That way when you pick them up they don't lose their shape?
CAKEWIN,2egbio,BahamanIcecream,1 point,Sun Aug 24 16:29:56 2014 UTC,"In my opinion fondant would be the best thing to use to make a colourful cake. You can do so much with it.  If you wanted to make something like a rainbow cake make sure you use gel colours and never liquid.  You can try making marshmallow fondant, I've heard its easier to use and tastes like marshmallow."
CAKEWIN,2e95xh,bunny1138,4,Fri Aug 22 05:53:25 2014 UTC,"Have you ever tried chocolate clay?  Everyone forgets about it since fondant became so popular, but I think it's much more palatable/editable for things like flowers, roses, etc than is fondant.  If you've never played with it, try it out  (also, your rose here looks awesome). I make many of my flowers out of chocolate clay because I hate the taste of most fondant.  http://whatscookingamerica.net/Candy/ChocolateRoses.htm"
CAKEWIN,2e95xh,sjgw137,2,Fri Aug 22 13:46:52 2014 UTC,Thank you! I tried chocolate clay on the second cake I did.  I over-kneaded it and it got oily.  I need to try it again.

CAKEWIN,2e95xh,MrsTheJones,1 point,Fri Aug 22 18:27:16 2014 UTC,"The cake is devil's food with chocolate frosting, cherry filling, and chocolate marshmallow fondant.  The rose is marshmallow fondant.  The mask is white chocolate.  The pearl border at the bottom is sixlet candies."
CAKEWIN,2e95xh,MrsTheJones,2,Fri Aug 22 05:57:23 2014 UTC,"Have you tried kneading in regular white wilton fondant into your batches of marshmallow fondant? 50%/50% ratio. It makes your MMF much more pliable and the consistency is amazing! You get the functionality of store bought fondant but the great taste of marshmallow fondant. Plus it makes huge batches for less than buying the same amount in regular fondant. You did great on this cake, by the way!"
CAKEWIN,2e95xh,sjgw137,2,Fri Aug 22 14:04:31 2014 UTC,I haven't tried that.  I will next time though.  Thank you!  Marshmallow fondant can definitely be a little finicky.
CAKEWIN,2e95xh,MrsTheJones,1 point,Fri Aug 22 14:59:28 2014 UTC,"Oh trust me I know! The wilton fondant kneaded in gives you the elasticity of real fondant and works great. Plus, add in some tylose powder and you've got gumpaste!"
CAKEWIN,2e95xh,sjgw137,1 point,Fri Aug 22 15:59:04 2014 UTC,But the Wilton's stuff tastes so bad :( I really like the Fondariffic stuff.
CAKEWIN,2e95xh,MrsTheJones,2,Fri Aug 22 17:54:31 2014 UTC,you don't taste the store bought fondant one bit. the mmf overpowers the taste. But the new decorator preferred wilton fondant actually doesn't taste bad. You can use any brand of store bought fondant you'd like cause the end product is all the same but wilton is the cheapest route which means you can make so much more for less money.
CAKEWIN,2e95xh,sjgw137,1 point,Fri Aug 22 18:25:37 2014 UTC,Good to know.  I haven't gone back to Wilton's after my original terrible sample.  Didn't want to spend the money on a product I didn't like to begin with.

CAKEWIN,2cpafw,the_olioli,2,Tue Aug 5 16:45:29 2014 UTC,Marshmallow Frosting Recipe: 4 large egg whites  1 cup granulated sugar  Pinch of salt  1 tsp vanilla extract  Place all ingredients except the vanilla into a metal bowl and place over a pot of simmering water. (double boiler) Whisk the egg white mixture constantly over simmering water until the sugar dissolves and the mixture is hot to the touch. It takes around 5 minutes.  Remove from heat and beat using a mixer with a whisk attachment on high until light and fluffy.  You can also toast the frosting if you have a torch! I tried using the broiler on my oven but it cooked the frosting and made it taste more like meringue than marshmallows. Enjoy!

CAKEWIN,2ce7h7,boobsrfood,3,Mon Aug 4 17:03:02 2014 UTC,"I am far from flawless on my buttercream but I will take the compliment. Practice and the right tools are what have helped me.  I always fill and crumb-coat cake first and then give it a good chill. After my crumb-coat is firm I put on a substantial layer of icing on the top and smooth and level it off. Next, I put a generous and layer of icing on the sides. I do all of this with an off-set spatula. Next, I use my metal bench scraper that I have been keeping warm in a pot of water and  I gradually take icing away and smooth out the imperfections. My icing only ends up being 1/4"" thick all around. Using a rotating cake stand helps a lot too. You could sub a lazy-susan in a pinch.  I found the Joshua John Russel's Craftsy course ""Basic Buttercream"" full of great tips on icing a perfect cake. If you're lucky it might still be free but it's totally worth the purchase. Hope I have been some help."

CAKEWIN,2bdkxf,aDuckling,8,Tue Jul 22 08:59:53 2014 UTC,"If you want it to look more professional:   remove the aluminiumfoil and thrift/buy/get some pretty serving plates to properly present your food. Think conventional and unconventional: Cake plates, teacups, saucers, upturned flowerpots, circular wood slabs, wooden cutting block, ... Find a spot with a lot of natural light in your home. Try to not use your flash to photograph food, as it gives strong shadows because you take such close ups. If you can't find such a spot inside, consider going outside in the garden to photograph. You could also try to make a light diffuser if you like to cook at night or want to stay indoors.  For this cake: i would have cut the borders of your cakes, so that the ""burnt"" edges are gone. And then: more light, no flash!    Maybe to show off these layers i would have gone with a completely frosted edge, and then a cut piece on a pretty plate with a garden background or something like that."
CAKEWIN,2bdkxf,PoppetRock,1 point,Tue Jul 22 13:06:53 2014 UTC,"good ideas.   The lighting in my house is pretty difficult, and it's 115 outside. There's a lot of over head lighting, and tall tables, and I'm awkwardly short.  I might try dragging things into the living room, maybe set up a folding table or just spread out on the floor.   I kinda like edges on my cakes, but you're right, it's not the best look.   Know any tricks to cutting a slice that doesn't mush it up and get crumbs everywhere? http://i.imgur.com/ya289KE.jpg So far I've got not using Betty Crocker mixes, and waiting for room temperature to fall bellow 85 degrees."
CAKEWIN,2bdkxf,Cupcake_eater,3,Fri Jul 25 06:42:14 2014 UTC,"I love me some cake photography. My suggestions?  Get rid of:   Wrinkly backdrops. Wrinkles and creases make pics look messy and frumpy. I've used wrapping paper, a lace dress, and a curtain as backdrops if I can't find a good background. Scrapbook paper is great for cupcake photos.   The flash on your camera: never flattering. Use a piece of white paper to reflect light; grab a sheet from your printer and angle it around.   All foil ever. Foil says you care nothing for presentation. Cover your boards in scrapbook paper, then cellophane. Ribbon around the edges hides cardboard corrugation.   The lumps in your cake. A leveler is your best friend! You don't have to saw your cake in half, just trim it so it's even. Get down to eye level with your cake and you'll be able to get a good flat layer of frosting. Or pipe it with a large round tip.   Now that you've done that...  Drag your cake around your house till you find a spot with good morning light. Morning light rocks! Shutters or blinds are a bonus for adjusting brightness. Dust your area. Nothing catches light like a speck of dust.   Take photos from several different angles. Get down and look up at it. Get on a chair and look down. Take some close-ups of the parts that look the best.   Good luck!"

The cakes were still delicious.  I frosted/ decorated them friday and saturday for a sunday shower.  3) Maybe tape a couple of the sticks together to give more stability?  I had straws on hand so I just used them.  But if you tape three together and put them around it should be fine since you are only doing two tiers.  4) Not sure about the writing icing, I have never used it before.  How fast does it dry?  You could probably just use extra buttercream between the tiers and that will work fine.  I use water for fondant decorations and they survived a 40 minute bumpy ride.    5) I think if you rub the decorations down with cornstarch or powdered sugar, that should keep them from getting sticky.  Good luck.  It seems scary at first but once you get the science down you will want to make more!"

CAKEWIN,2aym2u,mashedtatoes88,1 point,Fri Jul 18 18:10:56 2014 UTC,Thank you! It looks great!
CAKEWIN,2aqqal,Caladriel,11,Tue Jul 15 06:27:20 2014 UTC,It is beautifully done and a cool idea but also makes me think about having chalk in my mouth or scratching my teeth against a chalk board.
CAKEWIN,2aqqal,LikeTheCircus,6,Tue Jul 15 13:07:17 2014 UTC,"I made it to be a dummy cake for a bridal show, but my perfectionist side sees that it's not perfect and I want to do it over.  But all my co-workers say it looks great and that the imperfections make it look more like it should ideally look... hand drawn on a chalkboard."
CAKEWIN,2aqqal,redditerrrr,6,Tue Jul 15 06:28:43 2014 UTC,"Agree, the ""not exactly perfect""-ness of it is what makes is so neat.  It's a super original idea, and the execution is amazing.  I think it looks awesome."

CAKEWIN,2aqqal,LittleBitOdd,14,Wed Jul 16 03:33:29 2014 UTC,Fucking awesome is my honest opinion. How did you get the chalk effect?
CAKEWIN,2aqqal,can_stop_will_stop,2,Tue Jul 15 09:50:03 2014 UTC,It was white airbrush color.
CAKEWIN,2aqqal,LittleBitOdd,1 point,Tue Jul 15 22:33:31 2014 UTC,"Yes! Please share how you achieved this affect! I've seen some people say white gel dye on black fondant, is that what you used? If so, did you mix it with anything?"
CAKEWIN,2aqqal,latsyrcami,1 point,Tue Jul 15 21:10:33 2014 UTC,I was thinking it could be painted on with icing sugar and then fixed in place with a spray glaze
CAKEWIN,2aqqal,LittleBitOdd,5,Tue Jul 15 21:11:21 2014 UTC,"I love it! But take from my personal experience, eating black fondant or any black icing is messy and makes your mouth disgusting. A lot of people wouldn't appreciate that at a wedding or other nice events.   That being said, I love the concept and it fits me perfectly!"
CAKEWIN,2aqqal,latsyrcami,3,Tue Jul 15 12:17:16 2014 UTC,"That's a very fair point. Green mouths don't look great in the wedding photos, and green bowel movements the next day can be terrifying. People do tend to peel fondant off though"
CAKEWIN,2aqqal,LittleBitOdd,2,Tue Jul 15 14:35:37 2014 UTC,That's true. I actually like the taste of fondant tho lol
CAKEWIN,2aqqal,starlinguk,2,Tue Jul 15 15:20:52 2014 UTC,"Me too. I think it depends on the country. The fondant you can get in the UK is pretty decent, it tastes like marshmallows. I've been told that fondant in the US is absolutely vile"
CAKEWIN,2aqqal,LittleBitOdd,1 point,Tue Jul 15 15:24:45 2014 UTC,The green Sainsbury's fondant I had the other day (my kid insisted on a Creeper cake) was vile.
CAKEWIN,2aqqal,LittleBitOdd,1 point,Tue Jul 15 16:18:40 2014 UTC,"Nah, the coloured stuff sucks. Tesco fondant (white) is good though"
CAKEWIN,2aqqal,innocuous_username,1 point,Tue Jul 15 16:41:22 2014 UTC,I'm in the US.  We use Satin Ice brand fondant and it tastes like marshmallows.
CAKEWIN,2aqqal,latsyrcami,1 point,Tue Jul 15 22:36:32 2014 UTC,"I've heard mixed reviews on Satin Ice. I tried some of their chocolate fondant at a trade show, and it wasn't bad, but other decorators I know have been very critical of Satin Ice"
CAKEWIN,2aqqal,cmykaye,1 point,Tue Jul 15 22:39:56 2014 UTC,I use Satin Ice as well ... never had any complaints about taste
CAKEWIN,2aqqal,cupcakewin,1 point,Fri Jul 18 00:21:18 2014 UTC,Well the majority of people that order fondant only want it for the visual.  The brand we use actually tastes pretty great.  And I'd say fondant has much less of the messy mouth effect than actual icing does.
CAKEWIN,2aqqal,Whohaw,1 point,Tue Jul 15 22:36:00 2014 UTC,Omg the kind my mom used recently made my mouth horribly black eating just one small flower off the cake! Lol
CAKEWIN,2aqqal,LittleBitOdd,3,Tue Jul 15 22:39:27 2014 UTC,In my opinion I think this type of cake NEEDS the little imperfections. A chalkboard always has some streaks and leftover chalk. It really adds to the design and I think you need a great job!
CAKEWIN,2aqqal,JulietLima,5,Tue Jul 15 12:14:18 2014 UTC,"I would change the border piping so it is a bit more elegant (as I'm assuming it is a wedding).   Fixing up the lettering so its more fancy. if you look up a website called Caravan Shoppe they have tonnes of chalkboard paintings. Just because its chalk doesn't mean it has to be messy.  The shape of the banner could be more even.   tbh, the cake looks like been rushed through."
CAKEWIN,2aqqal,sunshighnedaydreams,2,Tue Jul 15 15:28:44 2014 UTC,"It looks great! It looks a little less traditional compared to ""regular"" piped cakes, which might throw people off. It's beautiful!"
CAKEWIN,2aqqal,WC_BoBo_WC,2,Tue Jul 15 07:30:28 2014 UTC,"We always have a few of the more traditional, white on white or ivory on white kind of stuff, but you gotta have the attention-getting cakes as well.  Hopefully something another bakery doesn't have a similar cake of in their booth.  I guess just like in the fashion world, you need to stay on top of the trends.  Shabby chic is in."
CAKEWIN,2aqqal,WC_BoBo_WC,2,Tue Jul 15 07:42:41 2014 UTC,"It'd be perfect for a pair of teachers, or a couple who met when they were in school. I love it"

CAKEWIN,28zjf4,TonyDiGerolamo,3,Tue Jun 24 21:11:53 2014 UTC,"Well.... lots of time and energy? :)   I baked 4 8""round 1"" thick vanilla cakes (each a different colour) and then cut them in half and trimmed about an inch off of each side.  Then I made a form out of cardboard that was 4""x6""x4"" and brushed the inside with melted white chocolate to make a container for the candy.  Glued that down to the cake board with more white chocolate after I filled it with candy.  Stuck the cake halves on either side to make the body.  Formed the head and legs with rice krispie treats with a wooden dowel as supports in the middle.  Then I spent several hours cutting little strips of fondant and gluing them on with water while I marathon watched Disney movies all night.  That's the general gist of it, at least :)"

CAKEWIN,2913tt,Daedreamer,2,Wed Jun 25 04:22:34 2014 UTC,Fantastic. I would love this.
CAKEWIN,28yqc6,ayshasmysha,15,Tue Jun 24 13:44:39 2014 UTC,"The cupcakes are cute as hell, but your fondant work on the cakes needs improvement. I see lumpy fondant with cracks and imperfections.   Make sure your buttercream is smooth before applying fondant, and use a smoother on the fondant to get a nice flat finish. If the fondant is cracking, it might be too dry. If the cracking comes from having to stretch out the fondant to cover the cake without folds, you should probably have rolled out more of it. If you keep a clean work surface, surplus fondant can be reused. Watch out for fingernail dents, I can see a few. I tend to clip my fingernails right down before covering a cake, because it's so easy to hit the cake and leave a mark that you can't buff out. If you do make a dent, try to find a way to cover it with a decoration  You're doing well, but you definitely need more practice on covering cakes"
CAKEWIN,28yqc6,LittleBitOdd,3,Tue Jun 24 14:14:52 2014 UTC,What on earth are you talking about? This is clearly covered in fondant. As is this
CAKEWIN,28yqc6,LittleBitOdd,4,Tue Jun 24 16:07:48 2014 UTC,My mobile only showed the cupcakes...sorry.
CAKEWIN,28yqc6,toxicpretty,4,Tue Jun 24 16:10:10 2014 UTC,"good job, my only advice is to roll your fondant thinner for the decorations on your fondant cakes, i noticed they were too heavy on the batman one, other then looking cleaner, they will be less likely to fall off from weight. your cupcakes are lovely :) and i really like the chocolate with peach flowers"
CAKEWIN,28yqc6,cakeordeath333,2,Tue Jun 24 16:18:01 2014 UTC,"Love the cupcakes!  I have a question about the ones with the little fondant/gumpaste rosebuds as I'm about to do ones much like that... did you attach them to the fondant with a toothpick or just with some royal icing or something?  Your designs are all really creative.  /u/LittleBitOdd gave some great tips about covering your cakes.  I'm going to give you a tip about covering your boards.  The fact that you are covering them is good, it usually looks a lot more professional than the silver boards showing.  However, you have to clean up the edges!  On the Mickey Mouse and Batman boards, that was the thing I noticed even before the cake.  I always roll out a square/circle as big as the board, attach it to the board with some piping gel, and then run an xacto knife along the edge, vertically, to cut off the excess.  This leaves you with a clean edge of fondant.  Then you can attach a ribbon around the edge for the final touch.  Here is a great tutorial which is about how I do it: http://cakejournal.com/tutorials/how-to-cover-a-cake-board-with-rolled-fondant/  Keep it up! :)"
CAKEWIN,28yqc6,Shortkaik,1 point,Tue Jun 24 19:37:58 2014 UTC,Thank-you so much! I bought a pot of edible glue which I used. It seemed flimsy at first but they actually stuck on. For some of them I even used sugar water and they did the trick!  Covering the cake boads was frustrating because the edges crumbled away. I'm guessing adding ribbon helps stop this? I also wasn't rolling it out thick enough in the first place. When the cake board is really thin like it is in the Batman cake how can I cover the sides with ribbon? And if I can't then how do I stop the edges from crumbling?
CAKEWIN,28yqc6,jennjuice,1 point,Tue Jun 24 18:08:18 2014 UTC,This might be silly to say but I am a little overwhelmed by the likes and positive feedback! I'm glad you guys liked the cupcakes. :)   /u/LittleBitOdd are those fingernail marks on the Mickey Mouse cake? Because if so then they are a tear which I tried to patch up. But you;re right I know I've left a few fingernail marks which I've tried to prod out. I think the cracking on the Mickey Mouse cake is because I rolled the fondant out too thin and it just tore. I also have a problem with covering my cakes with buttercream anyway. Recently I've been able to do a nice smooth crumb coat. As I haven't done a fondant cake in a while I guess this would improve the overall look of the fondant covered cake. But whenever I add a second layer over the crumb layer I end up smoothing it all off! It's frustrating! In the future I will roll out more fondant. As I was making both these cakes I was frustrated by how little room I had left myself.  /u/cakeordeath333 I'm a little confused. I know that I rolled the Mickey Mouse fondant too thin and that's why it tore. You're saying that I rolled it out too thick in the Batman one which is causing it to tear? Is it the cape where this is happening or on the cake itself? Because I saw it cracking and I had no idea why. I thought I remedied the situation!  Thank-you for your feedback. I'm going to work on covering my cake more definitely. I'm so chuffed that you guys liked my stuff as well. :)

CAKEWIN,28f1wd,Caladriel,1 point,Wed Jun 18 08:48:26 2014 UTC,The only only thing I would say is make it early. And use gumpaste. Or add tylose powder to the fondant to help it dry faster. I made it too late so it was still soft when I delivered it. And had a little trouble with sagging

CAKEWIN,282apo,nesleinbor,3,Fri Jun 13 16:44:25 2014 UTC,What type of icing did you use for the pink & green?  And how did you get the square so flat?!!! I'm so jealous!  I'm working hard on that right now...  Beautiful job!
CAKEWIN,282apo,Nyemenya,4,Fri Jun 13 23:41:58 2014 UTC,"All of the frosting is Buttercream. For the sides and corners it just takes some time. Having good pans can get you the nice flat sides and sharp corners, or you can trim the sides down after you have it layered(I've had success with both). Buttercream is nice to work with because you can throw the project in the fridge for a few minutes and it sets up nice and firm, then you can use a bench scraper(or anything with a flat edge and a 90deg angle)dipped in hot water to smooth and level the sides and corners.   Hope this helps, and thanks!"

Whenever I've done a rainbow cake it's all been one flavour.  I've also always done rainbow layers, so making 6 or 7 different cakes and then icing in between and stacking them (here's one I made)"
CAKEWIN,27orih,Shortkaik,1 point,Mon Jun 9 13:59:13 2014 UTC,"For an average-sized cake it sounds like too many flavors. Strawberry and banana tend to be very strong flavors, so they will probably overpower the other fruit flavors. Also, if you make the layers equal width in a round cake pan, some layers are going to have a much greater volume. Something worth noting if you're going to try balancing the flavors."

CAKEWIN,26qhg1,tehFANCY,1 point,Fri May 30 00:56:20 2014 UTC,"I'm sure this is delicious, nicely executed.  But I am having a hard time getting behind the exposed layer thing.  Is it about less frosting?  Or less work?  Or what?"
CAKEWIN,26qhg1,tehFANCY,3,Thu May 29 19:32:31 2014 UTC,For me it was cause I wanted to feature the bits of rhubarb that were exposed so I guess it's an aesthetic thing! It didn't really use less frosting cause there was three layers of it and it was less work than doing a smooth frosting but that's to be expected
CAKEWIN,26qhg1,harper64,2,Fri May 30 00:59:03 2014 UTC,"Im having a hard time with that too. Honestly i believe the trend started from college girls who dont know how to smooth the sides of a cake. I mean yeah its pretty, but it seems lazy to me"
CAKEWIN,26pbb5,ibanezjerk,4,Wed May 28 15:39:05 2014 UTC,"Thinner layers are your best bet. My other piece of advice would be to use a meringue buttercream (be it Swiss, Italian, or French) because you can refrigerate it between adding layers. Once the buttercream is completely cold, it is very hard and solid, making it extremely stable when adding additional/denser layers."
CAKEWIN,26pbb5,megasus_,3,Wed May 28 17:29:56 2014 UTC,"I wouldn't build a whole stacked cake type of thing out of dense layers like brownies because the weight would be too heavy.  You could, however put in thin layers of brownies between cake layers."
CAKEWIN,26pbb5,LemonBomb,3,Wed May 28 16:20:19 2014 UTC,The weight was my primary concern. Good thought on the thinner layers though!
CAKEWIN,26pbb5,htreveth,2,Wed May 28 16:28:43 2014 UTC,I've done this before for my son. He wanted a Half-Life cake with brownie layers. The downside: the layers are so heavy and dense they are hard to stack and the frosting tends to be pushed out the sides of the layers. The only thing I would do differently is attempt to make the layers thinner...maybe freeze them and slice them thinner next time....? He did love it although it was too rich for me! :)

Don't be freaked by the near-liquid batter (I had a minor panic attack) it will still rise beautifully.   Even relatives who aren't fond of cake likes this. The Guinness taste is pretty subtle in the cake but it smells almost like baking bread when it's in the oven.

CAKEWIN,26hu7k,ktcakes,2,Mon May 26 03:46:29 2014 UTC,"When I do wood grain, I do a combination of texturizing and hand-painting. I either etch in the wood grain by hand or use a mat to emboss the design into the fondant. I then use gel color to hand-paint the wood. You can also use an airbrush if you have access to one."
CAKEWIN,26hu7k,StephieCupcakes,2,Mon May 26 05:11:10 2014 UTC,"For wood grain I usually use either brown food color or trablit coffee flavoring thinned out with kirsch/vodka. I brush it on with the cheapest crappiest most uneven brush I can find. Uneven bristles are the key. 2 strokes, 3 max.  You don't want uniform coverage, streaky coverage is best. Go in the same direction.  From the staple, I'd use a small sliver of fondant brushed with sliver or copper or metal colored luster dust. Use a modeling tool to make a small invention where the staple will go and then put the flat sliver in there so it's almost flush with the wood."
CAKEWIN,26hu7k,Angrybakersf,2,Mon May 26 14:38:25 2014 UTC,"Thinking about the staples....cut them, color them....the let them dry out a few days.   Easier to place them when they are hard and dry"
CAKEWIN,26hu7k,Angrybakersf,1 point,Mon May 26 14:39:55 2014 UTC,"The key is to not make it perfect. If you agonize over every line, you will get something that looks manufactured and less natural. You want streaky and uneven as opposed to symmetrical and smooth."

I feel like fresh fondant adheres to  buttercream a lot easier and doesn't end up sliding or slipping off the cake as easily...if it's something you have to make ahead of time and you leave drying out on a dummy cake, I end up using lots of decorating gel and then pop the cake in the fridge for 5 or 10 min to let the plaque set.

CAKEWIN,25k1wx,MyGargantuanPony,2,Thu May 15 00:16:59 2014 UTC,"Thank you!   Here is a quote from a previous post of mine:   This lovely video explains the technique much better than I ever could! It takes practice, and testing the buttercream on a piece of wax paper or something first before icing the cupcakes to see if it's what you're looking for. I did have to open up the bag a few times and re-ice the sides and middle if my ratio was off. I also think a big part of it is that my colors are so similar, the eye naturally blends them a little. I hope that helped!    Basically, I set my icing bag into a tall glass and folded over the edges of the glass so the icing bag would stand up + be open in the glass. Then I carefully spooned and squished the teal icing around the sides, and then dolloped the orange in the middle, and voila. WhenI take it out of the cup, I just try and squeeze it evenly out of the bag. In these photos, you can see I wasn't totally even because if I did it ""right"" the teal would outline all of the orange, but sometimes you can see there is only orange and no teal - oops! I did it a little better on cupcakes in pink + white in this post.   And we just sliced it a little bit ago... it was heavenly! The cake and icing is SO light and fluffy, it's like eating a cloud! And the cake is moist enough to not need the icing on the sides, either :)"

Especially the towers are really cool :)  If you want to have a small business or sell your cakes (which I'm assuming from the name over the photo's) I really  suggest you look into some basic product photography though! It's a shame to see such a nice cake look so drab in pictures. Two things that would help loads here:   A quiet, white background. A lot of people get a piece of white paper and tape it to get a nice smooth 'swoosh' behind the object, like so Blacks that are actually black and a good colour balance. You can most easily do this with an image editor (Pixlr.com is browser-based and free, you could also install Gimp). In Pixlr, you go to Adjustments > Curves, and click and drag the line until you have a bit of an s-shape (like the ones on the left here.    There's a whole lot more you could do to get super professional looking pictures if you wanted them, but with these two steps it should already be a lot better!

CAKEWIN,24yuk3,wannabebaker101,8,Wed May 7 20:14:51 2014 UTC,"Thanks a bunch!  They are the little sugar pearls (dragees.) For the green and purple pearls, I used gel dye and luster dust to match the wedding colors. I put the white pearls in a container, added a drop of gel dye, and shook until coated. Then, I through in some luster dust and shook again until the color was even. It really let me match the wedding colors perfectly. I recommend you start with a small amount of dye, as you can always add more."

CAKEWIN,24zahp,theproperpeach,2,Wed May 7 20:09:57 2014 UTC,"Yup, I think that one's a fondant cake, which is easier to cover in luster dust since it's a more, uh, solid surface. BUT, you can use luster dust on an iced cake too - just takes a more gentle touch. I'd suggest frosting the whole cake with a firm butercream, smoothing it out, then refrigerating it to let the icing solidify. Then you'd be able to brush the luster dust on, using a large-ish brush (fan brush?) and a light touch to avoid denting the surface.  I think there are luster sprays (like a can of spray paint) and airbrush products too."
CAKEWIN,24zahp,boo_hiss,1 point,Wed May 7 20:49:36 2014 UTC,Sadly I don't have an air brush.   Actually brushing the butter cream? Like brush on frosting? Will that cause streaking?
CAKEWIN,24zahp,boo_hiss,3,Wed May 7 20:59:04 2014 UTC,"You've gotta let the frosting harden up first, but it does work. Dry brush, thin dusting of powder on top of hardened frosting. To use a makeup analogy, it's like putting powder on top of foundation."
CAKEWIN,24zahp,thesongbirdy,2,Wed May 7 21:04:16 2014 UTC,"I use an airbrush now, but I've used the canned Wilton luster sprays before for the same effect. You need to be careful with that stuff, though, cause it can make your frosting taste like metal if you use too much."

My parents drove it in the back seat of their car in a doubled up banker box (I will try to post pictures later, our cake shop had a record breaking sales day and I still need to mop the floor and finish paperwork).  The cake was a central stack of chocolate with ganache and raspberry preserve.  Ganache on the outside (4kg in total of ganache) with fondant decorations.  It stood on Styrofoam with a central dowel.  The outside legs were crispy treats with 3/8"" dowels, ganache coating and fondant finish."

The hardest place to get to is Tofino, 2 mountain passes and a winding mountain road.  My partner always gets ill when we have to drive out there.  Also up to the top of Mt.Washington, starting at sea level and going up to 3600ft causes fondant cakes to inflate.  The first time it was a total shock to us. Since we started using the ganache technique the air pressure issues aren't as great and much less cracking."

I used different flavoured candy melts for the poured fondant (chocolate, vanilla (green coloured), peanut butter).  It was very time consuming though - I think with the baking, decorating and assembly it took about 12 hours."

Not unless that motherfucker's screwed to the board  My cake mentor recently made two full-sized dalek cakes that had to be driven over 100 miles to the venue. In order to have them arrive in decent condition, they used a metal internal structure, and everything was screwed together. Even so, they only ganached it before transport, because there was a worry it would settle during the journey and the fondant would crack.  The cake did indeed settle, it would've been destroyed if they'd added the fondant before transport  Moral of the story: it probably won't ship"

Best case it will have some cracks.  I already mashed the top but was saved by the center dowel, and we quickly replaced the blue fondant circle on the top.  The cake is on a foil covered drum on Styrofoam supports with a center dowel.  The outside legs are made of crispy treats that hide 1/2"" dowels, the whole thing is coated in about 3 layers of ganache and fondant.   *edit: the dowels are tapered on the end and match up with tapered holes in 5/8"" finished birch plywood."

It takes practice, and testing the buttercream on a piece of wax paper or something first before icing the cupcakes to see if it's what you're looking for. I did have to open up the bag a few times and re-ice the sides and middle if my ratio was off. I also think a big part of it is that my colors are so similar, the eye naturally blends them a little.

CAKEWIN,241ifu,ankaba04,2,Sat Apr 26 19:12:00 2014 UTC,"It does make a difference - baking really is all about chemistry! I too have a family member who is lactose intolorant, and for quite a while I was baking completely vegan. I used recipes from Vegan Cupcakes Take Over the World, which is an excellent nondairy recipe book! I didn't tell anyone that the cupcakes I made were vegan and they couldn't ""tell"" either; the recipes were honestly delicious. Not having any dairy in them was just an added bonus!   The vegan vanilla buttercream frosting in the book is the same as this one, which I highly recommend:    INGREDIENTS  1/2 cup nonhydrogenated shortening  1/2 cup nonhydrogenated margarine (like Earth Balance)  3 1/2 cups powdered sugar, sifted if clumpy  1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract  1/4 cup plain soy milk or soy creamer  INSTRUCTIONS  Beat the shortening and margarine together until well combined and fluffy. Add the sugar and beat for about 3 more minutes. Add the vanilla and soy milk, and beat for another 5 to 7 minutes until fluffy.   Just check the labels of the shortening and margarine to make sure they contain no dairy/animal products and you should be good to go. The real trick is to beat it for as long as it states - that's 3 full minutes to combine shortening and margarine, another 3 mins after that, and another 5 to 7 minutes after adding the rest of the ingredients - that's like 12 to 16 minutes total of just mixing alone.   I haven't had a chemistry class in a while but I think the amount of beating has to do with several factors important to buttercream, like it makes it stiffer and gets rid of air bubbles, etc. I skipped out on beating it for the full time once and it was a huge mess - gooey and runny and not as delicious as when I beat it fully.   Hopefully that helps you a bit! Feel free to PM me if you have any more questions or if you try it and it works/doesn't work out for you :) Happy baking!"

She was very meticulous - great cake decorating really does fall down to the details.    The ears were made from thinly rolled fondant, cut out into the shape of ears, and then laid to dry over rolled up cylinders of tinfoil/plastic wrap to get the shape right. Then before they went on the head, I brushed the inside with powdered food color. Eyes are black jelly beans, and the carrots and nose are handmade from fondant."
CAKEWIN,22tcy8,Smiley_shark,2,Sat Apr 12 01:16:56 2014 UTC,"Thanks for the tip! I definitely comes down to details, and I just love your cake. I always make a bunny cake for Easter, but yours is awesome. I might have to try something new this year!"
CAKEWIN,22tcy8,Smiley_shark,1 point,Mon Apr 14 04:14:05 2014 UTC,"Give it a go! It wasn't very difficult, you just have to be happy with the shape before you start piping.    The body is 2 stacked 6-inch round cakes, beveled and with scraps stacked on top for more roundness. The legs are twinkies! The head shape, as a matter of fact is this bear with his ears and legs trimmed off, and turned so that his butt is pretty much the bunny's face. You will have to trim the cake a little further to get the slope for the bunny's nose and such, but it's nice to work with a whole cake rather than try to manipulate scraps.    I used that same mold for my Cookie Monster cake. It's pretty versatile, and not super expensive, especially if you pick it up from a Michaels store with a half-off coupon!"

CAKEWIN,21tx1s,kheather,3,Mon Mar 31 14:43:37 2014 UTC,"Try using a small paintbrush with a dab of water to get rid of the 'tails' left on your dots.  I just get simple kid's ones and chop off most of the bristles, it will help to keep your work tidy. You can also use it on your suspended icing connections to blend the blobs together.  I would suggest that you dont need as big blobs at the start/finish of your suspended lines, alternatively adding a decorative feature on top would make it look a lot tidier - It's only particularly noticable due to the colour changes.  Your shells look brilliant and evenly spaced, so well done on that! I know its something I struggled with while started out, I'd often have to take the whole lot off and start again.   Your piping along the bottom of the cake could do to be a bit more evenly spaced, but overall it looks fine.  From what I can see your runout looks smooth, no obvious bubbles or blemishes, so again, excellent on that bit!  Your triple dots could have done to have used a smaller pipe, and again, using a damp paintbrush to smooth out the peaks would definitely help with making them more uniform all the way around.  Please note I'm writing from a judges perspective, and assuming you want constructive critism to help get better, if I'm being harsh I do apologise, I love to see people using traditional mediums as apposed to all the fondants that everyone uses these days!  Some parts are excellent and definitely dont look like begginer's work, but other parts could do with a little tweaking to give you a push in the right direction.  Sorry if I've over-stepped my mark by offering this critque, but if you have any questions, I'll do my best to answer! Well done on a lovely cake anyway :)"

Cake decorating is serious business!! Ok, not that serious, but I'd love it if it were a little less cartoony and pastel.    I also appreciate when the sidebar has links to related subreddits. Maybe /r/baking or /r/cookiedecorating? Heck, even /r/foodporn or /r/DessertPorn.   Maybe we could introduce themed days? Like, I dunno, New Technique Tuesdays, where we share tutorials around a specific technique. /u/fredbutt often has some very nice designs he shares with the baking subreddit (and I know that sometimes /r/baking gets a little up in arms about how cake decorating is lovely, but does it really belong in that subreddit...), so it might be nice to invite him to cross post here and educate some of us aspiring cake decorators.

Doing it yourself pays off because then you don't have to explain your ideas to anyone."

I feel it works better than sugarveil, and you bake it too which speeds up time. Mine is still in great condition from 10 months ago in a ziploc bag. :)   Just to add also, lovely cake i am so into the colors!!"
CAKEWIN,21qpp4,angienuthead,1 point,Mon Mar 31 08:13:26 2014 UTC,Yeah I had to bake the sugarveil on the lowest heat with the door open to dry it out properly. I will check out the Bowman one though. I've had a few people ask me to make them a cake now.   Gelati colours always look good.

CAKEWIN,21pnry,jessikate,2,Sun Mar 30 13:30:07 2014 UTC,"They said the product used was Sugarveil. I looked that one up earlier and wondered if that was it.

CAKEWIN,21pnry,Nikki4321,2,Sun Mar 30 17:29:24 2014 UTC,"Yup, it's really straightforward and easy. The mat itself was pretty pricey, which sucks.

CAKEWIN,21k48l,thatsme_daedae,3,Fri Mar 28 01:38:51 2014 UTC,"I've been making my own marshmallow fondant for years with a similar recipe. I can't imagine putting that much shortening directly into the melted marshmallow (or that much water) and have it taste like anything but straight grease. Likewise, be careful with using sugar directly on the countertop that way. Your fondant WILL stick to it at some point, usually at the worst possible time. After some tips I gleaned from various internet sources, I found a recipe using the same amount of marshmallow, 2T water, and then mixing the sugar in after you melt the marshmallow. Put cornstarch on the counter, grease up your hands, and knead. Doesn't need to rest that way, and never sticks to the counter."
CAKEWIN,21k48l,geekchicgrrl,2,Fri Mar 28 04:40:29 2014 UTC,So you use half the water and don't grease the countertop but otherwise it's the same recipe?
CAKEWIN,21k48l,alittleperil,3,Fri Mar 28 05:25:35 2014 UTC,"I wish I could link to the recipe, but I have no clue where I found it originally. I can walk you through, though. Take the marshmallows in a big bowl, add 1T of water, microwave in 30 second bursts until they're gooey, add more water if needed one teaspoon at a time. Stir in the powdered sugar until the marshmallow can hold no more, tip it out on a cornstarched countertop, and knead with greased hands until pliable and smooth. If you store it for any length of time between making and using, cover it in crisco so it doesn't get dry, but avoid putting it in the fridge.   Granted, it's hard work to stir in the powdered sugar this way, but it's easy if you have a stand up mixer. If you try to work in the sugar the way the linked recipe states, you start with a huge gooey mess that sticks to everything and melts the crisco on the counter, and then sticks to the counter repeatedly because it's melted or absorbed all of the sugar and there's no barrier left."
CAKEWIN,21k48l,geekchicgrrl,1 point,Fri Mar 28 05:41:12 2014 UTC,"Do you think that a hand-held mixer could also work? Also, thank you both for your recipes!! I've been thinking about making fondant for a while but I haven't actually tried it yet. These seem simple and cheap, which I love!"
CAKEWIN,21k48l,banannann3,1 point,Fri Mar 28 16:42:05 2014 UTC,"It might work for the first stages of incorporation, but I think it would burn your motor out before long. The mixture gets really thick and stiff before it really is able to be turned out without making a mess. A silicone coated spoon and elbow grease is probably your best bet, honestly."
CAKEWIN,21k48l,geekchicgrrl,1 point,Fri Mar 28 16:55:07 2014 UTC,"The shortening was just for making the countertop greasy so the fondant doesnt stick and is easier to work with, it doesnt actually go into the fondant, but im sure cornstarch or the like would do just as well... I didnt have cornstarch on hand thats why i used the shortening. And after i kneaded, all of the sugar was picked up and the shortening was still on my stovetop... :) I also thought that was alot of water but it it worked fine, you pour the water over the marshmallows before you microwave."
CAKEWIN,21k48l,sweetzwytch,4,Fri Mar 28 14:37:44 2014 UTC,"I love this fondant method! Puts the store-bought to shame. The cake is gorgeous too!  If you ever have a need for brown fondant, peanut butter goes really well in the mixture. Cocoa will dry it out too quickly, but chocolate almond bark works well too!

If you're serious about building your portfolio, get those business cards! Give them to friends and family, and they can give them out if cakes come up.

Building a page and asking Facebook friends to share and support your business is fine. Make your motives clear, though.

CAKEWIN,20kbgw,heIlogoodbye,2,Sun Mar 16 21:55:15 2014 UTC,Well done! Looks like your wife has some experience.
CAKEWIN,20kbgw,ldeandyment,2,Sun Mar 16 22:14:33 2014 UTC,Is she a pro? That is damn fine work.
CAKEWIN,20kbgw,UnKamenRider,2,Sun Mar 16 23:30:06 2014 UTC,Nope just a hobby. She's made some cakes for people who sought her out but she does everything at home. I roll fondant. That's the extent of my helping!  Glad you like! All the comments are helping me convince her she needs to do this more often!
CAKEWIN,20kbgw,UnKamenRider,2,Sun Mar 16 23:41:16 2014 UTC,"Well, I am a pro (used to be, anyway. Forced to retire due to illness), and it's pretty fantastic, in my opinion. I know professionals that can't do that."
CAKEWIN,20kbgw,UnKamenRider,1 point,Mon Mar 17 00:44:02 2014 UTC,Showed her your comment - thank you so much! She loves it and I've been telling her to go for it. No clue where to even start!
CAKEWIN,20kbgw,LittleBitOdd,3,Mon Mar 17 01:22:26 2014 UTC,"I went to culinary school. It cost a lot. I don't suggest that. They do cake courses at hobby stores. Read books, watch YouTube videos, and start small by making cakes for friends and family. It's easy to get overwhelmed. It's easy to put way more work into a cake than you get out (I.e. twenty hours of work into a $50 cake). Don't underestimate what your time is worth, but try to be reasonable with the price at the same time. It's easy to burn out, so try to have fun! I hope it helps."

CAKEWIN,20elxr,Snickersaw943,2,Fri Mar 14 14:53:23 2014 UTC,Thanks again! I ended up using plastic support as i was worried about the hot glue melting the styrofoam. http://imgur.com/a/MkWeW
CAKEWIN,20elxr,toxicpretty,1 point,Fri Mar 14 15:59:39 2014 UTC,This would actually be perfect. I could do the styrofoam in the middle where the brackets are going to be anyways and those brackets would probably cover up the styrofoam support. You genius :) thanks!
CAKEWIN,20elxr,toxicpretty,3,Sat Mar 22 19:16:29 2014 UTC,"Best way to anchor a dowel is to use a screw.  I've included a sketch to illustrate. First, drill into the board a tiny amount with a bit that is the the width of the dowel. Pre-drill both the dowel and the board with a bit equal to the width of the screw shaft(NOT the spirally cut edge). Then screw together....with or without glue for added anchoring. You can even skip the pre-drilling for the width of the dowel on the board but it will not be as secure. http://i.imgur.com/z3MDe6C.jpg"

CAKEWIN,20elxr,Pulchritudinous_Imp,3,Sat Mar 15 21:17:40 2014 UTC,Instead of the dowels being flat rods why not try having them be shaped more with a curve on the top so the scope can rest in the curve instead of needing to be adhered?
CAKEWIN,20ceko,odinisthelord,4,Thu Mar 13 20:10:34 2014 UTC,"Wow, the lighting from the candles makes this cake almost look like a painting.  Very unique subject matter, did you make this?"

CAKEWIN,20847p,kduluth,4,Wed Mar 12 12:49:06 2014 UTC,I took Toba Garrett's Oriental Stringwork class and it was amazing. I am not a beginner to cake but I am to this type of decorating.
CAKEWIN,20847p,bakedNdelicious,2,Wed Mar 12 12:50:55 2014 UTC,These drop strings are incredible! Do you let the icing set and then add them on for the arches?
CAKEWIN,20847p,bakedNdelicious,2,Wed Mar 12 14:14:26 2014 UTC,No. I turned the cake upside down!!  The arches are all done right on the cake.
CAKEWIN,20847p,flaminfunyun,2,Wed Mar 12 17:19:43 2014 UTC,Wow. You are very talented! That is amazing and I hope I can be that good one day!
CAKEWIN,20847p,Caffeinated_Caker,2,Wed Mar 12 17:23:52 2014 UTC,I looove the craftsy classes! I've been intimidated by this one since I'm not amazing at piping? Is it easier than it looks is should I take a different piping class first?
CAKEWIN,20847p,ours_de_sucre,3,Wed Mar 12 18:15:54 2014 UTC,Having some previous piping experience doesn't hurt but she makes it easy and is so calm which mimimized my own stress levels. Plus if you screw up you just keep trying til you get it right. It's ok to mess up since you can take it off and repipe!
CAKEWIN,20847p,ours_de_sucre,2,Wed Mar 12 19:00:10 2014 UTC,Beautiful work! I've done this before and it's quite scary turning your cake upside down!
CAKEWIN,20847p,LittleBitOdd,2,Wed Mar 12 23:26:16 2014 UTC,Did you have to freeze the cake first since it looks like its buttercream? I've only ever seen string work like that on fondant cakes.

CAKEWIN,200afi,LalaLovee,7,Mon Mar 10 00:36:22 2014 UTC,"What are you using to stick on the flowers? I think I see some greenish frosting of some sort. A little vodka or water will dissolve the sugar enough that it'll stick to the fondant without leaving a mess like frosting does. Also, most of us can't afford a steamer to melt that powdered sugar, so I use a spray bottle on super fine mist and spray the whole thing down. It'll get really shiny at first, but within a few hours it'll dry back up, with no powdered sugar residue! I think your first try is very good. The flowers are cute (though, don't be afraid to pinch the edges of the petals, with clean hands!, to make them thin, if you're wanting to make it look a little more realistic). I like that the flowers are placed on  asymmetrically, it adds a bit of whimsy to it. Keep working at it, if this is your first try, I'd say you have natural talent. You'll see yourself getting better and better as you keep going!"
CAKEWIN,200afi,Wondawful,1 point,Mon Mar 10 02:55:28 2014 UTC,Thank you! I did you my buttercream icing to stick them on. I never knew vodka would work.  I will try that with my next project.
CAKEWIN,200afi,Maraudentium,2,Mon Mar 10 02:58:13 2014 UTC,"If you need to use icing to stick it (sometimes, it's too heavy), royal icing is the superglue of the cake world. :)"
CAKEWIN,200afi,Wondawful,6,Sat Mar 22 17:57:39 2014 UTC,"The flowers look a bit unfinished. You've got the very nice looking flowers with three layers of petals with the pearl candy(?) in them as the anther, but then you have numerous flowers with just one layer of petals. Adding another layer and/or the pearl candy (like in the bottom right) to more of those flowers would make the cake look a lot more finished."
CAKEWIN,200afi,Angrybakersf,3,Mon Mar 10 17:47:13 2014 UTC,"I see some cracking in your fondant and some bubbles/bunching at the bottom. I find it cracks when you didn't knead it enough and I used to get a lot of it when I used icing sugar to roll it out. Turns out, vegetable shortening on your hands and the work surface works a ton better to prevent sticking and it keeps it pliable.   As for the bubbling/bunching on the bottom, make sure you lift up the fondant a bit before you make it stick to the sides; that prevents it from stretching down under its own weight, which means less bunching at the bottom. Then, using scissors or a good knife, cut off the excess to about 1/2 inch extra before you rub it in place to remove the air underneath and make it slick. Then, you can trim to its finished length and smooth it over to its final shape. Also, make sure that your buttercream is not too soft and is really even before you put the fondant on, to prevent it sliding off or having to work it too much to make it look smooth. Don't let it dry before you wrap.    That's what I learnt from my mistakes. That being said, you did really well :)  Edit: icing sugar works well in the summer (it's humid here) but shortening is great in the winter if your fondant gets dry and cracks."
