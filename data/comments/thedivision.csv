thedivision,3e00kb,LuxSolisPax,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:23:38 2015 UTC,The problem I have with stealth in this game is the prospect of losing gear as a result of getting shanked.
thedivision,3e00kb,Sairoks,2,Tue Jul 21 06:54:40 2015 UTC,"Well stealth is more than shanking someone. Also adding takedown from behind only would make it so it is your fault for being stupid and not being aware of your surrounding. Only gear you can lose would be the dz stuff.  In a nutshell stealth and ""shanking"" would add more depth to combat and more diverse situations. Also you would be able to recognize skilled players from sprayers more easily.  Also i don't really listen what owg has to say, feels like it's 99% speculation at this point and misleading arguments, for example in this video he said The Division is aiming for same type of gameplay as Destiny. Yet devs have said it 100 times they are not going to do that."
thedivision,3e00kb,LuxSolisPax,2,Tue Jul 21 11:12:23 2015 UTC,It's not always a matter of being stupid when you're unaware of your surroundings. What if you're distracted by an NPC or another player? Can you imagine how annoying it would be to get stabbed in the middle of an encounter? It also wouldn't be a terribly difficult task to simply wait until someone was in the middle of an encounter before making a move.  We also don't know what skills are available to mask your presence. I can't help but feel that there was a strong reason as to why melee takedowns were removed from the game.
thedivision,3e00kb,Sairoks,2,Tue Jul 21 14:08:19 2015 UTC,"Alright, stupid might not be the right word here, sorry about that. I also agree that if the ""cloacking"" ability is still in the game it would be overpowered atleast in 1v1.   We have a little misunderstanding here, i meant that during firefight you have to be aware of your surrounding all the time or you are going to die.  When you are normally looking forward your field of view in real life is around 95 degrees, that leaves 265 degrees out of your field where enemies can flank you or just appear from other group. Atleast when you are less experienced in shooting you are going to have tunnel vision especially when looking at your target so the area you are not able to see is even larger. Doesn't matter if someone comes with knife or just guns, you can't do anything unless you make sure you are aware of your surroundings all the time.  My point was that if there would be a takedown it would help people who go against 1v2 or even 1v3 if you are able to takedown 1 guy right at the start, but that means you must be in position where you can approach and hope you won't be seen. That would add depth to the combat and increase the skillcap which i would really like.  Edit: We actually were able to pull up 5 to 7 targets to small squads to their ~3-4o'clock who had very basic training but knew how to advance etc. Whole point of that was to show them what happens when you just look at the targets popping in front of you. Just to clarify that i know what i'm talking about :)"
thedivision,3dujhy,chemx32,5,Sun Jul 19 16:46:14 2015 UTC,"I loved this year's E3 presentations and news for this game except the fact it won't have any takedowns and has almost no way of integrating stealth.  For me, RPG is about options, not only options to change to outcome of a story, dialogue options but option of approach. Without stealth, since we have the only option can be go in guns blazing or avoid enemies, and this might affect the longevity of the game.  But, with the current system they can at least add, a damage bonus on sneak attacks, sort of like Fallout"
thedivision,3dujhy,A_Fhaol_Bhig,6,Sun Jul 19 16:52:03 2015 UTC,"RPG is about options   Yeah but within reason.   Without stealth, since we have the only option can be go in guns blazing or avoid enemies, and this might affect the longevity of the game.   I would assume that strategically setting up positions while avoiding line of sight and then engaging the fire fight with superior lines of sight and first hits would be pretty much stealth in of it self."
thedivision,3dujhy,Sairoks,3,Sun Jul 19 18:35:53 2015 UTC,"As i will probably play alone a lot. If i would go for 1v4 irl i'd try to kill one without others knowing or noticing right away, so i gain small advantage. Everyone knows this stuff if they have ever been in military. The most unrealistic thing is to start a firefight against 4 people with assaultrifles when you are alone and behind some cover. Good luck getting away from there."

thedivision,3dujhy,JokerUnique,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:42:53 2015 UTC,The question is if the tank has special abilities to taunt or if the only way to hold aggro is just to keep shooting the mobs.

thedivision,3dujhy,Xedeth,0,Sun Jul 19 19:03:45 2015 UTC,"I'm not. You said tank uses something loud and proud, and DPS uses something that doesn't pull aggro. But if you use a suppressor, and it's similar to other games where suppressors = less damage, then you'll never put one on a DPS because DPS goes for the most damage possibly, even if it gets them killed. Hence the term, ""glass cannon."" It will just make the job of a tank extra difficult. But if a tank is using something that adds extra aggro, and the DPS are using things that don't add or take away aggro, then the tank is still going to pull aggro. I didn't miss the point, I just may have made my original one unclear. :)"

thedivision,3dujhy,AngryKoltova,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:36:59 2015 UTC,"I never said anything about DPS. This isn't WoW, and I don't think roles are going to work like that. The tank isn't just standing up taking damage while ""DPSers"" ""DPS"", this is a shooter. The tank fires and pulls agro but stays in cover, moving around to pop shots and keep agro while people with suppressors flank. The suppressors make it so the flanking members can attack without pulling agro, maintaining good positioning without getting fired back on. I believe that the tank could probably use any weapon as long as it's loud to keep agro, even a pistol. At the end of the day though, it's all speculation and you could be right.  Edit: and sorry if I'm coming off like a dick. I say nothing with the intention of malice."
thedivision,3dujhy,tifugod,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:20:14 2015 UTC,"Actually the devs have confirmed Tank, DPS, and Healer roles. It's definitely a little weird considering this is Tom Clancy."
thedivision,3dujhy,Xedeth,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:55:45 2015 UTC,"You can't keep using the word ""tank,"" and then turn around saying there aren't roles like DPS. In EVERY game that has ""tanks"" there are ""healers"" (which there also are, they are called supports, it's in the gameplay videos), and there are ""dps,"" the people who spec for damage and take the items that increase their damage while being negligent towards their health.   And while this is a ""shooter,"" it's an RPG first, and that reinforces the same idea of three specialized roles. While there are even more specific things you can spec, such as mentioned in this, sniper(?), rusher(?), and something I couldn't understand."
thedivision,3dujhy,AngryKoltova,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:30:40 2015 UTC,"You are right, I can't use the term tank. I guess my point is that I don't think combat is going to play out like an RPG, I have a feeling its going to play more like Army of Two with RPG elements. everyone does about the same damage, but skills set apart the roles. Its not really as stratified as DPS/Healer/Tank, but just agents that are better at one thing than another.  edit: this is a little late but why are you so sure a suppressor will be a significant DPS loss. Its not really realistic, and is only like that in shooters with fast TTKs to balance them out"
thedivision,3dujhy,JokerUnique,2,Sun Jul 19 19:39:54 2015 UTC,Roles and the holy trinity are in the game there is a tank role a dps role and a healer role. There are specifig buffs for these roles and they are important for the combat. So even though it probably wont be implemented as pure as im wow etc but it will be important in combat

Thing is, with a gamey type stealth mechanic, it would be almost required for DZ play."
thedivision,3dujhy,JokerUnique,6,Mon Jul 20 17:57:27 2015 UTC,"People seem to forget what this game is. This is no tactical shooter, this is no sniper-simulation and it is not splinter cell or any other single-player game like DeusEx. This is an co-op shooter, an RPG and with character progressions like this, it should not be possible to get one-shot-kills. Also stealth was never confirmed a way to play it. Sure there could be an Optical Cloak but that was never officially confirmed to be in the game. They stated it would be interesting to see a player do missions with stealth tactics but it was never stated that there will be multiple ways to beat a mission (like in Deus Ex where you could finish the game without one kill).  So as of now we have aggro indicator (the big exclamation point that fills up) and with that you can avoid mobs and unnecessary combat) At night the player is even more difficult get detected. So IMO this is how far stealth gameplay goes in this game. Silencer and all that good stuff is probably more accuracy and that's it."
thedivision,3dujhy,tifugod,4,Mon Jul 20 07:57:59 2015 UTC,"I think it's definitely surprising when people learn that this is designed to be an MMO, not a Tom Clancy tactical shooter.   And even though the devs didn't clearly state they would have stealth gameplay, I think it's implied in some of the gameplay videos. An early video shows a stealth takedown, and in a recent video you see a female character hiding in the dark on one side of a corridor while enemies are at the other side having a nice cheery conversation. I don't know what the devs were trying to showcase in that scene if it wasn't stealth."
thedivision,3dujhy,IhazEpicSkillz,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:00:17 2015 UTC,"If there is a ""stealth mode"" to perform tactical takedowns, it will likely be similar to Batman, Call of Duty, or Splinter Cell where there are ""pre-configured"" scenes in which you can eliminate an entity silently. This is accomplished by pressing a certain button/button configuration once in a defined position in the game play. These are usually tied in with a Story Mode. These never transitioned to multiplayer game play (never played splinter cell multiplayer, so I could be wrong) That is my thought process on it. Sources: Years of game play (personal) and software development (professional)"
thedivision,3dujhy,benyfur,6,Mon Jul 20 22:30:14 2015 UTC,There doesnt really need to be stealth. Think about it its a coop game everyones talking; like he said if someone gets shot people will know. theres still plenty of ways to play. Look at the Last of Us theres not really stealth because of listen mode but theres still stealth aspects.I personally dont like melee's in games because theyre either 1 hit kills or pretty useless.  The removal of melee keeps people from rushing you turning a game of strategy into a 3 second massacre.
thedivision,3dujhy,FinaleNinja,2,Sun Jul 19 20:28:11 2015 UTC,"I keep thinking about the idea that most other MMO's don't really do melee as a means of a takedown/one hit kill kind of thing. I think the devs are going for more of a MMO feel than tactical shooter feel. Though they stayed away from saying MMO specifically. I think they want to define a new genre. Since there are no strict classes in the game I would assume there would be a stealth skill of some sort. Critical damage makes more sense in an MMO than stealth takedowns, meaning you do more damage based on a percentage if you are stealthed or catch the opponent off guard. I do think that melee could still provide an advantage if they wanted to include it. My idea is that Melee could knock down an opponent leaving them vulnerable for follow up attacks with some sort of timer set for recovery. One that can be shortened with gear."

(seen in the E3 demo) so you have the ability to avoid groups like these if you are not seen and you stay in cover.   And when you play solo you just have to adapt your tactics. Pull them one by one - or kite them around the buildings and stuff. It is harder but it is possible. Only because there is no stealth take-downs there are still ways to move around the map undetected. Maybe we even get a stun-gun do disable NPCs....   But yea that is just PvE - PvP won't run like this. The only way to stay undetected there is with the Optical Cloak (shown in the behind closed door - demo, but as of now it is not sure if this skill is in the final game)"

thedivision,3dltf7,JokerUnique,1 point,Fri Jul 17 09:12:35 2015 UTC,"According to MarcoStyle's video about this topic it will work like this. The higher the wpn lvl, the higher its dmg is."
thedivision,3dltf7,QXARE,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:34:41 2015 UTC,"The higher the wpn lvl, the higher its dmg is.   This doesn't really mean anything though. In some games, like Mass Effect 3's MP, a level one can fight alongside a level 20 character against the same enemies reasonably well because the guns hit with comparable amounts of damage, the powers gap is less than an order of magnitude with spell effects (generally speaking, grenades might be an exception). Other games, like Borderlands, a max level character can do hundreds of thousands of times more damage per second than a level one character and it would NEVER make sense for those characters to play together. What matters is what kind of power growth the game follows."
thedivision,3dltf7,Dreadius,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:22:05 2015 UTC,"If I remember right, the hp/strength/levels of enemies are based on your average group stats, mainly the level of each member."

Then the actual game came out and i was flabbergasted by how little was actually in the main game. Just hope that The Division doesn't do the same."

thedivision,3dhhfa,TimmyTurnerXI,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:33:02 2015 UTC,I think this is the curse of these types of games. It takes so much effort to get the design and all the systems right that you ultimately have a framework for a lot of fun gameplay but there isn't much time left to fill it with interesting content before the game launches. Really hope The Division doesn't fall into that trap.
thedivision,3dhhfa,Joker328,0,Thu Jul 16 17:51:38 2015 UTC,"well, i have yet to play a bad Tom Clancy game so my hopes are high that it won't. The game looks fantastic tho.

In addition to that, we have no official statement if every graphic-option is active or if the textures are final. IMO it has room for improvement, when I compair it to recent next-gen games like Witcher but, to really judge the game, i need to see it live."

thedivision,3dj4su,Grifsnacks,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:00:55 2015 UTC,"It's definitely interesting how riled up the community gets. What intrigues me is that the people claiming foul on the Division getting a visual downgrade may be the same people who get top end video cards yet play on a mere 24"" monitor. Not even utilizing half of the power of a gtx Titan for example.   For us that work in animation as a hobby we look at that kind of phenomena with sheer amusement. People getting butt hurt basically without getting a full picture themselves first."

thedivision,3dj4su,jackennils,2,Thu Jul 16 18:55:02 2015 UTC,"Eh don't worry too much about it. You're allowed to express your own opinion after all. It just seems that whenever a subject of ""downgrade"" comes prior to a game's release, the community implodes and chaos ensues. Essentially, people like to pick and choose when certain things are the ""most important"". So many people are biased, and everyone always changes their opinion, so why try to argue?  When it comes down to it, no dev company likes to downgrade visuals. Most of the time, it happens due to performance issues, with the odd one out occurring due to marketing and business crap (Watch Dogs). It is a reality of game dev, and it is useless trying to find a downgrade when comparing two drastically different short gamely segments in two drastically different environments, weather conditions, lighting conditions, and systems altogether.  All in all, you just keep being you, but let's all as a community try to calm the heck down just a bit!"

thedivision,3dj4su,jackennils,2,Thu Jul 16 19:36:13 2015 UTC,"Of course it is your opinion and that's totally ok. But the question is: What downgrade? We never saw Xbox One graphics before, so how can you compare? It's impossible."
thedivision,3dj4su,ropeadoped,-3,Thu Jul 16 19:06:50 2015 UTC,"That is something i somewhat tried to cover in the video, i do say that at E3 2013 it was The equivalent of a beastly PC which it was, and that this is the 1st time we have seen Xbox gameplay.

I said this in another post here and I'll repeat it; you're going to be so infatuated with finding out more about this game that you're going to create a completely different and amazing game inside your head that's got every single thing you want in it, and it will be nothing like the game that you actually get.   I didn't watch your video and I don't have any plans to. I really don't give a damn what people will whine about next in the context of this game; I pre-ordered it on Amazon to get into the Beta, and if I don't like what I see, I will cancel my pre-order before March.   Quite frankly, instead of obsessing and whining about differences in 2 years worth of tech demos, that's what you should be doing. Wait for the beta, draw your own conclusions, and that's that."

Just the beta - that way I can play it on the different platforms and decide which platform i prefer it on and purchase it for that platform...
thedivision,3dd61b,mitooil,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:34:10 2015 UTC,It would be nice yes especially as it is a beta. For them though it means more money the more platforms you need to buy it on. I actually expected the key to be restricted to the platform you preordered on.
thedivision,3dd61b,le0wyatt,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:33:31 2015 UTC,"I thought so too, until I gave it a second thought.  It's much easier to generate one set of keys for all platforms and specify the platform during redemption.  then again, uplay does a lot of cross platform things, like one uplay account for PC/PS/XBOX, that's why I have the feeling now, that one key, once bound to a uplay account, might work on all platforms"

Trying to find any developer-published in-depth information is very very hard.  I think it's about time they release more features, at least in blog form if not a YouTube video.  One thing is developer interviews, but until I see something in writing, I don't believe it."

Stop getting so hyped. Stop spending time obsessing over every piece of info you can find about this game. Trust me on this; you'll create a game in your head that you think you're going to see and it will be impossibly more complex than what you're going to actually get.  Step back and take a break from the information and rumor-speculation overload. Just wait for the Beta, and take it for what it is.   I paid no attention to the headlines when Watch Dogs came out. I didn't get hyped for it, I didn't obsess over it, I simply picked it up when it was only $25, and you know what? I enjoyed the hell out of it. I didn't give a shit about what Ubisoft may or may not have said or shown at demos, I didn't care about the graphics (they looked great to me), and I just enjoyed it for what it was.   Online video game media can literally be the death of your enjoyment of a game if you let it go unchecked to the levels that you're hitting on the Division.   Breathe. Do something else for a few weeks and then come back to it."

thedivision,3d8dhe,chemx32,1 point,Wed Jul 15 09:10:24 2015 UTC,I'm with you there.
thedivision,3d8dhe,PlayerThirty,3,Thu Jul 16 06:27:48 2015 UTC,"Depends on what you call the ""meat"" of this game. If you are referring to the story, in-game choices, and missions I think they will be revealed a bit later.  There are still 8 months before the release, its not impossible that they would want to have some surprises or reveals of new stuff to generate pre-release hype and not give everything away.  Other than that we had a lot of new info previous month, like How the DZs work, RPG elements such as stasis effects, specialties, loot driven character progression, new factions, confirmation of raids, rough estimate of The Dark Zone bounds and map size.   Keeping all this in mind I wouldn't be worried just yet"
thedivision,3d8dhe,chemx32,1 point,Tue Jul 14 09:51:59 2015 UTC,confirmation of raids   It's finally been confirmed? Great
thedivision,3d8dhe,GratefulUser,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:58:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it was in one of the Q&As if I am not horribly wrong. But to be fair, since raids are ""multiple groups working towards same objective"", every mission and extraction inside Dark Zones are technically raids"
thedivision,3d8dhe,tifugod,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:20:20 2015 UTC,"As far I have heard it has not been, you can't really be going around spreading information like ""Raids being confirmed"" unless you can find that info.  If it would be a hassle to find the one little Q&A session where a single dev may have slipped it out I think its indicative of it not being something they are talking about yet. Thus I'm skeptical of its existence at all.  My points stand. In terms of factions we have Cleaners and Rikers, Rikers are new, granted however Cleaners are not. The Dark Zone size has only been guessed at by Youtubers again, not confirmed."
thedivision,3d8dhe,Kiwi_Force,3,Sun Jul 19 21:04:46 2015 UTC,"I can't shake the feeling that Ubisoft is trying to overcorrect here. They had an abysmal launch with Unity/Watch Dogs, games where details were out years in advance.  That and my crystal ball tells me they're going to delay the Division. I got the same vibes around the Watch Dogs (first) release date."
thedivision,3d8dhe,JokerUnique,2,Tue Jul 14 10:48:33 2015 UTC,"Honestly, if Ubisoft is actually overcorrecting, I'm all for it. I'm all about games being released in a polished and solid condition with little fanfare. A good game doesn't need a massive marketing hype train to sell itself."
thedivision,3d8dhe,Wark_Kweh,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:33:21 2015 UTC,Haven't they already delayed it several times?
thedivision,3d8dhe,JokerUnique,3,Tue Jul 14 11:36:10 2015 UTC,yep with the PvP at E3 we have seen very little of the core gameplay and nothing of PvE - so there are still many questions at the Moment.
thedivision,3d8dhe,Wark_Kweh,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:09:56 2015 UTC,You don't think cover-based-shooting-with-RPG-mechanics-and-loot is the core gameplay? Are you expecting maybe Hearthstone with little spats of third-person-action as a minigame that you can play while the main game is loading?
thedivision,3d8dhe,JokerUnique,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:44:46 2015 UTC,"What you are describing is only combat. If you really want to have an interesting game that has a long lifetime you bring a bit more to the plate than, as you call it ""cover-based-shooting-with-RPG-mechanics-and-loot"". Because if the story is boring, if the character progression is not motivating, if the looting is a repetitive grind and if you simply not care about the people you should save, there is simply no point to sink any time in the game. Also Endgame is also a lot more than what you are describing. So no this is not core gameplay, combat has to be good to make the fights entertaining and not clunky or frustrating, but to make the game last, it needs all that stuff we haven't even seen yet."
thedivision,3d8dhe,Wark_Kweh,2,Wed Jul 15 22:10:28 2015 UTC,"But that is the core of the game. Every single thing you do is going to revolve around the cover-based-shooting-with-RPG-mechanics-and-loot.  Story? It can be outstanding, but it serves to drive you from one encounter to another.   Character progression? The reason you do it is so you can be better at the core gameplay. New skills and abilities plug into that core and affect the way you play. But youre still shooting things from cover.  Loot? Buddy. You grind for better loot so you can more effectively shoot at things from cover with your RPG skills.  Endgame? Is going to consist entirely of shootin at things with your legendary loot guns and RPG stats.  The core of the game is shooting at stuff in a cover based environment, utilizing special abilities to aid in this endevour so you can bring home the loot. Thats it. Yes it will be dressed up with auxiliary content, that it is still the core of the game. And as such, we have a pretty good idea of how the auxiliary content will be. Raids? High level/high skill co-op PvE based on core gameplay. DarkZone? Core gameplay against other players and mobs. Story? Core gameplay wrapped in narrative. Marketplace? A way to trade gear between players so they can be better equipped for core gameplay? Base of Operations? Upgraded through core gameplay and likely offers benefits to core gameplay.  Every single game has a simple gameplay concept at its core around which all other content revolves. This is The Division's."
thedivision,3d8dhe,Wark_Kweh,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:49:50 2015 UTC,"yep, you could argue it like that - OK, let's look at it from this angle:   Do you know everything about combat? Do we have a complete list of skills, do we have the modification tree, do we have an official list of the talents and how they work with the gear and the modifications? Do you KNOW how the combat works for each role and how you can improve your performance in the game?   Again, even here we have so many unconfirmed aspects of the game. There was for example no example how a tank works (sorry Bronson is no tank) and what buffs we can get from the modifications or specific legendary items.   So to finish this up... I have still a lot of questions all these aspects..."
thedivision,3d8dhe,le0wyatt,2,Thu Jul 16 05:40:39 2015 UTC,"I'm sure you do. The game hasn't been released yet. When it is released you can explore all these questions and more. I suppose the developers could release all their design documents so everybody can know everything about the game, but then what's the point? Certainly they don't want to feed a hype monster in the even they decide to deviate from their plans.   The fact of the matter is, we know enough. We know enough about the core gameplay to make pretty damn good guesses as to how the rest of the game will work. We know that there aren't concrete roles. Though some skills do lend themselves better to specific roles than others, so Bronson may indeed be a ""tank"", at least compared to Ryan and Megan. We don't need to know the nuance of every single skill to grasp a workable understanding of how combat works. We don't need to know the names and stats of specific legendaries to understand how this tried and true loot system works. We can safely assume, based on previous experience and sound game design, that the RPG elements of the game share similarities with the RPG elements of other similar games. Weapons and gear will have stats that affect how our characters perform.   We don't need minutiae to understand what kind of game The Division is. Is there a lot of information that we don't know? Absolutely. Will they trickle more information to us as release draws nearer? Almost assuredly. Even with what little we've seen, do we have a solid idea about most aspects of the game? Because most of what we've seen is core gameplay, yes. Do many people already have misconceptions about the game because they are blinded by hype? Yes, and this hype obscures the evidence that has been laid before us.   I reiterate; The Division will be like Destiny and Borderlands. Meaning it will be a shooter with heavy RPG mechanics and a Diablo-esque loot grind. The world will be open, but not as open as people are expecting. Instancing will, for some reason, be just as baffling to hyped people as it was with Destiny. People are going to be disappointed in the loot grind and become disenchanted with the content grind as well. And I can tell you this without seeing any more than the heart of the game that we have been shown."
thedivision,3d8dhe,RedDire,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:36:29 2015 UTC,"Joker has summed up my points relatively well and you fail to see them.  Destiny will not be like Borderlands, there has been no showcase of any sort of ""crazy"" weaponry with status effects and other nonsense abilities that can be randomly attributed to a game.  I for one hope my guns have no ""Abilities"" maybe bonuses to crit damage, ammo capacity, accuracy those kinds of real world effects but nothing ridiculous. This is supposed to be a SINGLE PLAYER game edit with an optional co-op experience, yet we have ZERO footage of the SINGLE PLAYER PvE experience. And its less then 3 months to Beta. Even with Destiny we knew we'd be in a Fireteam of 3 players, the 3 classes we're CONFIMED, Supers were CONFIRMED, Abilities were confirmed. All these things were confirmed yet we have nothing.  That we can consider UP TO DATE I'm using capitals because this keeps to slide by people for some reason that everything prior to the E3 2015 demo is essentially moot AND worthless. Too much has changed from Dark Zones being pulled, the hush-hush of devs about the Black Market and Social Hubs to be confident in ANYTHING we know prior to what was CONFIRMED at E3 2015.  That is my point sir."

I assume you mean the Division. And of course those things don't fit in the Division because they are tied to the wacky style of Borderlands. But you don't need off the wall abilities or insane random guns to have a game that generates rarity based loot that drive the numbers game under the hood of an RPG with levels and abilities exactly like Borderlands.    I for one hope my guns have no ""Abilities"" maybe bonuses to crit damage, ammo capacity, accuracy those kinds of real world effects but nothing ridiculous.   I never said anything about the game had to be ridiculous like Borderlands. And it doesn't need to be for the underlying mechanics to translate well.    This is supposed to be a SINGLE PLAYER game edit with an optional co-op experience, yet we have ZERO footage of the SINGLE PLAYER PvE experience.   You seem to be coloring your expectation with hype. You can play the game alone, but the single player game is likely identical to the multiplayer/co-op experience mechanically. PvE is going to be have the same mechanics as PvP, just without the players. That you think there are going to be glaring differences belies your tendency to create false expectations.   We know of groups sizes of at least 3 players. We know that there are no classes. We know several of the abilities. We know how DarkZones and contaminated loot works. We know how combat works. We know how loot works. We know enough to have a grasp of the game as a whole.   Do we know anything about social hubs or player economy? No. Possibly because these concepts have changed. But we will know in the comming months. The reason you are hard up for information is because you want to verify if the game is going to deliver on the expectations you think the game should meet."
thedivision,3d8dhe,Varaben,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:55:32 2015 UTC,"I think that your points are accurate especially the last paragraph but I do disagree with you in what ""we know"".  Realistically all we know about Dark Zone loot is that it has to be successfully extracted before it can be equipped at a Base. I'd like to know a little more about these structures and the different types there are. We saw stats concerning Morale, Manpower and Contamination all feeding into a larger Security Level Status for that Base in the E3 trailer. This to me means the Base, if its stats are neglected you might have contamination or panic might set in resulting in you losing that Base.  These kinds of things are what I'm talking about, the big stuff they've teased us with: http://i.imgur.com/D8MMw0X.png"

thedivision,3d8dhe,RedDire,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:19:32 2015 UTC,"That doesn't make any sense. Destiny easily became the most hyped game yet, and no one knew anything of how the game truly was because we were lied to."

thedivision,3d8dhe,RedDire,2,Wed Jul 15 21:48:36 2015 UTC,"What Destiny is compared to what was advertised was the most discussed topic after it's beta/release.

Edit: Found this if you wanna read through it: https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/2hqmkb/how_destinys_content_completely_changed_over_the"
thedivision,3d8dhe,The_Other_Manning,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:53:05 2015 UTC,"I played the beta. I think maybe people let hype get in the way as it build unrealistic expectations.   The game is an open world, even when doing solo missions you start in the public zone where other players are exploring the patrol missions. Is it what you were expecting? Maybe not. Such is the issue with hype.   The story was scrapped several times while the devs settled on the story they wanted to tell. I remember all kinds of cool concept art for aliens and primitive weapons that never made it in the game. And while the telling of the story was fumbled (codex cards in a companion app), the story itself is quite good, though much of it is there for atmosphere.   What was advertised? A futuristic shooter in a kick-ass setting with classic top-notch Bungie-tight controls. What did we get? A futuristic shooter in a kick-ass setting with classic top-notch Bungie-tight controls.  Hype builds expectations. People need to learn to be excited without twisting their expectations out of whack. This is what is happening here. Let me be clear so you can check your expectations against reality. The Division is going to be a game in the same vein as Borderlands and Destiny. It's going to have a story. It might even be a good story. But the core of the game is going to be a content grind on the hunt for that legendary loot that will push your RPG stats to the limit. You can play solo, but the game is obviously designed to be played with others, either in co-op or in versus or in some amalgamation of both. The game isn't going to be a bustling MMO with hundreds of players on screen at once. It isn't going to be a tactical shooter either. The world will probably feel smaller than you are expecting. It's going to be fun, but if you are expecting something more than we have seen you are going to be dissappointed."
thedivision,3d8dhe,Varaben,2,Wed Jul 15 22:08:33 2015 UTC,"It had nothing to do with hype. The hype was there because what we were shown got us excited. But it didn't happen.  Just go back and watch some trailers. None of that is there anymore. Not even the UI. And it isn't open-world.  Edit: And for the record, 90% of the story isn't even in the game. It's in that grimoire crap."
thedivision,3d8dhe,tifugod,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:24:59 2015 UTC,"I already conceded that the story is in a bad location. That doesnt make the story bad though.  First you need to define open world. If what you mean is a world where you can go basically anywhere in it at any time, then yes it is an open world game. Its not an elder scrolls or GTA game. But the world is open and you can go where you want.  And a lot of stuff is dropped from a lot of games. Its a part of development. Practically every critically acclaimed game youve ever loved has had things cut from it. Plans and goals change. It was clear for some time before the beta what the game was going to be.   But hype creates expectations that people cant shake. There are at this very moment people expecting the Division to be far and away different than what I described above. They are wrong."

thedivision,3d8dhe,tifugod,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:34:06 2015 UTC,"Based on the number of delays this game has had, it makes sense they aren't releasing info. My assumption is they planned to release info in 2014 (original release window), but ended up having to change so much in the process. They pushed it to 2015 and didn't want to release info then because they were afraid it would get pushed AGAIN and changed substantially.   It just sort of points to the fact that they either A) change the game a LOT over time or B) they think info will dampen the hype. After all, less info makes people WANT info, you know? Either or both could be true, or of course something I haven't considered yet."

thedivision,3d5ipx,kickyourteeeth,2,Tue Jul 14 07:57:14 2015 UTC,so excite much hype
thedivision,3d5ipx,hoyhoygames,2,Tue Jul 14 17:18:04 2015 UTC,"Let me preface this comment in that this applies to both PC and console players. This is NOT a circlejerk comment of PC>Console or Console>PC.  I merely intend to give some insight/perspective on the nature of the future of video gaming.   Here goes:  What worries me is how despite technological advances in enhancing the game experience for the consumer, we keep taking a step back for some unknown reason.    Be it graphics (better hardware like video cards, better software like game engines like Unreal 4, CryEngine, etc),  Or sound (better realistic sound capture, mapping it out to 32+, 64+, or even 100+ sound channel possibilities),  Better music (good composers/producers hired onto game projects),  Or just better core gameplay (improved gameplay dynamics, new concepts in gameplay, varied gameplay, etc).    Now, here's a brief recap of what we've seen annually from The Division:   In 2013, we saw Division at E3 for many of us, the first time. The graphics were captivating. Sound & music were great, and we saw how the dystopic nature of gameplay meshed into a cohesive single/multiplayer hybrid mixed with NPC's and other players. Foley was solid and made for a believable universe. In 2014, we saw Division at E3 again. We saw a few setbacks in graphical fidelity. We saw little PVP action, but saw players stacked against strong NPC's in a scripted sequence just as we did for the E3 2013 demo of The Division. Sound and music were still solid. Foley especially was captured well, with ambient noise in the background. In 2015, we saw another demo of The Division. Sound and foley are still good, and dystopic music is still present (well done!). We had the opportunity to see a new gameplay dynamic manifested into the environment of a unique PvP situation called The DarkZone. However, all of a sudden we see a sharp drop in visual fidelity, with many shaders removed and odd looking textures due to shaders removed.   Now, I have no problem with reduction of texture size or shader optimization. After all, a PC or console can only go so far. This has been done before in other video games since the beginning of the video game age.  Here's the issue: Dumbing down the visuals didn't make any positive impact on the visual aspect of the video game experience. All of a sudden, in the E3 2015 demo, we see blocky, choppy animations, sloppy player movements... If we're dumbing down the graphics, we should see an increase in other technical aspects of the gaming experience. Instead, we saw worse.  This makes me ask the question, is The Division going to suffer the same technical problems that other Ubisoft title Watch Dogs suffered from on release? Unexplained visual issues that were not present in any of the tech demos released prior to the final version of the game?"
thedivision,3d5ipx,neilthecellist,2,Wed Jul 15 16:49:06 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I don't know any more.  I feel like I'm somewhat losing interest because I feel like over the past few years, all we keep seeing is the same stuff, over and over.  Dark Zone, Dark Zone, Dark Zone.  No actual gameplay footage regarding any real story, just scripted, acted out PvP scenarios in....THE DARK ZONE, with even worse, more boring dialogue.  Then, on top of all that, we got that trailer/gameplay reveal of The Wild Lands (Now that I'm excited for).  I just find myself losing steam for this game due to sheer lack of info and gameplay footage."
thedivision,3d5ipx,-Dusty-,2,Tue Jul 14 00:07:12 2015 UTC,"I'm torn on this. I would love to know about the game systems and PvE and such and see more of the world, but at the same time I really want to go into this game blind and find out everything for myself."

But after seeing the E3 demos and hearing about what they've taken out of the game, I just feel overall apathetic and pretty hopelessly unexcited about the future of this game. I'll probably watch a couple of twitch sessions when it comes out, I can usually tell if I'll enjoy something after watching actual gameplay and hearing an unbiased response of how fun it is or not. Trying not to be negative about it. No matter what, some people will love what this game turns out to be. From my perspective it seems to be pretty unanimous that the air has been let out of the fanbase after this year's E3."

It's been talked about to death; some people militantly defend that the game looked no different than the previous years'. I'm not going to argue about it, but to me, it looked significantly worse. Not just graphic wise, but the UI as well. Also hearing about how the actual gunplay was pretty lackluster bummed me out. It just didn't seem like the reaction to the demo was very positive, I mean no one really seemed excited. It was like, ""Well, it could use some work, we'll see what happens."""

Just the fact they have pushed it back so many times it loses interest every time. They should lay off making 20 games and focus on 2 - 3 and do it right. AC has been the same thing every year and i do not see why people are still playing it.

The concept of the game is pretty awesome but it lacks seems to lack a sense of community which I like in MMO's. Please feel free to correct me in my assumptions if I'm wrong - I'm not a The Division connoisseur by any stretch but I read up every once in a while.  From what I have seen groups can be a maximum of 4 people, no larger factions/alliances/guilds for even just chatting with. This along with my understanding of how the missions work makes me feel like it's more single player outside of the dark zones. This just doesn't appeal to me knowing there's thousands of other people playing and I can't readily interact with them or when I am interacting with some, it's only with up to 3 people. You can't even talk within a proximity in Dark Zones when there are others around.  The premise of the combat is also really cool and I liked parts of what I saw in the videos but I wasn't too terribly thrilled about the pushing of one button to move from cover-to-cover. This just feels like a lack of control of my own character. It makes me question on how strategic you can be also or if the combat is going to be more spray and pray/button mashing.  Quite honestly, the fact it is being run by UbiSoft is quite concerning for me also. The lack of quality from this publisher has pushed me to put them on my ""do not buy"" list as I had given them too many chances and been too disappointed (this is even before Watchdogs, which I avoided like the plague) - the removal of the tablet/UAV play was a warning sign of this to me already. I truly hope The Division pans out but there are too many questions for me. Pre-ordering games is no longer for me, I will wait to see some reviews and gameplay videos and make my judgments from there.  Hopefully, I'll get selected for a beta period and get to see for myself. That would be the nail in the coffin either way for me purchasing or staying away from The Division."

thedivision,3d5ipx,bluepike,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:03:25 2015 UTC,"I don't think that's completely accurate. To my understanding, the entire game can be played solo or with friends. Then, there's the pvp enabled zones that make things a bit more interesting and intense."

thedivision,3d15jp,KillingShad0w,7,Sun Jul 12 17:39:22 2015 UTC,"Didn't watch the video yet but it seems people think the game will be really small. Why?  I mean, in the past I admit it has been a little suspicious..whenever devs were asked about the size they would kinda get uncomfortable and be like ""well..it's big, but we are focused on making sure it is really dense and full of stuff"" ect ect. So I don't think it'll be MASSIVE.  To be honest though, it doesn't need to be. No vehicles, so a map that is half the size of GTA5 in this game will feel just as ""big"". TO an extent. It is all about the detail and density. For example, Arkham Knight has a small map compared to other open world games these days but has an unprecedented level of detail everywhere.  I just hope that we get a nice sized Manhattan, a nice size brooklyn/queens, and the ability to explore the bridges and the statue of liberty or something, and I will be okay.  I predict that map will be about the same size of a bit smaller than AC Unity's Paris.  Others seem to be thinking this game is losing the ""charm"" cuz of the things they are taking out. The only thing I am upset about is stealth takedowns. But, if we as a community really want it and demonstrate our want in the upcoming beta I am sure it will be considered.  What is this about the removal of food and water? I am pretty sure it is still in, just not a vital survival tool"
thedivision,3d15jp,WolfieZee,3,Sun Jul 12 19:58:30 2015 UTC,"Food and water was never about survival, it was about temporary buffs and that's about it. At the moment IMO it is not even sure if this is still in the game or not.   Yea it was never confirmed how big the map is, we have no exact number of how many buildings are explorable or how deep the underground goes. In short we know NOTHING about the map so there is no reason to scream about any kind of downsizing because it was never stated how big it actually is.   In the end we have a map that is explorable on foot, we have buildings/indoor areas and underground areas and based on feedback here on Reddit the map has so accurate details that people that live in New York recognize the streets and the Buildings. So if they keep this up on the whole map and really make it interesting to explore on foot, this is a whole different level than just make a gigantic fantasy map that is mostly empty or copy paste.   They are trying their very best to create an interesting and accurate map as possible and IMO even if it is only Manhattan Island at launch it is still big enough."
thedivision,3d15jp,JokerUnique,3,Sun Jul 12 20:16:20 2015 UTC,"It won't be just manhattan right? I don't think they cut the 2013 area.  I do hope that there are a lot of interiors however, like shops and stuff. I wonder if they ever said exactly what the ratio is"
thedivision,3d15jp,WolfieZee,2,Sun Jul 12 20:17:38 2015 UTC,"The last statement we have was that the main part of the game will be Manhattan, but we will visit Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens. But what this really means is not clear at the moment. IMO it will be only the Island at launch and then add the rest later - but that is not confirmed at the moment."

thedivision,3d15jp,WolfieZee,2,Sun Jul 12 20:36:35 2015 UTC,"Brooklyn - but that was just a tech-demo, so it is not even sure, if this is in the game at all."
thedivision,3d15jp,JokerUnique,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:54:26 2015 UTC,"I don't think it was just a ""tech demo"". From what I remember, the engine had been completed and actual dev and creation of the world had begun a bit before e3   I'll try to reach out and ask"
thedivision,3d15jp,WolfieZee,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:02:35 2015 UTC,"yea probably this has been SnowDrop, but at the same time, they had the behind closed doors demo running, and this demo had a completely different GUI, had the Skill-tree in place and that was real gameplay.   This is what I meant with tech-demo - it was SnowDrop but most of it was stand-in and some nice smoke-and-mirror for the media."
thedivision,3d15jp,JokerUnique,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:32:30 2015 UTC,I don't know. I was pleasantly surprised just how similar this e3's gameplay was to the original gameplay.
thedivision,3d15jp,WolfieZee,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:04:02 2015 UTC,They could have kept that area as a 'starter' area where you learn the basics and such. Like a live tutorial. After doing some stuff there you would be going to Manhanttan for the real deal. Would actually make a lot of sense to me.
thedivision,3d15jp,K3lroy,2,Mon Jul 13 10:34:54 2015 UTC,"Good comment, we also should not forget that we have 3 (4) map layers for exploration. Besides the streets we will be able to explore the roofs, the inside of buildings (probably with multiple floors) and the underground."
thedivision,3d15jp,QXARE,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:03:56 2015 UTC,":)  Here, this is the map of AC Syndicate's London: http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=iokf2v&s=8  The washed out parts are no explorable. Only a part of the city is.  Looks teenie.  But Yet London is supposed to be LARGER than Unity's Paris.  TO be honest, game maps can be so ridiculously misleading. Just by looking at the gameplay and seeing the horizon of all the skyscrapers and bridges and buildings I can tell this game will be big. Not necessarily massive, but big enough.  I mean in the e3 2013 demo they were in a different borough and saw Manhattan as a whole across the bay and it was HUGE."
thedivision,3d15jp,WolfieZee,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:11:39 2015 UTC,"I thought that the roofs and insides of buildings were not going to be able to be explored. I believe in one interview the developers had mentioned that most buildings are not going to be explorable, with some exceptions"

So even though Marco doesn't have a full Dark Zone map size 100% identified, by even a rough estimate it looks like it's a lot smaller than we previously thought. Certainly not as large as the GTAV map."
thedivision,3d15jp,tifugod,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:06:16 2015 UTC,"Even so, we need to remember that the GTAV map took a somewhat long time just driving from LS to Sandy Shores, in this game it's all foot traffic, making the map seem like it is much larger than it actually is."
thedivision,3d15jp,Tank0428,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:10:41 2015 UTC,"We need to also remember that the GTAV map is incredibly empty outside the city, and a massive chunk of it is unused ocean."

I am on mobile but I might have the picture in the computer  Well it can be just a troll, he/she provided no source, but either way I extracted some information out of it.   The map was just a screenshot Google map with two squares drawn on it. One for the entire map and one for the dark Zone in it. If it is true its just a rough estimation of the bounds of the map and dark Zone The ""leak"" coincides with what we learnt from E3 is one Dark Zone in the midtown area. It also has roughly the same location and bounds as what Marco mentioned in this video The map was 14km² in area (as far as I remember) with The Dark Zone covering around 24% total area If the ""leak"" is true, two Dark Zones from the 2014 gameplay demo has been merged into one"

BUT if the map ingame is 1:1 in scale with real life, it might take 22mins to go from one end to another (considering average jogging speed of humans)  it might not feel that small"
thedivision,3d15jp,chemx32,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:55:01 2015 UTC,"14km seems really small. I remember reading some GTAV forums and players were saying it took 40 minutes to walk 5 miles in-game and 20 minutes to sprint. So, for 8 1/2 miles, maybe one hour to walk, 30 to sprint?   (edit - started trying to break up the total map into one long layout by taking into account the average length between two city blocks, (200 ft), coming up with 229 segments of 14km, then assuming 30-60 in-game minutes of walk time to cover one 14km segment, I came up with about 6-9 days worth of walking, assuming you are travelling up and down each street)"
thedivision,3d15jp,tifugod,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:36:07 2015 UTC,I think we are pretty used to traveling with vehicles that maps this size feels pretty small. But since there is so much verticality and hopefully a lot of details and interesting places without just emptiness i kind of think it's a good start.   It is easy to make a big game that contains forests and rural areas because you just randomize stuff and copy paste things all over but being in NY it's a whole different story. I got faith :)

thedivision,3d263o,JokerUnique,5,Sun Jul 12 22:36:50 2015 UTC,"This is completely misleading. It was one quarter of sales (April-June) in which Ubisoft did not release any AAA games. Almost all of their sales in the quarter were back catalog sales, and the jump in share of PC sales is almost entirely explained by the Steam summer sale which saw significant discounts for AC:Unity, FarCry 4, and other Ubisoft titles. The same quarter a year ago saw the release of a huge AAA game (Watch_Dogs) which is why PS4 had a much larger share last year.  TL;DR PC gamers are still as fucked as ever."

thedivision,3d263o,tjoners,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:29:33 2015 UTC,"Because they can't argue with ""console-sales carry the PC-version"" So with the new releases Ubisoft has to be very careful to release good quality, because based on these numbers, they have a lot to lose."
thedivision,3d263o,Dempaswarrior,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:51:43 2015 UTC,"But these numbers represent Unity and Watch_Dogs, no? Both were not without their problems on PC's. Yet they both sold a lot."

Do you really Think companies (serious Companys and not scam artists) actually want to, as you so elequantly put it, ""push shit out""? Or are you a huge troll? In that case, bravo! You had me at hello...  No, all companies at this size (and of course smaller ones) will Always learn from mistakes and try to do it better than Before.

thedivision,3d263o,thefoam,2,Mon Jul 13 01:20:30 2015 UTC,"In general they've learned from their ""Watch_Dogs Experience"" and got it that smoke-and-mirror trailers don't help their game. For example this E3 they only showed material that would also run on the target-platform and is also playable - so they are heading in the right direction.   Now we just need a optimized version for the PC..."
thedivision,3d263o,Huludicidal3000,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:39:43 2015 UTC,"They've stated a few times that they are making a fully optimized version for PC (not a port).

thedivision,3d263o,jackennils,2,Mon Jul 13 15:57:39 2015 UTC,"yep it was stated, I believe it, when I see it. Witcher 3 also admitted later, that they just made one version of the game because they had problems with resources."

Based on what we know now, I expect something like the Star Wars Old Republic.   => Character creation SWToR  You can select if male/female, select from predefined faces and Body-shapes and then add scars, tattoos, facial hair etc.   IMO this is enough for games like this, because in the end you tell your story with the cloth you wear (those have no impact on the stats and can be the same through your whole game progression) and also the gear in the end.   At least this was the case with Star Wars Old Republic and IMO it was a very good system. Because a very detailed face-system is nice, but how long does it take until you have a helmet and a gas-mask on? Not long and IMO it is enough when we can customize the stuff we wear in more detail."

As far as we know at this point you can  that you can customize some basic stuff about your character like gender, skin tone, tatoo, piercing. There might be more to it, but as I said, don't expect Fallout or Skyrim level of character creation  I don't know if you can change them or not, but apparently there is an option of having multiple characters.

For example The Division blog's review of the demo at E3 mentioned that he was able to go up to a balcony of a building under construction. Link  Plus devs talked about rooftops occasionally, and we had a gameplay demo (tablet gameplay demo) where the player was on a rooftop."
thedivision,3cvosu,chemx32,3,Sat Jul 11 05:39:02 2015 UTC,"From where I see it, features can be constantly removed during development. The latest gameplay demo gave me the impression that the game won't give you as much freedom as that in Battlefield series. That's to say, even if there's rooftop access in the final released version, you will only be able to access a very limit number of rooftops, perhaps only when the plot requires.   What I'm trying to say is, if you want to take a sniper rifle and take up the high-ground (10, 20 floors high), that's highly unlikely."
thedivision,3cvosu,lynnharry,2,Sun Jul 12 09:59:59 2015 UTC,"Yep verticality is part of the game and since vantage point and positioning is important in a cover-based shooter it can be used to get an advantage in combat.   It was specifically mentioned that you enter buildings, go on rooftops to get a better shot as a sniper and also (if you want to) go underground.   But since the whole sniper-mechanics are still in balancing and we don't know how far you can actually shoot, we don't know how effective you can use such positions at this point, because we have only seen street-level combat."

thedivision,3ct39j,JokerUnique,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:53:55 2015 UTC,"The quotes about this are very vague. It was stated, that the group won't be completed with bots but maybe they accompany you on a mission - but that has not been confirmed.  Based on the latest UbiBlog entry and how the civilians react, I get the impression that they will have their daily routine, take cover when there is fighting close-by but we won't have much to do with them. Maybe they take over the stuff we have secured in a mission - but as common in open-world-games they are usually just decoration and unless we have a specific mission they don't do more than that.  But since we haven't seen anything PvE this is speculation."
thedivision,3ct8wj,Bumper_Duc,10,Fri Jul 10 16:16:53 2015 UTC,"Well it sure won't be as tactical as the tactical shooters, this is an RPG and this has a whole different dynamic to it. You have more skills, better armor and unless it is scripted, there is usually no instant kill.   It was stated you'll always fight the odds and you will be outnumbered - be it as a team or solo. The enemies will scale up if you are in a group, so they will be more difficult to kill. Sure it is possible that in lower difficulties, people will just run around and kill stuff on their own, but as soon as you have higher difficulties, and you really skill and equip a character for a specific role, people usually get in line, let the tank do their job, do damage or heal.   So yes it will be different, but from experience, you'll drop fast if you try to lone wolf in group content and veteran players usually accept the roles of the player and know what they have to do to get fast through the mission."
thedivision,3ct8wj,JokerUnique,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:36:13 2015 UTC,"yeah i have the same thoughts All the gameplay i've seen it's just people  trying to rush to the hostage with no coordination because the timer is too short like only 3 minutes with all the other game breaking stuff like hit indicator, heartbeat sensor,.. It just not feel right"
thedivision,3ct8wj,JokerUnique,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:56:59 2015 UTC,"It is slower gameplay, but you also have less possibilities than in games like Rainbow. Positioning, focus-fire and that you don't get flanked is important. Beyond that it is just focus fire and coordinating with the tank.   So yes it is tactical but it is different and less dynamic than normal FPS or normal third-person shooters..."
thedivision,3ct8wj,tifugod,3,Fri Jul 10 17:12:04 2015 UTC,"Short answer - not really. I think it's going to be tacticalish, (hide behind cover, try to flank, work with a squad), but nothing close to the level of Ghost Recon or anything like that."

I'm an old school player from SWAT 3 and I don't think that The Division it's a tactical game. Can have tactical components because you need team work to have a mission success, but this doesn't make The Division a tactical game :)"
thedivision,3ct8wj,Strifedecer,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:24:29 2015 UTC,"I feel its a good blend of a tactical shooter and an RPG. We actually have to worry about positioning and flanking, cover fire and support. I realize we're used to the more ruthless nature of skill-based shooters when it comes to tactical approaches, but this is an RPG after all. I know I've brought this up many times, but its probably the same reason stealth takedowns were removed: its an instant kill. Unless you have high-tier weapons, and are fighting low level enemies, this does not happen in an RPG."
thedivision,3ct8wj,2legsakimbo,0,Fri Jul 10 22:37:58 2015 UTC,"no. spray and pray bullet sponge mechanics with neon names and health bars above everyones heads sort of remove most all need for tactical awareness and maneuvering (well beyond hiding behind cover). pity, could have been epic."
thedivision,3co7eu,NateIBEW558,11,Thu Jul 9 13:02:12 2015 UTC,"Seeing as I've invested hundreds and hundreds of hours in Destiny, I'd say if The Division has something to keep me coming back like that too, then I'm going to be busy for a long time!  But seriously though, having played both The Division at E3, and Destiny extensively, I'll tell you they are nothing alike. The similarities begin and end with them being shooters with online components and RPG mechanics.  For The Division, it really depends on what they have planned for end game content. Provided there's something solid, with a repeatable framework, then we should be good."

thedivision,3co7eu,Classicpass,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:11:50 2015 UTC,"I doubt its post DLC and more end game, I mean Skyrim was a 500 Hour content packed game pre DLC If this game has enough areas, side missions, end game missions, challenge/reward system, gear sets, etc... there can be alot to do in the game.

I am excited for The Division and in some ways I am hoping it will be similar to Destiny and in others I am hoping it will be different.  It looks like The Division is going to have a very unique PvP experience and I am really excited for that. What I am hoping for is a GTA V style open world with Gears of War style mechanics. The open world aspect of Destiny is pretty poor but that game has the smoothest gunplay that console gaming has ever seen. We're not going to get that butter smooth shooting Destiny gives us but hopefully we will get the tactical elements from GoW.   What I think will really make or break the game is the loot grind and what the end-game is going to play like. Some sort of PvE/PvP blend would be really cool, but I'm thinking that it will probably be similar to the online heists recently released in GTA V."
thedivision,3co7eu,Dwysauce,8,Wed Jul 15 19:54:33 2015 UTC,"The only thing we have seen is a much faster PvP at E3 that it should be in the final game.

So before you compare those two, you should wait until we see actual gameplay and not just a simplified demo to get an impression of the game in 20min...  I haven't played Destiny, but from what I've read about the PvE and the possibilities in The Division, we have a lot to do, there should be an interesting story and it should be motivating to explore the map."
thedivision,3co7eu,JokerUnique,9,Thu Jul 9 14:23:23 2015 UTC,"I played Destiny for an hour or two, but from what I can say, the things The Division and Destiny have in common is because they are integral part of online RPG genre.   People forget games having the same genre can be similar.   Either way, even if The Division turns out to be ""Open world, Tom Clancy Destiny"" it does not mean it is going to fail. The negative parts of Destiny is the story, mission variation and DLC model. If The Division does this right, it can be ready enjoyable"
thedivision,3co7eu,chemx32,3,Thu Jul 9 16:04:34 2015 UTC,"The negative parts of Destiny is the story, mission variation and DLC model.   The question is whether this is just a Bungie fuckup, or is this inherent to the genre. Is it possible to create a great co-op/multiplayer story? How do you allow people to feel they own the story when you have people dropping in at different points? How do you build a coherent and satisfying narrative that leaves room for you to always be adding to it with DLC. How much mission variation can you create beyond ""go here, shoot them, loot that""? And DLC, well it's hard to imagine them being as dumb as Bungie has been with the pricing, but the model is what it is (base game plus periodic DLC/expansion drops) and it's not going to be cheap to keep getting new content."
thedivision,3co7eu,Joker328,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:21:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think the big question is what's going to happen after the main story is completed. Most games either turn into a loot grind or PVP-fest at that point.   It would be neat if Massive embedded certain quests to only be available in certain areas at specific times - that might keep things more interesting - maybe.   I'd also love to see major threats , sort of like the WoW server raids , that require tons of people coordinating with each other to defeat. Although since the PVE is instanced, I doubt this will happen."
thedivision,3co7eu,tifugod,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:21:58 2015 UTC,"Since its Ubisoft, I have hope that they won't get too overboard with their DLCs. I would love if they use the DLC model used in most of their present games, (base game+1 or 2 expansions not directly related to main story)   How much mission variation can you create beyond ""go here, shoot them, loot that""?    You actually can't  create much variation beyond that BUT the aim here would be to create a sense of variation. A lot of games are mostly "" go there, kill them, loot that, fetch these"" including Skyrim and Fallout. It just manages to create a sense of variation which Destiny couldn't"
thedivision,3co7eu,chemx32,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:59:00 2015 UTC,I'm just looking at their previous games and from what i've read they've all had good stories.
thedivision,3co7eu,Astro_Gamer,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:06:12 2015 UTC,"Destiny was fine about getting you involved in the story, the problem was that they didn't create enough story.

So just because they are there on the disc doesn't mean they are in a state that is playable.  The reason they add it to the disc is to keep download sizes smaller, which I'm sure many people with bandwidth restrictions appreciate."
thedivision,3co7eu,Amaegith,2,Fri Jul 10 04:09:48 2015 UTC,I really hate that businesses model. BF4 is what really killed my thrust in the gaming industry.

thedivision,3co7eu,Kreetak,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:25:23 2015 UTC,I haven't been looking too intensively into the Division could you give me a rundown of what the possibilities are?   From what I've read it seems to be mostly just open world exploration PvE and then you can do a matchmaking experience whenever with Darkzone PvP. But in the end it's just for loot.  Outside of the exploration for loot what is there as far as substantial replayability content? I'm just afraid this will become dull quickly.
thedivision,3co7eu,BLToaster,3,Thu Jul 9 22:07:34 2015 UTC,"I'm just gonna link to the summaries I've done about the PvE. 2 of them were written before E3, but since they showed only Dark Zone and PvE stuff, they are still valid. They summarize basically what you can do in the PvE areas - at least what has been confirmed pre E3. Raids are not listed in the articles because they haven't been officially confirmed yet, but they should be in the game.    The World Base of Operations The People you meet"
thedivision,3co7eu,JokerUnique,2,Thu Jul 9 22:38:24 2015 UTC,"The devs have been pretty tight-lipped about the game, but I think they've mentioned the following:  There will be bases that you will have to build up, and that (it was  hinted) might degrade or lose capabilities over time, making them a bit more dynamic.   Unlocking capabilities from your base will change the way the surrounding environment appears (e.g. maybe police will start patrolling an area)  The enemies in a particular area may change over time. i.e. different factions will dominate.   There is a day-night cycle.   PVP is a focus, and is a good way to obtain loot, but there are no story elements obtained from PVP.   Loot, modification, crafting, and RPG-style character development are in the game.  There is a relatively dense map to explore (MarcoStyle thinks the map will be about the size of GTA 5)  There is a story to uncover, that will be relayed without the use of cutscenes.   There will be end-game content of some sort but they've been really secretive about what that will actually be. I think that's still under development.   IMO The MAIN differences between The Division and Destiny is that The Division will have more exploration, will be more immersive, and have a more dynamic world. I do think that loot grinding will be similar though.   Hope this helps!"
thedivision,3co7eu,tifugod,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:49:39 2015 UTC,"We still haven't seen the core gameplay, missions, PvE, Or anything Endgame in Destiny either lol. That's prolly what OP is worried about.   But on a serious note, TC knows how to make a story come to life and I think we should not worry too much based upon what we have seen, it seems a little far fetched to compare it to Destiny so early"

thedivision,3co7eu,MisjahDK,4,Thu Jul 9 22:23:58 2015 UTC,"As a player of Destiny and someone who is really hyped for The Division, if they are somewhat similar that won't be an issue for myself.  Destiny has grown from what was launched, and that seems to be a constant this day and age.  If the Division can launch and have a solid foundation, then it can last and be great.  Destiny hasn't gone anywhere but up and continues to grow and put out new content.  What worries me is Ubisoft and the recent history of putting out games that are very buggy upon launch.  Hopefully that's not the case with The Division."
thedivision,3co7eu,Delvoire,21,Thu Jul 9 13:49:20 2015 UTC,"*edit. Please don't downvote him people. His post still has valid points (like Ubisoft games being buggy) even if I disagree with a part of it.   Destiny has grown from what was launched   Okay so let's get this straight.  So basically:   64 for the game (Which had barely any content)  20 for the 1st expansion (copy paste with barely any content)  20 for the 2nd (better but still not varied at all)  40 for the 3rd (It's the ""biggest"" expansion and yet it has far less content then a normal MMO/Loot game)  20 for cosmetic (you get like three emotes and a few shaders for 20 dollars. This is how stupid they know their playerbase is that they can price emotes and a few shaders for the same price as an entire expansion)  20 for the 4th expansion   20 for the 5th.   And correct me if wrong, but the new ""collectors"" edition for 80 bucks doesn't even include the two upcoming DLC after the taken king.  The original game has the worst story I've seen in years. Destiny's UNFUN RNG filled BS grind has been reported and talked about by EVERYONE since day one.  The multiplayer is a cesspool of unbalanced scrubbish copy paste setups with no originality or variation. I still see Destiny players on the ESL forums trying to convince people that Destiny will be on the circuit and everyone just laughs at them because Destiny's multiplayer is just as shit as the rest of the game, actually I'd argue it's even worse.  Not to mention this fucking interview where they basically said ""fuck you. We know you'll buy this shit anyways""  Oh and don't forget, Xbox players will continue to have content taken out of all of the upcoming expansions That's right, Xbox players have content that was taken out of the base game, we didn't get an alpha, we got a shorter beta, AND they even take content out of the expansions.  And what I find funny is that when I joined my friends party of 8 people. Every single one of them was playing Destiny and every single one of them hated everything about the game but they kept playing because of that carrot on the stick. This is how the majority of people I've met play Destiny, frustrated but addicted.  I'm worried about The Division not living up to expectations, sure. But what I am not worried about in the slightest is that they will be another Destiny because Destiny is the absolute fucking bottom you can reach. Ubisoft would have to TRY to make their game as shitty as possible in order to be comparable to Destiny.  And let's not forget the fact that The Division is embracing its MMO nature unlike Destiny. Which is a big indicator of what kind of path they want for this game."

They are also increasing the level cap, adding new gear, new cosmetic items, new PVP maps and game modes, new strikes (mini dungeons), new story missions, 3 new subclasses.  IMO worth the money when compared to other DLC on consoles and what you get.  Common comparision is to Call of Duty where people tend to pay $15.00 to get 4 new multiplayer maps and a new zombie map.  They have also really toned down the grind aspect of the game and made it a lot easier to get to max level to enjoy the end game."

The Division looked a lot better in '13, now it looks pretty generic apart from the location. I'll probably have to press a certain key on my keyboard to unlock a certain part of the map.  It's confirmed that there is only one dark zone and while you're there you literally respawn in the same area which means you can take the items back while they're trying to escape, i wish it was like DayZ or Rust where the whole map is just PVP if you wanted it to be that way.  Don't get hyped, you'll only get burned."

Destiny is your typical shooter style, with regenerating health and co-op mechanics. Warframe is an insane run 'n' gun parkourfest with heavy a wide variety of character and weapons builds most rpgs feature. The Division, from what I've seen, is a tactical co-op shooter where tactics, cover and strategy actually do have a heavy emphasis in the game. What's lacking in all these games, I feel, is a good stealth mechanic."
thedivision,3co7eu,Jellysandals,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:22:10 2015 UTC,There is some sort of cloaking in The Division that I believe hasn't been clearly demonstrated but people saw the icon for.
thedivision,3co7eu,Strifedecer,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:17:26 2015 UTC,"Warframe too, has invisibility. I feel The Division's invisibility will mostly be used for escaping, and positioning. None if these really contribute to stealth, which involves taking down enemies one by one. They removed stealth takedowns too....I believe its because it will go against the rpg damage-level relation. Plus, even if your weapons at some point do get powerful enough to one-shot an enemy, they will probably be like nearly every other rpg enemy: telepathic and will know exactly when one of their mates is dead and where the shooter is. Edit: Warframe has some semblance of stealth because the invisibility is duration based, and stays regardless of whether you take or deal damage, making it possible to build your Warframe for duration, thus longer invisibility, thus more time to melee everyone. Edit 2: Warframe too has stealth takedown in which the animation is unique to the melee weapon equipped, but if the weapon is too weak, the enemy doesn't die. Maybe a similar system could have been incorporated in The Division."

And no rpg elements outside of characters having class abilities   From what I've seen of the division it looks like that loot pool abilities and general game play is going to be much deeper than destiny. When destiny was hyped it was talked up as an open world adventure game similar to ESO. Where you could epect to bump into other Guaradians as u roamed opened space completing missions. Well that's simply false.  So far the division seems a lot more focused on bringing a true seamless multilayer experience to.   TLDR only similarities is that it's online  and has loot."

thedivision,3ckvvx,JokerUnique,2,Thu Jul 9 05:03:21 2015 UTC,"there is a matchmaker that matches the players with the same level - but how they compensate level-differences inside a group that big, I don't know. That is also one of my main questions. Because we have the same problem in PvE..."
thedivision,3ckvvx,mitooil,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:29:43 2015 UTC,"what I have seen in marcostyle's videos, is that level does not factor too much in dmg output. I could think that once in the darkzone you are stripped of all level bonues so everyone is equal? gear could also be stripped of level bonuses, so only rarity and mods factor in  this could be a thing"
thedivision,3ckvvx,JokerUnique,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:01:05 2015 UTC,"In terms of numbers, I would not use the E3 demo as reference. The stats were all over the place and IMO too many things were changed to get a fun and exciting experience in 20 minutes.   It was stated from the devs, that the matchmaker ensures, that a level 5 player won't face a level 15 player - IMO that is enough, because I don't farm equipment for hours and hours to lose all the bonus in the Dark Zone where they put the most difficult content and the best loot."
thedivision,3ckvvx,mitooil,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:14:43 2015 UTC,"Again,  removing level bonus does not affect the weapon base stats. And what you want and what the devs think is the best, are two different things.  I think they want to make it balanced. Of course my ideas are just ideas, but you achieve the best balance by making everyone the same as possible. And yes. I also want to have that extra bonus from my equip,  that I farmed for so long,  but giving me the best chances to win even more dark zone  thus resulting in even better gear  so I can stay at the top even easier does not sound like what the community would want. Sorry for all the typos. Im in mobile."
thedivision,3ckvvx,JokerUnique,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:23:10 2015 UTC,"yea we'll see. The main questions is, how they handle the level-differences between players in a group and then it should be clear how the rest of the system works. Until then it is difficult to build a solid scenario. Balancing PvP is always a pain...."
thedivision,3ckvvx,Clumpmeister,2,Thu Jul 9 06:15:44 2015 UTC,I'm betting that the DZ will be based on the group leader's level.

thedivision,3ckvvx,Joker328,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:06:29 2015 UTC,"My thought is that there will have to be some sort of level adjustment when you go into the dark zone with a friend who is significantly different from you level-wise. Most likely the higher player will be downgraded. Otherwise you could just run around with your high ranked friend, have him waste other players, and pick up their loot.  Also, I'm pretty sure they said you have a DZ rank that is separate from regular PVE level, but it's not entirely clear to me how each one will affect things in the DZ."
thedivision,3ckvvx,Deeper92,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:32:03 2015 UTC,"It's very common to have balanced matchmaking, it is in more games than you might realize. There will either be a balancing system for matching teams or a level restriction system. There is no way this will slip through the crack, rest assured.  If you are still worried about it sign up for beta so you can make aure the issues are addressed. That's the benefit of playing in the beta. Play it, post concerns here, community support should push the issue to a fix."
thedivision,3cidf3,Bronzedog,15,Wed Jul 8 03:34:31 2015 UTC,"Oh my god, listen to all you fucking whiners on this post. This is like the least offensive marketing scheme there is in the game industry. It's basically like rewards points for hotels, airlines, Starbucks, gas, or just about everything these days. They are just rewarding you with items of nominal value as a thank you for being a repeat customer and to promote brand loyalty. How can you say this is pay to win or tantamount to console exclusives which actually restrict your ability to enjoy the game if you don't pay or have a particular console? It's not going to double your XP or anything. It'll probably boost your XP like 25% for an hour or some shit. Just play the game a little longer that day and then you can keep up. And nobody is going to buy a game just to get a new outfit in another game. Nobody is forcing you to do anything. There are so many things worth bitching about in the gaming industry, but Uplay rewards is not one of them."

They come from a separate Ubisoft-specific ""achievements"" style tracker that awards you achievement points based on in-game actions, and then you can spend those points on new in-game content.   As you play through Ubisoft games, you'll rack these up like crazy. It doesn't cost you anything, calm the hell down all of you."

thedivision,3cidf3,aurorafluxic,2,Mon Jul 13 00:26:57 2015 UTC,"No, every UPlay capable game always gives you enough points to ""purchase"" all the extra content for that game. You don't need to play UPlay capable game number 2 to ""rack up enough points"" to buy something for UPlay capable game number 1. It's no different than how games lock away the best stuff behind huge in-game currency prices; you can buy it if you save enough.

Giving players an XP boost like this is almost feeling like P2Win, you give us money, we give you XP...  I don't have a problem with XP boosts when it comes to playing and leveling alts, you have already done the content once and i can understand you just want to get it over with asap when you do it a second time. But when you play the game for the first time and are leveling your first toon, you should not be leveling faster than the developers had planned it to be."
thedivision,3cidf3,joshua_nash,3,Wed Jul 8 13:28:31 2015 UTC,The XP boost can all be done within The Division is that is the only Ubisoft game you play. It isn't something that can only be obtained by purchasing and playing a different game.

thedivision,3cd1g8,JMWP,3,Tue Jul 7 04:53:09 2015 UTC,"The map should be disabled completely when entering the dark zone. I believe this will increase the cautiousness in players as they roam around the dark zone.   No. God no. In a third person cover-based shooter that already offers challenge in that you may not see people coming because they've camped out behind a wall, the last thing the game needs is for even more navigation tools to be gimped.    I understand this limits the factor to see players to see rogue agents in the surroundings or on the map. But simply highlighting rogue players in front us when they're nearby would increase their vulnerability still.   That's fine and all for agents who are about to go rogue, but it does nothing for the more likely scenario in which a ""clean"" agent has already decided they want to go rogue and they're waiting for the right set of agents to take out.   It sounds like the game that you actually want is Rainbox Six Seige. That will give you the tactical warfare you're looking for. The Division should first and foremost be an RPG, and a shooter second. It should be all the things that Destiny missed out on. It should be closer to Borderlands than it is to Rainbow Six.   Just my opinion, sorry that we don't see eye-to-eye."
thedivision,3cd1g8,aurorafluxic,1 point,Tue Jul 7 08:01:09 2015 UTC,"So far we know that gear you can wear as armor has special prefixes (tactical, operative, riot, expedition), but not what they actually do. It could be, that they give special advantages but also the disadvantages you ask for. But this has to be confirmed.   Marksman rifle give players the option to do damage from a distance without exposing them too much in the battlefield - so you probably have to shoot a lot less bullets to do the damage of a inaccurate assault rifle or shotgun. So there could be an already big enough advantage to make it interesting for players that don't want to be on the front-lines. but this is pure speculation on my part."
thedivision,3cd1g8,JokerUnique,1 point,Tue Jul 7 05:31:04 2015 UTC,It doesn't matter what we think.  The game is too far into it development to implement any major change.

Imo it breaks part of the roll-playing as you can adapt on the fly to any situation"
thedivision,3c74po,Timboron,7,Sun Jul 5 14:26:36 2015 UTC,"yep it comes together - how you spec for the different roles, what probably the equipment mods are and how the different builds can be.... interesting.

thedivision,3c74po,Astro_Gamer,5,Sun Jul 5 16:06:06 2015 UTC,"The difference in damage against NPCs versus PCs can easily be explained by them splitting it up, to make balancing easier.  If something is OP/UP in PvE, or PvP, and it gets nerfed/buffed, having the split will make it easier in the long run.  Games which don't split stats like that are pretty much doomed to have stuff be balanced in one (PvE or PvP) but be pretty shit in the other.  Just look at Destiny, best example for how NOT to do it."
thedivision,3c74po,CaptainKapautz,2,Sun Jul 5 16:47:46 2015 UTC,The PvP/PvE balancing is a problem in each game that uses the same stats. If they really seperate these to systems then they really have made a good decision.
thedivision,3c74po,JokerUnique,1 point,Sun Jul 5 17:32:27 2015 UTC,"Do you think it will be a day one thing or something they learn the hard way, like so many other games?"
thedivision,3c74po,CieroXy,2,Mon Jul 6 13:43:50 2015 UTC,"I just hope they balance as much as possible during beta. There are powerful skills and when the devs miss a powerful synergy between skills, talents and gear there will be a lot of screaming in the forum and in panic something is nerved to the ground instead of fixing the real problem.   But synergy between gear / skill / talent is difficult to discover unless you give players really the possibility and the time to push a character and IMO the beta-window is too short to find stuff like that...  When I look at the Character sheet we have now with the Archetype, the offensive/defensive skills and the mods you can put in a character - if the balancing is not right you can put together a really powerful character and we haven't even seen the bonus and the buffs from the ultra-rare legendaries..."
thedivision,3c74po,JokerUnique,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:58:44 2015 UTC,"Considering we will have 2+ months of beta to work through it, I hope you're right.  I just wish they had PC beta with Xbone.  We are always the ones that find the most ""wtf"" things."
thedivision,3c74po,CieroXy,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:01:49 2015 UTC,"2 month is a very short window and if you are working, it is almost impossible to max out a character. Elder Scrolls Online had a year of beta and they still hat an invincible Vampire DragonKnight or an almost un-killable tank in the game at launch because they missed a synergy.   RPGs are very vulnerable for things like this because there are so many possibilities to spec a character - and in many cases the devs just missed what the theorycrafters found and some player exploit this stuff in PvP..."
thedivision,3c74po,JokerUnique,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:15:29 2015 UTC,Assume inevitability of those kinds of bugs I'd say.  Something is bound to slip through.  You think that the an expedited leveling system to compensate for the time frame?

So they or at least one should still be in the game. But since we haven't seen anything about PvE I can't confirm that this specific base is still in the game or if anything from the old gameplays still is valid.

Perhaps there are a few lower floors, and then you can take an elevator and there are a few upper floors with an EVAC ZONE AT THE TOP ON THE OUTSIDE  HOW EPIC WOULD THAT BE.  No escape, the tip top of a skyscraper, fighting and waiting for your chopper to pierce through the clouds."

thedivision,3c3pdy,luukvds,3,Sat Jul 4 16:01:40 2015 UTC,that's exactly what i'm thinking could happen. i see a fight taking place on the lower floors then taking an elevator to another floor where we extract something and off to the highest floor for extraction. then as we fire off the flare all nearby agents rush to the building and we fight them from the top of the escalator to the bottom escalator.
thedivision,3c3pdy,Astro_Gamer,2,Sat Jul 4 15:49:26 2015 UTC,"No power, so you can't take an elevator. I wouldn't be surprised if you could take the stairs though, since on the Ubisoft stream they have hinted that there will be evacuation zones at differing altitudes."
thedivision,3c3pdy,brian1999lin,2,Sat Jul 4 16:22:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah I am just thinking of how they would give us access to the bottom and top of the building seamlessly.  Stairs would take FOREVER.  There are still a few generators and such in the dark zone, powering some lights and stuff.

thedivision,3c3pdy,brian1999lin,2,Sat Jul 4 22:26:51 2015 UTC,"True, but there could be JTF in the area keeping it ""fueled"".  Also, how do we know for sure if the ESB doesn't have solar panels at this point in time?  Also, it's a video game, the power could just work for the sake of working."
thedivision,3c3pdy,-Dusty-,2,Sat Jul 4 22:46:19 2015 UTC,"( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)  Don't quote me on this, but I find it hard to believe that there would be a substantial amount of solar panels on the ESB, considering the buildings shape (growing upwards, so not enough area on a horizontal plane to install solar panels). Furthermore, elevators require a lot of electricity to run, which is even harder. Buildings with solar panels nowadays with a scale that is somewhat compatible to a skyscraper piggyback off the main electrical grid anyways, as solar panels cannot power 100% of their systems (elevators included).  Finally, the JTF have evacuated the Dark Zone, and I find it hard to believe that they would be keeping the ESB safe from enemy factions as it is not a key military location in the city. There is no benefit to the military to keep it safe compared to the risk of the virus easily destroying their operations and killing more people."
thedivision,3c3pdy,brian1999lin,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:50:04 2015 UTC,"It would be cool if....  The first part of the mission could be to gather fuel for the generators, you fill it up so that you can activate the elevators and escape to the rooftop. But midway up something happens, it runs out of fuel or an enemy faction disables it, and you must pry the elevator doors open and race up the remainder of ESB while fighting off enemies."
thedivision,3c3pdy,gamegenius86,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:25:05 2015 UTC,"That WOULD be amazing! But again, elevators probably won't be in the game because developers are trying to stop lag and elevators are dynamic :c"
thedivision,3c3pdy,brian1999lin,3,Mon Jul 6 15:26:56 2015 UTC,"Didn't they mention Dark Zone airlocks?  Maybe the ESB has an airlock on its main entrance to keep the infection out, ie no PvP inside of it.  Perhaps there's different groups of NPCs inside, civilians seeking refuge, JTF trying to establish a foothold and maintain peace and groups of hostile NPCs trying to take the place over.  Maybe each floor will have a door/elevator that can lead to the next area, something they guard at all times to keep the enemy from getting in.  So maybe floors 1-14 are safe, but 15-20 are overrun by Rikers, whilst 21-24 has a unit of JTF that are holed up awaiting some much needed assistance.    Maybe not quite exactly like this, but possibly something like it. I imagine some of the elevators might work, but they can only go so high, so from that point you have to take the stairs and those would become blocked off at a certain point. So now you have to fight your way across a hostile floor to get to either another stairway, an elevator that works, or even something you can climb/scale, like an elevator shaft, an air conditioner duct or a maintenance scaffold."

Because it was stated that you can finish the story without any PvP.

thedivision,3c0w1b,ropeadoped,1 point,Sat Jul 4 05:30:38 2015 UTC,"Fairly confident that a downgrade has happened. Not a major one, mind you. But if you scour through the various posts and videos from people who have been to E3 and seen both stages of the game in person, the general consensus is a downgrade of graphics has taken place. But at the end of the day, it jsut went from best looking game to still a really really really good looking game."
thedivision,3c0w1b,WolfieZee,0,Sat Jul 4 17:45:43 2015 UTC,"I really don't see it.  Plus, it was on xbox one. The fact that I don't see a downgrade, plus its on the lowest denominator makes me even more excited for the division on PC with gameworks.  But yeah, even if it was downgraded, it still looks twice as good as other next gen games like Witcher 3."
thedivision,3c0w1b,Aweef,2,Sat Jul 4 17:47:22 2015 UTC,"Exactly. I used to stress myself over how games looked, and how downgrades meant we were lied to. And then I sat down one night, had a beer or two with a friend and realized I was a greedy little prick who didn't know what I was talking about. I can rant and rave with the best of them, but the fact of the matter is I don't know shit about every minute detail that is needed to make a game. Maybe that's legitimately what the game looked like in 2013, and through various small compensations to other areas of the game, a little bit of a downgrade here and there added up, and the devs dont see it because they are there for each little change. But who honestly gives a rat's ass when the suspension of disbelief sets in and you really don't notice pixels and textures because your mind is replacing it with fuller, richer examples of what it knows. If you are one of those eagle eyed players who can't let go and needs to pick out how this doesn't look as good, and that looks kinda funny, then I feel bad for you because you're missing out on a lot of blissful gaming. It's a floggin game to be played, not a stillframe to be critiqued as in a gallery. However, if that's what you want to do, I won't mind too much, as that will make you an easy kill for me.

Completely false, as Marco confirms the footage release from E3 2015 was all PC despite the fact that the version playable on the floor was running on an Xbox One. He also specifically states here:    I know that it was played on a computer because I asked the devs, also.. I played the xbox one demo so I know that it didn't look like what was shown."

All they've done is recycled old information (particularly before E3) and made speculations and put out ""wish lists"" for the game.   On the other hand we have MarcoStyles who actually sat down and analyzed the older E3 footage to get some sense of the game. If you want to know stuff about the game, you watch MarcoStyles because he actually makes informative shit that isn't recycled garbage.

Like if they were there and got their hands on the game and both talked to the creative director, what system it was on either IS or ISN't, whereas the other info they share is based on critical thinking, eagle eye video watching, ect.  Anyway, like I said, I was NOT trying to cause a ruckus. I was just noting that there was an inconsistency.  Also, P.S, Marco's reasoning that the footage was on PC was, I believe, because it ""looked better"" than what he saw on xbox one. If that is true, and he went by eye instead of actually getting confirmation, then it isn't exactly the best source.  And regardless it doesn't even matter because most of the community and Marco himself believe that this e3 footage looks just as good as other footage (graphically I mean; this footage was a lot duller than others simply because of the weather)"

thedivision,3bwg7g,Strifedecer,10,Thu Jul 2 18:39:25 2015 UTC,"I don't really mind walking around with a weapon at the ready. It makes sense to be in that state, especially in areas like the DZ where combat is bound to happen at a moments notice.  Although, I do think that in some parts of the game, it could be automatically turned off. Like, inside you Base of Operations, for example. No need to walk around looking like you're gonna pistol-whip someone in your own place. Or with certain areas of the Green Zone.  It's something to be explored."
thedivision,3bwg7g,Keelan13,2,Thu Jul 2 18:45:34 2015 UTC,Weapon /shoulder strap would be cool
thedivision,3bwg7g,Soul17,2,Thu Jul 2 23:34:44 2015 UTC,"Having weapon out is one thing, but way too often we can't even lower it. Basically you end up running around aiming at people constantly."
thedivision,3bwg7g,Meior,2,Thu Jul 2 21:26:31 2015 UTC,"In the footage they show them walking to the DZ just holding them, not in a ready position but just carrying. The female operative has the pistol held at her side with her arm almost straight, and the guys have it held diagonally across their torso. It's only once they start to run or are in the DZ that they're held ready to aim, so it seems like there is some sort of functional difference in how they're carried.  But I do agree, it would be a nice option to have moments where (or a toggle button) the weapons can actually be holstered if desired."
thedivision,3bwg7g,Keelan13,3,Thu Jul 2 21:42:04 2015 UTC,"Totally offtopic, but your (the OPs) flair made me laugh :D"

thedivision,3bwg7g,JokerUnique,2,Fri Jul 3 11:47:49 2015 UTC,"Usually there is a key to holster the weapon and if you are in a Base of Operations or something like that, you usually holster the weapon automatically. So we'll see how they handle that in The Division."
thedivision,3bwg7g,le0wyatt,2,Thu Jul 2 19:21:47 2015 UTC,I am pretty sure they have said the social spaces will be combat free so I suspect you will not be able to draw your weapon.

thedivision,3bwg7g,chemx32,2,Fri Jul 3 00:32:56 2015 UTC,"The Wildlands is made with a new in-house engine of Ubi Paris, not Snowdrop.  Which is not surprising because Ubi likes to have diffferent engines for different franchises"
thedivision,3bwg7g,ssszenith,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:13:28 2015 UTC,if you check the models you will notice an astonishing similarity  and the dif names they use don't change the fact that it's all the same
thedivision,3bwg7g,chemx32,1 point,Fri Jul 3 05:15:02 2015 UTC,"The models can look exactly similar and it can still be on different engines.  The engine does not ""create"" models. They officially confirmed that its on a new engine and I don't see any reason to lie about that.  Also when Wildlands' development started Snowdrop was also in development, so there's that"
thedivision,3bwg7g,JokerUnique,1 point,Fri Jul 3 05:34:16 2015 UTC,"The only reason studios like to use the same engine for their games is the simple reason to recycle resources. Cars, models, houses or people are props that no one wants to build again and again for each game so they recycle from game to game. Dragon Age Inquisition will be the template for Mass Effect 4, The Division will be re-purposed for the sequels and other open-world titles. This is how they save costs..."
thedivision,3bwg7g,AceCAPPY13,1 point,Fri Jul 3 05:43:57 2015 UTC,I would like it if you could press a button and you can relax like putting the gun across your torso as you move around the map when not in combat but then when you find enemies instead of it instantly snapping back you have to press that button to make you go back to ADS

thedivision,3bvgqk,AceCAPPY13,14,Thu Jul 2 14:05:39 2015 UTC,It would be great to have some become good friends. Almost like companions (but we know that they won't be able to help you in a squad). It would be awesome to be able to invite families or individuals into the base of Operations for shelter and protection.   I basically want to form relationships and communities with the NPCs. I don't want a GTA V NPC system where none of them are interactive really. I'd prefer something closer to Elder Scrolls or Fallout.

thedivision,3bvgqk,ItsPaPPy,4,Thu Jul 2 15:12:36 2015 UTC,"I would like to see Vendors being able to be friends, and they may give you exclusive stock or a discount. Not something too big as to make the game unbalanced, just like a slightly better weapon or a 5% to 10% discount."

thedivision,3bvgqk,chrisv25,2,Thu Jul 2 17:16:29 2015 UTC,"It won't be anything like ME because you won't have NPC companions, but I think they did show at some point that there would be infected people walking around and you could decide whether to heal them, kill them, or just let them go on their way and possibly infect others. And your choice should affect the health/contagion of the area."
thedivision,3bvgqk,Joker328,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:31:30 2015 UTC,The infect others is from Marcos fake alpha tester.   But yea I've been wondering if there is something like a paragon/renegade system with different solutions to a problem.

In the process you forget to double check and BS is out. But he apologized and stood to his mistake. We just have to check who said what.... what is a leak and what is from the developers..."
thedivision,3bvgqk,JokerUnique,3,Fri Jul 3 05:39:48 2015 UTC,"The problem is, when we have a mute hero, then it is hard to develop a connection with the people - and we are also in a group of four, so it will be difficult to create this savior feeling. But it would be cool to talk to the people, hear their stories and what happened to them since the collapse....  Those small personal stories made games like Mass Effect, Fallout or Witcher special, but IMO i expect more ECHO-graphics than long conversations... but since we haven't seen anything of that, this is speculation..."
thedivision,3bvgqk,JokerUnique,3,Thu Jul 2 17:40:52 2015 UTC,"when we have a mute hero, then it is hard to develop a connection with the people - and we are also in a group of four   Yeah, this is the real issue. There's no way for you to develop personal relationships with NPCs in a co-op setting. I am betting that outside the base of operations it will mostly just be NPCs talking at you with no interaction."
thedivision,3bvgqk,Joker328,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:51:06 2015 UTC,I expect something like Borderlands... one player can start the Dialog to an NPCs and then he talks to the whole group and doesn't expect an answer.

Shit like that isn't worth my time."
thedivision,3bvgqk,Astro_Gamer,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:36:52 2015 UTC,Yeah i could imagine it being like that.Some NPC gives you a mission to track down his family or what happened to his family.

thedivision,3bvtbt,chemx32,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:42:17 2015 UTC,"I love how Ubisoft handles their marketing for their games, with cool trailers and songs, but I feel their ""marketing"" on The Division is not upto the mark with their other titles"

thedivision,3bsugv,wrkz,4,Wed Jul 1 22:10:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I like the idea that in the areas where you've spent a lot of time and really cleaned up the streets, locals will treat you like it's your neighborhood too and you belong there, but if you are new to an area, they will be justifiably wary of you. Could be a cool system if implemented well."

thedivision,3bsugv,le0wyatt,3,Thu Jul 2 09:29:26 2015 UTC,That would support the whole take back New York theme...
thedivision,3bsugv,JokerUnique,3,Thu Jul 2 09:34:20 2015 UTC,Not related to the article but was anything said about character creation in E3 or after? Couldn't follow that much because of timezones
thedivision,3bsugv,eCookie,2,Thu Jul 2 11:17:49 2015 UTC,"Face should be more presets than something fancy like Dragon Age inquisition. So there will be probably few preset faces to select from. (they were vague on that one)  Player customization  customization options:   physical appearance facial hair piercing tattoos   In addition to that, you can also customize what you are wearing:   Clothes can be customized (those have no impact on the stats) Gear will change with level as you gear up (like body-armor etc)"
thedivision,3bsugv,JokerUnique,2,Thu Jul 2 12:40:50 2015 UTC,Love the sound of the civilians reactions to you changing throughout the game sounds brilliant if it can be pulled off properly.
thedivision,3bsugv,AceCAPPY13,2,Thu Jul 2 11:11:52 2015 UTC,Really glad to hear this. Dynamic environments like these are features I feel make an integral part of a good open-world RPG. At the risk of sounding cliche...Destiny was really lacking there too.
thedivision,3bsugv,Strifedecer,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:37:29 2015 UTC,"Wow this is awesome. I love that they are discussing things that happened in early demos. Hopefully that means these things haven't been cut.  This is the first game that spans multiple years of development and feels like each build is just more of the same (in a good way) whereas with other games, each e3 or showcase is a bit of a disappointment."
thedivision,3bt68x,Timboron,2,Wed Jul 1 23:03:35 2015 UTC,I would be willing to bet that it will be playable.
thedivision,3bt68x,Boomslangg_,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:45:13 2015 UTC,"I am also considering coming. But, I've never been to a game convention so I don't know what to expect. Will I have to stand in line for few hours to play 15 minutes or how does it work?"
thedivision,3bt68x,Maert,3,Thu Jul 2 13:36:56 2015 UTC,"If you are going to Gamescom for the very first time, be prepared to wait. In terms of industry importance, E3 is the biggest show of the year, but in terms of scale, Gamescom is much, much bigger.  E3 is host to around 40,000 people, Gamescom around 400,000. Wednesday is press day, and that is honestly the best day to go (but understandably not open to the public) - the second the doors open on Thursday it is mayhem. It'll take you 30 minutes just to get OUT of a hall and into another, due to the sheer amount of people.  My advice, if Division is the thing you want to play, and it is at Gamescom - queue up early, make a beeline for the booth, and hope you're near the start.  Queue's for popular games can be 2 hours and up."
thedivision,3bt68x,ArekkzGaming,3,Thu Jul 2 14:48:08 2015 UTC,"Preperation is everything. Of course you can come blind, queue up for CoD and wait 4 hours to play 15 minutes. Check out which developers/publishers have which games/events at Gamescom. Set preferences for 1-4 must see things and then stuff that is more nice to have. For example, my friends and me wanted to see Oculus Rift and Heroes of the Storm last year. So we rushed to it in the morning and waited 1 and 1,5 hours at the booths which was okay. This leads to the next point: Come early! Be at the area at least half an hour before Gamescom opens. You have to get age verification wristbands and be in one of the big lines which check your ticket. When you are amongst the first to be in you can decrease waiting times significantly for the big stuff. The tips that say that in the middle of the day the lines are shorter because everyone is eating are bullshit. Grab something to eat while walking from one event to another. This will be an exhausting day but it will be worth it! Something to do while waiting in lines is good. We played cards last year and will definitely do so this year. Maybe a book if you go alone. There is a hall dedicated to indie developers and other not so big events. It is great; you can play many different ideas without waiting at all (almost) and talk to the developers. Pay attention to all lines. There will be surprises where you won't have as long as you would have expected. Last year we walked past the Ubisoft booth and noticed there was only a 30 minute line for Far Cry 4. No question we took that opportunity. Don't be afraid to ask anyone at the event. We are all gamers and developers, PR guys are walking around waiting for your questions. The giveaways are not worth it most of the time, the chance to get something is too little (yeah, they throw Iphones in the crowd but you will propably die when you try to get one).   There is definitely more to know, just ask if you have more specific questions."

The Collector's Edition of the game is the most complete version, and also includes physical merchandise. Since you pre-order you will also receive the pre-order bonus content."

thedivision,3bogrn,tifugod,16,Tue Jun 30 21:19:50 2015 UTC,"I was thinking about this a lot after E3, and I came to the same conclusion: that they must have done it this way on purpose because the alternative didn't work. And then I was thinking about why this might have been the case, besides just wanting more of an RPG feel than a tactical shooter feel.  One possibility that occurred to me was that a 2-3 shot kill mechanic like COD or something would be devastating given the betrayal possibilities in the dark zone. If you encountered another team in the dark zone, it would essentially be a case of ""whoever shoots first, wins"" which wouldn't be very fun, especially if you had some sweet loot. With a higher TTK, there is more opportunity to react, heal, or hide behind cover and return fire. Higher TTK would seem to discourage betrayal (because there is risk you will lose to a better opponent) and reduce the likelihood of the dark zone devolving into team deathmatch. So ultimately I think you are right that they will stick with a high TTK, and I'm basically OK with it at this point."
thedivision,3bogrn,Joker328,3,Tue Jun 30 22:55:05 2015 UTC,This is the best explanation for longer TTK I've seen! Excellent reasoning :)
thedivision,3bogrn,Boomslangg_,3,Tue Jun 30 23:12:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. I'm OK with the higher TTK as long as it still rewards tactical playing, and from what other posters here are saying, it does."
thedivision,3bogrn,exodus1028,2,Tue Jun 30 23:21:02 2015 UTC,"Exactly what i feel and think.  If the game allows you to down 2-4 people by just dumping one mag, this would essentially negate any incentives for squadplay. In my experience people in online shooters tend to lean more towards a lone-wolfing style, instead of caring for squadmembers. I'm talking about public games with randomized squads, not clan-squads obviously.  I dont have a problem with such mechanics, but i dont want them to be in TD honestly.   Also, as we dont have a real idea of the mapdesign, a lower TTK may also promote camping. I generally dont like the idea of random instakills, where you dont have any chance on avoiding it. If I want quick kills I can log in Battlefield or something. Also dont forget the loot. BF/COD doesnt has loot you can lose. So if they match TDs TTK to match said shooters, the penalty for dieing would be MUCH higher.  So, looking at TD, I prefer this design-choice, if they consciously chose that. It encourages playing together clearly."
thedivision,3bogrn,2legsakimbo,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:47:28 2015 UTC,so situational awareness isnt important. its more running around and gunning at each other. especially with neon name markers and health bars above everyone's heads. could be a nice casual diversion of a game but not sure why it has the Tom Clancy name.
thedivision,3bogrn,JokerUnique,5,Fri Jul 3 14:52:16 2015 UTC,"yep among the downgrade screaming the bullet-sponge was one of the most complaints from the gameplay.  But they forget some key-elements of the Division. The Division is NOT a tactical shooter, it is NOT a simulation and it is NOT a shooting-gallery like Call of Duty or Battlefield. It is an RPG with roles, gear, skills, healer and other attributes that buff a player and make him a lot stronger based on armor and damage-medication.   Also you have to know that an RPG with the holy-trinity in place (healer, damage dealer and tank) that there is a specific kill order a group has to follow and if each person of the group knows what he is doing, does focus-fire and does coordinated attacks, the other players die very fast when they are not careful.   If you consider that, the whole bullet-sponge is not that dramatic and is only the result of players that try to play the game like it was any other PvP shooter.   So yes, the ""bullet-sponge"" model is intentional but if you follow Bronson or any other player that is in the middle of the crossfire, they die almost instantly,"
thedivision,3bogrn,JokerUnique,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:46:04 2015 UTC,"Speaking of the holy trinity, are there any details about the aggro system? I can't recall anybody mentioning anything about it, although the devs have stressed repeatedly that this is a traditional RPG."
thedivision,3bogrn,Boomslangg_,2,Tue Jun 30 21:52:23 2015 UTC,"yes there is an aggro/tread system in place that can be influenced - basically the only way a tank can to his job.    Ryan Barnard: Because of the nature of group combat in The Division, the behavior of enemies will be directed by what Barnard refers to as ""sometimes called threat, sometimes called aggro"" in games. ""We need an aggro system or a threat system that I can effect as a player. So that I can draw the attention of an enemy or drop the attention of an enemy based on skills and where I position myself in a fight,"" he explained.    gamespot.com"
thedivision,3bogrn,Boomslangg_,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:19:13 2015 UTC,"To piggyback on your ""bullet-sponge"" comment, there seems to be a sweet spot with it. You want enough sponginess to discourage twitch playing, but not enough to discourage tactical playing. e.g. getting the flank on someone. It's not super clear in the E3 videos how exaggerated the sponginess is, since from what I understand most of the players weren't really trying to be tactical."
thedivision,3bogrn,Boomslangg_,6,Tue Jun 30 22:19:02 2015 UTC,"I thought that the time to kill was fine. I've played it, and I didn't have any issues taking down targets. I would focus fire, and would get help form my teammates as well so it went really smooth in that regard. I like the longer TTK because it makes teamplay more valuable."
thedivision,3bogrn,LuxSolisPax,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:11:10 2015 UTC,This seems to be the consensus so far. Focus fire and teamwork lowers the TTK a great deal. Twitch-shooting makes the TTK really high compared to Battlefield of Duty.
thedivision,3bogrn,SuperCatThief,2,Tue Jun 30 23:23:00 2015 UTC,Yeah everyone is too used to games like CoD and BF when they went into this. It's an RPG first and foremost. So TTK will reflect that.
thedivision,3bogrn,Strifedecer,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:42:14 2015 UTC,"Actually, can you clarify how much ammo would it take to down someone using focus-fire? The only barometer I have is a comment that it took ""a magazine and a half"" (or so) to down someone. Is it less with focus fire? What about flanking?"
thedivision,3bogrn,Shnitzki,2,Tue Jun 30 23:25:55 2015 UTC,"I killed other players in 4-5 headshots, or 10-12 body shots with the DMR. The assault rifle was roughly 6-7 headshots and 16-17 body shots. So basically 3/4 of a clip to kill other players. Now the cleaners would definitely take a clip and half to kill. But thats to be expected because of their level of difficulty."
thedivision,3bogrn,JokerUnique,6,Wed Jul 1 01:41:33 2015 UTC,"I noticed that in a lot of videos nobody would focus fire. They wouldn't even shoot what their turret was shooting at, nor would they use grenades as a signal to shoot the enemy that was just hit. Everyone just seemed to choose targets at random.  This fact alone makes me question people's evaluation of time to kill."
thedivision,3bogrn,GandalfTheyGay,2,Tue Jun 30 22:15:16 2015 UTC,"Yes, this makes sense. I remember a comment from someone saying that all the E3 players in the Dark Zone were just randomly shooting at each other. So maybe we won't get a good evaluation of the ""real"" TKK until the next playable demo."
thedivision,3bogrn,Saviorself7,2,Tue Jun 30 22:20:34 2015 UTC,I think this was the biggest issue. I think the best representation of TTK was when the two group of 3 players killed off that rogue team and then went after each other. It seemed like players went down pretty dang quick then.
thedivision,3bogrn,diki_fin,2,Wed Jul 1 01:03:05 2015 UTC,"Also, its an RPG, so TTK will just depend on gear and enemy level (enemies including players). That's probably why stealth takedowns were removed in the first place."

thedivision,3bngr7,Shadow38383,7,Tue Jun 30 17:04:14 2015 UTC,"I hate when I get a gun I really like, but then have to switch to a higher level gun, that I hate, simply because I need to do more damage. I'm hoping The Division will have a nice sweet spot where it's not just use gun for 10 minutes, discard/breakdown, use new gun for 15 minutes, discard/breakdown I hope it's more of get a base gun at a higher level, but really tweak it via attachments so you can still have that same feel as a previous lower level weapon. Am I making any sense? What year is it?"
thedivision,3bngr7,hoyhoygames,3,Tue Jun 30 18:53:44 2015 UTC,it is still unclear if level 10 weapon makes 100 damage and a level 20 weapon 2000 - so maybe you can hold on to your weapon longer - but in the end it has to be replaced. Unless they go the Star Wars Old Republic road where the adaptive weapons and armor are nothing more than shells and the mods you put in define the damage and the stats of the weapon. This way you could wear the same weapons and armor from 1 to 60 and only change the mods.   But based on what we saw at E3 this is not the case - it appears each weapon has a specific damage value and you can enhance that with mods...
thedivision,3bngr7,JokerUnique,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:23:52 2015 UTC,"Right, I definitely don't expect to be keeping the same guns the entire progression, it's just some games make them too disposable."
thedivision,3bngr7,hoyhoygames,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:17:00 2015 UTC,I thought I heard them say at E3 they were not going the SWOTR route of endlessly upgradable weapons (i.e. that you would need to get new ones as you level up). Can't remember when/where I heard it though.
thedivision,3bngr7,Joker328,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:17:40 2015 UTC,"As said above, this is not the case, it is just the SWOTR way and was an example how they deal with the weapons.   At E3 they said that each weapon has a specific level that decides if you can use it or not. You will outlevel that weapon and you'll need to replace it. So you will constantly search and replace your gear and weapons. And this is what the usual MMO/RPG way is."
thedivision,3bngr7,JokerUnique,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:25:52 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I misread your post. I thought you were saying it was unclear whether they were going that way."
thedivision,3bngr7,Joker328,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:34:43 2015 UTC,no problem. yea the Star Wars insert should have been better separated from the rest. But better to ask.
thedivision,3bngr7,JokerUnique,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:40:51 2015 UTC,"Same...really hope they add in the XM8 frame for one of the guns. :3 but this is where it The Division really needs to make the difference between Destiny and its self. Your idea really allows the game to make it noticed and equal in terms of loot system, but better."
thedivision,3bngr7,Dreadnought05,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:27:24 2015 UTC,"I would hope that at max level, all weapons would be available so the one you like can be used at end game, rather than being forced to use a specific weapon."
thedivision,3bngr7,Strifedecer,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:53:58 2015 UTC,"Dude, its an RPG. Dragon Age, Destiny, Skyrim...loot works more or less the same in this genre."
thedivision,3bngr7,Joker328,5,Thu Jul 2 18:40:57 2015 UTC,"Anyone else think the nature of the loot grind is a stupid reason to get hyped for a game? Why would you get excited over a completely contrived mechanic designed to ensure you are never satisfied and keep you playing beyond the point where you are really enjoying the gameplay? It's like saying you enjoy buying a new iphone every year. I guess maybe some people do, but I don't think the reason people love Apple is because of planned obsolescence.  There's so much more potential in this game than the loot grind which they all but admitted is going to be a Destiny ripoff anyway. If they fail to deliver on that potential but have the best loot system ever, I will consider it a failure."
thedivision,3bngr7,tifugod,2,Tue Jun 30 20:32:09 2015 UTC,"Yes. It's an artificially contrived solution to an artificially contrived problem. But the loot grind is also a powerful positive-reinforcement loop, and I don't see MMOs getting around that unless they can replace it with something equally as strong.   I guess there's the rub. If The Division (hypothetically) was not to rely on ""loot"" as the prime motivation to keep grinding, what would it rely on?  (edit - synonyms)"
thedivision,3bngr7,Joker328,2,Tue Jun 30 20:54:03 2015 UTC,"But the loot grind is also a powerful positive-reinforcement loop, and I don't see MMOs getting around that...   I agree, but that doesn't mean I am hyped up about it. Like ""Oooh! Positive-reinforcement loops! Shut up and take my money!""   what would it rely on?   Um, gameplay experiences that are sufficiently fun, engaging, and unique that I want to keep coming back to explore new areas, meet new people, and have new adventures. Look at MMOs that have been successful over the long term like WOW. Yes there is level and loot grinding, but so many people are already at the level cap, but people keep coming back because it's a fun experience that they share with friends. And then they keep adding new content to keep you engaged. It's not just new ""stuff"" for you to get, it's actually new experiences for you to share. That's all I want: for them to build a world that I want to keep going back to."
thedivision,3bngr7,tifugod,3,Tue Jun 30 22:40:38 2015 UTC,"I'm 220% sympathetic to you. I used to play a lot of RPGs as a kid and it was the atmosphere, sense of exploration and mystery that really kept me going.   It's tough to feel that with games now - I'm not sure if that's a side effect of getting older or if I'm just bored of the standard tropes and fetch-quests.   I'm hoping the devs at Massive have enough creative control that they can try some unique things to keep players engaged. Yeah, loot is fine but I'd like to also see some strategic meta-gaming too, a variety of areas that demand very different playing styles, and a plot that doesn't lead the player around by the hand. I'd love to feel like a detective where I actually have to figure out where to go, what passcode to put in, etc. Rather than being led around by the hand. I suppose that would be difficult to implement, but I'm hungry for something different, especially after Destiny."
thedivision,3bngr7,LuxSolisPax,2,Tue Jun 30 22:58:47 2015 UTC,"I'm interested in how they dress up the loot quest, but at the end of the day the core driver of the game is the grind. It may not be what drives the narrative, but it's what will drive the player long past the narrative's completion. It is the primary means of collecting resources within the game. Naturally, a loot quest can be made more engaging if properly woven into the narrative. I find Witcher's approach to this particularly engrossing.  With that in mind, I think it's important to carefully consider the nature of the game's loot grind. There are good grinds, and there are bad grinds. Destiny's grind is especially atrocious due to the uneven nature of effort and reward.  Let's consider Destiny's first raid. It is without a doubt a huge task not seen before by console gamers. I recall average playtimes when the Vault of Glass (the raid) was first released at 4 hours. However, you could end a run and receive nothing but upgrade materials. Truth be told, this was common. Even the final boss would not guarantee a unique item, such as a weapon, or armor piece. The player base came to expect essentially nothing to show for their effort. This was especially infuriating as player level is tied to armor pieces.  Now let's consider Diablo's loot grind. After every major boss encounter you are guaranteed a legendary drop. It may not be precisely what you need at the moment, but you won't be left holding nothing. If it's not something you want, you can break it down into materials to create something you would prefer or trade it within the auction house for a piece you're missing. In this structure you will always get something valuable for your effort. It may not come in a perfect format, but it has value no matter what.  On the surface, both these games are built around a loot grind. One however is inherently rewarding while the other is aggravating by nature. Had Destiny not completely randomized your chance at loot, it would have eased tensions between the player base and Bungie."
thedivision,3bngr7,JokerUnique,2,Tue Jun 30 21:10:54 2015 UTC,"Loot grind is a core part of any game like this, you can mask it, you can hide it but in the end you farm something to buy something better.   I hate it, when it is completely random. I don't mind working for something, farm something, kill something for hours (yes I have done that) but in the end it has to be rewarding. I do this raid / this groupmission / kill this boss and then I get the item I need from his loot-table or the tokens or what ever that I can trade to gear by vendors.   This way you are working to a specific goal, to max out your character, complete a armor-set or get a specific legendary that fit perfectly to the character-build you are running.   If it completely random and I don't know where to search for a specific item, I burn out very fast and lose the motivation to continue the grind, because effort / result are just not there...  This is why my vote is for specific loot tables or tokens that can be traded for specific armor-parts that is needed for the character."
thedivision,3bngr7,thirsty904,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:24:16 2015 UTC,If I have to grind for top weapons I may skip this and just play Ghosts.
thedivision,3bngr7,JokerUnique,3,Tue Jun 30 22:00:57 2015 UTC,"Many questions^  So to get the easy ones out of the way, yes there is trading between players (this is also mentioned on the official game page) and a black market was mentioned where you can sell items but so far not more details were revealed.   Each character has apparently 5 armor slots to equip gear that changes your stats - but you can also wear clothing that has no impact on the stats - Jacket, T-shirt, trousers etc, and here you can really customize your character and make it special. So even if every player has the same 5 gear-elements equipped in endgame, they will still look completely different because of what they are wearing beside them. So yes you should be able to be very unique.   The weapon question I can't answer. But you have 5 weapon-archetypes and in these archetypes you have different rarities, different mods and different specialties. Also there is a skin-slot so you can color the weapon as you wish. But if you will find the identical weapon twice at level 12 and at max-level, I don't know. But with the mods etc you can change any weapon you find to your play-style.  Borderlands had a very detailed weapon system, we could have something similar here, but since this is a more realistic approach there are only limited options in terms of variety.   This is all based on some quotes the devs made over the last year and at E3 but in the end we have only seen glimpses of the customization-system in the last community-Q&A video and many aspects are still vague or never shown. So this is subject to change... does that answer your questions a bit..."

thedivision,3bngr7,Maert,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:13:56 2015 UTC,They were very hush hush about the hole trading stuff at E3. The black market was mentioned quite a while ago and was never more clarified and also not denied at E3.   So IMO there is something like a trade network or a black market in the game but they keep it under wraps because of item duping and dangers like that. But what shape or form this is going to have is not clear at the moment....

thedivision,3bngr7,EwokStomper,2,Wed Jul 1 09:46:38 2015 UTC,"Hamish explained in the Q&A that there will be a skin-slot on your weapon that allows you to colorize your weapon.

Not really revealing any specific names, but there are definitely more. I believe they also stated there are some enemies that don't really belong to any specific faction and are like lone wolves. I noticed in the E3 trailer they showed a guy towards the beginning with a riot shield and a fire axe. Seemed like he was with the cleaners, which would make him a different enemy type within their faction. I wonder if we'll be able to use the shield and/or fire axe, but considering there's isn't really melee, I'd say the fire axe is probably a no."

Does the faction fit with the theme and tone of the game?   and now think who and what we could meet. Left behind soldiers, police-forces, fireman, homeless people, monks, martial arts fighter like Samurais, cannibals in the sewers, mad scientists or just thugs or traders that try to survive.

I fully expect this game to go the same way as Watch_Dogs, so you may as well get to experience it for free before committing to a purchase after it's out.  After all, you can cancels your pre order at any time and pay nothing until a week before it's released and the 'beta' will be pretty representative of the final product, since they're glorified demos these days.  Apart from that, pre ordering a game way in advance usually means you get a pretty big discount (sometimes over £10) and of course delivery to your door the day it's released (and sometimes a day or two before if you're lucky).  Not that I'm for preordering, but it does have some benefits. In this case, abusing the guaranteed beta entry to see how good or bad this game is on PC is one of them."

It seems that even on the amazon UK site it is only the standard hard copy (DVD) that is listed as unavailable. The 'sleeper agent' hard copy is still there as well as the digital downloads for standard and gold.   When I see something like that it makes me think that there have been production issues. As in - they now know that they can only guarantee a certain number of DVDS to amazon UK, so they still run with as many collectors editions as they can because they make more profit. If there are any left after that it probably went first come first serve to the standard edition and you just didn't make the cut."
thedivision,3bkzcc,ChiefDraggingCanoe,4,Tue Jun 30 01:59:53 2015 UTC,"This is also something I've been searching for specifics over the last few days. How do we max out our characters - especially the specific roles.  The tank needs other specs than a healer - he needs damage medication and as much armor as possible - while a healer needs to be mobile and do more healing.   As described in Marcos video there are apparently different prefixes to all the gear. Riot, Operative, Tactical etc, and IMO this is the hint you have to what role this piece of armor is relative. Riot is tank, operative sniper etc.   at least this is my theory at the moment, this has not been confirmed."

thedivision,3biaw0,spainman,9,Mon Jun 29 19:22:41 2015 UTC,"(just add that here too)   not much has changed. But the more rare the gun is, the more damage it does and the more slots it has - interesting.  Also if the gear has different categories (Riot / Tactical / Expedition / Operative) this could be the first hint we have, how we support our role in the game with the gear we wear. Maybe each category supports another role. Riot could be tank gear and has more damage reduction wile tactical gives more critical damage.  What do you think?"
thedivision,3biaw0,JokerUnique,4,Mon Jun 29 13:31:51 2015 UTC,So something like riot=defense/assault like turrets and close-up operative=stealth/crit and long-range expadition=heal/scan and mid -range tactical=explosive/idk and mid-range. Obviously with the ability to mix and match
thedivision,3biaw0,Nick_Voso,3,Mon Jun 29 14:23:16 2015 UTC,Exactly. Would make sense and also fit the usual MMO-mechanics where you have different Armor sets to complete and each set is for a specific role with specific buffs.
thedivision,3biaw0,JokerUnique,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:32:00 2015 UTC,"Depending on storage space and the ability to reroll skills, things could get interesting with the ability to change rapidly on the fly as different things are needed"
thedivision,3biaw0,Nick_Voso,2,Mon Jun 29 16:46:36 2015 UTC,"In the end it also depends how far the re-spec on the fly goes. It has been stated in earlier interviews, that we have to go to the starting area - probably a social zone - to re-spec the character. Probably you can only select skills on the fly that are already unlocked. But this is speculation.  Also maybe some talents need to be leveled up by using a specific weapon or what ever, then if you really want to max out a role, you have to stick with it.   But yea these are some of the questions I have about character progression at the moment..."
thedivision,3biaw0,JokerUnique,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:37:27 2015 UTC,"See that must've been one of the interviews or so that I missed. Figured there was a catch to the whole respec option, but still not terrible depending on that additional info. It might make sense that you can only progress so far in total and how you split it up is up to you. Thus the multiple character slots. I think, who knows though"
thedivision,3biaw0,Nick_Voso,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:45:21 2015 UTC,"Well IMO it makes sense that you won't be able to unlock every skill that is in the tree.

thedivision,3biaw0,JokerUnique,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:12:43 2015 UTC,"I have this strange feeling it will be similar to Diablo 3 regarding the talents. Everything will get unlocked, but you can only choose like 6 active and 3 passive.   So with The Division, you get your two active skills but can passively change with different attributes. Which I believe has been stated by the devs.   I'm still not sure how are the talents and skills differentiated though. Hopefully Marco will go into this in his next video.  Regarding the gear and it's different categories. This is similar to Diablo 3 as well. You had gear labeled ""of the bear, of the fox"" and so forth. Each of these had their own set of stats tgat you would find on the gear. If TCTD goes this route, I think that as close to ""classes"" we will get. (Keeping aside D3 is a true to style rpg with actual classes)"
thedivision,3biaw0,rjeBrewer,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:22:34 2015 UTC,"Skills are active abilities like Seeker Mine or Sticky bomb that can be activated. Talents are passive skills - some leakes named shotgun talents etc - but how they are leveled or if there are role specific skills, is unknown at the moment.

I am kind of sad that some things have been cut from the game, but it's understandable.  I only hope that they can instead add other things to keep this game as deep as I was initially expecting it to be.  Depth is what really hooks players and maintains replayability because instead of just exploring a story or a world, now they can explore all of the various game mechanics.  Take a look at the new Metal Gear Solid game, for instance.  That game is going to be insanely deep and I fully expect to be playing the story over and over and over again in between multiplayer matches and base infiltration in the new Metal Gear Online.  It's got a deep customization section and so many, many, many ways to approach story missions and objectives.  I really want the Division to be a game where I can dive right in and get totally lost in the story and mechanics (in a good way, not in a wtfisthisidon'teven kind of way)."

So it either something like that or put together a cure and weed out the enemy factions in New York.   The story of the Dark Zone mentioned that they tried to find a cure there and when they left the last chance to create a cure was left behind with all the other equipment - so maybe the main goal for the game - like in S.T.A.L.K.E.R. - is to get good enough gear to reach the core of the Dark Zone to get the cure.

There is the tag line for the game ""save what remains"" so is your mission to clear out the areas so they can begin the cleanup?  Or are they going to go down the route of trying to find a cure for the disease?  If they have long term plans for the game then they might combine the 2 stories routes of first trying to find a cure which takes you on the path of finding who/what causes the virus and then trying to take back New York.   One thing I do like about it is that when challenged about stuff Ryan keeps saying he wants us to experience the story ourselves.

Since we will have level-progression in the districts that tell us where we can go and where not, there will probably be a very clear path through New York.

thedivision,3bhwfo,diki_fin,1 point,Mon Jun 29 12:01:15 2015 UTC,"In Destiny LFG the sherpa-term is used to descripe a Raid run where the experienced player ""sherpa"" guides the new unexperienced players through the raid. Teaches them the game mechanics and shows them around the places and loot boxes. These are the playthroughs where the sherpa will give a lot time to new players during the playthrough. In Destiny there is zero possibility to stab players in the back and stole their loot. In Division there is the possibility to steal other players picked up loot. This would be ver harmful to the games community if experienced players would stole the legendary if ""noob"" would get it with them.  How to avoid this? Maybe somekind of mechanicsm that works by the PSN ID or GT. If the Gamertag the user is providing is in the blacklist of backstabbers the post of finding other players wouldn't work.  Edit. The only problem really is the reporting system."
thedivision,3bhwfo,JokerUnique,2,Mon Jun 29 12:23:16 2015 UTC,"The whole backstabbing-stuff is Dark Zone only - PvE / Raid / and stuff is completely other content and here you can't steal the loot because it is private. Unless they make a loot-master-functionality for Raids where the raid-leader collects the loot and then rolls it out to the players.   But I like the sherpa-system (I've never played Destiny) because usually when you search for raids then it is always e&e requested, and how do you get experience, you have to do the raids and have some explanation how to run them or what is expected in terms of skills / gear and weapons.   And based on past experiences, it is hard to beat a raid with first-timers and it takes long, but it is also rewarding when it works out and you have taught them something for future runs..."

Good idea: Jup, you can make sure that no one is going to backstab you and you're guarenteed your safety and your nice loot when it drops. You can prevent people for teaming up with a blacklisted guy and spare them the time/effort it takes to get through a darkzone. bad idea: this is where the general idea of the darkzone comes in. Massive made it specificaly this way to encourage PvP and adding the ""backstabbing"" element, also it's punished by going rogue. I generally don't want to mess with Massive's concept of this since it's even more rewarding knowing you completed a darkzone and that you had such good teamwork that none of your teammates killed you in the process to get your loot.

This is the breaking point for me, if you explicitly try to find reliable posse to Dark Zone, is there any add on value to some site if they're unreliable as the people from the in-game matchmaking."

Might be something to consider instead of creating a whole new website, just making a LFG subreddit where all the systems are already in place and you just have to do a bit of design work. They got a sidebar that lets you sort between all the systems and the separate heists. Check it out https://www.reddit.com/r/HeistTeams/  It would just be a shame to have this grandiose idea and someone will come along and make a simple subreddit which will prob get more attention. Sometimes simple is better, and we all like Reddit already.  I created 4 subreddits to reserve the name if you want to use them, so nobody can take em. TheDarkZone, DarkZone, BaseOfOperations and DarkZoneAgents. The dark zone is already an iconic name in The Division so I figured it would be recognizable for a subreddit to find a team.

thedivision,3bj4wo,JokerUnique,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:11:39 2015 UTC,"Officially I have not seen anything saying if they would be in the game or not. Depending on how data is collected and stored, we might see some people build there own on community sites.  Personally I could not care less about leaderboards. But that's just my opinion.   If they were to be added ingame, I would imagine they would be collected Via the Xbox live/ Psn Much like achievements. so somewhere you could log into your ""Hub"" if you will to see your stats"
thedivision,3bj4wo,Nanners_Sananab,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:39:52 2015 UTC,I prefer leaderboards that represent skill instead of hours played (insert mode). Newer (good) players should be able to make it to the top 100 and not have it occupied by 1st day players or no-livers
thedivision,3bi9kn,punkydrummer,2,Mon Jun 29 13:15:09 2015 UTC,"not much has changed. But the more rare the gun is, the more damage it does and the more slots it has - interesting.   Also if the gear has different categories (Riot / Tactical / Expedition / Operative) this could be the first hint we have, how we support our role in the game with the gear we wear. Maybe each category supports another role. Riot could be tank gear and has more damage reduction wile tactical gives more critical damage.   What do you think?"
thedivision,3bi9kn,JokerUnique,1 point,Mon Jun 29 13:30:42 2015 UTC,"the gear categories could be entirely cosmetic, if they go for 'categories support your role' then it kind ruins the whole ""classless"" system"
thedivision,3bi9kn,JokerUnique,3,Mon Jun 29 13:41:35 2015 UTC,"Classless only means, that you don't have to create multiple characters because you want to play different roles (damage Dealer, medic or tank) - but skills are clearly dedicated to specific roles, so it would make sense, that there is also specific gear, that helps you max out your role."
thedivision,3bi9kn,MarcoStyleNL,1 point,Mon Jun 29 13:45:43 2015 UTC,"very possible! maybe one type of gear also slows you down more than another.... but again.. the statistics on ethese items were literally all over the place, no consistancy at all.. even if they had the same level and rarity.. so I don't know.."
thedivision,3bi9kn,Keelan13,2,Mon Jun 29 13:56:39 2015 UTC,"I think part of that has to do with them being used for the demo purposes. I'm sure in the final game build the stats will make sense and be balanced, but since we weren't going to be able to access the loot weapons, the stats didn't matter so much...  Also, another great video, Marco! Been looking forward to this one after what we talked about during lunch that day. :)  Amazing job with the motion graphics work in this one. Very cool and makes it stand out from the others where you used mostly game footage. Well done indeed, my friend!"

thedivision,3bi9kn,JokerUnique,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:22:43 2015 UTC,yea they said in an interview that the whole customization/skill-stuff was cut from that demo to make it easier for E3 so that player could focus on the action and the combat. So the stats should make sense at launch or at least after some balancing in beta.
thedivision,3bi9kn,JokerUnique,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:32:10 2015 UTC,"I'm on the lookout how I can spec my build, because so far there is so little information how the character progression and the role-system works, so these are great details."
thedivision,3bi9kn,MarcoStyleNL,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:14:54 2015 UTC,a lot of people have been requesting character progression next.. so I guess that is up for next week.
thedivision,3bi9kn,JokerUnique,2,Mon Jun 29 14:21:19 2015 UTC,There are so many aspects of the character progression:   How pure and deep is the role-system How can I support my role with the gear Are the talents categorized to serve a specific role (like specific perks) Do I have to sacrifice something to max out my role (less DPS but more damage reduction)   I prefer the tank role as example because he is so difficult to spec. He needs damage medication to cancel out most of the incoming damage and skills as defensive cooldowns to survive damage-spikes. So far we have fortification in one of your videos but beyond that no skills that support this role that is confirmed officially.   But yea... those questions can only be answered to those who were on site because none of that was discussed in the official Q&As...
thedivision,3bi9kn,MarcoStyleNL,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:45:34 2015 UTC,I hope i'll be able to answer all of those.

thedivision,3bi9kn,tifugod,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:11:38 2015 UTC,"Based on the wide spread of gear stats, I'm curious as to how the game scales. Will a high-level character deal and absorb 3 x the damage of a low level player? (for example). Did the devs talk at all about how different gear levels translate into the Dark Zone? Will it be like Destiny's Crucible where gear levels don't matter? Or like Iron Banner where a high-level character can take headshot after headshot from low-level characters and not feel a thing?"
thedivision,3bi9kn,Flavvor,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:48:47 2015 UTC,The devs said you will be placed with others around your level when you enter the DZ.
thedivision,3biw43,FinaleNinja,3,Mon Jun 29 16:24:32 2015 UTC,"There is little confirmed information about the character progression.  But since the agents are sleeper operatives outside of the chain-of-command, IMO it wouldn't make much sense to attach a level to a military rank in this context."
thedivision,3biw43,JokerUnique,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:29:11 2015 UTC,"Ah I didnt know the part about ""outside the chain-of-command"" do you have any ideas about an alternative? I really would like to see something different than just normal level numbers some type of vanity level differentiation."
thedivision,3biw43,JokerUnique,3,Mon Jun 29 17:06:56 2015 UTC,"well you work alone and only have a Joint Task Force as ally to bring the order back to New York. So you are pretty much a one-man army. (with a lot of friends)  I think levels are ok for me. But other games work with titles that you can display that are linked to the story-progression. Like when you finish chapter 1 of the story and freed a prison from a gang you get the ""Warden of Rikers Island"" title and since achievements are something common today, you can get special titles from there to display that you have achieved something..."
thedivision,3biw43,rjeBrewer,2,Mon Jun 29 17:57:19 2015 UTC,"I like that idea.  Like killing 100 rogue players gets you the ""Rogue Destroyer"" title or something. Perhaps instead of ranks they could change the color of the display name or something every 5-10 levels. I'm big i to customization and vanity stuff like that. Mainly because I put major hours into games like this and i just like the game to reflect that in a way that is easily visible. Lets me show off."
thedivision,3biw43,NeoMan5,2,Mon Jun 29 18:10:27 2015 UTC,"I like this idea as well. Similar to Fable.   I also agree with joker. Having military name tags wouldn't fit in with the lore. The way they described who the agents are, you aren't even in the military (as far as I can tell).   Imo.. I like the traditional aspect of just leveling a character and with that number lvl, you can easily tell how far along another player and friend is."
thedivision,3biw43,SuperCatThief,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:58:13 2015 UTC,"That sounds like what they did with ME3 multiplayer (eventually) with their banners. That would be a neat idea, but I don't really care if named ranks are in or not, I would survive without it."

With levels, its just ""I'm level 21"".   What would it be with your system? ""Uhh I just unlocked the flamethrower ability for my turret...I think I'm 40% through the game?""  100% without a doubt there will be a leveling system; two of them actually, one overall level and then a Dark Zone level."

thedivision,3bfcks,Z4INL,10,Sun Jun 28 18:50:09 2015 UTC,"Raids would be interesting, and I wouldn't be against them. Just, trying to think how to do this without just being bullet sponges, in terms of harder enemies/""bosses"".   We expect guns/grenades/etc to kill other humans pretty quickly, so I feel like they'd have to get innovative in terms of mechanics so that raid fights wouldn't just be endless waves of bullet sponge enemies. Almost like an ""instanced story"" with multiple objectives that don't require just clearing enemies in a building."
thedivision,3bfcks,DaveKram,2,Sun Jun 28 19:51:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah i'm sure there's plenty of things Massive can do to make it possible, I wouldn't mind a singular enemy as long as they creatively and realistically explained why they're so hard to kill.... Maybe have objectives you need to do while fighting the enemy or maybe there's dangers around you making you have to keep changing position, this could make the boss fight last longer without giving him heaps of HP, it makes you hit him less often."
thedivision,3bfcks,DaveKram,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:01:08 2015 UTC,"Hmm, I dunno. As long as it makes sense into the rest of the game. I don't think just throwing in physically large bosses and a bunch of small NPC's and saying have at it, is a good idea. There needs to be a build up (of sub-story/objectives/etc) to a potential end boss; that like you said, has multiple objectives that make sense in the over-arching story/style of the game."
thedivision,3bfcks,GamerGypps,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:16:20 2015 UTC,"Yes, I definitely agree with that! I want it to make sense, it can't just be kill these guys for loot, even a Raid needs its own storyline. Different objectives other than simply killing would make it a lot more fun and probably less repetitive."
thedivision,3bfcks,tifugod,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:25:38 2015 UTC,Exactly what you said
thedivision,3bfcks,vDeschain,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:31:16 2015 UTC,"This is a completely off-the-wall idea, but I think it's be cool to see some tie-in with an NPC faction, where maybe you throw your lot in with them and then work (in real time) to help grow their power in the real world (establish bases, build up troop strength, maybe create different enemy types! etc). The fun would be that other players would ally themselves with other factions, and everyone fights over strategic locations, resources, etc. Since there is no direct PVP outside of the darkzone, players could maybe directly influence the #s, types, and strengths of the NPC faction in that area vis-a-vis all the other player characters.   It might be a way to keep people invested in the game, while feeling like what they do is still relevant, and changing things up somewhat. Like playing a big board game or something."
thedivision,3bfcks,AtomicVGZ,4,Mon Jun 29 19:41:55 2015 UTC,"Are instances already confirmed (so 3-man squad based runs)? Yes I would love raids. 8 number is a bit confusing, I would think they would go with 9 considering squads are 3-sized (3x3)   In terms of bullet sponges I absolutely agree they can't just give us a heavy and say ""he has extra armour, shoot him a thousand times"". The skyscraper idea sounds awesome. I think they could have several floors (or areas with multiple floors) and then a helipad on the roof where they keep all their loot (i.e. Boss Loot). Like you said the player might need to hold off enemies while they repair the elevator and then maybe need to find another elevator climb the cables and then a damaged fire escape to climb to the third area, to mix up the monotony. It could be the cleaners for example and they might have several mini-bosses before you get to the roof. So one might be a super-heavy flame thrower, while another might have remote charges in a 4-quad sized room. Setting each ablaze and require the player to move, avoiding the fire while fighting enemies. Boss with remote is out of reach, players need to hack or something to access the door he is in so they can execute him, while simultaneously holding off his goons. The final boss could be a bullet sponge, but maybe its a stolen armored Helicopter that rains down ""hell-fire"". On the roof of the skyscraper. This would be a huge build up as players climb the tower to finish the raid.   In that same theme they could also do an abandoned military base where a faction has fixed up one of the remaining tanks or armoured vehicle (as the final boss). That would require environmental attacks, traps or softening of the Armour (i.e. knock off outer layer of armour so your bullets can now penetrate).   For instances and raids I would love to see something like hostage rescue missions. For example a faction has captured several division agents or VIP politicians and you must extract them with various entry points. Then once that is complete the bulk of the raid would be about extracting them safely through waves of enemies, using unique tactics. Like setting four agents as the defense in diamond formation around the hostages while the other four clear the path ahead or leaving one-two snipers to babysit them while giving covering fire and six of you clear the paths ahead.   For another raid you might actually have the antagonist of the raid, the leader of a fake faction as an example called ""Legion"". Throughout the raid he's building up the final fight and antagonizing the players through radios and/or videos, pointing out specific players when they get downed (dynamic narration) or miss a shot. Then when you finally face him, instead of a bullet sponge you could have him show up with 100 clones dressed the same as him, all wearing the same mask. You won't find him until you cut down 80%-90% of his forces, at which point you'll need to arrest him and get to the extraction zone. But then you still need to fight the other 20% off if you do find him as they'll pick him back up. And maybe he could attempt to run to them. Just an idea...    If they're not going bullet sponges like Destiny, I'd say they just need to increase the amount of enemies. That would be unique and fun I think, feeling overwhelmed where it's like 50-100 guys against 8 trained agents with gadgetry."

Raids could be introduced/updated later because I doubt they're going to add it now if they haven't already. I'm not sure how they would mitigate the ""kill the bad guy a thousand times"" plot hole that most games have (like Destiny or WoW). Maybe they could make him/her/it anonymous and nameless?"
thedivision,3bfcks,Kreetak,1 point,Mon Jun 29 10:12:32 2015 UTC,"""Group Mission"" was shown in E3 2013-gameplay. 8+Player content was mentioned in a Ubiblog entry 2013 and they are looking very closely at the raidsystem of Destiny and if you saw Marcos last interview it is pretty clear that they want to include something like this.

thedivision,3bfcks,Maert,2,Sun Jun 28 19:28:08 2015 UTC,"I'm sure they can come up with something Creative, such as on the roof have some sort of drone in the air firing down at the players causing them to have to keep moving and staying out of the danger areas (where the drone is shooting).  Not really sure how that'd work story wise, not sure how geared the enemy factions are going to be to have a drone or a helicopter or something.  Edit: Could also have some really tanky and heavily armoured flamethrower guy in an enclosed area. He could move around slowly and spray his flamethrower in a cone in front of him causing the players to have to keep rotating around him so they don't get killed while slowly dwindling him down."

thedivision,3bfcks,PlayerThirty,2,Sun Jun 28 18:54:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah I figured it'd take a REALLY long time to work your way up the Empire State building :P  I guess you could skip levels? Have different ways of moving upwards such as an elevator, you could have a task within the raid of setting up a generator in order to get the elevator back online and once inside you get stopped on your way to the top? that way you'll have to exit elevator on a level that's higher up.  I'm sure they could come up with clever ways to make you go from the bottom level to the top without technically being able to explore the building from the bottom all the way to the top?  If that makes sense?"

I don't really like that there are bullet sponges already in the game. But at least they are a one explosive kill or almost full clip. Plus hopefully there can be cool stuff to do like covering teammates trying to get up ladders. Trying to blow up an armored up cleaners truck. Maybe sneak segments.
thedivision,3bfcks,Boomslangg_,3,Sun Jun 28 20:43:45 2015 UTC,"Yes i like the ladder idea a lot actually, it could be done interestingly because maybe they can do it so when they go up the ladders they can't help the ones left behind, which means each time someone makes it up that's one less person covering the next one... all until there's one player left needing to get up without anyone covering, maybe they'd need to prepare for that by placing turrets down the ladder before going up in order to cover the last guy going up....  thats just a random idea based off of what you said but i think it'd make for some interesting tactical gameplay out of something so simple.  Armoured Trucks sounds awesome as well, maybe a segment where you have to create an ambush on the road, such as placing explosives and setting up turrets while waiting for the trucks to arrive."

thedivision,3bfcks,GandalfTheyGay,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:30:41 2015 UTC,"If I were a level designer at massive, to make the raid I would make it take place in some sort of waste management facility. We you first go in the gates you're in a yard full of trucks and heavy equipment useful for cover. There are small pockets of enemies roaming around patrolling. You can stealth past or engage there. Once you hit the main building an alarm goes off and the building is alerted to your presence. The area has pillars, high ceilings, cat walks, conveyer belts, etc. Etc. This is where the enemies get a bit tougher. Snipers on the cat walks, cqb enemies charging your position. People in cover showering you with lead. Once your group breaks through into the center you're greeted with a few enemies and two heavily armoured and armed Bosses wearing thick sheet metal over something like an EOD suit shouting profanities and insulting our mothers.

The reason why devs put a game in beta is to TEST it. to listen to the community and help seek out the flaws and put them in to positive things. This something that a lot of ppl forget. They enter a beta, expecting a full working game just pre-release. And then they just board the ""complaign-train"" and go full rage-mode. The most important thing is to issue our concerns/bugs in a decent mature manner to the devs. When i enter a beta, i know that the risk that sometimes i won't be able to play it properly due to bugs is real, and i expect it.

thedivision,3bgia7,ChiefDraggingCanoe,2,Mon Jun 29 00:49:16 2015 UTC,"1) IIRC during E3 one of the devs (or maybe Hamish) said in an interview that things you extract from the dark zone will be available at your base.  2) The real answer is that we don't know. In one of the videos we can see characters switching skills (pulse, seeker, ect.) on the fly, but we have not seen any info about weapon loadouts. My personal guess is that we will be able to immediately switch out new weapons while not in combat, just like in every other MMORPG."
thedivision,3bgia7,Bronzedog,2,Mon Jun 29 03:17:55 2015 UTC,"1) When the loot is extracted it will be decontaminated and available for pickup at the Base of Operations.   2) There have been conflicting information about that. It has been stated in an earlier interview, that you have to go somewhere to re-spec your character but you can change your active skills on the fly. IMO you can select the (unlocked) skills, weapons and gear on the fly (probably not in combat) and if you really want to reset the skill-points you probably will have to go to some specific guy to re-spec.   3) So far it is confirmed, that we will have player-storage in the Base of Operations and usually player-storage is one per character and it is the same storage for each base of operations. So you don't have to go to the same to access your storage."

thedivision,3bgia7,GandalfTheyGay,2,Mon Jun 29 19:30:45 2015 UTC,"I would guess in the base of operations but right now that is unconfirmed (as far as my knowledge goes). I only know that once it is extracted it is yours forever.  I would think you can do it on the fly so long as the stuff is in your inventory (Weapons), skills should definitely be able to be swapped whenever you want.    2b. I would be shocked if weapons stored in base of operations couldn't be accessed from any base of operations you have cleared. My guess is weapons stored in base of operations will be accessible by any base of operations (once it's up and running)."

thedivision,3bf8io,KevinKoolx,4,Sun Jun 28 18:15:27 2015 UTC,"Loot backpack is not only for legendary loot, but for any contaminated loot. When original Ryan killed two if his mates, they dropped blue and purple items (rare and epic).  So it's not ALWAYS super good and useful to kill other players for loot.  You also did not talk about the Dark Zone rank, which you loose when you go rogue.  Also, when a player goes rogue, the people he killed respawn in matter of seconds relatively close, and then the rogue guy has a reverse-wall hack on his forehead, which should make him quite easy to take down in any 2v1 situation.  And last of all, DarkZone is not mandatory, you will be able to get other same quality loot elsewhere, it's just easier to get it in the Dark Zone.  The whole concept is still shrouded in mystery for us, plus it's still all up in the air for devs, because they are going to be tweaking it, especially after beta tests reveal just how greedy players will be and how rewarding/punishing the rogue agent system needs to be."
thedivision,3bf8io,Maert,2,Sun Jun 28 21:04:41 2015 UTC,"It is interesting that they always refer to DayZ as example when it comes to Dark Zones. DayZ is a free for all game that is more of a playground for developers than a real game. The Division on the other hand, is a open-world co-op shooter that has a PvP ENABLED area. It is not the intention of the Developers that the Dark Zone is a killing floor. You really have to think about the consequences and if it is really worth the risk to attack another player. (rogue flag etc)  And there is already a very clear hint, what kind of player you are in the Dark Zone. Because there is a Dark Zone rank and each quest you do, each npc or rogue player you kill, will give you Dark Zone Experience and that will give you a specific Dark Zone Rank. When you die, you lose Dark Zone experience and when you go rogue you lose a lot of DZ-Experience. So If you see a high level player with a low Dark Zone Rank, this is a clear indicator, that this is probably a rogue player. (other indicators or a specific reputation flag / system is not confirmed so far)"
thedivision,3bf8io,JokerUnique,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:32:41 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your comment and checking out the video, I appreciate it. Ultimately I just don't want to see friendly players bring screwed by selfish players. With no cross team voice communication it's very difficult to trust random players. I'd like to see the Dark Zone have PvP be an optional play style rather than a forced playstyle. Being able to work together and accomplish bigger goals you normally can't do on your own is far more rewarding than just killing on sight and playing the Dark Zone like a free range TDM."
thedivision,3bf8io,JokerUnique,2,Mon Jun 29 07:16:11 2015 UTC,"I am with you on that - I'm also not a fan of PvP in a co-op game. But as stated above - PvP is not forced, it is optional and is also punished by the game system. IMO to get some loot fast, it is maybe tempting to go rogue, but when it is really your character then you'll be more hesitant than in the E3 demo. Also on the long run it is also not really rewarding. Because the Dark Zone Rank defines what equipment you can buy with the Dark Zone currency and if you have a low rank you can't buy the special gear and maybe not progress further in the Dark Zone.   Going rogue could stop your progression and IMO this could be enough for many people just to work together instead of going rogue.   Ryan also mentioned that they are thinking about competitive PvP content, so IMO if you really want to test your skills against other players this is a more fitting area than the Dark Zone..."
thedivision,3bf8io,Diknak,2,Mon Jun 29 10:48:56 2015 UTC,"Your concern is my excitement.    I can't wait to take 3 of my friends in the dark zone and jumping lone wolves.  DayZ is a good example, but one of the things that is different is the Rogue system; that doesn't exist in DayZ and it will curb it a little.   Having said that, I completely agree that a more permanent ranking system would be a great addition.  However there shouldn't be a monthly reset, but a rolling ""drip"" that slowly reduces your rogue ranking while you are in the dark zone.  You shouldn't be able to log off and come back 2 weeks later with all of your rogue ranking gone."
thedivision,3bf8io,tifugod,2,Mon Jun 29 16:49:01 2015 UTC,"I actually like the betrayal mechanic, I think it adds to the paranoia and excitement. But I understand that not everybody would want to deal with this.   I think you'd have more of a valid criticism if the Dark Zone wasn't an optional area."
thedivision,3bf8io,tifugod,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:06:47 2015 UTC,Yeah its not necessary but it's an other part of the game. If I buy The Division I want the full experience it has to offer. The Dark Zone shouldn't leave friendly players so vulnerable to Rouge players. What can happen is the Dark Zone just ends up being a free roam TDM game. Rather offering a new experience many players have had. I see a ton of potential with the Dark Zone and I'd hate to see it be degraded to a TDM of everyone killing on sight like DayZ.
thedivision,3bf8io,tifugod,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:47:14 2015 UTC,"I don't think this will be a free-for-all like DayZ. DayZ has no negative consequences for PKing while The Division does have negative consequences that compound on top of each other, as well as positive consequences for non-PKers for killing other PKers. (loot drops, no rogue status)  Remember also that dedicated PKers will have their location broadcast to all other players over a much larger distance than the guy that capped his friend for a piece of loot once, which will make it easier to a) avoid those guys and/or  b) hunt them if you want.  I think the rogue status system is actually a clever way of categorizing players and broadcasting who they are almost immediately. Sure, everyone starts off with the same status, but real soon, your dedicated PKers will be the ones with major rogue status, the ""regular players"" will have little or no rogue status, and provided the server is full enough, the PKers will basically get swarmed by the normal guys.   I don't want to totally negate your point. I think you are right, that sometimes in the Dark Zone other people will sometimes simply come after you. That's going to happen. I just don't think it's going to be a griefing orgy like DayZ.   Regarding your point of the full experience - my counterargument is that the rogue agents, paranoia, and betrayal are precisely part of the full experience. That's exactly the type of thing I'm excited about as a player, but I know it's not for everybody."
thedivision,3bf8io,QXARE,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:16:18 2015 UTC,I do like the fact your location is broadcasted after killing a player. At least there is some kind of consequence for killing players. Though it's just temporary for that play session. I'd like to see some kind of overall PK rank. Warning friendly players that though this person is friendly now they have been very dangerous in the past.
thedivision,3bf8io,Tank0428,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:32:07 2015 UTC,"That would actually be a pretty neat idea. Maybe some type of specialized gear, or flair, or a badge or something like that."

The Dark Zone that will go live, will be a lot larger than in the demo and therefore the spawnpoints will also be farther apart and not just arround the corner."

thedivision,3bexgm,chemx32,7,Mon Jun 29 09:50:54 2015 UTC,"I feel there is a downgrade in the particle effects and some physics.(Maybe its just changed, and not downgraded, but I felt previous ones were better) But as I said earlier in another post, graphics is a subjective matter. Different people look for different things in graphics.  Some might feel there is a bad downgrade in the particle effects while others who do not care much about that, would be unaffected.  You did say XB1 version looked bad so there is a downgrade for console players, from what was shown. (At no point did I think the graphics would represent consoles, but a lot do)  My advise would be do not look for a downgrade, if it looks good enough for you, go with it. It would make your experience better"
thedivision,3bexgm,JokerUnique,2,Sun Jun 28 16:50:43 2015 UTC,"I never said the xbox one version looks bad, but it doesn't look as good as the shown footage... for an xbox game it still looked good. but yea.. for my channels purpose I have to be able to talk about this 'downgrade' and give my opinion.. but as it stands right now..

Just something to note, is people have been continuing ""Ubisoft downgrade all of their games"" circlejerk, and The Division is pretty much included in it.   What I mean is, people are more likely to shit on Ubisoft for the small graphics changes they don't like, but not a company like CDPR. People defended the downgrade right till the release and even beyond, downvoted every comparisons to keep it under wraps for Witcher 3"
thedivision,3bexgm,Ravoss1,1 point,Mon Jun 29 07:18:34 2015 UTC,"Based on reports they changed the whole rendering system after E3 because they could not get it to work for the whole open-world and that is a huge change to the visuals of the game.

thedivision,3bexgm,QXARE,3,Wed Jul 1 04:46:48 2015 UTC,"I think for me, it's not like it was a major downgrade or anything, but I can clearly see a difference between what people actually played at E3 this year and the videos from previous years that made me say ""Snowdrop is the new Jesus"". Or something like that.  Basically just can tell that everything in the engine demo videos is running on a great rig in ideal conditions, and I don't believe we're quite at the level of consumer tech or just gaming generally to see that in the final version.

thedivision,3bexgm,_x_Ronin_x_,3,Sun Jun 28 17:01:16 2015 UTC,"The fact that they showed us the downgrade is amazing! This is what the Division will look like. Maybe Ubisoft learned from Watchdogs?

Its pitiful that downgrade as become the new bitch word, whatever happen to not give any fucks to how graphically pretty a game was and only basing your criticisms on how it played and the story it told/had or didn't have in the case of Destiny.  Bitching about Downgraded graphics in a game is like bitching that Michael Bay didn't put enough explosions in one of his movies, but his movies are still fun to watch, just as games that are downgraded graphically are still fun to play, so my advice to all the  ""downgradophobes"" is grow the fuck up and just enjoy the game. sure it isn't going to be a ""4k make your eyes bleed"" graphics behemoth but so what it still looks fun as fuck to play."

thedivision,3bexgm,Boomslangg_,1 point,Sun Jun 28 19:39:45 2015 UTC,When I watched the uncompressed version it looked really really good actually. There are some differences but overall it looks really good.
thedivision,3bexgm,wrkz,1 point,Mon Jun 29 03:19:04 2015 UTC,I don't know a ton about graphics tech but I will say to a layperson this year's E3 footage looked noticeably worse than what we had previously seen.   A bit of a bummer since graphics do help with immersion but still easily my most anticipated game.
thedivision,3bexgm,luukvds,1 point,Mon Jun 29 07:33:21 2015 UTC,"https://youtu.be/reeBFVWrta8?t=2m56s  look at the texture of the ground in the ""tower"", it looks low res to me with no effects and looks just flat"

thedivision,3bexgm,luukvds,1 point,Mon Jun 29 13:58:30 2015 UTC,"In the gameplay it sais ""Alpha footage"" at the beginning - this is all still work in progress and until I see it live or labeled as final I don't even start comparing the first 2 E3 gameplays with the new material.  Because to compare a tech-demo with alpha-gameplay and then scream ""downgrade"" is not rally a fair assessment."
thedivision,3bexgm,Tank0428,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:27:31 2015 UTC,"In general, it just looked like things were less detailed. I don't know what exactly that translates to in terms of computer-graphics-ese.   However, (to my untrained amateur eye) the downgrade looked rather slight, and didn't really bother me. I'm glad Massive actually showed the game running on a console @ E3, so what you see is what you get.   Let's talk about the dialogue downgrade though. The narrative in the new trailer was horrible !!!!"
thedivision,3bexgm,Whopper311,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:07:40 2015 UTC,I'm with you. I haven't seen anything significant enough to hold any water in an argument about the downgrade. I think the dev's are doing a good job of keeping the quality of this game as high as the technology will allow them.   I trust them to deliver a quality game.
thedivision,3bexgm,luukvds,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:35:34 2015 UTC,Any time I've seen someone say there's a downgrade they immediately point out the group textures.. I'm not sure if they've seen snow and dirt before honestly. Even going through the 2015 #2 walkthrough you can see the characters footprints in the snow and they kick up snow!.. I like to think the people complaining are only doing it because they're still mad about watchdogs.
thedivision,3bexgm,luukvds,1 point,Sun Jun 28 18:24:43 2015 UTC,"I know right! the textures look good, i checked the reflections they are also still there... maybe it is the lack of destruction shown in the trailers, or the relatively flat lighting because it was played in the shadows? I don't know why but people are losing their shit over nothing x)"

thedivision,3bf58u,PlayerThirty,1 point,Sun Jun 28 19:24:29 2015 UTC,I think all demos/trailers prior to the 2015 E3 were console versions on beefy PC dev-kits before they started console hardware optimizations.

Is just retarded..we deserve better games... they are like 60$..And we are in 2015, i don't thing those physics could make the game uglier or something..it was just better for the gameplay..

Instead of multiple Dark Zones they made one big Dark Zone but it has now a level progression in it. So the farther you go into the Dark Zone the better gear you need, so you have to level-up and upgrade your gear to even enter the more difficult sections of the Dark Zone.

Or you can try to follow them all and level up that way and switch between them,” “Most people have a preferred playing style, whether you’re the supporting medic, the long range sniper, or if you want to go in aggressively and deal a lot of damage. To me, that’s the beauty of The Division — it’s an evolution of traditional RPGs.”   So in the end the skills and talents are categorized in roles and this way you skill for a specific role. But you probably can't max out multiple roles, you have to select one of the holy-trinity."

thedivision,3b9ww5,-Dusty-,2,Sat Jun 27 06:04:43 2015 UTC,"A few things I wouldn't mind seeing, though not all that important.  Flair:   SHD Emblem Biohazard/Contaminated Symbol Watch Face Symbol Cleaners Symbol (flamethrower or flames icon) Respirator Icon etc etc   A countdown in the header or on the side, to let us know how many days left we have to save up and/or pay off preorders. (Could even be done to look like the face of the watch in the game, just counting down days instead of hours, if someone knows how to do something like that, that is.)  That's all I have for now and like I said, it's really nothing necessary or important. Just some things I think would be nice to see."

thedivision,3b6t8x,LtRapman,1 point,Fri Jun 26 13:03:09 2015 UTC,Good to hear that overall it was good and smooth. I hope we see solid perks for each class type. I know this is a classless game but there are perks to suit classes so I'd love to see 3 maybe even 4 perks for each class. That may be a lot to ask for for the beginning version of the game but it is what I would love to see.
thedivision,3b6t8x,GandalfTheyGay,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:12:04 2015 UTC,"I think there are definitely going to be enough skills to create the sort of class archetypes you're after.  At E3, there were skills that allowed you to group heal (and this can be thrown to your team mates location to heal on their location), reveal enemy locations through walls (support), as well as obvious damage skills like sticky bombs, remote turrets, etc.  Also, the skills we used were only a sample of what's available, but they definitely showed different 'roles'."
thedivision,3b6t8x,ArekkzGaming,1 point,Sat Jun 27 12:48:33 2015 UTC,Good. The sticky bomb one particularly interested me. I think that was a very good skill to add in.   Glad to hear it was good.   Did you get to use any different weapons besides automatic? Say a sniper rifle or maybe a handgun? If so did you like either of them?
thedivision,3b6t8x,GandalfTheyGay,1 point,Sat Jun 27 14:24:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I had a chance to use 2 of the 3 'loadouts', each of which had a primary, secondary and a sidearm. Here's what I used:  Shotgun - really good up close, but has noticeable damage fall-off when using at range (as it should be).  Machine Gun - really powerful both close up and at medium ranges, but does recoil quite heavily, so at range burst firing is the way to use it.  Assault Rifle - decent stability, decent damage, felt like I needed to use an entire clip (sometimes a bit more) to down an enemy from range, but up close, aiming for the head, it's obviously pretty decent.  Pistol - not too much power here, I saw this more as a last resort - if I used an entire clip of my AR for example, someone was almost dead, and my machine gun had no ammo, I'd swap to the pistol and finish the job."
thedivision,3b6t8x,ArekkzGaming,1 point,Sat Jun 27 19:17:10 2015 UTC,Good. How did you like the shotguns? I'm hoping for a really powerful pistol that will be a force to be reckoned with too.   Glad to hear that overall everything was good. I think the beta will allow them to tweak this game as they need.
thedivision,3b6t8x,GandalfTheyGay,1 point,Sat Jun 27 20:50:38 2015 UTC,"Shotguns were really good, provided you use them close (as designed) - you can down people pretty fast with them.  And yeah, the beta will be a great chance to really test all of these things out, can't wait!"
thedivision,3b6t8x,ArekkzGaming,1 point,Sun Jun 28 16:49:49 2015 UTC,"This video really assuaged some of my concerns about this game, and I'm really thankful for that.  Honestly, I was a little worried and started thinking some negative things about this game that I've been fawning over for well over a year now since E3 this year.  I was concerned about the potential downgrade flak that was flying around here and in other outlets and I didn't feel that other videos from youtubers made me feel any better.  The other thing that arekkz cleared up for me really nicely was the whole DZ loot system (what's shared and what's not) and also the whole thing about character attachment/investment dissuading people from going rogue all the time.  I am, however, still concerned about some of the graphic elements.  For instance, how the markers for loot are these big, colorful splashes rather than those fine, subtle lines that we saw meticulous design documents about a few months ago.  Or the lack of those little subtle HUD elements that showed the system interacting with the world carefully and quickly.  Hopefully, all that is different because of the Xbox One graphics or because this is all alpha footage, but I really want those little details in my PC version.  I do feel like my faith faltered for the past week or two, but arekkz showed me the light again."
thedivision,3b6t8x,FalcoPeregrinus,2,Fri Jun 26 21:06:44 2015 UTC,"Glad the video helped bring you back from the edge Falco! :)  As for the UI elements you're talking about, I think they are still present, but I believe they are a little more campaign-focussed. Things like the the ECHO system are used to help you learn about your environment, but I think for the purposes of the E3 demo, it wasn't really relevant.  The E3 demo was a super-streamlined experience to give us a taste of the Dark Zones, so there's still so much we have yet to see, so I am pretty confident that'll still be in place.  As for the brightly coloured loot indicators - personally I thought they were just obvious enough so as to ensure you don't miss them, while still not so obtrusive so as to ruin the immersive feeling The Division is going for."
thedivision,3b6t8x,ArekkzGaming,1 point,Sat Jun 27 12:52:51 2015 UTC,It's the same gameplay over and over? I assume we will see something new at Gamescom.

thedivision,3b6uzp,MrWazowskii,10,Fri Jun 26 13:19:26 2015 UTC,I don't think there has been really any news about what the season pass will include. I don't suggest buying the season pass before the game comes out anyways. Buy the game and make sure you like it before investing anymore money into it. There will be more news on what is included and you can get it on sale sometime after the game is released.
thedivision,3b6uzp,teklion,1 point,Fri Jun 26 13:27:10 2015 UTC,"Thanks, will do for sure!"
thedivision,3b6uzp,SuperCatThief,1 point,Fri Jun 26 13:50:39 2015 UTC,"This is the best answer. No point investing anymore money than you have to, especially if it only saves you 10$  if you end up buying it now."
thedivision,3b6uzp,PlayerThirty,3,Sat Jun 27 01:39:30 2015 UTC,Well they could Always release small parts of the map which were sealed off before or some extra missions/storyline. I hope DLC's won't be just fancy looking weapons and cosmetics
thedivision,3b6uzp,tifugod,2,Fri Jun 26 16:14:50 2015 UTC,"The only time I'm not opposed to buying the season pass is if you played the beta and unconditionally loved it. Since the beta's not out yet I wouldn't recommend it.   Realistically though, it's only gonna save you $5-10."
thedivision,3b6uzp,GandalfTheyGay,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:52:56 2015 UTC,"I would THINK the season pass will come with map expansions, new missions, new weapons, new abilities, and maybe even new game modes.   I don't know whether to recommend you purchase the season pass but I will simply because I think I will love this game. I am not usually wrong when I think I will love a game (not saying my tastes align with yours) so I'm getting the season pass because I believe with how long it has taken them to release the game they actually care about its success."
