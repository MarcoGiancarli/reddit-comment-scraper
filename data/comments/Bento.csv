Bento,3dobzg,GoReadHPMoR,2,Sat Jul 18 09:52:04 2015 UTC,"I make them the night before, because morning and me don't mix well.

Just put a sandwich or a bean salad or whatever in one part, and put cut vegetables and fruits in the other parts."
Bento,3dobzg,cerbaroo,2,Sat Jul 18 00:47:23 2015 UTC,"For me, it's easiest to make my lunches as soon as I get home from work. So...not even the night before, but the late afternoon or evening before. Most of the time when I crash in the evening, I don't want to get up or do anything, so it makes more sense for me to make my lunches while I'm still up and moving around from having been at work.  In terms of recipes... Pinwheel sandwiches (flatten out a slice of bread, top it, roll it up, and slice it--and I've had a lot of success with tortillas instead of flattened bread) almost always end up looking cute and getting me lots of comments from my coworkers in the lunchroom. Strawberries with a little angle cut out of the top to look like hearts, or else alternating slices of strawberries and bananas on a toothpick/food pick are cute ways to add color. I don't do a lot of fancy bento cooking, though: sometimes I'll buy those pasta sides or rice sides and toss half in my lunch and have the other half for dinner. Personally, I'm more about making everyday food look cute than trying out any ambitious recipes. But having all these different options and approaches is what makes bento so much fun. :)"
Bento,3dobzg,kaeorin,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:37:00 2015 UTC,"Okay awesome. I didn't even think about pinwheels. That's going on the todo list haha. I think my biggest issue is going to be actually making the lunches. I work a weird hour set from 10a-9pm 5 days a week with an off day on Wednesday and Sunday. I usually get up around 8:30/9a-9:30a so it leaves little time to make it in the morning. And as far as the evening goes I'm home around 9:30p or later if I have to get groceries. Try to have dinner by 10-10:30p(unless shopping) try and have some down/relaxation time(video games, watching YouTube/twitch and time with the S/O) and bed around 1-2a.   Off days I suppose I could meal prep some of these things but I'm usually out and about getting things I need that I usually don't have time to shop for. So time is precious lmao.   I'm doing this to stay away from fast foods and such while at work. Here's to trial and error. And some good pinwheels."
Bento,3dhzmw,boba-boba,2,Thu Jul 16 12:48:37 2015 UTC,"I love making omurice because of it's convenience. I can make it the morning of if I have nothing made and it requires very little ingredients. I made this about 10 minutes ago and I think it took me about 20 minutes total to make the omurice and put it all together. The pudding and sunomono were pre-made a few days ago.  Pink box:   Omurice - I use a variation of Just Hungry's recipe. I put tomato sauce on top. Sunomono - I have found several recipes but this one might be my favorite so far.   White Box:   Milk Pudding topped with condensed milk - I love adding puddings to my bento, and these are much more like panna cotta than the western pudding we think of. I make some on Sunday and it lasts me about a week. The only downside is this recipe often breaks up in the process of bringing my lunch to work. It's still delicious and cookpad has many recipes that work just as well. I like to mix it with fruit. I highly recommend this Coconut Milk Pudding recipe from Thirsty for Tea, though it is more ingredient intensive. Mini baby peanut butter oreos! Nectarine"

Bento,3dhzmw,thekillerkrab,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:14:17 2015 UTC,Thats ok! It's not really pudding like what western pudding is. It's a mix between jello and pudding.

Can't get a big rice cooker, no space. But this thing is super quick and very easy to use! Easy to clean too. Definitely would recommend."
Bento,3beeb7,ITypedThisWithMyFeet,2,Sun Jun 28 16:23:55 2015 UTC,If you have cabinet or shelf space you could get a small rice cooker. I have one that cooks max of 4 cups and when I'm not using it I store it on a shelf with a few other pots and pans. The cord is removable so I store that in the pot and it doesn't take up much space. This way I'm not always talking up counter space.

I followed this week's theme (summer) by building the box somewhat like a beach (naturally blue food is rare unfortunately). I did not have anything to make the octopuses' eyes, so I left them without it. For the sand, I used couscous instead of rice as the former has a golden color. I also added some green peas for vegetation and make the scene a bit more colorful. Also summer also means sun, so I used a grapefruit to represent a sunset. Comments are welcome :)  Recipe (for 6 boxes):   Couscous (2 cups) green peas (1 can) blueberries (1 small container) hot dog sausages (6) grapefruit (1)"

Bento,3ac5gz,insanearcane,2,Thu Jun 18 22:18:24 2015 UTC,"I have a monbento and I love it! I find the size to be perfect for a good lunch, and I love that it's microwavable. I have a white and light blue one, and I get tons of complements on it too, which is nice. I have had mine for about a year, and although it's had some time off in the middle due to a period of unemployment, it has held up really well. I use the top container for fruits and veggies, and the bottom container for whatever my main meal is that I'm going to microwave. I like that the little divider comes out because that makes it easy to wash, and if I have more of something one day I can move it, or want all of one thing (like a salad) on top, I don't have to work around the divider.   I also try to follow a more low-carb diet (although I am more successful some days than others). I find that having protien that is fairly easy to make in a smaller lunch sized portion, like making chicken, meatballs etc and freezing it helps. I also buy lots of sausage, like chicken sausage, because it's a good portion, cooks quickly, and keeps well in the freezer. I also try to have a good variety of fruits and veggies that pack well on hand. That usually means strawberries, blueberries, apple, peppers, carrots, pea pods, cucumber, and zucchini. Sometimes I use frozen berries when I haven't had time to go to the store recently, but really the most timesaving I do is on the protein part of the meal."
Bento,3ac5gz,smellytoots,2,Fri Jun 19 01:37:51 2015 UTC,"Nice- thanks! I actually found a Takenaka discounted at a store nearby, so I am going to try that and see how I like it before investing in a Monbento, but I have the feeling it will go well.  This week, I am going to try a bento box with brisket, rice, some frozen fruit, cheese, and avocado. I'll post photos, too. Sausage is a great idea."

Bento,3ac5gz,KyokoGetDown,2,Sat Jun 27 01:25:44 2015 UTC,"I almost got a monbento box, but the price tag did kinda scare me. I ended up getting a Bentgo Box off of amazon instead, and I'm pretty happy with it. Although it doesn't come with chopsticks, just a plastic knife, spoon, and fork. No (re)moveable dividers, but the top container is divided in two sections.  I just came off a low-carb, moderate protein and fat diet. Try cauliflower rice! (riced cauliflower?) Salads are also a nice option and it gives you more of a reason to eat some spinach. Leftover frittatas might be a nice change too. I Breathe I'm Hungry is one of my favorite low-carb recipe sites! I think most of their meatball recipes would probably fit in a bento nicely."

Bento,3a59if,delicious_disaster,25,Wed Jun 17 09:41:23 2015 UTC,"From Alton Brown:   But it won't be hard, the way, say, refrigerated Chinese take-out restaurant rice would be. Why is that? Well, long-grain rice, which is usually what's inside one of these, contains a very, very high percentage of amylose. [holds up the model] Remember this guy? When this cools, the amylose and water come together to make a structure that's kind of like, well, kind of like a crystal, which is why it's hard as a rock. The process is called ""retrogradation"", and it's reversed when the rice is reheated. Now since medium-grain rices have more amylopectin in them, this never happens in the first place, which is why I use medium, and sometimes short-grain rices for all refrigerated-bound applications.   It's because of the rice you chose. Medium and short grain rice won't get hard because they don't have the stuff in them that makes them hard when chilled."
Bento,3a59if,hugemuffin,6,Wed Jun 17 12:27:15 2015 UTC,nice! thanks. guess I'll be buying a lot more short and medium grain rices to experiment
Bento,3a59if,Blueninjakat,3,Wed Jun 17 13:43:42 2015 UTC,"I have no idea, I'm guessing;  I would guess it has some bit to do with rice. Long grain cooks different than short grain, and instant rice will never behave as well as you want it to.   I would bet that really rinsing your rice well before cooking helps. Rice rubs up against itself in processing, bagging, transport, and in your cabinet, covering itself in starchy rice flour dust. That starch would cook with the rest of the rice, but stay on the outside of the grains, and stick to everything.  After that, I'd say play with water-to-rice ratio. See how little water you can use without getting too-dry rice, so that it isn't over soaked and mushy to begin with.  Hope something works! Let us know if you figure it out."
Bento,3a59if,katzenlibrary,4,Wed Jun 17 10:37:01 2015 UTC,"Miracle technique: This method works amazingly if you do it in time after cooking the rice and works best for medium and short grain rice. I always do this with my leftover rice and it keeps perfectly.   After cooking your rice, portion it out and put it in cling wrap. I don't mean put it in a bowl and cover it, I mean put it straight in the cling wrap. Do this as soon as possible after you cook it. Preferably, it'll still be piping hot when you wrap it. Then, place it in a ziplock bag (you can put multiple cling wrap pouches in a single ziploc, in you like!) and put it in THE FREEZER. Yes, it sounds odd but trust me. From there, you just leave it in the freezer until you want to eat it. To heat it back up, place it in the microwave (still in the cling wrap) until the rice is hot. The taste and texture will be like the rice is fresh-cooked!  I go out of my way to make a bunch of rice on weekends and wrap it for bentos during the week. In the morning, I just grab one, heat it up, transfer the rice to my bento, and I'm ready to go (after rice has cooled, of course).   Here's a Just Bento post about freezing rice. This is where I got the idea from and I've never been happier! Good luck. :)"
Bento,3a59if,CirillaX,2,Wed Jun 17 19:07:21 2015 UTC,"Brilliant idea, I was looking for info like this :) Will definitely try it next time I prepare my rice."
Bento,3a59if,SPACE_CHUPACABRA,2,Thu Jun 18 09:00:41 2015 UTC,"As mentioned below, a lot of it will have to do with the rice you use. For what's its worth, when you reheat the rice soak a paper towel in water and place it over the container you're heating the rice/stir fry etc in. It'll help introduce some moisture and prevent any from getting out"

Bento,3a3mfi,AstorReinhardt,7,Tue Jun 16 23:35:57 2015 UTC,"Pita stuffed with lots of veggies and tuna or hummus is a great filling sandwich.    I like to take some small cutters and cut a few stars in the side to decorate some.  You can also cut the veggies into fun shapes. Baby bell cheeses are always a nice snack and are very easy to make cute by punching a shape through the wax.  Fruits are a great way to get color and can be cut into shapes, its pretty easy to do a checkerboard pattern on apples and I've seen some really cute green apple tree frogs.  Baked macaroni and cheese is really easy to make and holds shape really well, just cut with cookie cutters.   Same with sandwiches, cut with cookie cutters and instant kawaii.  Veggies, so many options!!!  Broccoli and asparagus make great trees, colorful sweet peppers are a great way to brighten up any lunch and so so yummy!  Cucumbers bring great color, peel stripes down the side and slice, easy peasy. Look in Walmart or target for Rubbermaid lunchblox.  They have a larger lunch size, a sandwich size, one that's half the sandwich size and a snack size.  Get one or two of each and mix and match for your desired size lunch.  Good luck!  Have fun!!!"

Bento,3a3mfi,ongling,3,Wed Jun 17 20:27:14 2015 UTC,"What I told op was that cooking ability is not 100% necessary, learning to create an aesthetic, how to use color, creating themes, and balancing the food groups can all be done with little to no cooking skills. You, on the other hand, dismissed the idea of anyone making any sort of attempt unless they have existing cooking skills.  Anyone can create beauty in the kitchen no matter what sort of skills they possess.  I started by making character cakes.  I used a box mix and store bought icing and made wonderful cakes for the kids in my family, then i progressed to making cakes and icing from scratch, then I started experimenting with pies, and working on my knife skills etc etc.    Everyone has to start somewhere."

Bento,3a3mfi,smellytoots,0,Sat Jun 20 00:31:31 2015 UTC,"some handy items/tips to keep in mind for bento use:   /u/dapuipui is a dick, do what you gotta do to bento it up! prepackaged foods are neat for limited cooking skills/time constraints/just because. (especially once you get in the habit of making a bento) things like microwavable rice pouches, individual yogurt cups, cans of fish, basically anything that's pre-portioned can help reduce stress while adding considerable foodstuffs to your bento. frozen items are totally legitimate too, but with all that preservatives and processing its not as satisfying as homemade/leftover items. part of bento is making items in advance. so not only are pre-portioned items handy, but things like fruits, veggies, hard boiled eggs, and even canned items can be prepared in advance (i like to do most of the grunt work immediately after a grocery trip) so as to save time if/when there are cooked items to cook or more boxes to make.  its not necessary to think of a bento as a full or complete meal, meaning a main course with accompanying sides. i'm always down for planning my boxes but sometimes shit just gets thrown in because its available. with practice, bentos become easier but sometimes you'll end up with a box of random and think ""wow, that actually came out alright"".   practice creating a box for yourself to judge food portions. you can still practice bento ideology without an actual bento box, so in the mean time use any kind of tupperware or varieties of tupperware you have on hand. be sure to measure out portions so when you do go full bento, its a relatively easy transition because you're already familiar with portioning.  not all foods are equal. just because your box is full doesn't mean you'll be full afterwards. practice makes perfect to find your optimal bento.    i'm still new to this game, but hopefully this helps. i use this 1150mL bento as well as this 1410mL bento regularly. and for scale, the latter bento can hold a sandwich in the lower black container (beneath the red separator) comfortably with the remaining space open for more items.   feel free to PM me and safe travels out on your adventures! edit: can't format"
Bento,3a3mfi,ihave11,1 point,Wed Jun 17 23:01:27 2015 UTC,I actually just went shopping with bento ideas in my head and picked up some small fruit cups and snacks to put into a cute plastic box with little witches on it. I forgot we had it and it seems to hold a lot...idk how sturdy it is though :( I'll have to test it out next time I go for a walk.  I'm fairly sure I know my portions well...at least when it comes to sandwich and something with it...rice and side dishes...not to sure...I always seem hungry after I eat rice.  That sushi bento box is kawaii! If my witch box doesn't work out I might just get that sushi one and plus side it comes with it's own cutlery!

The onions in this bento are from an incredible recipe I found on The Slow-Roasted Italian. It takes purple and sweet yellow onions, marinades them in a mixture of olive oil, Dijon, rosemary, lemon, garlic, salt, and pepper, and roasts them in the oven to perfection. I thought this recipe would be pretty decent, but it turned out amazing!   Plus, the bright purple of the onions makes for a colorful bento addition, especially if you need a little pop. :)  EDIT: Including the link to the recipe might be helpful... http://www.theslowroasteditalian.com/2011/08/rosemary-roasted-onions.html"

Bento,39xp5g,Karatts,7,Mon Jun 15 17:25:14 2015 UTC,"I've been packing my own lunches for a couple weeks now and decided that a bento was a good way to watch how much I eat, what I eat, and how much I spend! I'm super excited to use these cute items I got in the mail today! I ordered the Monbento and animal shaped silicone cups off of Amazon and the rest from allthingsforsale.com  I live in NYC so I went on a journey looking for bento items in stores before I shopped online. I thought that I could save some money by shopping in stores versus online+shipping. I visited Kinokuniya, which is recommended by a few sites and people. However, when I got there, there weren't any bento supplies. They did have a few hello kitty themed thermos and fork sets but no bento boxes or accessories. I was only able to find a few bento supplies (bentos, picks, rice shapers) at Sunrise Mart and my local Japanese supermarket. My local Japanese supermarket had a lot more to offer than the other shops I visited , but I ended up ordering online because of the greater variety of cute items."
Bento,39tg9c,znuxor,2,Sun Jun 14 16:43:34 2015 UTC,"It would probably be way easier to break the egg if you peeled the shell off first. That way, you also don't have to worry about little bits of shell getting mixed up in the rice. The reason you sometimes see brown eggs is because they were cooked in soy sauce or some other kind of sauce; if they're cut, the shell is gone.   Also, try not to prepare the boxes ahead of time because you'll find that the tomato and orange will get their juice into the rice and be pretty gross after a few days. Since you don't have a bento box with compartments I would suggest leaving the orange out and bringing it separately (either an entire unpeeled orange or just a few slices in a different box)."
Bento,39tg9c,maudlinmegalomaniac,1 point,Sun Jun 14 23:24:00 2015 UTC,"Hello! This is my first try at bento ""boxes"". Criticism is welcome :) . I made 6 of these with varying amounts of rice. For example here is another container. I did have some trouble splitting the hard-boiled egg in two. I did not break the eggs in the other boxes so they can be kept for a couple days longer. Here is the complete set of containers. I did not have any sauce with me so I was not able to add details.  For those interested in the recipe, here is what I used and did:   Kam (similar to Spam as I could not any) Soy sauce (1/2 cup) Water (1/2 cup) Sugar (I used brown sugar) (1/2 cup) Eggs (6 large) Small tomatoes (18) Spinach (about 3 oz) Orange (1) Parboiled rice (about 2 cups uncooked)   I started by cutting the spam in 6 (7 in this case) and marinating the pieces in the soy sauce, water and sugar for a couple hours. I cooked the rice (takes about 10-12 minutes for the kind I used), grilled the meat in a pan until cooked as preferred and hard-boiled the eggs for 10 minutes. Meanwhile I cut each tomato in half and the orange in 6 slices (each cut into 2 pieces). The spinach leaves tend to wilt when exposed to heat so I cooled the meat, the rice and the eggs before building the boxes."

Bento,3936v6,Crimson_Raven_Fox,5,Mon Jun 8 22:45:47 2015 UTC,"There are really no ""rules"" to bento. You can have one or many boxes, fill it with overly cute foods or just regular foods. One of the best guides for beginners is the Just Bento Cookbook by Makiko Itoh. She lays out how much time it should take you, gives recipes, and even shows you how to place things in the box. It really holds your hand! From there, it's easy to branch out and come up with your own dishes and box designs. You can see a preview of the book on Amazon. Here website (justbento.com) is equally helpful! She has tons of recipes and ideas.  Also, frequenting bento blogs and places like this sub are really helpful to learn new recipes and get new ideas for making lunches more aesthetically pleasing.  You really only need a box to do bento, but here are some things that will make the aesthetics part easier (and more fun!):   food cups such as these (the silicone kind is most common but you can use cupcake papers too, just be careful not to microwave it if you use the metal cupcake cups) cutters. many people on this sub have these but you can use any! picks. I just use the colorful ones you get at the grocery store, but some people like to use ones in the shapes of animals, etc. you can find them online really easily! Just stick them in fruit or other firm things in your bento to give an easy kick of color! egg molds/sandwich molds. I personally don't use these but many people here do. It's so fun to see a little fish-shaped egg or kitty sandwich in a bento.   I know I forgot some things, but those are the most common ones. Don't sweat trying to make everything super detailed and involved for your first bentos. The people here and on other sites who seem to throw out amazing bentos left and right have been doing it for a long time and have learned a lot to get to where they are. Just remember: if it's food arranged in a box, it's bento. Everything else comes next. :)  EDIT: One last little thought, when I first started I had a two-tier box and I thought it was a lot harder to learn on that than if had only been working with one tier. Some people think the two-tier style is easier to work with but I personally prefer just one."

Bento,386cbd,ongling,1 point,Tue Jun 2 04:07:40 2015 UTC,So gorgeous! I love when you post - I always learn some new way to make my bentos appetizing and eye-catching!   Question about the pan-seared whole mushroom: I cook mushrooms a lot but I always cook them sliced. How do you know when a whole mushroom has been cooked through?
Bento,386cbd,katzenlibrary,2,Tue Jun 2 15:04:46 2015 UTC,"I am so glad you like my posts. I am also learning at the same time from other bento makers too u. If you choose shiitake mushroom, it is much easier to cook through as a whole, takes about 6-8 mins. You will know when the mushroom releases liquid, shrink a little and soften through. I do not use oil when cooking mushrooms so as to maximise the earthy flavour. Hope this helps."
Bento,386cbd,katzenlibrary,1 point,Tue Jun 2 15:19:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I saw that in one of your blog posts (about not using oil). I'm excited to try that. I love the earthiness of mushrooms, so that sounds perfect!"

Bento,384a2v,ihave11,7,Mon Jun 1 22:39:56 2015 UTC,Thank you.  My son's preschool has a different theme each week so I have been preplanning his lunches to be coordinated with each theme.  There are many more to come :)
Bento,384a2v,EeveeAssassin,2,Mon Jun 1 22:43:33 2015 UTC,I've seen this apple design a lot! Can you please tell me how it's done? :3
Bento,384a2v,EeveeAssassin,3,Tue Jun 2 13:25:21 2015 UTC,"Sure, you cut a chunk of apple, then use a small knife to slice a grid pattern just barely through the skin.  Then, take the knife and carefully slide it under every other square to remove the skin.  My son is too little to eat a big chunk of apple so I kinda cheated. After cutting the grid pattern I sliced the apple along each of the horizontal lines which made it much easier to remove the squares of skin. Let me know if that helps. If it doesn't I can post a picture of the tutorial from the Everyday Bento book, it has step by step pictures."
Bento,384a2v,KillAllHumansExcept1,2,Tue Jun 2 14:08:03 2015 UTC,"No, that makes sense! Haha, in my head I was somehow imagining all the squares would fall off if you did that! But I suppose not :3"

Bento,37r48d,Missperkygoth77,1 point,Fri May 29 18:49:01 2015 UTC,I've always wondered - how do you make the multi color rice?
Bento,37r48d,Imalane,1 point,Sat May 30 03:12:01 2015 UTC,"There's several different ways-- food coloring, coloring with other foods (like egg yolk or sauces), or using colored furikake (which also adds flavor to the rice). I've been experimenting with all three. :)"
Bento,37r48d,Imalane,1 point,Sat May 30 16:13:04 2015 UTC,"Never thought of that! May not use food coloring since I wouldn't have any other use for it, but I may experiment with colored foods now to color my onigiri! Thanks! :)"
Bento,37ok2z,yukikiki,2,Fri May 29 04:09:24 2015 UTC,"Is it very hard to make the tamagoyaki?  It's been on my list of things to attempt, but I haven't been brave enough yet, it just seems so delicate."
Bento,37ok2z,Caitir,2,Fri May 29 15:55:19 2015 UTC,Much easier with the tamagoyaki pan. It's pretty difficult with a normal round pan for me.
Bento,37ok2z,chiirioz,2,Fri May 29 16:47:22 2015 UTC,"I think it's important to use a decent non-stick pan. And I use both hands to do the rolling, one with spatula another with chopsticks. You should try, it's not that difficult, worse come to worst, make it into scramble egg. XD"

Bento,37ihku,dimsum-wench,1 point,Thu May 28 00:37:30 2015 UTC,"The blue is coloring (I drizzle soy sauce on it), and the other two are furikake with salmon flavor. I'm planning on branching out and trying some natural flavoring."

But basically any meal in a box is bento, so you could put food in tupperware and call it bento if you want. It's up to you if you want to start slow or dive right in with boxes and character bentos and stuff. :)  Probably the first thing you'll want to know about is how to pick a box. Like I said, tupperware works but if you want something made for bento stuff you can find boxes on amazon and many of us order from Bento & co. Sort of expensive but worth it and a great selection."

Bento,36hty3,Caligineus,12,Tue May 19 14:58:52 2015 UTC,"Yes, that's exactly what it is. If you google onigirazu you'll find tons of examples. You just spread some rice in the middle of a nori sheet, top it with whatever you want, put some more rice on top, and fold the corners of nori around the filling. Then wrap tightly in plastic wrap for at least a few minutes before you cut it in half. Mine has an egg crepe, cheese, and scallions."

Bento,35oayj,Africaa,2,Tue May 12 04:18:43 2015 UTC,F I N A L L Y. Praise the Old Gods and the New that they started selling those pieces individually.
Bento,35oayj,Africaa,3,Tue May 12 14:55:06 2015 UTC,"RIGHT?!!? I'm glad you feel as passionately about this as I do. But I'm still bummed that you can't buy the wide silicon food cups individually, without buying the whole three-piece mold set, and that they don't sell the dividers anymore. Those dividers are freaking useful!  Also, while we're wishlisting here, I wish they had a long, flat container with a leakproof top that would fit inside the bento, for when I want half a box worth of soup or applesauce or other wet stuff that I don't want to leak all over everything else in the box.  And I wish their Android app included a drag-and-drop bento planner, where you could save photos of food as a texture map and then use it to fill little cup-shaped areas within a virtual box, one for every day of the week. That would rule."
Bento,35oayj,Africaa,2,Tue May 12 18:08:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, not being able to buy the wide silicone molds suck, but they do have those disposable ones you got which is better than nothing.  YES. All winter I was longing to bring soups with me, but I didn't want to have to carry my bento AND another container. I'm probably going to get one of those larger sauce cups they put out. I'm curious to know if that will hold a sufficient amount of applesauce/yogurt/whatever."

Bento,35hb78,McLovin0132,1 point,Sun May 10 13:12:57 2015 UTC,"Hi, thanks for your compliment. This is the recipe i copied from my website, its quite easy, hope you like it. This recipe yields about 10 -12 mini manjus (Palm-sized). Bun Ingredients: 1& 1/3 cup cake flour 1/3 cup water with soft pink colouring 1 tsp baking powder 2 tbs brown fine sugar 2 tbs rice malt syrup 1 tbs melted better  Sweet Potato filling ingredients: 3 small or 2 medium Satsuma Imo or Japanese sweet potatoes (the sizes differ depending where the sweet potatoes are from) 2 tbs Rice Malt syrup 1 tbs butter  Sieve cake flour and baking powder together. I sieve 2 times for a thorough mix. Add sugar, rice malt syrup, butter and pink coloured water, mix well. (tip: Pour the coloured water in 3  portions, mix each time after pouring to control the depth of the colour). Let the dough rest lightly covered with a cheese cloth or cellophane wrap for 20 minutes.  Meanwhile, steam the peeled sweet potatoes until soft. Use a flour siever to mash the potato for a finer texture and separate the veins, if any. Add the melted butter and rice malt syrup and mix well. Leave it in the fridge covered.  Knead the dough until earlobe texture on a floured surface. Divide into about 10-12 equal portions. Use a roller pin to roll out each portion into circular shape for an even thickness before inserting the sweet potato filling. Make sure the rolled out circular shape is big enough to wrap the filling. Use the smoother side as the exterior part of the bun.Wrap the sweet potato filling, (I used a heaped tsp of filling per manju and form the manju into the desired shape.  I mixed black colouring into the leftover dough for the eyes.)  Steam the manju over medium fire for about 12 minutes. Do not use rice cooker for steaming as the condensed water formed on the  lid will wet the surface of the manju. Use a traditional bamboo steamer or a wire cooling rack in a deep pan filled with some water for steaming.  The buns will expand slightly so make sure leave gap between each bun during steaming."

The gravy was supposed to be a knockoff of Popeye's, but it wasn't even close. Might be because I left out the chicken gizzards? I didn't think I'd actually enjoy gizzard flavor, plus I didn't want to buy a pound and use only two.

Or will he be able to put it in a fridge or cooler or something after he gets to work? Trying to determine if you need a built in ice pack or something similar. Also, does he eat a lot? Boxes vary a lot in volume so if he's a big eater he'll need a fairly large box.  As far as versatile and sturdy I'd recommend a Monbento. Rectangular Square   There are parts under the lids for utensils and Monbento makes their own sauce cups, chopsticks, cultery, etc. that can fit into the boxes.

Marinaded the chicken for about an hour and then cut it up and threaded it onto little skewers.  Boiled the marinade and thickened with the corn starch slurry.  Baked at 375 for 20mins, then brushed on the thickened sauce and cooked for another 3mins, turned over, brushed with more sauce, and another 3 mins.  Then a sprinkle of toasted sesame seeds and I was done.  Smoked Salmon and Cream Cheese Onigiri  Babybel Cheese  Prosciutto ""flower""  Fan cut Kamaboko  Tamagoyaki, this recipe made the eggs come out too brown for my liking, too much soy sauce.

And label everything down to the socks on his feet (shoes, shirts, pants) it's the only way you might get stuff back. Also, ask if the teachers wash his lunch box or not (I dunno how it is in America) and start teaching him how to open and close his box by himself and the importance of putting his little containers back in.   In Australia we had several kids bring 'bento like' boxes, and they were all coached by their parents to put everything back into their boxes, seal the box up & put it back into their bags or fridge as necessary.   I'm rambling now, sorry!"

After I signed him up for preschool I wound up laying awake at night trying to figure out what I would make for him for lunch (I'm a little crazy that way). Anyway, I don't plan on using any picks because he's still at the age where he would try to eat them, but when he's older I will.  I figure I'll pick up little cute picks where I can for cheap so it isn't a big deal if they go missing.  For boxes I have started buying a few different types but plan on using the Rubbermaid lunchblox or these to start out with. Neither cost much or have too many parts.  I also have a laptop lunch box but that was a little costly so I'll hold onto that until I know I'll get all my parts back.  Instead of silicone cups I'll use paper cupcake cups.  Pretty much make it so I'm not too stressed about it if anything doesn't make it home."

They actually have styrofoam padding on all the doorways so that when people bump their heads it doesn't hurt.  It's no so much a 'Westerners are tall' thing as it's a very old palace and the Japanese used to be much shorter.  It also has nightingale floors that are fun to walk across.

Bento,32kwvb,strandedhero04,2,Tue Apr 14 16:47:59 2015 UTC,It was actually beautiful this past weekend (a little chillier than I would've preferred though). But I was lucky enough to be able to go out during the peak bloom.   I included the sauce in the bottle next to the veggie/pork patties. Its a ponzu (because I wanted to tie in the lemon dressing on the salad).   The nori for the onigiri I always put on the side. I don't like how it gets all chewy when I leave it on the onigiri all day x_x;

I can't stand cherry and grape tomatoes. I'm a grown-ass man and I agree with your daughter — I hate the way they pop. :)"

Bento,31239q,Dubstercat,1 point,Wed Apr 1 15:43:49 2015 UTC,"There's nothing special about the photography skills. It's all about the setup. Having a professional setup is 90% of it.  The apple is pretty simple. Take a wedge of apple that doesn't quite cut to the core. Set it on one of the cut sides and cut parallel to the upright side ALMOST but not quite all the way down. Flip it on the other cut side and repeat to remove a smaller wedge from that wedge. Then take that out and repeat getting smaller and smaller wedges. Reassemble them slightly off to the side and that's it.  The hardest part is getting a good parallel cut and not cutting too far. This one was also hard because this apple was a week old and too soft. It's easiest with crunchy apples. With this one, the the apple was mushing before the knife even broke the skin of the apple and I was using my sushi knife!"

Bento,310qgt,starrpuu,1 point,Wed Apr 1 11:44:47 2015 UTC,Front page browser here... What the fuck is bento? A diet of some sort? I'm interested and would rather hear your explanation than look it up on wiki.
Bento,310qgt,Bvjiglag,1 point,Wed Apr 1 23:28:59 2015 UTC,"I am not a venteran of the ways of the bento and google can probably explain it better, but a bento is simply a cutely arranged meal (usually lunch). If you do a Google image search for ""bento,"" you'll see the artistic element put into each bento box.  Speaking of boxes there are bento boxes you can buy to put you lunch in as well, however, you can make a bento out of any lunch/meal.  Bentos originated in Japan where mothers/girlfriends/wives would make bentos for their children/bf/husbands to bring to work/school, and are usually made from scratch every morning.  I'm lazy and make mine way ahead of time.  As for the diet part, that's purely based on what your meal consists of. As a person with a no-so-healthy lifestyle, I find that if a healthy meal is cutely and prettily arrange I'll eagerly eat it.  Sorry if that wasn't helpful. Google does a better job explaining than me.  TL;DR: bento are any lunch rearranged to look cute."

Bottom tier: sticky rice and vegetable curry with carrot flowers.  I was surprised at how easy the carrot flowers were to make, and how quickly the process went. I made them while the broccoli was steaming. Altogether, this bento took longer to put together than I'd have liked, even with the curry and rice being leftovers, but I'm so happy with the result that I don't care.   Bonus: the carrot flowers on top of the curry keep that section's lid from getting too much sauce on it when closed. I like that."

Bento,307cen,Missperkygoth77,3,Wed Mar 25 02:24:13 2015 UTC,"Try to have no spaces in-between; after arranging the food items in your bento, if there is space between the bento and the cover lid , place a piece of cellophane wrap over the top and fold a piece of paper napkin or any hand towel on top of the wrap to fill up the left-over space before closing the lid. Usually work for me."

I'll definitely be putting this tip to use for my littles. They're slow and pokey eaters so  I can't really give them too much food, especially the one who's in school and has a limited time to eat."

Bento,2zp5cc,keeper420,1 point,Sat Mar 21 08:38:01 2015 UTC,Thanks!  It's all about the kind of rice you use.  Long-grain white rice doesn't keep well at all.  Medium-grain sushi rice works much better; it will stay good for a couple of days in the fridge and reheats nicely.  Plus it's super-sticky and can be easily eaten with chopsticks.

Bento,2yg8hl,arvzi,2,Mon Mar 9 21:25:46 2015 UTC,Cute! Did you smoosh the bread a little or did it compress naturally with the rolling process? How did you keep the bread from cracking/breaking?   I've done similar rolls/sandwiches/wraps with lavash and similar flat bread but not with sandwich slices. Neat idea and awesome execution.
Bento,2yg8hl,sinsofangels,3,Mon Mar 9 20:07:12 2015 UTC,"Thanks :) I took a piece of bread and flattened it with a rolling pin and then cut off the crusts. The smaller rolls didn't crack but the ham and cheese ones did. I think it was because the filling was thicker, but I also used potato bread on that one and white on the others. I got the idea for rolling the bread from making rolled grilled cheese http://youtu.be/v1gBabnzSVw"

The dressing is also a dip for the carrots and celery, which is why there's so much.

Anyway, I realized you don't really need the towel. Just put a layer of saran wrap down (which you need to do with the towel anyway). But  I don't feel like the towel added anything, more got in the way. I managed to make some pretty decent rolls using just the saran wrap, and if you're not going to eat all the rolls right away, you can just wrap the roll in the saran after."

I never heard of a Scotch egg until looking up recipes for this bento and, dang, I just had to make it.  It's a hardboiled egg wrapped in sausage, covered in bread crumbs and deep fried. In an effort to be healthy (and also because my mother instilled a deep fear of hot oil backsplatter so I'm too scared to deep fry anything myself) I baked the eggs instead. They're extra crispy if you bake it a first time then cut them in half and put the egg side down and either broil or just toast in a small toaster oven."

Added an apple (cut into chunks) and dialed down the brown sugar to account for the extra sweetness.     Scones: http://smittenkitchen.com/blog/2010/10/apple-and-cheddar-scones/ I used romano instead of cheddar because that's what I had on hand.

Bento,2xspo6,Rainer3012,7,Tue Mar 3 17:02:11 2015 UTC,"The only thing you really should worry about is while packing the food, let it cool completely before closing up whatever container you use. That is to say, the food should not be giving off any steam, that way there's no condensation build up inside the container, which can ease spoilage.  Aside from that, as another comment says, 90% of foods are pretty much good to go."

After that harmful bacteria start to grow which may not smell funny or taste funny or even get you sick immediately. Food poisoning could take up to 3 days to kick in so you never know.

In most cases for bento, we'd be using the first ""T"" in FATTOM for Time. As long as the food involved is cooked (excluding ready-to-eat foods like fruits and veggies), the food is almost guaranteed to be safe (except for some foods like shellfish) within the first four hours of cooking and storing.

Bento,2xt1aq,evange,1 point,Tue Mar 3 17:32:43 2015 UTC,"Hm, wouldn't the curry make the rice all soggy by the time you were having lunch?"
Bento,2xt1aq,masqueradestar,2,Tue Mar 3 19:59:05 2015 UTC,"Nope. It's short grain rice, which is a bit sticky so it forms a sort of barrier And the curry is Japanese style, which means it's thickened with starch (traditionally a roux, but I used a slurry method instead to avoid adding unnecessary fat), so it kind of gels and stays put."
Bento,2xt1aq,masqueradestar,0,Tue Mar 3 20:02:49 2015 UTC,"Interesting! The curry looked more liquid-y than Japanese curry in the pic, which is why I asked. :)"
Bento,2xt1aq,CHICKENFORGIRLFRIEND,1 point,Wed Mar 4 01:25:46 2015 UTC,"If you're worried about this for a curry bento, I usually put the curry on the bottom and top it with rice. It doesn't look as pretty I guess but it tastes so good!"

Bento,2xqmb3,Patticus1337,2,Tue Mar 3 09:29:15 2015 UTC,What's in the onigiri?
Bento,2xpzdl,kaeorin,1 point,Mon Mar 2 22:53:31 2015 UTC,"I'd say this is a pretty simple lunch: leftover pasta with some meatballs (frozen: nothing special) and garlic toast in the top layer. I put a cookie cutter on the pasta and sprinkled some mozarella cheese just to fill some blank space. We'll see if it ends up being too much cheese.  In the bottom layer, just some sliced melons that I got from the grocery store, some mandarin orange segments, and a sliced-up granola bar."
Bento,2xpzdl,stenoknight,2,Mon Mar 2 22:57:20 2015 UTC,There's no such thing as too much cheese! :'D
Bento,2xpzdl,stenoknight,3,Tue Mar 3 00:24:49 2015 UTC,(Secretly I absolutely agree with you but I didn't want to look like a cheese fieeeeend.)
Bento,2xpzdl,keeper420,1 point,Tue Mar 3 00:42:37 2015 UTC,Own it! Life is too short to eat less than too much cheese!
Bento,2xpj91,Missperkygoth77,3,Mon Mar 2 20:56:39 2015 UTC,Quick and easy is good! May I offer a pro-tip? A quick and easy way to enhance the appeal of your sandwich is to cut it into fingers and pack them cut-side-up. :)

Bento,2xe6y6,Hizuri740,3,Fri Feb 27 21:08:15 2015 UTC,Made pork dumplings with rice. Tossed in some carrots for no other reason than they needed to be eaten. Also tried my hand at cutting seaweed into designs.
