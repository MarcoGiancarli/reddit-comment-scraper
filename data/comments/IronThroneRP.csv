He turned to observe his castle, just for kicks.  The central feature of the hold of the Jaynes was the Weeping Tower. 215 feet high, it soared into the sky above the Weeping Town. A smaller version of the Drum Keep of Storm's End, it was comfortably large, supported by six equidistant buttresses at it's base. Between every two buttresses was a door, which led to a crushed-seashell path to one of the six auxiliary buildings of the Keep, each built into the tall ringwall. There was a granary, kitchens, guest quarters, armoury, and gatehouse. A bright flame burned atop the Tower, a blatant copying of the Hightower. The Keep, all in all, was lordly in its comfort and quality, even though it was quite possibly the youngest castle in the realm. Each succeeding Jaynes generation had seen to that.  The gates creaked open. 50 feet beyond them, the buildings of the town started to march into the distance. Crossing the grassy park in the middle was a man in flamboyant blue Essosi finery. As he grew closer, Donnel observed his face and general bearing, Tyroshi.  He extended a hand as the man reached the shelter of the gatehouse. ""I am Donnel Jaynes, heir to the Weeping Tower. I presume you are King Jachaerys' envoy?"""

He stopped for a moment, before spotting the man just inside the gatehouse, obviously no guard or servant. By the look of his coloured doublet and stance, this was the noble he was looking for. Realising this, Jachaerys hurried his steps to the gatehouse. Taking the hand that was offered to him as the man spoke.   Racallio responded. ""Your presumptions prove correct. I am the glorious envoy of Jachaerys I Brigtscale, First of His Line, King of the Stepstones, and a half a dozen more titles. My name is Racallio, Lord of Fyrestone and my King's Justice"". He handed Donnel, his official seal, bearing the Brightscale crest of a golden dragon.   Though he may not be in the best mood, Racallio was dry now and that was enough for him. He removed his hat, the soggy peacock feather slumped depressingly to the side. He wronged it out before returning it to his head.   ""I am not the only envoy here of course, but my companion is, shall we say, handicapped and he travels slightly behind me. So this is the Weeping Tower?"" He looked around, appraising the castle's structure and contents.   ""Do you mind if we could get to somewhere a little drier? I must say I hate the Stormlands weather, I wish it wasn't so appropriately named. ""  May as well get to business sooner or later, I'll have to be on my way quickly.

As the figures reached the shore, Durran's gaze once more drifted to the merchant ship, set to sail in several days. The ship that brought his brother home, although not in the circumstances Durran had ever wanted.  The soft clinking of armor echoing closer to him through the castle made him turn, to see two of his household guards swiftly enter the room, bearing a letter with the king's seal.  ""What is this?""

Torric and both his brothers are imprisoned. The threat to the Crown has been defeated.   King Lyonel shall soon begin his march home to the capital, and begin attempting to set this realm to rights. You, I think, could do great good here.  While I understand that you are most likely fearful and uncertain of your position in this realm, having borne a crown upon your head mere weeks past, but I assure you that the power and prestige of House Tyrell has not been forgotten. We have come to an amicable resolution – and thus, I think, we can find amicable terms.  I would invite you to the Capital, to await the arrival of the King. It would save you a few days or even a week or two of waiting – time that can matter greatly for a man expecting the birth of his first child. This I know from experience.  You may bring with you however many men it takes for you to feel safe, and any lord or lady you think necessary to have. It is time we set aside the suspicion and hostility of these past few years, and recognize that we are no longer divided. We are a *kingdom again, and I wish only to foster unity.*  I must admit however – I have a long standing hope to share wine with a man of the Reach, and the chance to do so with the head of House Tyrell itself seems to me no small opportunity.  If that is not enough to convince you, however, think of this – Eon Arryn, Brandon Stark, Lyonel Baratheon, and Brandon Tully will all most likely come to the capital to settle this war in finality. I have invited Lord Martyn Lannister too, your goodbrother. These men shall likely decide the future of this realm in the coming days, and dictate the winners and losers of this war. Without you here, they shall do this without the input of the Reach – and was that not one of the reasons you marched in the first place?  I await your arrival with anticipation, and a bottle of wine from Yi Ti that would make the Lord of the Arbor himself weep tears of jealousy. Perhaps we shall share it one day.  Ardrian Celtigar, Hand of the King"

I mean to send word of this to the army still squatting upon our lands and bring them to heel.  In addition, word has reached us of a brewing rebellion in Dorne. It would seem that the Martells are not as popular with their vassals as they once war – there may very well be a full scale revolt any day now. I have sent my son, Jaehaerys, to treat with Olyvar Martell, and he is confident that the Prince is willing to resubmit to the Crown. It does look, however, like he is not in the position he once was. The rebels are numerous and powerful, by all rumor. The Yronwoods themselves lead. It could be prudent to allow it to continue, and let the Dornish choose from amongst their ranks who they wish to lead. The new ruler would be forever grateful to you. The Tyrells, Martells, and their supporters, will likely be most displeased.  Still, this descion is yours, and can wait for your return to the capital. We await your arrival eagerly – I wish greatly to see this new wife of yours, and to begin healing this divided land.  I’ve yet to choose a new High Septon – but there is a man here, an old friend of mine, who may yet prove perfect. He refuses to take on the responsibility, adamant that the Faith must choose its own head, but I disagree. Perhaps upon your return you shall be able to convince him of his duty. I think he would serve marvelously.  Beyond that, there is little to report. The Tyrells have sent no word, though they continue to await your arrival in the Kingswood last I heard. The Lannisters are moving, but no one knows where. I have sent Matarys with a group of ten thousand to rouse them out of their den and send them running. Now, I think, I shall have him deliver the good news. Kings Landing fares better as well – Riley Chelsted has proven an able and diligent steward. Perhaps with a few more years of labor, we will begin to see deep, long-lasting changes in the Old City.  That, I think, is enough news to bore you with. Enjoy your time in Riverrun, with your wife-to-be and her brother. Return home soon! There are celebrations in order.  Ardrian Celtigar, Your Leal Servant."

He drained his cup and requested another from a pretty little tavern wench with big blue eyes and hair kissed by fire. He gave her a wink and a pinch on the bottom as she giggle and ""M'Lorded"" him. He ran his hands through his messy blond hair as his blue eyes found Damien.  ""My good Lord of Lefford, you look absolutely uncomfortable! How may I assist you?""   He words ran slightly together as his head began to bobble. A loud ruckus erupted where his three companions were seated as Ser Godfrey the Good lofted a man over his head and tossed him out a window to the utter laughter and enjoyment of his two other companions. Alester grinned like a fool and let out a chuckle as he watched the mayham ensue. He turned back to Damien, eyes squinting with happiness.   ""Never fear my lord we aren't wearing our sigils, to these people we are simple rapscallions and ruffians. I'll be sure to give the bar keep his share for the broken window.""   He leaned in and signaled Damien to do the same and began speaking quietly.   ""Don't look Damien, just listen and if you must glance over ever so slightly. It's all about the ears and it's all about the act.""   He nodded to a group of men sitting quietly in the corner of the tavern.  ""Northmen.""   He nodded at another group of men sitting two tables away.   ""Sell Swords, more likely Westerlandmen save for the rather large man in their group, he's from Tyrosh.""   He sat back and took a deep pull of his ale, savoring the taste.   ""The one good Ser Godfrey threw out the window had been following us since the Golden Tooth. Not sure who he is but he'll be singing many a song here soon.""   He nodded back over to his group, one of them was missing. The man they called Ser Friendly."

Ser Willard had stumbled and collapsed, bringing a table and his friendly barmaid with him. Ser Kevan was glowering as he moved from his position by the door to retrieve his offspring. Banefort sauntered over to the table and sat across from Damien, taking time to flirt with a wench before he turned his focus to Damien. Damien cleared his throat slightly as he listened to the lord speak. Leaning in closely and hearing the words about the other men in the tavern.   Certainly, the feeling that a man had been following them was worrying, but not entirely unlikely, considering the ever present spies of the realm. Nevertheless, Damien chose to ask his question.  ""I would hate to be overheard, so if you wish to move somewhere safer, that is an option, but-"" he paused for a minute to gather his thoughts. ""What information do we plan on gathering in Riverrun, and how do we plan to do it?""  He had been turning these questions over in his head. They were valid, and he had begun to wonder whether his choice to bring two knights of House Lefford with him on a mission of intrigue was the most sound plan. Hopefully, the answer would ease these thoughts, but then again. Hardly anything Banefort had said up to this point had eased anything at all."
IronThroneRP,3d70xn,SmokeySmokes,2,Tue Jul 14 20:31:33 2015 UTC,"Lord Banefort's eyes shone with utter delight as the noise in the tavern picked up. He drowned himself in yet another cup of Ale and smiled as the bubbly drink dribbled down his goatee.   ""That's the point of the ruckus eh? Not much can be heard over such noise.""   He pulled his hood over his head and leaned back in his chair letting out an audible ahhhh as he relaxed.   ""Men in their cups are the best kind of men, they always say more than they mean and give away more than they realize.""   He looked around the tavern and frowned, he noticed Ser Friendly had returned from his duties and was drinking with the other men. He also noticed Damien's young ward attempting to be flirtatious with a young tavern girl.   I suppose Damien's right though, we won't find much in the ways of information in here.   Alester promptly stood up, wobbled a bit, collected himself, and then sat back down.   I'll have to remember this place, the ale is top notch He hiccuped to himself as he managed to stand once again. Good thing we are on horse back, I need water and a good piss to sober up.   ""Right my young lord, there seem to be fish swimming in my head and in my bladder. I shall have a piss and then we will leave this fine establishment.""   He stood again, much more steady this time around, and placed his hand on Damien's shoulder.   ""We also need to leave before your love struck ward ends up emptying his purse for that young lady he's been babbling over.""   He winked and then walked off to find the privy."

Damien needed to stop him before he left with the girl never to be seen again or his father had to toss him out the window like Ser Godfrey had. He walked away from the table and toward the boy, yet his father was already upon him. The aging knight was wrestling with his son, picking him up from the debris of his fall.   Damien walked over to the scene of wreckage caused by Willard, who's father was currently in the process of steadying. Damien offered a hand to the wench who was knocked down. As she stood up he apologized and asked where the owner of the establishment was. She motioned to a man, currently surveying the damage to his livelihood, and then hurried off. Damien moved to speak with the tavern owner, reaching for some kind of payment.   The indignant tavern owner turned quickly toward Damien. He raised his hand to point and accuse, Damien pressed a single golden dragon into his hand.   ""I am very sorry for the trouble we have caused, please forgive my companions and I"" said Damien as he swiftly turned from the astonished man. He strode out the door before the owner could say anything, giving Ser Kevan, who was still struggling with Willard, a slight tap on the shoulder and motioning for him to bring himself and his son outside as he went.  As Damien stepped out of the tavern, he turned to Alester, who had just finished relieving himself. He looked at him questioningly, then began to approach his horse."

Damn legs, if you don't go where I demand you go I'll have you both off and you can become iron replacements like my hand!  He finally made it to his horse and after a few feeble attempts, Ser Godfrey lifted him up onto his saddle for him. He steadied himself and downed a flaggon of ice cold water and began to feel better. He looked at Damien, who seemed to be waiting patiently for everyone to collect themselves, though his older companion had a scowl that could melt steel. Alester looked behind him at his own men, who all seemed to be on their horses and ready to be off, that is until Stephen Smiles fell from his saddle and was asleep before he hit the ground.   ""Ser Godfrey, be a good man and tie our friend Stephen to his horse so we can get moving.""   Godfrey nodded and with a grunt slung Stephen over his saddle and tied him tightly to his horse. As they began to trot off Alester looked back to Ser Friendly. The Banefort man nodded and trotted up next to him.   ""What did the tail have to say?""   Ser Friendly shook his head, his smile was all that could be seen under his dark hood.   ""Bit off his tongue, so I slit his throat.""   Alester shrugged.   ""Now that's dedication.""   Ser Friendly nodded.   ""Ey my lord, and he had nothing on his person to let us know who he was or why he was following us. Only a single golden dragon and a blank piece of paper.""   Lord Banefort stroked his goatee and pondered for a moment. He wrapped the reigns for his horse around his iron hand and used his good hand to examine the blank note paper. Nothing. He folded the paper and put it in his pocket for later examination. He looked over to Damien, who seemed a bit worried.   ""My lord of Lefford, what troubles you?"""

If this man was able to follow us, who's to say someone else is not. In addition, I ask again, what information do we plan to gather in Riverrun.""
