nonfictionbookclub,3c41g5,AndrewRichmo,1 point,Sat Jul 4 15:51:07 2015 UTC,"I thought the bits on “mood” and psychological warfare were interesting, and seem to apply just as well today. And 7.2, which (according to my translation) references the “harmony in the State,” is the first mention of the importance in warfare of the actual population, and the condition of the nation as a whole. But it seems like this is still not as prominent as it should be, at least in a modern context.  I was most interested that he says things like: “The art of war is of vital importance to the state;” (1.1) and “In war, the general receives his commands from the sovereign” (7.1, 8.1), but at 8.3 we get “There are … commands of the sovereign which must not be obeyed.”  So he goes out of his way to subordinate the general to the sovereign, which makes sense—war should be in service of the state, not an end in itself. But I can’t see how we end up with 8.3. I don’t think he’s changed his mind and thinks warfare somehow supersedes governance. And I can’t imagine he thinks the general should ignore only bad orders, since that’s analogous to a soldier ignoring Tsu’s orders, thinking they’re bad. I haven't been able to square this with the rest of the text."
nonfictionbookclub,3braui,AndrewRichmo,2,Wed Jul 1 14:52:47 2015 UTC,"Is anyone else following along with Jessica Hagy's Forbes diagrams?  Does it mean that I'm not a visual learner if half of these graphs only serve to confuse me further?  I'm not used to reading texts this old, but it strikes me how difficult it is to interpret.  A lot of the passages make no sense to me--even the commentators/translators can't agree on meaning.  Personally, ambiguity frustrates me.  Half the appeal of this book seems to be academically interpreting the vaguest passages. I'm not smrt enough for that.   Measurement owes its existence to Earth; Estimation of quantity to Measurement; Calculation to Estimation of quantity; Balancing of chances to Calculation; and Victory to Balancing of chances.   What in God's holy name does this mean?  The commentary in my book says Calculation to Estimation of quantity could be ""a calculation of NUMBERS, thereby making it nearly synonymous with the second term [Estimation of quantity to measurement.]""  So the second and third terms are either synonymous, or we've interpreted one of their meanings incorrectly, making the whole logical flow itself uninstructive.  It's just another thing of which to argue about the meaning.  I hate reading for 60 seconds straight and then not having any clue what I just read.  I suppose this is a prime example of being in over one's head.    Hence the skillful fighter puts himself into a position which makes defeat impossible, and does not miss the moment for defeating the enemy.   Floyd Mayweather would agree with this line, if he could read."
nonfictionbookclub,3braui,CoreyBrewersGoat,2,Wed Jul 1 18:12:29 2015 UTC,"I like the Forbes diagrams, but they're tailored to a very specific application of the book, and it seems like some of them have to twist Tsu's meaning to fit their own purpose. I'd definitely recommend a more general commentary, not necessarily in place of Hagy's, but at least in addition to it. (Gile's is linked to in the sidebar—it's not perfect, and it has the same issue with the measurement question, but it's good overall.)  I honestly just skipped over that section (4.18, right?) my first time through, but on a second read it seems like the meanings of the individual terms isn't as important as the recognition that Victory is grounded in an observation/awareness of ""Earth.""  1.8 says:   EARTH comprises distances, great and small; danger and security; open ground and narrow passes; the chances of life and death   So it looks like he's trying to encourage a close study of the logistics of a war, and the battleground itself. From there we can look at our army and the enemies (""calculation""/""estimation"") in the proper context and come up with an appropriate strategy.  That being said, I'm also fuzzy on the specifics, and my translator's commentary isn't a ton of help."

nonfictionbookclub,3braui,geleiademocoto,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:52:16 2015 UTC,"I found three things very interesting in this section. First, a lot of the section was devoted to various types of deception, which is one part of war that I don’t think has changed at all in 2500 years, except perhaps to have become more complex with increasing technology.  I'd also be interested to see how he thinks we should respond to an enemy using Tsu's tactics. E.g. Giles includes an anecdote about an emperor who, spying on his enemy, saw only infirm soldiers and emaciated cattle at his camp. Of course, the emperor ordered an attack. But his opponent had been taking Tsu's advice from earlier—when you are strong appear weak, and vice versa—and was actually luring the emperor into the battle. So it seems get complicated quickly in terms of both the tactics of deception, and the reasoning needed to apply and discover double-bluffs, and eventually triple-bluffs, and so on.  Finally, there is a lot of emphasis on preparation, which makes sense. But he takes it very far, as in 4.15, which tells us only to fight if we are already assured of victory. I think to be practically useful we have to scale this back a bit—we’re rarely going to have the certainty Tsu is looking for, especially if we’re fighting someone like Tsu himself, using the kind of double-bluffs and deception above."

nonfictionbookclub,3bel81,AndrewRichmo,5,Sun Jun 28 14:38:16 2015 UTC,"Disclaimer: I haven't read this book before, only the first three chapters so far. I am just familiar with it though osmosis because it seems like everyone else has read it.  So, this book is odd because of how it influenced two very separate cultures, initially it was read by military folks interested in theory of how to command and then it was co-opted by the business world. The edition we read is very much rooted in two time frames and cultures: ancient china and early 20th century europe. How those two conducted wars could be considered more similar to each other than how America's current set of wars are and have been conducted over the past 70 years.   When you look at this book from those two conflicting perspectives, there are bits and pieces that make sense in early 20th century warfare (the art of misdirection) that may not make you any friend in the office (why would you lie to your folks about project status? That's how you get a reputation for being that guy). Though there are people who will say that it can all be applied to the business sphere and business is warfare. I stereotypically think of these folks as being responsible for that mentality.  In the past 20 years, this was picked up by white collar folks as a way of approaching management. It is on every office shelf between ""How to Win Friends and Influence People""* and ""Who Moved My Cheese"". There are valuable lessons to be learned from this book as they apply to the business world. Reward your employees who do well and hold poor performance accountable. Projects should be well thought out so they can be executed quickly so as to not strain resources and morale. The more famous passages are taken up by marketing gurus and we came across one at the end of chapter 3**.  Marketing folks push this line forward as ""Know your prospective client and their needs and you will make the sale.""  Earlier, I mentioned how there is a disconnect from how America conducts warfare. Yes, I am not saying that our soldier's aren't disciplined, or have morale, or get exhausted, but that the dynamics of war have changed.   America has seemed to ignore points 5,6,7, 8, and 9*** of chapter 2. Our wars are no longer rapid, profitable, run with only one wave, or at the expense of the foreign countryside. Instead, we use clever devices (drones, intel, electronic surveillance) to conduct prolonged operations that barely qualify as war anymore. The Vietnam war scared the US into waging a new form of warfare that is as disconnected from Sun Tsu as it is from WW1.   Now where does this leave us? The two target spheres are the business world and the military world, but the bull market that saw the Art of War's rise in popularity burst with the dot-com bubble and again with the 2008 great recession. Other countries can still wage war for fun and profit, but most of europe and america does not wage war in a way that profits**** the soldiers*****.    How can this be applicable to you? Well, first of all reading to gain new perspectives is always good because it expands your mental horizons and gets you to think about things in a different light. If you don't get a single actionable line from this, it still has benefit of getting you to think from the perspective of an ancient chinese general.   The other bit is that through proper planning guided by experience, a properly executed plan requires discipline to do the hard thing and diligence to ensure that external factors aren't influencing the plan. This is very applicable to anything you do, be it a homework assignment or managing a project at work. Know when you should stick to the plan and when you should adapt. Hold yourself and those working with you accountable if needed and praise and reward diligence and discipline.    note *  I personally think that Dale Carnegie's ""How to win friends and influence people"" is possibly the best self help book for reddit's stereotypical target demographic. If you have a kid who is socially awkward, picked on, or unable to make friends, pick up a copy and each week read a chapter. In school, have your kid try to apply the principles of that chapter in school each day and talk about whether or not it worked and why. As someone who grew up with ADD******, I wish I had thought to do this earlier, but profited greatly from the book once I got a copy of the book in college.  note **   “If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.”   note ***   Thus, though we have heard of stupid haste in war, cleverness has never been seen associated with long delays.  There is no instance of a country having benefited from prolonged warfare.  It is only one who is thoroughly acquainted with the evils of war that can thoroughly understand the profitable way of carrying it on.  The skillful soldier does not raise a second levy, neither are his supply-wagons loaded more than twice.  Bring war material with you from home, but forage on the enemy. Thus the army will have food enough for its needs.    note ****   Please, leave the Military Industrial complex out of this. I think that real politik and all that is outside of the scope of Sun Tzu's writings.  note *****   Since time immemorial, the fine art of Sacking defeated cities and towns greatly profited and was responsible for funding military campaigns. Rome grew great by conquering other peoples, sacking their towns and removing any movable wealth, taking the local folks as slaves for ""low cost"" labor, and then taxing whoever remained to fund more military campaigns.   note ******  Can you tell?"
nonfictionbookclub,3bel81,hugemuffin,3,Sun Jun 28 15:18:59 2015 UTC,"i have to say that i am rather unnerved by the parallels between 'conquering your enemy' and 'getting a sale' what am i, some foreign power to be defeated? a rich land to be plundered? but i agree with you that it is right on point.   while US soldiers are not allowed to plunder, they are paid for their job. people join the military not only out of sense that they have a duty but because they can get education, housing, and guarantee of employment. if the country that is laying siege becomes enriched by weakening the other country, (more beneficial treaty negotiations, access to strategic lands1, business contracts that would not be available before2, etc) then it has a way to transfer the plunder to it's soldiers. the more medals you get the more benefits you get, is it not, in a way, plunder for the soldier?   russia has crimea, russia no longer needs to negotiate tedious and costly terms to aquire access to the sea. you can argue over if it was military or diplomatic action, but you cannot say there is no enriching going on. :) US overthrew the democratically elected governmet of Iran because said government socialized the oil industry and made it impossible for corporations like chevron to profit from it's resources."
nonfictionbookclub,3bel81,CrazyCatLady108,3,Sun Jun 28 23:14:39 2015 UTC,"It's indirect. So yes, soldiers do receive a housing allowance, and they do receive upwards mobility. Frankly, I am not aware of a better way of moving upwards in the social structure than via the military. Lower income teens gain access to training and the GI Bill, plus pay that is better than the minimum wage or ""other""* jobs available, housing, training, and a support structure geared to helping vets find a happy place in society. For middle class kids, they have access to college either via ROTC or the Academy and can get officer ranks. Four years as an officer in the right career track will help you skip the whole ""Need 5 years of experience for an entry level position"" treadmill and jump right not lower/middle management. If you go the 20, either officer or enlisted, you get paid 50% of your base salary and will draw anywhere between 25k and 60k per year to not show up to work at the age of 38-45. You can then start a second career easily making six figures in upper management in a wide variety of industries.   However, those benefits are available to you regardless of what your career field is.   The sad part is that those who do the heaviest lifting in modern campaigns get the least. Medals don't net you much, bronze stars get you a license plate, but nobody is looking to hire grunts into upper management. If you were a shoe clerk who only spent 2 years out in the desert, those benefits are just as available as if you were always out in the sandbox. In fact, the career fields that benefit you most after retirement/separation (acquisitions, communications, physics, etc) deploy the least (and if they do, you're only outside the wire if you draw the short straw of additional duties) and the fields that force you to be out in the sandbox all the time (security forces, infantry, tank drivers, convoy drivers, etc) have the least amount of opportunities in the civilian sector.   So yeah, it is possible by being a soldier/airman/seaman/marine to ""plunder"" and benefit greatly, but in today's modern economy, those give the most receive the least in ""plunder"".   And to circle back to your sales/enemy comparison, yes, marketing is mind control. Think about the adversarial relationship that comes to mind when you walk into a used car dealership.

nonfictionbookclub,3bel81,CrazyCatLady108,3,Mon Jun 29 00:10:59 2015 UTC,"So, to go back to the roman era, the army always existed as a kind of third (fourth, fifth, whatever) estate. If you could shack up with a standing army as a professional soldier, you could go off and hopefully draw a salary. In fact, a salary refers to the general category of allowances typified by salt (saline) rations given to soldiers as part of their pay. There are always examples of individuals using the army to advance (Oliver Cromwell was a poor noble who advanced to be Lord Protector of England, Thrax was a germanic tribesman who advanced to Emperor of Rome). But this wasn't the only track available to lesser sons in that there was also advancement into the middle class via apprenticeships (indentured servitude in exchange for training) or via the clergy.   However, I think that I'm getting too far away from the original text in that my point is that modern soldiers do not benefit from waging wars, but rather from being soldiers. Sun Tsu pretty much said to keep the profitability of war in mind in that attackers could gain plunder via sacks and their nations could profit by acquiring new taxable lands and people. The defenders wouldn't benefit personally other than by protecting their homes from being plundered and sacked and defending nations could demand payments from the attackers as part of peace treaties."
nonfictionbookclub,3bel81,hugemuffin,4,Mon Jun 29 00:29:18 2015 UTC,"2.6 says “There is no instance of a country having benefited from prolonged warfare,” which seems intuitive, but I think shows how much the subject has changed since Sun Tzu wrote:   I’m not sure how to do a full cost-benefit analysis here, but America’s wars in the Middle-East have brought a lot of profit to certain corporations, though I suppose this could have been better achieved with a fast and decisive victory; Wars can now be conducted for the price of a drone, some bombs, and some intelligence gathering (e.g. Yemen). It seems like the problem with putting together resources is somewhat nullified here, though again I don't know the precise costs; and  One of the much-touted effects of WW2 was its effect on the American economy. Unemployment fell drastically and GDP went up, and it seems (at least to a non-economist) that this was very good for the American economy.   This is an area where I’m a little under-informed, so I’d appreciate any corrections."
nonfictionbookclub,3bel81,hippiechan,3,Sun Jun 28 14:47:59 2015 UTC,"but America’s wars in the Middle-East have brought a lot of profit to certain corporations   Don't confuse personal profit with societal benefit. There were those that benefitted from the spoils of war even in Sun Tzu's time, but when countries and kingdoms fight wars over long periods of time, the costs add up. Militaries are expensive, require feeding and transport, and the attention paid to fighting a war distracts away from other problems. We'll read later that the best military strategy is to avoid fighting altogether, and it's because no war is the best war.   Wars can now be conducted for the price of a drone, some bombs, and some intelligence gathering   Not the case. Drones can be implemented, but they're imperfect and expensive, and also require an operator in many cases, so eliminating the human aspect doesn't quite occur in full. Military equipment will always come with costs. No matter what those costs are, they will always be greater than zero, and will always be more expensive than not fighting.   One of the much-touted effects of WW2 was its effect on the American economy. Unemployment fell drastically and GDP went up, and it seems (at least to a non-economist) that this was very good for the American economy.   More people working to turn the gears of war isn't a new occurrence. Don't forget, Germany also experienced low unemployment and high GDP growth leading up to World War 2 and during the first phases of the war. The only difference is, Germany lost and the US did not. If the economic spoils of war are going to come down to who wins, then you're going to need more than strong growth numbers and boastful statistics to make them count."
nonfictionbookclub,3bel81,hippiechan,1 point,Mon Jun 29 00:09:35 2015 UTC,"Don't confuse personal profit with societal benefit.   I don't think I am. Of course the costs add up, but if whatever is paying those costs is getting money back (whether the King takes the spoils or the government taxes a company), the point—that there is profit from war—stands.  I've just remembered a better example. In the First Crusades, there were a number of Jewish communities bribing Christian armies to leave them alone. So it became profitable for the army to keep fighting the war, maintain the threat, and extracting bribes, and this is exactly what they did. So long as that money is going to the group paying for the war, the war is making them money. I think we can imagine quite a few situations where this would work.   Military equipment will always come with costs. No matter what those costs are, they will always be greater than zero, and will always be more expensive than not fighting.   Good point, I won't deny the costs. I'm just saying there are cases, or at the very least possible cases, where you're making more than you're spending.   The only difference is, Germany lost and the US did not. If the economic spoils of war are going to come down to who wins, then you're going to need more than strong growth numbers and boastful statistics to make them count.   This makes a lot of sense. I wasn't thinking that one country eventually bulldozes the other. Though if you were fairly sure you could win, it still seems like a good bet to go in for a long war.  But I think the intuition my original post came out of was this: we're agreeing that the German and American economies improved throughout the war, so there is the possibility, at least in theory, for a perpetual war that is beneficial to both nations. All that's needed is the assurance that neither side will eventually bulldoze the other, and a drawn-out war becomes a great idea. It would be difficult to get that assurance, if not impossible, and having no intention to win would bend the definition of 'war,' so maybe a mutual perpetual war isn't possible outside of 1984.  But I think the Crusades, or a larger-scale war where the aggressor is obviously stronger (e.g. if there were no chance for America to lose to Germany) are perfect examples of the profits of war, even long-term."

So long as that money is going to the group paying for the war, the war is making them money. I think we can imagine quite a few situations where this would work.   I still think you're missing the point of the passage. First of all, no one can fund a war forever; the costs of war build up over time, even if you're a funder who's completely disconnected from the conflict. Second, it isn't a matter of whether or not someone benefitted from war or if incentives were aligned in a way that made war the best option for those involved. Finding examples of times where someone made a profit off of war or when war was ""the best route"" for some group of people isn't really a counterargument.  I'm sure that Sun Tzu was very aware that these things were possible, and they probably occurred many times throughout Chinese history as well. His point is much larger - war wears a country down, makes the people tired, makes the soldiers tired, makes everyone disheartened. It can leave an impact on society that takes years to overcome, and leaves significant cultural and historical impacts along the way. War might benefit some people, but on the whole, it is not 'beneficial'.   Though if you were fairly sure you could win, it still seems like a good bet to go in for a long war.   If you are certain to win, then the war shouldn't be a long one.   It would be difficult to get that assurance, if not impossible, and having no intention to win would bend the definition of 'war,' so maybe a mutual perpetual war isn't possible outside of 1984.   You'll find that a lot of people (philosophers, economists, military strategists, etc) are opposed to the idea of ""eternal war"" being possible for many good reasons, Sun Tzu among them. What is the point of war if you're not in it to win? What point is there to conflict that has no end, because the resolution doesn't exist?  I can't imagine a real world scenario in which the stable equilibrium is fighting forever. I think you're underestimating the costs of war and overestimating the benefits a little too much. Does preparing for a war yield benefits due to increased productivity? Of course it does, but you'll find that as time goes on, you're spending less on healthcare, education, sciences funding, infrastructure, things that your country needs to be truly prosperous. War can benefit some, but it doesn't make everyone as prosperous as peace does."

Why do you think the cost of war grows and the profits don't?   Second, it isn't a matter of whether or not someone benefitted from war or if incentives were aligned in a way that made war the best option for those involved. Finding examples of times where someone made a profit off of war or when war was ""the best route"" for some group of people isn't really a counterargument.   Maybe I'm misunderstanding you—why do you think that profitable, prolonged wars aren't counterexamples to the claim that ""There is no instance of a country having benefited from prolonged warfare?""   His point is much larger - war wears a country down, makes the people tired, makes the soldiers tired, makes everyone disheartened.   America has been waging a drone war going on in Yemen for ~8 years that the American public is barely aware of, let alone being worn down by it.   If you are certain to win, then the war shouldn't be a long one.   You can be certain to win because of your endurance, because the enemy is going to run out of resources in 50 years and you in 51, or any number of other reasons. Certainty ≠ speed.  I think the second-last paragraph is just agreement with my point that ""maybe a mutual perpetual war isn't possible outside of 1984,"" so cheers to that!   You'll find that as time goes on, you're spending less on healthcare, education, sciences funding, infrastructure, things that your country needs to be truly prosperous. War can benefit some, but it doesn't make everyone as prosperous as peace does.   If your point is that the profits of war generally don't reach the masses, I agree, but I'm not sure if this is Tzu's point. When he writes, in 2.6, that ""there is no instance of a country having benefited from prolonged warfare,"" ""country"" could mean the whole of the population. Some of his points—10-14—concern the people themselves. But others—2, 3, 4, 9—are strictly to do with weakened soldiers, expensive supplies, etc., all of which are nullified by a profitable, modern war. I'm arguing against the latter, it sounds like you're arguing for the former."

America has been waging a drone war going on in Yemen for ~8 years that the American public is barely aware of, let alone being worn down by it.   If Americans are barely aware of it, then I would imagine it barely deserves to be called 'a war'.   You can be certain to win because of your endurance, because the enemy is going to run out of resources in 50 years and you in 51, or any number of other reasons.   What you're describing is a siege, not a war. Even then, an army sieging a city for more than a few years will get up and leave, because there's nothing in it for them for decades to come. Fifty years is a long time to do anything, especially fight.  You're reading these chapters and thinking up arguments against why the text is incorrect in a modern context, without thinking about the meaning of the text. Do some people profit from war? Yes. Can you be certain of winning a siege if you do it for long enough? Yes. Can you attack people half way around the world with automatic drones? Yes.  Is there an instance of a country having benefitted from prolonged warfare? I challenge you to find one."
nonfictionbookclub,3bel81,CrazyCatLady108,2,Mon Jun 29 03:20:06 2015 UTC,"This is a twofold statement about the monetary and personal cost of an army, and I think you're over-complicating the idea.  This entire second section is about the price of an army (in my edition it's titled ""Waging War,"" and I can't tell if that's a pun), which is why it opens with the author making an account of a recommended army composition and the cost of the required equipment: the main idea being that war is expensive.  But more important than the dollars and cents of it is the physical and emotional toll on the soldiers themselves.  ""A victory that is long in coming will dull their weapons and dampen their ardor,"" the longer you keep an army marching, the more likely people are to attempt desertion and the more likely they will be tired and worn out with broken equipment.  If you haven't figured it out by now, Sun Tzu really doesn't like war, so the quicker it's over, the better.  Regardless of the time period, prolonged warfare means the state is spending a lot of money on army upkeep (most Total War players already know how devastating that cost can be), and the soldiers are more likely to be tired and ineffective.  And this hasn't changed in the modern era.  Those corporations you mentioned may be profiting from the conflicts in the Middle East, but they are still being taxed by the government (I'd also like to point out these business likely aren't directly owned by the state, so those are private interests) in order to help fund the massive military budget the Department of Defense submits every year. And of course soldiers are only allowed to tour active duty for so many months at a time for the exact same reasons why Sun Wu advised against a prolonged campaign. Obviously populations have boomed and warfare has evolved into utilizing fewer soldiers to a unit/squad/whatever so that soldiers can be constantly cycled in and out of duty, but the reasoning behind such procedure is based in the ideas written here and proven in practice and psychology that the longer you fight the worse it is.    So I'd have to completely disagree with your statement of how much has changed, and instead I'd argue this chapter shows how much is still the same.  A few thousand years later there are more levels and intricacies to it, but what's found in the Art of War and other contemporary writings are the foundation for just about all of those new ideas.  This is where Ron Perlman comes in to tell us that war... war never changes."
nonfictionbookclub,3bel81,geleiademocoto,3,Sun Jun 28 19:01:44 2015 UTC,"I would agree that not much has changed. I'd also like to get an opinion about other costs that could be incurred with prolonged warfare. Even if a country(let's say America) were to engage in a conflict on the back of the moral high ground, which Sun Tzu calls the Moral Law, dissent will occur within the country about the poor execution of the war and the cost incurred through relationships with other countries as well as unnecessarily remaining in combat(this might be due to a lack of transparency or cynicism from the perception of the state).   Recent situations where fighting IS or other insurgents would have been an easy move from America are questioned by internal and external powers like Congress and NATO respectively in the wake of Iraq and Afghanistan. Even if corporations that profited are being taxed, it's only a small percentage that goes back to the state(good tax lawyers and better lobbyists), so the transfer of money is a losing one for the state. Chapter 2, Point 10 sums it up I believe.  You have private companies fighting along the state, and after a while, only those private companies win and the country suffers."

nonfictionbookclub,3bc8y2,SoupForDummies,1 point,Sun Jun 28 08:21:32 2015 UTC,"After reading his book a few years ago, I found the email address of a memory athlete mentioned in it, Englishman Ben Pridmore. I emailed him to ask about the former memory athlete who now claims to be an autistic savant, AKA Daniel Tammet.   I can PM his response to anyone here who is interested. It basically said that Foer and Pridmore disagree on whether Tammet is still ""a threat to the memory athlete community"".   What I'm really curious about is why Foer quit memory competitions after becoming the U.S. Memory Champion in 2006. I can understand taking time off to write his book, but why hasn't he competed since then?  Other memory athletes have done TED talks too, such as Australian Daniel Kilov. I remember Kilov's name and nationality by imagining Donkey Kong invading Australia.  Ironically, Daniel Tammet did a TED talk the year Foer's book came out - where Foer says that Tammet is essentially faking his savant skills and is just using memory techniques. Tammet has never addressed his critics directly. I have been fascinated by Tammet since early 2009, a couple years before Foer's book was published. Tammet did an AMA in October 2013, and I'd like to see Foer do one too, especially considering his memory athlete mentor Ed Cooke has also done one.  This is probably more information than you really wanted to know, but feel free to PM me if you managed to read this whole comment and want to know still more."

nonfictionbookclub,3b65ig,EdwardCoffin,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:57:52 2015 UTC,"Well, first off the /r/chomsky book club was for reading books that the man had read, not written, so there is perhaps less interest in that.  The two reads we did were relatively unsuccessful, with the general conclusion being that the first book was far too dense for easy reading, so the first thing many people abandoned when other things made demands on their time, and Homage to Catalonia being far too easy to warrant a book club.  Here's the discussion after the first read (the difficult book): http://www.reddit.com/r/chomsky/comments/27oq2l/book_club_comments_and_further_reading/ and here's the main thread about choosing a book that preceded the first reading: http://www.reddit.com/r/chomsky/comments/1zj1gp/rchomsky_book_club_and_discussion_what_shall_we/ .  The final post I linked to above has the discussion about where the second reading went wrong.  As for myself, I think that reading a book that Chomsky read and was influenced by is less valuable to me because I don't have the background he does.  For instance, with Homage to Catalonia, he approached it with a far different background than I did: he had followed the war in the papers, very closely, and was mainly reading the independent press, so had a less clouded view of it than most people would.  For me, Orwell's book was the only information I had on the war.  Similarly for the other book, The Golden Rule.  I'm sure that much of the material in that book was just providing more details and interpretation of events he was already somewhat familiar with.  For me, much of it was new."
