DataHoarder,3e3le8,thedangerman007,19,Tue Jul 21 18:16:41 2015 UTC,"While I appreciate the sentiment (trying to save me money), as I thought I made clear in the post, I am aware that they are expensive.  I did not ask ""Hey, what's the cheapest price per GB of media or drives?""  I am interested in this form factor, and in this case, 100gb is the most you can jam into it.   I've got a bunch of computers, including a few laptops, that have blu-ray drives, and to me it is an excellent way of adding 100gb in media without worrying about using usb ports, or taking more space with an external drive (and possible power supply), and not worrying about having internet access."
DataHoarder,3e3le8,Hotch1,6,Tue Jul 21 19:59:41 2015 UTC,"Sadly, there is no a lot of information on this subject, and you might just be the source of it for all of us!"
DataHoarder,3e3le8,Diesel4719,11,Tue Jul 21 20:25:57 2015 UTC,"Then just buy them and find out. Most people won't go that route for normal usage because of the time investment. Also, 100GB isn't that much anymore. You'll have to find this info out for yourself."
DataHoarder,3e3le8,snrrub,11,Tue Jul 21 20:21:57 2015 UTC,"I'm curious about a few things. I know you need a modern blu-ray burner with recent firmware to even write the discs (which I have) but what I don't know is whether once a disc is written, can it be read on less modern drives?   100GB and 128GB discs fall under the BDXL specification. To write or read them you specifically need a BDXL-capable drive.   It's not just a case of new or old - plenty of current model drives are not BDXL capable.   Check the drive specs if you are in doubt."
DataHoarder,3e3le8,Repaxan,6,Tue Jul 21 23:10:23 2015 UTC,"One review I read (of the BD-RE version, which I don't want, I want write once) said that .mp4 files get hosed by the UDF format the discs need, which didn't make sense to me.   That's BS, UDF is just a filesystem, a file is a file is a file."
DataHoarder,3e3le8,nemothorx,7,Tue Jul 21 21:37:05 2015 UTC,"afaik, you are right about mp4 being fine on UDF, but    a file is a file is a file.   ...is not always true in all contexts. ReiserFS v3, for example, cannot house ReiserFS v3 images, without the whole lot becoming messed up if you run reiserfsck. Presumably a smarter reiserfsck could have fixed that, but it never eventuated.  I'm only citing this as an example of an edge case where the data within a file is not safe to store within that filesystem :)  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReiserFS#fsck"
DataHoarder,3e3le8,StrangeWill,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:36:52 2015 UTC,That seems more of a problem with the fsck implementation for ReiserFS instead of ReiserFS itself though.
DataHoarder,3e3le8,grumbel,3,Wed Jul 22 04:35:37 2015 UTC,"Well, with UDF you shouldn't have much problems as it's not quite as strict, but when you use ISO to burn Blurays it's very easy to run into issues with directory size, filename length, character set or file size."

DataHoarder,3e3le8,JimboLodisC,6,Wed Jul 22 00:59:16 2015 UTC,I found the selection of in-flight entertainment was more than satisfactory for the length of my overseas trip. The convenience was good enough to keep my laptop in my bag for the entire 8 hours.  Plus you have to pay a premium for a seat with more than just a USB port to charge a device.
DataHoarder,3e3le8,clickwir,2,Tue Jul 21 19:21:32 2015 UTC,Really the only question is can these burned discs be read by other drives. It's $9. Try it.   Other than the stated uses (archive or offline access) it doesn't seem like a useful endeavor. Too many down sides.
DataHoarder,3e3le8,innrautha,2,Wed Jul 22 00:13:08 2015 UTC,"If it were just $9 I would have bit the bullet and ordered one and not worried about it.  I should have specified that the $9ish each is if you buy in quantity - so to get that price I need to buy 10 of them.  Individually they run  about $20 for no-name ones, $30 for a brand like Verbatim."
DataHoarder,3e3le8,tisti,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:30:45 2015 UTC,"Why I don't have person use with them have you considered ""Disc rot"" (link is about CDs/DVDs specifically), especially with your suggestion of safe deposit box usage (probably not environmentally controlled). How long do you want them to survive and in what environment? Another thing to consider is that continuously using the discs (semi permanent use in a disc reader) will greatly degrade their lives.  A stackexchange post says some manufacturers claim discs last 100-150 years, but a sony support question says 30-50 years. So I'd try to get information for whatever specific discs you buy.  For use on a laptop for overseas flights they should be fine, though if you are using an external disc drive then a rewritable flash drive (128 GB for ~40 $) may be more convenient and smaller (and cheaper after a few flights). For archival use they definitely beat flash memory (which can degrade after a few years), and while there is the insane M-Disc which claims 1000 years of storage (under optimal conditions) I've read that you require a special burner since it uses a metal write surface (and is only 25 GB).  Are you more interested in archival, or temporary storage?"

So, all you have to do is install mdadm and have it scan/assemble the drives, it will automatically find the raidset metadata and assemble itself.   Google around, there is one command you should do to append the /etc/mdadm.conf config file that basically just says ""this raid set with this ID is /dev/md0, this raid set with this ID is /dev/md1"", etc so they always get named to the correct md device name if you use symlinks or anything like that."

I can then restore from a local/usb disk/ net share the image back over the disk.  As long as the destination disk is the same size or bigger you can clone to it. Assume you would need to create the raid array on the destination first for the OS.  Found this for outline on how to use it - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS6VhLDw-io  Hope that helps :-)

It's not comparable to raid 5 because that drops the array at any loss of 2 disks. Raid 6 can handle it better for sure. But that has other potential penalties like write performance due to multiplication of writes, slower rebuild speed and loss of performance during a rebuild.  I started with just 2 separate raid 1 mirrors, expanded one of those to raid 10 and now have 4 in raid 10 and 2 sets of raid 1s. At some point I will probably switch to z2 or z3."
DataHoarder,3dytww,unsaltedbutter,2,Mon Jul 20 17:46:04 2015 UTC,"Thank you. I get that logically speaking that would be the case, but I'm not seeing a lot of articles mentioning this drawback of RAID 10, so I thought either everyone's playing dumb or I'm the dumb one, just need to confirm. I wasn't comparing to RAID 5 in regard to how many disks fail but rather which disk fail. RAID 5, or 6 tolerate any disks, vs RAID 10 would tolerate a specific disks to fail. For myself I'm already running z2."
DataHoarder,3dytww,Bees37,2,Mon Jul 20 18:04:30 2015 UTC,"In your example, your raid 10 array can tolerate any one disk failing.  The second disk is where things can go either way.  If the second disk to fail is part of a different mirror, your array is (still) degraded, however your data is still available.  Same goes for the 3rd disk failure, if part of another mirror from the 1st or 2nd mirror, the array remains degraded but the data is still available.  On the other hand if any 2 disks from the same mirror both fail the whole RAID 10 array becomes UNavailable.  This can all be slightly different with different RAID 10 configurations from your example, however, two things remain constant with RAID 10:  1-You can lose ""UP TO 1/2"" your disks from the RAID 10 array and still have available data. 2-You cannot lose more that 1/2 of the disks from the same mirror set in a RAID 10 array.  As mentioned previously RAID 10 is usually chosen for decreased parity calculations vs RAID 5 or 6 (Mirrors are far less complex to calculate than striping with distributed parity) and for increased write throughput vs single disk or simple mirrors while maintaining redundancy."
DataHoarder,3dytww,fryfrog,2,Mon Jul 20 18:34:42 2015 UTC,"I try very hard to mention this any time I see someone suggest a pool of mirrors. You're only guaranteed survival of one disk failure, the second always has a chance of taking out the entire pool. As you add disks, the chance goes down and if you replace the failed disk, rebuild is very quick and the window is smaller. But the risk is always there.  Personally, I much prefer ZFS's raidz3 or raid6. My main goals are maximizing use of space and minimizing vulnerability to disk failure. I don't mind that reads and writes aren't blazingly fast, they still saturate my gigabit network and that is all that matters.  There is no question that raid10 has its place, but I think for most /r/DataHoarder users, it just isn't the right choice. If it is the right choice, you'll know it. And if it is and you need more resiliency, a 3 way mirror will set you right.  If you're using ZFS and can only buy a couple disks at a time, then I think a pool of mirrors is acceptable. But honestly, I'd use btrfs instead if I found myself in this situation. I'd use its raid1, with migrating to raid6 for the future when it is considered stable and well tested."
DataHoarder,3dytww,fryfrog,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:28:24 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I was spec'ing a NAS for a business client and this question had lingered in my head for a while. Again, I understand it logically, just find it strange that it isn't so much as listed under cons for RAID 10 in articles on the topic and makes me think I'm being dumb.  As for saturating bandwidth... I'm starting to feel the drag of raidz2's bottle neck to each disk' performance on my personal NAS, it's not saturating my gigabit, let alone future plan of teaming 4 Gb interfaces together, but hopefully by then I have a RAID 10 made of SSDs in there for high speed stuff."
DataHoarder,3dytww,fryfrog,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:41:40 2015 UTC,"How many disks? My 12x 4T raidz3 saturates my gigabit network. I added another 12x 4T vdev to the pool, so it should be even faster now.  I'm sure you're aware you can use multiple raidz(2|3) vdevs in a pool, I'm sure?"
DataHoarder,3dytww,fryfrog,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:59:02 2015 UTC,"yea I know I can use multiple raidz arrays. The risk of multiple disks fail at the same time increases as the number disks per array increase so good practice is split into multiple arrays and merge them in a pool. I'm guessing you're using the NORCO 24 disks chassis? I have that chassis too. Right now running 10x3T raidz2, I will add another 10 disks later when higher capacity disk price come down, but not sure about adding it to the pool, maybe just move data from 1 to another then retire the old array and repeat, instead of spending 10 days rebuilding disk-by-disk to expand the array. I don't know, I'll see what my needs is like in the future. As for the extra 4 disk slots, that's where the RAID 10 SSD will go for high performance stuff.  edit:when I first build the NAS, sure it saturated my network bandwidth, but now it only does like 2/3 the speed. I think the reason is my torrent/plex activities going on locally that takes away some of the drive's bandwidth. The 3TB drives are only capable of 100~110MB/s write anyways (the 1.5TB drives max out around 50MB/s so). Since you're using 4TB I guess it's faster than mine."

DataHoarder,3dxd0n,weeandykidd,5,Mon Jul 20 09:01:56 2015 UTC,I think mediainfo will give you the output of all videos in a folder recursively including their codec. You could then write a simple script in w/e language you want to open the outputted file and filter out those that are already h.264 providing you with the final list of those ot be encoded.

It's an estimate of how frequently you will experience a failure assuming you replace the drive with the same model when it's service life (3-5 years) is over. So as long as you replace the drive when that 3-5 years is up you should be good. Most people don't run drives like that.

I think the problem is a poor airflow strategy.  From my quick look at the pics, you seem to be blowing air at your HDDs rather than past them.  This is huge.  Air (like most things) takes the path of least resistance.  The only way to get it to slip through the narrow cracks between the drives is to force it.  To force it, you need to contain pressure between the fan and the HDDS.  If that's not enough, fans with higher static pressure, or a push/pull configuration would liekly help a lot.  tl;dr put a shroud around the fans that makes it so all air exiting the fans has no choice other than to pass over HDDs."

DataHoarder,3dwglb,Defiant001,-1,Tue Jul 21 12:29:48 2015 UTC,"Ok none of this makes sense to me.   Why is CPU usage an issue for the person playing? Why would anyone care that their device is under heavier load? Its also the only way to watch something without reduction in quality You can watch a 360p video on a TV, my point is that there is no reason to reduce the quality of a video unless you have to. You again seem to not understand. If I decide to do a 10 minute task of using my entire upload speed then the video will buffer for 10 minutes... that is stupid.   Why exactly do they want to revert from 1080p to 240p randomly when I want to do upload intensive tasks?   Hey good for you... but I'm not interested in caring about if my streamers can access my service correctly or needing to shut them down for X amount of hours while I use my HTPC or upload bandwidth for specific purposes that require all resources.   The whole point to this service is that anything they request is at the lowest priority in the network chain so I don't have to be limited by the fact that someone wants to see a TV show or movie."

If it really changes a lot you could have them use a dynamic DNS setup but then you'd need to update your side as well.  VPN is another solution and more secure.

Then they can simply use Windows Explorer to copy and paste the files to their computer.  http://www.southrivertech.com/products/webdrive/  http://www.southrivertech.com/support/webdrive/v12/  My sister's been using this program since 1999 to interface to her website, I mapped different web server directories to various drive letters on her computer so she can use Windows Explorer to easily access files on her site without her having to learn how to use an FTP program.  She clicks on the WebDrive icon and then new drive letters appear in Computer or Windows Explorer, it can't be made any simpler than that for her.  Since it uses Windows drive letters, I wrote an old school batch file to copy all the files off of the website and store them locally.  Instant backup!"

I used to be scared of using encryption so I don't lose all my shit, but the more I learned about how it exectly works and wrote an AES256 encrypter/decrypter myself, and I learned that it's quite fail-safe. For example, if data gets corrupted, you only lose that block which got corrupted, and block size is usually 128bits=16bytes, which is not a big deal whatsoever.  If you backup your volume headers in Veracrypt, you are pretty much fully 100% safe from losing you stuff, unless of course you forget the password.

DataHoarder,3dtovu,gandaroth,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:10:58 2015 UTC,Multiple key support is one of the nicer things with LUKS.   So you just use keyfiles for ease of auto unlock. Not for improved security. (If you still have a human memorable password the volume is no more secure than that password)

DataHoarder,3drqup,killfall,7,Sat Jul 18 20:43:16 2015 UTC,"I'll take a stab at this since I just recently started a big paper scanning/archiving project at home.   I have a folder called ""File Cabinet"" that I use for scanned documents (and downloaded/saved PDFs). I do this just to keep it separate from the other random documents that seem to accumulate on my disk.  The structure is: Category/Subcategory/YYYY.MM.DD - Description.pdf. I decided I didn't want an endless list of nested folders to drill through when trying to find something, so every file (with a few exceptions) is never more than 2 folders down.  The date at the beginning of the filename keeps everything in chronological order even if modified/created dates get messed up, and I can always just do a keyword search if I'm trying to find something that I don't know the date of. I archive ""important"" papers.  The definition of ""important"" evolves over time though. My original goal was to do weekly batches, but lately it's been more like monthly batches.  I'm still way behind on scanning in old documents I've collected over the last several years. I only keep paper copies of ""official"" documents: titles, licenses, things with official signatures that you need the original copy of, etc.  All of those go into a fireproof file safe.  Everything else gets recycled and/or shredded as soon as it's scanned. I have cloud backups of the documents, and the login info to access that is shared with my wife.  My parents and I have been in talks about giving each other backup copies of our password vaults (with the master password) in case something happens, but we haven't actually done it yet.

DataHoarder,3dmmp1,thedangerman007,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:33:47 2015 UTC,"z1 vs z3 is a fairly large difference in fault tolerance, I'm not sure dropping from 9x in z3 to 5x in z1 wouldn't result in a fairly large drop in reliability. I realize that few drives means fewer chances for failure, but it's going from being able to withstand 3 failures out of 9 to just 1 failure out of 5. Not everything is about pure performance. If he wanted max performance, he could go with ""RAID"" 0. Also, the server has 96GB of RAM. With that sort of cache, I'm not sure there'd be a big difference in performance between 2 vdevs in z1 vs 1 in z3."
DataHoarder,3dmmp1,PBI325,2,Sat Jul 18 03:42:00 2015 UTC,"A 5 disk Z1 vdev is a safe size. If it were 6, I would say Z2, but at 5 it is perfectly safe. The rebuild time occurs fast enough.  The penalty for using Z3 instead is far more massive than you give credit. It's not about the fact it's Z3, it's that it's also compared to two Z1's in a pool. I'm not even talking about max performance, I'm talking about actual usable performance. The logic behind Z3 is a significant hit to performance.  96GB of cache doesn't mean the whole pool is going to be hot. It still takes time for data to enter the arc, and even still, RAM doesn't accelerate the writing. ZIL is on disk. As such using 2 z1 vdevs in the pool means writes would be substantially faster than the z3.  It's a bad idea. I've provided support for multiple organizations running ZFS in production, as well as drilled Oracle staff on ZFS details. This would even be the recommended method from Oracle/SUN."

It's a re-branded Intel 10Gb XF card. Works great on both FreeBSD and Windows 7+. No having to deal with crazy hacks or drivers for FC or InfiniBand.  Then get some LC to LC OM3 fiber off ebay for 15$ and directly connect the NAS and desktop. You now have 10Gb to the NAS for ~115$. You do need to install drivers on Windows 7 for it though, but it's just the simple official Intel 10G installer https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/50271/Intel-10-Gigabit-XF-SR-Server-Adapter."

I did it all with OM3 MM 10Gb fiber, i have my Mac, 3 ESXi hosts, FreeNAS, and my homemade SAN connected all through a 10Gb backbone. The switch i picked up is from 2007, but it does the job, it has 1 RJ-45 for management which is all i need, in saying that my 10Gb network is completely isolated from my normal LAN and that is perfectly fine with me, because 90%o of all the data goes through the 10GB; FreeNAS, VM's, SAN, and iSCSI.

My FreeNAS i get average read/writes of 250-300Mb, most of the data that's being transferred is from VM's taking in data from the 1GB LAN and sending it over the 10Gb to FreeNAS to store, or VM's sorting through data and placing it in the proper directories of FreeNAS. I pretty much use it as my ""Data backbone"", because its where all the iSCSI LUNs come from, and how all the VM's access FreeNAS, very few devices access FreeNAS from the 1Gb side.

My QNAP has ""cloud apps"" as well but I've generally ignored them, does this function like Dropbox where it is a ""instant update"" local folder or is this more of a web page ""browse and download/upload"" solution?"
DataHoarder,3dmood,ConvertsToMetric,2,Fri Jul 17 19:17:25 2015 UTC,"Sorry it's called Cloud Station. Too many cloud names....  Anyway, yeah the functionality is similar to Dropox. The PC client is pretty much the same. It'll just watch a local folder and sync with the NAS whenever there is a change. By default local files on the PC that get deleted are automatically restored from the NAS. You can change that to sync deletes as well though. The mobile client has more flexibility than the Dropbox client. It's pretty nice now that it's finally maturing."

After reading more I read up on the parking issue but reading the SMART data I've only had approx 500 cycles in that month period.. Im concerned im not reading it correctly, are there any performance / noise issues that are happening from the parking that I can check?   Thanks."
DataHoarder,3dlpm0,twizzlebizzle21,2,Fri Jul 17 13:21:42 2015 UTC,"I have no idea, but hopefully somebody chimes in.  To me, 500 load cycles / parks in a month sounds more in line with what I'd expect.  Mine seems to be more on track to maintain about 35,000 a month.   When the head parks, I think you can hear a faint tick/click sound as the read head comes to rest on the landing zone.  ...I think.  I'd better just back away slowly and let someone else take over."

DataHoarder,3dlpm0,WyattGorman,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:34:16 2015 UTC,"Hi, you posted on the Covecube forums about the same issue, I believe, and got a very good answer from them. It's possible that StableBit is having trouble reading the drive's SMART status (as is SeaTools) since it's behind a StarTech USB PCIe adapter. You say that your scans don't show any bad sectors, so the drive could be fine. You could RMA it back to Seagate and get a new one, to be sure. I agree with what the person on Covecube said about getting another drive as well, every manufacturer has failures, get the best deal. NAS drives are always better in NAS workloads (constantly on, high I/O, etc)."

One thing I never did was just plug it into the USB 2.0 ports in my computer tower and see if the value changes.  Will do that this evening.    If it's legitimately high load cycles, to RMA it with seagate over load-cycle count only, will they do that?  Or do I have to find a way to make it fail some kind of other test before they'll RMA the drive?"

It was great to discover that I wasn't addicted to the physical print media but to the content, so it was easy to switch to electronic. For someone collecting newspapers, it could be the same -- instead of filling up a room with old newspapers you fill out a small drive. You still get to scratch the hoarding itch, but there isn't much visible ""environmental"" impact.  I wonder if that would work also for someone hoarding, let's say, dolls or something similar.

DataHoarder,3dkaqj,IsaacJDean,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:58:08 2015 UTC,"Sorry for short original comment. Basically SOS is focussed on cloud backup where as Crashplan can backup to multiple hard drives with set times between backups, as well as deduplication, etc. I have multiple hard drives with different data that I like to backup to different places at different times.   For example, I have a 'workspace' folder where I put my current projects into (media production) that gets backed up every 10 minutes. But I also have a folder for media production that's more of an archive for older projects. That only gets backed up once per day. Crashplan has the fine control I want/need.  It's not perfect though. Upload to the cloud is usually slower than you might expect. Depending on your home connection it probably won't get maxed out."

I ended up going with Amazon Cloud Drive in conjunction with SyncbackPro. Offers good local AES encryption, solid upload speeds and at least 5MB/s DL speeds (the max of my connection).  The only downside to ACD is the fact that sometimes the files have the wrong timestamps (which can quickly be fixed by simply coping over the file information only) or the wrong filesize (which is a lot more annoying), but other than that everything seems to work just fine, including mass restoring of files.

I asked Crashplan themselves about it, and they said when you switch servers you tend to get assigned to a new one, and as load fills up, speeds go down. They said they consider 1 - 3 Mbps a normal average for most people on there, and it isn't an issue because it's a shared service."

I went with a different model that is slightly less dense (3-in-2 compared to the 5-in-3 that he linked) but mine are trayless so I can swap a drive in under 10 seconds easy.  I have been using these since 2008:  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NMAZU0  I'm running them in an ancient SuperMicro SC750 case that has 6 5.25"" bays, so that gives me 9 3.5"" hotswap trayless bays that I'm working with.  The drawback is the fan(s) on the back.  They fail every couple years and require removing the bay from the case and disassembling it to swap them.  If they fail and you don't notice, you might lose HDs due to the heat.  The ones I use have 2 tiny fans and I didn't notice when one failed, so eventually a second one failed too ... and I lost 2 disks in my array on the same day.  :(  I noticed the bay that Reset_Assured linked has only 1 bigger fan, and that makes me nervous.  I check mine regularly now, and with 2 I at least have a chance to notice before they both die.  Also, FYI the bay I bought is one of those products that seems to be sold under a bunch of brand names but are all clearly identical hardware.  I also mixed in some Kingwin KF-3000-BK bays and they're absolutely identical on the front, but have a slightly different connector arrangement on the back.

DataHoarder,3ddkod,BloodyIron,3,Wed Jul 15 16:46:02 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately not, I was hoping they'd go on sale but it's seeming unlikely. A bunch of external drives are going on sale, great prices but sadly no 4TB sales."
DataHoarder,3ddkod,Y0tsuya,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:13:56 2015 UTC,I'd advise against molex to sata power. Seen a few burn up
DataHoarder,3ddkod,Balmung,8,Wed Jul 15 16:43:33 2015 UTC,"anything can burn up, the adapters don't have any ICs or resisters in them, so from a technical standpoint they are safe. the likely cause was either a faulty PSU, or a faulty HDD firmware.  yes, I've seen pics of it too, but I've used molex to sata adapters plenty and haven't seen them go berserk, even on crappy PSUs too."
DataHoarder,3ddkod,BloodyIron,3,Wed Jul 15 16:59:56 2015 UTC,"For me it's not that they burn up, but that the molex contact is often loose so a slight touch would cut power to the drives, which is bad for RAID.  My solution was to make SATA-to-SATA power splitters (need soldering skill)."
DataHoarder,3ddkod,Derpshiz,3,Wed Jul 15 18:52:28 2015 UTC,"That's weird, I've never seen molex have unreliable contact before, and I've been using either connector for about 20 years (obviously not sata for 20 years)."
DataHoarder,3ddkod,BorgDrone,2,Wed Jul 15 18:58:22 2015 UTC,Contacts on Molex power splitters/adapters are not reliable.  Try to wiggle one while your drives are spinning and you may experience a power cut.  I used those a lot before switching to backplanes.

The current LTO-6 2.5TB tapes read/write at 160MByte/s and the upcoming LTO-7 6.4TB (estimated) tapes will have a 300MByte/s+ transfer rate. Now Sony could either use this new technology to fight against LTO or join forces with LTO and share the tech completely. Anyway if Sony achieved such a result I doubt IBM and the others in the LTO Consortium don't have a similar or better tech already in the labs....  However I doubt we will see any products using this maximum density for quite some years.  They have the technology yes, but I don't think Sony would just market it now against LTO at similar prices in the enterprise market.  Otherwise LTO would have to speed up and release something comparable in no more than a couple years or no one would keep buying their products if a 185TB Sony tape drive and media were available with LTO stuck at ""only"" 6.4TB..."

I am looking for a solution that I can add any drive to, remove any drive and use it in a separate setup.  tRAID looked more mature than RAID-F.  Am I wrong for thinking that?!  Table Comparsion of tRAID vs RAID-F"
DataHoarder,3dag79,techmattr,2,Wed Jul 15 02:44:41 2015 UTC,"So you can add drives with data on them to both types and pull those drives from the array/pool and read the data via it's native original file system. So if you have a NTFS drive full of movies, add it to the array, then later remove it from the array you can still read it from any machine that is NTFS compatible.   RAID-F was the original product. I can't say one is more mature than the other but RAID-F has been around longer. It's a simpler snapshot method. It's ideal for media servers where you'll copy a bunch of movies/tv shows to it and the data remains static. If you had some shared financial spreadsheets or something that were constantly being written to then RAID-F wouldn't be a great solution.  RAID-F is much more flexible and in my opinion tRAID should only be considered if you need real time parity. For my music, movies and tv I use a RAID-F pooled volume and rely only on parity and the fact that if I'm unable to recover from a drive failure I'll only lose the data on that drive. I keep some critical data on there as well but I replicate it to a Synology and my workstation. The Synology syncs with a remote Synology and backs up to Glacier. My workstation backs up to CrashPlan.   I've found that keeping a page file at least 1GB per TB on a SSD greatly increases verify and validate jobs as well as reduces the number of failures. I do still occasionally get a failure when Plex holds a lock on a file though."

What I want is a program that will download podcasts to a directory and organize them, plex would then be set up to read that directory.  The problem I am running into is that a lot of podcast downloading programs will keep up to a max of 1000 episodes. While I can manually move episodes to keep them safe from deletion I would prefer to not have to worry about it in the first place."
DataHoarder,3cz73c,webtwopointno,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:41:50 2015 UTC,I'm not into podcasts... but surely the problem isn't just downloading them. That's like 10 lines of perl code tossed into a crontab.
DataHoarder,3cz73c,NoMoreNicksLeft,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:46:20 2015 UTC,"Downloading is easyish. The programs work by submitting the rss info and it downloads current ones and when a new episode come out it downloads that too. Just have a bunch of rss feeds and urls liked to it and one program automates retrieving all of them.  The problem is that the more popular programs have an episode cap. So say I tell it to download Ted Talks over the weekend when I am working my second job. As there are more than 1000 episodes it will download those first 1000 then when it goes to download episode 1001 it auto deletes episode 1 to make room. And that is where the problem lays.  As I work two jobs and leave my system to basically auto hoard while I am out of the house, I don't have a whole lot of time to manually manage that. I could manually move episodes from a directory to another to keep them safe but if something comes up they get deleted and I have to manually redownload them. Bit of a pain really.  As for perl scripts. I am a recovering windows user. I am just now venturing outside that world."

DataHoarder,3cw35y,Ratzkull,9,Sat Jul 11 17:31:37 2015 UTC,"The price for the 4TB WD and HGST were about the same, with HGST being a little more expensive (at the time of my purchase). The biggest reason I decided to go with the HGSTs is because they appear to consistently have a lower failure rate. None of my data is even remotely mission critical, I just wanted to build the most stable setup possible. The other reason was that I was hoping to actually utilize the speed bump of the HGSTs to the advantage of my setup (not sure if I have really achieved that yet?) .  The last reason is because I have a remote nas (it's an old linksys nas that I will keep at my sisters) which I am going to use to back up this nas (my sister gets plex and I get a backup system!). That old nas has WD reds so I figured diversifying couldn't be a bad thing."

I prefer not to have my wardrobe filled with lots of servers so i prefer to use dedi/colo and VPSes.  So far with Transip i'm able to just add on extra 2TB for only 10€ more/month which i consider to be fairly ok. 10TB for ~50€ and then the actual vps for 10€, so all in all i can pay 60€/month for a vps with 10TB storage.  Previously i had used a dedi server with OVH but this turns out to be much cheaper so i'm going to give them a try and if it turns out they are stable in the lon-run i'm going to rsync all my stuff from my OVH box to the Transip VPS.

Also, many of their customers complained of DOA drives (probably due to bad packaging). The reason I'm obsessing about packaging is because I worked in the drive industry for 15 years and drive packaging and handling were key to quality and reliability.    I buy all my drives from a local store that receives them in bulk shipped in the original manufacturer boxes of 20 drives. Of the 16 4TB NAS drives in my system I haven't had a single problem."

Or specific examples.      At best, everything I can find suggests that they're within 10% of each other --- which is nowhere close to the 2-orders of magnitude you describe.  The biggest 2 differences between enterprise drives and consumer drives is:   The manufacturers promise that the exact same model will be available for a longer period of time, so you can feel safe buying a storage array with a particular drive certified for it.  The warranty periods on the enterprise drives tend to match or exceed the tax laws for depreciation, so companies can have extremely predictable forecasts of costs.   Enterprise drives are not in general more reliable, with some studies showing higher failure rates in enterprise drives.  This makes sense when you consider that due to the longer product lifecycle, the enterprise drives are typically running a slightly older technology."
DataHoarder,3cofef,ser_rhaegar,11,Fri Jul 10 10:49:37 2015 UTC,Says so right on the spec sheet  Consumer <1 in 1014 http://www.wdc.com/wdproducts/library/SpecSheet/ENG/2879-800002.pdf  Enterprise <1 in 1016 http://www.wdc.com/wdproducts/library/SpecSheet/ENG/2879-771444.pdf  Now they of course cost a lot more and isn't necessarily magnitudes better so like backblaze/Google/Facebook are able to buy tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of consumer drives and come out ahead. Smaller businesses can't and it's better to go the generally more reliable enterprise.

I personally wouldn't buy enterprise drives as I don't think they are worth it, but for a business I think of it more as insurance against what if. Plus many businesses use enterprise solutions like EMC and NetApp, which for support would require enterprise drives anyways so not like they have a choice."

DataHoarder,3cofef,fryfrog,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:51:50 2015 UTC,The specs actually say less than.   So a RED says less than 1 in 1014. If your RED is operating at 1 in 1016 it's technically less than 1 in 1014.   In my experience consumer driver experience nowhere remotely close to 1 in 1014.
DataHoarder,3cofef,red_wizard,2,Thu Jul 9 20:54:38 2015 UTC,"Got to agree. I'd use RAID-5 for up to 4 drives, then I'd go for RAID-6 or something better."
DataHoarder,3cofef,fryfrog,-1,Fri Jul 10 02:04:42 2015 UTC,Personally I prefer RAID-10 for my needs. I like the increased redundancy and performance (with a cost of storage space). Also rebuild times are very very quick.
DataHoarder,3cofef,Balmung,7,Thu Jul 9 16:22:20 2015 UTC,"Raid 10 doesn't exactly save you from this situation, you're only guaranteed a single disk failure of redundancy. If the second failure happens to be the pair to the one that failed, you're sunk. The chance gets lower and lower as you add more disks, but it never goes away. And of course, like you said the rebuild is faster so your vulnerability window is smaller.  If you want guaranteed redundancy, you need 3 way mirrors (if you like the raid10 style) or raid6. Or ZFS's raidz2 or raidz3."
DataHoarder,3cofef,fryfrog,3,Thu Jul 9 15:21:13 2015 UTC,Or you can add a hot spare to the pool
DataHoarder,3cofef,Balmung,6,Thu Jul 9 16:32:20 2015 UTC,"If you're throwing in a hotspare, you might as well go to raid6. Unless you're already at raid6, since there isn't a raid7. If you throw a hotspare into a raid5, all you gain is quicker replacement. It still takes X hours to sync it in, during which you're vulnerable to another failure. Better to be protected from failure during that window instead."
DataHoarder,3cofef,Y0tsuya,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:37:33 2015 UTC,"If by RAID7 you mean triple parity then it is a thing, ZFS has a triple parity RAIDZ3."

DataHoarder,3cofef,XYrZbest,-1,Thu Jul 9 19:46:56 2015 UTC,I never understood the purpose of hot spares.  Back when RAID6 wasn't so readily available maybe it was useful.  But not now.
DataHoarder,3cofef,stankbucket,3,Thu Jul 9 20:01:11 2015 UTC,I believe it makes you be able to lose essentially 3 drives but since raid 7 isn't a thing it makes it like a raid 6 + 1 extra drive I don't understand why you can't set how ever many drives you want to be able to lossed
DataHoarder,3cofef,fryfrog,2,Thu Jul 9 17:25:51 2015 UTC,"Not really, a hot spare is literally just a spare sitting there spinning (or spun down, I guess), waiting to be slotted in when a disk fails. Once a disk fails, it gets slotted in and the rebuild starts. It is the same as you changing a disk when one goes bad, except it happens right then instead of when you have a chance.  If you can, using a hot spare to increase the raid level is better. Then, just keep a cold spare handy in the case of a failure. If you can't for some reason, then it is your only choice if you need it. I'd personally keep it powered off, a cold spare, assuming you know you can catch a disk failure in a reasonable amount of time."
DataHoarder,3cofef,angrymonkeyz,2,Thu Jul 9 17:34:51 2015 UTC,I get that it needs to be rebuilt but it basically makes it another drive now if 3 die at once then you're screwed because one of them needs to be used to rebuilt
DataHoarder,3cofef,dokumentamarble,2,Thu Jul 9 17:37:33 2015 UTC,"Hot spares are great when they can be shared across arrays. You have 3 RAID5 arrays which each get access to the spare. Whoever needs it first takes it and by the time you even check the server your rebuild might already be done. Also, hot spares can be kept cold which will probably make them less likely to fail as soon."
DataHoarder,3cofef,fryfrog,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:39:29 2015 UTC,"I'd almost never use one personally, but can see some niche rolls where it could be useful. If your system is in a datacenter or it could be days before you could do the swap out, a hot spare isn't crazy. But it'd be silly to use a hot spare instead of increasing your raid level."

DataHoarder,3cofef,_java_csharp_cpp_c,4,Thu Jul 9 16:54:19 2015 UTC,"As far as I know, raid6 is the best you can get from md and btrfs. With md, you could throw in a hot spare and have raid6 + a little extra safety. I don't know of any plans to do higher levels in btrfs.  As far as I know, the only thing offering 3 disks of parity is zfs's raidz3. Maybe one of the flexraid / unraid / whatever offerings has that? I think I'd be okay with raid6 in md or btrfs (when it is considered stable and tested), but would probably limit pool / array size to something reasonable."
DataHoarder,3cofef,soontobekate,2,Thu Jul 9 17:31:56 2015 UTC,what about my 8 drive raid6 with 2 drives down?  I put in my 1 spare drive and 2 more failed in the rebuild.  Fuck you seagate.
DataHoarder,3cofef,MrDOS,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:34:56 2015 UTC,Unfortunately there is no such thing as a 100% bullet proof system to bundle a bunch of disks into one group/pool/array/etc.  :(
DataHoarder,3cofef,seizedengine,2,Fri Jul 10 00:14:21 2015 UTC,"There is, it's just not cost effective. I'd guess at some point of adding drives in RAID 1 you'd get to a point where there's statistically zero chance of having every remaining drive fail during rebuild, and I'd guess that number would be relatively low, like under 10. So, if you REALLY want ""100%"" you could just have like a 5-way mirror on RAID 1 and you're almost guaranteed to not have all the remaining drives fail during a rebuilt.  Unless you buy Seagate."

DataHoarder,3cofef,mikelj,5,Thu Jul 9 15:04:03 2015 UTC,"I have been monitoring tape for the last couple years and it really hasn't been worth it unless you're like 50+TB. It's been 6 months since I looked though, but the tape drive is always the problem as they are so expensive even used.  For 12TB you could easily just buy a small case with cheapest components you could get and 4 4TB drives and make a RAID5 of that. This is just a backup so it shouldn't need RAID6, but you could if you wanted."
DataHoarder,3cofef,Rawlsdeep,4,Thu Jul 9 17:23:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's the conclusion I've come to. I looked at something like Amazon Glacier as well. While it's very inexpensive to store large amounts of data, it is quite expensive to pull data in case of a failure ($0.09/GB). Pulling 10TB would cost almost $1000. For that price I would just buy a bunch of hard drives, as you suggested."
DataHoarder,3cofef,_java_csharp_cpp_c,6,Thu Jul 9 19:42:28 2015 UTC,Glacier gets pretty expensive when you're storing multiple TB of data even not considering needing to restore. It's $10.24 per month per TB. So 6TB would cost $737.28 per year just to store. You could build a small NAS and come out ahead in under 2 years.  It is aimed a businesses though.

DataHoarder,3cofef,eleitl,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:26:31 2015 UTC,Well I mean I strongly believe in having a backup in general no matter what sort of disk layout you are using.  I think a backup should come before you think about a RAID.  RAID is mainly concerned with improving performance mainly through striping and improving uptime through redundancy of course.  But there are so many other failures and things that can go wrong that RAID doesn't do anything to address and that's where the backup comes in.

Today I would go RAID6 without hesitating.   I need to re-do the array from scratch with new drives next time I need to expand, since I can't fit more drives into my case. I'll probably be using 4TB or 6TB drives in RAID6 then."
DataHoarder,3cofef,fryfrog,8,Thu Jul 9 15:01:02 2015 UTC,"You're using md, you can literally migrate to raid6 by adding another disk and running a command. Just wait until this rebuild finishes."
DataHoarder,3cofef,eleitl,9,Thu Jul 9 15:08:38 2015 UTC,"RAID5 is fine for a homelab. You're not a business, it's not going to cost you thousands if the array goes down. Any important data that cannot be replaced should be backed up, regardless of the situation you're in.  You're more likely to care about the usable space per £ than data integrity. Drives don't fail that often."
DataHoarder,3cofef,evemanufacturetool,5,Thu Jul 9 16:34:31 2015 UTC,Novice hoarder here. Why not RAID5?
DataHoarder,3cofef,eleitl,13,Thu Jul 9 15:57:02 2015 UTC,"Because people keep repeating what they hear without knowing why.  Raid 5 is bad because you can only tolerate one hard disk failure. If another one fails during rebuild, your whole array is gone. You can reduce the risk by splitting up your big array into smaller ones, so that if the rebuild fails you only lose some arrays and not all.  However, Raid 5 has some advantages:    write performance is better than Raid 6 You have more usable storage (you only lose the size of one disk)   I personally use Raid 5 with 4 * 1 TB disks because I rather need storage than increased redundancy. My rebuild time doesn't take that long.   People are saying Raid 5 is bad because if you have money (like companies do), there are better ways. However, if you are on a budget, I think Raid 5 is fine. You just need to be aware of the disadvantages.  You can get more info here: http://www.prepressure.com/library/technology/raid"

Advanced Capacity Expansion. Mirror splitting and recombining in offline mode. Drive Erase. Performance optimization for video on demand.   Maybe this has changed with newer controllers.

DataHoarder,3cofef,XYrZbest,7,Fri Jul 10 06:25:45 2015 UTC,Why? Are you going to spout some nonsense about UREs and how you're always going to get a failure above a certain array size?
DataHoarder,3cofef,cgimusic,9,Fri Jul 10 17:04:58 2015 UTC,"I've literally never seen an URE and IIRC, the dude that wrote the article was shown to have just completely misunderstood how that shit is rated by the drive makers.  I think a second failure during a rebuild is more likely, not because the disks are going to URE or have a higher chance of failure during a big read... but more because if one has failed, you're probably a bit into the age of the disks and others are closing in on their end of life too.  So raid6 or raidz2/3! :)"

According to SuperMicro's site, that case supports E-ATX boards. supermicro source  I was under the impression with the psu's, they aren't going to be sucking down any more power than if it was a 500w. The drives and board are only going to use so much. Am I off there?  So this is a picture of the backplane. here Would I be able to plug the avoton's sata ports directly into those? They look slightly different than what I've seen and my googling is failing me."
DataHoarder,3cqqwm,audio_pile,2,Fri Jul 10 03:34:07 2015 UTC,Straight up SATA. Thats good given your mobo.  As for power? Personal example here. One of my servers is a A1SAM-2550F (4core). On the 950w corsair I use for testing the idle wattage on my NAS was almost double that of the 450w that I used in the end. Prob a extreme example. Ob. power supply quality/specs makes things vary. But the whole point of those avotons is tossing down a cool/compact/low power nas/server. You could end up with zero power savings VS a 1150 solution. Might as well go with an asrock e3c224d4i-14s + i3 or something then.

I'm guessing with those redundant power supplies, they would be hard to replace with lower wattage versions.

As buzzookabee said you can do incremental, but yes that would require you to keep the initial full and all incrementals to be able to restore.

I went over it in my head and it seems that having the master filesystem + snapshots in one location, and a rsync of all the files in a second location is probably as good as it's going to get.

You do not need 32GB of RAM, unless you're going to be running a proverbial shit-load of VMs.  Lose half the RAM, and buy another SSD and use it in a btrfs pool - faster and you've got redundancy too.    If you're not overclocking (which isn't a good plan on your server), then get the non-K CPU, too.  I'm also not sure on your motherboard choice.  I have that same board in my gaming rig, and it's great for that, but I think it's a bit wasted for an UnRAID box.  A cheaper board and some sort of Marvell-based SATA card is probably cheaper.  There's some folks on the UnRAID forum have had issues with that board too.  I run UnRAID on a Xeon E3-1225v3 on a cheap MSI B85 board with 16GB and I've got 6 Dockers and 2 VMs running.  It doesn't even use half my RAM.  I have 2x5TB data drives, a 6TB parity, and 2x500GB BX100 for my cache pool.  It works great."

So conceivably if the conditions for the 1st rule aren't met, the 2nd rule takes effect.

DataHoarder,3cj7ah,drHz14,10,Wed Jul 8 09:33:49 2015 UTC,"You should have some concern.   You have a LOT of reallocated sectors. View the raw values in Dec rather than Hex to see how many. I believe you have about 15k.   A fresh drive with no reallocated sectors will show 100 under 'current' and it will gradually go down as sectors are reallocated. When it reaches the threshold of 36 it means there are no more spare sectors left.   A drive with reallocated sectors is not necessarily bad - spare sectors exist for a reason. Sometimes a drive can have a few and then continue to work fine for many years. But there is a strong correlation with reallocated sectors and 'bad drives'. To have so many - I believe 15k but I don't have time to double check - it's indicative of something bad going on inside your drive. A head crash may have caused some debris, or the platters may be defective or something of that nature.   I would take the drive out of active usage and spend a week writing data to it, reading it back, formatting it, etc. At least 5 complete read/write operations over the entire disk to flush out bad sectors and try to get a true picture of the drive health."
DataHoarder,3cj7ah,snrrub,3,Wed Jul 8 10:52:53 2015 UTC,"Thanks, Just did the conversion, and if I did it right the reallocated count is 14496 (so you were pretty much spot on).  Luckily there isn't much of importance on this drive, but this is the fourth (maybe fifth) drive I've had do this in the last 3 months :( (mix of WD and Seagate).   I'm guessing it's just a case of old age, but very frustrating none the less. Can't afford to replace the entire array, so keep replacing drives one by one, and feels like I'm spending more in the long run than stepping up a level in capacity. :(   would be good to proactively manage smart stats, but my level of sophistication at the moment is if it gets anything other than a full set of green lights, it gets taken out of the main array. probably a good thing judging by comments below...?"

I realized I had a problem when my solution to figuring out what to copy over to my new computer was to just copy my entire C:/ drive and put it on an external. I still have that backup. It's messy as crap, but it has a lot of old stuff I don't want to lose.  I recently made some backups of the more important bits, and put them in a more accessible place.  300GB isn't all that much compared to some people here.

DataHoarder,3cjd4z,waywardspooky,8,Wed Jul 8 10:56:17 2015 UTC,"There should be three SAS SFF-8087 ports on that backplane. A group of two close together (these are what you plug into the SAS controller) towards the middle of the backplane and a single port off to the side (for SAS Expansion to another chassis, ignore this unless you have another chassis).   I own one of these units myself, and depending on which model you have (I had a R900B) that backplane is not suited for 4TB disks. I know, that sounds stupid, but I had a problem with it myself, it works fine for 24x2TB drives, but when I plugged 3TB drives into it, only half the drives were available. I started looking at ebay listings and one vendor had a disclaimer specifically about this on his sale, so I contacted him to ask because I couldn't find any corroborating evidence through google. He was very informative and said that the reason he puts that disclaimer on his sales is because he worked a large order for these exact servers and had like a 90% backplane failure rate with drives >2TB. He told me that backplane model ""BPN-SAS2-846EL1"" which comes with the R1200B model works fine with >2TB drives, so I bought one off him (drop in replacement) and it worked fine. I asked him if he thought backplane firmware could be the issue, and he told me that he had updated the backplane firmwares (along with everything else) during his testing phase and he said it did not appear to fix anything. Who knows though, you might get lucky.   I ended up replacing the included adaptec raid controller with a M1015/ITmode HBA and it works fine. I also plan to replace the dual PSU's (which are quite loud, even when the server is off) with a single Zippy 720w psu.   All in all, it would have been a great deal if the included backplane didn't need to be replaced, and the PSU's weren't jet engine loud, so after replacing those parts, it's just a so-so deal that loses a little shine, but it does work. If I were to do it again, I'd spend the extra cash upfront and buy the R1200B model which has the correct backplane for >2TB disks, and quieter PSU's, or build a Norco 4224 from scratch."

DataHoarder,3cjd4z,reth1000,2,Wed Jul 8 13:02:40 2015 UTC,"Not sure if this helps, but I recently purchased a Supermicro CSE-846BE16-R920B case.  Not sure of the differences between mine and yours.  I had to buy the case that had the expander backplane though, the first one I was considering didn't have a built in expander and required a more powerful HBA card as a result.  Anyway, my backplane has about 5 connectors on it.  I have a single LSI  9211-4I HBA and that just goes to the connector on the farthest right (looking from the front of the case where the hard drives are.)  It works completely fine, can see all 24 drives no problems.  The issue I encountered is that these LSI cards don't like non-enterprise drives.  My 6TB WD Reds sneaked through somehow, but when I put random 4TB drives, Seagate Barracudas, and ones I'd shucked out of external cases in, it was flaky.  In the end I just upgraded everything to WD Reds and no problems.  EDIT : When you get it working it's awesome  :  main           123T  78.4T  44.8T         -     5%    63%  1.00x  ONLINE  /mnt"

DataHoarder,3cjd4z,SirMaster,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:51:21 2015 UTC,"So my first vdev of 8 drives was 8x6TB WD Red.  That was recognised every single time I rebooted (probably 50+ times when I was getting the damn thing to work.)  The second vdev was 2x6TB WD Reds, 2x4TB WD Red, a 5TB Seagate Enterprise, and 3 random other 4TB drives.  It just hung at the LSI prompt.  I switched two of the drives around, and it worked.  Then I rebooted and it hung for a few minutes.  Spoke to the guy I bought the chassis off on the phone and apparently they just are simply flaky with some non-enterprise drives.  I didn't do enough testing to pinpoint what was going on, I just didn't want to risk losing my data because I couldn't get the system to recognise the drives after a reboot.  So after that I just did some reconfiguring and bought some more 6TB drives, just to eliminate the uncertainty.  You may want to do some more testing than I did.  The 6TB drives use a different version of the WD NAS Software than the 4TB drives (the version is printed on the label).  That may be  something to do with it.  Anyway, you're probably ok with NAS-specific drives, just make sure you test it extensively.  The fact it was failing to boot like that with certain combinations of drives is quite worrying.  I just couldn't pinpoint which drive was failing."

DataHoarder,3cfiln,das_ape,20,Wed Jul 8 01:48:19 2015 UTC,Not exactly what your concerns are but for me I worry about privacy. Some of the basics I would suggest are running an open source router (dd wrt or pfsense) and locking it down. Doing things like turning off upnp and having a secure Wi-Fi password help a lot. If you can run a secured browser even better.   I also encrypt all my backups and run most my web traffic through a VPN.  Check out https://www.privacytools.io if you want more info.  Or you could just stockpile porn for when the world's servers blow up and sell for a profit. :)
DataHoarder,3cfiln,TwentyYearsAgo,4,Tue Jul 7 16:35:16 2015 UTC,"Any advice, or maybe even a config for pfSense? It kills all my non-VPN traffic (speedwise) when I use Snort."
DataHoarder,3cfiln,das_ape,4,Tue Jul 7 18:13:24 2015 UTC,"Pfsense can be difficult at best and getting a VPN setup on it is even worse. However, once you have it set up you RARELY need to touch it again. OpenVPN is pretty awesome and reliable and there are TONS of guides out there. I'd start there if you wanted to go with Pfsense.   DDWRT is another great option if you don't want to dive head first into pfsense or feel like running a full on PC for a router like I used to do. My only word of advice with DDWRT is to get a router that is fairly powerful. I've been running it on a Buffalo N600 for a few months and even with VPN traffic it's pretty smooth.   Hope that helped a little. If you have more questions I'd be happy to answer."

But if it's authoritarianism we run into, you have to worry more about retention, when the police are knocking down doors and looking through all your shit. If it's a more electronic form of authoritarian power, the physical device is fine, but encrypting and hiding data from web snooping is the issue.  What if it's mass migration? Then you're worrying about portability. Natural disasters on a large enough scale would demand that the storage device itself be resilient in a way that most of us can't afford.  It's the sort of stuff futurists and similar prognosticators could (and likely do) spend forever thinking about. But given the breadth of potential trouble, I'm at a loss for what the average hoarder can do."

DataHoarder,3chkc1,haz1919,2,Tue Jul 7 23:31:07 2015 UTC,"I would assume yes. I see no reason they would not. I am currently running at WDEX4 with non WD Red Drives. Hell, I am not even using WD drives in it. I am using a mix-match of previous externals and internals ranging from Seagate to Toshiba.  I have no first hand knowledge of the WDEX4100 specifically though. WD does have fairly decent customer service phone support (usually) you could call and ask, but if they give you an honest answer regarding non WD drives I wouldn't know.   Any specific reason you are looking at the EX4100? I know this isn't the exact same model, but my EX4 is something I doubt I would suggest others purchase. I have had multiple problems.  It is slow, clunky, terrible web interface with limitations everywhere and not maintained well by WD on their website support/forums. However, it does its job and hasn't failed. Just make sure you investigate thoroughly in the forums and community whether or not it is actually what it claims to be. Again, I am not trying to scare you into something else, just advising you of my experience with WDEX4."
DataHoarder,3chkc1,Braelvenae,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:52:53 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for the very informative and thoughtful post.  I plan on calling WD tomorrow when they open to confirm. Once I read that it only officially supports the red drives, I thought that is all they would say, but you are right, I might get an honest customer service rep. Why sell the diskless version, right?  The new one has been pretty well reviewed from what I have read. Also, I've always wanted a NAS and this model is able to be used as a ""Plex Server"". I'm not sure if you are aware of plex, but it is amazing software that is used to stream home media.  I already had 3, 3tb hard drives of media filled up and I wanted to be able to access it all at one time with a NAS. Also, the reviews say that the processor speed is much improved and there is 2GB of RAM, as well.  Amazon.com and a google search for ""EX4100 reviews"", should lead you to the reviews I read or watched.  Thanks again and let me know if you have any further thoughts, based on this response."
DataHoarder,3chkc1,Braelvenae,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:31:19 2015 UTC,I am glad to hear that this one has gotten better reviews and is able to become a Plex Server.

DataHoarder,3chkc1,nomofica,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:34:21 2015 UTC,"Yes. I currently use a Seagate 3TB drive in my EX2 that works along side a WD Red 4TB quite swimmingly (although I plan to eventually upgrade to another WD Red 4TB for RAID). As far as I'm aware the EX4 drive compatibility is a lot better than the EX2 (according to this thread from 2014 there are no blacklisted drives) so you should be able to JBOD them without issue.  That being said, I would not recommend a WD NAS. Like it's already been said, they're slow and clunky. My EX2 had a firmware update that failed and somehow completely corrupted the drives and my entire movie and music library was gone no matter what I did to try and recover it. Spend the money on something better; if you choose to use a closed-system solution, go with QNAP or Synology. I've never used Drobo but I've heard great things about them too, aside from the price."
DataHoarder,3cf7b0,RoboYoshi,3,Tue Jul 7 13:11:16 2015 UTC,Nice. As a python programmer I may give you a tip for further revisions of this script. Right now it won't work on Windows because you use subprocess call to wget which doesn't exist there. Also you make later on unneeded file. You may want to change subprocess call to urllib and throw page content as return of function and pass it to xml parser function as an argument.  I could totally do this for you in 5 minutes but you may as well do it yourself if you want. For self learning. I'm just giving a tip.

Since I usually start with a single file by an author, all the files tend to be ""last name, first name - article title [year published][optional keywords, misc info]"". If I have a number on the same subject (e.g., if I was researching theory papers on Bronte's Tenant of Wildfell Hall) then they tend to get their own folder that's something like ""[# of articles] subject matter [authors' last name separated by commas]"". And yes, I actually use brackets.

It is important to have a plan about how you intend to use tags so you aren't labelling articles with permutations of the same tag. Like decide to always use ""science"" instead of sometimes using Science, Sci, sci, scientific, science articles, etc.  I think it is also a good idea to have each tag be short and discrete. If you find yourself using tags like ""science article"" you should probably divide it into two tags ""science"" and ""article"" referring to its topic and its type."

I can say to stay away from the WD Green's as well. Red's are generally good drives but they are designed for heavy I/O in the file server, not necessarily for sitting in a safety deposit box.  However, the main reason for my reply is to suggest not using drag and drop but rather an actual back up solution with deduplication and other features. This should speed up your backups as well as cause less wear on the drive. Check out Duplicati. Crashplan would even work well in this case."

DataHoarder,3cby07,SirMaster,3,Mon Jul 6 22:21:49 2015 UTC,I can't find the original post but it was a couple months ago. I'll do some digging later on to see if I can find it.

DataHoarder,3cby07,bahwhateverr,4,Mon Jul 6 23:17:41 2015 UTC,That article mentions the largest models as 256GB which if it's priced comparably to a HDD would be about $50.  http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16822136771  I've already seen 240-250GB SSDs on sale for $70-80 so it's not that significant of a reduction.   It says nothing about 1TB or 2TB SSD being anywhere near $70-80 though which would be like a 6-10x price reduction whereas I believe they are talking more about a 0.5x price reduction at most.

Well unfortunately mission critical HDD doesn't really mean anything to consumers and that those easily cost 3x+ more than plain consumer HDDs.

I use basically 5GB for my OS, 8GB for swap, and 1GB for log files. That's it, what on earth are you guys storing?  Don't get me wrong, I understand why SSDs are useful in other environments such as databases/things that need random reads, but, I'm not hosting databases that are 2TB in size, and I doubt you guys are either. I'm just wondering."
DataHoarder,3cby07,BathenBattle,1 point,Tue Jul 7 07:34:45 2015 UTC,"It's a good question. Since a conventional disk array can saturate a 10 gig link, more throughput is kinda pointless for storing your BluRays and whatnot. What I'm excited for SSDs is latency serving small requests. Having all of your storage turn around a single IOP faster means search indexes build faster, copying lots of small files goes faster, basically any synchronous write operation (nfs does this by default) can be crazy faster.  All of that is especially good for virtual machine storage. If I have a bundle of VMs sitting on nfs on ssds, I can now do things like starting all of them up or updating simultaneously without fear of heavy disk thrashing slowing down all of my synchronous write operations.  Lastly, with sufficiently low latency, network resources start to act a lot more like local storage from the perspective of the user. I could feasibility have my entire home or application install directory mounted on many computers from a shared SSD array with little performance penalty. That's exciting."

The whole 1GB per 1TB is total nonsense for ZFS. The more memory the better yes but it will run just fine with 8.  Don't purport a device to be a NAS and then lumber it with other shit like virtualisation. That's terrible system design. If you want a virtualisation platform, install something like Proxmox and have a VM within that handle the sharing of data.  Zed eff ess. Not zee eff ess.  HA! Those drives are more reliable than Seagate? Show me a real world example where there is enough data to be statistically relevant. There aren't any. There are those articles from backblaze but there are so many other factors in their drive lifespan that aren't considered or mentioned. Yes, those HGST drives are good but any manufacturer is just as likely to have drives fail as they are.  ECC memory is important for doing it right but it's not going to cause the loss of all your data if you don't have it any more than if you used mdadm or another software RAID solution.  SSD for caching? Yea, it could be 1/10th of the size and it would still be too much. ZFS doesn't need or want a lot of caching space unless you're using it as the L2ARC.  Gold PSU? Yea but it's 650W. You have 10 HDDs and a very low power motherboard. At maximum load, that's going to be around 130W, probably 50W idle. There's no way that PSU is going to be running at any sensible, efficient levels. Never mind the nonsense mentioned about ""50, 60 or even 70% load"". You aren't even going to get close to that.

DataHoarder,3cd6m9,sanders54,1 point,Tue Jul 7 10:52:39 2015 UTC,"It depends though. You can't use a HP p410i controller on a H700 array for example, because the controllers do some things differently.

DataHoarder,3caien,speckz,4,Mon Jul 6 11:32:34 2015 UTC,"Is MHDDFS meaningfully different from LVM? It looks like you can toggle it off an on with an existing file system in place rather than making LVM physical volumes, which I guess means it can survive a drive failure (albeit losing all files on that drive) whereas LVM gets angry about that and at least requires you to tell it the drive failed.   Overall it seems like a much less stable codebase to do pretty much the same stuff."
DataHoarder,3caien,ttk2,2,Mon Jul 6 12:11:53 2015 UTC,"Now that you mention it, after reading a fairly in depth description of MHDDFS, LVM is the way to go.  If a file becomes too big to fit on one disk due to a write operation, it copies the entire file over to the other disk, rather than just putting the next block on the next disk.  The only real advantage to this is that it works on the filesystem layer instead of the block layer meaning that it can work on networked mounts seamlessly and doesn't require root."
DataHoarder,3caien,hi117,3,Mon Jul 6 12:45:52 2015 UTC,"The good thing about the large file move policy is if your computer system dies, you can still just mount your 3 hard drives as simple file systems and recover all of your files.  With something like LVM, you might need to do more complex recovery schemes."
DataHoarder,3caien,elai,3,Tue Jul 7 04:59:01 2015 UTC,"The author compares apples with bananas - RAID is used for entirely different purposes than MHDDFS. RAID works on a block level, MHDDFS works on top of file systems. MHDDFS is used in combination with RAID, it's certainly no replacement for it.  The article claims that this is a solution for easily expandable storage and redundancy, but further along says himself that it provides no redundancy -> ???  It's not that easily expandable either: If you want to extend your big MHDDFS volume and add a new one, where does that come from? While MHDDFS might be easy to configure, it requires configuring the underlying storage first. So it doesn't make configuration easier, it just adds another layer on top of the existing ones.  In some special cases running MHDDFS surely is useful, but for the author's purposes (running a NAS with SATA or SAS drives plugged into it) he might as well run ZFS. It's even easier to expand a ZFS volume, from plugging in the disk to having the space available it's one single command -> sudo zpool add poolname newdrive. That is even easier and provides redundancy if required."
DataHoarder,3caien,xphx,3,Tue Jul 7 09:54:43 2015 UTC,"I have been running MHDDFS on my NAS for nearly 3 years now and I absolutely love it. I have 4 copies of my data (the NAS and 3 backups - 2 onsite (hot and cold) and 1 offside) so losing a drive is no big deal at all. If the pool still has enough space I can just restore immediately. If not, I replace the drive then restore. But the remainder of my data is still fully accessible while I wait for the new drive and the restore to finish.  I really don't lose any benefits of having RAID and I can mix and match my drives and not lose any space to parity."
DataHoarder,3caien,WDKevin,4,Mon Jul 6 12:06:37 2015 UTC,"Depending on the amount of data you're storing then no, you won't miss anything from RAID. When you start getting in to multiple-TB territory, having multiple copies of data starts becoming problematic and/or expensive.  It doesn't afford any protection on disks failing which is what RAID is designed for. If you lose a disk, you lose the data on it and it's up to you to work out how to restore it."
DataHoarder,3caien,evemanufacturetool,2,Mon Jul 6 13:08:17 2015 UTC,"Right, but for my use case restoring it is not a big deal. Most of my data is media but only my important/personal files are backed up. I don't care if I lose any movies, TV shows or music. I can download it again if need be. The majority of what I have is available to stream anyway.  By itself it certainly has it's flaws. But if you have it paired with good backups then it can be very nice."

DataHoarder,3caien,drashna,3,Mon Jul 6 22:56:55 2015 UTC,I prefer AUFS as it has round-robin options for writing files so they are spread evenly across drives and not filling one and then moving to the next.

DataHoarder,3c8tvm,mirdagle,6,Sun Jul 5 23:52:11 2015 UTC,FlexRaid can do unlimited parity. But not sure why you would need that many parity drives.  For me 6+ parity drives would be for like 60+ data drives. I'm running now on 6 data / 1 parity.
DataHoarder,3c8tvm,ardmax1,2,Mon Jul 6 00:42:00 2015 UTC,With tRaid? I've been using Felxraids tRaid for a few years now and always been under the impression 2 parity drives was the maximum.

DataHoarder,3c8tvm,MonsterMufffin,4,Mon Jul 6 10:29:52 2015 UTC,I would suggest splitting Raid groups up before you start hitting the need for 6 parity drives...
DataHoarder,3c8tvm,PBI325,2,Mon Jul 6 01:36:47 2015 UTC,"I don't understand what you mean. Please explain. Afraid I'm a bit dum-dum today. Do you mean like how it's recommended in the Snapraid FAQ to ""stay with one parity disk (RAID5) with up to four data disks, and then using one parity disk for each group of seven data disks""?"
DataHoarder,3c8tvm,PBI325,2,Mon Jul 6 02:13:54 2015 UTC,"It's all good!   In my lab 12 drive pools w/ 2 drive parity is acceptable (10 data, 2 parity). So, when you hit that 6 drives parity you'd be at 36 drives (30 data and 6 parity).   I have no clue what performance would be on something like a 36 drive pool and I'd have no clue how long you'd be in limbo for a reslivering on that pool. What I do know is what performance I should be seeing in a 12 drive Raidz2 (example) and how long a resilver is going to take.   So in reality there nothing inherently wrong with a using those 6 drives parity but performance and rebuild times would be much more predictable with multiple, smaller, pools.   And even though I dont know what performance would be like on the 36 drive pool I can guarantee you that the 3x 12 disk pools will perform better."
DataHoarder,3c8tvm,shottothedome,3,Mon Jul 6 02:34:59 2015 UTC,snapraid doesn't do pools. all drives are individual. Drives rebuild individually as well. no resilvering. so your comments don't apply and are confusing
DataHoarder,3c8tvm,waxo,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:58:29 2015 UTC,"So, Snapraid is telling you to use the following scheme as it is generally safe:   disk01 data disk02 data disk03 data disk04 data disk05 PARITY disk06 data disk07 data disk08 data disk09 data disk10 data disk11 data disk12 data disk13 PARITY disk14 data disk15 data disk16 data disk17 data disk18 data disk19 data disk20 data disk21 PARITY   In this setup there are only 3 parity disks and 4+7+7=18 data disks. You could suffer 3 broken disks (any disks, parity or data) in this ""array"" and still recover/rebuild all data on all 21 disks.  You can imagine that if you really need 6 parity disks, you'd have to have a LOT of disks total in a single server to justify that.  Note that you are of course free to have more parity disks, e.g. 1 parity disk per 3 data disks, for more redundancy. Is this why you are hitting the limit of 6 parity disks?"
DataHoarder,3c8tvm,waxo,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:54:19 2015 UTC,"Yes, for redundancy. No bit rot, bitflips (I would want ECC RAM?) or general loss of data is allowed to occur. I'm thinking 1 parity per 3 data would strike a nice balance between cost and security."
DataHoarder,3c7nmf,peace_suffer,9,Sun Jul 5 17:38:19 2015 UTC,"No. While the processor of the Pi may be able to keep up, the way it's designed will not.

It's also an ARM chip so finding software/packages written for it can be quite a pain.  I would look for an integrated mini-ITX board for your requirements. Something with an Atom on it would be ideal."
DataHoarder,3c7nmf,evemanufacturetool,2,Sun Jul 5 18:36:44 2015 UTC,I didn't know that about the usb bus. I just assumed the networking was a separate bus but alrighty.  Do you have a mini-ITX board or line that you would recommended?

DataHoarder,3c7nmf,Dmelvin,-1,Sun Jul 5 19:29:43 2015 UTC,I believe that they changed this with the Pi2 and gave the Pi a dedicated gigabit network connection that is not on the same chip ans the USB bus.
DataHoarder,3c7nmf,danhm,5,Sun Jul 5 19:42:48 2015 UTC,"Nope, Pi2 still shares a bus. It's a cost-saving thing for them so it probably won't change for a few years at least if at all.   Some of the copycat boards have separate buses, like the Banana Pi."

Even without the H310 I have 8 SATA Ports, I have a few PCI/e Slots to expand (e.g. second NIC). And because the A4-6300 is an APU, I don't even need a graphics card. If I wanted, I could upgrade to 32GB RAM and put in an 8-core.  It doesn't support ECC though, but you won't get to ECC anywhere near this price, with a custom build at least.

DataHoarder,3c7nmf,SlothOfAnarchy,1 point,Mon Jul 6 10:10:41 2015 UTC,"$190usd seems a bit high for a nas. Now I'm wondering why would one opt for a $300usd raid board (found that specific h310 perc for $100usd on ebay, but new was $300usd) instead of a couple sata multiplier cards for 25usd (plus 4usd shipping w/o amazon prime) and set up software raid?  Looking at things today I came across some things like the asrock qc5000m for 55usd. This has an A4-5000 apu on board, add 2x4GB sticks of decent ram, total cost now is $100usd, and that seems like a fairly powerful mini-system. Add a gtx750ti and you could do some decent gaming. Wouldn't something along those lines be fairly sufficient?   Adding in two sata multipliers brings that build's price to $154usd with a total of 14 sata ports. Just would need a psu and enough power connectors. Here's the picoPSU 80w I had in mind, plus a hand full of sata power splitters, bringing new price for build to $199usd plus or minus a few bucks. Next would be the HDDs, which I think I'd go for the WD green drives at 2-4TB a piece. But I'm not for sure there as I haven't researched the latest on HDDs. Which leads to another question: is there much difference between 3.5 and 2.5 drives in a nas environment? What is the best drive today for nas?  Sorry for the multiple questions."
DataHoarder,3c7nmf,SlothOfAnarchy,1 point,Mon Jul 6 06:33:26 2015 UTC,"Here are finished auctions on ebay, which I meant: http://www.ebay.de/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_sacat=0&LH_Complete=1&LH_Sold=1&_nkw=dell+h310&rt=nc&LH_Auction=1  Of course I wouldn't pay $300 for that (bought it used on ebay). And I don't run hardware RAID either. I looked for cards that can be flashed to IT mode, which means they act as stupid HBA and do nothing else (like the IBM M1015, which is often reccomended in this sub). Maybe you don't need the card. You already have 8 6Gb SATA ports on the motherboard.  I never thought of a multiplier card like this...The problem with that is all attached drives would share the bandwidth of one SATA port. If you can live with the bandwidth I guess you can do it. I would guess you won't feel a difference with up to 3 drives per 6Gb port.  Your newegg links don't seem to work for me, but I looked the board up. If that's enough for you, sure. I payed a bit more because I wanted an ATX board, 4 RAM slots, a PCI slot, 8 SATA ports and a switchable CPU. Two 300Mb SATA ports is definitely not enough for a NAS build. And I don't think 80W can power that board and 14 drives... I think you need more like 3-400W, calculating that PSU's are most efficient if you use them at 70%.  If I calculated the currencies correct, my build was $206+PSU. If I had to decide between that and your build, I would gladly pay the $7+PSU more. Then you have 4 RAM slots and 16x 600Mb SATA vs. 2RAM slots and 14x 42Mb SATA. Even WD green drives are way faster than that. If you can't get the H310, look for other cards that can be flashed to IT mode, like the M1015 (should be ~$99).  I never used 2.5"" drives for a NAS. I would guess they are slower and more pricey.

I think you can calculate with a peak of 5W per drive. The spec of my Toshiba drives says something about 8-12W but I sure hope that's not true :D  Also you talked about using a discrete GPU, which can draw at least 100W if you use it heavy.

Containers have access to the full resources of the OS, without the additional virtualization layer. They also run inside of the host OS, so they don't need an additional full install of an OS. You cannot mix OS's though.  So, for example, if you want to run a Linux container, it has to be run on a Linux OS and it uses OS ""tricks"" to keep it all self-contained with the same OS install.  With a VM, you can install whatever OS you want, but you have to install the FULL OS. Each virtual OS has the virtualization software's hardware presented to it, which much then go through a translation to the actual host operating system.  Think of it like trying to play an PS4 game on an Xbox One. The Xbox One would have to emulate the PS4 hardware."

The dismissive nature is assumed because otherwise your comment seems to come out of nowhere or be out of place somehow. Sounds like this part was probably the reason for the downvotes.   On a side note, now that I think about it, why shouldn't I? I'm not familiar with the 2.5"" ones but the 3.5"" portable ones are usually Green drives. Barring raid (assuming by ""array"", you were using the term ""array"" generally and not as in ""raid array""), Green drives are a good inexpensive choice where large throughput is not required."

I found some data on the 2TB pointing to a total 2.9% failure rate for probably a period of 30 days but due to the source most were probably DOA.  So yeah, Green drives aren't designed or marketed for constant use storage arrays but other than lack of technology in them to work in raid properly, and the datasheets themselves from WD telling you about lower MTBF, CDL, ALF, etc, there doesn't seem to be an issue in reality.  Even I buy Red drives now but sometimes I start questioning why (other than warranty and potential future raid use). Do you have any hard data on modern Green failure rates? I used to go by the star rating on newegg a long time ago until I realized the people complaining about the Green drives had been trying to use them in raid and subsequently were having them booted out due to the sleep and lack of TLER and assuming they failed. Unfortunately, this is the reason backblaze doesn't run many Green drives, so not much there in regards to statistics.

I know it's the audiophile's dream player, since it supports lossless, has plugins, has tagging support built in, is low-profile, etc.  Not my cup of tea. To give on idea of how I expect my music  to look like, here's some screen caps of my iTunes. This is the general album view. Shows all the album art, so it's easy to see what I'll be listening to. Along with having the tracks clearly visible, and everything having a 'nice ui' (which I'm a sucker for). And despite the Japanese, you can still easily tell what's gonna play.  This is the genre view. Again, same easy to see UI, but this time has a sidebar with clearly defined genres (I went through and labeled them all by hand).  Compare those to this foobar2k UI. Not my screen cap, but it shows my point. Quite frankly it's a clusterfuck. Sure, it shows a lot of data that audiophiles love (spectrograph, sample rate, etc), but now imagine if 80-90% of the album and artists names were in different languages instead of english. You'd be screwed.  And TBH, when I'm in the music program itself, I don't give a fuck about all that stuff. I just opened the program to listen to some music. So I'd like figuring out what I'm picking to be as painless as possible.  If foobar2k can give me a nice UI, along with lots of other bells/whistles, I'd be glad to make the switch.

I don't doubt that there are alternative solutions but beets pretty much allowed me to perfect a massive and disorganized library with ease so I really like it.   What tools do you use?"
DataHoarder,3c2uxc,letmebeeee,1 point,Sun Jul 5 15:12:09 2015 UTC,"Well as a disclaimer, I use a mac computer. For my MP3s, I simply download by hand (from a couple of different sources), and then tag using a software called ""Kid3"". I do all the tagging by hand, on a per-album basis.  I then put the album in it's proper place in my file structure, and import into iTunes (my preferred player).  I don't see why you'd need anything more than that. Either process could be automated (dl'ing/moving to folder or auto-tagging), but there's problems with both. No tools exist to auto-download/move. And no tools that properly tag the files."

For the latter, beets fails at properly tagging my music. Since it relies on musicbrainz, which lacks almost all of my music.

DataHoarder,3c2uxc,Dubhan,6,Sat Jul 4 08:39:03 2015 UTC,"iTunes for better or worse. The better is that it works with all my Apple and Windows devices, has a good streaming and backup via iTunes Match. I have AppleTV hooked to my stereo and listen to almost my music that way. The bad thing about it is that Apple is always tinkering with the iTunes software adding and removing key features etc. Luckily the latest installment allows you to turn off Apple Music which is of little interest to me. iTunes saves everything to Music/iTunes/iTunes Media/Music/Artist/Album if you let the program manage everything itself. It keep's whatever original names, metadata you give to the file.  I know a lot of people in this sub-Reddit probably frown on iTunes but it works for me. In blindfold tests I can't hear the difference between FLAC and MP3s. In fact I always seem to think the MP3 sounds better much to my embarrassment."

I ripped my cds way back when at 320, and itunes converts to 128 aac on the fly when syncing to idevices, which stuff a lot of music places."

In fact I always seem to think the MP3 sounds better much to my embarrassment.   What kind of MP3s are you getting? 320k mp3 vs Flac is hardly noticeable without an amazing setup and a good ear. 320k mp3 vs 128k mp3 is extremely noticeable.  FLAC's best if you plan on archiving (since it's a lossless format). MP3 is generally better if you want to cut down on file size and are just using it for listening purposes.  You don't want to use MP3s for archiving, since they are lossy, which means that they degrade with every transcode. Think those Jpegs with lots of artifacting, but for your music."
DataHoarder,3c2uxc,Kafke,2,Sat Jul 4 08:17:22 2015 UTC,"When, I rip the CDs myself I usually go with 320k, but even through audiophile systems I have a hard time hearing the difference 128k and 320k. I'm not saying there isn't a difference but I'm 55 years old and used to listen to a lot of loud live music."
DataHoarder,3c2uxc,strangerzero,1 point,Sat Jul 4 08:37:46 2015 UTC,"That, and you might just have cheap stuff. It's a bit of everything: file quality, headphone/speaker quality, how well you can hear, knowing what to listen for, etc.  320K is pretty much more than enough for a casual listener. The number wasn't arbitrary, it was chosen to be right at the edge of human hearing. So with a perfect setup, there should be negligible differences between it and flac. Anything less than 320k that you can't hear means you have something bad in your set up (either the speaker/headphone, or your ear :P).  But honestly, I don't mind listening to even 128k. Sure, it's a noticeable difference, but with most setups it's not that big of a deal.  Either way, I keep my 320K, since it's pretty much the best you need for almost any setup.  Just all depends on what you are listening with. Audiophiles will kill you though, if you are using any sort of lossy format, or using cheap headphones or something :P.  Edit: Actually, all music stuff is pretty much done to be ""not noticeable to the average listener"". IIRC I read that 198k was actually what they figured most people wouldn't notice things missing."

DataHoarder,3c2uxc,tyros,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:26:08 2015 UTC,"Because people are stupid and don't really know that MP3s are lossy. In this day and age, I don't think people convert their music (or even have music files) anyway. But you'll still have plenty of people rip the audio from youtube, convert it into an MP3 and think that's good.  I could easily see someone converting MP3 320 -> MP3 192 (iTunes down convert to save space on iPod), and then MP3 192 -> MP3 320 (for 'better' quality). Or even MP3 -> Some new lossy format.  As I said, you don't want to use MP3s for archival, since archiving typically implies you are gonna want to take it out later, which eventually means conversion into a modern format. For MP3s this will result in a degradation in quality, since they are lossy. Which is why I said to use FLAC for that.  Anyone who knows shit about music formats would know not to transcode an MP3. However, lots of people obviously don't know this. So it's worth saying."

You can't put all the operas in a single ""opera album"" or all of the piano concertos in a ""piano concerto"" album.

I'd personally try to use the same model for all the disks in my array, but what you're doing isn't crazy.  If you're using one of those union filesystem + parity setups, it won't make a hill of beans difference. If you're using Linux's md or ZFS, it might degrade performance of the whole array a little... probably below the threshold for human detection."

I wouldn't put a Green in a 24/7 business NAS, but I'm more than happy to use them in a home NAS running UnRAID or Windows Server that can happily spin down the drives for extended periods.  My UnRAID box, in normal use, only runs the data drives for about 2 hours a day at most.  Greens are perfectly fine with that sort of use.  I just retired a pair of 1.5TB Greens, bought just before the Thailand flooding.  They were still running fine having spent their life in a small Synology running Surveillance Station.  I turned off the idle timer years ago.  Replaced them with a pair of 6TB Greens.  If you're really paranoid, you can disable the idle timer using WDIDLE3.EXE, which reduces the excessive head parking, which can wear out the landing zone if left on and the drive run 24/7."

DataHoarder,3bpcog,anticommander,15,Wed Jul 1 01:58:36 2015 UTC,"I'm going to paste a post that I wrote elsewhere recently.  The thing is, ""traditional parity RAID"" is not sustainable in the long run and is a dying paradigm in the large data storage world.  Even if you add higher parity levels, the computations get more complex and eventually you will cross a threshold where rebuilding a disk takes longer than the average time between disk failures in large arrays. I've seen documented systems where this is nearly the case with RAIDZ3 already and moving to ""RAIDZ4""parity would surely push it past the limit in even more systems. This is obviously a problem. You would always be resilvering and would suffer from a pool that is always operating at degraded performance which is simply not acceptable and certainly not optimal.  The first simplest solution is to make more pools rather than single large pools.  Another answer that some have turned to is to use mirrors which scale a lot better. Also the main benefit to mirrors are that rebuilds are extremely fast. It's essentially just a copy operation from the other mirror. Meanwhile, all the other mirrored sets can operate at full capacity and serve up all the IOPS that the customer needs during these mirror resilvers. http://jrs-s.net/2015/02/06/zfs-you-should-use-mirror-vdevs-not-raidz/  For even larger systems companies are moving to distributed filesystems.  See this video to explain what companies who have outgrown traditional parity RAID solutions are now using: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x54s9cjMjPU  Now parity itself is not dead, but as RAID it is. There are new custom storage systems that still utilize parity data that are sustainable and scalable much larger via distributed means.  To understand how these new custom data storage systems operate I found these articles very helpful:  https://www.backblaze.com/blog/vault-cloud-storage-architecture/ https://code.facebook.com/posts/1433093613662262/-under-the-hood-facebook-s-cold-storage-system-/  It's interesting that both these companies created their own data storage software from scratch and both came up with roughly the same solution. Reed-Solomon erasure coding and storing distributed ""shards"" of data with parity shards. Backblaze splits files into 20 shards, 3 of which are used as parity, and Facebook splits files into 14 shards, 4 of which are used for parity.  Here is more info on the subject of large scale storage: http://wikibon.org/wiki/v/Erasure_Coding_and_Cloud_Storage_Eternity  Otherwise obviously RAID is still very much alive and well for small business and home arrays.  But perhaps it it only a matter of time before small businesses and some home users outgrow traditional RAID as large business have."
DataHoarder,3bpcog,SirMaster,5,Wed Jul 1 02:44:20 2015 UTC,"The challenge with moving to distributed filesystems is the introduction of more complexity. You're not just adding disks -- now you're adding hosts.  The software side of things isn't that hard -- OpenStack (and specifically, its Swift component) provides a distributed object store, and S3QL can create filesystems on such stores (it can also use Google Storage and Amazon S3, but those aren't cheap) so you can still set up a filer to utilize the redundant storage.  It's the hardware. For a properly redundant distributed filesystem in the style of the big boys, you're looking at running three servers, preferably with the same number (and size) of disks installed, although that's not as critical with distributed filesystems.  Since you're storing (up to) 3 copies of every bit of data, you're looking at only being able to use 33% of your installed capacity. For a home installation, you can probably reduce it to 2 copies.  On the plus side, ""recovery"" from a failed disk just involves the distributed filesystem replacing the lost data from the remaining copies by recreating the missing copies spread across the remaining disks (assuming there's space). Once the replacement disk is installed, the filesystem just rebalances itself with the new space. As you mentioned, it's just copies instead of parity-based reconstruction.  It's still not cheap, though, and it's not as easy to set up (especially for the home enthusiast)."
DataHoarder,3bpcog,willfe42,3,Wed Jul 1 08:43:00 2015 UTC,"Well the distributed filesystems like at Backblaze do not use copies.  They split each incoming file into 20 shards, 17 are the data and 3 are erasure parity shards and these 20 shards are split up over 20 separate servers in 20 separate racks.  So they can have 3 shards go down at once and the data is still available.  For this it means they can have 3 whole racks go down at once and all the data is fine.  With their filesystem they have 82.4% of their total raw capacity as usable."
DataHoarder,3bpcog,SirMaster,2,Wed Jul 1 14:22:05 2015 UTC,"Backblaze may not but other large scale providers like Amazon and Google do, I believe. They do this so that they can survive a full datacenter failure.  I think they use parity at a local level then copies between DCs at a higher level."
DataHoarder,3bpcog,bobobo1618,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:45:28 2015 UTC,"Interesting. I wonder then if OpenStack's Swift is the same way. That'd certainly make it more attractive, at least at the ""high end home enthusiast"" level."
DataHoarder,3bpcog,willfe42,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:03:13 2015 UTC,"So I might be missing something, but isn't the distributed shards method basically the same thing as software RAID, just with a static number of disks?  For example backblaze's 20 shards with 3 parity, wouldn't I achieve the same thing using a 20 disk RAIDZ3? Now I'm not sure how ZFS does it's triple parity calculations so they might differ in that aspect (though I thought all RAID systems use the Reed–Solomon code in someway), but I don't see how they are really any different at the basic level. Also I do understand backblaze is distributing across nodes so they can loose whole cabinets, but lets ignore that for now.  If backblaze looses a drive they still have to read the other 19 drives to rebuild the 20'th. Same as with the ZFS example."
DataHoarder,3bpcog,Balmung,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:22:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, except they're RAIDing systems and racks and disks. I imagine there are very few of us that have the luxury of thinking past a system or two, let alone racks."
DataHoarder,3bpcog,fryfrog,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:28:13 2015 UTC,"I understand they are doing their RAID across different systems in different racks, but isn't it still ""traditional parity RAID""?  My point is people are saying RAID is going away and shards is replacing it, but the shards is the same thing, just larger strips with more parity across larger systems."
DataHoarder,3bpcog,Balmung,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:45:59 2015 UTC,"Sure, but the word RAID carries an assumption of disk level. What they're doing is of course very similar, but it is further up. A software stack running on top of something."
DataHoarder,3bpcog,fryfrog,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:53:37 2015 UTC,"eventually you will cross a threshold where rebuilding a disk takes longer than the average time between disk failures in large arrays.   I think my 12 disk raidz3 array could take two days to rebuild. I've been running a year or more w/o a failure. What size array are you thinking of when you say this? I can't see how the average time between failures could even come close, ever. That said, taking into account the age of all the other disks in the array it could be far more true. In 2 years, when one of my 2x 365x 24x hour drives fails... there is a decent chance another one is considering it.  Almost everything else you're talking about applies squarely in large corporate environments. I don't think you can declare RAID parity as dead for typical /r/DataHoarder users or even smaller corporate environments.  I'm all for a pool of mirrors, but they don't offer any guarantees beyond the first single disk failure. They offer hope and chance that the second failure (before the first is solved) won't wipe out the pool.  I don't see myself ever giving up my raidz3, raidz2 or raid6 arrays. For sure, I wouldn't suggest anyone run raid5 or raidz."
DataHoarder,3bpcog,fryfrog,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:26:03 2015 UTC,"The main difference is you are resilvering the system at idle.  I'm talking about resilvering a production system that's always under   heavy load where the resilver can take a month or even more for a 100TB+ zpool because it's crawling along at 25MB/s or even less, especially if it's made up of a lot of small files.  In fact, a 25MB/s resilver speed on a 100TB zpool would take 45 days.  I meant the concept of traditional parity RAID is dead in that it doesn't have a future other than it's current use in smaller servers and there is no ""fix"" for it in sight.  Moving to RAIDZ4 or greater does not solve any of the problems.  Eventually home and small business systems will be much larger.  Seagate mentioned they could build 100TB HDMR HDDs in a decade for example.  Eventually having a petabyte at home won't be so crazy.  There was a time when having a terabyte at home was an insane idea and it wasn't really that long ago."
DataHoarder,3bpcog,SirMaster,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:33:03 2015 UTC,"Okay, you've got me there. But again, an enterprise environment.  Totally out of curiosity, are you talking about a pool with a single vdev composed of 25-50 disks in a single raidz(2|3)? Or one intelligently broken down into a few vdevs of reasonable size? I actually imagine you're talking about one broken down into vdevs of reasonable size.  I wish I got to play with ZFS at an enterprise level! :)"
DataHoarder,3bpcog,fryfrog,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:50:46 2015 UTC,"Yes, reasonable size vdevs, like no more than 15 or so disks per RAIDZ3.  Oracle mentioned in a blog about month-long resilvering times as being a real situation.  https://blogs.oracle.com/roch/entry/sequential_resilvering  Although technically they have solved it with ""sequential resilvering"".  A feature that is not planned for OpenZFS nor exists in any other striped parity RAID system that I know.  I suppose that someone would implement it in OpenZFS if the problem became so bad."
DataHoarder,3bpcog,SirMaster,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:52:13 2015 UTC,"Whoah, that little fix/tweak/change sounds really interesting, but I'm sure it'll never make it to OpenZFS. :("
DataHoarder,3bpcog,fryfrog,4,Wed Jul 1 21:21:46 2015 UTC,"Yes, theoretically drives increasing in size at a faster rate than they're increasing in speed means that rebuild times are greater, but the chances of a failure during a rebuild is still fairly low in the grand scheme of things. Due to areal density increasing with higher capacity drives, they are getting faster (though slowly), however shingled drives may step that back a little bit.  And remember, RAID is not backup. Repeat that again, RAID is not backup. It's fault tolerance.  In my professional environment, wherever we use RAID - we always have a mirrored, replicated system that can takeover when the other is being rebuilt. In case the rebuild fails, we have a second fully operational system and we have backups on a totally different medium (tape at my company).  At home, I use a fault tolerant parity system so I can sustain a single drive failure without losing data, and can rebuild a failed drive. If something goes wrong with that, I also have offsite backups.  Yes, a RAID failing to rebuild is a pain in the ass because I'll have to rely on my secondary backups, but it's not the end of the world."
DataHoarder,3bpcog,hotdog_handjobs,2,Wed Jul 1 05:35:55 2015 UTC,"I've wondered for a while which is better. Something like 3 large drives, vs 12 small, making the same capacity. Power and heat etc aside, with more drives you have more points of failure but their impact will be less on time and data loss if something goes wrong.  Luckily I don't have a obscene amount of data, so although I've got pushing 40TB RAW storage waiting to get setup, only maybe 10TB of that will be available at all times, and the rest is cold storage."
DataHoarder,3bpcog,stormcomponents,2,Wed Jul 1 09:38:17 2015 UTC,"With this it seems that the likelihood of another drive failing during the rebuild process also increases.   A rebuild doesn't really increase the chances of failure, but it means the already existing chance of failure will take out your array. Your risk is going up. Your chance of losing your array is going up. But I don't think the risk of a drive failing actually changes.  Use raid6, raidz2 or raidz3."
DataHoarder,3bpcog,fryfrog,2,Wed Jul 1 20:17:08 2015 UTC,"I think we'll see the technology change before we get to that point. Either everything will go ssd, or some new hdd technology will be invented that can write faster.  On top of that, there's some hard limit on how large plate hdd can get (we have a little ways to go still), so eventually we'll have to start using something else anyways.  The problem is also somewhat resolved by having more parity. As rebuild times get longer, I expect to see less and less raid5/6 and more raid51/61 (or whatever you call raid that has both mirroring and parity) or some other new crazy raid configuration that allows for more drives to fail during rebuild. I dunno, I guess at some point you reach a stage where you would constantly be rebuilding, but once again, I think that's a long ways off and new tech will come out that doesn't suffer from the same problems."
DataHoarder,3bpcog,supro47,5,Wed Jul 1 02:16:58 2015 UTC,"but once again, I think that's a long ways off and new tech will come out that doesn't suffer from the same problems.

DataHoarder,3bpcog,SirMaster,2,Wed Jul 1 02:46:50 2015 UTC,"Your post was really informative. Looks like I have some reading to do. It's some really cool stuff and I'm excited to see what comes out of it.  Moving away from raid into better methods of parity does seem like a good solution for the time, but I'm really wondering how much longer we stick with hdds (or at least, the type that we are using now). There's all kinds of problems to deal with, especially as they get larger. There's more moving parts and more probability of failure."
DataHoarder,3bpcog,supro47,3,Wed Jul 1 03:08:51 2015 UTC,"but I'm really wondering how much longer we stick with hdds   Probably for a long, long time yet.  http://www.kitguru.net/components/hard-drives/anton-shilov/seagate-demos-hamr-hdds-vows-to-start-commercial-shipments-in-late-2017/   Seagate Technology this week demonstrated a NAS packed with hard disk drives that use heat-assisted magnetic recording (HAMR) technology. While the company claims that the NAS worked flawlessly, Seagate again reconsidered the launch timeframe for its HAMR HDDs and delayed them to 2017 – 2018. Nonetheless, the company is already working on heated-dot magnetic recording (HDMR) tech, which will enable 100TB+ drives a decade from now."
DataHoarder,3bpcog,SirMaster,0,Wed Jul 1 03:39:48 2015 UTC,"That's a good point, but going from a straight up RAID5 with a minimum of 3 disks to a RAID5/1 (or whatever the formal name would be) with a minimum of 6 disks doesn't seem cost effective. I believe the largest non-SMR (and non-helium) drives are 6TB and the largest drive in general on the market is Seagate's 8TB drive. Is it worth it to go from 3 x 6TB drives for a usable storage of roughly 12 TB to 6 x 8TB drives for a usable storage of roughly 16TB? Adding 3 more drives to achieve a 4TB gain seems like a moot point."
DataHoarder,3bpcog,supro47,3,Wed Jul 1 02:28:12 2015 UTC,"I was thinking of larger arrays, and there definitely is a curve when you start talking about what is cost effective. There's a reason now you see all the giant enterprise servers running 4TB and 5TB drives even though bigger stuff exists.   I guess in your hypothetical, you are talking about using SMR drives in a raid with more parity, and right now that's not a good solution, because there really isn't any advantage of using larger SMR drives and more parity for failure. A larger system with smaller drives are more practical.  Currently I don't think that SMR drives have any place in a RAID, and their use is really limited to ""write once"" type of backups.  However, let's hypothetically say that 6tb is the limit for standard hdd technology (it isn't, but let's pretend). At some point in the future, a larger drive, say 20TB SMR drives might be more cost effective to run with more parity than a string of 6TB with less, the same way now that 10x5tb is more cost effective than 50x1TB (cost for the drives are similar, but the hardware needed to run 50 drives isn't).  I don't think this is really the answer though, but how things would end up if no new storage technology is invented (well, we have ssd...but those do have their own problems with long term storage)  Edit: I also just wanted to point out that I'm only a hobbyist when it comes to these things so I'm largely just speculating and talking out of my ass."

I don't have to add any files to the drives at all - but they need to be connected long enough.

They want to make sure you have a copy of your data too.   Not a great feature, but it's intentional nonetheless.

Handbrake is a great beginner level app for this. Be aware, video encoding is extremely intensive and could take many hours per movie depending on your system and the settings you use.  However, if your files are already compressed avi, mp4, mkv or similar, you will not save any space without major loss to quality, and should avoid re-encoding."

Not a lot for just one file, but when you're talking about thousands it would add up. As far as quality, I noticed no particular drop off, but then again I'm not a huge stickler for quality. I'm pretty happy as long as the audio/video is clear and consistent.   Still, there could be other caveats like errors in the files after converting or certain quirks in converting from a particular format, so I may try a single TV show and see how that goes."
DataHoarder,3bnv85,Balmung,12,Tue Jun 30 20:59:35 2015 UTC,"AVI is most likely using Xvid which is the predecessor to H.264 so it's not surprising that it gets smaller on trascoding, but you are for a fact loosing quality by transcoding an already heavily transcoded file. The fact that you were OK with ~700MB avi files means you apparently never cared about quality that much so it probably wouldn't be a big deal to do that on all your files."

DataHoarder,3bnv85,Y0tsuya,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:04:11 2015 UTC,"MKV is just a container.  The streams inside can use a wide variety of codecs.  Video compression doesn't work the way you think.  You don't get a simple x% reduction with each pass.  The encoder compresses to a certain quality or bitrate, along with some loss simply from the decode-encode process.  If source video is only slightly compressed (from raw YUV422 or YUV444), then you have a lot of headroom to work with before you perceive quality loss.  If source video is already highly-compressed, then every byte you shave off will cost you ever greater perceived quality loss."

DataHoarder,3bnv85,supro47,6,Tue Jun 30 22:37:26 2015 UTC,"Like /u/tyrrannothesaurusrex said, if you have the full size rips it's worth it. If you access to the original blurays/dvds, makemkv(for ripping) + handbrake(for encoding) will do the job nicely. You should never re-encode files.  Honestly though, even if you have the full size rips or the original DVD/blurays, unless you have a really fast computer, it's going to be faster for you to just re-download in the format you want. I started ripping my entire bluray collection but gave up on that after I realized I could easily download 3 or 4 movies in the time it took to rip and encode one (and that's on a mediocre internet connection)."

DataHoarder,3bnv85,slashrslashtrackers,6,Tue Jun 30 21:33:13 2015 UTC,"""converting everything to MKV"" doesn't actually do anything; technically MKV is just a container that can hold any sort of video codec. I think you meant to say convert to x264.  What kind of TV/movie files do you have, and what size are they?  Are they mostly Xvid DVDRips, x264 HD stuff, or full BluRays?  If you just have Xvid DVDRips - it would probably be much better to download new x264 encodes rather than transcode from a bad source. Although in this case x264 encodes won't save you that much space, if you have 5+TB worth of 700MB Xvid movies or 150MB TV episodes then I suggest you start deleting or consider getting a new hard drive.  If you have HD encodes, audio might be a way for you to save on space, especially if you only have 2.1 speakers and aren't fussy about sound. Audio transcoding is faster than video transcoding too. Some HD encodes come with lossless DTS HD-MA audio which is extremely bloated, you can save a GB or 2 per movie by transcoding to plain DTS or even 640kpbs AC-3.  If you have BluRays then encoding to x264 will easily halve your storage, provided you're willing to learn encoding. There are programs like eac3to that allow you to encode from command line; those can be automated easily so you can just apply the same settings to a bunch of inputs. Won't be the best, but it's fast to automate. Video encoding is a bitch though, it's very CPU-intensive and a 1080p will take many hours at full load even with an i7.  Ultimately, what you have and what is important to you (video quality, audio quality etc) is also important in deciding what to do. If you can elaborate on what exactly you have I can give you more specific advice.  If you need more specific advice and aren't comfortable posting what you have feel free to PM me."

Interesting.  “0” is often used as a metavalue that means “unlimited”… so maybe CrashPlan will ALWAYS dedupe EVERYTHING when going over a WAN link, but only dedupes files smaller than 1GB when going over a LAN link, presumably because they recognize that there’s a balance between CPU capacity and network capacity.  It seems that they assume everyone has ridiculously slow upload speeds that are typical of most residential Internet connections.  Being the smarty that I am, I figured I’d set it to not dedupe any files larger than 104857600 bytes (100MB) when going over the WAN:  <dataDeDupAutoMaxFileSizeForWan>104857600</dataDeDupAutoMaxFileSizeForWan>  (Note:  If you use backup sets, you will have more than one of these lines, one per backup set.

DataHoarder,3bms4u,MrRatt,2,Sun Jul 5 00:04:51 2015 UTC,"Most everyone else has covered the normal dedupe and compression tuning stuff, so instead, how big are the files you're trying to upload? If you've got millions of tiny files, then the speeds you're looking at aren't that surprising. CrashPlan is better at handling smaller file sets consisting of large files rather than large file sets consisting of small ones I've noticed.  If it's larger files, there's a chance you may be connected to one of their servers that's slower for you. I can't remember exactly where they list the server you're connecting to (it's somewhere under Settings, I think maybe the last tab? only have the ProE client in front of me right now so can't check), but if it's one that's far away, that may be the cause. Unfortunately, the only way to change the server destination is to regenerate your GUID (IIRC, there may be an easier way now), which may put you back on the same server or may stick you on a new one, and will force you to reupload everything you've already uploaded.  Oh, also, you may try changing the CPU restriction settings to something like 90/90 and see if that does change anything. Just because a process manager is showing 50% usage doesn't mean CrashPlan isn't still limiting itself based on the usage settings in the app."
DataHoarder,3bms4u,redbeardthepirate,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:56:25 2015 UTC,How much data are you trying to upload? Even with dedupe set to minimal it still tries so I have turned it off completely and it helped speed up my backup.

If this is important data being stored you should try to stick to the general plan of: 3 backups, 2 types of storage, and 1 of them offsite"
DataHoarder,3bnmss,thefooz,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:56:27 2015 UTC,"No. Blacks have TLER disabled, which wreaks havoc with RAID under the right circumstances."
DataHoarder,3bnmss,B0NK3R5,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:59:53 2015 UTC,"Okay, seriously, I've googled this before and my general understanding is:-   TLER is a limitation on how long the drive will actively attempt to fix data, by rereading/whatnot, before returning an error. This is useful for RAID because a RAID implementation may drop a device that's not responding (I.E. recovering).   Now, my question is:- why not just increase the delay time? If a drive doesn't respond in let's say, five minutes. I understand when a drive does die it means there'll be a five minute delay for your next read, but surely that's better in the majority of cases (Except where you need insane performance) than dropping a drive from the RAID, causing bad performance for hours during the rebuild, and resulting in a lot of headache."
DataHoarder,3bnmss,cftvgybhu,2,Thu Jul 2 00:57:43 2015 UTC,"It's a good question that I, unfortunately, do not have the answer to.

DataHoarder,3bnmss,TheAbyssDragon,2,Thu Jul 2 01:16:32 2015 UTC,"You're talking about striping.   I know that when using raid 0 you have twice the chance to have a hard drive failure but isn't my chance of losing data the same as every other person who posts their raid 0 2 x 1tb setup on here and other places?   Yes.  Why not just use them separately. Not quite as nice, but then you don't lose everything if one fails. I'd still have proper backups though with no redundancy. In which case striping is probably fine."
DataHoarder,3bnmss,B0NK3R5,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:59:45 2015 UTC,Why not just use them separately.   Pretty sure OP is concerned about speed. Raid 0 is faster than the individual drives would be.   I don't want big 6 or 8tb drives because they are all slower than than wd black

DataHoarder,3bnmss,fryfrog,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:38:21 2015 UTC,raid 0 gets you roughly a combined speed of the drives involved. So if a single drive has ~180MB/s read then a raid 0 of 2 of these drives has a read of almost 360MB/s.  My 5x3TB@7200RPM raid 0 has no trouble reading at 800MB/s  I consider that a significant speed boost when I spend my day copying terabytes of data.

One disk has a failure probability, lets say that is 1% of disks fail in a year (I'm making this up). If you have one disk, there is a 1/100 chance it'll fail that year. If you have two disks, a 2/100 or 1/50 chance a single disk will fail that year. By doubling the number of disks, you've doubled the chance that one disk will fail.  If you store your data in a raid1 array (a mirror), you mitigate your chance of having a single disk failure take out your data. Your chance of one failing is still 1/50, but it takes two failures for all your data to be lost.  In a 3 disk raid 5, there is a 3/100 chance that one disk will fail, but you're protected from data loss until the 2nd disk fails.  In a 2 disk raid0, ANY disk failure results in total loss of data on the array. So you have a 1/50 chance of losing all your data.  If you kind of don't care about your data, like... hey I could lose it... but it'd be nice if I didn't... use a union filesystem. It'll join the two disks together so they appear to be one, but the data still goes to one disk or the other. If one disk fails, you lose only what was on that disk that failed."

Haha  That being said, I think picking up another drive and just spreading your data across both drives, without raid, fits your situation best. The performance gains/losses are minimal at best.

DataHoarder,3bnmss,religionisaparasite,1 point,Wed Jul 1 12:26:09 2015 UTC,"Hi there.  If you want you can set 2 WD Black drives in RAID 0 and they will work fine since they're tested and recommended for consumer RAID. You can take a look at this KB article about setting up an array with desktop drives.  However, keep in mind that WD Black is designed to work as a stand-alone drive and has the specific build-in features for such usage (like a dual-core CPU that makes the drive great for multitasking). For instance, HDDs that are meant for RAID have TLER, which stops the hard drive from entering into a deep recovery cycle.  Basically when an error is found on a hard drive it enters into a deep recovery cycle to attempt to repair the error, recover the data from the problematic area, and then reallocate a dedicated area to replace the problematic one. The process can take up to 2 minutes depending on the severity of the issue, and most RAID controllers allow a very short amount of time for a hard drive to recover from an error. If a hard drive takes too long to complete this process, the drive will be dropped from the RAID array, and the TLER feature prevents the drive from dropping from the array.  Also, since you're going to setup a RAID 0, I would suggest to make a backup plan for your important data because that array don't offer any redundancy.  Hope this helps.  Cheers! :)"
DataHoarder,3bnmss,religionisaparasite,1 point,Wed Jul 1 11:47:31 2015 UTC,so I guess the question is raid 0 + backup to external for closet?  or raid 5 (about the same price)  I think the 0 would be better
DataHoarder,3bnmss,Gotxi,1 point,Wed Jul 1 12:25:38 2015 UTC,"RAID 0 will be faster, and having a separate drive for backups is always a big plus, so if you're looking for speed more than for redundancy I would suggest this configuration.  However, if additional redundancy is important for you as well, then go with a RAID 5 since this will give you the best of both worlds: fast performance by striping data across all drives; data protection by dedicating a quarter of each drive to fault tolerance leaving three quarters of the system capacity available for data storage."
DataHoarder,3bnmss,religionisaparasite,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:53:03 2015 UTC,I guess the question is an extra drive for redundancy or a backup for a safe or closet which is better the backup drive is certainly cheaper
DataHoarder,3bnmss,Gotxi,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:20:21 2015 UTC,"It depends on what you would prefer. :)  I personally will go with 3 drives in RAID 5 because I prefer to have more redundancy than speed, and still would use an external drive or cloud for regular backups."
DataHoarder,3bm7ah,Lateiner,7,Tue Jun 30 10:11:26 2015 UTC,"After reading your post, here's a list of general ideas or concepts in no particular order:  Try to always have a cold, offline backup of any data you consider valuable. Disconnected is best. Test restoring from it. Know your threat model, and plan your restore strategy (nevermind ""backup strategy"", it's useless if you cannot restore).  Try to avoid putting any green drives in an array. The firmware aggressively parks the heads, often causing earlier than expected mechanical failure. On some drives this can be flashed, but you might as well spend the extra few dollars per drive for a red drive. Also, they lack any vibration dampening (afaik), so too many drives can increase the likelyhood of vibration related failures as time progresses.  Using the Seagate 8TB SMR archive drives in an array can give reasonable (but likely not impressive) performance under the following conditions:   You don't intend to write >25GB of contiguous data to each drive at a time (to maximise the non-SMR cache), You don't do much random write IO, Your IO operations are sparodic, allowing time for re-shingling, Your use case is mostly frequent long, contiguous reads.   Otherwise, for backup storage a green drive or SMR seems ideal. Just make sure nothing has a reason to wake up the greens, or write random data to the SMR drives (as above, really).  As awesome as ZFS is, try to avoid using it without ECC RAM, unless you really don't care about the data.  With drives >2TB, avoid single parity RAID arrays, as you are approaching the statistical liklihood of an unrecoverable read error on rebuild. Dual parity or above is recommended for larger drives, even considering the added financial cost and additional CPU overhead.  As you have discovered, try to avoid those Seagate 3TB drives that are giving them a really bad reputation at the moment. A quick google will reveal the exact model number.  Hope this helps you come to a decision!"
DataHoarder,3bm7ah,heljara,7,Tue Jun 30 10:43:48 2015 UTC,"+1 to all of this, with one difference: The Seagate 8TB SMR (in my opinion) shouldn't be used for any kind of RAID solution. The 25GB on-board cache works great for most workloads, but in the event that you have to build or rebuild an array using these drives, the write speeds will drop into the single digits MB/s for extended periods, and you can expect rebuild times to be measured in days rather than hours. This leaves your total RAID loss window larger than usual.  EDIT: Also I think ECC RAM is more optional than heljara would lead you to believe. ZFS is no more or less vulnerable to memory inaccuracies than any other filesystem. It's just that if you've chosen ZFS you probably care about data integrity, and ECC memory is the next logical step in protecting your data."
DataHoarder,3bm7ah,AesoSpadez,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:21:54 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your feedback! Good work pointing out the greater rebuild time, I forgot to mention that.  There is plenty of anecdotal information on the Internet regarding the performance of SMR drives in an array. Some claim they are alright, others claim they are worse than tape, but I feel it really varies on your use case. Perhaps with some nice large SSDs as SLOG and ARC on your zpool, you wouldn't notice the difference most of the time? This would likely ruin the $/GB value of the 8TB SMR drives though, so why not reds (or better)? It really does depend on your own specific workload and use cases, which makes anecdotal evidence less valuable.  OP has up to 12TB of data to back up, which would require 2x 8TB SMR drives (assuming no redundancy). Archive drives are after all, designed for archiving data. There are just plenty of users who are all about the $/GB. (Edit OP has been burned in the past by Seagate, so my assumption here may be a poor one.)  I don't think I overly stressed the criticality of ECC with ZFS - but it is worth understanding the risks involved. As you indicated, as a filesystem it is no more or less vulnerable to memory failures, but a failure can have a higher cost of damage with ZFS. Append the usual ""scrub of doom"" arguments here. End-to-end Data Integrity for File Systems: A ZFS Case Study summed it up quite nicely:   In this paper, we analyzed a state-of-the-art file system, ZFS, to study the implications of disk and memory corruptions to data integrity. We used carefully controlled fault injection experiments to simulate realistic disk and memory errors and presented our observations about ZFS behaviour and its robustness.  While the reliability mechanisms in ZFS are able to provide reasonable robustness against disk corruptions, memory corruptions still remain a serious problem to data integrity. Our results for memory corruptions indicate cases where bad data is returned to the user, operations silently fail, and the whole system crashes. Our probability analysis shows that one single bit flip has small but non-negligible chances to cause failures such as reading/writing corrupt data and system crashing.  We argue that file systems should be designed with end-to-end data integrity as a goal. File systems should not only provide protection against disk corruptions, but also aim to protect data from memory corruptions. Although dealing with memory corruptions is hard, we conclude by discussing some techniques that file systems can use to increase protection against memory corruptions.   They then proceed to list a number of ways this could be improved. It's an interesting read.  In addition, it seems reasonable to conclude that anyone deploying a ZFS pool not only is likely to keep using it for many years (looking at us, datahoarders). As time progresses, statistical likelihood of failure increases. In addition to this, many homelabs use second-hand equipment, stacking on years of runtime already.  A further risk (to homelabbers especially) is heat. Probability of RAM failures increase as temperature rises, and many homelabs are not cooled as effectively as server rooms and data centers, leading to an increased probability of failure.   Compared to other filesystems, ZFS does seem to be lacking in recovery tools. There's a theme here, it begins with B.  All of this said and done, you're always playing the odds against failure, even with ZFS and ECC. ECC decreases the odds of an automatic, possibly highly destructive failure significantly.   You could compare it to RAID itself - you have a higher upfront cost (more HDDs) to have redundancy. You spend more on ECC compatible systems, to have integrity.  Having backups are a great way of reducing the cost of failure (or perhaps, reducing the value of the pool through duplication)."

DataHoarder,3bm7ah,metaldood,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:44:03 2015 UTC,"That would certainly help with the head parking problem.  There are also other minor differences between green and red drives, such as vibration dampening, TLER support, longer manufacturer warranty and often better manufacturer ratings (usable temperature range, MTBF, cycle count etc).  For the price difference, I often conclude that an extra year or two of warranty makes it an easy decision, even aside from the other benefits."

But I do test every bit of RAM using a few runs of memtest86, just to be sure.  I'm planning to stick with my Reds for the array and to use other drives (greens or something different) for ""shelf backup"". The RAID6-style double parity is also something I want to stick to."

Even a cosmic ray can flip a bit, if you are very unlucky! :)  Leaving it testing long enough to warm up to as hot as it will get (48h window should cover day/night cycle reasonably well) should however be a good indication of performance in thermal cycles."
DataHoarder,3bm7ah,fryfrog,1 point,Wed Jul 1 07:28:08 2015 UTC,"As awesome as ZFS is, try to avoid using it without ECC RAM, unless you really don't care about the data.   ZFS (and btrfs) w/o ECC is still better than any other filesystem w/o ECC. You don't need to go out of your way to use ECC w/ ZFS. If you can, that is great... but don't feel like you're not allowed to run ZFS w/o ECC. It just isn't true."
DataHoarder,3bm7ah,heljara,2,Tue Jun 30 16:45:34 2015 UTC,"""Not allowed to"" and ""try to avoid"" are somewhat different, which with any luck gets people curious - who then teach themselves on why ECC has high value for data integrity, and the higher risk associated (not necessarily probability) when using ZFS without it."
DataHoarder,3bm7ah,emk2203,3,Wed Jul 1 07:30:05 2015 UTC,"For anything above 5 TB, I would recommend a FreeNAS solution with zfs. Proven, unlike btrfs. Give btrfs 5 more years to mature, until then, use zfs on FreeNAS.  You should invest in more RAM with ECC, though. Anything upwards of 16 GB is future-proof, but you could scrape by with 8 GB."

DataHoarder,3bm7ah,emk2203,2,Tue Jun 30 16:39:42 2015 UTC,"It just hasn't been around long. If I were picking a filesystem right now, I'd actually pick btrfs but use it in raid1. Then, once raid6 is considered stable, all you have to do is flip a switch and it'll migrate live. In the mean time, you can easily add (or remove) disks as you like, the size doesn't even matter! You escape all the annoying little bits of ZFS. And I say this as someone who currently loves and uses ZFS. But next time I do a file system migration, it'll be to btrfs."

Your bottleneck in SATA is the protocol itself and the overhead of the 8/10-bit encoding. If you are using a SATA PCIe based controller card, the performance between onboard and a PCIe SATA controller card is virtually the same -- the SATA protocol itself is the problem."
DataHoarder,3bkz6y,sponslerm,16,Tue Jun 30 04:34:08 2015 UTC,"When the SATA III standard is quoted at 6 Gbit and 600 MB/s, the 600 MB/s is the usable bandwidth and accounts for the 8/10 encoding. 6,000 Mbit/s / 8 = 750 MB/s. The 20% bandwidth lost is 150 MB/s, which gives us a usable 600 MB/s.   Fibre Channel does the same thing. 1 Gbit Fibre Channel gives you 100 MB/s, because of the 8/10 encoding. Interestingly enough, 16 Gbit Fibre Channel moved to 64/66 encoding, much more efficient than 8/10. However, it still provides 1600 MB/s, giving 100 MB/s for every Gigabit. The true data rate of 16 Gbit Fibre Channel is ~14 Gbit/s.   Ethernet actually bumps up the underlying rate to give a full 1 Gbit. 1 Gbit Ethernet runs at 1.25 Gbits, so the usable transfer is actually 125 MB/s. 10 Gibabit Ethernet uses 64/66 encoding, and the underlying baud rate is something like 10.13 Gbit/s."

DataHoarder,3bkz6y,v8xd,6,Wed Jul 1 12:43:39 2015 UTC,Someone correct me if I'm wrong but wouldn't two SSD's connected to two 6Gb interfaces be faster than a single SSD connected to a 10Gb interface? Assuming you can saturate the interface each SSD is connected to you could be reading from two drives at 6Gb simultaneously for a combined throughput of 12Gb.

DataHoarder,3bjcdl,ComputerSavvy,3,Tue Jun 30 15:45:00 2015 UTC,"Oracle is a hardware manufacturer which means they aren't paying full rate for hardware, potentially.  If they have a slow quarter on the hardware side, they can take what would otherwise just be excess inventory and use it internally.   IBM supposedly does this to provide some of their hosted/cloud services.  (I've heard it said about their mainframe production line in Central America so many times that it seems to be an apocryphal story, that basically they keep the line running regardless of sales and just take the ""extra"" machines and stick them in a datacenter near the factory and use them for hosted services. No idea if it's true but it's plausible.)  At some point it's costing you money because you're overproducing, but in the short run it means really cheap hardware for internal use.  It still seems like a stretch to be able to offer the service at 1/10th the price of the competition, so I think they must be taking a loss somewhere, but they could be doing some funny internal economics in the meantime too."

DataHoarder,3bjbbq,BathenBattle,5,Mon Jun 29 23:50:27 2015 UTC,It depends. The Seagate 8TB Archive drive has a cache which will help with speeds but these drives are not really designed for being constantly written to with lots of small files and there is a significant performance decrease after the cache is filled while writing to the drive. I actually use this drive in my media centre and read and writes are constantly over 100 MB/s because I write a few large files at a time rather than constant small files which helps. I'm actually considering buying another one and using it as game storage on my PC because the reads are fantastic and are almost always over 150 MB/s which is pretty good for mechanical drives.
DataHoarder,3bjbbq,gtaking112,4,Tue Jun 30 00:11:23 2015 UTC,"SMR drives will perform well with highly sequential data. Once you start blasting the drive with numerous small files or highly random data then you'll see the performance tank. A new technology that's in the works is called ""host-managed"" storage. In host-managed storage the host OS is aware of the SMR nature of the drive and will structure writes in such a way that they are very sequential.  Seagate has been working on converting EXT4 to be an SMR Friendly File System (SMRFFS) and has a Git repository that anyone can pull down and mess with. Although we still need host managed drives to make use of it...  AFAIK if you only write sequentially to an SMR drive then you will be able to achieve speeds comparable to perpendicular / classic magnetic recording (PMR / CMR) drives. IMO, SMR and SMRFFS's are the keys to continued HDD capacity improvements."

DataHoarder,3bi1nv,Hakker9,9,Mon Jun 29 11:50:00 2015 UTC,"The 8TB Archive drives are stable, but they're slooooow when writing lots of data to them. You'll see them drop to 2-3MB/sec every few minutes. If you're planning to use them to replace existing disks in a ZFS vdev, the resilver will be really slow. In the linked article, it took days (three times as long as an 8TB helium disk). The same will apply when a disk fails.  Bearing in mind that RAIDs are most susceptible to disk failure when recovering with a new disk after one has failed, prolonging the rebuild process just increases the risk of losing another disk before the replacement is ready. A raidz2 helps protect against that, but it's not perfect -- with 8 disks to replace in each array, they'll spend weeks rebuilding as you slowly replace disks.  I'd go with the Reds (or the 8TB heliums)."
DataHoarder,3bi1nv,willfe42,2,Mon Jun 29 12:20:44 2015 UTC,"This is pretty much spot on.  I have 6 of the Archives in a btrfs RAID6, and the initial sync took ~8 days.  Feel free to read my posts here and here.  If you're adding these to an existing RAID, you'll probably want to stick with the RED's.  These drives are a great price for the size you get, but if any of these failed, rebuilds/performance would slow to a crawl during that 1 week+ rebuild.  Use them for backup, not for demanding write scenarios.  They'll never have a problem saturating gigabit on reads though.. so for me, they serve their intended purpose."
DataHoarder,3bi1nv,zackiv31,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:31:46 2015 UTC,I don't need to do a sync I just move from pool to pool and around 100 MB/s would be more than enough. It's about 100-200 GB of write actions a week tops and not as a single burst. Resilvering is not going to be the real issue unless they just fubar but since their 3 TB drives Seagate seem to be doing a lot better. In the end it's more like 90%/10% when it comes to read/write. Before I asked it here I was thinking about 20 MB/s for the pool continuous write speed for files which are generally 200 MB and up. So this whole thing seems to look a lot better than my initial thought about the drives.
DataHoarder,3bi1nv,HellDiverUK,8,Tue Jun 30 11:58:37 2015 UTC,"The Archives have a 25GB non-shingled cache area.  Go over that and the speed goes to shit.  I'm talking down below 2MB/s.

The paper linked by /u/koi-sama says:  The drives use a persistent disk cache of 20 GiB and 25 GiB on the 5 TB and 8 TB drives, respectively, with high random write speed until the cache is full."

DataHoarder,3bi1nv,BathenBattle,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:25:53 2015 UTC,What happens if you power the device down while data is in the cache? I assume the cache is non-volatile and will just continue being written when you next power the drive?
DataHoarder,3bi1nv,port53,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:41:59 2015 UTC,"It sounds like the cache is just an area of the spinning disk that's not SMR, so it writes fast all the time."

DataHoarder,3bi1nv,HellDiverUK,0,Mon Jun 29 18:07:38 2015 UTC,"Is this based on own information just the half reviews. you can find. I mean storagereview is nice but beyond a NAS it doesn't test a damn thing nor does it really mention how the write speeds are... as in continuously 2-3 MB or when moving from singles. Basically the only really large write is when I move it from vdev to vdev beyond that they are bursts of 70 GB tops I guess. also might be a nice idea to know how long the low writes persist after you completed a write action. This way I might be able to script a migration script together.  What is strange is this is why I ask it with ZFS in mind instead of anything else is that a user on SR mentions he can keep a 100 MB/s sequential write going with RaidZ with 5 TB of data.   If I would copy over the network the speed would be 120 MB/s tops along with 8 drives writing that would be a roughly 20 MB/s per drive since 2 are for parity. Internally max would be 300 due to controller being limited factor so that would probably go a bit lower if done continuously, hence the question for use cases and not just theory and random copy/pastes."
DataHoarder,3bi1nv,aeramor,3,Mon Jun 29 14:37:58 2015 UTC,"I have two 8TB Archive drives.  I've used them in a Windows box running StableBit DrivePool, and I'm currently running them in an UnRAID box.  I've had no issues with speed when loading the drives with data.  If I fill the cache with 25GB of small files, drive access will continue for 2-3 minutes.  They're quite a loud drive, so it's very easy to hear when they're shingling (or housekeeping if you prefer).   For example, I copied over my ""Software"" share, which is 40GB of small files - software setup, drivers, etc.  It went great for 25GB then dropped to 2-3MB/s for a few minutes, then sped up again.  I was copying across the network, so the small files are pretty slow anyway.  It maybe added 5 minutes to the time taken to copy the files.  My ""Movies"" share is 2TB of files, mostly 10GB or more in size.  The whole lot moved over at a constant 120MB/s.  There was some shingling going on afterwards.  If you copy over big files, in the 1GB+ range, the drive can keep up and do the shingling pretty much realtime, so it can sustain ~100MB/s writes across it's whole span.  Some of the users of the UnRAID community have done a LOT of testing of these drives:  http://lime-technology.com/forum/index.php?topic=39526.0"
DataHoarder,3bi1nv,hungarianhc,0,Mon Jun 29 14:49:43 2015 UTC,You see the difference in your responses? That is one hell of a major difference and also a lot clearer on how the SMR drives perform. Especially when you consider what your data will consist off.  Then you get the response as big files... go for it. Small files avoid it and most of all the initial fill will be less of an impact then first thought.  Anyways the reply you gave now is tons more valuable than the first one much clearer so thank you and kudos for that.

I'm also working on some perl scripts to scrape recipes off of various websites and store them as epubs. Having real trouble figuring out how to include javascript to do unit conversion. Worse, there is metadata I want to include that just doesn't exist in the recipes themselves (not to mention I'm still having trouble defining it).

I think the file naming convention should be   lastName, firstName - [catalog number] - The Title.jpg   This would make it easy to eventually get a proper metadata db going so someone could write scanner/agent plugins for Plex.  There are a few drawbacks:   Plex doesn't support jpeg2000 which would make high res images smaller Plex photo libraries are designed for crappy polaroids more than the Mona Lisa, so you can't really tag them correctly As I've discovered previously, Plex can't handle large image libraries... and some of these artists have 4000+ images, so even having 50 of such indexed would cause Plex to choke and die"

If you're going to do it, you don't need a super-fancy turntable or anything, but it does help (a lot) to get a fresh ""cartridge"" (needle) for whatever you are going to use.  And clean the record really thoroughly.  There's still a ton of un-digitized material available at thrift shops and the like, too.  I haven't digitized them yet (all my equipment is in pieces right now) but I picked up a couple of old highschool band LPs from the 60s ... I guess having your band's big concert pressed into vinyl was a thing, back then."

Also, it would have a problem with moving a folder named for example ""2001.A.Space.Odyssey.1968.720p.BluRay"" as it does not look up the title on any databases so it does not know if its 2001 or 1968.

DataHoarder,3becm3,mercenary_sysadmin,2,Mon Jun 29 10:21:33 2015 UTC,"I'm scared mixing them is just going to give me the worst of both worlds.   That's exactly what it's going to do.  In general, an array or pool is going to track the worst characteristics of any given disk in the array or pool.  The effect will be noticeably stronger in a striped array (RAID6, RAIDZ2, etc) than it will in a distributed pool (ZFS pool of mirrors, btrfs-RAID1, JBOD) but that's going to be the general tendency, regardless.  Whether that's a problem for you depends on whether you're willing to tolerate the characteristics of the slower disks.  If you'd happily use an array/pool with nothing but the Archive drives, then there's no reason you won't be happy with an array/pool with a few of them.  On the other hand if you wouldn't be happy with an array/pool composed solely of the Archive drives... then you shouldn't add them to your existing array/pool, you should create a new array/pool with them and only put data in that new array/pool that you're willing to tolerate their characteristics on."

My current plan is to make a separate pool using the archive drives, since if you add them as a separate vdev in your existing pool (I'm assuming ZFS) then any future writes will be striped over the archive drives as well, ruining your performance."
DataHoarder,3becm3,shottothedome,1 point,Sun Jun 28 13:12:09 2015 UTC,It's not a problem on non-striping storage methods like snapraid. Ive been adding a new 8tb archive drive each month lately. Writes are a bit slower than my other drives.  As long as you dont outstrip the 20-25GB write buffer cache the drives have i havnt noticed an issue. The buffer isnt a problem with a single drive but could be an issue in an array using striping over the disks on say a rebuild. reads are still nice and fast off archive drives.

DataHoarder,3bea6e,Balmung,3,Sun Jun 28 13:03:49 2015 UTC,"RAID10 is stupid for simple file storage. Why would I waste 50% of my space for parity for something that isn't running VMs or DBs?  Even what I have is a bit more parity drives than I would like, but oh well."
DataHoarder,3bea6e,Balmung,1 point,Sun Jun 28 16:19:00 2015 UTC,"ZFS stripes across all vdevs in a pool so yes a bunch of mirrors in a pool is basically RAID10. This is why each vdev must have sufficient parity as loosing a vdev looses the whole pool.  And yeah there isn't parity calculations on RAID10 so of course it's faster, but again why would I care for a home NAS? Most people's bottle neck at home is going to be their 1Gb NIC. I actually have 10Gb and the disks still aren't the bottle neck nor is the parity calculations.  Now if you are trying to use a single core atom then yeah your going to have a bad time, but modern CPUs are quite fast and parity calculations really aren't a big deal (though from what I have read RAIDZ3 actually does have a bigger hit on the CPU compared to single or double parity).  So yeah I rather have more space with no negative effects for my use case and as a bonus I can loose any two drives and be fine where with RAID10 if you loose the wrong two drives you loose the entire pool (though that does seem unlikely)."
DataHoarder,3bea6e,Balmung,4,Sun Jun 28 16:48:06 2015 UTC,"Seems slow to me, back when I had a hardware RAID card with 8 slow green 1TB drives in RAID5 it could rebuild in 4-5 hours. That was with it not in use much though so if you're doing a lot on the drives then I could see it going slow."

The other models with hella lot of PCIe are in the X10 series like the X10DRG-OT+-CPU, supporting up to 8 GPUs (and still 3 open slots for other cards).

In my collection that video would just go in /busty/huge/[performer name]/facial/ (I use a subcategory in busty to distinguish the ""oh my god how can you even stand up?!?!"" performers (think Hitomi Tanaka or Lucie Wilde). I tend not to prefer performers with implants, so ""natural"" is just assumed.  Alas, my (admittedly simplistic) method doesn't account for butt size, shaved/not shaved or hair color. I do have a petite category that sort of implies ""small butt"" but otherwise it's not accounted for.  I suppose my way of organizing things reflects my preferences :) I've long wanted to devise something more sophisticated to organize it all. It's just a daunting task. I went back after posting my ""14TB!"" comment and actually had the machine do the counting. It's really 16.7TB.   I do periodically dupe-check the whole mess to make sure there aren't any literal byte-for-byte duplicates, but I'm sure there's some duplicates (e.g. 1080p vs. 720p versions of the same scene, a full length video with all scenes in one file vs. the same video w/split scenes, etc.).  The real trouble is that sorting, organizing and deduping the collection is only an ""interesting"" task (so to speak) for an hour or two at a time, followed by an immediate drop to zero interest for awhile :)"

I guess i'll keep doing what i'm sorta doing, putting into different folders such as   #Ebony #British #Huge tits #Milf etc   Then add more keywords to the file name like someone else said.

DataHoarder,3bc13z,zimzamzoom2,2,Sun Jun 28 18:35:09 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the pointers. It's more complicated than that, unfortunately. Finding duplicate files is easy. Identifying duplicate videos is a much tougher nut to crack.  Two copies of the same video, one in 1080p and one in 720p are ""identical"" for curating purposes but very different on the disk (file sizes, hash, etc. will all be different). Two videos may contain the same video at the same resolution but using different codecs -- identical content but one looks better than the other (and it's not always the larger file that's the better one).  Meh. It's a pain in the arse :) The tech involved in solving this problem is called ""video fingerprinting,"" and so far all I've found is expensive commercial software that caters to intellectual property cranks and law enforcement, and less expensive (and obviously crappy) commercial software written by solo developers who spam their software all over Wikipedia.  I did find a library called pHash that looks like it'll do the trick, and it's even open source, but it's just the guts of the fingerprinting part of the process and a library to handle the resulting fingerprints. The rest (finding and decoding videos to fingerprint them, keeping track of possible duplicates, UI, etc.) is left as an exercise for the intrepid developer.  Plus it's written in C++ and I don't feel like writing an app for this in C/C++ nor writing a binding/wrapper to expose it to another language today. It's Sunday, and I'm feeling lazy :)  On the plus side, I did get to remove a bit of spam from Wikipedia, so it's not a total wash.  Anyway, I appreciate the links. Other good tools for file deduping include ""Yet Another Duplicate File Remover"" (on Windows) and ""fdupes"" (on Linux), in case you happen to be looking for alternatives to your suggestions."

If you did /home/me/Movies/{2015&Action}/ you'd display all the files in the Movies directory with the taggs 2015 and Action. And if you did /home/me/Movies/{2015|Action}/ you'd display all the files in the Movies directory with the taggs 2015 or Action.

Well.... fast forward a few hours, and I managed to snap the plastic L connector in my carelessness, as you can see in the pictures.    The pins are all fine, it's just the plastic L that has snapped off.    Naturally I'm already more or less about to push the buy button on another drive, as this is one 1 of 6 for a new RAID-Z2 array I'm creating. Not overly comfortable with using any bandaid fixes if it's going in an array.    I'm assuming this sort of thing isn't covered under warranty. Have you done this to yourself in the past? What did you do in the end?    It's a Toshiba 4TB drive if you're curious."

Literally order of 4+ drives from NewEgg has had at least one has been DOA. This leaves me with the choice of either a) paying to return them to NewEgg for replacement or b) paying to return to the manufacturer for replacement.  In contrast, every drive I've ordered from Amazon has arrived securely packaged in a box from the drive manufacturer, several of which are enclosed together in an Amazon box. None have been DOA, and I suspect that's related. I've also never had to pay Amazon to return any product that arrived damaged, and Amazon tends to overnight replacements, usually shipping a replacement before the original gets returned. That's been my experience, and that seems to be the case for OP.  I stopped buying hard drives from NewEgg a couple years ago, so things might be different now. (Or maybe not.) All I know is that I'm much happier with Amazon than NewEgg for /r/datahoarder–type orders."

So they sent another one, same problem.  Again I called them and reminded them on the horrible packaging.  The 3rd one they sent me was the same.

Then, use the remaining 1.5T on the 2T disk as a non-redundant btrfs. When you get more disks, just re-shuffle. Add the new disk to the raid1 500G volume, move the data from the 1.5T volume in, delete that partition, expand the 500G partition to 1.5T. Then you've got ... I don't know what you've got. You might have to add 2 disks when you want to actually make that swap. I think there are spiffy calculators that'll help.

DataHoarder,3ba9lb,RichSniper,6,Sat Jun 27 23:39:03 2015 UTC,"That's not what ""archive"" means in that context.  Seagate designated them as Archive HDDs because the SMR technology inside causes slow random rewrites. Sequential writing (ie adding new files) and intensive reads is not a problem at all."

I grabbed 2 of these for redundancy, and all my media goes onto them.  The only time I've felt the need for an ssd is for the OS and for plex home theater. The poster pictures on plex load almost instantly when they're cached on an ssd instead of a spinning disc."
DataHoarder,3ba9lb,brokenpistol,5,Sun Jun 28 06:56:16 2015 UTC,"You should backup your data if you are the slightest bit concerned about losing it. HDD or SSD can fail any time.   Other than that, using SSD for media storage isn't a common choice. The usage pattern doesn't really benefit from solid state, and, as noted, SSDs are significantly more expensive per TB. It would be better to use HDD and use the savings on backups."
DataHoarder,3ba9lb,ChrisTheRazer,5,Sat Jun 27 09:53:12 2015 UTC,"HDD or SSD can fail any time.    In my experience, when SSDs do fail, they kind of do it out of the blue with no impeding warnings. I had an old Kingston that I opened up, installed Linux, had no problems for a while, and the first reboot it was just straight up dead. Luckily I got a warranty replacement on it.  Contrast that to my hard drive failures, where all of them never just died, they would start having random slowdowns and read problems here and there. Not saying that they can't just die sporadically like an SSD can, I just don't think its as likely."
DataHoarder,3ba9lb,knightcrusader,1 point,Sat Jun 27 22:05:01 2015 UTC,"I agree with all that. They certainly die in different ways, the point I was wanting to emphasise was that either can die anytime, so data safety should be taken care of by backups, not by choice of HDD vs SSD."
DataHoarder,3ba9lb,ChrisTheRazer,3,Sat Jun 27 23:34:39 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's worth it...Disregarding price per gig, how many concurrent clients do you plan on having?  You can probably do like 6-8 (correct me if I'm wrong) concurrent HD streams with a standard 3.5"" HDD."
DataHoarder,3ba9lb,AlexMeanberg,2,Sat Jun 27 20:00:20 2015 UTC,in regards to using them on a nas for media sharing i would suggest going with spinning drives for right now. In the next couple of years that might be different.
DataHoarder,3ba9lb,sunburntsaint,3,Sat Jun 27 16:42:28 2015 UTC,SSDs degrade much faster than HDDs when not in use.  I'll see if I can dig up the actual facts but I believe it only takes a few months of being offline before the data on them starts to degrade.

DataHoarder,3b4x6f,WalkThePlanck,4,Fri Jun 26 07:45:40 2015 UTC,A thousand times yes. Fresh air must move over the heatsink. Not doing so can cause the card to misbehave or fail.  Get a fan moving air somehow or cut a hole in the top for ventilation.
DataHoarder,3b4x6f,SirMaster,3,Fri Jun 26 08:45:04 2015 UTC,Simple fix is attach a 40mm fan. The screws for one actually conveniently thread into the small black LSI stock heat sink and hold it in place well enough.
DataHoarder,3b4x6f,frugoo,3,Fri Jun 26 13:33:44 2015 UTC,I agree. I wouldn't run any device that has a passive heatsink without a fan to push air by it. These cards do run hot and from the one that I have... I'm scared that OP is going to start a fire.

DataHoarder,3b4x6f,ThatOnePerson,5,Fri Jun 26 14:48:26 2015 UTC,"So far Xpenology has been great. I already had an 5-bay Synology so I was familiar with DSM. Luckily, Xpenology is also at the same Synology DSM level now so I have both my DS1512 and this build on the exact same version. It made be a little more confident to export my Synology settings and import them  into Xpenology. Went well without a hitch. The actual Xpenology/DSM setup was a breeze too. It took all of <30 minutes"
DataHoarder,3b4x6f,dxm765,2,Fri Jun 26 15:08:20 2015 UTC,"Yea, the setup/install was indeed much easier than I expected, and that its running the official OS rather than a hacked version is even better. For those not familiar with it, the software you download mounts a filesystem/vm/something that fools the official OS into thinking your setup is a legit synology box and it then installs happily. It really does take less than 30 min.  I'd love it if Synology even sold/licensed the OS, I'd hapily pay $100 for a NAS os like theirs. FreeNAS, Open MediaVault, and the rest are fine an all, but they don't have that .... polish that Synology puts on.  My main concern is how about updates? The latest few updates added a lot of cool features (docker, for example). I've read on the forums that updating a major version is akin to a full reinstall."

That would give you 36TB usable and up to 4 drive failures before you lost data. (assuming 2 drives in each array.)"
DataHoarder,3b8m4l,iamcorvin,2,Fri Jun 26 22:19:18 2015 UTC,"I definitely wouldn't do a single array with that many drives. It sounds like it is stuff you can always get later, so I would do three raid5s with 5 drives each. That way you can have one drive from each fail and still be safe. But if two drives fail in the same array without replacement, you'll lose that data. Keep drive #16 to have ready to replace failed drive right away."
DataHoarder,3b8m4l,Cody994,1 point,Fri Jun 26 21:59:48 2015 UTC,RAID50 is for people who want higher performance while using SW RAID.  If one of the RAID5 goes down the whole array is hosed since it's striped.  Personally I prefer dual-parity for more reliable rebuilds so I'd go with RAID6.  My HW RAID card has roughly the same performance for RAID5 and RAID6 so I don't have performance issues.  I've been running RAID6 with 12~24 drives for almost a decade without issues.
DataHoarder,3b8m4l,Y0tsuya,1 point,Fri Jun 26 21:57:09 2015 UTC,If you want as much fault tolerance as possible. RAID 6 Is what you want. You are correct that two drives would have to fail in RAID 6. There are some triple parity setups if you wanted. I am not well researched in them though

The controllers make sure that the parity is in a different enclosure and connected to a different controller than the drive so you'd have to lose the drive and the drive with the parity to be in trouble.  Chances are very low.
DataHoarder,3b1xm2,pork_belly,6,Fri Jun 26 23:03:36 2015 UTC,If you lose 13TB going from RAID5 to RAID6 then you don't have a single large span. Probably something like a 9+2 config at a page level. Rebuild time should actually be pretty good.  But it sounds like you don't really know what you're doing other than taking a picture of a bunch of drives...  EDIT: This is actually pretty terrible. With 117TB raw you can just run RAID10 and have 73TB usable with WAAAAAAY better write performance.

DataHoarder,3b4zzw,knightcrusader,10,Fri Jun 26 00:45:10 2015 UTC,"Some miss information in this thread.  First to answer you question, No ECC is not required. I ran a Freenas server for a year on old ddr2 and it was fine (it was a 3TB zpool). It is recommend since ZFS only controls data on a volume and cant account for errors in memory.  Also there are different types of memory.   Standard memory is typically called Unbuffered Non-ECC because it has no error correction/detection. ECC is an addon for standard ram, it ads a parity bit for every byte to identify multiple bit errors and correct single bit errors. Registered (no such thing as ""buffered"") Ram is typically seen on motherboards with large sets of ram banks. Traditionally the memory controller would supply both the power and commands to the memory modules, but as more modules are added this increased the power load on the memory controller. so they shifted the power deliver to the modules and moved the memory registers to the modules, though adding extra clock cycles, too. On top of that it allow this allows for the memory controller to run cooler and efficient. it also added ecc and more control of data integrity. Fully Buffered Ram is basically Registered ram on steroids. Until FBDIMMs all the data was sent parallel to the memory module via dedicated pins, with FBDIMMs its sent serial and can use the same circuits for multiple banks of modules allowing for less circuitry and extremely high bandwidths. Also more of the memory controller was offloaded on to the modules."
DataHoarder,3b4zzw,omega552003,2,Fri Jun 26 03:12:06 2015 UTC,"If I remember correctly, FBDIMM is only supported in Intel systems. AMD was going to support it, but then dropped it in favor of the G3MX, but then canceled it in favor of busses with narrower channels and higher speeds."
DataHoarder,3b4zzw,scriptmonkey420,2,Fri Jun 26 12:50:26 2015 UTC,This is the best brief description of ECC RAM and related terms I have ever read. Thanks!

DataHoarder,3b4zzw,nDQ9UeOr,12,Fri Jun 26 17:23:16 2015 UTC,"ZFS isn't any more or less vulnerable to memory flips than any other filesystem. Said another way, it doesn't take advantage of ECC in a way any other filesystem wouldn't as well. ZFS doesn't actually know if you're using ECC or not.  The reason you always see ECC recommended for ZFS is because ZFS has a lot of data integrity safeguards, and people tend to think ZFS is great for data integrity. And it is. But it has a blind spot in what happens in memory, just like any other filesystem.  Any RAM will work with ZFS. The use of ECC is recommended for any system where you care about data integrity. Unbuffered ECC is fine for systems where you don't have gobs and gobs of RAM."
DataHoarder,3b4zzw,nDQ9UeOr,3,Fri Jun 26 01:22:55 2015 UTC,"Okay, that makes sense. I've read that it's ""looked down upon"" using non-ECC memory because of the problems it could cause compared to using ECC, and some people down right refuse to help debug a problem if you use non-ECC, so I was just trying to avoid as many issues as I could.  But, I get what you are saying. So as I see it, what I have is not as good as going fully buffered, but its at least one step better than using normal desktop memory."
DataHoarder,3b4zzw,Balmung,3,Fri Jun 26 01:59:40 2015 UTC,Registered really just provides the CPU with the ability to address more memory than it could otherwise. Unbuffered still has the same error correction.
DataHoarder,3b4zzw,NastyEbilPiwate,2,Fri Jun 26 02:16:23 2015 UTC,"First, unregistered is the same thing as unbuffered and same with registered/buffered.  Next, that has nothing to do with the OS. Basically a ELI5 from what I understand is the CPU normally talks directly to RAM, but it can only talk to so many sticks without problems. So to be able to add more sticks than the CPU can handle they have a middle man, which is where registered comes into play. Don't know all the details about how buffered/registered works, but it has some component on the board that directly communicates with multiple sticks of RAM then the CPU talks to the registers to allow far more total RAM capacity.  Then the whole 1GB/TB does not apply to home NAS's. That is for businesses with many concurrent users. You would be perfectly fine with 8GB total for unlimited storage. Now more RAM is always helpful, but it has very demising returns for home use so really it's not a big deal."

I.e. every top level directory has this ""suffix"" of sorts. This is also how I decided to back-up stuff:   must keep -- 3-2-1 (3 copies, 2 media types, 1 off-site) ok - has at least one copy ""first to delete"" may or may not have a copy (and it is ok) :-)   Over time you'd learn/adjust what goes to ok vs. delete category and makes it easier on your hoarding side, because you don't need to decide to delete stuff on daily basis (it literally hurts :-) ). But on those rare days when space is short and resolve is high -- you can rip the bandage with the least pain and suffering.  There is usually not a question whether stuff should go to ""must keep"" or not - you just know. The weakness here is to put 90% into ""ok"", which is not ok (pun intended). In this case you may introduce something like first and second to delete, but don't go too crazy - many categories are hard to maintain / remember. I also leave readme files to remind me the rationale for creating a category, but I found that over time you want to consolidate stuff and have less folders/categories if possible.

I have a limited number of SATA ports and mounting spots and if I am going to use an available SATA port or back plane, it'll be for a drive much larger than a 250GB or 500GB drive if I can help it.  If I want to lend the collection to a trusted friend, it's much easier to hand them a box of DVD's half the size of a loaf of bread instead of pulling a delicate drive out of my file server and loaning them that.  Writing 235GB spread across several flash drives would probably take a week and I'm not loaning out any of my external drives and I don't like other people's external drives being plugged in to my file server.  I made the mistake of allowing a friend to plug his external into my file server once.  Once.  Now, if they want to connect their storage devices to my network, it's via a Linux LiveCD on a computer that does not have it's own hard drive and they can connect to my network that way and pull files to their external drive.

It will fail you when you need it the most (like when you actually need it to do its job and rebuild).  Use a good SW RAID or a proper HW RAID.  A decent RAID solution would still let you recover most of your data even after multiple failures during rebuild.  unRAID, SnapRAID, FlexRAID, ZFS, and most REAL HW RAIDs can do this.  Again don't use BIOS RAID."
DataHoarder,3b52g5,Y0tsuya,1 point,Fri Jun 26 02:43:05 2015 UTC,"Is the reason to avoid the BIOS RAID the increased recovery options if your array fails a rebuild?  I have used the onboard RAID in many builds and only had issues when upgrading the mobo BIOS without thinking.  However, I just rebuilt the array exactly like I did the first time and it was all there.  I have been looking at expensive hardware RAID cards from LSI and I just haven't spent the $700ish I feel like I would have to to get a nice one.  I would love to hear more of your thoughts.  I am getting ready to redo some of my arrays and if going to a software solution will make me happier, then I am at an opportune time to make the switch."

I have never been successful because the system would complain about the HDD being too small, even though the spare drive was the same model purchased at the same time.  I've always had to make a new array instead.  So now I stick with HW RAID and sometimes SW RAID mentioned above.  If current-gen RAID cards are too expensive, look into past-gen surplus cards.  They're perfectly capable, just a bit slower than the newest-and-bestest.  For example I'm still running 3ware 9650se cards.  They are very capable and reliable.

DataHoarder,3b52g5,Th3AntiNoob,2,Sun Jul 19 19:45:34 2015 UTC,"Write-back caching requires a BBU.  Having a UPS won't do anything.  The BBU greatly boosts performance and the write-back caching essentially eliminates any RAID penalty people have talked about.  So you get pretty much the same performance for RAID5 or RAID6.  Perfomrance consistency is important for enterprise customers so you get it with the BBU.  Also, if you accidentally trip the power or press the reset button, even while the array is busy, after you reboot it will continue like nothing happened since everything is still preserved inside the card RAM.  The battery you found is compatible across the 96xx line.  However the BBU is a small card that attaches to the RAID card.  You will need to find a BBU-MODULE-03 or BBU-MODULE-04.  MODULE-04 I think just has an extra mounting bracket and battlery cable extension.  But alas I can't find any good deals on BBUs right now.  A while ago I remember seeing somebody blowing them out at $20/pop.  These used to go for $100+ new so you have to decide what's a good deal.  Sometimes if you buy a used server pull, the BBU is already attached.  For example like this:  http://www.ebay.com/itm/AMCC-LSI-3WARE-9690SA-4I-4E-700-3406-01L-with-Battery-3190-03B-BBU-Module03-04-/181795187571  Or maybe wait a bit to see if any deals pop up."

It is the 9650SE and the model you linked is a 9690SA.  If I went with this would I be solid performace/realiablity-wise with mechanical hard drives?

DataHoarder,3b52g5,Th3AntiNoob,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:46:57 2015 UTC,"Well you probably want to get a new battery but aside from that it looks pretty good.  If uptime is important to you, get a spare card so keep looking for deals.  The array you make will be compatible across all 9650se and newer models (such as the 9750) so you have some flexibility on the spare.  I get up to ~400MB RAID5/6 read/write using ATTO benchmark so I'm quite satisfied with the performance.  Sure there are faster cards around but I know this works and I know I can buy it cheap.  Remember to go to LSI website and grab the latest FW, driver, and web management UI (called 3DM2).  The FW can be updated at the DOS prompt but you can also do it through the Web UI which is easier.  So my recommendation is to install the driver and Web UI first, then update the FW.  If you get confused on what to grab let me know and I can help out.  Remember FW with these things are backward-compatible but not the other way around.  So if you initialize an array with older FW, it will work with newer FW but may lack some features like smart rebuild.  I've purchased maybe 10 of these used cards and I've hit one dud so far.  I chucked it in the closet and waited a few months before trying it.  The seller was pretty understanding and I ended up with a partial refund.  But to avoid issues with used HW remember to test it ASAP."

Basically, raid6 = raid5 when things get rough, and you can't always repair instantly.  Also, I'm not even raid6, I'm raidz2 on freebsd. Outside of a bad drive that spoiled the bunch it's been solid ever since.   ust so I can say I asked.. double drive failure during a rebuild constitutes an unrecoverable data loss event, yes? I'm hoping the answer is NO so that I can avoid the massive pain in the ass this is, but I am no moron.   Define failure, you mean it dropped out of raid, or you mean the drive is clicking repeatedly? If it dropped out you might be able to recover (depending on your raid implementation), if the drive is 'gone', then yeah it's game over."

I had the option to 'mark as normal' the failed drive and then to try reinitializing/restoring the RAID volume. The initialization is at 35% right now.    I may know by Sunday if I am able to recover anything. It gives me a few days to mull over re-rolling or just gambling on new higher capacity drives in the same rig. Either way, my wallet shall suffer."

I think there are some linux projects that attempt to understand and read proprietary motherboard raids. I'd wager that Intel is in the top of the lists since they'd be so prevalent. If you know exactly the order of the disks and if the motherboard raid allows you to initialize an array w/o wiping it, you might just be able to ""create"" a new array w/ the exact parameters and disk locations, but w/o letting it be scrubbed or wiped. I've done this 2-3 times using Linux's md, the key is knowing the exact parameters used to create and the disk order. Thankfully, w/ md you can query a single working disk and get virtually all of it. Then you can re-combine them and try to mount the file system, if that failed, re-create w/ another order and try again. In most cases, I knew the order of say 3/5 disks, so trial and error only took 2-3 attempts."

I run a 24 disk array with 4 parity drives on one of my servers. I could run 4 drives with 20 parity drives if I wanted. Rebuild times are significantly faster than traditional RAID as well. Also native file system is left in tact so even if somehow the array is completely lost (which I'm not sure how that could happen) you still have the data that is stored on the healthy drives."

For laptops/desktops, SSDs all the way, the additional speed for apps and on boot is a huge plus, additionally no one should be storing terabytes of data on their local machines, so small <200GB drives are way more than enough for 90% of our workforce, and <500GB for like 99%. I however would be cautious about arguing that it'll ""increase productivity"" because I can tell you most people aren't sitting at 100% output waiting for their computer to do stuff, and I don't want the business coming back asking me why we're not making more money because we bought SSDs -- it simply makes people happier and is cheap enough that we can easily roll it into build-out cost.  For servers, they're all virtualized and backed by numerous multi-terabyte 7.2k spinning drives + SSD flash cache tier get us the ability to store/archive the amount of data our users want to keep around forever without breaking the bank, and still allow us to keep ""hot"" data where we can access it stupidly fast (averaging <1ms latency, not that the old ~10ms latency on 10k only was killing us though).  Funny enough at work -- capacity has been a problem over throughput, we've had downtime over capacity issues... Though flash-cache tiering allows us to have the best of both worlds.  For home, ZFS + a fairly large ARC (60GB) is working as a good enough data tiering system for 21 VMs on 2 mirrored disks (the 3TB in my flair), going to throw at least a small SSD for SLOG at some point in there, 88.5% cache hit rate.  Home desktops: I'm still on the fence, due to all the games and whatnot I'm looking at about $400/drive * 2 computers. Games have been increasing in size about as fast as SSDs have been getting cheaper, I've been hovering at spending $400 to get on SSDs for years now.

Additionally there are lots of issues with it (delete a LUN that had 2TB of data on it, I dare you, even with 192GB of RAM the Solaris box still froze for about a minute, for just a small 2TB LUN! And the space savings was not nearly as good as what we got from compression).

The only kicker is it's not inline, so if you're storing tons of data and need it to dedupe you can run into issues where you're not deduping fast enough, though that is unlikely (and of course the solution is more storage... at least to the point of saturation of the dedupe window).

DataHoarder,3axy7p,eleitl,8,Wed Jun 24 12:23:05 2015 UTC,right but reliable as long as you keep a power source attached to them? I thought if you kept a SSD unpowered for a few weeks/months you start getting data loss?

If you're wanting offline storage that you can store for long periods of time then you're better off with a hard drive or even tape.

DataHoarder,3axy7p,eleitl,8,Wed Jun 24 12:33:17 2015 UTC,"SDDs have not bitten me yet.   That's anecdotal.  You may be comfortable in your situation with the data you have to make the call to not run redundancy on any set of drives, regardless of their underlying physical makeup.  If it were healthcare data, you would be borderline a criminal for not running a RAID, and positively stupid for it.  However, for a PVR backend for liveTV serving to a bunch of clients in say...a  hospitality facility?  See, now who cares if you lose some TV data of recorded shows/rewind data for active viewed channels - that would be an instance that RAID would be borderline unnecessary cost.  It all depends on the situation.  Nothing is absolute, and the longer I am an admin, the more my answers to technical questions usually end it... ""but it really depends on your environment, people, industry, etc""  I know you stated ""It is a question of how much downtime you can tolerate in the worst case"", but your comments after that lead me to believe you threw your own warning to the wind saying that your system hasn't had to activate your spares yet.

I guess I was just pointing out that saying SSD's are more reliable than HDD's isn't an entirely false statement, but relying on that theory to build out a storage array of any kind is misguided.  You have to adjust your strategies for the hardware being deployed, and OP says basically he setup his SSD's just like he would HDD's and nothing has gone south yet - ipso facto, it's legit to say they are more reliable.

I have 1TB between two 500gig SSDs in my desktop...it runs like a dream in comparison to my last disk drive (but it wasn't an amazing disk drive anyways, so I'm seriously asking with this comment, not just being anecdotal)"
DataHoarder,3axy7p,LusT4DetH,8,Thu Jun 25 03:37:55 2015 UTC,"This might be true of the average consumer, but in the enterprise environment, SSD's are starting to reign supreme based on IOPs, not raw capacity or cents per gb.   I have already replaced all of my companies SQL data storage with SSDs (admittedly at a higher cost, but worth it for the IOP gain) instead of 10K/15K SAS as our IOP needs outpaced our raw capacity needs a long time ago. If I was to continue to buy 10K SAS (most major disk makers have discontinued new 15K drives based on drive density) I'd literally have to buy spindles and let space go to waste to cover my IOP needs. It also eliminated the need to replicate production databases nightly to even more mechanical drives to keep the reporting IOPs off the main production arrays. With SSD's, using a snapshot to give to the reporting folks instead of a complete replica on different disk is painless because I have 50K IOPs instead of 5K, so an actual snapshot doesn't impact my production environment IOPwise.   In my world, price/IOP is the metric now, not price/gb. And SSD owns that metric outright."
DataHoarder,3axy7p,miraj31415,5,Wed Jun 24 13:57:34 2015 UTC,"SQL is often a performance-driven application, which is why $/IOPS is the metric to use. But surely you have enterprise applications that don't require high performance storage where $/GB is the more relevant metric. Stuff like standalone file + print servers, or backup data?"
DataHoarder,3axy7p,LusT4DetH,5,Wed Jun 24 15:55:13 2015 UTC,"Sure, our vmware datastores are still on big sata arrays, but even that can't keep up with the IOP demand for much longer. I literally have TB's of space laying idle, because the array is already maxed out on IOPs. I can't even buy smaller enterprise class SATA disks anymore, 2TB is the smallest I can buy, of which I might use 500gb per disk. There are disks in the array that basically just add IOPs to the pool rather than capacity and that is horribly inefficient. It won't be long before we look to convert those SATA arrays to SSD as well. If I need 8500 iops, I'd need 100 2TB sata disks (plus parity disks) and I'd only be able to use 25% of the raw capacity, or 50TB. Or, I can buy half the amount of SSD drives and use all of the space, and have IOPs to burn. I can make up the price differential by having the extra IOPs in my environment. Not to mention, the SSD drive shelves are half the size, take less power, and require less cooling.   I'm not saying mechanical drives are over and done, but I am saying that in an enterprise environment, rather than ""laptop use"", SSD's are gaining adoption faster than this article would lead you to believe. For a one time upfront cost and standard maintenance costs (difference between budgets), I get to tap that performance 24/7, all day every day. In business, there are environments (like mine) that can take advantage of this, and when you do, you recoup all of those upfront costs in an amazingly short time. In my line of work, SSD's are more efficient  We use the old mechanical drives as part of a layered backup strategy, because low iop use is all we can use them for these days."

When you're spending between $8,000 and $15,000 for most servers the difference of a couple hundred bucks for an SSD is negligible. They are already way beyond HDD reliability and as rapidly as they are being adopted price will continue to decrease at a fast pace. Most data centers just don't even consider HDDs anymore. There are way too many failures to deal with. When you're managing a data center with thousands of servers you basically have a tech dedicated to replacing HDDs.

For a data center you often have a IOPS > price/capacity. You'll often sacrifice price and or capacity for performance. You also have shared storage as well coming into play. Buying a SAN full of solid state is a very cost effective way of purchasing enterprise SSD storage. Are you going to pack a VTL full of SSDs at their current price point? Of course not. But honestly at the rate of cost reduction we are currently seeing that could definitely be a possibility in the next couple of years. Samsung is talking about bringing 10TB drives to market at very competitive prices and at that point it's going to be a no brainer.  For a consumer you have to factor in that it's a one time purchase and for most people they don't need storage. They need an OS with a couple extra GB for docs, a few pictures and maybe some mp3s. $70 for a 120GB is more than enough for most people and it costs the same or less than the typical 500GB or 1TB you typically find in laptops/PCs that will have 98% free space for the entire life of the PC."

This is assuming HDD technology stays stagnant - which is always a bad assumption in any tech-related area. Samsung may be talking about bringing 10TB SSDs to market, but 10TB HDDs already exist. By the time 10TB SSDs are released at competitive prices today, HDD prices would have dropped further.  I don't deny that SSDs are gaining in popularity. But to say that HDDs are ""effectively extinct"" is going too far. Sure, the average desktop/laptop user will be satisfied with a 512GB/1TB SSD. But look at most of us in /r/datahoarder.

As far as the automation goes, I think your best bet is probably whip up a small shell script to drive morituri. Thanks to its command line interface, you should be able to get away with a small loop that rips the CD, ejects the disc, then waits for the user to swap in a new disc:  #! /bin/bash  OFFSET=`rip offset find` echo Your drive offset is $OFFSET.  while true:     rip cd rip --offset $OFFSET     eject     echo Insert the next disc and then press Enter.     read   That's just hypothetical. I'm not sure about the output of rip offset find; if it doesn't output just the integer offset, then you'll need to parse it from the output. And there might be some other flags to the rip command so you can specify the CD drive to use, enabling you to run multiple instances of the script to use multiple drives and rip multiple CDs at once.  Your CD drive will also have a surprisingly large impact on the rip speed. Old Plextor drives are about the best thing going, and the newer LG drives are some of the worst. I bought a used Plextor PX-712UF which worked great, but really, if you've got the time, try a few different drives and see what works for you. When you're ripping that many discs, even the difference of a minute or two in ripping speed can add up to a whole lot of time."
DataHoarder,3azoq5,MrDOS,3,Wed Jun 24 20:57:02 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your fantastic answer MrDOS, as I'm new to this I hadn't even considered rip fidelity.  Well my main rig runs Windows 10, and must for gaming, I have a single SSD as boot drive and I'm not willing to dual-boot it. My laptop runs Crunchbang (Debian based distro), but has an E350 in it that will add a huge bottleneck, so I have two questions for you:  How CPU bound is ripping? How much of a toll would CPU visualization take?  How multithreaded is mortiuri? How RAM heavy is it?  See what I'm thinking of doing now is having a plain debian distro in a VM and allocating it 6 cores and 12GBs of RAM running that script with the CD drives mounted onto it. I'd run Mortiuri with that script and rip all onto my storage drive which I'd share with the VM. Can you see any gaping holes in this plan?"
DataHoarder,3azoq5,fryfrog,4,Wed Jun 24 21:48:42 2015 UTC,"CPU and disk usage are going to be trivial, it is all going to be the speed (and accuracy) of your cd reader and how quickly you can swap out disks.  If I were doing this, I'd spend a little time and make an Arduino robot of some sort. Trigger it off the tray ejecting and you can use the pseudo script /u/MrDOS posted. Tray ejects, bumps button, robot takes disk out, toss is it onto a pile, grabs another disk and drops it in the tray. Get that working and just use one drive, let it run until it finishes and check up on it every once in a while.  If you want to use Windows, EAC is a great program. I have no idea how you could script it, but it'd be worth investigating. Don't forget to make sure your ripper is also getting good metadata! :)"
DataHoarder,3azoq5,fryfrog,2,Wed Jun 24 23:40:40 2015 UTC,"xD I love you guys so much oh my. I mean, I had never thought of even writing a quick script, I thought there would be a windows-based program to do that for me, but build an Arduino robot? xD Ahahaha I think it's a wonderful idea, but a little out of my capacity cost-wise, time-wise, and skill wise ;) I'm thinking that the tolerances in that robot would need to be TIGHT to enable it to handle 500 CDs without a hitch, even on spindles or similar.  I'm no great fan of windows honestly, I've already a few Crunchbang/Debian VMs lying around for development/etc - I'll use one of those. Thank you so much for your advice! I'm gonna spend a while shopping for accurate, fast, cheap cd readers (for all the likeliness that something's gonna tick all those boxes -.-). Also I'll be sure to gather metadata for all of the CDs and write it all out before I rip :)"
DataHoarder,3azoq5,1337Gandalf,2,Wed Jun 24 23:59:45 2015 UTC,"You'd just solve accuracy in the hardware of the little robot. Like, if you're poking something into the spindle hole... make it a cone. That way it self centers. If you're using some fingers to grab the disk, just make sure they open much further than needed and close to grab. I'm not sure how I'd do it, but I'd certainly spend a day or two considering it.  If you figure 5 minutes per disk, 500 disks is a 40 hour work week. Spending a day thinking about and making something that could do 5-10 hour stretches w/o needing a human is going to get you a pretty big return.  An Arduino is cheap, certainly as cheap as one of the 5 cd readers you're considering. Servos are cheap too. Make it from scrap plastic and wood, throw it away when you're done. Use old writable cd/dvd spindles. Make it from trash.  Anyway, the real solutions is to just use something like Headphones and download it instead. I'm sure it feels good to be doing it the ""right"" way... but why bother? If you can't download it, then spend time ripping the 10 or 20 disks you couldn't find."

DataHoarder,3azoq5,dwhite21787,1 point,Sat Jun 27 21:39:17 2015 UTC,"Linux isn't only the way to go here. I mostly mentioned it without thinking because a lot of us run Linux anyway for our storage boxen. You can get the same result from running several parallel EAC instances on Windows.  Ripping itself isn't terribly CPU-bound; a constant stream of data coming off the disc should only run up a few percent on one core. Encoding is a different matter: audio encoding is by and large a purely linear process that will burn basically 100% of one core for the duration of the encoding. In terms of RAM consumption, I dunno; maybe a couple hundred megs tops per ripper instance?  To back up a step, CD ripping is basically comprised of two (or three) steps: before ripping starts, the program fetches metadata for the entire CD; then each track is ripped as lossless, uncompressed PCM (WAV) data; and each track is encoded to a storage format (FLAC, MP3, etc.). Usually, the encoding of each track takes place immediately after it's been ripped, so the process breaks down to a stream of rip-encode-rip-encode-rip-encode steps. Each step has different performance characteristics: metadata fetching is limited mostly by drive speed but is pretty fast overall, ripping is dominated by disc throughput, and encoding is totally CPU-bound. Storage speed doesn't really play into it in my experience. In general, though, as /u/fryfrog says, you're going to be primarily bottlenecked at disc throughput, as the encoding steps won't take too long (ripping with a decent drive might occur at 8-9x audio playback speed, whereas FLAC encoding on a moderate CPU is usually in the 20-30x range).  Your proposed VM solution might or might not be OK, and will depend greatly on the level of control over the CD drives delegated by the hypervisor to the virtual machine. Accurate CD ripping requires a fine degree of control over the behaviour of the CD drive, and if the hypervisor tries to emulate that in any way or adds any sort of caching layer between the physical drive and the VM, you may end up with issues. I don't know if this is actually a problem or not; I've never tried. But it's the sort of thing you'd really want to look into before you embark down that path. Before you bother, I'd highly suggest investigating whether or not you can just pull this off with multiple EAC instances. It's not as scriptable (alright, it's not scriptable at all as far as I know), but it would probably be easier to set up and more foolproof."
DataHoarder,3azoq5,dwhite21787,2,Thu Jun 25 00:37:59 2015 UTC,"Using a VM is another step in the chain and hence another point of failure, given the option I'll use a windows equivalent. I'll look into EAC, and try to achieve what I want on a small scale before scaling it up. I'm gonna say that I could comfortably scale this process up to six CDs at one (six drives, six usb three ports, 6*300MB=1.8GB RAM, six cores for encoding) and see what I can find as regards to CD Drives now."
DataHoarder,3azoq5,nemothorx,4,Thu Jun 25 12:18:22 2015 UTC,"Yes, I've done that. I used Ubuntu on a Dell latitude laptop, ripping from the internal cd drive to an SSD HD. The SSD brought me the greatest increase - ripping a cd takes 2/3 the time than to a 7200 HD.   I wrote a custom script that polled the mounted devices, saw when a disc was inserted, started ripping, and ejected on completion, halting on any warnings. It took a few minutes per cd, as the script also generated SHAs of the FLACs for fixity. It also let me enter some metadata - artist and album - because THAT is the bitch in doing this task. I wrote it so it could function with multiple devices, but never used it that way.   I think it would be faster to just straight copy the WAVs from the media, and farm out the conversion to background jobs, than rip FLAC from the media. If you have a 4 or 8 core machine, I really think that's the way to go."

I used Dbpoweramp which can be automated like you describe. Just set it up and feed it discs.  At the time I used I think 2 optical drives, maybe 3. Whatever I had at the time. Even on a system of the era, the optical drives were the bottleneck. Even the fastest drives only rip CDs at single digit MB/s.  dB rips to wav in ram (unless you opt to save it), verifies against an accurip database and begins encoding to FLAC as soon as the first track is ripped. And FLAC encoding is pretty fast. So even as you're still ripping the disc it's encoding just a track or two behind you provided your CPU is decent.   My recollection is that I was ripping a disc in 3 or 4 minutes and the final track of the disc was encoded by the time I had swapped in a new one. I just ran one instance for each optical drive and the real bottleneck was my attention span...browsing in the background and just not noticing a disc had finished etc.  It's a paid app but I believe there's a functional trial.

DataHoarder,3ay74s,tarzan23,5,Wed Jun 24 13:26:54 2015 UTC,SnapRAID is ideal for data that doesn't change often. Like a media collection. I believe the underlying data stays in tact like it does with FlexRAID so that is a huge benefit. If you lost a disk and fail to rebuild parity you still only lose the data on that failed disk instead of the entire array like you will with RAID5/6.   The only reason I would ever use RAID6 is if I needed the performance. At that point I wouldn't be using software RAID either.

Further, snapraid's file integrity protection / ""bit rot protection"" relies on memory integrity, which is not given on my system (no ECC RAM)... edit: but this is a more general problem, in retrospect I should have gone for a system capable of handling ECC memory. Further, pooling drives with snapraid is not straightforward, see my comments on mhddfs, aufs and so on below.  The only benefit I see for snapraid is that the contents of an array are not entirely lost when more drives fail then the system was designed to handle.

Sure it's ideal to have ECC RAM but plenty of people use even ZFS without ECC and don't have any issues.  As far as FlexRAID going out of business... that's a valid concern. As far as I know it's still just Brahim doing all the coding. I'm using a pretty old version of RAID-F though. I don't plan on upgrading. I don't make changes to my server. So they company could go out of business today and it wouldn't impact me. I could always switch to something else if that happened as well. OpenSource projects also run the risk of being abandoned.   If these things are truly a concern to you then my best advise would be to upgrade your hardware with ECC compatible components, get some ECC RAM and go with FreeNAS or roll your own BSD with ZFS."

You are right about that, I might be overthinking this, and I agree that open-source projects can be abandoned. That is why I am hesitant to use SNAPRaid as well. In contrast, I think the Linux kernel has enough support to make sure it will be maintained for a while.  Regarding memory, I ran memtest yesterday just to make sure everything is fine and what do you know, memtest (legacy) found errors. The newer close-source memtest, which boots using UEFI, however found no errors... turns out that there seems to be a bug in the Asrock Board's UEFI implementation: Memory areas  not masked using e820 kept changing after control had been handed over to the OS, which should not be possible. This could indicate a bug in Asrock's UEFI implementation or in memtest. Since clearing the UEFI settings and reconfiguring everything solved this issue for now (no errors in memtest) my educated guess is a bug in the UEFI firmware, which makes me nervous."

If it's not a good idea to add them to the same pool then I won't do that. My question line was more tied to where the risk lies -- at the vdev level or at the pool level. Ultimately it sounds like the reason you use a higher Z level is to protect the individual vdev as the data is striped across vdevs.  Also not opposed to using mirrors as that's a lot easier to scale out in the future. Would just double my cost up front to do 6TB drives instead of 4TB. But if what you're saying is true where it doesn't make sense to mix and match drive sizes in the vdev then it might make sense to have 6TBs now so that in the future when drive prices come down for 6TBs the new vdevs would match."
DataHoarder,3avfbk,fryfrog,2,Tue Jun 23 21:45:15 2015 UTC,"If you're going for space and (relative) safety, rather than high performance - I'd  go for a bigger RAIDZ2, rather than RAIDZ1 + another RAIDZ1 in the future.

DataHoarder,3avfbk,fryfrog,2,Tue Jun 23 22:10:25 2015 UTC,"So I suppose the decision is to buy 6x 4TB disks up front for a RAIDZ2, or 4x 6TB disks and use a mirror instead.  $954 6x4TB = 16TB Usable $995 4x6TB = 12TB Usable  Resilvering will be better on the mirrors than on the RAIDZ2s. Similar price points but 4 more usable TBs of space in the RAIDZ pool."
DataHoarder,3avfbk,fryfrog,4,Tue Jun 23 22:18:31 2015 UTC,"If you reuse old drives, I would use them as a mirror to a new one. That way if they fail close to each other, you'll have your new drives from a different batch mirroring the data until you can get replacement drives.  For example: I have 9x 3TB drives: 4 are about 2 years old, 2 of which have failed and are going in for RMA (they were from the same order, where the other two were random purchases). When I get them back in, I will set up a RAID 10 like this with ZFS:   vdev1: old drive + new drive, mirrored vdev2: old drive + new drive, mirrored vdev3: rma drive + new drive, mirrored vdev4: rma drive + new drive, mirrored   Then pool all those vdevs together to make one big 12TB pool. If the remaining 2 old drives fail, then I have new drives mirroring it to lower the risk of data loss. IF at some point in the future all 4 of the new ones die near each other, then hopefully the 4 mismatched batch drives will be okay until the dead 4 can be replaced.  TL;DR: Make sure to match drives in your vdev with ones from different batches, old or new."

The parity drive is only read when you're checking parity (monthly), or rebuilding after a failure.  Writes happen when something changes.  In normal use the speed of the parity drive will have absolutely no impact on the array speed.  Even using something like a WD Blue for your cache will see normal network speeds.  I used to use a bog-standard 500GB 2.5"" Blue (the 5400rpm one) and it was happy to do 100MB/s both ways.

DataHoarder,3arhl5,bitcasual,2,Wed Jun 24 08:54:28 2015 UTC,"If 'circuit card' means 'circuit board', he's not talking about those kinds of transistors. He's talking about logic gates in a processor. If you were talking about the processor itself, they could make a processor the size of a table if they wanted to, but to get any performance out of it, it would have to be massively multi-core and have (expensive) per core registers and/or cache. To make a processor fast, you really need the electrons to not have to travel very large distances. Electrons may move through a conductive material at close to the speed of light, but every time they interact with a logic gate, there is a state change, which slows them down.   If we switched to carbon processors now, we'd probably get about a dozen years more of per-core speed-ups. By the end of that period, I think we might actually have useful quantum computers."
DataHoarder,3arhl5,RedditorJemi,20,Fri Jun 26 07:52:21 2015 UTC,"""SSD Prices in a Free Fall"" suggests that they are currently in a free-fall. The article is not about this, however. The article is this guy predicting the future based on a couple things he heard about 3D NAND potential.  Meanwhile, in the non-hyped articles:  The author notes that Sandisk has upcoming 8TB drives later this year. These are actually SAS Enterprise drives with no consumer drives announced.  3D NAND is currently used and I don't believe it has made a major impact on prices at this time.  Density of Micron-Intel's new memory is not much higher than Samsung's current.  This article overviews how initial costs to manufacture with the new technology in bulk will be costly.  Same as above. Different article.  I just think the author is completely blowing out of proportion the immediate potential in the market. Yes, the technology does allow for greater capacities. But his article would be like someone writing an article about helium HDDs in 2013 and that ""omg now drives are in a free-fall"" (just like the author of this article is pissing me off with his misleading tenses). Let's use helium drives as an example:  2013: HGST announces the technology and releases an expensive enterprise-class drive  2015: Here and at the current time of writing, it appears the drives you can readily buy on the market with the technology now are still only enterprise drives  So what's really more likely? More likely we will have a situation where this new technology will find itself in the enterprise market for a year or five before trickling down into consumer drives as production costs lessen and initial costs are paid for, more or less. The article makes it sound like this will revolutionize the SSD market. It won't. It's just another significant advancement that will increase capacity and reduce prices over the long-run. Or perhaps I'm just cynical because I've been waiting for inexpensive consumer OLED TVs since I first heard about the technology in 2009?  I'm sorry. I had to write a big thing because this author really pisses me off with his hype, bad tense usage, misleading article and lack of citations (not saying the facts he put in are wrong, just saying he didn't cite them).  Also read what /u/cluckcluck said about the authors uncited bullshit about HDD capacity development and to further expand on the Helium example."

The problem with HDDs is they're already well into single-digit margins, so there really isn't room to go lower in price without big changes in manufacturing to reduce costs (or dramatic increases in capacity to decrease the price-per-gigabyte).  Meanwhile flash just keeps dropping lower and lower, the suggestion being that they will not only catch up with hard drives on price-per-gigabyte, but then drop lower than them, with hard drives unable to keep up.  As for vaccuum tubes, they are awesome. Kind of like hard disks actually.

DataHoarder,3arhl5,rarebit13,1 point,Wed Jun 24 13:37:33 2015 UTC,"We've been hearing this for at least a year. I'm not saying that it won't happen but I'm willing to bet it'll be at least 5 years for 2 reasons:    1) HDDs are having a harder time getting bigger. Even now we're not getting much beyond 4TB without SMR    2) Pricing is dropping on SSDs but based on the price history it won't drop by that much in the next 6 months. We're still barely seeing 1TB(ish) SSDs on the market let alone 2TB SSDs. Currently a random 240GB SSD is $100. A 960GB SSD is $400.    A 1TB 2.5in HDD (for the sake of comparison for sizing) is $120. That's over 1/3 less the price. I HIGHLY doubt pricing is going to (let alone able to) nose dive by that sort of margin in that short of a period.   Now... if we were to compare to something like a VelociRaptor, then I could see it. Mostly because a VelociRaptor is $300. I could see a 25% drop in current pricing by the end of the year.     Don't get me wrong. I'd LOVE to see SSD pricing hit HDD pricing. But I'm not holding my breath for 2016. Or even 2017. 2018? Maybe. 2019? Probably a good chance.

Do you expect to have a computer that will have the SATA connection for that drive 15 years from now? 15 years ago, much of our current computer technology didn't exist. If you took any kind of contemporary storage from 15 years ago and wanted to read it today, you'd have to get matching technology or external dongle/adapters to make it useable. My company has every generation of LTO tape for our entire history of backups, and we have to keep tape drives and old servers/computers in storage in case we ever need them again. It's just not realistic to say current technology has a shelf life of 15 years, so therefore rely on it lasting that long. The rest of technology is going to keep moving."

SSD's seem to just work until they don't. Are the companies getting better at identifying when a drive is about to poop it, or do we always have to have our data backed up? I understand the point of RAID and backups for important things, but I can't expect a consumer to run two drives in their machine just in the off chance that their main takes a shit."

As you probably already know Google Drive and OneDrive are sync clients.  If you want to LIVE OFF unlimited storage, you'd probably need a virtual drive (Like Bitcasa or OpenDrive). You could use a tool like NetDrive or ExpanDrive to work with Google Drive or OneDrive. There's also a new tool out there called Stablebit CloudDrive.  Since you've been trying out Amazon CloudDrive, I would suggest checking out StableBit CloudDrive with Amazon CloudDrive (as opposed to Amazon's native client).  Personally, I used to LIVE off Bitcasa. They had a good client that had intelligent caching, so it was essentially my hard drive. However after they stopped their unlimited plan, I have stopped using them. I would say that with a virtual drive client that support caching, it is very much possible to use unlimited cloud storage as your main storage if your storage needs (in terms of accessing your data) aren't atypically high."

There will be some, but it doesn't need to be loud.  But you shouldn't keep it in a small, enclosed space. Average drive temp is about 25C (77F), which isn't bad, but if the heat has nowhere to go once the case fans push it out, it'll just suck heated air back in. Eventually it will get hot enough to be a problem.

The entire system (8 core Xeon, 48GB RAM, 8 x 6TB HDD's, 1 x 750GB 2.5"" HDD, LSI HBA, quad gig NIC) runs cool / silent enough that it's actually sitting in my babies room behind a rocking chair. The loudest the thing will ever get is when I'm backing up the server and all the drives are clattering away.  TLDR; With the right fans and good air flow a 4U server can live happily and quietly in a babies room."

DataHoarder,3as2v9,CityRobinson,1 point,Tue Jun 23 01:36:46 2015 UTC,You can buy a pelican case or similar with customizable foam inserts. You just pull out little squares of foam to form the shapes you want. Then you can stick your hard drives in there.
DataHoarder,3as2v9,dn0va,1 point,Tue Jun 23 02:36:22 2015 UTC,"Rubbing the circuit board against the foam as it's inserted or removed might generate static electricity which could fry the controller board, rendering the drive useless and in essence, destroying the data on the drive.  Those grey ""antistatic"" bags have a conductive coating on the inside, rendering the interior surface at the same electrical potential inside the bag but if those bags were rubbed against foam, it still may generate static electricity.  I'm not a fan of the foam idea unless there are several layers of protection.  Maybe the grey bags and then these:  http://www.amazon.com/Professional-Anti-Static-Protection-Moistureproof-Shockproof/dp/B00FDLEFDE  Or this:  http://www.xpresspax.com/large-volume-hard-drive/  Then put them in the foam case.

Instead of the drive being failed out by the controller for normal reasons (bad sectors, too many retries, etc) the drive actually stops responding to commands and hangs. Enterprise storage arrays can deal with this, but I'm not surprised it hung your array. It's less common, but not impossible.   I had this happen to a NetApp array just last week. A drive died, but instead of just getting kicked for spare, it threw path errors (it disrupted the multi-path nature of the SAS chain) instead of outright failure, so no spare was engaged until I physically removed it from the array. Less common than a straight fail, but it probably happens once out of every twenty failed drives or so."

DataHoarder,3aouo4,just_insane,3,Mon Jun 22 08:14:21 2015 UTC,"I have very similar hardware, and seem to have gone through similar thought process as yourself.  I needed a server that would a) store and serve my critical data and backup to the cloud, and b) store media along with all the various supporting software, with the ability to easily expand as my media grew.  I had planned to throw on ESXi, with Freenas for the critical data, and something else (eg. unRAID) to cater for the media.  Gave up on ESXi (didn't really like being tied to a Windows machine to manage my VMs), and tried various options such as proxmox (debian frontend to manage KVM).  In the end, I just went with a roll-your-own style approach.    OS: Arch Critical data: btrfs raid 1 array (with Crashplan for backups) Media: SnapRAID array over a number of mismatched drives, with a nightly script to perform syncs KVM: for VM's, however I run most applications (Plex etc) in Docker containers. KVM is used for a Win 8.1 VM for any windows only programs I may need.   In your case, I guess it depends on how comfortable you are with setting something up yourself (or how much free time you have).  unRaid, as mentioned below, includes all the above as a feature set, so it is definitely worth a look. I've been using it for years, but my biggest issue used to be write speeds, but there are plenty of ways to consider this (cache drives etc.).  On a few of your points above:   ZFS will use whatever RAM you have available. So dont discount it based on perceive high RAM requirements. My only major issue with ZFS was the need to carefully consider your build with respect to disk sizes. (And I preferred to use a Linux native fs, hence the btrfs direction) Re your debian for Plan VM. Take a look at Docker. And if you go the unRaid route, most of these types of media related apps are all ready to go. But in any case, don't go the RAID-0 array. The performance gain is not noticeable for what you need, and you remove any hope of redundancy. I'm liking btrfs so far, but I only use it in a raid-1 environment, and for data that is backed up offsite. I wouldn't risk trialling any type of raid-5 with it yet until that feature set was stable."
DataHoarder,3aouo4,demosthenz,2,Mon Jun 22 11:46:28 2015 UTC,"UnRAID 6 is now out and stable.  The default and recommended file system is xfs for the data drives, and the cache drive is btrfs.

I'm also tired of having to use a Windows only client as I'm on a Mac most times, but do have a Windows desktop, and I definitely don't want to deploy Vcenter just to have a web interface :/  I am leaning towards the ""roll my own"" approach, and Docker is something I keep looking at the need to learn as well. Still unsure of what approach I'll take though, so maybe some more research is needed.   On the RAID levels... I'm not so concerned about the protection of the data as it's just media that I could easily get again if it were lost. I was thinking RAID-0 simply so I could maximize my available space with all the drives I have.   Decisions ahead, but not sure what the best one will be :/"

I'd recommend using the Aegis Sub program to correct the timing on some sub files if you have a hearing friend/relative or if you can lip read enough to tell if the voices are matching up. A lot of sub files are off by enough to be pretty much useless depending on where you acquire your media from."

DataHoarder,3amliq,Shamr0ck,4,Sun Jun 21 21:23:42 2015 UTC,no nas can really transcode video. You are better off building a small file server with an i3/5 and you should be good to go.
DataHoarder,3amliq,smurph1398,2,Sun Jun 21 22:05:35 2015 UTC,"I believe some of Qnaps are capable of transcoding video, however they're pretty expensive and it would be cheaper and more fun to build your own."
DataHoarder,3amliq,AfterShock,2,Sun Jun 21 22:13:33 2015 UTC,Qnaps and select synology boxes are able to transcode just fine.

DataHoarder,3amliq,AfterShock,3,Sun Jun 21 23:31:20 2015 UTC,"OP never stated multiple streams, the higher end Qnaps surely can, the synology 1515+ and up should be able to handle 2x720p streams though I've never tried it myself.  Direct play changes all of that of course."
DataHoarder,3amliq,Shamr0ck,2,Mon Jun 22 00:54:47 2015 UTC,the higher end qnaps so $750+? He might as well just build a file server if he wants to have the storage and stream reliably.    This is just my opinion but if I was going to spend 750+ on a nas that could also stream videos I would build something with an i3 or i5 and not an atom cpu. A nas should be what it name says and nothing more. A network attached storage.  You are right though and your answer does answer the OP's question.
DataHoarder,3amliq,nomofica,1 point,Mon Jun 22 01:02:02 2015 UTC,"Agreed, at that price point OP could build a more capable machine than a Qnap NAS to do the same job and then some."

But don't forget to select your subtitles before hitting 'play' on the movie's page first!    This said, for a NAS these days you are better off building your own machine. Most Pre-Build NAS systems these days (see Synology) have incredibly weak processors and hard-wired memory units that cant be upgraded. If you want a prebuilt nas with a big kick of power that can do live transcoding you might be spending a lot of money for something that when done manually is pretty cheap, compared.  I have one of these, 512MB of ram and an ARM7 core .... ugh christ, httpd (when you're on it's webserver managing stuff) gets it to 100% CPU.. for god sake...  So I have an i3 Shuttle computer with 8GB of ram as our router/PleX/DNS all that shit. And it hardly EVER goes above 10% cpu any given day. All it has to do is mount the NAS's 'NFS' Shares and PleX does the rest.   That was my solution, for now.  If you follow this advice, I could also recommend Deluge and FlexGet to do the following   Flexget can be given RSS feeds on tv shows etc and it will download them automatically it can do torrents as well, fed straight into your deluge client."

Here's an online calculator for BTRFS and an image that disproves your theory, in your example I'd only 7 units of usable space (1unit being the lowest, all the 4 units drives are now 1 unit), however, with BTRFS, the two largest drives will have excluded for the sake of containing the parity for >1unit indexed data (Although BTRFS doesn't have a dedicated parity drive). All data with index 1unit or less will be in raid6 across all the drives, while all data with an index greater than 1unit will be in raid6 across all the 4unit drives. This basically, on demand, creates two raid arrays (1 raid6 with size 1unit, 1 raid6 with size 3unit) which are invisible and will automatically merge if the user was to say, swap the 1unit drive for a 4unit (or greater) drive.

You can basically take a RAIDZ2 (RAID6 equivalent) and extend it by adding a second RAIDZ2, and striping them.

What are you going to do with those virtual machines? If it's just server stuff, maybe Docker?   I also was thinking btfs or xfs since this is going to be storing a ton of data for a long time.   I use btrfs. To me the biggest advantages of it are drives of different sizes, easily adding/removing drives, and changing the RAID levels easily. On a big budget, these are all unnecessary. Go with ZFS.   while someone is virtualizing GTAV for example.   So you're going to have a GPU for PCI-passthrough? In that case make sure to check for IOMMU on the CPU/motherboard to be able to passthrough the GPU.  https://www.pugetsystems.com/labs/articles/Multi-headed-VMWare-Gaming-Setup-564/ is an interesting read for that.

DataHoarder,3al7r7,ThatOnePerson,3,Sun Jun 21 09:19:31 2015 UTC,"I have not actively check Virtual Desktop solutions but I do not think that they are still not far enough that you would want to do gaming through them. Not to mention that you will always introduce more input lag when using them. As for the File System, you might want to look at ZFS as well. I am using it on my Linux Storage Server and used it with a Solaris server and it is defenitly one of the best File Systems out there. In any case I would not mix a Server with a Desktop. Just put the Server ito some corner that noone sees. Nothing good can come of mixing those jobs. If somebody computer illiterate is working directly on it you can pretty much gurantee that they will cause problems that you will have to fix.  If you want a linux base and Virtual Machines, you can have a look at Proxmox. I love it especially for Home and Small Business use. You can do the most common management of your Virtual Machines through a Web interface and unlike most other Hypervisors It comes with a Built in Backup Solution.  As for decoding the 4 h264/265 Streams. Could you describe what you want to do a little better? In most use cases you would either reencode the Stream on the fly (transcode) or just send the data to the client so and let the client deal with decoding. The range of Xeon Processors is quite huge and there are many different plattforms. I believe at least some of theXeons will be able to handle that workload. My Hypervisor has a Xeon E3 1235 v1 and the media Server in it can handle to transcode video to 2 to 4 people watching through the internet. This also happens to be my bandwidth limit, the CPU still has a little room in that case.  However there are a few things to consider here: There is definitly a loss of quality during the transcode, especially when the highest qulity is not explicitly chosen. My Storage Server is sepperate from my Hypervisor, so any CPU Load from ZFS does not impact my transcodes. If you also want ZFS and this Server should also be a Hypervisor, you need a lot of RAM in there. On experience I would say at the very least 16GB total and of those 8GB for the File Server. Since money is no Object I would honestly start looking at Builds with a minimum of 32 GB RAM."

The drives are independent so say your parity drive fails and then another drive fails whilst you're rebuilding your parity. You only lose what was on that specific 2nd failed drive, every other drive is fine, this isn't RAID5. Say the whole machine dies, take the drives and USB drive and plug into a new box, start the machine and you're up and running. The drives are formatted in XFS by default so they can be read on another machine if needed. The parity is in one way is worse but in another way its better. Pros and cons.  The other point I will make is your use case, for a large majority of unRaid users its mostly media. Something that most times is easily available to be re-downloaded, if 2 drives fail (the parity and a data) you just lose what was on the data drive and not the contents of all drives. If things are more important to you then that (personal media such as photos etc.) then you should be backing them up regardless of the underlying system."

One of your requirements is ease of use and whilst Windows is easy I think unRaid is going to be even easier. It runs on nearly anything, it does everything you say you wanted and its all controlled via a web interface. Say you're running Plex as a docker and an update comes out, just go into the web interface and click update on the docker, 5 minutes later new version up and running. Done. Say a drive fails, it will email you, just replace the drive and click a few buttons and the array will fix its self.

You can hook that up to a couple of high end servers like a HP DL380p G9 with NVIDIA GRID K2 cards and run VMware Horizon in vDGA mode for 2 to 8 virtual machines.  For VMware horizon you will need 1 connection server, 1 security server (for remote access), 1 vCenter server, and also a domain controller and DNS server.  Also I would run Plex in a separate VM with 2 vCPU and 16GB RAM, should be plenty to run a decoder, or use another separate DL380 and run it bare-metal.  But if you want to completely build it yourself you could use a big 19"" 4U chassis and put a lot of disks in there, WD RED or something.  I would still go with 1 or 2 regular RAID cards instead of software RAID like a LSI 9361-8i or a Areca ARC-1883ix and use RAID6 and Windows server 2012 as the OS.  The rest of the system: just a good motherboard that has IPMI, like the Supermicro X10SRH-CLN4F (maybe even dual CPU like the X10DRD-iT and go with 10Gbit LAN) and some DDR4 ECC ram (64GB should be more the enough) and some fast CPU('s) like the Xeon E5-2667 v3, just make sure that you probably need a narrow ILM 2011 CPU cooler for those Supermicro motherboards, Noctua has some that fit.  For the VM's also a similar setup, good motherboard with IMPI, maybe a bit more RAM and a couple of high end and supported 3D cards (like the NVIDIA GRID K2), maybe a R9 295X2 will work? Also: SSD storage, maybe a Intel DC P3700 / 750?

DataHoarder,3ajjc3,enigmo666,3,Sat Jun 20 23:09:03 2015 UTC,So thoughts on recommended drives? Let's try and get a list going!
DataHoarder,3ajjc3,therealblergh,5,Sun Jun 21 03:55:51 2015 UTC,"I have a 8TB Seagate Archive since last tuesday. Write speeds are really slow (dropped to about 60mb/s within the first few GB I copied), but read speeds are incredible, I copied a bunch of 10GB+ video files to my SSD, got 206mb/s out of the hdd.   Slow writes are due to the shingled write technology, the drive needs to reread and rewrite old data when writing new data to it.   But you need to be sure about your load case, the seagate archive series isn't meant for continuous write operations. It's more a drive for write once read often. Perfect for video or audio collections, where you just add a bunch off files occasionally but in general you only need to read the files, once they are on the hdd.   All in all I really like the drive, good specs, really good price."
DataHoarder,3ajjc3,therealblergh,2,Sun Jun 21 07:31:12 2015 UTC,"They are intriguing. I've got all 3TB Reds and SG NAS drives, but as they are all for archiving and the 8TB SG is cheaper than the 6TB Red, it is very, very tempting for my next crop of drives. However, the Reds having a more normal write speed leaves them more open for other use in future."
DataHoarder,3ajjc3,_java_csharp_cpp_c,2,Sun Jun 21 10:17:03 2015 UTC,"I'm also interested in this, the new 8TB drives offer a pretty neat price-per-tb but not sure how well they keep up. 4TB drives are about half the price, any good?"
DataHoarder,3aigyd,TheMacMini09,6,Sat Jun 20 14:33:59 2015 UTC,If you're getting that Xeon then get a workstation grade board and ECC RAM.

DataHoarder,3aigyd,h4x04,2,Sat Jun 20 15:32:35 2015 UTC,Supermicro boards are always on the recommend list for FreeNAS builds.
DataHoarder,3aigyd,h4x04,1 point,Sat Jun 20 21:10:41 2015 UTC,"Yep, saw another comment about Supermicro boards - I've taken a look at a few, namely the X10DRD-iTP and the MBD-X10SRL-F. I'm leaning slightly towards the X10DRD-1TP, but if you have any preference over either, feel free to share."

DataHoarder,3aigyd,Reset_Assured,2,Sun Jun 21 03:43:21 2015 UTC,"My thoughts is look into virtualization you can run multiple os at the same time for your nas and server needs you will need more ram if you are running zfs  1gb ram to 1tb (freenas) but with pci pass through you could run you nas and servers on the same machine. There are some good second hand deals to be found over directly buying new gear and look at a bigger case so you can expand your raid. 2 raids may be a better use e.g 1 slow raid, raid 5 and a raid 1 or 10 for speed. Hypervisor 's are proxmox esxi xensever and many many more to suit you."
DataHoarder,3aigyd,SirMaster,2,Sat Jun 20 14:44:41 2015 UTC,Yep. Setup proxmox with GPU pass through to your render machine. Put freenas in a VM for storage with your storage card passed through. Then put your osx box in a VM.
DataHoarder,3aigyd,Dave_the_Pigeon,2,Sat Jun 20 15:24:17 2015 UTC,Proxmox comes with ZFS. Just run the zpool natively in proxmox.
DataHoarder,3aigyd,Reset_Assured,1 point,Sun Jun 21 05:41:22 2015 UTC,Definitely wouldn't recommend virtualizing FreeNas or zfs.
DataHoarder,3aigyd,bahwhateverr,1 point,Sun Jun 21 02:57:54 2015 UTC,Well then just do a zfs setup in proxmox itself...
DataHoarder,3aigyd,bahwhateverr,1 point,Sun Jun 21 13:31:49 2015 UTC,"Most of the parts I will try to find used - this is basically a guideline. I am also considering virtualization, but I'm not sure if that would be worth it in terms of speed. On one hand, I could run OS X with AFP/SMB, caching, network login, etc. - on the other, I could run FreeBSD/Debian/etc. for the AFP/SMB aspect, then virtualize an instance of OS X for caching, then virtualize an instance of OS X for network login, etc. but I'm not sure which would be better for my needs. I'll probably try both, see which I prefer."
DataHoarder,3aigyd,bahwhateverr,1 point,Sat Jun 20 15:37:11 2015 UTC,That is no where near enough ram to support a 500GB L2ARC.
DataHoarder,3aigyd,hellbringer82,1 point,Sat Jun 20 14:50:29 2015 UTC,"Perfect - that's why I posted here asking. How much would be enough? 32GB? 64GB? Or would a smaller L2ARC be a better decision to start with, and upgrade RAM/L2ARC later?"
DataHoarder,3aigyd,Dave_the_Pigeon,2,Sat Jun 20 14:52:33 2015 UTC,"So each l2 entry has a fixed overhead (200 bytes IIRC), the tough question to answer is how many of them will there be? This is determined by the the block size which in ZFS is variable - between 512 and 128k bytes. If you know the average size you can figure out how much ram you might expect to use. For example if it was 8k, for 500GB you would use around 13GB of ram for the l2 entries. If you already have a zpool you could probably use zdb to get the average size.  Edit: What is the anticipated workload of this server? You mention caching, do you know the amount of the data that will be cached roughly? Is it textual or compressible? If performance is your chief goal it can really pay dividends to think things through ahead of time. For example, lets say I'm building a box to serve websites and I know my hot data is about 100GB of html, javascript and css files - all very compressible and zfs will compress ARC contents. So after compression I figure that data will be about 20GB. I would just size the ram to accommodate that and skip the L2 entirely."
DataHoarder,3ahp4h,1337haXXor,3,Sat Jun 20 07:31:15 2015 UTC,"WD makes good drives, but their NAS units have bad reviews.    Probably. I just have a FTP site with logins + Plex for media.  I don't think I understand what you mean. If you setup a NAS PC or use a Synology or whatever, you can just restrict it by blocking it's internet access (but not local) Yes, most applications and FTP protocols (like webdav) support what you say. NAS. Centralized storage for all your ""shiz"" is the best method.   All in all, it depends on what you want and can afford. Some people setup Windows boxes with hardware raid (like me), some use FreeBSD + ZFS(very popular), and others buy prebuilt units like Synology.    You really don't want JBOD (just a bunch of disks) in a NAS. I would say you had raid or some sort of software protection like ZFS. You would also need software that ""serves"" and transcoded media, like Plex."

You should go full fledgeling 4 or 5 drives depending on your setup from the get go. Head parking is bad... but I have a green drive that hasn't dropped out in 2 years so far. I would just get RED's for the peace mind. Constantly head parking also wears out the drive.  Mechanical things WILL fail. Do 3+ disks and do raid-5 (alternatively ZFS if you build your own box). Raid-10 is good, but it requires a lot of space. Raid5 + crashplan/backblaze is a good solution.    I might write more here when I wake up... this post took extreme effort to format properly."
DataHoarder,3ag7hj,cgimusic,5,Fri Jun 19 21:56:44 2015 UTC,"Hi,   I'm a newbie myself to building a NAS, I am in the middle of completing my own so it's pretty fresh.  With regards to the Greens are you aware of the firmware based head parking timer built into the drives? they are designed to park the head after a set amount of time.  However you can reduce or stop this by using wdidle3 (which is handily packaged in the ultimate boot CD   Here is a youtube video I used to get me used to the process and what i expected to see if sucessful:   should help improve the performance of the drives, at least when it comes to artifically head parking.   The config itself seems good otherwise, I went for a HP Gen 8 Microserver myself. low power with some Enterprise grade hardware included for a good value price after rebate. food for thought.  good luck! :-)"
DataHoarder,3ag7hj,Foolish_Overlord,3,Sat Jun 20 00:18:33 2015 UTC,That is interesting about wdidle3.  Have you played with that tool?...wondering what the default timer is for WD-reds.  Seems like a great idea to do this so curious as to why its not more popular with NAS builders.  Edit:  While thinking about if I should order WD-Greens now instead of Red I came across this article..which maybe of interest to anyone thinking about doing the same.   Western Digital Green vs. Red Hard Drives  Main difference being load and unload cycles ..thats what wdidle3 helps with (?) and WD-reds also have vibration protection called - 3D Active Balance Plus.  Which is not there in Greens.
DataHoarder,3ag7hj,nas2015,3,Sat Jun 20 01:10:00 2015 UTC,"Reds should be fine, but they have a different tool to be used as released by WD if you plan to check or change their head park time (which may or may not just be wdidle3): wd5741. Here is an excellent guide by cyberjock."

I don't remember exactly how low, but low enough for the smart attribute on mine to reach 30,000 in under a week. I believe it was determined that excessive parking could lead to premature failure and so they adjusted the firmware to increase the timeout. I used wdidle to set all mine to the max, 300 seconds.   The weird thing is I bought six of them all at the same time and the settings were not consistent. The load cycle count on them:  385 29397 34480 29302 376 411"

I have looked at some of the HP Gen 8 Microservers and was actually really surprised about the price. I love the idea of something with iLO.

DataHoarder,3af9th,skylark70,2,Fri Jun 19 17:32:42 2015 UTC,"actually in the Asystor website, it says Due to system kernel limitations, for the following models, the maximum capacity of a single RAID volume is 16TB: AS-204T, AS-204TE, AS-204RS, AS-304T.

DataHoarder,3af9th,blububub,2,Fri Jun 19 17:36:28 2015 UTC,If i'm not horribly mistaken. This is a limit of the ext4 filesystems and sizes bigger than 16TB without the 64-bit option.

DataHoarder,3aatds,heyimawesome,6,Fri Jun 19 03:27:48 2015 UTC,No. An OS like OMV or FreeNAS are designed to be a NAS OS. The only thing special about prebuilt NAS is the price and closed source software. Please educate yourself.

DataHoarder,3aatds,jamesholden,12,Thu Jun 18 19:23:34 2015 UTC,"Your major power draw will probably be hard drives.  For example: a Seagate Baracuda uses ~8W.  8 * 24 drives = 192 watts.  Add this to the 2 60W processors and you get ~312 watts.  Or you can work backwards from the PSU.  It has 2 900W fully redundant PSUs, so the max load of the server is 900W.  But power supplys are not 100% efficient.  A 'normal' PSU is about 80% efficient, but you have 2, so you have double the inefficency so that would be 900.22+900=1260 (in reality it should be lower than this).  So this gets you a lower and upper bound for power draw.  In reality, the max draw of the server should be around 1/3 of the max draw you calculated since most appliances have a peak draw at ~3x their max draw.  This peak draw happens when the appliance first turns on, as there is a spike in usage that the PSU has to keep up with.  This is why breakers for things like air conditioners are ~3x their max running draw.  So that gives us between 300 and 420 watts of normal operating draw, or between 5 and 7 normal lightbulbs."

DataHoarder,3aatds,gospelwut,1 point,Thu Jun 18 19:55:29 2015 UTC,"But the effiency is calculated from the wall outlet, not what the PSU delivers. A 900W PSU should deliver a minimum of 900W and might draw 1125W from the wall."

I used quiet, low RPM 120mm fans and replace the stock 80mm fans in the back with quiet fans too. I removed the stock PSUs and used a quiet Seasonic standard ATX PSU.

So far in proxmox I've set up containers for LibreNMS for monitoring, OpenLDAP for authentication, and now will be one for an NFS server for NAS (it's always bugged me that the old Buffalo Terrastation NAS I had only did SMB shares. =P)  That's in addition to learning proxmox itself, figuring out how to make custom container templates to include things like the ldap client and configuration for my ldap authentication server, etc.  Once I have the NFS server up, I'll probably spin up an OwnCloud instance and start trying to sort and organize the digital cruft from decades of backups that I have preserved on drives and discs.  Lastly I'll probably start to shuffle some other things I have on physical boxes into containers. Things like my subdomain to application Nginx proxy server (so: https://nms.domain.com proxies out to the LibreNMS server:port.  With the Nginx having a wildcard SSL cert for my home domain.)

DataHoarder,3a8817,just_insane,3,Thu Jun 18 11:39:58 2015 UTC,"No fighting required.  Though ""Conduct static"" is kind of a misnomer.  ""Conduct"" implies motion, while ""static"" implies the opposite.  It is more correct to say ""carry static"" (as you just did).  Assuming just_insane actually meant to say carry static, rather than conduct static: The wiki article clearly states ""To create the anti-static effect, the black or silver bags are slightly conductive"".  They conduct electricity to give, what would otherwise be static, a route to (hopefully) ground, preventing an buildup of static, and eventually a high-charge (or at least high-er charge) ES Discharge.  The general understanding being: only when static builds up does it become a hazard.  By ""wicking"" away the static by being slightly conductive, the anti-static bags diffuse the static before it can build up to critical 'mass' (in a manner of speaking).  At least, that's how I understand it.  Given my understanding, the statement of ""The outside of those bags conduct static."" is actually correct, they conduct the static AWAY from the device, whether the device is on one side or another; therefore making a safer environment for the device (in this case the drive)."
DataHoarder,3a8817,Apocaliptic-cake,1 point,Thu Jun 18 15:13:40 2015 UTC,"Antistatic bag:       An antistatic bag is a bag used for shipping (usually electronic) components, which are prone to damage caused by electrostatic discharge.  These bags are usually plastic polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and have a distinctive color (silvery for metallised film, pink or black for polyethylene). The polyethylene variant may also take the form of foam or bubble wrap, either as sheets or bags. Multiple layers of protection are often used to protect from both mechanical damage and electrostatic damage. A protected device can be packaged inside a metalized PET film bag, inside a pink polyethylene bubble-wrap bag, which is finally packed inside a rigid black polyethylene box lined with pink poly foam.  To create the anti-static effect, the black or silver bags are slightly conductive, forming a Faraday cage around the item to be protected and preventing any localized charges from being deposited onto the protected devices as the bags are handled. The pink or green bags are made of low-charging material that will not create harmful charges, but that does not protect the item from electric fields.  It is important that the bags only be opened at static-free workstations.     Image i - A network card inside an antistatic bag.

This is great for data recovery from deleting files but will be pretty limited for data recovery from a drive going bad. Do you have a link to the page that talks about it? I'm curious at how that works and I might test it on a couple of usb drives to see what happens.  I'd stick with raid 10. Even if that feature is stable and works the way you suggest, your data is much more secure in raid. Hardware failure is hardware failure and software voodoo can only do so much to recover data. This won't recover data if your drive gets really messed up, and as your drives fill up, there will be less old copies on the drive (unless you use snapshots) so it will be a less effective method of recovery.

Stay away from Green drives. Get a NAS rated hard drive (preferably WD, although I use Seagate, WD is recommended) and don't get 3TB drives (high failure rate).  Edit: also note that an SSD is not strictly needed for an always on machine, as it should not be rebooting that often, and files should be stored on the hard drives for the most part.

I almost never use Blu-ray (everything I watch is downloaded from Amazon or on Netflix), so I have no need for external 5 1/4"" drive bay.   Most of the J2900 board are passively cooled and low powered (~10-15 W), and the processor adds enough punch to run all NAS/Streaming/HTPC activities I want.

I'm new to ZFS as well so correct me if I have something wrong, but doesn't ZFS use the smaller of the drive sizes for the mirroed pairs, but it can still pool together vdevs of different sizes into one zpool?   Example... Mirror the two 4TB into one pool, then move the data, then mirror the 2x1TB drives together and mirror the 2x2TB together, and add each mirored vdev set to the first 4TB pool making it 7TB total. Does that make sense?  Again, if I am wrong please tell me, I am just going by things I've read when researching ZFS.

So the TL;DR I get from that post is: you can pair up your like sized drives into mirrored sets that count as a ""vdev"", then add each vdev to a zpool to combined storage as one logical drive, even if each vdev themselves are different sizes.

There should be very few v2 drives out on the market still at this point, and on top of that a WD staff member posted in their forums commenting that all 5TB and 6TB Red drives were only ever manufactured with version 3.

DataHoarder,3a6x63,Veritas413,6,Wed Jun 17 18:28:57 2015 UTC,"Just want to throw it out there that you can consider BTRFS as well. I'm honestly not immediately aware of many other filesystems that are as expandable, flexible, or capable.  BTRFS offers very strong flexibility where you're interested, allowing you to change or convert your striping/parity/mirroring policies for data and/or metadata (independently!) while mounted and in use.  And the feature roadmap seeks to have exciting things like per-subvolume (or snapshot) policies, so you can mix and match within the same volume or drive pool, which is really powerful stuff.  BTRFS, however, is often still considered immature or even unsafe for production purposes. I'm personally of the opinion that that statement is outdated (if not, soon), but I'll concede that that's the case only so if you are going to stick with current kernel revisions (to a reasonable degree) and essentially keep tabs of what the BTRFS commits into the kernel are looking like (and if they impact you).  Conthusiast experience:  I started out 4+ years ago with what was a RAID-0 BTRFS volume over four 1TB drives, to what is now a ten-drive RAID-10 volume comprised of 3TB drives. In those years of drive additions and replacements, I have never undergone downtime or data loss for anything BTRFS or storage stack related; this was, for the most part, a 24/7 volume throughout its lifetime so far.  The volume has also sustained numerous planned and unplanned drive failures/removals/replacements over the years (Seagate Barracudas have been... interesting). You may spot dying drives based on error rates/logs/SMART/noises, evacuate blocks from the problem/suspect device, replace it with a new drive, and rebalance blocks across the entire pool again - all without rebooting. It'll take a while, though, and parity will take much, much longer (regardless of filesystem or hardware).  I should note that I have not encountered situations that necessitated file system repairs/diagnostics, nor have I fallen below drive requirements to satisfy mirror/parity minimums (so I've always had a mountable filesystem). And I didn't make much use of snapshots or other possibly esoteric functions and options. What I'm basically saying is that my experience is far off to the ""everything has been great"" side of the spectrum, while there definitely have been users that lost data.  I'd believe that when it comes to filesystems, you place your trust into ones that have a good track record, sure, but also if they offer you sufficient options to get out of sticky situations. Filesystem checking/repair utilities that work and won't crash when encountering errors, force-mounting and recovery options, a supportive community and responsible development channels, etc. are all important.  Despite where my heart is, I'm still more confident about saying ZFS will ultimately be a more safe option if your job is on the line. If at least for as long as there is some public perception that BTRFS isn't production ready, as much as I don't agree with that. Truth is, if shit hits the fan and your design is called to question after they read anecdotes online about it being ""not suitable for production"" then you don't have much of a platform to defend yourself on.  I also don't think it necessarily needs incredible amounts of memory unless you're deduplicating data... I could be wrong or underestimating caching, perhaps. But re: dedupe, I wouldn't recommend venturing down that road without doing a lot more reading anyway.  Either way, ensure you have backups regardless of FS. Mirroring/Parity, even with bitrot and file checksumming, is not a backup.  Edit: Not to lecture you, just throwing this out."
DataHoarder,3a6x63,kachunkachunk,1 point,Thu Jun 18 06:19:05 2015 UTC,"can btrfs convert a raid5 parity array to a raid6? Also can btrfs simple add new drives to an existing array? So if I start with 3 drives in raid5, can I keep adding drives until I have 6 and then switch to raid 6?  Also when new drives are added what happens if they are a different size? If the array has 3TB drives, can I add a 2TB or 4TB drives?  Thanks!"
DataHoarder,3a6x63,thewaterbottle4,2,Sat Jun 20 04:36:36 2015 UTC,"Yes. You can go to/from supported RAID types online. These at the moment are: single (concatenation), raid0, raid1, raid10, raid5, raid6. You can deviate from typical assumptions (and recommendations) when it comes to RAID types. So you can achieve RAID-10 on odd numbers of drives, or on fewer than four drives. Likewise, you can with raid6.  You usually want to try to have the correct number of spindles for device fault tolerance. The benefits purely from a filesystem redundancy standpoint are a bit less pronounced or strived for, but they do exist (such as having redundant blocks on the same drive to perhaps protect from corruption on part of the disk. It's atypical and not really what it was meant to do. But it works. I'm at the moment waiting for an RMA to come back with a replacement 3TB drive in my array, so at this moment I've got a RAID-10 policy going, over nine drives.  When it comes to different sizes, you should, for now, expect that the allocator for BTRFS will only use up portions of the larger different drives, settling on a usable space as large as your smallest member disk. When striping. Just like typical RAID.  To use an assortment of different sized drives (not really the greatest idea anyway) without losing space, you can also use the Single profile, which spans/concatenates disks, or Mirror. BTRFS mirroring will use all available space, and not assume capacity based on the smallest disk. BTRFS mirroring is also interesting in the fact that it is, for now, not N-Way mirroring and will mirror data blocks once (two-way only). So at most, the data sits on two disks at a time. You still have one drive fault tolerance, even if you had 5 disks in the BTRFS RAID-1 configuration. The upside to this, however, is that BTRFS RAID-1 configurations over 3 or 4 (or more) disks have more usable space. 2-way really is a more typical or reasonable use case to me anyway.  There should be roadmapped items for the capability to set RAID policies on a per-snapshot, per-subvolume, and maybe per-directory, or per-file basis. And I'd expect if the allocator receives such capabilities, the typical restrictions on differing drive sizes will no longer be in effect. Similarly, somewhere among the roadmapped items is N-way mirroring. I think a lot of these things just go hand-in-hand, given what work/changes need to be done.  But for the sake of device fault tolerance at least, you generally can expect that RAID-10 will still recommend 4+ drives, RAID-5 3+, RAID-6 4+, etc.  On that partition hint I had earlier, I temporarily have a hacky method of using a 500GB SSD with three 250GB SSDs, without losing out on 250GB from the larger one: using partitions. The 500GB is configured with two partitions 250GB each, so each partition is a ""member"" of the 1.25TB volume set that's otherwise comprised of three 250GB SSDs. It's again quite hacky, but temporary until I can replace all the 250GB SSDs with larger ones.  Edit: Corrected a statement for the use case involving multiple drives of different sizes."

DataHoarder,3a6x63,u4iak,2,Mon Jun 29 07:29:27 2015 UTC,If you have the space for it try loading up free nas in a VM and give it a spin. You can run plex from it as well. I don't know enough to answer the rest of your questions but you hit a few key points I haven't considered myself yet.

DataHoarder,3a6x63,audio_pile,2,Thu Jun 18 04:05:45 2015 UTC,"The problem with FreeNAS running ZFS is the amount of RAM it takes, and how much it can cost to purchase a mobo that can support  32GB+ of ECC memory. Will the server be out of the way? I.E, is sound an issue? Personally I love FreeNAS, I love ZFS, and I love RAID-Z. The only problem is, it is recommended that you have 1GB RAM per 1TB of HDD space."
DataHoarder,3a6x63,Aurabolt,4,Wed Jun 17 19:55:13 2015 UTC,The 1GB RAM per 1TB recommendation that is often tossed round by the freenas community is more or less BS.  They are also pretty piss-poor over there about acknowledging the distinction between 'My use case is home media/backups' and 'My use case is storage backing for 100 VMs at my company.'  ZFS works surprisingly well with 8GB when your other hardware isn't crappy.
DataHoarder,3a6x63,heyimawesome,3,Thu Jun 18 05:46:11 2015 UTC,I used a regular desktop with a perc h310 and four 3tb seagates. 8.x TB usable. Windows shares the volume on my local network. Cheap.
DataHoarder,3a6x63,Llamathrust,2,Wed Jun 17 23:47:24 2015 UTC,"Sound isn't a HUGE issue, but I'd like to stay away from 40mm fans, cuz I don't have a datacenter at home (yet).    Well, if I DID go with FreeNAS and start with 8TB, it's not entirely infeasable to get 16G or so of RAM in a server case with a bunch of drive bays. That's not too big of a problem. What about hardware to GET me that many SATA plugs? I've been sorta looking at: Rosewill 4U 12-Bay enclosure 860W SeaSonic Platinum Power Supply Intel Server Board Xeon E3-1273 4@3.6GHz 16GB ECC RAM (I know ZFS doesn't REQUIRE it) 3x4TB WD Red (To start)  My reasoning behind such a beefy machine is I could then move my hosting to the server, and shut down my main gaming rig, but transcoding on plex takes a bit of a machine, if you're hosting three simultaneous HD transcodes, which I have on occasion.    I'd need some way to get all those 12 bays connected. I figure that means a RAID card, and cheaping out on a RAID card is a stupid thing, but I know nothing about them.    I literally know nothing about managing storage with FreeNAS. I'm a traditionalist, so I'd probably throw an old 128G SSD in for the boot drive, then I have these three spinning discs. How do I tell FreeNAS what to do with them, and what happens if I want to add an nth disk to that SMB share? Does it just magically add it to the available space if I tell FreeNAS to?"
DataHoarder,3a6x63,audio_pile,2,Wed Jun 17 20:21:13 2015 UTC,"If you go with FreeNAS, here are my suggestions. Get a mobo that has a USB port integrated on the board, and load FreeNAS onto that. The OS is going to use the entire drive, so it's cheaper to use a USB stick than a SSD. You also don't need a fancy raid card since FreeNAS handles the raid in software. Look into IBM M1015 cards. They're a lot cheaper and you can flash them to act as an HBA."
DataHoarder,3a6x63,HollowPwns,2,Wed Jun 17 22:07:08 2015 UTC,"I just made this purchase yesterday. I'd make some changes to your list in the interests of cost:performance:  You don't need that high of a wattage PSU. The one I have right now is still overkill with 620W (6x 4tb WD Reds). Here's a good site to check out your requirements.  Look at the Supermicro boards, namely the X10SLM.   That processor is overkill as well. I see no reason why you wouldn't get by with a E3-1231V3 even for future-proofing. For the nearly $100 saved, you could almost buy another WD Red. My sever right now is doing all-in-one work hosting ~6 VMs (one is a 8.1 VM running Plex) as well as Storage Spaces 3x WD Reds and it barely uses the E3-1245V2.  I'll be using this Samsung ECC memory but that's because I hear Supermicro boards are very picky with the memory and it's one of the few on the compatible list.  You'll need a raid card to supply the sata connections. I'm using the IBM M1015 (get it on eBay). It can then be flashed with LSI firmware in ""IT Mode"" and it'll basically be a passthrough. The card has 2 SAS ports that you can use a breakout cable that splits into 4 SATA cables each (for 8 total). That being said, you may want to look into another card that could give you the 12 total from the start.  FreeNAS (and the alternative that I'm going with when parts come in, NAS4Free) can actually be run off a USB thumb drive. This is the one I'm using for my build.   I'm far from an expert on ZFS, but you can expand your NAS as long as you use the same number of disks by adding another vdev. So if you have 3x drives, if you add 3x more at a later time you can expand it without loss of data. Someone with better knowledge will be able to chime in on that one.  It wasn't what you asked, but like I said I was in your shoes up until yesterday. FreeNAS vs NAS4Free is worth a look. Basically, FreeNAS has more plugins to use (such as Plex) so it may be better for you. NAS4Free is more for NAS service and that's it. I'll have another server providing the services so I chose that route.  Sorry for the wall of text, but I just pulled the trigger on my own build for a very similar use so hopefully that took some of the leg work out of it for you. Good luck!"
DataHoarder,3a6x63,m0po,2,Thu Jun 18 02:32:45 2015 UTC,-Check out SuperMicro's 1150 motherboards. (They are pretty nice) -Also check out Asrock rack's offerings. (Bang for the buck) -For tons of drives reflashing a used m1015 is hard to beat; OR pick a motherboard with an onboard LSI SAS chipset that supports IT mode. -Seagate NAS drives are fine too instead of reds. I have sold boatloads of both to my clients. -you can put an i3 instead of a xeon in many of these server boards. -That PSU is overkill for the demands of your hardware list; even if you fill that Rosewill case.
DataHoarder,3a6x63,Wrestlingblea,2,Thu Jun 18 05:56:30 2015 UTC,"While it's recommend, it's not a requirement to do 1GB of RAM per 1TB of HDD. If you have a lot of users accessing it, then it's ideal, but if just a few people are accessing the data, 8GB of RAM should work fine for 16TB."
DataHoarder,3a7hs8,jduke1,4,Wed Jun 17 20:54:10 2015 UTC,"It will void the warranty. It will not be a Red, there is no reason for them to use that over other cheaper drives. Also, while I have never seen it with a 3.5"" size drive, I have seen the 2.5"" external drives have no SATA connectors. It just had some pins and a weird connector that was non-standard."
DataHoarder,3a7hs8,lowfwyr,3,Wed Jun 17 22:26:37 2015 UTC,weird connector that was non-standard.   Actually those are standard; they are standard USB 3.0 Micro ports. They just made the drive with USB directly connected.
DataHoarder,3a7hs8,knightcrusader,2,Thu Jun 18 01:40:27 2015 UTC,Yup. To save money on extra parts (etc; the bridge board) a lot of 2.5 externals are straight-up exposing USB3 right from the controller board.
DataHoarder,3a7hs8,audio_pile,3,Thu Jun 18 05:29:45 2015 UTC,"It's most likely a green.    Not sure if WD idle will work on stopping the headparking.  It will void the warranty, but I have persuaded them to replace an opened MyBook in the past."
DataHoarder,3a7hs8,seriousfart,2,Wed Jun 17 22:30:56 2015 UTC,Not sure if WD idle will work on stopping the headparking.   This is the #1 reason I will not use their externals anymore. The only hard drive failure I've ever had was a MyBook that continuously would power down for sleep and back on. Killed the drive.
DataHoarder,3a7hs8,knightcrusader,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:28:38 2015 UTC,Big reason why I am damn picky about even the internals that I buy too. All the vendors are doing lots of firmware level optimization for various use-cases and if doesn't match up to what your using the drive for you run the real risk of highly reducing life expectancy of your kit.
DataHoarder,3a7hs8,audio_pile,1 point,Thu Jun 18 05:36:24 2015 UTC,Personally I trust WD external far more than Seagate. Bought a Seagate just last year and it was corrupting the data during my initial test. RMA'd it and got a WD and it's been good. Though I only plug it in for my monthly backups and then unplug it when I'm done.

DataHoarder,3a7hs8,sanders54,2,Wed Jun 17 22:15:58 2015 UTC,"How long have they been using green drives in the externals? For example, the 3TB I tore apart had a green, but the 500GB one from around 2009-2010 had a black drive. Just wondering when they changed it over."
DataHoarder,3a7hs8,knightcrusader,2,Thu Jun 18 01:27:11 2015 UTC,"I used to shuck drives all the time when the cases died and reused them elsewhere. And I have seen people do it when the externals are heavily marked down in price. But. . . .  I have read plenty of possibly apocryphal stories about people having issues doing this; models of drives where the firmware doesn't use pin 11 for drive activity when you use it in a hot swap bay. Some instances where the drives don't play quite as expected with power management or aggressively park or whatnot. Someone was griping about how their shucked seagates weren't tossing out the max throughput one would expect from a similar internal model.   I could just be re-spewing FUD here; but the point is that you can get an internal WD Green for 139.99 on Newegg right now, or a Seagate Desktop for 129.99. Save yourself your warranty, your time and possible future problems."
DataHoarder,3a7hs8,audio_pile,1 point,Thu Jun 18 05:28:06 2015 UTC,"Hi there.  Yes, by removing the drives from the enclosure of your external drive you will void the warranty of the product.

DataHoarder,3a5s7e,madmaze,5,Wed Jun 17 13:22:45 2015 UTC,"Note that hard drives with ""NAS"" in their name are functionally similar to other drives but may have different firmware, vibration tolerance, or power dissipation to make them more suitable for use in RAID arrays, which are sometimes used in NAS implementations.[3] For example, some NAS versions of drives support a command extension to allow extended error recovery to be disabled. In a non-RAID application, it may be important for a disk drive to go to great lengths to successfully read a problematic storage block, even if it takes several seconds. In an appropriately configured RAID array, a single bad block on a single drive can be recovered completely via the redundancy encoded across the RAID set. If a drive spends several seconds executing extensive retries it might cause the RAID controller to flag the drive as ""down"" whereas if it simply replied promptly that the block of data had a checksum error, the RAID controller would use the redundant data on the other drives to correct the error and continue without any problem. Such a ""NAS"" SATA hard disk drive can be used as an internal PC hard drive, without any problems or adjustments needed, as it simply supports additional options and may possibly be built to a higher quality standard (particularly if accompanied by a higher quoted MTBF figure and higher price) than a regular consumer drive.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network-attached_storage  I bolded some important parts in there."
DataHoarder,3a5s7e,steelbeamsdankmemes,3,Wed Jun 17 13:37:22 2015 UTC,"If I recall correctly the ""extended error recovery"" part is where a regular desktop use drive will continue to try and read information from a disk and it takes so long that the RAID setup would drop the drive thinking that there was a problem.  The idea is that drives meant for RAID have a limit on how long they can attempt to recover data.  Some desktop drives can be flashed with firmware that offers some of these features but anything that was enabled in hardware obviously won't carry over after a flash."
DataHoarder,3a5s7e,sauceysalmon,3,Wed Jun 17 16:28:22 2015 UTC,"I was eyeballing those things the other day. (correct me if I am wrong here) Those archive drives are shingled; they don't write like previous drives. They have garbage collection and on-disk caching. different animals from normal drives. A certain portion of the drive platter is set aside for initial writes that get moved during idle moments into the more dense shingled areas.  Basically; the drive's write speed is going to slow down a ton if you overload that write cache. So instead of 150mb/s it would bottom to 40-50 or something if you overload it's buffer. (Probably didn't remember that quite right; but the simulation where someone blasted the crap out of the drive on R/W has results along those lines)  They are designed for infrequent writes and heavy reads. So the not-surveillance thing makes sense.  Seagate's own product mumbo-jumbo basically says they are targeted at datacenter environments with a high read load. Etc like serving up all those Facebook photos to the gajillion people hitting refresh all day long.  Not sure that everyone out there going 'Oooh 8TB' realizes that these aren't the same meat and potatoes. Given all this I might rather reluctant to run these things in any sort of raid pooling.

DataHoarder,3a56rp,charminer,5,Wed Jun 17 09:37:19 2015 UTC,I agree. You won't see much if any space savings enabling compression over formats that are already highly compressed.
DataHoarder,3a56rp,daemonfly,5,Wed Jun 17 11:25:20 2015 UTC,"If your media is in a common media format (mp3, ogg, flac for audio jpg, png for photos or most avi, mkv, mp4 video files) compression will do next to nothing in terms of space savings.   It maybe worth it if you store raw photos, uncompressed audio files as wav or something but even then the better alternative would be to convert them to standard media formats."
DataHoarder,3a56rp,duskit0,3,Wed Jun 17 11:30:39 2015 UTC,"Most media is already compressed, so unless you have tons of text or source code, all you'll be doing is warming your house a bit and making your server slower."

DataHoarder,3a6n0o,BananaHamSalad,2,Thu Jun 18 01:20:07 2015 UTC,"They've figured out what storage vendors have known for a while, but not made readily apparent: Duty cycle counts.   Consumer-level and midline drives both typically have a duty cycle of about 40% - powered on at work on your desktop, and active during those hours, but idle or powered off otherwise for the most part - also OK for some NAS workload and archival storage.   Enterprise drives are rated for 100% duty cycle, or full workload all of the time. Think rendering jobs that takes days, weeks, or even months, churning away constantly."

I've been dickering with the idea for a while, wasn't sure if I wanted to buy a pre-built model or build a low-powered server, or build a full-featured server for visualization and the like.  Finally decided to buy a DiskStation because I sell and install a lot of them so having one at home to play with is convenient, and buying a low-cost one leaves me space to upgrade later :D  The drives are mismatched because there's a 4TB Purple sitting in a client's CCTV DVR that I'm going to swap out.  I bought it to upgrade their storage capacity, and after doing the install realized the system would only recognize 2TB.  I'm going to swap the drives and put the 4TB purple in the DS so I'll have a 4TB Red and a 4TB Purple.  I'd prefer to have matching drives but they're both designed for NAS / server install so it should be fine."

DataHoarder,3a1ggl,Dopeaz,10,Tue Jun 16 19:04:50 2015 UTC,"... sorry, it was sarcastic.  If you took out all of the zeros you'd have nothing but ones, which isn't data ;)  One method of compression -does- work at that level though, by removing series of repeating or sequential digits and replacing them with an identifier. For example, if you had 27 zeros in a row, you could replace that with 0-27 and save 23 bits. (yes this is overly simplistic but you get the idea)"

So if your drive uses 2A on 12V, and you have 15 drives, make sure your PSU can suppy 15x2A=30A on 12V rail, plus whatever the CPU and other stuff needs (usually not much during powerup so they're mutually-exclusive)."

Most people seem to prefer NAS because it's allows easier/shared access, but a DAS would totally be easier to give good read/write speeds.   A simple google search doesn't bring up any Synology products that function as a DAS, but http://www.anandtech.com/tag/das finds a few reviews of a few. The Drobo 5D also seems to have an advantage of a Thunderbolt port if you have one of those.

I mean, that 500 dollar difference must be showing up somewhere right?  Is it faster? More features? Better technology? I would like to have raid features since I want to protect the data on the unit with redundancy.   Ok, I guess I just checked the Drobo specs, some of the features it offers that might not come with then models you mentioned are:  1). The option to implement Hot Data Caching through the Drobo Accelerator Bay. Does that improve speed access so significantly that it warrants an extra 4 to 5 hundred?   2). It offers thunderbolt connectivity to my MacBook Pro, which is nice (faster than usb3). Does not come with the cable though...a stand along thunderbolt cable is 40 to 50 dollars (fucking outrageous...stupid apple proprietary tax)   3). A Battery Backup system To protect the data in case of power failure.   4). Their BeyondRaid mumbo jumbo proprietary software, I hear bad things about it...  5).

DataHoarder,3a0rzg,techmattr,2,Tue Jun 16 12:00:01 2015 UTC,Those Mediasonic devices are just external HDD enclosures. Drobo and Synology are NAS units with an entire ecosystem built around them. Synology uses better hardware and has a significantly better ecosystem which is why people prefer them. Synology also has a better soft RAID implementation.  Having the NAS will allow you to access the contents from any device and if you want you can setup QuickConnect and access it from anywhere outside your network as well.  Quality NAS units are expensive though. You're going to be looking in the $800 range for 5 bays. I wouldn't skimp on a cheaper unit either.  If you want something cheaper that's compatible with Thunderbolt I'd probably go with something like the OWC ThunderBay 4.
DataHoarder,3a0rzg,123throwaway3000,2,Tue Jun 16 15:02:00 2015 UTC,"OR you can just get a raid card for cheap from ebay for like $50 and throw that in a pc you have. it'll support multiple raid levels depending on the card, and also have hot caching, bbu, and if it ever breaks you can get a cheap replacement since its hw raid."

Last tid bit) Neither the 5D nor the enclosures I mentioned are NAS capable units because they are basically hard drive enclosures, if you want NAS capable units they are the ones that come with their own CPUs, memory, etc and they are basically really simple computers that you can attached to your router so you can access your files from your network."

DataHoarder,39x0l2,parkerlreed,2,Tue Jun 16 17:53:37 2015 UTC,"Speaking of archives, is there a place to download all the Popular Science magazines? At one point I had downloaded everything that Google Books had archived but it was just the individual pages as separate images. Trying to convert everything to a PDF was a giant PITA. (Also my script to attach the dates to each folder had a few of by one errors because of the way the archives were dated)  I've been searching for everything in a PDF collection with no luck.   EDIT: Brief overview of what I was trying.   Pulled all the book IDs from https://books.google.com/books?id=MC0DAAAAMBAJ&source=gbs_all_issues_r&cad=1&atm_aiy=2000#all_issues_anchor  Saved all of them to a file. Then ran a for loop in bash to create a directory based off the ID and then download to that folder with pysheng.   I hit some snags when trying to rename the folders so they had dates in them. Since I only pulled the ID to begin with I used some curl and cut to pull the date from the online URL. Not all matched up so it was off for quite a few issues.  Then when trying to mass convert to pdf (for loop and imagemagick) I constantly ran out of RAM. I'm sure there might be a more resource friendly way to create a PDF but that was all I could find at the time being CLI only.  EDIT2: Well since I'm starting back at this... https://github.com/parkerlreed/Partools/commit/0e62a3d84b0190cc2a817c951ef27802df4e2bea  It's a mess of curl and cat abuse but it's in a working state. The initial years file was created from just typing out all the years from the webpage into a text file by hand.  EDIT3: It's a complete mess of a script by now but I'll be damned if it isn't working. IDs and dates were pulled from just a list of the URLs and dates respectively.   #!/bin/bash function graburls(){         for i in `cat years`; do                 curl -silent -A ""Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:41.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/41.0"" ""https://books.google.com/books?id=MC0DAAAAMBAJ&source=gbs_all_issues_r&cad=1&atm_aiy=$i#all_issues_anchor"" | tidy -f /dev/null | grep --no-group-separator -B 1 caption_issue | sed '/^<center/ d' | sed '/^alt/ d';         done }  function pys2folder(){         mkdir $2         cd $2         pysheng $1         cd .. }  for i in {1..1554}; do         id=`sed -n ''$i'{p;q}' books2 | cut -d= -f2`         date=`sed -n ''$i'{p;q}' dates`         folder=`echo $date-$id`         pys2folder $id $folder;   Now it's downloading 1,554 Popular Science issues!

Parchive was originally written to solve the problem of reliable file sharing on Usenet,  but it is now commonly used for protecting any kind of data from data corruption, bit rot, and accidental or malicious damage. Despite the name, Parchive uses more advanced techniques that do not utilize simplistic parity methods of error detection and correction.

DataHoarder,39z2v0,Techpumpkin_WD,1 point,Tue Jun 16 03:24:19 2015 UTC,"Hello there,   I don't see anything alarming within this SMART data. The drive has been in use for some time, but apart from that it looks in good shape. I would however advise that you use the HDD manufacturer diagnostics tool as some SMART attributes are vendor specific, and others reported in a slightly different way for different manufacturers.   As for the normalized values – as far as I can see all the values are above the threshold. And that's what we would normally like to see. Normalized values usually start from 100 or 252 and count down to 0. So it would be alarming if any of the values is below the treshold. If it's above then the SMART data isn't detecting any problems at the moment. However SMART cannot always predict the upcoming failure, so having proper backup strategy is the only way you can make sure that your data is safe.   Is there a reason why you are concerned about this HDD health, or was this just a routine check?"

DataHoarder,39uwvq,pannkakorna,2,Mon Jun 15 02:15:11 2015 UTC,"TLER is more important for RAID cards that decide a device is offline if it doesn't respond within a short timeout window. Time-limited Error Recovery (TLER) is a setting that prevents the hard drive from spending extra time trying to read from a bad/flaky sector. The green drives definitely don't have that feature, so it's basically left up to the kernel to decide when to give up talking to a device. On Linux that should be ~30 seconds (during which time you can't continue any further IO to the zpool). I'm not sure about the setting on other Unices. There's an open PR on zfs-on-linux for being able to do the equivalent of TLER in the disk subsystem: https://github.com/zfsonlinux/zfs/pull/2387  TL;DR: not having TLER can cause your array to behave poorly if you have bad sectors, but it shouldn't affect data integrity in ZFS."

What is the transfer between the two PCs?  Can you set up NIC teaming on the PCs/ReadyNAS?  Nic teaming will nearly double your throughput (minus overhead) IF your switch can even handle it.    Some switches advertise they are gigabit, but they mean the ports are. The switch itself has a maximum speed and sometimes it's only 2000Mbps SHARED across all ports. Plugging 8 gigabit devices into the switch means they all slow down (2000 divided by 8) like a traffic jam on the freeway. You need to check for total speed on the switch.   Check out this example: 16 1Gb ports, Switch Fabric: 32 Gbps meaning you can actually run all 16 ports at 2Gbps w/ full duplex 1Gb.

Let's you easily play video from your phone to XBMC, has a notification and call plugin, etc.   Big picture is a great screen saver. Pictures from news events as screen saver.  Learn how to edit the XML config files directly for really fine control of the settings, like how far skip forward/back goes, what RSS feeds scroll on you homepage, etc. Check out the official wiki for lots of help.  Install the update library  plugin if XBMC is always on. It will update your media on the hour. Don't set it to scan music. The music libary is handled differently than video.  If you are running on windows, use the free serverwmc backend to pipe windows media centers tuner into it.

DataHoarder,39tt7s,arcosapphire,6,Sun Jun 14 18:33:27 2015 UTC,"I would suggest a DS1515+.   Raid 5-capable (I'd suggest utilizing Synology Hybrid RAID (SHR)) 5 Bay - run a hot spare or a 5-drive array. Plug in up to 2 more expansion units to double or triple drive capacity.  USB 3.0 ports for external expansion and backups File sharing with FTP, SMB2, SMB3 (encryption), AFP, NFS and WebDAV. Multimedia / Video Station works great.  Apps available for mobile devices and it can show as a DNLA device for TV / game systems. Download station is literally made for regular file downloads (torrents) Yeah. For what you get, the cost is very reasonable in my opinion.     Full Disclosure: I sell and install these for clients.  I don't work for Synology or receive compensation, I just think they're good little boxes."

DataHoarder,39tt7s,bughHD,1 point,Mon Jun 15 02:16:40 2015 UTC,"It looks similar to Raid 5 for storage capacity,  but I think Synology has done more dev work to make it as reliable as high performance as possible for the DS.

DataHoarder,39tt7s,wanderingbilby,1 point,Mon Jun 15 13:05:35 2015 UTC,"Thanks. $750+ is bit pricier than I was looking for, but I imagine it's a good product."
DataHoarder,39tt7s,wanderingbilby,3,Mon Jun 15 00:15:49 2015 UTC,"The nice thing with Synology is that every product gets the same DSM - so you could pick up a DS115 for $99 and start there.  I'd suggest getting at least a 2-bay DS214se ($152).  A DS414J ($388) would work well for you too.  The biggest difference between the J models and the + models is the CPU and ram - you get faster processors and more ram (the DS1515+ has expandable ram).  The larger models can also accept an expansion unit, and generally have USB 3.0 ports.  Synology's comparison tool is a good place to start.  If you pick up a 1 or 2 bay now and decide you want a larger unit later, you can re-sell the original or convert it into a backup unit - DiskStations talk to each other very well for backup purposes."

In order for the parity to be valid, data needs to be synced across all the disks. This stresses the disk out a lot more than normal use. If you lose another disk during this 'higher than normal workload', you lose everything. This wasn't really an issue when we had smaller drives to worry about. A raid rebuild didn't take very long in the grand scheme of things... Nowadays, we have much larger disks, with more data that has to be synced across all the disks at once...."

I mean, those drives are just doing a read operation across the disk, probably linearly, which barely stresses the heads at all.  In contrast, with JBOD, if you lose a disk, that's it. And that happens often enough.  Edit: does RAID 6 solve the problem, given two parity disks?

DataHoarder,39renl,Endda,7,Sun Jun 14 00:45:31 2015 UTC,Since you have mixed size drives and know you'll want to arbitrarily expand in the future I would think unraid is a better fit for you.
DataHoarder,39renl,bahwhateverr,1 point,Sun Jun 14 01:03:04 2015 UTC,Do you know if the data protection/recovery of unRaid is as good as FreeNAS?
DataHoarder,39renl,bahwhateverr,3,Sun Jun 14 01:11:07 2015 UTC,"It's tough to compare because with unraid you have one choice and with freenas you have several.  Edit: I'll expand a bit. The last time I looked at unraid it used a single dedicated parity disk. So you can lose that disk or any other disk and still have your data. So in that regard it's like a raidz1 in freenas terms. If unraid allows a second parity disk then that would be along the lines of a raidz2 in freenas, if it doesn't then freenas can offer you greater protection. Aside from that, the main trade off is unraid lets you easily expand, and expand with mixed size drives as long as they are equal to or smaller than your parity disk. Freenas will give you much higher performance. I don't know how unraid stacks up along side ZFS in terms of the features like checksums, compression, snapshots, clones, bit rot correction, ARC, etc."
DataHoarder,39renl,bahwhateverr,2,Sun Jun 14 01:24:33 2015 UTC,"Thank you for expanding on this. I'm really new to this whole custom NAS stuff. I'm looking into the number of parity disks for unRaid at the moment. I don't see the need for having two parity disks though. I mean, I understand that anything can happen and if two disks die then I'm screwed. It just seems rare.  I have heard that performance is worse on unRaid but I'm literally only using the box to copy media to/from it. I keep the storage off until I need something, then I boot it up, copy data to or from it and then I turn it off. I don't stream anything from it so performance really isn't a big deal to me"
DataHoarder,39renl,Moussekateer,4,Sun Jun 14 01:57:15 2015 UTC,"No problem. This may also shed some light on it for you. FreeNAS would be under the ZFS column in the comparison, more or less."

So you can lose that disk or any other disk and still have your data. So in that regard it's like a raidz1 in freenas terms.   There's one important big difference though, unRAID doesn't stripe your data. This means if two drives were to die in your freenas raidz1 array you'd lose everything, while in unRAID you'd only lose the data on those two drives (if you're lucky one of which is the parity drive and then you've only lost one drive's worth of data)."
DataHoarder,39renl,Moussekateer,1 point,Sun Jun 14 14:44:42 2015 UTC,If you lose two disks can't you recover one of them with the parity disk?
DataHoarder,39renl,bahwhateverr,1 point,Sun Jun 14 14:48:53 2015 UTC,"No it wouldn't be possible to recover any of the data on either of those drives with only one parity disk, you'd need at least two parity disks."

I'm using UnRAID, moved over to it from my Windows 2012R2 box with DrivePool.     Currently using UnRAID 6rc6a with the usual Plex/Sonarr/NZBGet/Deluge/etc Dockers, and only running two drives, one data, one parity.  The cache drives are a pair of SSDs running in a btrfs mirrored pool, both for speed and redundancy.  I can also run VMs on there using KVM.  I found FreeNAS to be unnecessarily complicated, resource heavy, and fussy with hardware.  UnRAID runs just fine on a Core2Duo machine with 4GB RAM.  A lot of folks are still using Atom D525 machines with Dockers and maybe 8+ drives hanging off it."
DataHoarder,39renl,wolfcry0,1 point,Sun Jun 14 16:15:49 2015 UTC,Thanks for the information. I'll be going with unRaid in a month or two once I have the money for this new box :)

I don't know what a WD EX2100 is but I'm going to assume it's some form of RAID so it has basic redundancy. That along with backing up to the external is a solid plan.   Edit: Oh and if the precious is truly precious consider a second external that you perform a second backup to and store at a different physical location."

One of the reasons I shied away from Kodi was because I just want a program to scrape information and organize the files.  Kodi seems to be an entire media center for music and pictures and everything but I just need a program for movies and TV.

Often times, I'll have 2 or more formats of the movie itself, differing in bitrates, and when I download subtitles, sometimes I'll just unzip them all into the folder, not really caring which 100KB files I keep, so I end up with Hungarian, Chinese, Slovak, Russian and Hebrew subtitles that I know I'll never use, but it's not worth the disk space or inodes to clear it out.

DataHoarder,39li9g,jduke1,16,Fri Jun 12 15:57:25 2015 UTC,Download the highest quality off the start. So in other words skip 720p and just go right away to 1080p. You will want it eventually.
DataHoarder,39li9g,wrinkles88,9,Fri Jun 12 16:13:34 2015 UTC,"Even for TV shows though?  That's just so huge...  Looking at some of my TV shows.  House MD for example in 720p is 376GB.  In 1080p it would be 600GB, just for 1 TV show.  I have over 100 shows, the space for this really starts to get expensive!  I took both the 1080p and 720p copies of an episode and pulled them both up at the same frame in several different scenes on my 136"" 1080p projection system and stood only a few feet away from the screen and tab-switched quickly back and forth between them and found the difference to be absolutely miniscule.  Only in some of the fine details like hair or complex textures could I see the 1080p was slightly sharper.  Moving back to about 8ft away I lost the ability to see any difference.  I normally sit 14ft away from my 136"" and at that distance it's impossible for me to see any difference even if I know which one I'm viewing.  I should note that I have perfectly normal vision and am pretty picky about my qualities.  These were BluRay rips I was comparing so about 2.2GB for a 45 minute 720p episode and 3.3GB for a 1080p episode.  For movies that are new, I will get 1080p.  For movies older than about 2000 or so I usually get the 720p, unless it's been remastered or was a gigantic budget film that used high quality processes.  I have done lots more extensive comparison between 720p (~5GB) and 1080p (~10GB) rips from BluRay and there are many older films from the 70s-90s for example that I cannot see any difference between."
DataHoarder,39li9g,SirMaster,4,Fri Jun 12 16:40:29 2015 UTC,"I pretty much agree with you to be honest. I used to think ""I can't tell the difference what's the point"".

I did that at first, but after a while just said ""fuck it"" and went back and re-did everything with 1080p.  If porn can be in 1080p and 4K, TV shows can definitely be 1080p."
DataHoarder,39li9g,Y0tsuya,7,Fri Jun 12 17:00:42 2015 UTC,"I just did it from a cost perspective.  I only have about 10TB of TV shows, but in order to go to 1080p I would need about double that.  10TB costs me about $720 to store.  I didn't think that $720 was worth the difference in quality that I can't even see from a viewing distance that is actually considered on the close side for my screen size.  I'd just rather have a library with twice as much content instead of a tiny ""upgrade"" in quality.  But it's a choice."

And unfortunately storage isn't infinite heh.  I should clarify that I do and have upgraded quality.  I replace HDTV and WebDL with BluRay for TV shows, one they come out.  My movie collection used to be DVD, and then it was all 720p, now it's about half 1080p.  But I just figured out what seemed to be a reasonable tradeoff for storage space and quality that made sense to me.  I even brought in friends to do blind testing between samples and my conclusion was for double the space, nobody can even tell a difference heh.  Obviously 1080p isn't useless at all and I love it as much as the next guy and in some cases it does make a difference (primarily any new movies released over the last decade or so), but it just doesn't seem to for TV shows and older films to me for whatever reason."

DataHoarder,39li9g,trevyz,3,Fri Jun 12 20:33:31 2015 UTC,Why?
DataHoarder,39li9g,Shririnovski,2,Fri Jun 12 22:15:08 2015 UTC,"Pretty basic reasons, if you are hoarding data thats 95% recoverable by downloads, you dont wanna risk sitting there rebuilding a raid for ALL your data (even if you have 2 parity disks). If you use a proper software raid you can take the array apart and save the data of all those, and just redownload or aquire whats missing some way. My experience is also that software parity is faster to rebuild and maintain also. I just rebuild my software raid (lost a 8TB drive) and was up&running within 12h (with all the content on the other drives available all the time"
DataHoarder,39li9g,geosmack,2,Fri Jun 12 22:31:31 2015 UTC,"Your Software Raid sounds like it is pretty much doing the same things a hardware raid would. (Which it technically should)   Also rebuilding a raid takes it's time, but downloading the data again would be even more time consuming and copying the data from a degraded raid would take time AND the additional free space to copy to, not everybody has that luxury. And the solution of copying the data back from backup, well it will again take it's time and may also result in the loss of a few files, depending on how often you backup your data. So I would try to rebuild my raids, because that's the main reason I have raid, the ability to lose a drive or two and just beeing able to hotswap the drive out and let the raid do it's job.   The one issue I see with hardware raid is the controller. If that dies, you will need a new compatible controller to access your raid again, while with software solutions like zfs you can just hook up the drives to whatever controller you want."

I looked for compression settings and didn't find any, so I didn't think Veeam did compression. I was going to disable it if I found it since most of the data is music and video that won't compress anyway.  The first full backup it took of my girlfriends machine when I set that up a few weeks ago took about 4 hours for 250 GB over a 10/100 link."

DataHoarder,39gmo0,minecraft_ece,1 point,Fri Jun 12 02:47:00 2015 UTC,"WinFS:       WinFS (short for Windows Future Storage)  is the code name for a canceled  data storage and management system project based on relational databases, developed by Microsoft and first demonstrated in 2003 as an advanced storage subsystem for the Microsoft Windows operating system, designed for persistence and management of structured, semi-structured as well as unstructured data.  WinFS includes a relational database for storage of information, and allows any type of information to be stored in it, provided there is a well defined schema for the type. Individual data items could then be related together by relationships, which are either inferred by the system based on certain attributes or explicitly stated by the user. As the data has a well defined schema, any application can reuse the data; and using the relationships, related data can be effectively organized as well as retrieved. Because the system knows the structure and intent of the information, it can be used to make complex queries that enable advanced searching through the data and aggregating various data items by exploiting the relationships between them.  While WinFS and its shared type schema make it possible for an application to recognize the different data types, the application still has to be coded to render the different data types. Consequently, it would not allow development of a single application that can view or edit all data types; rather what WinFS enables applications to understand is the structure of all data and extract the information that it can use further. When WinFS was introduced at the 2003 Professional Developers Conference, Microsoft also released a video presentation, named IWish,  showing mockup interfaces that showed how applications would expose interfaces that take advantage of a unified type system. The concepts shown in the video ranged from applications using the relationships of items to dynamically offer filtering options to applications grouping multiple related data types and rendering them in a unified presentation.    Image i - A mockup calendar application sorting images by the dates and using their relationship with contacts to filter the images. WinFS aimed at providing a shared schema system that would enable such a scenario.

I should point out that one of the big reasons why this hasn't caught on hugely is that you simply aren't saving any developer time overall, or enabling anything radically new.  At it's core, your idea is no different than if every program standardized on the same file format.  You are simply moving things down into the filesystem or object-store level for dubious benefit.  Every program still has to understand what an image and photo are; the underlying binary format and associated API is probably the most trivial part.  Also, you are creating a huge bottleneck to innovation.  To expand on your example, what about cameras that produce raw format photos.  These are raw dumps form the camera's sensors that photoshop can use directly.  Different cameras have completely different file formats.  How would you handle that.....  OK, now how would you hand that if your system has already been online for a couple of years.  Or how about all the compression protocols; gif, jpeg, tif, png, etc.  You now have to put all this in at the OS level instead of leaving it to the applications.     Why we are keeping on file systems?    Because filesystems are remarkably good at storing unknown blobs of data reliably.  And so far they have been future-proof, as the overall design of the filesystem (from a user perspective) hasn't changed much in decades.  BTW, you might be interested in researching the filesystem used on Macs.  Every file can have a separate resource section (fork) containing metadata and the filesystem has a API for accessing it."

Well, no; format of a file is a different thing, attributes of a file is a different thing. Every type of file has different attributes that are same for all files of that type, regardless how they are encoded (png, jpeg, gif...).  We can agree on some default types and their attributes like persons, images, photographs, documents, e-mails etc. to assure compatibility between different programs.

Every type of file has different attributes that are same for all files of that type, regardless how they are encoded (png, jpeg, gif...).   No.  I can define a file format as including the metadata attributes you are interested in.  EXIF metadata is a perfect example.  You are proposing moving that format down to the filesystem level.   But it doesn't fundamentally change what I need out of an API to access that metadata.   An image is an image, regardless of it's format.    No.  Sometimes an image is an animated movie (gif), Sometimes it is actually a collection of images (multipage tif).  But you are missing my point.  You are locking down what an Image is and the definitions of metadata for that image by building it into the filesystem.  I think you are missing the big picture here.   How things work now is that a program calls a function from an image library to load metadata.  Lets look at the example of embedding a GPS location into an image file:  myImage = LoadJPegImage(""file location"");  // a function from a 3rd party library myExif = myImage->GetExifData(); myGpsCoordinates = myExif->location;   Let's compare that to what you are proposing:  myImage = ReadFile(""file location"");  // a function provided by the OS myMetaData = myImage->GetMetadata(); myGpsCoordinates = myMetaData->location;   Notice that the application has to do the same basic operations to access the embedded location.  The only difference is whether it is calling a 3rd party library or something built into the filesystem.  From the perspective of an application, you haven't gained anything.  The same is true for the usecase of searching/querying.  You've just moved the work of indexing and querying to the filesystem instead of in the application.  But what have you gained?"

DataHoarder,39c27g,gambra,5,Wed Jun 10 19:24:07 2015 UTC,"Hi, I am a live music collector who shares your  pains. Over the years my philosophy morphed from a short-term hoarding-without-abandon headspace to a long-term preservationist strategy. Thinking that professionals had already figured this all out, I read articles, books, and have watched online lectures by members of Library of Congress, National Archives and other preservation and museum organizations. While I learned many things and found some helpful tools, I discovered that even the pros still struggle.   So to counteract this I rename and retag everything to the Etree standards to provide a standardised formatting in my folders.   I agree with keeping to Etree standards. A band in your collection may eventually be authorized for submission to the Live Music Archive. Doing the work now will make it easy for you to contribute to the archive in the future. Artist abbreviations can be a problem. I'm guided by whatever tends to be used by the genre's scene. E.g., for Industrial, Front 242 is f242, Front Line Assembly is fla. However, there can be problem artists; do I use sp for Smashing Pumpkins or for Skinny Puppy? I'm glad rename scripts exist.   enter the Artist, Track Titles (Date & Track number of none are available)...   As long as filenames are up to etree standards I think that the tags just need to be readable and make sense. Mine are similar to yours: Track: Song Title (live City YYYY)  Sort Name: Song Title YYYY-MM-DD  Album: Month DD, YYYY at Venue, City, State/Nation  Sort Album: YYYY-MM-DD  Comments: Recorded live at Venue, City, State on Month DD, YYYY. The Tour Name. Audience recording by Person to minidisc. Performers  Genre: Genre - Live       Of course the major flaw in renaming/tagging files is that I can no longer seed them on any sites and have changed the checksum variables.   My solution was to just zip up into a single file the original music files, the ffp and checksum, the .torrent file, and a newly generated text document with the torrent's original description and link from the tracker. It gets dumped into an archive after I'm done processing the copy for my active music collection. This balloons my data storage requirement, but I decided it was the best way to keep clear the lineage and quickly fulfill a reseed request. I should also mention that I am in the Apple ecosystem. My processed FLAC files are then transcoded to ALAC using XLD.       my cataloguing to a peice of software called PHPRecDB which is used by a few others to create lists of live recordings.   Looks like a nice solution, thanks for sharing. Like you, most of my stuff is from Dime, but I also grab items from other trackers and specialized blogs. ""Is this recording the same as what I grabbed elsewhere 2 years ago?"" Fortunately, FLAC has an internal checksum on the music data itself that ignores the tag info (externally represented by an ffp). Meaning, I can check if two recordings are exactly the same even if the md5 associated with the tracks have changed. If there are two versions of the same recording, but with mismatched ffp, BWF MetaEdit can be used for further checksum analysis on the uncompressed WAV. If I am being picky and there was another failure to match, maybe because FLAC files were created from MP3 copies, then I will drop files into Audacity and look at the audio waveforms.      Of course, after spending all these hours tagging and documenting everything to my persnickety specifications I do backups and digital rot monitoring is important. ;)  Overall, I think your continued use of FLAC with Etree naming standards are best practices."
DataHoarder,39c27g,consumer_x,2,Thu Jun 11 09:03:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah I've tried to keep the archives in some form of well accepted tagging & naming system and most of the more ""official"" forms just don't work well for live recordings. The Etree standards are by far the best and really should be encforced but really I'm just happy that recordings get out in the first place so can't complain too much. My eventual intention with this is to start an archive website similar to the Nine Inch Nails one I mentioned above but the data requirements are prety large so for the moment I just run a regular upload blog with files on Mega.   Artist abbreviations can be a problem   Yeah I do run into this problem but generally I just use the full artist name unless it's overly long or has an accepted abbreviation on the Etree list, I don't see the point in doing it for very large collections. Like in my collection alone there'd be four different artists with AF as their abbreviation (Arcade Fire, Agnostic Front, American Football & Akron Family) and all are still playing gigs meaning it'd be impossible to remember which is which.   My solution was to just zip up into a single file the original music files, the ffp and checksum etc.   I do this this for everthing that isn't the actual music files, the FFP's stay the same even if you rename them or add metadata (only the MD5's change) so there's proof that I haven't changed the actual audio. If there's any extra files (pictures etc) I keep those in the actual fileset.  I couldn't possibly store all the original files though if I were transcoding to something like ALAC then I probably would. If I upload any of the edited files I just include a note saying that they've been renamed/cleaned since the last upload. I'm glad the kind of stuff I go after generally isn't video since that would lead to horrific amounts of storage but I keep finding myself downloading 1080i TV broacasts which are always massive.."

DataHoarder,39agb3,rya_nc,2,Wed Jun 10 12:42:48 2015 UTC,"Out of curiosity, is there something equivalent to RAID-5 parity for optical discs? Something like burning two discs worth of data onto three, but if one is destroyed you could reconstruct the third."
DataHoarder,39agb3,Virtualization_Freak,3,Wed Jun 10 18:05:02 2015 UTC,"dvdisaster is not quite what you're asking for, but similar."
DataHoarder,39agb3,5-4-3-2-1-bang,1 point,Wed Jun 10 23:11:32 2015 UTC,It's nothing that can't be done. The filesystem of optical disks has built in parity.   Checksumming and parity would be a more resilient solution than raid.
DataHoarder,39agb3,Virtualization_Freak,3,Wed Jun 10 18:41:06 2015 UTC,"Checksumming and parity would be a more resilient solution than raid.    That assumes your failure mode is graceful degredation.  If your failure mode is ""can't read the entire disc"", all the parity in the world on that same disc isn't going to help you."

DataHoarder,39agb3,snrrub,2,Wed Jun 10 21:13:11 2015 UTC,"If I understand it correctly, you're referring to checksum and parity on the block or file level? I know that the filesystem already has built in parity, but it doesn't span multiple discs (normally). Sure, if a few blocks on a particular disc are inaccessible because of say a scratch they can still be reconstructed from the parity data on the disc. But, if the whole disc is physically destroyed then the data on it is still gone.  That is, unless you have distributed parity that spans multiple discs. If parity data spans say 3 discs (with the corresponding capacity penalty), then if one disc is destroyed the data on it could still be reconstructed from the parity data on the remaining two.  I know such a thing is possible in principle and RAID-5 works like that. I know enough that I could write a tool to automatically generate disc images with parity if I wanted to, but I'm wondering if such a thing already exists, specifically for optical discs."
DataHoarder,39agb3,minecraft_ece,4,Wed Jun 10 19:10:16 2015 UTC,"It's easy to do with Winrar.   Take the files you want to burn, set your split to the size of your optical media (eg 4.7GB) and choose one or more recovery volumes."
DataHoarder,39agb3,snrrub,1 point,Wed Jun 10 20:51:45 2015 UTC,An alternative is to use quickpar.  It produces external recovery files.
DataHoarder,39agb3,wickedplayer494,1 point,Fri Jun 12 02:15:07 2015 UTC,Yep.   The reason I suggested winrar is simply that it accomplishes his hypothetical example all in one go. Split your data into media sized chunks (eg 4.7GB) and create media size recovery volumes in one in step and with very simple configuration.   I wouldn't do this exact way personally. Large archives the size of your disc are dangerous. Was just a quick easy example.

DataHoarder,39agb3,snrrub,2,Thu Jun 11 07:57:24 2015 UTC,I wonder how this is compares to using tape storage in terms of both durability and pricing.
DataHoarder,39agb3,rtechie1,2,Thu Jun 11 12:04:51 2015 UTC,Tape is clearly cheaper: http://www.hpcwire.com/2014/02/13/blu-ray-cold-storage-tape/ but Blu-Ray may last longer.
DataHoarder,39agb3,rtechie1,2,Thu Jun 11 14:47:17 2015 UTC,"The raw media price is way off in that article. He says $0.41 per GB for 100GB optical.   Clearly that's wrong, Sony sell a 1.5TB optical cartridge (12 quad-layer 128GB discs) for ~$140 single-unit retail. That's something like $0.10 per GB.   Quad layer discs are much more expensive per GB than triple-layer that he talks about. And the price above is for a single unit at retail.   So I gotta think Facebook or anybody else buying data center quantities of 100GB discs direct from Sony is getting pretty close to the quoted LTO raw media cost of $0.02 per GB"
DataHoarder,39agb3,snrrub,2,Thu Jun 11 17:35:47 2015 UTC,Tape is for backup. This is for long term data archive.   Currently the best solution is probably UDO.
DataHoarder,39agb3,rtechie1,1 point,Thu Jun 11 15:57:15 2015 UTC,"BD-R is extremely slow, several hours to burn each disc. That's why it never took off.   The only advantage over tape is that BD-Rs probably have a better shelf life.   Sony just left the market for magneto-optical, their previous cold storage solution."
DataHoarder,39agb3,snrrub,2,Wed Jun 10 20:58:26 2015 UTC,I burn 25GB discs in 16 mins (6x speed) in a consumer drive. I know people who burn discs at 8x or 10x.   Sony's own optical archive solution uses multiple laser heads to read and write many times higher than consumer drives. I can only assume that these larger scale projects use something similar.

I would recommend going the homebrew-nas method, build one with existing hardware, buy some drives, stick them in it.

DataHoarder,39bufg,Pinesol_Shots,2,Thu Jun 11 22:25:20 2015 UTC,RAID takes a bunch of drives (ideally the same size) and presents them as one big disk which you put one filesystem on. You wont need to worry about going between multiple disks to look for files.
DataHoarder,39bufg,IMR800X,1 point,Fri Jun 12 07:15:45 2015 UTC,"What if I add more drives? How is RAID redundancy then? Hipothetically if I have 2 Drives in RAID, how am I protected against 1 failing?"
DataHoarder,39bufg,lackrays,1 point,Sat Jun 13 12:19:11 2015 UTC,"There are different ""RAID levels"" depending on how much failure protection you want in your array. If you only had two disks, you would use a RAID1. A RAID1 gives you a mirrored copy of your data on all hard drives in the array. Your useable space is equal to the space of the smallest hard drive.  However, if you add more hard drives you can use RAID levels that give you higher performance and higher redundancy. A RAID0 will break up your data into chunks and put a chunk on each disk in the array. When you do this you get excellent performance because each disk only has to do the reading and writing of 1/n the disks in the array. Hang on though -- what if one of those disks fails? Yes, you'll lose the data stored on every drive in the array. With more drives in the array you are increasing your chance of failure too.  Along come RAID5 and RAID6; these give you the performance boost of RAID0 with redundancy! It works by using a chunk of the storage space on each disk to write ""parity data"" that instructs the array how to rebuild lost data if a drive dies. A RAID5 gives you protection from 1 disk failure. If you run a RAID5 and a disk dies, you need to replace it before another disk dies or you will lose all of your data. The process of replacing a failed hard drive in a RAID5/6 means letting the system reconstruct all of the missing data and recalculate parity -- it takes a very long time if you use large hard drives, so this is considered risky nowadays. A RAID6 allows you to lose two hard drives with no data loss. Of course, you pay for it with less available storage space. This is the most popular RAID level for NAS users.  Slowly adding storage over time is where RAID is a problem. You really want a handful of disks up front. RAID6 is nonsensical unless you're going to start with 5-7 disks. The ZFS filesystem does have the ability to use multiple RAID arrays in a ""pool,"" allowing you to add more arrays to the pool as you need to grow, but you really can't do much to grow or shrink a RAID once you create it. If splurging on a bundle of disks up front is totally out of the question, then buy 2 hard drives and run them as a ZFS mirrored vdev (RAID1). When it's time to upgrade? Buy two more disks and add another mirrored vdev to the ZFS pool. Your performance will increase as you keep adding these two-drive RAID1 pairs and each drive will still be protected from failure by its partner.  PM me if you have any questions."

DataHoarder,397h0n,speckz,16,Tue Jun 9 20:24:37 2015 UTC,"How long until the helium dissipates, rendering the drive unusable?  Not trying to be snarky here, just asking."
DataHoarder,397h0n,CowboyProgrammer,5,Tue Jun 9 22:31:29 2015 UTC,"If the helium leaked out and was replaced with regular air, would it no longer work?"
DataHoarder,397h0n,numnum30,5,Tue Jun 9 22:41:20 2015 UTC,It's possible that helium wouldn't be replaced by air. Holes big enough for helium to get out might not be big enough for air to get in.
DataHoarder,397h0n,MaunaLoona,5,Wed Jun 10 07:46:18 2015 UTC,Helium leaks not just from holes but straight through materials.   That said you are still correct and air won't get in.
DataHoarder,397h0n,CarVac,3,Wed Jun 10 13:02:49 2015 UTC,In that case only a certain amount of helium can escape due to the vacuum left behind.
DataHoarder,397h0n,Shaka1277,1 point,Wed Jun 10 11:46:34 2015 UTC,"No, it'll match the partial pressure of helium outside, which is effectively zero."
DataHoarder,397h0n,CarVac,0,Wed Jun 10 13:01:55 2015 UTC,Nope. There will be a point at which the drives will contain a low amount of helium and no more can escape due to the low internal pressure. Partial pressure won't overcome that.
DataHoarder,397h0n,Shaka1277,-1,Wed Jun 10 15:46:06 2015 UTC,"In terms of equilibrium across a barrier that only admits one species, there will always be more helium escaping than entering as long as the pressure of the pure helium inside is greater than the partial pressure of helium outside.   Other molecules (the rest of the air) cannot affect the equilibrium, though they can affect the rate."
DataHoarder,397h0n,CarVac,4,Wed Jun 10 15:49:50 2015 UTC,"Air is more viscous than helium so the head would fly higher.  The drive would either stop working entirely or revert to a slower recovery mode.  It's like they run on a ""magic smoke"" that's colorless and odorless."

Actually, thinking about it, the helium will leak out but no larger molecules will leak in, leaving a partial vacuum (to match the partial pressure of helium in the atmosphere which is ~0) and causing the heads to crash.  Eventually."
DataHoarder,397h0n,CarVac,3,Wed Jun 10 12:59:28 2015 UTC,It only needs to work until the warranty runs out...
DataHoarder,397h0n,sfacets,6,Wed Jun 10 06:26:17 2015 UTC,I'm wondering if the drive would slow down if all the helium escapes.  (Why bother having a sensor to measure the amount of helium if you're not planning on doing something with that information?)

Here's my attempt:  Individual bits of data are very light, but the weight adds up the more data increases. For example, a Byte of data weighs 8 times as much as a Bit. All this data is loaded onto the platters making them heavier. Helium helps by lifting the platters making it possible to hold more data on the drive."

DataHoarder,398dl8,skelleton_exo,1 point,Wed Jun 10 18:49:50 2015 UTC,Yes especially since all traffic comes from gigabit LAN anyway.

Floppy drives of article  Binary prefix:       Floppy disks have existed in numerous physical and logical formats, and have been sized inconsistently. In part, this is because the end user capacity of a particular disk is a function of the controller hardware, so that the same disk could be formatted to a variety of capacities. In many cases, the media are marketed without any indication of the end user capacity, as for example, DSDD, meaning double-sided double-density.  The last widely adopted diskette was the 3½-inch high density. This has a formatted capacity of 1474560 bytes or 1440 KB (1440 × 1024, using ""KB"" in the customary binary sense). These are marketed as ""HD"", or ""1.44 MB"" or both. This usage creates a third definition of ""megabyte"" as 1000×1024 bytes.  Most operating systems display the capacity using ""MB"" in the customary binary sense, resulting in a display of ""1.4 MB"" (1.40625 MB). Some users have noticed the missing 0.04 MB and both Apple and Microsoft have support bulletins referring to them as 1.4 MB.

I'm always worried about the increasing size of spinning hard drives in contrast to the stagnant failure rates...isn't there a point where a RAID5 or RAID6 won't be effective because of the chance of an unrecoverable failure during the time it takes to rebuild the degraded array?

DataHoarder,395zty,encaseme,2,Wed Jun 10 02:19:21 2015 UTC,"Hmmmm... Cygwin is good but can be a pain to install, for whatever reason it takes forever on anything I've ever tried.

DataHoarder,395zty,fryfrog,5,Wed Jun 10 06:54:34 2015 UTC,"I think you're on the right track for something like Syncthing. I have a similar setup for my family. I use btsync because it is easier to set up on the ""servers"", for some reason Syncthing is much harder to configure multiple instances on the same host. Everyone's Documents directory is an individual btsync share. I have 2-3 servers that they sync with and also each PC that they'd use. That way, they don't have to change any behaviors. They know that if they save it to their Documents folder, it gets replicated and backed up.  I also have Crashplan running on all our computers, both the servers and the clients. I could get away with just having it on the servers, but since I got their Family plan I might as well use it.  Using rsync is a great solution for some problems, but I'd consider it a one way sync. With btsync (and tools like it), multiple people using the ""share"" won't clobber each other quite as badly."

My ""backup system"" is just having 3 pc's permanently BT Synched so I can switch machine whenever I need to.  And importantly: in case you need it, it's Peer-to-Peer. So if your family also wants the same consolidated photoset, instead of just sending the files to you in one direction, you can all share a single automatically updated folder."

DataHoarder,391t06,eleitl,8,Mon Jun 8 18:16:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah you would think 16GB is plenty, but by default Java based programs can't simply keep allocating memory until you run out of swap space, the JVM limits them to some defined amount of max memory (most programs override the default with their own default in a config someplace, but if that default is too small still, you'll get crashes / errors ... ) - It may only be using 512MB or 1GB or something like that by default."

DataHoarder,391t06,user99299,3,Mon Jun 8 19:26:06 2015 UTC,I have had a similar problem managing a large ebook library. After a good bit of research it does seem like Calibre is the most user friendly. It's possible there are specific books in your collection causing Calibre to misbehave. I believe there is logging available that could help with it.  I have been working on a custom solution based around Apache Solr that would enable me to have a more modern web based library management solution along with full text searching. So if you are into development it may be an option considering the size of your library.

I believe this was due to a firmware bug where the drive became unaware of how old it was, and it was therefore unable to judge how fast the disks were spinning up (they spin up slightly slower as the disk ages), and the heads would move over the platters before they were spinning fast enough and would crash into the platter because the air currents weren't strong enough to cause the head to float properly.  Anyone know if they managed to fix this in a firmware update, and what firmware version you'd want?"

I called Seagate to complain about two drives that died two days past its warranty and two weeks past its warranty and they did replace them, but the drives I got back went on a shelf for cold spares, when I tried to use them a couple months later, both replacement drives were DOA right after removing the static bag.

As you said, the data is encrypted on my end, so it wouldn't be possible to infect myself with anything they upload.   which in turn is backed up on Crashplan.   This is wrong. I assumed it would work that way as well, but the CrashPlan software is programmed to recognize it's own files and prevent you from uploading them to the CrashPlan servers. I saw the exclusion in the my.service.xml configuration file so it might be something you can override, but I have never actually tested that.  You might be better off with some sort of software to mirror a folder on their machine to your NAS. This is how I handle backing up the local machines in my house..

On the Synology, I have an encrypted volume. When the NAS boots, I have to login to the web interface and enter the key to mount the volume. I also use Crashplan with a custom encryption key both on the PC and on the Synology to backup around 3 TB of NAS-data online. The (soldered) 2 GB of RAM of the 415+ will put a limit at of around 4-5 TB backup data I think. If you want to backup more with Crashplan, You will need a higher end Synology, e.g. a 1515+. Transfer speed is awesome with the new synologys and encrypted volumes. on my old DS411+ I had only around 17 MB/s, but the new oney have special hardware encryption features that give me around 70-80 MB/s in practice.

It's not outright completely broken, depending on how they're using it, but that they're doing so in the first place does not encourage me to give them the benefit of the doubt.  Unfortunately you're unlikely to find the best option acceptable.  Maybe Least Authority or SpiderOak, or your favourite cloud storage platform and Duplicity or Arq.

DataHoarder,38t0un,SisyphusAmericanus,4,Sat Jun 6 16:44:09 2015 UTC,"If the HDD size is greater than 1TB, you should always select a dual-parity solution (either RAID-Z2, RAID6 or RAID10DM.)  This is because a disk failure is more probable during a rebuild operation due to the high number of reads. Larger disks take longer to rebuild, increasing the probability of failure.   http://m.slashdot.org/story/108941"
DataHoarder,38t0un,fryfrog,2,Sat Jun 6 21:33:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, sorry I'm going to have to go with /u/evemanufacturetool. My pool does a weekly scrub which reads all the existing data. Has been doing it for more than a year. No problems found.  I agree with you about using raidz2 / raid6, but not because disks over 1T have a greater chance of an unrecoverable read error."
DataHoarder,38t0un,evemanufacturetool,2,Sun Jun 7 23:34:02 2015 UTC,"So remind me how I can read many 10s of TBs of a disk and have no errors? How can disks last for 7 years+ and have no noticable problems? I totally disagree with the premise that you need dual parity beyond X disks/TB array size. If this were the case, there would be so much more real world data about it beyond one article that gets repeated ad nauseum."
DataHoarder,38t0un,mercenary_sysadmin,1 point,Sun Jun 7 10:48:02 2015 UTC,"Cascade failure.  Odds are very good that if one disk in an array fails, the others are going to be pretty near a similar failure point, which is then likely to be exacerbated by extreme load on the array during a rebuild.  This is not just a weird urban legend, it's happened to quite a lot of storage professionals (including me, on multiple occasions), and it's well known enough that even Dell is officially stating that RAID5 is no longer appropriate for any business use.   how I can read many 10s of TBs of a disk and have no errors?   You don't always know when there are errors.  Your drive is constantly getting errors but catching them due to the weak ECC checksumming built into the drive, and either correcting them or simply re-reading the block over and over and over again until it gets something it can correct.  The point is, if you get a URE during a rebuild and you don't have more parity / redundancy available, it's game over.  You don't want that.  Don't be a piker, single-parity striped vdevs aren't enough."

ZFS uses space more efficiently when the amount of non-parity disks is a power of 2 (in this case, if you put in a 6th disk, minus the 2 parity disks with Z2, you get 4=22). You'd also get 8TB of net space instead of 6TB. If you can't, no biggie.  Good job on the M1015 and IT mode, and the ECC RAM. I forget the exact setting, but ESXi lets you ""reserve"" the RAM instead of just allocate it, which means it will always get 8GB even if you over-allocate the RAM with other VMs running.  I use PCI passthrough for a controller on ESXi and all is well."
DataHoarder,38t0un,dirtsunshine,5,Sat Jun 6 21:23:07 2015 UTC,"Power of two non-parity disk count is more or less a myth:   Due to compression, the physical (allocated) block sizes are not powers of two, they are odd sizes like 3.5KB or 6KB. This means that we can not rely on any exact fit of (compressed) block size to the RAID-Z group width."

I have a 48TB that's built for speed that hits 800MB/s writes. I'm sure I could tune it for more.    Is it hard to have redundancy and speed without crazy cost?      Define crazy costs and what kind of speed.  For most people that are connected via Gigabit, you don't need to go much beyond that because your bottleneck is Gigabit.  Redundancy is basically additional slot and drive cost. If you can keep your slot cost down, it's now down to drive cost.    For brand new builds I target about $80/slot. Used builds I can get as low as $10. (These are based off 24 slots, adjust slightly upwards for less)    What are good alternatives (build my own linux based?)     I always recommend this route. Prebuilt NASes are convenient but they come at some sort of price. Either actual price (eg expensive), speeds, slot count, expandability, etc. I have no such limitations in Linux.

DataHoarder,38p69p,Winterspark,2,Fri Jun 5 20:12:48 2015 UTC,"Hard to say at the moment since I'm actually in the middle of organizing things. Several thousand at the least, but surprisingly the bulk of my OTR stuff takes up less than 200 gigs.  I download a lot of full archives from the OTRR group so I have a lot of mostly complete sets for the obvious stuff (like Johnny Dollar or Richard Diamond).   I haven't been collecting for too long, so I'm really hoping to expand more. Don't know much about Caltex at all and all I could find with a quick search was 7 episodes or so. Might be a fun program to search and collect for!  Edit: I just looked at OTRR's database for Caltex, and they don't even have episode numbers and dates, but theres a few listed on there. These are likely the only recordings that ever survived. You can take a look at the database here."

Comics, anime, pictures, music, music videos, a very small collection of e-books and fanfiction, though I expect that to grow over time. I do my best to get everything at the highest quality possible.  Probably the biggest portion of my collection, in both file size and file count, would be images. I estimate I have somewhere in the range of 400,000 - 500,000 images in my collection, though it is possible that number is higher. So far it is unmanaged because I have yet to find a piece of software that can manage it in a way that works for the particulars of my collection. Eventually I plan to learn how to program so I can create my own management software.  As for what fuels me... well, it's obsession and fear. I have an obsession with saving things that interest me and a fear of them disappearing forever, something that has happened several times before. By saving what I enjoy, I make sure I can always find it again, regardless of what happens to it out on the web. Likely not the healthiest mindset, but unless it starts causing me problems in the real world, I'm only mildly concerned about it."

Sometimes I find out about new shows/movies on reddit, from coworkers, friends, family, advertisements, etc. If it looks interesting, I'll grab it. If it doesn't look interesting, or the pilot episode sucks, I usually won't pursue it. Since I switched to Linux, I no longer collect software, and because of the internet/forums/reddit, I usually don't bother with technical ebooks (the only ones I'd bother to archive). I only save my pictures and have no desire to download other albums.  Quality depends... movies I usually get 1080p with 5.1 (sometimes it's annoying how difficult it can be to find a decent sized 1080p rip with 5.1), but tv shows vary based on the show. Most comedy shows I'm fine with 480p, but action shows are more likely to be 720p with 5.1, if available.  I used to be big into collecting music, but have since subscribed to Google Play Music's All Access Pass, since it's just so much easier than other methods out there.  Movies and tv shows are sorted and named using filebot/therenamer onto various drives (currently, 1x4TB for movies, 1x4TB for ongoing tv shows, and 1x6TB for completed shows) on my computer and everything is indexed by xbmc and I stream stuff using yatse.

There's a reason why Seagate gets the hate it does, its because guys like me and others deal with their lack of quality over and over and it gets to you.  Everyone has their perfered brands. But with HDDs its WD for me, and SSDs its Samsung and Intel. I just had a co-worker buy a Crucial SSD to upgrade his gaming computer 2 months ago, after I advised him what brand to buy he bought it because it was $20 cheaper. Like clockwork it installed, worked great for 3 days then promptly died, yes its under warranty but that's not the point.  So that's why we basically advertise for the brands that haven't failed us so. If you show me a Seagate HDD with 40-50k on-time hours on its smart data I'm genuinely impressed. But my WD drives have that and it's just expected for me.  Please note that at this point its still not a blind bias for me, I interact with all types of drives and im willing to change as the quality does. WD's Black hybrid drives for example are totally underwhelming like most other hybrid drives and I don't recommend them to anyone."

They were 3TB WD Greens and I've never touched a drive so hot. I cannot exaggerate enough how hot these metal disk were. I could not touch them for a few seconds at a time until they cooled down after a few minutes. Using that drive system as a full time NAS seems like a bad idea.

I'm also replacing our Ghost server with CrucibleWds because it's got a plug-in on freenas.

Looks like their main issues with Samsung were related to the EVO 840 (which was never designed for enterprise use) and they seem happy with the PRO 850 series.   Keep in mind we're only a couple of generations in. Already we see these manufactures maturing their software and getting rid of typical issues that new hardware has (drivers, drivers, drivers..).   What I took out of the article the most was that a lot of raid controllers really don't play nice with SSD yet. Also something that drivers and new firmware should fix over time. :)  I've got 6 850s, a bunch of olders 840s and some Kingston and Intel drivers in use and all of them have been running pretty well, nothing to complain about for me although Samsung could've been a bit faster fixing their EVO 840 issues.   One thing that is giving me problems is NVME based SSDs - device support for that, especially on Linux based OS's, seems very immature thus far. I'm using the Intel 750 as a boot drive in my workstation and just can't get Debian installed besides my Windows installation. Some other distro's don't even detect the NVME drive.   Very cool article btw. Here's some more into etsy.com's infrastructure; https://codeascraft.com/2012/08/31/what-hardware-powers-etsy-com/"
DataHoarder,38evir,GimmeSomeSugar,6,Wed Jun 3 23:44:34 2015 UTC,"The way I've read it, part of the problem was also that 'enterprise' SSDs are designed to offer an advantage many normal people would never be able to exploit. E.g., a consumer SSD will maintain performance levels over time partly by doing regular garbage collection scheduled by the controller, which it can do because it doesn't need to maintain performance under sustained load (and by sustained load, we're talking 30+ minutes). An enterprise drive can maintain high performance under sustained load partly because they are designed with much more aggressive over-provisioning (PDF warning). So, in your typical /r/datahoarder scenario good consumer SSDs will probably be just fine. Even in many enterprise environments, good consumer SSDs will be just fine. But once you're getting up in to Etsy's scale, consumer SSDs might be a bad choice."

CPU: needs to have ECC Support and enough power for transcoding, anything starting with an current generation i3 that hast ECC support will do the job.   MB: go for something that has all the features you need (in terms of Sata Ports, PCIe slots, Ram slots) Any brand can work, but if you want really good stability and more server grade stuff, then looking into Supermicro boards is a good idea.   In regards of low power consumption any Intel CPU is fine, to do some optimization you can deactivate not used components on your board (like integrated audio). Also the PSU is a big factor, the higher the 80+ rating, the better it performs. Also don't oversize it too much, since that will also raise power consumption.   In regards of aesthetics there is nothing much to say, if you like the R5 then go for it, if noth use some other case you like, as long as your hardware fits in it, it's fine.   On the software side, freenas will do the job with relatively easy setup, but to be honest, pretty much every OS should be able to do mac compatible network shares, same for streaming/transcoding.

Theres a question I always have, can't I have the system on one of the WD Reds? I see many guides that have it on USB sticks and it seems like an extra.   For redundancy, I was thinking RAID 1.

If you don't want to go with USB stick, take a look at SSDs. Small (60GB) ones are really cheap - cheaper than HDDs.  Mirrors are a good choice, if you don't mind the waste of space. Go with it."

FreeNAS devs have done a non-stop awesome job with their releases. The way they handle updates now is fucking awesome, and very streamlined too.  For example, when I did my last major version upgrade, they had added support for ZFS for the OS drive/partition. Previously it was UFS. I thought, that's neat, too bad I already installed. Little did I know, they were going to convert my OS drive to ZFS on my behalf. So I found out after the fact, but it converted flawlessly and only took a few reboots and a very short outage window.  The way they handle updates now is you can query within the webgui for updates, and that includes small updates and major version updates. Plus you can switch which stream of updates you get too.  Furthermore they've actually implemented a feature I wanted them to (for SAMBA) which was crucial for corporate use.  I haven't kept up with NAS4Free comparatively, but they never felt like a really great NAS distro. Not horrible, but I felt FreeNAS was better."

I was going to use an older computer but I didn't think the 4GB DDR2 will be sufficient (?). I was looking for an inexpensive ITX board (not sure which yet), 4GB DDR3 and 4x1TB WD's (which I already have), but trying to leave myself room for expansion. I should really stop being wishy-washy and just build something, but I'm still learning. I have a ton of parts but I'm also building some homelab components (server, pfSense router/firewall, etc.) so I've been trying to figure out the best configuration over 4 machines without spending too much money."
DataHoarder,38e6fz,jandefris,1 point,Thu Jun 4 02:57:41 2015 UTC,"I would go with an mATX board instead of an ITX ones. Typically ITX ones actually cost more, and you can sacrifice room for PCIe expansion later.  The problem with DDR2 is that it's very slow now adays. And, while there are people who believe very strongly that ECC isn't necessary for ZFS, it is a really good idea. Furthermore ECC is more affordable than ever.  If you want a hypervisor recommendation, check out Proxmox VE.  Also, if you want a processor recommendation for a hypervisor host, check out the AMD FX-8320.  Which WD drives?"
DataHoarder,38e6fz,Dr_Oops,1 point,Thu Jun 4 03:52:25 2015 UTC,"mATX sounds good too. I guess I didn't necessarily mean ""ITX"" just 'smaller form factor'. Yeah, I kinda scrapped the DDR2 as far as a NAS. I've come to the conclusion that it's gonna have to cost a little more than I had originally thought.   How do I know if a consumer board accepts ECC? Usually the documentation doesn't state that it does (at least, that I've seen).  I've never used proxmox, mostly I'm familar with ESXi. I thought that it was recommended to make a NAS standalone, not virtualized? What are your thoughts? If it's all the same, should I just build a NAS within my current desktop and use something like VMware Player running NAS4Free to control it?  That proc looks good. With 8-cores though, wouldn't it kinda be overkill? I was under the assumption that NAS builds didn't require much CPU overhead.   The drives I have are WD blue 1TB (x4).  Thanks for your help!"
DataHoarder,38e6fz,HerpertDerpington,1 point,Fri Jun 5 03:07:33 2015 UTC,"4gigs is probably okay for you, but depending on how much you use it, your ARC hit% may be kinda low.  Before I get into the ARC hit% I want to say, Darkstryke is right, 1GB per TB is a fallacy (unless you're looking into dedup, then it gets complicated). That being said, you will benefit from more RAM generally, but one of the reliable ways I've found to gauge that is through evaluating your ARC hit%.  First, the ARC hit% is the percentage of requests incoming for reads that are satisfied by what's already in your ARC. So if 80% or more of your read requests are already in the ARC (the RAM caching) it's going to read from RAM instead of disk, and this should be fairly self-evident as to how this can help reduce your disk wear.  Second, how can you tell your ARC hit%. Well, this depends on the tools available to you. On NAS4Free, I don't know what tools are available. But, it may have a gui element under reporting, so look there. Also, there is a common script ""arc(UNDERSCORE)summary.py"" which can be used to get a lot of information about your ARC, and one of those is info about your ARC hit%.  So for example, my first home pool is 4x2TB in Z1, and there's another pool of 4x240GB SSDs on the same system, so just about 5.6TB of usable space (after formatting of course) spinning and ~440GB of usable SSD space. I have 16GB of wired RAM (that's the physical amount). My ARC size right now is 11.12GB, and I have a max possible ARC size of 14.22GB (but it normally doesn't go that high, even under heavy load). My ARC hit% is 92.29%. That ARC serves all my zpools (incl the OS zpool).  So that means that right now, I don't need more RAM, and I have headroom to go before I really need RAM. Not only that, I'm very demanding on my pool, there's multiple VMs running fairly steadily against it.  So, it's likely your 4GB may be enough for you, but this can help you ascertain if it is. It's also worth noting RAM is very affordable, including ECC ;)"

I agree with others that the community roots of Nas4Free are more appealing to me.  If file share is all you care about, you'll be great where you are.   You can always look for another ""project"" box to serve the services you need/desire: There's always an excuse for spending more time fiddling with new systems ;)"

FreeNAS is kinda of an all in one deal with flashy looks and plugins, but does recommend using enterprise grade hardware. As of version 9.3 FreeNAS dropped support for all file systems other than ZFS. If you are using an old computer I would highly encourage NAS4Free as I think they still encourage the re-use of old desktop hardware. My parents NAS, which I built in high school runs FreeNAS verysion 7 and it chugs along on an old Athlon XP processor and 2GB of RAM. I can't vouch for any other NAS oriented software  as I have only used FreeNas. Both have their Pros and Cons, so do a little more research. Also, both work extremely well with Intel Nics."

It isn't caused by the processor having to do too much work as far as I can tell either, seeing as the issue persists whether I'm using 10% or 100% CPU.

Most routers/switches will fall back to a lower speed if there is a problem.  I was noticing that every couple days, one of the ports on my switch would drop down from gigE to 100mbps.  Turned out to be a dodgy ethernet cable.  I suspect you're having a problem that is causing your connection to drop all the way down to 10mbps.  Most routers/switches will indicate the connection speed by changing the color of the link LED.  Check to see what your computer and server are connecting at."

Your motherboard may have built in RAID options depending on what you are using. You could also add an a 3rd party storage controller to handle RAID, but that's an extra expense.   I'd use RAID1 for now - Seeing as you'll only have two internal 5TB drives anyway, your options are RAID0 or RAID1. In the future you could use RAID6 or some ZFS setup as your storage needs increase.   I'm a fan of Western Digital drives - They seem reliable, reasonably affordable and perform decently. I'm not sure if they make a 5TB or if it's just 4TB and 6TB.   Up to you what you do with the two 1TB drives - Personally I'd use them for archiving old data or taking backups of other machines.

DataHoarder,38czfg,stormcomponents,3,Wed Jun 3 12:34:04 2015 UTC,"Based on your description, a 650GB SSD storage array would be fun to configure, but largely inefficient in practice. If you had described ""Rendering large video edits in realtime"" then maybe it would be worth it, but for game servers and lan gaming, even the 15K SAS disks are flat out overkill for what you are describing.   Take the SSD's and use them as boot drives for your PC's, keep the SAS in the G6 and you will still be faster than 90% of the average home storage array.   When ""storage capacity"" (GB) isn't the problem, then the other qualifying metric is IOPs (Input/Output per second). If the G6 has eight drive bays (I can't remember) and you used standard 7200 sata disks, thats about 600 iops (8x75iops) aggregated up. The 15K SAS disks are about 1200 iops (8x150iops), so double the speed. If your storage demands are >1200iops (thats 1200 reads/writes per second, I doubt it from your description) then SSD is the way to go, if not, SSD is probably not going to make much of a difference. Even when you consider RAID overhead for IOPs, it still doesn't make sense.   Depending on how you've configured the storage you could use a single SSD as a cache drive for your disk array. Example: if you use an OS capable of ZFS and configure the disks with ZFS rather than hardware (the P410 card) then you could configure one SSD disk to act as an array cache drive. I don't think the P410 can configure this for a hardware raid, but I haven't used a P410 in a while, so I could be wrong. Might be worth looking into."

DataHoarder,386aiu,Dark-tyranitar,2,Tue Jun 2 19:39:39 2015 UTC,"There's actually a reason for it! The Seagate 8TB uses a technology called Shingled Magnetic Recording (SMR) which overlaps adjacent bits in order to store more stuff in a smaller space. This technology creates higher disk density with a small increase in price but with disadvantages.  There's very complicated explanations of this, but long story short SMR drives are best at archival stuff where you write once and read many times. Multiple writes, re-writes and deletions create unpredictable performance, sometimes slowing write speed down to <10MB/s, since it needs to work out how to delete the file without destroying the overlapping bits.  Of course, you're using it for its intended purpose which is perfect."

(You can google about this yourself, this seems well known)  With your own third party enclosure you won't have this problem.  Be careful some older enclosure will only support up to 3TB. You want to find those specifically says they support 4TB (which will support 4TB+).  Also I would suggest NAS drives (e.g. WD reds) since the ""green"" drives often power down and has to spin up and make you wait for half a minute everytime you try to access them which is super annoying (speaking from experience)."

I went with a WD external drive because it's a guaranteed WD drive inside; Hitachi/HGST enclosures are generally more expensive and Seagate/Samsung enclosures generally use cheaper Seagate drives and I don't really trust Seagate drives as much.  Enclosure has no fan but it has a decent amount of empty space inside for convection cooling.  I opened it up to find a WD Green; people who bought it have reported either Red or Green so it's luck of the draw (guess I fell short on that one). The drive is also mounted in the enclosure via rubber bumpers to minimize vibration noise.  Can't comment on reliability, it's worked perfectly for all 20ish days I've had it lol.  Value-wise: I got the Elements 5TB for about $40 less than the bare WD Green would cost. The Elements enclosure can be opened and put back together (it takes a bit of prying but it's not impossible, took me <10min with a Youtube video). Of course the Elements comes with a 1 year warranty and the bare hard drive comes with a 3 year warranty, but most hard drives either fail before 6 months or after 3 years anyway."

I'm not unhappy with unraid, I just feel that for me and my usage, flexraid-T will be better enough to justify the cost and hassle of migrating.   Multiple parity disks.  This has been ""coming soon"" to unraid for years, but still isn't available.  With 10-going-on-11 data disks, I'm past the point where double parity is Strongly Recommended. Runs on windows.  I'm far more comfortable with windows than a linux command line through SSH.  I can do (and have done) a bunch of manual configuration on unraid, and I'd just prefer an easier environment that I'm more familiar with. Search speed.  Even with the unlimited directory cache hack, unraid is slow to return directory contents and search results.  Windows indexing is much faster and more reliable. Less picky about hardware.  Windows has drivers for everything - unraid doesn't.  It isn't a huge hassle to have to check every potential hardware purchase for compatibility, but it is a nuisance. Better network share configuration.  There are still some issues with permissions sharing from a linux server to a windows client.  Going windows-to-windows just works better.  Windows also allows more granular access control than unraid, though I probably won't actually use many of the additional features."

Excuse my ignorance but isn't Unraid like FlexRAID in that you can pull a drive and have your data on that drive? I didn't think Unraid striped data, if this is the case you can simply just setup FlexRAID with your drives and calculate parity and you'll be fine, otherwise moving one by one looks like the way.  Be aware also that for large arrays FlexRAID does not give good preformance, I currently have a 50TB array with Traid consisting of 2x 4TB PPUs and my speed can be anywhere from 15MBps to 70MBps dependant on which disk it's using/how much of that disk is used ect."

Can you ""create"" an array out of already-full disks?  In other words, can I fill the disks first, then add them to the array and have it calculate parity later, or do the drives have to be added blank?   isn't Unraid like FlexRAID in that you can pull a drive and have your data on that drive?   Yes, though flexraid uses whatever file system you format the drive in, while unraid uses reiserFS.  I should be able to read the unraid drives directly with a reiserFS utility, but part of my question was whether or not this was a good idea.  I'm wondering if there are any gotchas that I don't know about.   FlexRAID does not give good preformance   It should be native single-drive speed for reads, and for writes if you have a landing disk.  That's the same as unraid."
DataHoarder,384lqe,clairaoswald,1 point,Tue Jun 2 12:42:08 2015 UTC,"Yes. You can have disks that are completely full, add them to the array, (Flexraid will ask what to do with the disk if adding to an existing array, you can select leave data, if creating a new array it won't ask but your data will be fine) start the array and upon starting for the first time Flexraid will give you options to  A) Create parity with the existing data, this will be what you want to do.  B)Verify parity, this is if you destoryed the array and have recreated it and already have a parity drive that just needs syncing.  C) Do nothing. The array will start without initaly creating parity information.  Reads are fine yes, as it just reads from the disk that the data lives on but writing is a pain when you have a lot of disks, if you're adding a write cache (landing disk as you correctly called it in the FlexRAID world) then you should be golden."

It's hyped and a lot of people say it's stable but I've seen everything else than a stable file system:    You need a modern kernel (at least 4.0 at this point see: https://btrfs.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Gotchas - I've at least ran into deadlock issues with LZO and some other issues with undeletable files in 3.18.  At the moment we run Linux 4.0.4 and even there is a filesystem corruption issue that is triggered by heavy io and remounts the filesystem read-only... read the btrfs mailing list and you'll don't want it to touch it with a ten-foot pole for performance and reliable storage (yet).  RAID1 should be fine through.. however the code for actually reporting a faulty drive is not there if you look here (this list is pure gold in a sad way, considering the hype): https://btrfs.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Project_ideas#Take_device_with_heavy_IO_errors_offline_or_mark_as_.22unreliable.22  ZFS on Linux won't fuck up your data but it's not as rock stable as you might think... I've seen deadlocks when doing heavy io and it's memory hungry.. it's fast and working for the most part through... especially RAIDZ2 is worth it's salt while btrfs RAID6 at this point is something to avoid! Look here for scary recent bugs: http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.file-systems.btrfs/45424"

DataHoarder,37zmbg,gehtmalraus,5,Mon Jun 1 01:49:00 2015 UTC,Sure it will. I've had it kill a 80TB array. Shit happens. Have backups.   Shit. My condolences. Want to tell the story? I'm working at the university with large Hadoop clusters and some have really fucked up disks that ZFS in JBOD just deals fine with... Hadoop does take care about replication through... when ZFS gave up the disks was either dead or really in the process of dying. Everything worked fine until that point... can't tell the same about btrfs it's going basically remount-readonly on the first disk errors due to the less robust design.. however my particular use-case is kind of exotic and nothing to recommend for sane minds.

DataHoarder,37zmbg,demosthenz,1 point,Mon Jun 1 08:48:05 2015 UTC,"Yep! My main reason for btrfs is pooling those 5 mismatched drives in a RAID 1.

DataHoarder,37zmbg,gehtmalraus,1 point,Mon Jun 1 03:40:04 2015 UTC,"Check out Snapraid for this purpose. It's not online parity, it requires syncing at interval to update the parity disk(s). So not ideal if you data is constantly changing, but perfect for media storage arrays."
DataHoarder,37zmbg,sundsta,1 point,Mon Jun 1 08:01:17 2015 UTC,No. ZFS can't do it - it's likely possible that you hack something together using Ceph or another clustered filesystem that supports parity. In that case you'll just use JBOD and hope that Cepth does the parity for you. However this is likely the road to madness and much more hairy than dealing with btrfs that is getting better.  So it should work that way... time is also on our side as it seems that btrfs get's better with every new kernel release.

Long story short, a disk corrupted while copying files and took out the imbed... after the BIOS on the mobo had corrupted (which I did not know until I attempted to reboot the computer).    Despite the fact that I was running embedded linux in 2005 for a 4-drive IDE RAID5 ZFS cluster, I am not good with computer.

When everything works as expected, any RAID implementation will do just fine, but introduce a crappy PSU and components might start to fail in unpredictable ways. HDD also doesn't always fail as it should. SSDs fail in strange ways as well. And when that happens it might be down to individual lines of code and how it will handle these unexpected situations. Code is a code, no matter if in kernel or on a card. (although cheap controller will lockup easilly with one failing drive..)  Everything fails and when it does, I was usually able to get bit more information from SW raid (where I could talk to the drives directly, read the data raw, etc..) hence why I prefer SW.

However as the drives are different and their firmware is not optimized for RAID I would recommend that you don't use use them in anything different than JBOD as the array won't be as stable. If you want to use RAID you will have to think about getting NAS optimized HDDs such as the WD Red drives. And of course I would recommend that you always have at least two copies of the data in at least two different locations – one on the drives in the NAS and another one on a different PC or external HDD. This will ensure that even if there is corruption of the data on the NAS drives you data will be safe. Good luck."

So in my opinion you should try to get duplicati/duplicity working, thats your best option.  I don't know how you guys here at /datahoarder deal with aplications, but sometimes i just create a VM and run things inside it. That way i don't leave my main system a mess when things dont work. Ive run Duplicati in Debian 8/W7 with no problems, that's one option.   In Linux for OneDrive authentication i had to change some SSL stuff. https://forums.freenas.org/index.php?threads/guide-install-duplicati-2-in-a-jail-in-freenas-9-3.28233/"

Well, I can run single core 32-bit VMs in VirtualBox, which would be fine for just raw uploads, but I don't see that working very well for running encryption. I suppose it's worth a try!  Edit: I don't have a NAS yet, I'm just running this on my main Fedora 21 Workstation backing up my main external hard drive. /u/buchno pointed out some dependencies I missed that I needed to satisfy to make it work."

DataHoarder,37wnch,TheUbuntuGuy,1 point,Sun May 31 13:31:59 2015 UTC,Backup your data and get a drive that has a decent warranty.  At least 3 years nowadays imo.  I don't manage a fleet of drives but my WD drives seem to last forever.  My 74GB raptor is still running 11 years later and the rest of my old drives were all retired without failure.  I just got bigger drives and put the old ones in the closet.

DataHoarder,37wnch,Shririnovski,4,Sun May 31 16:05:56 2015 UTC,"I don't take other people's experiences from this sub into account. Like I said it is my experience.

DataHoarder,37q03t,Reckless5040,2,Sun May 31 08:47:58 2015 UTC,"Depending on where you put it it is totally tolerable. I have it in a most enclosed rack in my garage though so....  If you're putting this in a room where you will be all the time, it may be a bit much."
DataHoarder,37q03t,theanswriz42,2,Sun May 31 13:35:29 2015 UTC,"Ah, no I have it in the next room over where no one ever is."
DataHoarder,37q03t,theanswriz42,3,Sun May 31 18:20:40 2015 UTC,"Wow, is that a 2950?"
DataHoarder,37q03t,jibjibjib,3,Fri May 29 15:30:41 2015 UTC,"Yep, 2950 in the rack, supermicro 826 on top getting ready to go in."
DataHoarder,37q03t,StrangeWill,9,Fri May 29 15:41:31 2015 UTC,"Well, at least you won't need to buy a space heater for your area.   Btw, which rack is that? I've been looking for one for my setup."
DataHoarder,37q03t,erktheerk,3,Fri May 29 16:54:46 2015 UTC,"Its a half rack that I found on Craigslist for $40.  It had threaded holes so I found another full rack for $40 that had square holes and i cut the rails down to size for this one, since it has a front door."
DataHoarder,37q03t,bencmeyer,3,Fri May 29 19:50:49 2015 UTC,That looks like a LackRack to me.  https://wiki.eth0.nl/index.php/LackRack

DataHoarder,37sezx,we2loo,3,Sat May 30 00:35:58 2015 UTC,"If you don't use Linux and don't care if you have to connect your external drives every 30 days, feel free to switch.  The speed does indeed suck."
DataHoarder,37sezx,buchno,3,Sat May 30 00:45:57 2015 UTC,I guess I wont mind connecting the hard drives. I have 5TB to upload and it's gonna take ages with crashplan.   What about security? Crashplan uses bowfish or something while backblaze is 128bit AES. I used a custom passphrase too but I'm wondering if their security is equivalent.
DataHoarder,37sezx,buchno,3,Sat May 30 00:50:23 2015 UTC,"Both Crashplan's and Backblaze's applications are proprietary, treat what you back up as if they have read access to it.  But to answer your question, 128bit AES has not been broken yet."
DataHoarder,37sezx,DennisVanWelker,3,Sat May 30 01:03:46 2015 UTC,Try SOS Online Backup - Same price and similar to Crashplan. I've been getting 60-70mbps up.
DataHoarder,37sezx,kuzimoto,2,Sat May 30 01:46:12 2015 UTC,The main problem I have with Backblaze on my Mac is that it tends to consume huge amounts of RAM.
DataHoarder,37sezx,joey3002,2,Sat May 30 01:54:05 2015 UTC,"Been using Backblaze for half a year or so. Its pretty fast for me, you can select how many threads you want to dedicate to uploading. I have it set to two and its uploading at about 6mbps, when set to 10 it maxes my connection at 23 Mbps."
DataHoarder,37sezx,kuzimoto,0,Mon Jun 1 00:33:00 2015 UTC,How is backblaze encryption-wise?  Can I protect my files from anyone seeing them with personal access key?
DataHoarder,37sezx,joey3002,2,Mon Jun 1 00:58:04 2015 UTC,I believe you can actually provide your own key if you like. But if you loose it your data is lost forever haha. I think the security is comparable to crashplan in general.
DataHoarder,37sezx,drashna,0,Mon Jun 1 01:45:39 2015 UTC,"Thanks, that is one key I am willing to put in safe deposit box."
DataHoarder,37sezx,zackiv31,1 point,Mon Jun 1 16:58:11 2015 UTC,"I've heard horror stories of CrashPlan data not being recoverable.... so I'd stay away from it.  But then again, check out StableBit CloudDrive (Windows, beta)."

DataHoarder,37ntvv,beenpimpinsince,6,Fri May 29 01:32:53 2015 UTC,"Not only is it full of SSD goodness, it's a Blade Server. Each of those 4 M630 blades is a few thousand dollars (minimum 2k with no options per blade). Looks like a PowerEdge VRTX chassis. Those cost ""call for pricing"", aka if you have to ask you can't afford it, but I see one estimate of just the VRTX chassis at $30k without any drives or blades. Those Dell 800GB SAS SSD cartridges are a bit over 2k each, and there's 12 of them. So you're talking a minimum of over $60k just from what you can see in the image, with no other options added, and I have a feeling there are a lot of options added to justify the rest of it :)"
DataHoarder,37ntvv,contrarian_barbarian,6,Fri May 29 13:43:18 2015 UTC,"I would also like to know, even if it's just an approximation. Building storage proposition for +-10TB and that might just be what I need."

DataHoarder,37ntvv,MystikIncarnate,3,Fri May 29 23:14:10 2015 UTC,"Thank you for clarifying for him, I knew his purchasing power was lurking the thread too. :)"
DataHoarder,37ntvv,BaCoN_BaD,9,Sat May 30 00:09:34 2015 UTC,I really want to love these things. They just seem like a perfect middle step between individual servers and a full blade solution like the M1000e.  Except you can't interchange the blades from the VRTX and the M1000e.... at least not without a firmware rewrite.
DataHoarder,37ntvv,BaCoN_BaD,5,Fri May 29 02:23:53 2015 UTC,"Yea, for my use case, this made the most sense, and the price was right."

DataHoarder,37ntvv,Rwhiteside90,5,Fri May 29 09:20:30 2015 UTC,"VDI on a VRTX, ay?  Only drag is that Dell has no PERC8 driver for ESXi yet.  Do you have redundant controllers?  Have you updated your firmware yet?"
DataHoarder,37ntvv,Rwhiteside90,2,Fri May 29 04:30:48 2015 UTC,Haven't been able to power it on yet.  I'm hoping dell releases a compatible ESXi 6 ISO next month.
DataHoarder,37ntvv,encaseme,2,Fri May 29 16:47:41 2015 UTC,"They say June 2015... I really hope so too it's holding up a similar VRTX deployment.  You should check your firmware though - if you have a secondary controller they can't use write-back cache without the latest firmware, which means everything is write-through and horribly slow.  If you only got one controller (no failover) then you're fine."
DataHoarder,37ntvv,ForceBlade,2,Fri May 29 17:19:53 2015 UTC,"Don't feel bad, HP or IBM hasn't either.  I'm itching myself to test run it, but I may just run it on a whitebox to poke around."
DataHoarder,37ntvv,yParticle,2,Fri May 29 17:54:19 2015 UTC,What do you mean? HP had an ESXi ISO out pretty soon after VMWare released ESXi 6
DataHoarder,37ntvv,ForceBlade,2,Sat May 30 00:13:17 2015 UTC,"Can you link me then?  I haven't found it yet, may just be because they can't hire competent web devs.  It's quite difficult to find anything."

DataHoarder,37rsxe,block_talk,2,Fri May 29 21:38:34 2015 UTC,What happens in case of a fire / burglary?
DataHoarder,37rsxe,railsornery,1 point,Sat May 30 06:20:21 2015 UTC,"For the truly important stuff I rotate two 2TB disks off site (one here, one there), swap space with a friend using Syncthing, and have an encrypted 64GB flash drive that I carry on my person for documents, scans, etc.  I don't have a full backup of the 12TB, which is why I'm using Snapraid.  It offers the redundancy of raid but the backup feature of recovering from file system or user errors.  Fire and theft are tough use cases but there would be more important things to worry about if that happened."
DataHoarder,37rsxe,railsornery,2,Sat May 30 07:01:46 2015 UTC,"Cool. Very reliable setup, which is why I was mostly worried about external factors. As you write yourself some of those drives will probably need replacing, but they world ain't perfect. You'll probably want to go with BB or CP or something similar to get an archive off-site of your whole array, just in case something bad does happen. I'd highly recommand it. I lost a media PC a few years ago (only 1TB or so, and mostly badly organised anyway) due to a lightning strike and the HDD was unrecoverable. :<   But yea, like I said, this looks alright. Might want to add another SSD for mirrored redundancy of your OS but that's it. As long as you're aware of the risks of not doing that."
DataHoarder,37rsxe,JenMog,3,Sat May 30 07:17:48 2015 UTC,"Mirroring the SSD is pretty useless (and expensive). It's most likely the most reliable thing in there. Besides, you should just make an complete ISO of it and move it to hard drive storage. Unless you really want the up time in case either one of them dies, which is very unlikely since something is probably going to break in the meantime.  Just my thoughts!"
DataHoarder,37rsxe,railsornery,1 point,Sat May 30 10:15:02 2015 UTC,"At least have a way to recover from SSD failure, yes. Appearently he's already ISOíng the drive, which is good, too. :) I personally run 2 SSDs in Raid1 because I don't want any downtime recovering. That's besides automated, off-site, full copies of the boot disk."

DataHoarder,37s40p,AlaskanBeard,2,Fri May 29 23:36:58 2015 UTC,"While Yify is great for the quality to file size ratio, the video and much more noticed audio quality suffers compared to a proper media file. The trade-off becomes file size. Also want to add deluge as an alternative to qBittorrent."
DataHoarder,37s40p,Roalith,1 point,Mon Jun 1 23:54:15 2015 UTC,"Thanks for this! Tons of new cataloging and download tools to look at. Under downloading, what are those things you reference like yify? And would you prefer to have one cataloging tool vs many? What is the benefit of having a separate cataloging tool for all yr media? Thanks for yr reply."
DataHoarder,37s40p,AlaskanBeard,3,Sat May 30 04:47:21 2015 UTC,"Sorry I didn't do a better write up. I was on mobile at the time.  I should preface this by saying that I use Usenet to do most of my downloading, and if need be, supplement with torrents.  Sonarr: Sonarr is a TV management software. You add TV shows into the GUI and it will pull information from TheTVDB, like seasons, episode names, air dates, artwork, just about anything you might need. Then you can add in a Usenet provider (shoutout to /r/unenet) and an indexer (they catalogue usenet uploads, similar to how PirateBay or KickassTorrents do torrents, I recommend DOGnzbd). This will allow for automatic downloads of most mainstream shows.  Couchpotato: Couchpotato is very similar to Sonarr, except it handles movies. There are a couple other features, but unless you delve down the rabbit hole, they're not worth mentioning.  Headphones: Same as the other two, except for music.  Calibre: Calibre isn't an automatic downloader, but it will grab you files (rename if you choose) and manage them, and their metadata. As well as any devices you might want to sync (Kindle, phone, android tablet, etc.)  ComicRack + ComicVine: ComicRack is a desktop comic reader and ComicVine is a plugin for ComicRack that allows for renaming and sorting of comics. There's another software I've used, Mylar, that allows for automatic downloading, but I didn't find it as polished for management as ComicRack.  SABnzbd: Just like you need a torrent client to download torrents, you need a Usenet client to download NZB files. SABnzbd is one of a couple main programs used, and my preferred one.  qBittorrent: For torrent handling, qBittorrent has all the features I need, a web UI for remote access, it's lightweight, and I believe open source.  Plex: Plex is probably the most flushed out media player I've used. They have apps for iOS, Android, Windows Phone, Xbox One, PS4, as well as a host of streaming boxes. They also support DNLA for smart TVs. You can access your media from the web console, or one of your apps from anywhere. This is all assuming you have a Plex Pass ($150 for lifetime, or $5 a month, I believe).  As for having separate programs for everything. No program I've tried does auto downloading as well as each one of these programs does by themselves. As for the cataloging side of it, there might be something better that manages everything, but if I have to have the downloaders already, why not use their management features?  I also failed to cover the rest of your questions in my first comment.  I don't personally run a true NAS since they're not very useful in my eyes. I run Windows Server 2012 on a cheap AMD build. Then I have DriveBender, a competitor software of DrivePool (/u/drashna mentioned it) to make Windows see one hard drive vs many. I have two drives like that, one for my media, and one for my backup. As for backing up itself, I just have a robocopy script that I run (usually via scheduled task, but since my backup pool is full at the moment, I run it manually).  I hope this cleared up some things in my original comment. Let me know if you have any other questions."
DataHoarder,37s40p,waywardspooky,2,Sat May 30 09:20:37 2015 UTC,an alternative to sonarr is sickrage
DataHoarder,37s40p,dxm765,3,Mon Jun 1 10:57:23 2015 UTC,"Hello! So i answer some of your questions hit and miss, i dont so much catalog stuff, i kinda just know where/what folder its in. For media i use plex such as movies, music,tv shows. As far as FreeNAS, pleaseeee goto there forums and read the reccomeneded hardware section thorughly, and if you STILL have interest this is one of my favorite builds i have seen (not my build, it was just well done). Just keep in mind FreeNAS works best (someones gonna argue with me im sure) on enterprise grade hardware, not desktop hardware with audio jacks, and fancy shit that you cant utilize; so yes its gonna cost you some dolla dolla bills. As far as tools? I use Dokuwiki for network notes, install notes/precedures, serial numbers, etc. Media players i have in the house are a few Roku's, my Plex server (see above), and 1 HTPC. backup utility i use VEEAM for my ESXi environment + crashplan pro unlimited cloud storage. Torrenting is done on my seedbox, and i just SFTP move shiz over.   What you did miss is a budget....budget is going to be VERY helpful to anyone else who comments, or wants to comment. I would also include a APC (Battery backup) as servers dont like having there power ripped out/turned off while running, and think long and hard about how much data you have NOW and how much you MAY have a year from now. I started with 8Tb 2 years ago, and i had to upgrade to my now 32Tb FreeNAS server....."

This gives me a starting point to understand the hardware and terminology involved. I didn't put a budget down because I honestly don't know what expect, what I am willing to skimp on vs splurge and all that. As I read replies I am want to start formulating a game plan. Start with assessing my current media storage, transfer to one drive, backup options, streaming options, cataloging, etc. Getting excited. Than you again. If I had to say a budget, I would ball park 1k...? That seems reasonable"
DataHoarder,37s40p,drashna,2,Sat May 30 04:51:33 2015 UTC,"Depending on how much storage you want/need, you could very well spend 1k in drives alone....Now if you dont want/need that much space 1K for server hardware shouldnt be asking too much, just be sure to include the proper equipment, browse the FreeNAS forums for what is known working, and then move on from there."

DataHoarder,37p59c,jamauai,7,Fri May 29 08:19:05 2015 UTC,It really depends how you are using the disks.   For example I have backup disks on NTFS that are basically write once. I write sequentially to them until they are pretty much completely full with less than 1GB free. The write speed is fine all the way till the end in my experience.

DataHoarder,37p59c,ardmax1,2,Fri May 29 11:53:00 2015 UTC,"Usually because of performance. It's been observed that most storage drives (of course there are exceptions) degrade in performance and capabilities after they pass around 10-5 % of their free capacity left.   Another reason would be that in the case of bad sectors and reallocation, the drive should have space where to reallocate the data from the bad sectors.   Are you experiencing performance issues? You have practically 1.6 % free space left on drives as large as 3TB so you should be experiencing lags and issues. So practically it isn't such a good idea.   CK_WD"

DataHoarder,37mcbc,Ripdog,2,Fri May 29 13:46:25 2015 UTC,Crashplan lets you adopt backups on new systems from old systems if the data is in the same place. In this case the data will be checked against the server rather than reuploaded.

It sounds like you have a source that provides storage and has set internal business rates that seem astronomical.  If we assume that we are able to get 50% billing utilization out of a system, we can model our costs.  You've asked for 'highest availability' which guides us to a dual controller storage device.  For sake of simplicity, lets just assume you are running a Dell Equallogic PS4100E with 12x3TB disks in RAID6 for a usable volume of 30TB and a price of roughly $15k + $2k/yr for mission critical support.  At 50% capacity, you can ""sell"" 15TB worth of storage.  The array has a 3 year lifecycle, so it costs $5k+$2k+$2k (infrastructure costs)/yr.  $9k/15TB = $600/TB/yr as a cost to operate your storage.  Tack on a 50% markup, and you are at $900/year per TB for RAID6 storage on SATA disks with a low IOPS allowance.  Extra charges based on throughput and IOPS measured against the array."

DataHoarder,37owek,canhazraid,1 point,Sat May 30 22:51:23 2015 UTC,"$10k/tb isn't unreasonable either -- for the right level of service.  I assume you are paying some corporate charge-back price.    If you are paying for backups, replication to a second data center, and a high IOPS storage system (10-15k rpm SAS/FC disks), especially on legacy storage with higher maintenance costs and lower storage volume it could easily be higher.  I think I paid $60k for a ~20tb EMC VNX 5xxx with something like 30 x 600gb 15k disks (two shelves) with fast cache and 10gb.  With RAID10 that is 10tb usable, and 5tb 'sellable' (using our 50% capacity metric).  Now we are at ~$24,000yr for 5tb is $4,800/yr cost including infrastructure.  If we keep backups of that data lets say those backups cost $500/tb/yr.  We have that data replicated to a second EMC array for another $4,800/yr.  Now we are at your $10k number.  There are potentially staff costs that are being rolled into the charge back cost.  You are paying a bunch of IT folks salaries to support this hardware."

Backup is part of the charge as I understand it, but its not broken down.

Anime is also something you might wanna hoard, as release groups come and go, and while some sources are easy to locate after a time, old torrents do go dead.

If a single disk fails, you can recover the data to a new one (or maybe even to the other disks in the system) and if more than one disks fail, you only lose the data on the failed disks.  It is a very interesting setup to me, but because it doesn't really fit w/ my use case or environment, I haven't tried it. But I totally would in yours.  There are versions of it for Windows and Linux."
DataHoarder,37mn5i,SupahNoob,2,Thu May 28 19:12:16 2015 UTC,"For someone entirely new to this I suggest you start with:  1) Pre-built NAS, or  2) A spare PC running storage spaces/drivepool/etc with file sharing  After using either for some time you'll either be happy with it, or feel it lacks performance or certain features.  Then you can plan an upgrade, this time knowing exactly what you need."
DataHoarder,37mn5i,Y0tsuya,1 point,Fri May 29 10:03:54 2015 UTC,"I would recommend a custom-built nas, as it can give you exactly what you want.    Do you have any idea how much storage (in terms of number of TiB) you need?  In terms of physical location, do you have a place set aside for it, or plan to make space for it?  Do you want something rackmount or floorstanding? Are you overly concerned with power consumption?   Do you have a budget?  Would you prefer working in windows or Linux?  I would personally recommend Linux, but only if you are either eager to learn.  Emphasis on eager, it can burn you out fast.  As far as a bang-for-buck system, I'd look at a custom-built device.  I built a 20TB (raw) nas for about $1300USD, but you can definitely build something for less.  I just chose to use server-grade hardware for everything short of the drives themselves.  If that's out of your price range, you could go with a TS140 and add drives.  From what I understand, the TS140 will fit 5 Hard drives and has 5 sata ports on the motherboard."
DataHoarder,37mn5i,teh_fearless_leader,1 point,Thu May 28 22:55:26 2015 UTC,"No idea on how much storage, but I do want at least 8TB with the ability to improve on that - either by expansion or swapping out drives for larger ones.  Physical location highly depends on the amount of noise the storage unit will be making. Ideally, I'd like to connect it directly to the router, as streaming 4K content is something I'm interested in in the future, and with being in an apartment complex, wire is infinitely better than wireless. That being said, since it will likely be in the living room, I'd like for it to be as discreet as possible, but the essential key is that it's quiet.  Power consumption shouldn't be a huge deal, as long as it's not a hog. I figure it won't be too much more than the media center, so it's not a huge deal if it costs an extra $10/month over more power-efficient options.  The price will determine how soon I can get it, so I don't really have a strict budget. $1300 USD seems a bit steep for storage, and I'm not too positive how I can justify that when the media center only costs ~$675 ... and that's having it be pretty overkill.  Again, I'm not opposed to learning Linux, and I have a good logic/code based pattern of thought... but I'm infinitely more comfortable on Windows. Since this is a device that will be on 24/7 and have 99% uptime, I'd assume Linux would be the much preferred option of the two.  Thanks for taking some time out to help me!"
DataHoarder,37mn5i,drashna,1 point,Fri May 29 01:13:33 2015 UTC,"$1300 seems about right, actually.  You can build the box for very cheap, but it's the drives that jump up the price drastically.  In fact, you could build a decent system for ~$600. And yes, that's assuming you go for a better CPU so you can transcode/stream to any/every device. Otherwise, you could get away with ~$300 if you do it right.   As for always on, Linux isn't a requirement.  Windows works fine for that, especially if you avoid cluttering it up with crap.  And if you do go with Windows, definitely check out StableBit DrivePool. It's a file based pooling solution, and it works very well.  Sites like We Got Served have some nice paid guides on how to set up Windows 8 as a simple server, as well.  As for hardware, check out these: Norco S4-ITX (though, i'd recommend IN WIN IW-MS04-01-S265 instead) ASRock E3C226D2I Intel Core i3-4130T   The CPU is a nice, low powered CPU.  I have a system using this and 2x8GB sticks of ECC. Under load (that's with 4xHDDs, actually), the power draw is around 90Ws, and it's very quiet.  And it supports IPMI OOBM (can control it from another computer, including getting into the BIOS)."

DataHoarder,37hn18,Dubhan,2,Thu May 28 01:05:57 2015 UTC,"File systems really have 2 different sides to them - the development/theoretical side (wouldn't it be nice if this FS had this feature, which is how ZFS came about) and the administration/practical side (which filesystem do I need to use in order to have the best performance/stability/cost, etc).  If you're doing data recovery you're going to want to know about both sides.  A good place to start is just Google.  Search for EXT4 and see what pops up.  Install Linux on your laptop, and when it asks which filesystem to use, go Google the pros/cons of each one offered.  Don't get too caught up in trying to figure out WHAT do learn, just dive in.  You'll never regret spending 2-3 days reading up on any topic."
DataHoarder,37hn18,TheOtherITdude,2,Thu May 28 01:16:17 2015 UTC,I'd add btrfs to that mix to get in ahead of the curve. I think long term it and zfs are the real contenders while ext's role diminishes.

The site TheGeekStuff has lots of Linux articles and also they cover filesystems once in a while in varying depth.  What are you specifically looking for info on?
DataHoarder,37hn18,OriginUnknown82,1 point,Wed May 27 23:48:50 2015 UTC,"That's great advice. I'll check those out. In the past 6 months I've been manually rebuild RAIDs by examining on disk data, chasing hex level parity, utilizing mdadm and iscsi to recover data, etc. I have dealt with lvm and dynamic partitions of all kinds, including manually rebuilding SANs from the drives alone, in linux. It's so fun! My main goal is to learn more about on disk formatting at a hex level and better understand how the data behaves. So, low level deep dives and file system data behavior is what I'm looking for, I suppose."
DataHoarder,37hy5e,jduke1,4,Wed May 27 19:41:21 2015 UTC,"The easiest route to more storage is to stuff disks into a system you have.  How much storage do you need now, how much do you think you need over the next two years and do you want an external enclosure? dedicated server?   How are you handling backups?  Off The Shelf Storage Server  Its easy to pickup a Synology (or QNAP, or brand x) self-contained ethernet storage system.  A Synology DS2105xs takes 8 disks.  A RS3614xs + RS1214 will do 24.  This is the most expensive option generally, but has the best fit and finish.  Dedicated Storage Server (Server that only acts as a server)  You can build a dedicated system to run as a network storage server with something like FreeNAS, or the varients.  This is the ZFS crew.  It is generally the most flexable and feature rich.  In before ""no ecc can't run FreeNAS it will take down the entire cloud""  Shared Storage Array (shared duty, like hung off a desktop)  You can easily put one disk, or 100 disks directly attached to a host bus adapter in your PC.

Most motherboards have an onboard host controller built into the chipset.  Your desktop should have 2 SATA3 and 4 SATA2 interfaces internally, allowing for 6 disks total without additional HBA's.  Your onboard controller won't allow for hardware RAID.  Windows is reasonable at software RAID1, and there are other options for non-realtime RAID.  6TB disks are the largest non-shingled disks available right now.   Two Western Digital Red 6TB disks in RAID1 would provide 6TB (6000GB) of usable space for $538 with redundancy.  You still need an approach to backup.  RAID isn't backup.  If you are ok with shingled disks, 8TB shingled is about the same price."

RAID1 is your basic ""write my data to both disks so they are a carbon copy"".  You don't need RAID as long as:   You have backups (local or cloud) You trust your backups You can restore in a timely fashion.   That doesnt mean RAID is a backup, it just protects from a component failure.  You still need to answer those three questions."

These seem to be the right ones, but I'm not sure http://www.ebay.com/itm/231137820002  Any thoughts regarding the power supply that comes with the chassis, or the chassis fans?  what other hardware am i missing to complete this?"
DataHoarder,37h380,railsornery,2,Sat May 30 04:47:25 2015 UTC,"Alright, lots of questions here.. I'll try and help you as much as I can.  First off all, raid cards / cables / how am i going to connect 24 HDDs? The case comes with a BPN-SAS-846EL1 SAS expender. You connect this to a so called 'Host Bus Adapter' (/raid card). The chassis uses iPass or mini SAS (SFF-8087). The ServeRAID M1015 also uses SFF-8087 so you should be fine with that. I think you'll only need one cable due to the SAS expander, but read up on this (lots of info on the webs). The cable you linked will do fine!  The OS Drive is a bit small, keep in mind that plex meta data gets out of control and can take up a LOT of space. I'm starting to get worried about my 128GB boot drive SSD just because of Plex :(  The Noctua cooler doesn't state its compatible with the socket 1155 platform. Make sure you can install it on the 1155 socket before buying it. Keep in mind you'll probably don't need an after-market cooler for this system.   Motherboard, processor and memory all look compatible and good.   So, that's the hardware side of things. One more thing: this chassis is a server chassis and as such it is LOUD. I've had them (for setting up / testing) in my living room and they are as loud as a freakin' vacuumcleaner.   As for the software: You'll have to format your drives to get Raidz2 setup I think. If this is not a problem then you should be okay using different drive sizes.   I'm using my server for almost the same thing as you and use a regular Linux installation (Debian, in my case) with snapRaid for redundancy. This way I'm a lot more flexible in mixing / matching drives and I didn't lose all my exising data (I had like 20TB of exisitng data I didn't want to lose)."

The performance difference when you have an SSD as a cache is amazing. To spare wear on the SSD boost the RAM and/or tell ZFS to use the SSD only for metadata.
DataHoarder,37e76h,JediCheese,2,Tue May 26 23:50:58 2015 UTC,"Can't you just put the Btrfs drives in the new desktop and then add your new drives to the pool?  Edit: Oh I suppose you could have boot files on those. One thing to note is that if you're moving drives from one system to another, you're going to either have wait for btrfs to rebalance as each drive is removed or mount it as a degraded pool with a missing drive. And on the recieving pool, you'll have to rebalance after each drive is added. Both of these will take a while.   If you have backups (As something can go wrong) one thing you could do is setup your 2x5TB as a RAID0 first with a 4 TB from the old setup (~14TB usable), and run the old setup as a degraded pool and be able to copy everything over in one go before readding all the drives and rebalancing the pool as a RAID5. During this you'll obviously lose files if there is any corruption at all, so you might want to run scrubs beforehand, and badblocks on the new drives to make sure they're working correctly.  You could get another drive (Borrow), and set that up with RAID0 before so you have enough space (10+whateverdrive) to copy everything from one pool to another. And then add a 4TB drive from the old setup (So it can still run degraded), which will hopefully give you enough space to convert to a RAID5 array to make sure you don't lose data (And if you do you have the old pool). And once it's converted to RAID5 add all your old drives and remove the temporary/borrowed drive.  I'm not saying you should buy a drive and use it for a bit before returning it, but you could."

The problem is without free space to move stuff around, the drives will take forever to balance the data and repair themselves.  More info: if people are wondering how I got here, I had a RAID 1 setup with the drives.  In kernel 3.19, they declared RAID 5 and 6 stable for use, so I upgraded my kernel with Ubuntu.  Then I rebalanced into a RAID 5 setup.  It says it completed successfully after ~8 days so I took it at it's word and started downloading again.  When I ran out of room unexpectedly (with 1 TB free on /dev/sdc), I noticed it hadn't successfully switched all the Metadata from RAID 1 and created an unknown part, both of which take up little space but are possible stability time bombs."

DataHoarder,37e76h,ThatOnePerson,0,Wed May 27 01:27:45 2015 UTC,"Regarding the transfer with BTRFS, I would mount the new 2x 5TB drives in RAID 1 or 5 (essentially the same at this point).  Transfer over ~3 TB of data and delete it on the desktop.  Remove a 3 TB drive from the desktop to new NAS.  Add the 3 TB to the new array and convert to RAID 5.  Balance both computers.   Move another 3 TB of data over, delete the data on desktop, remove a 3TB drive from the desktop and add to the NAS, balance.  Keep doing this until I'm out of data and drives to move over.  I also have a 1 TB external that I could use and a spare 1 TB on my ESXi server that could be used in a pinch to expand storage somewhere along the line.  The btrfs device remove command moves data off the device to be removed as part of the removal.  So it's reasonably safe to remove a drive while the data is elsewhere.  Also the btrfs device add command opens up the drive immediately.  It would be possible to move the data over while adding drives if space is available and then do one massive balance at the end to give RAID protection on the data."
DataHoarder,37e76h,ThatOnePerson,3,Wed May 27 01:28:20 2015 UTC,"I was thinking if you're impatient, you could just remove a drive from the desktop, and mount it as a degraded pool with a missing drive and you wouldn't have to wait for a rebalance.

Without a balance after each add though, won't you get that one drive will slowly fill up and you won't get the full space? Last time I added a drive, df would not show the correct space until after a balance, and it would slowly increase during the balance."
DataHoarder,37e76h,mercenary_sysadmin,2,Wed May 27 01:45:38 2015 UTC,"btrfs-raid5 is begging for dataloss.  ZFS on Linux RAIDZ2 with 6 WD Red drives and 8GB will work well.  Since you're more familiar with Linux, dodge FreeNAS and stick with what you're used to.  As long as you aren't asking the box to do much more than be a NAS, that 8GB should be just fine.  With that said... I question your topology choice.  2TB drives are pretty small by modern standards - are you really saving enough per drive to make that worthwhile?  6 of them in RAIDZ2 only gives you 8TB of storage for $600; you could get that with 4 4TB drives ($640) in a pool of mirrors and have more consistent performance, lower power use, less heat generated, and a much easier upgrade path in the future.  That's a pretty crappy way to save $40 IMO.  Also note that if you go the pool of mirrors route, you can set up your 4 new 4TB Reds as two mirror vdevs, migrate your existing data onto them, then wipe two of your 3TB drives and your two 4TB drives and add them as two more mirror vdevs in the same pool.  Assuming you have the chassis and power requirements to feed them all, of course."

I have space for 10 drives in the chassis and a new 500 watt name brand PSU that should do ok to power it all.  The real problem is the 6 SATA ports on the mobo and I don't own a HBA card for more ports.    I didn't think about mirrored 4 TB drives, but the size seem to be in a poor price to size zone right now.  Doubly true after the Fry's 6TB deal came out today.  How would it work if I mirrored 2x 6TB, 2x 4TB and 2x 3TB drives in separate vdevs in the same pool?  Will ZFS split the data among them automatically or do I need to do some magic to get it to work as one gigantic /media/giganticZFSdrive mount?"

Fair enough, but they're still a better bang for the buck than $95 2T drives!  Ultimately you can do whatever topology you want, I would just strongly advise you to purchase larger drives than 2T, and to remember that pools can - and usually should - contain more than one vdev.  Mirrors are nice because high performance and because they let you reuse the drives you already have easily and because fast rebuild and because easy upgrade in the future.  But if you want to do RAIDZ2, you can do that too.   I don't own a HBA card for more ports.   Meh.  You can pick up a nice HBA for $100 or so... when you actually need one.  No big deal.  If you're stressing about splitting up boot disks from data disks, btw... don't.  You can partition up the raw disks and do mdadm across small partitions for root, and do ZFS across the big partitions for your pool.  On a pool of 6 4T disks, I generally partition each disk 20G on top and the rest of the disk in the next partition, do mdadm RAID1 across the 20G partition on all disks for /, and do RAID mirrors across the big partitions in pairs for my zpool.

Consider 4TB drives (which still have great TB/$ pricing).  I'd also not be considering any single-parity solutions at all, but I realize that gets you less storage for more money.  To me, your existing equipment screams to get 4 more 4TB drives, resulting a 6-drive array with double parity, 16TB total.  (Or 20TB, if Danger is your middle name.)"
DataHoarder,37ayq5,JohnnieTalker,14,Tue May 26 07:57:28 2015 UTC,"Cool stuff! Here are some ideas as I was reading the original paper:   As the page says, you want to make the process easier such that anyone with a few (hundred) GB of storage could participate with little setup. Would it be feasible to adapt bittorrent technology? I've often joked of backing things up to a torrent (""Probabilistic backup""), but that's essentially what you're doing in this project. The torrent-like tracker could load balance to make sure there are a minimum number of copies for each block.  For playback, some content such as video is expensive to store and serve to the user, as it takes up a lot of space. Could bittorrent technology be used for playback as well? The backup copies would become extra seeds, and the user watching the content could become a temporary seed as well. With enough seeds videos could be played with little buffering time. There was a proof of concept player for streaming pirated movies from torrents. Could implement a credit system such that users who contribute more space/bandwidth have higher priority downloads."

DataHoarder,37ayq5,pmow,3,Tue May 26 11:37:56 2015 UTC,"Torrent technology would be pretty good, although it would probably be best if it was a custom client or maybe a special script that controls transmission daemon or something. It wouldn't be too hard to let the user specify how much space they want to help out with. And the magic of bittorrent, is that they could ask a particular user to upload a random piece of a few files to verify with some certainty that they do in fact still have the files. It is possible to stream video over bittorrent, although the time to initially buffer is quite a bit longer than over http or some other protocol. However, I think such a system would be best suited for backups only. If times did get hard, they could switch over to streaming over BT. Meh."

Generally the recommendation is 1GB of RAM per TB of usable storage for 'good' performance but this isn't strictly necessary.   SO, if you have a dual core machine sitting around that you can slap 8 drives (Full tower or some mid tower with adapters) in then you need a sufficient amount of RAM, and enough ports to plug them in. Mind you FreeNAS is a bit picky about what controller chips it works with so be careful.  If 150 quid is your budget you should probably stay where you're at, FreeNAS + ZFS is a long way away from that.

Every once in a while data just came back bad. Were it not for ZFS I would have never learned this was happening possibly till years later meantime things moved via or stored on those drives would have been riddled with tiny data corruption holes. In a legacy RAID the data corruption from a bad drive can spread to good drives. With ZFS the corruption is isolated and you see it right away before data is lost. ZFS RAIDZ2 or better allows you to use older or cheaper drives with less worries and even top of the line drives shouldn't be trusted 100%.
DataHoarder,37fc9q,czl,1 point,Thu May 28 03:12:24 2015 UTC,"(zfs) cannot easily expand array size to accommodate more drives    Yes and no.  No you can't expand an existing vdev.  However, yes you can add another vdev to an existing pool.  Which is generally going to be a better idea performance and rebuild wise anyway.   build six-drive server now in four years, buy new case with 12 bays (if your existing case won't accommodate them, and, protip: if you haven't already built it, just get a bigger chassis now and save yourself the headache), add six new drives as a new RAIDZ2 vdev to your existing pool    As for bitrot, well I disagree with most of the ZFS army here on its severity or frequency of occurance.   FWIW, I have both seen it happen on non-ZFS systems and seen ZFS save my ass when it occurs on ZFS systems.  The latter is frankly more frequent, because you don't always know about it at all when bitrot happens if you aren't monitoring checksums, but I absolutely have seen the former, on more than one occasion, with my own eyes.  I manage hundreds of storage systems, and single disk checksum errors are pretty frequent.  Most six disk arrays will generate one or more checksum errors on one or more disks within a couple of years.  If you have a disk that fails badly, you can easily see (and I have personally seen) ten thousand plus checksum errors accumulate in the space of a few days.  That's an error mode that would destroy a conventional RAID array (which I have also seen happen), but which ZFS will shrug off for long enough for you to replace the disk."

RAID does not itself use checksums to verify integrity.  It relies on HDD ECC.  For each 512-byte sector on the HDD there are about 40~64 bytes of ECC data used for detection and correction.  If bit error cannot be corrected, status is sent over SATA to the RAID controller which is alerted to the presence of uncorrectable bit error.  A decent RAID implementation will use parity information to recreate correct sector data which is then used to overwrite the uncorrectable sector,  thereby ""resetting"" it."

For each 512-byte sector on the HDD there are about 40~64 bytes of ECC data used for detection and correction.   I'm aware of on-drive ECC.  There are several problems with it: it's an extremely weak algorithm that can have collision problems much more frequently than strong checksumming like ZFS or btrfs use, it doesn't help you a bit if you have problems with cabling, backplanes, or controller ports, and it's frankly not trustworthy because you're at the mercy of the drive manufacturer to have done it right.  Judging by the number of drives I've seen throw tens of thousands of checksum errors, a lot of manufacturers aren't doing it right.   A decent RAID implementation will use parity information to recreate correct sector data which is then used to overwrite the uncorrectable sector, thereby ""resetting"" it.   Any RAID implementation, not just a decent one, will use parity to recreate data blocks if the data block is reported failed, not merely read or written incorrectly.  If the block returns an incorrect value rather than a hard I/O error (or rather than the entire disk dropping out cleanly), most RAID implementations won't even realize there is an error, and will just quietly return you corrupt data.  Some, depending on how they're configured, will detect that there's a mismatch between the data blocks and parity blocks and will return a hard I/O error for the stripe, but they cannot reconstruct the stripe because they don't know which blocks are bad.  In theory, it is possible to figure out which blocks are bad by constructing the stripe repeatedly with different data blocks discarded and replaced by parity.

The errors can occur on-media, the error can occur on-disk-controller, or the error can occur on-SATA(/SAS/SCSI)-controller.  Error correction is also built into TCP.  It, too, is fallible, and in the same ways.  Simple checksums resist corruption but they do not come close to absolutely guaranteeing it won't happen.  None of this is new information.

I designed the board and the FPGA logic, including CRC and ECC in the serial links.  I've debugged low level details such as clock phase and bit errors.

If the stream is more corruption than it is data, the system fails and you expect it to fail, because that's outside the scope of what inline ECC is supposed to handle.  But it's not much of a big deal, because the actual data source is still intact.  In the storage world, if one disk in an array starts throwing a steady stream of garbage, you absolutely want to detect that and correct it, because otherwise you'll lose the entire pool - and restoring from backup is a lot more costly than ""press play again after you replace the cable"".  This can and does happen, and you can't handle it with ECC in the cable, because the drive isn't reporting errors, it's throwing bad data.

Detecting and repairing errors in 60fps video means taking a largely intact data stream and fixing occasional errors   There are actually several issues we're addressing here.  One is on-disk error (bitrot) which the sector ECC covers.  The other is the link error caused by bad cabling or failing transceivers.  The transport link does not care whether the data it receives is ""correct"".  Its only job is to transport the packet from one end to the other.  In this case the camera and HDMI link works the same as ethernet and SATA.  So it's very relevant.   This can and does happen, and you can't handle it with ECC in the cable, because the drive isn't reporting errors, it's throwing bad data. You have similar problems if you end up with cabling or controllers emitting a stream of bad data   Oh absolutely.  But let's consider two separate cases for the home use case.  One is where he's writing to a drive through a bad SATA link.  The drive WILL throw a lot of errors to the controller because the packets WILL fail ECC and CRC checks.  This should be reflected up the chain to the user who must take steps to remedy the problem.  It is likely the write will fail (timeout due to retries exceeding limit).  The second case is reads.  If the transmitter is throwing bad data, or the cabling is bad, the packets will fail ECC/CRC checks at the receiving end.  In that case errors should be issued up to the chain to the user (as it should), who must then debug the problem.  Luckily for home use, the system can stand a little downtime while the user figures out what's wrong."

And it has 24x7x365 reliability.  For even more high-intensive applications and more modern data centers in the enterprise area there are the Re+, Se and Ae drives, all with their respectful designs.  I am detailing this a bit, just to make out the differences between them. Otherwise these NAS/RAID drives all have MTBF info listed in their spec sheets, and the Re and Re+ have AFR listed, as well.

ECC is really considered 'server' or 'enterprise' level . It's usually only used in businesses. That's why you won't see it on many 'consumer' level NAS boxes.

DataHoarder,378enc,Krayziekid,1 point,Mon May 25 18:47:12 2015 UTC,"I would either recommend a Synology Pre-built or building one yourself. I think an OS like OpenMediaVault would be a good starting point for you, however, I have not worked with anything like FreeNAS.  If you are going with an OS like OMV which doesn't ""require"" ECC memory, then you can go with a dual core i3, 8GB of ram, and a motherboard with enough SATA ports for the number of disks you want. I would put this in a fractal R case, as they can hold 8 storage drives (if you use a SSD for boot). This would allow for RAID 10, and has a nice web management page, it also has a plug in for Owncloud, so you can access your files remotely from the web or a mobile app. The only downside to this, is that you would not be able to use a solution like crashplan on the computer, and would need a separate computer to run the backup client.  The nice thing about FreeNAS, from what I've heard, is that you can run programs in jails, and would be able to use crashplan on the same machine. This would allow you to backup over the internet.  Just be advised that raid 10 gives better read and write performance than a parity solution like Raid6, however it offers limited data redundancy. This would could be significant if your moving large files/photos across the internet from Uni, which would not necessarily benefit from those increase speeds due to internet connection.  To summarize:  OMV is good for light hardware and would be good for expand-ability  FreeNAS would be good for incorperating a backup solution such as Crashplan, as it can be run in a jail  The increased performance of raid 10 might not be needed if transferring across the internet."

Once that is entered properly you will have a virtual drive you can extract all data from. Maybe not exactly what you were looking for, but definitely a solution.

Do a backup. 2. Whenever you have spare money get more drives. If you don't need a machine with 24/7 uptime you may have a look at snapRAID. 3. Repeat 2.
DataHoarder,375kz1,ZeDestructor,1 point,Tue May 26 09:39:51 2015 UTC,"First things first: since you are EMR-sensitive (first time I've encountered EMR-sensitivity in the while.. Ultrasonics-induced headaches I've encountered somewhat more often), have you considered putting your hardware in a Faraday cage in order to isolate the EMR? You'll probably need a spectrum analyser to see what frequencies your gear is pushing. Once you know that, you can do some math to figure out the aperture size of the cage and go from there. Your nearby Uni's physics department should be happy to help you do the math. As a side benefit, you'll probably be able to run much more powerful PCs for your desktop use, since you can cage those in a similar fashion.  That taken care of, you want ZFS. ZFS assumes certain things: ECC RAM, a fair chunk of RAM (in the order of 1GB RAM per TB according to the FreeNAS guys), a not weaksauce CPU and regular scrubbing. It also likes a UPS, but a UPS shouldn't be an absolute requirement given ZFS is a journaled filesystem. You should at most lose the tiny amount of data you're actively writing at the time.  Putting all these requirements together, it means you're looking at something like a C2550 or Intel i3 sort of CPU performance level combine with around 8GB of RAM, and I'm afraid an old Pentium 3 era CPU just won't cut it, or support the RAM you want. USB2 is also not a good idea, since you'll be seeing around 30MB/s read/write (USB2 is half-duplex, sadly). This doesn't really matter for general purpose reads and writes, but scrubs check the entirety of the drive, and will keep scrubbing until the check is complete. at 30MB/s, an 8TB array would take about 3 days to complete. When a friend of mine had his mere 3TB array set up over USB2, he was regularly seeing day-long scrubs, and getting annoyed by it. Thankfully it was never intended to be permanent, and soon-ish after he sourced an HBA and external drive tower and reaped the benefits of much healthier 120+MB/s speeds.  For drives, you're looking at more or less equal performance and reliability across brands as long as you stick to their higher end NAS and/or high-performance disks (excluding exceptions like the ST3000DM001 detailed by Backblaze which crop up every now and then). By and large drives follow the ""bathtub"" probability curve, with high infant mortality (failures early in life), very low lifetime mortality and high end of life mortality, so don't be dismayed if a shiny new drive arrives dead or dies within a a few weeks: the odds of it happening were just as high with other brands (specific exceptions excluded, as usual).  Finally, redundancy. With ZFS, you choose how much you want. ZFS operates in something of a tree: at the very bottom, you have your disks, which you bring up into vdevs. vdevs can be a single drive, as they can be multiple, and there you set how much redundacy you want (the famous RAIDZ levels). RAIDZ1 is one disk worth of redundancy, up to RAIDZ3 which is (you guessed it!) 3 disks worth of redundancy, redundancy meaning number of disks that can fail without losing data. The next step up is the zpool, which is made of vdevs. zpools can be striped (RAID0-like) or mirrored (RAID1-like) across vdevs. If you mirror them, you will one vdev worth of space, copied over as many vdevs as you have. If you stripe them, you'll gain faster write speeds then mirroring, but lose the zpool level redundancy. Finally, you have your zvols, which are basically partitions in your zpool. You create and mount your zvols and store stuff on them. zvols are not defined-sized partitions however: multiple zvols all share the same free space as the pool, so you can happily create zvols without worrying about how large to make them. (People who are more familar than me with ZFS, please correct me if I'm wrong. I don't have my own ZFS array to break yet)"

Thanks for the reply :3    One of my friends dislikes SMPSUs that have ""dead-on/rock-solid output"" because of the ringing - you guessed it, headaches.

I get why some people say it's literal overkill for desktop use.  Now you reminded me, I actually remembered reading a bit about how ZFS has high system requirements... I didn't realize how vital they are. ZFS is like... the filesystem equivalent of a database! Instead of ""oh that's the database server"" it's like ""oh that's the ZFS box,"" lol. So it's like... if you want a mirrored 32GB array, you need 64GB RAM? *Shakes head* that's insane.  Unfortunately, at this point, I can't do that much hardware-wise too quickly, so for the time being, I have to say that ZFS is definitely not going to work.  What would be the most ideal alternative? RAID mirroring, I presume?"

So with an 8TB (8000GB) array (fully mirrored, so 16TB raw capacity), you can get away easily with just 8GB of RAM  Which finally brings up to my secret weapon of choice when on a budget: Second-hand hardware!

DataHoarder,3735sy,SirMaster,4,Mon May 25 06:37:14 2015 UTC,I really don't understand your need for sarcasm here....  I was asking a legitimate question.  How is a safe not a generic practice?  I know loads of people with safes in their homes...  Safes have been around forever and they a pretty well known and basic way to protect things.
DataHoarder,3735sy,TheRealHortnon,-3,Sun May 24 22:01:01 2015 UTC,"You're the guy that sits in a class wasting everyone's time with ""Well, what if.. <random barely applicable scenario>""  Sure, safes can be a solution. If you want to spend the time money and effort, and if you even have a location for a safe. Or, the far simpler solution is an offsite backup."
DataHoarder,3735sy,SirMaster,3,Sun May 24 22:02:26 2015 UTC,I just disagree that it's at all random and that it's barely applicable to this situation.

DataHoarder,3735sy,Prentz,0,Tue Jun 9 14:15:12 2015 UTC,Windows 10 took out both my main internal drive and back internal drive at the same exact moment so an external is definitely safer.
DataHoarder,372kkh,tardis777,4,Sun May 24 07:11:39 2015 UTC,"Good question. I don't really know for the reds, but recently I had a couple of old 1TB HGST drives connected, those where at least 2 years on the shelf with no power, all data was there and good. So I don't see too much of a problem using the reds as a cold storage backup, I would assume, that you will spin those up every couple of weeks, since you will need to update your backup from time to time."
DataHoarder,372kkh,Shririnovski,4,Sun May 24 07:25:45 2015 UTC,"Most sources state that permanent magnets lose their magnetic field strength at a rate of 1% per year. Assuming this is valid, after ~69 years, we can assume that half of the sectors in a hard drive would be corrupted (since they all lost half of their strength by this time).   Allowing for other environmental factors and mechanical issues I re-write to a new drive every two years, but also keep the old drive as-is.  I've read data from 20 year old disks without an issue, and have also not been able to read data off 20 day old disks due to mechanical issues.  Just have a couple of copies, in different locations."

DataHoarder,372kkh,linerror,-2,Mon May 25 04:00:56 2015 UTC,"The issue as I understand it is that in a large array (Several TB) the odds of getting an unrecoverable read error in there somewhere are pretty high. If (when) that read error shows up while you are rebuilding, you will be boned, the rebuild will fail, and your day will be ruined."
DataHoarder,372kkh,Jedecon,2,Sun May 24 12:29:44 2015 UTC,"I dunno.  If true, then what would be the point of RAID at all?  All I know is three times I had to rebuild a 6TB array and three times it was successful."
DataHoarder,372kkh,GhoulCanyon2,2,Mon May 25 00:38:27 2015 UTC,assuming you're using some ancient software or hardware... as modern controllers can scrub in the background this isn't really an issue as unreliable sectors will be retired well before they are unreadable. and if you're worried about it... either add parity sets or step up to raid 6 or just make regular backups...
DataHoarder,372kkh,linerror,3,Mon May 25 04:05:12 2015 UTC,"where are you getting this %27 figure? i've probably rebuilt raid 5 sets over 1000 times and the only one that ever failed was due to power failure... and completed successfully after power was restored.  i've personally had offline storage drives that still work after 15 years and counting, however as capacities increase and drive I/O standards change you'll probably replace the drive before it stops being reliable. i've seen hard drives work perfectly fine after 30 years and i'm sure there's longer instances..."
DataHoarder,372kkh,linerror,2,Sun May 24 14:58:40 2015 UTC,I believe he is getting the 27% from this equation:  http://www.raid-failure.com/raid5-failure.aspx  However this calculation is based on some flawed assumptions and that page itself links to some of them.

DataHoarder,370ido,steveh7,4,Sun May 24 01:58:18 2015 UTC,"I tested this a lot, averages about 90MB/s in its current form on writes (rsync'd 6tb).  Reads easily saturate gigabit at 111MB/s (spec'd to 180MB/s).  I agree these aren't for everyone and definitely not for a typical intensive RAID setup.  But for my applications (write once, read often), w/ media and backups, it was an easy choice picking them up for $250 a pop.  I was considering WD 6TB's, but when I weighed my use case, and the fact they would be thrown on gigabit, I opted for more space over performance.  Oh yah, the initial sync on RAID 6 took ~8 days, so not for everyone, but was a good stress test as well :)"

DataHoarder,370ido,just_insane,3,Sat May 23 19:03:58 2015 UTC,Why are you using that mirror setup? Wasting so much space and only one drive of each mirror group can fail safely.. why not raidz-3?  You'd get 14 TB usable instead of 10 TB and ANY 3 drives could fail without losing data
DataHoarder,370ido,xaoq,8,Sat May 23 21:38:04 2015 UTC,Probably better for performance.
DataHoarder,370ido,just_insane,1 point,Sat May 23 21:42:48 2015 UTC,"Maybe, but to be honest, I used mirror setup (albeit smaller) and it was slower than raidz-1 for me. YMMV..."
DataHoarder,370ido,xaoq,4,Sat May 23 21:47:01 2015 UTC,"Is it just a mirror, or is it RAID10? Raid 10 is generally faster."

DataHoarder,370ido,fryfrog,2,Sat May 23 22:00:02 2015 UTC,"Well, I can not only lose one of them but both at the same time :P"
DataHoarder,370ido,PBI325,0,Sat May 23 22:04:32 2015 UTC,"ZFS: You should use mirror vdevs, not RAIDZ.  One big reason being that I can upgrade 2 drives at a time and gain usable space immediately.  Also, the performance is better and the rebuilds are faster.  And frankly, I'm not strung for space... it's all backed up to the NAS and then to Crashplan."
DataHoarder,370ido,RoboYoshi,3,Sat May 23 21:46:49 2015 UTC,"The thing that gets me is that you've only got one drives worth of guaranteed reliability. After that first drive dies, you're ALWAYS running the risk of losing your pool if a second drive dies and it happens to be the partner to the original failed drive. On the plus side, rebuilds are fast and the more mirrors you add, the lower the chances the 2nd failure kills your pool... but it just isn't worth the risk to me.  I've got a pool with two 12x 4T raidz3 vdevs and performance is fine. It was also totally fine when it was just a single 12x 4T raidz3 vdev. Of course, scrubs are slow and at this point take ~24 hours. Still, I prefer this over that 1/23 chance of losing my whole pool I'd be risking with it as a bunch of mirror vdevs."
DataHoarder,370ido,CSFFlame,5,Sun May 24 04:50:09 2015 UTC,"There is no one size fits all.  I could be running these in a RAID0 right now and be totally fine (since they're backed up twice after hitting this volume).  Nothing really wrong with either setup, we just have different use cases.  A 5 hour scrub is pretty sweet though :)"

They contacted me after I ordered it saying it was out of stock, on back-order and wasn't sure when it was going to come in. They offered me the case you just linked to at the price of the cheaper case. I didn't accept, I just waited. I waited for about 2 weeks and in that time I was kind of worried about how cool the drives would sit in that case. Sure its got fans behind the drives sucking inward but there is no air being pushed into the drives from the front. After seeing that Lian-Li case on PCCaseGear with the fans on the front door I was thinking thats perfect. It also conveniently is 4x 3 CD drive bays, So it would hold 4 cages perfectly, SOLD.    My house can get pretty damn hot so keeping my drives cool was a priority. That, and this cases footprint is much smaller than the server case you linked to. That was my thought process lol."

And don't forget ZFS requires pretty good planning, because expansion has some limitations. In your situation, with 20 bays I'd probably start with one 10x 6T raidz2 and then add a second 10x ?T raidz2 to the pool when you're at 50-75% usage on the first. Probably 6T disks because they'll be cheaper, but if you make it long enough... who knows.  I've got a 36 bay chassis and started with a 12x 4T raidz3, recently I added a second 12x 4T raidz3 to the pool. Next is (you guessed it), a third 12x ?T raidz3. I'll use 4T if they're still the best $/GB, but maybe if I'm lucky, 6Ts will be priced right. After that, I'll have to swap disk by disk and rebuild to increase size or start over with a new pool strategy.  And don't forget backups for your critical data. I <3 Crashplan because they have a Linux client. You can backup to their cloud for $, or to your friends for free. I pay for their cloud, but also offer some of my storage space to friends to use for free. I personally don't backup all my data, just the ~1T of critical stuff."

From what I've been told about ZFS it seems that 1GB RAM/1TB of FS is the go-to, so that would mean ~96GB of RAM if you do one filesystem (in RAID-Z1) per bay. Now I don't know what your budget is or if you care, and I know this sub is slightly enamored with the excessive, but that's a bit much.  I'm definitely biased in this regard, and I don't know what your particular use case is either, but you may want to consider doing BTRFS or even going to hardware RAID. I know the opinion is generally that BTRFS isn't the most stable of FS as it's still under pretty heavy development, but I would suggest trying it out (maybe under some pseudo-production level) just to see if it works for you. It's gotten to the point where BTRFS is actually shipped as the default filesystem for a few distributions, so it might be worth it to take a look - maybe just for one of the bays. I use it on my home server/HTPC and my desktop and I've maybe run into two problems over the course of almost four years (a failure after power surge that I think I could have fixed but didn't have the know-how, and rebalancing a RAID-10 to RAID5 failing due to lack of space, the second of which was easily recovered).

You'll never get the power supplies quiet enough for a home. The problem here is enterprise chassis like that have no airflow BC the drives block all the space, that's why they need super loud fans. The 15 bay Nortec I use with Reds (which are under load from a replication) are all at 31-32C with the (Arctic brand regular PC performance) fans inaudible over the drives.  Why? Because there is space around the drives for air to flow. Finally keep in mind most motherboards lie about which PWM ports are actually PWM. On non enterprise boards you have to split them all out of the CPU header to get PWM. Does your backplane do PWM? I'm guessing it doesn't."

DataHoarder,36v8qi,speckz,5,Fri May 22 11:53:43 2015 UTC,"So a silly question. The HGST Deskstar line seems to have stellar reliability. The WD Red line, not so much. The two lines have similar pricing, so it seems like a no-brainer to buy HGST. That said, they are using over 10x as many HGST drives as WD.   So my question is this: Is this apparent difference in reliability because the HGST drives are actually better, or is it because they aren't using enough WD Reds to get accurate data? If it's the former, why is anyone buying Reds?"

Having that said I would agree with you that HGST seems much more steady in their performance. Very steady numbers across the board whereas both Seagate and Western Digital have atleast one series that suffers from a higher then 10% failure rate which I find unacceptable.   Especially the Western Digital line has pretty shocking numbers. 12,9% failure rate on their 3TB Red Series when the average age is ONLY 0,9 years. Seagate has some pretty bad results as well, but at least both the 1.5TB versions are both nearing 5 years of average age, so failure starts getting more frequent.

Why they are dropping is irrelevant when there is a competitor that's perfectly fine under identical conditions.  EDIT: On the subject of drive caddies, this is what a 2.5"" caddy for my DL380 G6 looks like Don't be fooled by the springy-looking contacts: those are just for electrical grounding. On the other-side, we have hard, flat, black plastic. The disks bolt securely into them, and then these go into the cage. Notice the complete lack of damping on the cage itself as well as the large PCB with smallish cutouts? These cages, are in turn bolted directly to the metal frame of the chassis, and thus the vibrations of all the disks are free to feed into each other. In comparison, Backblaze' implementation, especially in pod 3.0 and up is on par or better.  Lastly, on the subject of vertically-installed drives, Supermicro wants in on that market, and they're planning big with a 90-disk vertical-disk chassis (top left) to complement their existing 90-disk SC847 variants."

That way you're very unlikely to end up with 4 drives from a bad batch and have all 4 fail the same week or something. There's lots of reason to mix/match, and very little to have 4 identical drives (at least on raidz/btrfs). For instance, I think it was a batch of Seagates or something that I read about Backblaze or some other company getting that had something like a 35% failure rate. The last thing you want is to try replacing a failed drive and have a second fail during rebuild. Mixing and matching helps to prevent this. Same goes for mixing old and newer drives (altho this really only works with BtrFS, as Raidz doesn't really like adding/removing drives on the fly)."

If memory serves me right, those disks are on a ZFS partitioning scheme, which result in increased array performance, however all the disks are spun up all the time, and adding more disks to the array can be difficult (again, if I'm wrong, please correct me).  Unraid systems have significantly lower array disk performance, however only the disks in use are spun up, and in the event of a multi-disk failure, you don't lose all your data, but just the data on that disk (parity protection covers you for up to 1 disk).  That said, Unraid isn't free, and with version 6, they upped the cost, but I do believe it's worth it.  Prior to v6, plugins were a real head ache to deal with, and often caused system instability, but now with docker and KVM support, unraid should perform great."

If I were in your shoes, I might consider one of those unraid/flexraid systems that ""pools"" the disks into one directory, but keeps the filesystem on the disks. Most of them can add parity to the mix, so you could lose a drive and still have the data. And even if you lose more than one drive, all you're out is the data from the missing disk.  But once you get past 4ish disks, I'd personally switch to raid6 / raidz2. And past 8ish, raidz3 if you're using ZFS."

DataHoarder,36oirm,ravine420,1 point,Thu May 21 00:16:17 2015 UTC,"No I don't think breaking the clip on your sata cable caused your click.  As far as an online backup goes,  you could use something like carbonite or backblaze (I've never used online backup so I'm not sure what to recommend)  but neither of them are free and I'm not aware of any that are.  I've always preferred backing up to another drive myself but that's up to you."

Just get a drive that's exactly the same size as yours.  It's very easy just a couple clicks and wait a few hours for it to clone.

(tip; it can be minutes). If you're also planning FC/ISCSI targets..... that makes it fun for initiators (clients) ---  you'll also need to update client timeouts beyond defaults.  Make sure to test, test, test. make sure you have a non-prod box to test with like-configurations---and have a damn good data plan.  if you need to later zpool destroy... ouch that can take a looooong time and severely impact your storage performance.  don't get me wrong i really like zfs but its not designed to be HA; its designed for high resiliency / integrity."

But truthfully I'm not looking for advice on the high-level right now, I'm wondering if anyone can provide some options for the SAS disk shelves. Right now an old DATADOMAIN ES20 seems to do what I need, but I've not heard of the vendor before and the one doc I found says ""supports 1TB and 2TB disks"", but since it's just SAS I'm not sure that it should care if I use 3+TB disks. And I've also been reading that NetApp SAS shelves seem to be vendor-neutral on the controller side, along with HP and Dell shelves, but again I don't touch this tech new regularly so I'm not sure what I'm really looking for. I'd ask in /r/sysadmin but I figured I'd try /r/datahoarder first since it's more home-friendly (and, crazy as this is, it's going in my basement)."
DataHoarder,36mnde,kliman,1 point,Thu May 21 03:42:01 2015 UTC,"I'll preface this by saying it's entirely possible there's tech I'm unaware of that works this way (with plain SAS-connected disk shelves being managed by 2 hosts on the same bus), but I've never seen it.  Generally you want something more like a SAN or NAS providing block-level storage to the servers that make up the cluster.  I've worked mainly with Dell/HP stuff...what I think you should consider looking at is an MD3000.  It's a proper SAN and can manage connectivity up to 4 hosts with full active/active cluster support, and it's not expensive.  You have the ability to connect up to 2 more MD1000 for 45 spindles total, should you need. With regards to that Datadomain ES20...I actually have one of those.  Not a bad unit (it's actually an EMC chassis rebranded for datadomain), but it's pretty noisey and power-hungry.  They are correct about the 2TB drives.  Larger drives are detected as weird/small sizes incorrectly. Another word of advice (if I may), as someone who's been in the industry for a long time and has tried every type of system at home from a simple NAS to a full-on vmware cluster network...KEEP IT SIMPLE.  What you are trying to set up is cool...but honestly, it's going to cause you more outages and downtime than just having a simple server would.  By all means, set something up and play with it and push the buttons and learn how it all works...just keep it out of production (even if it is for your own use at home)."

Anyway that limit on a consumer SATA disk ~500MB/s is going to come from the 6gbps interface limit.  NVME is giving a faster communication medium and a jump to 2.2GB/s  its nothing to scoff at.  that power jump is interesting though looking at a speed perspective increase---the watts per MB/s of traffic seems in the same ballpark.

Sequential isn't even the most important part, it's the IO for most people, which even my 3 year old one does 75k and 25k reads/writes IO, which is a hell of a lot more than the few hundred HDD do.  I do know that SATA is the bottleneck and did read anandtech's article about NVMe, but even PCIe has has muti gig speeds for a while with PCIe SSD's so I personally don't think it's anything ground breaking.

DataHoarder,36jm43,darkrom,1 point,Wed May 20 15:14:07 2015 UTC,"Head parking is a normal part of drive operation.   It's primarily to protect the platter and heads. Power saving is a secondary benefit, not the main reason.  The actuator arms are rated for hundreds of thousands of head parks. WD consumer drives typically 300K-600K. They test them to 1,000,000. HDD engineers don't consider high load cycles counts to be a common cause or predictor of drive failure.   Where it becomes a problem is specific drives or environments that resulted in excessive head parking. If it looks like you're going to exceed the rated load cycles in <5 years then you may have an issue worth investigating."

DataHoarder,36jm43,BloodyIron,1 point,Wed May 20 22:01:57 2015 UTC,"Okay so I read the two links, and here is what I have to say.  For link 1:  The point that the consumer vs enterprise is not a fair comparison due to massive difference in unit numbers, is a fair argument. I would agree with theregister that that particular comparison is slanted.  However, the value of the information provided for the consumer disks on their own merit is still valuable. It's not enough to determine if it's better/worse/comparable to enterprise disk, but it's enough to reasonably plan around.  For link 2:  The link states that the oldest drives have the highest failure rate, which actually is untrue, as the information provided in the very same article outlines. The highest rate, the Seagate 1.5TB 7200, has a failure rate of 25.4% with an average lifespan of 3.8 years. Yet there are 3 other drive models in the same test that are as old or older with significant differences in failure rates.   Seagate 1.5TB LP, 3.8yr, 9.9% WD Green 1TB, 4.4yr, 3.6% WD Green 1TB, 5yr, NA% (why it's NA is beyond me though)   So the argument that age leads to skewed numbers due to enclosure revision is not backed up by the stats. Ergo it becomes a moot point.  Generally the two links do not inherently and totally discredit Backblaze. There are some areas they need to improve on, but the data still has value, with certain caveats.  It's also worth noting that there is quite a bit of subjective spin in the way both of those articles are written, making it challenging to stay objective in such comparative discussions. Which annoys the crap out of me.  Thanks for the links though!"

That's not inherently bad, but your argument was essentially that his/her data is ""wrong"" because it's based on personal experience, which is laughable. Backblaze puts drives through a different experience that most of us can only dream of in home applications. meeekus took action on the main issue known for using Greens, which is the head parking issue, and all has been fine with his/her 14 drives, which is great. Obviously the vibration isn't as much of an issue as for Backblaze, and they're likely under much less load.

They use effectively a scientific method to not only track important stats, but also publish them concisely, and in an accurate form. Their scale is irrelevant as their findings have been able to outline important points to consider at any scale, such as observed failure rates from one model/vendor to the next.  The information provided by /u/meekus is anecdotal because there is no method or statistical data backing the statement. As such it's not so much that it's ""wrong"", more that it's not tangible or able to be used as reliable reference.  Parking the head is one of the two issues I outlined. The bigger issue is the way WD Greens handle error correction, which I provided sources for including Western Digital as a source when outlining the problem and the solution.  You're not even actually reading what I'm saying. You're skimming it and drawing your own conclusion. Not only is what you're saying not constructive, it's actually destructive to an outside party and this thread."
DataHoarder,36jm43,BloodyIron,1 point,Wed May 20 21:07:52 2015 UTC,"None of my criticism had to do with error correction. I didn't read the links either. My criticism has nothing to do with any facts presented. My only problem is that you seem to be saying that it's wrong to conclude that it's OK to use Greens for NAS usage because Backblaze threw a ton of them together in a data center and they couldn't stand the vibration on that scale. Obviously, that's a dumb conclusion to make from the given data.   Granted, you did point out that not having TLER can cause issues, but I'm not targeting the validity of that.   All I'm doing is pointing out the flaws of your logic. You don't even have to be incorrect on the raw facts for me to have a point. Commentary on your thought process is not nonconstructive at all unless I make false claims, which I'm not, seeing as I'm not making claims of fact."
DataHoarder,36jm43,jtaylor991,1 point,Wed May 20 21:28:42 2015 UTC,"1) Not once, in this thread, did I use the word ""wrong"" except when responding to your claims that I used it. Stop saying I said that, it's 100% false.  2) WD Greens being inappropriate for NAS usage isn't limited to information provided by Backblaze. If you actually read my citations THE MANUFACTURER even says they are inappropriate due to the way they handle error correction failures which is actually important in a NAS setup. This is also observed multiple times from other sources. It is a bit anecdotal but I have seen many threads on hardocp saying it's problematic to operate without TLER or equivalent functionality. But the manufacturer as a source should be sufficient for you to realize it's a bad idea.  3) You're not pointing out the flaws of my logic. You're putting words in my mouth, and not actually reading the citations I'm providing. By those considerations you are not actually debating me, you are debating yourself. I didn't say those things, and you aren't even addressing what I actually said.  This conversation, is over."

After rebuilding linux, mac, and windows machines multiple times, I got tired of losing data, so now all of my files go onto storage drives. nothing important gets saved to the OS drives. On the storage drives, I have a directory structure somewhat based on gtd (getting things done, if you aren't familiar), and HOW OFTEN I USE THE FILES. This has taken me about 10 years to get to this structure, and it works for me and my workflow.    action -  WIP, or do it very soon, notes, the one project I'm working on, etc active_personal - personal files I don't want in deep archive, and access somewhat frequently. Has folders like ""financial"", ""pictures"", etc active_work - work files that are active archive_personal - personal files I rarely, if ever, touch - almost mirrors active_personal, most of the time I just move files from that folder to this one archive_work - work files that are old, old projects, etc media - music, etc resources - stuff like fonts, templates, reference pdfs, application installers, etc volatile - every other thing that I don't care about, can be easily found again online, etc. It used to be called ""shitbox"", if that gives you a clue :)  VMs - virtual machines only   So, anything I have to take care of soon, I put in 'action.' Stuff I use somewhat frequently is ""active."" If it's something not worked on recently, I move it to one of the 'archive' folders. 'Resources' are fonts, pdfs, etc, that I need to get things done, but aren't mine. 'Volatile' is mostly junk, it can go away, and I don't care about the files in there. I periodically wipe contents from that folder.   I link directories in my home dir to this - so volatile has a ""Downloads"" folder that is linked, music links to other music drive, etc. I have about 6TB of content organized in this way. I back up my storage drives twice, both locally and remote, and back up my homedir (for settings and conf files).

There are only a few root-level directories:  Video Audio Images Literature Documents Software Designs*   Note how many of them actually follow the mime-types top-level categories.   Where applicable, the subdirectories for these follow Plex naming conventions. Videos are remuxed to have the correct language metadata and to be put into mp4 containers, things of that nature.

DataHoarder,36hztp,sal_the_tiller,2,Tue May 19 17:04:00 2015 UTC,"To give a little more detail, NAS stands for Network Attached Storage. Generally, a NAS is any storage device connected to your network, like an external drive connected to a new router. When most of us say NAS though, we're referring to a computer of some description with two or more drives in a RAID (basically, a way to use multiple disks to have faster access and/or protect against drive failure) or RAID-like system. You can buy these direct from companies like Synology, convert an old server from eBay, or build one yourself. Most of us DataHoarders have a NAS of some type, because they're a good way to get a lot of reliable storage that's easy to access.  To answer your top level question, I also use generic root folders that get more specific the deeper you go. Ex, TV Shows > Show Name > Season 01 > Episode 1, Projects > Project Name > README, etc. Whatever you end up doing, make use of automation. Programs like MusicBrainz Picard, FileBot, and AmoK EXIF Sorter will make your life a whole lot easier. Also get a batch renamer, there are tons for every OS. Make sure your files are named clearly, descriptively, and using the correct encoding. Seriously, a sneaky Shift-JIS character will make for an unfun time."

DataHoarder,36ifb0,shadeland,1 point,Tue May 19 22:37:59 2015 UTC,"That's defined by your retention policy. The key point between a nightly rsync and robocopy duplicates is that with robocopy you always have a COMPLETE copy from a previous date you can restore. The rsync example is not a backup because during the rsync you have no complete copy anywhere. If your computer dies during the rsync, you can't just copy it back to restore it since the files are not all in sync.  Using robocopy to make full copies to different locations is a backup, because if your computer dies during the copy you can take the previous day/week's backup and restore it."

Backups allow you to get to the state you were in, before you hit enter :)  There are historic filesystems that deal with this also, clearcase uses MVFS as an example.. Versioning in the FS...

DataHoarder,36ifb0,jamauai,2,Tue May 19 19:07:02 2015 UTC,"There are three concepts:   1) Data protection: Replication on a file, bit, or other level  2) Backup: Taking data, typically files, and putting them somewhere)  3) Archive: Data you want to keep forever, as in forever-ever. (You might expire it after a certain amount of time, but usually not)  Backups can sometimes get erased to make room for newer files, depending on your backup mechanism. That's why it's distinct form Archive."
DataHoarder,36ifb0,thiguyisanidiot,1 point,Tue May 19 21:37:23 2015 UTC,"A backup is an exclusive snapshot that exists statically from any other backup. You would ideally have multiple backups, ie multiple checkpoints in time to jump back to if needed.  Also its smart to have hardware redundancy for your current/live data, so if a hardware failure occurs, there is no loss in current data (non-backed-up).  This is why enterprise environments (where data is mission-critical) have large arrays with multiple local snapshots and multiple offsite backups (in case a disaster occurs on site).

DataHoarder,36ifb0,twistacles,1 point,Tue May 19 20:34:16 2015 UTC,If you combine shadow copy (or some other form of file system level snapshot) with replication to a different device then you're pretty close to having a real backup solution.
DataHoarder,36jpz4,Drevkevac,2,Tue May 19 21:59:56 2015 UTC,"You could try just remuxing them with ffmpeg and the last time I tried that it droped bad frames so it probably should be all you need to do. These commands do not transcode, which is good and as that would just take a while and lower the quality.  ffmpeg -i ""path/to/source/video.mp4"" -map 0 -c copy ""path/to/destination/video.mp4""   The map 0 should copy all streams. That should work, but if it has problems try:  ffmpeg -i ""path/to/source/video.mp4"" -vcodec copy -acodec copy ""path/to/destination/video.mp4""   That one doesn't keep subs, you would have to use this one if the video has subs:  ffmpeg -i ""path/to/source/video.mp4"" -vcodec copy -acodec copy -scodec mov_text ""path/to/destination/video.mp4""   Anyways you could see if the first one works, which it should and then just script it for all your videos."

DataHoarder,36jpz4,audio_pile,2,Wed May 20 01:07:38 2015 UTC,"This was the latest pathfinder version (30 day trial), on the yosemite 10.10.3 ( whatever the latest non beta version is), on a 2015 rMBP 13 in. This was an afp to different afp transfer, both afp shares were hosted on the same freenas server. I later tested with a few isos, with pathfinder, the md5s did not match, with rsync they did. Many of the videos are only slightly damaged, so it would be easy for silent bitrot to set in. Let me know if further testing to better isolate the issue would be helpful."
DataHoarder,36jpz4,audio_pile,1 point,Wed May 20 01:47:44 2015 UTC,Lovely. I own a PF7 license; run it on a MBP and a Hack. 10.10.3 Lots of AFP file transfer between a FreeNAS and a mini server.  Now i'm going to take a good look at some of my data; Concerned mostly because I've had glitchy playback every once in a while in VLC via files on shares mounted in PF7 but I figured it was from the usual run of scrubbing though a video and the cache not keeping up or whatever.   Out of curiosity; Are your shares being mounted via the pathfinder GUI or Finder; was Pathfinder set as your handler for afp:// in settings?
DataHoarder,36jpz4,bilbob4gginz,1 point,Wed May 20 02:12:42 2015 UTC,"I never changed my default afp handler (Im fairly new to mac, so I don't actually know how to do that), however I believe the shares were mounted via pathfinder in this case. I noticed because over the course of several copies and transfers, vlc got increasingly fidgety during playbacks. I have not yet done extensive enough testing to confirm if it's an issue with my mac, my nas, or pathfinder, but my hunch is pathfinder.  Check your video's checksums with your backups, if you have them!   Edit: I was poking around further for testing purposes, and the videos on the AFP share now seem to be working (through Finder, my PF trial expired, so I can no longer test with that). It is possible that AFP/network congestion may have interfered with playing the videos back from the afp share; afp does not seem to be the most efficient or robust protocol. Since I don't have checksums for the originals, I cannot be 100% sure. However, I am definitely certain that when I later tested it with an ISO image, the checksums from before and after the PF transfer on that image did not match, although again this may be the fault of afp.   My conclusion is that if you data checksums right, and works properly, there probably is not an issue."

Of course it can't cache all files so I'm not sure how it chooses what to cache.  The way it works is when you first sync and say it wants to cache file.exe so it copies that to it's cache. Then next backup it notices NAS\file.exe has changed, but normally it wouldn't know what has changed in it as it normally just keeps hashes that doesn't tell you anything about the file itself. Since it actually cached this file though it can now just compare cached file.exe to the NAS\file.exe and see what has changed and only upload changed parts.  This would work best for larger files so I would hope they aren't caching txt\word\pdf and more like videos and exe's. Anyways you can disable the cache or limit it in the options."
DataHoarder,36ku9a,Balmung,1 point,Wed May 20 16:58:26 2015 UTC,Maybe I'm using it different than you but the cache clears for me when a backup set completes. I have mine set to the default Intellicache in the cache setting and I manually backup files little by little.

That sounds to me like maybe a controller failure. As a method of last resort, you could try swapping the controller board with a known-good drive. If you can get a replacement of the exact same model/firmware version, great. If not, perhaps the other drives in the array are -- but you'll have to first clone them to new drives. In either case, once you have a known-good replacement board on a drive you no longer need (either because it's new or because it's been cloned), it's simply a matter of unscrewing and rescrewing the boards and delicately removing and reconnecting the ribbon cable.  Obviously this is a probably warranty-voiding trick, but it may save your data. On the other hand, if it doesn't work, it can screw up your data even more thoroughly. If you were thinking of going the data recovery route, DO NOT attempt controller board replacement. Leave it to the pros.

When you use a tool to read the SMART values of your hard drive, the tool gives you the treshold data etc. which is all INTERPRETED (normalized etc.) by the program. Sometimes it shows you 100 relocated sectors, when the raw value says 000.  No idea how this is remotely relevant to people who made the hard drive. The manufacturer only defines the limits you should look out for."
DataHoarder,36efr4,arienh4,2,Tue May 19 15:49:21 2015 UTC,"Err, not quite. Both value and raw_value are provided by the hard drive. You also don't seem to know how to read them.  If the value for relocated sectors says 100, that means the drive has about 100% of its spare sectors left. This counts down to a threshold, around 0% or 10%. Considering the raw value is 0, this makes sense.  Just because you don't understand them doesn't make the SMART value useless. Generally, you just need to compare the values to the thresholds, the raw_data isn't particularly useful unless you know exactly how many spare sectors your drive has and know how to calculate the percentage yourself."

DataHoarder,36fvqm,worldlybedouin,2,Tue May 19 21:37:45 2015 UTC,"Synology NAS's all run the same OS, so from a usability standpoint, they are all the same. From a ""noob-friendly"" standpoint, probably the only thing you need to worry about is capacity. Just buy a unit that scales to the capacity you think you will need. This Synology Raid Calculator is an excellent tool to help you with that. You virtually slot in the disks you want, and it will recommend a size for you.   If you want to jump past the ""noob-friendly"" stage, there is one other thing I would recommend you consider. If you want to have your Synology run some of the many community driven applications, then you need to do some research on which models have which internal CPU's. If you just want an iTunes server, then the low end models are good, if you want to start running Python apps for media collection and indexing, then maybe look at some of the midlevel models or higher.   Start with the capacity calculator, its really a great tool. I recommend using SHR-2 as the raid level when calculating capacity, that is the Synology version of RAID6, or dual parity, meaning that you can lose two drives before the array dies giving you time to get a replacement disk and rebuild the array."

DataHoarder,36h112,WineVirus,7,Tue May 19 09:34:03 2015 UTC,"The encoder which most guys are using (x265) achieves very good results relative to x264 at very low bitrates.   Encode some live action 1080p at 500kbps with x264 and it will be blocky and ragged... do the same with x265 and it will be much smoother looking and less obviously artifacting.  But it will still be very low quality, because 500kbps is not an appropriate resolution for 1080p no matter the codec used. Lower quality than most people consider watchable.  At more appropriate bitrate ranges - eg ~8Mbps for 1080p in most cases x265 is about the same or even worse than x264. It has a tendency to soften the image and blur fine detail/textures.   Over time it will improve and I know the developers (who are not the same guys behind x264) are bringing in features to try and improve the blurring problem.   But at the moment, if you are going for high-quality encodes you should stick to x264 for your encodes."

I have checked them and as expected they are very low quality. 900kbps is simply too low for live action 1080p, even using x265.   As mentioned x265 will certainly do a better job than x264 at this very low bitrate. But it's not something I would have any interest in watching or encoding myself."
DataHoarder,36h112,kannibalox,1 point,Tue May 19 13:57:13 2015 UTC,Thanks. I did some more research and it seems your right considering 720p is far above 900kbps.  Do you have a suggestion on what I should be looking for(size wise) for 1080p?
DataHoarder,36h112,JackACooper,1 point,Tue May 19 14:16:41 2015 UTC,"You want to look at bitrate rather than size because some episodes are much shorter than other. It's simple to go back and forth once you know the runtime.  However, to immediately contradict myself i'm averse to talking in absolutes when it comes to bitrate since a 1080p cartoon may look wonderful at 4Mbps whereas a grainy live-action show (eg Walking Dead) may look pretty bad. For this reason most encoders no longer target a given bitrate when encoding, they use CRF.   But since you wanted an answer, speaking very generally with live action 1080p, if you value quality, you're rarely going to want anything much below 5 or 6Mbps. Usually 7,8+ is more reasonable. This is talking about x264.   When x265 matures you can maybe achieve the same quality at 2/3 the bitrate. Right now it can't (except in the aforementioned super-low bitrate range, or 4K encoding)."
DataHoarder,36h112,SirMaster,7,Tue May 19 14:56:35 2015 UTC,"The implementations of codecs for h265 are still lacking; it takes a mammoth's age to encode a movie, even on a beastly CPU. I'm looking forward to when it's ready ""for production"", but it's just not there yet."
DataHoarder,36h112,Shririnovski,2,Tue May 19 11:14:14 2015 UTC,"This is a comparison I prepared a while back to demonstrate x265 vs x264 copied verbatim:  From this comparison you can see that encoding with identical bitrates in both x264 and x265 yields similar file sizes (not enough deviation to matter). However it becomes apparent at such a low bitrate that x265 is able to maintain perceived quality, whereas the x264 encoding suffers from blocking artifacts to the point it isn’t even watchable at times.  I was planning to include a vp9 encoding, but it will not be complete for about a week at the settings I am using.  Constants: Bit Depth: 8 FPS: 24000/1001 Average Bitrate: 881 kbps (vbr options added as well) CPU Threads: 1 Motion Estimation: Uneven Multi Hexigonal Motion Estimation Range: 24 Variable Bitrate Buffer Size: 31250 Variable Bitrate Max Rate: 31250 B-frames: 3 B-frame Bias: 0  Versions Used: x264-0.142.2431-ac76440 x265-1.1+192-fe370292c232ec9a  Included is the source video and the subsequent encodings there of (x264-dbr is double the bitrate at 1762 kbps as a comparison for quality to show that x265 does achieve twice the perceived quality at the same bitrate, even though it isn’t preserving anymore detail). I chose this clip because it has a few things most encoders struggle with, retaining quality and definition in dark scenes as well as preserving the detail of facial features and this clip does well to exaggerate both. I will have to look for a clip that shows screen tearing to show the difference in motion estimation of the encoders (something with a lot of camera panning is where it would show the most)  https://mega.co.nz/#!YM1GBDjI!5SKnXjgIt-gUgoIs59LThXdQUPDj7HeZs5pmHkqntVw (~902mb)  SSIM Comparison: They are very close which makes sense because x264 preserves quality uniformly across the frame, whereas x265 preserves only portions of the frame with higher detail. For the lack of a better description, it follows along the lines of the Law of Conservation of Matter. You aren’t changing the bitrate, so therefore the filesize is constant and you have the same amount of bits in which store data; as well you aren’t gaining any compression from x264 -> x265, so therefore it is just rearranging bits to better preserve portions of the frame with more detail through the use of “Coding Units”.

Before that, i would always be looking for a particular file in my cabinet and I could never find it. Probably because I had to wade through all the files that I indexed away for god knows what reason.   Eventually, I began going through all of the pictures from my childhood. They were precious to me because there were not many.   My fiance thought I was obsessive; all the time I spent preserving these seemingly insignificant memories and then scattering them across the Internet. I didn't expect her to understand because she hasn't had to deal with the uncertainty that has been my genesis.   A couple weeks ago her childhood home was knocked down by a tornado.

DataHoarder,36azxy,flyingwolf,6,Sun May 17 22:19:47 2015 UTC,Netdrive has been the only good tool I have been able to get my hands on.  Although I had issues using Netdrive to upload.  Currently I am using the Amazon Windows Application to upload my files and the Netdrive to access my content once its there.  This has been working well for the last few days.  I am actually able to run a Plex server off of it.    Amazon definitely has some type of issue with very large files (over 10 Gigs)  I gave up on even trying to upload those files because they would always cause Netdrive or the Amazon Upload app to crash.  Even with this setup I have had Netdrive crash on me a few times.  Wish Netdrive had an easy way to restart their service.  Whenever it crashes on me I have to restart my PC to get it running again.
DataHoarder,36azxy,TheQuietOne,2,Sun May 17 23:23:57 2015 UTC,"This is really interesting. How is Plex performing through this? Are you actually running your Plex in the Amazon Cloud as well, or are you running it from your home network, which accesses the files through Amazon Cloud?  If that storage is truly unlimited this offers a pretty sleak way to both backup and acces media files! Any clue on how it performs with multiple streams?"
DataHoarder,36azxy,railsornery,2,Sun May 17 23:57:31 2015 UTC,I Have Netdrive setup on the PC that I use as my plex server.  With the Amazon Cloud mapped to a drive letter I then just add folders from the Amazon Cloud drive mapped by Netdrive to my plex libraries.    Its been working surprisingly well.  I have only had two streams going at once but no problems.  There is a noticeable few second delay before a movie will start playing but after that works as if its local.  Keep in mind I keep my movies in the 1 - 2 Gig range but it seems to work with the 4 gig movies I have just as well.  One other thing I should mention is the meta collection by plex was a lot slower then I am used to but I am not sure if that was because of this setup or just because I was adding 200+ movies to it at one time when I was working with it on Saturday.
DataHoarder,36azxy,TheQuietOne,1 point,Tue May 19 01:55:31 2015 UTC,One amazing application could be linking this to Google Apps Unlimited.

No matter how you try, cataloging up terabytes of tunes in plex will make you see red... might just note here that plex is traversing your directory stack as it hunts for tracks, then writing it back to its library dir.  When that part takes longer then the window you provide things start to get whack.  Regardless of rescans, the refresh still whine... See man.. Full Directory scans cost time.. specially when dealing with Terabytes of tunage.  Cost A is the read the dirs to build the lib, Cost B is refreshing the Dictionary from that tree.  And Cost C, the time the server spends doing the above is easy to see...  And like.. um, eating CPU does reduce, when you feed it a GPU it can use.  Plex is a fork out the same tree as pretty much all the rest.. We all love it for the common bits, no client seems missed.. but don't kid yerself mon, I/O is like physics, buffering might fool you, but speeds and feeds are reality and not dreams.  Note..

Or both. To get both, you add another layer, which is where setups like RAID 10 get their name 1 + 0. The wikipedia page is fairly readable. RAID 5 requires 3 or more drives, and can operate with 1 failed drive. If another drive fails on rebuild, then you're fucked.  For PSU selection, people tend to estimate based on worst case (maximum draw of each component). Just a quick estimate: HDD's, 15 watts ea (~120), memory can't be much more than 40 watts. SSDs take like 5. CPU, say you go with a G3258 or cheaper i3,i5.. 50-90 watts. No GPU. ~ 225 roughly? Shouldn't be a big issue.

DataHoarder,36afld,SteveZ59,5,Sun May 17 21:52:41 2015 UTC,"There absolutely is a reason people make that recomendation!  I had it happen to me personally.  I bought (3) 2 TB Western Digital drives from NewEgg for my media server.  They came with sequential serial numbers.  All three drives wound up being RMA'ed within a two month window.  I was fortunate in that it didn't cost me any data.  When the 1st one failed in service I was able to rebuild the array.  Once I had the RMA'ed drive back from the 1st failure, I pulled the other two drives and ran a series of data tests on them.  Both wound up failing fairly close to each other during the read/write testing I put them through.  Had I left them in service they would have failed, and might well have failed close enough together that the 2nd would have died during the array rebuild after the 1st.  The last two times I needed drives I drove to Microcenter where I could paw through the stock and pick serial numbers that where as far apart from each other as could manage."

DataHoarder,36afld,SteveZ59,0,Mon May 18 20:06:36 2015 UTC,"But my 3 drives isn't the only sample either.  It's happened to plenty of other people as well.  It doesn't happen to everyone obviously, but when building your system why would you not do everything you can to help protect yourself?  It's not exactly just a hard drive thing either.  I've run into it multiple times at work with different types of equipment where the manufacturer has an issue and you get a string of failures because you bought a bunch at once and have 20 pieces of equipment that all have the same manufacturing flaw.  Someone buying thousands of drives at once is also going to be running far more than a simple software raid, along with some form of automated backup.  So that's not terribly relevant to the systems the vast majority of the people here run then is it?  For people running systems that only protect against a single drive failure, which is an awful lot of people on this Reddit I would be willing to bet, it's worth the little bit of effort to do whatever can be done to help mitigate the possibility of two failures close enough together to crater your system.  I didn't follow it myself because I figured with modern drives it was statistically unlikely to be a problem.  But guess what, even a long shot still sucks when you are the one in a million it happens to.  So why not take the little extra effort to help reduce those chances when you can?"

I run 16GB ECC in my rig with 6x3TB IN RAIDZ2 but allocate 6GB of that to a Windows VM. Don't have any issues saturating 1Gb link so I have no further complains there!
DataHoarder,36afld,bahwhateverr,3,Mon May 18 21:12:40 2015 UTC,I would strongly recommend running a raidz2 rather than just a z1. I would also recommend trying to source the drives from multiple companies to avoid getting drives from the same batch and therefor reduce the probability of multiple simultaneous failures.  edit: Just noticed the part about only running 4 drives initially. You may wish to research what your options for expanding later on are. You may be somewhat disappointed.
DataHoarder,36afld,Y0tsuya,1 point,Sun May 17 20:16:49 2015 UTC,"I already wanted to buy them in batches from different places and times to try to eliminate risk, never thought of other brands.  What would you think, throw in a Hitachi or two?  As for raidz2, I was worried about ""giving up"" potential storage, is it really worth the trade off?"
DataHoarder,36afld,bahwhateverr,6,Sun May 17 20:21:11 2015 UTC,"This batch thing is overplayed to the point of paranoia.  HDDs like all electronics and mechanical systems follow the bathtub curve for failures.  A manufacturing or design flaw that causes all drives in the same batch to fail simultaneously is a very, very rare occurrence.  My take is some people who experience rebuild failures due to 2nd/3rd drive failing blame this batch thing instead of their own inattentiveness to drive conditions.  It's certainly nothing to get all worked up about.  Remember that datacenters buy these things by the pallet."
DataHoarder,36afld,bahwhateverr,1 point,Mon May 18 01:13:41 2015 UTC,"Let me play out a scenario for you and then I think you'll be able to answer both of your own questions.  Let us say you create a 4 disk raidz1. You can withstand one total disk failure. Everything is happy but one day one of the disks dies. So, you still have all your data but you aren't protected.  You yank the dead drive and begin the warranty process with WD. You ship the dead drive off and some time later, lets say 5 days, you get the replacement drive.  You plop the new drive in and the pool begins to resilver. How long this process takes is a function of the total size of the disks, how fast they are, and what other load is placed on the system. Let's say this process takes 24 hours to complete. Also keep in mind during this time the disks will be placed under their greatest level of stress.  How confident are you that during this period of 6 days none of the other disks will fail? If you are very confident, or you have current backups and restoring from them doesn't bother you, then a raidz1 may be a great fit for you. If you are not confident, or do not have backups, you may want to consider a raidz2 so you can withstand multiple failures."
DataHoarder,36afld,daAnjin,1 point,Sun May 17 20:33:05 2015 UTC,"Welp, that kick started my anxiety.  This would be a backup machine, so may be worth it to add the extra level.  Thanks."

DataHoarder,36afld,daAnjin,1 point,Sun May 17 20:52:01 2015 UTC,"Beg to differ.  Dont cache mirrors.. but always add l2arc for raidZ.  If you doubt this, just test scrubbing..  No its not caching I/O.  But it is caching the LBA...  just my two cents..."
DataHoarder,36afld,bahwhateverr,1 point,Sun May 17 21:38:31 2015 UTC,It gets cached in the ARC and the only way it ends up in the L2ARC is if it gets evicted from the ARC. With OP's usage and 16GB of ram that isn't going to happen.
DataHoarder,36afld,daAnjin,1 point,Sun May 17 22:03:01 2015 UTC,Might I inquire where this understanding comes from?  :)
DataHoarder,36afld,bahwhateverr,1 point,Sun May 17 22:21:32 2015 UTC,Many hours of trying to get my L2ARC to be used :)
DataHoarder,36afld,daAnjin,1 point,Sun May 17 22:29:08 2015 UTC,"Heh.. Understand that... its some crazy black magic for sure.  L2arc is not traditional cache.  The best place to get a nice view is in the source.  usr/src/uts/common/fs/zfs/arc.c   There is no eviction path from the ARC to the L2ARC.  Evictions from the ARC behave as usual, freeing buffers and placing headers on ghost lists.  The ARC does not send buffers to the L2ARC during eviction as this would add inflated write latencies for all ARC memory pressure.   There are some very important reasons to use l2arc.  Especially if you support any threaded task... Im pretty sure if you read the comments from the source... Perhaps dig up some of Brenden Greggs notes... and understand this is not normal caching.  A whole new beast, a whole new way.  And ZFS is designed to have it, and really wants it...   Think of the case of sabnzbd.  It might have 50 connects to a usenet server, each one pulling thousands of files, reassembled into chunks then depared, derared, and fed to plex, which launches a bunch of threads to index it, catalog, etc.  Each of those is gonna grab a hunk of that l2arc... A day after boot, my l2arc will be 400GB on a machine with 64GB of memory.....   If the service was designed around such an important construct, why remove what those that designed and wrote it decided you needed?  My personal view is always use the best practice to deploy.  Compare your needs to the best practice, and if it varies, ponder how you can improve it.  Trust in the ARC :)"
DataHoarder,36afld,daAnjin,1 point,Sun May 17 22:37:15 2015 UTC,"Just now seeing your edit, why would I be disappointed with my expansion options?  Would it not be possible for me to create another 4 drive array?"
DataHoarder,36afld,daAnjin,1 point,Tue May 19 19:27:22 2015 UTC,"Yes you could. I brought it up because I see a lot of people thinking they can expand the current pool by adding a drive or two at a time, like you would with hardware raids."
DataHoarder,36afld,daAnjin,1 point,Tue May 19 19:45:11 2015 UTC,"The asrock has 4 SATA controllers.  2 - 2 port type 3, 1 - 4 port type 3, 1 - 4 port type 2.  You should build around that.  Your milage may very, but I chose to put a pair of the fastest SSD drives I could afford on one 2 port controller.  Then I put my two 4 wide stacks on each of the others.  Assign an SSD to each disk group as l2cache.   And finally put two of the biggest disks you can source on the last dual port.    I also noted on Amazon, that big external drives cost less.  I ended up with Seagate 5TB platters for about 115 each.  But they were in cases.  Simply pop them out and you get to keep the wall wart, usb to sata adapter and casing.  Those cases make awesome SBC cabinets.. room for an arm sbc, an HDMI controller, and a 7"" LCD fits perfect on the side.. :)    So.. next question, why only one SSD above?  dont tell me you planned to boot off it... All you need is a pair of fast usb sticks.  Get two ssd's instead, and use as described above.  The point is that you are gonna supplement the systems ability to track change using ultra fast SSD drives like memory.  Memory!!  2.4 ghz atom man, yer not playing far cry here.  Get the 1333, you will find it on sale all over... And fill that board with every stick you can afford.  Do it now, when you remeber what your buying.  Make sure its all the same memory, so it plays well together.  ZFS is a COW... no not MOO, but Copy On Write.  The more you give it, the better it runs.  2 - 512GB sata 3 SSD's with 64GB of 1333 memory... and its gonna blister.  Put those satas into the RAIDZ+2 disk groups you build on the 4x platters.  Remember one is type 2, so call that Tier 2.  The type 3 is Tier 1.  Get faster disks for Tier 1 :)  Add in some fans.  The asrock has lots of fan control.  Might as well get them now, and set it up right.  As for power... using 64gb 1333, 4 - 2tb drives, 6 - 5tb drives, asrock 2750, rocketraid 20Gb/s USB3 quad (needs a 4x pci, and some shuffling to get the driver loaded... but gives you 4 full USB3 channels, and 2 16gb UBS sticks.. oh yes, 2 512GB sata3 SSD's..  Total peak draw is 68 watts, idles around 8.  and average is 40ish.    I laid my disks out so each RaidZ+2 is 4 drives + 1 SSD, the last two 5TB drives are mirrored with no l2cache.  The slowest disk group is for archives.  The next raidZ is for media (turn compression off), and the mirrors are for high state change, like sabnzbd, torrents, downloads, etc.    Babble babble... remember here, forget about raid o,1, 5, etc... Use RaidZ+2.  you can take a 2 disk hit in a group of 4... and live.    Just to drive you mad as well... I finished just last night.. a new build thats faster, slimmer, tighter.. Using a Tegra K1 SoC with just 4+1 cores... and a pad of 192 CUDA cores.  One thing those atom's do poorly, the kinda math ZFS is doing constantly.  And those Tegras only use 10 watts... but ill leave that a mystery until later."
DataHoarder,36afld,clickwir,1 point,Sun May 17 21:27:43 2015 UTC,"While I am thinking about it... Those external drive cabs.  Before you start deploying jails and modules like sab, couchpotato, sickbeard, etc... Ponder instead setting up vlans to seperate NAS/NFS/etc traffic.  Then stick ARM SBC's into a cabinet, put two ethernet drops in with it.  stick one to the storage vlan, the other to your normal network, and run services on them.  Why?  Cause the jails are expensive in resources.  And they can cause stability issues when you bounce/vary one.  The way freebsd does the carving, ZFS has to settle for less.  And you know how well ZFS likes to settle for less.  :)  an A20 ARM at 1 ghz with 1 gb of memory with linaro can pull 9 to 10 MB/s off my FiOS using sabnzbd."

For the SSD, what size SSDs are you using to include them in Raidz2?  I feel like I have a fundamental misunderstanding on how they work in that situation.  Raid z2 is getting a LOT of recommendations right now, but I'm worried about sacrificing another 4 tb of potential storage this way.  You're build sounds awesome from what you're hinting at, I'm just worried that it's starting to be a bit much for the base storage and PLEX that I need for."

I put high transaction load on 2x5.  Sabnzbd, nfs, timemachine, afs, home.    I put movies on 4x5Z2.  The movie is moved after all processing is complete.  And for me, music and books atre on the last 4x2Z2 set.  Processing on the mirrored pool allows me to populate the zfs pools with sequential pushes oif $size_of_movie chunks.    To improve io speeds, the ssd's are added to each RaidZ as a cache volume.  Make sense?  all that tiny io from huge numbers of threads.. torrents, usenet, etc... is queued and processed on mirrored disks, its fastest, blocks the least IO, and allows the final dataset to be staged so it reads back fast."
