Other than that, things are weird.  I'm moving out to Chicago in less than a month for grad school, which is surreal, but things at home have been bad.  My grandma has had cancer for a long time, and has beaten two very aggressive forms as of now.  However, the most recent kind, which was in her lymph nodes in her kidneys and liver has moved into her blood, and mutated to look like Leukemia.  It's apparently very rare, and it's taking its toll.  It's a big deal for me because I was raised by my grandparents, so it's tough to go through knowing I may have to fly back out almost immediately for a funeral.  But that's life!

I've been home for about 5 days this whole summer--only about 3 if you don't count days where I'm only home about 5 hours or less.  Probably no more than 15 days since Winter Break if you don't count my dorm as home.  And thank you man!

cigars,3e0nc3,porquejorge,2,Tue Jul 21 16:12:33 2015 UTC,You can do all that but it's probably easier in the long run to just let it go out and toss the rest when it's cold. Put it in water it gets soggy and falls apart. Crush it like a cigarette it falls apart. Keep in mind that throwing anything on the ground is littering.
cigars,3e0nc3,buffalo294,2,Tue Jul 21 03:07:02 2015 UTC,"Put in water till gets soggy and falls apart. Do this to a few cigars.

I'd feel bad taking advantage of free shipping just to order one cigar, but if you put a bunch of singles together, it'd probably be worth it to them.

Over time the humidity will drop however. I would stick a few Boveda in there and be done with it.   Better cigars can be had. The Monte Platinum, for me at least, is a good looking cigar with a flat and boring flavor flavor profile. Basically it is a really pretty package with nothing inside it."

cigars,3e1dbn,Cyberya,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:39:30 2015 UTC,My answer is always Bovedas. 1 for the first 50 and one addition for the next 50-75 in your humi... I keep my boxes around 68 and this method is perfect for me

I love the fact there are different flavors on the draw, finish, and retrohale..makes it a very entertaining smoke.  The 2014 didn't really thrill me at first but began to grow on me over time.  They are two completely different cigars by design though so it's pretty much a moot point to compare.  I will happily say they are the 2 best cigars they've released to date (among those i've smoked...which is pretty much every one except Mule Kicks)."

If you want more of the 2014 blend then buy some of the new line (I think..) called La Imperiosa that's based off of/is the LC 2014 blend
cigars,3e0l31,Immortalmortician,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:12:11 2015 UTC,It is the same blend indeed!
cigars,3e0l31,Adam_hooven,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:13:55 2015 UTC,I thought so! I'll have to snag a couple when they come out so I can compare them to the 2015s

The 2014 blend is going to be a regular production stick now (can't remember the new name for it EDIT- just read it a few comments down by /u/adam_hooven, it's La Imperiosa), so maybe check that out at a favourable price point to compare."
cigars,3e0l31,BigNikiStyle,2,Tue Jul 21 01:32:10 2015 UTC,I'm so excited about the fact that the 2014 is becoming a regular production stick! It appears it's going to be slightly cheaper than the 2014 was.

I've only had 2 from 2015, both from a 5er of LC46, and they were good, but not great.  I've yet to dip into my box of LC50.  I'm sure they'll be good, too.

cigars,3e0zoi,Raging_Buffalo,2,Tue Jul 21 03:04:50 2015 UTC,"I only did the calculations based of external dimensions of the 181e of 14x19x25 which gave me just over 3.5cu/ft and bead requirements of 12oz. Internal dimensions just smaller and it should mean about 3cu/ft and only 8oz needed. Of course many people double that to be sure, so to answer your question, yes, 16oz is enough. I have about 20oz in my 281e, and it's plenty.   Some say an extra fan is worth it, I tend to agree. I have one in mine I made from an old cigar box with a low rpm computer fan. Throw the beads inside the box and you're not wasting any space. I have it plugged into a 12v adapter I got on amazon.   For drawers is use iris hobby containers. So I won't be any help there.   Welcome to the wineador life."

I don't think you'd need one in the 181E.  I'd recommend waiting on the fan until you've set it up and the humidity has stabilized to see if it is even needed."

cigars,3e0zoi,tonyled,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:38:56 2015 UTC,I don't have any experience here but I had a question about your statement regarding spanish cedar imparting cedar flavor to cigars. I thought the reason you use spanish cedar as opposed to regular cedar was because it wouldn't impart odor. Is this not the case?
cigars,3e0zoi,StrayingMind,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:39:21 2015 UTC,I have a 281e with two cpu fans in the bottom blowing 24/7.  I have a couple of pounds of kitty litter in a media bag at the bottom under the false drawer.  I keep a few 65% bovedas in the bottom drawer but for the most part I don't tend to need to do anything to it and I have the same RH top and bottom.  Took a good while for everything to even out but now its rock solid

cigars,3e18bv,Confections,3,Tue Jul 21 04:59:45 2015 UTC,You also might want to check out the Foundry Chillin' Moose. Not bad for a cheap cigar.
cigars,3e18bv,Slamfrankel,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:06:42 2015 UTC,I can't really help you out with the cheap smokes but if you have the funds you can invest in a tupperdor which can easily hold 50 sticks. Read this Okay if that is too big or not easy to hide you can buy a traveldor 15ct. These are perfect for having your sticks always on the go. You can easily fit 20 med size cigars if you take the foam out. Buy some boveda 65 and you should be good to go. If you have any more questions pm me. I'm still brand new at this but I am in somewhat of a similliar situation as you.

But the pipes and cigars bother them. Someone on this sub or on /r/pipetobacco said something along these lines and i repeated it to my parents and they kind of understood. I'm heavily paraphrasing btw ""being a cigarette smoker is like being a full blown alcoholic but smoking a pipe or cigar here and there is kind of like have a glass of wine with dinner."" Its a relaxing luxury not a damaging addiction. As long as you smoke in moderation ofcourse. And as far as cheap sticks. Arturo Fuente Curly Head Deluxe is pretty good. You can also get a 5 pack of Tatuaje Havana Rubustos for under $18 right now on Pipes&Cigars :) awesome cigar!!"

cigars,3e16l3,ChiefCrazyHorse,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:06:43 2015 UTC,Water is better for seasoning as it has a faster rate of evaporation and absorbtion. Use distilled water to avoid mold and other nasties. And you're absolutely right; wiping is terrible (when it comes to humidors anyway).

Write down the flavors you note and like, and go back after you've smoked them all. Talk to 'em again or maybe go in on your own if you're confident enough. Maybe all of the ones you liked were maduro. Buy a few maduros and smoke them. Keep at this until your palette is strong and you know what you like. :)  Just my 2¢.

cigars,3e0kys,crackofdawn,2,Tue Jul 21 01:32:11 2015 UTC,"Cigar going out is almost always either overhumidified or you're smoking too slow.  They also go out a LOT faster when there is no ash on the end (e.g. right after the ash falls off).  If you made it most of the way through the cigar without issues then it's not a humidification issue, so likely you're just not smoking it fast enough.  Most of the time when you're near the end you'll find you have to puff a bit more often to keep it lit properly."

Being a newer smoker, which I assume you are, there is a draw to get a bunch of smokes for cheap.

They well set you up with probably half the number of sticks, but will be much more enjoyable.  TRUST ME"

The Reserva Especial you have is indeed a flower band from pre-2008. If you were to check out the box they came in, you could know what year it was from.  R=1  E=2  P=3  U=4  B=5  L=6  I=7  C=8  A=9  S=0  Is the box code.... code. You will see something like:  (SB/SI) which means 05/07 or May of 2007.    The 1994 you saw was produced in late 2014 when the 1994 series was released to commemorate the 20th anniversary of LFD. These bands feature a more colorful band and are more modern where the old flower bands look a little washed out.  Here is a side by side comparison of a 1994, Flower Band Double Ligero 660, Flower Band Ligero Torpedo from 10/07, and a current production Double Ligero    There is an entire history of LFD flower bands. There are a few other users here that know a lot about the flower bands.   Let me know if you have any other questions. I love spreading LFD knowledge"

If you are still at the shop, do yourself a favor and pick up a 1994. It's on my top 5 list and for good reasons. Way more complex than the Double Ligero or Reserva Especial line."

It's the environment, including where you are and, more importantly, who you're with. Smoking alone might be the best way to smoke for someone (sometimes for me it is), or maybe with a best friend or an SO.  I say focus on that aspect and the cigar will be perfect. :)"

cigars,3dxxpe,Dhpayne,3,Mon Jul 20 13:17:31 2015 UTC,"All of the above?  Just kidding.  I don't have a coolerdor.  I do have a wineador, a tupperdor, and a desktop humi though all in use at the moment though.  I don't have any pics at the moment, but I can put up some later.    I started with the desktop humi, and the very shortly outgrew that and had to get a few tupperware containers.  I still use the desktop today for rare and CC sticks (and use Boveda packs in there).  Finally, after I had about 7-8 full tupperware containers, I got an Iris watertight container and was very pleased with that.  I switched from Bovedas to Kitty Litter for the big tupperdor.    The gods shed some light on me one day and my wife told me to buy a wine cooler, just so that she wouldn't have to look at my cigars anymore.  I immediately ordered the 28 bottle new air cooler.  I ordered off of air-n-water because they had some sale going on.  I also picked up some of these trays so use in the wine cooler, until I can order some custom shelves.  They fit perfectly, and hold a TON of cigars in each tray.  I also use KL for the wineador."

cigars,3dxxpe,shadowbates,2,Mon Jul 20 13:58:49 2015 UTC,"I really love my my tupperdor. Those pictures are from when I was originally setting it up so ignore the lack of sticks. To me if you get the right tupperware container, then a tupperdor is almost absolutely fool-proof. I now keep 3 65% bovedas in there with roughly 100 sticks and I can't say that I remember my RH ever deviating more than 1-2%. It took a bit to season it, but I also wasn't in a hurry to season it, so I just threw in those humidity tubes for about a week.   That is the 16 qt sterilite from target which makes just around $7-8, which means not only is it fool-proof, but it is crazy cheap as well. I thought about getting a cooler to do something similar but it was just a bit to large and bulky for my small apartment. I am able to fit this in the drawer of my lateral style filing cabinet. That way it stays out of direct sunlight, and I am not always tripping over it."

Now I see you playing a Hofner. What goes into your decision making process when deciding which bass to play (assuming all are in working order)?
cigars,3dwik1,hiusmax,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:22:46 2015 UTC,"I actually have twelve basses, and eight six-string guitars.  I collect guitars like I collect cigars.  My decision process usually is ""What bass did the original bassist play on this song...?"" and I try to play the same bass if I have it.  I bought this Hofner bass to play Beatles songs in my electric band, and when I started playing with this acoustic offshoot, I was using my Kramer Ferington Acoustic Electric bass. I was having some feedback problems with the hollow body bass and open sound hole, and one of the guitarists just didn't like the way it sounded (too much fret noise).  So I figured, well, the Hofner is hollow bodied, so if I'm not going to play my true acoustic, then I guess a hollow body electric is the next best thing."

I've heard that Altadis/Spanish stock has become somewhat suspect.  I could see fuck ups in the packaging department as demand to move cigars can fall victim to supplies at hand.  Habanos vs Cohiba hinges?  I've seen both as well.  My Genios came out of an LCDH several years back and have the Habanos hinges.  If you recall the 1966 release, the outer box was oversized for the wooden box.  A last minute fuckup.  As for the vendors, CoH is pretty solid.  With that said, there are some ugly looking cigars coming out of Cuba these days.  Some vendors turn them back by the mastercase if not satisfied.  My buddy works at the Montreal LCDH and had to send back a few boxes of PSD4's with practically Candella wrappers!    Did you do a serial # verification check?    Go here."

So, why wouldn't they make even the slightest attempt to remove this very obvious evidence that someone at Altadis in Spain is breaking the distribution chain...

cigars,3dvajp,Simmion,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:21:46 2015 UTC,I got them from COH
cigars,3dvajp,quaestorm,2,Sun Jul 19 23:06:25 2015 UTC,"Well they are certainly a reputable source, but I am surprised by how poor they look. As for the hinges question, I believe it's normal to say 'Habanos' on these boxes"
cigars,3dvajp,Gambitzz,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:07:57 2015 UTC,"I have only seen one with Cohiba,  thus me asking. If you have seen a real one with Habanos then I am happy :)"

cigars,3dvajp,OverlordQ,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:11:42 2015 UTC,The box of secretos we have in store has cohiba on the hinges.  (Box comes from our distributor) Habanos sounds weird to me since they are only the distributor/partial owner and not the manufacturer.
cigars,3dvajp,OverlordQ,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:51:05 2015 UTC,Ask for them sealed or inspected?
cigars,3dvajp,KG89,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:32:33 2015 UTC,I asked for sealed and it was. I broke them myself.
cigars,3dvajp,KG89,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:19:02 2015 UTC,I usually go inspected. Saves me the headache and I trust the source.
cigars,3dvajp,MamaXerxes,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:17:47 2015 UTC,What is the box code?

cigars,3dvh3h,HardcoreBlofish,4,Sun Jul 19 21:31:32 2015 UTC,"From my experience there are 2 good websites that ship to Canada: Absolute Cigars and Atlantic Cigars. I prefer Absolute because their shipping is cheaper ($10-15 instead of $30) and while their selection is less if you do want a cigar that they do not have send them an email and they will get it for you. Also, their customer service is amazing."
cigars,3dvh3h,ThePats,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:47:36 2015 UTC,"Does absolutecigars ship canadian ""friendly""? Ie not necessarily labelling the shipment as cigars?"
cigars,3dvh3h,sudzy40,3,Mon Jul 20 00:51:33 2015 UTC,Yes they do. Even in their FAQ they say if you get charged with duty you can refuse the package and send it back and they will refund you 100% including shipping.
cigars,3dvh3h,ThePats,2,Mon Jul 20 01:01:04 2015 UTC,"Very cool, I will be checking them out. Thanks"

cigars,3dvh3h,TooGoodMan,3,Mon Jul 20 12:52:30 2015 UTC,"Theres cigarchief as well if you want to go that route. I visited their brick and mortar on the reserve and pick up a ss for 13 bucks. Not the best deal, but no customs risk and drastically cheaper than non-reserve prices. They have an online store as well as a brick and mortar about 2 hours northeast of Toronto."
cigars,3dvh3h,jimmi114,2,Mon Jul 20 02:00:32 2015 UTC,"I've used their online store. I would say they are the cheapest way to buy cigars inside ontario. Also, you don't pay tax because it is on a reserve. One of the best options in ontario if you don't want to risk shipping from America."
cigars,3dvh3h,MojoMojoMojo,2,Mon Jul 20 02:12:14 2015 UTC,"Im from Toronto too and i know what it feels like. Are you looking to buy singles or box?  I ordered a box just recently from small batch, and I think their shipping is $25. However, you gotta be aware there may be insane custom fees if you get hit. I looked around and I think Atlantic has pretty good prices for boxes.  If you're planning to do singles, maybe some of the members here would be able to assist with proxy shipping or something. I joined in on a cotm order and one of the guys will be shipping me 12 sticks for like $15."
cigars,3dvh3h,Lostinwords,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:17:31 2015 UTC,"Ya I'm new to the hobby, so at first I didn't realise how insane the in-store prices were. But today I picked up a Hemingway Short Story for >20 bucks, and when I got home and read a review I realised they're $6 sticks.  Probably a bit of both singles and boxes. I have a few favourites picked out that I would like to get boxes of, but of course being new I still want to taste a little of everything. Thanks for the help! Appreciate it."
cigars,3dvh3h,Canuck1stan,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:12:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah man, I did same thing, wanted to pick up some Undercrown's but at $27-30 I never did but then realized the prices in states so much cheaper, I suggest posting in /r/cigarmarket if looking for anything in partickler I purchased a great sampler from a member, so buying through a proxy member from this sub is probably cheapest otherwise will have to go online stores. I know some let you decide how to label the box others just say cigars,  so customs could tag ya hard with taxes"
cigars,3dvh3h,I_M_A_Monster,2,Sun Jul 19 23:30:25 2015 UTC,I order all of my Cigars from the states. I travel enough to bring them back with me a few times a year though. Strategically buy when going on trips.

There are a few different price points as well, Andrew is pretty accommodating regardless"

I in general enjoy toro sized sticks, but am pretty flexible on that.  I usually norm around 54 ring gauge.  As for flavor profile, I've been trending more towards more creamy and mild as of late, but my base is peppery, woodsy strong cigars."

cigars,3dvthq,guitarmatt,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:40:20 2015 UTC,"A six pack of each, or more, depending on what you can safely ship. I doubt you'll find Heady Topper there, but if you grab 2 6 packs of Blind Pig, that would be great. I would take a case, but don't want to overburden you."
cigars,3dul1z,Jonesyy95,5,Sun Jul 19 17:00:21 2015 UTC,You shouldn't have to unless your complex has some kind of policy that doesn't allow them to leave packages in your mailbox/doorstep. Otherwise you just have to worry about people jacking your package.

cigars,3dul1z,nonimurmur,3,Sun Jul 19 22:16:36 2015 UTC,"I've ordered from Famous a couple times and didn't have to sign for the package. I've noticed that some websites say you'll have to sign for the package, but I've never had to sign for a package from an online cigar order.  Worst case scenario, if you do have to sign for it and aren't around, you can just pick it up at the PO the next day."

cigars,3dul1z,kershaw828,2,Sun Jul 19 23:09:46 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure about the signing on cigars. (I don't think you have to). But I work in our student post office at my school as a work study, and at least what we do is the school signs for it and then you have to sign for it from the school. Don't know if that's the case at your school, but it seems unlikely that a school expects you to be at the post office.  If you don't live on campus though and have a private address completely disregard all of that."

Their selection isn't good and their humidity is usually off - sometimes there's standing water on the floor of the humidor. Please don't go there hoping to buy cigars. Late night smoking? Totally the place for that. But not buying sticks."

Since he's flying me in I don't want to be rude and say that I'm going to ditch him and hang out with some, albeit incredibly awesome, redditors whom I have never met IRL.

I would love to deprecate my spreadsheets for this app.  These would be the features I need to do that:   Sorting/Filtering/Searching - Sounds like you are already working on this, great! iPad support - I'm sure this will come once you finish the core functionality of the app. Adding ratings for cigars we've already smoked - I have a bunch of data I want to enter about cigars I already have notes on.  Right now the process to just give a star rating is: click smoke this cigar, set a time, start timer, add notes, cancel the note, stop the timer, set the rating.  I should be able to just edit a cigar and add existing notes.  (perhaps I missed how to do this better?)   All in all, awesome start!  With the above additions, this would be an app I'd pay for."
cigars,3dt2bz,rumessingwitme,2,Sun Jul 19 17:43:09 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the feedback, I definitely need to add the edit rating per cigar instead of session only. And yes, iPad and filtering support will be added for launch. Thank you!"

I am getting a slight chemical/plastic flavor, and I can't get past it.  It probably hasn't rested enough (6 days).  I am also pairing it with a Mexican beer (Sol), that could be hurting it a bit.  I have another, and will let it sit a few months before burning it."
cigars,3dspdc,mmayhew,2,Sun Jul 19 02:40:12 2015 UTC,"Aw man, sorry to hear that. While I can say that the chemical plastic flavor is not something I picked up at all, everybody has a different palate. That said, I hope the second one redeems itself for ya"

cigars,3dslqd,jusdifferent,2,Sun Jul 19 02:03:37 2015 UTC,Its a 100 ct and i average about 50 in there. I use 69% boveda packs  with a humi care gel bead thing
cigars,3dslqd,jusdifferent,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:05:13 2015 UTC,"Is your hygrometer digital? The analog ones can be inaccurate.   This is a personal preference of mine, but at that size, I'd use multiple Boveda packs.   It sounds like the cigars may be the culprit, though. It should bounce back soon, I would imagine."
cigars,3dslqd,jusdifferent,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:09:23 2015 UTC,"I use a digital, and i have 3 boveda packs"
cigars,3dslqd,jusdifferent,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:10:04 2015 UTC,"Oh, in that case, I'd say it should come back up soon.   Only 2 things I'll add that goes without saying that you probably have under control already:  Make sure Bovedas are not drying out and charged up  Also make sure the beads aren't hurting the Bovedas by sucking in humidity"
cigars,3dslqd,uttercub,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:16:55 2015 UTC,It may also be that my hydrometer bugged out. I just did the salt test and it gave me a low reading so i ordered two more.

cigars,3dscf9,Midlifehippo,2,Sun Jul 19 04:04:02 2015 UTC,"I'd add another one or two just to be safe if you're going to be adding more cigars. And you need to take them out of the plastic, they won't work otherwise. Make sure to pick up a digital hygrometer as well to know the exact RH"
cigars,3dscf9,HighlyAmatuerExpert,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:11:24 2015 UTC,"I am hearing so many mixed answers about the plastic issue! I see tons of videos on line and pics on here of peoples humidors and in half of them, the cigars are in plastic. I guess i will take your word and ditch the plastic"
cigars,3dscf9,Midlifehippo,2,Sun Jul 19 00:39:08 2015 UTC,"I think he was referring to the plastic on the Boveda, not the cigars."
cigars,3dscf9,Midlifehippo,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:44:31 2015 UTC,"I was haha, my mistake"
cigars,3dscf9,DrGearheart,2,Sun Jul 19 00:48:21 2015 UTC,"Whoops! I thought you meant on the boveda packs haha. My bad.  As for the cigars, keeping it on provides some extra protection against damage when moving them around, and some say that it can help the RH stay steady when the humidor fluctuates.  Taking it off can help aging I've heard. It's all down to personal preference. For me, if it comes in celo, I keep it in celo."
cigars,3dscf9,C-Ray6,2,Sun Jul 19 00:47:23 2015 UTC,"also, as a side note, when you take the celo off, it allows all the flavors to mingle and makes for different flavors if you have multiple cigars in your humidor (or whatever you have your cigars in).  But, it is all a matter of preference"
cigars,3dscf9,dfafjf,2,Sun Jul 19 03:39:48 2015 UTC,"Hi man, are they the little Boveda packets I sent you, or the full sized ones (roughly 4""x2"")? You'll want a full size one for a tupperdor (tupperware container).. I would stay cheap and start out with one of those for storage to start, they do a fantastic job. Just make sure it has a good seal. The boveda packets should be available at most smoke shops for cheap. And in tupperware, 1 large pack will easily maintain 25 to 50 sticks.  As others mentioned, 2 would be ideal and would last a great deal of time without ""recharging"". The boveda packs if new come in plastic be sure to remove it before use. The plastic/cellophane on your cigars you can leave on. I also have a metric ton of 69% boveda packets so there is that :)"
cigars,3dscf9,Twisted_Einstein,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:03:36 2015 UTC,I could be completely wrong as I'm also pretty new but I have heard that the large boveda packs are good for around 50 cigars.  Please correct me if I'm wrong.
cigars,3dscf9,dfafjf,2,Sun Jul 19 00:12:01 2015 UTC,Most will say 1 per 25. Better safe than dry!
cigars,3dscf9,Twisted_Einstein,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:15:41 2015 UTC,I thought that was for the smaller packs but again don't listen to this noob.  I will watch this thread though as I might need to add another to my box.
cigars,3dscf9,jusdifferent,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:17:38 2015 UTC,"If you have a good seal, shouldn't be a huge issue. I keep mine on top of my cigars so I can give it a squeeze every time I'm in there. So if you're paying them attention, no big deal. If you're only checking them twice a month, then add more for security."
cigars,3dscf9,uttercub,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:24:36 2015 UTC,"You have to take the Bovedas out of the plastic.   Get 1 or 2 more Bovedas. Better safe than sorry. Even if the average cost of cigars came out to a low $5 a stick. at 30-40 sticks, you're looking at $150 to $200 worth of cigars and that's on the low end. Bovedas are $4 a pop, I'd get more and stay safe.   Also, get a digital hygrometer to know for sure."
cigars,3dscf9,uttercub,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:07:00 2015 UTC,Boveda advises one pouch per 25 sticks. So 100 sticks requires 4 pouches.

cigars,3dsyqg,Yoshi9031,2,Sun Jul 19 03:56:39 2015 UTC,Not everyone uses wood humidors. I do have 2 that are not being used currently.   3 wineadors running for about  a year now. 3 tuppadors for a bit less than a year. The collection  exploded and  it was making more sense to go big but obviously  not big enough  if we have 6. Haha.
cigars,3dsyqg,provocajade,2,Sun Jul 19 17:37:31 2015 UTC,"But if you get a mold or beetle outbreak, then it will be confined to one of six."
cigars,3dsyqg,theonlybluecow,2,Mon Jul 20 00:06:11 2015 UTC,I suppose but a outbreak  that could wipe out  the amount I have is very unlikely. Humidity  kept low. Cool enough that the beetle issue has been low incidence .   Were gonna consolidate  some actually  into large cabinets and keep the HTF singles in the wineadors.
cigars,3dsyqg,provocajade,2,Mon Jul 20 01:52:05 2015 UTC,I've had my current wood humidor for about 8 years now. It's had some of the same cigars in it that whole time. Still works well. I don't think it'll stop working well anytime soon.

cigars,3drdcg,MidwestDrummer,2,Sat Jul 18 20:38:50 2015 UTC,"According to Boveda, yes, it is!"
cigars,3drdcg,C4SUAL,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:28:16 2015 UTC,"I've heard that it if you can avoid it you should, because Boveda's are two way humidity meaning they take in humidity as well as releasing it. So if its directly on top of your sticks it could take humidity out of them. Idk how true that is but I just put the boveda on the side anyways."
cigars,3drdcg,C4SUAL,4,Sat Jul 18 18:51:22 2015 UTC,"So, it will do its job? And keep humidity at a specific level?   The only thing I'd worry about would be leaking the salts onto the cigars. But that won't happen unless you've refreshed them too far and they've exploded or there's a hole in them. But I'm guessing you'd see that before you put them in with cigars."

cigars,3dqzcl,LumpenBourgeoise,3,Sat Jul 18 16:44:18 2015 UTC,"In addition to the boveda pack and calibration kit, i would highly recommend you get a digital hygrometer. Perhaps an adjustable hygroset one from one of the online stores. That way you should be able to tell relatively accurately what the humidity is.  With wooden humidors the issue is with how long the wood will take to absorb the water, so the wood was likely draining it from your cigars. What you want is for it to hold slightly above what you want your RH to be so that it can very quickly replenish and hold the humidity whenever you open it up instead of from your cigars.  Consider bringing them up slowly. Whats their condition now? Do they crackle when squeezed lightly? Do they look very dried out or do they still retain an oily sheen?"
cigars,3dqzcl,tacforce,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:25:13 2015 UTC,"They crackle when squeezed, but some a lot more than others. They do mostly have a sheen. The older Cubans which were at the bottom of the box look best, the newer cigars from the drew estate sampler, which have been on the top, are drier. I'm starting to think I over-reacted, I was surprised by how much water the whole system absorbed and don't want the cigars to get a shock from it."
cigars,3dqzcl,tacforce,2,Sat Jul 18 19:02:49 2015 UTC,"Take your time seasoning the humidor, you want it to be able to act as a good buffer if your humidifying agent gets too dry. I wouldnt be too worried about them but I would still give them a good while to get to the proper humidity. Try to check the seal on the humidor as well if possible."
cigars,3dqzcl,db00,2,Sat Jul 18 20:04:13 2015 UTC,You should immediately order a Boveda bag to throw your cigars in. Get a 65% pack (or whatever you want to keep them at) and toss it in with the cigars. Then get the Boveda seasoning pack. Keep your sticks in the bag while you season your humidor which takes about two weeks. I think you're going to ruin your cigars by trying to season it with them in there and you probably won't be able to achieve a proper seasoning of the humidor.

cigars,3dr01a,Renhik,7,Sat Jul 18 16:50:13 2015 UTC,Being new I wouldn't get too set on brands and simply try a lot of things! A brand someone else might not enjoy could be one of your favorites. Also realize that your preferences will change as you continue to smoke so don't be too surprised if down the road you revisit a cigar and don't enjoy it as much.

Also I hate going into a cigar shop lookin like a fool. How do you know if a cigar is good? Also what do you recommend that isn't too heavy of a flavor. What brands don't break the bank but are still awesome, being in college is a struggle"
cigars,3dpxzf,guerochuleta,2,Sat Jul 18 11:46:14 2015 UTC,"I am going to answer anictdotaly first, and say the best cigar is the one you're smiking and like.  Now, to your specific questions.  First addressing cost which helps other descisions.  First, please remember an expensive cigar is not necessarily a good cigar and an inexpensive one not automatically bad.  There are many sub $10 and sub $5 cigars that are worth smoking.  Dominican Big Leaguer is one that has many fine cigars in the $4-$8 range that I smoke frequently.  Others are Perdomo fresh rolled at $3 a peice, some sizes of Est.1844 by AJ at around $4 and the American Legion at $4-$6.  Choosing the right cigar is a matter of experimentation, finding what wrapper you like, what country you like Dominican (mild and mild-medium), Nica or Honduran Mild to full.  If you can find an event that you pay a fee and get cigars from manufacturers, save and do it, it lets you sample a lot of cigars.  A good cigar is again what you like, but it should be solid, but not hard, smell nice, and burn and draw well.    Last I will say if a cigar shop thinks you look like a fool because you need help and don't know all about cigars, I say it is time to fire that shop and find a new one.  I am serious into this hobby but know about 25% of it, and that is a metric shit tonne!!!  I find myself smoking new cigars that have been around forever and I knew nothing about them.  Relax, experiment, and enjoy....and keep asking questions.  Please exuse any spelling and format issues, I am onsite at IPCPR, on mobile and wifi.  Long ashes my friend!"
cigars,3dpqjx,Slamfrankel,3,Sat Jul 18 06:38:37 2015 UTC,"Pricewise from what I've seen they're all pretty similar.  O and V are both great cigars, V in my experience tends to be more intense and spicy/peppery.  O, again just in my experience, tends to be a little more subtle, but something about the flavor of the O, I think it's the wrapper, just blows me away.  I've never had an Oliva G, so I can't speak to that, but they're cheap, so try them for yourself and see!  Edit: Right after I submitted that I remembered it wasn't the Oliva O I was thinking of, it's the O Maduro.  That's the one with the killer wrapper."
cigars,3dpqjx,pastafarian_brewer,4,Sat Jul 18 07:13:59 2015 UTC,"I am going to agree with you on all these points. O maduro is one of my favorite cigars. Vs are very strong and hard hitting, but still good if that's what you're in the mood for. Gs I've seen as hit or miss. They're not as good as the others in my opinion, and I treat a G as a good go to for walking the dog or mowing the lawn. I have had some bad ones before. I was walking down the street to a buddies house and the thing just fell apart. Only happened that one time though and it was very strange.   Overall Olivia is easily my favorite brand, as they have such a wide range of sticks. Just got married and my buddy got me a box of O maduros and scotch. Can't wait to light one when I get back from Hawaii."
cigars,3dpqjx,Bobbers927,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:34:39 2015 UTC,"Sadly my only experience with the O Maduro was very poor. I had a though time getting a good cut (my clippers were being deflected to the side) and couldn't get a decent draw going. I finally gave up not even halfway through and pulled the cigar apart and found 5 thick chunks of stem blocking up the majority of the stick. Several of which appeared to have run through the whole cigar. One of them even had  smaller stems branching off of it. It shouldn't have even been sold as a second or overrun. Honestly, I know it's likely one of the statistical occurrences that QC happens to miss ones like that now and again, but I just haven't been able to bring myself grab another yet."

cigars,3dpapl,jgrchrstn,2,Sat Jul 18 04:17:39 2015 UTC,It's such a strong flavor. I haven't had another cigar that had such a powerful profile.

cigars,3dpa5g,Mr_Green26,3,Sat Jul 18 03:34:58 2015 UTC,"Some of the CAO Flavors are fantastic. I haven't had this yet, what's the flavor profile?"
cigars,3dpa5g,philo-sopher,3,Sat Jul 18 14:18:02 2015 UTC,Its a very smooth Cameroon wrapper over a DR filler and flavored with cinnamon and whisky. I only had the cigarillo so I didn't get to much flavor depth wise but the cinnamon was light enough to not to be a distraction or over powering and it was not too sweet to put me off of it.
cigars,3dpa5g,philo-sopher,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:41:47 2015 UTC,That sounds very interesting. I might have to look for that one. I like infused for a little treat occasionally. Thanks for the info!
cigars,3dpa5g,catsdoinit,2,Sat Jul 18 20:11:26 2015 UTC,"CAO flavours are what really grabbed my attention when I first started smoking. Now I vape, so if I want to smoke something that tastes like coffee and Irish cream, I can do it all day...  Alternatively, I recently found a juice that made with real tobacco and it rocks my socks off."
cigars,3dpa5g,philo-sopher,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:53:34 2015 UTC,That makes sense. A lot of people came into cigars through flavored and infused ones. I can also see how the vaping replaces it.   I have heard of infusing juice with tobacco. It works really well with pipe tobacco from what I've heard.

cigars,3dovtl,MD82,6,Sat Jul 18 01:19:34 2015 UTC,Drew Estate Egg Maduro.  I set out to nub it and gave up quickly.  One of the worst I've had.
cigars,3dovtl,DenverTele,3,Sat Jul 18 01:23:19 2015 UTC,That's the funny looking one right?
cigars,3dovtl,DenverTele,2,Sat Jul 18 01:24:03 2015 UTC,That's the one.  I'm thankful it was given to me but wouldn't recomend it...it's not worth the LOLZ.
cigars,3dovtl,DenverTele,2,Sat Jul 18 01:25:49 2015 UTC,What made you not like it? Just curious because I have always wanted to try it out.
cigars,3dovtl,UncleS1am,3,Sat Jul 18 01:29:13 2015 UTC,Taste was terrible and as tge RG gets larger you have to actively puff on it to keep it lit.  It's the cigar equivalent of huffing paint.
cigars,3dovtl,drsfmd,2,Sat Jul 18 03:27:29 2015 UTC,It's the cigar equivalent of huffing paint.   Hahaha! Gonna cross that one off the to-buy-because-fuck-you list. Thanks for the tip.

cigars,3dovtl,HitLines,2,Sat Jul 18 01:22:28 2015 UTC,I've smoked the 7x70 Ogre and thought the same thing. I love the barber pole look though.
cigars,3dovtl,Aedan382,2,Sat Jul 18 01:23:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it looks pretty bad ass actually.  Just tasted of hay and grass and generic smoke.    Give me a corona anytime man."

cigars,3dovtl,Adam_hooven,2,Sat Jul 18 01:51:00 2015 UTC,"Honestly that was one of the best cigars I have ever had, clean easy draw, which was surprising for such a large cigar. And a decent flavor as well."
cigars,3dovtl,Adam_hooven,2,Sat Jul 18 05:27:12 2015 UTC,Dude. Let them sit for a few years. Maybe the nicotine will back off a bit and give you a delicious cigar!
cigars,3dovtl,ThatColoradoPrep,2,Sat Jul 18 15:10:38 2015 UTC,I'll try my best but I may not have the self control to keep myself from smoking them!
cigars,3dovtl,theoneandonlyc,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:20:03 2015 UTC,I love that logic! I have the disgusting habit of dipping tobacco so I've found nicotine from cigars doesn't really effect me.

cigars,3do4gc,uncoordinated,3,Fri Jul 17 21:23:07 2015 UTC,I see it says Diplomat inside the lid....on the bottom what brand is it? I think that may be a Dunhill? If so there are licensed repair shops for them.
cigars,3do4gc,provocajade,2,Fri Jul 17 23:29:46 2015 UTC,Any reason you aren't trying it with butane?  Sounds like you are on the right track.
cigars,3do4gc,Ash_Man,3,Fri Jul 17 21:33:07 2015 UTC,Well in order for it for the butane to even work shouldn't it create a spark even if it doesn't have any?
cigars,3do4gc,Blinky-the-Doormat,2,Fri Jul 17 21:34:25 2015 UTC,"This may be a stretch, but you might want to talk to a watchmaker.  Small, delicate metalwork is typically for jewelers or watchmakers. Since this is a machine, I'd go for a watchmaker.  He or she may just tell you it's bricked, but it's worth a try."
cigars,3do4gc,john41285,2,Fri Jul 17 22:01:13 2015 UTC,Wow good idea! I think I might go this route because I think the lighter might be gold or at least gold plated.
cigars,3do4gc,john41285,2,Fri Jul 17 22:02:31 2015 UTC,There is probably a short in it. I had a battery powered lighter before. It wasn't a very good one and only lasted a few weeks. When it stopped working I took it apart and seen a wire had shorted.

cigars,3dnm3a,jholen,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:29:48 2015 UTC,No real preference. At this point it comes down to mostly finding one and not being too picky about the brand so much. Mostly I'm after the symbolism.

The only ""dud"" was a 1985 Cuban Davidoff Dom Perignon.  It was still a great stick but older, more experience smokers told me it was a light bodied stick when fresh.  So YMMV depending on what you put away.  The only ""Truism"" is to have patience for at least 3-5 years on certain cigars."

cigars,3dn9bs,blottomotto,4,Fri Jul 17 20:26:15 2015 UTC,A couple a week should make no real difference.  What you eat will have a much bigger impact than any other factor when it comes to weight loss. Try r/loseit for some tips.
cigars,3dn9bs,tanstaafl90,3,Fri Jul 17 17:37:00 2015 UTC,I'm a former crossfitter and still work out pretty intensely 5-6 times a week and don't notice any impact.
cigars,3dn9bs,StrayingMind,3,Fri Jul 17 17:38:49 2015 UTC,"I've smoked for years. And for years have completed triathlons, marathons, with plenty of free weights in between. When I am in training mode, I generally use it just like any other part of my diet, in moderation. But I also use it as bit of motivation. Just think of all the good times that tobacco can bring during those long runs.   And if you're not doing that kind of cardio, you should be fine. I can still do daily cardio and daily cigars. I just make sure not to do cardio immediately after, or during, a cigar."

cigars,3dn9bs,d_r0ck,2,Fri Jul 17 19:28:34 2015 UTC,Well that's generous! I Crossfit 4-5 times a week and see no issue when smoking. Really the biggest hit in performance I have seen is drinking. I also do a endurance Crossfit class and again have seen no issues in performance. Other then the smoking and general drinking I eat really well so that helps.

cigars,3dn9bs,blottomotto,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:27:19 2015 UTC,"I only have them on my rest days, which are twice a week when I work at the B&M. My programming entails (in this order) Olympic weightlifting, powerlifting, gymnastics and lifting accessory work and some type of metabolic conditioning (with less of an emphasis than traditional CrossFit) at the tail end. Cigars haven't had any measurable impact on my performance (I'm stronger than ever and still smashing PRs and dusting people for timed workouts even after starting cigars), and there's actually a fair amount of people who I consider incredibly fit at the CrossFit gym that I work out with who smoke cigars.   Another tidbid, my Olympic lifting coach who competes at Junior Nationals told me that cigars were actually pretty popular with a lot of Olympic lifters back in the day."

cigars,3dmmhc,QuadrasaurusFlex,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:11:05 2015 UTC,"I played it on PS4 from launch til about...April? My disc met with an unforutnate accident involving candle wax. The game is a lot of fun, if not extremely grindy. They were having issues with some of the new boss raids being glitchy and broken, but if that doesn't bother you, the core of the game is a hell of a lot of fun."
cigars,3dmmhc,Junk-Punch,4,Fri Jul 17 22:22:33 2015 UTC,"I've been primarily a solo player since the first week. First on XBox 360, then PS4 since Christmas. It has been a ton of fun, for me. It does get grindy, or repetitious, when you're trying to get specific pieces of armor or a weapon to drop, so be prepared for that. Also, as others have said, it is a lot of fun if you can find a group of like minded people to play with. A couple places you can check out are /r/DestinyTheGame, and the best place, IMHO, to find like minded players, is The 100. Just let them know you are new, and a majority of the time they will help you out without giving you too much grief, especially in the casual groups.  I keep saying like minded, because there are a lot of different subsets of players, you just have to find a group that you fit into. Casual vs. Hardcore. Young vs. Old. Some, like me, pretty much just stick to PvE (player vs. environment) content, and only play PvP (player vs. player) when I need to for a bounty. There are those that strictly play PvP, since they aren't happy with what they feel is a lack of end game PvE content. Some do both. Some people only play on Tuesday, when the weekly roll over occurs, so they can do the Nightfall, Weekly Heroic, and maybe do the Raids to try and get a sweet new gun to drop.  If you plan on buying it, there are two expansions that have come out since launch. The Dark Below, and The House of Wolves. Both were fun, but I think the HoW is the better of the two. Both are $20 apiece, or you can buy them packaged for $35. They aren't necessary to play, but they both include some new content that was worth playing for me. TDB added story missions, new weapons and armor, and a raid, albeit a very small, quick raid. HoW also added weapons and armor, The Trials of Osiris, a new PvP option, and The Prison of Elders, a three person round by round based PvE Horde mode.  There is also a demo that you can check out, to see if it feels right to you.  Hopefully this helps a bit, and if you have anymore questions, please feel free to ask."
cigars,3dmmhc,rileystheman,3,Fri Jul 17 17:20:22 2015 UTC,"Long time lurker, but can't help but respond to this post.  I'm an alpha player and I agree with pretty much everything Junk-Punch has to say.  Other things worth mentioning:    It's grindy, yes, but in all actuality the most recent DLC has taken a lot of grind out of the game.  That said, the only real time the grind gets frustrating is when I'm playing solo - if you've got a group of friends who you enjoy playing with, between raids, nightfalls, Prison of Elders and the many PvP options (eeeewww), there really is plenty to do.    If you are someone who has gotten hooked on either MMOs or FPS before, you've got a while to think about it but once you hit level 20 you really should buy the DLCs to quickly jump up to top teir.   The Dark Below gets you up to 32 (recommended level for most end-game content) and House of Wolves will cap you out at 34 pretty quickly.    How much you enjoy it really does depend on your enjoyment of video game genres in general.  If you're not into FPS and/or MMOs, this might not be the game for you.  But if you do enjoy them, or at least are intrigued and you've got friends to play with, give it a try.    If you, or anyone on this thread is interested in buffing your friends list with decent peeps, feel free to add me.  I've got a group of buddies who are experienced, laid back, and always looking to add more fun people to play with.    PSN:  mcboozer"

cigars,3dmmhc,Junk-Punch,2,Fri Jul 17 16:24:54 2015 UTC,"Pretty excited for Battlefront I see. I'm in a holding pattern on that one myself. From what I've seen, it doesn't look like there is a ton of content for that one, either. Maybe that won't matter, and it's going to be awesome no matter the number of maps and classes. I'm just not in the business of pre-ordering/buying day one anymore. I like to wait it out, and see some gameplay first."

CoD has fallen out of my favor.   I liked the battlefields and the battlefronts. I watched a lot of e3 stuff and looks like it has a lot of decent content. Quite a few maps already announced with Free-LC (maps) once the movie happens.   Also has a survival-esk round mode."

Two of the best games I had on PS2. I also preferred the three Battlefield games I had, Bad Company 2, Battlefield's 3 & 4, to any CoD after the first Modern Warefare. They were a ton of fun."
cigars,3dmmhc,Havavege,2,Fri Jul 17 17:42:04 2015 UTC,Bad Company 2 is literally the highlight of ANY FPS for me. I loved that game.

Cigars should be a special thing (in my opinion at least). I'm not saying that you shouldn't smoke a cigar everyday because I smoke one or two about everyday, but I don't think smoking a cigar should be routine, I think it's a ritual that needs to be appreciated and I think a cigar deserves a majority of one's attention. That's just my personal belief though, obviously it's whatever works for you. There's not really any right or wrong answer as to how often is too often."

That being said, I do not believe in over-indulgence and so stick to one at said events. To me they're a complimentary tool, nothing more.  If I were having cigars daily I'd believe I'd been psychosomatically addicted and it'd probably be true. If I was having them weekly for the sole point of it I'd wonder why I placed such value on them if I was making sure to fit them in my schedule and reduce them, and if I were only having them monthly as some special treat I'd wonder if I liked them so much why was I not having them more often and would likewise choose not to have them.

cigars,3di6a5,NLTyrone,2,Thu Jul 16 17:18:34 2015 UTC,"I have that Calibre IV hygrometer and it works great, so I say stick with it.  As for the humidification; those gel things just never worked right for me. Swap them out for 2 Boveda 65% packs.   As long as your bundling some goodies, I would also throw in a Boveda Seasoning Pack to make sure it's seasoned right to hold humidity in the first place. In fact, if you only bundled one thing with your humidor, this is the most important thing to bundle with it. Dummy-proof seasoning will help prevent your beautifully crafted humidor from getting damaged and the seal leaking."
cigars,3di6a5,WildSnorkus,3,Thu Jul 16 19:59:05 2015 UTC,"Beautiful work! I'm sure the finish is even more incredible in person. If I could make one suggestion for future designes, integrate Boveda packs for humidification.  The consensus here on /r/cigars is that Boveda's 2 way humidification pouches are the very best solution for humidification control. They absorb and / or release humidity to keep the RH on target, plus they don't get moldy like the sponge and bead systems.  Boveda makes cedar holders that can be installed into any humidor, but I think you could build one into your humidors quite easily. In a top of the line humidor this is a very nice feature. Keep up the good work!"

cigars,3di6a5,MtnMan813,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:28:52 2015 UTC,Thanks for the suggestion. I was wondering if the divider was too thick. Fun fact: the divider is movable.

The DE team is awesome and I'm sure they would have happily handed a few out if enough people showed interest."
cigars,3diwid,Oneofthebeardguys,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:51:21 2015 UTC,"The barrel time definitely makes the flavor unique. The tobacco is fermenting in the barrels over the course of a year of being buried underground. Definitely makes for a totally awesome, interesting flavor, in my opinion."

As long as the foot is mold free you should be in the clear. If mold is on the foot, it indicates that mold is likely on the inside of the cigar. You can't remove that mold.

In fact, he's one of the finest gentleman to ever grace this inspiration that we call earth. Allow me to tell a small story of my dear friend....  A few years ago, gator and myself were visiting Bangladesh on vacation.  It was a trip that Gator won, by taking first place in Florida's ""thickest wiener"" contest. He asked me to accompany him, because he knew I was a traveled man who understood the culture and language.   While on our trip, I witnessed Gator single handedly put out a burning orphanage, and save 34 children. He was given a key to the city, but politely declined because he didn't want his keyring to get too heavy....you see not only is he physically perfect, but also smart. He knows that it's bad for the starter of your automobile. Automobile is what he calls his car....he's old timey like that.   On our travels throughout the countryside, Gator fathered 8 children.  He's a virile man, who also carries a strong sense of responsibility. He continues to support all of those children , and their mothers.   I could go on for hours about gator....but his tales are such, that you may accuse me of being a story teller...."

cigars,3dima9,Chrisram_7,5,Thu Jul 16 15:56:32 2015 UTC,Welcome!  What kind of advice are you looking for?  Here's some I'd have for your setup: it looks like you're using a foam puck for humidification. I'd ditch that for either beads or bovedas. The pucks can easily breed mold and aren't as good at keeping a steady humidity. I'd also get a digital hygrometer to keep an eye on humidity levels - I don't see one in the pics.  The other advice: get to smoking and enjoying!

cigars,3dima9,carnesy,2,Thu Jul 16 16:13:08 2015 UTC,"Just a heads up, the cello on the cigars do little if anything in keeping their humidity. Most people, myself included, keep it on to prevent damage to the cigar wrappers which may come about from moving them around."

cigars,3dima9,lurker_to_poster,2,Thu Jul 16 21:55:41 2015 UTC,Get a hydrometer to see what your humidity levels are. And get a better humidor asap. I got that same one in a CI sampler combo and no matter what I did I couldn't get it above 52% humidity due to a poor seal.   I grabbed a new humidor this past weekend and it's been sitting at 68% with no problem.
cigars,3dima9,burnmyiz,2,Thu Jul 16 16:53:50 2015 UTC,"I'll look into getting one. And yeah, I figured this humidor wouldn't be all that lol. The CI sampler was pretty inexpensive."

Also, what are you expecting the cigars to be like? Squishy like a sponge? That would be overhumidified.

And they're still moist, not rigid and it doesn't feel like they're rocks in it or anything.  As for the hardness of the cigars, it's almost stick like. There's barely any give at all to them.

cigars,3dhwm9,VanDeLeighIndustries,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:10:23 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice I literally just put these cigars in here, haven't even closed the lid and just finished seasoning this humidor. I was told that 73-75 is ok to put the cigars in after seasoning because they will absorb some of the moisture and drive humidity down. If this is not correct please let me know I am ultra noob with this humidor and I will be sure to keep a close eye on it. Thanks"
cigars,3dhwm9,lurker_to_poster,3,Thu Jul 16 13:29:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's correct.  When you put the sticks in (depending on how they've been kept prior), they should drive down the humidity a little bit.  My best advice would be to experiment with humidity a bit.  Some people like their cigars higher in RH, but most like them around 66-68 range.  Burn issues start to appear when you get into 70+ (not to mention the mold/beetles potential).  If you find that you like a higher RH cigar, then just make sure you keep the temp below 70 degrees.  Good luck, and welcome to /r/cigars!"

I ALWAYS keep the ones that come in cellophane IN the cellophane, because I've had some lumps and bumps damage to some cigars that didn't come in cello.

cigars,3di82l,NLTyrone,7,Thu Jul 16 14:05:41 2015 UTC,"Hmmm. Few things:   Sucks the shop attendant wasn't more helpful. You'll find that every now and then. That's why most people who love their B&M will be quite loyal to them. Demand must be strong enough where he doesn't need to care about the customer service. That or he is used to dealing with people who have much more knowledge. Not that I agree with that as we all have to start out somewhere. It also seems like he doesn't have much knowledge if you asked for a Party Short and he handed you that. B&Ms may overhumidify their stock as people keep opening/closing doors, etc. That way the rH doesn't drop too low. Most people recommend buying sticks from them but letting them rest in a lower rH humidor for a couple weeks to settle before smoking. Smoking something that is overhumidified runs the risk of the stick going out on you which it looks like what might have happened with a portion of the wrapper. How quickly were you smoking? This can also help determine how/why part of the lit portion went out. 1-2 puffs per minute is how I smoke normally and I don't run into many issues, but it still can happen. It's totally fine to relight that area while smoking to keep the burn even. This is very normal. Seems the ""wooden sticks"" you mention are some stems. While more premium sticks should have rollers that take these out before the leaves are bundled and rolled, they often find their way into our favorite smokes. Again, while annoying, somewhat normal. Some people can grab them and pull them out.   Hope this doesn't turn you off from the wonderful hobby!"
cigars,3di82l,ilikewatches,2,Thu Jul 16 14:15:16 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your reaction and I still can't understand how someone who should have alot of knowledge handed me the wrong thing I never had problems with it before, but then again I normally buy somewhere else so this could be a fault on my part definately! I actually really took the time and stopped myself from trying to smoke too fast as I usually do automaticly. That was the word I was looking for indeed. I just never had them on even sticks that are twice as cheap so I kinda was curious if I just had a bad batch or just unlucky or something :)   and as last this does definately not turn me away from the hobby, I enjoy it alot and I am still very new so I figured stuff like this would happen some time."

The guy working at the shop who showed me into the humidor was very unhelpful. The first 3 or 4 sticks I picked up to buy turned out to already have been sold and he asked me to not touch them.   Prices were not great either but that could be because of the import taxes of the country. Ended up getting a really enjoyable Ramon Allones LCDH there, but spent the rest of my trip at another cigar lounge (Vuelta Abajo Social Club) which was far superior."

Much to my surprise, it was great! The size is just right for this particular blend which shines once you get into the second third. I also liked that they were pre-cut because they make a great quick and short smoke while taking a break at work or on your commute.   Sadly, here in NYC I haven't seen a single store carrying them, but you might find some luck if you reach out to the west-coast folk.

Sounds like they are your style.  I don't count pennies or worry much about what's coming back on the verification.  I realize a lot of newer smokers may not have the access and experience, so no big deal.  Be as equitable as you can.  Remember I got a killer deal on these and I'm happy to share that fact."

You could have her do the 75 but then tell her to pull the smoke out and let it sit outside of humidity for a few hours. It's also worth checking some cigar boxes. Oliva, Fuente, and a few other brands put bovedas in with the cigars.  Edit: KOBE!"
cigars,3dh8jn,Immortalmortician,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:46:16 2015 UTC,"Right here.  The 75 boveda would likely be fine, the cigars would be overhumidified, but this isn't a problem in the short term.  Some retailers will keep their humidors on the higher end of RH since you have customers that want to squeeze the life out of the sticks, and the higher humidity makes them a little more pliable rather than cracking and the customer puts it back.  If you 'dry box' as /u/Immortalmortician pointed out, you'll have a fine smoke."

While the other jars have silver skulls, the skull pattern found on the ""secret"" release are gold. Only 100 of these jars are being produced.

As we spent more time together it started opening up telling me of its time in the Caribbean with its brothers and sisters in the hot fields of Cuba. Then it became more assertive, letting me it wasn't like these other Cigars and that I should respect it or it would put me on my ass. Once it knew I wasn't like the others and I was there for the long run it fully revealed itself. It had the spiciness you expect out of a Ligero but mixed with a smoothness you get from an Oliva. By the end of our romance I was the shy one afraid that I'd never meet another one like it.   The end lol"

cigars,3dgl76,Blaer_Writer,3,Thu Jul 16 02:43:42 2015 UTC,"Literally just posted this on another beginner question thred.   Welcome! Best advice i could give or have gotten when starting out is to smoke any and everything. You will get recommendations from everyone, like im doing now. Some of those you are pointed to will be fantastic. Some are going to suck. But thats all based on the person. What i love you wont necessarily care for. So the best thing you can do is smoke everything. You have a much better starting place with those 3 than I did so happy smoking to you. Smoke what you like and if theyre really good...send some to me!  As far as price goes, on some level you always get what you pay for. If you buy a Hyundai Elantra or a Mercedes Benz s550 which do you think will be nicer? Easy answer right? However, will they both get you to work. Yes. So I guess my point is, smoke within your means. But if you want to branch out and are inquiring whether or not a 10 dollar cigar is noticeably better than a 3 dollar cigar the answer is almost always yes."
cigars,3dgl76,akcufhumyzarc,3,Thu Jul 16 03:53:46 2015 UTC,"Try any from the Padron X000 series. They'll run you around $5 give or take a couple dollars. They're good cigars, especially for that price. And if you find you're not a fan of them, your wallet won't be taking that big of a hit.  And always remember cheap doesn't always equal bad. If you like a particular cigar, than it's a good cigar."
cigars,3dgl76,Ih8YourCat,2,Thu Jul 16 13:46:15 2015 UTC,The Maduro Padrons are so tasty. I just picked up a five pack of 3000s.
cigars,3dgl76,goodfella0108,2,Thu Jul 16 20:22:22 2015 UTC,Depends what those cigars are.  Try a Tatuaje or an Undercrown you never know until you try
cigars,3dgl76,goatcan,2,Thu Jul 16 02:55:11 2015 UTC,You Americans with your resonable prices!
cigars,3dgl76,Lostinwords,2,Thu Jul 16 04:07:29 2015 UTC,"I think that many users here would agree that you should decoupke the correlation between price and quality that you find on many other products.  Try a little bit of everything, and smoke what you like. Look for some of the frequently mentioned brands here. Perdomo, CAO, Arturo Fuente, MUWAT, Acid, Olivia and so on... get a feel for what flavors and sizes suit you well.  Welcome to /r/cigars."
cigars,3dgl76,holganaut,2,Thu Jul 16 06:31:11 2015 UTC,"You'll find a lot of cigars in the $7 to $10 range that will be great on flavor and will provide you with a noticeably better experience than those cheapo cigars. Aside from what everyone is telling you in regards to just grabbing a stick and smoking, I suggest you get one of the newbie samplers from small batch cigars over on the sidebar. You'll be getting a great package at a really good price and it'll certainly expand your cigar smoking experience. Just be sure to use a boveda pack in Tupper Ware container with a good seal on it to store them."
cigars,3dgl76,goodfella0108,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:23:45 2015 UTC,I always find that there's plenty to be had for 5-10 bucks a stick. Plenty of stuff to enjoy.
cigars,3dgl76,caseym21,0,Thu Jul 16 02:55:59 2015 UTC,I'd pass on anything under $5. $5-12 in NY is the sweetspot.

cigars,3dg8d5,Immortalmortician,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:11:58 2015 UTC,I do once in a while.
cigars,3dg8d5,mgcrunch,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:13:34 2015 UTC,"If you enjoy it, it's worth what you paid for it.   But no, I don't think they're worth $15. I purchased them at a discount, and I was OK smoking them for whatever I bought them at. There are few cigars I think are worth the $$ anyways. RoMa craft typically. Boli Short Boli. Pl Encantos. RA Estupendos and Petit Unicos. Casa Magna. EPC. OK, I'm done."
cigars,3dg8d5,john41285,3,Thu Jul 16 01:15:46 2015 UTC,"RoMa make great cigars at great price points..  Had a good talk with Skip and Mike and that is their goal.  Great tobacco, quality product, no advertising, cheap prices.  I would say its a better product and at a better price point than undercrown."
cigars,3dg8d5,Galvanator,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:34:12 2015 UTC,They blow undercrown outta the water I don't think it's even close. They make great cigars.
cigars,3dg8d5,Galvanator,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:22:59 2015 UTC,Agreed.  Really overlooked cigar that needs more people singing its praises

To echo the wise /u/goatcan, I would say the 7th Reserva is a great starting point to enter into the danger zone. Also check out Don Pepin Garcia, the Cuban Classic specifically, or La Duena if you want a shorter smoke. While not super complex nor heavy they can give you some interesting flavors."
cigars,3dgfe8,akcufhumyzarc,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:22:25 2015 UTC,What do you mean by the danger zone? And thanks for the recommendations. I'll put them on my list to buy later on. Don't want to overload myself at this point.

You'll have to go online and look up pictures to figure out which is which, but for being discount sticks, I really wanted you to have a set to try out. The unbanded stick is the Cuban Stock r/cigars made for the sub.  I took off the cedar that wrapped it since I don't want any mold problems with it. Don't rush on the little smokes.

cigars,3dfjx4,carnesy,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:17:44 2015 UTC,Lane 1q
cigars,3dfjx4,carnesy,2,Wed Jul 15 23:57:33 2015 UTC,"If you're not familiar with smoking pipes follow these steps.  Let it dry out for 20 minutes or so before smoking. You want it to the point where it will spring back apart but not crunch or crumble. If it still clumps together when you let go it's too wet. DO NOT USE YOUR TORCH LIGHTER! Get a golf tee or something to occasionally, gently press the cherry down onto the fresh leaf. Sip lightly every 10 to 15 seconds longer if it starts to scald your tongue, don't puff. The pipe will get warm but should never be uncomfortable to hold. A good test is to hold it against your cheek. If it feels hot on your cheek slow down a bit.  Store the exra in a clean mason jar not your himdor, pipe tobacco requires drastically less humidity."
cigars,3dfjx4,carnesy,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:23:25 2015 UTC,Thanks for the advice. I have very little experience with pipes.
cigars,3dfjx4,Puddin2013,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:45:44 2015 UTC,Honestly if it is 1q you'll likely get some taste from it but aromatics are more about room note than taste. They tend to burn hotter and be more finicky than other blends. Not to say he gave you a bad blend or anything just letting you know what to expect. Head over to /r/pipetobacco if you want to explore the wide world of pipes.
cigars,3dfjx4,Puddin2013,3,Thu Jul 16 00:49:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, for some reason I pefer the more mild aeromatic tobacco in my pipe and more of a med-full in a cigar."

cigars,3desbi,Alexandurr,2,Wed Jul 15 19:00:54 2015 UTC,What does C. A. D. mean? I can't help but read it as CAD like Computer Automated Design
cigars,3desbi,cigaraway,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:08:57 2015 UTC,"I'd like to know this too, but my best guess is 'cigar addiction disorder' or 'cigar aficionado disease' or something...No idea though."

cigars,3dfl0j,joethepeacock,4,Wed Jul 15 21:51:08 2015 UTC,"There are four in the series (Factory Press) with the FP1 being first released in 2005 and each consequently after that. Many people are a fan of the FP line, especially FPIIs and FPs. I recently scored two FP ORs at a shop, but had to pay quite a bit over MSRP ($21/per)... have yet to smoke them but they should be ready here within the week."
cigars,3dfl0j,jholen,3,Wed Jul 15 22:18:39 2015 UTC,That's actually a solid price!
cigars,3dfl0j,Immortalmortician,2,Wed Jul 15 22:46:47 2015 UTC,I paid it twice ;)   Really looking forward to giving it a go.
cigars,3dfl0j,jholen,3,Wed Jul 15 22:48:17 2015 UTC,There were also 2 factory press limitados so that brings it up to 6 releases in the line.

cigars,3dfog3,mattp341,2,Wed Jul 15 22:17:00 2015 UTC,You can take cutter and cigars. Cannot take butane torch. Bring some wood matches.
cigars,3dfog3,zjory,2,Wed Jul 15 22:27:35 2015 UTC,"Okay thanks, that's a shame I won't be able to light up while on the beach"
cigars,3dfog3,anma1234,2,Wed Jul 15 22:31:18 2015 UTC,U can have the lighter in checked luggage.
cigars,3dfog3,goodfella0108,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:13:12 2015 UTC,You could always buy a cheap torch wherever you're going.
cigars,3dfog3,Immortalmortician,2,Thu Jul 16 13:27:44 2015 UTC,Yeah I may end up doing that
cigars,3dfog3,zjory,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:51:36 2015 UTC,But he is doing checked not carry on.
cigars,3dfog3,OhSoHoppy,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:37:52 2015 UTC,"AFAIK, it makes no difference. Those DOT approved cases used to work for checked bags, but I had one removed from a checked bag a few months back and what I found online indicated FAA, DOT & TSA approval has expired and is no longer approved on aircraft.   Having said that, we all know the only thing TSA always finds is water bottles, so a torch lighter is likely to get through."
cigars,3dfog3,Immortalmortician,2,Wed Jul 15 22:42:26 2015 UTC,"I've gotten by with a torch in my checked luggage on several occasions, however I don't recommend you try it with a nice/expensive lighter because with the TSA everything is a crapshoot. If anything, I'd recommend you pick up an el-cheapo torch and throw it into your luggage. This way if the decide to take it it's not a huge loss.   Also, I remember talk a while back about a bic soft-flame to torch adapter you could buy. It fits a standard bic and pretty much turns it into a torch. The best thing is it's travel friendly. I can't for the life of me remember where to buy it what it's called though :/ I'm hoping one of the botl's on here might chime in about it."

cigars,3dfog3,Jonesyy95,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:19:19 2015 UTC,Checked luggage you may be able to do a butane lighter just not a carry on.
cigars,3dfog3,porquejorge,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:37:36 2015 UTC,"I just got back from a trip. What I always do is bring my herfador and a liquid lighter, box of matches, and a cheap cutter on my carry-on (all in the case). I've never been stopped going through security. Just make sure you bring enough cigars!"
cigars,3dff6u,Beardedbeardedbear,2,Wed Jul 15 21:08:22 2015 UTC,"I'm northeast-ish, pa, and 65% is perfect for me.  I used to use 69% bovedas, by i was having some issues with tight draw.  It's VERY humid here in the summer and every time i opened up my humidor my hygrometer would jump from 69% to 90% almost immediately.  The drop to 65% realm helped.  I usually try and let cigars rest for a month, but every now and then I'll grab something after two weeks."
cigars,3dff6u,pastafarian_brewer,2,Wed Jul 15 21:23:21 2015 UTC,Great information. I will switch to 65. Thanks for your reply!
cigars,3dff6u,BigNikiStyle,2,Wed Jul 15 21:56:51 2015 UTC,"Wow, that b&m owner is a fucking asshat. Just get the 65s, give it some time and they'll sort themselves out. What you could do is leave your humidor just open for a day to let everything dry out a bit before putting in the new bovedas."
cigars,3dff6u,BigNikiStyle,2,Wed Jul 15 21:13:57 2015 UTC,Thanks. You're a pro. I mean that sincerely! lol
cigars,3dff6u,YUNOtiger,2,Wed Jul 15 21:14:29 2015 UTC,"No problem, champ. Good luck with the switch."
cigars,3dff6u,I_M_A_Monster,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:45:11 2015 UTC,"Not really an asshat. 70% is usually a safe starting point, and wooden humidors rarely hold exactly what the Boveda says, but 1 - 3% lower.  So he may have been assuming that. I know for my desktop humidor, if I want 65%, I run 69% bags, and usually hit about 66%."
