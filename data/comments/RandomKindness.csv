RandomKindness,3dlefh,Raynenjoshua,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:29:06 2015 UTC,"You sound like a lovely person. I'm not a grandparent but I'm a mother now and my grandparents raised me. My birth mom would have given my sister and I both up as she's stated multiple times before. My grandparents saved us and gave us a family.   As a mom, my son didn't get chatty until right around age 3. I had him in speech therapy and really, just some kids are like that. We went through a divorce just before he was 2 so I'm not sure that effected him. Other than that, he's been in a loving & very healthy stable environment. I hope any drugs haven't effected your kids by birth defects or syndromes & they were thoroughly checked if mom is dependent.   My hope for you is your daughter will one day clean her life up and show you the love and appreciation you deserve for raising these kids. I know you're struggling now but those toddler days will pass soon. Contact your local church or mom's groups to see what type of help you have access to. Don't feel ashamed in public as many older people have children of their own now and it's not any stranger's business whether those are your birth kids or not. Hang in there <3"
RandomKindness,3dlefh,MIchonne,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:55:14 2015 UTC,"You are not alone their are many of us out here some better some worse. Men should always pray without ceasing. I now still today take care of four of my grandchildren and one of my own my 16 year old daughter whom I thank God for her every day for sharing her life and sharing  me. I have taken in nine of my grandchildren by myself over  11 years all brothers and sisters and two of my children were still also living at home yes 12 of us at Home in one house.  Somewhat Same scenario as you all  as far as the parents. Some fathers not even known in my case We were blessed then and we still are today. Don't be ashamed. People make their own decision and the children are caught in the cross fire. They never asked for this but they are our future and need Love and guidance and also need a chance to have a future a normal life I know that my history seems unreal but all true. If i wasn't living it i wouldn't believe it myself. Their will be good times and not so good times just know that God will not put more on you than  you can bare and that this to shall pass. I never really put much in these little quotes and sayings. but they are true and very powerful  You guys have to find your ground your footing in the Lord and have faith to know that all things work together for those who Love God. Don't get lost in the process Called life. Forever changing it can be a dreaded downfall or an uplifting Experience it's  all in how you choose to look at it and treat it. you can learn from anything or anyone it just takes you to find the process that best fits you all. you and your husband have each other. Always make time for yourselves and thank and show appreciation to your son for what he does an has done. Theses are your children now it's simpler  and easier than trying to explain your story to someone who probably don't have a clue on how or what they can say or do to help or some could care less and thanking God it's not them. You guys are a Family unit live  and love as One unit i've learned to laugh a lot it feels better than crying i often find my self looking for cameras thinking  Maybe I'm on the show candied camera or I'm being punked. no I'm not rich i haven't worked since the children have been with me I have a small gift basket and diaper cake business that I'm Just starting. A gift that I've been blessed with for our future self sufficiency.  I wasn't able to work do to some set backs of some of the children . some were addicted and some had (minor in my mind) illness do to the drug abuse. Faith to know that even though you can't see healing ,peace and patience ,financial growth, that it shall come to pass just know that the Lord answers prayer and blessing come every day I pray that my testimony gives you some strength and direction and our prayers are with you."
