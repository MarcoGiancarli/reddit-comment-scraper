RocketLeague,3e2s1s,oliman22,248,Tue Jul 21 14:51:12 2015 UTC,We need a self-destruct button in these cases.
RocketLeague,3e2s1s,Pradorix,52,Tue Jul 21 15:10:12 2015 UTC,It might actually be fun if you could destroy yourself to push the ball if you were close enough but misaligned.
RocketLeague,3e2s1s,thomthumb,27,Tue Jul 21 16:16:59 2015 UTC,"Maybe if it was only allowed like once a match or you had to earn it with regular goals or something, otherwise it'd be suicide bombers all day."
RocketLeague,3e2s1s,King_Spartacus,88,Tue Jul 21 16:21:10 2015 UTC,Make it require full boost?
RocketLeague,3e2s1s,Velirno,32,Tue Jul 21 16:25:52 2015 UTC,"Not a bad idea, but I still kinda worry that it'd happen too often."
RocketLeague,3e2s1s,King_Spartacus,16,Tue Jul 21 16:47:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, i can already see in 4v4 all 8 going kamikaze and it would spoil the match,,"
RocketLeague,3e2s1s,catame2,20,Tue Jul 21 18:55:57 2015 UTC,"Which could be hilarious in a custom mode type thing sometimes, but not in the mainstream ranked/unranked."
RocketLeague,3e2s1s,King_Spartacus,5,Tue Jul 21 19:06:11 2015 UTC,"I dont play in ranked, i play just to relax a bit, and have some fun, but some people really annoyed me in this game, and i can see a big improvment in those annoying numbers with this idea.."
RocketLeague,3e2s1s,catame2,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:21:16 2015 UTC,"I'd imagine that if/when they start putting in the crazy stuff for non-ranked games, it'd be another option to select when matchmaking.   Otherwise the only way to ensure you play vanilla would be ranked, and that'd suck."
RocketLeague,3e2s1s,andystealth,4,Wed Jul 22 03:13:01 2015 UTC,"For sure, I wouldn't even mind a self-destruct that just resets my position."
RocketLeague,3e2s1s,Velirno,17,Tue Jul 21 17:12:09 2015 UTC,That makes it a little too easy to get back to defend a counter attack.
RocketLeague,3e2s1s,i_am_new_in_here,3,Tue Jul 21 17:19:12 2015 UTC,If you self destruct. You are out of the game until the next goal is scored.
RocketLeague,3e2s1s,Gangstrocity,8,Tue Jul 21 18:31:15 2015 UTC,"No need to make it that long, just give it like 5-10 second delay"
RocketLeague,3e2s1s,ThaGriffman,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:33:52 2015 UTC,"I dunno, it'd be damned hilarious to see everyone self destruct and then the ball not score. Especially if you're the last one standing, and just spend the next couple of minutes dicking around without a goal. haha"
RocketLeague,3e2s1s,andystealth,5,Wed Jul 22 03:14:15 2015 UTC,I was thinking he meant a self only destruct with no possibility to destroy other cars
RocketLeague,3e2s1s,Spyzilla,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:19:01 2015 UTC,Just lengthen the respawn time until it is under control.

RocketLeague,3e2s1s,2manycooks,5,Tue Jul 21 19:45:23 2015 UTC,"This. Playing of few sessions of aerial was so helpful... even though I still miss most of the time, but now its definitely a viable option, so yeah, do the training"
RocketLeague,3e2s1s,Existanceisdenied,2,Wed Jul 22 02:23:24 2015 UTC,"They taught you how to get ahead of other players in the tutorial if you are behind and have zero boost. So you jump in the air, angle yourself forwards, and press jump again.   I perfected this technique in free play, so now I'm always there and I don't rely on boost as often, which is helpful when I need to fly (which is never.)"

RocketLeague,3e2s1s,catame2,2,Wed Jul 22 02:54:45 2015 UTC,"Same here! I think it's a combination of having a little more nuance in the handling, plus the fact that aerial pitch is independent of the throttle."

RocketLeague,3e2s1s,Duvieln,2,Tue Jul 21 17:44:10 2015 UTC,There should be a 5 minute minimum wait time for leaving ranked matches. After the second leave within 24 hours (or something like that) make it a 15 minute wait. Continue escalating punishment with every consecutive leave. That could probably be toned down or maybe even abolished entirely for normal games as they're not as important but ranked definitely needs a better system for it.
RocketLeague,3e2s1s,stimz910,2,Tue Jul 21 21:57:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah.  I'm not sure if they lose skill points too, which they probably do, but I agree.  Right now there needs to be A punishment though.    In any case I don't understand why people leave games with like a 3 points deficit with 3-4 minutes left.  I see comebacks so often"
RocketLeague,3e2s1s,Duvieln,2,Tue Jul 21 23:00:35 2015 UTC,Absolutely. I lost a ranked game when I was up by 3 goals with less than a minute left in 3v3 once. I was pissed off that we let it happen but I never give up until the timer hits 0.

RocketLeague,3e4rrh,MissplacedLandmine,16,Wed Jul 22 00:48:11 2015 UTC,Can we have one where the ball turns into a turd and plops to the ground when I score on my own goal?   I need some sorta incentive not to and giving the enemy a point is apparently not enough

RocketLeague,3e4rrh,IAMBollock,47,Wed Jul 22 01:04:37 2015 UTC,"I clicked thinking you want to add power ups and shit but I wouldn't mind this. That'd be pretty cool; I wouldn't even mind changing the name that pops up like ""Kronosvc scored!"" could be all Goosebumps like or on fire or whatever."
RocketLeague,3e4rrh,RegularFreddieWilson,6,Tue Jul 21 23:31:54 2015 UTC,"Celebration cosmetics are actually the perfect idea, people want cosmetics they buy to be seen. You might catch a glimpse of a cool cosmetic in game or in replays but this being shown to everyone whenever you score makes it desirable."
RocketLeague,3e4rrh,Derpface123,15,Wed Jul 22 03:21:31 2015 UTC,"I really like this. It could almost be like each player could choose a touchdown celebration. The devs could get creative with it too, like have the ball explode and a bunch of little goblins pop out and start doing a dance or instead of exploding, the ball launches out of the net at super speed and flies all over the stadium. There are a ton of possibilities. This is a really cool idea. I hope it gets picked up."
RocketLeague,3e4rrh,DarkRaven47,5,Wed Jul 22 00:05:40 2015 UTC,"We need a response from Psyonix on this one, it seems totally plausible and harmless!"
RocketLeague,3e4rrh,DwEoArTmH,4,Wed Jul 22 02:26:34 2015 UTC,That's a good idea.
RocketLeague,3e4rrh,RockyValderas,3,Tue Jul 21 23:34:45 2015 UTC,Not a bad idea. I had a similar idea with car explosions.
RocketLeague,3e4rrh,79Blazer4x4,3,Wed Jul 22 01:20:13 2015 UTC,I would like to see one where the ball floats up and does an Electrode-like explosion (Electrode the Pokemon).
RocketLeague,3e4rrh,zibberfly,3,Wed Jul 22 01:24:47 2015 UTC,"I think they could make the ball explosion to match most of the boost types. For example: Slime, rainbow, snowflakes, etc. Confetti would definitely be a cool one too."
RocketLeague,3e4rrh,Ravie27,3,Wed Jul 22 01:38:57 2015 UTC,This is the first non game changing addition that I actually like.
RocketLeague,3e4rrh,stumptruck,3,Wed Jul 22 02:05:44 2015 UTC,I really like this idea! in fact they could sync it along with a lot of the other upgrade items you get things like a explosive slime ball or lightning or cash flying everywhere etc. it'd fit in just perfectly!
RocketLeague,3e4rrh,Heathums_,3,Wed Jul 22 02:26:20 2015 UTC,This is cool.  Only a cosmetic change but I think it fits in with the theming and style of the game as it is already.  Good idea
RocketLeague,3e4rrh,Tyronis3,3,Wed Jul 22 02:51:23 2015 UTC,I've always thought that if a car's in the goal when someone scores they should explode rather than just be launched away like everyone else nearby.
RocketLeague,3e4rrh,Ilves7,4,Wed Jul 22 02:56:46 2015 UTC,Good idea. What about skins for the ball?  Maybe it would randomly be picked like the map
RocketLeague,3e4rrh,TheEpicKiller,4,Wed Jul 22 00:57:44 2015 UTC,"That could work, but it wouldn't be able to be a player item I don't think. You'd have 20+ games in a row where your particular ball skin wouldn't be used (theoretically)"
RocketLeague,3e4rrh,punktual,6,Wed Jul 22 01:00:25 2015 UTC,The first ball could be randomly chosen and then afterwards determined by whoever scored the latest goal
RocketLeague,3e4rrh,Benemy,5,Wed Jul 22 04:43:57 2015 UTC,Well if it's just a skin each player can just see their version?
RocketLeague,3e4rrh,AwesomeOnsum,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:35:58 2015 UTC,That's a good idea!
RocketLeague,3e4rrh,weezermc78,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:05:32 2015 UTC,No it isn't because it might make it easier to see the ball for some players.
RocketLeague,3e4rrh,stinkypete234,2,Wed Jul 22 05:41:44 2015 UTC,"I like this idea a lot, as well as the option to have your own sound play when you make a goal as well."

RocketLeague,3e4rrh,Dysonism,3,Wed Jul 22 04:51:08 2015 UTC,This would be cool. Also an item where whenever you smack the ball the color trail it leaves is modified in some way. Just a thought.
RocketLeague,3e4rrh,ps4hero,5,Wed Jul 22 00:06:06 2015 UTC,Something like that I'd want kept out of ranked but I like it

RocketLeague,3e3l2h,cokeyy,2,Tue Jul 21 21:11:48 2015 UTC,"I play primarily in ball cam so that i can get better positioning, but if I am going in for an aerial or for a goal, or even if im just sitting back waiting for a good hit, i take it off ball cam.

RocketLeague,3e3l2h,skusmet,2,Wed Jul 22 00:47:11 2015 UTC,"I bought the game, played a few games with ball cam always on an was jeah ok, than the next day I started playing without ballcam and a wider, zoomed out camera angle and holy shit. I had the feeling my skills really raised in just a few hours. Of course im still a beginner but I had a much better learning progress without ballcam. Maybe its different for each type of player, im not the one who always sticks on the ball, I search for space, collect boosters, use opportunities and jump in defense if necessary. If youre always on the ball you may need the ball cam more."

RocketLeague,3e50ai,Almlov,2,Wed Jul 22 00:40:26 2015 UTC,"Mainly I'll just use the second boost jump to do a quick barrel roll or flip, which adds a ton of power to the shot.

Just something for next time to help you get back for some saves faster!  Well done though :D"
RocketLeague,3e35ta,alphama1e,4,Tue Jul 21 19:54:25 2015 UTC,Haha yeah thanks for the tip! This match happened a few days ago and after watching it a few times now I've picked up on some little things like that. I'm definitely adding that technique.
RocketLeague,3e35ta,alphama1e,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:02:50 2015 UTC,"On top of that, there were a couple rush opportunities you missed. You're good at aerial hits but you need to take risks and commit to rushes when the ball approaches center. It's an even bigger deal in a match like this when no one is using aerials. You could have scored a couple more times."
RocketLeague,3e35ta,username_generator,4,Tue Jul 21 21:32:56 2015 UTC,It's interesting you say that because I feel at times that I play too passively. Most of the randoms I play with want to constantly rush the ball and I hate leaving the goal unprotected. But sometimes I wonder if I should attack more rather than hang back.
RocketLeague,3e35ta,Kienn12,2,Tue Jul 21 22:40:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah but consider that you left the goal for boost and got scored on. You could have rushed the corner to clear the ball, grabbed boost on the way, then rushed their goal before they could regroup. I know it's easier said than done but sometimes aggression is a winning strategy; patience until an opening and then explode."
RocketLeague,3e35ta,Kienn12,2,Wed Jul 22 00:37:00 2015 UTC,Thanks for the advice. I'm gonna work on that tonight.
RocketLeague,3e35ta,Kienn12,9,Wed Jul 22 00:45:38 2015 UTC,"From the chat log, it looks like the guy who left got pretty discouraged. Wonder if you still would have pulled of the same win if they hadn't left."
RocketLeague,3e35ta,Douchehelm,7,Tue Jul 21 17:52:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah I believe he was complaining about his teammates bumping him. I saved the replay and followed his car. Honestly, any time he was bumped it was just another team mate making a move for the ball. He was also playing pretty poorly anyway (not that I'm all-Pro by any stretch of the imagination).   I've been frustrated lately with people quitting ranked matches which is what made this so much sweeter and prompted me to post on reddit."
RocketLeague,3e35ta,tonequality,3,Tue Jul 21 17:59:49 2015 UTC,All of my 2v2 games(around 10 games) have become me v2... usually within the first minute.  I've almost won 3 of them... no wins yet tho :(
RocketLeague,3e35ta,King_Spartacus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:00:59 2015 UTC,Yeah I mostly lose when something like this happens. I really think it helps improve your game though when you stick it out in a lopsided match.
RocketLeague,3e35ta,somestupidloser,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:35:03 2015 UTC,"Yea, I think I'm getting pretty decent, and since I've won 0 games my rating is 0 so I'm going against 2 guys with likely similar low rating - they very often interfere with each other."

RocketLeague,3e35ta,mastrkage,4,Tue Jul 21 21:14:57 2015 UTC,I've ran into so many babies in this game. So many times have I had to go 1v3 when my teammates quit after getting a couple of early goals scored on us.
RocketLeague,3e35ta,mastrkage,2,Tue Jul 21 22:40:38 2015 UTC,You and me both man. I think this is one of the biggest issues with the RL community right now. Hopefully the devs find a fix for it.
RocketLeague,3e35ta,b1gnickdigger,3,Wed Jul 22 00:12:38 2015 UTC,That was great. It felt like you were very calm and methodical about how you played it. I was getting frustrated when you were getting blown up for you. I'd like to think of that final goal as a fuck you to the guy who kept killing you.
RocketLeague,3e35ta,RemingtonSnatch,2,Tue Jul 21 18:34:31 2015 UTC,Thanks! I was pretty calm throughout because I assumed another loss was in my future. I was more frustrated with the quitter than anything else.
RocketLeague,3e35ta,Magnetized,3,Tue Jul 21 18:40:25 2015 UTC,I hate people that leave when the team is down 3 goals with something like 2 minutes left in the game. I've come back and have collapsed with even less time than that.
RocketLeague,3e35ta,ComusLoM,2,Tue Jul 21 19:35:29 2015 UTC,I completely agree. The momentum can swing so quickly in this game. That's part of what makes it so fun.
RocketLeague,3e35ta,BamItsBlitz,6,Tue Jul 21 19:38:39 2015 UTC,"TL,DR: We win in OT. The fun starts at about 5:10."
RocketLeague,3e35ta,SairAerwyn,2,Tue Jul 21 16:32:36 2015 UTC,"I've had games like this where we'd be down like 5-0, and within that span go through 3-4 different teammates who would leave the game. The tide of the game can change at the drop of a dime, and when a team gets that big of a lead, sometimes they end up making mistakes that cost them, or relax a bit, and we'd end up coming back and winning. I wish there was some kind of penalty for leaving a game early."
RocketLeague,3e35ta,SairAerwyn,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:06:28 2015 UTC,Yeah it felt like the opposing team in this match sort of relaxed. I'm also hoping to see penalties for quitters. I think I read somewhere that the developers are working on something for that.
RocketLeague,3e35ta,Kawil12,2,Tue Jul 21 18:10:41 2015 UTC,"That was beautiful. It's amazing how much the sour-puss 3rd person can ruin an experience, and make everything better once they leave. I've had a similar experience in a previous match, but your last goal was glorious."
RocketLeague,3e35ta,jarch3r,2,Tue Jul 21 19:43:27 2015 UTC,Nice goal to finish it off at the end. Fun video!
RocketLeague,3e35ta,jarch3r,2,Tue Jul 21 19:45:02 2015 UTC,"Great comeback. hey idk if you know or not, but heres a tip: you can speed yourself up without boost by accelorating and quickly double jumping holding foward. or try reversing and double jump holding backward. just noticed you never did it."
RocketLeague,3e35ta,SnakeATWAR,2,Tue Jul 21 20:08:09 2015 UTC,Yeah you're the 2nd one to say that haha. I'll be doing that in the future. I'm just laughing now thinking about you guys cringing watching me drive around like a grandpa.
RocketLeague,3e35ta,lostinmywar,3,Tue Jul 21 20:11:45 2015 UTC,"LOL. well i didnt know about it at one point either, so i figured id help someone out who may or may not know :) hey, you still pulled off a good comeback, so obviously youre already doing good lol"
RocketLeague,3e35ta,tipytop,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:13:47 2015 UTC,Til you can do a backwards jump if you're driving backwards. I just thought it always jumped in place.
RocketLeague,3e35ta,twisted-freak,2,Tue Jul 21 23:47:03 2015 UTC,That's just humiliating...  Well played. Once it was 4-2 you guys were in their heads.

I've definitely gotten sick of players leaving when they start losing but I guess its common for competitive games. theres always gonna be the bad sportsmen.   Hopefully the devs can add some penalising system for this to discourage it. the sooner the better."

RocketLeague,3e19p4,Vithar,3,Tue Jul 21 13:25:31 2015 UTC,There's been a few times where the ball was in the corner by our net and I'll sit back as the goalie and watch the other 5 players drive aimlessly around the ball for a good 30 seconds.
RocketLeague,3e19p4,brownsfantb,6,Tue Jul 21 15:22:28 2015 UTC,"Yea, it took an effort to ""slow down"", but my game has gotten better for it."
RocketLeague,3e19p4,Vithar,6,Tue Jul 21 15:25:16 2015 UTC,That feeling of slowing down to time a perfect hit only to have your teammate ram you from behind full throttle while they wildly jump for the ball... :(
RocketLeague,3e19p4,BigUptokes,2,Tue Jul 21 17:58:16 2015 UTC,"Yea, that does suck.  Its funny, there is a clear moment as skill develops were a player transitions from Smash the ball to controlling the ball.  I prefer doubles and so far I have only played with randoms, but when you get a good partner its ridiculous how much more fun the game is.  Best match I have had so far we lost 0:1 in overtime, the game must have lasted 15 minuets. Clearly evenly matched teams, but everyone was taking their time, and making calculated hits, no smash and bash.  So many saves and shots on goal that we all had pretty high scores by the end even with the low score.  If this was normal it would be amazing, as it stands playing with randoms you ether get a good partner and destroy the opposition or don't and get destroyed."
RocketLeague,3e19p4,Vithar,2,Tue Jul 21 20:13:05 2015 UTC,Doubles is the only mode I haven't tried yet for fear of being that partner.

RocketLeague,3e19p4,Vithar,2,Wed Jul 22 01:10:03 2015 UTC,It's even more comical at kick-off when you see 4 people somersault and drive laps around a ball that's not moving.  Feels like some weird-ass ritual before the game starts.
RocketLeague,3e19p4,TelamonianAjax,2,Tue Jul 21 16:56:29 2015 UTC,"I've only had this happen once or twice.  If I start closest to the ball I'll quick chat ""I got it"" and boost + somersault in and usually get first touch either knocking it to a corner or have it slowly bounce towards one of my teammates."
RocketLeague,3e19p4,electric_creamsicle,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:23:01 2015 UTC,"I love quick chatting ""Defending"" when I'm in one of the further spots, and watch my team members not go for it.  Everyone just sits parked, and an easy goal is scored.  On the flip side, I have had a laugh plenty of times getting that easy goal as the other team just hangs out."
RocketLeague,3e19p4,Vithar,2,Tue Jul 21 20:15:03 2015 UTC,A few times?  I think you mean every game because I have one teammate chasing the ball the entire game every time.
RocketLeague,3e19p4,electric_creamsicle,2,Tue Jul 21 17:21:08 2015 UTC,I have scored my fair share of goals by just sitting back and watching a play develop. Then I go boosting in and ram it home.
RocketLeague,3e19p4,danjr321,2,Tue Jul 21 19:30:48 2015 UTC,"This.  I have taken to ether hanging out in goal, or in the circle at midfield.  Generally hanging out at one or the other ether lets you get to the ball to attack fast, or make it to goal to defend.  I don't wast as much time on the sides or corners anymore."
RocketLeague,3e19p4,Vithar,2,Tue Jul 21 20:18:14 2015 UTC,I hang out a bit at the side if a play is developing since I have the best aerial/wall skills out of the people I usually play with.

Aerial skills are my weakest, which I'm sure is common.  I hadn't thought to worry about it since not many people seam to have decent aerial skills.  I played someone who did, and it was devastating."
RocketLeague,3e19p4,Vithar,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:25:28 2015 UTC,"Aerials are definitely something that can take a bit of work. I am by no means a god when it comes to them, but I make some cool things happen from time to time.

But it can be annoying sometimes. On the other hand, it's not that uncommon to score a goal or a clear off of a fresh re-spawn either."
RocketLeague,3e1stl,Smakx,12,Tue Jul 21 11:26:08 2015 UTC,"Doing it strategically is fine, but when all you do is drive around to blow players up it's annoying and you're kinda useless for your team"
RocketLeague,3e1stl,Keyll93,24,Tue Jul 21 12:08:09 2015 UTC,I think in 4v4 it's perfectly fine for 1 player to run around destroying people. It's part of the game and it's something you need to be aware of.
RocketLeague,3e1stl,Impostor1089,5,Tue Jul 21 14:09:19 2015 UTC,"Perfect example of don't hate the player, hate the game.  It's (partially) why ""enforcers"" are a part of the game of hockey.  Just gotta outplay them (like the gif)."
RocketLeague,3e1stl,EliteAzn,2,Tue Jul 21 15:12:10 2015 UTC,"Right. Like I said, when you have a 4v4 situation, you can have 2 guys up, 1 guy demolishing and a guy hanging back. Perfectly valid strategy, albeit annoying. They can do it 3v3 and 2v2 but you're probably losing more than you gain at that point."
RocketLeague,3e1stl,Impostor1089,2,Tue Jul 21 15:22:12 2015 UTC,"Eh, doing it sometimes is very strategically viable, but if I'm guarding goal while the ball is at the other end of the pitch and one of their guys is still trying to ram me, he's definitely not being effective.

RocketLeague,3e1stl,APeacefulWarrior,4,Tue Jul 21 17:33:03 2015 UTC,"Someone who does nothing but kill is, if nothing else, practicing a valuable skill.   I think you are giving way too much credit to a specific sub-set of players who are, in all likelihood, simply trolls.    I mean, I also play a lot of Mario Kart, and there's a similar group in online Karting who play solely to troll.  They'll literally pull over and wait a lap, to ensure they get nothing but high-powered items that can disrupt the race.   They never ever actually try to race seriously or show the slightest interest in placement.  They're just playing for the sake of trying to ruin everyone else's day.    And I'm pretty sure that's all that's going on in Rocket League as well, when talking about these folks who literally do nothing but go for demolitions.  Any game is going to attract its share of people who just can't play nice with others."
RocketLeague,3e1stl,SmashBreak,-1,Tue Jul 21 19:27:13 2015 UTC,"I'm not. I'm just granting them what legitimacy I can because it's better than completely delegitimizing them, since that just results in stigmas and limiting of strategies. Besides, if someone's just killing to troll then they're either lightly sabotaging their team or at best just helping it way less than they could. If someone really wants to troll they can do their best to score on their own team...  Anyway, everything needs to be considered fair game this early on, so we can advance the meta-game without abstract limitations. I'm sort of reminded of the TF2 stigma against Heavy or M1 Pyro for being overly simple. It's an inaccurate complaint and it limits the competitive development in the game (apart from the actual dedicated competitive community).  I just dislike stigmas more than I dislike trolls"
RocketLeague,3e1stl,mking22,8,Tue Jul 21 21:21:59 2015 UTC,"Getting killed actually puts the player in a pretty good defending position. I've found that the people who make an effort to kill others are typically scrubs anyway, and it only hurts their team."
RocketLeague,3e1stl,NeedHelpWithExcel,4,Tue Jul 21 14:45:51 2015 UTC,You've obviously never watched any high level play of this game. Every single time they touch the ball they immediately switch cameras to try and ram the other team's cars.

I'm sure there are parts of the field where killing is good and parts where it isn't. I bet a lot of the time it's better to just bash them out of the way rather than killing, too."

RocketLeague,3e1stl,MuckyLucille,2,Tue Jul 21 13:49:48 2015 UTC,As a goalie Myself I have learned to listen for the boost sounds some of them are really loud and noticable. So if I hear that I go out of ball view look around and move if needed.

RocketLeague,3e2cvk,Wasabicannon,2,Tue Jul 21 20:09:30 2015 UTC,It's not just you! All the cars have different hitboxes.

RocketLeague,3e2cvk,Glibhat,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:04:16 2015 UTC,Can someone verify this? Wouldn't a larger hit box give you a slight advantage?
RocketLeague,3e2cvk,kingdaro,2,Tue Jul 21 21:48:17 2015 UTC,Larger hit box sucks if you're trying to sneak under a ball heading towards your side to bicycle kick it back. Also makes it easier for people to block your path.
RocketLeague,3e2cvk,RemingtonSnatch,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:42:30 2015 UTC,"They're relatively negligible. Also, having an advantage is contextual; it may be advantageous to have slightly lower hit boxes in certain situations.   I'm on mobile so it's a pain to link, but if you search ""hitbox"" in this subreddit you'll find a link to a dev's tweet that confirms different hit boxes between cars.   Edit: Here."

Go undefeated in a 3v3 all-star season. 10 wins with money wheels/tophat/money antenna/money trail equipped. Achieve 10/10 in all the all-star training sessions. Play a game with all teammates driving the exact same car setup.  Those sorts of things...    I feel like they wouldn't make this sort of statement about things they can't measure/observe. I don't think they're talking about players noticing the particulars of the environment.

RocketLeague,3e1b56,amanitus,11,Tue Jul 21 05:15:25 2015 UTC,They could cap the score for end game or force the game not to allow the same points/stat in such a short time to record.  It will keep track that it keeps shot on goal/save but if its within 1second of another then it should not register.
RocketLeague,3e1b56,HyperactiveToast,6,Tue Jul 21 05:38:46 2015 UTC,"I wonder if they could just calculate shots/saves with a minimum ball speed.  Shots do record shot speed already so maybe if shot/save is under 1 mph and repeats more quickly than 1 second apart, it just disables registering the shot/save until a third player touches the ball or the ball speeds up again."

RocketLeague,3e2neh,Its_What_I_Do,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:31:59 2015 UTC,Seeing the whole team fly up field is when you know within 3 seconds of kickoff that you're winning that game. And then I wonder how those people got to that skill rating. What sucks is when they're on my team and I have to play designated D the entire match (which is when I've answered the above question).

RocketLeague,3e2neh,Specialbrowny,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:05:10 2015 UTC,"I've been wondering about this all day. I was called a cheat in the finals after ramming Colesepher, leading to a goal.   My teammate /u/Drop_Shot_94 told me it's frowned upon at high level play, but it still seems kinda legit to me. Regardless, I stopped doing it last night since it was all in good fun."
RocketLeague,3e2neh,vizniz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:31:07 2015 UTC,"But... But why? I don't get stuff  like this being ""frowned upon"" because it gives an advantage when both teams are totally free to do it. It's basically like being a hockey enforcer, but the goalie can also be a victim to it. Sigh, this is why I could never be upper level competition, even if I had the skills for it, which I dont"
RocketLeague,3e2neh,khronojester,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:47:31 2015 UTC,I agree. I think that maybe most of the players that are at that level are multi year veterans of the series. An entire generation of etiquette and meta was built. We're part of an influx of new players with our own ideas.

RocketLeague,3e2jal,xen_deth,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:06:59 2015 UTC,No it doesn't. You only get an aerial when meeting specific requirements. I think they are height and/or flight duration. That goal was definitely not an aerial or I'd be swimming in aerial goals.

RocketLeague,3dypg9,JSpauny,19,Mon Jul 20 16:56:08 2015 UTC,That's the best part. When people just congregate in the corner as if they'll be the one to magically get the ball out. Then the ball ends up in the front of the goal and its an easy score.
RocketLeague,3dypg9,goblinseverywhere,12,Mon Jul 20 17:02:48 2015 UTC,"This is how i've been playing most games, hanging back and then knocking it in once it gets booted out.  After 2 games of being in the crowd I realized how stupid it was.. so pointless."
RocketLeague,3dypg9,AngelMeatPie,3,Mon Jul 20 23:05:47 2015 UTC,"Same here. I'm always either goalie or hitting in strays while everyone else is magnetized to the ball. So much mvp.   But it is funny watching 5 people continuously flip and miss trying to hit the ball. I probably should record some of it, it's pretty hysterical."
RocketLeague,3dypg9,Eagle1337,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:40:44 2015 UTC,I'm the one who usually sits and waits for the ball to bounce into the open and knock it in.  When I fight in the corner and bounce it   to the goal my teammates are never around to hit it. Usually they are chilling behind me or on the other side of the field.

RocketLeague,3dypg9,misconstrudel,3,Mon Jul 20 20:22:03 2015 UTC,eventually you'll learn how and where the ball likes to end up.  then you'll learn to be there when it does.

RocketLeague,3dypg9,Peewee223,18,Tue Jul 21 13:27:05 2015 UTC,"Any tips for a ""semi-pro"" who still feels like a level 1 rookie. I'm so bad at hitting the fucking ball I can't even knock in easy goals or hit balls on set ups. I'm just terrible at hitting the ball. It's actually beginning to make the game unfun for me because I feel like I'm not contributing much whiffing so much. Anything I do save/score is usually just luck RNG and not really setup or planned.   EDIT: Thanks for the suggestions I'll try much more striker trainer and perhaps the other training modes too. One step at a time."
RocketLeague,3dypg9,godofallcows,27,Mon Jul 20 20:20:47 2015 UTC,"Check out the training menu.  Seriously!  There's a ""striker"" training thing that gives you 7 seconds to make a goal with set starting positions for you and a ball. Keep working on it until you get 100% in the rookie mode, then move on to pro, and eventually all-star. There's a similar thing for goal defense and aerial shots, too."
RocketLeague,3dypg9,sabrenation81,2,Mon Jul 20 20:27:08 2015 UTC,"I do aerial and defense any time I'm waiting for a match, just having the muscle memory can be killer."
RocketLeague,3dypg9,PM_ME_A_PM_PLEASE_PM,16,Tue Jul 21 13:28:18 2015 UTC,"Striker training.   Try to progress through all 3 levels. If you miss a shot repeat the round until you can do it three times in a row. Don't progress to the next level until you can get 100% on the current. You don't necessarily have to do this all at once, work at it. Each time you fire up the game, do at least one practice session trying to improve on your previous score. Trust me, it'll improve your scoring ability by a HUGE margin.   Oh and one more thing - don't ""cheat"" when they give you shots from awkward angles (i.e. don't circle around so you have a straight approach.) Think about how often you get a perfectly lined up shot vs. how often you're trying to chip a shot in from a ridiculously terrible angle while driving full speed. It is important that you learn to score from those weird angles."
RocketLeague,3dypg9,UnrealBlitZ,4,Mon Jul 20 21:48:38 2015 UTC,"It'll all come with more practice. Hitting the ball consistently has everything to do with your comfort with controls and understanding where the ball exactly is. If you want to get better do some training. Do random stuff you think you need to improve. Suck at aerials? Fly into the corners of the goal from random locations. Feel awkward when your flipped backwards? Practice in training mode applying offensive pressure only going backwards. Get creative, you know your weaknesses. Just don't ignore them.   Oh, and tactically it's all about being in the right spot at the right time. You say that's luck and that's true but a lot of it is also anticipation and probability. For instance, you're saying you're whiffing a lot. Honestly, when I hear that I'm thinking you're not sure when you can hit the ball and when you can't. This comes with practice but be smart about it in the mean time. If the ball is midfield don't bother making risky moves and potentially whiffing.  You let in a lot of garbage goals that way. Just get back in the crease and shut down any easy shots there. Maximize variance when behind, minimize variance when ahead."
RocketLeague,3dypg9,Ritushido,3,Mon Jul 20 20:44:16 2015 UTC,"Stop driving so fast. That was my biggest problem when I was learning last year. It is much more valuable to get a little baby touch on the ball, than no touch. Remember that you have brakes! Slow the game down and eventually the ball will come to you!  Also, don't chase the ball, like these ferret-things. You should, instead, position yourself in places where the ball is likely to go."
RocketLeague,3dypg9,Kinzata,2,Tue Jul 21 06:44:12 2015 UTC,Yeah I'm totally guilty of this. I don't utilise the brakes enough. Almost every replay I'm zooming off screen (after missing the ball) trying to defend or shoot.

RocketLeague,3dypg9,yoholmes,0,Tue Jul 21 15:56:29 2015 UTC,"Think ""should I hit the ball?"" before you think ""can I hit the ball?""  Be very wary of knocking the ball in front of your own net. Pretty much the only time this is a good idea is when you can hit it fast enough to clear to the opposite corner before any of your opponents show up.  If your teammate is in the opposing side's corner fighting for the ball, don't dive in after them. Hang back a bit and be ready to strike if they manage to center it.  If a fight for the ball is happening in your own corner, position yourself in the corner of your own net and get ready to knock it free along the side. If you're on the opposite side of the ball from your net, hitting the ball is generally going to end badly.   There should always be one player between the ball and your own net. Try to keep in mind where your teammates are located on the field,  and if there's no teammate between the ball and your net, drop back to take that position. In general the furthest person back should always be playing a defensive role, and watching for opportunities to snipe the ball if it's knocked clear of the play."

RocketLeague,3e38aa,Killjoy4eva,3,Tue Jul 21 17:26:49 2015 UTC,Yup. It lets you barrel roll in the air. Helps you land upright on short jumps.

RocketLeague,3e5u7u,Freekie,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:39:53 2015 UTC,"There's no definite answer.  You want to switch between offensive and defensive.  If you see an opportunity to hit the ball and make a play do it.  If you're mindlessly chasing the ball without considering if it gets loose its a free goal, you should have been defensive at that time.    I'd say, play defensive until an opportunity arises.  But before that, stop any play they make before it gets too close.    As far as overtimes, I see way too many teams go overly defensive because the sudden death terrifies them, but it weakens their threat and eventually youll make one in.  Just be consistent I'd say"
RocketLeague,3e5u3l,pumpkinbundtcake,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:38:42 2015 UTC,"If you double tap jump (for me its right click), to do a quick flip without boost, you gain a lot of speed.  Do it over and over.  Try it in pratice"

RocketLeague,3e3kxx,SeeScottRock,8,Tue Jul 21 18:13:39 2015 UTC,"Judge the speed of the ball - do you even want to go for it?  Will you hit it in a direction that will help your team?  These are things that you should be thinking about before even going for the ball.  If you do decide to go for it and it is hoving above you, try turning off your ball-cam(if you have it on) and looking at just the circle that will show where it lands.  If you had a good estimate of the speed along with the graphic on the ground that shows you how close to the the ground, you can double jump into the ball and get a solid hit.  It really comes down to eyeing the ball and the speed, and timing your hit with the circle on the ground, NOT the ball only. As for bicycle kicks, you need to be reversing for awhile or chain together a couple of back flips to get the ball moving quickly."
RocketLeague,3e3kxx,saywhattyall,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:29:48 2015 UTC,"Thanks, this gives me something to work on!"
RocketLeague,3e3kxx,Evil_phd,3,Tue Jul 21 18:33:01 2015 UTC,If an aerial doesn't seem realistic I usually go a little past it and try to hit it with a reverse jump.
RocketLeague,3e3kxx,Gyoin,2,Tue Jul 21 18:21:32 2015 UTC,"That's what I was considering. It is tricky when I'm right at my own goal line though. Retreating basically concedes a goal, advancing puts me in the wrong spot."
RocketLeague,3e3kxx,fireb0rnMC,2,Tue Jul 21 18:23:42 2015 UTC,"Sometimes this is when you should move back, grab some boosts if you're not full, and be ready to react for where it lands next. If you're in a 3v3 and you see 3 of their team waiting for the ball and 2 of your teammates, let them duke it out. While they are all recovering from the aerial battle, you go after where the ball is heading and then put it into position (or defend for the lucky stray goal!)"
RocketLeague,3e3kxx,McWetty,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:51:52 2015 UTC,"You are probably not mistiming your bicycle hits, your car just needs some speed in order to actually hit the ball hard.   If you are directly under the ball, you are generally not going to get a good hit on it. At lower levels of play, you typically don't have the ball-handling skill to bounce it properly, and other players will be crowding around you, rendering you unable to do much. At higher levels of play, people who are farther away will be able to easily aerial it and push it towards your net, while you are not in position to effectively stop them, as you can only really hit the ball straight up.  The most effective thing to do when you're in the situation is generally to reverse your camera (look backwards, to avoid hitting a teammate), and reverse backflip till you're in a good position. Just avoid this situation as much as you can.  If the ball is at your goal and above you (so you're actually in position), be patient and watch for players going for aerials. Try to back up a bit if you can to get into a better position to hit the ball. If you see someone going for an aerial, try to aerial hit the ball directly up or away. If nobody goes for one, just wait until you can ground hit it away. In aerial situations like this, a lot of the time everyone will just whiff and give you a free clear, so if you're not confident that you can aerial clear it, it's often a good idea to just be patient and wait. Some of the shots in all-star goalie practice are helpful for these situations."

I decided to play 1v1 ladder and it put me back down to the bottom with rookies, but none of them had even basic mechanics of the game down and games didn't become competitive until I reached 700ish range. Perhaps just a games played stat.  50 games played before ranked is what Town of Salem does."
RocketLeague,3e5m0g,AllstarIV,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:46:13 2015 UTC,"I'd agree. Especially with matches only being 5 minutes, you can set a relatively high threshold for matches won and it won't be a huge time sink. The entry level will still be quite low, but it would most likely be a better transition into the ""more competitive"" side of the game.   EDIT: To add onto this, I'm level 25, and while I'm by no means a great player, I'm also not incompetent. I just decided to try out 1v1 Ranked for the first time. I ended up winning 10-1. This wasn't very fun for me, and I can't imagine it was much fun for my opponent either. Obviously it's hard to avoid the growing pains of getting up to an accurate rank, but maybe your ""Level"" could be taken into account for low ranked games. I have played doubles and triples ranked, but never stepped into duels, and assuming that everyone will equally play each ladder is slightly ridiculous. So the idea that a high-level player is grossly misrepresented by rank is entirely realistic."

RocketLeague,3dy02g,fredrikpedersen,15,Mon Jul 20 15:17:54 2015 UTC,They're pretty much impossible to block if you can't sideswipe or have a guy on the other side of it xD
RocketLeague,3dy02g,JBurd67,11,Mon Jul 20 15:25:18 2015 UTC,Or have someone who's really good at flying already in the goal. Pretty much impossible if there's no one waiting for the shot.
RocketLeague,3dy02g,mister-la,22,Mon Jul 20 15:26:21 2015 UTC,"There's a practice shot just like that in goalkeeper training. I failed it many, many times."
RocketLeague,3dy02g,JBurd67,18,Mon Jul 20 15:28:08 2015 UTC,"The goalkeeper training can be pretty difficult. I've managed to block every shot at least once. It may have taken 10-20 tries, but I got it eventually. Definitely practice blocking those long rainbows though! I wish you could set it up so you could pick a certain shot you want and block a variety of those."
RocketLeague,3dy02g,caltas,3,Mon Jul 20 15:32:22 2015 UTC,Yeah that would be great! Did you try the jump training with the highest difficult? Its extremely difficult :D
RocketLeague,3dy02g,JBurd67,5,Mon Jul 20 16:14:32 2015 UTC,"The aerial training, I assume...YES. Man, that's tough. The timing and angle you need to get is just crazy. I think I've gotten one of those 10 shots in :/"
RocketLeague,3dy02g,icemountainisnextome,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:21:07 2015 UTC,"I just did the aerial training this morning just to get that achievement,  0/10 scored. Seems like every time I go airborne for a hit I fail miserably"
RocketLeague,3dy02g,Deathwalkx,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:15:57 2015 UTC,I think it's easier to not use the ball cam for the aerial training.
RocketLeague,3dy02g,James_Keenan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:05:32 2015 UTC,"I think you're right, simply because for most of the shots all you need to do is go straight, however I think it might be bad practice."
RocketLeague,3dy02g,JBurd67,3,Tue Jul 21 10:21:40 2015 UTC,"Just go through the training, and when it's one of the shots you want to block, just keep hitting R1 over and over. It resets the shot, even if you made it. Don't know what the command is for PC, and remember that you have to reset before it moves on to the next shot."
RocketLeague,3dy02g,NuklearFerret,2,Mon Jul 20 18:31:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but that's just the same exact shot over and over. It's be nice to have it from different angles"
RocketLeague,3dy02g,JBurd67,2,Mon Jul 20 18:57:18 2015 UTC,"It'd be nice if they had categories, like ""grounders, bouncers, aerials,"" instead of just difficulty scales."
RocketLeague,3dy02g,Xeneron,2,Mon Jul 20 20:24:59 2015 UTC,"See, this is what happens when you make the training in a game too beneficial. People complain about how much better it could be.  I love the training, it's very helpful. But we could customize it a little more, that would really put it over the top."
RocketLeague,3dy02g,DreaMTime_Psychonaut,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:29:09 2015 UTC,I think the shot in this gif actually looked low enough to set up sideways and get a standstill double jump to deflect. I don't think you'd need to fly to necessarily save it.
RocketLeague,3dy02g,tagsrdumb,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:08:54 2015 UTC,The number of people who don't know how to barrel roll in this game blows my mind.
RocketLeague,3dy02g,fayettevillainjd,31,Tue Jul 21 06:56:54 2015 UTC,"I see you made the save, I dont argue with that at all. But my problem is you got zero credit for it. There are alot of games where someone is breaking away midfield and you can save a goal or shot and you do, but there are no points associated with that. Here, you blatantly made a save and there were no points awarded to you.  I feel like there are games where I 100% contributed and help secure the win but Ive got 90 points and no saves, assists or goals.  Especially those long assists. It seems like the window for an assist needs to be broadened as well. Just thoughts"
RocketLeague,3dy02g,tagsrdumb,17,Mon Jul 20 16:45:05 2015 UTC,"they give you points for saves and epic saves, but if you block it too far from the goal, it just doesn't register as such."
RocketLeague,3dy02g,fayettevillainjd,7,Mon Jul 20 16:56:23 2015 UTC,"He was just outside the goalie's area with no one behind him to make the save. That ball would have been in if not for him, that is a save in my book.   How does regular soccer define this?"
RocketLeague,3dy02g,tagsrdumb,19,Mon Jul 20 16:59:14 2015 UTC,"regular soccer only credits goalies with saves iirc. It's not that it wasn't a save, its that the devs have to draw a line somewhere or else people could be making 'saves' at midfield."
RocketLeague,3dy02g,trawlinimnottrawlin,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:09:28 2015 UTC,"I would think as complex as the code for a game is, that the game engine could recognize if contact with the ball put it on a path that would result in a point scored, then if you interrupt that path it should result in a save, not just when you are within the goalie's area.  Also am I the only one who gets alot of ""Center"" credit when it should have been a save?"
RocketLeague,3dy02g,Tigerbot,10,Mon Jul 20 17:44:08 2015 UTC,"Well, imagine the initial hit. Both players are moving forwards towards the goal; the first person to hit the ball would almost always put the ball in a trajectory to score, until it's blocked a fraction of a second later. Basically, there would be like a million shots that would score but get deflected right away."
RocketLeague,3dy02g,tagsrdumb,4,Mon Jul 20 17:59:23 2015 UTC,"The game DOES recognize if the ball was going to go in, but you have to have a cutoff somewhere. Say your at the other team's goal and their goalie nudges the ball towards your goal. Given enough time it will roll across the field and go in your goal, but that's going to take 10 seconds and so of course someone hits it away while it's still leaving the other team's box. That should not be a save in any way.  So what the code most likely says is either ""Is the ball x distance away from the goal?"" or ""Is the ball x seconds away from going into the goal?"". If the answer is yes and the ball was on a path to a goal then it's a save. Other than having the most complex AI every built that's really the only way to do it."
RocketLeague,3dy02g,RayGillGumm,0,Mon Jul 20 19:43:57 2015 UTC,"So I'd say expand the distance/time you allow the ball to travel and still grant an assist, AND increase the distance away from the goal that constitutes a save. Not all the way to the other end of the stadium in the case of goal/save (not even mid field) and not a ludicrous amount of time for the assists, but i feel like a good deal of help is going unrewarded."
RocketLeague,3dy02g,UMVH5,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:03:35 2015 UTC,"How does regular soccer define this?   It doesn't. Soccer is not a statistically minded sport. In the last twenty years or so, people have tried to impose more statistics on the game, but it doesn't really work, and there is very little consensus on how to record most statistics. At the top level, there's usually several groups of statisticians recording data from a match (Carling Opta, bookmakers, ESPN, etc), and their opinions almost never match up."
RocketLeague,3dy02g,MXVZ,8,Mon Jul 20 22:59:13 2015 UTC,"He probably did. Notice it doesn't show he got credit for a shot or a goal. I've noticed in a lot of gifs on this subreddit it doesn't show the credit, and that's because in replay mode it doesn't show it. I do agree though, the shot/save registry as well as assists are very random at times."
RocketLeague,3dy02g,NuklearFerret,3,Mon Jul 20 17:27:08 2015 UTC,"Hah, just said the same thing above.  I used the games replay to share this, not just the PS4's."
RocketLeague,3dy02g,tagsrdumb,4,Mon Jul 20 17:36:11 2015 UTC,"I don't think that shot was going to become a goal, I think the ball was headed to the right corner. Because usually you get the points making a save."
RocketLeague,3dy02g,NuklearFerret,2,Mon Jul 20 17:02:58 2015 UTC,"This was taken from the games saved replay, then I used PS4 to share it the next day.  It appears the Rocket League saved replay doesn't show the popups, or I disabled them somehow.  It doesn't even say my name when I scored.  So I likely did get credit for the save, it just didn't transfer."
RocketLeague,3dy02g,rabidpiano86,2,Mon Jul 20 17:35:13 2015 UTC,"In order for a shot to be considered a shot, it has to enter ""the paint,"" (for lack of what its actually called) and for a save to be counted, it has to prevent a ""shot on goal"" from going in. Not saying its a good system, just illustrating where the game's lines are.  ""The paint"" is also relevant for ball clearing credit, as well."
RocketLeague,3dy02g,Persistentlife,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:29:05 2015 UTC,"This makes EXCELLENT sense. So what would the drawbacks be to expanding the area defined as ""the paint"" or expanding the definition of a shot on goal?"
RocketLeague,3dy02g,codeByNumber,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:40:53 2015 UTC,"I have no idea. The only thing I can think would be to award points for tackling or turnover, but the ball juggles between players so frequently that I don't think this would be practical. Having a demarcation line for shots is good since without it, a pass or minor deflection in midfield or defender's area could be considered a shot, regardless of the intent or realistic potential to result in a goal.  At least RL is more generous than soccer when it comes to Shot on Goal credit. In RL, hitting a post or getting close to the goal can still count as a shot on goal, while MLS only counts shots as those which would have gone in if not for opponent intervention. So, hitting the post doesn't count."
RocketLeague,3dy02g,mrshiznitz,10,Mon Jul 20 21:10:55 2015 UTC,Noooo! $#&%! OMG!
RocketLeague,3dy02g,codeByNumber,4,Mon Jul 20 16:16:12 2015 UTC,Very nice save and shot! This game has gone far beyond my expectation. So fun! Possibly the most fun I have had on Ps4 to date.
RocketLeague,3dy02g,Persistentlife,6,Mon Jul 20 15:29:05 2015 UTC,"Agreed, it's nice to have a game where if you only have 30 minutes or so to play you can get a couple games in too.  Also my wife doesn't get pissed if my kids see me playing this, compared to the normal shoot 'em up and kill 'em all type games."
RocketLeague,3dy02g,Ciaran1892,12,Mon Jul 20 15:31:30 2015 UTC,"Yet, if the kids and wife are asleep this game can easily keep you entertained until 2am (oops).   ...""Just one more match, can't finish on a loss.""  wins game  ""...I can't stop now, I'm on a roll!"""

RocketLeague,3dy02g,Notorious_Satchel,3,Mon Jul 20 15:39:20 2015 UTC,How do I do that jump manoeuvre you did to hit the ball? (Bit of a noob)
RocketLeague,3dy02g,tuks6,4,Mon Jul 20 17:11:26 2015 UTC,"That was just a forward flip. That and a ton more gameplay tips are in the training, which every new player should play through."
RocketLeague,3dy02g,Notorious_Satchel,2,Mon Jul 20 17:20:05 2015 UTC,Just hold up when you hit the jump button a second time.  Go check out the training.

RocketLeague,3dy02g,TheTREEEEESMan,2,Mon Jul 20 18:22:54 2015 UTC,What do people mean by clutch? Seeing it more and more on this sub.
RocketLeague,3dy02g,istealthbro,2,Mon Jul 20 21:34:30 2015 UTC,It means to come through for your team when they really need it. Succeeding in a situation that has more meaning than usual. Like scoring when your down by one goal with 5 seconds left
RocketLeague,3dy02g,fayettevillainjd,2,Mon Jul 20 22:00:08 2015 UTC,Does anyone know where it originated from? It doesn't make sense in the context of a car's clutch or anything I can think of.
RocketLeague,3dy02g,RedPhoenix122,3,Tue Jul 21 02:22:01 2015 UTC,"I believe it is to do with ""to grasp or seize"".  Having evolved through sport where players made seemingly improbable catches or saves, usually at the last second, resulting in a score or win.  Eventually this led to a usage where it is used in places where;   Being or occurring in a tense or critical situation: ""won the championship by sinking a clutch putt."" Tending to be successful in tense or critical situations: ""The coach relied on her clutch pitcher."" Or the idiom: ""to clutch at straws"": ""To search in desperation for a solution to a difficulty."""

RocketLeague,3dy02g,kamikazeguy,8,Tue Jul 21 12:21:53 2015 UTC,"so the clock ran out way before that went in.  I've noticed that sometimes it stops the game as soon as the clock runs out, and sometimes it allows a little lag at the end.  Is the game doing that on purpose to allow last second buzzer beaters?"
RocketLeague,3dy02g,Gyoin,24,Mon Jul 20 16:57:28 2015 UTC,"It's intentional.  The game doesn't end until the ball hits the ground.  So if you can juggle the ball in the air, the game won't end."

RocketLeague,3dyqnz,ilikewc3,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:34:36 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry, but how does this need to be pointed out? So many people in my games just point themselves at where the ball is now. Do you guys understand how physics and time works?"
RocketLeague,3dyqnz,IAMBollock,2,Tue Jul 21 13:30:15 2015 UTC,"Think it's just because a lot people aren't used to these kind of physics in computer games,  takes a while to adjust."
RocketLeague,3dyqnz,ilikewc3,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:28:44 2015 UTC,"Like he said, it's common sense, but it doesn't click for beginners."
RocketLeague,3dyqnz,IAMBollock,0,Tue Jul 21 19:18:07 2015 UTC,Then those beginners don't have common sense.
RocketLeague,3dyqnz,lonjaxson,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:25:23 2015 UTC,So nearly everyone who plays this game for the first time has no common sense then? Cool.
RocketLeague,3dyqnz,MustWarn0thers,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:54:30 2015 UTC,"No, I think most people get that if you want to hit the ball you have to attack the area it's going to. I just thought it was funny how you agreed that it was common sense yet said some beginners didn't get it, therefore those people lack common sense."
RocketLeague,3dyqnz,0XGY,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:13:03 2015 UTC,"When doing aerial training, I had this realization. My hit ratio jumped quite a few points. Track the trajectory and then all you gotta worry about is timing"
RocketLeague,3dyqnz,MustWarn0thers,6,Tue Jul 21 16:41:15 2015 UTC,"Aerials seem like such a bitch on PC. Unless I get a controller, you have to let off the gas in order to jump and then use ""reverse"" to get lift with your booster. PC master race and all, but fuck if that isn't annoying."
RocketLeague,3dyqnz,0XGY,11,Mon Jul 20 23:45:09 2015 UTC,this game is like impossible without a controller (speaking as a pc player myself). Even psyonix recommends you get a controller for pc.
RocketLeague,3dyqnz,Gent-,7,Tue Jul 21 01:25:52 2015 UTC,Which works best/is easiest? Can I use an Xbox controller?
RocketLeague,3dyqnz,KennyDaFinn,4,Tue Jul 21 01:43:55 2015 UTC,yeah should work fine
RocketLeague,3dyqnz,The_Poo_Kazoo,3,Tue Jul 21 01:51:05 2015 UTC,"Get a wired Xbox 360 controller.   Do not get an Xbox one controller. The Micro USB connection on it is really shitty. I don't know who the engineer was that designed it, but it is absolutely shit. My controller disconnects unless I keep it really still which is hard with an intense game like this."
RocketLeague,3dyqnz,Gent-,2,Tue Jul 21 02:23:36 2015 UTC,That sounds like it might be a specific problem with your as my controller works perfectly.
RocketLeague,3dyqnz,CroSSGunS,2,Tue Jul 21 03:28:00 2015 UTC,Yes definitely an individual problem.  My also works flawlessly.
RocketLeague,3dyqnz,Richard__Rahl,2,Tue Jul 21 05:40:54 2015 UTC,Now I am sad.
RocketLeague,3dyqnz,tabgrab23,2,Tue Jul 21 11:06:05 2015 UTC,PS4 controllers work directly also.

RocketLeague,3dyqnz,TheRingshifter,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:42:43 2015 UTC,PS3 works as well. You have to install 360 controller and Scarlet.crush drivers to get the controls mapped correctly.
RocketLeague,3dyqnz,Gent-,2,Tue Jul 21 11:55:54 2015 UTC,Contact Microsoft Support and there's a good chance they will replace it for free.  They are usually pretty good about this kind of thing.  They want to make their customers happy.
RocketLeague,3dyqnz,TheRingshifter,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:41:33 2015 UTC,"Mine works fine. And even if the connector is shit, really shouldn't be a big problem... microUSB-to-USB connectors aren't exactly rare.  For this game, XBOX360 controller is probably just as good as XBOX ONE but I really recommend XBOX ONE because the XBOX 360's d-pad is the most ungodly thing to ever blight a controller."
RocketLeague,3dyqnz,ilikewc3,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:59:33 2015 UTC,It's the port on the controller that gives me problems.

RocketLeague,3dyqnz,CrustyCracklyTowel,2,Mon Jul 20 18:50:48 2015 UTC,I have them too
RocketLeague,3dyqnz,fooentes,2,Mon Jul 20 18:05:49 2015 UTC,but not sure I still get it. Is the trick to a long Ariel like this mainly rocket boost? Jump and    Rocket Boost and angle of the car.  Just takes practice to get it right.
RocketLeague,3dyqnz,Bendrake,3,Mon Jul 20 19:00:49 2015 UTC,"Even if it was your goal it's still awesome. Wrong place, right time"
RocketLeague,3dyqnz,Bendrake,2,Mon Jul 20 20:33:37 2015 UTC,"I love attempting these, but usually just zoom past the ball by about an inch :'D"
RocketLeague,3dyqnz,Iupin86,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:16:14 2015 UTC,"That also happened to me. After spinning some times I got confused and scored an amazing (for my standards) short aerial into my own net. I cheered at first, but than realised it was an own goal. What a shame"
RocketLeague,3dyqnz,PlatypusRuleTheWorld,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:13:10 2015 UTC,Why don't all arial hits count as such?  Nothing popped up showing that for you.

RocketLeague,3e52t7,equinoxninja,5,Wed Jul 22 00:46:06 2015 UTC,"I think that the only difference between cars is the size of their hit boxes (by a pretty small amount).  Acceleration, turning radius and all other stats are the same."
RocketLeague,3e0l69,Jilberto,44,Tue Jul 21 01:05:15 2015 UTC,"I think the biggest thing psyonix needs to add to the game as soon as possible is spectator mode. It will make hosting tournaments infinitely easier, and more entertaining to watch. Imagine the broadcast crew having the ability to rewind time and place the camera anywhere!"

RocketLeague,3e0l69,krozzin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:43:42 2015 UTC,Even if it was just limited to private games i'd love to have a game at 50% speed with friends.
RocketLeague,3e0l69,CivilityBeDamned,13,Tue Jul 21 07:12:42 2015 UTC,Basically everything you just said is already in the suggestion thread.
RocketLeague,3e0l69,hunterman12345,27,Tue Jul 21 11:17:07 2015 UTC,"I agree with all your points here I think they are very valid. The game is great as it is right now, but once the initial craze has died down it will stay down. There's nothing really keeping players active besides gameplay itself and even then after several hundred hours it gets repetitive.   There needs to be something people can work for such as your idea of cosmetics and more unlocks. I would like to see this because not only will the devs make more money with people buying them but people will also have the incentive to play more and more with the hopes of randomly unlocking something they want."
RocketLeague,3e0l69,sleepingpie,4,Tue Jul 21 01:22:55 2015 UTC,"Exactly, imagine if people could make ""collections"" of items and put them in a crate. Crate is a buck OR every 5 levels you level up you get one. Maybe if thats not the way to do it maybe the only way to get a certain case is by buying it, and there's different ones to get for leveling. People love showing off things others don't have. Like imagine if there were, super rare car models. People would love to have them and would play with the goal of maybe having that one day. I do find the amount of cosmetics in Rocket League right now kinda low. Like yeah there's a ""fair"" amount. But there needs to be alot, and if the devs don't want to do it. Let the community do it. Rocket League is at it's craze stage, it NEEDS to stay relevant."
RocketLeague,3e0l69,DullLelouch,2,Tue Jul 21 01:27:15 2015 UTC,Or do a rarity thing like csgo or tf2 has going
RocketLeague,3e0l69,VelcroSnake,28,Tue Jul 21 14:52:58 2015 UTC,So basicly.. All kind of stuff that has been suggested before in the suggestion thread? You've said nothing new..
RocketLeague,3e0l69,GoneBananas,2,Tue Jul 21 05:34:04 2015 UTC,Curse your infallible logic!
RocketLeague,3e0l69,LtSMASH324,13,Tue Jul 21 11:57:07 2015 UTC,"I agree. Since the gameplay is pretty well set, the financial model of this game will determine its staying power. Rocket League needs to make money in order to fund updates in order to have a lasting community.   Selling new game modes and maps risk fracturing the playerbase. I think cosmetic DLC is the way to go, with a drop system for this paid DLC and integration with the Steam Marketplace. I don't see why the financial models of TF2 and Dota 2 wouldn't work here.  I hope to see this game around in three years, because the gameplay feels so superb. The financial model will determine its longevity."
RocketLeague,3e0l69,electric_creamsicle,6,Tue Jul 21 03:06:24 2015 UTC,"You don't NEED to charge for DLC to make money. Relogic has shown that if they just simply keep updating Terraria, they'll gain and keep player base, and still make money off of it. Not to mention, people will love you for it."
RocketLeague,3e0l69,LtSMASH324,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:45:06 2015 UTC,"Terraria doesn't have to maintain servers though as far as I know.  Servers are expensive, especially for a game with this many concurrent users.  They need more income than what they will be getting from new users a few months from now."
RocketLeague,3e0l69,PitaBread7,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:02:18 2015 UTC,You're right about that. Maybe the fact that they have to pay for servers puts them over the edge.
RocketLeague,3e0l69,Loghawkreddit,2,Tue Jul 21 17:53:16 2015 UTC,"I hope the devs make this choice, they have something good here with a lot of potential"
RocketLeague,3e0l69,VelcroSnake,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:51:16 2015 UTC,"This is precisely what I was going to suggest. Between the cartops, antanae, rocket trails, wheels, paint-jobs, and the car model itself, the limit is your imagination. Introducing such a model could highly benefit every party involved. Keep maps, and game modes free, with the occasional special event and people will be happy. Get cross platform parties working, and add a flexible in-game tournament builder and people will be playing for years."
RocketLeague,3e0l69,bonse,4,Tue Jul 21 05:30:50 2015 UTC,It has been out for such a little amount of time.
RocketLeague,3e0l69,Protatoooo,-9,Tue Jul 21 06:51:14 2015 UTC,It will slowly die out
RocketLeague,3e0l69,Aesyn,3,Tue Jul 21 06:55:08 2015 UTC,"Everything slowly dies out, unless it quickly dies out."
RocketLeague,3e0l69,Adam87,3,Tue Jul 21 11:59:26 2015 UTC,"Not true. CSGO was dead at first, then BOOM it took off and i think it's still on the climb isnt it?  but yeah, EVENTUALLY everything dies out"
RocketLeague,3e0l69,LordKwik,2,Tue Jul 21 12:29:37 2015 UTC,"SARPBC lasted for 6 years and it barely got any updates. Why did they stick around? Because of the endless depth it had. Rocket League doesn't need most of what you said. Constant updates are already a thing, the rest isn't necessary. The fun-factor and depth will make people stick around."
RocketLeague,3e0l69,Kablooey88,4,Tue Jul 21 12:15:38 2015 UTC,"Well, I guess I'm the only one who disagrees this game will die.  fighter games like SF doesn't give anything else except a solid gameplay either, still popular. While rocket league doesn't have an array of choices like fighter games do, as in different characters, it still has a really really high skill cap. Which will keep people busy. Many people stick to few characters anyway in fighter games to master them.  Also, as a comparison, this subreddit already has twice the subscriber /r/kappa has. or /r/streetfighter."
RocketLeague,3e0l69,mthelame,3,Tue Jul 21 12:35:44 2015 UTC,"I'm sure they have a plan for this. Still early, we will see near end of summer/fall."
RocketLeague,3e0l69,Flyingbuffaloman,-1,Tue Jul 21 04:53:54 2015 UTC,hopefully
RocketLeague,3e0l69,IJtrippin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:07:22 2015 UTC,They do. Read their AMA from 2.5 months ago. They talk about everything you mentioned except seasonal stuff iirc.
RocketLeague,3e0l69,Mermbone,3,Tue Jul 21 15:49:27 2015 UTC,"I just want to keep playing the game to get better, wouldn't matter to me if they added anything or not."
RocketLeague,3e0l69,electric_creamsicle,11,Tue Jul 21 11:57:37 2015 UTC,Thank god Psyonix has people here to provide them with extensive expertise gained from two weeks playing the game.  It's not like they have any experience designing and running a similar game over the past 7 years or anything.
RocketLeague,3e0l69,IamHunterish,13,Tue Jul 21 06:20:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, because SARPBC was soooo popular. Even the best designed games don't stay relevant forever without a little boost. OP is giving suggestions that have historically helped other games get big and stay big. Nothing particularly wrong with a small to medium playerbase but I think it'd be awesome if this game got huge."
RocketLeague,3e0l69,Protatoooo,2,Tue Jul 21 10:20:51 2015 UTC,"What we need is spectator mode, and other nifty tools to support those ESL / MLG / other tournaments so we can have people shoutcasting the games."
RocketLeague,3e0l69,durahan,2,Tue Jul 21 09:28:07 2015 UTC,"I like the idea of seasonal stuff and more game modes as well as DLC however i really dont want a ""trading system"" like CSGO. That may work for some games but definitely not for all."
RocketLeague,3e0l69,BlueBlurX,2,Tue Jul 21 13:52:03 2015 UTC,"They should follow the Team Fortress 2 model and keep the game pretty much the same (with a few balancing changes and bug fixes) while adding modes and cosmetics.  A power up mode, a 3+ team mode, keep em up mode, H.O.R.S.E. mode, etc would all be fun to play when normal games get a little stale.  If they're worried about income streams, they could sell dlc packs or ""crates""/"" crate keys"".  TF2 has proven people will pay plenty of money for things that don't help them play better.  Hell, I have probably spent ~$100 on TF2.  I would definitely spend more on specific cosmetics.  Especially if they are limited time exclusives.  The only problem is the lack of trading.  TF2 has a huge trading community and, while I don't want Rocket League servers to be taken up by traders, I think some sort of trading system could be very helpful to the longevity of the game."
RocketLeague,3e0l69,DroneCone,4,Tue Jul 21 15:56:14 2015 UTC,"Having more is not always the way. You mention dota 2 and cs go.. But you are forgetting the biggest game off all. League of Legends.. Where most action takes place on one map. Only things you need to pay for is for skins. The real thing that keeps players is gameplay and learning curve to keep getting better.  RL might need some decals, trails, toppers, cars etc you can buy or earn in game with points gatherd while playing."
RocketLeague,3e0l69,SomeRandomGuy921,6,Tue Jul 21 08:41:02 2015 UTC,Fully agree. Rocket League doesn't need most of this stuff to stay alive.
RocketLeague,3e0l69,ryannayr140,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:17:03 2015 UTC,"Something that will probably never happen, but I would LOVE to see is some kind of daily automated tournament system like they had in Warcraft 3: Frozen Throne.  Also, it would be nice if there was a ranked pre-made team 3v3 mode as well as the solo 3v3 mode."
RocketLeague,3e0l69,Sonicz7,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:46:07 2015 UTC,"I agree 100%. New game modes would add variety and lasting power to the game, new cosmetics that could be traded between players would give it a TF2 effect, basically making the developers money on a daily basis, and more stuff like spectator mode. All in all, Rocket League will last long if these things are added."
RocketLeague,3e0l69,Sonicz7,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:51:52 2015 UTC,I think paid for DLC is a certainty with this game. I got it for free and would be happy to pay a few quid for a couple of new cars and stuff.
RocketLeague,3e0l69,willyumv3,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:39:06 2015 UTC,"It probably needs a few more maps, too. Possibly even some features or modes that can cater to more casual players as well, but those should be sectioned off from the more competitive aspects of the game."
RocketLeague,3e0l69,sleepingpie,3,Tue Jul 21 08:20:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah even for regular maps, more would be cool. Or a map with a dip in the middle"

RocketLeague,3e0l69,OBOSM,2,Tue Jul 21 18:46:20 2015 UTC,"I don't personally agree with no.4 in regards to the gamemode with multiple teams. That's too much. It would likely mean that there would need to be square arenas with 4 goals. If that were to happen it would promote ganging up on one team. Say you are team A and you score on anyone B-D. The score is now 1-0-0-0. It isn't hard to imagine youd have 9 players (if its 3's) doing anything they can to stop you from scoring again. 9v3 just doesn't seem fair. Either that or it would be so chaotic it would feel like the winner was just picked out of a hat and everyone just waits for a lucky opportunity to strike.  If I had any suggestion it would be to find a fix for ranked. Bots are too good, it feels like they never fuck up. They come into normal when someone leaves and 2 minutes later they seem to always have like 3 goals. And ranked you cant add them in. So there have been times where my two teammates left for whatever reason, even in tied games so it leaves me 1v3...might as well just leave at that point. Idk what they can do to fix this but I see leavers all the time in normal and ranked."
RocketLeague,3e0l69,Garric_Shadowbane,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:33:24 2015 UTC,"Maybe instead of who scores the most it ends.up being who gets scored on the least, like a goal on your net counts for 1 point for you and you go on golf score"

RocketLeague,3e0l69,cartear,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:05:41 2015 UTC,"To add to point 1, achievement-locked gear would be even better. There's only one at the moment, and having more of them would greatly elongate the game. For example, why not lock the hardhat to an achievement for landing your car upside down a bunch, or lock the flames pattern to the turbocharger achievement (use boost for 5 minutes total), etc? Doesn't have to be silly achievements (because we all know where that would go; idiots flipping their car over and over, or boosting circles around the arena... even in ranked matches...), but it could also be for skillful play, like achievements for assists with aerials and whatnot."
RocketLeague,3e0l69,VelcroSnake,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:05:19 2015 UTC,"I was thinking very much the same in terms of longevity of the game. My main game is CS:GO. I have over 1k hours in it and want to play it every day. This game has been good to keep me from burning out on GO, which is something that happens from time to time for me. I've got 8 hours in 2 days and I'm having a blast playing, especially with some of my friends (play dota like i play GO)   I know a time will come when the want for GO is greater than the want for RL just like w/ DayZ, Nosgoth, Killing Floor and other games in a long steam catalog.  Maybe RL will be different?"
RocketLeague,3e0l69,cartear,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:21:22 2015 UTC,"All this game needs in my honest opinion is tournaments like the LCS is for LOL.  I can't play this game because of overaged computer, but I'd watch the shit out of a competitive pro scene every week..."

RocketLeague,3e4594,SairAerwyn,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:28:39 2015 UTC,Depends on the server for me. USE-Ratchet was the only one I had trouble with today (and it was absolutely terrible). I assume some sort of nuclear blast went off where ever that server is located.

RocketLeague,3e4q9y,Desirsar,2,Wed Jul 22 01:34:44 2015 UTC,There are a several country flags missing from the game... including several countries that have a massive amount of internet-connected citizens.  I'm not sure what criteria they had for adding flags.  I originally thought that they only added flags for countries where Playstation Network is available.  But when I was playing last night I noticed an Ivory Coast flag.  So there goes that theory.

They are even giving us free stuff, a free dlc as an apology. Know this game is new and are trying to implement servers that can cooperate with ps4 and pc. Be patient as not every match is a lag fest. #1 way to avoid lag is to play in your region only (I.e east, west, europe) . in response to Sorox"
RocketLeague,3e4pfg,Thizzy6,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:41:37 2015 UTC,"I understand thanks but I do not like buying games I can't play. I believe 2 weeks is plenty of time and thus my thread.  Yes, every match is a lag fest. The worst games I might as well be blindfolded and the best games feel like 200 ping. That is simply not acceptable. I can play great games for free with perfect ping. Games exactly like Rocket League in fact. Only they don't have invisible players playing all the time."

RocketLeague,3e4orz,Handicappedmoose,2,Tue Jul 21 22:52:41 2015 UTC,"There is typically one defensive specialist and two offensive specialists.  But those positions aren't typically set in stone, and the best teams will constantly rotate players into the different roles.  For example, if a defensive player goes on the offensive, then an offensive player will rotate back into a defensive position."

RocketLeague,3dz6fl,McRawffles,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:11:22 2015 UTC,The key to success as a goalie in RL is to assume that there's always going to be someone from the other team there to hit it though. Generally better to risk hitting that than let it drop.
