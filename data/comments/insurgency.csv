If you want it for yourself you can always download a skin from the workshop or even make your own and upload it.  For example, I downloaded the Hello Kitty skin for the AT4; that's not exactly most Insurgency players' cup of tea.

The problem with making vids on Insurgency is that it's not as easy to goof around as in other games (that makes for fun videos), like say Medal of Honour or Call of Duty or shit, like so many other youtubers do.  It's a serious game, and if you fuck around, you get killed.  I think most youtubers that play Insurgency probably do how-to vids or tips on it, guides almost, I don't think there's a lot of 'm that make it a humorous, fun game.   Insurgency's also not that hugely known to gamers as other games that youtubers start. So if you stick to Insurgency, you'll most likely appeal to a small niche of people, probably you'll find support within this sub if you find the right balance between interesting/funny/serious.

Deterring someone from doing well should never be case. I was given no explanation whatsoever, and I've even had a few teammates attempt to get answers. The main reason this annoyed me so much is because they're constantly populated throughout all hours of the day. It's either this or like fucking Ethiopia late at night.

insurgency,3dvkcy,DylanCN,31,Sun Jul 19 22:28:00 2015 UTC,"Ehh, it's really easy for a band of hostile players to overtake a server using the voting tool. As soon as they got a vote down and all swear that a player was ""teamkilling"" or ""trolling"", everyone will absentmindedly vote yes."

insurgency,3dvkcy,DylanCN,7,Sun Jul 19 23:49:51 2015 UTC,"Oh really? Because me and a friend of mine did it already, we were 2. I didn't want to admit it because I know it's in extremely poor form, but we essentially grieved and took control of a server by starting vote kicks for false reasons. A majority of players voted yes since they didn't really engage themselves in what happened, which is partly their fault, but who can expect every random player to act as a judge on a server when they really just want to play the game?  The incredible irony of all this is that it was actually an admin that stopped us. He was notified of our grieving and banned us.  It's not the community's job to police other players, that is ridiculous and everyone knows it. That is why servers with good and regular admins will always be more popular than ""democracies"". It just doesn't work in an online game where people are engaged in their own thing.  We were 2 people taking control of a 12-man firefight server. I still have a hostile comment on my profile from it."

insurgency,3dvkcy,KCIV,0,Mon Jul 20 01:46:44 2015 UTC,"The only reason you could do that was because of the majority of people being uneducated and allowing you to be abusive. Auto voting yes on something you know nothing about IS the definition of uneducated. Democracy only works when people take the time to make informed and educated decisions. INS right now is ""herd the sheep"".  its the community job to not auto yes vote. As long as the community ALLOWS you to be abusive. Then yes you can be abusive.  Again its people who auto vote MORE than it is the one starting the vote.  I prefer the admin system. WHEN the admin system is not filled with power tripping kids. However, I prefer the admin system because The average player Consistently allows abuse. I have played in communities where the average player was extremely educated and smart. and an admin was not needed."
insurgency,3dvkcy,DylanCN,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:04:47 2015 UTC,"The community hardly auto-voted yes. That was the point of me having my friend along. I would call foul and my friend (who everyone thought was a random) would back me up. What's a common player to do in that situation? Vote no? What of the claims were true? They have literally NO way to investigate other than ""he said she said"", and furthermore we shouldn't expect them to educate themselves. No one wants to do that when starting a game. Admins have far more information at their disposal when making these decisions and are 1000x more qualified to do so. It comes with the risk of a few bad apples, but in the end they'll be shamed on this subreddit (as is happening right now)."
insurgency,3dvkcy,KCIV,0,Mon Jul 20 02:40:08 2015 UTC,"A.) you don't HAVE to vote yes just cuz 2 randos get on mic. To blindly trust a 1 time situation is not smart. Because a smart person doesn't just listen to the FIRST person to use a mic. A smart person thinks critically about the situation. Which I am claiming is UNCOMMON with average communities in INS. (thus the auto vote and auto kick people PLUS the ""lets be shitty for fun!"")  B.) wait and see if the issue re-occurs before voting.  C.) be smart enough to not be fooled by booolshit.  Also an admin listening to 2 idiots make false claims to get there jimmies off is the exact same as a random player with that same information.  Frankly, you are apart of the problem. The ""point"" you and your friends made was that more people do shitty things and like getting away with it. If you tried that shit on a good server with a good community, YOU would be vote kicked. Trust me, Try doing that on HH server when its 50% comp guys."
insurgency,3dvkcy,DylanCN,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:44:47 2015 UTC,"Lol calm down.  All I'm saying is, this system has worked for every source game before it. What you're proposing is so radically impossible. My point is that in this online game no one's going to think twice about voting yes once a vote's off. I've admitted to abusing this before with a friend and admitted the only thing that stopped me was an admin. This system with combination of vote kicks and admins has worked so well, I don't get your problem with it. Sure there are a few bad players, they get banned, and a few bad admins who get shamed on here. But all in all this is probably the best solution.  Finally, most servers don't have ""good communities"". They mostly just consist of ransoms who just want to play a game. I think your insistence on suddenly giving them a ton of responsibility is unreasonable and would only serve to deter new players from trying this game out."
insurgency,3dvkcy,KCIV,0,Mon Jul 20 02:52:07 2015 UTC,"My point, Is that abuse can only happen if people act in uneducated ways. Admins are not needed IF people were not shit.  people are shit = need of admins  People are not shit = don't need admins.  Nothing you have said disproves this. I don't disagree that there is more shit than good communities. However, That doesn't change the true reason vote kick abuse/ power tripping admins exists."

insurgency,3dvftg,TheRedViperOfPrague,4,Sun Jul 19 21:20:50 2015 UTC,"What I like about CS:GO for example is the ability for multiple player spraydown (i.e. 2 players are shooting at you but because your spray control/aim/aim adjustment is better, you manage to spray them down before you die). Obviously this is mitigated by INS letting you die quickly. Now, I LIKE that you die quickly. But to me, it takes away from the skill cap, if you know what I mean.   Ah yes, the TTK. Since several hits is overkill, sustained aim is less important, as are headshots. (IMHO the sweet spot for TTK is a bit higher, and with non-instant death from non-crit hits.) Due to the ultra-low TTK, being very close or enfilade with a teammate in comp is extremely dangerous, since a player can wipe them all extremely quickly. You can ""multi-player spraydown"" as you say if your opponents don't get shots on you, and this happens in comp if a team screws up and gets clustered. In practice, due to this risk, this just means there are more 1v1 encounters, and larger encounters at a high level usually involve all the people being at very different angles.   CS has a CLEAR distinction between skilled and unskilled players. A 5v5 (or even the casual 10v10) can be a 16-0, 16-2 something game (CS is played first to 16, maximum of 30 rounds + overtime) if one of the teams is clearly better. At the same time, a single player can also carry the team to victory if he's playing way above the opponent's skill level.   This is certainly the case in comp INS (DGL scene in my case, with Matches, Scrims, and PUGs). Although the highly skilled players can be killed with a single shot, they can also instagib less skilled/practiced/experienced players pretty reliably. The differences between teams is very clear, and there's not a whole lot of randomness. Most teams will reliably win a certain amount, the differences between PUG teams, and teams at the different levels are clear. A top team will reliably 9-0 or 9-1 a less experienced team, absolutely, and with two top teams facing off, the matches are consistently fairly close.   So basically what I'm asking is: in competitive INS, is the only difference in the tactics utilized, or is there some sort of mechanical play that I am missing by playing on public servers (be it movement, aim, grenade use, whatever)?    Prenades Prefiring Extreme wallbanging Distracting fire/noise close suppression and overwatch coordinated smoke and flash use Thoughtful positioning Pie-slicing The 4 F's (Find, Fix, Flank, Finish) Holding caps in reserve at 95% so you can instantly bring back a teammate that dies while rushing Intricate fakeouts and intense cap-blocking, coordinated clearing of points Kill counting (minus one, minus two...) Timed pushes Intentionally holding fire to bait people out and trap them Faking movements by making noise then backtracking Having intricate ""plays"" pre-planned Playing the 6th man Flanking opponents through their spawn Using named call-outs for almost every location Using strange map spots Constantly adapting to competitive metagame High-Yomi-Level play where the ""best"" play is known and may have a counter, so you may intentionally do something absurd/obvious/noobly because that's unexpected and allows you to exploit gaps, or maybe they expect you'll do the stupid direct move instead of the ""best"" one, so then you try other stuff, or fake the a certain play and do another, etc.   All that happens in DGL (and other comp leagues, I presume), I've done it, my team does it. We train often, it makes a difference, and we are reliably good due to it in both comp and pub play. This indicates a decent skill ceiling. I've seen some ridiculous players that push the envelope further, so yeah, it's not some low-cap RNG-fest where skill doesn't count much. People who kick ass relative to the norm in other games do similarly well in INS, further indicating skill actually makes a diff.  Source: I've played with S3, Casualty, and Veritas (D1, current ""top"" team), 950 hours of INS, lots of scrims and PUGs, etc. http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kate_UTL/  Get involved with the DGL scene and comp workshops, for sure. TS3 @ ins-ts.thedgl.org and there's steam groups as well.  EDIT: If you have any questions, ask away! I should also add that you can really feel the difference of high-skill opponents and teammates. There's a vast amount you can get away with vs newbs that harder teams won't let happen. With high-skill buddies/OPFOR the calls and call/response/rotation/backup/planning speed and quality increases a ton, and you can really feel it when you're trying to cap a point and need backup ASAP, or you're trying to pull off a series of flank kills where you're essentially trying to outrun the opponents' comms."

insurgency,3dvftg,burntcornflakes,3,Tue Jul 21 08:59:49 2015 UTC,"there are a surprising amount of similarities between the two games especially in a 5v5 format. insurgency is more about map placement so you can keep track of where the enemies are. and because its not 2 bomb sites you always have to keep as much control of the map as possible, as well as there being a lot more flanking routes. Competitive insurgency is about playing smart, having some quick aim, communicating with your team, and supporting one another is all you need to be successful. as you play you will learn good grenades all the nice spots, which spots people will play just like counter strike but there is more to look at."
insurgency,3dvftg,Tarpin,2,Mon Jul 20 09:04:18 2015 UTC,"Short answer to TL;DR of your post, OP: Yes. You will miss out on some aspects. Playing on clan-frequented servers, or even going into some competitive matches/scrimmages, will teach you some extra stuff.  Movement is interesting - go on Tell and there's a jump which you can make by doing an odd jump-crouch technique that seems unintuitive and difficult, but some people can do it easily (not jump-crouch like CS:GO, slightly more odd and luck-based). Weight is also important, you can see in many videos how people carrying barely anything will be able to avoid being shot by just being fast enough to not get spotted soon enough (like a ninja). Grenade use is, like others have said, also pretty important - you can see many long-time players hitting particular spots to cut off snipers' views or prevent rushes or pushes-through. Oh, and teams that are co-ordinated and just... 'good' will nearly always beat a less-prepared team in 5v5 competitive.  Though in my opinion, it's not great to compare CS and INS - the games strive for different things, as you probably know."
insurgency,3dvftg,SuicidalMG,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:01:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah - I don't want to compare them on a mechanic level or anything of the sort - what I'm interested is what I appreciate on CSGO the most (especially as a spectator) - and that's simply being able to recognize the immense amount of practice and skill in competitive (or in the case of CS, professional) players.  Glad to see that this is viable for INS, albeit probably a bit less on the individual level and rather on how well the team as a whole plays. Which is fine with me.  Now to go back to that sticky topic and figure out how to get in on this (:"
insurgency,3dvftg,BiIliam,3,Mon Jul 20 16:15:02 2015 UTC,"No there's no real mechanics to being good in competitive insurgency. Any moderately good FPS player will do fine. Tactics is 90% of competitive play, and it will show if you put a team of pub stars vs a div1 team. The only real mechanic I can think of that is heavily distinguished in comp play vs pubs is set nades."
insurgency,3dvftg,BiIliam,2,Sun Jul 19 22:58:32 2015 UTC,"Thanks, that's basically what I wanted to hear about.  How do the set nades work? In CSGO, you can learn specific spots to throw a smoke grenade from to cut off an enemy chokepoint so they can't pass through it before you get there (stopping any rushes), or vice versa, throwing smokes onto a contested site (akin to an objective in INS) from a safe place you can't be shot in, that allows you to easily move into the site.  Is that a similar thing? Or is it that you just sort of throw smokes at the back of sites (like B in most Firefight maps where it's usually very open from both sides) so enemies can't pick you off moving in? I.e. something that's usually done in pub plays anyway?  Curious to hear more about this because the bouncing mechanic and no easy way to line up grenade trajectories in INS never made me think about the possibility of set nades."
insurgency,3dvftg,KCIV,2,Mon Jul 20 06:57:36 2015 UTC,"There are set prenades that you line up to prevent rushes. You use the B diamond in the bottom and some reference point to line it up. For example, prenadeing balcony from window on security side on District. Or on Verticality you can prenade the Insurgent stairs from Security side before they come through.  For smokes you usually dont have the time to line up a perfect smoke, so you're just trying to hit a general area. An example on Verticality is you can throw a smoke from both sides into the side building door into the corner and it will smoke offf the entire building from seeing into street."

insurgency,3dvftg,KCIV,3,Sun Jul 19 23:01:05 2015 UTC,"That's why I'm asking. My experience is just the pubs, where more skilled players will only win 60% of the time, while in games like CS and Q3L the more skilled player will win 90% of the time.  I don't want this to be a criticism, I'm asking if comp INS is different to see if I should try out with a team or something."
insurgency,3dvftg,D3USN3X,3,Mon Jul 20 07:03:16 2015 UTC,"Comp insurgency is pretty good, and the most skilled team will win the majority of the time.  The issue is that matchmaking isn't as good when compared to CS:GO.  I've got over 300 hours in game, and I end up in lobbies with 10 hour players.  This may be a function of the smaller playerbase rather than the actual matchmaking, but either way, you'll end up in some lobbies where you'll ROLL.  The other side of the coin is that unless you have 5 you can play with regularly, you'll get some really green newbies that you'll have to carry.  That being said, if you play with a team and you communicate, you'll probably win 80% of matches, almost regardless of real skill level.  The matches I've been in can almost be predicted by the amount of communication."

The only ban appeals that come in are from players abusing the votekick system, which happens in every server where it's enabled.

If they asked you to change your name, but you did not comply, then it's perfectly ok for them to ban you.  Although I personally would've banned only you, but not your clan mates.  Edit:  Since I'm terribly downvoted I would like to explain my reasoning.  A couple of years ago I was an admin on a clan server in CS:S. Some people from an another clan joined and one of them had a recruiting tag in their name, so I politly asked him to change his name and he did. End of story.  If he wouldn't have changed his name, I would have banned him too, not for the tag, but for disobeying an admins command.   Clans can have multiple reasons to not like people representing other clans with recruiting tags.  One would be that it's simply the wrong place and time. Like getting engaged on another couples marriage. It's bad taste.   Another, that if there are some potential new members they would like to be the ones who gets them."

You know, I suppose the DGL's right in doing so if they want to remove all other skill from the game outside of map knowledge and twitch shooting. I think with no weapon restrictions on comp, there'd be a lot better cohesion and communication necessary with team mates.   Example: Guy with the RPG-7 needs to protected. M249 needs to be placed where it can lay down effective suppression. Sniper needs an area where he can effectively cover without exposing himself too much."

RPG guy can carry an AKM with AP at the same time, M249 can be used as an assault rifle with a bottomless mag, and snipers are probably the most useless class in a objective based game. I suppose the scope-fuckers might gain a bit more value in 5v5 when it's also viable to simply kill all of the enemy.  It is a twitch shooter, worse than most others because of the very tiny Time to Kill. NWI tried to make it a little less of a twitch shooter with the stamina and gun sway, but the negative feedback they made them remove it. I miss that gun sway, actually made the game challenging."
insurgency,3dswof,Woundedkneecap3,3,Sun Jul 19 09:44:07 2015 UTC,"RPG is a lot of weight which impairs your movement a great deal. Movement in a twitch shooter is a huge deal to your survival. M249 is the same way, but I do agree that it can be a bit OP. If snipers were really useless, they wouldn't be used at all. And if they do turn out to be useful, then that will force squads to develop tactics against them."
insurgency,3dswof,Diabeetush,4,Sun Jul 19 09:49:00 2015 UTC,"Snipers are used because every person at some point has though snipers are cool and that they want to play as one.

Shooting should not be a RNG micro puzzle ""guess the recoil to get your kill""  that is not good design. IF they added gun sway or increased recoil that could be learned (NOT CSGO but learned) then it would be good.  the issue is a real lack of critical analysis on the value and implications of ""new"" mechanics.

insurgency,3dt7ew,jihad_dildo,2,Tue Jul 21 05:15:14 2015 UTC,"It's an inherent problem with the source engine, and PC games in general.  The high degree of customization can allow some players to have slight advantages over other players.   A few examples include:   the Digital Vibrance setting on NVIDIA graphics cards, turning it up will increase contrast will allow you to spot enemies easier.  Turning up the brightness settings in game and on your monitor will allow you to see better on night maps, making night vision useless. Proof Motion blur is often disabled by players to make spotting enemies easier Most high-level Insurgency players will play at 110 FOV, which allows for a better peripheral view Having surround audio headphones will allow you to hear enemy footsteps easier. Playing with lower textures will make enemies easier to spot   Personally, I don't think this ""Pro-Tip"" is by any means more unfair than the list of things mentioned above. In other competitive games like CS:GO, players often change settings to find the one that gives them the most advantage. If anything needed to be done to level the playing field, changing how C-spotting should be the first thing on that list.   Furthermore, many players using minimal settings are already seeing less muzzle flash than those who set effect details to high, all I'm doing is suggesting that players that don't play on very low can do the same. Therefore, evening out the playing field."
insurgency,3dt7ew,Free_Mind,2,Mon Jul 20 03:42:00 2015 UTC,"I agree with /u/enfiende about the FOV, but to add to the discussion: generally a higer FOV is often more suitable for close-quarters combat (flankers) wheras lower FOV is better suited for longer ranges, as you will be ""closer"" to the weapon and will see what is directly in front you better. Guys and gals, just keep it to 90 and experiment around that number. And to those that think it's unfair because your rig can't handle a high FOV: a higher FOV is not always the best solution... I am on 100 and am considering reducing it to be better at longer ranges.  I disagree about the muzzle flash though... On low settings (what I play on), I can still easily see muzzle flashes, even on fairly high distances. I'm not sure about the flash really bothering my marksmanship though... I guess it can't hurt.   Also, about tweaking settings being an advantage... I don't see anything being an 'advantage' if all players can access them. All the tweaks you mentionned – to my knowledge – don't require much, if any, extra power. Any player is welcome to take advantage of these as long as they are in the vanilla game. Though I don't think these tweaks will help people as much as some might think it would..."
insurgency,3dt7ew,Kate_UTL,2,Mon Jul 20 14:23:43 2015 UTC,"I agree on your points mostly (you can do a lot with autoexec.exe, less than before though, thankfully), aside from FOV and surround headphones. (Also, c-spotting is off and pure is enabled on most ""serious"" servers that have fairness concerns.)  Extreme FOV like that is rarely needed (originally had 110, then 94, now 84) if you position yourself well and scan around sufficiently, while the constant zoom of sorts makes visibility better. Some excellent players roll with the lowest FOV possible and do well.  As for headphones, it's my understanding that ""surround"" headphones are pretty overrated, and I can hear and track people excellently with high-quality stereo headphones (AKG K7XX), without virtual surround or EQ tweaking, just clear high vol and windows loudness equalization on."
insurgency,3dt7ew,enfiende,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:37:56 2015 UTC,Just a small correction on the FOV. I do not find that most high-level insurgency players play with a super high FOV. I use 90 and I play competitively in the DGL and consider myself fairly decent at the game. I know a lot of the top skilled players in the game and far from all use a high FOV. I actually think v.Link (considered one of the best if not the best) has his FOV set even lower than 90. IMO 110 FOV makes the long shots more difficult and you should know where to look anyway so a wider view is not beneficial that often. A bit of topic there sorry.  About the original tip. I'd say keep it on high. Seeing the enemies muzzle flash will help you spot enemies a lot easier.
insurgency,3dt7ew,Clit_Eatwood,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:34:03 2015 UTC,"If you know where the enemies are going to go and you know where you are going, there is no need to have fov so high. This is why link and many others with lower fov settings are able to play with it despite the common thought that 'higher fov is more competitive'. To a good twitch shooter who has minimal map knowledge, higher fov is optimal so he can simply rely on reactions to get the shot, if you already know the map and the possible routes, why not give yourself a better picture of it and more control of your aim?  also  You can keybind a key to cycle fov exactly like i use in insurgency. It feels really cheap sometimes but you get the best of both worlds. bind ""key (i use v)"" ""toggle fov_desired 75 100"". Man i wish i could get back into ins comp."

RPG's, LMG's and other heavy weapons that would be difficult to maintain balance should follow the current mechanic. But what about pistols, MP5s or even an M16? Are you telling me that you can not fire a pistol while getting up...irl? I am not saying this individuals accuracy should not diminish when attempting to stand but I think this mechanic creates more of a balance to the individual that is prone, than it would a disadvantage to the player engaging the individual that is prone. So no, I wouldn't find it BS for someone to be able to get a kill while standing. Also just throw in this side note, I was active duty military...I promise you, you can fire a fully loaded M16 with one hand while standing from the prone position but not accurately though; and anyone else who may come across this thread can attest to that statement.  But I get it, we want to avoid individuals the ability to expose a mechanic and create a group of players that gets kills while, for example ""bunny hopping""; hence why you cant fire in mid-air, which I am ok with. So lets compromise, you can only fire while in the process of standing from the prone position if you're using your pistol."

It as a server setting defaulted to 'on' that can be turned off on well-moderated servers might be best if it was to be done. IDK about the resources required to do it. It'd reduce the amount of annoying stuff being done most likely though.  Another proposal I've heard is to invalidate AFK kick votes if the user has acted recently or is actiong in any way, and to invalidate TK votes if the player hasn't TK'd or done significant damage.

Team leader types GL/HF, gives an order via voice, throws out a flashbang so everyone can breach the first objective. Troll jumps around corner, gets team-flashed, starts kickvote.  Troll throws down smoke in front of defending people, throws down fire in front of advancing people, shoots the floor all around team-mates, flashes team 31 seconds into the round, dances around in your way, you name it. Has done none of the things you listed, can't be kicked for Trolling, but effectively is.   Only being able to kickvote once certain criteria have been met is pointless. Trolls will find ways to exploit the system while staying ""immune"" to the votes themselves. Combine this with the fact that you absolutely need at least one unconditional kickvote for special cases, this change to the voting system is 99% useless.   TL;DR: Nothing will be gained by this."
insurgency,3dk7fi,dynamite1985,3,Sat Jul 18 01:12:19 2015 UTC,"one idea i just had was to implement a set of criteria that makes a person eligible to be kicked.    IE) if there has not been a mouse or keyboard input for say, 3 minutes, then the person would automatically be eligible. Or if someone had 3 TKs in a round, they would be eligible for the votekick. And make it so that if the criteria is not met, they can't be votekicked out."

Some people can be griefing or just be cunts over voice/typing without meeting those criteria, and you want ot be able to kick people like that. An example of griefing would be following a teammate around shooting into the air(giving away position) or constantly running in front of him, meaning he can't shoot at enemies without TKing."

That doesn't seem fair to all the other teams involved.  There is a certain amount of pressure a clan faces to get prepared for a certain map/matchup, not to mention getting your 5 guys on board at the same time.  It is a test of your clan's ability to organize and prepare, and we're all expected to meet this expectation within the 7 day period.  It feels like you're getting special privileges when your clan is given extra time to get the game in, totally negating the pressure that the other clans in the division have hurdled.  It is bad enough that the guys running the tourney are also competing in it (possible bias/conflict of interest), this just adds to the doubt.  Everyone should be held to the same standard."

We try our best to help such teams in those times of distress. There is no money involved... yet... and until that time we will be flexible in such times of emergency. I'm sorry that this stresses you out and I'm glad you brought it to public opinion. I hope you talked directly to those involved before making such a post though.  Every small league is run by people playing it, why would someone run a league without profit that didn't play in it? Your doubt is doubt, we try to include all division 1 teams in the admin department to kill such accusations. One or two teams have felt this way in the past but when they actually talked to the community they found that they were wrong. We try to talk to every team but it's not always possible.

What if only 1 team was on board with postponing the game?  Lets say my team is available and ready for the week, but the other team can't get it together.  Are we obligated to make time for them and double up on games the following week?  What if we insist they forfeit, but you've already given another team a pass... What if that team has an admin on it and insist we give them an extension? What about the other clans in the division that got their games in in a timely matter? It just opens up all sorts of doubt when you bend the rules in my opinion.

Own had RL complications come up and were unable to make it which they let us know at least an hour in advance of the game. Technically we could have forfeited them and taken an easy win but no one on FGC was for it. It did actually complicate our schedule as everyone on FGC is a functioning adult with RL obligations and we had to find a time that we would all be ready again, but a cheap forfeit would defeat why we all play competitive INS, to compete. We all understood and just rescheduled, really not a big deal. It would only be unfair to the teams involved and no one was an asshole about it, we still have to play a game on monday even though we just played today- none of the other games in the season were affected by it.   On the topic of admins playing, I won't talk on Torix as he's my team captain, but Link who is team captain of a competing team in my division and I have zero grievances with that. Link is one of the top driving forces on why the DGL exists, without him this league might not exist anymore.

insurgency,3din5t,sadhukar,12,Thu Jul 16 16:02:35 2015 UTC,"All I am going to say (as this has been talked about to death)   it honestly comes down to how to define competitive, and how you define competitive to be played. There is enough successful history inside of INS and leagues to give a clear indication of what works. Competitive is not casual. They do not follow the same design or standard. INS was developed for 32 man servers, So applying a standard from 32 man servers directly into 5v5 is a mistake, As each ""cross over"" should be evaluated on merit for the respected modes.  for example, in 32 man servers you have a m249 gunner, But in competitive its rightly banned. same goes for 203's and RPG's as you can abuse them if they are given easily in every round. Each of those weapons is evaluated in the context of competitive rather than just directly ported for the sake of existence in another mode.  Its not a question of ""my opinion is truth"" but more ""here is my opinion, here are the facts, how many people agree, and who are those people"" type of deal.  I would also ask how much you play competitive, and if you have played in any leagues as those are sometimes the most relevant questions. You mention that you always thought 7v7 was better for CSGO and I think that more or less gives a context for your answer.  That answer being, I think you are looking for a competitive experience that is not necessarily reflected or wanted by the majority of existing competitive players/community. I would encourage you to find 16 man servers (8v8) or 24 man (12v12) for that experience. Trust me the last thing you want is 8 top level players on District. Squad is exploring these same issues and defining its ""comp"" style mode as a clan v clan mode so upwards of 12v12+. Squad however has mechanics and maps that accommodate that play VERY well. its important to note that squad ""comp"" as its being tagged is not about actual Competitive esport gameplay rather its simply a structure where preset teams can be pitted against other preset teams in competition. Competitive Hacky Sack is not the same as Competitive Paintball. They each carry the same word identifier but carry a whole other meaning."

insurgency,3din5t,KCIV,5,Thu Jul 16 16:30:07 2015 UTC,"Well specifically Insurgency as that is what you are discussing, Experience with 5v5 in INS is relevant when offering criticism. But Experience with Leagues or at least good ranking in CSGO is also relevant.    It does not add or remove credibility however Someone who is allergic to chicken is not going to like chicken sandwiches. It's an important context."
insurgency,3din5t,KCIV,2,Thu Jul 16 16:34:30 2015 UTC,"I see what you mean, and I do admit I don't play competitive INS much. However whilst I think CSGO COULD do 7v7, I think INS SHOULD be 8v8 at least. A 5v5 makes INS not much different to CS:GO at all except being easier since you don't need to aim for the head."
insurgency,3din5t,KCIV,3,Thu Jul 16 19:29:29 2015 UTC,"Why does it have to be different?  Are League and Dota the Same game becuase they both have 3 lanes?  Uniqueness at the expense of quality is not a good result :/ ""we have to be different and not like X game"" is not good design as you are literally designing something that ISN""T X. Rather than designing something that is good with differing qualities.  5v5 ins plays NOTHING not even close to anything like csgo 5v5 to claim they are equal simply because they both use 5v5 is to say FPS 5v5 is the same as mobo 5v5 it just doesn't work like that."
insurgency,3din5t,KCIV,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:26:10 2015 UTC,"You know what, League and Dota are pretty much the same game - there's so many similarities amongst the heroes that a Dota player going to League would not find it difficult at all. The only difference is that Dota has a higher skill cap due to being able to do more tricky stuff. Even though I am a die hard Dota fan I can't help but feel that the only reason Dota still stays relevant is because of the amount of support Valve gives to the game. That, and the completely outrageous prize pools. If Dota was given the same treatment Blizzard gave to SC2, I feel that Dota would nowhere near have as strong a following as it has today, and even then it's still about 1/2 or 1/3 of League's.  The point is that I 'hate' League - it is essentially an easier, more casual version of Dota. Additionally, has there ever been an 8v8 tournament in INS? If not, how can you say that it is an ""expense of quality""?"
insurgency,3din5t,MAD_JIHAD,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:13:40 2015 UTC,"firstly. By those claims, then all FPS's are basically the same, I disagree. Genre qualities does not mean ""same game"". In general terms, yes they are the same, but in all the ways that count they are not the same game.  secondly. before comp was even starting like PRE TWL days, there were 8v8 tests 7v7 and 6v6 tests, some of those done more recently than others (post TWL days). In fact VIP was the premier COMP mode untill devs made a ton of changes to it/maps and subsequently killed it.  The people avidly playing, spending time and money in competitive, and growing the scene successfully,  are enjoying 5v5 and nobody is signing up or petitioning a 8v8 league (quiet the opposite actually).  People like 5v5 firefight, That is where the growth is, and is where success is being shown, If someone wants to also spend time and money growing a 8v8 scene then why not do that? its easy to sit here and say ""oh well I think X mode"" but its another thing to get 16 people (min for 1 match) to agree with that enough to grow a scene from it.  comp exists today because of like 2 people specifically working to continue it. So far, people who play comp agree 5v5 is better. If you want a 8v8 tournament to be set up then why not talk to anyone in the DGL and see if they would host one?"

Every FPS has different gun play - CoD has alot of twitch shooting and alot of running, BF is a mix between twitch shooting and long range tactical play, TF is literally about the team and CS:GO is a positioning game and about movement and zones of control as much as about headshotting. I find it hard to place INS anywhere besides the same category as CS:GO but without the headshot requirement."

Also 8v8 lans were a PITA and splitting winnings between 8 people sucks. I also played some cod 5v5 and the map size seemed to suit it well along with search and destroy having no respawns mid round.  5v5 seems like a good fit for the maps and game modes in insurgency, also if you want to you can always make your own 8v8 league...  Ive only played one insurgency scrim with some friends of mine and from what I gathered it seems like there needs to be one or two more players to fill out the larger maps in game modes where you respawn.

Is already hard to form teams of 5 that stick together and organize tournaments, matches, etc when 10 people need to agree day and time.  CSGO is 5vs5 because the maps are designed and balanced for 5vs5. If you add a 6th or 7th you could have some chokepoints smoked 100% of the round time for example. The entire game is balanced around 5vs5, that is why casual mode sucks that much."

Why do you think casual 12v12 servers of CSGO have MASSIVELY different bias balance compared to 5v5.  Adding more people directly impact 100% the balance of a map.  and I agree it would be interesting. I also know it was already tested, and those playing competitive the most have no real interest in testing it over and over.   If the people playing the most, spending the most time in competitive, and spending real money supporting competitive don't see its value than I tend to trust those people. Not out of elitism but rather because if you have 200 members in a small community saying no, then to make unwanted changes hurt and diminish that community. EVEN IF 8v8 is better (hypothetically) its better not to kill what exists simply for the sake of being ""right"".  If you want 8v8 to be tested then get into contact with DGL admins or ESL and try to get a tournament put together. Prove its worthiness :) I will also point out that were talking about FF, Competitive push (lol) could be 8v8 and should be tested (as push is semi untested). but firefight should not."

Imagine your favorite game in real life for example soccer where professional teams play 5vs5 instead of 11vs11 and some dribbling and feints with a ball are restricted.

NWI competitive? or DGL competitive? they each restrict in different ways. NWI more so than DGL. I mean technically CSGO restrict more in its comp mode compared to Gun game or TDM. Those topics are not objective like you seem to think. they are very much subjective.   I guarantee that there were people who thought that soccer was better off 9v9 or 10v10 the same as you post about INS being 8v8 or 12v12. Compare indoor to outdoor soccer. Compare basketball vs soccer What if you wanted basketball to be 11v11 instead of 5v5? Should we apply your logic equally? Well cuz football is 11v11 then basketball should also be 11v11? and not 5v5? Its not strong or sound logic.  its all about perspective and critical analysis of each ""design""."

Why competitive e-sport teams are so small? Because cyber sport is very young, less profitable and less popular than other sport games in real life. That's why it is hard to build and manage big teams. I'm sure that in ten years when e-sport become much more profitable and popular it will be common to see competitive teams with 10-20-30 players. And all other reasons about game design is bullshit. Right now game developers could bring us any game design you need. But today there is no need for large scale combats in e-sport.  Large scale combats are very interesting to observe and participate, they require much more skill and coordination to be successful. So it is just matter of time when we will see big teams in competitive scene."
insurgency,3din5t,vorgain,2,Fri Jul 17 17:47:22 2015 UTC,"Esports is young because computers are young. And history of esports is typically Sc, and CSGO (with other bigger and newer kids on the block). 5v5 and 1v1 formats. 2v2 starcraft is not a thing it was tried many times but never grew in popularity, The games don't often scale simply because of growth and popularity.   also you claim larger scale combats are interesting. (again subjective) and require more skill (not the same skills as 5v5) and coordination (also semi true as there is less importance on micro and more focus on the macro so both increasing and decreases coordination) But on looking at any recent BFX event ""coordination"" is more or less controlled Chaos Theory which has less and less importance in over tactics and more and more on ""what in the next 5 seconds should I be doing"" so its this weird combination of less micro but more intense micro.  But to claim we just will see teams get bigger that isn't true at all. That is a subjective theory that hasn't been proven in any game. Look at WOT they DECREASED there games size dramatically for competitive with extremely positive results in the community! (WOT) being the only primary ""esport"" with large team formats. even BF4 has died down into smaller formats. Even in real sports the players on the court are rarely increased. (were not talking rosters because rosters are really not even relevant to this conversation)  Even look at smaller games like Mechwarrior online, They INCREASED casual game size and made there ""competitive mode"" large format and the BIGGEST thing veterans have been asking for is smaller format, going back to the 8v8+- format of old.   Look at basketball. How long has that game been played 250 some odd years and NBA being almost sub 100?? I can't think of any sport in recently history that has grown in size and thus increased its players on the field.   I mean sure your theory could be true, but there is no history to reflect that trend at all. and its all subjective opinion which is open to peer review and criticism. you say 5v5 isn't good, well then prove it ;) so far 5v5 has proven its viability in firefight, I don't see anyone else spending time to make a 8v8 league? I don't see any teams forming and trying to start a tournament? I don't even see people going to existing leagues and asking for a tournament to be hosted or set up :/ I mean. If your claims are true then why is non of those things happening? Are you claiming that such an obviously mistake is perpetually being made? So blatantly obviousness that nobody cares about correcting it? I can't see that as rational thinking.   I don't disagree with what you like, or what you see as good or valid those are relative, but when it comes to design what is ""correct"" is often so relative that its more about popularity and success than it is ""2+2=4"". And so far entire history of Esports and sports showing contrary to the proposed theory. :/ I would love to discuss it further about design and competitive."

Support gunner would be slightly more useful, but their main use is to keep people suppressed.  Competitive maps are almost all CQB with no real long lines of sight that you could keep people pinned down in."
insurgency,3din5t,KCIV,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:51:55 2015 UTC,"A marksman, as opposed to a sniper, should be advancing with his squad (slightly behind) and covering them from enemy snipers.  Most INS players don't do this, rendering the marksman class woefully under utilized."

Controllers work better than m+k for a lot of things, but FPS games is not one of them. And controller users always go on the defensive when someone states this but its just true.

Aim at one, another guy crosses your path, and then your aim immediately switches targets. This equals shot missed. Everyone who plays competitively keeps this off for reasons like this as well as it delaying your swing when needing to switch targets rapidly and not allowing for style points when quickscoping (yea man, I'm a CoD/console player)."

However if there was, Team Deathmatch wouldn't really help anyway as there is no objective other than to kill the other team.  If anything, I'd recommend playing on Co-Op servers. It can give you a basic rundown on how to capture/destroy objectives and at the same time you can learn how to handle weapons. You'll also be put against AI enemies, so you don't feel as stressed as you would against real players. Players are more forgiving on Co-Op. Your team has 5 attempts to clear the map, so it's okay to make some mistakes. Some servers will also have adjustable AI difficulty through voting if it gets to difficult.   The Co-Op modes also play on the same maps as PVP with slight alterations, so you can also learn the basic map layouts with it.  Hopefully this helps in any way, and welcome to Insurgency!"

Audio goes into stereo headphones (stereo works fine, AKG K7XX has great detail but is a little harsh for music, I did the burn-in stuff some audiophiles swear by and others say is bogus, maybe it worked or not).  TS3 volume adjusted by keybind (so I can drop TS when I need to crank up ingame, or raise when comms matter more than the details of the shootouts).  In windows audio I have loudness equalization on the fastest mode (limits volume peaks and raises valleys, so you don't have to touch vol knob as much).  No EQ changes although I experimented with that in PS2 (this would involve tweaking frequency EQ so relevant sounds are louder, i.e. freqs walking is composed of get boosted).  I've got the snd_mixahead halved vs default IIRC in my autoexec (less latency?). Some other stuff in autoexec but I haven't tested effectiveness tons.  I only go super loud in matches to reduce hearing damage risk (don't waste your hearing).  Reducing sound qual in some games can make noises harsher and thus easier to hear (less blending of soundscape, more like points of noises), haven't messed with that though.

insurgency,3dashg,Justworkhere,20,Tue Jul 14 20:51:00 2015 UTC,"People never get how you are supposed to throw smoke to obscure the enemies sightlines, not yourself"
insurgency,3dashg,ridethespiral987,9,Tue Jul 14 23:15:18 2015 UTC,"Obscuring yourself is obscuring enemy sightlines. Let's take Sinjar A for example, as using such nebulous terms and phrases isn't so much my style. :)   Putting a wall of smoke on the enemy's side of A allows them to easily move up, as there are no points past the smoke where you can take cover and defend. You can defend directly on the barrier of the wall of smoke, but that's difficult and very dangerous.  Putting a wall of smoke in the middle of A provides cover for both sides to move up and makes it so combat is dangerous on all counts and CQB.  Putting a wall of smoke on your side of A provides cover for you to move into the compound and clear it. If you can clear it with explosives, numbers, teamwork, and a well-timed push, then you can take position and begin defending."
insurgency,3dashg,Diabeetush,4,Wed Jul 15 04:03:33 2015 UTC,"Maybe I'm a couch military tactician but I'm not sure if I agree for Sinjar A.  It is often heavily defended by: a) a ton of campers on the point and b) snipers.  By smoking on the enemy's side, you can isolate the focus to clearing the campers, while not having to worry about the snipers.  That's the major advantage I've seen.  What do you think?"
insurgency,3dashg,jevyjevjevs,1 point,Wed Jul 15 10:58:05 2015 UTC,"That does make sense, but the same goal is achieved by smoking on your side, close enough to the buildings that you can move into them and clear them out without dealing with the snipers. Your indoors most of the time while capping A, or at least behind cover, so I don't consider snipers a major issue once you're in the compound, left or right."
insurgency,3dashg,Diabeetush,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:17:07 2015 UTC,A great rebuttal. I'll try both!
insurgency,3dashg,jevyjevjevs,3,Sun Jul 19 01:19:57 2015 UTC,"Kind of makes sense, but I'd have to disagree. Smoking on your side of A results in this configuration:  Enemy->A->Smoke->You  This is bad because you can't see the objective or the enemy as you move up. When you're in the smoke you get disoriented and have to take a moment to scan your surroundings as you exit the smoke, whereas your enemies will have their sights trained on the smoke where you'll be exiting.   Smoking on the Enemy's side of A reverses this situation, allowing you to move up as the enemy has to push through the smoke to get a shot on you, meaning if you're lucky he's disoriented and out of position, and minimally it at least buys you time to move.   If you're already on A though, smoke on A may not be too bad an idea as it prevents the enemy from sniping you from a distance, although it may be a hindrance to clearing the point itself."
insurgency,3dashg,AbsurdGoat,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:14:30 2015 UTC,"The idea of smoking your side of A is that you get the smokes close enough to the compound that you can enter it straight from the smoke. So on left, you can move up the side and enter the building. On right, you can move right on the walkway, frag, and enter. When you get out of the smoke, you'll be in cover.   That's the idea, anyways. Requires some well placed smoke in all circumstances."
insurgency,3dashg,Diabeetush,0,Wed Jul 15 21:19:08 2015 UTC,I hate when I'm sniping and all of the sudden a smoke pops right in my line of sight and it was my teammate who threw it. My sniper cover is a little more effective then your smoke bud

I feel like blacklisting the entire server every time I see someone smoke an objective as the defenders.  2) Attackers should always use smoke. Always. When in doubt, load more smokes. Spam smokes and push.  3) Snipers are cancer. I try to always take the sniper or sharpshooter or marksman kit. Then I proceed to use one of the rifles, mount a regular scope or irons, use smokes and nades, etc. I figure if I take the sniper class and use it like a regular person, it means one less sniping turd on our team.  4) lasers and flashlights are crap. Spend those points on more explosives instead."
insurgency,3dashg,Harnisfechten,3,Thu Jul 16 14:04:24 2015 UTC,there is only one useful use for a defending enemy to use a smoke grenade and that is on an open terrain thrown towards them as far as possible will eliminate long range shooters and provide a clear and easy backdrop (one or two shades of grey behind the enemy verses thousands of objects/shapes/etc) their silhouettes will be easy targets.   even then you have to properly throw the smoke and have a relatively open terrain and if they just throw a smoke then it becomes positive for them . so just don't do it

In my experience, most people do indeed have speakers despite not having a mic. While playing squad leader, there's always the one guy on your squad to runs off. Maybe he does not speak your language, or is just uncooperative.   Of course, people who are unfamiliar with leadership in the combat roll will call you ""a bit of a dick"" most likely. You're not being a dick for giving your men orders and instructions that lead to them winning the game. Calling out mistakes, giving orders, and assigning people to roles is part of being an effective squad leader.   In the ""Soldier vs. Warrior"" debate, the soldier wins the fight more often than not against a team of the same skill level as him and his brothers, especially in Insurgency. A good squad can be improved by a competent squad leader to direct their skills to good use."

Here's how:  tl;dr available if you know what you're doing with all of these programs!   Install VAC (Virtual Audio Cable). VAC's name describes what it is: it's a virtual audio device found on the microphone screen. Install WinAMP. This is an MP3 player that allows you to change the device to which the audio is output from the program.  Download some nasheeds from YT using a YT to MP3 converter. Personal suggestions: Hebbit Kerrih, Anjoom Layat, Saraya Dawlati, Saleel al Sawarim, Lana Lmorhafato. Lana Lmorhafato is fucking great, especially if you get the version with the ISIS soldiers in the background firing and communicating.  In the ""Preferences"" tab of WinAMP, set the output to your VAC once it's all setup. There's probably a few ""Output"" options, so set both (or just 1 if you only see 1) to the Virtual Audio Device.  Set the VAC Virtual Audio Device (called Line 1 or something) to your default recording device. Turn your real mic off. Leave your default playback device alone. When in game, in the console, type ""voice_loopback 1"" so you can hear your own nasheeds when you are playing them. If you can't hear them then they're not playing. If they're too loud/too quiet, play with the audio. Quality will sound decent to you, but it's actually played as very high quality to the server.   tl;dr: Use VAC to provide a virtual audio device for an MP3 player such as WinAMP to play its music to rather than your default playback device. Nasheeds can be found on YT and converted to MP3 online for download. Set your ""Line 1"" to default recording device. Use ""voice_loopback 1"" to hear your glorious nasheeds."

A friend uses one of the mouse thumb buttons successfully, but that probably won't work for my way of holding the mouse while playing.  I just don't like having another button to worry about while playing. Since I use the comms wheel a lot to communicate with my team-mates, I can't imagine pushing yet another button at the same time to tell them ""BEHIND US!"" while turning around to mark the enemy and call for backup in a hectic situation.  When playing with friends during the day, I use a TS3 setup with fine-tuned voice activation.

insurgency,3d4jf5,Remigus,3,Mon Jul 13 13:43:23 2015 UTC,"Game is very stable unless you use poorly done mods.  It's getting more and more active as more people discover it.  Most popular mode is Push, probably followed by competivive 5v5 Firefight.  Might have trouble finding full servers in early morning, but during normal hours, you'll be fine.  1-2 shots is all you can expect to land before a kill.  There are no hit markers, and most servers don't let you know if you've killed.  Objectives are everything in this game, and if you're not playing towards them, expect experienced players to get frustrated.  The community is pretty decent for the most part, especially if you do competitive.  Push is where most of the casual players are, and there's more toxicity there but it's nothing compared to CSGO or COD.  If you're looking for small-scale tactical gameplay, this game is pretty good for that.  Teams that communicate usually roll ones that don't by a pretty wide margin.  There are some servers that take tactics to the next level, if you're into that.  All in all, it's definitely one of the top-tier FPS games I've played."

My recommendation once you get it for loadouts:   Always pick AP ammo. Don't even bother with anything else I use optics on security weapons, use open sights with insurgent weapons I usually go armorless to decrease weight.  Everyone runs AP rounds anyways, so you won't really die faster. Most of the time, just go with the weapon that costs the least supply points, at least until you get familiar with how the game works   There are some pretty useful threads on here with tips for newbies.  Above all, have fun.  It's a great game."

If the United States occupies that area, and the Insurgents are trying to kill them to remove them from an area, then they are acting as terrorists. Their ""political aim"" is to remove the ""invaders"" from their home, changing their own government's decisions. They are using violence to achieve their political goal, which is the definition of terrorism.   If we're speaking of the Iraqi Insurgency, then the United States acted as a government of sorts and controlled the civilians, exercising their power over them by arresting them.

While the ISIS, Taliban, and Mujahid are all terrorist groups, I completely agree with you that there is a major difference between all of them.

To argue otherwise would be ignoring a tremendous amount of circumstantial evidence.  Suicide vests are not strictly ""terrorism"" any more than kamikaze pilots in WWII, unless they are used against civilian targets.  Suicide vests and suicide VBIEDs were / are common tactics to be used against military targets in Iraq and Afghanistan.  Would they have a legitimate place in Insurgency based on theme? Absolutely.  Would they improve gameplay? In my opinion, absolutely not.  Start going down that route and sooner or later you end up with Call of Duty Modern Warfare 11."
insurgency,3cyh97,Ballsey,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:44:53 2015 UTC,"There are only three pieces of circumstantial evidence. One, both forces use real-life equipment. That doesn't really mean much, series like Ace Combat have used real-life equipment in entirely fictional settings for over a decade. Two, SEC appears to wear MARPAT and 6CD patterns. Again, doesn't really mean much for the same reason. The most damning evidence is the map names, which are locations in Iraq and Afghanistan (and one in Tajikistan if I remember right). Insurgents don't even speak a language other than English.  There is no evidence to suggest that the Insurgents are terrorists, however. The other reply to my comment gave me the literal definition of an insurgency and claimed it meant terrorism. The game is wonderfully morally ambiguous that way, there is a definite chance that, for any number of reasons, Security would be the ""bad guys"" but we're never told, so it doesn't matter.  Anyway, giving INS a suicide vest, ignoring the gameplay problems, would be like giving mustard gas to SEC. It immediately casts a negative light on them, and the game loses a lot of that wonderful ambiguity."
insurgency,3cyh97,smittywjmj,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:42:53 2015 UTC,"I think the most obvious context clues here are the fact that America just spent ten years in Iraq and Afghanistan fighting insurgents (occasionally with PMCs), and this is a game in which a seemingly American PMC fights Insurgents in Iraq and Afghanistan.  It seems pretty clear that the various ""Insurgents"" you play as are stand-ins for the forces we've been fighting for the last decade.  As to whether or not that inherently makes them TERRORISTS! is a matter only of perspective, given the fact that real life is every bit as morally ambiguous as reality.  Whether or not using a suicide vest casts a negative light on the insurgents is again a matter of perspective.  If an American soldier enters a room in Iraq, is mortally wounded and kills five insurgents in the process, he is a WAR HERO and an INFIDEL.  If an Insurgent uses a suicide vest in conjunction with a moped to make a small VBIED and destroys a HMMWV with five soldiers inside, he is a MARTYR and a TERRORIST.  Both die, both kill the enemy.  Who's a shitbag is a matter of perspective.  A suicide vest is a tool like any other.  If it is used against a military target, it is not terrorism.  Only if used against a civilian populace.  Just like any other weapon.  Real life is every bit as morally ambiguous."
insurgency,3cyh97,Ballsey,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:01:00 2015 UTC,"Yes, opposing sides will clearly have different opinions. However, real life also has third parties, represented in Insurgency by the player. SEC obviously has some kind of reason for fighting INS, and INS has theirs for fighting SEC. We, the third party, don't know what those reasons are, so both factions are essentially ""neutral"" to us, neither side has the moral high ground.  A suicide vest will skew that substantially, as would other, similarly ""inhumane"" weapons."

Run under the bridge toss C4 ontop of the barrier on top of the bridge nuke it. Toss grenade right into the bit it can't reach. Toss nade left (soft) to clear the other dead spot. Capped.  Or run right up to the base of A toss smokes over behind A the simply clear left to right.  Not got demo? Go left into the bush with a suppressor and block reinforcements. Or go right and you can almost get to B and shoot everybody in the back.  B is capped by blocking the road. Go left and get into the building at the corner of the road. Suppressor and you can take everybody out who crosses the road.   C is messy.  Cache you don't even need to get near it as it can be cheesed. AT4x2 on hill behind the building. Or 2 grenades. Or a C4 which doesn't even need to go round the corner.
insurgency,3cty4d,Leetenghui,2,Sat Jul 11 09:39:19 2015 UTC,"Problem with A for Sec is always the river. Insurgents will always reach the river first and as long as they do, they dictate what lives under the bridge. They have foliage and hard covers in the river approach itself which they can hide behind and secure the area under the bridge as well as anything that runs up the hill to A from middle. Almost any experienced Scout on Insurgent side will opt for silenced SKS to the river and will push up right to the Sec side of the bridge.   A pistol rush by Sec by a loner will not win against 2 -3 Insurgents who will run into the river under foliage. And the Sec is very obvious to them running down the hill. However a concentrated rush to the river by Sec will win this area easily as long as a Sniper is at the far back preventing further Insurgent reinforcement to the river.   This is when both teams have experienced players. Pistol rushes only work if the other team does not anticipate it and it hardly works if you are in the open and the enemy is in cover.   As long as Security can secure the river, they can take A more easily. Without the river secured, the middle and right flank approach is always cut off."

But seriously, it has saved my ass before on many occasions."
insurgency,3crxc0,Emperor-Commodus,6,Fri Jul 10 12:16:39 2015 UTC,"I disagree. For me, the only time you should use a pistol is if you're doing a lightweight pistol rush or your primary has a scope on it that gives you a disadvantage in CQB. If you're using a normal rifle with iron sights/RDS, a pistol isn't just unnecessary, it's harmful because it takes up a supply point and slows you down.  Here's why; you will never get into a situation where you don't have enough time to reload, but do have enough time to pull out a pistol.   Think about it. How many times have you been killed in Insurgency because you ran out of ammo, where you would have been able to survive if you had a pistol? For me, with >300hrs of gameplay, that number is zero. An M16 holds enough bullets to easily kill ten people without reloading, I almost never run out to begin with.  Additionally, reloading only takes marginally more time than switching to a pistol. Even more, the armor mechanic in Insurgency makes pistols so unreliable that I would rather take the extra time to reload my M16 than switch to a gimped, unreliable weapon."
insurgency,3crxc0,Streloks,4,Fri Jul 10 15:28:34 2015 UTC,"How many times have you been killed in Insurgency because you ran out of ammo, where you would have been able to survive if you had a pistol? For me, with >300hrs of gameplay, that number is zero.    I find that ridiculous. I think if you gave pistols more of a chance, you'd find that it saves you more often than you think."
insurgency,3crxc0,Emperor-Commodus,0,Sat Jul 11 00:10:25 2015 UTC,"I do give them a chance, I use them all the time when I'm sniping or get bored with primaries. There has been many a time where I've been forced to put away my sniper rifle and charge a point with my trusty M1911+AP because the rest of my team won't get off their ass.  And as someone who uses pistols a good amount, it's my opinion that they are not worth the weight or the points as long as your primary doesn't disadvantage you in CQB.   I almost never run out of ammo during an engagement, and when I do, I die almost instantly, long before I would have been able to switch and shoot my pistol. If I don't die instantly, I have enough time to reload and return fire with my full power primary.  If you're constantly getting killed when your mag runs dry, maybe you should try planning out your engagements better, instead of charging into battle with a half-empty mag.  Additionally, unless you're willing to use 2-3 points on AP, pistols are dreadfully inconsistent, being almost useless against heavy armor. Even if you somehow manage to get yourself into a situation where you are able to use that backup pistol, you're still using a super underpowered weapon and will lose the engagement most of the time."
insurgency,3crxc0,PubertyOverdose,2,Sat Jul 11 03:50:19 2015 UTC,"Depends on the weapon on how long the reload speed is. I strictly play push and there has been plenty of times, as an offensive player, that im at the capture point and its common for a wave of guys to trickle in and depending on the size of the mag, it can run dry. Switching to pistol takes about a half a second but most weapons take 1-1.5 seconds to reload. It doesnt seem like a lot but it has made the difference for me at least.  I also never roll without a 1X scope or Kobra scope on my primary. I feel like having the mixture of the scope and a pistol allows me to be the most versatile in most situations...but thats just what works for me."
insurgency,3crxc0,misterX-,3,Fri Jul 10 15:38:36 2015 UTC,"Depends on the weapon on how long the reload speed is.   Very much this. Coop/Support player here. If you run dry on the M249 while holding off a counter-attack, having a pistol can be the fine line between making that LMS clutch and sending your whole team back to the start.  I never leave home spawn without one.  Except for Siege Checkpoint. I'll go for nades instead and resupply to my usual M249/pistol loadout once we cap Alpha."

To me, with ~80 hrs that number would be like 20, and also a lot higher if I didn't carry my pistol with me. It's not always possible to spend exactly one-two bullets on one enemy, seriously."
insurgency,3crxc0,Emperor-Commodus,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:33:48 2015 UTC,"It's not always possible to spend exactly one-two bullets on one enemy, seriously.   So you regularly kill ten or more people in a row without reloading?  My rule of thumb is if you feel like you should reload, do it. There's no mag dropping in this game, partially full magazines just get added to the back of the line, so worst case scenario is that by the end of your game all your mags have 20-30 rounds left. If you survive that long.  The last part is important, because the fact is that combat in Ins is quick enough that the vast majority of players die before they empty half a mag, if they even fire any shots at all. Even if you obsessively reload after every burst like I do, the average player will die before they've cycled all their mags through their gun, let alone come close to emptying any of them."

This is especially useful as sprinting resets your hip-fire crosshair to the very center of your screen.  You can also sprint/jump during the pin pull and throw animations of your grenades, allowing you to get extra distance.

It's easier to slide while sprinting when you only have to press CTRL instead of holding SHIFT and then pressing CRTL. Your little finger will be greatfull.

I either suggest making a shorter clip of ONLY the impressive kills, or reduce the video to 1 minute of only the most interesting kills series. Also put your best crazy kills first. Don't leave it to be found only if you watch the full video. (unless you have equally crazy kills before it)  Getting kill streaks on targets from behind or just running around a doorway getting kills on confused players isn't all that impressive by itself. It shows you are better than the average player for sure! but most of the time a good Compilation is showing the top 1% of crazy or weird kills or flick shots. Video right now is like the top 10%.  Good video though, keep it up! I have no doubt you can make a even sicker compilation! :)"

I had a talk with a friend of mine about how to do the videos, and he basically said I needed to make it interesting for anyone who plays video games, not just insurgency players. That's why I added the kill streaks instead of slow/impressive objective play. That's the hardest thing I think.. making it fun to watch without overdoing the 420 noscope yolo swag mlg bullshit. I really appreciate the feedback though. I'm still trying to decide what type of videos I would like to put out. That's why I just figured a compilation of stuff would be a good first go.

Where in other Source games like Counter Strike and DOTA2 you can get easily above 250+ fps with a 970, in Insurgency you will be struggling to maintain around 100fps..."
insurgency,3codro,karmasmarma,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:11:24 2015 UTC,"Maybe so, but I can still notice a big difference.  I'd had my 144hz monitor for about a month or so when I went to a LAN party. I started playing Insurgency and it just felt ""weird"". It's hard to explain but I felt sluggish. I went into my display settings and it had defaulted back to 60hz, maybe I plugged it into a different display port or something.  Anyway, I'm not saying a 144hz monitor will make you a gaming god or anything, but Insurgency is definitely better on it and I noticed as soon as I didn't have it, so it is real."

It's great in general, but if you specifically buy it for Insurgency I wouldn't recommend it."

With the M9 I can be sure I can get at least one person down with scramble shots and at least 2 people with controlled fire. The others really don't have the mags to do that.

Only viable time to use one is in conjunction with a bolt action, which I never use anyway so that doesn't apply to me.  How ever in competitive we play pistol rounds to determine who plays which side first, and in that case I always use an M9, AP ammo and some type of chest rig for the extra mag. Armor is useless as everyone has the supply points to use AP, I typically like suppressors but I've noticed lately that during rapid fire the suppressor obstructs your view slightly, and I like the chest carrier because I typically mag dump cause pistols are kind of shitty and I'm bad with them. The .45 just kicks way too much and is only one shot kill close up, its just too impractical to make longer range shots with especially with the 7 round mags.

insurgency,3ckcvs,Lobinius,1 point,Thu Jul 9 06:18:20 2015 UTC,Have to say the M9 with AP.   Use it mainly for pistol rushes in PUSH. Using certain classes can equip a suppressor and that thing is damn near inaudible to enemies.   Tried Makarov/1911 but the little ammo that comes with it just means more downtime.

insurgency,3ch9jn,preventDefault,29,Tue Jul 7 22:10:12 2015 UTC,"Looks like we'll be seeing some polish to things we never thought about in upcoming patches.  Look at this shit... the charging handle moves back, the dust cover opens (with a slight bounce), the bolt moves forward and pushes a fresh round into the chamber.    It's a change nobody asked for but for me it means that they are going to be adding more polish to the game in upcoming patches.  I slowed this down to 30% and uploaded the gfy @ 60fps for maximum weapon enjoyment.    Maybe I'm too excited about this type of stuff.  Here's a YouTube version if you're also sick in the head like me.  As always, join the Beta Branch Brunch so you can be included in these tests!  I recommend following Arc's Guide on how to keep your regular & beta installs of Insurgency separate because sometimes opting out of the beta can be troublesome."
insurgency,3ch9jn,KCIV,5,Tue Jul 7 22:13:50 2015 UTC,"I agree the animations are amazing. Polish is great! But polish wears off very quickly. The new reload is amazing. Top notch quality! No doubt there. but.  As you say ""Looks like we'll be seeing some polish to things we never thought about in upcoming patches.""  That was my initial reaction to these changes as well. They are great, They are awesome, They are good for the game, I just hope there is some meat along with it.   like Audio Occlusion, That has much more potential to be exciting with long term effects and game play implications than an animation we will soon forget about as high quality ""norm""."
insurgency,3ch9jn,KCIV,9,Tue Jul 7 22:35:01 2015 UTC,"I do wish that there were other improvements being made, but an animator can only do one thing... animate.  Their animator improving in-game animations for us doesn't take away from any of the manhours being spent on fixing bugs, adding features, making maps, etc.  He's punching the timecard, doing his thing, and this is one of the thigns we see as a result.  I hope to see the full empty animation include tilting the rifle to the left to inspect the bolt's position.  As far as I know, this is standard in police/military training to ensure that *click* you heard wasn't from a weapon jam.  You check to see if the bolt is locked back, then insert the mag.  If the bolt isn't locked back, and is instead forward or somewhere between the two... then you have another problem on your hands and a fresh mag ain't gonna fix it.  This game is never going to include jams but that doesn't mean the animations can't follow correct training protocols for checking for them anyways.  Just another layer of polish on an already awesome game.  MrBrightSide's ACR mod had this animation, and he's now working for NWI.  So I might get my wish afterall."

Yes I understand how development works, I understand that it potentially doesn't take away.  that doesn't change my point, which is HOW quickly did we stop raving over rag dolls? How quickly did superficial animations get washed into ""normal"" game play we don't think about any more. Very quickly is the answer. They are fun, they are great, I fucking love them, But that doesn't make me blind or ignorant to the long term impact. I am more excited about Long term quality impact changes than I am a new ""shiny"".   Don't confuse what I am saying. I am VERY excited to see new animations How many time did I rave about the new rag dolls?! However I'm not dumb enough to think i'm going to still be this excited about it 2 months from now. However I WILL be excited 2 months from now if Audio Occlusion works. Because of the quality game play derived from that change."
insurgency,3ch9jn,Tubur,3,Wed Jul 8 14:56:18 2015 UTC,You're right. We quickly got used to the awesome (and sometimes hilarious) ragdolls so a new weapon animation would probably follow suit. Nice to have but not exactly a long term game changer.

Edit:  I'm sure there are many people who don't tap it. It could go either way. Army taught tapping.  In insurgency we can assume that everyone has clean rifles that aren't caked with shit so it's not too odd that they wouldn't punch the assist unless it was some salty dude is doing it out of habit.

Maybe some destructible walls here and there with forethought given to layout and performance impact. Even that little bit could prove to be a pain in the ass though, and take up quite a bit of time with little payoff.     The type of destruction you see in something like BFBC2 is pretty damn complex. IIRC the destructible building were made up of 30+ entities. That alone would be a big hit to Source. It's the same deal with destructible lights. The way the engine handles lighting makes it very difficult to pull off. Hopefully the next Insurgency is on a newer engine that supports destruction."

I mean, the rifle is not massless, and holding the rifle that way is actually quite hard on the wrist.  Yes, yes, I get it. The tacti-cool factor and all that. But personally, I would like the game to be a bit more grounded on reality or something.  Yes you can still show off dat dust cover and ejection port. Use right hand to pull (slingshot) the charging handle (and tap the forward assist for dat cool factor)."
insurgency,3ch9jn,Zkv,8,Tue Jul 7 23:47:32 2015 UTC,"Doesn't seem too weird to me..  To be honest, that comes pretty close to how I instinctively did it when I got my hands on an AR-based rifle for the first time, including the tilt (to check that everything was working as intended).  Don't forget that you basically have to hold it that way (with your right hand only) while reloading as well..  When you're holding the rifle by its grip and using your left hand to pull the charging handle/change magazines, you can either ""tuck it"" under your armpit a bit or simply lock it against your upper arm to reduce the leverage of the rifle. I'm a really skinny guy with arms like pipe cleaners, but even I have no problems holding the rifle with only my right hand like that.  How would you go about your suggested method (using your right hand to slingshot)? I imagine that to feel rather awkward. How would you hold it while doing that? How would you transition into that from your default stance?  [edit] this clip I found seems pretty close to the new charging animation in the game.   Cheers"
insurgency,3ch9jn,Jeearr,3,Wed Jul 8 01:11:27 2015 UTC,With my noodle arms I used to put the stock above my knee and yank down on the charging handle for extra leverage.  Maybe Colt 6940's just have stiff springs though.  But I've seen plenty of soldiers perform the action the way we see it in the game.  They are in better shape than me.
insurgency,3ch9jn,Zkv,2,Wed Jul 8 02:57:39 2015 UTC,"Let me clarify by saying 'that way' meant holding the rifle one-handed, 'gangsta' style.  As for the 'slingshot' part, it's basically 'SPORTS' without the 'slap' part."

Even though I'm sure you'd notice if something went wrong anyways via your other senses (feel, sound, etc.). Although sound can be tricky if there's gunfire all around you.

insurgency,3ch9jn,Ballsey,2,Wed Jul 8 15:55:08 2015 UTC,"You're totally right. You would need insane grip and arm strength to pull back the charging handle while supporting the rifle with one hand on the pistol grip. All while the rifle staying completely still.   If I were going condition 1 like that, I'd have to sort-of push the rifle forward with my right arm and simultaneously wrench back the charging handle with my left. That way you'd have two opposing forces helping you pull back that charging handle. The rifle would move around a lot while doing so, conveying that it takes some force to do it."

Sure, different people like different playstyles (think rushing versus taking it slow, for example) - however some people seem to forget about ""cooperative"" nature completely.  When I'm visibly holding a corner from a bunch of advancing bots, jumping in front of me to try and ""get some of those sweet kills"" isn't only stupid and dangerous (and REALLY aggravating, especially when you get kicked for team-killing someone like this) but also not helping the team at all. Covering somebody's back while he's engaging a group of enemies may not yield as many kills, but if just a single bot flanks your position, you may just save the team from a wipe.  Similarly, some people tend to think they're extra clever by rushing to the objectives (capturing is ""worth"" 10 kills, after all! MLG PRO YOLO etc.) while the rest of the team is still busy clearing the area. Great work, you egoistically put your whole team in danger because now there's a counter-attack, and you die within 5 seconds, leaving the objective unprotected and forcing your teammates to rush into an enemy-infested area.   I really like that the devs removed K:D display from the scoreboard during regular gameplay, but I'd like seeing it taken a step further.  Some Killing Floor servers had a great mod which removed Kills/Deaths from the scoreboard altogether, simply replacing it by ""time played"" for each player.

Every time I play co-op somebody is the last man standing or whatever and is spraying mag after mag into the cache or typing ""how do I destroy cache"" into chat in a server without alltalk instead of going to look for explosives or resupplying.

insurgency,3chlcl,Gothic_Banana,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:43:32 2015 UTC,Usually my biggest gripe with it is when people KNOW that they need explosives on various game modes and just don't bring them.  How many game's i've won because the enemy team got to the weapons cache and just didn't have the explosives to blow it up so they were forced to wander around until they got shot.
insurgency,3chlcl,myhandleonreddit,4,Wed Jul 8 18:08:53 2015 UTC,Slight error:    Often times I find myself wishing that my teammates would literally not even shoot anything or do anything other than sit on objectives.

If you're sitting on an objective that's being contested or about to be contested, then that's great.  I know the situation's you're talking about though.  There's like a few guys on the enemy team and they have everything captured except the one objective that you're on, then yeah, thats better to defend.  However, if you see that they started taking a different objective than what you're trying to stop them from taking, you need to either clear that guy or take another one to force a spawn reset on both sides."

Seriously, it pisses me off to see people carefully pace over to objectives, trying to preserve every last bit of gameplay they have, but before they saunter on in, the objective's been taken, and they have to deal with a whole wave from the other team while attempting to take it back. I mean, for a tactical shooter, it's pretty fast-paced. You can twitch pretty easily and still do good. And it's not like letting the other team win is going to get you more lives. /rant"
insurgency,3chlcl,edonran,2,Wed Jul 8 03:04:26 2015 UTC,"Skirmish has a special place in my heart.  I think they need to do a better job explaining the importance of objective A and E on skirmish.  For those that don't know, the capture objectives B, C, and D give your team a respawn if captured, BUT if you still hold your own weapons cache (A/E) it adds an extra respawn wave to your teams wave counter.  Without the weapons cache, your waves will not be able to go up no matter what.  Its super important to protect your own (using a Larry as is written in the guide) and take out the enemies cache in Skirmish."

Playing comp playlist is fun and all but the lack of ranking means it is a toss up if you get decent players or just flat out idiots on your team. I don't know how much you can take from it but from my group of friends about 15 people have the game, like it and haven't played it in months due to lack of some kind of ranking based matchmaking. Even letting you pick skilllevel as a serverfilter would be better. At least then you could get some challenging opponents. Downside would be good players trolling the lower levels. :/"
insurgency,3cdfzk,edyisready,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:28:31 2015 UTC,"I don't know, I feel like this game just isn't popular enough to have ranked matchmaking. You get like 2 maybe 3 servers you can play on between 9-12est for 5v5 competitive, do you really think adding ranks so even less people can play with each other is a good idea? Don't get me wrong, I don't want to make you feel like I'm just disregarding your reasoning here, but this game just isn't dota or csgo with how huge the player bases are where having ranks to differentiate the good players from the bad ones can actually be a thing. I just feel like if you want to play with more competitive players you'll try to find a team or play pugs or something right? With your suggestion you might only be hindering new players that want to tryout 5v5.     I've been getting more and more into playing public 5v5, and I notice that you sometimes get brand new players playing the game mode which isn't how it should be, since this game is pretty damn hard. I only started playing 5v5 after maybe 15-20 hours into the game (enough to at least work out gun mechanics and get a feel for some of the maps that get played in 5v5) but some people are playing 5v5 with like 3-5 hours into the game. So maybe have the devs add a thing where you need at least 10-15 hours into the game to play 5v5? I feel like that'd be the best approach to what you want added. Like in dota 2 you need to be level 13 I believe to start playing ranked, otherwise you need to play unranked to get those levels up before you can ruin ranked games with your limited knowledge of the game. A similar system can work for this game."

As any MM it would choose the best fit available. It would take a while but if it couldn't match you with equal rank it would eventually match you with anything.    PUG's and teams doesn't work since the competitors offer up such convenient systems. There are a lot of small groups of players that want to play with each other against people of equal skill. What they will not do is play PUG's with people they don't know or create a team an plan things a week in advance. They want to be able to queue up as a group and get appropriate opponents when they can play. It isn't like the average player is still in school. They have a lot of other things they have to do so when the opportunity to play a game or two presents itself they want it to be good quality.    I represent a kind of player that has no interest in public play. I haven't had in about 15 years. Once the fascination of a new game settled there is no alternative in Insurgency. Not even an option for serverfilter to choose low/mid/high skill level. People like me tend to be stuck with the same people playing the same game because there aren't an alternative really.    Gatekeeping it like you suggests does nothing to relieve that problem. It only makes it harder for those people to switch over to Insurgency. Forcing someone to play pub for 10h to be able to play with their friends is just setting up for it to have his friends play the game they are already settled in. At the extreme and fringe cases you would have things like me and CSGO. Since they implemented the new rank system I can't play MM without grinding up my rank on pub play. The result is I will never play CSGO again. I didn't play it a lot before but now the only option left is third party laddersystems like FaceIt. Which wouldn't give me any xp so even playing there would not help me getting into the standard MM. Don't get me wrong I understand completely why they did it. I just happen to be a fringe case that gets caught in the crossfire. The point is that Insurgency can't gatekeep players from a decent matchmaking because it has to few players.    It isn't comparable to games like Dota where you have over a hundred heroes to learn about. Not to mention the items. Instead it is very much a game that caters more to people that are already comfortable with FPS games in competitive framing. The kind of people that started playing such things with BF or CS-beta. People that will, after they learned the maps, easily outaim and outthink players that don't have thousand of hours played in similar games. Forcing those to jump through hoops is a sure way to make any ranked MM fail. Those are the ones you need to attract. Those are a fair amount of the people that make up the playerbase in CSGO. The problem is that those players aren't catered to at all now.    Just such a simple thing as to be able to select a skill level in the filter list, of say 5 levels, before you let the game find you a server in comp would make a big difference I think. It wouldn't really need additional infrastructure either. All it would need is an info space in serverinfo that tells the client server browser what the average skill level is on the server. Then just change and incorporate that into the method of how the game picks what server to connect to. As it is now the comp mode can't deliver good game experience to people. Say you group up with three friends. Then you group connect to comp. (ignoring the problem of getting into a game in progress and/or ending up on different teams) Then you still have the luck of the draw if you can get decent opponents. Usually it ends up with the other side getting stomped and ragequitting. Ruining the experience for your whole group. Why would you play such a game when other games deliver much better experience when playing as a group?"

It would take a while but if it couldn't match you with equal rank it would eventually match you with anything.      Aren't you contradicting yourself with saying the ranking system will just match a rank 1 player with a rank 5 player anyway if there aren't any other players? Plus you're raising the argument of partying up with your friends where you might be rank 5, but one friend might be rank 3, then the other might be rank 1, and there might be another group of people or some individual people with different ranks all trying to queue up to play video games, so how do you expect this game to have a big enough competitive player base to support that? Like alright having a low/mid/high skill filter is a decent idea but even with only 3 skill filters the same problem can come up. Like I just honestly don't see this game having enough people to justify matchmaking ranks, I don't know, maybe I'm wrong. I'm basing my opinion off of the fact that I can only get onto really 2 servers after 9est (when I'm usually finished working or doing whatever else in my life to play games) that are full enough to play 5v5 competitive. Sure like you said, someone like you or some other dude with friends can invite his friends to play some 5v5 insurgency, so maybe the game at that point will have enough players to justify some kind of ranking/skill filter system or at least a system but right now I just don't see it working, unless yes a low player can still queue with a high player if the matchmaking system doesn't find enough med/high players to play with each other on the same server, but then you're not getting what you're asking for by asking for a ranking system right?       PUG's and teams doesn't work since the competitors offer up such convenient systems.

They have a lot of other things they have to do so when the opportunity to play a game or two presents itself they want it to be good quality.      I completely understand because I am also in a place in my life where I can't play video games literally whenever it's convenient for me. I agree that having some kind of filter system would be a good idea because like I said in my previous post, I don't want to get stuck playing with those brand new players that tryout 5v5 after 5 hours and they have no idea what's going on. Playing 5v5 pubs is fine for me at this point because I'm not looking to join a team or anything like that in the near future, so yes having a filter where I get to constantly play with people of my skill or with players a bit better than me would be nice to have.       Gatekeeping it like you suggests does nothing to relieve that problem. It only makes it harder for those people to switch over to Insurgency. Forcing someone to play pub for 10h to be able to play with their friends is just setting up for it to have his friends play the game they are already settled in. At the extreme and fringe cases you would have things like me and CSGO.      But that's not my point. The point I was trying to make was that by having that gatekeep, you'll have better players playing 5v5 comp because they would have experienced the game a little bit more via playing sustained combat or tactical operations.      Let's say the devs add that restriction to playing 5v5 like I suggested. Instead of not letting your friends who have 1 hour of the game play 5v5 with you, the devs can make a system where if anyone else on the party has over 10-15 hours in the game (like yourself), it will override the restriction for your friends and you can play some 5v5 with those friends you're talking about. It would be a very simple way to keep the gatekeeping, but not discourage you from playing with your friends who are brand new to the game hours wise.      Honestly it's either you have a system like the above or you have the low/med/high filter that might not work with this game.      It isn't comparable to games like Dota where you have over a hundred heroes to learn about. Not to mention the items. Instead it is very much a game that caters more to people that are already comfortable with FPS games in competitive framing.

The problem is that those players aren't catered to at all now.      Doesn't it make more sense those players would play regular pubs to see if they would actually enjoy playing the game in the first place? This game is very different from any other fps games I've played (you're talking about the popular games like cs,bf,cod, right? not just some game like arma 3?), it would make sense to have them just try the game out with the normal game modes first. You're just assuming they want to instantly play 5v5 because they're hardcore gamers that played cs or whatever for 10 years, but you're not raising the point that they just might not enjoy the game and playing sustained combat or tactical operations is the best way to find out if you'll enjoy the game. And if they play those modes for 10 hours which come on, isn't anything, and they still like the game, then bam they can tryout 5v5. If they're more interested in csgo in the first place, they won't spend an extra hour everyday playing insurgency 5v5 to get to 10 hours or let alone 50+ hours, that they would of used playing cs instead. But I get your point about how those players might just want to instantly hop on and play 5v5 because that's the thing they enjoy from their previous games and they heard insurgency has a 5v5 thing built right into the main menu. Also if there is a filter system of low/med/high, that experienced fps gamer dude that wants to hop onto 5v5 will still be low, and he'll have no idea how the guns work or what attachments to get, where to go on the maps, what the normal hiding spots are, the normal camping spots, how to use something as simple as smokes effectively, etc. It'll just be a mess even with an experienced fps player.       Say you group up with three friends. Then you group connect to comp. (ignoring the problem of getting into a game in progress and/or ending up on different teams) Then you still have the luck of the draw if you can get decent opponents. Usually it ends up with the other side getting stomped and ragequitting. Ruining the experience for your whole group.      That goes into this game not having enough people playing it lol. If there were enough (which would probably mean more servers being used with more players), I'm sure the game would find you and two other friends a server where all 3 of you can always play on the same team. I notice that the kind of situation you're raising all the time because lots of teams/clans/whatever play 5v5 comp when I guess they don't have any scrims/matches going on, and two of them get on one team while the 3rd gets on the other. It's really just a problem of not having enough players and servers being filled up, so that's how the game compensates.      I want to also mention that I agree that having some kind of filter would be a nice feature to have. There are lots of people I regularly see playing 5v5 where if there was a filter I'd always find a game with those same people or at least people of similar skill, while the new players can try to work up to med/high for example and get to play with those people. It's just with how either unpopular 5v5 is compared to sustained combat/tactical operations or just that there aren't that many people playing the game to let the 5v5 game mode thrive, that having a filter might not work. But I don't see this game suddently getting 50k players, so it's at least better for the devs to try and put something in rather than not try at all. If it doesn't work out, the same people that play 5v5 will still play 5v5 while the new players will just keep playing the other modes."
insurgency,3cdfzk,MuNgLo,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:20:58 2015 UTC,"First of matchmaking is the ""art"" of finding the best matching opponents. Good matchmaking does figure in all the things you talked about. The point I did make is that IF there is no other match THEN it will even take a mismatch in skill level. Yes it will take a bit of searchtime extra each time you queue up but it is worth it. All the things you bring up is really non issues. There are examples of current, working matchmaking that solves all those things. The downsides are a bit of search time and if there is few players that it will still match over big skill differences.     But that's not my point. The point I was trying to make was that by having that gatekeep, you'll have better players playing 5v5 comp because they would have experienced the game a little bit more via playing sustained combat or tactical operations.     I understood your point. I just don't agree. That kind of gatekeeping would not attract new players that are interested in good comp MM play. They will not spend the time having shitty experiences in public while they can spend that time in other games that will give them better competitive experience. Yes it would force players to play X amount of time before getting into comp. That is no guarantee they actually know how to play the game. The only thing that is effective to segregate them from those that want more serious skilled game time is a ranking system. There are people that have put hundreds of hours into games without getting good.     Doesn't it make more sense those players would play regular pubs to see if they would actually enjoy playing the game in the first place?     The people I am talking about have been playing competitive FPS games for years. They have burnt out on public game experience a loooong time ago. They know what they want and right now there is no way for Insurgency to deliver that experience. Well unless you organize and plan and network and so on. The kind of stuff you did over ten years ago to get good gaming experience in competitive games. Sadly that has almost died out completely today. The new breed rarely knows what IRC is. Not to mention that the games themselves have pushed out the community based alternatives with having ranked matchmaking in one way or another.     You're just assuming they want to instantly play 5v5 because they're hardcore gamers that played cs or whatever for 10 years, but you're not raising the point that they just might not enjoy the game and playing sustained combat or tactical operations is the best way to find out if you'll enjoy the game.     Lets take my steam friendlist as an example. On that I have 21 friends who own Insurgency. Out of those only one play it anymore. Reason being he is young and still have the energy to get involved in and do shit with community/team driven stuff. Of the other 20 I dare say at least 80% (16) would say they don't play anymore because public is boring and there is no good competitive option. About 18 of the 21 is playing competitive games. All from SC2, WL, CSGO and more. That is the experience they seek and I would guess about half of them would give Insurgency another go if it where to implement a ranked MM.    I said ""ignoring the problem of getting into a game in progress and/or ending up on different teams"" and yet you felt you had to elaborate on it. Again these are non issues because it is as you say a product of the situation. In a perfect situation you would have 5v5 comp where you all connects, gets ready and game starts. Expecting that from such a small userbase is expecting to much. Hence the ignore part.    I do think the most realistic solution is to allow players to choose their skill level as they queue up. It is far from perfect but it does give the comp MM scene a chance to grow. As it is now it will never grow. There are just to big differences in skill, to much ragequits and so on. The experience is just lousy. And of course if it cant find exact match of skill it will try to find the closest match.    I could go on arguing more positives but I got a friend waiting to play HotS so we finally can get him out of Quick Match and get some decent games :D"

However this is also simply due to our population as well, we have far fewer people than other nations and therefore games that arn't 'hot' right now simply lose a huge chunk of their playerbase and will rely on a handful of servers. That being said, I can commonly find about 2 or so full servers a night for INS. Sure its not great but since most Aussie/NZ servers offer rotation/voting it keeps the game fresh and no 24/7 map/gametype.   I'd love more people to play this game, but to be honest I dont see it happening, it goes on sale every couple of months and you never see a huge peak in players especially in our region.

You run slower, which really limits your ability to flank the enemy or storm rooms quicker than you normally could.   Because you run slower, you're an easier target and take much longer moving cover to cover. It may make the difference between a 1 hit kill to the stomach and a 2 hit kill to the stomach, but that's about it. Usually, upon being hit once, your character slows down anyways.  Try playing without it. I have 500 hours, and about 300 of those were spent with heavy armor. Took it off and did fine. Wore no armor for the past 200 hours and am still doing fine.

AP has no draw backs AND lets you pen through walls and objects with lethal damage as well."

insurgency,3cdf2i,misterX-,2,Tue Jul 7 01:46:22 2015 UTC,"Professional cook here;  Vitamins are destroyed, but not all of them. Other nutriets and vitamins become more potent when this happens as well. I'd say you're safe to simmer the grenade for about 3 seconds over high heat.  As for why you're doing this while walking on a staircase, I'd have no idea. I recommend you move your oven/burner plate."
insurgency,3cav97,D3USN3X,6,Mon Jul 6 13:50:29 2015 UTC,"Don't sprint into a place where the enemy could be. It's as simple as that. At the beginning of the game, there is no way that the enemy could be close, so you can sprint out to an objective. After a minute, do not assume that the enemy is still far away from where you spawn. Assume that they are everywhere, and you will be fine."
insurgency,3cav97,killing_buddhas,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:42:16 2015 UTC,"Assume they are everywhere so you can move nowhere? LOL or take 10 minutes clearing every corner with smoke.  that great to say as a ""hey its easy not to die"" but its not a true statement."
insurgency,3cav97,KCIV,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:51:44 2015 UTC,"The whole map is for combat, except for the tiny little slices that are marked as off-limits. Anywhere you are not excluded from by the rules is fair game. Personally I appreciate it when someone gets up between our spawn and the objective because it forces me to think a little more, and there is a greater enjoyment when you catch them trying to be super aggressive."
insurgency,3cav97,killing_buddhas,-1,Mon Jul 6 19:12:06 2015 UTC,"Assume that they are everywhere, and you will be fine.   Nah, check the map and see who gets wiped out and where. If an entire flank gets wiped out they will come from that direction.  Mostly... as some can be by passed."
insurgency,3cav97,Leetenghui,8,Mon Jul 6 15:20:18 2015 UTC,"In the context of Insurgency, 'spawn killing' frequently occurs when you can block the area right outside the no-trespass zone. On Market, for example, the Security forces know the Insurgents are going to spawn on the little strip of road leading up to the main market. Any combination of SAW, AT4, and frags can keep the team from really getting out of that street. When the Insurgents are pushing for C, you can easily easily put an AT4 into their spawn. So yes, spawn camping very much exists.  I play on Push servers almost exclusively, so spawn killing is really moreso meant to obstruct the enemy team from coming near the objective. If you can suppress the road, and take out a few of them by virtue of the fact, then you're spawn camping / spawn suppressing."
insurgency,3cav97,INGWR,5,Mon Jul 6 13:59:11 2015 UTC,"I agree with the OP though, that's not spawn camping; that's playing the game. You're supposed to stop the enemy from getting to the objective and taking it. You push up as far as the game lets you so you have space to be pushed back. In the example you cited, the insurgents spawn on that street and are bottlenecked at the end, but the security forces have only a few locations to even get LOS on that road and the end of that road is not the spawn itself.   Spawn camping is when you spawn and are immediately killed with no chance to do anything about it. If you are able to walk to the end of the street and then be killed you're not being spawncamped, you're being pushed back into your spawn. And that's you're own teams fault for not protecting or pushing the security forces back. People have this bullshit idea that they should get free passage to the main point, or at least some portion there, otherwise they're being ""spawncamped"" and it's utter nonsense. When you spawn you are responsible for not getting killed. If you choose to just run willy nilly out of your spawn without checking corners and camping points, well, that's your choice. But if the game lets an enemy push up far enough that you assumed you were safe that's your fault for walking into it."
insurgency,3cav97,BluesReds,3,Mon Jul 6 17:33:30 2015 UTC,The issue is more often bad map design than it is spawn camping.
insurgency,3cav97,KCIV,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:42:14 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong, spawncamping absolutely can happen in the game. That is, when you spawn and are basically instantly killed. But most of these exploits have been solved. Bad map design will always happen and will also always be continually fixed and tweaked for fairness. But crying about not getting a free run to an objective by calling getting killed close to the spawn ""spawncamping"" is absurd."
insurgency,3cav97,BluesReds,4,Mon Jul 6 17:47:30 2015 UTC,You make an assumption on what is defined as spawn camping.  when 1 player can prone in a corner and camp 90% of exits from spawn that IS a problem and SHOULD be fixed.  killing people leaving spawn isn't a problem. When 1 player can camp 90% exits from spawn that is a problem.
insurgency,3cav97,KCIV,2,Mon Jul 6 18:27:55 2015 UTC,"It might be a problem; but it's not a spawncamping one, it's a map design flaw. It also might not be, it may be intended that there is a choke point that must be pushed past."
insurgency,3cav97,BluesReds,4,Mon Jul 6 18:42:29 2015 UTC,"That is why I said ""its more an issue of map design"" LOL Choke points are fine, not Choke spawns. which you can spray down killing 15 people just because you have a gun and know where to prone.  for example  https://www.reddit.com/r/insurgency/comments/34z3fz/discussion_spawn_killing/cr0fy81  https://www.reddit.com/r/insurgency/comments/3cav97/spawn_killing/csu30zl  both good posts. which talk about the importance of good design  I am also not saying that you should whine about it. Complaining about it a whining about it are NOT the same thing."
insurgency,3cav97,KCIV,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:47:01 2015 UTC,"There are lots of maps with choke spawns that demonstrate exactly what he is saying there shouldn't be though. Panj push security spawn to A point is through a mostly wide open area with only grass, a small ravine, and a few scattered walls/cover along the way. Sinjar push security to A point is up a hill with only 2 vehicles on it and sparse cover otherwise, unless you go through the middle/right side in which case its wide open areas that are cover-to-cover. There are plenty more examples of choked spawn points. On Sinjar plenty of people do take an LMG prone and spray down the area just outside of the spawn. The thing is you're supposed to use smoke to quickly push out of the spawn chokes."
insurgency,3cav97,BluesReds,2,Mon Jul 6 19:25:25 2015 UTC,Frequency of a mistake does not make it better ;)  also examples of push and panj are not exactly idealistic examples of how things should be.
insurgency,3cav97,KCIV,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:14:16 2015 UTC,"Well, I think that's because we disagree that it's a mistake in the first place. ;)  I don't mind there being a few maps/points that require a heavy smoke 'n rush to the objective through undefensible territory."
insurgency,3cav97,BluesReds,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:22:36 2015 UTC,"There's an argument to be made that spawn camping is playing the game too. If you can shoot them, why wouldn't you? If the goal of the game is to rack up as many kills or keep them from capturing an OBJ, what's really stopping you from taking the most advantageous spot? If you didn't want to be killed as soon as you spawned, you should've picked a better team or set up a better defense before the spawn camping started. You can spin these arguments any way you want.  And you could go back and forth about this for days, but as long as there's differing levels of honor about how the game should be played, then nobody will ever reach a consensus."
insurgency,3cav97,INGWR,3,Mon Jul 6 18:26:58 2015 UTC,True... except the maps are designed poorly to benefit spawn campers. You should never design a map where the newly spawned team must cross a GIANT open road or field to get to the playable map. It is very easy to fix these problems. We have been suggesting such things since 2013.  This is just one thread on spawn killing that was recently made. https://www.reddit.com/r/insurgency/comments/34z3fz/discussion_spawn_killing/cr0fy81  I have created more diagrams on other posts showing the issues of spawn camping. I'd need to dig to find them though.

insurgency,3cav97,KCIV,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:50:51 2015 UTC,"Sure, the difference is that the game is setup so that this specifically cannot happen by disabling your weapon and putting a big red box in the middle of your screen and telling you to GTFO."
insurgency,3cav97,BluesReds,4,Mon Jul 6 18:40:38 2015 UTC,"Spawn killing is part of the game and a very valid strategy.  Nobody is entitled to a uncontested path to the objective.  If your team just took an objective in firefight, bet your ass I'm gunning down as many of you as I can before you can get to another.  Put your guard up sooner.  If I can shoot you, you can shoot me.  That's not directed towards OP in particular, but more towards the complainers.  Instead of blaming someone else, fix your game and prevent it from happening.  Don't get caught with your pants down, and perhaps don't get dominated to the point where you can't even get out of your spawn.  Or better yet, go a different route."
insurgency,3cav97,maplenut,2,Mon Jul 6 14:43:36 2015 UTC,"There is counter spawn camping too.  If you get spawn camped camp them back harder. On ministry skirmish I meet a lot of spawn campers. I can usually clean them out quite easily.  A certain group I play with are super coordinated and will camp every single exit (4) on ministry if we get spawn camped (front door, back door, car park ramp and back alley). Normally we don't but when we meet spawn campers. It makes a lot of people cry"
insurgency,3cav97,Leetenghui,0,Mon Jul 6 15:23:18 2015 UTC,"Put your guard up sooner. If I can shoot you, you can shoot me   Pfft young Padawan. The best form of spawn camping is where they cannot shoot you back. Therefore explosives are the finest ways to spawn camp. The great part about it is you can pick up explosives off corpses to perpetuate the cycle.  District for instance Sec A spawn. You can shoot out the window and be shot back. Or you can watch the spawn counter ready a nade cook it for 2-3 seconds and bounce it off the window frame. Most people on the receiving end see the nade float through the air but it is already too late.   Every one on ministry via the metal detectors expects you in one or 2 places. They never expect a nade bounced off the ceiling from one of the far cubicles."

insurgency,3cav97,maplenut,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:01:26 2015 UTC,"I avoid spawn trapping for the most part. I find it to be a tasteless and ungentlemanly way to combat the enemy team. If I feel the necessity to kill them early on in their route out of spawn, I typically pick one specific route, the garage to C on ministry for example, and hunker down at the bottom waiting for passersby. Sometimes I get no kills, sometimes I get five kills. I try not to sit right outside the red zone and wait for the poor bastards though, I tend to enjoy less one sided games in that regard."
insurgency,3cav97,OfLittleConsquence,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:35:33 2015 UTC,If some people are complaining about being spawn camped to death. Why isn't there any specific drills where spawners learn how to counter the spawn campers? It would been an interesting drill we could make it in the DGL.
insurgency,3cav97,LDClaudius,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:23:09 2015 UTC,"I feel like in most FPS's ""spawn killing"" is something that a team says when a player is being scummy and taking advantages of how a map is designed, while in Insurgency since you can't actually spawn kill players say spawn killing so they can warn their team that an enemy is attacking near the spawn. It's a case of complaining about the other teams tactics versus making your team aware about the other teams tactics."
