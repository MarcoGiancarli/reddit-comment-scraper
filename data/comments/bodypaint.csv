bodypaint,2f3xud,QuickSpore,2,Mon Sep 1 12:18:38 2014 UTC,Not especially. Liquid latex is designed to go directly on skin and shouldn't irritate it too much. But some of the compounds (formaldehyde) in LL are natural irritants. So you can't eliminate that possibility entirely.  Also as to the previous comment about hair... most people have hair everywhere. I helped on a piece which was full body latex. The model later said that removing it from her bikini area was the easiest as she shaved it in preparation. But places like belly and rib cage she didn't think to shave. And it hurt like a bitch to remove.

Can you let me know what type of airbrush/ paint is safe for this kind of use? Also GREAT stencils love all of the geometric shapes it has a very alex grey feel to it!
bodypaint,1zuzqx,dangsway,1 point,Thu Apr 3 14:44:00 2014 UTC,"You want to find one that specifies its for body. I started out just typing in Airbrush body paint. Now there are two different types, plus a hybrid of the two from what I can understand. The water based will last 1-1 1/2 days, alcohol based paint (which must be cleaned with alcohol don't forget) is basically the same stuff a typical temporary tattoo is made out of. The colors I think aren't as vibrant or blend as well, but they can last over a week! I usually would get the cheapest water based paints by Custom Body Art. Next purchase will be from pro air, they are a lot more expensive, but will lat for three days, are water proof which is great because when your painting performers orf people at festivals they tend to sweat a lot, and they blend very nicely. Hope that helps!"
