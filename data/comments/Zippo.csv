The ones without normal boxes, I put the sticker on a piece of aluminum foil and stick it somewhere in the box if I can, if not, I keep it off to the side or behind the box on my display.

I too remove the sticker and flint because of the damage the sticker can have on the finish (especially a brass case) and  the flint because flint is corrosive after a period. I have restored a couple hundred or so older Zippo's and the flint turns into a corrosive dust and gums the flint tube up....sometimes permanently.
