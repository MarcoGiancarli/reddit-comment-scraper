iosgaming,3e5q86,nhal,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:10:05 2015 UTC,"Man, Titan Quest is such an amazing game but I can't imagine playing it with touch controls. I played a kiting archer once where I was basically a glass gun and relied on kiting to stay alive. That would be impossible on mobile."

iosgaming,3dzma7,Poustache,6,Mon Jul 20 20:38:21 2015 UTC,"The core mechanic is pretty good, although not initially intuitive as a) the scoring system isn't well explained and has too many levels of bonus and multipliers from the bears and b) you're essentially punished for making long words by being overwhelmed with letters, especially in the early game on open boards. The pay model has a similar weirdness - £4 gets you unlimited honey (necessary to play more than 2 rounds in one go) but not unlimited coins, meaning that you're still constrained in areas even after coughing up.  I'd still recommend trying it for the core gameplay and polish alone, but it's another example of a great idea hamstrung by overloaded mechanics and bewildering monetisation."
iosgaming,3dzma7,MrChug,2,Mon Jul 20 22:39:21 2015 UTC,"No offense, but I disagree with all the cons you listed.  The scoring is pretty upfront, given that: (1) each bear explicitly lists its multiplier; (2) each word lists its score in real time; (3) 'bigger bear = more points' is intuitive. The word creation is highly open and welcoming of player autonomy, as opposed to most word games that require a swipe-to-match for making words.  You aren't overly penalized for making long words, nor under penalized for short words. The strategy, in general, is race for starred letters and then work around them, since they buy you the most time. Making longer words is extremely powerful in timed games, and making the best word out of the letters with the least time is the best strategy for bigger boards. Bigger boards are all about spatial management and looking ahead to see after your current combination that the existing letters with the least amount of turns are workable. I too first thought that longer words = bad, but its really more nuanced, and after changing my processing of the board, it's much easier for me to clear whole boards without stones.   Also, their pay model is WAAAAY too nice. It's 5 dollars to eliminate the energy mechanic, which is really the only currency, since the 'hard' currency is generated from playing games, which cost 'soft' currency to play, which are generated by time. So after paying 4.99, you get to generate as much of the harder currency as you want without ever having to wait on a re-energize time. It's extremely generous of them as developers and completely against market sensibility, so they can provide a less scumbag game. Heck, the bears could have been montizable, both in acquisition and pay-for-leveling, and they didn't do that because they wanted to provide a more fair market approach for the consumer. 'Coughing up' is such an exaggeration--you aren't entitled to the world for 5 dollars, and yet, Spry Fox gives you the world, and you still took offense by it.  This is a fantastic, forward thinking game, that is intuitive and extremely generous for consumers. It's not hamstung by anything, and the only bewildering part is how Spry Fox will make money, since they are giving the whole monetization away with a 5 dollar purchasable. Find me another F2P word game giving the player the keys to the hard currency drip, please. I'd love to support more devs with kind hearts.

iosgaming,3dzma7,McPhage,0,Tue Jul 21 01:07:45 2015 UTC,"This is the biggest fault with the game, because the leaderboard integration is extremely low, so the only real reason to have this on is for cheat detection, which could be done after the end of a session (just check server side for odd-ball scores or something).

iosgaming,3dv041,geoelectric,19,Sun Jul 19 20:47:50 2015 UTC,"I think part of the reason is because it is free on android while it's 2.99 on Apple app store and at that price point, there are many other premium games that are of equal or better quality, so it's nothing special for us iOS users."

It is definitely top 3 of all the rogue-likes I've played and I've played most. It's hard and you die a lot but the satisfaction of finding some decent kit and, for a short time, being better than the baddies is great. The game creates its own moments for example, I was cornered by flies in a room full of plants and about to die. I grabbed a potion (which had not been identified) and threw it into the melee. Turns out it was a potion of flame and it ignited everything; plants, flies, me. Jumped into a small patch of water, putting myself out and watched as the baddies died a fiery death. I died in the next room walking onto a trap.    Definitely worth the money if you like exploring, collecting stuff and sobbing as the 15th level fighter you've created kills himself with an unidentified wand."
iosgaming,3dv041,mundungous,6,Mon Jul 20 04:02:01 2015 UTC,I think its a pretty good game but a little to random for my tastes.

Other iterations of the original Rogue like NetHack or Brogue are less luck dependent than PD (you can still have good or bad runs, but it's easier to manage your bad luck).    There's even a really popular (and incredibly well done) mod for PD known as Shattered Pixel Dungeons that introduces new content to the game and addresses some of the most frustrating mechanics of the vanilla version (like item durability)."

One is that you play a bunch of short games before stumbling on a long one.

iosgaming,3dv041,geoelectric,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:07:19 2015 UTC,"Also it's not completely random. You are guaranteed, at least, a certain amount of food from one boss level to the next. You need to learn to manage that and you won't starve to death."

iosgaming,3dt8ib,reformed_nice_guy,2,Sun Jul 19 12:09:48 2015 UTC,Picked it up today for the iPad. It plays well so far (finished the tutorial missions) and looks great.
iosgaming,3dt8ib,PlasticityDC,2,Sun Jul 19 13:34:45 2015 UTC,"Great game - I absolutely love it.  I haven't finished normal yet, but I'm really enjoying the strategy and depth of the characters / equipment (I can't wait to acquire some of the more advanced cards).  I would certainly purchase this again and won't hesitate to purchase any expansions.  Three very minor issues.  First the rounds are a bit long (partly because I'm so conservative) so I find that I really need to reserve a block of time to play.  This isn't a 15 minute pick-up game.    The second issue, and my fault really, is that the game takes a long, long time to load.  After starting the app, it takes ~85 seconds before the menu loads.  Between rounds, it takes ~30 seconds to load the maps.  The game is certainly playable, but there is a bit of waiting for maps / menus.  I couldn't figure out what was going on, until I realized that I was playing on a 3rd generation iPad.  I've never thought about which version of iPad I was using as I've never had this issue before. Caveat emptor I suppose.  On my wife's v4 iPad the load times are much more bearable, but still lengthy (didn't time it though).  The final issue is that I find the game drains the batter very, very quickly.  I wouldn't consider playing this game on an airplane.  This doesn't seem to be an iPad v3 issue though, as when I tried the game on my wife's v4 iPad, I experience the same problem."
iosgaming,3dt8ib,Excuse_my_GRAMMER,2,Mon Jul 20 12:41:23 2015 UTC,"The loading time is absolutely a thing - I haven't experienced more battery drain than I'd expect with a game of this type.

iosgaming,3dq8o0,Se589,2,Sat Jul 18 15:33:41 2015 UTC,"Tried it on iPhone. Nice idea, altough (sadly) not the first of its kind, has way too frequent ads on the title screen and general menu area (at times 2 on top of each other), followed by none at all during the gameplay, which means a pretty bad first impression followed by way better stuff that users might not get to see - you might want to rebalance that.  I really like the idea of a checkered background and easily distinguishable nodes to connect, but the actual background looks pretty bad on smaller playing fields (e.g. 5x5), while the 14x14-board looks fine, altough prety tricky on mobile devices.  Compared to ""Flow Free"", which is pretty much the same game with more content, since it's been around for a longer time, I'm missing the feature that automatically draws a straight line towards your new position if you slip outside the borders of the field for a second. Drawing over existing connections removes them, which is totally expected, but I'd like to see them restored if you erase the intersections during the same action. (Maybe only change the board state after the end of a turn and display a preview before that?) I accidentally managed to find a visual(?) bug, where the game draws two lines on top of each other. (In this picture, the yellow and green lines overlap right above the ""a"" of ""Congratulations"".)  And PLEASE, remove the ads on App (Re-)Opening. It is really annoying to accidentally click on an ad, being forced out into the app store, and receiving another ad on Re-Entry, which easily causes a mis-click again if you don't expect it. (Especially if loading the ad takes a while.)  All in all, the app is quite well done for something that just came out, but some more tweaks might go a long way towards making the experience much better.  EDIT: The pictured bug appeared in the last 14x14-Level"

iosgaming,3dndyo,36yearsofporn,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:01:31 2015 UTC,"I've enjoyed it quite a bit, but I liked Warhammer Quest and Hunter 1 & 2 as well.  It's running fine on my iPhone 6+, but not as good on my iPad 3rd generation. Don't know whether it's the processor or the RAM.  Pros:    fun turn based combat.  Not too hard in the beginning, but not a walk in the park - harder levels unlocked after finishing the 40 mission campaign I'm in the 31-35 mission category. The appearance of a massive new enemy (the carnifex) and a series of attacks proved to be more challenging than the other missions I'd encountered Good graphics using the Unreal 4 engine. It's top down, but you can tilt the camera a little if you want a bit of an angle from which to view the different characters Lots of weapons to choose from Fun voice acting between the characters during battles! They start to repeat themselves after a while, but it's fun having references to the WH4K lore. The voice acting is very professional.    Cons:   inapp purchases are relatively expensive. The game is $4.99, then it's possible to buy potluck weapons/marines/accessories at 2 packs for $2.99, 10 packs for $14.99, and 30 packs for $36.99. It's not necessary at all to buy any of those, but if you don't getting some of the rarer weapons/marines/accessories is going to take a while Loading times on the 6+ aren't too bad, but they're noticeably long on the iPad 3. My guess is a good 30 seconds or so, especially when the game is just starting up. Oh, that just starting up thing? It happens a lot on the iPad 3.  The game on the iPad 3 is now stuck in a loop. The specific scenario causes the game to crash, but there's nothing I can do to reset the scenario/game, including closing the app or even restarting the device. Other than uninstalling and installing again, which would require me to start over. I have an email into support, but I don't expect a response, soon. I'm sure they're overwhelmed with all the things that go into launching a new game. It's a small studio. I'm just hopeful they'll come out with an update in the near future that gets the game out of this loop. No syncing between devices.    Regardless of my personal difficulties, I highly recommend it for people who like turn based combat games. Don't spend any money on IAPs if you have anything less than the latest iOS devices, until they come up with a solution to the perma crash."

iosgaming,3dns86,Casual--Loafer,3,Fri Jul 17 19:48:49 2015 UTC,"Wayward Souls.  It combines three of my favorites things in a game. Procedurally generated roguelike, hardcore action rpg, and retro 16 bit sprite art.  Best game on ios."
iosgaming,3dns86,ThirdStrongestBunny,3,Sun Jul 19 16:08:05 2015 UTC,"The Walking Dead.   I don't care if there's no real 'gameplay'. I don't care that it's episode based or the price. I don't even care that the second episode was a huge letdown.   The Walking dead game is an amazing story, one where I felt implicated and actually cared what happened to the main characters and the payoff was amazing... and it all happened on my phone. This came out (relatively) early in the history of iOS game so I feel like it kind of broke some of the preconceptions that I had about what a mobile game was and could be.  Also, now that I'm a father the whole game takes on new meaning. Just an awesome experience."
iosgaming,3dns86,HouseTully,2,Mon Jul 20 16:56:05 2015 UTC,"A little weird, buuuut...  Zombieville 2:  I'm a sucker for zombie games. Maxed out the game in a week, the grinding was fun and I still play it every now and then. I liked seeing the weapons change at max level and playing with friends, although sadly that experience is very glitchy and even more now that the game has cars.  I just wish it kept getting updates, it was really fun using all the weapons and trying to get every achievement."
iosgaming,3dns86,Robadoba,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:10:43 2015 UTC,"I'm going to have to go with Chrono Trigger, because, well, it's Chrono Trigger.  If that's not a good enough answer... it has the best story and music of any iOS game I've played, and the gameplay ultimately includes lots of nonlinearity and interesting decisions. Every character feels unique, so different parties play very differently. Yes the controls can be annoying, but it's not insurmountable. I had never played Chrono Trigger before, and no other game kept me glued to my screen in the same way."

If you ever wanted to know how it feels to command the USS Enterprise, the Battlestar Galactica or Serenity, then this game is for you. Man the canons, there's a whole lot of space between you and your destination! Heroes of Might and Magic III: It's all about the castles! Classic RPG/Strategy game. Feels so good to use this on a touchscreen. Raise an army, kill enemies, collect artifacts, capture castles. Love this game! XCom: Enemy Within: THE Strategy game for iOS. Fight off alien hordes on your mission to save the planet. Customize your squad and take out the little green (and big green) intruders. Minecraft: This is for scratching that creative itch. World building takes a lot of time! I love just starting a new world, exploring and when I find the most picturesque scene building a city on top of it."

iosgaming,3do0uy,ralph1933,2,Sat Jul 18 02:50:46 2015 UTC,"I think it's up to the dev.  If he/she thinks the game should only be enjoyed on a big screen, then it's his or her choice.  If I spent days/months/years making a game, I would not want people to think, ""I can't fucking see anything on this!"" or , ""I have to scroll around way too much"".  Sure, making it iPad only limits the amount of people who will play it, but IMO it's the lesser of the two evils.  Tough choice for sure."
iosgaming,3do0uy,Jorlen,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:51:54 2015 UTC,"Mixed opinion.   A lot of games benefit from the iPad's extra room.  Especially the full iPad, not the mini.  For example, I really can't play Kingdom Rush on my iPhone 6.  Possible but not enjoyable. I want an iPhone option because ... my kids have taken over the iPad and I really don't use it anymore (Yes, I could take it back, but I do want them to have a machine of their own).  So, if you have an iPad-only game, I'll probably ignore it.   I would play games like Kingdom Rush more often if their saved games synced between iPad & iPhone (FR has 2 non-Universal versions).  That way I'd suffer through on the iPhone but play on the iPad when I really wanted to enjoy it."

iosgaming,3dlyef,bws201,6,Fri Jul 17 10:02:42 2015 UTC,"Maybe... App developers have an habit of ""soft launching"" their apps in a few smaller markets (like Canada, Australia, New Zealand...) to fine-tune and fix issues before the big worldwide launch.  If it's the case for Angry Birds 2, it may be under a different name though."

You didn't mention if you're playing on iPad or iPhone, so I'll make suggestions for both.  iPhone-   Hitman Go (already mentioned)  Monster Hunter Freedom Unite (if you haven't played a MH game before the learning curve can be a little stiff, but hey you have plenty of time).   Devil's Attorney an odd-ball turn based RPG where you play an attorney wining court cases, I really enjoyed this.   Detective Grimoire An excellent and stylish mystery game.  iPad:  This War of Mine Amazing.  Don't Starve if you haven't already played Don't Starve, remedy this now.  Papers, Please Like This War of Mine this is a game with a message and beautifully executed game-play.  Hitman Sniper a little repetitive, but addictive.   iOS games, Honorable mentions: Radiation Island, Shadowrun Returns, Bastion, Five Nights at Freddy's, Sid Meier's Pirates, Legend of Grimrock, Star Command"

Also, if you can beat Sonic the Hedgehog 2, you are a true gaming master. It's possibly the best SEGA port to iOS ever.  If you're into tower defense, geoDefense is where it's at.  I put my phone into airplane mode just to be sure, but Fallout Shelter works offline too! Seriously the best freemium app I've played ever. Haven't spent a dime on it either.  Edit: I'll keep adding more as I think of them. I only keep a couple games with me.  Something else I've done in the past was rent a couple movies from the iTunes Store. Load one (or two) before you go, watch them, delete them, load a couple more before your return flight."

Nice art, but with low hardware requirements; relatively deep gameplay, but with the ability to play in short bursts; a pay-once pricing model at a price that allows the developers to hopefully make some money while giving consumers what they pay for up-front. Games like FTL and Out There also fit this description."

Also if you're zoomed out, the little character cards will always block the rooms in the lower right corner -- there's no way to scroll down far enough to have the cards in an empty spot below the room, unless you zoom in. Just a small complaint, though.  I'm enjoying it so far although I was extremely lost on my first day. I wound up putting as much stuff from my collection into my dude's bag when he went out his first night because I thought it was telling me that my characters had to leave their house... so I was like ""oh no, I have to choose what items I want to save and take with me to my next house!""

This all takes a bit of research. You're up for at least 1 hour of googling and youtubing ""how to's"" of this stuff. It's really not hard at all. Requires no coding or anything like that from you.

The game felt really good and well polished, but the options felt limited but that's understandable if the game is going to be for IOS.   If your going for a PC launch you may want to add jumping with spacebar, crouching, grenades, and possibly powerups for defeating enemys. I really liked the AI, and I think instead of simply having a number indicating your ammo, you might want to have a bar/meter or something because it was a tad annoying to look away from the screen to check bullets, especially when you go in guns blazing with that many enemys."

iosgaming,3d8w6t,NickyNichols,2,Tue Jul 14 17:14:09 2015 UTC,"There's definitely a learning curve. Here's a couple of tips:   Find a weapon or weapons that you can (and have fun) playing. I use Longswords or Lances. I found dual swords too 'loose' and fast, and greatswords and hammers too slow and clunky. Some people love ranged but I could never get used to the 'run and gun' style of play. But again, try them all out in the training school to see which you like best. Armor skills really help. Each armour has skills associated with it. Usually having a full set will activate these skills (you need 10 for it to activate, usually 2 points per piece of armour). These can be things like cold resistance (which is nice in the snowy hills), damage up, resistance to attacks, etc. Equipping the right armour for a certain monster will help the battle a lot. Elemental damage and resistance. This is super important for doing the most amount of damage on certain monsters. Khezu for example is really weak against fire, especially on his head. So, make a weapon with fire damage and go to town. Similarly, he attacks with thunder element. So if your armour is resistant against that the fight will be easier. You'll have to farm a decent amount of ores, bones, plants and other material for crafting. This is what the Gathering quests are for. There's no boss monsters and you can basically go around collecting materials and also getting Pokke points (which you'll use for upgrading your farm and other stuff). Companions help a lot! The cat companions will help attack or distract your enemies- or heal you. Personally I hate the ones that throw bombs because they interrupt my attacks so I go for a cat that doesnt attack, and has only heal/buff skills. But do what works best with your play style.   Apart from that, basically just use the wikis to help with individual enemies and crafting."

It sounds like it soft release in another country (for beta testing)  It might be weeks or even months before they release it global   That being said if u don't want to wait for it to release here just make an iTunes account for the country and download the game (all progress is saved on Game Center account which is different from iTunes/App Store )

iosgaming,3daoht,x3pwnage,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:53:49 2015 UTC,"Almost all of the developers launch in NZ first due to the time zones. Usually by 11 pm the night of NZ launches, the U.S. gets the game, too. It's not JUST a game for NZ. Also, in the article, it specifically mentions how games start in NZ and spread through other regions as the time zones catch up. This is almost always the case with apps, especially with big name developers or household brand name developers. I appreciate your feedback and your recommendation, but the app I'm asking about should have been available a week ago, if typical launch cycles were observed, so I was asking for information a Google search couldn't provide me, like if anyone was a member of a DC Comics forum with background info or some such situation."

Basically you do combat turn-based on a chess-like board with a limited amount of action points per character. Other common sub-genres are cRPG (classic - like Baldurs Gate), aRPG (action - like Diablo / Torchlight) and jRPG (japanese - like Final Fantasy). Hope that helped a bit."

However, it also adds a tactical element of moving your fighters to good cover positions and using spells / abilities that affect an area.  So how and where you position your team during combat is as important as the strengths and equipment of the individual fighter."
iosgaming,3d5u9w,nhal,2,Tue Jul 14 10:51:28 2015 UTC,"To be honest that was kinda disapointing, although the game looks interesting. What I mean by that is that yo shouldn't try to sell your game so hard, the project already looks promising but it's clearly really underdeveloped. The animations aren't crisp and that clearly isn't ""console-quality graphics"". It caught my interest because the idea seems good and I don't really care about how the game looks but both this post and the video itself look more amateur than anything (which isn't anything bad per se)"

What I mean is that the game is... clunky. If I saw a 30s movie-maker (just kidding, I couldn't do better but that it's clearly not made by a professional, but I don't care since I'm about the game not it's trailers) preview of a game like NetHack/Dream Quest/Battle for Wesnoth/etc. it wouldn't catch my interest, since the overall apeal of the game resides in it's mechanics and the UI/animations/etc. are cluncky.

In this case, we just took the stock apple app preview template and added gameplay recorded from a test device.

iosgaming,3d5vqu,Poustache,2,Mon Jul 13 19:40:36 2015 UTC,"Despite it is powered by UE4, the game looks pretty underwhelming from screenshots.

The top down view made it harder to see the models of the marines and environment.  Hopefully it will be good, without any sort of annoying microtrasactions."

iosgaming,3d5vqu,WaveLightGames,2,Tue Jul 14 01:59:00 2015 UTC,"If you looked at the Space Marine selection screen, they arent all Ultramarines. The game uses a mixture of Space Marines from different chapters, just like what Deathwatch supposed to be. Deathwatch's members are composed from the best soldiers from each chapter while they have access to some rare and powerful weapons that other chapters do not have access to because Deathwatch is essentially the elite specialised unit for alien hunting for Imperium of Man."

I build a few copies of rooms, they're inhabited by some people and it looks promising, then the repetition sets in and I realize how shallow the game is.  Other than an occasional interruption by a raid, bugs or fire (and those are the only three events) there isn't anything to do.  There's very little to achieve, play, interact, or manage in this game.  If it didn't have the Fallout skin, people would have quickly dismissed it for being inferior to Tiny Tower."
iosgaming,3d216m,i010011010,9,Sun Jul 12 22:19:40 2015 UTC,"Ya. I played it pretty hard for the week it came out.. just to the point of getting up to level 100 to see what the final unlock was. After the disappointment of it, I deleted it. Just nothing more to do from that point, and even up to then it was pretty ""meh"". Kept waiting for some stronger attacks [super mutants? death claws?] but it was just the same stuff.  Had some promise and room for growth but fell flat pretty short."

iosgaming,3d216m,EnsignRedshirt,2,Mon Jul 13 05:45:37 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't even say it's typical because generally freemium is where so much attention has gone.  There are some really impressive freemium games in terms of graphics and production values.  This particular game seems like a great test case in terms of how little gameplay can we get away with not having?  It really is just a timer mechanic set to a Fallout skin, with all the depth of a screensaver."
iosgaming,3d216m,i010011010,3,Mon Jul 13 22:27:46 2015 UTC,"Indeed. After the first few days, the challenge completely dissipates. After that, resources are only as scarce as you make them by introducing new dwellers, and even then caps and dwellers are so abundant that you can easily run new resource rooms. Events are dealt with easily, and don't even scale to the size of your vault.   There's really no incentive to go back."
iosgaming,3d216m,Donners22,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:46:32 2015 UTC,"It's interesting that folks alternatively seem to find the game too easy or too hard.  I think it is a little bit of both in that getting past the initial push to get a well equipped Vault can result in some wipes if you aren't careful, but once you figure out the formula there are few shake ups.  There is certainly more they could do with it, but I didn't mind that the challenge trailed off several days in.  At that point I think the challenge is doing enough quests to get Lunchboxes and collect the unique Dwellers/Weapons/Outfits - which would certainly take a long time if you were a completionist."

iosgaming,3d216m,EnsignRedshirt,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:56:02 2015 UTC,"I don't think he's criticizing the developers, rather he's merely pointing out that there is, for lack of a better term, a balance issue between female and male vault dwellers. It's typical of most modern videogames to make no material difference between male characters and female characters, so to say that the game is ""sexist"" is just a way of pointing out that there is a difference.  In real life, there are material differences between men and women. However, there doesn't need to be a difference between male and female videogame characters, and so the vast majority of games don't bother having any. Having women get pregnant in the game may be more realistic, but there is an argument to be made that it's unnecessary."
iosgaming,3d216m,Baryn,4,Mon Jul 13 05:39:38 2015 UTC,"There needs to be a difference if the developer wants to simulate reproduction. As has been established in Fallout lore, that involves traditional bun-in-the-oven style.   There is nothing sexist here, it's more like the concept of sexism itself is being abused (not at all unusual in the gaming scene)."
iosgaming,3d216m,EnsignRedshirt,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:53:44 2015 UTC,"The original Sims game had no pregnancy, just a baby that appeared after two Sims agreed to procreate. It's not necessary, it's just a thematic choice. It does, however, add a difference between sexes. The author chooses to call it ""sexist"". It's not good or bad, it's just a choice by the devs to make it work that way, and it's a choice by the author to view it as such."
iosgaming,3d216m,Baryn,8,Mon Jul 13 06:42:26 2015 UTC,The author is being silly for calling pregnant women sexist. I think it's an interesting mechanic.
iosgaming,3d216m,EnsignRedshirt,-3,Mon Jul 13 06:47:14 2015 UTC,"See above comment to IDontHaveUsername.  To be clear, I'm not calling the game sexist per se.  I said the Post-Apocalypse was sexist in the article, and by that I meant that an apocalyptic event would likely force the remaining humans to skew towards a less equal society in some ways.  As for the game, like you say, I can see its a style choice and I'm alright with it.  Being the hand of the Overseer that directs these interactions made me think about how fragile some of the freedoms we enjoy are, so if anything the style choices served a purpose in making me think - and the alternative would have been way too grim to be fun as a game.  Even GTA doesn't have kids or pregnant women in it last I checked."
iosgaming,3d216m,fidelityastro,2,Mon Jul 13 11:59:04 2015 UTC,"For sure, I totally see where you're coming from in your article. The game isn't mysogynistic, but it is skewed in its treatment of different sexes in a way that most videogames are not. You're just pointing that out, which is a real thing. I noticed it, too, when I played. It was right after I had every woman in my vault impregnated one after the other by one dude I left in the living quarters. I was like ""hmm, this is an... interesting... mechanic"".  Again, not good or bad, per se, but definitely notable."
iosgaming,3d216m,JarasM,0,Mon Jul 13 14:59:11 2015 UTC,"The author is saying that the portrayal of pregnant women in-game is a sexist one, not that babies are delivered by storks."
iosgaming,3d216m,fidelityastro,3,Mon Jul 13 02:13:17 2015 UTC,"Why is it sexist? The pregnant women in the game are as capable as non-pregnant or men. The only difference is th that they get yellow shirts.   Our is that sexist? Ordering pregnant women around, assigning them jobs and tasks? In such a case, I feel I may have already lost this argument for being a man that can order around in-game women."
iosgaming,3d216m,JarasM,-2,Mon Jul 13 07:07:00 2015 UTC,"You're being really obtuse. The main complaints about the game (other than it being a duller version of the already dull Tiny Tower) are that it encourages you to keep all the women pregnant 100% of the time and, while the women are pregnant, they behave ridiculously whenever an emergency happens.  It's a bit silly. (And has nothing to do with being able to direct female characters to do things.)"
iosgaming,3d216m,PixlProphet,2,Mon Jul 13 08:52:26 2015 UTC,"Sorry, might have gotten a bit carried away there.  Still. The game deals with a post-apocalyptic scenario. Considering that 99% of the world population died, the only way to meaningfully rebuild society is, in the end, breeding like rabbits. You don't have to get the women pregnant at all - you can wait for new dwellers to arrive, but your vault will stagnate. That is fine, this is your choice as Overseer. The game would force you otherwise, if dwellers died of age.  I'm happy that we're at a point, as a western society, where we can peruse our dreams and goals regardless of gender. The point is that the fictional Fallout universe is no longer that kind of society. The world went back to pre-industrial shit. If anything, I think the plot and setting of the games is fairly optimistic regarding role of women after the fall of civilization."
iosgaming,3d216m,Donners22,-5,Mon Jul 13 13:31:01 2015 UTC,It's the 1950's
iosgaming,3d216m,fidelityastro,5,Mon Jul 13 03:01:44 2015 UTC,"The aesthetic is the 1950s, the setting is centuries later.  The original Fallout was set in 2161."
iosgaming,3d216m,ryosen,3,Mon Jul 13 03:43:08 2015 UTC,By that logic why not put in some humorous racist stuff too
iosgaming,3d216m,edhere,0,Mon Jul 13 03:50:02 2015 UTC,"I didn't intend for it to be that controversial of a statement.  You've touched on exactly what I meant - that the real life truths of a hypothetical post-apocalyptic future would be uncomfortable.  My point in mentioning it in the article is that a) You will be faced with the role of the Overseer - constantly participating in these interactions which highlight the role differences between the sexes b) The representation of the role of women by the game is intentionally viewed through 50's style rose tinted glasses.  In this way being a baby factory is promoted as their main role, and there is also the false implication that they could not fight to defend themselves while pregnant.  Taking the games choices as a given, I was giving tips on how to play the game.  I filed it under the heading of sexist because those particular tips amount to keeping women pregnant all the time, giving them lesser gear, and avoiding depending on them in certain important situations because of their in game limitations."
iosgaming,3d216m,Lacasax,2,Mon Jul 13 11:53:22 2015 UTC,"It's an issue of semantics. Especially when applied to video games, the word ""sexist"" has a very negative connotation. A better way to phrase it might be that the game differentiates between the sexes and those differences need to be taken into account when determining a playing strategy."
iosgaming,3d216m,WaveLightGames,2,Mon Jul 13 15:58:53 2015 UTC,"I'm still playing. 200 dwellers. Not much challenge at this point. But I'm still playing. Every day I max out my resources, check on my wanderers, and move learners around when the max out an attribute, making sure to try to increase everyone's level in the resource rooms too so they won't get killed so easily. When everyone's attributes are all 10 and everyone's level is 50 and I have all the things, I'll consider quitting. Or when Fallout 4 comes out. Whichever comes first.  By the way, one weird thing about having 200 dwellers is that female dwellers can still get pregnant but they never have the baby."

It's hard for me to recommend games like Marvel vs Capcom 2 cause it doesn't translate well on mobile and you just get frustrated at your lack of performing moves or moving at speeds that you're used to on consoles"
iosgaming,3d0579,sleepyjared,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:13:23 2015 UTC,"The Street Fighter mobile games are pretty good, though they aren't optimized for widescreen phones (anything before an iPhone 5) which is annoying to me. They play well though. I prefer Street Fighter IV Volt out of all of them, not a huge fan of the Tekken crossover. Also there is a free version called Street Fighter IV Dojo if you want to just check it out and see what it's like.  HOWEVER, my absolute favorite iOS fighting game is Kinetic Damage. It's this fighting game that one guy worked on for over 4 years before he finally finished and released it, and it's seriously awesome. Like it does some really unique things that I think other fighting games should learn from. It's heavily based in martial arts, so no crazy fireballs or anything, but the combo system is brilliant. Also instead of an life bar you have these sections that represent each part of your body, so you actually need to focus your attacks to wear down each section of your opponent. Related to that, you can switch your stance so the right or left side of your body is facing your opponent, so like if they're whooping your ass and beating up on your left side you can switch over so your right is facing them and keep on fighting. Hard to explain but it's really cool. Anyway, the guy released it a few years ago, and has been toiling away on an online multiplayer mode ever since. He still says it's coming, but he's such a perfectionist he won't release it until there's basically zero lag. Even if it never got online, it's fun as hell single-player and if you have friends who have it there's local bluetooth multiplayer too.   So yeah, sorry for the huge comment, but Kinetic Damage is rad. There is a free version of that too so definitely give it a try. It takes a bit to learn the ins and outs but it's very worth investing the time in."

iosgaming,3cuu6n,maapevro,3,Fri Jul 10 23:26:44 2015 UTC,"I'm an avid podcast follower so I'm in the same boat as you! Here are some recomendations:     Dungeon Quest (aRPG, loot heavy). This is probably my favourite one since I don't have to think at all. It's grindy nature makes me clear floor after floor without even thinking that much into it, but the weapon and class system make it really replayable. Don't get turned down because of the freemium model. There are no timers or paywalls and the ads are intrussive, but removable. Endless Runners Alto's Adventure, Punch Quest, Smash Hit to name a few. They don't require much thinking so you can focus onto the audiobook if you don't get to engaged.   Plague, Inc (Strategy infection) The nature of the game itself makes for not much tapping and lots of waiting to see how your disease evolves.   Agar.io (Multiplayer Online Arena). This is one of my favourite time wasters on PC and it just came out for iOS, don't think it has anything to do with the MOBA genre, check it out to see what's all the fuzz about.   Siralim Pokemon-like game with lots of random dungeons and leveling, ideal mindless farming for your porposes.   Most RPGs with a difficulty setting One thing I used to do a lot was picking just some random roguelike or RPG and play it on a easy difficulty setting that allowed me to focus on something else. Games like Skulls of the Shogun, FTL, Kingdom Rush Series, Rymdkapsel, Battle for Wesnoth, amongst others are great examples.   Survival Games (Minecraft, Terraria, Junk Jack X, Don't Starve). Depending on how familiar you are with each one of those you'll have to focus more or less on some tasks. They all share the same premise: the more yo know about the game the easier it gets to do stuff in it. Since they are not story driven you can do simplier tasks on them assuming you played them before and are used to their functioning.   Cookie Clickers Even though I dislike the genre it's low level of engagement sounds just about right for your purpose. If you're into this kind of game check them out! The last one I tried was CivCrafter if you want a reference."

I have a ton of legit iOS games but I tend to be more media focused when I used my devices. A lot of AAA iOS games demand your audio. Fuck that.  Most Square/Enix games are JRPGs where you can coast on grinding while zoning out to good audio. They're my gaming wheelhouse generally. Expensive.   The Quest Gold is astounding old school CRPG/Eye of the Beholder style but will sometimes make you pause and read. It's overly verbose.  Any of the Bioware CRPGs are gold, Baldur's Gate I, II, Icewind Dale. The audio on these games was boring to begin with. They play great on an iPhone 6+ or higher res. Personally, I prefer Icewind Dale over BG on a device.  I LOVE Sorcery 1-3 but it takes audio back on every turn so I basically can only play it on an iPad while my phone runs Downcast.

Apple should implement a way to download paid apps on a trial basis for 15min or something. Just change the Buy button to Reject so if the app is not what was expected you can cancel the transaction and the app is deleted. I don't think Apple care though, might have to get Taylor Swift onto it."

What you do in games in measured. Every single step.  If adding videos (or other ads, or In App Purchases) upset most users to the point that it cost money (profits) for the developer, then those things would not happen.  Developers give you exactly what you want. All the time.  You just need to start asking for better things. (By paying for them)  You need to start asking for games you pay a living wage upfront to play, or original ideas instead of clones, or even beautiful artwork and solid gameplay instead of skinner machines and crap copycats.

iosgaming,3csvk7,Dewgongz,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:46:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah, a best buy dude tried to sell me on Apple TV.  Tried to explain to him that the lag is something I was trying to avoid.  He wouldn't back down so I just said ""no"" and walked away.  Honestly though, I was a bit disappointed when I found out how the IOS lightning to HDMI cable worked.  If it didn't do any processing then there would be almost no perceptible lag; many android devices have true HDMI out.  Apple is obviously trying hard with MFI to get a more console-like experience on their devices, and then they turn around and do this to their HDMI out.  I just want to hear from people who actually use the cable and game with it; so far it's been difficult to find these opinions."
iosgaming,3csvk7,kurozer0,2,Fri Jul 10 14:56:26 2015 UTC,I have an Apple TV and the mfi - hdmi cable.  I would say the latency when gaming is about the same using my iPhone 6.  Very disappointing.

I've never bought the whole, 'we need more women in X industry' thing.  If we need more people in games journalism or, where I hear it more often, engineering, then we need more people, not specifically more women.  Give men and women equal opportunity to enter the field, and let those individuals make the choice to enter.    When it comes to reading, whether it's novels or news articles or reviews, the only time I think about the gender of the author is if the author makes a point to mention it.  Hell I read touch arcade every day, and at least skim most of the articles posted, and I can probably count on one hand the number of times I've even happened to notice the author's name.

Entertainment is strictly subjective and writing about entertainment is enhanced by drastically different points of view especially when it's something as fundementally for everyone as phone games.  Women bring a different perspective, and the white & asian male perspective that a lot of games sites write from does make them less interesting than they could be."
iosgaming,3crgto,andyster,2,Tue Jul 14 13:47:07 2015 UTC,"I think the ""problem"", if at all there is any, is that gamers are not accustomed to blending social commentary within game reviews, which is something that has become common of late. They'd just want a review done about the game in proper, and not veer off into social issues and political correctness and the likes of it."
iosgaming,3crgto,ehodapp,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:22:23 2015 UTC,For me that pushes me away from game sites and gaming and is driving me towards other forms of entertainment and criticism.
iosgaming,3crgto,jayjaywalker3,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:46:49 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure I get you. Do you mean you're not fond of this ""shift"" in style of games journalism?"
iosgaming,3crgto,ehodapp,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:48:06 2015 UTC,No I like social criticism in games and barely give a fuck about product review that treats games like they would some industrial product where we're concerned about the number of widgets for the dollar and not how you felt playing it. I'm a dude who used to really go to games and sites that write about games as pretty much all my entertainment and they didn't grow with my interests.

iosgaming,3crgto,Corndog_Enthusiast,-4,Fri Jul 10 21:32:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I get it. Going in this direction is a business decision. As it is, your female readership (relative to male) is increasing, and there is a greater market to tap in and expand to there.   It's just people have gotten sick of social commentaries about women and minorities etc being used as political tools in the game journalism sphere. It was good to see TA stay out of this till now for the most part, but alas, that's where the money lies."
iosgaming,3crgto,andyster,-4,Fri Jul 10 12:02:32 2015 UTC,"Oh pleaaaase get over yourself. Do you really have to see any attempt at equality as being done for business reasons? Maybe having a writing team that is more representative of the audience is a good thing. Maybe having a more balanced gender ratio of writers is just a good thing, period."
iosgaming,3cjrad,Deeliciousness,12,Wed Jul 8 13:27:41 2015 UTC,Wow... the OG playing catch-up to the new hotness. Good luck MTG! Hearthstone is so ridiculously-polished it's gonna be a long road for you... the path to broad appeal probably involves pissing off your core fans. :(
iosgaming,3cjrad,CrazyEdward,12,Wed Jul 8 18:09:08 2015 UTC,"Well the game ain't changing. MtG is always gonna be MtG. They just packaged it in Hearthstonesque pricing. Truthfully hearthstone was always MtG lite, faster and with broader appeal, so it will probably stay more popular."
iosgaming,3cjrad,KingBee,5,Wed Jul 8 19:13:27 2015 UTC,"Not just hearthstonesque pricing. Hearthstone is just sooooo much smoother to play digitally. There has been no good UI/interface for a MTG computer game yet IMO. The steam versions left much to be desired, I'm liking the improvements I am seeing in the mobile version so far.  I am that audience demanding a faster game, but MTG gameplay speed itself is fine really, it's the terrible computer gameplay with tons of long timers and awkward gameplay of previous versions that drove me away. IMO magic is a better card game that has not served my casual digital needs until (potentially) now."
iosgaming,3cjrad,KingBee,4,Wed Jul 8 22:30:29 2015 UTC,"The long timers and have nothing to do with the computer and everything to do with the gameplay though. The way magic works is that any spell at any time can be interrupted with instants or abilities, so there has to be a timer between each spell to allow players to add spells onto the stack. It is inherently a slower and more methodical game because of this."
iosgaming,3cjrad,KingBee,5,Wed Jul 8 23:37:20 2015 UTC,"Understood, and instants are difficult to design around and there is a reason hearthstone will never implement them.  That being said, implementation was poor in the older versions. For example in the mobile version it seems the timer moves far faster. It is designed to make you pause when you want to do something so turns when you don't are faster. If I am remembering correctly the timers on the steam version were longer or the turn structure was streamlined for this version in some way."
iosgaming,3cjrad,KingBee,0,Wed Jul 8 23:45:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah the older versions were much more awkward and unwieldy, that's for sure. This is definitely the most polished iteration of MtG that I've played, but it's by nature gonna be much slower paced than hearthstone"
iosgaming,3cjrad,MrWinks,2,Thu Jul 9 00:02:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah I thought I was clearer but my complaint was with the user interface of the previous digital versions, not MTG gameplay itself, which is undoubtably more complex and thus slower.  ""MTG gameplay speed itself is fine really, it's the terrible computer gameplay with tons of long timers and awkward gameplay of previous versions that drove me away"""
iosgaming,3cjrad,zetaspawn,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:13:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah I gotcha, I was more talking about how the slower more complex game will have less popular appeal. I feel like Hearthstone will in all likelihood remain king, but MtG fans and new players desiring more depth can definitely get hooked into this one."
iosgaming,3cjrad,Four0h,2,Thu Jul 9 00:15:28 2015 UTC,That's definitely true about the fact that hearthstone has much more casual popular appeal. I'm glad this game came out though to give hearthstone some competition as they really need to fix [insert complaint here].
iosgaming,3cjrad,thekaseyjones,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:45:43 2015 UTC,"The Microprose magic games from long long ago had an amazing interface, truth be told. The hand, creatures, and placement of lands and other perms was pretty flawless. Also, it flowed quickly to allow for pacing to follow to ending games faster and not sit through too much visual glam."
iosgaming,3cjrad,insomnium138,6,Thu Jul 9 06:26:02 2015 UTC,Finally I've been waiting for this one for a while!
iosgaming,3cjrad,morelandjo,5,Wed Jul 8 13:46:16 2015 UTC,"Doesn't work on iPhone 5. :( Oh well, I'll survive with just Hearthstone."
iosgaming,3cjrad,thekaseyjones,5,Wed Jul 8 16:12:10 2015 UTC,"I just got a massive stack of magic cards from a garage sale, would this game sort of teach me how to play the physical game?"
iosgaming,3cjrad,Nerdtendo,6,Wed Jul 8 19:22:57 2015 UTC,"Most likely. When it came to the basics, the Duels of the Planeswalker games caught me enough to get started. I don't expect this to be any different."
iosgaming,3cjrad,DarkSynopsis,3,Wed Jul 8 19:48:42 2015 UTC,"I've been playing physical magic for about 15 years. I just went through the beginner tutorial and some of the story mode and I can tell you that this will definitely teach you how to play the physical card game at least at a beginner level.  It hasn't hit on anything too complex yet, but I am pretty early in the story mode and it seems to be teaching as I go."
iosgaming,3cjrad,Poustache,3,Wed Jul 8 19:50:28 2015 UTC,It absolutely does teach you how to play. Best part is the tutorial is in game so you learn while you play.
iosgaming,3cjrad,aaronisreal,3,Wed Jul 8 22:23:09 2015 UTC,"Fantastic, I been looking to get into the game for a while."
iosgaming,3cjrad,CurtisLeow,2,Thu Jul 9 01:58:01 2015 UTC,"Well, the big problem of learning MtG through a computer game is that you'll never learn the portion that involves angry friend-ending arguments over the rules."

iosgaming,3cjrad,padi_04,2,Wed Jul 8 15:46:39 2015 UTC,"As a casual Hearthstone player myself, do u think its easier to grab packs in this one or HS?"
iosgaming,3cjrad,Avarhin,3,Wed Jul 8 15:58:08 2015 UTC,"It's hard to say cause I've only played the early game of both. Both seem pretty generous in giving gold in the early game. Hearthstone dropped off fast and I suspect Magic Duels will do the same, but it's a bit early for me to call right now. My guess is that they will be very similar."
iosgaming,3cjrad,RelentlessNoodle,2,Wed Jul 8 16:15:22 2015 UTC,That sucks. The lowwww card gain in HS was why I quit it. I don’t have the drive to grind so much.

They could have made a commercial game, accepting money outright and then it wouldn't matter what people do in-game."

There's no fun :(  That is very true, but I think they did a very good job with IAPs. Lunchboxes aren't necessary, they just help out and speed up the game.

But this game has IAP just to increase your fucking card collection which is incredibly fucked up. Deleted this in less than a week IAP is ridiculous dont even waste your time. This game could've been so great but is ruined by its IAP. If you're interested in a card game just get into hearthstone.

I wish they would all offer $3-$5 monthly cards since that is a reasonable fee for all the new content and server upkeep.  This sub seems so anti freemium but all the recommended games last about five hours and get deleted and cost 1 to $10 while these freemium games probably give me a 100 hours of entertainment a month while costing the same amount.

iosgaming,3cfzpw,NickyNichols,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:51:17 2015 UTC,"I seriously thought I was the only one who thought of Eli that way. The way he acts like an ass towards commenters who disagree and other commenters backing him up just because he works there soured my opinion of the website. And the clickbaity ""console gaming is dead"" type articles (many of which are aimed at Nintendo and the 3DS for some reason) is kind of pathetic too, when every other game they rate 4~5 stars is IAP ridden trash."
iosgaming,3cfzpw,BananaProne,0,Wed Jul 8 02:15:14 2015 UTC,True.   But in all honestly if you want a smart  but simple puzzle game that also requires reflexes than this is pretty much a perfect game.
iosgaming,3cfzpw,Kalahan7,2,Tue Jul 7 20:58:54 2015 UTC,I played this in beta and fully enjoyed it. Don't regret putting $2.99 down on this at all.

iosgaming,3ch7tb,ST3ALTHSE7EN,6,Tue Jul 7 21:57:24 2015 UTC,"KOTOR  - it's a very well known Star Wars RPG, with plenty of depth and the battles are quasi-turn based /action. It's potentially endless if you don't mind repeating by trying different character builds (light side or dark side, light saver or the force user etc). Now THIS IS THE BEST RPG on iPhone. Imo of course."
iosgaming,3ch7tb,09stibmep,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:43:12 2015 UTC,"I finished KOTOR 2 on the pc back then and it was awesome. Had never played KOTOR until the iPad port, bought it and it is really worth it. I can't play it as much as I'd like because it is not a quick game though."
iosgaming,3ch7tb,nucky_johnson,3,Wed Jul 8 18:22:46 2015 UTC,"Drive Ahead - an arcadey game where you try to hit your opponent's head. Super freemium game but it is fairly easy to get new cars and maps just by playing the game. I would love to see online multiplayer added.   Terraria - a world building game similar to Minecraft, but 2D. Way more in depth and IMO better than Minecraft.   You Must Build A Boat - a match three with a twist. Very similar to their other game, 1,000,00, but still worth the purchase."
iosgaming,3ch7tb,Killerpenguin25,3,Tue Jul 7 22:03:35 2015 UTC,Nice! I used to play Terraria a TON! But I've taken a break from it. I might download it onto my phone. It's been awhile.   Drive Ahead looks pretty cool too! Might have to give that a shot.
iosgaming,3ch7tb,Killerpenguin25,5,Tue Jul 7 22:06:31 2015 UTC,They updated Terraria with Hard Mode in December and I just got around to playing it again.

iosgaming,3ch7tb,Shadax,2,Tue Jul 7 22:17:57 2015 UTC,"I downloaded Hungry Shark for a nephew and have ended up playing it obsessively (on that same vein, I've played way more Toca games than is entirely normal for someone my age).   I also like Hill Climb Racing and Whale Trail when I want to do something that uses very little thought."
iosgaming,3ch7tb,thesignpainter,2,Wed Jul 8 01:15:47 2015 UTC,"I'm surprised no one has mentioned The Executive. ($2.99)   Such a great game.  I haven't put much time in any mobile games in the last couple months, and this one has me hooked again.  Summary of the game:  It's an arcade beat em up, but not traditional in gameplay.  The combat is really polished and satisfying.  The whole game is ""on rails"" in the sense you don't control movement, so he automatically runs forward and then engages in combat when running into an enemy.  You tap and hold on the executive to block high or low then you tap the monster to hit high or low depending on which is exposed/not being blocked.  You learn and upgrade 5 different moves that are strong or weak against an enemy, depending on the enemy.  The enemies are really varied in behavior and techniques to take them down which makes it a lot of fun and keeps it interesting.  In between combat there's a running sequence where you swipe the direction that the arrow is pointing as soon as you touch it.  e.g. An up arrow will be approaching and if you time it right he'll go that direction.  It's not optional, so it ranges from missed (lowers special points needed to execute special moves, or it takes health if you have none) -> ok -> good -> perfect.  You get a rating at the end of each level up to an A+.  The great thing is that the levels are literally less than a minute long so you don't feel like you wasted too much time if you don't get that A+, and the rewards keep stacking anyway.  The interesting mechanic is the mining feature.  In between levels you invest money into certain things that reap big rewards depending on your play style.  Money is earned normally by playing missions, but the best part is that you can sell any stat or investment for a 100% return, and also that the invested money accrues even while you're not playing.  It's really just a glorified, dynamic stat system that works awesomely.  Lastly, the overall challenge is consistent in it's difficulty curve at a rate to where I have a really hard time putting it down.  There's no waiting for anything, it throws you into the game and you're playing instantly level by level at a rate similar to Angry Birds, Cut The Rope, etc.  It's a blast.  I definitely recommend it."

iosgaming,3ch7tb,Shadax,3,Wed Jul 8 00:57:54 2015 UTC,"The Quest Gold- this game seriously needs more praise. Hands down the best and most deep RPG on the App Store, and I doubt I will ever finish it. Apart from all the enemies to fight and sidequests to do, sometimes just exploring the world of The Quest is entertaining enough: the things the NPCs say, the things you can hear outside doors, the stuff written on tombstones- they all make this game Golden."
iosgaming,3ch7tb,OtherSilhouette,2,Wed Jul 8 06:59:06 2015 UTC,The $7.99 price point is probably the turn off.  It looks really cool though.  I would probably get it if it were closer to $3.99.
iosgaming,3ch7tb,Nerdtendo,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:50:15 2015 UTC,"Totally worth the price, friend. But I can understand if its a little price-y. There’s a version with less content as well around that price range I believe, and you can even buy the individual instalments for like $2 each. Overall Gold is where its at if you want all the juicy bonus content. :)"
iosgaming,3ch7tb,Zombie_DooDoo,2,Thu Jul 9 01:33:15 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna toss in my vote for the same.  The Quest is spectacular.  As /u/Shadax said, 8 bucks is kinda steep for an IOS game, but it's well worth the plunge.  If you're on the fence, the vanilla game is only 5."
iosgaming,3ch7tb,thatmffm,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:38:54 2015 UTC,DomiNations  Its like a combination of Clash of Clans and Age of Empires. Everytime you upgrade your town center you advance through an age and once you get to the Iron Age you're able to pick a nationality that comes with unique units and perks. Combat is mostly the same but DomiNations has a rally point you can use to direct your units where to attack. Also you get to keep your surviving troops!

iosgaming,3cerla,pizzalovin,6,Tue Jul 7 15:30:11 2015 UTC,"Wow. We're pretty much half way through 2015. And it's been a pretty spiffing year for mobile games so far.  We've had highs, we've had lows, we've had quite a lot of middles, but we've powered through together, sharing and caring along the way.  But what can we expect for the second half of the year? What dreams may come?  Here are 21 games we've got our eyes on for the rest of 2015. Feel free to add your own in the comments.  I am Bread  It's a game about being a slice of bread. I don't know why you're not already super excited.  Raging Justice  Homage to the 2D side-scroller of yesteryear. Lots of punching, kicking, and bad hair.  Crashlands  Butterscotch Shenanigans take you on a wander through the wasteland in this wacky 2D crafting game.  Calvino   Strategic film noir puzzle solving. Rob buildings, look moody in a trench coat, that sort of thing.  Spider: Rite of the Shrouded Moon  Sequel to the arachnid puzzler. More mansion, more webs, more mystery.  The Room 3  Room Hard With A Vengeance. Expect more eerie shocks, more tactile puzzles, and more oddities. This one's got a creepy bald bloke.   Drifter  In space, no one can hear you drift. Kickstarted indie space exploration game. Be the captain. Say ""engage.""  Warhammer 40K: Eisenhorn Xenos  Another Warhammer game!?! But this one's a third person action adventure. Slaughter Xenos scum. Giggle. Wear a cool hat, maybe. Cool coat, definitely.  Chroma Squad  Power Rangers homage from the dev behind Knights of Pen and Paper. Tactical TV show action.  The Elder Scrolls: Legend  Card game based on the smash hit RPG franchise. Think Hearthstone, but more Elder-y.  Final Fantasy VII  Do I really have to say anything here?  Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons  Twin-stick, twin control puzzler. The brothers aren't twins though, and they've got different abilities you'll need to exploit to be victorious.  Lara Croft GO  Not a command, but a gorgeous looking distillation of tomb raiding mechanics. If it's as good as Hitman GO we're in for a treat.  Dungelot Shattered Lands  Minesweeper meets a roguelike. Gorgeous cartoon graphics, and this time it's premium. Sweet.  Unkilled  A game that is definitely not Dead Trigger 3. Shoot zombies, shoot more zombies, never stop shooting zombies.  Zodiac  Intriguing looking take on the JRPG. You get to fly some sort of monster, which makes it instantly awesome.  Assassin's Creed Identity  It might not come out worldwide this year, but it's an ace mix of touchscreen controls and people-murdering. With hoods up.  Pokemon Shuffle  Shuffle your Pokemon. I don't know what that means, but I'm pretty sure it's a pretty big deal. Match-three-kachu.  Dawn of Titans  Gorgeous looking RTS. It's a bit free to play, but you get to control enormous titans, which is a lot of fun.  Lumino City  The sequel to Lume. Utterly engrossing, gorgeous adventure. Watch the video and fall in love.  Star Wars: Uprising  An action RPG set after the events of Return of the Jedi. Looks to bridge the gap between the original trilogy and the upcoming The Force Awakens."

Adventure To Fate : A Quest To The Core JRPG is the paid version  Adventure To Fate : Battle Arena JRPG is the free version. It does have iap but everything can be easily earned in game and most ads are optional if you want a stat boost or something.

iosgaming,3cfdy6,Nerdtendo,3,Tue Jul 7 14:10:06 2015 UTC,"To me The Quest is the Daggerfall of iOS. The age of the game, dated look, and older RPG style might be a couple of reasons you may not hear too much about the game. The game is huge with a TON of content/expansions that rivals PC RPG's of any age. Not for everybody but if you have a soft spot for early Elder Scrolls or The Bard's Tale (although The Quest is a solo adventurer game) then this is a fantastic RPG to pick up.  Shaun Musgrave did a fantastic write up on The Quest here:  http://toucharcade.com/2014/09/04/rpg-reload-file-004-the-quest-gold/"

iosgaming,3cfdy6,Tomato_Farmer73,2,Wed Jul 8 05:56:44 2015 UTC,"Yep.  Done a few quests, and loving it.  The movement is grid based, so that might be part of it.  You always move forward one square, and turn 90 degrees.  Sprites have a old DOOM feel to the animations as well, that is also probably part of it.  It really does feel quite a bit like Daggerfall.  If you decide to get it, I'd suggest doing what I did and find a beginners guide just so you can get your character set.  The game isn't balls to the wall, but it ain't a walk in the park either.  Also, be sure to turn on fast animations in the settings, it'll speed gameplay up a bit.  Other than that, the reviews are pretty spot on, it's a solid game.  My only gripes so far are minor ones.  All enemies are only hostile to you, and not each other...  And the draw distance is only about 4 tiles out.  Both easily ignored.  Ah, and be careful when you go to turn left in a village, so you don't accidentally stab a child like I did."
iosgaming,3cfdy6,Tomato_Farmer73,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:39:37 2015 UTC,"Cool, thanks :) I'll probably get it on payday, pretty excited. Hopefully no children stabbings happen in my game!"

iosgaming,3cb9ow,_YEEZY_,4,Mon Jul 6 16:04:17 2015 UTC,No problem. Does anyone know if you can play gba games through it? I'm still looking for a way to play gba games without using BuildStore (BuildiOS) or jail breaking.
iosgaming,3cb9ow,_YEEZY_,2,Mon Jul 6 16:09:56 2015 UTC,I dont think thats possible with nds4ios :(. my gba4ios stopped working so im looking for the same solution as you.
iosgaming,3cb9ow,CymruBach,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:14:31 2015 UTC,I'm about to give in to the BuildStore :/  And I certainly would give in to it if I new the games I want to play were available as ROMs. However I can't find Sword of Mana / Secret of Mana.
iosgaming,3cb9ow,CymruBach,2,Mon Jul 6 16:16:19 2015 UTC,What's the score with Buildstore?
iosgaming,3cb9ow,CymruBach,2,Mon Jul 6 19:52:53 2015 UTC,"I'm confused by what you mean by ""score"". But at the moment there are far more games is rather be playing on GBA than NDS4iOS. Also I also enjoy that GBA4iOS has a built in ""gameshark"" so I can put in cheats... And for $10 I can get that and I guess a couple more things, idk what the Cydia app is (something for jailbreak or not jailbreak). Also since I just spent $10 on Sword of Mana and my actual GBA has broken then this seems like a cheaper alternative."
iosgaming,3cb9ow,araponga,2,Mon Jul 6 19:56:20 2015 UTC,"That's what I meant by score, so thanks...  I love GBA4iOS but updated and it stopped working, I was just dubious of signing up for Buildstore - Let me know if you sign up and it's any good.  If I remember rightly I stopped the register process as it asked me for info I didn't trust them with."
iosgaming,3cb9ow,95Mb,2,Mon Jul 6 19:59:58 2015 UTC,I'll certainly let you know if I decide to go for it. And from what I hear it can be trusted. I'm going to look into the other apps that are offered with it (@ work right now) and I'll try and remember to get back to you. If I don't in a day or so just message / comment again and I should see the notification.
iosgaming,3cb9ow,Aquagoat,2,Mon Jul 6 20:11:25 2015 UTC,I just signed up and paid for it.  It wanted me to install a profile - which was what I was dubious about last time. Went to delete said profile after the install and it's disappeared...  Installed GBA4iOS with no problems and it runs fine!!

iosgaming,3cde4s,dudewelcome,2,Tue Jul 7 17:54:27 2015 UTC,"As far as entertaining, challenging, rewarding and well-crafted iOS experiences go, I always recommend MHFU. I've been playing it since the PSP port came out back in around '09 and once you get past the initial, slow-paced and a little tedious learning curve, it becomes an intense and exhilarating experience with hundreds of hours' worth of content. Seriously, it'll eat up that flight easily. Plus, it's got some of the most well-designed fighting mechanics I've ever seen in any game, as well as plenty of huge bosses to chop or bash up. Another good long-flight game is Radiation Island. It's an open-world survival game that's a little bit like Far Cry in first-person and a little bit like Fallout in third-person. It's loaded with things to do, kill, craft and explore. And it's gorgeous, too. It's another one that I've easily spent hours playing."

iosgaming,3c5cfq,PresidentZer0,5,Sun Jul 5 19:59:42 2015 UTC,"That looks fun. I like the space marshals mechanic where tapping the middle of the screen goggles Crouch. If it is stealthy, then how do you move silently? What about quiet weapons and achievements for not being spotted / raising alarms?  There was a fps about 10 yrs ago called Project IGI (I'm going in) that was based on a flight sim engine. it really helped you understand scale. When you raised enemy alerts, you had to hide or kill off the threat.  Anyway...Good luck."

iosgaming,3c5cfq,zeroalexzero,2,Sun Jul 5 15:38:32 2015 UTC,Not sure if you played Mercenaries 2 but in that if you ever got reported/seen by the enemy then they would start to call their boss. There was about a 5 second window that you had where you could kill the enemy who was doing the reporting to prevent it from happening. If you failed however then the enemy would call in reinforcements

All those are sort of 'short' for an RPG though.  For cRPGs, I enjoyed Steven Universe: Attack the Light (never even watched the show...) and I heard nothing but good from Dragon Quest 4-6 (but never tried them myself because an don't really trust SQuenix with their games any more). Also, Avernum: Escape from the Pit was a massive time investment for me on PC and I really enjoyed it. If you're into the Pokemanz stuff, Siralim (remember Dragon Quest Monsters?) and EvoCreo are both really nice. For massive amounts of grinding in aRPGs, I can recommend Dungeon Quest and Battleheart: Legacy.  Not all of those games got all of what you are looking for, but they all should fit pretty well, I hope."

You know, the old-school stuff. sRPG is strategy RPGs - everything from Fire Emblem and Final Fantasy Tactics to Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Survivor and Disgea. That's the games where you move your characters in a chess-like grid and have turn-based fights."

It feels to me that /r/apphookup and /r/iosgaming are filled with people who prefer to pay upfront for games (at least this has been my experience).  I wish there was a breakdown in the statistics to see who the typical F2P customers are.  But it has also been my experience that I get requests for Candy Crush Saga from people I consider non-gamers.  They're just addicted to one game on their phone whereas I am a gamer that wants more companies like supergiant to have a larger budget for their next game since Bastion and Transistor are a testament to gaming.  And if someone doesn't want to pay $10 for a game, they should reconsider the cost of the device they're holding.  I will say that if someone's looking for a new pay upfront game his weekend, buy Super Hexagon or Spartan Strike as they're 50% right now.  I've been playing Super Hexagon for years here and there and it's still difficult.  I bought SS last week, but just started up the tutorial last night, but even just that was impressive (I like the grenade variety).  /2¢"

You don't level but you develop skills based on your choice of character build and in-story choices. If this sounds remotely interesting, I recommend Yeti's Parole Officer, I don't know if it still has a free trial system, but I think you can play it for quite awhile before the paywall.

iosgaming,3bzfzg,Crotalus13,6,Fri Jul 3 12:24:16 2015 UTC,"Most of them have already been covered but the ones I've enjoyed the most include:       Vainglory (3v3 MOBA)   World of Tanks: Blitz (5v5 tank arena, way more strategically deep than most people think)     Hearthstone (1v1 Collectible Card Game)   Respawnables (3rd Person shooter. Even though it's model leads towards a F2P P2W-ish stance, I find the gameplay engaging and the overall quality of the game high).   Battle for Wesnoth (Hexagonal Army-centric Turn Based Strategy. This game is a blast if you can go past the graphics and the initial difficulty. It supports asynchronous and synchronous multiplayer too, along with more features than you can dream about, not even kidding).   Asphalt 8: Airborne (Arcade Racer. Again, a F2P/P2Progress model applied to a great base game. The grind is real for this one but if yo enjoy non-100% simulation racers this is your best bet)   Hero Academy (Squad Turn-Based Square-tiled Strategy. This game is like chess meets Final Fantasy Tactics, With the replayability of the former and the rpg elements of the latter.   Frozen Synapse (Squad Turn-Based Strategy. I don't remember off the top of my head if this game only supports asynchronous multiplayer, but the game is so good that I had to include it in the list).   X-COM: Enemy Within (Pretty much the same description as the last one)   Starbase Orion (4x Turn Based Strategy. Again, I don't remember if it supports synchronous play but if you are into 4x games this is definitely your best bet).   Board Games (Board-Gaming Strategy. I'm not much into those but I have to admit they translate pretty well to touchscreens, most notable mentions go to Agricola, Carcassonne, Puerto Rico, 7 Wonders, etc).   Ascension (Deck Builder Card. All of the players get to build your deck of a same card pool. If you enjoy card games this one is a blast)   Bloons TD Battles (Tower Defense 1v1. Basically, you send troops to yore enemy while you build your towers to stop their troops)   I can't think of anymore right now, will edit the post adding other suggestions. Once again sorry if I included some Asynchronous-only games, I just thought about good iOS multiplayer experiences. Enjoy your online adventures!"

iosgaming,3bvn4w,incorrectone,2,Fri Jul 3 07:19:49 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I tried to use them in as many ways as possible.  Apple nix'd one of my favorite visual puns, which was the 👻 as the Crash Snap logo... the parody was a bit too on the nose of SnapChat for their liking.  There's a mix of both native (Apple Emoji Color font) and images. I wrote some custom tools for dealing with them in various ways."
iosgaming,3bvn4w,shorterthanaverage,2,Fri Jul 3 09:07:12 2015 UTC,"hahaha I was wondering why the ghost emoji was missing on the yellow ""camera"" button. That's unfortunate, but understandable that they saw it as a grey area.   That's really cool, I admire the close attention to detail you've brought to this game. I'm still amazed how well done the water and fire animations flow with emojis. I also love when there's crashes, various limbs, hats, and other items fall out of the cars."

iosgaming,3bzp9k,rex138,2,Fri Jul 3 13:32:02 2015 UTC,"I brought this up 2 years ago and everyone said that there would be no reason for Nintendo to port their games to IOS because they have their own systems and people would just stop buying those. ' In reality they would make more money I think because here is one customer (among hundreds of thousands of 25-40 year old's who grew up with Nintendo, have a tablet, and don't want to buy a 3DS,) who would throw cash at Zelda, Mario, Star Fox, ETC... in a heartbeat."

iosgaming,3bzp9k,Koenan,1 point,Sat Jul 4 01:08:08 2015 UTC,"Ok since Nintendo is apparently totally myopic now and any real product strategy eludes them, I am going to lay it out.   People have forgotten you exist (and your sales show it).  Give up on Mobile gaming making money.  Your original fanbase is aging and without getting to kids and their iPhones you will lose - but it won't be how you make serious profits.   The goal of mobile gaming is to get as many downloads and exposure while losing the least.  It is more or less a loss leader. Port your existing games that everyone would eat up and charge $3.99 for each.  Everyone knows what they are and will download the shit out of them.     At this point Nintendo, people remember who you are and that you are still capable of producing quality anything.  They will be more open to your new primary systems which is where you make the real money.     You will NOT turn mobile gaming into a cash cow and do not attempt to try.  Do not redirect resources you should be using to produce on your primary business (e.g. consoles) in a misguided attempt to make money.  Use mobile gaming to gain exposure to new people with quality ports and hope that, with good nintendo console games in the future, you won't go belly up fighting against xbox and sony."

In between each bumming session, see if there is a favorable trade. That could be beer bottles or money. Now when one of your resources runs out and it says you will die in X days, start bumming downtown. This offers the most benefit, and you don't lose resources because they're already depleted. Once you get close to death, refill your resources as much as possible saving your health for last as this is the easiest to bring down. Continue this cycle until you can buy shoes. Then death is no longer a concern as you can go for a run to refill both health and happiness. Stay resourceful (lol) and you should be able to see it through to the easier parts of the game.

Once you get the hang on the mechanics, it's one of those games that makes you feel good when you finish a level quickly.  But it does lack a tutorial. It takes awhile to figure out the currency system and what patterns are valid, as well as what exactly is going on with the snowflakes and trees."

I did consider the tutorial, and I might still go back and plug one in. The main reason I chose not to include it, is I wanted it to be a game that you discover instead of learn.

iosgaming,3bsnkx,WaveLightGames,3,Thu Jul 2 06:37:01 2015 UTC,"Interesting game - nice concept. Haven't looked on the phone yet, but going off the web app (which is a nice idea, letting people trial it before buying. also very smart, requiring people to submit their email addresses), I can click on the first letter and wave the pointer around, basically face-rolling the letters to the right answer.   Is that intentional? And is it the same on the app?"
iosgaming,3bsnkx,ForceVader,1 point,Thu Jul 2 10:41:37 2015 UTC,"Thanks for trying it out! And yup, the mechanics are similar on the app, although touch does have some fundamental differences from a mouse. On the surface face-rolling solutions might work; but if you happen to select a letter that doesn't lead to a solution, you'll be stuck until you deselect it. When the levels get more difficult, and they definitely do, you have to pre-meditate your selections to make the most efficient use of your time."

iosgaming,3bsb4s,Deeliciousness,-2,Thu Jul 2 04:16:43 2015 UTC,"Why Jailbreak?   I need (and have) a phone that works perfectly all the time, well almost. A phone that is fast, responsive, stable and has good battery life. With my daily use I can get 2 days or more out of my iPhone 6+. Only reason I'd consider jailbreaking for would be to get N64 and Zelda: OOT on my iPhone. I don't feel the need to customize my phone if it makes it perform worse.   Why should I jailbreak? I'm curious about it, Google'd it but so far I'm not convinced."
iosgaming,3bsb4s,xcitu,7,Fri Jul 3 00:06:14 2015 UTC,"Jailbreaking doesn't suddenly make your phone perform worse as you seem to claim. Your phone works exactly the same except you'll have access to root. So if all you want to do is run emulators, you can do that without taking performance or battery  hit."
iosgaming,3bsb4s,abrahamisaninja,-4,Fri Jul 3 01:11:01 2015 UTC,"So I decided to try it.   Install went fine, installed RetroArch. Crashed like a madman, reinstalled.

Luckily I managed to get iTunes to restore it to factory settings and I have a working phone now. Never again."
iosgaming,3bsb4s,xcitu,5,Fri Jul 3 16:39:32 2015 UTC,"If I remember correctly retroatch hasn't been updated in some time. Either way, jailbreak isn't for everyone. If you don't have the patience to figure it out then maybe you should just go stock. I just don't like people bad mouthing jailbreaking just on their own experience because there are plenty of people who use a jailbroken phone day to day with no problem. Btw if you're ever interested in trying it again I suggest heading to /r/jailbreak. Most of the time they're useful lol"
iosgaming,3bsb4s,abrahamisaninja,2,Fri Jul 3 18:31:20 2015 UTC,"Hi, I have jailbroken my iPad Air 2 on iOS 8.3 and it works flawlessly. I updated to iOS 8.4 but found that version had some major performance and battery issues with my iPad even on stock. I jailbroke it and quickly reverted back to iOS 8.3 before the signing period is over. I had no issues with iTunes. My battery life was bad at first like really bad (draining a percent every 2 minutes or so) but when battery got down to like 30% it finally stopped. I fully charged it up last night and played like an hour and half of games and the thing still had 97% left. I left it overnight idling for about 13 hours and it only lost 1% when usually it'd lose like 10%. The battery must've calibrated itself. I thought it was the jailbreak but nope. It fixed itself and battery is amazing. I'm quite happy with iOS 8.3 and will most likely ride it out until there is a jailbreak for iOS 9. I had no issues installing RetroArch and loading up Ocarina Of Time Master Quest. It's working flawlessly. I'm sorry you had such a bad first impression with jailbreaking.   I'm sorry for such a long post."

Having Zelda OOT emulator on my phone would just be icing on the cake for me. :)  I might have been in a bad mood when I wrote the post (due to almost bricking my phone), which probably made it a rage post of some kind. I think jailbreak is great for those who want and have the time to use it to set their phone up as they please."
iosgaming,3bsb4s,xcitu,1 point,Sun Jul 5 12:43:46 2015 UTC,"Haha thank you :)    Wel, my phone happens to be a Nexus 5. I'm probably one of the rare people who love both Android and iOS. But I use my iPad for the games cause of bigger screen and also the exclusive games that are only on iOS.     My first time playing Master Quest is with touchscreen controls lol. It just adds to the challenge IMO. I have heard that iOS devices are quite hard to brick. I have almost bricked my Nexus device trying to root the thing and installing a bad ROM but thankfully Nexus devices are meant for this thing are are EXTREMELY hard to brick. The boatloader saved me. My very first time ever rooting a Android device I bricked my LG Optimus 3 times in a row (I had to get 3 replacements, my carrier thought I was crazy). I found out later it was cause I was a noob and was flashing ROMs for other devices haha. I've seen people flash ROMs on a Nexus device for other devices and it doesn't even brick. Just does a bootloop. So they are pretty difficult.     In the end I love both jailbreaking and rooting. I see the clear differences between both iOS and Android since I use both. I love on Android how I can access the file system and upload any file I want to site. There are other reasons as well but I'd be here for days typing it out and would be way too long to read lol. Android happens to have quite a few games and apps that are exclusive to Android which I love. You can do way more with a stock Android device than a stock iOS device. Even when you're jailbroken I can still do most of those things on stock but with rooting your Android device. The options are endless haha. But this just depends on your own opinion.    I don't like to argue with people on what's better. At the end of the day you're the one using it and not me so why should I care? I just happen to love both mobile operating systems. I get called a Apple fanboy which is hilarious since my phone is a Android device and my computer is Windows and I use a Chromecast instead of a Apple TV."

iosgaming,3bocjf,ark_keeper,10,Thu Jul 2 03:28:11 2015 UTC,"Weird, I thought the port was quite excellent.  I rarely had issues with the controls.  I hope more ports of indie PC titles are released.  I've loved FTL and Papers Please."
iosgaming,3bocjf,volcanopele,2,Wed Jul 1 03:31:01 2015 UTC,Yep 2 great games. If they ported more games like that I would definitely continue to buy them.

iosgaming,3bocjf,Nookiezilla,2,Tue Jun 30 23:04:49 2015 UTC,"IMO ""mobile"" gaming has changed so much anything goes these days. The pool of players now is so huge it includes everything from hardcore console gamers to super casual, 30s at a time gamers. Some people sit down and play games for hours on their phone or iPad, and imo there is nothing wrong with that - there should be games for players like them, and this is a good example of one."
iosgaming,3bocjf,FoursakenMedia,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:25:26 2015 UTC,"I agree. Developers should stop making FPS and any game which plays on controller better than on touch screen. All this ports is a money grab, it is easier to port a game than to make new one.  I also don't understand why they making Universal apps when it is so much better on iPad. It is worse experience, but some developers doesn't care about experience they need money.  Look what Nintendo doing with their IP. They do not allow it on any hardware except their own. Look like StarFox Zero utilise Wii U controller. This people are true artists.  I wish iOS let developers to restrict some games to be playable only with gamepads."
iosgaming,3bocjf,borisyurkevich,1 point,Wed Jul 1 09:22:37 2015 UTC,"You must've been popular at school, calling for all these restrictions.  I'm always encouraging devs to bring their games to iPhone if they haven't already and here you are undoing it. Many games work just as well on the phone. And there is such a thing as a 6+ these days. If someone wants to fire up a touch intensive game on their iPhone 4 then that's their own doing. Devs can also advise users not to play on such devices in the description.  There's plenty of games that haven't done as well as they should have because the devs restricted that game to iPad only when it could have worked perfectly on a phone. With a jailbreak one can even run some iPad only games on their phone. I've seen plenty work seamlessly like this, but no, the dev has chosen to restrict their market just out of disbelief of what can be done on a smaller screen. The 6+ screen is barely a step down from a mini.  I'm delighted transistor is on iPhone and think it works absolutely perfectly. Im playing through KOTOR at the moment on my phone. Yes another game from PC screen heritage and it is perfect on my phone."

iosgaming,3bpvro,Keth119,3,Wed Jul 1 09:22:59 2015 UTC,"FTL and Xcom come to mind. Both are great games. The Baulder's Gate series is really good too, albeit a bit more hard core as far as rule sets go.   If you like RPGs Star Wars the Old Republic is very good. And I think The Bard's Tale is still on sale. The Knights of Pen and Paper games are a great nostalgia trip too.   Tower defense games are good too, Plants vs Zombies and the Kingdom Rush games are worth picking up.   If you are into board games, pick up Ticket to Ride, it's one of the best. It's also great single player.    Hope that helps.   Edit: also may want to pick up a battery pack to keep yourself charged if you don't have one. Your plane might not have the ability to charge your gear and Ireland is a long flight. Have a Guinness for me, I had one when I was there, it was the second best beer I have ever had."

iosgaming,3bki3a,syd430,10,Tue Jun 30 02:53:12 2015 UTC,"You might be in to roguelikes, which is pretty much all I play these days. Procedural generation and permadeath ensures replayability and they are often easy to play but difficult to master. My top pick would be Pixel Dungeon, which has an active community and is very well balanced. Other good titles include 868-Hack, Hoplite, Pixel Heroes, Cardinal Quest 2, Sprogiwood and Out there. If you don't mind having to constantly refer to a wiki/guide, iNetHack2, a good iOS port of NetHack will offer a very deep experience.   Edit: just to clarify, Pixel Dungeon is the one published by Oleg Dolya. Not the other crap that comes up when searching the App Store."
iosgaming,3bki3a,syd430,3,Tue Jun 30 02:24:49 2015 UTC,"I love roguelikes, but prefer action roguelikes a little bit more.  I've had a lot of fun with Angband and Brogue on PC and I got into 1000 Rogues on iOS for a little while.  I heard 868-Hack and Hoplite were pretty amazing.  I actually HAVE Hoplite now that I think about it but I gave it one play and didn't really try hard enough to grok the basic strategy.  But here's the thing... can you tell me which, if any, of those games let me play my podcasts in the background?  That's a super important requirement."

That's a super important requirement.   Just checked and all of them do except Pixel Dungeon. if you want an action rougelike, Tallowmere is a good one, but not sure if it allows podcasts as i'd have to redownload it. Also, Pixel Dungeon was heavily inspired by Brogue and the two are quite similar having played plenty of both. But again, it doesn't allow podcasts.  I might tweet the dev about that actually, as that would be nice for the next update."

For an even deeper experience, check out the Secret Password Challenge on the HangZone website. It's a riddle and logic puzzle challenge that is incorporated with the game."

iosgaming,3bg3nw,Makegooduseof,2,Mon Jun 29 05:49:15 2015 UTC,"Right now, XCom - Enemy Unknown (turn based strategy) is on sale at $4.99. It's originally a PC game that has been ported and optimized for the mobile platform.   Plague, Inc. (real time simulation) is 99 cents, and the objective of the game is to infect and kill everyone as a disease.   Another thing you can do if you want to save money on the App Store is to sign up at either TouchArcade or AppShopper and mark all the games you want to get if the price drops."
iosgaming,3bg3nw,Makegooduseof,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:49:09 2015 UTC,Cool. I look into those two money-saving things you mentioned. What's the original price on XCOM mobile? Also is it worth getting if I already have it on PC?
iosgaming,3bg3nw,Makegooduseof,1 point,Thu Jul 2 05:37:02 2015 UTC,"It was first sold at $13, and it saw a price drop to $10 a while ago. This is another price drop on top of it.   Whether it's worth it or not is subjective. I've never played Xcom on the PC or PS3 before. However, based on my experience with Final Fantasy Tactics, which was originally a PS1 game, I felt the iOS version was worth it because I felt the touch interface works much better on games like those two that involve tapping between different movement squares and actions; you don't use a D-pad to navigate among menus and drag out a cursor from one movement point to the next. Again, this is subjective.   Another turn based strategy game that fas within your budget would be Partia and Partia 2, though the latter is priced at $6. This is basically Fire Emblem, but somewhat watered down story-wise."
iosgaming,3bg3nw,LoserOtakuNerd,1 point,Thu Jul 2 05:46:09 2015 UTC,Wow more value for money. Also can you play and progress in XCOM mobile offline?
iosgaming,3bg3nw,LoserOtakuNerd,1 point,Thu Jul 2 06:11:56 2015 UTC,"The game is completely playable offline.   I cannot remember because I have erased it off my iPad, but there may be a cloud saving feature that requires an Internet connection. But other than that, you will have no issues playing with no internet."
iosgaming,3bfdgq,JorSum,2,Sun Jun 28 18:58:14 2015 UTC,"I play it, as long as you are active enough paying can be avoided. I'm holding top 20 in arena on the original and the second server. Only spend 5 on each to get the Goku (yardrat). The people who pay loads of money never seem all that active ironically enough"
iosgaming,3bfdgq,IAm1RadLad,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:42:42 2015 UTC,Can you explain about the arenas + any tips for noobs?
iosgaming,3bfdgq,IAm1RadLad,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:07:15 2015 UTC,"It is all about the gear, skills, and cards. Join a server that is as young as possible. So you can keep pace with everyone. The arena really is all about keeping up with how often you participate. Once you get top 100 you get daily gammets to help with draws. So a young server will allow you to climb fast and build while you hold people off. And I honestly recommend dropping 5 into it for the Goku yardrat, helps a ton early on."
iosgaming,3bfdgq,IAm1RadLad,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:08:28 2015 UTC,"OK, but like a noob I didn't even realise about the arena until I was 2 days in. Should I quit to another server or can I still salvage my position?"
iosgaming,3bfdgq,thesarcasmic,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:25:45 2015 UTC,"You can salvage, but honestly a new server is going to make you life a ton easier. Gives you a chance to get up early and bring gammets in daily. And try best to place in Hell arena. Top 20 in arena gives you 140+ a day and top 20 in Hell is 100 a day. So a new server you aren't competing with everyone that is 20 levels above you. Even the big spenders who don't keep up in level don't keep up, a lot of the arena comes down to level of gear and skills."
iosgaming,3bfdgq,IAm1RadLad,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:05:19 2015 UTC,"Cool man, I've got to top 100 now with your advice after being rank 6000 when I posted.  Any tips for hell?  Also you mentioned cards were important but it looks like I can't use them until lvl 50? That's a long way away...  And how are these lvl 15s pulling ss2 cards, bardock etc? They must have been real lucky with Call... But also with gear, some of them seem crazy maxed out with A level gear for all their team while I'm here with 5 turtle shells."

iosgaming,3beklb,nebua,2,Sun Jun 28 14:37:12 2015 UTC,"I second everyone else here. If you have the option of playing it elsewhere, do it. If it won't run on your computer, go ahead and try the iPad port but only if you have an mfi controller. They could have made it control exactly like the console version, but chose to do it in this wonky way that made me keep the screen close so I could use some of the touch controls for things like switching weapons. Framerate on my 4th generation ipad got pretty low when the device got hot, which it would in about 30 min to an hour depending on brightness level, and the environment."
iosgaming,3beklb,RaidenDark,4,Mon Jun 29 00:11:28 2015 UTC,"I'd really recommend playing the game elsewhere (or in your case, your Mac). There's definitely a noticeable decrease in the graphics department no matter what iOS product you own, and the port's also locked at 30 FPS. The controls are really wonky too, so unless you have a MFI controller and don't care how the game looks, I'd go with the Mac version."
iosgaming,3beklb,BananaProne,2,Sun Jun 28 16:43:23 2015 UTC,"I'm legitimately curious as to why this comment is getting downvoted. After beating the Steam version a while back and recently playing around 8 hours of the port on my iPad Air and iPhone 6+ most of what he/she said is pretty accurate.   It's an okay port, but is definitely worth checking out on other consoles  EDIT: The comment was -5 when I first saw it. Oh well."
iosgaming,3beklb,Rlolt,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:09:18 2015 UTC,"Get an MFi controller if you decide to go for the iOS version. It's playable over a touch screen (surprisingly so for a port of an FPS), but much more comfortable with a controller."
iosgaming,3beklb,renome,0,Tue Jun 30 01:05:46 2015 UTC,I personally got use to the controls quickly and didn't have any issues using the touch screen controls.

iosgaming,3bdlrl,kjoey,3,Sun Jun 28 05:30:17 2015 UTC,"I recommend Knights of Pen and Paper. Both are good, probably makes sense to start with the first though.   EDIT: Oh. Are you talking about Yu-Gi-Oh?"
iosgaming,3bdlrl,gartacus,2,Sun Jun 28 06:42:04 2015 UTC,"Haha, yep, should've clarified. I walked into Barnes and Noble one day and saw Dungeon Dice and got way too excited before realizing it was something totally different.  But Knights of Pen and Paper looks cool too!"
iosgaming,3bdlrl,09stibmep,2,Sun Jun 28 11:44:40 2015 UTC,"Afraid there's really nothing like it at all really. Something that pops into my head is an old game called Hero Mages. But even that isn't close. Wish there was one, or wish konami would just straight up port this stuff. I would never condone it but GBA4ios is a thing."
iosgaming,3bdlrl,phort99,1 point,Mon Jun 29 03:44:16 2015 UTC,I haven't played a lot of tactics games on iOS but Xcom Enemy Unknown is on iOS and it's a great game and a great touch adaptation.   There's also Final Fantasy Tactics (I haven't played the iOS version but it's considered one of the high watermarks in tactics gameplay)

Just have a whole region (like the left side of the screen) where anywhere you put your finger down becomes the middle of an invisible stick, which you can then move up, down, left, or right. When you let go and then bring your finger down again, your new position is again the middle. I've seen that done in many games and it works very well."
iosgaming,3b9rfc,virulentArachnid,1 point,Sat Jun 27 15:26:11 2015 UTC,Disagree. I've seen that a ton and I've yet to see it not be awful.  At this point I won't even download free games with virtual sticks of dpads.
iosgaming,3b9rfc,True_Truth,1 point,Sat Jun 27 16:03:53 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm just not sure what else I would do besides that, most games use a virtual joystick for movement and into seems like the best way to control a game like this unless you have a controller"
iosgaming,3b9rfc,n0gc1ty,2,Sat Jun 27 16:25:31 2015 UTC,"Most fps games use virtual stick, not most games.  Fps games are just universally bad on phones"
iosgaming,3b9rfc,dzamir,2,Sat Jun 27 16:39:46 2015 UTC,"My favourite FPS controls are Dead Trigger 2, it's still virtual sticks but there's no trigger, it just automatically shoots when your crosshairs are over something, I love not having to switch between aiming and trigger. If anyone knows of other games with that method please let me know!"
iosgaming,3b9rfc,nytel,2,Sun Jun 28 07:25:52 2015 UTC,This is awesome! I would absolutely (pay for and) play this.

The graphics and environment are stylish, the music is subtle and you can even hear the water as you get closer to it. Great attention to detail.

iosgaming,3b2nty,Essa_Alioste,2,Thu Jun 25 14:23:27 2015 UTC,"Those three have a very loose connection to each other. It's primarily thematic, sharing elements but never referencing each other. It's essentially: There's a castle in the sky, there's the Zenithian armour, and that's about all of the common elements.  So, in essence, yes. Go ahead and play them in any order you want!  Only Dragon Quest I, II, and III reference each other (those are considered the Erdrick Trilogy). Dragon Quest VII and beyond are even less connected having no common thematic or world-building elements."
iosgaming,3b2nty,GreatScott84,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:34:21 2015 UTC,"With that said, is it worth playing through the first three games? I tried a while back to play through DQ1 but it felt so dated and unnecessarily grindy that I skipped the other two and went on to DQ4."
iosgaming,3b2nty,Deeliciousness,3,Thu Jun 25 16:13:15 2015 UTC,"I liked the first three games, but then again, I played them when that's all you could get since DQ V and VI were locked in Japan and I didn't have an NES to play IV with. (That means I played I, II, and III for Gameboy).  That said, considering our current options, I'd say you're better starting with VIII, VI, or IV, maybe V (but that one is much harder than the other ones I mentioned).   III is definitely the best one out of the original trilogy but compared to the newer games it might look dated. II was fun but it has a crazy grind nearing the end. I is Grinding: The Game but I like it for its simplicity. It's a no thinking required kind of game. You can beat it in a single day if you're so inclined (and know what you're doing).  My opinion is, yes, they're worth playing! Of course they are! But they might not be the best to start with considering the modern audience. But if you feel like you liked the newer games, definitely give at least III a try."
iosgaming,3b2nty,Deeliciousness,2,Thu Jun 25 16:32:03 2015 UTC,"For a first time DQ player, which one would you recommend VIII, Vi, or IV?"
iosgaming,3b2nty,Lacasax,3,Thu Jun 25 19:56:51 2015 UTC,"VIII. It's the most modern, prettiest, and has that system where you see your characters jump at the enemies which is apparently what can make-or-break a deal for a lot of people (I don't understand it). It eschews the class system in favor of a skill tree system that a lot of people might be more comfortable with. It's also the most graphically pleasing and you can really see Akira Toriyama's artwork come to life in way that none of the previous games showed.  That's not to say that the previous games are inferior to VIII. I just feel that VIII is easier to get into than its predecessors."

iosgaming,3ay6mf,rex138,4,Wed Jun 24 13:22:02 2015 UTC,I am waiting very eagerly for this game to be released. I hope it lives up to the hype I feel watching the previews for it!

iosgaming,3ay6mf,Cutandbroken,11,Wed Jun 24 20:53:58 2015 UTC,Blah blah MMO... Blah blah features... heard it a million times.  Are there energy timers in this or not?  Is this another money grab or  does it actually have a chance to be good?  Sick of these articles on unreleased games that don't include the most relevant details.  It makes me not trust them.  The developers of these games certainly know what monetization plan they will use but they dont disclose it. They want to build up hype before detailing a shitty F2P model and toucarcade doesnt push on those details or care they are ommitted because they need and want money (more articles with any content = better than less articles with good content).     Edit: I am not saying this game is bad or anything negative about it. These devs might be awesome guys and this game A+. There is nothing to indicate otherwise. My gripe is with toucharcade.
iosgaming,3ay6mf,Koenan,8,Wed Jun 24 16:24:06 2015 UTC,"No energy timers or any other crap. It's a ""full PC mmorpg"" It has a chance to be very good, yes. I am since 6 months into the alpha."

iosgaming,3ay6mf,timelyparadox,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:42:20 2015 UTC,"You need to do your research before bashing I think. There is even a whole stickied topic about it on the forum where there are discussions on how to avoid P2W.  I don't say that to be an asshole, just saying not all games are the same so pretending that there can be no fair games under certain business models is just not right."
iosgaming,3ay6mf,DynamicStatic,1 point,Thu Jun 25 09:27:02 2015 UTC,"I never said that F2P was a problem.  Energy timers and stamina meters are commonplace in RPGs and related types.  They are game breaking and monetization plans are more relevant in these games than almost all other details.  If they preview a game in a genre plagued by timers and ridiculous greed, they should be including details on the model before anything else in my opinion.  It is building up hype while avoiding critical details.  Going to the forums and doing my own research on every game they shill for is not the answer.   If i interview a presidential candidate and only ask him about what his pie in the sky goals are without follow up on how they will be accomplished that would be shit journalism.  It is the same thing here."
iosgaming,3ay6mf,Koenan,1 point,Thu Jun 25 23:13:44 2015 UTC,Well I think they are more public than most with how they are to solve things and why things are done as they are done + discussions about monetization. How many devs discuss their monetization strategy with their users in order to reach fair levels?
iosgaming,3ay6mf,DynamicStatic,-4,Fri Jun 26 13:37:47 2015 UTC,Chill...
iosgaming,3ay6mf,BasedGodTbh,5,Wed Jun 24 16:37:46 2015 UTC,It is just getting old and especially now that toucharcade is soliciting for donations it has to be said.  I mean after getting excited about many games based on these articles and then continuously let down is frustrating.

iosgaming,3azqqh,GOATSQUIRTS,3,Wed Jun 24 20:28:08 2015 UTC,I think if the devs used the volume up button for shooting. Volume down for grande throw? It would be so cool.. Then just change the volume in the game menu.

iosgaming,3ayb53,zworp,2,Wed Jun 24 14:02:30 2015 UTC,"So, I played your game. Here's what I think of it.  Graphics: the graphics are very sharp. Everything looks great. I enjoyed the color changes, I felt they kept the eye stress down, which is definitely a problem with games like this. The few particle effects used were very pleasant.   Sound: Honestly, the music is pretty bad. It sounds like 8-bit dubstep. I personally would have chosen a much lighter song. Something like what was used in DDR or Lumines. I ended up just playing the game on mute. Sound effect were fine. They were quiet to the point of being drowned out by the music.  Gameplay: Frustrating as hell but very fun. I've given the game a few hours and honestly I almost couldn't put it down. My current high score is 615 and Game Center says I am actually #1 of all time. Huh.  The gameplay is smooth, and the difficulty increase is at a nice even pace. Which blends to offer a way for someone to develop ""skills"" and get better. I do have a few complaints though. I feel each ""session"" is way too short. I wish the speed increase would either stop sooner or take longer, and that there was more variety. Possibly through more different power ups or something. The way the game is currently is definitely in the ""Quick-Fix"" category. Where I am at with my high score and what it took for me to get there I don't think I'm going to get much higher than that. That is what would cause me to stop playing.  Overall: 5 Stars. Its a great game for killing a few minutes but not much more than that. I would love to see more content."
iosgaming,3ayb53,codyg553,2,Mon Jun 29 07:58:45 2015 UTC,"Thank you. :)  Sound: I know I generally have a very poor feeling for sound and music, I liked this track but I'm not supriced that it might not be the best fit for the game.  I just release the Android version in which I increased the length of the wall segments slightly as the speed increases, I will probably update the iOS version with the same change soon, will make the difficulty increase a bit slower."
iosgaming,3ayb53,codyg553,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:45:33 2015 UTC,"You're welcome.   I just figured a game like this would benefit more with a brighter song with a heavy beat.  Something similar to the songs in This but no lyrics. Eh, just my personal opinion.   That update sounds great. I think that would allow people to get much higher scores."
iosgaming,3au1h7,gabapenteado,3,Tue Jun 23 14:39:17 2015 UTC,I've been playing this game for a long time. Loved it buuut... Recently it BOMBARDS you with offers to buy diamonds. I realise that IAPs are probably your bread and butter but they outweigh massively what you can buy with in game currency.   The replay value isn't great once you've completed the main missions. The missions where you blow up the barrels just get repetitive and feel like a grind.   Other than that I love the game and can't wait for the next city but I don't think I'll be dipping back in as frequently as I used to until the update
iosgaming,3au1h7,Duncandisorderly271,4,Tue Jun 23 15:11:54 2015 UTC,"Great! That's the kind of feedback i was looking for.  About the offers: On the last update we added a banner to buy diamonds on startup. It is supposed to show only once per session. Is this not what's happening on your device? Is this frequency of advertisement already too much? What other offers do you feel are just too much?  About replay value: Is there any feature that we could implement that would make you come back to the game? (Multiplayer, more diverse grind missions, special once-a-day stuff, anything really)"
iosgaming,3au1h7,Duncandisorderly271,2,Tue Jun 23 15:45:28 2015 UTC,"It's more the offers to buy guns etc on ""offer"" after missions. They mostly cost diamonds and the diamonds themselves cost a LOT of money. I would have no problem throwing a few euro your way for the game but €99.99 is a crazy price to be asking for fake currency.  For replay factor? Possibly make more guns available for purchase with the in game currency rather than diamonds. Less of the ""blow up the barrels"" grind missions and more of the missions like they used to be i.e. Here's a picture of this guy, find him and shoot him.  Multiplayer would be an interesting addition. Maybe turn based? Like complete the mission the quickest, most head shots in 30 secs etc and have someone try beat your record or you beat theirs.  I'm not a game developer or even a hardcore gamer. Your game I love because it can be dipped in and out of when you have a few minutes and the energy recharge times are spot on. Thank you for it btw! Hope I'm not being too critical. I love the game overall but I feel the reason it's score has dipped is because of the IAPs and the grinding missions (the ""warehouse"" missions) become repetitive."
iosgaming,3au1h7,Duncandisorderly271,2,Tue Jun 23 16:39:00 2015 UTC,"We'll be reviewing the pricey end of our pricing curve to lower these pricey scenarios in a future update. You'll probably see the diamond economy be less pricey overall, but specially on the last worlds. If it goes well, we'll transfer it to coins economy. I'll see what i´ll do about the end of game offers, but probably lower them. This will take some analysis  We tried to change the grind missions on a per world basis (each region has it's own set of 2 grind missions). It seems to me that you prefer the ""Wanted"" kind much more than the ""Warehouse"" kind. Is there any other grind mission that you enjoy or don't enjoy? (the current types are: Multi kill, Prison Break, Shooting Range, Head Shot and the previous two)  And i wish you were more critical! Slam the game all you want please!"
iosgaming,3au1h7,Duncandisorderly271,2,Tue Jun 23 17:40:12 2015 UTC,"The grind missions can be quite fun but the problem I found with them is that they are linked to each world and that they are too quick to finish. For example ""Warehouse"" in the final world is ONLY blowing up barrels. I made a challenge to myself to see how quickly I can complete it and I average about 5 or 6 seconds. I only play that particular grind mission because it has the highest payout of the rest. If say you combined the grind missions so they alternate between  Multi kill, prison break, warehouse etc I think that might alleviate the boredom factor of shooting the SAME four barrels over and over. There's nothing wrong with the warehouse missions in the same way there's nothing wrong with burgers. I love them but I don't want them for every meal!  The worlds are a bit...samey. Not a big gripe but everywhere just seems yellow!   I would have a look at Hitman:Sniper and maybe draw some inspiration from there. I realise you're an indie developer and probably couldn't hit the level of polish that Hitman can but it's a really good game imo. It does suffer because it only has one location and I honestly do think your game can stand toe-to-toe with it."
iosgaming,3au1h7,Duncandisorderly271,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:58:46 2015 UTC,"That's great feedback, thanks!  We'll see if we can make it switch between types in the same world.  And i've played Hitman Sniper. I honestly found it a bit boring, what did you liked about it (apart from graphics. I gotta hand it, theirs are better)?"
iosgaming,3au1h7,Duncandisorderly271,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:17:36 2015 UTC,"Yes their graphics are better but that's not massively important to me. I liked the open worldedness (that's a word I swear!) in hitman. For example you have to assassinate X but you also have to perform certain tasks before you did it. I honestly don't think that's a massively feasible option for your game but that's ok because your game is a different (but similar!) animal.  The rewards system is good in Hitman in that a headshot/accidental/disposal are worth more points. To be honest, 40 currency is a bit sparse for a headshot, especially in the higer levels when the reward for killing the target is in the tens of thousands. Perhaps the headshot reward could increase exponentially with the target reward? It would add an element of skill. I unconsciously found myself just blasting at centre mass because the headshot reward was insignificant."

On the itunes page the three reviews all features this bit of info:   ""You can't complete the game (as it is released right now) without spending real money. I'm also noting that the /amount/ of real money needed to purchase /the only/ weapon that would allow you to progress is absurd. I don't mind watching advertisements or even paying/donating to developers for great games; these require a lot of work, people have rent to pay. But it's very disappointing when a dev forces the hands of players, and by that I mean requiring them to spend upwards of $40 to progress. How is this even a realistic business model? Why would a consumer drop that kind of money when they could go buy a title for a next-gen console for the same (or less) amount of money?""  ""It's a fun game, I enjoyed it very much until I reached the point I could no longer progress. I contemplated spending some money, least I could do for the fun I had, right? No... Not after that math worked out. Wow.""  ""The prices of your in-apps are outrageous, especially with the extremely slow pace, and inability to acquire a single diamond or diamonds in any amount. It is going to take a year to just upgrade to shoot 6 more feet. $60 for a ""Package"", this is a stick up? Seem to be confident in your game to say the least. Having enough with the repetition I decided to give you the benefit of the doubt, ended being when done $35. I only progressed two levels. Ridiculous, I'm not going to spend a year watching game ads to get a scope that won't get you anywhere. Uninstalling because of principle, I waited for the update forever. Good luck, donate some of that to children's cancer research.""  ""Game not fun unless you make in app purchase! ""  ""This game would be fun except for a few big issues. First, you can't play long because your sniper runs ""out of power"". Ultimately you only get to play the game about 5 minutes before you run out of power and game wants you to purchase power as an in app purchase""   I really cant stand this type of monetisation- it favours paying money over gameplay. I don't want to think about and reminded of paying while I'm playing. I want to pay one price and be done. These type of games will be the downfall of the industry. They've ruined gaming on iOS. Make a game that people can play, not pay. Charge up front- one off. I know some people are OK with this type of game, but others of us really are not.  I really hope you haven't posted this here just so you can get a couple of extra downloads on your shitty (becaue of the monetization) game. This isn't the place for advertising - and the feedback on your game is clear to see on iTunes...."

iosgaming,3aq1e9,Kirkenjerk,3,Mon Jun 22 16:35:55 2015 UTC,"I was a lurker since the site opened and finally joined in March 2009. When I was hardcore into iOS gaming I strictly used TA forums and articles to find the best games.   It is, without question, the best site for iOS game news and reviews.  I'll do what I can to support the site monetarily. I don't post on the forums anymore and I rarely visit the site nowadays except when something big like FFVII is announced.   I do have a question that I hope won't be taken the wrong way. If the site is having issues staying afloat why are there still TA GDC parties? Isn't it that kind of superfluous spending that could cause the ship to sink faster?  I only ask because I'm curious, what you guys do with your money is your business. But if times seem troubling my first instinct would be to cut back on unnecessary spending and using that to advertise the site.   Have you guys considered purchasing TV and radio ads? Or advertising on apple related sites yourselves?  I would like to add that I have no idea how you guys go about your business so forgive my ignorance."
iosgaming,3aq1e9,ehodapp,7,Mon Jun 22 21:15:00 2015 UTC,"Our parties basically amount to ""Hey come on down to the bar in the Marriott lobby!"" Everyone buys their own beer, the venue is free since it's the hotel lobby, so our cost to host such a thing is $0. It's more just about hanging out with cool people, the networking that goes on there is consistently considered the best part of GDC for developers.  I suppose you could argue even going to GDC is an unnecessary expense, but, that and E3 are the two biggest events of the year but covering them adds lots of credibility to the site and it's pretty easy to spend a week in SF and LA without spending much money at all."

iosgaming,3aq1e9,skilless,11,Mon Jun 22 19:51:31 2015 UTC,"I remember when the App Store was new everyone noticed that there was a high correlation between what TA reviewed well and what Apple would feature. Obviously, the App Store editorial team was reading TA and taking notes 😉  I don't know if that's still the case, but I do know that Arn, hodapp and team are as on-the-ball about picking great games as ever. So while making money with games journalism seems to be really tough, I wonder if this one is best rescued by FruitCo themselves. Should /u/ehodapp become the new Games editor for Apple? Would he/they want to?"
iosgaming,3aq1e9,ehodapp,19,Mon Jun 22 16:58:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've had people who used to be in Apple editorial straight up tell me they used both the front page and the forums as a huge resource for picking what games to feature. We've also correlated that relationship countless times over the years as we stumble across random older games which are definitely out of the spot light, post a review, and they'll be featured by Apple the next day.  As far as working for Apple, I've got plenty of professional doors open for me personally, but I've always placed more value on doing cool things that make a difference over making tons of money (I used to work in the soul-crushing, but vastly over-paying, medical world). The mobile industry is absolutely overflowing with cash and I could've jumped ship to another job offer long ago, but just being a cog in some giant corporate machine is significantly less interesting than helping bring exposure to otherwise undiscovered indie developers on mobile.

iosgaming,3aq1e9,devensega,12,Mon Jun 22 19:08:38 2015 UTC,"I stopped reading about a year ago, the site just started to represent all that was wrong in mobile gaming. I don't blame those who run Touch Arcade, they were just following their market.   When you've read your fifth ""how to play Freemium Shite Ville and not spend a penny"" article in a month you tend to give up. Again, not their fault mobile gaming went the way it did, but it made for depressing reading."
iosgaming,3aq1e9,ehodapp,55,Mon Jun 22 16:28:43 2015 UTC,"We started doing those because it's the only thing that props up site traffic as that's quite literally all that people are searching Google for in the world of mobile gaming. Those articles pay for things like the RPG Reload series, in-depth reviews of obscure games, and interviews with niche indie developers. Guides account for (this year, anyway) 2% of our total content output and close to 85% of our total traffic."
iosgaming,3aq1e9,i010011010,3,Mon Jun 22 16:35:35 2015 UTC,"Take the bad with the good I suppose. I tend to ignore those types of articles, which isn't hard since I think there have only been like 3 so far this year, and focus on the articles discussing games that I'm actually interested in."
iosgaming,3aq1e9,ehodapp,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:47:14 2015 UTC,"I stopped because every review will have 'it's freemium but it's totally okay because I played for an hour and didn't find the paywall!  No paywall guys!'  'It's totally not pay-to-win, there's simply a clear advantage to paying to advance in this game!'  Let's see...the app has mandatory online, $90 IAP tiers, timers across every facet of the game, pushy social networking: five stars!  But they're still fixated on pointing out some imaginary paywall where they might be allowed to play a game for thirty minutes daily and technically not need to pay because if they did that every day for a year they could conceivably unlock the same content as the guy who pays as much as an Xbox game.  Woo.  I do blame Toucharcade in part for the inflation of IAP in mobile gaming.  It isn't merely 'following the market'--they've acted as apologists for the entire stupid business model.  When major reviewers refuse to chastise devs for scummy DLC schemes and adjust the scores appropriately--guess what?  We're going to see more DLC in games.  And left to their own devices, they're going to get increasingly exploitative about it."
iosgaming,3aq1e9,i010011010,3,Mon Jun 22 21:19:05 2015 UTC,"What's tricky about this whole situation is that the popular modern free to play games typically are just good games. Retention is the key metric all of the free to play outfits look for, and the best way to increase retention is to have something that's actually fun for players. It seems like a lot of people formed their opinions on free to play back in 2009 when free to play first started and it was very abusive... And have just held that grudge ever since.  Fallout Shelter has been sort of fascinating, because everyone who hates free to play seems to love Fallout... So they're giving it a try and discovering it's actually pretty good. :)"
iosgaming,3aq1e9,ehodapp,0,Mon Jun 22 21:31:37 2015 UTC,"It continues to be abusive.  Hopefully those people may have an actual, consistent metric for judging such payschemes which is what TA lacks.  For example, I deem any IAP that monetizes virtual currency is bad. I hold this belief because charging players real money for adjustments to a variable is exploitative.  I consider any game where the developer uses IAP to charge for new content i.e. expansion packs is good.  The difference is the latter represents time, effort and talent of the developer while the prior is a money making scheme.  On the other hand, 'Paywall' is a such an arbitrary, subjective, contrived, term that it is meaningless.  Reviews are all over the place in trying to evaluate whether a game can be played for some speculative amount of time without paying, and whether they can qualify it as good despite the presence of clearly abusive practices.  It's depressingly inconsistent because they will chastise a Dungeon Keeper or Final Fantasy ATB for conforming to the same principle IAP system as every other game they've lauded.  I've played Fallout and I can concede it fits that happy little space where countless gamers--opposed to paying outright for a game--will sit and idle away hours tapping those same old virtual cows under a Fallout skin.  It makes a better psychology paper than a video game.  I also notice that if you take away the delay mechanics, you're left with a very shallow game and I wonder if the reviews bother to notice."
iosgaming,3aq1e9,OccupiedMind,7,Mon Jun 22 22:10:38 2015 UTC,This is why we just focus on whether or not a game is fun. We're never going to be able to make everyone happy.

iosgaming,3aq1e9,LostBob,10,Mon Jun 22 19:44:54 2015 UTC,It can't get updated. We violate 2.25 and 2.26. The app will basically remain as is until it doesn't work anymore. Apple has rejected the updates we've submitted. https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#functionality

iosgaming,3aq1e9,LostBob,2,Tue Jun 23 04:46:12 2015 UTC,The problem is quite literally the core functionality of us recommending apps. We'd need to strip out basically every useful feature for it to get approved.
iosgaming,3aq1e9,ehodapp,1 point,Tue Jun 23 12:21:48 2015 UTC,Apples rules are nonsensical sometimes. They've basically ruled out native apps for websites that review apps then.

iosgaming,3aq1e9,grifftaur,3,Tue Jun 23 12:34:48 2015 UTC,"It's frustrating for us, but for other web sites who built up their entire business around their app, it's straight up fucked. AppAdvice appears to be in way worse shape than we are because they doubled down on a really great app that primarily provided a curated list of awesome apps that went free which apparently also breaks these same rules.  So, in hindsight, it's almost kind of nice that our app never took off in a huge way as this specific situation would be elevated from ""Ugh, this is super annoying"" to being a total dropkick to the balls."

How many more Clash of the Clans clones do we need? How many more clickers?  The app store is full of utter garbage the only website that seems to realize this and avoid it like the video game plague that it is, is pockettactics.  I not asking touch arcade to factor in whether I like a game or not into their game reviews. It'd be nice if they saw the bigger picture.  Ultimately though, you people are right, opinions are opinions, this is mine and it came off more angry than I usually like to portray myself."
iosgaming,3aq1e9,tx2005,3,Tue Jun 23 23:29:39 2015 UTC,"There is no such thing as a terrible trend in gaming, so long as people are happy and having fun playing the game.  Clickers are not popular because Apple sends out henchmen to hold guns to peoples' heads, telling them to play. They're popular because people love playing them.   Not everybody wants a deep game that they can sink thousands of hours into. Some people want a 2-3 minute distraction on their commute, or on their coffee break. Why should those people be denied pleasure, just because other people don't approve of their favorite gaming choices?  Shitty games sink to the bottom, and fun games rise to the top. That's the way the market works, and what that means is all these games that you don't approve of (clickers, CoC, etc), are what people want....so of course they're going to get good reviews."

iosgaming,3aq1e9,Arjayem,2,Tue Jun 23 14:47:22 2015 UTC,"I think you should try playing Bitcoin Billionaire. It exceedingly well done. Prior to Bitcoin Billionaire, I thought clickers were dumb as hell. Back when everyone was going wild about Candy Box it just broke my brain trying to see what anyone saw in it. Bitcoin Billionaire changed all that.  The idea of mining bitcoins by tapping your iPhone screen was just silly enough to draw me in, and I was hooked. We all were hooked. ...Then throw into the mix their clever way of monetizing the game using in-game ads as power ups? It's amazing how much the dynamic of in-game advertising shifted from ""Ugh, ads"" to ""Man I hope I get another ad because I really could use a boost right now."" All around, exceptionally clever game design of taking mechanics I found to be boring or annoying and wrapping them up in a package that I want to go back and play right now because you reminded me of it.  We don't take money for reviews, we're just excited about games. Our editorial reputation is everything, and the whole reason we're able to do things like this Patreon and get a positive reaction from our community. I can't think of a dollar value someone could give me that would make me want to throw that away. As mentioned earlier in this thread, we're really not motivated by money- We just want to cover our costs and do awesome things, like spread awareness of stupid games like Bitcoin Billionaire that I'm going to download again right now."
iosgaming,3aq1e9,ehodapp,1 point,Tue Jun 23 12:14:09 2015 UTC,"I did try Bitcoin Billionaire and I found it 'dumb as hell'.  A game where the only gameplay mechanic is tapping the screen as fast as you can for as long as you can to trick out a virtual office isn't a game. Adding micro payments to such a travesty is disgusting.   Clever tricks to make the user watch advertisements do not, under any circumstance, make a game good, and ever more so, does not warrant a perfect score in a review.  There is a reason we watch the 5 second countdown on a YouTube video ad, waiting for the 0 second mark, because ads fucking suck.  Interesting that Final Fantasy: All the Bravest scored an abysmal 1 star review due to the exact same ""non-existent gameplay"" (as stated in the game review) despite being arguably more feature rich and it had a nice Final Fantasy veneer on it.  *edits for typos & formatting"

I remember in the same week they gave the Telltale Game of Thrones game 3 Stars (while giving little to no reason why it warranted that score), they gave some FTP garbage (a super shallow clicker game if I remember right) 5 stars.   Also the mods of the comment section are very often rude or condescending if you remotely disagree with the review or article.

As far as then following the ""market"" is mostly due to too many players, (kids and parents), are the exact reason for the freemium cr a p that keeps being at the top in the ApoStore. Everyone freaks when any hard working developer actually wants to eat and pay their own bills. Instead it's a OH My GODdddddddd!!!!!! Those bastards! They are charging me $0.99 for a game! How dare they! They must burn!!!! and make holy crusade to lower quality game ratings making up multiple false games of something being junk, and preventing any possible success great games, with no bull sh it garbage IAP, while Bitcoin Billionaire and similar get constant 5 star rave reviews that top the store. Want to solve the problem? Easy. Start by looking at the pay once and play area on the AppStore.  Spend your money on those games, and start a trend by wrecking the train wreck of IAP based games. Which makes more sense, (especially since many so-called AAA PS4/Xbox games cost $65.00+), spend $5.00 or $15.00 to buy a full game, no ads, no IAP garbage? or end up spending well over $75.00 in the months you play a ""free"" game, full of ads, user tracking, (user spying), etc., for fictional lunch boxes, weapons, cheats, pay-to-win junk? It's simple, look for and spend your real money on games that show real support for those that aren't forced into IAP pay to win trash. That would also give you all extra $ to support a really worthwhile site like Touch Arcade, and spend even $5.00 to support them people. Try using what brains God gave you all."

iosgaming,3asbw7,amoderate,3,Tue Jun 23 02:54:53 2015 UTC,"Eva Falls is an endless runner in space.  I made it mostly for me.  I ride the metro a lot to work in Tokyo and have a bit of claustrophobia.  I needed something that could be played one handed and was distracting but without a lot of the normal gamification elements one might find in typical endless runners such as achievements, sounds that signal rewards etc.all of which seems to exacerbate my anxiety.  The result is Eva Falls. A simple endless runner in space accompanied by a wordless soundscape. It's my first game and I don't expect it to go to far, but it has been really fun to make nonetheless and I hope you all may find it fun as well.   I have a few promo codes left so please feel free to PM me if you want to try it out!"
iosgaming,3asbw7,xaRg0n,1 point,Tue Jun 23 03:04:36 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the code first of all!  Lets jump right into it.  What I liked about it: the visuals are stunning, artistically the aesthetics are pleasant to say the least and it really captivates me, there are literally 2-3 games that do this to me. I give it 5/5 for the visuals. It actually reminds me of ALONE... From laser dog. And that's a compliment.  Another thing I also appreciated is the quick ""Play"" option. There is no delay there is no useless info and statistics. Just pure get on it kind of feeling. It really stands out.  The price tag is 99 €, well worthy it if you ask me. Maybe 1.99€ is more realistic but that's just me.  sound effects are fine nothing spectacular, for this kind of game they click. You are alone in the space roaming around before you die.. macabre efforts, the last moments of your existence before the endless space devour you. Getting really into it :)  What I really loved and imo makes this game super special and stand out is how the environment works against you. There 2 types of rocks a black one and a white one. You have to maneuver around the space and use the background for the rocks to show their true color. If you swipe left and there is the black background(space) the black rocks camouflage itself so the odds are against you. You have to use the background if you want to make a decent score. Otherwise you are doomed. Plain and simple.  My only dislike are the controls. They are not bad but not perfect as well and in these kind of games. I'd rather have the ugliest game in my hands than have okay controls. With some tweaking I believe this game will be perfect.  All in all I give it 8/10 for being honest with me. It is what it is and I love it for it's simplicity and how gorgeous it is.  I hope my feedback won't hurt your feelings about it, it's actually a very well done game."
iosgaming,3asbw7,xaRg0n,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:41:31 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the feedback. And critical feedback is welcome of course. I will work on the controls for the next update. Right now there are two modes: touch and drag, or tap. I found the best method was the touch and drag but I think some people prefer the tap.  I can make them more responsive and I may add a tutorial for first time users. Since the game is intended to be pretty short for each play through I kind of liked the idea of learning by dying, but I can see how it could be frustrating,   Any way yeah try touch and drag. (Like the game Stay In the Line)."

iosgaming,3at1li,RedHerringxx,2,Tue Jun 23 08:18:47 2015 UTC,Yeah for old buyer it's a bit bad. For new players good price. On the other hand I see it like Football Chairman 2014 and now 2015. Pro version will also get database editor in a couple of weeks. That's a nice addition.  Also developers could make a bundle in the appstore where it could be half the price for old customers.

iosgaming,3ar3ne,TheVvote,2,Mon Jun 22 20:48:03 2015 UTC,"The game came to the App store June 2nd, I started on the 7th. Level 29, and almost a full team of S ranked characters. Its definitely a pay-to-win game, but I havent spent a dime and I'm still in the top 70 in ranked battle and seem to hold my own. If you DONT spend money, the game is very ""grindy"".   If you get souls for a character, and you get enough, you can revive them in the hero menu to gain that character. If you already have them you can use their souls to boost them. I have my Goku at ""+4"" right now, and the blue border around his picture glows and sparks. I havent found anything about the boost system online yet since the forums are limited, but im hoping once you boost a character enough times, they transform?"
iosgaming,3ar3ne,Super_Marshy,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:54:37 2015 UTC,"Actually game was on beta for a while before and did not reset, june 2nd was the release of s2 I think. You are mostly right about it being grindy, but what op said about being able to compete with cash players, at least on s1, was completely false. Their characters boosts were way higher than mine and some friends."
iosgaming,3ar3ne,Chronys,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:27:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah I used the power up thing under growth on kid trunks enough times to fill up the bar thinking he'd ""evolve"" a la pokemon into regular trunks and it gave me ONE trunks soul, of the 15 needed to make the character.  I'm guessing my kid trunks is going to be kid trunks forever?  Considering the ""powerup"" nature of the DBZ genre I think they missed an opportunity by not putting in character progression.  I hope you're correct about the transformation theory but if you're at +4 I highly doubt it (although it seems silly to me to have ten different types of Goku characters at various levels rather than tying them together into some sort of linear progression).  I wouldn't mind spending a couple dollars but I get the impression the end game is just being pitted against other players in a pissing contest of who spent the most money.  I don't mind spending $5 to be competitive, but the leaderboard is basically just a nice list of who spent the most money then I'm probably gonna look for another game and/or do something more productive (anything but that)."
iosgaming,3ar3ne,Super_Marshy,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:34:33 2015 UTC,"Not power up under growth section. When you click on the character and have enough souls to make a second character completely, you can have the original absorb all of the souls instead and they gain +60 vigor and their image has lightning spark around them. The more times you collect enough souls and boost them the more intense the lightning effect. I'll keep everyone posted whether or not I get something cool."
iosgaming,3ar3ne,09stibmep,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:28:47 2015 UTC,Why does using the little upgrade potions only affect two set stats (and subtract from one and add to another)?  Are some characters  just supposed to have zero defense and a thousand SP?
iosgaming,3ar3ne,Chronys,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:06:32 2015 UTC,Not on the store for me so maybe it's in soft launch?
iosgaming,3ar3ne,Chronys,1 point,Tue Jun 23 01:40:17 2015 UTC,"Huh, I didn't even know developers did that.  The server I'm on is one of a small amount and it rolls over at 12:00 a.m. in my time zone (I'm in the US, for reference), so it might be a limited US release.  It is fairly new, though.  Looks like the eighth server launched today.  The previously released one (the one I'm on, S7 Capt Ginyu) was released on the seventh of june, so assuming the first few were probably released in a batch it's probably less than a month or two old.  Warning:  English levels are about 7/10."
iosgaming,3ar3ne,JorSum,1 point,Tue Jun 23 02:24:13 2015 UTC,"Tried it for about a month on s1 as soon as it was released and it is absurdly pay to win, the events are mostly about spending money for rewards and the support is terrible. All in all still had a bit of fun in the beginning.  Edit: I can see your server is pretty new if you can come close to beating the cash spenders, sorry but that won't be the case in a week or 2."
iosgaming,3aog9k,nxtboyIII,7,Mon Jun 22 04:52:11 2015 UTC,"Gameloft had a really nice shooting mechanic in NOVA 2 but for whatever reason decided to ditch it entirely for their newer games. Their mechanic allowed aiming and shooting to be much easier on touch screen devices. They got rid of the 'fire' button in most touch screen FPS games that take up space and thus you might accidentally press it (still available as a toggle in the settings though).  Their solution was that in order to shoot you'd double tap and hold the screen. Works real well. Just a suggestion, and best of luck mate."
iosgaming,3aog9k,jhuynh405,3,Mon Jun 22 06:51:53 2015 UTC,"I agree, they really dumped thier mechanics, I think NOVA 3 isn't that good. And also thier newer Modern Combat games aren't as good as the old ones"

We hope you really enjoy TapPhrase. You're shown a cartoon picture of a common phrase and you have to solve the anagram to earn stars which you can use to buy helpers and new level packs as they become available. There's also a daily 'spin the wheel' token, and rewards for watching adverts, and in-game achievements (not using game center). You can also farm the levels to get parts of the 'wheel' to construct a 'spin the wheel token' in game.  If you're clever, quick and worldly wise, or just darn persistent, you may never have to buy an in-app-purchase. But to keep our motivation going, it'd be nice to break even - we'd appreciate a donation or two by buying some in-game currency or watching ads.  It's been created by one developer (me) and one artist, all in our spare time. We've invested over 1000 hours in this game and involved five beta testers from different demographics, with different devices and patterns of use. So we've tried our best to create a bug-free, non-naggy experience.  We may enable Facebook sharing, but I hate games that do - so am torn! We appreciate this game isn't for everyone, and the difficulty curve is purely subjective. Please give us your feedback, good and bad, so that we can improve the game! TIA  view in the App Store"
iosgaming,3alfi7,trevx,3,Sun Jun 21 13:26:39 2015 UTC,"I'm liking it so far. I completed the first 10 puzzles with ease, so looking forward to seeing more challenging puzzles in the later stages.  Things I like:   Art style is great. The staging, the ""old movie"" effect for the puzzle pictures. Nicely done. Sound is well done. I feel the claps and cheers fit with the art style. The puzzles are also well done. Not too hard at the start. I feel there is a nice pace in earning currency, at least at the start (I haven't gotten too far into the harder puzzles yet). It remains to be seen if I'd need them, but I found the IAP to be reasonably priced compared to other apps. Good stuff. Ads are not too intrusive.   Things I feel could be improved (may be subjective):   Some of the UI animations are a tad slow, in my opinion. Specifically, the Continue button sliding in should be faster. I just want to finish a puzzle and move on to the next one quickly. I might like to see a different art style for the letters. Maybe my 35 year old mind is not as sharp anymore, but for me the letters were a little harder to identify quickly compared to other word games I play. Maybe a different font? I like the style of them and they fit well with the theme, so maybe its just the font. Purely subjective, I realize. I'm on Phrase #6 of the ""Getting Harder"" pack and it crashes whenever I try to play it. iPhone 6 Plus with the latest iOS. I restarted my device, didn't help.   Nice game. Good luck :-)"

In terms of difficulty, there will be some that are more tricky than others, but the worst ones are when you just haven't heard the saying before! Which is where you probably start spending your stars or asking friends for help.  Unfortunately The letters are hand drawn, so might not be changing them soon.  I'm really concerned about the crashing on the 'Getting Harder' pack! That's never happened in testing. Well, with v1.0 it did, but not v1.1. I wonder what it could be. You'll probably not manage to get beyond it without a re-install.  The levels are actually served in a random order, so number 6 isn't the same on all devices.   Worst case - try uninstalling and reinstalling. But you'll lose your progress (and yes, you can probably get more stars by re-doing them).  I'll dive right into testing 1.1 on 6 plus on an emulator, and ask my friend to try it on his physical device - thank you."

But people don't tend to pay for games upfront these days. I hate the drip-feed IAP mentality personally (aka Candy Crush). I'd like to sleep at night knowing I've not taken advantage of some addicted 'sucker'. I'd rather get passive income from advertising after that initial purchase.  As for your final point - the speed of animations... We might present awards earned at the end of the level (instead of making you go out to the awards screen), which might slow you down further - sorry.

The elevator pitch is that it's ""word search for grown ups"", with college-level words that can turn and twist instead of going in straight lines.  It has no word list; instead, you are given a theme, and you have to find words that match the theme.  When all the letters in the puzzle have been found as part of a word, the puzzle is solved.  It's ""free with IAP"", but not in the usual sense of annoying timers and consumables.  You get one set of the puzzles for free, which should last you for a while and be a decent diversion in its own right.  If you enjoy the game, more puzzle sets are available for $1 each, with themes like movies, cuisine, sports, etc., but they're entirely optional."

iosgaming,3ainke,Deliverancexx,1 point,Mon Jun 22 08:38:22 2015 UTC,"Since nobody replied, I'll give it a go even though it's very late! I haven't been playing it too long myself but I have heard enough about it from others who are well on their way to being 'Elite'. Unless you manage to find a good server with some sort of awesome Alliance (Clan / Guild) that takes in and provides protection for Newbies, it may be very difficult for someone who doesn't pay to get going. I haven't found any magical Alliance like this yet on my own server, though I wish I could!  There's an item called a Peace Shield which means other players cannot attack your stronghold when it is active. Subsequently, you cannot attack others either or the peace shield is disabled. You start with one of them for your first day, but if you don't buy more or get lucky and receive them, possibly through in game events then you're going to be attacked constantly or at least semi-frequently by other players. You'll constantly have a bunch of your already tiny army in the hospital, and lose resources that you desperately need. This can be avoided a little if you time your purchases properly, spending all of your resources before exiting the game for prolonged periods of time. And by having your storage (protects resources) upgraded enough.   All that said, spending as little as 5 dollars can really give you a huge boost allowing you to progress much much quicker, and usually provides you with a good number of peace shields to allow you to get everything going. Although, I wouldn't want to put money toward a game I don't even know I like yet, either.  I know a few friends who started playing  totally free and got deep in to the game and in to good alliances before spending a dime. It is totally doable, but will definitely take some effort."

Keep in mind that there's nothing wrong with promoting your work, but you need to do it in a way that comes off as less...desperate? The best way I can put it is if you imagine that you meet up with some strangers on a night out and, instead of easing them in by introducing yourself and socialising with them, you immediately start a sales pitch.

iosgaming,3aaebv,09stibmep,2,Fri Jun 19 04:15:56 2015 UTC,"Not from me, sorry. The provisioning profile created to run the app is linked to my Apple ID, and I'm not going to distribute that on the off chance someone could extract identifying information. I'm not too familiar with exactly what gets bundled with an app, so this may be overly paranoid on my part, but it's not worth the risk.  That said, anyone you know with a Mac should be able to build it for you, they just need to download XCode 7 beta first. (It's a free download.)"

iosgaming,3a7gr4,Rokakku,8,Wed Jun 17 20:46:45 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry in advance for how imperfect these suggestions are. They all hit some, but not all of your criteria.  Luxuria Superbia is... different. Not a 3D adventure and there's technically a point, but it definitely fits as something colorful, musical, and interesting to chill out to.  The first thing I thought of by your description was Kairo. High on the exploration, though, again, there's a point. It's a very low-pressure adventure game thats quite atmospheric given how minimalist the art is.  Hiversaires has an awesome atmosphere and place to explore, but its old-school point-and-click difficulty was too high for me.  Year Walk, Device 6, The Sailor's Dream, Sword & Sworcery, Finding Teddy, The Silent Age, The Cave, and Monument Valley all have great atmospheres, but they contain exploration as point-and-click adventures rather than open-ended exploration.  Beat Hazard Ultra (and while we're at it, the Geometry Wars series) is awesome for music and colors, but there's practically no exploration.  Waking Mars is a pretty great Metroidvania with a cool atmosphere. Again, exploring with a purpose, but it's pretty good exploration.  Junk Jack, The Blockheads, and Terraria are all excellent 2D implementations of Minecraft. They all have cool world exploration as well as exploring what you can do. These are less atmospheric, but like Minecraft, the purpose is whatever you want."
iosgaming,3a7gr4,xx99,2,Thu Jun 18 01:34:35 2015 UTC,"Came to suggest Waking Mars. Definitely fits the bill.  I'd also say Desert Golfing, which technically is not aimless, since you have to aim for the hole ;)."

iosgaming,3a7ue2,Nookiezilla,3,Wed Jun 17 23:16:43 2015 UTC,"Alright, I put together a quick list. While money's not an object here, one of your best options may be a free game. Final Fantasy Record Keeper would be a good companion piece to any of these games.   But whatever you do, avoid All The Bravest like the plague.  HIGH ON THE LIST ON SALE  Final Fantasy IV: A classic that's really well done, though the voice acting in the cutscenes can be a bit much. Classic story.  Final Fantasy V: May not be for everyone, but this one's on the overlooked side. Job system may be a turnoff for some, but it really adds a lot to the game. I still chuckle that the villain's name is Exdeath.   ON SALE BUT OK  Final Fantasy III: It's a pretty good game, but when they ported it to the DS (which this version is based on) they compensated for having fewer enemies on screen in a battle by cranking up their power and it's definitely on the unbalanced side.   NOT ON SALE BUT STILL GOOD  Final Fantasy VI: Part of me says just wait for it to go on sale like the others, but it's still a fantastic game that's right up there with IV and VII as best in the series.   FREE AND DOABLE  Final Fantasy: Record Keeper - A surprisingly fun game that's free-to-play, but very generous with its handouts, so you can genuinely play it for free and enjoy it.   AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE  Final Fantasy: All the Bravest - This game is a shitpile designed to get you to dump money with little to do with Final Fantasy aside from the characters, music and setting. The gameplay is swipe to win, and most characters are locked behind nasty paywalls."

What really sucks is that Torchlight 2 is great on PC and Runic was super keen to support mods and other features that we wanted.  Bethesda and SquareEnix are just two AAA companies that have proven you can make a profit AND release real, enjoyable games on mobile, I really wish other companies would start following suit."
iosgaming,3a4a1x,Asytra,5,Wed Jun 17 16:57:54 2015 UTC,Yep Square Enix charges a ton for those games and they sell.  I would gladly pay $19.99 for a quality Torchlight mobile but I won't ever spend $19.99 on a F2P game from greedy devs.  Timers serve one purpose in these games and that is milking money out of people who don't know they are being taking advantage of.
iosgaming,3a4a1x,Asytra,2,Wed Jun 17 18:55:23 2015 UTC,"Practices like that are why mobile gaming is still considered a joke by most gamers.  I will say, though, that since I migrated from Android to iOS I've actually found some mobile games that are real, enjoyable games.

Shame on them and I'm not touching this piece of shit (if it does end up being pure F2P) or any other games they release in the future as a result.  So much for having TL on mobile.. /sigh"
iosgaming,3a4a1x,VesperX,-24,Wed Jun 17 13:18:04 2015 UTC,how dare they make money for their work.
iosgaming,3a4a1x,Invisible-Gorilla,15,Wed Jun 17 16:34:04 2015 UTC,This is not and has never been the assertion. People clearly expressed a willingness to pay for the game. What people don't want is games designed around exploitative and consumer hostile monetization schemes.
iosgaming,3a4a1x,Jorlen,7,Wed Jun 17 16:40:22 2015 UTC,"Well said.  I'd drop $20 for a mobile version of TL but this timer/F2P shit I'll never support.  Premium games are the only things I buy on IOS.  And yes, I often pay 10-20 bucks for games if they're worth it!"
iosgaming,3a4a1x,fabio-mc,0,Wed Jun 17 16:44:35 2015 UTC,"You would, how many of you exist when compared to iap buyers? And how much money do you think can be made in each scenario?

iosgaming,3a4a1x,Jorlen,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:49:34 2015 UTC,Whether the companies want feedback or not.  Here I fucking am!  Good god damn thing there are still some companies who don't sell their soul and provide premium games.  And you know what?  The good games turn up a profit too!
iosgaming,3a4a1x,fabio-mc,-4,Wed Jun 17 19:23:35 2015 UTC,"To me, this situation is a live and let die one. I feel like it's pointless to criticize people for eanting to make money. A lot of people throughout history have used a way to make money to drive forward their dreams and do good things. i can, indeed, complain when a company doesn't make good use of their money, but in this case I'm assuming the company is going to make Torchlight 3 for pc eith all the money they get. Will you complain if this happen? Because it would be stupid of them not to do this. Another game to profit on pcs and another port to keep the huge profits in mobile."
iosgaming,3a4a1x,Jorlen,3,Wed Jun 17 19:34:42 2015 UTC,"Gaming is a passion for me and always has been since pong.  So, when I see practices that I don't agree with (i.e. the F2P model) I voice my opinion.  Whether or not this opinion is desired by anyone who works within these companies is of no concern to me.  I am disagreeing with it, I will always disagree with it and IF all of gaming were to fold into this model, I would leave the hobby behind forever and never look back.  Fuck the F2P model.  May it die by fire.    Edit:  This will be my last response and I already feel like I'm a broken record player.  To the people working for Runic or working on this project on behalf of Runic, with respect I wish you good luck, but I will not be supporting you or your future endeavors :(  Edit again:  I just wanted to note that I am not against free apps that have content IAP or a full mode unlock IAP (i.e. to remove adds, etc) but timers and such things are terrible and IMO ruin a game the moment they're implemented."
iosgaming,3a4a1x,FoldedDice,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:52:07 2015 UTC,"My approach to this is fairly simple. I play and support the premium titles I enjoy, and pay very little attention to the free-to-play side of the market, although I do keep a lookout for the few cases where the business model isn't a hindrance to gameplay. From what I can see, this won't be one of those cases."
iosgaming,3a4a1x,fabio-mc,-1,Thu Jun 18 07:56:09 2015 UTC,"I know, I understand, we are just showing two ways of dealing with this kind of stuff. I'm not passionate about games enough but I feel like people should do whatever they can to make money as long as it doesn't hurt other people or people's rights. This kind of game hurts nobody, so I won't complain about it, but I can respect your willingness to voice your opinion and help move the industry to a better way of doing business. I just feel like people circlejerk so hard about it that it gets annoying, yes it's a bad practice, but arcades also were and people talk with nostalgia about those times."
iosgaming,3a4a1x,VesperX,-6,Wed Jun 17 20:27:02 2015 UTC,"Its nothing new to the mobile market and yet people are still surprised when it happens. As for hostile monetization, i think we will have to see the final format and if there will be compensation in terms of updates and events. You have to remember that game developers cant afford to make games for a dead market and the serious gamers make up a tiny fraction of the mobile community. without the F2P games bringing in new players there wouldnt be nearly as many Pay Once games worth buying."
iosgaming,3a4a1x,Invisible-Gorilla,4,Wed Jun 17 16:53:46 2015 UTC,"without the F2P games bringing in new players there wouldnt be nearly as many Pay Once games worth buying.   Considering gaming sector is already vast and still growing rapidly. Bullshit.  There's no real secret sauce here. Make good games and people will buy them. The more companies want to shit on customers, the less the customers will want to continue doing business with them. Just like always.  It's not a popular scheme because people love it, it's popular because developers found it was easily exploitable. That's not the same as making a good game and it certainly carries no moral obligation for customers to pay them for a shitty product."

iosgaming,3a4a1x,fandangalo,3,Fri Jun 19 13:39:50 2015 UTC,"Honestly, this is more Perfect Worlds' (publisher) doing than Runic, I'm sure. It sounds like after the partnership between the companies, things got a little rocky. I wouldn't ever doubt Perfect Worlds would take nothing short of a market and data driven approach. So none of this is surprising.  I just think they'll shoot some of the audience who could have vouched for the product early on in the foot. They'll make money, because pissed off vocal gamers isn't where the money is (most of the 'gamers' are only 33% of the market share, probably worse on mobile). There's many other ARPGs in Diablo style that all do this model, and most come from Asia.  I would have just increased the grind and sold boosters. Less conversion, probably, but energy timers are fairly dead for monetization. They usually signal low quality content or a lack of content in general; they're just gates for progress while they make content."
iosgaming,3a4a1x,fandangalo,1 point,Wed Jun 17 13:03:51 2015 UTC,Actually Perfect Worlds is developing it for Android.  Fedeen Games is developing the iOS version.
iosgaming,3a4a1x,fandangalo,3,Wed Jun 17 14:15:21 2015 UTC,"So Runic isn't developing anything? Because PW was just the publisher for Torchlight II, and now they are doing the development instead of Runic?   If all that's the case, then I don't see why people should raise pitchforks against Runic. Obviously, some sort of 'rights to the brand' transaction happened, its being used against them, and that's the business. Sounds more like a young developer mistake."
iosgaming,3a4a1x,icu_,1 point,Wed Jun 17 14:40:38 2015 UTC,Right - go to toucharcade and look for their first article on torchlight mobile (i.e. just search for torchlight mobile there - they only have two articles). It gave some detail on the structure behind the scenes.  I can't link to it now because I am at work and that site is blocked.
iosgaming,3a4a1x,HaiKarate,2,Wed Jun 17 15:16:19 2015 UTC,"Article in question, I believe.   Fedeen is developing the iOS version of the game. [...] It might be free-to-play, but Perfect World, while a regular publisher of MMOs, doesn't do free-to-play exclusively. However, Fedeen Games, who appear to be handling the mobile version, seem to do mostly free games.   EDIT: So yeah, don't defame Runic because Perfect Worlds is trying to make money. If you don't like how Perfect Worlds handles it, complain to them and don't play it."
iosgaming,3a4a1x,Derrythe,6,Wed Jun 17 15:52:37 2015 UTC,"I had high hopes for this game.  While I knew it was F2P, I held out hope this would have at least a creative F2P model.  Nope. This is just infuriating.  Please don't support crappy studios that make this garbage.   Energy timers are such a fucking cop-out.    Edit: for anyone looking for a good Diablo like game, check out Dungeon Quest.  It has a great dev, frequent updates, perfect F2P model, and while it isn't perfect it is a ton of fun."
iosgaming,3a4a1x,misfitskater6,2,Wed Jun 17 03:01:31 2015 UTC,That is such a shame. I was very excited for this game and now it's on my ignore list. Is there another decent Diablo II-esque iOS game that's just a straight game?
iosgaming,3a4a1x,whodatfever,2,Wed Jun 17 13:17:12 2015 UTC,The closest thing right now is Dungeon Quest which is a loot based dungeon crawler.   It isn't perfect but it is getting there. It is a F2P game by Shinybox and the F2P is done perfect.  No energy timer crap and it the IAP are optional to just support the dev.  They have really frequent updates and I would recommend it to anyone looking to scratch that Diablo itch.
iosgaming,3a4a1x,VesperX,4,Wed Jun 17 14:13:34 2015 UTC,"I had also hoped that the IAP would be for cosmetic things that didn't really affect gameplay. I'll spend money on IAP games that aren't pay-to-win, just to show support."

I don't really have the time to sit and play through an entire game on my iPad anyway so timers isn't even an issue for me. And the benefit of IAP systems like this, generally speaking, is continues support and development. That usually means updates and events that Pay Once games don't generally get. Did you see the new quest line in Bastion? Yeah, me neither.  And while that doesn't make them bad games, their storyline is singular and their replay value minimal. I've played Torchlight 1 & 2 already. I don't need to keep playing the exact game on my phone now too."
iosgaming,3a4a1x,tsukikari,2,Wed Jun 17 16:28:08 2015 UTC,"Being F2P is not the problem.  Plenty of games do F2P right.  The problem is that energy timers, stamina, etc.  are just signs of low quality greedy devs.  It would be like an arcade game that asked you to insert coins every 30 seconds.  It ruins immersion in the game and is just shameless greed."
iosgaming,3a4a1x,trusk89,0,Wed Jun 17 17:33:00 2015 UTC,What's the right way to do F2P in your opinion that still contributes to development and content?
iosgaming,3a4a1x,tsukikari,4,Wed Jun 17 18:00:55 2015 UTC,A balanced approach that doesn't use artificial systems to restrict players but encourages them to spend money through making a quality game.  It is frustrating because to make money they don't HAVE To use timers.  Plenty do it without and it is just greed driving their use.  Dungeon quest for example.  Playing does not require spending money.  They made it cosmetic and you can get ahead by buying gold if you really want to.  They have new content and patches cery frequently.  This is not an either or situation.  You don't have to use timers to make money.  These developers like Fedeen games are trying to churn out games and make as much money as possible by taking advantage of peoples acceptance of garbage like timers.  They are ruining a great chance here and it def pisses me off.
iosgaming,3a4a1x,tsukikari,0,Wed Jun 17 18:38:03 2015 UTC,"Man I'm gonna ask you one thing: do you like money? It your answer is yes, then answer me, which one made more money, Candy Crush or Dungeon Quest? It's all about money, and if it supports a good game on pc being made with the money of a shitty one on mobile, I can agree with that."
iosgaming,3a4a1x,VesperX,-4,Wed Jun 17 18:58:47 2015 UTC,I prefer energy timers over ads or paywalls though...
iosgaming,3a4a1x,trusk89,6,Wed Jun 17 03:49:02 2015 UTC,Why? I just want to play the game. I don't want to have to wait to play it or be forced more money to play it.
iosgaming,3a4a1x,tobbyplz,1 point,Wed Jun 17 09:48:45 2015 UTC,Basically because I don't want to pay money for it and I tend to stay more interested in games if I play them over a period of time as opposed to all at once in a short burst. But I do agree that it would be great to have an option to pay to disable the stamina system for people who don't mind spending.

Cold War is technically the newer game but Storm Raiders is equally good and has a larger competitive scene."
iosgaming,3a4h77,Makegooduseof,1 point,Wed Jun 17 04:19:58 2015 UTC,Thanks! I see there's a bundle too! I'll check these ones out!
iosgaming,3a4h77,Makegooduseof,1 point,Wed Jun 17 04:29:58 2015 UTC,"Do you like, or are you open to card games?   If you are, I recommend Fluxx by Playdek, Inc.  To the best of my memory - I had downloaded this a long time ago - it should be free with zero IAP. It hasn't been updated since release, but it still runs just fine on an iPad 4 running iOS 8.1.1."

iosgaming,39yn5b,EyeceEyeceBaby,13,Fri Jun 19 16:31:56 2015 UTC,How about KotOR? Just finished my first playthrough in years thanks to the iOS version. Easily one of my favorite RPGs. The sequel is up there on my list as well but unfortunately there's no iOS version.

iosgaming,39yn5b,tsukikari,4,Tue Jun 16 18:53:14 2015 UTC,"If you need 3D, go give the revamped Final Fantasy 4 a shot. It may not be as sophisticated as 7, given that 4 was practically the first FF game to feature a fleshed-out storyline.   And based on your description, you'll lose attention on Chrono Trigger - it's 2D."
iosgaming,39yn5b,handofreason,2,Mon Jun 15 21:40:17 2015 UTC,"Not OP, but do you think of the FF4 After Years game? (There's a bundle with both FF4 and the after years and I'm not sure if to get both or just FF4)."
iosgaming,39yn5b,thunderdoom,1 point,Mon Jun 15 23:50:32 2015 UTC,I'll try it! =)
iosgaming,39yn5b,handofreason,6,Fri Jun 19 16:32:04 2015 UTC,"Chrono Trigger for sure. But I wouldn't call it a predecessor for Final Fantasy games though. All 6 of the 2D Final Fantasies already had come out by the time Chrono Trigger did. Nonetheless, it was also a Square game so there was definitely similarities in art and gameplay.  If it needs to be iOS Gaming, then you should also check out Secret of Mana. Came out two years before Chrono Trigger and has a great, long story, and the graphics are top notch 16-bit.   Final Fantasy 6 is my favorite Final Fantasy game, and I've played them all. It's not the best by some wide margin, but I think it has the best story and characters of any out of the series. It has a bit of a slow start so you may want to save that for later.  I would personally start with Chrono Trigger. There's enough style and good pacing to get you hooked quickly. Secret of Mana also has a good opening hour, and both are 25 hour games, and probably well over 40 hours if you explore every nook and cranny.  EDIT: Oh and Final Fantasy 6 would be about 35 hours to beat, and well over 60 hours for a 100% play through."

Good stories on both - and different games - Chrono is an old school final fantasy like game - and Tactics is a grid base tactical rpg - where you can find Cloud to join you eventually ;)

That said, I think the overall artwork of the menus and the sound of the game needs some work. A game like 3's, for example, really captivates me by the quirky sounds and casual feel and artwork. When I play your game, I feel like I'm in an 80's arcade but you have a shotgun to my stomach and it's fight or flight. It felt a little difficult to get into at first and from a non-review standpoint I would have just uninstalled it.  The biggest audience for you in the app store is a casual player. People just love things that work and are easy to get into, but ramp in difficulty long term. I'd consider, if possible, tuning the difficulty a bit and maybe even slowing down the ball or increasing the time that the ""bar"" lasts after you draw it with your finger.  That's just my opinion, though. I feel like harsh criticism helps the most in refining something for the better.

Personally, i dont like that ""pixelated"" look that makes you feel the game was made in 2009. I think you should keep the look make it in a higher resolution. 2. It's rather unclear what you're supposed to do after you lost the game. No ""restart game"" button or anything. It think you should add something that looks like the alternatives you get when you win. 3. Optimise the game for iPhone 6 and 6 Plus."

iosgaming,39r9me,Deeliciousness,2,Sun Jun 14 20:40:29 2015 UTC,"Nice idea!  Agreed, it is a bit hard at first.  Power-Ups would be a great addition! Longer bar, multi ball, etc.  I also managed to get the ball bouncing horizontally, so I waited for about 30secs to see if anything happened. Nothing did - you might want to include some countermeasure to avoid getting stuck that way.  Edit: I just realized we can paint anywhere. This of course fixes the pingponging issue."

I wasn't trying to be rude I just thought that asking for a complex RPG with that sort of weapon customization that can be played one handed and doesn't take up a lot of room while not draining your battery is a tad bit unrealistic.   Oh also there's a dragon quest -- the 3D one-- VIII. That one is in portrait mode and is a full RPG. You might check out that but I believe it's gonna be hardware intensive and take up some room  Hero emblems is a perfect mix of some of those requirements -- it's a puzzle RPG which I don't normally like but it's done very well.   Kingsroad is Diablo like and really fun -- gear customization and kind of got that MMORPG feel  Wayward souls is a rogue like RPG that's fun and got some customization elements. It seems rather simple but it's quite challenging and kinda vintage   Without going into detail some others I like - space marshals, evoland, magicka, shattered planet, heroes and castles 2, battle heart legacy, infinity blade 3"

Why not keep the timer and permit the user to either watch ads or buy more if they want more lives right then? Why does it have to be one or the other?  Most of us who play it casually don't mind the timer, and those that are on a binge usually can handle an ad or two, or can fork over the $10 for unlimited lives."

iosgaming,39jtdt,akshaun,3,Fri Jun 12 20:41:14 2015 UTC,"You are why we can't have nice things.  Capitals isn't making them any money.  They want to keep the app running, so they are trying different things to find something that works.  Upgraded.  Not going to complain one bit about ads in a FREE game."
iosgaming,39jtdt,JMowery,3,Fri Jun 12 19:32:38 2015 UTC,"This is just to inform other players of the updates so I'm not sure why this makes me a bad guy.   David Marsh, the cofounder of NimbleBits wrote a Guest Editorial for Touch Arcade, a year ago, titled ""Ads Suck!"" arguing that Opt-In Ads are the way to go. By removing the timer from Capitals, the ads are no longer ""Opt-In"" since the player can no longer progress without watching the ads. I never said that they shouldn't make money. This decision is just a huge departure from their previous (and largely successful) games."

iosgaming,39jr9n,edhere,1 point,Fri Jun 12 19:42:30 2015 UTC,"Thank you, Ed.

iosgaming,39gu9r,Robadoba,5,Fri Jun 12 01:49:40 2015 UTC,"Finally!  I've been wanting this to come to iOS for 2 years!  Had $5 in AppStore credit I was going to drop this weekend on Spartan Strike, but this game is priority.  Supergiant delivered a game above and beyound before, Bastion and I've only heard better reviews for Transistor."
iosgaming,39gu9r,wojovox,6,Thu Jun 11 18:54:35 2015 UTC,Bastion is my favorite game.  How similar is this?
iosgaming,39gu9r,IClogToilets,5,Thu Jun 11 20:57:42 2015 UTC,"It's a bit less action-like than Bastion because you can stop time and plan out your moves. You can also collect and combine components in your loadout, allowing you to deeply customize your battle style. It's more of an RPG in that regard, but it's still very good."
iosgaming,39gu9r,MysticKirby,4,Thu Jun 11 21:51:08 2015 UTC,"Holy crap, this title is absolutely amazing. How have I never heard of this? I loved Bastion but this feels even better."

iosgaming,39gu9r,Deeliciousness,2,Fri Jun 12 06:34:01 2015 UTC,"I guess the biggest thing I'm worried about is, does it use a virtual joystick to control movement?"
iosgaming,39gu9r,Vardermir,6,Fri Jun 12 07:31:17 2015 UTC,"You have an option to switch to a virtual joystick (called classic controls), but by default it is touch based control. Touch an area of the screen and you move there, very responsive."
iosgaming,39gu9r,Deeliciousness,4,Fri Jun 12 08:20:59 2015 UTC,"I took a chance and bought it last night.  I played for about an hour on my iPad Air 2.  There are two main control modes:  The default iPad and ""classic.""  Here's a rundown:  In default mode, you ""point-and-click"" to both move and attack.  There is a skills menu on the right side of the screen that lists your four current skills. Only one skill is selected at any given time.  If you click on an enemy, you move into range to attack (if not close enough) and then then execute the currently selected skill (I think you can also attack by just pressing the selected skill).  In ""TURN"" mode, you queue up you attacks and movements, Fallout 3 style.  In classic mode, you use your left thumb to move a ""virtual stylus.""  The stylus moves with your thumb, so it doesn't matter how you position your hands.  You attack by pressing skill buttons on the right side of the screen.  I found ""classic controls"" to be more useful, as I like to play holding the iPad in both hands.  It also made selecting movement in TURN mode easier.   I didn't find control issues to impact my enjoyment of the game.  Tonight, I'm going to try playing default iPad controls with a stylus.  I think that would be easier than point-clicking with my finger."

And here's a cool trick - if you f-ed up on a level and died, before clicking back to the home screen, exit bloons and shut down the app from memory (double click, swipe up).  You'll return to the beginning of the round.  Both are great games."

Oh, and prepare to lose a lot in DD, if that's something you're alright with."

iosgaming,395j7a,Nesvand,1 point,Tue Jun 9 16:00:21 2015 UTC,Which really is sad because RR and RR2 were such monumental games when they came out. Then EA bought Firemint and we got this.
iosgaming,395j7a,NickyNichols,5,Tue Jun 9 16:05:31 2015 UTC,"Exactly. I love my local developers in Australia, and would go to great lengths to support their work, but RR3 was a monstrosity of hubris and unethical game design, making it impossible to support in any way."
iosgaming,395j7a,Nesvand,7,Tue Jun 9 16:26:34 2015 UTC,It was ok. I mean I was jailbroken and I got away with currency hacks and it was actually an enjoyable game. Without currency hacks though it's nearly impossible to complete without a complete lack of anything else to do. I just bought my way through the game. Nowadays though it's spectacular all except for IAP related stuff. They actually focus on decent Motorsports rather than bullshit like nascar. So all in all it's an excellent game with a shitty way of completing it.
iosgaming,395j7a,Basul787,5,Tue Jun 9 19:53:39 2015 UTC,Exactly. These people play freemium games without IAP hacks? Lol.
iosgaming,395j7a,TNAEnigma,5,Tue Jun 9 21:48:49 2015 UTC,"I think the point is that 1) not everyone is jailbroken/rooted 2) if you need to use IAP hacks to get enjoyment out of a game, then game is horribly designed. Some of the concepts are workable - waiting a nominal time for repairs, etc gives the game more of a simulation-like edge - but by the time you make any significant progress you're given no option but to wait, and there (was at the time i reviewed it) no reasonable way to offset it with skill; only money made a difference. The micropayment model they used was horrific."
iosgaming,395j7a,Nesvand,1 point,Wed Jun 10 03:08:55 2015 UTC,"Oh I totally agree, the game is not possibly enjoyable without IAP hacks. But it's really fun with them."

Then you get to the economic side. It's freemium game. What the fuck do you expect. It's a great game for the content. I am more then aware not everyone is jailbroken by the way.
iosgaming,395j7a,Basul787,0,Wed Jun 10 05:55:52 2015 UTC,"""Fantastic game"" implies it can be played. This is not the case without hacks or spending an obscene amount of money. It has ""fantastic potential"". ""Freemium"" implies you get more out of the game for spending money in it - that doesn't apply here because you either pay, hack, or stare at a counter that places you further and further away from playing."
iosgaming,395j7a,Nesvand,2,Wed Jun 10 08:06:21 2015 UTC,Yeah I caught a buddy of mine playing real racing 3. Wasnt hacking. Helped him out and loaded my gamesave into his game. He instantly enjoyed it so much better.

It has elements of an endless runner with some shooter aspects. It also has power ups, bosses, a leveling system, and a leaderboard! While I'm not a huge fan of ads or IAP, Project Oswald does have both, but I feel we're really generous with both. For the ads, you only have to watch one every 10 runs. There are 3 different IAPs: remove ads, additional game modes, and additional Oswald appearances. Each are $0.99 but you can get all 3 for $1.99.  I welcome any feedback, suggestions, or comments.

That being said I hope it still works fine as it hasn't been updated in awhile.   Implosion, Never Lose Hope - holy poop this is amazing, No IAP. You'll really enjoy this, I highly recommend it.  Heroes and Castles 2 - Ok this is a little different from what you're asking but it has all the elements you want plus more. Highly recommend it and you don't need to purchase any IAP and all it does is make the game easier but smart thinking and play makes its useless.

iosgaming,38ufdp,PlumberODeth,5,Sun Jun 7 01:07:50 2015 UTC,"Well, if you're a fan, start with what makes the games you like stand out from the forest of other 3D shooters.  You play enough games and you know when you pick up something new if it's a rehash of the same old thing, a twist on an old theme, or something that tries to rewrite part of the genre.  Not every game can/should these things, it's more how they fit and if people are interested in that fit.  It really is how you stand out.  There are tons upon tons of games in the store, some good that never get noticed because they bring nothing really interesting to the table others briefly popular by their sometimes contrived new gimmick.  I'd assume doing the legwork and finding something that's both unique and fun to make as well as play is at least half the battle of creating a game."

iosgaming,38ufdp,09stibmep,1 point,Sun Jun 7 18:37:40 2015 UTC,"You can absolutely do what you love. Just don't dump a lot of money into it, unless it's something that the users couldn't get elsewhere, or if you're just rich and don't give a fuck. If you're going to make it mainly because it's fun, just go crazy, but use shitty cheap graphics instead."
iosgaming,38ufdp,_invalidusername,10,Sun Jun 7 23:58:41 2015 UTC,"The truth is that unless you spend years, you simply won't be able to compete with other successful iOS shooters. Focus on an original simple idea, something unique that you are able to build in a few months."
iosgaming,38ufdp,CurtisLeow,4,Sun Jun 7 00:37:42 2015 UTC,"Pretty cool you're able to make that in 2 days. I wouldn't know where to begin.  First two seconds my thoughts ran as: pretty great sound, and pretty great gun model, kind of a counter strike thing going on. But my thoughts turned from there to man you have a long way to go, and like others have said, are you sure you want to play with the big boys on this.  Like others are saying, and as I've observed from what I've seen, if you're a small developer, and original concept will get you further. Despite how abstract it is, if it's original and you can get some blogs / forums chanting about the uniqueness, you'll get some downloads on that. Otherwise, (and I don't do shooters so grain of salt for this one), this will be another shooter not by gameloft or whoever has the monopoly.  Hate to discourage you, but I'm actually encouraging you at the same time! Concept up something different (FPS Is pretty hard for that though)."
iosgaming,38ufdp,scopa0304,4,Sun Jun 7 02:06:40 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the comment! I appreciate it a lot :) Also, I just downloaded the 3D models off the internet until, if I will finish this, I get custom models or buy some. I will try to think of ways to make this unique. :) If there is anything you (or anybody else) thinks would be cool, just tell me and if I like it I can make it :D"
iosgaming,38ufdp,Aaimsworth,3,Sun Jun 7 02:30:56 2015 UTC,"If you want to make it primarily for fun, carry on, even if you don't ever finish it, you'll have learnt a lot.  If you are doing it to make money, spend a little time working out realistically how much it will cost you to make, how long it will take, and how much you can expect to earn.  In my opinion, if this is your first game I wouldn't do an FPS. Unity makes it seem really easy to get things going at the start, but you will soon realize what a big task it is. Animation, path finding, AI, textures, level design, GUI, optimization, visual fx, inventory etc... all take a lot of time to do right"
iosgaming,38ufdp,i010011010,3,Sun Jun 7 12:30:06 2015 UTC,"Dang, now it seems like so much fun work (especially path finding o_o). This isn't my first game though, I have created some other games such as Armed Combat, but I know what you're saying. All these people telling me to do something different makes me think I should but I have no clue what to make :/ That would be cool if we created a community project together as a reddit group, something simple though, but fun :)"

iosgaming,38tgxy,FatherGenesis,2,Sun Jun 7 01:15:55 2015 UTC,"There's six classes, each with their own play style (some more unique than others), and stories for each class.  The game's difficult enough that you won't be able to blast through it in a few sittings, but not so difficult that you'll want to toss your device out a window.  While I'm unsure of its replayability (a few people have sworn by it, though)...  it should keep you occupied for some time."

iosgaming,38tgxy,KiroBird,3,Sat Jun 6 19:15:44 2015 UTC,"Dungeon Raid is a puzzle rpg. There are different classes and races with their pros and cons, as well as some other customizable options. The game's a couple years old but I've been playing this game since it came out. Check out the lite version.  As for games you're looking at:  *Wayward Souls- It's skill based and you'll need patience. There is a lot of replayability due to unlockable dungeons and classes as well as collectable hats.   *Deep Dungeons of Doom- It requires some learning and reflexes, but it's pretty casual. You unlock different classes, skill trees, and gear, but I didn't find much replay value. The first playthrough is fun, but then the game becomes very easy and the rest seems like a chore.  *Knights of Pen and Paper: The humor is okay but not that great. Battle is very repetitive and there's no replayability."
iosgaming,38tgxy,09stibmep,2,Sun Jun 7 01:26:49 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the heads up, maybe I'll look at some other options before i pick up knights if pen and paper. Maybe the second one that came out recently is better?"
iosgaming,38tgxy,atrophex,1 point,Sun Jun 7 05:37:15 2015 UTC,"I've heard the second one still has the same issues and the devs tried too hard with the humor. Here's the release date discussion. The first one does have a new game+ but I wouldn't consider that replayability as it's the exact same thing with higher levels. And also, Wayward Souls is an action rpg but not hack and slash and DDD isn't turn based."
iosgaming,38tgxy,asn9,2,Sun Jun 7 06:43:57 2015 UTC,"The first one also had more content patched in, maybe that will happen for the second as well so maybe hold off until that happens? :)"

iosgaming,38tgxy,Shenanigansgoingonev,1 point,Mon Jun 8 19:08:51 2015 UTC,"I don't have an iphone, no idea sorry"
iosgaming,38tgxy,Shenanigansgoingonev,4,Mon Jun 8 19:29:54 2015 UTC,"You would probably like 10000000. It's a match 3 game, combined with a real time dungeon run. It has some replayability, but you can beat it pretty easily, and then there are no more upgrades, etc, so while you can replay it for a high score, it feels less replayable than saw a bejeweled.  But the new one from that guy is out now, and it's supposedly a bigger/better version of the same thing. i think it's called You Must Build a Boat.  Puzzle games: You would probably like Folt. Simple clean aesthetic. Every time you move, you drop a colored tile behind you (you can see the order of the colors coming up), and you clear the tiles by matching 3. It's kind of like snake meets match 3. Solid logic puzzle, but not too hard, and you create your own path to beat the puzzle (not like there's just one possible solution).  There's also inethack2, which is the port of the 1987 roguelike for ios. But there's a real learning curve and i think you need to like read the online instructions. But for someone into roguelikes it's probably interesting?  Wow, I never hear anyone talk about Puzzlejuice. Wasn't expecting it from the person with ""timed"" ""word games"" on their don'ts list :)"
iosgaming,38tas1,Couldbegigolo,3,Sat Jun 6 17:06:45 2015 UTC,"You might like my game, Five-O. It's basically Scrabble with numbers instead of letters. Online games are turn-based and there are lots of players so you'll have no trouble finding matches. It also has single player vs the computer."
iosgaming,38tas1,codevandal,2,Sat Jun 6 20:24:44 2015 UTC,"I can vouch for this game. I mostly play against the computer and it offers enough of a challenge that I don't get bored. I really like the simplicity of it and the restrictions (no more than five tiles in a sequence, all sequences must add up to a multiple of five) make it more appealing than Scrabble for me and adds some challenge. It's also a lot easier to convince people to play since adding small numbers is less intimidating than challenging one's lexicon!  There's another one by the above commenter that's a puzzle game based on the same premise. I play it all the time and it's great for killing time while in line for things or laying around watching the world go by."

The whole point of the name is that it's 3D libraries that are ""close to the metal (the hardware)"" which means improved performance and efficiency compared with third party rendering libraries. Yes you can think of this as being able to ""make things look better"", for the same computational load, but that's not really the point.   It's like writing a game in Java vs C. C is closer to the metal and typically performs better as a result.   Metal is another OpenGL or direct3d, or unity, except that apple designed the chip it runs on, and can make it as efficient as possible as a result."

iosgaming,38j3mv,voxl,3,Thu Jun 4 19:23:24 2015 UTC,"Yes   the big change in the gameplay comes from a small but significant change to the mechanics. In the previous game, you couldn't do anything while pieces were settling after a match. You had to wait for everything to fall into place before you took any other actions. This time around, you don't have to wait. You can keep on matching even while pieces are clearing out and collapsing. In fact, you really must get the hang of this mechanic before too long. It increases the pace of the game quite a bit, making the game feel more hectic and action-packed than its predecessor."

You can however still emulate by going to the IEmulate site and finding the links to provenance and gameplay colour. They do have certificates that are valid at the moment and I am playing Pokemon for free on 8.3. If you need help installing them watch the tutorials by the youtuber OperationIDroid.

Now, Hitman is the only franchise I am a diehard fan of, so I was going to buy this anyway. First impressions:   Very slightly laggy on iPhone 5. I may be wrong about it. Load times aren't exactly great. Nothing to worry about. Like the core Hitman games (and GO), it is preferable to kill people without alerting other people (more points!). So you watch and see people's walking patterns to figure out when someone is NOT in anyone's line of sight. There is ""tagging"" like in Far Cry 3, where if you focus on someone with your scope, you'll be able to track their position even when not zoomed in, or when they are hidden behind stuff or darkness. Unlike core Hitman games, killing extra people (guards, actually) rewards you (so far for me, at least). I like the ""gunplay"", or whatever you want to call it. It is clearly the result of a lot of testing. Zooming in/out, panning, shooting and steadying your breath are all very natural and don't interfere with each other. I guess this is a given for a big studio's game, but I'm really pleased with it anyway.   AMA, I guess?"
iosgaming,38hio5,i010011010,1 point,Thu Jun 4 20:26:09 2015 UTC,Any IAP?
iosgaming,38hio5,i010011010,1 point,Thu Jun 4 20:43:14 2015 UTC,"Yes. Out of the 14 (15?) rifles, 3 can be purchased with real money.  Long answer:  As far as I see you normally rise in level and earn in-game money for doing hits, and better weapons unlock at higher levels and you can buy most of the guns with that money. The IAP just lets you buy some guns (they were roughly #3, #8, #12 in order) right off the bat.  FWIW, I don't think it's too bad, unlocking weapons is pretty easy, and it's not like they make you grind to unlock them. How balanced the grind-vs-pay balance is should become clear as more people play it. I have faith mostly since GOs IAPs were nicely done."
iosgaming,38hio5,i010011010,1 point,Thu Jun 4 20:51:39 2015 UTC,"Well, personally it's the principle of charging $5 for an app then trying to inflate it with IAP.  It's double dipping: choose one and only one payment model.  I'm not going to buy a commercial app just so they can try to sell me on stuff.  And if they already have IAP at launch, I expect they're willing to add more later."
iosgaming,38hio5,contentBat,5,Thu Jun 4 20:55:54 2015 UTC,"I have heard this many times. Lots of apps abuse the IAP system, and I steer clear of them. It's reasonable in some cases, and I'm willing to pay for them. Apps don't become untouchable just because they are paid AND have IAPs.  I haven't paid for IAPs other than Monument Valley's update. I won't be doing it here either, since I can (and will) unlock similar guns pretty easy."
iosgaming,38hio5,HoChiFlynn,2,Thu Jun 4 21:01:49 2015 UTC,It would be reasonable (in my opinion) if three months from now they released a new set of levels and expected a one time $3-$5 unlock.  I.e. an expansion pack.  I would gladly buy IAP if it were only used this way.  I wish more of my favorite games would add content and let me pay them for it.

iosgaming,38fv82,I_RATE_YOUR_BEWBS,7,Wed Jun 3 23:03:10 2015 UTC,"I've been looking for a serious, deep, challenging and replayable mobile game for as long as I've had a smartphone. I seriously still look, every few days on both the App Store and on Google Play (I am an Android phone person but I play games mostly on my iPad), and I rarely come up with anything that I really feel is worth playing.  There are some good puzzle-games (like I mean, things that you solve) and word games are ok, and there's a few other things that are good too, but by and large, whenever I try out something that looks like it's going to be a deep, strategic thing, I'm almost always let down (shoutout to Outwitters as one of my favorite exceptions).  So many mobile games - especially once that have decent production values, like nice art and music - are these free-to-play things that are SUPER random, have in-app purchases everywhere, and TONS and tons of chaff content. I've been playing games for too long to tolerate most of that stuff at this point. I understand the appeal, but I personally am no longer content to just mash the screen and wait for good dice rolls.  I've always wanted there to be a thing, like a little machine, and you can put in decisions, and you get back reliable feedback. Something that's purely skill-based, but that isn't like, ""ENTER THE CORRECT ANSWER"". I wanted something that would allow me to overcome challenges, but that would let me use creativity in how I do it. Like, I wanted to use ingenuity, rather than just... brute force thinking, if that makes any sense.  Anyway, that's what we've been trying to do with Auro for the past... nearly five years now. Based on the reviews it has been getting (91% on Metacritic) and people's personal testimonies, as well as our own experience of just seriously LOVING this game so much (we play it every day, for years now), I feel like we've done at least an OK job (although we still have a way to go). But really: Auro is just this little machine that is 100% about YOUR decisions. There's nothing else, it's just you, a bunch of tools, and a goal. How are you going to make it happen?  The thing is, Auro is a lot to take in at once. It's a lot of rules and they're not always SUPER intuitive - in short, it's kinda like one of those designer board games. You have to do some learning and up front, it's can be a little annoying. Also, worse yet, people have grown accustomed to VERY VERY low barriers of entry for mobile games. So I think because of that, a lot of players - even I think some players who ultimately would want something like what Auro is - get turned off before they get to that point.  A few months ago we got this idea to do this big mode that would allow players to ""feel their way out"" a bit more. Something that you can kind of ""play with"" more - something a bit more sandboxy, a bit more RPG-ey, etc. I feel like if you play something like Spelunky, or FTL, or even Civilization, you get a bit more of a ""play-with"" feeling... like you can ""try out"" stuff that isn't necessarily directly related to some singular goal. You have more room to make mistakes and just mess around in general.  We don't have all the details for Quest Mode exactly lined up yet, but basically we want to have an overmap that's randomly generated, and at each little ""node"" you get different encounters. Item shops, story encounters, rare special events, things like that. And also way more crazy, silly spells that are just kinda ""dumb-fun"".   Actually, Quest Mode is a bit more like X-Com. You have the ""missions"" where you sort of play the game, and then you have the overmap, where you make meta-game decisions.  So Quest Mode still won't be what I kinda hate about mobile gaming - it won't have IAPs all over the place and it will still have strong core gameplay. But on the other hand, it will be easier for players to pick up. It will start small, and you'll unlock things as you go (just from playing - and no, you can't pay to unlock things faster. We might even add a ""unlock everything"" button in the options). Point is: the barrier for entry should be smaller.  I'm really psyched about Quest Mode, and we really hope we get to make it. I think Auro is a special little kind of machine and it deserves to reach more people. There aren't enough mobile games out there that really care about player decisions. Auro is 100% that and basically 0% anything else. So yeah. I think we're one of the good guys. I hope people will see that, and want to support what we're doing, even if they aren't personally that crazy about Auro specifically.  Thanks for posting about this, /u/I_RATE_YOUR_BEWBS. And thanks for reading!"

iosgaming,38c2ow,Choooooch,21,Wed Jun 3 06:43:45 2015 UTC,Guys this is an exact port from the PC version. I don’t get how you complain about the price. People buy games from steam at around $60 yet no one complains. I understand this is mobile gaming but this is one of the reasons all those F2P energy bull is still around.  Trial? Heck watch the youtube videos. I’m pretty sure that would satisfy your needs. You could always ask for a refund if you don’t like an app.  I bought the app with no regrets. Truly a well polished game!! Well worth more than those measly 10 bucks it asked for.   Not your cup of tea? Don’t buy it then.
iosgaming,38c2ow,julesantenor,4,Wed Jun 3 12:25:05 2015 UTC,"People like to talk about what they want but hate having to pay for it. The toxicity of the market is on developers and consumers. We can't have better games on the store without a justifying price. Unfortunately, Sproggiwoods will under perform and probably be another statistic about why paid games are failing, despite that having nothing to do about quality, and everything to do about the race the bottom and price anchoring."
iosgaming,38c2ow,fandangalo,3,Wed Jun 3 12:40:38 2015 UTC,.
iosgaming,38c2ow,craydog,1 point,Wed Jun 3 16:23:50 2015 UTC,"Definitely an important part about the conversation as well. Games on phones should not be console experiences, and trying to make a game that is that tends to be a failure.  It's particularly not the same market because the session lengths are different. Phones = 5 minutes; iPads = 30 minutes; console = hour or more; PC = multiple hours.  As a lover of the gameboy/DS lines, it's been really interesting to watch their evolution, because things like Link's Awakening are very much on-the-go console experiences done right, but there was also Tetris, which was a toilet game.  But, like you've noted, the controls and player interface change the dynamics of what's intuitive and comfortable, along with some assumptions about player literacy, and for Nintendo's mobile, they've been able to deliver more profound experiences because there's more options of interaction available for developers with a more thoughtful audience. Mobile has neither, really, because its much more of a mass market."
iosgaming,38c2ow,fandangalo,-2,Wed Jun 3 17:38:03 2015 UTC,"At $9.99 if 1% of iOS users buy the game, they stand to make $15M (iPad) or $53M (IPad+iPhone).   For steam they sell it at $15. Which @ 1% of player base would mean $11M.   However at a $9.99 price point they are not likely to get a larger percentage of users. If they dropped to $0.99 and got 10% of the market they would be looking at around $13-14M.   So the ability to make more profit on Apple App Store means they can offer a much reduced price to the end user. They also have the benefit of making it easier to debug (same environment for everyone) and asset reuse from the PC game.   Then you also have that baselines for consumers have already been set, and it is only PC porting games that tend to try and push that price up closer to PC prices (eg. Xcom, FF series). While native AAA games tend to be a lot cheaper and better quality (eg. Asphalt8, Storm gamblers).   ....   After watching the gameplay, while cute isn't worth the price point vs existing games on the AppStore. Except maybe for hardcore genre players."
iosgaming,38c2ow,contentBat,4,Wed Jun 3 19:42:26 2015 UTC,"I have been debating getting this game on my 6 +. Not because of the price, but because I am not sure if it will truly interest me. I don't want to pay that much for a game and then end up not playing it. But if it's something I will enjoy and have fun with, I'll gladly pay that much and for no IAP to boot.   I've watched YT videos but I just can't decide. I've never actually played a Rogue like game and generally go for games in the RPG, Open-World, Simulation, and Adventure genres.   I don't have too many games in my 6 +, I generally game on PC, but of the ones I do have are: Grim Fandango, GTA: San Andreas, Seabeard (which I enjoy but hate the IAP), The Detail, SimCity, Banner Saga, 80 Days, Sorcery! 2, etc.   Should I just go for it? I've truly watched videos of this game in action and I still cannot decide. It looks great but I just don't know if I will like it.   Cheers."
iosgaming,38c2ow,JoeFabooche,3,Wed Jun 3 19:34:17 2015 UTC,"I have the game on my 6+ and it's a perfect form factor for this game. Within the settings you can toggle tablet or smartphone interface, and with the 6+'s size, the tablet format works perfectly. Looking at the games you've mentioned, I'd have to say we have very similar tastes in games; recently Sorcery! and Banner Saga has been monopolizing my gaming time. I had yet to play a rogue like game before this one too (the combat in Banner Saga is vaguely rogue like now that I think about it). Honestly, if you watch gameplay on YouTube and you think you'll enjoy it, and your gaming tastes are even remotely similar to mine, you'll probably love this game."
iosgaming,38c2ow,JoeFabooche,3,Wed Jun 3 23:34:06 2015 UTC,"Hmmm. I will give it some more thought and check out a few more videos of gameplay. Thanks!   I am not much of a mobile gamer.

iosgaming,38c2ow,Phanners,3,Thu Jun 4 01:30:29 2015 UTC,"Thanks for making this thread!  I'd never heard of this game until I saw this. For some reason it looked compelling, and after watching the gameplay video someone else linked to, I decided to take the plunge and buy it (very rare for me).   So totally worth it, I'm in love with this game.  It's got the fun and engaging gameplay of a rogue like, but it's a bit more forgiving with letting you keep your coins when you die, and being able to buy weapons/armor you've found for use in later dungeons any time you want. The graphics are cute, but I like that, haha.   Tl;dr already convinced it was $10 well spent. If it's not your type of game that's cool, but there's a lot to love about it and it's extremely well done."

So you're actually getting the same quality of game, but on mobile, for cheaper.

The difference on battery between max and min brightness is night and day. You can get 2-3x as much battery by playing on lower brightness.

It has three levels, a couple of pilots and rockets to unlock with in-game currency. No IAPs. Ads are shown every 3 deaths (intervals should also be > 5 minutes, but that doesn't work apparently), but I'm planning to make some changes in the future, since it's unfair for new players.

iosgaming,37wk5q,NfsJake,3,Sun May 31 12:34:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah. Right now I'm playing one called Ash Grey- it's a mod that takes you through the events of the first run of the Pokemon Anime. EG: At the beginning of the game you get attacked by swarm of Spearows, run away on a bike, and see a Ho-Oh fly over you. Stuff like that.  Other notable ones are Flora Sky (it's the prettiest), Pokemon Brown (A mod of the original GBC games), Liquid Crystal (By all accounts, the most polished one- it's a remake of Crystal like Heart Gold and Soul silver), and Light Platinum (Haven't played it, but people speak highly of it).  I don't want to link to any roms, but a google search can get you what you need."
iosgaming,37wk5q,snealiv,2,Sun May 31 14:38:26 2015 UTC,I would suggest Pokemon snake wood as well. It's a different spin on the games but it's a great story though the gameplay isn't as great.

WARNING: i love and hate this game. Ive been playing for about 8 months now, and while you can achieve a lot without paying real money, it will require a lot of patience and dedication, but certain items will still be limited only to spenders.

They demanded $1 games, then they bitched that $1 was a ripoff.  They left 1 star reviews if the game didn't clean their house, feed the dog and give them a reacharound.  Then came timers.  Then came IAP. The market ate it up. 5 star reviews, and enough money to keep making games.  The end.  Pissing and moaning won't do anyone any good.  If you didn't want this, you (collectively) should have supported the pay-once (and pay a rational amount) model when it was first tried.    Now?  No one cares.  Honestly if you want to play a ""good"" game, get off iOS.  its not the place for it.  Sure, some great little experiences appear every once in a while, then those studios lose their shirt and never return.  If you want to play a real game, go literally anywhere else but mobile.

I make it a habit to only buy games that you pay for first, and have value in the initial content and if it does have IAP those purchases better add extra levels (like monument Valley) or add other features (like photo filters and stuff but NOT related to ""gems"" or ""timer mechanics"")  I know I'm Sadly in the minority.

iosgaming,37n7om,quantumproductions_,3,Sat May 30 05:25:27 2015 UTC,"IMO the best IOS games are ports- simply because they weren't designed around that IAP model. XCOM, KOTOR, Monster Hunter Freedome Unite, The Walking Dead, Final Fantasy 3, FF Tactics, San Andreas, Banner Saga, Bastion- All some of the best iOS games- all of them ports.  I wouldn't say you need to get off iOS per se- but encouraging devs to port to iOS is a good start. And for god sakes, stop encouraging this FTP bullshit. If you don't like timers then dont download those games- don't encourage them. If you do download it without knowing- give it a one star review and stay away from that dev in the future.  That's basically the only way mobile gaming will improve. Demand quality, speak with your wallet and don't tolerate shitty games and timers."

Once they've tried the game for free, let them choose between sticking with the IAP+timer laden version or pay the couple bucks for it outright.  They don't give us the option because they like it this way.  It wasn't the players who drove them to it--it was the pursuit of profiteering because they all idolized Zynga and their ilk.  The thought of being paid infinite dollars for the zero effort function of changing a variable gives every developer a giant hard on."

iosgaming,37n7om,BryLoW,7,Fri May 29 21:18:30 2015 UTC,"Timers were added because most companies discovered that retention improved with timers. There's a saying from the fun deconstructer, ""If I let you eat all the cake today, you won't come back tomorrow for more.""  If the stamina system is like ""Using card X spends X's stamina,"" then that's there to goat whales into paying, but pretty much the same cake concept.   Premium currency is to reduce friction at the point of sale. You'll think about the purchase more if the game asked you to spend 1.99 or something on everything, so to remove the out-of-game friction, premium currency is used. It also allows for more granularity in price control, along with not needing to update the IAP packaging IDs.   There's some different routes to success, and high daily active users or monthly active users is one way to reach that success. If the game is very fun, you'll be an organic grower for that, but if not, forced social mechanics tend to be better in the long run--even if it pisses off some people, you'll do better regardless, which is how most of this stuff works.   I don't know about the spyware stuff. Some companies collect big data because it's there and free to sell to advertisers. I'd assume most put it in the TOS, which no one reads.   Shameless? Dude, practically EVERYONE who works in this industry HATES that this stuff WORKS. Economically speaking, it makes sense why F2P exists, because it lowers the bar so every possible player could enter the game and experience it, but they can freely walk away whenever. On the flip side, to make this work, you have to be aggressive or your company dies. Paid games are extinct on the store because you can't carry a company on them--it does not work in the market place due to player and developer toxicity.  We're in a vicious cycle of players expecting the world at the lowest cost and developers making the world at the lowest cost, but with mechanics to drive the price up to something worthy of your development cost. IOS development is one of the hardest scenes to be in because none of your players really want to pay money for a toilet game experience. That was understandable when we first started making mobile apps and they were small and quick. But now people want to leverage this amazing (in size) population of players, but most don't give a shit about games. So, you follow in F2P schemas to survive, because making a game and asking for 4.99 will only leverage you game connoisseurs, like you and me, who make up the vocal minority, but are really not the target audience, because we're a minority. In the console market place, you're only 35% of the target audience, so I can only imagine it's worse on mobile.   Basically, this stuff isn't for you. Just like how Transformers aren't for people who love the art of cinema. IOS is a saturated marketplace with lots of toxicity on both sides, consumer and creator. There's economic forces for why F2P will stick. And this is just the beginning of the rabbit hole, because you can see where we're going in Asian markets, who have been doing F2P for 10 years. Nowadays, you can find a correlation in their games between sales and size of IAP packages and prices: if you're not offering 3K USD IAPs, you're doing it wrong.   So, just delete the game. Walk away. Play Auro or something that costs money. At worst, you just lost time. At least F2P doesn't cost a quarter to start."

iosgaming,37n7om,bakutogames,1 point,Fri May 29 03:56:37 2015 UTC,One of the one star reviews I saw while looking at the game's app store page summed things up nicely why it's not a good game.   This is a strategy game. I don't want to feel pressured to get it right the first try or two because that's the only amount of tries I get before I run out of stamina. That's just not fun in any way.   I'd much rather pay 5 or 10 bucks and get as many tries as I want to try out different methods and whatnot. Otherwise I might as well look up walkthroughs to do things as efficiently as possible right?

Buy them! Convince others to buy them! And this $1.99 price tag is devaluing people's hard work so expect to pay 5-15 for a good game.  Mobile sucks overall and the majority of users have entitlement issues leaving these shitty Skinner box games being the only profitable method.   (Something I refuse to do and reason I got out of mobile game dev).  But now these shitty methods are working on to the pc platform as well(wow being one large Skinner box and other games going to freemium methods) no one wants to pay anymore for anything until they are mentally addicted
iosgaming,37n7om,Flesh-PrinceofBelAir,8,Thu May 28 22:47:01 2015 UTC,"Timers in modern mobile games are usually used to replace long grinds in other games.  In a game where you might have spent 6 hours killing Boars in World of Warcraft, instead now you just wait 6 hours.    Game Developers make you wait, because they want the things you're collecting and doing to feel scarce and valuable.  You could replace the waiting with other things such as challenge (i.e hard to win battles) or luck (i.e. very rare drops), but the current state of affairs is that the mobile audience is would prefer waiting to grinding based on the metrics of the most successful games."

iosgaming,37n7om,Flesh-PrinceofBelAir,8,Fri May 29 00:00:05 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry it pisses you off, but the guy who has that upgrade finished already feels pretty good about it.  And the fact that you don't have it and are upset that you don't have is exactly my point.    There is something you don't have and you want it.  That's scarcity.  Would it be more satisfying to you if you could repeat a race 50 times to finish the upgrade?"
iosgaming,37n7om,xtagtv,3,Fri May 29 00:11:22 2015 UTC,"Not at all, but here's the deal. The upgrade already cost a bunch of in-game currency and some parts that you have to complete races to get. Upgrading stuff is already a chore, but it's a chore you finish just by playing the game like normal. Collecting (or purchasing) all that stuff and then being made to wait for 48 more hours (or pay) is just a kick in the teeth."
iosgaming,37n7om,ryachart,0,Fri May 29 11:08:36 2015 UTC,"I hear you on that. But another way to look at it is ""how fast does Mario run""? Mario could, arbitrarily, run 2x faster allowing you to play 2x as many levels, get 2x as many coins, 2x as many points etc in the same amount of gameplay time.  He doesn't, obviously, but if the developers sold a 2x Mario speed upgrade -- how is this different from waiting 12 hours?"
iosgaming,37n7om,xtagtv,3,Sat May 30 05:29:22 2015 UTC,"If you're trying to say that adding a 48 hour wait is anything but the developer bugging the user until they break down and pay, then I wholeheartedly disagree. Devs aren't trying to enhance my gaming experience by clogging their games with timers. They're trying to make me pay.  The thing is, I'd happily pay $5 to remove any and all timers from Trials Frontier or upwards of $15 for a completely de-freemium'd version."

iosgaming,37n7om,ryachart,2,Fri May 29 01:53:28 2015 UTC,They've always had a time gate.  Weekly lockouts to raids have always been a mechanic for World of Warcraft. Why don't the bosses just respawn every day? Or every 30 minutes?  It's because doing it once a week was what the devs though was right for that kind of content.

Unlike raiding, it is completely un-social, there is nothing ""fun"" or challenging about it, and it only serves the purpose of making you want to log in every few hours to collect your loot and start new orders.

Don't just look at screenshots and assume."

iosgaming,37n578,leshadowbanned69,2,Fri May 29 08:07:43 2015 UTC,"Desktop Dungeons came out today. Its kinda like a roguelike but very, very lite. It follows the same basic principle as games like Nethack or Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup but its simplified to the max giving you a nice experience if you just want to play a quick 5 minutes game instead of sinking hours into a Nethack game. I tried it on my iPad Air 2 and had some issues with it like small fonts in some places and they left some stuff from the PC version but overall I'd saw its worth trying. There's a demo for the PC version on their website you can try, its basically the same."
iosgaming,37n578,Infernal_pizza,3,Sat May 30 01:31:12 2015 UTC,I'm not sure if it's quite what you're looking for but you should give reaper a try! It has quite a few items although you buy them from the shop rather than finding them (not through IAPs or anything rubbish like that though) it involves loads of smashing up enemies (possibly could get a bit repetitive) and it has amazing graphics!  It's a paid app but you can play the first part for free so if you don't like it you haven't lost anything! (If you do like it I'd recommend just getting the full version that includes everything)

iosgaming,37n578,nxtboyIII,1 point,Sun May 31 14:07:31 2015 UTC,"Dungeon Quest - This is, in my opinion, The best ARPG on IOS.  Tons of levels, tons of skills, and a ridiculously large number of randomized items.  You progress extremely quickly due to leveling and loot drops being so frequent, but there's so much to work on that you can play for tens of hours and still be progressing quickly.  There are hundreds of legendary items to find, and a vast variety of feasible builds.  Best of all, it's completely free.  Looking at the IAPs you might think it's a freemium game, but none of them are at all necessary, and they'd ultimately end up cheapening the experience (the only ones you might need are to unlock additional character slots)."

iosgaming,37e2na,slithymonster,8,Wed May 27 03:55:07 2015 UTC,I'd have to say any of the Great Little/Big War Games
iosgaming,37e2na,BLG89,8,Tue May 26 23:51:49 2015 UTC,"Skulls of Shogun is pretty good too, it is inspired by Advanced Wars but it plays quite differently. There is no grid or hex in that game where each unit is limited by a fixed radius on where they can travel. It is hard counter based like cavalry counters swords mans, archer counters cavalry and so on.  There is a really entertaining story mode and also a decent AI that offers good challenge. It is set in a unique Japanese Samurai after-life setting.  If you have the game on PC, you can play the game on both iOS and PC as the save files can be transferred from one system to another. The UI is very well designed where it plays well on a touch screen, mouse and also a gamepad.   Alternatively, Uniwar is really good too. It is much more similar to Advanced wars.  Never really like Great Little/Big War Games, the maps are generally too narrow and it gets really spammy."
iosgaming,37e2na,Cheesenium,5,Wed May 27 04:00:15 2015 UTC,"Front wars.  Though hot tip, just go to the AppStore and type in advance wars and see what results you get. Plenty of games made in the vein of advance wars. None in my opinion quite nailing it though, ha. There is supposed to be another advance wars inspired game in development now and due out soon I think, just can't remember the name.  Others more in the general war tbs genre worth a mention would be  Open panzer Battle of the bulge Ravenmark Iwesnoth"

iosgaming,37e2na,Alvonzo,5,Thu May 28 21:08:31 2015 UTC,i liked Ravenmark. there's a free lite version to test
iosgaming,37e2na,Soleone,3,Wed May 27 04:11:16 2015 UTC,"Front Wars looks pretty good, although I've never played it.  Mecho Wars does a good job putting in the Advance Wars feel, and is a fun game to beat, but it's unfortunately rather limited considering that it's only versus the AI (although that could have changed since I last played it).  Great Little War Game and its sequels are quite good too.  And I definitely endorse Uniwar too. Campaign does a great job teaching you the units, and after that you can do battles against the AI, against a friend locally, or against anyone online. The online portion is really well done - you can set up or join custom games against players or AI, have ranking that helps you match up against those of a similar skill level, make maps to play on with others or browse the custom maps repository, and even set time limits to a day or more for asynchronous play - great for taking turns whenever you get the time rather than play an entire match in one sitting."

Also different armour could let you have faster movement or faster regen health and more health.   Just try to make the game feel like the player is getting better by making his character have better guns and armour and cooler 'skins' on his weapons, by doing this, the player feels like he is achieving something and will come back to play so he can become better. (getting new armour and stuff)"

iosgaming,376qhi,altoid_trapezoid,4,Mon May 25 09:41:34 2015 UTC,"This is an interesting question. I can't think of many games that explicitly demonstrate the economies of scale. Even economics-heavy games like space trading simulators and tycoon/management games tend to scale the price of goods linearly. I think, from a games design perspective, this is done partly to simplify the player experience, and partly to maintain a consistent difficulty.  There are a few exceptions that come to mind:   Games with player-managed economies, such as EVE Online, may feature players deliberately pricing goods in a real-world fashion. Unfortunately, this is not a classroom-friendly example, because games like EVE have a very steep learning curve. It's not a phone game, and it's a pretty weak example, but in modern Pokemon games, buying 10 pokeballs at once will result in the cashier throwing in an extra one in for free. The vast majority of freemium games (Clash of Clans, Candy Crush Saga, whatever) have pricing plans that look something like: ""$1 - 5 gems. $5 - 30 gems. $50 - 500 gems"". Some games make it very clear how much is ""saved"" by purchasing the more expensive packs."
iosgaming,376qhi,SketchyLogic,2,Mon May 25 17:48:42 2015 UTC,The freemium game example seems to be a great one - thank you! It's not perfect but it just might have to do.  And the pokemon one came to mind... but I don't think I can afford to get everybody Gameboys OR wait for them to be able to afford 10 pokeballs :)
iosgaming,376qhi,toochunky,2,Mon May 25 19:07:11 2015 UTC,"Ha ha, yes IAPs will teach an expensive lesson in economies of scale.  City building games like Game of War that rely on stockpiling resources to build things generally have in-game economies, with players trading resources for in-game currency. But it is not directly what the game is about, and probably requires too much time investment to start seeing the dynamics of the economy."
iosgaming,376qhi,onlinelurker,2,Tue May 26 00:07:50 2015 UTC,"not precisely a game, but bundled apps somewhat fit as example of the economies of scale, right? Instead of buying a single app or game for, say, $2.99, you can get an entire trilogy for only $6.99, or something like that."
iosgaming,376qhi,wowcomma,3,Tue May 26 11:10:23 2015 UTC,"As someone who took ap Econ and now is an Econ major I would like to thank you for trying to come up with an innovative lesson plan.    As far as games the freemium idea is good.  Something like a FarmVille clone might be able to teach this, but you might be better off using some other freemium game.  Some sort of endless runner (temple run/sonic dash, etc) would probably have ""boosts"" that are cheaper in bundles.  Good luck with the trip and lesson!"
iosgaming,376qhi,squid_lemon,2,Tue May 26 05:57:01 2015 UTC,"Of course! I'm just hoping to make this lesson a little more real.

If they're doing other wasteful things with our time, it's only going to hurt them in the long run. Same thing with laptops, and nearly half of my kids take notes on their laptop. I can always tell that some are tuning out, but if they can keep up their grades, I don't really mind.   I'm trying to pick an iOS game because I'm actually hoping to teach this lesson on a bus... we have a field trip to a huge printing company, whose tour is going to focus on economies of scale, and I'd like to let them experience it firsthand on the bus right before they arrive."
iosgaming,376qhi,MrHashish,2,Mon May 25 18:55:02 2015 UTC,"This game might be mildly inappropriate for school, but it is essentially a commodity trading game, with supply and demand changing based on your GPS location. You are straightforwardly competing with other players to move goods, so the dynamics of economies of scale should be apparent. It's not the greatest game in the world though, and there is nothing directly about economies of scale, so a bus trip might not be enough to guarantee the lesson comes across. A few days fooling around with the game would probably make it apparent though."

It also has different worlds to explore, from water worlds to jungle worlds and as in worlds I mean as travel able planets.  Lastly, it has regular updates from the devs. Junk Jack X was released I think like 3 years ago and still has a strong community and regular updates.

It is smaller but depending on your hand size this may or may not matter. I have slightly larger hands I'm told and it doesn't bug me.  I love it because I pair the controller to my phone, then airplay my phone to my appletv and it's like having a small gaming console on the fly. Some lag for higher FPS games like GTA SA but having a decent router like the new AC Airport extreme helps that too."

iosgaming,36zx65,Remk0h,1 point,Sat May 23 21:49:03 2015 UTC,"It's a fun game with many features like earning more cards through the arena, upgrading items, controlling your avatar and progressing through maps. Basics are explained well enough at the beginning, making it easy to pick up.  As of yet I'm still to find a real challenge, but I'm not far into the game yet. I'm sure I can get stuck eventually. No absurd iAP popups or anything, which is a good thing.  Putting equipment on avatar and ugrading cards works smooth enough and early on the timers are not high. Later you can plan the timers with your daily activities so you wont feel like you are waiting for them to be finished.  Will continue to play for a bit :)"
iosgaming,36zx65,xcitu,1 point,Sun May 24 14:33:31 2015 UTC,"Yay - thanks for the kind words!  Yeah, so for veteran TD players the beginning is a bit easy, but it does get more and more challenging. And how your explained timers is exactly how we planned them, so if you plan your day, maybe upgrade your most important card during the night, then you won't have to keep waiting on something. Also, again with the card upgrade timers, you can during that time try different strategies with other cards. And with the energy, the arenas only consume arena tickets (not energy) so those can be played when waiting for energy, same with the tournament, it can be played once a day without it consuming any energy."

iosgaming,36zx65,Thomadaneau,3,Sat May 23 16:58:32 2015 UTC,"I've been playing this fairly solid since Thursday.  Love the concept and the monetization is not extreme.  Quick question and a suggestion:  Is there a way to use the premium currency to buy cards (random or not) or card packs? I haven't come across it yet but I have been unlocking random new things (which, btw is something I love, there are new things to do the further you progress).   Suggestion: have more alternate pay real money for things. I saw the helm, sword and 500 crystals offer but set my phone down and it was gone by the time I came back. I'm not saying I want that particular limited time offer, but I don't see a need for more premium currency but there's nothing for me to buy to help me and to support you guys apart from a (rather expensive) random card pack that doesn't seem to appealing.   Anyways, love the game, keep up the good work!"
iosgaming,36zx65,Red__M_M,3,Sat May 23 17:58:16 2015 UTC,"Hey,  There's currently no way of buying card with premium currency, something we've been thinking about how to introduce it without breaking the game. We will introduce some new usage for gems though, totally get your point, not that much usage for it now. Also we'll look into other types of cards pack and multi-packs and so forth. This is really just the initial version we'll keep on working on.  We're already working on a bunch of new cool cards, enemies and levels :) we hope to support this game a really long time. We're all big big Tower Defense fans, but many of them have the problem they end just as you get started, it's not uncommon for TD games to have only 10-20 levels. Also with Crazy Kings we wanted to have a bit shorter sessions, for a mobile game you don't always have 20min to spend on a level, but that's also something we do want to add, some huge epic battles that take a long time (but you'll be aware of it before hand so you can choose when to play them).  Glad to hear you love the game, we've really put a lot of love into it!  PS. Getting late in Finland, but I'll be back on reddit first thing tomorrow!"
iosgaming,36zx65,2_0,1 point,Sat May 23 19:33:02 2015 UTC,"So I've been continuing to play this and still loving it. I am worried about a couple of things though.   Premium currency - no use for it. I have about 300 and no need to spend it on anything. You need as I mentioned before random card packs to buy (think hearthstone) or upgrades to be sped up beyond a few gates and card combo thing.  Challenge - I have had a couple of silver results but deep into the second island nothing that's really pressed me. If there were more challenging levels that gave me true challenge roadblocks I would be inclined to use more currency for character rezzes.   Lack of variety - this is weird, there's lots of cards, but I only have around 7 tower cards. Combine that with (currently) only two types of baddies (Minotaur and undead) and I don't really need to mix and match towers for differentlevels, nor could I though if I wanted to.  Anyways I really like it, I just want you guys to succeed so trying to offer my insights."
iosgaming,36zx65,2_0,1 point,Sat May 23 21:48:39 2015 UTC,"Thanks for taking the time to write the feedback! Super valuable for us to get feedback from real players! :)  Yeah, more use for premium currency would make sense for us and the players. Something we'll look into!  The game will get harder, it might be a bit too easy early on, we've tested it a lot, and getting a good balance so both newcomers and HC players have fun playing it has been a challenge, but we'll tune it better. But rest assured, it'll get more challenging later requiring you to really thing about your strategy. Also later levels will require different choice of cards(3rd world + the side quest island), but this is also something we'll keep working on. We're currently working on the enemy race for the 4th world and our hope is that they will stir up the gameplay quite a bit =)"
iosgaming,36zx65,TheVideoGameLawyer,3,Sun May 24 16:05:35 2015 UTC,"This game is awesome, I've been playing it nonstop. One suggestion I'd have is making a physical appearance change to upgrades. It's always one thing I loved about tower defense game, to see how much cooler the towers look after an upgrade. Nothing big, the game is already great and doesn't need it but it would be nice if it was implemented in a sequel or update."

iosgaming,36zx65,AckJack,2,Sat May 23 23:03:30 2015 UTC,"Thanks :) yeah, that is a challenge having the balance right.

iosgaming,36zx65,AckJack,2,Sun May 24 01:38:53 2015 UTC,"The game is gorgeous, great music, really high quality all around. I just wish it was monetized differently. Time locks don't encourage me personally to spend money on a game. It feels like a penalty. I mean, I appreciate you can play totally free, but I would have much rather been able to spend, say, $9.99 to unlock the whole thing now and then buy packs if you want. Or something similar to Kingdom Rush's model where you pay for fun new heroes that also add replayability.  Overall though, it's a really solid game!"
iosgaming,36zx65,skeletorso,2,Sun May 24 08:58:22 2015 UTC,"Yay glad you like it :) yeah, we'll work on monetization a bit. We do like keeping free, then everyone can try it out before spending anything and also, there's a lot of players who aren't able to pay anything at all, so it is possible for them to play this as well (with some longer wait times). We'll keep working on it, making it better, adding levels, enemies and new cool cards!"

iosgaming,36ycpx,pymatek,1 point,Sat May 23 06:46:09 2015 UTC,"Is this just another ""find the Euler circuit"" game, or does it offer something new?"
iosgaming,36ycpx,pymatek,1 point,Sat May 23 11:10:23 2015 UTC,It gets more complicated than that. There are special nodes that connect you to other nodes (teleporters) and certain lines you have to go over twice.  Also not every level is an Euler Circuit. By definition an Euler Circuit is when you start and end on the same node. Most levels are not Euler Circuits.
iosgaming,36ycpx,pymatek,1 point,Sat May 23 17:16:14 2015 UTC,"Fine, Euler path, not circuit. It's still not particularly interesting.  Some thoughts:   Pack 1 is too long. Introduce the basic game mechanics and move on.  To that end, pay attention to level design. 5 and 8 are the same. Also, 21 and 22 feel very out of sequence. They're very easy levels, and don't belong where they are in the pack. Be mindful of layout. A number of levels have a vertex located on top of the restart button. (I'm on an iPad Air.) Consider some system that allows the user to skip levels. I'm curious to see what the levels in pack 3 are like (I assume this is where the multi-edge stuff shows up), but I don't want to play through pack 2 to find out. I didn't find the teleporter explanation very enlightening. Their behavior where the two ends aren't connected is very clear, but once there's an edge between them, it gets confusing (in terms of where the next edge will be drawn from)."
iosgaming,36ycpx,pymatek,1 point,Sat May 23 19:15:08 2015 UTC,"Funny how you didn't find it particularly interesting, I haven't had that much feedback like that. Also the multiplayer version will probably make it better.  All 3 packs are 36 levels. The game is made for the iPhone, not the iPad - but a new update is going to address layout issues on the iPad. The levels don't go 100% linearly in difficulty, some people find it nice to have some easier levels after some hard levels.  Why don't you want to play through pack 2?  I don't know how to make the teleporters any more clear..."
iosgaming,36ycpx,pymatek,1 point,Sat May 23 20:12:36 2015 UTC,"I just tested it on my iPhone, and the layout is fine. I assumed the iPad would scale things correctly, but that's not the case. As such, ignore my earlier comment about layout.  The reason I don't find it interesting is because I know how to find circuits/paths in graphs. There's literally zero challenge, and so it fails to be a puzzle. Once you know where to start and end, there's not much left to do.  The reason I'm inclined not to play through pack 2 is related to the teleporters. Their behavior seems inconsistent. I'll link a couple videos below to show what I mean.  Video 1  Video 2  For sake of clarity, let's label the vertices 1-4, going clockwise starting from top left.  In video 1, the sequence of vertices I hit is 1,2,3. When I hit vertex 2, its surrounding circle changes color from white to red, then the next edge gets drawn from the vertex that is now white (vertex 1).  Compare to video 2. The sequence is just 2,3. Upon selecting 2, it connects vertices 1 and 2, and 2 changes from white to red. (The color change is identical to the above scenario.) Now, when I select vertex 3, the edge is drawn from the red-circled vertex (#2) instead of the white one, as it did above.  Maybe I'm not fully understanding how teleporters work, or something's amiss. Hopefully you can tell me which."

It's completely free to play.  iphone/ipad  Android  Amazon  The game's free to download and play - you collect coins as you play to unlock abilities and gear. You have the option to pay cash for more coins, but you'll never be required to do it to keep playing or anything like that.  Basically, we have a TON of ideas for content. Right now there are two bosses, and we want to add more levels (the locker room, the frozen lake, and BEYOND) and a ton of bosses and content. We've already made a bunch of team-colored gear certain hockey fans might enjoy, and will be adding that in the next few days. We're a team of two guys - myself on art and animation, and Josh on programming and everything else. If the game's received well, we'll keep adding to it. So tell everyone you know, and support it if you like it and want to see more.    The iphone/ipad build is about a week behind the others on updates due to the way apple approves things. The biggest difference at the moment is an improved tutorial - it's been cleaned up a bunch. So look for that coming soon.  The android build has a glitch that will stop progress the first time you load the tutorial. We just pushed an update to fix this (it'll be live shortly). In the meantime, quit the game and re-enter it to continue normally."

I found it a bit difficult - which can be a good thing - but I think it was a limitation of my screen size, I have a 5s.   I got better after the 3 plays I did, which is good, but I felt like I was fighting for the corner of my phone. Maybe I will try later on my iPad.   I didn't get in far enough to see how the iap works, but I think you have something cool here, and I would recommended looking at some sort of ""gacha"" machine for skaters or something. I really think with that art, if you had a mechanic like this( an example - puzzle and dragons), people would shower you with dollars."
iosgaming,36sasg,TBBJ,0,Fri May 22 07:22:09 2015 UTC,Agree 100%. I use the bottom half inch corner of my phone. That's it. So when I have to swipe back to shoot each time I have no time to aim and I get punched. Maybe make the aim arrow brighter.

iosgaming,36st4h,-Feartjeh,2,Fri May 22 22:30:46 2015 UTC,We've been working hard on this game for the past 6 months. We're just a team of two brothers. It was first released on Android and we've tried our best to bring the experience onto iOS.  We've mainly did most of our testing on our old 4th gen iPods and simulator.   So it would be great to get feedback on how it runs on other newer devices.
iosgaming,36st4h,NickyNichols,2,Thu May 21 21:03:29 2015 UTC,Just downloaded it. Will give feedback in some hours C:

I have about 8 games going right now, which is plenty, all with the 3 life cap.  It's really quite playable without dropping any money. I'm having fun with it! Hope you guys give it a chance."
iosgaming,36tevs,Uhgii,0,Sun May 24 22:05:42 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree that it's too high, but other games have used this exact life-model and the same exact price. The best example is the overly-successful Trivia Crack. 3 lives, $24.99 exactly for unlimited lives. Even the upgrade to increase the limit to 5 lives is $4.99 in both games.  I figure they just took a page from their book, given their success.  Personally, I'd think $2.99 for the 5-life cap, and $9.99 for the unlimited would be thoroughly fair, and depending on how successful the game is, and how many people are willing to toss that kind of money, perhaps we'll see a price drop. I love the game so far, but I can't imagine Trivia Crack levels of success."

If you find the basic idea of exploring worlds, mining shafts, getting resources, building stuff, and killing the occasional monster not intresting than JJX isn't going to help you.   But if you liked the concept but felt that the original JJ fell a bit short on that than JJX is probably enough to reinvest."

The amount of time that is required (every day) to remain competitive is ridiculous for such a content-poor game.  Who knows, maybe Wayforward (the devs of this game) will be better than Demiurge. I own Card Wars (another Adventure Time game that Wayforward made) and thought they did a good job with that."

I actually tried playing again once recently and quickly discovered I lost my lightening-fast reflexes I used to have...had trouble on even the lower difficulty stages.

I recall failing missions several times on PC that I have passed in one time on my iphone. It just takes some adjusting.   That being said I finally reached the Zero missions and those have always been hard as hell. On the third one with the remote car and tanks and it's tough to do in the time limit.

iosgaming,36ipbj,simplycass,1 point,Tue May 19 18:58:22 2015 UTC,It's just that my strategy is so predicated on nuanced physical controls which you lose with touch screens.  Like being able to stop on a dime or edge the car a little bit one way to throw the cops off and when doing side missions like Vigilante.  half the time when using touch screen controls I end up wasting ammo because I accidentally touch the drive-by button or I can't back up fast enough and swing the car during a pursuit.  I even got Controllers For All + a DS4 for the MFi capabilities but I still find it more difficult to play the GTA storyline seriously than on the PC.

I play with an iPad Mini Retina, and overall, however, I prefer to play touch games designed for touch. I'm not talking virtual D-Pad games, those really suck. But I really liked the controls, for example, in Prince of Persia: The shadow and the Flame. It's a platformer that has really nifty touch controls that don't use virtual d-pads.

iosgaming,36hu1m,SawcasmOfficial,1 point,Tue May 19 15:47:54 2015 UTC,"I appreciate your reply. I wonder why is it so hard for these studios to implement a ""no-raid mode"" where one can play solo without the fear of being raided every now and then. Anyway, thanks for your reply."
iosgaming,36hu1m,SawcasmOfficial,2,Tue May 19 17:02:32 2015 UTC,"There are in-game ""shields"" which prevent you from being raided for 6h after you get raided."
iosgaming,36hu1m,1Raizen,1 point,Tue May 19 17:19:04 2015 UTC,"Thing is, with this game, if you don't raid, it would be extremely hard for you to level up your stuff specially in higher levels. It's actually one of my gripes with the game cause the prices are too steep after level 7 and up, and you cannot just hold onto your gold to save up either cause you're going to get steamrolled sooner or later.   It's pretty good, I play this mainly along with CoC and Boombeach. You should give it a try, there are some new mechanics added that makes the game more interesting.   Samurai Siege (same maker) has a pretty extensive single player mode, but you're still going to get raided regularly.   Try BoomBeach if you don't want to get raided as often, provided you keep your medals low and don't raid others yourself."

iosgaming,369m5u,CaptainNapoleon,12,Sun May 17 15:00:56 2015 UTC,"Totally depends.  Keep in mind that the games get progressively longer as the series progresses; IB1 is fairly short, IB2 is decently long, and IB3 has a lot of content.  Also consider that IB1 is outdated.  If you have a modern device it won't fill the screen.  If you want the story experience I'd say it's worth it to get all three, just for the background on some stuff, but it's by no mean necessary.  If you want the best gameplay, I personally find IB2 to be the most fun."
iosgaming,369m5u,AzeTheGreat,9,Sun May 17 15:42:54 2015 UTC,"Personally I would just buy the 3rd one. Sunk a ton of time into that one. Obviously great graphics, but a ton of fun and a lot more content than the other 2"
iosgaming,369m5u,DA1836,5,Sun May 17 16:20:58 2015 UTC,I second this.
iosgaming,369m5u,The_Real_Boss,5,Sun May 17 22:33:46 2015 UTC,"How much are you saving? Honestly though, I played the second one and it was pretty fun, but I admit that it was the same thing over and over again. In my opinion, the game does a few things really well: a steady upgrade system changes your character's look, a steady ramp up in difficultly that made you feel challenged but also let you know that you could actually win with some persistence, and graphically speaking it looked very nice. The story was fairly mediocre, although I only read up on the first game, and the only variation in combat was the 3 different weapons you could use. Different enemies or strategies were few.   I got the game for free through some promo and I really enjoyed it, but I was also really glad when it was over because it reached the point that I was getting a little bored. For their price, I wouldn't buy those games. The second one was good, just not really great, IMHO.   Although some people really liked it and it was reviewed well so I guess I'm a minority. That's the beauty of opinions!   Edit: I just noticed the 3rd one on sale for $3. I would buy that one cause $3 does is very reasonable. On the other hand, the first one for $7 is a total ripoff.   If you know you'll enjoy them, $10 for the bundle isn't the word price. I would personally use that money towards more unique games."
iosgaming,369m5u,octagonman,3,Sun May 17 15:50:28 2015 UTC,"I played all three and I thought they were fun. It's got a cool story and gameplay is fun, though repetitive. They address the repetitive nature in the story that evolves over the games and by building a significant upgrade system into the game. I'd happily recommend them, myself."
iosgaming,369m5u,PairOfMonocles2,2,Sun May 17 16:57:28 2015 UTC,All 3 for the story  Only the cheapest for the gameplay  #2 for the most fun
iosgaming,369m5u,DishonestStranger,1 point,Mon May 18 03:05:50 2015 UTC,"I don't think it'd be worth getting all three because the mechanics don't really change across the trilogies, but as a fan of the games who's dumped dozens of hours into each of them, I'd definitely recommend picking up just the third. It's the most varied of the three despite its repetition, and the most graphically impressive. You'll get a kick out of it for a while but if you're looking for a decent hack 'n' slash, I'd recommend Implosion: Never Lose Hope, or my personal favorite, Monster Hunter Freedom Unite for iOS, which isn't nearly as quick-paced or combo-heavy as the other two but will give you the most bang for your buck and will provide you hundreds or even thousands of hours of intense, tactical, and overwhelmingly difficult combat against gigantic enemies, provided you stick through the tedious tutorial missions and never give up, despite the Dark Souls-esque challenge of the game  tl;dr Save your money and just get the third one"
iosgaming,369m5u,dudewelcome,1 point,Sun May 17 19:56:48 2015 UTC,If you are a patient gamer the IB games go on sale pretty regularly. Usually for significantly less. My personal favorite was 2.

iosgaming,369bdc,SLYRZ11,2,Sun May 17 12:57:45 2015 UTC,"Fun concept but ultimately deleted after 2 plays, here's why:  Progression is too gated. I read you other comments where you can expect a max of 20 tokens per run(ish) I got 11 on my first try.  That's not enough to buy an upgrade, watching an ad got me another 5, still not enough for an upgrade.  You mention this is to allow people to try different strategies, all well and good but of course that's not how it works: In my first game I had full upgrades (SMG and sandbags), got to the dogs wave and by the time I had killed four or so zombies the front wave was already  at the wall. It wouldent have mattered what I had done, there is no different tactic to change that outcome, unless, I got some token unlocks, but since I'm several games away from that, it's not going to happen.  I like the game, but you need to work on progression, additional content and a reason to keep playing beyond ten mins and then deletion.  Question to you: are you still playing this hour after hour? Because if your not, in this marketplace, your app will get deleted and drop off the charts rapidly.  I don't mean to come across as harsh, just trying to offer some constructive criticism."
iosgaming,369bdc,only1rob,2,Mon May 18 02:05:04 2015 UTC,"No problem, if everyone kept quiet i'd never know what i'm doing wrong.  I'll increase the token amount in game for the earlier waves. Will need to test it out and make sure it's balanced though. I probably should have gone with my gut on the progression. I saw other games where you get next to no tokens for unlockables and decided to go with giving slightly more than what i'd seen them give, but obviously i haven't been generous enough.  I do still play frequently, I have everything unlocked now though hah.  I'm adding new weapons and a boss now, i'll add in things based on the feedback i've received today.  Cheers."

iosgaming,369bdc,dave2048,2,Mon May 18 01:04:49 2015 UTC,"Hey dude, sounds like you had a bad run, the tokens are randomised in game to a max of 5 each wave - So there was potential for 20 tokens that game (if you reached wave 4). It's hard to find a balance - The aim wasn't to force people to watch ads, but play the game and learn new strategies which would earn them tokens while they play. I'm not sure if it was you that gave the 1 star review, but that hurts man, especially when the game is just starting out."

Okay so somewhere in your retroarch folder there should be a place where your save states are. I think thats where .sav files should go but if u use save states your save files get overwritten just so your game doesn't glitch or something.   Anyway, find that, rename your.sav file to the exact same thing as your game (Ex. Tron Bonne.img should have a save file of Tron Bonne.sav NOT T4on B0nne.5av) and it should work.

After you get your party and figure out what skills are best, leveling up only serves as a tool to keep up with enemies that also level up. You get no additional choices, just +damage to your favourite attack or +health to your favourite heal. Gear is just better gear.    I liked the first one but it really didn't have any real depth, and it sounds like this one is even more shallow."

I love the whole role play thing the characters and especially the narrator got going. The dialogues are ridiculously fun at times, however there is no decent main plot to care about. You will love it if you ever played table RPGs with your friends.  The presentation is simply amazing. Pixel art, catchy 8 bit tunes, fun sound effects etc etc.. The gameplay is simple. You have a a narrator, a table, 5 chairs, and 2 characters to start with. You assign them to play roles of different classes (warrior, mage, cleric etc.) and set out on a journey which consists of turn based battling, doing quests, getting rewards, grinding exp and money, getting better gear, expanding your party leveling up your dudes."

Really hoping they update with more content, because I'm pretty sure this game was shorter than the first. Great experience up until the end, though, I would certainly recommend.   Edit: Though it is maybe relevant to mention that before the game ends, one of your character says something like ""oh boy, I can't wait for cool endgame content and adventures"", and the DM says ""right... yeah... haha..."", so that's the developers acknowledging the lack of endgame content, so hopefully they will add some"

iosgaming,363rlp,Gimaad,2,Fri May 15 21:29:55 2015 UTC,Im in the same boat as you. They recently added new islands but there is some elongated task to unlock them so I couldn't be bothered. IMHO the whole game is fetch quests only redeemed by the island customisation. I played it when I was jailbroken (didn't have to worry about currency or wait times) and even then the game was slow.

iosgaming,363rlp,toochunky,1 point,Sat May 16 19:54:22 2015 UTC,"I'd be interested in other opinions too. From what I can tell, the new areas feature slightly ""harder"" versions of the same stuff from the original islands.  For example, there are monsters that you need to attack 8 times to defeat. Since the combat is one of the most boring and unchallenging things in the game, the idea of fighting more of these guys seems insanely tedious.  There are a few new kinds of quests, like a diner dash minigame you play in the restaurant. Good for a tiny bit of variety, but that's all.  But maybe once you get over the hump of the initial quests, there are more interesting things, or the story advances more fully. IDK."

The commercial makes them aware of the product so if even a small sample of people who saw the commercial DL the game, it's a win.  We're talking about it now when otherwise we wouldn't.   Think about products like Coca Cola. Does anyone not know what coca cola isn't this point?  It's not that they're advertising new things, but brand recognition and keeping it in front of the customer is always worth it."

Not because I don't like to read, but because a good game with honest reviews typically have ratings that descend like a pyramid (mostly 5s, a lot of 4s, some 3s, rarely 2s or 1s).  I use the screenshots as a means to see how they're selling it. One of the BIGGEST deterrents for me is if the screenshot is of an iPad or phone with a screenshot of the game within it. Usually then, they fill the space with high-quality art from the designers and bubbly fonts... For whatever reason, this screams poor quality to me like a Pavlovian response."

Wasn't the original an iPhone game first? It didn't had this problem Couldn't they planned ahead and draw the backgrounds and such tall enough?  Stupid thing but this lack of attention really bothers me."

iosgaming,35wosu,traanZ,3,Thu May 14 15:41:33 2015 UTC,"Problem is iPhone 5S has different screen size to iPhone 6, for example, so they're probably just set it to the lowest common denominator for launch. No doubt they'll optimise for specific devices at a later stage."

Slightly less great graphics than the more recent ones, but no IAP, and a loot system that feels like a proper game, not something obviously geared towards making you buy things.

The Home button wearing out has been one of the biggest issue with many of the iPhone models that I've used. I replaced the Home button on my 3GS at least three times, and I recently replaced it on an iPhone 4.  Wanting to keep your iPhone for a long time? Want to pass it down to family members after you're done with it? Want to make sure it stays in great condition?   Screen? Keep a protector on, and it's fine. Body? Keep a case on, and it's fine. Battery? Just pop the display off and replace it. Home button? It's mechanical, it wears out. Even if you're gentle, it will go out. (Replacing this is an absolute pain in the ass on the 3G, 3GS, 4, and 4S.)   Force Touch on the new MacBook and MacBook Pro is amazing. It clicks (and thunks) like a real, mechanical switch.

iosgaming,35qthx,grifftaur,0,Wed May 13 16:42:56 2015 UTC,"I'm doing nothing.  The Home button is the most-likely component of any iOS device to fail. It's mechanical, and it gets far more use than any other mechanical button (volume, mute, or power).  The technology behind it is a bendy piece of metal. It can wear out.  My first iPhone 3GS Home button was clicky. After Apple replaced the 3GS (due to a hairline crack in the back of the phone), the replacement 3GS had a stiff Home button. Hard to push, which made double-clicks annoying. I replaced that button. The replacement button was fine, until it got mushy. No clicks. Eventually it stopped working. The one I have on there now has been fine for 2 years.  On my iPhone 4, it would sometimes fail to register a click unless you pushed really hard. I replaced that one and it has been fine, ever since.  My iPad 2 and iPhone 4S Home buttons have been fine since I got them in 2011, so I've been lucky with those. They obviously aren't all bad. It's just some have had issues with them.  They can fail, and they haven't been easy to replace.  Just Google for ""mushy"" or ""stiff"" Home buttons. People have guides to ""calibrate"" (lol) the Home button, ""push and twist"", use rubbing alcohol, enable assistive / on-screen Home, jailbreak work-arounds, etc. Basically, a LOT of people simply have problems with the most failure-prone component."

Seriously.   I was a witch. Never once encountered another witch. Never once lost a match or felt challenged. All enemies acted exactly the same. Very predictable. I would LITERALLY CLOSE THE APP and come back to discover that the fight has been PAUSED."

iosgaming,35ofga,nxtboyIII,16,Tue May 12 05:03:28 2015 UTC,"Downloading it right now! Will report back.   Initial thoughts:   Now, I'm a consumer. Not a dev. So I my advice is not going to be technical.  So far, I'm having fun. It's a very unique game, not like any I've ever played before, that's for sure! Which, I make somewhat of a living as a gamer, so that's no easy feat. And it is a testament to your ideas! But as far as improvements go...  You need a tutorial. If I downloaded that game for a purpose other than to give you feedback, I'd have quit after the third or fourth failed attempt, because I had NO idea what I was doing. Like, do I tap the enemies to shoot them? How do I aim? How do I access my secondary weapon? Give the players some direction!   At the weapon selection screen, move the Main Menu button (or a Back button) to one of the top corners and don't have it scroll. I accidentally selected the M4 as a primary and wanted to give the RL a go, and had no way to go back until I scrolled to the bottom!   The aiming/firing mechanic is a little janky. But as I said, I'm a consumer, not a dev. and I don't know how to go about fixing that. I was also getting shot from quite a large distance away. Perhaps I was meant to use that as an idea for where the enemies would be, but coming back to the tutorial idea, how am I meant to know that?  I'll keep playing and revisit this comment in a little while."
iosgaming,35ofga,joshennor,7,Tue May 12 05:31:49 2015 UTC,"Dang, I didn't know people were quitting because they didn't know how to play :o  That actually helps a ton, I will try adding a tutorial! Thanks so much!! :)"
iosgaming,35ofga,Aquagoat,3,Tue May 12 13:22:01 2015 UTC,"I agree with these sentiments.  I loaded it up, died a bunch, and quit.  I can't figure out the shooting.  It seems you move the joystick up and down to aim, and then move it forwards and back to fire?  Also the placement is weird, and causes my thumb to cover exactly where the enemies are always coming from."
iosgaming,35ofga,nullput,2,Tue May 12 14:43:01 2015 UTC,"Ok, so in the new version you can tap anywhere on the right half of the screen and it will move the joystick to that position. Plus I think I'm going to add some kind of tutorial :D  Thanks"
iosgaming,35ofga,nullput,5,Tue May 12 19:18:47 2015 UTC,Not sure you're dealing with the $9 mini gun issue now (cause at the moment there are no IAP available for the game) but make that the #1 priority. If I ran across the game by accident and seen there was an IAP of $9 for a single gun I'd close and move on.
iosgaming,35ofga,nullput,1 point,Tue May 12 11:22:22 2015 UTC,"What country do you live in? It doesn't show any IAPs in that country? So you download it and when you tap the gun you wanna buy, what happens?  Thanks :)"

One other suggestion it to allow customisation of control positions. I'm do all my iOS gaming while lying down on the couch in front of the TV. On an iPad the joystick positions are very awkward."
iosgaming,35ofga,tdubya22,4,Tue May 12 14:06:30 2015 UTC,"Didn't download, but it looks like you overpriced your digital content. You want to create (the impression of) value. You haven't.  Example: You say a mini gun is worth $8 or $9? Nope. Not in my mind it isn't. I don't care how insanely amazing it is. And no one else thinks it is, clearly.  But...  Offer us a special bundle that includes the mini gun, the two other things, and a random, mystery bonus item, along with the promise of an ad-free experience for $4 or $5... now I'm far more intrigued without having even played the game.  A tactic like that gives the impression that the user can get a great deal and great value for going all in, and the random mystery item tickles those of us who can't resist exploring the unknown.  You should've done that. And you should've given a very deep discount for your early users to get them to open their wallet (even for a small amount) so that you can sell them more content in the future."

One might say these took a lot from PC gaming but that's a good thing and they would be right. We need more games like these."
iosgaming,35ox0h,horizoniki,1 point,Tue May 12 12:46:51 2015 UTC,"tried Hearthstone and interested in Vainglory. As for the p2w tune of the mobile MMOs, I think it is just a nature for most F2P MMOs? Just some MMOs are heavy P2W and some are not that obvious.

Then I got more into it and I realised that in order to keep playing, I'd need to empty my wallet, since I need this thing called constitution to spend on starting missions. So I need to wait 13 hours in order to get about 2 hours worth of game time, maybe less. Sure, there's a lot of other stuff to do in the game, but that's also limited somehow. Even chat messages are limited. So freemium, p2w and p2p game. Sigh. I'm gonna try vainglory.    Vainglory asking me for payment verification. Why? Is it because I have an iphone 4s?"

They're all made by the same publisher, and all have the same basic mechanic. They all also have the free-to-play-but-pay-us-for-better-cards model.  That said, I'm actually enjoying MK and Injustice, and have been playing both for about 2/3 weeks (everyday) without spending a cent. I just play for a few minutes a day, beat the crap out of Scorpion or Cat Woman and that's that. I'm actually enjoying them.

iosgaming,35jogm,Zedmis,2,Mon May 11 00:47:05 2015 UTC,"Monster Hunter Freedom Unite - Should be compatible with iPad Air 2.  Incredibly long game with tons of content; you could easily spend hundreds of hours playing.  The game itself has solid graphics and decent controls considering it has the most in depth combat system on IOS.  Be forewarned: this game is fairly difficult and it's a style that not everyone likes; check out some videos first to make sure you'll enjoy it (it's pricey).  Sky Gamblers: Storm Raiders - Probably the best dogfighting game on the appstore.  Gorgeous graphics, good controls, and excellent multiplayer combine to make it the gold standard for aerial combat games.  As long as you enjoy multiplayer combat this won't get boring, however there's not a lot of reason to replay the campaigns.  (If you prefer a later time period, Cold War is also a great game, but is not as popular as Storm Raiders.)"

And the first major decision you're supposed to make.  I'm devastated and I hate all of you. Why would you do that?  That's not ... that's not fun.  It's not even powerful.

The RTS type battles in it do not have the base building and hiring and are more short skirmish tyoes, the building part is all on a turn based map more similar to a Civ game.

iosgaming,3558se,ToxicAdamm,4,Thu May 7 12:16:33 2015 UTC,"Initial impressions:  First of all, Great game!    Controls work very well on touch. Simple and effective! Game loads very fast. From launch of the app to actual gameplay in under 5 seconds No crashes as of yet Works offline No IAP There's this gyro parallex option enabled by default. Looks great at first but for some reason it made me a bit nauseous so disabled it Combat seems just a bit simple so far (Although I haven't gotten far into the game). Mostly you just tap buttons when they are ready and position yourself to be most effective. Focus on the game seems to be lying elsewhere. Exploartion, puzzles, character building,... On the other hand there are plenty of RPG stat ellements. A lot of stats and attributes to consider to optimize your characters. Very atmospheric. A pretty creepy, claustophobic vibe. Soon you'll be running scared away from enemies and giving your characters personality. ""Sorry Tommy, you gonna have to carry these snail pieces. Alzar, you're the guy responsible for torches. Try not to burn any of us you creepy mage!"". I'd start to imagine conversations between my characters.  Game does a good job to explain things to you without forcing you trough a annoying scripted tutorial. There is a ""Tutorial"" in the menu but it's just a 3 picture slideshow that shows you what every button does. The rest is done trough in game hints, dsicriptive messages left behind by previous explorers, which works really well and adds trough the atmosphere.  The story set up is pretty simple but effective. 4 criminals, chained together a dropped into the Grimrock and if they are able to get out alive their crimes are forgiven. There doesn't seem to much to it at first but I've seen some hints that perhaps there is more to the story...   Honestly, one of the best RPG executions I've seen on iOS. The formula just works and is very well executed.I just want to keep playing! Very hard to put down.    I get a lot of people might be disapointed this game is iPad only, and I certainly get that. However I do think some aspects of the would be too crampt for the iPhone display though which might not be apparant from just looking at the screenshot. The character sheets for example can't fill the display because it's pretty essential you see the game world side by side. Also I think most of the atmosphere will be lost this way."

Every time they ignore your email is that much more time they are using your name and gathering grounds to keep it. Act fast and take this to a professional.
iosgaming,3554vd,CivFTW,2,Thu May 7 12:19:23 2015 UTC,But the other developer is in a different country. Is it feasible?
iosgaming,3554vd,CivFTW,3,Thu May 7 14:09:53 2015 UTC,"It's certainly going to be harder and more complicated but with the right lawyer you don't need to get to that country, only to Apple :)"

iosgaming,3554vd,i010011010,3,Thu May 7 16:26:09 2015 UTC,My pleasure.  Glad I could help.
iosgaming,3554vd,i010011010,2,Thu May 7 16:36:24 2015 UTC,"Just to be certain, you're talking about games that are using the name and misleading people by making a similar game?  Not just happening to have the same/similar name with their original game.  There have been past examples, one of the more publicized was Blocks Cometh where they had a popular web game, but before they moved to mobile someone else cloned the game and released it under the same name.  Apple removed the offender and the 'real' game was released.  So all you need to do is contact Apple through their dev site.  Show them the original game and your supporting evidence as well as the infringing apps.  You don't need to assert copyright law or anything of the sort, they want to get rid of misleading apps as much as anyone."

iosgaming,3515kn,Crazy_Drago,3,Wed May 6 14:09:27 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  It would benefit greatly by altering the monster deck and your start card so that there is some progression.    For $2 you get enough IMO, but with a little more effort it would be really deep."

iosgaming,34wp9i,defiantmacho,16,Sun Jul 12 07:48:48 2015 UTC,"Just finished my third and final play through... First play through was great, then I just wanted to win, this is where the game falters. SPOILERS ahead!!  First Play Through: didn't bury anyone, saved the captain, got lots of Chemlights, rations, and medicine. Was doing really well, then I got overtaken by aliens.   Second time: killed the captain and buried everyone because I figured that meant they wouldn't come get me as alien zombies. I ate rat food, got only the Chemlights and medicine the game forces on you and this time got the BEST death ending where you still die, but the rescue ship and rescuers all escape with no problems and you also destroy the peak/yourself. I know this is the best death ending because it literally says ""this is the best way I could have die given the choices I was given""   I then got rescued by doing basically my first play thought, but told Taylor not to be selfish.   I figured the only way to not make it to the peak is to die early (sleep outside first night or push too hard the second night).  Like others have said, I wish I could have stayed at the Varia and used the 2 battery packs for the weapons system and beacon. I don't like that it always guides you on the same path. You never need more than the minimum Chemlights, pills, or food and your choices really don't matter. A great story, but not a ""choose your own adventure"" as billed."

iosgaming,34wp9i,Jay_Burd,6,Wed Jul 8 03:42:02 2015 UTC,"I don't think he's infected because it seems that once a lifeform is, it's original body is destroyed. 2. Story takes place in the far future, hopefully they are smart enough and have advanced enough technology to inspect him thoroughly before he possibly infects people.    However, if he is infected that would be a great starting place for Lifeline 2. You could advise someone on the medical rescue ship just as the crew is starting to get infected. That'd make for a totally different game environment than a deserted moon. It would be super cool if the second game used your save data from the first game to have multiple beginnings incorporated from the multiple endings in the first game."
iosgaming,34wp9i,Weavemajjik,1 point,Wed Jul 8 08:37:08 2015 UTC,"There was a brief dialogue with Taylor where he appeared to be have taken over by the lifeform. And fought it off, being still partially human, which made me believe he was infected. The taste in his mouth further solidifies that belief. How would he have fought off something crawling into his mouth when he was sleeping? Which would make me believe you're right about the sequel, which may be titled ""Lifeline 2: Lifeform"""
iosgaming,34wp9i,ChestyMcGeek,6,Wed Jul 8 12:21:37 2015 UTC,"I assumed that the dialogue was because they appear to have some sort of mind control shit going on with those glowey green eyes, because you keep reminding him not to look into the eyes, so I'm gonna say no, he's not infected."
iosgaming,34wp9i,thetidebreaks,5,Thu Jul 9 06:25:17 2015 UTC,"At one point in my playthrough near the very end, Taylor realizes that the green shit in his mouth was due to one of them /trying/ to get into him. I don't think it actually succeeded however, at least in my playthrough. I agree with Chesty, I think a lot of it was mind control stuff going on at that point. They hypnotize their victims and in doing so, leave them completely unable to resist becoming a host. Besides, if he was infested this entire game (starting at the point he noticed the green stuff in his mouth over at the Varian), why would they be trying to shove ANOTHER host into him at the end of the game? (aka the one that had been in Wildboy the rat)"
iosgaming,34wp9i,Deradius,2,Fri Jul 10 13:25:06 2015 UTC,"The infected are undead.  Taylor mentions this, and if you get him infected he first goes into tachycardia, then cardiac arrest, then stops transmitting."

Just finished the game, and I am pretty satisfied with the ending.  On my first playthrough, I didn't explore the flight deck first, so I didn't have the option to go back and chose to ignore burying the dead crew (not that that matters). After that Taylor managed to break his/her shoulder or something opening the door, got some rat food and water, slept by the reactor and snagged some glow sticks and painkillers. Taylor then died on the way to the peak, looking up the stars, which Taylor thought was beautiful. (This was quite upsetting)  On my second play through, Taylor discovered the Captain of the Varia and put her in the stasis pod, which saved her and buried the bodies. I told Taylor to go to the Gallery, but the door wouldn't budge, so I ignored it this time, but their shoulder still hurt later on and slept next to the reactor. I managed to get glow rods, pain killers, proper meals (chilli with beans?) and 2 generators, which was awesome. Then I reached the peak, broadcasted an SOS, warned the ship so they got down safely, threw a glow stick for the creatures inhabiting my crew (didn't know that), gave the (undead?) rats more food, got corned by the alien (to Taylor) crew, but they ran off for the ship.   I told Taylor it was selfish for them to die, and not warn the others so he/she managed to navigate over the cracks, after telling the rescue crew to put their helmets on and reached the ship after rambling. Which got me an amazing ending where they even picked up the Captain and put her into their med room to save her and they talked about nuking the planet.   Now I feel alone, Taylor's gone. I love things like this, that actually make you feel for the character.   I would love a Lifeline sequel, with more varied choices, a longer story and perhaps a working suit camera, so they could send images (although that might ruin the game). Ooh, and more options for the choices.   I loved Lifeline."

However upon going back it became clear that deviating from choices I had made rarely created any measurable difference. I guess this is more understandable than in comparable Fighting Fantasy type books - in those you would be pushed back onto the same course by random events, whereas in Lifeline it's Taylors own will/desire.  I think I've sussed out most of the endings, but I was wondering whether or not there were others I'd missed. Namely... 1. Is it possible to save the captain and take her offworld with you? 2. Is it possible to go back to the Varia with the portable generator and have some sort of showdown (aliens vs gun-turret)?"
iosgaming,34wp9i,Jay_Burd,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:27:12 2015 UTC,Yes you can save the captain. You pick her and her stasis pod up after the ship saves you. I'm not sure about the turret vs aliens. This is what I really wanted to do on my 2nd playthrough. It seems you can't return to the Varia once you discover the caravel though. Too bad :(
iosgaming,34wp9i,Fnurgh,6,Wed Jul 8 08:41:15 2015 UTC,"It was good but the writer clearly read Andy Weir's ""The Martian"" and thought ""I'm going to steal Mark Watney"". They plagiarised the main character and it was far from subtle.  Not that that is a bad thing per se but I'm a little surprised no one has mentioned this."
iosgaming,34wp9i,sarahnorthway,2,Fri May 8 12:54:09 2015 UTC,"I just finished reading the Martian and felt the strong similarities, though I don't see why they would have gone out of their way to plagiarize such a boring non-character as Mark Watney, whose personality was practically an afterthought addition to a science-based story.  I do wish Taylor (and Watney for that matter) had been better defined, since Lifeline hinges around you caring what happens to him (/her). I didn't; I just kept wondering how they let this doofus kid onto a spaceship without even teaching him the metric system first!"
iosgaming,34wp9i,Fnurgh,3,Sun Jul 5 18:47:00 2015 UTC,"Blimey, I thought the complete opposite about Watney's character!"
iosgaming,34wp9i,knox1845,2,Mon Jul 6 11:04:40 2015 UTC,I agree. Both Taylor and Watney speak like a 15 year old trying to be witty. Easily the worst thing about this game and The Martian. This is some dire stuff - come on!

iosgaming,34wp9i,Lil00205,3,Wed May 13 16:36:30 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I dont know why they ever added the fast setting, the slow setting makes the game so much better. My recommendation is to just go through it slowly."

I wish the author has written about more characters on different planets with different situations. I understand there were plenty of outcomes, but when you can so easily redo your mistakes and arrive at a good ending , why would I go back. It's upsetting that such an amazing game ended ( as it seemed to an appreciative user ) so quickly."

I've also gotten one ending where Taylor dies on a trek back to the Varia. He decides to lay down and look at the stars, and after thanking me, he marvels at the beauty of his dying place and he dies very peacefully... it was my personal favorite ending.   anyway, there's one thing that bothers me... seems like a clue. what the hell is with the boot prints he saw on his walk to the peak? since the boot tracks are the exact same as his, same size and pattern, I wonder what this means? I suppose it could be someone else's prints who also walked to the peak but didn't survive (perhaps whoever wrote the Chinese words behind the peak), but what are the chances they had the exact same prints as Taylor? could be wrong but it seemed like a clue, not sure why the writer would stress the point that the tracks were EXACTLY like Taylor's (even to the point that Taylor wonders if he walked in circles).

iosgaming,34wp9i,Frosty0Dude,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:19:29 2015 UTC,Taylor had an alien shoved down his throat; and became a full host for them. You have to snap him out of being somewhat 'hypnotised' by the aliens. The aliens either have the power to make people sort of come to a halt and stop thinking straight (Which seems the most likely considering that ending and many things in the ending after it) or Taylor is a very stupid Scientist.

But it was still really cool seeing the VERY REAL reaction from Taylor. I wish they didn't force certain things at the user, but the smart texts really helps to make the game feel real.  Overall awesome experience with this game!"

Playthrough 1: Died on the first night at the Varia. NAILED IT!  Playthrough 2: Got all the way to the peak. Told Taylor to guard the computers. Got the ending where he dies; but kills the aliens as well (pretty much the only 'extinction of the aliens' ending since it's heavily implied that Taylor is a host).  Playthrough 3: Same as last playthrough, but Told Taylor to run to the ship instead of waiting at the computers. Got what I can only assume is the only ending in which Taylor survives."

And then he launched into the air, and thanked me for how I helped him, and then he said ""Taylor's out"" and the connection got ""Terminated"" not lost, and there was no sign of any chemical stuff going inside him. so I presume it was a Good Ending, and he didn't crash or something while going up!"

iosgaming,34us4n,NfsJake,2,Mon May 4 19:20:31 2015 UTC,"FS is kind of a beast to get into but there's nothing closer to chess with guns than that. As a bonus there's async play so you could have 15 games going and just plow through your moves on the train.  I'm sure you've played Bastion, but if you haven't, go do that now.  Most of the Dragon Quest games have been optimized for portrait play. IV, V, VI, and VIII.  Check out SNK's titles, most are on sale for $1 and are ports of their arcade fighters. I trust the reviews at Touch Arcade."
iosgaming,34us4n,NfsJake,1 point,Mon May 4 19:25:53 2015 UTC,"Yep, played Bastion! Great game.   Dragon Quest never really appealed to me- something about the dragonballZ art style always turned me off...

iosgaming,34vcg3,tarblog,3,Mon May 4 21:33:39 2015 UTC,"Avid puzzle game fan here, so this kind of game is right up my alley.  I played for about 20 minutes or so and I've unlocked world 6 (but really only played through 4), so my comments are based on what I've seen thus far.   Visually pretty nice. The discs are rather jagged around the edges, which really distracts from the otherwise clean aesthetic you have going. (Same is true for the stars that pop up after you complete a level, but you see those a lot less.) Easy to medium difficultly for the most part. Again, I have a number of worlds to go, so this could change wildly. Nice job of introducing the game mechanics via the first few levels. Easy to follow and it makes it clear what you're supposed to do. I like the variation in level goals. Adds a nice bit of variety as you're working through the levels. Knowing the number of moves to earn three stars is great. I've seen other games neglect this, and it leaves you wondering just how close you were to the best solution. I generally play my puzzle games without sound (and I'll probably play this one like that in the future, but I wanted the full experience), but this was quite pleasant. Mellow and relaxing, nice for unwinding a bit. I think the sound that plays when you unlock a new world is a little abrasive, and doesn't quite keep with the sound profile of the rest of the game. Otherwise, great. Adding the painters is a great twist that adds good complexity to the game. I'd like to see more additions to the game mechanics. (From what I can tell, there's nothing new introduced in the worlds I've not yet unlocked.) Ideas: teleporter squares that move your discs to another part of the board; a mirror/splitter square that can deflect a beam (like around a corner); a timer square that unlocks after a certain number of moves to reveal/block something.  I really prefer to play in landscape. I don't know if this is planned, or how the layout would be, but I'd like it (I think).   Honestly, I really like your game. Add levels as an IAP and I'd gladly purchase them."

iosgaming,34ns45,nxtboyIII,4,Sat May 2 21:25:36 2015 UTC,Looks like a rip off to me.
iosgaming,34ns45,findinemo,5,Sun May 3 02:20:27 2015 UTC,Looks like a cheap rip off to me.
iosgaming,34ns45,DAE_Man_Love,4,Sat May 2 21:46:39 2015 UTC,"Not really. The graphics look completely different, the interface seems different, one has vehicles and the other does not. The main thing that is in common is that they're both side-scrolling shooters, which is not exactly original anyway.  Then again, it's hard to tell from a couple of videos. What do you feel paranoid about?"
iosgaming,34ns45,valkyriav,1 point,Sat May 2 22:47:21 2015 UTC,"Well, here are things it look like they copied: - Tank looks exact same as in my game (armed combat) - crates look exact same - grenade launcher looks exact same - both have the ""ENEMY KILLED"" and ""HEADSHOT BONUS"" - both have the wooden watch towers  What do you think?"
iosgaming,34ns45,HaiKarate,2,Sat May 2 23:48:37 2015 UTC,"Can you post screen caps comparing the features you think were stolen from your game?  I watched the first video and part of the second (it's too long), and I didn't notice any similarities other than the fact that they were both side-scrolling army shooters.  Did you draw the art you say was stolen, or did you get it from another source?"

iosgaming,34mbeu,Isaforever,3,Sat May 2 13:13:09 2015 UTC,"I've been playing Hearthstone since the beta. I could see myself still playing that game years from now. Unlike most free to play games, there's actual gameplay. That's something most mobile developers seem to forget."
iosgaming,34mbeu,CurtisLeow,3,Sun May 3 22:31:54 2015 UTC,"I'm not proud but I have never played heartstone. I don't know why, because it's look super cool. Ok let's try it!"
iosgaming,34mbeu,Ceythos,1 point,Mon May 4 07:43:59 2015 UTC,"Hearthstone is pretty much never coming off my mobile devices now that it's available.  Besides Hearthstone, Brave Frontier hasn't left my phone since installing. It hits pretty close to the earlier final fantasy games nostalgia for me, and they keep updating regularly from what I've seen. I recently installed Final Fantasy Record Keeper as well, which I also suspect will hang around on my phone as long as BF does - if you love those older jrpg's with a newer spin I might recommend it."
iosgaming,34mbeu,effectivBro,3,Wed May 6 18:38:56 2015 UTC,"Exactly the same feeling. I download games like I watch my 300 channels tv. It's a bit sad but I don't look for extra fun in mobile games now like I was younger. Perhaps it's because games are less interesting right, but I think it's because I'm older and I'm not easily impressed by games' graphics or mood.  When I look at all the games I downloaded and play since 3 years, I get only 4 games that make me really happy."
iosgaming,34mbeu,Ceythos,2,Mon May 4 07:36:09 2015 UTC,Come on! What are those 4 games?

iosgaming,34izzx,anras,2,Sat May 2 21:04:24 2015 UTC,It went free on the 29th of April and it's still free! http://appshopper.com/games/swordigo    I'm rather enjoying this. It may be a bit derivative but I thought it would be pretty uninspired when I first launched it. The story won't win awards but the gameplay is pretty darn neat. And using an on-screen directional pad for a platformer works surprisingly well when there's only left and right directions.
iosgaming,34izzx,gaylordqueen69,1 point,Mon May 4 19:48:35 2015 UTC,"I like this game!  Liking the game does not mean I haven't found fault in the game, however. The combat starts out easy and then becomes unforgiving as the save spots grow further and further apart and you can afford fewer and fewer mistakes.  The last dungeon was easily 30-40% of the entire game time for me. It was absolutely fucking brutal from start to finish and it just would. not. let up. The difficulty spikes in this game are unreal."

iosgaming,34lit5,soulman2150,1 point,Sat May 2 05:37:09 2015 UTC,Frustrating translation of the genre.   For me on iPod Touch and iPad Air the controls are just simply unresponsive sometimes.And often times freaky - you pull in one direction and your toon goes in some random ass direction The ads come up after you've failed or have completed the level .... right where you would tap to go to the next level or to retry the level. I gave up after the 5th level at some dude who hit way too hard for that early in the game.
iosgaming,34lit5,bluspacecow,1 point,Sat May 2 09:58:38 2015 UTC,Thank you for the feedback. I am working on improved controls and will release an update for the game.  As for the other problem you have. The game is designed on the dragon ball z principle. You have to train and work hard to be the strongest. Every level you complete rewards you with a power gain. My tip to you is go back to a level that increased your level the most and repeat it a few times. Also destroying crates will sometimes give you a power crystal that is a huge power bonus (you must win the stage else you loose that bonus). Also take note that by increasing your power level you unlock more powers the first being the power up. Use the power up ability and charge your energy. Keep an eye on your power level and your opponents power level. If you charge in a fight with a low power level you will surely be defeated. Also be sure to block. I hope these tips makes you consider giving the game another chance.

iosgaming,34he8y,PMMeAtoms,2,Fri May 1 04:09:11 2015 UTC,This better be a premium game when it come out...if it's freemium...heads shall roll.
iosgaming,34he8y,AzeTheGreat,7,Fri May 1 05:21:02 2015 UTC,"It's freemium.  Not sure how much though... I'm downloading it now.  It's commercials are all over in Seoul right now, even opening up Avengers Age of Ultron (along with the Marvel Future Fight game too)  EDIT:  Ok. I just spent about 45 minutes with the game. It is free to play, you've got energy that goes down after every mission, with a timer to refill.    It's very similar to Dungeon Hunter (is that the Gameloft game's name) in that you collect loot, level them up, fuse them together to rank them up, all that fun F2P stuff. nothing out of the ordinary there.  One thing that Korean action RPGs have going for them is an auto-play mode that makes grinding MUCH easier. but then it also feels like you are just watching a computer play a game.  Graphically, this game is as good as a Gameloft game, not quite as jaggy as a game like Avalon or Ravensword. the animation in the cutscenes is much better that what i've seen with a bunch of games,  with better camera movements too.  The settings and maps are fantastic,  fully developed levels, although you follow a very linear path through them. The fight animations are pretty good, but there are of course a number of clipping issues. all of the armor/weapons you equip have different models, so they clip a bit.  Definitely not as polished as something like Infinity Blade.  I was about to totally write this game off until I unlocked a Raid section.  This is where the social part comes in I assume.  You and 4 other people team up to take down a dragon. And this dragon was huge,  the fight was very fulfilling too.  It seemed a lot like a Dragon Age Inquisition dragon fight.  you could target different body parts, and the dragon had a variety of different moves.  I didn't hit any paywalls in my short time, But i did see one popup for a special offer, and two or three social media popups (i dismissed them all). One thing that annoyed me though, was the 3! splash pages/ads I had to X out of before the game started.  These are all tied in with Naver, one of Korea's main SNS companies, so I assume they wont be as intrusive in a global version of the game."
iosgaming,34he8y,detourne,3,Fri May 1 15:51:43 2015 UTC,Well...this is unfortunate...
iosgaming,34he8y,AzeTheGreat,3,Fri May 1 16:26:47 2015 UTC,Marvel Future Fight is out now and has some of these features. Also f2p and made by a Korean developer.
iosgaming,34he8y,grainzzz,2,Fri May 1 17:37:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I'm a marvel zombie, been playing that quite a bit!"
iosgaming,34he8y,detourne,3,Sat May 2 03:53:16 2015 UTC,"""Top Grossing;"" that always means freemium.   That being said, freemium doesn't have to be bad, look at Vainglory. Although, any app that hits top grossing is probably one that overly monetizes."

You plot out moves for each of your units and your opponent does the same. Then you submit your turns and watch both of your plotted moves play out at the same time. Loads of fun and very challenging against skilled opponents.   Hero Academy - turn based tactics. You and your opponent choose one of six teams (just one if playing the free version) with differing units, powers, and abilities. You each have 1-3 crystals on either side of the board that must be defended. The goal is to eliminate your opponents entire team or all of their crystals to win. I've played this damn near every day for years now. Easily my favorite iphone game.   Edit: removed New World Colony as it's not on android."

Dialog is auto-initiated by running into people...  I was playing this on an iPad, I would expect the controls to be a bit better w/ an iPhone...

However it is a port of a pretty old game, so that might be why it feels overpriced. Than again Square Enix JRPGs are a lot older and yet even more expensive."
