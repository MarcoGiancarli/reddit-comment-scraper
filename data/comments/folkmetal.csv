folkmetal,3e5ghv,Scypio,3,Wed Jul 22 06:09:24 2015 UTC,"The Metal-Archives.com has an advanced search function, where you can search for band by genre and country (as well as other factors). Unfortunately it doesn't search by continent, so you'll have to search ""folk metal"" then scroll down the list and look for African countries in the right-hand column. It has about 1500, but who knows, you might find something random! http://www.metal-archives.com/search/advanced/?searchString=&type="
folkmetal,3e5ghv,basilbrushthefox,2,Wed Jul 22 09:33:32 2015 UTC,I've seen this question asked before and as far as I can tell it doesn't exist sadly.
folkmetal,3e5ghv,LordJanas,2,Wed Jul 22 12:47:49 2015 UTC,"Well I had a look on the metal archives as another user suggested and found a few things:  Azar from Algeria plus another band called Samhan but I couldn't find any material on YouTube.  Hate Field from Egypt who are described as folk/industrial metal on Metal Archives. Plus Sand Aura, who sound pretty decent.  Turns out South Africa has a much bigger metal scene that I expected. I found Balyios who sound and look a lot like an early Ensiferum tribute band to me.   Finally from Tunisia I found Ymyrgar who are also channelling some serious Northern European folk metal culture.  Probably the closest to what you're looking for was the first band, Azar but it's still not exactly what you want. Still it was interesting to see that quite a few African countries do have a metal scene of sorts."

Only comment I have (and you address this somewhat in the description of the video) is that the layered guitars get kind of confusing. There's parts where my brain switches between which melody it thinks is the ""lead"", so the overall melody suffers.  Other than that, really awesome job. Nice hair, too. ;D"

folkmetal,3bo6nv,HMJ87,2,Tue Jun 30 21:19:45 2015 UTC,"Every album I thought should be on there was on there, and any of the albums listed in this list which I also own are definitely some of my favourite albums. IMO this list is spot on, and any albums on there I don't know will be added to my collection soon for sure!"
folkmetal,3bo6nv,Thallassa,10,Wed Jul 1 08:41:02 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what exactly their methodology is. It seems to be a random collection of albums.   And it is missing some very early albums that would be good to understand the genre, such as Skyclad's The Wayward Sons of Mother Earth or Orphaned Land's Sahara.   Not to mention, the only Oriental band on there is Orphaned Land - nothing from the far Orient at all. Where's my Tengger Cavalry?  Also seems to be short on German folk metal bands like In Extremo or Schaundmaul.   And they have multiple Korpiklaani albums but no Manala, eh?   I can't comment as much on the viking metal side.   This is a list. It is a list of good albums. It is probably a list of ""albums the person who wrote the article likes"", and not a list that should be considered a comprehensive introduction to or education on the genre. However, if someone were to ask me ""what is this folk metal stuff"", this would be a decent thing to point them towards."
folkmetal,3bo6nv,blurbie,6,Wed Jul 1 00:35:51 2015 UTC,"This list was heavily biased against new folk metal.  There's no newer albums, and a lot of older repeat albums that shouldn't be on there.  For instance, why would you have 3-4 Bathory and Primordial albums? It's understandable that they're big, but For The Nameless Dead isn't even folk metal.  They also completely shafted Slavic and Eastern folk metal.  No slavic bands other than Arkona's Goi Rode Goi, which isn't as good as Vo Slavu Velikim or Yav anyway.  Where's Dalriada or any of the plethora of Russian bands?  Why have more Bathory albums than a whole branch of folk metal?  This is a very opinionated list and while it's all good I don't think it's a good essentials list."
folkmetal,3bo6nv,Thallassa,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:53:57 2015 UTC,"Would you mind recommending a list of Slavic/Russian folk metal bands? It can be a bit of a pain to find them and the only one I know of is Arkona.   I think there's so much Bathory because it is also a Viking Metal list (combining Viking and Folk is another questionable decision, but whatever), and Bathory is more important there.   No idea why there's so much Primordial other than to try to appeal to metalheads who don't usually listen to folk."
folkmetal,3bo6nv,blurbie,2,Thu Jul 2 03:10:59 2015 UTC,"I'm not personally as familiar, but here's a thread from 3 months ago about the same thing.  Drudkh at least should definitely be on there, as it's right up the alley of a black/folk list like this."
folkmetal,3bo6nv,Polisskolan2,2,Thu Jul 2 03:28:04 2015 UTC,"I agree with what you're saying, but would you really rate Sahara as their second best album? Even if you'd want one post-reunion album and one pre-reunion album, wouldn't El Norra Alila be a better pick?"
folkmetal,3bo6nv,Thallassa,3,Wed Jul 1 05:34:51 2015 UTC,"I certainly wouldn't rate it as their second best, but this doesn't claim to be a list of the best albums, it claims to be the list of essential albums. Those words mean two different things."
folkmetal,3bo6nv,HMJ87,2,Wed Jul 1 13:00:44 2015 UTC,"Korpiklaani's listed albums are a good example of Folk Metal, i.e. folk and metal in equal measure. Their later albums like Manala and the like are much more folk and much less on the metal side, so they're much more of an acquired taste than a classic folk metal sound like their early stuff."
folkmetal,3bo6nv,Thallassa,3,Wed Jul 1 08:37:44 2015 UTC,"I came into folk metal from the other direction, so I find Manala much more appealing. ;)"
folkmetal,3bo6nv,LadyLilena,8,Wed Jul 1 13:02:02 2015 UTC,"They have a surprising lack of Equilibrium albums and Trollfest?  Also I'm not sure why they listed the bands with different albums.    As for Enslaved - HOW COULD YOU FORGET 793!? On their Eld album 1997.  This is the single most amazing Folk/Viking song IMO if I had to make a list.  Even friends who don't even like metal, love that song.  Also, Summoning.  No Summoning? C'mon..."

Off the top of my head;  Aura by Saor.  Dar De Duh by Dordeduh.  Really anything by Dalriada.  Rastlos by Finsterforst.  Wintersun by Wintersun.

As awful as that exclusion is, if someone is curious enough, they'll find it. (Can confirm.)   This list barely scratches the folk metal genre, there is so much more out there if people are willing to look. It's a good start though."

Check it out: https://youtu.be/EsaTooN-Jtk  Excellent Ukrainian folk metal group. Their later stuff is folkier than their early stuff. They're on Facebook and YouTube, check their metal archives page for links and info. Hope this tickles your fancy"
folkmetal,3bm1gb,666Belphegor,1 point,Tue Jun 30 09:39:37 2015 UTC,"Woah, those vocals are kinda blowing my mind. I've never heard anything like that, is that just what Ukrainian folk singing sounds like? If so, I need to listen to more of it.  Also, how do I pronounce that band name?"
folkmetal,3bm1gb,mattschuette,2,Tue Jun 30 10:07:07 2015 UTC,"Another band with some similarities to those is:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yicTUvDVTHA  No Idea what they sing but sounds quite folkie. ^ That is however the only song I've heard from them atm, getting the discography as i write."
folkmetal,3bm1gb,mattschuette,2,Wed Jul 1 09:56:57 2015 UTC,"It's pronounced 'Sventoyar', and yea I agree the vocals are amazing. I assumed you've already heard Arkona (Аркона) cause they're pretty huge, but if not, you should definitely try them. They're Russian, and their vocalist Masha does some awesome singing. Generally a bit lower pitch than Poloneya, and she does growls too. Her clean vocals are what made me fall in love with her though.   https://youtu.be/BaP1wDvkA6E  Edit: You asked if that's what Ukrainian folk sounds like, and while I'm not an expert, it does seem typical of traditional East Slavic female singing. Unfortunately, I haven't found a huge lot of stuff with vocals just like Sventoyar's. Arkona are great though if you haven't heard them yet. Start with their Goi, Rode, Goi! and Vo Slavu Velikim albums. Might as well also point you towards Dalriada for cool female vocals, though they're Hungarian (not exactly Slavic)   https://youtu.be/ksbkj-dDpJw  Edit 2: Just remembered you mentioned Storm in your OP, and Otyg (Sweden) are very similar:  https://youtu.be/ca6XFP8kau0  Also, Lumsk (Norway) are absolutely phenomenal. Folk/Doom, they sing about Norwegian folk tales. Nice high female vocals. They make my skin crawl. Åsmund Frægdegjevar is my favourite album of theirs, here's the first two songs:  https://youtu.be/Ko97KomKYqI  +1 for Heidevolk, they got me into metal way back when. And I do think their earlier stuff is best, I wear my Saksenland shirt with pride :P  And finally, to go back to your original request, here is a compilation of European metal bands playing traditional songs. All the bands are worth checking out (hint: Primordial's 'To the Nameless Dead' album might be the best thing you ever hear):  https://seasonofmist.bandcamp.com/album/one-and-all-together-for-home  Hope you enjoy"
folkmetal,3bm1gb,NerozumimZivot,2,Wed Jul 1 10:30:08 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, I meant to say ""fuck yeah, Otyg"" in my previous comment. Fuck yeah, Otyg!!"
folkmetal,3bm1gb,Bioquetzal,2,Thu Jul 2 06:15:05 2015 UTC,"Thanks for all the recommendations! Took me a while to get through all of them.  Arkona and Dalriada aren't really my thing. Their singers just don't seem to have much energy or passion and none of the songs I found really stood out to me. Honestly, Sventoyar's albums before [the one iTunes sold me as Unity that probably has a different Russian title] have a similar problem, they're a little better in the energy department, but the music is kind of generic.  I'd heard of Otyg before, since I'm familiar with Vintersorg from Borknagar, but I'd never actually listened to them. And wow, they sound almost exactly like Storm with more folk instruments. I described Heidevolk as Storm-esque upthread, but this is dead on. That is fantastic! I'm definitely grabbing their albums.  Lumsk is really good. Really intense though. I think the biggest problem with doom bands generally is that balance between making something epic and making it not feel overwhelming. Like, I love Ahab, but a whole album from them is usually way too much for me to take. I'll have to listen to more Lumsk before I really figure out how much they're like that.  Honestly, I wasn't a fan of the compilation. Way too heavy on the dirges, the only times those bands really rocked out were when they seemed to have completely forgotten they're on a folk-metal compilation, so even the better slow tracks had a hard time standing out. Haive's songs were pretty good, ""Ukon On Tulinen Turkki"" being an especially welcome change of pace.  I've heard Primordial before, I don't love them, but they're pretty good. I know they can do ""primal rage"" when they want, so their version of The Foggy Dew was especially disappointing. If any folk song needs a pissed-off metal cover, it's that one. I'm frankly shocked that the Young Dubliners' version is still the closest I've heard.  So yeah, thanks again for the suggestions. I've definitely found some good listening material."

Yeah, probably; but they aren't the main reason we made this app. ORE.FM is for the local scene. For bands that aren't on Pandora or Spotify or Itunes; that are looking for a new, inexpensive(free) way to get the word out about their music. That's how I would define 'underground'."

folkmetal,3b6qvl,Sir_Renn,5,Fri Jun 26 12:37:53 2015 UTC,Eluveitie - Everything Remains As It Never Was   They have both male and female vocalists though the woman (edit: Anna Murphy) doesn't sing as often.  Call of the Mountains. Another song with the female vocalist  And one more (Celtos)
folkmetal,3b6qvl,haibane_rakka,3,Fri Jun 26 13:40:06 2015 UTC,"Yea Eluveitie is awesome, I've listened to some of their stuff but hadn't heard Everything Remains as it never was, that one's really fantastic!"
folkmetal,3b6qvl,Oden_son,3,Fri Jun 26 15:21:16 2015 UTC,"I think you'd really enjoy most of Eluveitie's music. They have two full time female musicians (one of violin and one on hurdy gurdy/vocals). The vocals aren't an even split between Anna's clean singing Chrigel's harsh, which I like. The beauty and the best dynamic is way over done, but Eluveitie is probaly about 80% Chrigel's Harsh vocals and 20% Anna's beautiful voice. She also has other bands she sings for and has one of the best voices in metal, male or female."
folkmetal,3b6qvl,haibane_rakka,2,Sun Jun 28 14:16:11 2015 UTC,"I love what she brings to the band. Her voice balances them out so they stand out as a band, and I can't imagine Eluveitie without the hurdy gurdy."

folkmetal,3b6qvl,Oden_son,3,Fri Jun 26 13:19:40 2015 UTC,"Ensiferum has only put out on album I consider bad (Unsung Heroes, with the exception of Celestial Bond and Burning Leaves). They have very different sounds throughout their career, but everything but that one album is AWESOME. Older Ensiferum is a little better with the atmosphere and storytelling, with some amazing lyrics by Jari. Newer Ensiferum, while definitely not inferior in my eyes, is a lot heavier and more intense. The newer Ensiferum's clean singing suffers from the lack of Jari's insane talent, but I actually think Petri has a MUCH better scream."
folkmetal,3b6qvl,vtrickzv,3,Sun Jun 28 14:19:25 2015 UTC,"Some of my favourite Ensiferum songs are Iron, Lai Lai Hei, Sword Chant, Twilight Tavern, and In My Sword I Trust."

Their former vocalist Kriegtalith is female, and she is better than many male black metal singers. The new vocalist is also female, but I do not know if she is any good.  Arkona. This is a Russian folk/black band with a female vocalist, who can both shriek and sing cleanly.  Lunatic Gods. The keyboard player and violinist/support vocalist in this Slovak band are both female. The band plays folk/avant-garde extreme metal.  Silent Stream of Godless Elegy This is a stretch. This Czech band has multiple female members, and plays modern folk/doom. The vocals are mostly clean now, but older albums utilise growls much more."

folkmetal,398es7,brinz1,3,Wed Jun 10 07:13:31 2015 UTC,"I'd wager that maybe two of these are actual shanties, but here goes:   Alestorm, obviously, was mentioned, but you HAVE to go with Barrett's Privateers and Stan Rogers' AMAZING original as a bonus Adorned Brood has a couple just off the top of my head I swear WirrWahr has some that are closer, but here is De Haring because I adore this song Black Messiah has something close, and also something not close but fun A good ol' drinkin' song can't be too far off, I think it's the accordion I'll just leave this here"

Beyond Tyr and maybe Skalmold (not a fan though) I don't think you're gonna find many metal acts with those types of vocals...I wish there were more though.

He did two albums with them - a self-titled, and ""Iron.""  I would label them a bit more folk-oriented and less epic/symphonic than Time I, but they're both fantastic.  I especially like ""Iron,"" which is a notable step up production-wise from the original self-titled."
folkmetal,396rok,VegaLyra,4,Tue Jun 9 18:27:00 2015 UTC,I definitely have checked out both of those already and really quite like them.

folkmetal,3951sr,LordJanas,2,Tue Jun 9 08:58:42 2015 UTC,Any album in particular that you'd recommend?
folkmetal,3951sr,LordJanas,1 point,Tue Jun 9 18:51:33 2015 UTC,They are honestly one of those bands that I love every single release of theirs.    The two favourites though are usually Kivenkataja or Voimasta Ja Kunniasta  I'd probably start with the second (Voimasta Ja Kunniasta) as the first song on the album was the one that made me love them in the first place so you might enjoy it too!
folkmetal,3951sr,MagnusBruce,2,Wed Jun 10 12:49:32 2015 UTC,"As Moonsorrow has already been mentioned I'd suggest Eiswerk. They are pretty varied in terms of their influences, like Equilibrium, but they're also a bit crazy and there's a stronger death metal influence I think.  Still worth a listen though!  I don't think there are many bands that sound quite like Equilbrium, which is part of the reason I like them so much - they are a refreshing change from a genre that sometimes feels saturated with a lot of bands who take a very similar approach to folk metal."

folkmetal,3814wu,majesticscarfripple,4,Mon Jun 1 02:18:46 2015 UTC,"I think it was better than their last album but nothing ""special.""  I personally think the Ensiferum style of music is what I'd call stereotypical folk metal.    I personally found a lot of the songs to be enjoyable but also completely derivative and ""cliche.""  My favourite song on the album,  ""Heathen Horde"" has one of the most boring, predictable instrumental melodies.  It really doesn't seem very inspired.    I personally think at this point in time Wintersun produce far more interesting and original ideas than Ensiferum.  This could come down to the impact Ensiferum has had on the folk metal genre though.  As a long time member of this sub, so many of the underground bands posted write in a style that is recognizably reminiscent of Ensiferum.  As a result, it seems like a lot of the ideas have been done to death."

folkmetal,3814wu,MperorM,3,Wed Jun 3 00:44:22 2015 UTC,I think they are the vocal minority. I think it is great! I just don't think many of the people who enjoyed the album bothered  going to forums about how much they enjoyed the album.

You could also look at the following   Aether Realm, Battlesoul (particularly the album Lay Down Thy Burdens - Oathbreaker, Poet's Path and To The Stars are 3 great songs on that album), early Equilibrium (Turis Fratyr is another masterpiece imo, but Sagas is probably more what you're looking for), Norther's album Death Unlimited is another good bet, anything by Suidakra (especially Crógacht and Caledonia albums), Brymir (if anything just for the song ""Unconquerable), Nothgard is a good one (their first album is another masterpiece of the genre), so is Northland (self-titled album Northland is great, don't think they've released any more yet)  As /u/MagnusBruce says, Wintersun is very Ensiferum and another good bet if you're looking for that sorta stuff."
folkmetal,37mgow,rasdo357,2,Thu May 28 21:36:03 2015 UTC,Major props for mentioning Aether Realm. I fucking love One Chosen by the Gods. Too bad their summer tour with Wilderun and Crimson Shadows isn't coming to Ohio.
folkmetal,37mgow,MeatloafCupcake,2,Fri May 29 12:42:39 2015 UTC,"Some are real gems!   Although others are a tad to much on the symphonic side of things. Kinda overshadows the guitars, not trying to be picky, but I'm really looking for bands that are guitar based instead of keyboard based.  Stuff like Nothgard which is exactly what I want! Really thanks for this one! SuidAkrA has been sitting in my listen-to-later list for a while now "". Northland is also interesting, especially the tone of the vocals and the folkish tunes. Gave Aeather a listen and they aren't that bad either. I'll just have to say goodbye to social life for a couple of days so I can listen through all of these bands.  Thank you!"
folkmetal,37mgow,rasdo357,2,Fri May 29 18:41:19 2015 UTC,"If you're looking on the more melo-death folky side, you should also check Kalmah (particularly newest album and earliest albums). Perhaps Insomnium too?  EDIT: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqBexdo1CME"
folkmetal,37mgow,MagnusBruce,1 point,Sat May 30 16:08:21 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, Equilibrium are fantastic too. I should have mentioned them as I own their entire discography :p  I'd say Turis Fratyr is probably closest to Ensiferum. I think my favourites are Rekreatur and Sagas though I really enjoy all of their albums (and the Waldschrein EP just because of the Skyrim theme)."
folkmetal,37mgow,joelandrews,2,Thu May 28 21:43:39 2015 UTC,"Hmmm... way to epic sounding and not enough folkish. Still thanks.  As for Wintersun, love those guys.  EDIT: Actually The song from wolfchant called revenge is pretty close :D"

folkmetal,37mgow,NerozumimZivot,2,Fri May 29 16:51:18 2015 UTC,"It's worthwhile to investigate Ennio Morricone, the composer for all the iconic Spaghetti Western films, who is a marked inspiration for Ensiferum's folk elements up through about From Afar. I always thought there was something ""cowboy-ish"" about Ensiferum before I was even aware of this fact."
folkmetal,37mgow,dropitonhishead,2,Thu May 28 23:38:44 2015 UTC,Victory Songs is old Ensiferum?  god I feel old!
folkmetal,37mgow,majesticscarfripple,2,Fri May 29 04:20:41 2015 UTC,"Well I did say old ensiferum AND victory songs, because they have a similar sound and the style has really changed after From Afar."
folkmetal,37ldxt,ModernPrimitive01,2,Thu May 28 13:52:27 2015 UTC,I'd hoped that Appalachian folk metal meant something like Eluveite with banjos. Kind of disappointed.

folkmetal,37kbzy,spoon_of_doom,1 point,Thu May 28 18:25:13 2015 UTC,"I suspect the album can go either one of two ways: a historical Narrative of the Rwandan conflict, or a more general discussion on when we go (or should go) to war and issues of humanitarian intervention."

Iske!   I have a strong preference for bands to sing in their native language anyways. It always sounds better to me.   But I can see why more lyrics-oriented people would like to have lyrics they can understand easily. Not everyone is able to learn Finnish just so they can understand all the music they listen to (even if they could just throw the lyrics through google translate, it's not the same)."

Awesome vibe.  As for festivals and concerts with folkmetal I've never seen that or what you describe, only pits, crowdsurfers and rows and rows of headbangers. I vividly remember my first Eluveitie concert. Never heard of them before, but walked into the tent they were playing at on the festival and ended up in a row of headbanging people. So much hair flying around, hah! People high fiving and shaking the hands of total strangers afterwards too, just an awesome shared experience. Love that stuff, such a great vibe."

folkmetal,35fcil,TheGoodFortune,1 point,Sun May 10 14:07:42 2015 UTC,That's really cool. At folk dancing parties I go to it is very ad hoc. There are defined steps but only a few mostly to fit with the timing of the music and people will jump in and out of dancing.   I'd love to see  in more folk music videos people doing folk style dancing that fits the music. This way people will watch the videos try to learn the dance and hopefully do it at concerts together.

(Folk metal in general, not just mittelalter.) And literally there's almost a band for everyone and almost every situation. Drinking songs, epic stuff, cheesy stuff, vikings, medieval, pirates...   That's pretty awesome."

One day I was in a mood for metal so I was looking through different stations on an internet radio service and found Viking metal. I thought it sounded really badass so I gave it a listen and eventually I heard a song by Tyr and fell in love. I looked into it more and found out that viking metal was only the tip of the folk metal iceberg so I checked the whole thing out and loved it. There are some things that I'm not a fan of (for the most part I like clean vocals but I still listen to Ensiferum sometimes.) but over all it's my favorite type of metal now.

They do use growling vocals though."

folkmetal,34jcq8,shockshockshad,4,Fri May 1 17:22:32 2015 UTC,"Ahh, Viter... Probably the most disappointing folk metal band to come out of my Ukraine, in my opinion. I still really dig their first album, but they could have been so, so, so very much more if they kept their original style.  Case in point: Here's a song from their first EP. Plus, their split with Kings & Beggars was fantastic as well. I strongly believe that Viter could easily have been THE best folk metal band from Ukraine, and even among the greats, but alas, it is not to be, it seems."
folkmetal,34jcq8,Agent_Goodwrench,2,Fri May 1 21:30:25 2015 UTC,"Wow, I haven't heard that one yet! I actually equally like both styles, but in terms of quality of folk metal, Krov Tikae is definitely better. The melding of folk and industrial is too unique to not be enjoyable though."
folkmetal,34jcq8,Agent_Goodwrench,2,Fri May 1 21:38:42 2015 UTC,"Make sure to check out the entire EP then.   And here's the split I mentioned. It's full on folk though.  And as I said, I still like their industrial folk (especially since they also released it in Ukrainian, which sounds much better than their English one to me), but I feel like the magic they had in Dzherelo was mostly lost. Unfortunately, we won't hear where else they can take their music since they went their separate ways last year, but I'm still holding onto some hope that they might reform someday, even if it's still industrial folk. Good music is still good music."
folkmetal,34jcq8,pfk505,2,Fri May 1 23:08:59 2015 UTC,I totally agree.. its weird they decided to go in a different direction.  Maybe some personal changes for Viterzgir?  If you look at Kroda now and their new album the two bands could not be more different.
folkmetal,34jcq8,Agent_Goodwrench,1 point,Sat May 2 03:12:06 2015 UTC,"Possibly. Maybe he wanted to try his hand at something a little more (god, I hate that word) mainstream.

Overall as a band I'd say they probably fall more in the doom category, but they go fairly folky on some tracks.  These guys are another doomy group (also from Sweden) that drop some folk in the mix and sound damn good doing it.  Again I'm not quite sure how well either fits with the idea of a folky version of Sleep.  for that you might be better off with Agalloch in their doomy moments, but these guys are both worth a listen and then some."

Amorphis doesn't necessarily fit exactly to the ""Viking Metal"" or Folk Metal genres as their production spans a couple of decades so there's a lot of different styles there, but their lyrics at least are heavily influenced by Finnish folk traditions, especially Kalevala.  Pride in own people's folk traditions can often go hand in hand with nationalistic tendencies, so that might be what you noticed about some folk metal enthusiasts being a little reticent towards other cultures.  edit: O yea, Finns raided Vikings too, that went both ways. For instance there's at least one account of Ragnar Lodbroks father being preoccupied with Finns/Kvens raiding Sweden. Plus, there's quite a bit of Viking swords in here without having any Viking settlements so I don't know..maybe unsuccessful Viking raids to Finland? At least a couple of written accounts about those. :)"

There's also plenty of medieval style bands: In Extremo, Saltatio Mortis, Subway to Sally, Corvus Corax, Cultus Ferox to name a few.

folkmetal,33nlkb,joelandrews,5,Fri Apr 24 01:42:14 2015 UTC,"Yep, I think you can use Anglo Saxon and Old English more or less interchangeably to describe the language spoken in England before the Norman conquest. and it's virtually unintelligible to modern English speakers. I know a few words because of reasons but I understand that around a half dozen or so academics can speak it conversationally. I have witnessed two people speaking it in casual conversation once. It was strange.  Back to the thread, Forefather have a few songs in Old/Middle English (like Miri It Is which is a traditional song) or partially in Old English.  In Extremo have done enough old traditional songs in dead languages, the only one that springs to mind right now is Ave Maria in Latin but I expect there'll be others.  Some Falkenbach lyrics are in a nearly dead dialect of German that I can't remember the name of. Not quite dead, but close.  AEthelruna are not quite folk metal but I think all of his songs are in Anglo Saxon. His version of Det Som Engang Var is divine."

English largely grew up from the West Saxon dialect/language from what I recall. The other kingdoms which formed from various Angle, Saxon and Jute groups had their own variations. So if someone was to mention Anglo-Saxon language to me rather than Old English I would envision more the broad group rather than the slightly more cohesive Old English. But then I'm no Professor Tolkien and am likely complete and utterly wrong."

Not exactly folk but is awesome nonetheless. Alcest - Souvenirs D'un Autre Monde (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTM9x-fEMwo)  If you like black metal, then you'll probably like Caladan Brood. They blend awesome folk/fantasy elements with atmospheric black metal to create an epic sound. Caladan Brood - Wild Autumn Wind (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVBT4GmslsQ)  That's some stuff that immediately came to mind. Let me know what you think of the bands/songs! Enjoy!"
folkmetal,33jv05,Euphantius,3,Sat Apr 25 01:22:25 2015 UTC,"Equilibrium - symphonic folk metal.  I'd be surprised if you haven't already heard them considering their popularity in the folk metal world, but if you haven't then you're in for a treat.  Here's Uns'rer Flöten Klang from their latest album, Erdentempel.  That album plus their second, Sagas, are two of my favorite albums of all time. Moonsorrow - ""Blackened""-folk, generally longer-length (7+ minutes) songs .  Here's Huuto from their latest album, Varjoina Kuljemme Kuolleiden Maassa, and overall one of their best songs.  Worth looking into if you like Agalloch.  For albums, I'd recommend Verisäkeet as my favorite, but they're all very good. Finsterforst - also ""blackened""-folk, with great use of accordion and symphonic elements -- somewhat like a mix of Moonsorrow and Turisas.  Here's Mach Dich Frei, the title track from their latest album, which is excellent.  The album prior to it, Rastlos, is also fantastic. Skálmöld - folk metal from Iceland.  Some symphonic elements and they're big on concept albums.  Here's Kvaðning  from their first album, Baldur -- this recording is from a concert that they did with the Iceland Symphony Orchestra and it's a really kickass show.  I'm not the biggest fan of their harsh vocals, but they have some excellent songs and are well worth diving into.  They have three albums, and I'd recommend Baldur. Fejd - folk metal without distorted guitars or harsh vocals.  Traditional Norwegian folk instruments with keyboard, bass, and drums that makes something pretty unique while still being very heavy.  Here's Drangen och Krakan from their second album, Eifur.  They have three albums, but they don't vary too much so I don't have a specific recommendation."

Nolwenn Leroy - Tri Martolod - Not folk metal at all but beautiful bag pipes  Faun - not metal but I think you'll enjoy them  And here is the list of some great folk metal bands I always keep around just to be picky :)  Svartsot  Turisas  Metsatöll  Running Wild  Аркона  Einherjer  Ásmegin  Windir  Wolfchant  Borknagar  Helrunar  Burzum  Falkenbach  Skálmöld  Týr  Obtest  Skyforger  Moonsorrow  Thyrfing  Månegarm  Heidevolk  Menhir

folkmetal,33k2mw,the1wingedangel,5,Thu Apr 23 05:14:54 2015 UTC,"As I know it, you just have the definition of folk, so folk music can come from outside Europe."
folkmetal,33k2mw,smorgasbordator,4,Thu Apr 23 04:19:20 2015 UTC,"I think that a band should not try and be the ""folk"" of a country that they are not actually the folk of, if that makes sense. In my personal opinion, I don't agree with say, a band from Spain emulating a Viking  metal band. One of the little bands I hold close to my heart is Thrawsunblat, which is a Canadian folk metal band from New Brunswick, and their folk influences are definitely genuine and definitely fit well with the music."
folkmetal,33k2mw,melisebain,2,Thu Apr 23 06:20:32 2015 UTC,"Ah, this was another thing I had also wanted to discuss. I can definitely understand why, for example, a Brazilian band that would write songs about Odin, Valhalla and Vikings while donning Viking garb as part of their band persona seem a little odd. Granted, there have been bands that have done that very well(Whispered comes to mind; a Band from Finland going for Japanese-themed folk metal) and show how convincing they are at emulating the ""sound"" of another nationality.  With all that said, I personally think ""Folk"" is not bound by one's national identity."
folkmetal,33k2mw,melisebain,1 point,Thu Apr 23 06:42:57 2015 UTC,"National identity as in where their passport is from? I would agree with that. If everyone in a band is born in Finland, but all of them, or even just the primary song writers have say, more of a Finno-Swede background, then I think it would be fine for them to go a more Swedish-Vikingy route.   (I'll be honest with you, a lot of the time with nordic/viking metal for me it boils down to ""Does where you live have winters cold enough to sing about the bleakness of winter? No? Then I'm out. But I'm a judgemental shitty person)."
folkmetal,33k2mw,YogurladoMaldito,1 point,Thu Apr 23 06:47:25 2015 UTC,"Oh I agree with you. If a band's theme is about the horrifying coldness of eternal permafrost, then they had better be from a place that has the horrifying coldness of eternal permafrost. Otherwise it would be really out of place to sing about that when the band lives in a tropical country.  BUT if they can put on a very convincing performance, then I have no problems with them singing about whatever they want."
folkmetal,33k2mw,melisebain,4,Thu Apr 23 07:00:51 2015 UTC,"So, by this line of reasoning, a band should only sing about battles if they have actually been in one, right? Honestly I don't see why people shouldn't make music inspired by a culture they don't belong to. As long as it is well done, I don't care about the origin of who makes it.  I'll agree that nordic culture and folklore has been a really popular and already overused theme in metal. But this applies to all the bands, either nordic or not."

folkmetal,33k2mw,LordJanas,2,Wed Jul 22 15:22:56 2015 UTC,"I see it in the same sense as folk. I grew up listening to my father taste in both Celtic and New England folk music. You can't just say that only the Celtic areas can be allowed to call it folk. It ain't champagne wine where it can only come from one place.  When it comes to folk metal I've heard a few bands here in the US and I've heard many across Europe and Asia. I bet a little searching you could find some folk metal in South America and Africa. I think it is a type of genre that is great because in my own opinion folk music is an anti-xenophobic genre. Where you can definitely get to hear music styles, instruments, poems/lyrics that are from that area."
folkmetal,33k2mw,DXCharger,2,Thu Apr 23 10:08:55 2015 UTC,"Folk is just a title for the genre.  Folk metal implies the use of traditional instruments (from any culture) within a metal line up.    It just so happens that a lot of ""Folk metal"" is played in a European style.    As for ""non-Europeans"" playing Folk metal, I see no problem.  It's like claiming white people can't play the blues.  I mean if you were really being pedantic, most of us could trace our heritage back to European cultures."

folkmetal,33k2mw,TreeHuggerGuy96,1 point,Thu Apr 23 07:34:33 2015 UTC,"I personally believe lyrical content is not a genre identifier.  Singing about folk tales doesn't make a song folk unless they incorporate the actual musical style.

folkmetal,33etbx,ZombineTM,10,Tue Apr 21 23:05:37 2015 UTC,"Viking metal is a bit of a vague term. Some people use it just to refer to lyrics and themes, some to the sound. This presents ambiguity in trying to find bands with a sound you like. I use it to refer to music that's not quite folk and not quite extreme metal - bands like Bathory, Thrudvagner, Windir, Manegarm, Wrath of Fenrir etc. I don't really associate it with traditional instruments (although Manegarm used to have a fiddler).  That said, there's plenty of folk metal bands with traditional instruments - here's a partial list. I've included some bands that have nothing to do with  Nordic history or culture because they're awesome and you might like them:   Ensiferum (as session musicians) (Finland) Arkona (Russia) Turisas (early) (Finland) Otyg (Sweden) Finsterforst (Germany) Lumsk (Norway) Heidevolk (Netherlands) Martolea (more black metal but fantastic use of pipes) (Romania) Moonsorrow (Finland) Mael Mordha (very doomy) (Ireland) Cruachan (Ireland) Eluveitie (Switzerland) Metsatoll (Estonia) Dalriada (Hungary) Skiltron (Argentina)   You might also like some acoustic bands like:   Steeleye Span (England) Folque (Norway) Neun Welten (Germany) Nest (Finland) Wardruna (Norway) Tenhi (Finland)"
folkmetal,33etbx,ECM,3,Wed Apr 22 02:49:03 2015 UTC,"I absolutely adore Slavonic folk metal as much as viking itself, i'm even learning a little bit of Ukrainian and Russian together with Icelandic.  May i just ask what is the relationship with Norse and Slavic metal bands?  On YouTube i see that they're very friendly with each other since Nordic folk playlists also include Slavonic ones too, but, it sorta seems to have some kind of ""battle"" between Vikings and Slavs, sorta like Metal and Nü-Metal are having, just a ""battle of the bands"" just for fun, nothing of ""My music is better than yours"", just a fun game of Norse and Slav warriors battling each other in Asgard and Сваро́гъ using their instruments as swords and shields, does this happens sometimes?"
folkmetal,33etbx,ECM,3,Wed Apr 22 18:32:20 2015 UTC,"Well, historically VIkings did raid and settle Slavic lands, all the way down to Constantinople (where some Danes became the elite Varangian Guard for some time). So there's 1000+ years of history between the Nordic and Slavic countries. Finland in particular was a Grand Duchy of Russia throughout the 19th century, until the end of WWI.  The music is also complementary. While a particular European country might have distinctive local music, there's been a lot of cultural mixing over the centuries. Consider that the Celts and the Slavs both have pipes. I love folk music from all around the world and I love folk metal from all around the world.  I'm pretty sure very few bands use their instruments as literal weapons."
folkmetal,33etbx,Agent_Goodwrench,1 point,Wed Apr 22 23:10:55 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I very rarely notice any sort of animosity between fans of different folk metal genres. If there's a battle going on it's the eternal one about whether a band in question is truly ""metal"".  And since you seem like you might be interested, might I recommend you take a look at Veremiy and Grai.    Veremiy kinda veer between folk metal and folk rock sometimes, but they sing (cleanly) entirely in Ukrainian, and just make great music in general, so they could use more loving.   Grai sing in Russian and are just groovy as fuck with the soulful female vocals and folk melodies."

folkmetal,33etbx,GoblinTechies,3,Sat Apr 25 02:08:08 2015 UTC,Forefather is an Anglo-saxon themed band with a mix of some songs with clean vocals and traditional instruments. Not really what you asked for but its very traditional/folk.  Drudkh  I found a nice list of folk bands. Scroll down and look for bands with Genre:Black metal and Influences: Black metal and see what you like.  I'm having a tough time finding bands that are as heavy/harsh and folk instruments like what you linked.
folkmetal,33etbx,NerozumimZivot,3,Tue Apr 21 23:37:22 2015 UTC,"I'm going to be that asshole who points out spelling issues. ""Výkingr"" really isn't correct, despite ""ý"" and ""í"" having the same sound. I've never seen it spelled the way you have in the title, whether in modern Icelandic or Old Icelandic/Norse.  Also, it's no small wonder that it's hard to find music with traditional instruments from the North - most of the music seems to have been purely vocal, with some foot-stamping for percission like in the vikivaki or sláiðhringar.  Now, on to a couple of recommendations:   Krauka uses some traditional instruments, but the music isn't very traditional aside from the lyrical themes. More acoustic with a bit of funk.  Fortíð is an older Icelandic/Norwegian viking/black metal band. Their version of Krummavisur is pretty darn good, but doesn't use the instruments you're looking for.  Hrafnagaldur is another Icelandic band that uses purely traditional instruments. They have done covers of metal songs as well as Icelandic and Faroese folk songs. Due to the nature of the instruments, the music isn't metal-sounding. No guitars, no drum kit. They're a lot of fun live, though!  You've likely heard them before, but Skálmöld is the big Icelandic juggernaut of Viking metal right now.They only use a few traditional instruments to accent the regular guitar/keyboard/drums/bass combo. However, they are extremely strict on types of melodies and poetic structures in their lyrics. Seriously, just take a look at Sorg. It can be read backwards and forwards, retaining rhyme, meaning and metre in both directions. That takes some serious skill."
folkmetal,33etbx,MagnusBruce,0,Wed Apr 22 13:06:05 2015 UTC,"Hah, i know, ""ý"" is almost never used, i just wrote it to look more ""traditional"", hence why i sometimes write ""Æšgærð"" just to look the maximum as ""ancient"" as possible, since Runes aren't used anymore and not all PCs can handle it (mine for example, the Wikipedia page on Old Norse displays these letter error cubes)."
folkmetal,33etbx,NerozumimZivot,1 point,Wed Apr 22 18:26:42 2015 UTC,"Hate to tell you, but it doesn't look ancient in the least. Just looks like a ton of errors.

You're inventing sound changes that never existed within the grammatical system, and it just ends up looking dumb. Seriously, the word you've made up would be said ""Eyesh-geyerth."" Not even remotely comprehensible.   Stick with the proper spelling, it's already ancient! Icelandic has barely changed at all since Snorri Sturluson wrote down the myths."

I'm wanting patches like the amon amarth one for this, not the standard rectangular, band logo, shield, star, squiggly blob, I'm not bothered so long as it's folk metal or a folk metal crossover with another genre."

folkmetal,31v89z,Laxerboy379,6,Sat Apr 11 03:03:52 2015 UTC,"Yes. So far every folk metal concert I have been to have been a little different. Alestorm was a lot of arms over each other's shoulders, swaying to shanties like Nancy the Tavern Wench. Eluvaitie was more typical mish stuff (jumping and shoving. They also did a wall of death) but there was some attempts at what I assume was folk dancing. Korpiklaani was the most folk as far s the pit was concerned. Lots of linking arms and skipping in circles as well as a circle dance and some other stuff. Every other concert has just been a variation of those. It's always a lot of fun."
folkmetal,31v89z,Polisskolan2,4,Wed Apr 8 19:53:14 2015 UTC,"There was some weird dancing ""mosh pit"" when I saw Korpiklaani. I highly doubt whatever they were doing had anything to do with any real folk dances though."

folkmetal,31v89z,Progharmon,2,Fri Apr 10 00:01:52 2015 UTC,"At the moment it's just me :( I've asked people to join but they're all in pretty established bands and can't commit the time. Because it's all me at the moment I play everything so drums, guitars, bass, vocals. I've recently picked up mandolin which I have used before on a song but I got a new one which is much nicer. I usually get my folk elements from keyboards but I'm thinking of getting myself a tin whistle and maybe recruiting a friend who plays violin/fiddle and guitar.  If you didn't guess from the morris dancing, I'm from England so I tend to stick to influence from English folk music which is, unfortunately, not as fun or jumpy as a lot of Irish, Scottish or Welsh music. Having said that, I have done a cover of a traditional Scottish song and plan to cover a pseudo-traditional Welsh folk song. Lyrically I seem to focus on the Roman Conquest of Britain but that's not intentional but I don't want to fall into the stereotype of writing about Vikings or Anglo Saxons. There's so much more to English history than the Dark Age!  I've not done much with the project recently as I've started up a bit of an atmospheric black metal thing with a couple of friends."
folkmetal,31v89z,Progharmon,2,Fri Apr 10 16:01:21 2015 UTC,One of my fondest gigging memories was when I went to Finntroll in my kilt. Found another dude in the mosh wearing one and we linked arms and spun to En Maktig Har.

Its quite different from their first album, so I'll not lie that I was caught off guard.   Having been listening to it for the better part of the week now, I love it. Where their first one was a little more on the upbeat side of things, this is slower, sadder, and more thoughtful.   I'm going to be reviewing it for my blog, actually, and am in talks with them for an interview sometime soon."

folkmetal,30rhjz,kingfrito_5005,1 point,Mon Mar 30 03:59:38 2015 UTC,"Wait... what? Someone from faun left for schandmaul? Who was it? (I know Elisabeth Pawelke left... I'm not sure about schandmaul though, unless it's a different singer from faun...)  On faun though, I think they sound fine with either of the singers. (I only know of Elisabeth and... the new one I think her name is Katja?) It's kind of nice their music isn't  so... for lack of a word... dark.  Edit -TIL faun fans and nightwish fans have something in common. Never thought I would say that. Just my two cents, no offense."
folkmetal,30rhjz,loudmuteswan,2,Mon Mar 30 20:25:45 2015 UTC,"Birgit Muggenthaler left for schandmaul but that was forever ago and now that Im looking into dates, it was in fact Elisabeth Pawelke leaving that made their music less awesome (IMO).That being said, I rescind my original point entirely now that I noticed that she was not there for Von Den Elben, which I personally consider their best album."

I'll start with folk albums from metal bands.  Arkona released a compilation of their acoustic folk songs for free online, called Akustika. Drudkh has ""Songs of Grief and Solitude,"" but it is mainly the folk melodies from their metal songs, taken and made into folk songs. Ulver has that one folk album, Kveldssanger.  Svarga has a folk album- Krov'-Reka, a live acoustic album- Vetry proschayut vsyo, and a few collaboration folk singles. 1 2 3  Do you know Fejd?  Shedda. Svarica. Jar. [:TEUFELSTANZ:]  Leidungr, they have an EP and a full length. 1 2  Veter Vody and Vedan Kolod are also nice.  Maybe not what you want, but Otava yo has a nice style and you can get most of their music for free online (legally, I mean).  Again, not really what you what, but I love Melnitsa. 1 2  I know there's a lot I'm forgetting- sorry if these aren't what you wanted.  Definitely not what you're asking for, but in case you're interested in more different folk/folk rock =p : Jaromír Nohavica - Těšínská | Brathanki - Siebie dam po ślubie | Golec uOrkiestra - Pędzą konie   Kalevala also has a live folk album I quite enjoy.  I could list way more since that person was asking for a specific style of folk, but I am lazy. Hopefully this is a start at least :)"

folkmetal,30kpxj,kakatoru,8,Mon Mar 30 20:26:36 2015 UTC,"Tyr in Danish  More Tyr in Danish  Tyr in Faroese  Tyr is from Faroese Islands but they are also part of Denmark. Many of their songs are from old folk songs telling tales of various sagas re-arranged into metal. They sing in English, Danish and Faroese.  On the topic of Japan, folk metal largely does not exist in Japan for whatever reason. The only Japanese band that could be called ""folk metal"" is 陰陽座 (Onmyou-za) but more recent music from them is no longer ""folk"". Several of their songs have been used in anime even. This may be in part because Japan never ""lost"" its ancient ethnicity in many senses as compared to many european countries that got taken over by Roman Catholicism so Japanese culture ""classics"" are roughly equivalent to ""folk"" in other cultures as it was never erased. Up until World War 2 their country had never been occupied by outside invaders unlike most of the rest of the world (at least in the sense that the current Japanese were invaders themselves of the native Ainu people who have largely been culturally erased). Also unlike many European countries, Japan is rather ethnically ""pure"" as they've had very little interbreeding even genetically for thousands of years with western cultures despite being very western at first glance.  To drive home that point, Japan still has plenty of active ""folk"" music troupes. Metal by its construct is not folk so they're so ""folk"" that they don't even use metal for their folk. Traditional Japanese music elements are embedded into many many modern Japanese music.  Here's some Japanese ""Irish"" sounding folk Japanese music. Collage - Dohbutsu no Kohshin   Waggakki Band - Tengaku  Traditional Japanese Music These are all actively practiced all over Japan despite being ""folk""."

There are also bands like Bellfast that play music people more commonly associate with folk metal (ie, celtic/viking influences)."

Some suggestions that no one has brought up yet:   Orphaned Land (Middle eastern folk metal, lyrics in many different kinds of languages. In this case Hebrew and Arabic.) Oathean (Korean band that typically sings in ""English"", but uses the Haegeum a lot on their earlier (and better) records. Example. Here is a song with Korean lyrics. Their best album if you're into folk stuff, The Last Desperate 10 Years As Ever, can't be found on youtube.) Jambinai (A Korean band. Not really a metal band, but lots of metal influences. It's instrumental, but they use lots of different Korean traditional instruments. The Firstborn (A Portoguese band, but they make use of various Indian instruments, like the sitar.) Kranium (Peruvian folk metal. Lots of flutes and stuff. This song has some lyrics in Quechua.) Wardruna (A Norwegian band, but might still be of interest as they use many unusual instruments.

folkmetal,3048li,I_ABUSED_YOUR_CHAIR,1 point,Sun Mar 29 20:20:16 2015 UTC,"Turisas was pretty good but a lot of people have no idea what the band is about. Mathias was a massive showman/showoff as always, but I think it fits the theme.  It's a shame they don't have their own accordeonist at the moment since Netta left the band and is now touring with Ensiferum. (whose new album and tour awesome, they played later that week in my hometown)  Korpiklaani's accordeonist stepped in for one song but he was terrible and got practically everything wrong.  The setlist was pretty good and surprisingly long, good variety between old and new songs. I also liked the new album whilst many people didn't, they'd probably prefer Turisas to keep playing Battle Metal forever, which gets boring real fast.  personally I would have traded in It's a Sin for Rasputin, party guaranteed.  the backdrop is amazing though, the whole band as Byzantine kings, knights and saints. It's also massive, didn't quite fit the stage.  Heidevolk on the other hand was a massive letdown, partially due to a replacement vocalist that night. The new album is so generic it could have been any band and the same goes for the show."

folkmetal,3048li,lord_sorek,5,Wed Mar 25 03:26:46 2015 UTC,"It's a song by Normaal (covered by Heidevolk) about a prehistoric man (Vulgaris Magistralis) living in present day. He likes to do his own things, hunting, cooking on a working volcano, etc. He rides a mammoth during weekdays, but on Sundays on a mastodon.   Something thats more clear in the original is that the outside world is slowly getting aware of him, and that movie directors like Spielberg want to have him in a movie. But all Vulgaris really wants to do is ""work the females with his club"".  It's really hard to translate as the song only just makes sense."

folkmetal,30108e,metalpub,1 point,Sun Mar 29 19:18:47 2015 UTC,"No I don't hate them; I just find their style of music to be ""stereotypical"" folk metal.    A lot of new bands end up imitating the Ensiferum style, while at the same time Ensiferum themselves seem to go over the same themes and musical ideas again and again leading to little diversity.  I definitely enjoy their earlier stuff, but even then I find Wintersun to be a breath of fresh air with its Japanese influences and what I consider to be better use of orchestration and choirs."

I've been struggling to find a good metal song for our first dance (I'd really like it to be a metal song because metal has been a big part of our lives). However, all the good metal love songs are about star-crossed lovers and all the happy metal love songs are kinda cheesy. I'm wanting either Sonata Arctica's ""Love"" or the Kotipelto & Liimatainen cover of My Selene for either our first or last dance, respectively. The boyfriend says Love is too cheesy but other than that it is damn near perfect: Right length, speed and if I'm counting it right I think it's in 3/4, so waltz-able. I think he's secretly trying to make me go insane with wedding planning.

I thought I could rely on it popping up in my news feed on facebook but evidently not. Still I am thrilled :'D"
folkmetal,2yao66,ShitArchonXPR,2,Sun Mar 8 01:34:26 2015 UTC,I have come to the conclusion that they play better celtic folk metal than Cruachan does.  Cruachan has no consistency when it comes to quality.
folkmetal,2yao66,ShitArchonXPR,1 point,Mon Mar 9 15:11:56 2015 UTC,Oh definitely. I've not heard much of Cruachan but Furor are exceptional!
folkmetal,2yao66,ShitArchonXPR,1 point,Mon Mar 9 18:11:23 2015 UTC,"""Ride On"" was one of Cruachan's low points, if you need context.  It was boring and not metal--unsurprisingly, Irish radio loved it."
folkmetal,2y4pgt,Fintrolled,7,Fri Mar 6 12:39:03 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure both of those songs are in the Phrygian Dominant scale, which has a distinctly Middle-Eastern sound."
folkmetal,2y4pgt,TRAIANVS,4,Fri Mar 6 12:49:36 2015 UTC,"I assume you're talking about the bridge in the middle of Haxbrygd. That bit is just in the fifth mode of G harmonic minor. There's an augmented second in that scale (between the Eb and the F#), which is fairly uncommon in western music. I understand why it sounds eastern, though- the instrumentation has a lot to do with that."
folkmetal,2y4pgt,TheChurchofHelix,3,Sat Mar 7 05:57:07 2015 UTC,Ett Norrskensdad reminds me of the traditional nordic folk music called Polska. Example of Finnish Polska
folkmetal,2y4pgt,IT_Viking,2,Sat Mar 7 10:47:22 2015 UTC,It's pretty interesting how similar they sound though
folkmetal,2y4pgt,IT_Viking,1 point,Sat Mar 7 15:12:27 2015 UTC,Perhaps it is due to the kind of instruments be pretty similar? I hadn't even made the connection before you pointed it out to be honest.

folkmetal,2xnvt3,UnlostHorizon,7,Mon Mar 2 12:41:20 2015 UTC,"Hope you enjoyed the show! Austin was a pretty wild last night of tour :)  Other influences were Turisas, Korpiklaani, and Rhapsody. Maybe a few other bands here and there, but I had a very limited musical taste. However, since those bands have all recently started turning out crap albums that disappear up their own arseholes, these days they're more of a reference for ""what not to do"" :)  Oh, also our original guitarist (Gavin) was an alexi laiho fanboy, I guess that found its way into some of our guitar parts too."
folkmetal,2xnvt3,hyperchrisz,2,Mon Mar 2 14:37:12 2015 UTC,You're right about it being a wild show. I'm just shocked you guys were able to cope so well with the copious softcore porno on the televisions. And I hope you weren't too freaked out by that overzealous girl in the front who kept grabbing you.  And thanks for giving me some influences! It'll help tremendously on my assignment.
folkmetal,2xnvt3,hyperchrisz,3,Tue Mar 3 10:27:49 2015 UTC,The one who simulated oral sex on our bass player? Yeah that was...unusual.  Happy to help!

folkmetal,2xnvt3,ECM,2,Mon Mar 2 12:44:55 2015 UTC,"I reckon you'll struggle to find any scholarly articles on metal, let alone folk metal. Interviews with bands would be a good place to start. There's a documentary called 'Pagan Metal' by Bill Zebub. It's a collection of interviews with several big bands in the folk/pagan/viking metal scene (Primordial, Turisas, Korpiklaani, Ensiferum and others). You should be able to find a rip floating around the internet. You might also find the Turisas documentary 'A Finnish Summer with Turisas' interesting.  I'm not sure how to source this, but it's pretty clear that the folk metal community is complementary to various neopagan scenes; I'd consider embracing and celebrating old traditions to be a significant social movement. You could probably discuss how people marry tradition with a modern lifestyle and compare this to marrying traditional melodies and ethnic instruments to modern music."
folkmetal,2xnvt3,Yours_and_mind_balls,1 point,Fri Mar 6 00:59:38 2015 UTC,Thanks for those suggestions. Those will help tremendously! I'll definitely check out some works on neopaganism.

folkmetal,2x7gev,Antikristus,5,Fri Feb 27 08:15:35 2015 UTC,I heard something along those lines too.  coarse song to play doesn't sound too far fetched so I'd go with that until further confirmation.

folkmetal,2x7gev,Antikristus,2,Sun Mar 29 18:50:15 2015 UTC,"it's just a sound. Usually affiliated with a trumpet or other horn-like instruments. Töttöröö is sometimes used as a ""derp""-equivalent.  In this case it's just a random sound. Why? Because it's a bonus song.   Tötterö however is a cone."

folkmetal,2wqw8x,Fintrolled,1 point,Fri Mar 6 12:33:21 2015 UTC,"This isn't exactly folk metal. You may want to look for soundtracks, such as the Lord of the Rings soundtrack, that have a similar ""epic"" sound.   Gloryhammer and Ensiferum probably come close. Ensiferum has more ""growly"" songs but their non-growly songs are pretty close."

It's Finnish but very catchy. There is an English version if it that I recommend avoiding  Under the Sun Tequila Happy Little Boozer Ievan Polkka (also Finnish but catchy, again, avoid English version)  They're a very party / fun band.  Ensiferum is more about battle and Viking stuff.

folkmetal,2w6y6f,Fallbourn,3,Tue Feb 17 17:18:09 2015 UTC,"Elvenking is a pretty good metal band, and very fantasy-based. Somewhat light on the folk though - just a violin and some acoustic guitars for parts of songs. I'd recommend anything off ""The Pagan Manifesto"", especially Witches Gather."
folkmetal,2w6y6f,loudmuteswan,2,Tue Feb 17 21:30:28 2015 UTC,"In Extremo is an acquired taste, I like one or two of their songs (Vollmund, Vanera vrende I can't spell...) but it's sad to say that their lead singer sounds better as a guest vocalist on other band's songs. (He gets like, one tiny verse in Faun's ""Bundes Volk"" and totally wins... at that verse. He also wins on his cameo on a live clip of Schandmaul's ""Willst Du"".)   Speaking of, they are very much not metal, but Faun. I'm not sure how he'll like it but they make good music. ""Blaue Stunde"" has a guest male singer who's name I can't remember. Faun is wonderful, but not metal. (I'm not sure exactly if Fiona plays bagpipes, it kind of blurs together with the hurdy gurdy sometimes.)  I don't think Subway To Sally have bagpipes in their music.Crunchy is how I describe them.They are part of an offshoot of folk metal called mitteralter/medieval metal/rock (Faun is a non-metal part of this genre).I'm not sure how well the lead singer's voice will go over if he didn't like In Extremo.  I'm really out of the loop with folk metal, didn't listen to it for well over a year (not my choice). So what little serious folk metal I remember is stuck in summer 2010, even that's a little blurry. (Oddly enough I got into all the medieval stuff via Eluveitie.)  One last thing: I have found quite a few new bands to listen to via streaming radio. Base a station on a band he likes and see if he finds anything else he likes from that."

Imo, they all fit very well in a metal playlist as their sound and themes fit very well with Folk Metal and they provide an interlude between face melting songs.

folkmetal,2w6y6f,cookinshithatingshit,1 point,Thu Feb 19 10:48:50 2015 UTC,"He's pretty eclectic - which is to say that he goes through phases where he listens to a genre vastly different from the previous one, and then gets bored with it and starts looking for new things. We've been through a Disturbed/Godsmack phase, a pop phase, a broody goth phase, a country-and-western phase (that one was particularly trying for yours truly), a Celtic/New Age phase which casually blended into a neopagan phase (which - some of those guys are amazing artists, but then you have stuff like Moonstruck, which he inexplicably couldn't get enough of but which, to me, sounded like cats having their paws stepped on, repeatedly....) There was an 80s phase (actually that one comes and goes quite a big, because nostalgia) and even a very brief rap phase. And so on."

The songs Defiant Dreams and Pair Daedeni are pretty technical but they aren't exactly viking metal. They're a German pagan band and the album those two songs are on is written about Roman history.  Also, Folkstone, Enslaved and Borknagar might come pretty close to what you're looking for."

Progressing from there, I've picked up several bands I really enjoy.  I'm a pretty big history buff, so music that blends the sounds and stories of Pre-Christian (and in some cases Pre-Roman) cultures just fascinates me, and in some cases has been a jumping off point to learn more about these cultures."
folkmetal,2tbrla,rsayers,6,Thu Jan 22 21:51:03 2015 UTC,"It's hard to tell why, but I can tell you who.   First there was korpikaani, then alestorm, then I think it was Turisas, and so on.

folkmetal,2tbrla,WTFbeast,6,Thu Jan 22 22:14:35 2015 UTC,"Ensiferum in 2001. It was actually the first thing I ever bought from the Internet - bought the album off of the spinefarm.fi website with my dad's credit card (I was still in high school; I gave him the cash for it, don't worry). I remember both of us being so worried about giving the Internet our credit information.  Originally heard 'Token of Time' on ""the metal channel"" in 2001. This was when we first got digital cable and they had all those extra music channels. It was like channel 511.  Later that year I discovered Skyclad, which I found to be a lot more folky than Ensiferum and I really, really liked that sound. I've been hooked ever since."

folkmetal,2tbrla,loudmuteswan,2,Fri Jan 23 16:53:13 2015 UTC,"I can't remember, I do remember being blown away by Eluveitie. Inis Mona had just... wow. I have listened to all kinds of folk metal, but it's kind of a blur.  As for now... medieval. Mittelalter? (Can't spell, sorry.) I haven't been listening to much else than Subway To Sally (who I probably found via Eluveitie Radio on some streaming service), Saltatio Mortis, In Extremo... I'm not sure if Faun counts.  I can't take harsh growls as well as I used to, so I don't listen to as much folk metal as there is out there now. I love how diverse the cultures in folk metal are though (like the folk aspect of it).   Edit: type Eluveitie into any streaming radio service. (Like base a station off of Eluveitie music.) The amount of bands I have found this way is incredible.  Edit 2: I joke that I like anything with bagpipes, hurdy gurdy or both."
folkmetal,2tbrla,Lupyr,2,Tue Feb 3 21:34:55 2015 UTC,"I first listened to Eluveitie's Your Gaulish War when that was the song playing over a youtube video about Paganism 3 years ago. I loved it and I wanted to know what the band is that made it. I searched in the comments and someone said it was Eluveitie. So I searched them up and I didn't know that this kind of music existed. I was't a metal fan at all to begin with and I was going through a phase when I listened to country and Dubstep (I was in middle school guys). At first I couldn't get Chrigel's growls but I gradually accepted them as the vast majority of Eluveitie's songs featured them. I then found bands like Finntroll and Arkona and Ensiferum. Because Eluveitie was my first metal band they are my perpetual favorite band alongside Finntroll as Nifelvind is one of my favorite albums of all time.   Because I've not really have heard any recent Folk Metal that has blown me away, I've gotten into other metal sub genres like Norwegian Black Metal with bands like Gorgoroth, Dimmu Borgir, Tsjuder, Taake, Carach Angren, and Opera IX. The only Folk Metal band that has come close to Finntroll and Eluveitie would be Munarheim and their cover song The Last Unicorn and their recent song Nachtmelodie. I'm sorry to say that I'm not really into Folk Metal that I used to as Folk Metal is not as visceral and terrifying as pure Black Metal. I'm just saying that I feel more energy watching a video of Black Mass Krakow 2004 than a video of Paganfest."
folkmetal,2tbrla,boognish83,1 point,Fri Jan 23 00:11:39 2015 UTC,Actually myspace classified Turisas as black metal at least ten years ago so I gave them a listen. Not what I considered black metal but it turned me on to the epicness that is folk metal.
folkmetal,2tbrla,Devo9090,4,Thu Jan 22 23:22:45 2015 UTC,That's pretty strange. The same person who classified them probably thinks Linkin Park is metal.
folkmetal,2tbrla,Devo9090,1 point,Thu Jan 22 23:54:32 2015 UTC,"I first got into folk metal after exploring Turisas, specifically through their album Battle Metal. I later started to get into Ensiferum and Korpiklaani. I was a HUGE Dimmu Borgir fan before that. But after discovering that the folky side to metal can be awesome, I found that I really started to appreciate the melody and acoustics behind them. Some days, all I'll listen to are the instrumental/acoustic songs in certain folk-metal albums.   For instance, I really enjoy Finntroll's Visor om slutet - it's a purely acoustic folk, no metal."
folkmetal,2tbrla,lewie,1 point,Thu Jan 22 23:49:03 2015 UTC,"Týr - Regin Smiður  So my story goes like this:  There used to be some rogue metal internet radio station. People could pick songs out of a list to play - but it was all stuff you've never heard on the radio. Maybe the artists, but not the songs. I came across Blind Guardian, who I couldn't get enough of. So I started looking up their stuff on Youtube, and came across the aforementioned Tyr song. It was amazing, nothing what I've heard before!  What keeps me a fan is the lore, the harmonics and melodies like you said, and that many bands use folk instruments."

After clicking through recommended links I hit up piratebay to see how long the music lasted on my ears before I started to buy albums.   I'm still listening to Folk Metal now because its just so different everything else I listen to, hell the closest that folk metal comes to my rock tastes is Skyclad, and thats still pretty different, just without the growls and screams of everything else. The genre just has everything I like between Hard Rock-""Regular"" metal and more."
folkmetal,2tbrla,tanne_sita_jallua,1 point,Fri Jan 23 00:57:32 2015 UTC,"Kinda a weird one thing lead to another story.  Father listens to folk music both New England sea faring kind and Celtic. Mother with stuff like Bob Dylan, Aerosmith, Rolling Stones, etc. I kept a liking to to both parents type but also explored my own liking and tastes.   I went with liking Rammstein as my first foreign band when I was first introduced to them in high school German class. While exploring herzelied.com for lyrics I saw some recommendations/ads for Tanzwut and In Extremo and liked them a lot.   Then one day I got bored and watched some muppets shows and started watching the Swedish chef when one linked to him lip syncing Korpiklaani's Wooden Pints. I grew very interested and listened to more of their music and finally discovered they are part of FOLK METAL. Going back and seeing Tanzwut and In Extremo were folk metal I knew this was a genre I liked a lot. And pretty much from there I just went deeper and deeper and fell in love ever since with the genre and this subreddit has only helped open more doors to discovering other bands from all over Europe and Asia.   I love the music similar to OP with harmonics and melodies. I also like how with each band brings a bit of their culture and instruments to the table so it is also an anti-xenophobia kinda  experience with meeting people through their music. A different taste to the bland radio auto-tune music and how every singer/band sounds similar. Also it feels like home with having music that is sorta a love child from my parents own music."

I've really gotten into Ensiferum, Turisas, and Korpiklaani (I think they sound more folk punk but what do I know). I dig Tyr and Alestorm as well.

One day I was looking at Celtic folk music on youtube and stumbled on to this song by Suidakra: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jLIYEsC-84  After that I was immediately hooked. Folk metal then got me into melodeath and power metal, and metal as a whole. I still love Folk Metal the best because of its harmonic/melodic elements like you said, and also because it was Folk Metal that opened me up to a whole new world of music.  Also, I completely agree with you that Folk Metal is the perfect music to workout to. Nothing like pumping some iron while listening to epic riffs and battle chants blasting in your ears."

Since then, I've delved more into Folk Metal and now, Eluveitie, Wintersun, and Korpikklanni are what I listen to the most. What kept me as a fan?

I like having something physical to relate to, and the booklets which contain lyrics and artwork (and sometimes history) are nice to leaf through.

folkmetal,2smliy,I_ABUSED_YOUR_CHAIR,1 point,Fri Jan 16 23:33:06 2015 UTC,Thank you on the heidevolk suggestion. I'd actually apparently heard one of their songs in some mix somewhere.
folkmetal,2smliy,WhiteHearted,11,Fri Jan 23 13:25:10 2015 UTC,"I get you on being able to understand the lyrics. I'm not a big fan of unintelligible vocals either, but I've been able to make some exceptions. These are a couple of my recommendations for you to explore, but none of them are exactly like Týr, so you get to have some fun exploring.  Equilibrium: Folk metal with a driving pace. These guys do a fair bit of growling, but it's great stuff. I wasn't into them that much until I heard their latest album, Erdentempel, which I loved. I recommend beginning with that one.  Sabaton: Power Metal, nothing folky about them. They sing about World War 2 and many other conflicts. Clean vocals, driving pace, and heavy, militant, drumming. Great Power Metal. Again, I wasn't really too into them until recently. I recommend both their latest album, Heroes, and Carolous Rex. Both are great. I listened to Carolous Rex twice this past Tuesday.  I'd start there. Everything I recommended is available on Spotify for starters. I could go on a bit, but I feel I'd be getting farther from Týr and just start naming bands I like.  EDIT: Ooh, almost forgot; Turisas! Power metal with a little bit of folk thrown in. Mostly intelligible lyrics and melodic. They've got a great cover of Rasputin, and I would recommend starting with Battle Metal"
folkmetal,2smliy,Avellin,7,Fri Jan 16 15:47:01 2015 UTC,"I don't have anything else to suggest, but I completely back up everything you've suggested. It's hard for me to find bands similar to Tyr to recommend. I saw them last August at the Granada in Dallas, and honestly I was impressed at the presence they had for a four piece. I don't know why, but I always assumed there were more than four of them."
folkmetal,2smliy,Bossman1086,3,Fri Jan 16 16:33:22 2015 UTC,"Fully backing Turisas and Equilibrium here. Equilibrium's album ""Sagas"" is also fantastic."

folkmetal,2smliy,muroidea,3,Fri Jan 16 20:53:00 2015 UTC,I see Triddana/Skiltron is finally starting to get popular on this sub. Nice.
folkmetal,2smliy,Hexaltate,2,Fri Jan 16 23:36:02 2015 UTC,Stille Volk is one of my favorite bands. However they're not metal in any way. Still worth checking out though.
folkmetal,2smliy,Thallassa,1 point,Sat Jan 17 07:13:29 2015 UTC,"You're right, I just listed a couple of folk bands that have clean vocals. I am often forgetting they're not even metal :O"
folkmetal,2smliy,PiTheKhoz,3,Sat Jan 17 14:42:21 2015 UTC,"Turisas, Sabaton, have already been mentioned but I can't give enough upvotes so I'm going to say them again ;)  Falconer is solid.   Actually pretty much anything off of this list. (er... if it doesn't link properly, the ""similar artists"" tab).   Maybe also Wintersun?  I think Ensiferum and Finntroll are pretty similar to Tyr, but not in vocal quality which seems to be what you're looking for."
folkmetal,2smliy,DearCubusSan,1 point,Fri Jan 16 21:36:33 2015 UTC,"I'm definitely going to double up on Falconer and Turisas, they're awesome. Turisas does growls a bunch, but they've always got clean vocals to balance it out.  Falconer always has exclusively clean vocals and sings a ton in Swedish. They do more power than folk, but they've got a particularly folky album that is all in Swedish, Armod. They're more along the lines of Valkyrja and The Lay of Thrym than any of the older Tyr material, though (that is to say, more power-y with only a hint of folk in the melodies)"
folkmetal,2smliy,Odinswolf,4,Sat Jan 17 02:04:26 2015 UTC,"Try In Extremo. Great german folk metal band, if the german lyrics don't bother you."
folkmetal,2smliy,leanik,3,Sat Jan 17 06:23:20 2015 UTC,"I will second Sabaton, Turisas, and Falconer, and add in Alestorm."
folkmetal,2smliy,muroidea,2,Sat Jan 17 07:56:47 2015 UTC,"Just to be clear, it doesn't have to be in English. I actually somewhat prefer hearing folk metal music sung in native tongues. Especially very minority native tongues (like Tyr with their Faroese)."
folkmetal,2smliy,AzrielOdin,6,Fri Jan 16 18:21:48 2015 UTC,I've been digging Metsatöll since seeing them with Eluveitie and Tyr last year. Pretty sure it's exclusively in Estonian but the singer's voice is really awesome.
folkmetal,2smliy,mattschuette,1 point,Fri Jan 16 20:49:04 2015 UTC,Try Troll Gnet El. They're a Russian folk metal band without any real growling.

folkmetal,2smliy,howlingwolfpress,2,Sat Jan 17 13:07:17 2015 UTC,"There are a few threads about this on this sub already.  What you are looking for is clean vocals as opposed to harsh vocals.  Týr are also somewhat progressive, especially their older albums, which may also be something you are looking for."
folkmetal,2smliy,omegaxibir,2,Fri Jan 16 19:28:43 2015 UTC,"Skyforger (from Lithuania) has some very similar songs, structurally, to older Týr (i.e. - if you like things like Sinklars Visa, you'd appreciate some of Skyforger's songs).  On the other hand, Skyforger can get into the super extreme range (growling/screaming, etc.) that would be completely divergent from Týr, so it's really hit or miss.  That's about as similar as I can find. Been listening to Týr since 2003 and haven't found anything close enough except for, of course, Heljareyga and bits and pieces of Skyforger.  EDIT: Like this is probably what you're looking for. It's similar to Sinklars Visa, just a little more. . .'boring'(?) if that makes sense."

Allow me to fanboy a bit then: Always enjoyed the faster songs from the from Trollskau the most, and the new song is absolutely fucking fantastic! Listened to it a bunch of times in office before I reached the conclusion that I had to get to Systembolaget before they closed, so I could listen to properly when I got home. Then I did that. A couple of highlights include at 0:38 when one thinks ""wow, neat high"", but then it turns out that the actual high is at 0:40 instead. Also, the stuff around the 'switch' at 4:50 and onwards. And all the stuff in between."

folkmetal,2p3hpc,TheMachampion,17,Fri Dec 12 18:37:51 2014 UTC,"You should try listening to: Wolfchant, Heidevolk, Metsatoll, Tyr, Finntroll, Equilibrium (more like ""epic""/symphonic metal, but still folky enough you'd like it most likely), Eluveitie, and maybe Brymir (same deal as Equilibrium but you may enjoy it, folky themes still).  I can post a song for each, if that would help.  Wolfchant - Stormwolves  Heidevolk - Een Nieuw Begin  Metsatöll - Küü  Tyr - Flames of the Free  Finntroll - Skogsdotter  Equilibrium - Waldschrein  Eluveitie - Inis Mona  Brymir - Unconquerable  EDIT: Also, most of these bands use harsh vocals, but they are all quite folky so you may not mind it.  EDIT 2: Oh! Almost forgot. Nine Treasures - Nuutsai Chadal  Their vocals are ""harsh clean"", if that makes sense, he sort of mixes a throat-singing sound with regular singing and it sounds pretty awesome."

folkmetal,2p3hpc,gotNoodles,7,Fri Dec 12 18:36:24 2014 UTC,"Where to start with Folk Metal? Why, where it all started of course!  Skyclad - Think Back and Lie of England Building a Ruin The Well Travelled Man   As for the rest, it seems like you're a bit into power metal (Falconer and Alestorm), and I don't know exactly how familiar you are with that genre. As such, I'll just give a few (folky) recommendations.  Elvenking - The Loser  Blind Guardian - Skalds and Shadows (Rather Falconer-y, I think)  Wuthering Heights - Too Great Thy Gift  (We'veI've got plenty more at r/PowerMetal if you're interested :D)  Next, we'll address Schaundmaul. So, Mittelalter-Rock/Metal is awesome, not sure how much of it you are aware of, but:  Faun - Diese kalte Nacht Tanz mit mir  Saltatio Mortis - Wachstum über alles Früher war alles besser Hochzeitstanz (Alea has the worst hair ever, but whatever :D)  Santiano - Garten Eden / Scarborough Faire"
folkmetal,2p3hpc,PiTheKhoz,2,Sat Dec 13 00:38:21 2014 UTC,"On the medieval point -Subway To Sally. I'm not sure what I'd recommend to start at though. The first song I heard by them was Wehe Stunde. (Thanks to some streaming radio app a few years ago.)  If you like Faun, Saltatio Mortis, and such you will probably like Subway To Sally.  I just got into the more medieval stuff (via listening to Faun for awhile) a few months ago. The amount of new music you can find on streaming radio is amazing, depending on the app.  Oh yeah, if you're talking about the lead singer in Saltatio Mortis, yeah...I agree on awful hair, but the music is great. (I don't know the name of anyone in that band.)"
folkmetal,2p3hpc,loudmuteswan,2,Sat Dec 13 17:07:17 2014 UTC,"Ok, along the Medieval (or mittelalter in German) lines: Corvus Corax, Cultus Ferox, Schelmish, Dunkelschön, Potentia Animi, WirrWahr, Wolfenmond, Haggard, maybe even Tanzwut or Heimataerde (more electronic, but still folky).  In Extremo should probably be mentioned.  And, these are not medieval per se, but I would be remiss to leave out: Garmarna, Lumsk and Fejd."

folkmetal,2p3hpc,tkdyo,1 point,Fri Dec 19 14:32:27 2014 UTC,"For the most part, Elvenking is just power metal with violin. In general, it seems like most of r/folkmetal prefers music that is more like Metatsoll or Ensiferum. Less power and more atmospheric, in my experience."
folkmetal,2p3hpc,PiTheKhoz,1 point,Fri Dec 19 15:24:03 2014 UTC,"yeah, i definitely get that from their last few albums.  but heathenreel and wyvern seem like really great albums for someone just starting in the genre to me."
folkmetal,2p3hpc,tkdyo,7,Fri Dec 19 15:27:38 2014 UTC,Tyr is a really good one.  I actually started with Eluveitie and I hated harsh vocals back then. Listen to Arcane Evocation I which is acoustic and Anna Murphy does all the vocals. Then some songs which feature Anna's vocals (clean). Here's a list starting with 100% Anna's vocals too more of a balance between Anna and Chrigel (harsh vocals):  Call if the Mountains A Rose For Epona Vianna Alesia Celtos Slania's Song (Gaulish) Luxtos  (There are obviously more but those are the notable ones to me)  I ended up loving the rest of Eluveitie's song that the harsh vocals grew on me (and I detested them before).  EDIT: typos
folkmetal,2p3hpc,aaziz88,4,Fri Dec 12 19:25:26 2014 UTC,"I'd suggest Heidevolk and Metsatöll. You also may like Eluveitie, although they do have harsh vocals, but also much in the ways of folk elements."

folkmetal,2p3hpc,stevexc,5,Fri Dec 12 21:13:01 2014 UTC,"You have a good start.  It's definitely good to cast your net wide and go around the world.  From Finland, Korpiklaani and Finntroll are the godfathers of that country's scene and are must haves.  Also crucial to any folk metaller collection is Moonsorrow's ""V: Hävitetty"" album.  The atmosphere of that album (two songs, roughly 30 mins apiece) is fantastic, and its sheer awesomeness should mitigate any aversion to the vocal style.   From across the bay in Estonia, Metsatöll is like a gnarlier and groovier Korpiklaani.  Lots of fun live  From the rest of Scandinavia you get more of the Viking stuff.  TYR is definitely where you want to go here.  If you end up liking Moonsorrow, go for Thyrfing.  And to go old school, check out Bathory's ""Hammerheart"", which is the fountainhead of Viking metal.  Germany has a big folk metal scene.  Falkenbach is a great viking outfit.  Equilibrium from Munich does big heroic folk, definitely start with their ""Turis Fratyr"" album.  From Israel, start with Orphaned Land: great, proggy Middle Eastern-influenced metal with a very awesome theme.  Arafel plays real aggressive Russian/Ukrainian-influenced music, and I can't get enough of their newest album with Equilibrium's former vocalist.  Melechesh is not strictly folk, but its heavily Armenian/Assyrian folk-influenced black metal is pretty awesome you're in the mood for that.  Though I was into them for awhile, I've gone cool on Eluveitie.  Primordial from Ireland is better Celtic folk, imho.  Also good: Skyforger (Latvia), Mägo de Oz (Spain), and Agalloch (Oregon).  Enjoy!"
folkmetal,2p3hpc,Metal_Law,3,Tue Dec 16 02:20:57 2014 UTC,"If you like clean vocals I would also advise you to listen to Lumsk. Their latest album is less folk-ish, so you may prefer listening first to Det Vilde Kor and Troll."
folkmetal,2p3hpc,amprvector,3,Fri Dec 12 21:24:21 2014 UTC,"If you enjoy Schaundmaul, you should check out Faun. They are alsonot metal but very folky. Also since IM assuming the obvious ones like Korpiklaani and Eluviete are already being mentioned, let me suggest Tengger cavalry."
folkmetal,2p3hpc,kingfrito_5005,2,Fri Dec 12 22:40:58 2014 UTC,Equilibrium and Wintersun are a must although they breach genres. Both are incredibly symphonic and epic. Check out Time I for Wintersun and Sagas or Erdentempel for Equilibrium

This summer I saw a band of street musicians performing and a lot of their tunes sounded familiar until at one point I recognized ""Inis Mona"". Turns out one of them is a big fan of Eluveitie, they did a cover of that song and the rest was just some old songs, the same which Eluveitie craft into their music. Folk metal is awesome."

folkmetal,2np53h,I_ABUSED_YOUR_CHAIR,1 point,Sat Nov 29 18:52:58 2014 UTC,I think they sound amazing if it is focused on them. I have a list of bands using them:  Nachtgeschrei (new singer) is my personal favourite for hurdy gurdy music. They have one that plays only hurdy gurdy and sometimes accordeon.  Ignis Fatuu The hurdy gurdy switches with the bagpipes and violin. This song is one with one.  Saltatio Mortis in some of their songs but I can't one with it. it disappears a bit under the bag pipes usually.  In Extremo. Not all songs but I would say ~30% atleast.  Subway to Sally   And ofcourse there is Schandmaul
folkmetal,2njlh2,Bossman1086,12,Thu Nov 27 03:24:54 2014 UTC,"It was a pretty good album. Not sure if I liked it better than Helvetios, but it was fantastic and one of my favorites of 2014 still."

They let the audience decide on whether they want the English or a different version, and apparently so far they never got to play the English one on the European tour :D I don't know what it is, but that song really got me, especially in Schwitzerdütsch... they should do more songs in that language."
folkmetal,2njlh2,aaziz88,5,Fri Nov 28 16:22:26 2014 UTC,I really enjoyed and still do rock out to this album. Definitely on par with their quality of music. Especially considering how good Helvetios was. From Darkness is my personal favorite on the album but there weren't any songs I disliked which is best case scenario for an album. I just wish their would been one more track with female vocals and harsh vocals backing. Such an amazing mix I.e. Alessia  Ensiferum has a new ablum coming out too early next year.
folkmetal,2njlh2,colossus565,2,Thu Nov 27 04:23:04 2014 UTC,"I agree, I really like the mix of Anna's and Chrigel's vocals -- Celtos is a good example of this."

folkmetal,2njlh2,lincolnsgold,2,Thu Nov 27 05:57:54 2014 UTC,"I'm honestly surprised at how much I enjoyed (am still enjoying) it. I'm not the biggest Eluveitie fan, but 'Helvetios' is probably one of my top 5 albums ever. Across all genres.  This album is a hell of a follow-up to what I consider an almost perfect album."
folkmetal,2njlh2,PattyLang,2,Thu Nov 27 06:47:55 2014 UTC,"I think it's their best overall album. Helvetios had stronger standout songs--I'd even accept that Slania did too, but their sound has matured a lot since then--but nothing else they've put out has stayed so consistently good from beginning to end. I've listened to it regularly since it came out.  From Darkness, Virinus, and Call of the Mountains are the best tracks."
folkmetal,2njlh2,blekkja,2,Thu Nov 27 07:57:56 2014 UTC,"Not to be a bummer, but it is my least favorite album by them. I love listening to individual songs by them shuffled with other artists. When I saw them live this year it was the most disappointing concert I have been to. They performed exceptionally, but track after track from Origins made it quite repetitive. Overall I'd say its an alright album, but their techniques they use in their metal songs are too repetitive.  TL;DR Alright album that is pretty much the same as their others."
folkmetal,2njlh2,LordJanas,2,Thu Nov 27 21:07:01 2014 UTC,Is it metal or acoustic? Because these days I only ever really listen to Ven or Evocation. There metal stuff is getting too practiced and formulaic. Fantastic as a gateway band to folk metal from those who like general paint-by-numbers metal but I just can't get enthused about it. Every album is more of the same but with less spirit and originality each time.
folkmetal,2njlh2,blekkja,5,Thu Nov 27 08:42:19 2014 UTC,"No idea why you're getting down voted... I personally think your opinion is spot on.    As I've already posted, I find their music predictable and their ideas far too similar to many of their other songs.    I kind of hoped that a small sub reddit like this was beyond downvoting opinions when they said something critical about a band they liked..."
folkmetal,2njlh2,blurbie,3,Fri Nov 28 11:31:43 2014 UTC,"I hoped so too, but whatever. Everybody was so all over this I thought it was worth posting an opposing view to provide some contrast. I used to be all over Eluveitie too, I preordered the Slania LP and wore the hoodie to bits (holes in the elbows... takes some doing) But slowly I just kept going back to the quiet stuff and if I wanted a blast of angry then Ven fills the spot without going on for too long.  I'm just waiting for Evocation 2. When that happens I will be camping outside the record stores door to grab a copy."

folkmetal,2mxtyn,Astilaroth,1 point,Mon Nov 24 15:51:39 2014 UTC,"Around here (Netherlands, but also Belgium/Germany) it seems that a lot of the folk-fans at festivals dress in kilts. Or maybe: the only people wearing kilts at the festivals are folkmetal fans. That and drinking horns (which you can buy there as well) and often leather arm-gear.  So it depends a bit on your definition and obviously it's not LARP or any attempt at being historically correct. You'll see Celtic, Scottish and Viking/Nordic stuff mixed together, even with a hint of 'pirate' in the mix since the folkmetal people blend in with the pirate-metal folks easily.  As for women, I think you see a bit more corsets and long skirts among this crowd than the general metal crowd."

It's unfortunate too because they are clearly talented musicians. The acoustic parts are great, but they married it with the worst parts of metal. Breakdowns and half assed screamo singing vocals. Damn it. I hate that I hate it.   It's a terrible name too. It makes it a gimmick which sucks because the songs clearly have the time put into it. Why spend all the time writing songs and then make yourself a joke with that name and those song titles. Bummersville dudes."

folkmetal,2mvu68,ofnaturalhistory,3,Sat Nov 29 05:37:56 2014 UTC,"Yea, sure.  Got started with them in late 2008/early 2009. Just sent an email saying I write music and play guitar, bass and lute (I don't play lute, never even touched one haha). Ended up playing on and writing music for 3 Folkodia and 2 Folkearth albums. It's a great idea but in practice there was just absolutely ZERO quality control (out of tune and time instruments, just plain bad songs, the works) , which explains why the albums will have a couple great songs and then just absolute crap. A massive undertaking to put together, no doubt, but there was seemingly not a great emphasis on putting out great music.  Heaps good experience though!"
folkmetal,2mvu68,robokron,2,Sat Nov 29 23:48:35 2014 UTC,"This is definitely spot on. While the out of tune/time stuff has definitely gotten better, my main problem is that I would be given 5+ songs and then expected to have written and recorded them in a week or less which definitely takes some creativity out of some songs.   Like you said though, the experience is amazing and pretty cool to work with different people all over the world!  Source: Also played in folkearth since 09 and on this song."

folkmetal,2m1pcf,KingsNobleScientist,2,Wed Nov 12 05:27:21 2014 UTC,"First of all - Feuerschwanz means firedick. Just thought id let you know that.  Here is the best translation I could come up with. It doesnt seem like this song makes a ton of sense. Also, from the accents, Im not entirely sure this band actually speaks German as a first language.  In Geschichten und Sagen  Geht es heiß her.  Deshalb braucht man einen starken  Durstlöscher!  In tales and stories  It is a stormy affair   That’s why you need a strong  Drink! (literally thirst-quencher)  Hoch in den Bergen  Bei Elfen und auch Zwergen:  Betrug und Hypokrisie,  Davor keiner warnte sie.  High in the mountains  Near elves and also dwarfs  Deception and hypocrisy  You have not been forewarned.  Metnotstand im Märchenland!  Der Durst verbrennt mich heiß wie Feuer!  Metnotstand im Märchenland!  Die Brüder Grimm bezahlen teuer.  Metnotstand im Märchenland!  Herr Gevatter reicht die Hand, es ist:  Metnotstand im MÄrchenland!  Metnotstand in the fairy-tale-land *  The thirst burns me like hot fire!  Metnotstand in the fairy-tale-land *  The brothers grimm pay poorly (literally ‘pay cheap’)  Metnotstand in the fairy-tale-land *  Mr Gevatter is fed up with the hand, it is (possibly like the ‘hand he was dealt in life’)  Metnotstand in the fairy-tale-land *  Spekulanten aus fernen Landen  Den Methandel profitabel fanden.  Das Märchenland zusammenhält  Ist nun mal nicht alles Geld der Welt.  Adventuring in foreign lands  He finds the mead trade profitable  The fairy-tail-land cannot be kept together  By all the gold in the world (the cannot is actually in this line)  Der Teufel mit drei goldenen Haaren  Will sofort was zu saufen haben.  Hans im Glück ist depressiv.  Denn der Geist im Glas ist kein Aperitif!!!  The Devil, with 3 golden Hairs,  Wants to drink immediately,  Hans in happiness is depressed  (that is a literally translation, No idea what the fuck it means.) Then the ghost in the glass is not an appetizer. (Normally I would translate this to spirit but that could be misconstrued in this sentence as a distilled drink, which I am fairly certain is not what is being said, even though that would make more sense.)  *I think metnotstand might mean hangover. Met means mead, not means hardship/need/distress and stand means rank/position/status  EDIT: I tried to format this to make it readable, but reddit said fuck you.  EDIT 2: slightly improved translation  EDIT 3: okay, so notstand means emergency, which makes sense. So I guess the song is called mead emergency in fairytail land.  EDIT 4: So to explain the video, it looks like they are in a fairytail land where all the fairy tail creatures are fighting over the very last bottle of mead in fairytail land."
folkmetal,2m1pcf,kingfrito_5005,1 point,Wed Nov 12 19:26:45 2014 UTC,"Good translation!   I like seeing them side by side, so I just ran it through google translate. It comes out pretty close but of course your grammar is much better.   Double space at the end of the line, then enter makes a line break.   Double enter at the end of a line  makes a paragraph break.   That should help you format it so it's more readable.   Edit: Glück can also mean luck, so perhaps ""Hans im Glück"" means ""lucky Hans""? Here we go, discussion thread. That is exactly what it means and it is the title of another fairy tale.   More edits: The band is definitely German, but they're from SouthEastern Germany so the accent is different from what is taught in school, at least here in the US."

If not, you could try the Evocation album. It's mostly in Gaulish with Anna's vocals.

folkmetal,2liki4,Evolving_Dore,1 point,Fri Nov 7 14:04:50 2014 UTC,"Arkona has harsh and clean vocals both by Masha.  Eluveitie has occasionaly clean vocals by Anna and more frequent harsh vocals by the frontman dude.  If your friend remembers whether the harsh vocals sounded masculine or feminine that could cut out one band or the other.  Statistically speaking, it was probably Arkona.  From what I've heard they tend to have a more even ratio of clean and harsh vocals in their songs.  Was it this one?"

Two good examples:  Buccaneer's Inn (Sorry for weird game footage; no one has uploaded the album version of the song)  Sons of Riddermark  Their Sword's Song album is really good, but there are some great songs on their later albums too.    If you enjoy folk music that isn't metal, I'd recommend checking out Faun.  They use a lot of folk instruments and have lovely female vocals.  Mit Dem Wind  Hope this helps.  I think I have very similar musical tastes to you :)"
folkmetal,2kfoxw,LordJanas,2,Mon Oct 27 04:44:42 2014 UTC,"I cannot echo Battlelore enough. They do a good job of balancing their music, the vocals, especially. Plus, a good deal of their material is based on Tolkienian lore. Narn i Chîn Húrin is my favorite legend of his, probably in all modern fiction, and I was delighted when I found Doombound  (a concept album centering on the tale)...so, yeah, good suggestion!!

Also, listen to Faun's earlier stuff, their former singer Elisabeth Pawelke is great! (She has her own solo stuff since she left Faun. Also plays hurdy gurdy. Check out El Rey de Francia. Not folk metal but still awesome.)  Suidakra has a song entirely sung by a woman called Birog's Oath. I'm not sure about the rest of their songs.  Forget any spelling errors, I just woke up. And I'm out of the serious folk metal loop, sorry for lack of that. I listen to more faun and ""medieval"" stuff.   P.s. check out Anna's music outside of Eluveitie. Her voice is amazing."

However, it's hard to tell what the vocal quality is from that list. While I wish I could recommend Arkona to you the majority of Masha Scream's singing is the opposite of what you want (that is the only clean song I could find, and I'm not sure it qualifies).   I'll recommend Turisas to you; they fit what you're looking for besides the fact that it's a male singer.   You may have luck dropping the ""metal"" and going for straight folk to find clean vocals with themes like Eluveitie. For example Baltimore Consort does very traditional songs with an amazing female lead, Custer LaRue. (She hasn't sung for them for a while, I don't know who is singing for them now, but there's 5-6 CDs released with her on them. Many of the songs don't have vocals unfortunately).   There's a lot of Celtic Folk singers that may also have what you're looking for. Random example."

I've been following James Fogarty (Grand Master Jaldaboath)'s musical career like a huge nerd ever since hearing this track from Ewigkeit's Radio Ixtlan on an Earache sampler, during his brief brush with the fringes of the mainstream. The man is an absolute nutter in the best sense of the word, and everything he's done (Early Meads of Asphodel, Ewigkeit, Blacksmoke, Old Forest, The Bombs of Enduring Freedom, Feral Underclass, Jaldaboath etc.) is brilliant and very strange. Especially when you consider that a lot of his stuff was just produced by himself in his flat. It's good to see he seems to be finally getting some recognition; I saw a few people at Wacken this year in Jaldaboath shirts (I myself occasionally sport a limited edition 'Axe Wielding Nuns' shirt)."

If you try to get up near the front of the stage, expect to be run into by moshers several times. Ear plugs are also a good idea if you value your hearing, especially if you will be towards the front. Don't wear open toed shoes.  I saw them in Oakland, great show! Try to get there on time, because Metsatoll is a really great band that deserves a good audience. Lauri (the one who plays bagpipes/flutes/sings a little) has the best voice ever."
folkmetal,2illjo,empress544,4,Tue Oct 7 22:18:18 2014 UTC,"YES. Lauri has a fucking awesome voice. Everyone in the band is very friendly. I had the pleasure of speaking with them after the show since they were standing in the venue towards the exit to meet fans as they left. Man, the lead singer has certainly put on a few pounds, that's for sure! But they are all great guys and they put on a fucking AMAZING show. Their music is more ""folk"" than the other two bands and they have a lot of unique instruments that get used throughout their performance.  I've seen them twice and both times they made me love their music."

I'm going to try out some musicians' head phones I've been hearing about. I figure at the very least I can take them out if I don't like it.  Shoes -- I hear about that a lot. I typically wear sturdy running shoes (New Balance), but a lot of people have said go as far as wearing boots.

Getting trampled in a mosh pit is a really easy way to ruin your week (or more)  If you manage to stay standing up, moshing is actually pretty fun! Just be careful about it and remember that if you get hurt, it probably wasn't on purpose. The people are (usually) there to enjoy the music and have fun, not to cause injuries and make enemies."

folkmetal,2illjo,gellis12,8,Wed Oct 8 07:02:26 2014 UTC,"Eh, falling down isn't such an issue. Sure, it could turn ugly but usually as an accident rather than a deliberate act. Metalheads generally look out for each other. Most metalhead moshers will likely be falling over each other to help you back up.  I was knocked out cold at a show (my own fault) and woke up to 10 people holding me up. Thanked them and went back to moshing. Thankfully I didn't have a concussion.  That said, watch out for the 'Flaily McRagefists' whatever-core types. They're idiots who are more interested in their own personal gratification at limb flailing and taking up the entire pit than moshing as a shared experience. They're easily spotted because they won't actually be moshing to the music playing, but rather to some horrid soundtrack playing in their mind, no doubt accompanied by imagery of themselves masturbating to how cool and edgy they are."
folkmetal,2illjo,leanik,3,Wed Oct 8 04:16:45 2014 UTC,"Flaily McRagefists   I'm stealing that phrase!

folkmetal,2illjo,beboola,3,Wed Oct 8 00:27:21 2014 UTC,"I actually went to see the Eluveitie, Tyr, Metsatoll concert as my first concert about a month ago. It was incredible. Absolutely 10/10 amazing. Chrigel was such a nice guy, he thanked the (pretty small) crowd multiple times after each song and seemed like an amazing person. I bought a shirt because of him. My advice if I could do it again: Don't be afraid to go wild. Watch the first few mosh pits to see what other people are doing and then just copy them. Headbang until your neck hurts, and mosh until you have bruises.    Frequent bathroom breaks shouldn't be a problem. The crowd was pretty small and there were breaks between each band. You will have plenty of time to relieve yourself a few times between bands. As for how the concert went, Metsatoll opened and the crowd was nearly stagnant with a few bobbing heads, what can I say, their music just didn't fit the atmosphere. Tyr helped warm up the crowd a little, and there was finally a little bit of hype. By the time Eluveitie got on stage the (600ish) people that were there were going nuts. Mosh pits and headbanging all throughout Eluveitie. It was the most fun I have had all year."

The folkmetal show seemed a little tame in comparison to say, a Dying Fetus or Necrophagist show. There were a lot of adorable metal ladies wearing medieval like clothing with long ass hair. It made me super excited to see ladies digging the folk metal arena."
folkmetal,2illjo,lewie,3,Wed Oct 8 02:03:36 2014 UTC,"I saw them 10/6 in Portland and it was a fucking fantastic show! Hands down the craziest mosh pit incited by a flute solo I've ever been in.  Don't worry too much about the pit... there are kinda some unspoken rules to them. Try them out if you want but they are avoidable (especially if you like to hang out in the bar). Nearly everyone in or around the pit will immediately stop and and pick you up if you fall (even if you're a super trashed girl who decides the best place to chill is laying on the floor). Our pit actually stopped to help a guy find the pieces to his broken glasses.  There was a wall of death... ours ended in a 10 man meat pile, but then rescue crews headed in.

The mosh pits aren't too crazy. They'll pick you up if you fall, and you can get out when you need. And if there's some douchebag neonazi doing his stomp thing, people stop moshing until he quits (happened at Blondie's once).   Týr usually doesn't get much of a mosh pit, which i like since i can get to the front row. Of course their new songs are heavier, i think they're trying to get people to mosh.   Any way, it'll be an awesome show!"

folkmetal,2illjo,Call_Me_Salamander,2,Wed Oct 8 03:18:13 2014 UTC,"It's much smaller than those venues. It's long and narrow, so wherever you are, you're in front of the stage. If you get there a bit early, you can get up pretty close. Also, i think St Andrews lists show time, and not doors open time (which is 1 hour prior to the show), so get there on time... I found out the hard way.  Get there not long after doors open and you can park across the street, super simple and close. They have good security, so the few bums there are shouldn't be a bother.  Overall that place is way better than Harpo's - I'm glad these lesser known metal bands have realized what a shit hole Harpo's is.  Hope that helps. See you there!"
folkmetal,2illjo,70000TonsOfMetal,2,Wed Oct 8 03:56:50 2014 UTC,"I also saw the show in Baltimore. Get there early' metsatoll is a treat live. I've been to many shows all over the world, but there are few finer people than folk metal fans. They are friendly to talk to, and comraderie is forgedbin the put. Get in there. Trampleings only happened at the mega shows, and not in many years now. Alternate beers and water because it will be HOT and you should be bouncing around screaming like a viking berserker. How else will the band know you are enjoying what they work so hard to bring? Also, dress up or dress down, but none of this middle of the road bullshit. Let that freak flag fly."
folkmetal,2illjo,lewie,2,Wed Oct 8 02:50:40 2014 UTC,"The Folk Metal shows in NYC are always fun, and I haven't seen anyone get seriously injured in the mosh pit.  Occasionally someone loses their glasses and everybody stops moving and helps look.  It seems to be a regional variance.  I went to this past Paganfest in NYC and Massachusetts, and while at Irving Plaza (NYC) everyone was super respectful when things got rowdy, at the Palladium Upstairs (Worcester Mass.) there were a bunch of angsty savages just hurting each-other and even those who weren't trying to participate.  Maybe that's just Worcester.  Who knows with Detroit?  Awesome shows, regardless."

Eluveitie is probably my favorite band so that kind of drowned out the slight nervousness I had. Also Nicole was missing due to a family emergency so that was a bummer. I was seriously impressed though, Tyr and Metsatoll are WAY better live than studio in my opinion. Lots of energy and great stage presence. All 3 bands fucking demolished.  I also met a Danish couple and we spent the whole show together chatting about music and their home country. Very friendly people.   Point is, don't worry to much. Everyone is there for the same reason, to enjoy some fucking awesome music. Of all the people I met everyone was super friendly. It turned out to be one of the best experiences ( of the few that I've had) ever. I Hope Eluveitie comes back soon!"

folkmetal,2illjo,fuckplex,2,Wed Oct 8 11:00:13 2014 UTC,"Now that's a good show! Definitely stand in the back if you're not into crowds.   Shooting range earmuffs. They're good too if you're noise sensitive. I also bring something to completely cover my eyes (a hat, sunglasses aren't enough) because flashing lights give me a splitting headache. (Also have other issues but it's not relevant.)  Make sure you park somewhere where your car isn't going to be stuck in a garage.  Finally sometimes if you stand by the door you can meet people in the band (if there's only one door to the venue). And you won't be the only fan there.  Have fun and BE CAREFUL! Just trust me on the be careful in Detroit! I'm not sure where the venue is but always be careful.  Also if you have friends online who are going you can possibly meet them there.  Edit now I'm mad I don't live near Detroit anymore and that I can't drive!"

folkmetal,2illjo,doberwoman,2,Thu Oct 9 23:58:32 2014 UTC,"I personally went to the show in Sacramento this past Saturday and I can tell you it was phenomenal. Eluveitie is the second best band I have seen live, after Wintersun. It was my girlfriends first time to a metal concert and she doesn't even like metal, and she still enjoyed it. Everyone put on an amazing show. I'd seen Tyr and Metsatoll before but they both blew me away by how far they had improved since I saw them last year. Especially Metsatoll.  Definitely stand towards the back if you do not want to mosh. I'm a heavy guy so I have no issues with people ramming into me (I don't mosh, but I stand in the front all the time so I am usually the edge of the pit). My girlfriend wasn't so lucky and a huge guy ended up running into her by accident and knocking her into the floor. Luckily nothing happened, she was just a little shaken up!  Finally, here are some videos I took of the show in Sacramento a few days ago. I hope you enjoy them and that they give you a good idea of what to expect!  Eluveitie: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Uh86pVwoGk&list=UUUB4ctWYGdPJ1N0sMvwwB_w  Tyr: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYEoGHbsaQU&list=UUUB4ctWYGdPJ1N0sMvwwB_w"

I was the short dude on the rail on the other side (right up against both rails). Definitely an impressive show, that venue may be my new favorite venue in California and would definitely make the 2.5 hour drive to see more shows there.  Lots of young people at the show and this seems to be a lot of people's first metal concert (as evinced by the thread). That was my 7th time seeing Eluveitie, 10th seeing Tyr, and 3rd seeing Metsatöll and I'm glad everyone in this thread seems to be enjoying this tour. I think Tyr's declined quite a bit since 2011ish but Metsatöll crushed it and Eluveitie sounded pretty solid despite Nicole not being there.  Advice? Bring earplugs and comfortable shoes. You'll be fine and don't worry about the pits."

I guess 25 is right in the middle of being young to half the crowd and old to the other :P It is good to hear that younger guys (and girls) are still getting into folk metal. And hopefully we can stop them from become douchebags, too ;)  Already bought some musician's earplugs from all the advice I've been hearing. They're something that I can just take out if I don't like 'em so I might as well try it.  Shoes -- trying to figure out if I'm going to go with my normal sturdy running shoes.

I better go back and review some of the other setlists now that they've played more shows to add songs to my playlist :P"
folkmetal,2illjo,ottoonkolonna,2,Wed Oct 8 11:06:59 2014 UTC,"Update after the show! Thanks all you guys here for the discussion. I've been pumped or the show for several weeks and I am geeking out since the moment it ended.  My buddy couldn't come with me (his passport wasn't in yet), so I ended up taking my friends 17yo song who is into a lot of metalcore and stuff.  Ricky and I arrived about an hour early. After narrowly escaping a hobo and being trapped in a tiny bathroom stall, we waited outside Saint Andrews for a bit before we realized the line was on the other side of the stair way. Oops. So we got in line and talked this cool bro named Eric who seemed to be there by himself. Ricky and he had way more to talk about in there metal band ways, of course.  The juicy parts... Eventually we got in and grabbed some t-shirts and waited for the first act. The venue was a lot smaller than pretty much anything I've ever been to -- which I think was a plus (more on that later).  Metsatoll came out on stage with no preamble or introduction and started playing. The crowd was a bit weak at first but started jamming along. Honestly I don't know what songs they played except for Kivine Maa which is the only song of theirs I know well enough (and I was pumped when the weird boingy sound started the song). They didn't play too long but it was a good set for not knowing any of the other songs and not understanding Estonian . The band members were really into it. The lead singer and guitarist (Lauri is his name I think) was so full of energy and really added to the stage presence. The bagpipe player went pretty hardcore and played his pipes behind his head like a mother fucking viking Jimi Hendrix. And the drummer looked vaguely like Slash, at least with the hair.  Tyr was up next and I learned something. One, it's not pronounced ""tear"". ""Tee-air"" or even ""tay-are"" perhaps, I don't remember . Second, the difference between the lead vocalist/guitarist and bass players like facial expression and attitude. The lead was all stony faced and ""I am a fucking viking God of metal"" and the bassist was like a fat, jolly, guitar licking energetic guy that kind of reminded me of Sebastian Bach.  Tyr's setlist was great and their performance was awesome. They're not as folk as the other two (no folk instruments), but still really enjoyable and enough up my alley for me to enjoy them. Highlights of the set list were Blood of Heroes, Hold the Heathen Hammer High, By the Sword in My Hand, and finishing with Shadow of the Swastika. Actually there were several more worth naming, too...  And this is where I begin to get into the show a lot more. I've always heard about how metalheads are the best kind of people, and I was explaining to Ricky on the way to the show the difference between the perception of metal core and true heavy metal. One is typically a younger, teenage crowd of guys trying to prove something and generally people being dicks and trying to hurt other people. The other is a bunch of guys who all enjoy the same thing (metal) and want to dance around and have a good time (and whose idea of dancing is slamming into each other). Or so I had heard.  Unsurprisingly and to my amusement, this turned out to be true. Metalheads are pretty fucking rad people as a whole. Where a half-drunk, wild mob might turn into a violent mess in other groups instead becomes a moshing mass of camaraderie. The first exhibit was a mosh pit during Tyr. It was fairly mellow to begin with the same 5-6 guys smashing around -- including a very large and tall dude who weighed probably upwards of 350 lbs. Who at one point happened to get knocked down. Immediately, the rest of the pit stopped and helped him up, to be met by a chorus of cheers (including the guy himself). Following that, some guy grabbed one of the moshers by the arm -- and handed him his phone which he had dropped. This was met by much hurrah and many hugs.  I proceeded to headbang and sing through the rest of Tyr's set, including belting out By The Sword In My Hand with another large Viking looking dude (hint, there are a lot of large viking looking dudes at these things). Then there was a line of arm-in-arm headbanging as well.  Tyr finished off with Shadow of the Swastika which I didn't expect to be one of their biggest hits but makes sense now especially for a set ender (high energy, and the line ""and you can kiss my Scandinavian ass"" was great to scream out with the crowd).  Some down time for stretching my old bones and hydrating before Eluveitie. They were why I came to this show. A band who isn't all that mainstream, especially in NA, and who I had never really expected to get the chance to see. Tyr I have listened to a bit recently and Metsatoll I only just discovered when I bought tickets for this tour and started doing my setlist prep. But Eluveitie I've been listening to for probably 3 years, perhaps more. I've even begun to appreciate some -- some -- death metal vocals because of their music.  To summarize their performance, it was fucking amazing. They managed to fit all 8 band members on that tiny stage and put a ton of energy into the show. Lead vocalist Chrigel was incredibly intense throughout the entire setlist and the whole band put on an amazing show, even though the crowd and venue was relatively small. When a musician really enjoys performing (and you can tell) it adds so much to the experience.  The setlist was pretty sweet. They played a lot from their newest album, of course, and at least one song from the others (several from Helvetios). It was changed up a bit from what I had looked up previously, like starting with King (which was an Encore or main setlist ender) instead of The Nameless. There were a few songs I was disappointed not to hear. Alesia they haven't been playing at their recent shows even though I think it's one of the best songs on Helvetios, but Celtos was on most of their previous stops and I had really warmed up to it. (Disclaimer -- so much metal has been running through my mind lately that they may have played it and I'm mistaken but I'm leaning towards no because I think I would've remember it more explicitly).  Nonetheless, the setlist still rocked. Too many to name all the awesome songs, but highlights/my favourites were King, From Darkness, A Rose For Epona (where Anna threw out plastic roses to the crowd), Thousandfold... And the two encore songs were awesome show enders. Helvetios is so powerful with its chorus (""cause we're born free / cause we're born wild / cause we are indominantable and bold"") and of course the ""crowd's turn to sing"" favourite, Inis Mona.  I had taken in most of the first two sets from mid-hall, just on the edge of the mosh pits. As Eluveitie's set got into it I decided to throw myself into the pit for some metal dancing. Pushing each other around and then headbanging and singing as the songs went on was thrilling. Its been almost 10 years since I've been to a concert where I wasn't sitting and I've forgotten how much fun it was.  I made my way up to the front, center stage (it wasn't that difficult I'm the small hall). I rocked out there with some rad dudes and chicks (including a guy named Zak but who preferred to be called ""cupcake"" or so he told me, and who swung me back in after I ran for a piss break). I wasn't right against the bar but it was the best thing. Being in the press of jumping, fist pumping, singing, sweaty bodies was a part of concerts that I miss, and I don't think it gets more intense and energetic than it is at a metal show.  And then... And then Chrigel says to the crowd something like ""you guys are already moshing that is fucking awesome. But you know there is a tradition in metal..."" And I look at this total stranger beside me and he looks and ms and we both say ""Wall. Of. Death."" And I know I am in. I didn't expect to, but at that point, there was no way I could not. I was completely in the zone. And then I tell him... I'm a virgin. Let's fucking do this. We split, and I am at the front of a wall of people, staring across the empty floor at another wall. And the drums smash and we smash into each other, happy as fuck and I'm giddy inside because when has running around wild ever not been fun. I fall to the floor with another guy but I'm not worried, and within seconds we're picked up and moshing again and I press back to the front to headbang and sing once more.  And I really enjoyed the venue. It was a small hall -- stage took up one entire (short) end, merch booth down one side and bar down the other. I loved that I was only 10 feet from the band. I didn't have to squeeze by a bunch of seats to get a drink or use the pisser (which as an old man I do frequently), and I could easily make my way back to my spot in the crowd when I got back.  Overall, it was an absolutely amazing experience. I left wanting so much more. If I could get to Montreal and back instantaneously, I'd go see them again tomorrow. I want to throw on more metal (and I picked up some recommendations) and jam out all day. My neck is sore and my throat is raw but I'm headbanging in the car and still singing.  I'd totally see them again if I had the chance. Eluveitie especially, but Tyr was amazing as well and Metsatoll was an awesome opening act (which should not be skipped)."

Some of them have arrow in the eye and two fucking ones in their beard, I wonder who could survive. Few are the men who face them and even they run, those who are wounded are ready to die."

Moonsorrow and Enslaved (not really folk metal but whatever) do this really well.  I do prefer harsh vocals, but the harsh vocals in a lot of folk metal tend to be pretty bad, so I'm not usually too picky about it. Again, Moonsorrow is my favourite, but I find bands like Arkona and Emerald Night use theirs sparingly and really well.  Primordial I guess falls under the category of folk-influenced metal, seeing as they've got a mostly pagan/black metal feel to them, but their vocalist has easily the best clean and harsh vocals in that style IMO."

But as I grew older and explored more metal, the more I despised most clean vocalists :P Not all of course, Tom Waits, Myles Kennedy, and admittedly Matt Sanders (avenged sevenfold) are all amazing to me.

Same goes for Korpiklaani and Finntroll. . .I try to actively avoid them at festivals now because I really can't stand watching them anymore (though they're super cool guys to drink with)."
folkmetal,2fo8n2,NegligibleSenescense,3,Sun Sep 7 03:26:10 2014 UTC,I really like songs that combine both clean and harsh vocals. My favorite is when they're both sang simultaneously.

Eluveitie was too growly/screamy to me at first, but the great music behind it kept me coming back. Now I like the harsh vocals, but it has to blend with the music, and still be somewhat intelligible. Bands that scream for the sake of screaming (especially if they don't have lyrics) sound stupid to me. I hate Trollfest."

folkmetal,2fo8n2,someone_FIN,1 point,Thu Sep 11 00:49:31 2014 UTC,"Definitely clean vocals for me, almost all the way. Falconer, mid and later Skyclad - I know that Martin's thrashy voice isn't technically harsh, but it's definitely not clean and beautiful like on The Answer Machine?, and Týr. However, I do like the occasional growl or whatever in my folk metal, specifically with Battlelore. (Maybe not folk metal at all, actually)  Now, I personally don't see Alestorm as folk metal at all. As such, they're a power metal band and they have power metal singing, which makes sense to me. Although to be fair, much of the 'folk-metal' I like is really power metal anyway (Falconer and Týr's later albums come to mind). Then, there is the matter of Mittelalter Rock or Metal, which in general has clean vocals (I've actually never seen it with growled vocals). Faun - Tanz mit mir and  Saltatio Mortis - Früher war alles besser are examples, not technically metal, but still on the heavier end of the folk-rock spectrum.  I really like the idea of the growls sounding earthy, that's a really interesting thing to think about. In general, I don't really listen to Folk Metal like that, I think, so maybe I'm missing out. For me, folk metal is not about nature or anything, but more about the beat and the sound of the music, which is why I really like Falconer and Skyclad."
folkmetal,2fo8n2,majesticscarfripple,2,Thu Sep 11 03:05:41 2014 UTC,"I would say that saltatio mortis is folk metal. It has folk instruments, is inspired by folk music and is metal. What makes it not metal to you? and oh god I love faun."

As such, I think it's more helpful to list them as Mittelalter Rock/Metal, since I'd like to consider Faun and Saltatio Mortis as part of the same sort of genre, even though one is more metal/heavier rock. Altogether, Saltatio Mortis just doesn't have the heaviness, in my mind, to make it really objectively folk metal. That isn't any slight against it or anything, nor does that mean there's any problem with posting it here, I just think of them more as hard rock with folk influences."
folkmetal,2fo8n2,It_took_Linda,1 point,Sat Sep 13 16:44:32 2014 UTC,"For folk metal, most of my favorite bands growl or scream, but there are a few amazing ones that do mostly clean vocals. Falconer and Elvenking are two of my favorites. I prefer the stuff that has a good mix of both like Ensiferum, OLD Turisas and Craving."
folkmetal,2fmf6m,_Noble_6,14,Sat Sep 6 07:39:47 2014 UTC,"Equilibrium's a great one, as is Korpiklaani. If you don't mind a little change of scene and mood, Alestorm eschews the viking/nordic schema for a more pirate-inspired one. Alestorm is folk metal in a very different way from how tyr is folk metal, though: because they draw from sea shanties rather than traditional European folksongs, the end result is a tad different."
folkmetal,2fmf6m,TheChurchofHelix,3,Sat Sep 6 08:59:51 2014 UTC,Can't recommend Equilibrium enough.   They are one of my favourite bands of all.

While they pick up a style more their own in their second album (Time I). In any case, it's pretty magnificent."

They are a progressive folk metal band from Tunisia with that general ""Arabian"" sound.  For something epic like Ensiferum but a bit more blackened and with also a different ethnicity influence, there's Tengger Cavalry who are Chinese and have a general Mongolian theme.  For something more traditional in the folk metal world (By which I mean Nordic, specifically Finnish) Moonsorrow is hard to go wrong with on the epicness scale and the newest albums from Turisas and Alestorm are a bit experimental and contain some of the kind of progressive tendencies that you might associate with Týr."

folkmetal,2ezj9y,ofnaturalhistory,3,Tue Sep 2 21:48:18 2014 UTC,"Dude! You absolutely nailed it! The Final Curtain was the last song written for the E.P. and clearly pointed towards where we were heading with ""Ramshackle"", and I'd always thought as ""Circus of Misery"" doing the same, even before we'd starting writing this album. So stoked someone picked up on that!  The only question now is... WHERE THE HELL DO WE GO FROM HERE?!?!"

Eluveitie use TONS of traditional tunes in their albums, specially Breton and Irish tunes (as far as I can tell). And this is actually the main reason why I enjoy this band so much.  Some other examples:  La Jument de Michao --> Luxtos  Morrison's Jig --> Tegernakô  Dr. Gilbert --> From Darkness  Cooley's Reel -->Tarvos  and the list goes on..."

There's a thread in Eluveitie's website forum where its users compile the tunes used by the band, I looked it up but I didn't find out anything there about that tune in particular. If you are really desperate to know, I guess you can try and ask there."
folkmetal,2esk6a,YogurladoMaldito,3,Fri Aug 29 19:55:48 2014 UTC,"Yup, same melody. Lots of folk metal musicians use really, really old melodies that have existed for a long time. I don't mind it as long as the artistic integrity is still respected. Similar melodies can also be found in the intro of Rose for Epona - Eluveitie and Metropolice - Blood Stain Child"

folkmetal,2d02r1,hidden_heathen,2,Fri Aug 8 18:19:19 2014 UTC,I've never come across Native American metal before but it's something I've been curious about. Wow. This song drew me in right away when it started and gave a great vibe throughout. Thanks for sharing this with everyone.
folkmetal,2d02r1,Schwulahh,2,Sat Aug 9 08:05:54 2014 UTC,Blood of the Black Owl is another good Native American folk metal band.

folkmetal,2cuso0,gandalfthenerd,3,Thu Aug 7 04:20:41 2014 UTC,"LOL Ok, so I love Eluveitie, but over in /r/metal they were just talking about how Wintersun (another Nuclear Blast band) didn't have enough money from the label to record their album properly, and I look down and this song is recorded in five different languages, including Romansh, which I had not previously heard of (surprisingly, really). Along with a bunch of gorgeous music videos.   I know this is total oversimplification, but it's interesting how labels decide where the money goes."
folkmetal,2cuso0,Thallassa,3,Fri Aug 8 02:42:48 2014 UTC,"I like the song, but my personal opinion is that Origins has been a little underwhelming in comparison to older Eluveitie albums. I hate to see their music get formulaic. I feel like they've lost their groove a bit, and have fallen into that cycle of ""We have to produce this"", rather than ""We want to produce this"".   I'd like to see them make Evocation II. Switching gears for awhile making another acoustic album may be what they need to really turn things around."
folkmetal,2cuso0,Suppiluliuma89,5,Sat Aug 9 15:36:49 2014 UTC,I got a very mainstream metal vibe from this. Could've told me it was Evanescence and I wouldn't have questioned it (without the video).
folkmetal,2cuso0,Laggyzaki,7,Thu Aug 7 12:17:32 2014 UTC,"This could just be the ""Rose for Epona"" of the new album. It was the only song of its kind on Helvetios, and that was a great album. We'll see, I suppose."

folkmetal,2coyse,colossus565,2,Tue Aug 5 17:32:48 2014 UTC,I so fucking hope the next Ensiferum album is better than the last pile of shit they put out
folkmetal,2coyse,Oden_son,1 point,Tue Aug 5 19:07:53 2014 UTC,Aww man. I loved unsung heroes. Honestly the first listen I was quick to judge and wasn't too impressed but after I was able to give it a few good listen throughs I really enjoyed almost every song. Minus celestial bond. That song belonged on a shit sandwich. But top 5 bands go: 1- ensiferum 2- kalmah 3- eluveitie  4- dethklok 5- amon amarth
folkmetal,2coyse,colossus565,3,Tue Aug 5 21:27:23 2014 UTC,I love Ensiferum I just hated Unsung Heroes. Except Burning Leaves

Get moderately stoned and listen to In my sword I trust Unsung Heroes Last Breath  Pohjola Star Queen Retribution Shall be mine Passion Power Proof (no joke I've listened to it 203 times according to itunes) great song  It took some time to really appreciate but I thought was a good overall album. Also im assuming youre an amon amarth fan check this out if you havent already seen it https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWQmb7ADTTA
folkmetal,2coyse,colossus565,2,Wed Aug 6 01:46:17 2014 UTC,"That Amon Amarth cover was badass though, I think I've heard other songs from that same band.  My top 5 is 1.Eluveitie 2. Blind Guardian (Probably actually tied for #1) 3. Wolfchant 4. Waylander 5. Suidakra"

I'm always, always looking for good new metal and I've heard of all those bands (I really like Suidakra, even walked out to Darkane Times for an mma fight once) but can you send me you're favorite song form 2,3 and 4? Thanks man."

Blind Guardian- Bard's Song (The Hobbit), Bard's Song (In The Forest), Bright Eyes, Blood Tears and Tanelorn are my favorites (no way I could pick just one)  Wolfchant- Clan of Cross  Waylander- Of Fear and Fury"
folkmetal,2coyse,Oden_son,2,Thu Aug 7 02:40:14 2014 UTC,"And here's a few lesser known folk metal bands I really like if you want something new:  Adorned Brood- Pagan Knights  Craving- Targaryen Wrath (They're not exactly folk metal, but close enough that most folk metal fans will like it.)  Frosttide- Siege  Hammer Horde- In the Name of Winter's Wrath  Mael Mordha- Dawning of the Grey  Nightcreepers- A Tale of Haste  Skadika- The Hero Way  Wolfheart- Ghosts of Karelia (death metal but they're a recent discovery I'm REALLY starting to love)"

Believe me, I tried, they're one of my favorite bands of all time. If it was from a different band I'd probably like it more, but after the masterpiece they put out with From Afar I just couldn't appreciate Unsung Heroes."
folkmetal,2coyse,Oden_son,1 point,Thu Aug 7 22:11:13 2014 UTC,"Am I the only one who thinks Victory Songs was the last truly epic Ensiferum album. From Afar was good (I absolutely loved Twilight Tavern), but it felt somewhat repetitive."

If there was any change from Slovo to Yav then I think it was merely the band reaching the endpoint of a very long journey. With every single album they released, Arkona was becoming more and more progressive. Yav is just them committing to that for an entire album, and they released an amazing piece."
folkmetal,2cl28n,ImATomatoClone,1 point,Mon Aug 4 13:56:00 2014 UTC,"I agree - the way Masha's songwriting developed over the years is amazing and reached it's peak in complexity with Yav (so far).

It might be a little dated for all the kids and Johnny-come-latelies (their albums are from 1998-1999), but it doesn't get any better than those Swedes.  Early Vintersorg (from 2000 and earlier) is great too, and shares some band members, but they may or may not appeal to you as the vocals are more varied.  Storm's Nordavind (1995) and Cruachan's Folk-lore (2002) should also meet your requirements, and please your ears."

Falkenbach is in a similar vein, as it's essentially folk black with clean vocals.  XIV Dark Centuries is pretty good, very folky black metal with kinda the same vibe as Skalmold.    I also like King of Asgard, they're pretty typical viking black metal, as well as Abinchova, which is similar except way more folky.

It's lacking the iconic ""clean"" feeling in the song. Maybe the melody needs to be a little more pronounced? It's more blended than their past albums.   I think that is because of the low bit rate.

Kranium use lots of flutes on their very unique album Testimonios. Negura Bunget sometimes play the flute too. They have some folk influenses, even though I wouldn't call them a folk metal band.

folkmetal,2bdwp6,mattschuette,3,Tue Jul 22 15:19:58 2014 UTC,"Actually, I believe Crows Bring the Spring by Korpiklaani DOES have flute, so..."
folkmetal,2bdwp6,YogurladoMaldito,1 point,Tue Jul 22 13:23:37 2014 UTC,"This is also obviously the best Korpiklaani song, so there could be some correlation there."

The key is that ""site:metal-archives.com/bands"" searches only the band pages where members and what instrument they play are listed.  Not perfect, but I always find more than I expected.  Since they are listed first and I love them... Hantaoma - Malombra"
folkmetal,2bdwp6,ryanmidnite,3,Tue Jul 22 22:14:49 2014 UTC,Arkona often use flute in their songs.
folkmetal,2bdwp6,ryanmidnite,3,Tue Jul 22 22:51:39 2014 UTC,"Not folk metal, but you could try learning the flute solo from Locomotive Breath. Solo starts at 2:48."
folkmetal,2bdwp6,Friendly_Fluffballs,3,Wed Jul 23 09:14:07 2014 UTC,Jethro Tull is the right answer here. Flute + Heavy Music = Iain Anderson.
folkmetal,2bdwp6,Readwil,2,Wed Jul 23 10:01:47 2014 UTC,"Check out Blood Ceremony, they have flute in about a third of their songs. Might not be ""folk metal"" enough for your tastes but I think they sound incredible."

folkmetal,2bc5dr,Polisskolan2,1 point,Mon Jul 21 22:10:50 2014 UTC,"I used to be really into German-style folk rock/metal, like 12 years ago or something. Bands like In Extremo, Subway to Sally, Schandmaul, Letzte Instanz, etc. I listened to some Tanzwut/Corvus Corax, but I never got into them due to the lack of guitars. I think it may be time to give them another chance."
folkmetal,2bc5dr,Polisskolan2,1 point,Tue Jul 22 07:47:10 2014 UTC,"So does that fit here, or should it go on /r/germusic (though what about non-German bands?) or some other sub?"
folkmetal,2b8qpe,sawnofforc,14,Sun Jul 20 22:09:40 2014 UTC,"Eluveitie's latest release,  ""King"", from the upcoming album is a perfect example. Overall it's ok, not amazing. Then around half way through the song there is a 45 second portion that is phenomenal. They need to mix the folk stuff in more regularly.   Try korpiklaani (stuff from their middle years is easily my favorite), finntroll, and northland.  On the cleaner vocal + less metal side: some Dalriada (try the Ígéret album), Arkona, and Tyr. Some of that is on the lighter side, but we are talking about a small-ish subgenre here.  For some reason I keep wanting to say Amon Amarth. No traditional instruments, but the sound just kind of fits in with the heavier folk metal bands. Definitely one of my favorites."
folkmetal,2b8qpe,Lupyr,1 point,Mon Jul 21 01:21:17 2014 UTC,"Yeah I do like their latest track but most of Eluveitie's music I find a bit too aggressive like I said in the OP, plus I'm not keen on female vocals for the most part.  Korpiklaani haven't got any grunts and that's what I like to hear :P. I do like some FInntroll and I love Northland.   Of course I know Amon Amarth haha I've not lived under a rock for years. They're a bit too simple and samey for my tastes personally."
folkmetal,2b8qpe,FaptainAwesome,5,Tue Jul 22 09:32:00 2014 UTC,Try Wolfchant. Their album A Pagan Storm is a great album for what your looking for.
folkmetal,2b8qpe,SultanRony,1 point,Mon Jul 21 00:41:49 2014 UTC,Yeah they seem pretty good but I've never got into them. I'll give em another go around.

Well... Ten Days in Lachrymation was pretty decent too, but it has no folk influences."

folkmetal,2a8qhi,TheReginator,4,Wed Jul 9 14:50:10 2014 UTC,"This band is getting more and more like pop music with each new album. I'm looking forward for an Evocation II though, they do the pure folk thing really well."
folkmetal,2a8qhi,SpicyCornflake,5,Thu Jul 10 04:00:45 2014 UTC,"Honestly I don't mind this direction. I enjoy their older stuff, but this is pretty amazing too, in a different way."
folkmetal,2a8qhi,QueenAtziri,2,Fri Jul 11 08:50:07 2014 UTC,"Hell, I'm still going to listen to the album; Eluveitie has a tendency to release some of their weakest songs (in my opinion) as singles."
folkmetal,2a8qhi,SpicyCornflake,1 point,Fri Jul 11 22:37:04 2014 UTC,"I agree, I was pretty worried about Helvetios when A Rose For Epona was the first thing they released from it. Gladly, the rest of the album was the Eluveitie I loved and that song grew on me. It looks like Origins is gonna be the same way, the other single they released from it is one of the heaviest songs they've done."
folkmetal,2a8qhi,Oden_son,1 point,Sun Jul 13 15:23:08 2014 UTC,Yeah? I though of especially Helvetios being more and more towards the metal part of the band.
folkmetal,2a8qhi,Aunvilgod,1 point,Wed Jul 23 16:20:57 2014 UTC,"Helvetios was definitely more on the lines of metalcore than their previous work, but the album relied a lot of techniques similar to that of pop music.  Relying heavily on catchy choruses and repetitive verses was a common theme across the album.  It was also a lot more vocal-focused than previous albums.  It's still had some great songs, and I'm not entirely anti-pop either. Slania, for the most part, was the album that had the most metal element in my opinion, and even that had a lot of pop structures.  It kind of fits since they're going for a 'new age' sound, but, as a musician, I'm a huge fan of the more dynamic structure such as a lot of Ensiferum's longer songs.  I hope I've not gone too in depth and managed to cover an acceptable response for you!"
folkmetal,2a8qhi,SpicyCornflake,2,Thu Jul 24 03:37:06 2014 UTC,Well if Slania had Pop elements I don't care because it is my favourite Eluveitie album.

folkmetal,2a8qhi,sp4ce,5,Wed Jul 9 17:35:19 2014 UTC,Eluveitie is certainly on the line. The lead single from their new album is a lot more metal than this one.
folkmetal,2a8qhi,dark_roast,2,Wed Jul 9 18:15:41 2014 UTC,"The majority of their songs are metal. Their last album only had one ""Folk Rock"" song."
folkmetal,2a8qhi,Oden_son,4,Thu Jul 10 01:23:27 2014 UTC,"They pretty much just take folk and branch off in all directions from there. Stuff like Havoc and Nil are undeniably metal, while stuff like Memento and Jezaig verge on pure folk. Havoc Nil And then stuff like Memento Jezaig (has guitar/drum backing, but super folksy songwriting and overall sound)"
folkmetal,2a8qhi,eliguy666,-1,Thu Jul 10 00:16:34 2014 UTC,"While I like the song and always like the female vocals, it's pretty similar to a lot of there other stuff.  They could just as easily transition into the chorus from ""A Rose for Epona"" or many other songs so they really aren't expanding their musical style much...   The folk instruments are great though."

folkmetal,29i5eg,alexaxrossiya,2,Thu Jul 3 02:50:51 2014 UTC,"Although in the link text I said ""this one specific"" song, actually the whole album this song is from, Aealo, has a lot of other songs that also have this sort of sound.    To a lesser extent there is also the odd folk (IMO) element in one or two songs on albums before and after that one also, e.g. Nemesis on Theogonia, Cine Iubeste Si Lasa on Kata Ton Daimona Eaytoy.    To me, this is interesting to share because I think many people would assume from the band's name + not having heard the music that the band is probably black metal, vs. not expecting them to have this kind of sound.  Re: ""that sort of folk instrument"": Personally I too would like to hear more of this instrumentation and/or female singing style.  But the only other example that comes right to my mind is from another Greek band, Preemptive Strike.  This band is NOT metal - they are industrial aggrotech - but some of their songs have ""ethnic"" sounds / progressions that strangely remind me of Rotting Christ.  Best examples are TALOS and Hubris.  As an added bonus, they are still heavy (albeit not in a ""metal"" way) and are singing about Greek mythology in many cases.  I got a few of my buddies to listen to this band by calling them ""Rotting Christ: the dance remixes"" - LOL.  All somewhat tangential to ""actual"" folk metal, but I'm hoping some folks enjoy it nonetheless."

folkmetal,29fnsu,AfricanBerryPicker,1 point,Tue Jul 8 04:51:35 2014 UTC,"I'd love if you asked them about the evolution of their sound.  for example, their demo and first album relied very heavily on atmosphere.  Some of their songs even boarder lined soundscapes.  Then, when sagas came out, they began to rely more on the riff, but still retained a healthy atmosphere.  With Rekreatur, they began to sound closer to a heavy metal band with folk influences which was further solidified with Erdentemple.   Not that this is a bad thing, I'm just super interested to here what influenced the change."

The vocals will take some getting used to but this is the first Middle Eastern-themed folk metal I think I've heard, at least as far as I can remember unless Salem counts.  If anyone has similar recommendations, I'd love to know."
folkmetal,28or8b,Gowhere,3,Sat Jun 21 15:20:12 2014 UTC,"Check out Melechesh. They're an Israeli band who also fuses black metal with middle-eastern folk instrumentation very well.  Also, though they're more staight death metal, Lykathea Aflame is a band that has some strong middle-eastern style melodies as well."
folkmetal,28or8b,WolferaTheJackal,2,Sat Jun 21 18:50:04 2014 UTC,"I was wandering around youtube today and stumbled across a band called Seeds of Iblis who is apparently part of an ""Arabic Anti-Islamic Legion"" or some such thing involving 3 or 4 other black metal bands.  Most of it seemed even less listenable than this though, both re: arrangements and re: recording quality (I know it is not ""cool"" to complain about recording quality with black metal, but still).  Too bad because I would LOVE to find a black metal band who carries on about Iblis the same way the European guys carry on about Satan - sadly my tastes are more toward the symphonic end than the lo-fi end and I haven't found anything that really grips me yet on that front.  Way less heavy than all of the above, there's also Orphaned Land.  I find them a lot more interesting to listen to than the more black-metal-leaning stuff from the region that I've encountered so far... Melechesh being a prime exception, i.e. I agree with the other poster on that front re: they're very good."

Their record company however, is called ""Shaytan Productions"" literally meaning Satan's production. That's a name they wouldn't get away with in Saudi-Arabia."

The way it transitions the entire album, and how it comes in from Heiderauche is just beautiful. I love the whole album, as many do, and early on I really like Wurzelbert, Blut Im Auge, and Unbesiegt, but there's just something about the tone of that song that haunts me, and I love it.  Erdentempel is also amazing, of course. I love the variety of the album (though Heavy Chill is sometimes just a little too off the rails for me, though I still like it), and how it brings back some of the folksiness that was lost on Rekreatur. I think my early favorites are Karawane, Uns'rer Floten Klang, and Apokalypse."

I think Erdentempel is definitely on par (perhaps even ahead) of Sagas.  Every song is just so enjoyable and uplifting.  I have been listening to it non-stop for three weeks now.

folkmetal,28cww8,Flexed_,1 point,Fri Jun 20 09:25:29 2014 UTC,"Eluveitie SHOULD be a band that I absolutely love, but they aren't and I still don't know why.  I enjoy their music and have three of their albums, but it still doesn't really do it for me.    My favourite Eluveitie songs are the ones with the female vocals as I feel they suit the music the most.  ""Inis Mona"" is probably the exception.    I'll eventually get the new album but I'm not ""hyped"" for it.  I actually really want to enjoy Eluveitie as I love the folk instruments they use, but they are just one of those bands for me that you try to like a lot but just never seem to excite you.    EDIT: Just listened to ""King"" from the new album.  Yep.  Still doesn't do anything for me.  It just sounds so similar to their other material.  I mean, in some ways you want to hear something familiar as that's why you like a band, but sometimes it's just too similar.  Just doesn't sound like anything new.  Hard to judge an album from one song though.  Who knows, the rest could be amazing."
folkmetal,28cww8,LordJanas,1 point,Fri Jun 20 15:09:53 2014 UTC,"Maybe it's because they've been my favorite band for so long, but I personally think every album has a very distinct sound. Their guitar work, while not incredibly impressive has been getting alot more interesting over each album. My only complaint was that it seemed like they were using a little less folk on each release, but from the sound of King and the couple live songs I heard from Origins, this one will have the folk I've been missing."
folkmetal,28cww8,Oden_son,1 point,Sun Jun 22 00:57:44 2014 UTC,Out of curiosity do you like dark tranquillity? if you don't that might be why. Eluveitie has always been a melodic death metal band that interjects folk instruments and stylings. They don't really approach songwriting like a pure folk band (Evocation is the exception here because its a folk album with no electric instruments)
folkmetal,28cww8,JaxRiens,1 point,Mon Jun 23 17:33:09 2014 UTC,"I think that's part of the problem.  I don't think the metal parts are that interesting and the male vocals are not appealing to me.  I love harsh vocals but his can sound really lame at times.    I really love melodic metal.  My favourite folk bans are Finntroll, Equilibrium and Moonsorrow among others.  I've just never been convinced by the melodies of Eluveitie.  Some are really good, but I feel that once you've heard one, you've heard them all.    I do however love the folk parts of their songs and as I mentioned I think the female vocals (like in ""Slainia's Song"") are far more appropriate and interesting."

Most Viking metal bands tell stories, although not all of them are ballads.  Amon Amarth has some great ballad/stories, namely Last With Pagan Blood, Where Silent Gods Stand Guard, Warriors of the North, Embrace of the Endless Ociean, Prediction of Warfare, and my favorite, Thousand Years of Oppression."
folkmetal,27ypsm,Conan97,1 point,Tue Jun 24 21:52:44 2014 UTC,"It's kind of made OK by the fact that they know their entire act and music is gimmicky.    The melodies in this song could easily transition into anyone of their drinking songs and the lyrics are unoriginal by the bands own admission, but they know this.  It's just so damn fun and you know it's going to be cheesy and stupid-in-a-fun-way.    Just look at Chris Bowe's side project, Gloryhammer.  He is spreading the cheese from pirates to medieval battles. I think this verse from ""Scraping the Barrel"" sums it all up:  Many have told us that we can't go on  That one day we'll run out of lyrics for songs  But when the time comes to write album four  We'll scrape out the barrel once more"

The folk parts to their songs are amazing but I just don't like the metal that they play.  I already bought my ticket for their headlining tour mainly to see Tyr.  Maybe seeing them live will change my mind.
folkmetal,27wxe0,MetalChimp,2,Fri Jun 13 03:19:42 2014 UTC,"I went to see them live a few years ago, they just played Helvetios through in its entirety, and at the end of their encore was an extended jam of Tegernako (IMHO their best song), we had an epic circle pit around a few people who actually knew some step-dance, it was amazing."
folkmetal,27wxe0,MetalChimp,1 point,Sat Jun 14 01:30:30 2014 UTC,"TBH, i didn't like this song that much. Now, it wasn't bad, but it was like Home from Helvetios. It's the one I skip when i'm not intending to listen to the whole album."

folkmetal,27rkid,cheburashechka,7,Tue Jun 10 05:53:01 2014 UTC,"Let's see what I can remember... I'll start with folk albums from metal bands.  Arkona released a compilation of their acoustic folk songs for free online, called Akustika. Drudkh has ""Songs of Grief and Solitude,"" but it is mainly the folk melodies from their metal songs, taken and made into folk songs. Ulver has that one folk album, Kveldssanger.   Svarga has a folk album- Krov'-Reka, a live acoustic album- Vetry proschayut vsyo, and a few collaboration folk singles. 1 2 3  Do you know Fejd?  Shedda. Svarica. Jar. [:TEUFELSTANZ:]  Leidungr, they have an EP and a full length. 1 2  Veter Vody and Vedan Kolod are also nice.  Maybe not what you want, but Otava yo has a nice style and you can get most of their music for free online (legally, I mean).  Again, not really what you what, but I love Melnitsa. 1 2  I know there's a lot I'm forgetting- sorry if these aren't what you wanted.  Definitely not what you're asking for, but in case you're interested in more different folk/folk rock =p : Jaromír Nohavica - Těšínská | Brathanki - Siebie dam po ślubie | Golec uOrkiestra - Pędzą konie"

folkmetal,27rkid,glashgkullthethird,2,Tue Jun 10 10:52:12 2014 UTC,I highly recommend Vedan Kolod (Russian ethno folk band) and Słońcakres album by Stworz (actually a Polish folk/black metal band that did one pure folk album)

folkmetal,27rkid,Didgeridoox,1 point,Thu Jun 12 14:32:43 2014 UTC,"Except he/she was looking for the kind of folk that influences most folk metal- just searching ""folk"" is often not sufficient, as the term describes a VERY broad range of music. For example, you could go to /r/folk and see- while they accept this type of ""folk,"" most of the things posted there are not the type of ""folk"" OP wanted."
folkmetal,27r4td,WolferaTheJackal,17,Tue Jun 10 02:33:49 2014 UTC,"I personally fucking love Blodsvept. It's got a lot of great folksy, polka influence. I mean, I appreciate the whole black metal appeal but as someone who is primarily a folk/thrash/power fan, it definitely appeals to me for different reasons.  But the ears are somehow making it hard to take people seriously? Are we forgetting that people do not take corpsepaint seriously? Or that the whole idea of Satanism, trolls, death, etc. aren't taken seriously outside of metal? There's no way the ears are going to be the one thing that will stop people from taking polka metal seriously. It's something that you either appreciate or don't- it may grow on you but it's never gonna grow on you if you don't give a shot, you know?  Plus, the ears are part of the stage show. From Behemoth's aesthetics to Maiden's antics, it's all very showman-y. The ears are simply part of putting on the show and I'm not sure how that would detract from the music they play.  Metal tends to be pretty divisive already. Some people are going to hate anything that makes it look like the band cares more about appearance than the music, which I can understand. However, I think if they cared about appearance over music, they wouldn't be playing polka metal. I think the ears are pretty cool and the effort to put on a full-fledged show is always appreciated by me."
folkmetal,27r4td,InvokingTheAncients,4,Tue Jun 10 03:06:18 2014 UTC,"Some people are going to hate anything that makes it look like the band cares more about appearance than the music   Agreed, and IMHO those people are idiots. They seem to think a band isn't able to do two things well, or that having an image that doesn't come from lyrics or interviews will somehow compromise their music."
folkmetal,27r4td,blueskin,3,Tue Jun 10 07:56:35 2014 UTC,I love Blodsvept. Maybe not quite as much as some of their older albums but it's still a really good album.  As for the ears. When did they start doing that? I haven't seen them play live for a couple of years now so it might have happened since the last time but I've never noticed them/
folkmetal,27r4td,ghostlight_ross,1 point,Tue Jun 10 15:14:36 2014 UTC,"I could be wrong, but I am strongly under the impression that they started doing it on the most recent tour.  Pretty sure as well that Vreth's coat in addition to the ears = same as in the video for Haxbrygd.  ""Let's make the best use of awesome props we used in a music video and wear that get-up on stage too"" = a principle I approve of, as it seems to me it's working well for Behemoth these days also."
folkmetal,27r4td,ghostlight_ross,1 point,Tue Jun 10 22:36:24 2014 UTC,Guess that's why I've not noticed it then. I haven't seen them play for a few years now.

folkmetal,27r4td,doberwoman,2,Tue Jun 10 07:55:04 2014 UTC,The ears go well with the rest of their costume. I liked it. I wish i had pictures of that show :(
folkmetal,27r4td,Crosstitution,2,Tue Jun 10 15:05:23 2014 UTC,"honestly, whatever i think the new album is rad,  i pre-ordered with with a shirt + cd bundle.   I love the ears and everything, any band that is willing to have cool costumes that corresponded with their music is swell in my books  do not give a fuck what some butthurt fan is saying.  if you like it, awesome. if you don't like, it cool  no one needs to make a huge discussion about this, the band will decide to do whatever they want regardless and it is their decision."
folkmetal,27r4td,Mighty_Cthulhu,2,Tue Jun 10 15:12:43 2014 UTC,"Male here, I don't give a flying fuck about the ears. Finntroll is still awesome so the ears don't mean shit to me."
folkmetal,27r4td,quiveringpotato,2,Tue Jun 10 16:00:57 2014 UTC,"I thought the ears are funny and oddly cute in a way, too (male, n-no homo..), but I don't think they detract from their stage presence.  The whole steampunk thing with Blodsvept made me a bit confused at first, but I'm not really complaining, still sounds like Finntroll and I love it. It's a lot more ""playful"" in a way than Nifelvind, in my opinion, but I think that goes well with their style of folk music."
folkmetal,27r4td,kungfuferret,2,Tue Jun 10 20:35:29 2014 UTC,"Honestly, I like the pagentry of folk metal, it only adds to the experience, especially at shows. There isn't a band that takes the stage that isn't concerned with image, especially the ones that try to convince you otherwise.   I didn't hate the steam punk, but I like the older aesthetics they've gone back too. If for no other reason it'll help keep the hipster crowd at bay."
folkmetal,27r4td,LordJanas,1 point,Mon Jun 16 16:23:12 2014 UTC,"I thought Niflevind and Blodsvept were by far their best.  They were never  ""black metal"" and you can tell in their latest album that it's still Finntroll, playing the same music, but with new ideas.  I personally love Blodsvept and think it's another great album like their previous ones.    The ears might seem silly, but who cares?  It doesn't affect their sound at all.  The reason I love Finntroll is their music and that's how it should always be.  If you let image dictate what you listen to, you're going to miss out on a lot of good music and that's just a pity."
folkmetal,27r4td,roistot,1 point,Tue Jun 10 22:17:37 2014 UTC,"I like all their albums, but i don't like their latest as much as the rest, still like it though. I don't like it as much because I feel it is more guitar first and orientated and other instruments later, the guitar is louder than the other instruments in the album most of the time, and feels like it is the melody line."
folkmetal,27r4td,MightySquidWarrior,1 point,Thu Jun 12 12:33:17 2014 UTC,"I love all of Finntroll's albums, but I thought Blodsvept was exceptionally good.  I appreciated how fun and upbeat it was; it stands out from the darker stuff I normally listen to.    The ears are just part of the image they're going for, and I don't see why anyone would get butthurt about it.  Finntroll is a troll-obsessed band; if anything it should come as a surprise that it took this long for them to dress up like that."
folkmetal,27r4td,TheBloodofKingu,1 point,Sat Jun 14 00:33:43 2014 UTC,"Who cares? The way I see it, they probably just wanted to have a bit of fun and thought it was would be funny."

folkmetal,27dpv8,JustAPoring,3,Thu Jun 5 15:18:40 2014 UTC,"Mhm. Its their best album in terms of atmosphere and production. I'd definitely say ""Apokalypse"", ""Stein meiner Ahnen"" and ""Ankunft"" are the best songs on the album. Sagas is probably still my favorite album though because it was the first metal album I ever bought and some of the songs are just unbeatable. :P"
folkmetal,27dpv8,JustAPoring,2,Thu Jun 5 16:37:51 2014 UTC,"I'm still undecided if it's better than Sagas and Turis Fratyr, but it definitely better than Rekreatur."

folkmetal,27dpv8,scy1192,1 point,Fri Jun 6 14:37:57 2014 UTC,"It wasn't bad, of course, but in my opinion it was their weakest album, probably because it was straight after the switch from Helge."
folkmetal,27dpv8,Vagar,2,Fri Jun 6 15:59:41 2014 UTC,"Listened to it in the car this morning. It's alright and certainly better than Rekreatur as a whole but that's it, sadly. I feel like the big selling point of this album is 'Waldschrein', like 'Der Ewige Sieg' was for Rekreatur or 'Blut im Auge'/'Unbesiegt' on Sagas. And I feel it's quite a bit weaker than all three of those. 'Stein meiner Ahnen' is quite nice, it has a Turis Fratyr vibe, at least lyrically.    What I also noticed was, that the vocals are a lot further in the background than on their earlier albums. Not sure if that's something to do with Robse's style but I liked it better when the vocals had a more central role. (Liked Helge's vocals better as well.)    Solid album altogether, just not worldshaking."
folkmetal,27dpv8,Skogrheim,1 point,Fri Jun 6 13:29:54 2014 UTC,"Did you notice that Waldschrein on this album is a bit different from on the EP release? It's mainly small tweaks, but the ending has been amped up a bit, in my opinion, and the vocals are further in the background like you said."
folkmetal,27dpv8,CookieMan0,1 point,Sat Jun 7 22:05:11 2014 UTC,"Nice, thanks for that, I hadn't listened to the EP.

I saw this post a little while after it was submitted and figured by the description that it was almost definitely Arkona, but I don't know their catalog know whether the melody OP linked to was one of their's or not."

folkmetal,26zp10,Aunvilgod,2,Fri Jun 6 10:48:58 2014 UTC,"This song might not be metal, that is true. But it certainly isn't post-rock either. Most of their music is post-rock, but this song is not. I don't know exactly what it is, but it has folk music mixed with heavy guitars and drums, so I thought it might be of interest here."

folkmetal,26vbq4,User1-1A,2,Fri May 30 21:20:05 2014 UTC,I started listening to them before the show just to get familiar. Pleasantly surprised and they were great on stage! And then Spotify stopped carrying their album :-/

I would love to hear the music you continue to write as it is far more musically mature than a lot of existing folk metal bands who are content being Ensiferum or Finntroll 2.0.

folkmetal,25hom7,Skogrheim,2,Tue May 13 23:07:49 2014 UTC,Beast Dominator himself posted this statement as well.  It's always sad to see a long established band member depart.  I wonder if he'll stay with metal -- or even music -- or if he'll go on to other things.
folkmetal,25gpjr,Roryf,2,Tue May 13 17:22:42 2014 UTC,I have always wondered if Moonsorrow's lyrics are cringy or cheesy. It's hard to tell from the translations.   Does anyone who speaks Finnish have any insights?

folkmetal,2544rn,lewie,2,Fri May 9 20:36:11 2014 UTC,"Kinda. It's in a shit neighborhood (there's an adult video store across the street, that's it). Parking lot is just the gravel area behind it. It hasn't been renovated in forever. There are no stall doors (probably to see if people are doing drugs), and people piss on the bathroom floor. But going to a concert like this, there are tons of big bearded guys that tend to ward off thugs and bums. I haven't felt unsafe during a concert, but I wouldn't stand around to chill afterwards."

Here  One thing Masha said about the album is that it is more ""serious"" so there are no songs like Stenka na Stenku or Yarilo on it. No ""fun"" songs. It is about the separation from the material world. Being Siberian & then being from Moscow I get what they mean."
folkmetal,241bfx,pfk505,1 point,Sun Apr 27 07:27:28 2014 UTC,I would agree with her assessment of the album.. I'm just curious how actual fans will find it.  I'm going to reserve judgment and listen to it a few more times.  Its definitely a departure though.
folkmetal,241bfx,ragnarok73,1 point,Sun Apr 27 07:42:16 2014 UTC,It has something of a progressive bend that caught me off guard. I've listened to it 5 times by now and will still need a few spins to let it sink in.
folkmetal,241bfx,princess_reyja,1 point,Sun Apr 27 14:43:31 2014 UTC,"Been listening to it non-stop since I got it and already had the chance to see new songs live a few times. Especially Yav' and Na Strazhe Novyh Let are incredibly powerful live songs! About the album - I love it's complexity. Every time I listen to a song, I discover new sound elements and structures. It might be difficult for fans of, say, Goi Rode Goi or Vo Slavu Velikim to get into it because of the many progressive parts and lack of folk elements, but I think the change of sound was an important step - and I know it wasn't easy for them.  Imo Masha's songwriting grew and developed further with every release. Each song has it's very own character but they perfectly fit together on one album (that's what I missed a little on Slovo). This makes Yav almost a concept album and it's message is a very important one - so it's good they published English translations of the songs. I've always been a fan of their ""darker"" or more serious songs, so I really don't miss the ""fun"" ones."

folkmetal,23ogtt,Holyrapid,1 point,Tue Apr 22 14:10:03 2014 UTC,I'm always confused when people speak of Celtic metal. Are they referring to a specific sub - genre of folk metal consisting of bands which are from geographical locations which historical spoke Celtic dialects or is it just an umbrella term for pagan metal/folk metal with western European sounding melodies?
folkmetal,23ogtt,AStraightLine,2,Tue Apr 22 15:27:23 2014 UTC,"To me celtic metal would mean folk metal that sounds similar to this compilation, i guess"

I've known about this band for a couple years and just figured it was NDH and not Folk Metal.  Those two genres really evoke the same things for me, but not for everyone.  Early Letzte Instanz is also violin-heavy NDH that sounds folky.  There is a languishing /r/NDH, perhaps some of us here might be interested in."
folkmetal,23ndrs,alexaxrossiya,3,Tue Apr 22 21:05:49 2014 UTC,Maybe he means the Jewish thing but everyone here surely knows of Orphaned Land.

Northland - The old towns inn  Svartsot - Havfruens Kvæd  Cruachan - Celtica  Equilibrium - Blut Im Auge - Now there's a popular song if ever I saw one :P  Aether realm - Ravensong - This is a little more on the melodeath side of things but it's folky enough :)  Svartby - Scum from under water  Mithotyn - In the sign of ravens - Blackened  forefather - The shield wall - A lot blackened  Ásmegin - Bruderov Paa Haegstadtun  Lumsk - I lytinne två - This may be too slow, they mainly write slow churning riffs but this riff just feels a little faster. This one will be hit or miss.  Myrkgrav - De to spellemenn - I find this incredibly uplifting  Otyg - Villevandring - I cant find a link for this but it's on spotify :) great band, really consistent.  Nomans land - Torir scald  Well that's all I can think of for now. I'll edit if I think of any more. :) Hope these are on target, Enjoy."

Fferyllt - Йолль  Glittertind - Rolandskvadet - There are faster songs on the Til Dovre Faller EP too, but this is just so epic.  But, maybe a sea shanty - Longships and Mead or... this... Trollbunden which I'm not sure is even Folk Metal anymore, but I do like the beat.  Gwydion - Mead of Poetry - Also most of Horn Triskelion and Ŷnys Mön are great.  Haven't listened to Veteran much, but it's their latest.  Heidevolk - Wodan Heerst - or just go full on mastodon riding crazy with their excellent cover of Vulgaris Magistralis  Månegarm - Nattsjäl, Drömsjäl - fairly upbeat, much of their stuff isn't.  Not really atmospheric, just not upbeat.  Skadika - Frost  Thyrfing - Mjölner  Týr - Flames of the Free - I guess some of their older stuff might be a bit atmospheric, but as my favorite band, I had to include something.  Also Hold the Heather Hammer High!  Vanir - Elverkongens Brud - They are often compared to Svartsot.  And some Industrial Folk Metal  MystTerra - Đurđevdan  Tanzwut - Das Gerücht - wonderful video!  They are pretty much just electro industrial at this point, save for the bagpipes, but maybe you'll enjoy it.  edit: formatting"

folkmetal,21vtjs,Celtinarius,1 point,Tue Apr 1 21:55:29 2014 UTC,"It clearly goes beyond similar keys and having simple rhythms in common. This isn't the only Finterforst song that sounds like it has a lot of Moonsorrow melodies and riffs put into it, in fact the only reason I had heard about Finterforst was because so many people complained about it ripping off Moonsorrow, including the band itself."
folkmetal,21vtjs,Hobodoctor,1 point,Wed Apr 2 02:53:08 2014 UTC,This might not be true with their latest album which I think is quite a bit better than their earlier work.

I don't know if that being recent means it's off the new album.
folkmetal,21vtjs,Hobodoctor,1 point,Wed Apr 2 02:49:54 2014 UTC,Sounds like people are saying that the new album is a rip off of Moonsorrow. I couldn't say I agree. I would take that as a compliment and say that is reason enough to give it a listen.

Don't get me wrong, ""The Edge"" is one of my favorite songs of theirs, the song that actually got me into Tyr in the first place. The only problem is, unless you can be more specific, the answer is probably as simple as that Heri's song writing has changed. I just want to make sure I do your question justice."
folkmetal,217e92,SpicyCornflake,1 point,Tue Mar 25 01:34:03 2014 UTC,"Damn, sorry I'm late with this, but I guess the thing would be songwriting and album progression. There were choruses, but the verses were diverse.  This is opposed to their more recent songwriting style which relies on catchy repeated riffs, and less on dynamic song structure.  I still like Týr, but damn do I wish they would go back to the more progressive song structure.  It added a whole new element of storytelling that you just can't grasp with the verse-prechorus-chorus-verse style with similar verses.  I guess the best way, from a songwriting perspective, to describe it would be that the chorus resolved and transitioned the verses rather than the verses leading up to the chorus.  More emphasis on verse and other structures or whatever you want to call it."

folkmetal,217e92,Conan97,4,Mon Mar 24 16:03:41 2014 UTC,"I'll see about asking him, though I've asked him this before. Unfortunately it is a matter of playing new songs, a lack of time, and playing songs for both old and new fans. A song like Land, even though Heri said it's the one song he wishes he could ever play live, will most likely never be played on tour. On this tour, I can tell you its all about time--they only have five songs to play since they're an opener, and since they have a new album out, those will be mostly new songs. I will be sure to include your interest though when I ask him about an upcoming headlning tour, which will hopefully be soon."

They should make on with a bunch of other images of big folk metal bands.  Maybe it would end up looking bad, but it would be better than just having one band up there for the whole genre.  Don't insult Finntroll though, Finntroll is the shit."
folkmetal,20vges,Conan97,2,Thu Mar 20 05:03:45 2014 UTC,I was not trying to insult.  I like Finntroll and really enjoyed seeing them on their most recent U.S. tour.  I still think the picture looks silly though.

folkmetal,20vges,ragnarok73,4,Thu Mar 20 14:16:33 2014 UTC,That's exactly why I love folk metal. It's a beautiful genre.
folkmetal,20vges,LordJanas,1 point,Thu Mar 20 04:03:53 2014 UTC,"""I'd like to see a band that is more representative of the values I find in folk metal""  While some bands may just be in for fun and giggles, it's very common that their members be keen on reconnecting with folk culture. The use of traditional instruments is only half of it and right off the bat, I can't think of a band with no lyrics referring to their native lore and history. What you see in the picture is exactly that. These are core values in folk metal.   It's very telling of the cultural cleansing we've been put through over the past centuries that you see ""evil/satanic themes"" when someone dresses up as a mythical creature. That's where ridiculousness lies to me."
folkmetal,20vges,EinWindir,1 point,Thu Mar 20 10:37:49 2014 UTC,"I should have worded this differently and/or clarified better.  I do not see this pictures as being ""evil"" but I would fit it into the gimmicky area.  I really like Finntroll but just don't like this picture.  Just my opinion."
folkmetal,20vges,kungfuferret,1 point,Thu Mar 20 13:49:22 2014 UTC,"You talk about the ""light hearted"" and ""fun"" atmosphere of Folk metal but then complain that they look silly.  If they were ""light hearted"" and ""fun"" wouldn't a comical look be fitting?  I totally disagree with the generalization of Folk metal as a light-hearted genre as many of my favorite bands I love because their music and lyrics convey their culture and atmosphere which is able to express deeper emotions; not because they occasionally sing drinking songs.  EDIT: The banner is also probably old because this isn't a massive subreddit with constant traffic."
folkmetal,20vges,3uphor1a,1 point,Fri Mar 21 07:18:43 2014 UTC,"I owe it more to a lazy mod. When he first posted it over a year ago he said he was going to change it every week to ""feature"" a different folk metal band.  It lasted one week. The first week."
folkmetal,20rh8f,KorpensVinger,2,Tue Mar 18 23:29:03 2014 UTC,"This was interesting. I really like the instrumental pieces and the weird time-signature stuff going on, and the vocals sound really, really familiar (almost like Melechesh). Pretty solid song, 8/10."

I love this album and evidently so does everyone else :D but it seems to be some what of a consensus that it's a bit asian sounding? Though it doesn't sound asian to me I'd be curious for timestamps of these asian-sounding bits :D
folkmetal,20p14c,Aedalas,3,Tue Mar 18 04:42:55 2014 UTC,"Check out this video. You get to hear a lot of the individual tracks to Sons of Winter and Stars, there are definitely a few Asian elements in there.   Also, if you're curious, I believe the reason you are being downvoted is because Wintersun isn't really considered folk metal. I personally think it fits here as it is very folk-like, but not many agree.  Edit: Video was taken down, replaced the link with one that works."
folkmetal,20p14c,whats8,2,Tue Mar 18 10:56:10 2014 UTC,what would you call wintersun?
folkmetal,20p14c,Aedalas,6,Tue Mar 18 17:01:58 2014 UTC,Melodic death metal.
folkmetal,20p14c,kyldunn88,1 point,Tue Mar 18 17:13:47 2014 UTC,"Interesting! I am relatively new to the metal world, so please forgive my dumb questions. I'm I guess familiar with symphonic black metal (people like Dimmu Borgir) and can understand the difference in vocal style between Wintersun and Dimmu but are there other factors?   I am often miscategorizing bands and would love to get better at it so I can not only discuss them intelligently but also find new bands :). I often will look at metalarchives.com but never thought to for Wintersun and, sure enough, they agree with you :)."
folkmetal,20p14c,Valhalla_Awaits,1 point,Wed Mar 19 02:45:54 2014 UTC,"Because of the vocals? Stylistically it's almost nothing like death metal, besides the vocals, which are more in line with black metal if anything.  I'd describe Wintersun as progressive power metal with harsh vocals."
folkmetal,20p14c,Aedalas,1 point,Tue Mar 18 17:41:41 2014 UTC,I'd say it depends a lot on which album you're talking about. I do think the cover a lot of sub-genres though and I don't really think of them as a pure death metal.
folkmetal,20p14c,Aedalas,-1,Tue Mar 18 18:06:48 2014 UTC,would blind guardian also be considered melodic death metal?

folkmetal,20nq6h,cothem,1 point,Mon Mar 17 20:57:13 2014 UTC,"I'm not. But I will definitely check them out. Our influences vary a bit. The singer and the other guitarist and I all came from an extreme metal background. But we all felt like doing something different. So this happened. The violinist is classically trained and listens to pretty much everything, but makes he's own electronic music. So the influences are from everywhere. But we tried to keep it as a different take on how we used to make music. Thanks man!"

folkmetal,2069bq,PirateVikingNinja,3,Tue Mar 11 23:02:22 2014 UTC,"I know right! its weird cause he has kinda slowly changed over the years from playing guitar to just vocals. I think Manala showed a great change in his voice and it was really fresh. I'm really looking forward to his album.  I got the feeling he was quite a timid guy, I got the chance to meet Korpi when I was in Australia and he was a pretty quiet guy off stage but really relaxed and down to earth. I had this little wooden pendant I made years back with the shaman logo on it and just carried it everywhere like a traveling charm because of the whole journey man thing, I had it at the gig and gave him it and he was really appreciative. I bumped into him after the gig and he was wearing it attached to his necklace(s) and I almost totally geeked out but managed to wait till he had went away before I almost lost it. It was a great feeling and awesome seeing them live and meeting them.  I hope he tours solo, do you think he will?"

folkmetal,205898,TheBloodofKingu,4,Tue Mar 11 15:38:52 2014 UTC,"I would say E Standard, Eb Standard or D Standard."
folkmetal,205898,MeatloafCupcake,4,Tue Mar 11 20:01:19 2014 UTC,"(to add to MeatloafCupcake) Like above, except it's really genre dependent so if you're interested in more powermetally, early Elvenking type folk-metal then any of the above, but if you're more into Viking metal they'll be tuned lower generally. E and D standard are the most common tunings, if you have a floating bridge switching between tunings is a hassle so either pick a tuning you personally like or get more than one guitar and keep them at different tunings."
folkmetal,205898,Laggyzaki,1 point,Wed Mar 12 14:33:05 2014 UTC,"Amon Amarth plays B and occasionally A, which is pretty insane.  Tyr uses 7 strings that range from a high E to B.  I don't know about any others but I assume it's in the vicinity of E or D for most bands."
folkmetal,205898,Conan97,3,Fri Mar 14 05:06:38 2014 UTC,"I don't think its about a specific tuning more about the tune you get from it. you can make any kind of music with any kind of tuning if you try hard enough. when it comes to folk metal I see the guitar as less of a main instrument because I think there are different areas added in like: Pipes, Violin, Accordion etc. but thats just my opinion its still an important part tho."
folkmetal,205898,BearWarcry,1 point,Tue Mar 11 21:42:21 2014 UTC,that does make alot of sense
folkmetal,205898,BearWarcry,1 point,Tue Mar 11 23:24:40 2014 UTC,What I mean is you shouldn't try to just restrict yourself to one type of tuning for playing folk metal. its more about the tunes you make than the tuning its in. just my opinion tho
folkmetal,205898,TRAIANVS,2,Wed Mar 12 00:36:07 2014 UTC,Folk metal bands don't use downtuned guitars nearly as much as other subgenres of metal such as doom or death metal to name a few. It really just depends on the band.
folkmetal,205898,Bassist408,2,Tue Mar 11 16:25:44 2014 UTC,My band uses Drop G (7 string) and drop C (6 string) but its rare for folk metal bands to go so low.  I'd say D standard would be the most common alternate tuning.
folkmetal,205898,PirateVikingNinja,2,Tue Mar 11 20:12:21 2014 UTC,"Nothing too wild generally (either E standard, E flat, drop D, or D standard, much like you'd see in most metal) with the exception of Finntroll.  Finntroll are weird..."

folkmetal,205898,Von_Skyhawk,1 point,Tue Mar 11 17:49:12 2014 UTC,Most of the stuff seems to be played in standard. I've heard some acoustic tracks played in an open tuning though so you could explore that a bit. /r/guitar would be a good source for some more info on that if you like.

Most of the bands base their songs on some kind of history, take for example Finntroll, Vanir, Bathory, Waylander or even Eluveitie. I'm sure you're going to find some nice songs.  Summoning has a lot of awesome songs based on the Lord of the rings lore."

I like this sort of thing, but I was just thinking that I've never heard a metal adaptation of any child ballad. Even the Twa Corbies. Which is weird, because every non-metal folk singer has recorded some child ballads, and plenty of the have pretty metal subject matter. The Twa Corbies is a dialog between two crows talking about eating a dead knight, for god's sake.   Well, if no one here knows of any, I guess I'll go hunting through metal-archives myself."
folkmetal,2052om,Zengerowitch,2,Wed Mar 12 12:39:38 2014 UTC,"My bad, IN extremo is actually the ""Herr Manneling"". I'm not sure if this is a child ballad but it is a ballad of a troll who got inlove with a knight. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herr_Mannelig"

It's not a child ballad, as those are specifically Anglo-Scots ballads (also found in places where Anglos and Scots emigrated) collected by Francis James Child in the late 19th century.

folkmetal,20436g,ragnarok73,5,Tue Mar 11 18:15:52 2014 UTC,Panopticon They have some purely accoustic tracks http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBzd8yMUs1k and use folk instruments on some songs as well http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=sPDqAmKnCp4#t=285
folkmetal,20436g,iaminthewoods,3,Tue Mar 11 11:35:06 2014 UTC,"Most, if not all of Panopticon is on bandcamp.  This is a concept record about coal mining with lots of bluegrass parts: http://thetruepanopticon.bandcamp.com/album/kentucky  I find, however, some of the metal arrangements don't really do it for me, particularly the tin whistle."

folkmetal,202zzu,eirinlinn,3,Tue Mar 11 03:12:49 2014 UTC,"I'm honestly surprised that there isn't more Japanese folk metal. Japanese history and mythology has plenty of source material to draw from. The Warring States Period and the Gempei War would be perfect for samurai themed stuff and there's plenty of pretty metal mythology on top of that. Hell, a god pulled a magic sword our of a 8-headed serpent he defeated by getting it drunk. How fucking metal is that? On top of that, traditional Japanese instruments would fit just as well as Celtic ones. Hell, the Yoshida Brothers are pretty popular. Why can't I have something like that, just metal?"
folkmetal,202zzu,lordsick3,3,Tue Mar 11 04:22:36 2014 UTC,"Whispered is a Finnish band that incorporates a lot of Japanese culture, melodic structure, and other stuff into their music. They're really symphonic folk metal, but hey, brutal music is brutal. Thousand Swords is a good place to start."
folkmetal,202zzu,fellchieftan,2,Wed Mar 12 00:53:15 2014 UTC,"They aren't folk metal, but I noticed in some of Wintersun's songs there seems to be kind of a Chinese element to it."

folkmetal,203hgx,kbruno711,1 point,Tue Mar 11 00:38:34 2014 UTC,"Anyone else think the vocals sound quite odd at times?  Like some sort of unintentional vibrato ""bleeting?""  I mean obviously this reminds me of Alestorm, but the thing is, Alestorm isn't that original, just massively fun.  (I absolutely love how tongue in cheek they are: they know their music is a thematic joke!)  So when you take something that sounds like something that wasn't that unique to begin with, it ends up not being that impressive.  The question to ask is: why would I listen to this band over Alestorm or Swashbuckled?  There are decent instrumental ideas here, but the vocals aren't very good at it seems that his odd vibrato is his ""signature"" technique so if you don't like it, it's going to ruin all the other songs too."
folkmetal,203hgx,LordJanas,1 point,Wed Mar 12 15:27:26 2014 UTC,"I loved your comment but I do enjoy the interesting vocal technique and would prefer these guys over Alestorm and Swashbuckled. One thing I have learned about music is not to make it a competition. Each and every band has there own uniqueness to them, and whether or not you like what they bring to the table."

folkmetal,2022df,Celtinarius,2,Mon Mar 10 19:26:45 2014 UTC,"Hmm, I think it's just the more popular ones. Svarga has a male vocalist with female guest appearances. Rarog has a female vocalist but the main vocals are male. Oprich, Tverd, and Veda have both. Temnozor, Stozhar, Nevid' (more recently), Leshak, Krada, Izmoroz, Pagan Reign, Butterfly Temple are all male or mainly male vocals.  This is just what I can think of at the moment. xD"
folkmetal,2022df,Celtinarius,3,Mon Mar 10 19:37:25 2014 UTC,"You are really into russian folk metal...awesome, I haven't been able to find it at all. I'm learning russian at the moment, and I have been needing some of this stuff to listen to."

The Gettysburg trilogy showed the tragedy of the whole affair decently. That's about as close as I can get, but if anyone else knows of similar albums or bands (especially those that use instruments like banjos, mandolins, etc.) I'd like to know!"
folkmetal,1z0xvy,pieman3141,-2,Thu Feb 27 03:24:14 2014 UTC,"Why is ""The South will rise again!"" a bad thing, though? Shouldn't everyone have the right to autonomy/sovereignty? I'm not trying to make this political, but come on, man.  Thanks for the band suggestions, though."
folkmetal,1z0xvy,pieman3141,2,Thu Feb 27 07:31:43 2014 UTC,"In and of itself, it isn't a bad thing. Independence is always something that people of a certain region will feel sympathetic towards. North America has lots of examples - Cascadia, Quebec, the South, the (Canadian) West, etc., but for the South in particular, there's a correlation between people who truly believe it and people who believe in racial purity. Quebecois independence has its own issues with cultural purity, and people who want the Canadian West to be independent are generally libertarians of the worst sort (not all, though!)."
folkmetal,1z0xvy,OdinsBeard,2,Thu Feb 27 07:45:55 2014 UTC,"Well, I'll tell you this much. If we were to ever have to fight, and I pray it don't come to war, for our sovereignty, then I'd hope and wish for every race, religion and creed to fight along side me."
folkmetal,1z0xvy,OdinsBeard,3,Thu Feb 27 07:57:59 2014 UTC,"Its unfortunate that you're ignorant of the very history you're wanting to honor. The Confederacy was about State's Rights.  To own slaves.    Cornerstone Address 1861, Confederate V. President Stephens:  Our new Government is founded upon exactly the opposite ideas; its foundations are laid, its cornerstone rests, upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery, subordination to the superior race, is his natural and moral condition.  This, our new Government, is the first, in the history of the world, based upon this great physical, philosophical, and moral truth. This truth has been slow in the process of its development, like all other truths in the various departments of science. It is so even amongst us. Many who hear me, perhaps, can recollect well that this truth was not generally admitted, even within their day. The errors of the past generation still clung to many as late as twenty years ago. Those at the North who still cling to these errors with a zeal above knowledge, we justly denominate fanatics. All fanaticism springs from an aberration of the mind; from a defect in reasoning. It is a species of insanity. One of the most striking characteristics of insanity, in many instances, is, forming correct conclusions from fancied or erroneous premises; so with the anti-slavery fanatics: their conclusions are right if their premises are. They assume that the negro is equal, and hence conclude that he is entitled to equal privileges and rights, with the white man... I recollect once of having heard a gentleman from one of the Northern States, of great power and ability, announce in the House of Representatives, with imposing effect, that we of the South would be compelled, ultimately, to yield upon this subject of slavery; that it was as impossible to war successfully against a principle in politics, as it was in physics or mechanics. That the principle would ultimately prevail. That we, in maintaining slavery as it exists with us, were warring against a principle-a principle founded in nature, the principle of the equality of man.   The reply I made to him was, that upon his own grounds we should succeed, and that he and his associates in their crusade against our institutions would ultimately fail. The truth announced, that it was as impossible to war successfully against a principle in politics as well as in physics and mechanics, I admitted, but told him it was he and those acting with him who were warring against a principle. They were attempting to make things equal which the Creator had made unequal.  In the conflict thus far, success has been on our side, complete throughout the length and breadth of the Confederate States. It is upon this, as I have stated, our social fabric is firmly planted; and I cannot permit myself to doubt the ultimate success of a full recognition of this principle throughout the civilized and enlightened world.  If you're not clear on what the principle he talks about yet, its that Blacks are chattel and undeserving of equal status to Whites.   I'm tired of pretending the Confederate flag isn't the hillbilly swastika it obviously is."

Slavery was the first and foremost reason stated in at least a few states' declarations, and I believe it was a major topic in all of them. And really, that's what it was all about.  Southern pride, etc.? Go for it. But the Confederacy isn't really something to be glorified like it so often is. I get that it represents a lot of ideals that are close to you, but when it comes down to it, its foundation was an attempt to continue to be able to own other people."

Dalriada sounds like Eluveities but is (IMO) better, and older.  Skalmold is like Amon Amarth infused with Icelandic folk, Iriminsul is a really underground folk death band from Sweden I found in the Metal Archives on random band search, Metsatoll is an Estonian group that sounds pretty unique and has a great show, and Heljareyga is the prog-folk-power side project of Tyr's Heri Joensen.  Sorry I'd give some links but I'm in a hurry now."

They've also got some great instrumental ones: Alvermans Wraak, Dageraad  As for the best album, I'd have to go with Walhalla Wacht, almost exclusively great songs. Batava, their latest album is sounding too much like regular standard metal for my tastes."

folkmetal,1yc94n,thatsmetals,1 point,Thu Feb 20 11:07:01 2014 UTC,"Definitely the more popular bands of those (so maybe better to start with?) are Eluveitie, Arkona, Agalloch, Tyr and maybe Falkenbach.  Then I'd say maybe Equilibrium (although the more I listen to these people the more I personally absolutely dislike them.  I mean come on, the song Unbesiegt off of Sagas is an absolute joke) and Heidevolk, etc, well you get the gist!  Here are my personal thoughts:  Eluveitie:  Their demo Ven is really good (not the re-recorded more recent version!) and definitely this one is the most ""metal"" check the song lament!  Their most famous album is Slania.  Most ""folkey"" album is Evocation 1 -the Arcane Dominion.  Personally I love the Slania - folk medley song because it is a simple rendition of most riffs from the Slania album and no ""Inis Mona"" ^  Arkona: Everyone listens to Goi, Rode, Goi! which is still arguably their best release.  I love the song Rus off of I think their first album ever (it's a bit slower).    Svartsot:  I have the Mulmets Viser album from them and the ""Pa Odden..."" song of that is definitely that catchiest song of the album and the whole album was the starting place for me for this band.  Hope this helped a bit! The best way to know any band? Just listen to the full album, not that hard to do as you're doing something else and just think of what you like and don't like about it.  If you're not sure where to start with a band, listen to some sample tracks from each album to decide which looks the most promising first.  The decision must ultimately be up to you of what to listen to and what to like of what you listen!    Checking out that songs a band often plays live can help a lot to know which songs are considered more relevant if that's what you're looking for.    Also I think a lot of folk metal is not as ""album oriented"" as we may like where there really are just a few decent songs on each album rather than the whole bands discography being relevant (well that's at least how I feel about Equilibrium haha)"

(everyone must know this track, haha) Here ya go: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR4LVp9wjN4  And maybe you will also like ""Faun"" because of their folk and vocal styles.

Listening to music outside of my pre-established comfort zone is a nice change of pace.  That being said, as a musician, finding new influences from other cultures is a pretty awesome way to develop my toolkit of playing techniques/styles."
folkmetal,1yafml,SpicyCornflake,1 point,Wed Feb 19 00:42:30 2014 UTC,"what do you take from it? the instruments, rhythm, pace, style, whatever is it you kids call it nowadays?"
folkmetal,1yafml,SpicyCornflake,1 point,Wed Feb 19 00:47:42 2014 UTC,"Unfortunately I'm not made of money, so not the instruments.  A lot of the method (riff structure, note choice, music theory etc.) gets absorbed into how I play. I'm from the U.S. so I don't get a whole lot of exposure to tradition folk music of many other cultures, so the influence from that into folk metal also permeates through.  I don't personally write folk-metal music, but I've noticed that several times when writing something on acoustic guitar that I've accidentally stolen riffs from folk-metal songs. As far as rhythm goes, much of folk-metal rhythm is rhythm found in many other genres of music, lots of 4/4 in folk metal and lots of shuffling and galloping rhythm which are prevalent in most genres of metal."
folkmetal,1yafml,ImATomatoClone,1 point,Wed Feb 19 05:31:55 2014 UTC,For me its the languages as well as the folk instruments. I grew up loving traditional folk music and going to high school and college with people who had immigrated to the US from other countries made me really appreciate the sound of foreign languages.
folkmetal,1yafml,LordJanas,1 point,Wed Feb 19 00:51:37 2014 UTC,"I love the atmosphere and complex compositions that are all unified by deceptively simple folk melodies.  I enjoy the diverse intrumentation and the ""anything goes"" nature of the music.    Folk metal is able to contain banjos, accordians, violins, horns, pianos, ethnic percussion, gamelan, saxaphones and even orchestras.  As a composer, this really appeals to me as I love hearing different ways traditional/classical instruments can be used together in new ways.    And on top of that, metal in general has an intense, grand atmosphere akin to classical symphonies and I find that atmosphere is particularly prevalent in Folk metal.  One of my favourite folk metal bands, Moonsorrow, produce masterful soundscapes like no other.  Of course I don't exclusively listen to folk metal, but it is the niche genre I enjoy the most."
folkmetal,1yafml,thatsmetals,1 point,Sat Feb 22 13:25:06 2014 UTC,I agree with most of what everyone else here says.  Another good thing about music in foreign languages is that you don't notice if the lyrics are shitty if you can't understand it at first.  I'm therefore less concerned with how terrible the lyrics are and more concerned with how awesome everything sounds!

folkmetal,1xw2in,princess_reyja,4,Fri Feb 14 11:50:37 2014 UTC,"Arkona are currently on tour in Russia and this song was recorded in Arkhangelst. Not the best quality, but it's a good sample of what awaits us with their new album Yav. Yav in slavic mythology means the ""material"" word, where we live now, in contrast to the ""immaterial"" world Nav and the ""law"" Prav.  Masha said in an interview that it will be much different to their other work. She described the sound of the new album as progressive, post black metal-ish with folk elements. There won't be any ""fun"" songs like Yarilo or Stenka Na Stenku because they wouldn't fit into the concept of Yav. They will probably release these songs seperately.  The whole recording process was very challenging. Three songs were already recorded by their new drummer Andrey Ischenko, who replaced Vlad ""Artist"" after he left the band for personal reasons. Some guest musicians will appear on the new album, including Thomas Väänänen (ex-Thyrfing) doing guest vocals, Olli Vänskä (Turisas) on violin, Aleksey ""Master Alafern"" (Sviatogor,...) on violin and Vika ""Vkgoeswild"" Yermolyeva on piano. There will again be a small monologue spoken by Masha & Sergey's son Radimir. The whole album will be about 70 minutes long and includes 9 songs.  (Sources: Arkona forum and Facebook)"

While I've seen them criticized as ""Moonsorrow clones"" I love Moonsorrow so having one more band with a similar sound is even better!    I do  however think they lack the cohesiveness and melodic unity of Moonsorrow's compositions.  I think it's a skill that develops over time. :)"
folkmetal,1wx0zr,zangderak,3,Mon Feb 3 19:40:07 2014 UTC,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSdINEsB9QE is my personal favorite by them

Tequila was from how much they enjoyed their first South American tour. They don't have to go on singing about rum, or gin, or anything else alcohol.  I love those songs just as much as I love the others that are more of nature and Finnish lore and history. I'll gladly listen to Suden Joiku and With Trees, but there's many a day where you get home from work, or off the phone after a bad conversation, anything annoying or something like that, and you just want to sit down, or jump all over the place, and blast Vodka, Bring Us Pints of Beer, and Happy Little Boozer and tell everything to fuck off and enjoy yourself."

Corvus Corax - Dulcissima  Korpiklaani - Pellonpekko  Korpiklaani - Shall we take a turn  Avven - Ros  For a less hard stuff because I don't know if your mother(-in-law) likes metal but here is a nice guitar song. It's not folk metal as much as goth metal genre but still an idea to help.:  Tiamat-Amanitis"

folkmetal,1wkh92,JaxRiens,1 point,Fri Jan 31 04:31:07 2014 UTC,"Most of the songs work with the imagery on the cover. 'Into the Sky,' 'Fánar Burtur Brandaljóð,' and 'Lady of the Slain' would have been the more appropriate picks in that regard. The last of these would have been the best choice for a music video, imo."
