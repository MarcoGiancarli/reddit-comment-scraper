Boxers,3e5wn3,Ebeneezer_Splooge,2,Wed Jul 22 05:04:26 2015 UTC,"Oftentimes there is a reluctance for rescue groups to highlight certain breeds due to bias against that breed or breed specific legislation. One of the most common ones is ""Boxer Mix"" which, in my experience, usually means pit bull mix.   This is sad for a number of reasons. First, it plays into the notion that pit bulls are bad breeds that must be snuck in, perpetuating the stigma. Secondly, people are learning that this is happening so boxers are being pushed into the grey areas of breed specific legislation.   He's an adorable little guy! It'll be more apparent what he's crossed with as he grows up, but I would guess pit bull.   Does he have a tail? Straight, non-fluffy, whiplike tail would make me think pit bull even more."

Boxers,3dyr0h,audioear,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:58:58 2015 UTC,"Cute! Name?  White Boxers get sunburned, so avoid too much sun or use sunscreen (don't know what brands are OK for dogs). Also watch for heat exhaustion. Short snout dogs don't cool as efficiently as long snouters. If the eyes are red and s/he is panting/drooling, too hot! We drape ours in cool wet towels if they get too hot. May buy them a wading pool.  Happy walking!"
Boxers,3dyr0h,ratstack,3,Mon Jul 20 21:18:40 2015 UTC,Thanks! His name is Toby and he has been my buddy for just about two months now.  He's my third white boxer. I never start out looking for a white one but somehow they seem to find me. We keep our walks to early morning or dusk to cut down on the possibility of a burn or getting too hot. As for sunscreen our vet said any baby sunscreen without zinc works just fine for our fair skinned friends.

She was much older, and we have 2 of her puppies, but it was heart wrenching all the same.   There really is no adequate say to express that feeling, and no words to make it better. I do love this poem though.   ~I know that you must miss me, By the tears rolling down your face. But believe me when I tell you that, I'm in a very good place.  ~There are meadows here to run in, And plenty of rabbits to chase. There are other dogs to play with, To frolick with and race.  ~So please don't worry about me, My spirit feels light as can be. There's no more pain to plague me, I'm young again and free.  ~And I'll be watching over you still, of that you can be sure. I'm your canine guardian angel, And my love for you remains pure."

Boxers,3d4rsu,AloneGn0m3,2,Mon Jul 13 14:54:40 2015 UTC,I have an 18 month old white boxer that I love to bits!   sunscreen - I've put sunscreen on mine when we've spent time at the beach or lake.  I use the spray on kind for babies.  I generally just give him a good spray down and then rub some additional on his face and ears.  He's never looked sunburned to me. The probability of deafness is about 20% for a white boxer.  You can check for deafness by bringing a clicker or some other noise-making device and seeing if the puppy reacts to it when he can't see it.  Most deaf dogs adjust well but might have some aggression issues when startled - try not to approach them from behind.  My dude can hear just fine although he might ignore me sometimes!
Boxers,3d4rsu,HereBeBeer,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:10:08 2015 UTC,Great tips! Thanks for the advice.
Boxers,3d4rsu,phattoes,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:11:08 2015 UTC,"Exactly as /u/HereBeBeer has said. But having a deaf dog isn't terrible, unless you want a guard dog. If you have it from a puppy they learn sign language quickly and since you already have Karis the deaf puppy will have a friend, and dogs tend to know when another has a disability and will look out for them."
Boxers,3d1u03,DarlingBri,4,Sun Jul 12 20:59:54 2015 UTC,"She's beautiful!   I'm sure she's perfect, but just to throw it out there, sometimes sloppy sitting can be linked to knee discomfort. If it's something new or different than how she used to sit, it might be worth it to ask your vet! Boxers are notorious for partial ACL tears and those can lead to arthritis or complete knee tears. But they can be managed well without surgery if treated early.   TheMoreYouKnow***"

First time my friend jumped off the diving board at his new house his boxer jumped in to ""save"" him. Then she realized she hates the water and proceeded to climb on top of him and scratch him up."
Boxers,3b5iss,lordrashmi,2,Fri Jun 26 13:23:47 2015 UTC,They turn around and climb about halfway down the ladder and jump. That's funny. Last summer the fawn boxer climbed right up and jumped right in the water. She went under the water and it scared her. She hasn't jumped in again.  Yesterday the brindle one did the same thing. Not sure if she will do it again. But they both enjoy getting in for a quick cool down.

Depending on where you are and the duration of being outside I would say don't wear yourself out. After a couple months of putting on sunblock I realized it wasn't too necessary. It's more important to keep them cool in hot weather and have plenty of water ready.
Boxers,38yqku,DoitfortheHoff,3,Mon Jun 8 01:09:47 2015 UTC,"Agreed completely. We used some wipes for a long time that seemed to work ok, but honestly - our Coda knows when she's been in the sun too long and tends to find shade prior to it being a problem. Shade and water should be just fine, but if you are still worried - there are sunscreen wipes designed for white dogs."

Boxers,35ct9u,Lil_Yanks559,9,Sat May 9 01:54:54 2015 UTC,"She's adorable! What's her name?  Boxers potty train easily, but you can't be a lazy owner. Take her outside at regular intervals. Most dogs like to go in the morning, after crate time, and after eating. Puppies, of course, go more often. Take her out at least 1 time each hour. Try to stay outside til she goes.  Praise and treat her when she goes outside. Use a command so she learns to go on cue. Consistency and positive reinforcement are key.  If you catch her having an accident indoors, immediately take her outside. It's fine to show displeasure and say ""No,"" but any harsher punishment is counterproductive. Boxers like to please their owners. She will be upset if you are angry, and just plain confused if she is punished.  If you find the accident but don't actually catch her in the act, clean the area well, outside of her view. You don't want her to think it's OK to go in the house. Most training books say a reprimand is useless at this point, but we found that just looking at the accident and saying something in a stern voice taught our Boxers that we were displeased with this behavior.  Watch for ""sneaking off"" to go in the house. Especially in the evening. This is just lazy dog behavior. You really have to keep your eyes on her and take her out frequently.   All our Boxers trained on different schedules, so be patient. Definitely start her on ""sit"" and other basic commands, so she knows she's expected to respond to you. Boxers like to learn. She'll be happy when she gets her commands right.  Have fun!!"
Boxers,35ct9u,ratstack,1 point,Sat May 9 02:39:54 2015 UTC,"thank you ! we just got a 2 months old boxer and this was very helpful.  Do you have any suggestions on how to teach him to walk on a leash ?  He has a lot of character and likes to test his grounds, not listen and act stubborn, but he does frequently but not always respond to 'no' and 'sit' . I'm assuming it's normal."
Boxers,35ct9u,zenona,2,Sat May 9 14:12:54 2015 UTC,"Practice practice practice!  Make it a game though and bring lots of treats.  Anytime you come to a intersection, sit and treats.  Any time you come on another person or dog do the same.    Taking puppy and dog training classed can help show you and your pup how to work together better.  I highly recommend getting into one or several if you can."

Boxers,34ztah,goritori,3,Tue May 5 22:41:39 2015 UTC,"Boxers are very active dogs, so getting one ESPECIALLY if it's under 10 will be a big commitment as far as that goes. I've had two boxers in my life, and both have been amazing family dogs. They played gently with my sister and I as children but they wrestle with adults just fine.   The rescue I got my last one from won't put two females together due to aggression issues, but I've only had males.   They groom easily as most have short hair. They shed but not too badly as long as you wash them.   Boxers are known to be a bit more sickly. A lot have dietary issues so you have to spend some time finding a good diet for your dog. They also get tumors somewhat often.   If you want a dog to look fearsome then a boxer's a good choice, but anyone who's had one will know they're everyone's best friend. My current boxer's actually a big baby and will hide when the doorbell rings.   I think they're amazing dogs, and although I have over 20 years experience with them I think you should get some more opinions as well."
Boxers,34ztah,ThereAreNoMoreNames,5,Tue May 5 23:45:04 2015 UTC,"To be honest, it sounds like you already have a lot on your plate without an hyperactive dog to add to the mix. My boxer is super gentle and we routinely pull and prod him to make sure that if kids annoy him, we know how he'll react. But not every dog would respond to that well. They're highly energetic dogs and can sometimes not watch where their going and run into people. This makes me worry because of your back issues already. If a 60lb dog slams into you and you fall, it would be really bad.  Boxers aren't really protection dogs. They like everyone. I have had people shimmy away when they don't know how boxers are like because they are very muscular.  My dog doesn't really like playing in the yard by himself. He only likes to play tug or wrestle so having a big yard isn't always needed. Boxers don't necessarily play fetch so getting them tired in the yard can be hard. Biking might work, but I've found that my boxer doesn't really like long distances because of his short snout. He's more of a sprint and rest dog.  With so many pets already, it seems like a lot to add another dog to your household. I only have one, but he's already a handful. My dog has a prey drive and doesn't like cats. I know it's very discouraging, but I don't think it would be in your best interest to get one. Although, you can try fostering a boxer and see how that turns out."
Boxers,34ztah,finkydink,3,Wed May 6 00:13:37 2015 UTC,my advice:  seek out a rescue group for a young 2-3 year old with a mild temperament.  if the dog has been with the group long enough they know its behavior and any issues.  we rescued ours at 3 years old and she isnt the always hyperactive boxer you always see and hear about.  she is actually pretty mellow.  i also recommend getting a female over a male although there are pros and cons to both.  http://www.petmd.com/dog/puppycenter/adoption/evr_dg_male_or_female_puppy_which_is_better

I had to curb it though as I think this constant dependence on me has contributed significantly to his separation anxiety. He now sleeps in another room and has become a fair bit more independent, he will go and sleep in the other room now in his crate whereas before he would have to be beside me at all times. Don't get my wrong, I love his cuddles and being around him, but he was super needy and it was doing him no good as he couldn't cope when I wasn't around, even if someone else was with him. We have nowhere near fixed the issue and I honestly doubt we ever will completely but he is doing much better.

He had/has a very serious case of separation anxiety and would hurt himself and do serious damage to the house trying to 'escape'. Trust me, if you were coming home to you dogs blood smeared on the walls, floors, doors because he hurt himself trying to get out and find you, you wanting him to be needy would be the least of your worries or priorities.

In fact, she always slept in my bed, but my mom recently bought her a really nice expensive fluffy dog bed, and now she uses that.  Often she will start in my bed, and as soon as I start moving around or roll over, she just hops down to her bed and stays there all night.

One of mine today absolutely is petrified of water though and won't go in even water only a few inches deep.  They aren't great swimmers though, so if you plan on being in the water any length of time, a life jacket makes some sense."
Boxers,33vfui,ktofthewest,1 point,Sun Apr 26 18:12:35 2015 UTC,This makes sense. We had a lab before so that's what I told my SO. That they aren't the same. Is it possible to buy one in July that will fit him when he's full grown. He was born Nov 19.
Boxers,33vfui,finkydink,1 point,Sun Apr 26 18:22:52 2015 UTC,"He's probably got a lot of growing left to do, and Boxers tend to be very barrel-chested. If you get one that's fairly adjustable you can probably make it work, but it's hard to say without knowing more about his breeding. There can be a lot of variability in how big Boxers get. Both of mine are in the 50-60 lb. range, but I've had boxers that clocked in at 80 lbs."

Boxers,33mi4z,spankinhank,2,Thu Apr 23 18:53:19 2015 UTC,"We went through the same issues for a few years with our girl.  We worked on ""stop it"" command, and that would stop her, but she would always return to licking an hour or so later.  Vet narrowed it down to food allergies or boredom.  After several months of switching foods with no success, we attacked the boredom issue.  We started taking her for more walks (like once a day) and having more intentional playtime with her, which helped, but what really helped was when we got a 2nd dog.  She all but stopped once that she had a playmate.  So, at least for us, boredom seemed to be the culprit."
Boxers,33mi4z,delonybro,0,Thu Apr 23 18:59:37 2015 UTC,More walks was only once a day? Christ how often did you walk her before you upped it to once a day?

Boxers,33mi4z,delonybro,1 point,Sat Apr 25 02:31:42 2015 UTC,Mine did this. She had a yeast infection on her feet. We used lotramin on them (it is really just an anti fungal) she stopped liking within 24 hours. It went from weeks of constant licking  to nothing!
Boxers,33mi4z,Amrz6014,1 point,Fri Apr 24 01:12:18 2015 UTC,I had a pup who was allergic to grass and about a dozen other things. Had to give him antihistamines and steroids on the regular or he was constantly licking. Get him allergy tested so that you know exactly what to avoid.  My next guess would be a fungal infection. Dogs can get their own version of athlete's foot just like people do.

Boxers,33hamq,d3v1c3,1 point,Thu Apr 23 12:37:18 2015 UTC,"Have an appointment with the vet on Friday.  I have spoken to a friend of the family who has a small dog with a similar issue.  Their vet suggested a wait and see approach because the dog was older and they were unsure if surgery was the best option.  The treatment they took was supplements and careful play.   This is a bit of a contrast to my pup, who is a ball of energy.    Bigger concern was my brother who had a chocolate lab who had several benign cysts later in life.  He was happy with this vet for 10 years and the vet removed 2 and suggested a 3rd be removed when the dog was 10.  My brother spoke to his breeder in passing and she suggested another vet who took a wait and see approach.  In the end his dog lived another 4 happy years without surgery.    I am new to the area where I live and both my friend and brother live in another state.  So the vet I have, while highly rated, is new to me and I have no source of personal referrals to go off unfortunately.  Was hoping to find a 'boxer specific' insight."
Boxers,33hamq,d3v1c3,1 point,Thu Apr 23 13:15:38 2015 UTC,Yeah I understand.  While I'm not a vet and cannot provide any insight I know my patella floats a bit if my leg is in the right position.

I don't mind it and at times encourage it with rough play but she is very good with the ""No Bites"" and ""Kisses"" commands that we started the moment we got her...so it's not that big of a deal.

Boxers,2xukvs,BTFCme,2,Wed Mar 4 01:48:16 2015 UTC,"degenerative myelopathy, basically he slowly lost feeling in his hind legs until he couldn't walk comfortably without assistance. Fortunately, it's not painful for them, just numbness. We were lucky enough to get a full year with him after diagnosis. We let him go before he started to lose bladder / bowel control - which was going to be the next phase. His demeanor never changed :)"
Boxers,2xukvs,BTFCme,2,Wed Mar 4 11:27:40 2015 UTC,Then this is what my boy had too. He was never diagnosed but the vet put him on steroids and doggie ibuprofen and glucosamine. This happened to our first boxer too. : ( He did slowly start to lose control of his bowels so we knew it was time. He was depressed.

One named Biggie Smalls, the other Missy Eliot. To keep with the theme her name is Lil' Kim, though her personality doesn't match I think it's a good name, not many female rappers in general. We just call her Kim in every day speech, and giving her commands/calling her. She seems to respond to it already! Her name before was Athena, but according to the shelter it wasn't even close to being her first name. She has opened up a bit and is gaining weight. She even played with me in the park today! :') Makes me so happy. Those farts though. She farts louder than some humans!"

I honestly don't think she'd attack unless threatened. unfortunately when you rescue a dog (especially older like us) you don't know exactly what they have been through. hopefully your dog will come around. personally we just use the pedigree brand and that's fine for our chloe (I know it's definitely not a high end dog food) so probably no help for you."

Boxers,2x4l9j,FunCatFacts,1 point,Wed Feb 25 21:56:41 2015 UTC,"Try walking the two dogs together.  After a bit, switch dogs with the other person, and let your dog see this happen.  Walk for a while longer, and then switch back.  Reward with good behavior with small treats and praise.  For food allergies, you need to know specifically what they are allergic to, but my oldest was allergic to chicken, which is in a lot of dog food so we went with Science Diet Lamb flavor for most of her life.  Around the age of 71/2 - 8 years her stomach turned on that so we went with Taste of the Wild: Lamb.  http://www.tasteofthewildpetfood.com/products/dogs/dry_food/sierra_mountain_canine_formula/  http://www.hillspet.com/products/sd-canine-adult-lamb-meal-and-rice-recipe-large-breed-dry.html  Hope this helps!"

We also give her some coconut oil once a day with her food, which really helps with her environmental allergies.   As far a socializing, that's hard to say. Unfortunately you'll never know when or how she picked up the behavior (if she had it before she was at the shelter or not). She could just be adjusting to her new life with you and not really sure how to act around other dogs while she is in your presence, or she could have had this issue her whole life. At this point I would say just let her do her thing and let her know she is a good girl and that she don't need to be scared. Be confident with her."
Boxers,2x4l9j,Yeonath,1 point,Fri Feb 27 16:57:20 2015 UTC,"A friend of mine went through food allergies with her dog as well. It was a lot of trial and error. But she found one that worked well, but was really expensive. She found recipes for making allergy-free dog food and was able to save quite a bit by doing that, but it does take some work and time. If you have the time (I think she makes a week's worth at a time every Sunday), that could be a cost effective option."

Boxers,2uyl2i,mlevine7159,3,Fri Feb 6 18:54:06 2015 UTC,"May I suggest a pinch collar then? Have any friends with small dogs that are obedient? If so, use the pinch collar, have them sit their dog in a spot, and walk around the small dog. When your pup acts out of what you want, you slightly tug the leash to pinch the collar. This is what the mothers do to them as puppies to keep them in line, it doesn't actually hurt them.  This is just a suggestion, the behavior specialist I saw did exactly this and it's worked out great."
Boxers,2uyl2i,mlevine7159,2,Fri Feb 6 18:59:35 2015 UTC,"I have a few suggestions: -super smelly treats (go for alligator or cheese) -a water bottle, one that has projectile and accuracy (i use my athlete gatorade bottle) -a harness (go to pet expos do some research find one that is comfortable for your dog that will help with walking) -is she leash aggressive?!?!  when she roams free does the behavior occur?  or is it only when she is restricted to a lead.    my coworker has a dog with leash aggression, otherwise a total love bug and super friendly in home with both my dogs. she has a harness and a muzzle for her own safety.  My gf and I drowned our dogs in socialization as early as we could.  Regular visits to pet stores, expos, and even the city.  The city can be overwhelming, but if you the handler are walking with confidence and are not expecting Vesper to misbehave then he wont.  Visualize and trust yourself as your dogs leader.  If you were walking around on all 4's and didnt trust that your handler was in control you would act out and feel the need to fill that role.    I know thats kinda quack advice, but it works, if i slouch and walk my boxer he will own me on the walk. but if i am leading and it is MY walk, he follows.  hope this helps!  I posted a huge blurb awhile back about taking on boxers if you wanna check it out"

Just this side of heaven is a place called Rainbow Bridge.  When an animal dies that has been especially close to someone here, that pet goes to Rainbow Bridge. There are meadows and hills for all of our special friends so they can run and play together. There is plenty of food, water and sunshine, and our friends are warm and comfortable. All the animals who had been ill and old are restored to health and vigor. Those who were hurt or maimed are made whole and strong again, just as we remember them in our dreams of days and times gone by. The animals are happy and content, except for one small thing; they each miss someone very special to them, who had to be left behind.  They all run and play together, but the day comes when one suddenly stops and looks into the distance. His bright eyes are intent. His eager body quivers. Suddenly he begins to run from the group, flying over the green grass, his legs carrying him faster and faster.  You have been spotted, and when you and your special friend finally meet, you cling together in joyous reunion, never to be parted again. The happy kisses rain upon your face; your hands again caress the beloved head, and you look once more into the trusting eyes of your pet, so long gone from your life but never absent from your heart.  Then you cross Rainbow Bridge together..."

Boxers,2u5k62,n2speed125,3,Fri Jan 30 03:05:48 2015 UTC,"This one I really like as well but don't know who wrote it..   Some of you, particularly those who think they have recently lost a dog to “death”, don’t really understand this. I’ve had no desire to explain, but won’t be around forever and must. Dogs never die. They don’t know how to. They get tired, and very old, and their bones hurt. Of course they don’t die. If they did they would not want to always go for a walk, even long after their old bones say:” No, no, not a good idea. Let’s not go for a walk.” Nope, dogs always want to go for a walk. They might get one step before their aging tendons collapse them into a heap on the floor, but that’s what dogs are. They walk. It’s not that they dislike your company. On the contrary, a walk with you is all there is. Their boss, and the cacaphonic symphony of odor that the world is. Cat poop, another dog’s mark, a rotting chicken bone ( exultation), and you. That’s what makes their world perfect, and in a perfect world death has no place. However, dogs get very very sleepy. That’s the thing, you see. They don’t teach you that at the fancy university where they explain about quarks, gluons, and Keynesian economics. They know so much they forget that dogs never die. It’s a shame, really. Dogs have so much to offer and people just talk a lot. When you think your dog has died, it has just fallen asleep in your heart. And by the way, it is wagging it’s tail madly, you see, and that’s why your chest hurts so much and you cry all the time. Who would not cry with a happy dog wagging its tail in their chest. Ouch! Wap wap wap wap wap, that hurts. But they only wag when they wake up. That’s when they say: “Thanks Boss! Thanks for a warm place to sleep and always next to your heart, the best place.” When they first fall asleep, they wake up all the time, and that’s why, of course, you cry all the time. Wap, wap, wap. After a while they sleep more. (remember, a dog while is not a human while. You take your dog for walk, it’s a day full of adventure in an hour. Then you come home and it’s a week, well one of your days, but a week, really, before the dog gets another walk. No WONDER they love walks.) Anyway, like I was saying, they fall asleep in your heart, and when they wake up, they wag their tail. After a few dog years, they sleep for longer naps, and you would too. They were a GOOD DOG all their life, and you both know it. It gets tiring being a good dog all the time, particularly when you get old and your bones hurt and you fall on your face and don’t want to go outside to pee when it is raining but do anyway, because you are a good dog. So understand, after they have been sleeping in your heart, they will sleep longer and longer. But don’t get fooled. They are not “dead.” There’s no such thing, really. They are sleeping in your heart, and they will wake up, usually when you’re not expecting it. It’s just who they are. I feel sorry for people who don’t have dogs sleeping in their heart. You’ve missed so much. Excuse me, I have to go cry now."

He was put on some strong meds (steroid i think) to help him walk. The meds made him ravenous and always thirsty though. His stomach descended some and he started really slowing down. We waited until he let us know he was ready and he last another month or so than we thought. But he stopped wagging his tail and became a bit depressed. I'm not sure if the wagging stopped because of the neurological issues with the hips or not, but he looked very tired. His whole bone structure shifted when he stood. Everything seemed a bit out of place. There will never be another like him and my heart hurts. Love to yours."

Boxers,2twuja,ddh0,1 point,Wed Jan 28 13:59:38 2015 UTC,"First, apparently the noise of running the bath is a big part of what scares my dog off. So she runs a few inches of water in the tub, enough to be able to scoop the water up to wash him, and then turns the water off and brings him in the bathroom.  The first few times as she was doing this, she would basically just feed him treats as she splashed him with water. It only took a few times, but she did it over the course of a week or two. I think that's the step I've missed when I tried to bathe him in the past--he gets bathed so rarely that he couldn't remember that it wasn't scary."

My step dad is a double amputee and she'd pull him down the street at a full sprint like a chariot. It was hilarious. She got stiffer, slower, and more tired in her last 2 years or so and died 1 week after her 10th birthday. She just went down to the basement and went peacefully. There was no warning or preceding health problems. Luckily I had visited the day before so I got to see her."

Check daily to see what the pollen count is, and make notes of high pollens for the day and if Molly is really going at her ears, paws, etc.    When she comes inside from walks or going potty wash her paws to get any agitators off.

Boxers,2sff9v,PsychGirl,3,Thu Jan 15 02:32:58 2015 UTC,Have you tried putting socks or booties on her paws? If you can get her to keep them on when she goes outside you may be able to determine if her paws are being irritated by outdoor allergies.
Boxers,2sff9v,grahameaton,2,Thu Jan 15 00:16:08 2015 UTC,"Also, if you live in a snowy area, the salt or ice-melt stuff can irritate the paws and get transferred to the ears with scratching."
Boxers,2sff9v,not_blue,3,Thu Jan 15 00:59:51 2015 UTC,"Parent of boxer girl with yeast issues here.  When she came home with us, she had yeast in her ears, nailbeds, and in the folds of her chin... and that's just what we know of.  She was also having some ""groin"" itching for a while, though the vet couldn't prove whether that was yeast or bacteria. She scratched her ears until the tops were raw, licked her paws such that they were stained seemingly permanently, and smelled like a corn chip all the time. After a few months, she was completely ""cured"" except for occasional chin itch.  Here's what we did, with help from the vet:   Switched to food and treats containing no grains, starchy veggies, or sugars whatsoever. This means eliminating even the ""healthy"" grains like rice, barley, etc. She's on Zignature Zssential right now but we're going to give either Arcana Regionals Pacifica or Orijen Six Fish a try soon (for unrelated issues -- she has terrible gas!) Flushed/cleaned ears with TrizULTRA + Keto (antibacterial/antifungal) daily for 1 week and occasionally thereafter. Treated ears with Mometamax (antibacterial/anti-inflammatory/antifungal) daily for 1 week. Dipped paws into a diluted solution of Chlorhexidine daily for a few weeks, occasionally thereafter. Thoroughly dried between the toes after dipping. Added probiotics to her food -- first the powdered stuff, then kefir or yogurt (~2 TBSP/day).  Also added 2 drops/day of oil of oregano and 1/2 TBSP/day Bragg's apple cider vinegar supplements to food. Lowered her stress level -- removed sources of anxiety that would drive her to lick or scratch obsessively. Eventually, just in case of a urinary tract infection, she also completed a course of Clavamox (antibiotic) and Prostora (powerful probiotic).   This is probably TMI, but I listed it all just in case one magical element is in this regimen and not in yours.  Good luck and keep at it!  Your dog is lucky to have you as her advocate."

Just this side of heaven is a place called Rainbow Bridge.  When an animal dies that has been especially close to someone here, that pet goes to Rainbow Bridge. There are meadows and hills for all of our special friends so they can run and play together. There is plenty of food, water and sunshine, and our friends are warm and comfortable. All the animals who had been ill and old are restored to health and vigor. Those who were hurt or maimed are made whole and strong again, just as we remember them in our dreams of days and times gone by. The animals are happy and content, except for one small thing; they each miss someone very special to them, who had to be left behind.  They all run and play together, but the day comes when one suddenly stops and looks into the distance. His bright eyes are intent. His eager body quivers. Suddenly he begins to run from the group, flying over the green grass, his legs carrying him faster and faster.  You have been spotted, and when you and your special friend finally meet, you cling together in joyous reunion, never to be parted again. The happy kisses rain upon your face; your hands again caress the beloved head, and you look once more into the trusting eyes of your pet, so long gone from your life but never absent from your heart.  Then you cross Rainbow Bridge together..."

If there wasn't a proven risk and it was a one off, then it wouldn't be. But there are plenty of other inducing agents available and the vet chose ACP despite knowing how dangerous it is in boxers. There's reports of some vets using ACP in boxers despite the owners asking for it not to be used (which means they don't consent to what the vet is doing, and I would imagine they got in a lot of trouble for it)."

Boxers,2pdmj6,phattoes,1 point,Tue Dec 16 02:27:01 2014 UTC,I grew up with Boxers as pets. My boy Beau understood my brothers and I were young and was always protective of us. Dad used to joke around and pretend to rough us up and the dogs would bark like crazy and be close to biting him to protect us from him.
Boxers,2pdmj6,Shogun102000,1 point,Tue Dec 16 03:37:12 2014 UTC,Once you go boxer you don't go back.
Boxers,2pciz7,isaidwouldyoukindly,3,Mon Dec 15 10:04:57 2014 UTC,You definitely need to train him not to pull.  When he learns not to pull he will be easier to keep by your side off leash.  Distraction training is key.    For pulling I would reccomend a halti style lead.  It pulls the dogs head back into their side when trying to pull away.  Its annoying so the quit.  Puppy training and socialization will make them less likely to spas out when they go off leash.  Lots of people interaction too
Boxers,2pciz7,d3v1c3,1 point,Mon Dec 15 11:28:52 2014 UTC,"Thanks! Our dog trainer said the same thing, but he gets super excited so easily and he ends up using his leash as a pull toy. Can't win with this little tyke :') I'd never heard of Halti leashes and I'll definitely try it out. I know what I'm getting Humphrey for Christmas!"
Boxers,2pciz7,SlendersSuit,1 point,Mon Dec 15 12:56:53 2014 UTC,My ex had a boxer than ran away at a young age.  Dog catcher found him weeks later extremely malnourished.  Don't assume the dog won't take off or knows to avoid the road.  Boxers are intelligent but easily distracted by their own excitement and playfulness.

Boxers,2pciz7,bla2bla1bla,1 point,Tue Dec 16 02:42:52 2014 UTC,"few things, 1 Congrats on a new boxer I know you will love them they are some of the best dogs in the world.  First Things first, I never used Choker collars I think they are to harsh. Remember boxers are REALLY smart. keep Humphrey on a short leash, encourage him staying near you. and discipline him when he pulls from you. He will learn fast to stay with you.  I should let you know I remember my baby girl (actually named baby) she would get loose digging under the fence. Wait just out side the fence till we made eye contact. Give that evil smile and bolt! What a bitch right :D I love that girl. the point is they are some what mischievous but still they respond extremely well to good environments. Keep your treats handy, Humphrey will learn, Also Be strict and firm about it. Your the master not the dog, and that does not mean you wont be best friends :D best of luck to you, also Post pictures of Him we all would love to see :D"
Boxers,2pciz7,Sephtical,1 point,Tue Dec 16 07:48:00 2014 UTC,"Every dog is different in regard to their instinct to run away.  Practice letting them off the leash in a large but fully fenced in area and then get get them back on a leash.  It will be challenging at first but hopefully easier over time. Also, get the dog used to consistent and firm commands. I could stop my boxer in a full sprint running down the sidewalk by yelling out what he knew was the 'NO' command."
Boxers,2pciz7,Iam10-32,0,Fri Dec 19 23:57:49 2014 UTC,"The Halti Harness is great for dogs that pull, especially boxers. I use them to help train young K9s during basic obedience and they are a life saver.   Be careful doing any off lead work with your dog, especially at young age. You need to build the trust of him coming back to you. He needs to learn that being close to you is the happiest, safest place he can be. I recomend using a 30 to 50 foot nylon lead to practice with. This will allow him some extra freedom, but also give you control over where he can and can't go. Figure out a verbal command to associate him returning to you, and then reward him with his favorite toy or treat when he follows it. Boxers are fast learners so with enough repetition he should recall with no problem."
Boxers,2pbx0o,xchocolatexmustardx,2,Mon Dec 15 04:57:15 2014 UTC,"This whole thing has been nothing but a huge head ache. We put down a down payment for the first pick of the next litter in the summer of 2013. Hopefully we will FINALLY be getting a puppy in January after a long string of ""expecting her to come into heat right away (four months later) deciding they want to keep the puppy. Waiting for the next dog to come into heat soon (four months later) and two puppies survived (dogs first litter and she was only there for the last two being born) one boy and one girl. I told her three times now that we want a girl. She just told me she has me marked down for a boy.   I'm severely annoyed as we have already given her 800 dollars. They are a month old and the only reason I have been sent pictures is because I had to nag her for them.   Did you have this many problems? I'm not impressed with her.  http://imgur.com/LooyDp5 the little girl on the right will HOPEFULLY be ours.   We got ours from breeders, two separate  breeders and had no problems  at all..."
Boxers,2pbx0o,Amrz6014,1 point,Mon Dec 15 05:38:52 2014 UTC,It sounds like you should get your money back and contact another breeder.
Boxers,2pbx0o,thatEMSguy,1 point,Mon Dec 15 05:53:09 2014 UTC,"This sounds like a very unprofessional breeder. Both my boxers came from breeders and we had no problems such as this.   Our second boxer puppy's breeder was expecting 3 litters at the same time, but one of them was a phantom pregnancy. She had to give most of the remaining available puppies from the other two litters to the people who couldn't get a puppy from the phantom litter, and some others had to be postponed until the next round of litters. Luckily, we had reserved a puppy whose litter came with no problems and we got to take her home easily. But the families who couldn't get puppies were squared away as soon as possible and professionally.   Your situation seems very unfortunate and annoying. I would recommend going with another breeder if you can. :( It's hard to walk away from a picture like that though!"
Boxers,2pbx0o,Kayleitarian,1 point,Mon Dec 15 06:48:31 2014 UTC,"We would also be walking away from $800. The receipt of our payment says ""2014 litter"" so if we don't get this puppy we are going to demand our money back as we would not have one from the 2014 litter as follows."

Boxers,2pbx0o,walkerlucas,1 point,Thu Dec 18 02:57:45 2014 UTC,I'm currently messaging someone who knows this breeder and she has a history of this. She says she will talk to the president (I'm not really sure of what) and see what she can do. She basically told me there is little chance of getting the money back. I'm not sure how I would demand it back.   My heart is breaking.
Boxers,2pbx0o,walkerlucas,1 point,Thu Dec 18 04:48:36 2014 UTC,If you have a friend or family member who is a lawyer see if they can draft something to send. Sometimes sqeuaky wheels get the greese.   It sounds like and I could be guessing here that this breeder isnt very unethical. As Boxers are prone to health issues it could very well be that you lost your $800 but you saved yourself a lot more heartbreak down the road.  Our breeder has a puppy that will be avalible later this month. Our breeder is incredibly ethical from a business and more importantly breeding standpoint. I'd be happy to send you a link if you want to PM me your email.

Boxers,2oe3vb,murm87,2,Fri Dec 5 20:35:27 2014 UTC,"West Paws has some very strong products. They make them from an extremely dense rubber. The balls are truly indestructible, but the throwing toy my 150 pound Cane Corso (Italian Mastiff) was able to chew in half after a few months, which is good compared to a few minutes all other toys last.   Nylabones are great, they start to wear down after a while, like years.   The Kongs are great but I found a lot of dogs are not interested in chewing on them, I've also had boxers in the past.   As a puppy the tuffy toys were great, but after he got so big they couldn't last, I think one may last with a boxer."

I'm pretty sure Gracie is some sort of Mastiff mix (different ears, paws, and much larger chest) so 2 lbs doesn't really worry me much. Plus they get regular exercise, and the vet hasn't expressed any concern.  Hopefully, this response doesn't sound overly defensive, just expressing that they aren't gorging themselves and that I have been keeping an eye on that. I appreciate your concern though!"

Boxers,2n0z59,jabs517,1 point,Fri Nov 21 23:54:14 2014 UTC,Thank you. It was a tremendous amount of work (mange and fiull training and breaking up the occasional dog fight) and honestly one of the most stressful parts of my life. I'm super happy I stuck it out because they are awesome and worth it. These are some of the sweetest dogs I've ever owned.

I usually don't let them have long lasting treats but that is just me wanting to avoid any potential situations.  Sophie (2.5) and Daphne (1.3) are sisters from different litters. They like other dogs and also know Allie is the Alpha (after me of course) at home.    We are super lucky that they all get along. Dog fights are scary when they happen but I stay on point for days after."

Boxers,2ksqgg,shooter_mcgavin2,1 point,Thu Oct 30 17:09:22 2014 UTC,"Our wellness plan for my boxer was set up for her to be spade at 6 months. She took it very well and it was as if it never happened. I was able to keep the cone of shame off after 2 days and not have to watch her every second. I'm not too sure about male boxers, I think my girlfriends male boxer was neutered around 7 or 8 months only because he got put on the wellness plan late and didn't have all his shots up to date."
Boxers,2ksqgg,reservoirdog90,1 point,Thu Oct 30 17:35:05 2014 UTC,"I had my little guy neutered at 6 months, he is now a year and a half. I know there is a lot of debate on this subject but I believe I did what was best for my situation.   I did not want to have him have any of the male bad habits. He does not mark, he actually pees like a girl. Rarely will hump, he doesn't really even know how to do this right, he just grabs on and just stands there awkwardly.   And we never have a ""pocket rocket"" incident.   He is about 63lbs, so a little on the smaller side, but perfect for me.  Also, during the pre-op blood work, we found out he had some high levels in his heart. We did some extra testing and found out it was just a little murmur. Nothing to worry about, but should retest him every couple of years. I am glad we found this out early because they also said it could possible effect him getting surgery later in life, aka: it won't be safe to put him under.  This is another PRO to getting it done early, we found out some valuable information.  At the end of the day, it is up to you, and what you feel comfortable with."

Boxers,2bjatk,Jaxerjay,3,Wed Jul 23 21:41:03 2014 UTC,"I have flown with my boxer from the Eastcoast to the Westcoast. I flew with United Airlines because their petsafe program accepts short nosed breeds (one of the only ones IIRC). For united they required that he have a bigger kennel than usual because of his breed. My guy is about 60lbs and we had to use the large (largest?) kennel 40"" L X 27"" W X 30"" H which he fit comfortably. As far as prep for the flight, I had to reserve space for him on the plane by calling their petsafe program after I reserved my flight. Then within 10 days of travel I had to obtain a health certificate from my vet clearing him for travel.   On the day of my flight I had to drop him off at a specified location at least 2 hours before my flight. They will weigh him in his crate and that is when you pay. It cost around $400 dollars for me. He had two bowls of water which I froze beforehand in order to avoid spilling (summer months so it melted quickly). I didnt give him any food (you may want to/have to because of the length of travel). For bedding I used a regular crate pad. When I landed I picked him up at a specified location where they take the animals. He appeared to do very well and looked happy when I picked him up. Even though I worried about him the whole time, overall I thought it was a good experience and good option if you HAVE to fly with your dog. I have done it twice now. Each time I took direct flights in order to avoid layovers/unnecessary travel time and stress for him.   You are flying internationally so there may be other requirements like quarantine for a period of time before your dog is allowed to enter the country."
Boxers,2bjatk,primetyme313,2,Thu Jul 24 00:24:42 2014 UTC,You should call your airline.
Boxers,2bjatk,TakesAnswerOffTheAir,2,Thu Jul 24 00:15:36 2014 UTC,We flew our boxer round trip to the Philippines using Petsafe. He was young when we arrived there and the trip seemed to stress him quite a bit. Returning a couple years later we used Northwest/Delta and they were fantastic.   We've since relocated to the Caribbean.  There were some extenuating circumstances wrt the country we now live. But the main consideration is at we couldn't fly him except during cooler months. Most airlines seem to have prohibitions on this breed.   Regardless if you use an airline or a pet forwarder (very expensive) be sure to do your diligence wrt the USDA paperwork and the destination company medical requirements. It takes time to get vet certifications and some country require them notarized. Plan ahead...

Boxers,29rnge,reservoirdog90,3,Thu Jul 3 19:57:39 2014 UTC,"I'm going to guess a food allergy. One of our boxers had a very similar reaction to something in one type of food. Changed the food, no more allergy.  So, try a completely different brand of food and see if the problem goes away. Some benedryl for a couple of days to calm things down until a new diet kicks in isn't a bad idea either, but I'd confirm that with the vet, first.  I'm really sort of surprised the vet hasn't been more aggressive about this if it's getting this bad."
Boxers,29rnge,demiller,2,Thu Jul 3 21:34:45 2014 UTC,"Agreed on the point that your vet should be more concerned than they appear to be. It doesn't hurt to get a 2nd opinion from a different vet. We actually went through 2 different vet offices until we found a solid one that really took the time to figure out our pup's various ailments.  Also, sounds like some sort of allergy. Benadryll helped our boxer/pit mix when he started getting a pink rash on his belly."

(Source: I work in a vets office)  I have an itchy dog as well and they prescribed me a steroid and an antibiotic and told me if she still was itchy to use Zyrtec since benadryl didnt work for me.

Boxers have tons of energy and if you don't do things to burn off some of it, they'll find a way to do it themselves. That can mean a lot of chewed up furniture, messes in the house, and guests and family being jumped on.  Boxers are not ever ""leave them alone"" dogs. They need to be around people and want to be close to them all the time. They want to play, to ""box,"" to run around the yard, go on walks, etc. They crave a lot of attention and that's often why they end up in Rescue - people get them and don't get that this isn't some Golden you can park in the back yard or will lay around peacefully in a small apartment.

Boxers,29ey4h,ToothPickNick,1 point,Mon Jun 30 05:11:19 2014 UTC,"Consult your veterinarian before making any drastic change to your dog's diet. Here are statements from the American Veterinary Medical Association, the American College of Veterinary Nutritionists, the American Animal Hospital Association, the Food and Drug Administration, and the Center for Disease Control on raw diets. You will find that although raw diets have become a popular trend (due in large part to misinformation spread on the internet), most experts on nutrition and health strongly discourage them, especially those prepared at home. Some highlights:  ""Avoid feeding inadequately treated animal-source protein to cats and dogs."" - AVMA  ""At this time, the vast majority of purported benefits of feeding raw foods remain unproven, while the risks and consequences have been documented."" - ACVN  ""Past proponents of raw food diets believed that this was the healthiest food choice for pets. It was also assumed that feeding such a diet would cause no harm to other animals or to humans. There have subsequently been multiple studies showing both these premises to be false. Based on overwhelming scientific evidence, AAHA does not advocate or endorse feeding pets any raw or dehydrated nonsterilized foods, including treats that are of animal origin."" - AAHA  ""FDA does not believe feeding raw pet foods to animals is consistent with the goal of protecting the public from significant health risks."" – FDA  ""Do not feed your pet a raw diet. CDC recommends against feeding raw food to dogs and cats because of the risk of illness to the pet as well as to people living in the household."" - CDC  Raw diets have a high risk of pathogenic contamination, and even those dogs developing resistance to pathogens will still pass them in the stool and saliva, posing a disease transmission risk to other pets and family members. Preparing a diet at home also runs the risk of nutritional imbalance, which can lead to serious metabolic disease. An overwhelming majority of home-prepared diets are deficient in at least one critical nutrient. Commercial dog diets must adhere to nutrient profiles laid out by the American Association of Feed Control Officials to prevent nutrient deficiencies and imbalances; home diets do not undergo any of this testing or quality control.  What it comes down to is that while the dangers of raw diets have been well documented, there is no peer-reviewed evidence for any benefits that raw diets are claimed to provide. Despite many pseudo-scientific claims to the contrary, there is no scientific justification for why raw diets are supposedly ""healthier"" than cooked diets. In addition, most of the alleged benefits of a raw diet can be achieved with a high-quality commercial diet that has been subjected to rigorous formulation and quality control standards. Don't forget that ""natural"" doesn't mean ""safe"" or ""better"" - wild canids have much shorter lifespans than our domestic dogs. It is not worth the risk."

Boxers,284kwj,Montanieers,5,Sat Jun 14 12:28:19 2014 UTC,"I have a purebred white boxer now, previously had a mix, and my family has two mixes.  They have all been goofballs.  They love to run but also love sleeping all day, most of them do indeed box (youtube for Boxers Boxing), they are way more ""emotional"" than other breeds that I've owned.  (I know you're not supposed to assign human emotions to dogs, but they do seem to have quite a range..)  I never had a drooling problem until my current one, and it was due to a bad case of brachiocephalic airway disease -- basically the nostrils and trachea->nose area being too restricted for proper breathing.  He had no stamina at all and slobbered all the time.  It was about a $2500 fix but he is a totally different dog post-op.  (I adopted him at 5yo, breaks my heart that he had that problem for 5 years untreated)  Size-wise my smallest mix was 48lbs and my brother's (the largest) is 80.  Mine is 65lbs.  The size shouldn't matter too much; they're fine in small apartments as long as they get regular exercise (I knew someone that had two boxers in a tiny 1BR apartment in manhattan and they were happy as clams).  Mine gets at least an hour of outdoor time every day.  He LOVES to run more than anything.  He'll run until he collapses.  They also pretend to be indestructible but then turn into sad little children when any minor thing goes wrong..  If you're adopting an older dog, just be on the lookout for ulcerative keratitis (treatable), deafness (~30% of white boxers are deaf), and tumors.  Many rescues will pay for initial medical bills, but if not, just know what you're getting yourself into.  Lastly, give them a LOT of time to adjust post-adoption especially if they are older.  It took a solid 30 days until I even had any inkling of what my guy's actual personality was (and in the meantime I thought I had made a terrible mistake and brought home a monster), and then another 6 months until he really got comfortable.  But it was worth the investment!"

They both dont normally drool but TJ (the one on the right) is a bit slobbery after drinking water, we assumed it something to do with before he was rescued because the other one doesnt do that.   They are both really playful and like to run after each other and box. And if you dont teach them not too, they will jump all over you when they are excited! I think its super cute when they are exited cause they jump up with just the front paws and get all bounce=y! They are very clever dogs!

Their coat is smooth and tight-fitting; colors are fawn or brindled, with or without white markings, which may cover the entire body, and white. Boxers are brachycephalic (they have broad, short skulls), have a square muzzle, mandibular prognathism (an underbite), very strong jaws, and a powerful bite ideal for hanging on to large prey. The Boxer was bred from the Old English Bulldog and the now extinct Bullenbeisser, and is part of the Molosser group. The Boxer is a member of the Working Group.

My boxer is super calm(can get excited when in the mood) and does not drool at all -- only when he drinks. He is very expressive with his body and face when he is happy. They wiggle their bodies like kidney beans and then wiggle their little stub tail. They are so loyal to their owners and act like the world is ending if you even leave them for 5 mins to go the the bathroom. Their farts can clear an entire room of people and they are prone to digestive issues, allergies and separation anxiety.

We just want out dog back.  I will not bore anyone with the extreme details unless you want them. My daughter was having a procedure done in Orlando and we were staying with family (having traveled from Fort Stewart, Georgia) when this occurred. My nephew has severe allergies and we could not leave the dogs in Georgia because no one could watch them for us. The deal was that the dogs would stay on the screened in back porch (I know, my mistake already). On one particular day it looked like we were going to have severe weather and I did not feel comfortable with leaving our dogs in their kennels. I know them too well. If we would have left water bowls in their kennels the dogs would have knocked them over. I decided to leave them on the porch. Mitch (the brindle boxer) tore a hole in the screen and ran off. This is not like him (in case you were wondering). Our family members put the word out and he has been sighted several times but we think someone may have picked him up. There was a possible sighting of a dog that looked just like him with a brand new collar and harness today (http://imgur.com/WoVcwHq). We do not know if it was him. We will do anything to get him back. I need him, he has helped me through so many dark times, I dont even fucking know anymore. Please help us."

Boxers,26q17s,tomchlud,2,Wed May 28 19:48:20 2014 UTC,"I wouldn't worry too much about the water thing. Most dogs will go find water and food when they need it. You're more likely to end up with pee on the couch than him getting dehydrated. If you haven't already, you might put his water bowl somewhere he can see it from his perch.  I'd probably wait for him to start roaming on his own. Boxers can be incredibly stubborn and trying to move him, particularly if he seems anxious about that, may well end up with him just digging in his paws, so to speak. Hang out with him, act normal, and he'll probably start to explore as he gets used to the new environment.  Boxers need their ""pack"" more than any other dogs I've ever dealt with. He may feel lost and not part of your pack/family yet. Let him get comfortable and he'll be looking for way to get into stuff around your house in no time. :-)"

Boxers,26ahoc,bustedravioli,1 point,Fri May 23 18:31:52 2014 UTC,So sorry for your loss. I actually had to let my 13 year old lady go yesterday. It was a roller coaster of emotions but it was the only option I had as she was incapable of moving. I did it at my home where she wasn't stressed and as comfortable as possible. There are no platitudes that will relieve the pain but I know that my lady is no longer suffering and is chasing birds and swimming in a lake somewhere. Maybe with your special girl.
Boxers,26ahoc,Shogun102000,1 point,Fri May 23 20:01:30 2014 UTC,"Time heals all wounds is all I can say OP. It's difficult getting attached to a pet and have to put them down, but you have to realize that to do otherwise would be like putting your own wife or one of your kids through pain which can't be treated. It's cruel.  Not the best answer, I know, but just keep your chin up and remember that the next boxer you should get might very well be just as big a joy as this one. I know when I lost my two great danes it was very difficult, especially for my wife who enjoyed them tremendously, but we both found that getting another pet was a great way for us to move on and we are having great years with our boxer Charlie currently.  P.S. I would simply tell your children she got very sick and hurting a lot, so she had to be put down and is in a better place now. One where she is happy and running around like she usually does. I found it helps children understand though they will still not understand why it had to be done."

We were a little nervous about him dealing with a puppy at first, but he treats her like she's for him. He does have some experience with a small dog (we also have a Yorkie), so he was really gentle with her.  She picks up on his behavior, kind of following them around, eating when they eat, and going out when they do.  The only hang-up (which really isn't one) is that when Oz is ready to relax, Jezebel is stilling in overdrive and ready to play."

Boxers,24qyqg,ddh0,7,Mon May 5 14:28:47 2014 UTC,"take puppy classes. Boxers can be really stubborn so knowing exactly how to train her will work in your favor.   What's her name? She looks so precious!!!  Oh, also, be prepared for super high energy, even when she's an adult. I would recommend taking her to a dog park as early as you can (maybe 6-9 months old) to socialize her. It can be difficult taking a boxer to a dog park for a couple reasons though: people confuse them with pit bulls and freak out (which is another sadness in itself). And, since boxers play differently than other dogs, some dogs take their boxing to mean aggression. So, be able to tell the difference and be able to jump in and separate if you need to.  Find other boxers she can be friends with, if you can. Only a boxer can truly know how to play with another boxer.   Have fun with her!!!"
Boxers,24qyqg,marbri27,3,Mon May 5 05:58:24 2014 UTC,"I'm sure you know this, but posting for others that may read the comment. be very careful at dog parks. especially when it gets busy, there's bound to be an owner there that doesn't train their dog correctly and may be ready to fight. go to parks first and meet owners and know who their dogs are before letting your puppy off the leash."
Boxers,24qyqg,doodaid,5,Mon May 5 11:21:16 2014 UTC,"My wife and I got a Boxer for our first dog together. He is 2.5 years old now and we've come to appreciate a few things about him and what we assume is typical of most boxers.   He is keen to please. With some early direction as a pup he has become very concerned about doing the wrong thing. He's cautious about going under or behind furniture to get toys that end up there. He has almost never chewed anything that we haven't explicitly given him.  We have taken to using the command ""ahh ahh"" instead of ""no"" whenever he is about to do something he isn't supposed to.  It's very effective.   He showed some initial aggression in relation to food which we were concerned with because we are expecting a child. The first time we stuck a hand in his bowl while he was eating he snapped a bit. He was scolded harshly and he seemed to be a bit shocked. To this day he is a bit weird about food which we attribute to his nervousness about inviting a similar reaction from us. He has an excellent memory for disciplinary things. By that token he learns really quickly and has easily been the most well behaved dog either of us have ever owned.    He, like most Boxers, seems to be very people oriented. He isn't a snuggler per se but he loves attention. He needs some room to run around everyday and gets restless and annoying without it. He likes to entice other dogs by swiping at them with his front paws. Usually this is well received but some dogs (and their owners) can obviously take this the wrong way.   He has been around plenty of kids and acts appropriately. If too many strange people get too close at the same time he becomes nervous as most dogs would.    I'm avoiding the 20 paragraphs that would be required for me to adequately capture his awesomeness. I will own at least one Boxer dog at all times for the rest of my life. Amazing breed period. Best of luck to you but you won't need it. Enjoy!"

Get used to it. 5) You will be protected from all the dangers of the suburban environment: vicious mailmen, moms walking with strollers, packs of middle aged men on bikes wearing all spandex racing gear.

Boxers,24qyqg,Str8-outta-Campton,2,Mon May 5 14:30:07 2014 UTC,"This is so true.  The only thing that isn't in my 3.5 year old's case is number 5.  I came home from softball late last week.  My wife was already in bed sleeping with our dog when I got home.  I came in through the front door and expected him to be waiting there from hearing my truck pull in the driveway.  He wasn't there.  I put all my stuff down and went to the bathroom downstairs.  He still didn't hear me.  Walked upstairs and was greeted by a meowing cat, he still didn't hear me.  Went in the bedroom and another cat who was in bed with my wife and dog started meowing and he still didn't know I was home.  I went to the closet to change and he still didn't hear me.  Sat in the bed and still nothing.  Finally found where he was under the covers and started petting him and that finally woke him up.  For a split second, I think he was terrified until he turned and saw me and his licking and nub wagging was out of control.  I realized that if we ever have a break-in, I'm on my own against an intruder."

First and foremost i want to just say thank you  in advance for all your comments. I have been on Google since I've got off work but figured here it would be a little more personable.   Someone asked what her name is. Let me throw a little backstory in with what i decided... I've been struggling lately with problems that include both women and alcohol. A few nights ago i prayed (yes im a christian, sue me) that god would put a woman in my life that would love me, be loyal and support me in my sobriety. Little did i know she would be of a different species. Then last night the name ND (pronounced indie) came to me. Which stands for ""no drinking."" She's a constant reminder of something far more healthy to invest my time and money in than a bottle. I guess there wasn't much need to go too far into detail with that. But i figued if i just said ""ND"", i'd have gotten a few comments like, ""what the hell kind of a name is that?!""  Also. I wanted to ask about crate training. I put her in there for a bit earlier and she whined like crazy! Is this something she will get over or is there a more appropriate age (she's barely 6 weeks to begin this?   Again, thank you all for the input, you all have made me feel like I'm going to have a great time with her. I look forward to being apart of the /r/Boxers community!"
Boxers,24qyqg,Nrenee918,1 point,Mon May 5 06:46:17 2014 UTC,"Just browsing, and found this post. I have had many many boxers over the years and they have all been an absolute joy. They are the sweetest, most loving dogs on the planet. My suggestion about crate training is to just be diligent. Hide some treats in some fluffy blankets for her to find and leave it open for her. I wouldnt use her crate as a punishment place, as you want it to be a safe and happy place for her.   Personally, I find boxers are very easy to train. To potty train, we hung a bell on a chain low on the door frame and would ring it every time we took her out(sometimes taking her paw and hitting it) . Stick to a potty schedule and be diligent on the bell ringing. Eventually, your sweet baby will begin ringing it herself when she needs to go out. How cool is that!?   Btw- how great is it for you to channel your energy into something positive! Thats great! My mom has a boxer she uses as a therapy dog to keep her sane. You will find no greater joy than the love of a boxer."
Boxers,24qyqg,random012345,1 point,Fri May 23 04:26:20 2014 UTC,"Hey! Thanks for the advice. I think i will definitely try the bell thing. Im really having an issue with her not making an effort to try and go outside. I pay close attention to her, and when we go outside she has no issue going, how ever it seems as soon as i walk out of the room or do something else she poops in the floor. There are other animals in the house so I'm afraid the other smells may be an issue.  Also, is there an appropriate age to begin trying to teach her common commands such as sit, stay, etc? She's about 8 weeks right now and seems to have the attention span of a gnat. She has learned her name and that when i say ""aah-aah"" she's doing wrong. Again, thanks for your advice. If there's anything else please share! :)"
Boxers,24qyqg,Damer71,1 point,Fri May 23 05:07:20 2014 UTC,"The bell worked for mine in about 3-4 weeks. It does take a bit but she'll start getting curious in about half the time. Eventually she may just ring it all damn day just because she wants to play outside but it's better than whimpering and peeing at the door. (or anywhere else)   Do you have other dogs in the house? If so, take them out together. Allow the older one to mentor her. If you can find a treat she really really likes, tease her with it. Mine wouldnt allow me to cut her nails at all, nor would she allow her previous owner, until i figured out that wet food and beggin strips are boxer crack. Now, i open the can or the treat jar, set it aside, and give positive feedback and maybe a tiny taste for each calm and successful foot. Works like a charm. Maybe you could use this technique with going outside? Let her smell, then take it outside with you, then dont hand it over til she's used the restroom a couple times. That's something important to remember also, she's still tiny and likely needs to use the restroom 2-3 times per session. (15 minute potty breaks maybe?) Honestly, you just need to devote a ton of attention to her. If you see her squatting pick her up, ring the bell, and boot her little butt ever so gently outside. Restrict her access to one or two rooms for now and as she gets better with her behavior begin opening up others. Take her everywhere you go in the house and pay close attention. PM me if you need anything, seriously. I'm open to boxer baby discussion any time :-)"
Boxers,24qyqg,armandof8,2,Fri May 23 05:23:52 2014 UTC,They hate loud noises. Not a dog to take to fireworks or a loud concert outside. Take her everywhere to socialize as soon as possible
Boxers,24qyqg,w4ckywiz4rd,2,Mon May 5 14:20:08 2014 UTC,When you put her in the crate praise her and give her a treat. Make the crate a happy place and if you can wear an old shirt for a few days and put it in the crate so she gets used to your smell. Also if you can try to get in the crate yourself so she knows it is safe. Took my dog awhile to get used to his. But leave a bone in there for her and make it positive.   I also love the name ND it's a great idea and a cute name.

Boxers,24qyqg,kimberlyf,2,Mon May 5 20:11:35 2014 UTC,"Keep away cloth and rope toys! Only let her play with them in your supervision if you get them, and immediately get rid of them once they start fraying at all. Ropes are great for tug-o-war, but not for chewing. Once they start fraying them up and swallowing them, they get into their stomach. On their own, the strands aren't bad but they get caught up with other debris and can cause dangerous/deadly blockages. Also, make sure any cloth toys or rope toys are natural cotton and not nylon/synthetic so if they ingest the pieces they'll digest over time.  If possible, stick to only really hard rubber."

Then there was the whole ""get that pitbull away from me and my dog."" My boxer is the sweetest thing on four paws and is afraid of his own shadow. Some people are just dicks.

Boxers,23t27b,SprunkMaster,7,Thu Apr 24 01:08:01 2014 UTC,"Honestly Boxers tend to have a different play style than most other dog breeds. Not all, but some. Boxers tend to ""play"" like.. well.. actual boxers who fight in a ring. As in, fore-arms up, batting them around, VERY bouncy. Boxers were named after their tendency to use their arms like actual Boxers, they tend to also play this way.  I've been working at a dog daycare for 3 years. I've met lots of dogs of different ages, breeds, backgrounds, sizes, temperaments. Probably at this point over a thousand dogs and got to know them quite personally. I've seen this happen with Boxers before. Heck I have one that I see once a week who plays in a typical boxer fashion and he for the life of him cant figure out why other dogs aren't having fun with him. He just plays like a boxer and other dogs don't either get it or want to play that way.  Look for other boxer owners, or just dog owners in general whose dogs seem to have the same play-style as your dog. Grab their numbers or just ask them what days they go with their dogs and meet up with them. Its your best bet.  Edit: Now that I look at his age I'm quite certain this is what is happening. I don't have much trouble with older boxers in my packs at dog daycares, its the younger ones who can get into ""trouble"" due to their energy intensity and play style. Also sorry for rambling I've had a long day."
Boxers,23t27b,h34th3n,5,Thu Apr 24 00:29:12 2014 UTC,"This is completely true, I had boxers for nearly 20 years, in my experience the best dog for a boxer to play with is another boxer. Stay away from the dog parks, find a basic park, meet up with dog owner friends. You will then avoid the attack dog fear from stupid people.   I'm surprised about the mastiff, my current dog is an itialian mastiff and he's seems to have the same demeanor, including the front paw boxing."
Boxers,23t27b,h34th3n,3,Thu Apr 24 01:11:01 2014 UTC,"I had my boxer (male) at a normal park once and met a couple with boxer puppy (female), about 4-5 months, a beautiful light sandy fawn color. They were excited to see a full grown one, as the dogs came in contact, the puppy immediately gave mine some paws to the face. The couple was so apologetic saying she's never done that, I assured them that was not the last time."
Boxers,23t27b,s1ncere,6,Thu Apr 24 01:14:51 2014 UTC,"dog parks are filled with stupid people and bad dog owners, i would suggest trying to stay away if you can. too many times i have seen good dogs and owners get blamed for something the other person/dog did, and is normally the result of a bad owner. good luck to you."
Boxers,23t27b,awsmwsm,7,Wed Apr 23 22:28:38 2014 UTC,"I once showed up in the early morning at the local dog park and there was 6 Boxers from 3 different groups. My boxer made 7 and let's just say it was the best time ever for my dog. The boxer play style was in full effect and it was great to witness. I bet there was people who did not even enter that day!  Like others pointed out my boxer loves to chase and loves to be chased. In my experience there are no bad dogs, just bad dog owners. When a person says that to me I realize that there dog is an extension of then and I just stay clear."

At times she'll be super sedate, at others she'll be super energetic and wanting to play around with me. She's actually a rescue. My mother, one year, was driving down the road and saw this woman had stopped her car on the side and was trying to help this dog that was wandering around with puppies either into her car or off the road. My mother opened the door and put the puppies inside and in she jumped into the front while the puppies where in the back. I believe she was super abused because at first she was always jumpy and would run away if you went walking out. And she was clearly starving. Now, if you walk out of a room you have to step over her. She's like ""Bitch, please. I'm laying here. You can go around me."" Anyway, she was in the truck and ate some cheese sticks my mother was bringing home for me. I still tell Perdy to this day that she owes me more cheese sticks. :D They had named the puppies (my mother and a couple others) Walker and Texas Ranger, they got adopted out, but my mother needed to get rid of Perdy as well, since she already had a bunch of dogs to help take care of. I volunteered to take her as I wanted a companion of my own and I loved Perdy (I had no one in my life at the time and was incredibly lonely, but she helped me through it by being awesome). For most of the time I had her she's been a bed dog, though not that I have a wife she has her own little couch bed thing. I love her lots and probably wouldn't have made it through some of those years without her being there always."

Boxers,20djpo,n2speed125,1 point,Fri Mar 14 23:28:27 2014 UTC,Ha I meant for toys that can be left in the crate. We live on a farm and go camping in the summers.

You might run in to some problems with boredom being in the apartment when you're not out and being active with the dog, chewing would be the main concern with that.  Honestly I would go for it if you can take them out everyday to work off some of the energy. Boxers make awesome companions and will be stick by you for life.

Although that applies to all breeds  Boxers especially: They need lots of exercise. If you don't have a big yard, be sure to walk/run them everyday.   Boxers also have very strong jaws, so make sure to get yours tough toys. Anything plushie/soft will be devoured in minutes. Go with Nylabone or similar  Boxers usually don't love water/swimming, so don't force it  Boxers are the most expressive, happiest, silliest breed of dog I know. You're going to have so much fun! (but they can be known to be stubborn, so stand your ground when training)  Post pics when you can!!!!"

Boxers,1xrgyj,marcins,4,Thu Feb 13 22:43:19 2014 UTC,"I posted this in a comment further down, but just in case: be sure to also check out /r/boxer - seems to be the canonical Boxer sub! (~4,800 readers vs 986 in /r/boxers) and a lot more posts.  To add something new though - /u/marbri27 already covered the main points. One of the things I knew about Boxers when we got Lucy was that they are high energy and need lots of exercise, but I was surprised to find that she could just as easily spend hours napping on the couch (but a single ""Do you want to go for a walk?"" and she's be up and jumping around.  They are really good with children, we had a baby a year ago and Lucy was very gentle and patient with him.  She was very tolerant of getting pinched and having her ears pulled, and only started getting a bit more playful with our son as he got closer to a year old and was more mobile.  Obviously you still need to be careful, and supervising, with dogs and children - no matter their temperament.  Sorry to be a downer, but you might want to consider pet insurance - Boxers are known for all sorts of medical issues (as are most pure breeds) and the bills can add up, especially once you start getting into diagnostic tests etc.  We just lost our girl at 3 years old to heart failure, we didn't have insurance and it cost us about AU$2,000 to find the cause of her health issues, and then another AU$1,000 or so in follow up vet visits and meds to have her with us for another 2 months.  I'd happily pay it again to have another 2 months with her though :("
Boxers,1xrgyj,xburns2,2,Thu Feb 13 06:30:25 2014 UTC,Toys are a must just like /u/marbri27 said.  Don't let your boxer jump! just turn away from him/her.
Boxers,1xrgyj,DeviantLycan,2,Thu Feb 13 04:51:35 2014 UTC,"I have had over 7 different boxers from birth to death (two still alive) and I have to agree with most of this advice, especially TRAIN TRAIN TRAIN.     a Boxer is intimidating to people and proper training is not only for you but to make others comfortable around you.  (you don't want to be like that loud lady at Walmart with the annoying bad kids) When training, consistently use hand motions as well as words (google this.  the common signals are probably not what you would expect but there are reasons for them.  i.e. sit signal is palm up where as lay signal is palm down) Get a tag for their collar with your address and phone number  It costs $10 and is the best insurance that you could ever buy. They will be in full on puppy mode for 2 years and then settle down.  They will seem like a different dog almost after 2 years.  Sometimes the first years they are a hand full, but I promise that they settle down. If you get a male, I would recommend neutering after 2 years if you want him to have that real boxer look. Boxers that have thinner ears and smaller paws tend to have a softer personality and be less aggressive (NOTE:  I mean aggressive in a relative form.  I in NO WAY believe that boxers are aggressive dogs.) I would recommend a Prey Model or BARF diet if it is feasible for your living situation(I have used a prey model diet on every single one of my dogs with amazing results).  These diets result in a healthier dog over all, but if you have a yard, the uh...   land mines will be much smaller and literally dry up and go away within 24 hours. Speaking of back yards, if you have a house, I would recommend a doggy door.  Not the kind with the rubber flap, but a really good one like the one from Ideal Pets.  If you are in an apartment, please please please walk them every day for at least a half hour.  Even, better, run with them. Running with your dog means that you will not have to mess with their nails as often because the concrete will keep them short. They are MUCH easier to live with if they have a puppy friend, but wait at least one year to introduce another dog or they tend to be harder to train. As with all dogs, Boxers can be dominant or submissive.  Either is good in it's own way, but if you have more than one dominant dog, you could be in for some scuffles.  Additionally, dogs with dominant personalities are harder to train.  Watch the litter when you go to choose and you may be able to get a sense of their personality and predict this in them. Wipe away their eye goop with a tissue if they have it otherwise it gets in their nose wrinkles and is gross. Always remember that a boxer is a lap dog.  Always. Beware of their farts. They will always have that Kidney Bean shape when you get home.  It's completely normal.  Expect it, love it.  :) Seriously, Get a tag for their collar"
Boxers,1xrgyj,DeviantLycan,2,Thu Feb 13 21:10:39 2014 UTC,"Thanks for this! This is very helpful.  The fellow that I'm picking her up from has said that there are no genetic problems in their lines. The parents have had 3 litters with great results and nobody has ever complained or gotten back to him about anything negative, it has all been positive....  I'm hoping this isn't bullshit. I picked the guy apart and asked him a million questions about his litter and business as a breeder. He said that both parents are purebred CKC registered but the puppies aren't. They also come with a non breeding contract saying that I must get the puppy fixed at 6 months old, he sell's to pet homes only because it is better for the health and temperament of the puppy."
Boxers,1xrgyj,DeviantLycan,1 point,Thu Feb 13 22:51:11 2014 UTC,"I can kind of understand why they don't want you breeding her and if it is a girl the tough guy broad shoulder look is not as big of a concern. I am glad to hear that you have a home and not an apartment since Boxers really need to have their space and a yard.  Really consider the dog door.  It makes a huge difference in your life. Boxers need a size large door and when you install it, remember that the puppy will grow!  It should be installed so that the top of the inside of the door is a few inches above their back, so maybe get a height measurement against your leg of the momma dog.  The baby puppy may have a tough time getting through it at first since it might seem high, but that will literally only last for a couple of months.  With a large door, I know that some people worry that it would make it an easy entrance for a thief, but seeing a dog door that big means that there is a dog that needs a door that big inside.  ;) Be careful of the big bad Parvo.  I have had 2 dogs get it, both of who survived it, but it is a big deal.  You will know because they won't eat and their poop will have a distinct smell.  I hope you never have that issue, but it's not the end of the world if it does happen.  It is just expensive."
Boxers,1xrgyj,xchocolatexmustardx,1 point,Thu Feb 13 23:21:52 2014 UTC,I've heard of this through a friend. Is it preventable by getting a shot from the vet?
Boxers,1xrgyj,DeviantLycan,1 point,Thu Feb 13 23:41:07 2014 UTC,"I don't know.  I try to raise my dogs naturally, they go to a holistic vet and eat a prey model diet, so I try to avoid any unnecessary shots.  Like I said though, out of the 7 I had only 2 got parvo and that is the only real sickness that any of my dogs had other than the cancer that took them at the end of their long lives (9 to 13 years.  avg for a boxer is 8)."
Boxers,1xrgyj,Femmerogue,1 point,Thu Feb 13 23:51:13 2014 UTC,"My husband and I are going to get a boxer in the spring. Do you think the dog door is necessary? For one we live in Canada, brr. And for two we have cats that are not allowed outside.   Most likely this dog will never be walked, as by the time we have this pooch we will be on a 4 acre farm yard. Hopefully we will just be able to let her out appropriately."

The fix for it was expensive, both with drugs and rehab (from what I understood) and the owner couldn't afford it. She was going to put her down. The vet took her and paid for the treatment himself, but he said he had too many dogs at home already, and knew that I loved Boxers and was looking for one. She came home with me 6 months after all this happened.  So I guess we could say she was a rescue."
