iOSthemes,3e3em9,FormerRedditorAMA,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:26:14 2015 UTC,"Not OP, but basically you go to the ""Menus"" title to name and create the menu. Then you create a menu and add the actions you want to add, e.g. respring, reboot, safe mode. After that, go to choose where you want the action and what you want to activate the menu. So just choose ""Anywhere"" and then choose the action (for example, I chose the three finger pinch). Then you choose what you want the action to do, which is to open up the menu you just created in the first step (it should be whatever you named it).  If you have any questions, feel free to ask. It was a bit difficult to explain, but I hope this helped."

I recently dug up the project and found out that while I was using this theme, back when I was creating it, I had deleted almost all of the icons because I was mixing the theme with others for my setup. This means that all my work on packaging the theme went in the trash.  Luckily I have the PSD still and I have all the glyphs and backgrounds saved in it. Now I have to go through it, save all the icons and repackage the theme again >.< This will take some time but I will do my best to work on it a little each day in my free time."

iOSthemes,3e1vbc,srector,2,Tue Jul 21 08:56:51 2015 UTC,"So if you guys are unaware of Paragon, it is an awesome windows phone theme with a lot of added enhancements. It requires dreamboard and has not been compatible since iOS 7 (matchstic put out some patches to make it work for a little while but has many other projects that have been taking up his time lately) Anyways, the theme was great. It had custom animations, a great application launcher, live tiles, a custom lockscreen, custom notification banners and volume hud. I loved it. Unfortunately, the developer had walked away from the project for some personal reasons and most people forgot about it. But now there is good news. He recently posted that he is working on an update for iPhone 6/6+ users and even posted a teaser photo of his progress. Just wanted to share the news. Hope you are all as excited as I am.

Edit: this works for appstore apps. if you want to change stock notification/alert sounds you can enable the downloaded stuff through winterboard.

iOSthemes,3e055g,i_luh_dat,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:56:05 2015 UTC,Yes IconBundles matters because no matter which theme has top priority IconBundles will always theme before regular Bundles
iOSthemes,3e055g,ani604,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:28:35 2015 UTC,"In fact, the way the theme is build matters. Themes using the IconBundles method are always overriding themes containing individual app bundle folders. I wouldn't know a way to fix it other than re-compiling one of the themes to have both using either IconBundles method or individual app bundle folder method."
iOSthemes,3e055g,h_long,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:34:33 2015 UTC,So I'm going to put al of the zoobhoy dirty ape folders into their own icon bundles folder. That should make it so that the zoobhoy dirty ape theme is the main one and the m'flat theme is the secondary one right? Or am I also going to have to take the dirty ape icons out of their individual app folders before putting them into a new Icon Bundles folder?
iOSthemes,3e055g,Lenian,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:37:55 2015 UTC,"IconBundles works differently than regular bundles.  In regular bundles, Facebook and Snapchat might be something like (these aren't the names, just making them up as I go):   Bundles -> com.facebook.app -> AppIcon60x60@2x.png  Bundles -> com.snapchat.app -> Icon60x60~iphone@2x.png   Whereas in IconBundles, they're both:   IconBundles -> com.facebook.app@2x.png  IconBundles -> com.snapchat.app@2x.png   So you would have to rename everything to an appropriate name so IconBundles would work rather than just throwing them all in a folder. You would need to find the icon that's used on your springboard, put the icon in the IconBundles folder, and then rename it. You'd need to do this for every single icon you want."
iOSthemes,3e027c,RacistOr3o,3,Mon Jul 20 22:33:13 2015 UTC,"Instead of making new icons, it's much easier to just search in the IconBundles folder for a current gotham icon you aren't using and use it for the app you want. That's what i was told to do and it's a lot easier, especially because there are so many Gotham-style icons."

ALSO MAKE SURE YOUR THEME ISN'T IN ANOTHER FOLDER BECAUSE IT WON'T WORK IF INSIDE ANOTHER FOLDER.

Finally, there is a Youtube tutorial series that shows you how to setup a repo, but he also goes over the structure for a Debian package and shows you how to make one. He has tutorials for Mac and Windows, although the Windows one is a bit of a workaround because of Windows's limitations.

iOSthemes,3dt21c,iAMtripLe,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:20:12 2015 UTC,The difference is these icons likely just use a circle mask to cut down the non-themed icons. Gotham doesn't really have that ability so unthemed icons remain unchanged.

I'm sorry if this was already made by others. I think Andrios covers this, but I figured I'd make an HTML-based version of it in case someone doesn't want the whole package Andrios brings.  As you can see in the options area you can make the clock 24 hours or 12 hours, change the color of the time and the date, change the position from the top of the page (Let me know if you need it up further! I'll change some settings around), and you're given 4 options for font weights for both the clock and the date. I tried to make this as close to the original as I could.  If it is too big on your screen for iPhone 4/5, let me know! I'll add options for the font size too!  Enjoy! :)"

iOSthemes,3dt8jl,M_Woodward,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:38:18 2015 UTC,I will add the font resize option! Once I feel things are optimal I may release this on modmyi if enough people like it or would download it!

iOSthemes,3dsz1b,Beto300,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:42:52 2015 UTC,"You're missing my point. Minimal is a term thrown around very loosely around here  All you did was theme your icons, hide the icon labels and dock background, centered your icons using iconoclasm, and used a plain wallpaper. That's not minimal, that's simple (which isn't a bad thing). Just because you're reorganized your icons and used less space doesn't mean your setup is minimal.  Your homescreen is also very cluttered - Take a look at your status bar for example. Do you really need your carrier there? Or the battery indicator? In fact, do you even need to show your status bar on the homescreen?  -Takeon is a dope theme but it's not a fitting example for minimal. I would recommend Glyphs or Kvasir 2. Plus your calendar and apple music icons aren't even themed. Your icons can easily be resized so they don't look squished   -Do I even need to explain the page dots? It throws the whole setup out of whack   If you wanna make it a minimal setup, I can give you some suggestions. Why don't you hide your status bar? Or even use a different layout? You can use Wink to hide the status bar at will and Anchor to move your icons around. Protean can be used to rearrange and hide your status bar icons. If you don't wanna completely get rid of your carrier you can theme it with Zeppelin.  You can afford to resize your icons with Bigify too  Next time pick a better name for a setup"

If somebody submits a theme with copied icons and it does get accidentally accepted (such as if the repository manager didn't recognize them), it's important for people to send a polite note to the repository manager to ask them to look into it and compare the icons, and then the repository manager will remove the theme if it turns out to include copied icons."

I agree about stealing, but all these visually similar themes are getting ridiculous.  My example would be, someone is new to theming. They see this and they think it's beautiful because they have never seen Ayeris or Amury. That's a decent example why I think people at mmi, BB and zottd should actually be more careful."
iOSthemes,3dt30u,twahlHD,0,Sun Jul 19 20:42:46 2015 UTC,"Hello there, you seem like a very concerned netizen. I appreciate your concern over all the arguments u've mentioned but just to inform you, this is a theme created by the same person who made the theme Aupi, hence the photos or any other icon may look kik a modified version of Aupi. Not just that, even the YouTube and mail icons are just refinements of the icons that are already in Aupi, so it's not a copy from some one else's theme. Rupi is a refinement of his previous theme Aupi So please check it out before you post further opinions. Also, now that you've said that it looks like a blatant copy of amury, the second screenshot that I posted (with the control center opened up) is a setup of @iamury (who designed the theme amury) himself. I got that picture from a twitter post he himself posted. When he himself doesn't have a problem with this theme, y do u worry?"

iOSthemes,3dtjux,yohyohyohji,5,Sun Jul 19 10:48:44 2015 UTC,"Alright here we go!  Now that you have IconBundles, you'll need to use your file manager (iFile or anything similar) to navigate to the folder in which the Odin theme is located (/Library/Themes if i remember correctly). Create a folder named exactly as 'IconBundles' in the Odin theme folder.  We take the settings app as an example from here on. Open up the folders within Odin theme folder and search for 'com.apple.Preferences'. This is the folder which contains the icons for your settings app. Move the icon with a size of 120x120 into the 'IconBundles' folder we created earlier on. Then rename the icon to 'com.apple.Preferences@2x' and you're set!  Reapply the theme, respring and you should see that it have changed. It should also be noted that if you require masking (rounded edges, etc) for your icons through IconBundles, you can do so. refer here > nickfrey.me/iconbundles/  If you encounter any problems, feel free to ask! :)"

iOSthemes,3dtjux,yohyohyohji,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:56:35 2015 UTC,"Perhaps you could try this cached version of it?  :)  By 'different bunch of folders' I'm assuming that you have Odin's statusbar theme, icon theme, etc? If that is the case, just look for Odin's icon theme (I'm not sure what it is named as I don't have the theme, but search individually within the subfolders until you come upon the app icons in it).  The IconBundles folder should be created within the Odin icon theme folder. For example, we assume that the name of Odin's icon theme folder is called 'Odin Icon', so you'll have to create a folder inside that (.../Odin Icon/IconBundles)  (once again, I'm not particularly sure about the icons included in Odin, but it should be noted that some applications may not have an icon made for it, e.g. iWatch)  If you can't figure it out, feel free to upload the file and I'll help you out with it :)"

iOSthemes,3dt426,peng81828,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:01:51 2015 UTC,What I use (and recommend) is hiding the battery and percentage altogether and using BatteryPeek to show the percentage when needed.

iOSthemes,3dt426,Kairek,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:05:17 2015 UTC,Use wink for the status bar part and go into the permanently visible section and select the parts you want visible. I use it to just have the time and nothing else.

Also Trance is the only kind of music on my phone (for the most part. ) I have a few House classics like 'Your Love,' 'Big Fun,' 'Promised Land' etc. as well as a few Deep House tracks, but like 98% of my music is various styles of Trance."

To make your own themes read the comments in symbols.js on how to fully customize this theme and ask me any other questions you have! Font, font size, color, position on screen, 12 or 24 hour clock, whether the date is shown, the separators between the hour and minute, what are normally slashes in the date, all of these are fully customizable and the separators have the ability to change dynamically to whatever you want!"

Thank goodness for the latest jailbreak.  I'm still in love with my icon theme, which I have decided to call Vale. However, the background was getting a little old, so I switched it up and tried for a darker look, which is not my usual style. I'm a little rusty, and sad that not all my favorite tweaks work, but I made the best of it.  I will be working on a limited release of Vale once I have completely updated Arketyp.  Also, I'd like to have custom folder icons again, so if anybody knows of a working tweak, please let me know! That would be the last thing to complete my setup."

Do the same for the folder titled, ""iPhone"" (This may be different for you, depending on your device, but I think iPhone, iPhone6, and iPhone6+ are the only three options), but only set access permissions for the owner, and give it read/write/execute permissions.

iOSthemes,3dkp70,RoxasChibi,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:49:04 2015 UTC,"So for the wi-fi and signal strength, I used Gauzy, a theme on ModMyi.   The eye is a Zeppelin icon from a theme called Odin, which is on Hoenir's repo (repo.hoenir.net)  I hid the rest of the status bar using an amazing status bar tweak called Wink. It allows you to hide certain statusbar components, and if you tap the statusbar, they appear.   You can also use HideMe8, or springtomize 3 to hide Statusbar components, although I think there are some bugs in hiding statusbar components in springtomize 3."

Just over 100 icons and support for @2x, @3x and iPad. This has been tested on the iPhone 6 Plus and should be formatted correctly for the other devices. Future updates will see design improvements; new icons and other UI based image changes. Icon Bundles are needed    You can access the Beta on my github repo: sixtyfourthirtytwo.github.io  Tendere itself is free and I will be taking requests. On the Cydia page, please see the section about requests if you’re thinking of sending some over.    You can follow details/updates about my work via Twitter.    If you decide to check out Tendere, and have any feedback, please do share it, here, email or twitter. I’d love to see any setups on different devices.   Enjoy. :)"

iOSthemes,3ddwea,rennsport,2,Thu Jul 16 04:29:04 2015 UTC,Any chance of you releasing a .psd with some of the design parameters in in so we can make custom icons to fit the more obscure stuff we use? What I mean is a .psd that has drop shadows/swatches/noise settings/etc. already in it.  I ask because I use some apps that I'm not sure very many other people use and I doubt you'd want to spend your time making icons that won't get much use.  This theme is awesome though. I've been following your work for over a year (maybe more?) now and loved the older Tendere (and Flatro) along with your wallpaper packs. I think you used to put your stuff on dA?

iOSthemes,3dgdxj,BeatzByDurr,3,Thu Jul 16 01:42:37 2015 UTC,"The icon theme is Infinity Script, for iOS 7-8.12? But it works on my 6+ iOS 8.3 after some renaming. That status bar is not from Infinity Script and is also modified but not totally sure because it could be done with different tweaks because of the different glyphs, and also placement on Status bar is different, (clock should be centered). Time on Homescreen is probably an iWidget but I'm not sure which one. The Icon layout is probably from Springtomize, but could also be done using Home Screen Designer or Iconoclasm or maybe even a free alternative. I'm pretty sure the icons with the line underneath is from Apex 2 (once you tap, more apps can be chosen). Lastly, the dock is hidden? or background hidden and many more added so I would guess Springtomize. But it could be a few other tweaks that add more apps to the dock (like Infinidock, possibly Harbor). Hope this helps."

iOSthemes,3degsh,lejazzvp,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:27:26 2015 UTC,I'm curious. Why did you use the psb format instead of psd?
iOSthemes,3degsh,lejazzvp,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:56:47 2015 UTC,"Hi mate. It's just personal preference, and only really for the more complex icons. I scale to 4 different sizes for all devices. I also find working at 120px quite hard on detailed icons. The smart object (PSB) is nested inside the PSD, and scales down as if it where in the main template. This is because I use vector shapes instead of brushes/patterns. Thank you.  EDIT: To further elaborate. I choose 240px smart object, because some things don't scale down well from larger canvas's. It's a good size for me, and keeps a level of detail I'm comfortable with. Also, with the PSB nested inside the PSD (usually in a ""2up"" window), I can hit save on the smart object, and it updates the main template. That's why I have them setup like seen (with the 120px icon usually sitting in the lower half of the screen), so I can watch the changes live as I update the smart object (ctrl + S in the smart object, updates the changes in the 120px PSD).  Thank you."

iOSthemes,3dfq7r,QueenOfTheDawn,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:30:25 2015 UTC,Yippee I figured it out!  I played around  with the width stuff in the iFile folder and got it to center eventually.  I'm guessing now that maybe these themes were made for older iPhones was the problem?  I'm using an iPhone 6
iOSthemes,3dfq7r,pokaprophet,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:04:46 2015 UTC,"Hey, what device are you using? If on a 6 or plus could be reason. This theme was made for smaller screen. You could use LockHTML instead of groovy lock (almost all theme which work with one will work with the other too). LockHTML has option under advanced to move the widget position manually. It's just an x,y coordinate adjustment so takes trial and error."
iOSthemes,3dfq7r,pokaprophet,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:05:23 2015 UTC,That's what I did to fix it just played around with the coordinates in iFile but I'll give that try for the next time I need to move a theme thanks :)  and yes iPhone 6

I did get the battery frame to be the same transparency and it looked good, until I put the battery level background into the box, this caused the transparencies to overlap and looked very ugly with some parts of the battery being more transparent than others. I will try to find a solution, bear in mind that this is a first draft, try not to be so negative."

But I chose to take matter in own hands, also cause I like to do some theming and photoshopping. I only didn't know how to theme when I put up the request. So this is my first release, and have posted it to the ModMyi repo.    The current package version in the repo is 1.0 which has a winterboard dependency, which is added by the ModMyi monkeys. I updated the control file with removing the winterboard dependency and added the LockGlyph dependency. Thus, this .deb package will soon be updated to version 1.1 (temporary direct download link here)   Tell me what you think! =)  Unlocking sound is the ""wob wob"" sound (AKA the Sound of Q-Dance) at the end of every Q-Dance party or video.

If you use Bundles need to put that image in a folder and then rename the image with the properly name (search in ifile/ifunbox) If you use IconBundles maybe you didn't have installed IconBundles or the name is wrong

It may not have had all of the features of iOS 7/8, but with tweaks, you can replicate almost every aspect of iOS 7/8 (from the UI to the UX). I actually did this before iOS 7 was released. About 20 tweaks that already existed were integrated into iOS 7, so I had it all first on iOS 6 without all of the bugs.   To each his/her own.

iOSthemes,3d8lf0,tronatula,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:07:32 2015 UTC,"ugly - That’s what I think of iOS 7/8. But if I were running iOS 6 and decided that I wanted to theme my device to look like iOS 7/8, I could do so with themes and/or tweaks to the point that it would be virtually indistinguishable from iOS 7/8 (and I could get better battery life than iOS 7/8, by disabling or not installing tweaks to replicate features of iOS 7/8 that I don’t want).    Even Apple seems to think that iOS 6 design elements are pleasing enough to use on their latest iPod nano (which was just updated with new colors today, but not a new UI). Does this look more like iOS 6 or iOS 7/8?  http://imgur.com/V0L7R3B  http://imgur.com/buLWiCu  http://imgur.com/klug5xU  http://imgur.com/ogaTqOp   low speed - iOS 6 was better optimized than iOS 7/8 weak CPU - This is hardware related (nothing to do with iOS 6 and prior releases of iOS), however, iPhone 4S, iPhone 5, iPod touch 4th and 5th generation, iPad 2, iPad 3rd and 4th generation, and iPad mini were very capable and powerful devices.  low RAM - This is also hardware related, however, iPhone 5, iPod touch 5th generation, iPad 3rd generation, and iPad 4th generation have 1GB of RAM.  small screen - Again, hardware related, however, iPhone 5 and iPod touch 5th generation have a 4 inch screen (the best size screen for many, if not most, people); iPad 2 and iPad 3rd and 4th generation have the same screen iPads have always had, and iPad mini has a screen size that many people think is the prefect size.  low battery - Hardware related, however, all iPads have amazing battery (regardless of which version of iOS happens to be running on them), the original iPhone had the best battery life of all iOS devices (someone correct me if I’m wrong) and could last a month on standby, and the iPhone 6’s battery doesn’t seem to provide better battery life than the iPhone 5 (since the iPhone 6 has more pixels to power and more built-in features to maintain). lack of features,... Again, I can recreate almost (if not all, by now) features of iOS 7/8 without being forced to have ALL of those features on my device; I get to choose which features to have and which to ignore while running jailbroken iOS 6, while running iOS 7/8 forces me to have all new and old features (regardless of my desires to keep or remove them), and this negatively affects battery life.  ease of jailbreaking - iOS 6 and prior were the simplest jailbreaks.    Edit: I forgot to mention that a major aspect to consider is stability, and iOS 6 is considered by many to be the most stable iOS release.

iOSthemes,3d3n6w,AdventureOwl,10,Mon Jul 13 06:53:07 2015 UTC,"Hey guys, here’s a quick tutorial for crossfading the lockscreen wallpaper to the homescreen wallpaper, as seen in my most recent release.  To create this effect you’ll need HiddenSettings8, which can be downloaded from Cydia.  Next, swipe up the ol’ control center, and hit the SpringBoard Settings banner (you must un-hide AirDrop if you are hiding with another tweak, eg. Springtomize). Head to the 'Lock Screen' section of the main menu.  The original tutorial I followed was a screenshot of a HiddenSettings7 configuration (and I have since lost the link), however I have since played around with the settings, and have made a few changes.  This picture shows the settings I used to create my the crossfade animation as seen in the linked gif.  To increase the duration of the fade, simply increase the four numbers; remember that they represent the length of the crossfade in seconds.  You can also play around with the interpolation, however I normally keep it similar to the setup in the picture."

iOSthemes,3d2ask,twahlHD,-1,Wed Jul 15 01:07:26 2015 UTC,How are you justifying the price to be $1.49
iOSthemes,3d2ask,Simplifyze,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:41:55 2015 UTC,"He put time and effort into designing this, and it looks great. Its very well done, not just some mediocre theme. $1.49 is an extremely fair price considering there are some themes out there for $2.50+ that honestly don't look as cool as this in my opinion."
iOSthemes,3d2ask,twahlHD,-2,Tue Jul 14 10:08:29 2015 UTC,"It's definitely mediocre. I go to school for graphic design and marketing and I can tell you, what he created could be done by all of you rather quickly and easily.  He literally found a glyph pack online and took space pictures online and slapped the glyph on top. It's extremely easy to do.  How is it that themes like Ayeris or Zoobhoy takes months to creat and this guy created an entire ""theme"" in 7 days?  Other themes that are over a dollar have a CC theme, some UI changes, a themed status bar among other additional features. Charging a $1.49 for essentially stolen work (the space backgrounds I also do not think he created himself either) just because it looks cool? Nah. Just about any theme that is ""spacey"" so to say will look cool.  The comment that you made that ""he designed it (false, taking other people's art is called ripping) and that it took him a long time (false, 6-7 days to create a 100 icon theme, give me a break) are both uneducated answers. Taking your opinion of it looks cool is not justification for charging for stolen property."
iOSthemes,3d2ask,eyeclouddotcom,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:27:25 2015 UTC,"While I agree that this is a seemingly simple theme to design I'd say that is why it's only $1.50. While I may be able to find these images and glyphs and photoshop them together and format it and name all the icons properly, I'd gladly pay someone $1.50 to do that for me. Also you have no idea how much work went into this and the fact that it ""looks cool"" Is the only point to a theme.. You should also have proof of theft to backup your condecending statements. You should take a look at some of these themes that are charging $3 for basically stock icons with a gradient or something. At least this one looks different enough."
iOSthemes,3d2ask,twahlHD,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:53:46 2015 UTC,To each his own
iOSthemes,3d2ask,Simplifyze,0,Wed Jul 15 20:48:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I guess I can agree with that now that you bring it up. It would be quite easy to put something together like this. I was a bit hasty with my previous comment. But I mean if someone thinks it's worth it then they can buy it, and if not then no one is forcing anyone to buy anything. I for one like the way it looks so I think I'll pick it up, but I mean, to each their own.  Edit: about the whole stolen images thing, I agree that it's not okay to charge for something that's stolen. I did see that NASA has some royalty free space images and such on their website, and I'm sure there's plenty more out there, so perhaps those were utilized? But who knows."

In order for this to properly work the bar must be placed on the top half of the screen so it isn't blocked by the keyboard. I recommend using a different springboard layout to accommodate the search bar similar to what is shown in the screenshot.

iOSthemes,3d4s99,Iffy82,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:49:54 2015 UTC,Anchor is true simplest icon placement tweak. Just put your icons where you want them.
iOSthemes,3d4s99,a_lost_irishman,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:40:06 2015 UTC,I think Boxy is easier than Iconoclasm and not as battery/CPU draining as Springtomize.

iOSthemes,3d16rh,adamsandleryabish,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:10:20 2015 UTC,GroovyAPI has some stuff for javascript to check if there are notifications being shown and you can chose what happens when there are. Just put something like transition: top 1s ease-out; in the css for the parent of all the elements you want to move and use a ternary operator in a javascript file to change it from wherever it is normally to wherever you want it to go and back again.

That being said I won't be taking icon requests either. All stock icons are complete plus a decent amount of 3rd party icons. I hate to release something that's not finished but I didn't think it was fair to let it sit on my computer either.  You will need to install Icon Bundles to use this theme. Tested and working for iOS 8.4. Hope you enjoy ;)  https://www.dropbox.com/s/qcfjjj2qbx6920e/BLCKLSTD.zip?dl=0  EDIT: Forgot to mention there are a bunch of alternate icons for certain apps within the theme. You will also need to select all 3 ""BLCKLSTD"" themes in winter board because I never combined them into one folder, sorry."

The text is illegible- gray on slightly lighter gray is s horrible combo, especially with the thin font. The iconography is also inconsistent, the bottom bar's icons do not match at all, different sizes and colors. Also keep in mind that most tweak's icons are not flat, I doubt Saurik wants to make a new flat icon for every tweak just so it blends in on the front page. Also, the fact that there's no dividing lines anywhere means that all the UI elements just sort of blur together, especially since they're all just varying shades of light gray."

iOSthemes,3cwygm,ani604,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:18:06 2015 UTC,So it's a stock wallpaper! I thought it is some kind of a tweak or the work of Springtomize.

Make sure all other badge tweaks are uninstalled and delete the files with Icleaner. It's one of those weird things with jailbreaking. Some tweaks work fine for some and send others into safe mode.

It is going to work exactily the same way as r/jailbreak and r/iOSthemes. There is nothing there yet but I hope soon there will be. Please up vote this  so more people know about it.

I'm not too certain what this means, but from what I'm getting, I have lost a couple hundred mAh from just general wear and tear? is this correct? or has the number been the same since I got the phone, I don't know.  also, my usual amperage is around -100 to -200mA. still don't know how this figure compares to when I'm being hard on the battery, but I've seen the number fluctuate to figures like -300 when checking on the app every few minutes.

iOSthemes,3cvuxu,tdmd,11,Sat Jul 11 05:13:10 2015 UTC,"I could have declared WinterBoard 1.0 years ago, but I have a running gag where the version numbers of essentially everything I develop is 0.9.#### (which was caused by my automatically generating the version numbers for all of my packages out of Subversion revisions numbers, back when I used Subversion); I mean, to put it this way, as far as I know, WinterBoard is ""robust"": it is installed on tens of millions of devices, and seems to be pretty damned stable ;P (although you just reminded me of one bug I should really push an update to fix... :/). (To anyone reading this: if you are a theme artist, and you know of any bugs in WinterBoard currently, please report them ;P.)  As for ""feature requests"", through experience porting WinterBoard to new versions of iOS over the last seven years, I've come to the pretty firm conclusion that WinterBoard should avoid firmware-specific features and instead stick to its core functionality of resource asset replacement; all of the features I've added in the early years rotted quickly and then become an unmaintainable mess :(. Themes end up relying on features specific to the firmware version that WinterBoard is not going to be able to maintain in the long term, but then WinterBoard is in the painful position of essentially never being able to remove those features because people running the older version of the firmware with the older version of the themes need to be able to upgrade to the latest version of WinterBoard without everything breaking :(.  All the new awesome features people might want are better, and quite simply, built as separated extensions (as in, small ones that are packaged separately and each take on one feature) that can be abandoned (but left working!) if they ever become fundamentally obsolete. Due to Cydia being built on APT, a package manager with dependencies, users always just have to say ""install"" on a single theme package and all of the random components needed to load the theme will get seamlessly installed; and due to WinterBoard supporting general plist resource asset replacement, all of these components can (and should!) not come with their own configuration panels, and just be ""themed"" by WinterBoard (so the component would actually have WinterBoard as a dependency), from the user's perspective they also are just selecting a theme.  I would love to support anyone who wants to build these kinds of components that work with WinterBoard. Any developers who don't understand what I'm talking about should reply here with their question and I will try to walk them through what I'm talking about and how make it work. Again: WinterBoard really really really needs to stick to the things that it can guarantee forever (so, resource asset replacement, and the various concepts that directly map to resource asset replacement), along with its core user interface functionality of theme prioritization. Everything else should not end up in WinterBoard: it should be built as external components that themes depend on and which can be configured by WinterBoard themes (to be explicit: you just use a configuration plist in a bundle and then artists ""theme"" the plist)."
iOSthemes,3cvuxu,saurik,2,Sat Jul 11 09:41:16 2015 UTC,"Hmm, why don’t you put IconBundles into Winterboard? I think that it would be useful for a lot of themers (myself included). It’s open-source but is slightly buggy at the moment."
iOSthemes,3cvuxu,JackHaal,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:24:13 2015 UTC,"The functionality of IconBundles requires manipulating the icon loading mechanisms at a higher level, which is code that tends to rot between versions of iOS and also interferes with Apple's performance improvements and caching strategies. I have talked with various theme artists about the functionality, and it has also been pointed out that the concept doesn't deal with multiple icon types correctly (at different resolutions or for different uses in the operating system), and so it does not seem like something that should really be encouraged for use.  I mean, to put this in perspective: the website for IconBundles ""skips a step"", and goes from SummerBoard's Icons/ folder directly to WinterBoard's Bundles/ folder, without describing the ""dumb mistake"" WinterBoard had for a while, before I came up with the idea of Bundles/, which was essentially IconBundles: you were able to use Icons/{bundle}.png. If you read the release documentation for WinterBoard, I actually described this feature: I dropped support for it, because after around four years of dealing with its issues, I decided it just wasn't a good idea.   With this information you can now use the bundle identifier as the name of a file in Icons/ (such as Icons/com.apple.mobilemail.png). [1]"
iOSthemes,3cvuxu,saurik,2,Sat Jul 11 23:59:22 2015 UTC,"thanks for responding so quickly.  i agree, winterboard is pretty stable and perhaps robust was the wrong word.  to start things off, 3 requests if they're implementable:   profiles (similar to Setback tweak) - the ability to save the current selected items as a profile so we can switch between themes or configurations. sorting ability either by date added or alphabetically. theme preview (with ability to set this option on and off)   that's just to start things off.  if they're simple enough to program, please add these features.  i believe it wouldnmake winterboard better.  thanks again"

iOSthemes,3cvuxu,jongautreau,2,Sun Jul 12 01:55:22 2015 UTC,"Unlike in the App Store, there is an expectation that large numbers of users are still running versions of iOS a couple years old, so it is not reasonable to design a system that makes it difficult to ship them key updates.

iOSthemes,3csfz0,Alricca,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:15:17 2015 UTC,"lol I'll definitely give enkel a try to see how it fits, totally agree with the date thing but I don't think I have a choice, I actually like having the date accessible outside of my first Homescreen page, and stripe widget also doesn't have any options to disable it so... Any ideas?  Ps. I did remove the carrier with protean and looks good, Thanks! Appreciate the feedback!"

iOSthemes,3ctveg,Minimalman,2,Fri Jul 10 19:02:06 2015 UTC,It's as simple as changing the old icon name (probably AppIcon60x60@2x.png) to App Icon60x60@2x.png. The only difference is the space.
iOSthemes,3ctveg,Tobysmc,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:15:25 2015 UTC,Ive been trying do do this for a while i never knew it would be that simple! thanks a lot!
iOSthemes,3ctveg,Tobysmc,2,Fri Jul 10 22:24:54 2015 UTC,No problem. I had to do the same thing for Odin. It's a great theme.

iOSthemes,3ctveg,-MTAC-,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:31:53 2015 UTC,No it should be easy but what is the theme

iOSthemes,3cta8m,GoodCreature,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:27:20 2015 UTC,Did you search the sub? There's plenty of setups that show how to get an iOS look and feel to iOS 7/8.
iOSthemes,3cta8m,me0wk4t,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:32:02 2015 UTC,Yes I already have a few packages that does that sort of thing. I'm just looking for a package that makes the User Interface like in the Settings app look like iOS 6.
iOSthemes,3cta8m,me0wk4t,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:40:37 2015 UTC,"Try ""ClassicApps"". I'm not sure if it's on the default repos or CoolStar's, though."
iOSthemes,3cta8m,me0wk4t,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:48:31 2015 UTC,Classic Apps doesn't work.
iOSthemes,3cta8m,me0wk4t,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:17:32 2015 UTC,Hmm.. Check this out. He's on 7.1.1 and his phone looks like it's running iOS 6 (included with the legacy UI). All (if not most) of those tweaks have been updated to work on iOS 8. Hope this helps :)
iOSthemes,3cta8m,me0wk4t,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:00:11 2015 UTC,Could you provide me with a repo for UIUseLegacyUI? Also a repo for iOS 6 sounds and all the other packages? I couldn't find it because I don't have it but a repo will be very helpful.
iOSthemes,3cta8m,me0wk4t,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:15:25 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry, I wasn't the one who made that setup. I don't have any repos. You could try CoolStar's repo (which I can't remember off the top of my head right now), but that's really all I've got."
iOSthemes,3cta8m,me0wk4t,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:30:24 2015 UTC,Could you find some packages or other repos? You know how to get the Classic iOS repo? I also still need help getting the iOS 6 User Interface working on my iPhone 6 iOS 8.3.
iOSthemes,3cta8m,Phronipticus,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:37:26 2015 UTC,Classic iOS repo? I don't understand.
iOSthemes,3cta8m,Phronipticus,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:13:52 2015 UTC,Still trying to just get a full Classic iOS 6 User Interface.
iOSthemes,3cta8m,coolstarorg,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:38:24 2015 UTC,"Oh! ""UILegacyUI"" you'll have to enable in a .plist file using either iFile, Filza, or by SSHing into your phone. I'm not sure if that .plist file still exists in iOS 8, but I can take a look."
iOSthemes,3cta8m,coolstarorg,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:32:25 2015 UTC,"It didn't work when I added the ""UIUseLegacyUI"" to ""com.apple.prefrences.plist""."
