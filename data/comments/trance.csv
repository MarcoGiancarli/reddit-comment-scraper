trance,3e3qsl,PoepieMoe,4,Tue Jul 21 20:04:51 2015 UTC,Can anyone here touch on the Damus building at NOS? Searching online seems to indicate a very small capacity (4000-5000 people).
trance,3e3qsl,ahnotamoose,3,Tue Jul 21 20:23:43 2015 UTC,"Yup, been to several Insomniac events at the NOS in the Damus building. 4,000-5,000 capacity is pretty spot-on depending on how many tickets they decide to sell."
trance,3e3qsl,k_meezy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:33:30 2015 UTC,"Are they likely to oversell the event, or will there still be room to move around if it sells out? Just wondering as I've never been to an Insomniac event and thinking about flying out for this."

The building is fucking old as shit, too. Don't know if any renovations have been done to it but I'm kind of on the fence about DreamState now since its just a building. Wish they would've made a megastructure for it."
trance,3e3qsl,Necuametl,7,Wed Jul 22 02:03:46 2015 UTC,"We might get 2 hour sets from everyone as its apparently a 2 stage event over 2 days. That's assuming it's a 10 hour event both days. Ørjan is going to have to realize, ""shit I can't really play Hardwell at an event where everyone else is playing hard and fast. Might as well play a producer's set with all my old tracks"", unless he wants to be maimed. No clue as to what Sunny Lax is going to bring as I never kept up with him. Hopefully Oakie's team packs his USBs full of full on fluoro stuff and not cheesy edm shit. Everyone else will just play what they normally do and I don't think most people are going to complain about that"
trance,3e3qsl,mrmanny0099,9,Tue Jul 21 19:00:54 2015 UTC,"Source on it being a 2 stage event?  I've heard from a lot of people it's going to be only one stage.   Edit - Indecent Noise posted on his Facebook that it was going to be ""one stage each night. No thinking required"" when a fan asked how they were going to choose what artists to see."
trance,3e3qsl,Nabeezy,2,Tue Jul 21 19:32:42 2015 UTC,"With only 1 stage per night that makes 10 artists each day. Assuming it is a 10 hour event both days that means 1 hour each unless there will be some b2b sets and some sets being 1.5 or 2 hours.  How do you guys think they will make up the set times? I am seeing some information online about if the artist was presented on the left, they will be on Friday and if on the right, they will be on Saturday. If so I wonder if they will group the more uplifting artists together and the psy together or just mix it all together.  Or you think there will be one day of uplift and another more psy?  At least Insomniac has released the lineup so early and we know who will be there before we buy tickets. 100 Dollars is a steal for this lineup even if the Canadian Dollar is garbage atm :(. Definitely catching this event."
trance,3e3qsl,INNNNNNN,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:05:02 2015 UTC,"That would mean they have like 1 day full of artists and the next day (psyday), only 2 artists :P."
trance,3e3qsl,PoepieMoe,3,Tue Jul 21 22:26:51 2015 UTC,Seriously. Two days and a small amount of artists. This is going to be amazing. I don't think Orjan will have a problem keeping up. He's been around forever.
trance,3e3qsl,TheChrono,2,Tue Jul 21 19:27:04 2015 UTC,"Sunny Lax's sounds have taken the same turn as the rest of Anjuna - more melodic electro house than anything. I really didn't like his latest track but Daenerys and his Kiliminjaro remix have some absolutely lovely vocal chops. My guess is he starts off with the more modern, thumping electro progressive before settling into his older sound."
trance,3e3qsl,mrmanny0099,2,Tue Jul 21 19:03:42 2015 UTC,In that case he's going to have to have the conversation with himself as Ørjan is

trance,3e3qsl,fieryscribe,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:20:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's tough, especially when certain artists will only be closers and/or won't go on after lesser names.   Do you have suggestions on making it better?"
trance,3e3qsl,alexisaacs,2,Wed Jul 22 00:06:11 2015 UTC,"certain artists will only be closers and/or won't go on after lesser names.    Actually, that's typically not how festival set lists are made.  While, yes, opening slots are typically there to premier up and coming DJs/producers and to warm up the crowd, and the closing sets are for the headliners, there is TONS of room for who performs at what time.  The absolute first restriction is the performer's schedule. If he is already booked elsewhere in five hours, he won't be closing your festival. That means that if Armin was booked for Dreamstate, for example, but had to perform at another venue just a little after, he would not be closing, and might not even be in a traditional ""headliner"" spot. i.e. Dreamstate runs 5PM-12AM, Armin has a gig at 1AM in Vegas, so he would perform Dreamstate around, say, 9PM. The result is a smaller name would certainly be the closing act.  Obviously the next factor is budget. Using the same Armin example, and using hypothetical booking rates, he probably wouldn't perform back-to-back shows in different cities for a small sum. So does the festival pay extra to book him, or do they book TWO smaller headliners instead? Or book one smaller headliner, and spend more on production? Going along with this, proximity is another obvious factor. If Armin is in Italy on those days, he's instantly out of the picture.  The next factor is setting up the crowd. This can't be conflated with setting the mood/atmosphere. Setting up the crowd means that if you take our previous example with Armin, and toss him on at 6PM, the crowd will be going nuts for him. If they're coming at all, they will sure as hell make it for that time slot. If they're rolling, they'll be peaking at 6PM. The climax ends up being at 6PM, which means by 10PM people are leaving. Typically festivals will toss in smaller (but still popular) names in between the big ones, forcing people to stay longer and keeping the festival active during all hours.  Unfortunately, the smallest factor in all of this is ""mood"" and ""atmosphere.""  Festivals that try to incorporate many genres end up forgoing this entirely. You'll see trap artists performing in between prog-house and trance artists. It's super goofy. People there solely for the music have to wait 1-2 hours in between sets to hear something they enjoy, people on drugs don't get to be up during all their favorite performers, and the overall festival isn't as cohesive, nor does it tell any kind of story."

trance,3dul14,PoepieMoe,2,Sun Jul 19 17:31:42 2015 UTC,"You should be able to find the albums on Youtube if not on any of the streaming services. For politics of dancing volume one, start with the track Autumn (I think it's number 14) on the first disc, and the first five or so tracks on disc 2 are amazing. That's how I always start it when I put the album on. And PvD is another legend of trance. His music is what I listened to when I first got into dance music so there's a lot of great memories associated with him, his tracks and the songs he played early on when I first started going to shows.   I envy your journey right now of discovering all these great tracks for the first time!"
trance,3dul14,DaInconceivable,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:07:22 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the input, looks like PvD is quite praised for Politics of Dancing albums, I'll definitely check that out. Yep, YT got it and I'll listen to that.  And about my journey of discovering great trance tracks, I say I have mixed feelings of joy from listening to great tracks and disappointment after listening to some of the tracks by the same artists. For an example I like old A&B tracks rather than the new ones.   I've read somewhere that trance music is shifting into different paths and it isn't meant to stick around with its signature characteristics, thus trance listeners should be more flexible about accepting newer type of trance track. Some say nowadays trance isn't what it used be anymore and past beyond its glory.   Anyways as long as I can listen to the tracks that I like I'll be happy; doesn't matter whether they are old or new."

Also, Bryan Kearney just released This Is Kearnage, a compilation mixed by himself and Will Atkinson.

For the record I listened to A&B's Anjunabeats Vol. 11 in couple of months ago before I listened to Tri-State and Sirens of the Sea and I didn't like that.

trance,3dtl8r,cazku,3,Mon Jul 20 09:26:27 2015 UTC,I feel you. Orchestral Trance is picking up here and I am tired of standing awkwardly while everyone raises up their hands for what seems like forever.
trance,3dtl8r,scrubbingbbl,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:34:47 2015 UTC,Well i raise my hands in hopes i generate some lift.
trance,3dtl8r,scrubbingbbl,2,Sun Jul 19 19:26:53 2015 UTC,Some Soundlift  I'll see my self out now.

trance,3dtl8r,BLAND_AS_OVALTINE,3,Sun Jul 19 22:31:41 2015 UTC,"I personally dislike orchestral trance. I have yet to hear a track that I don't find incredibly cheesy. I do like uplifting trance, but bass-heavy tracks with a lot of layers and a simple melody are preferred over those that focus more a predictable buildup to a lot of synths and a quick drop. JOC is what I like, Andrew Rayel us what  I don't."
trance,3dtl8r,PoepieMoe,2,Sun Jul 19 17:08:28 2015 UTC,"I'm curious what you think about this track, because the trance part fits your description fairly well, and IMO it's the least cheesy orchestral trance song I've heard.  I don't like most orchestral trance either.  You can tell the people who make most of it have never been anywhere near a real orchestra, and they don't know very much music theory, which is why everything sounds cheesy.  Geert Huinink & Mike van Fabio - The Kingdom"
trance,3dtl8r,sunny_and_raining,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:34:41 2015 UTC,The Kingdom. What a massive track that was and yet quite simple for an uplifting orchestral track.   Kelly Andrew - Wonderland (Intro Orchestral Trance Mix)  The BPM is a little slower than most JOC tracks but this is a simple yet wonderful piece which isn't full of euphoric layers and the bass is pretty dominate throughout this track.

trance,3dtl8r,Lefthandedsock,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:28:33 2015 UTC,His live sets sound more than his productions. Though he does have great tracks.
trance,3dtl8r,boogiepanda,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:45:58 2015 UTC,"I love his tech trance tracks, but a lot of the vocal stuff he does is just unbearable for me (same with A&F)"
trance,3dtl8r,LostInTheAyther,5,Tue Jul 21 00:29:53 2015 UTC,It just seems a bit cheesy to me.
trance,3dtl8r,mrmanny0099,5,Sun Jul 19 15:02:50 2015 UTC,"Used to love it 8, 10 months back, the subgenre contained my favourite tracks and DJs. Now I just find it too formulaic and generic. Then again, nowadays I find trance too formulaic and generic, so I don't know if it has anything to do with orchestral or just trance generally."
trance,3dtl8r,scrubbingbbl,2,Sun Jul 19 11:51:57 2015 UTC,"I love it personally. Really good mood lifter. I am not the dancing type so I don't really care that it isn't really good to dance to, I listen for the beauty of the music. It's a bit formulaic, but most trance is in general. Hell if a song doesn't follow a formula for the most part a lot of people complain about how it's not really trance or some shit so I don't really see how formulas are something to complain about haha."
trance,3dtl8r,scrubbingbbl,2,Sun Jul 19 16:45:24 2015 UTC,"Tried to get into it, got to Ahmed Romel and turned back and went the other road towards harder uplifting and tech-trance. I like my music that is at a high tempo to hit with the force of 400 ton train going at 95mph."
trance,3dtl8r,PoepieMoe,2,Sun Jul 19 17:28:33 2015 UTC,you're definitely afraid of 100 mph

trance,3dtl8r,Cobalt81,3,Sun Jul 19 15:28:10 2015 UTC,You'd be quite surprised at how many people are just bored of uplifting/orchestral.

trance,3dtl8r,mtra_,2,Sun Jul 19 19:40:58 2015 UTC,Agreed. I have been having a bad weekend and Uplifting Orchestral has got me through. It is a great mood lifter but it can also make you cry at a very emotional time.
