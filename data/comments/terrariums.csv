After the inflorescences fade, if the plant is happy, it will generally push a bunch of pups from the base, and the one that bloomed will shuffle off of this mortal coil, to be replaced with its clones."

terrariums,3dwdlt,sniffton,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:38:28 2015 UTC,"Terrariums are aquariums with dirt instead of water. Hence the prefix ""terra"" as opposed to ""aqua"". Though most terrariums have water in them, and most aquariums have some sort of ground-like material.  Though as a point to make, amphibians, reptiles, and carnivorous plants are kept in a terrarium, which makes it pretty far from self-sustaining."

The high humidity will cause severe respiratory issues and scale rot. They are desert animals.  The green agamid may have similar care since they are in the same family but I can't say for sure.   In any case it is not recommended to house different species together."

terrariums,3dkbeq,Rannelbrad,5,Thu Jul 16 23:28:24 2015 UTC,"Best moss I've discovered for vivs is java moss and have had pretty good success with it so far. Usually sold aquatically at fish stores, after it gets terrestrial it can be hardy and tolerate a decent amout of drying. Love the look of the terrarium as well! Almost makes me want to do an island style paludarium"
terrariums,3dkbeq,desturbedninja,2,Fri Jul 17 02:23:52 2015 UTC,"I've been making planted vivariums for awhile for my geckos and frogs, but I've never done something like this. I saw it at the store and knew I had to have it. I'm not sure how to go about planting it, or with what.   I really like the look of moss. Anytime I have tried planting moss in my vivariums it has been a terrible failure.   What would you, the experts, do with this wonderful little terrarium?"
terrariums,3dkbeq,CatalystNZ,2,Thu Jul 16 23:29:54 2015 UTC,"Mosses are awesome, but require a lot of moisture. They need to be much more moist than plants, because they lack the advanced vascular feature of plants called a xylem, which runs through stems and leaf veins. Mosses simply have high moisture requirements and will require a bit of attention to not let them dry out. It's easier with an enclosed terrarium to prevent that from happening.  Just keep moss out of direct sunlight, and mist them with water often. With an enclosed terrarium you can water them less, but for my open ones I water between once and three times a day. If you are doing three times a day, you would not be using much water, just keeping them moist, but not flooding the substrate.  I am very jealous of your terrarium, awesome find. I love geometric shapes like that"
terrariums,3dkbeq,ThereIsNoJoke,2,Fri Jul 17 01:34:38 2015 UTC,What about Venus Fly Traps?  This terrarium closes completely so humidity won't be an issue at all except too much.
terrariums,3dkbeq,ThereIsNoJoke,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:40:39 2015 UTC,As an addition to my other answer. Venus Fly Traps and moss work very well together. My own traps started growing moss on their substrate on their own. Your container looks big enough for the plant if you dont overdo it with the substrate. The flower wont fit but you could just leave it open if it comes to that. If you decorate your terrarium dont forget some nice stone. good luck

terrariums,3deaul,chiefdub,2,Wed Jul 15 16:29:17 2015 UTC,"Different species of moss need different conditions.  Since I have nothing but time, I have collected a number of different kinds of wild moss from around my house, and placed them in a sand-bed terrarium (an old aquarium) with a lamp hood.  Under the moss, I gave it differing conditions, so that some moss is directly on damp sand, some on brush/sticks, some on peat moss, and some on soil.  I then watered the heck out of everything, and then misted it as it started to dry out.   Some species are a LOT more tolerant of damp conditions, some seem to want to dry out occasionally.    Finally, I've read that wild species need a winter period to reset their clock.  I must have lucked out, one of my terrariums (a boston fern and some moss in a 1 gallon sealed glass jar) is doing fine after three years in my kitchen.    tl;dr: moss should be fine, you need to find the right kind of moss, good luck?"
terrariums,3deaul,gaso,2,Wed Jul 15 19:17:46 2015 UTC,"I have just set up a moss terrarium (long 30 gal) on a 3"" substrate of peat, with a few mosses I found around home (oak savannah) at one higher, dryer end, and some peat bog moss I picked up out of town (and some accompanying peat bog plants) at the other, lower end. I have some small ferns in there (four kinds, all wild harvested), a dogwood bonsai in the oak savannah end, and some smaller, native plants like bloodroot, anemone, swamp rose mallow, and some I haven't ID'd yet, including a VENUS FLY TRAP that came with my bog moss - yeah!!  You probably have a native plant/wildlife group in your area that could consult on small plants that thrive together in humid conditions, or try a large nursery.    My approach, since I feel I somewhat know what I'm doing, was to walk into the woods and essentially take things from a small area, so I knew they grew well together and had the same sorts of little critters and soil bacteria with them. Do not take outside dirt. I brought a ton of ants in the house this way.  A bag of peat or some organic potting soil with nothing added to it fertilizer-wize is a good bet.  I made a ""pool"" with a shallow, clear plastic dish, though I threw some crickets I had in the tank and they kept drowning, so the pool is half-full of sticks and rocks so they can save themselves.  Mysteriously, the pool is empty every time I walk by, so it must be wicking out somehow.  Also, I found a very decomposed stick that came with some good, little bugs, so I put it in there, too.   I have two toads in there, and have gone around catching an assortment of bugs that don't really fly: woodlice, beetles, worms, grasshoppers, lady bugs, a caterpillar, and leaf-hoppers, that I find while I'm gardening. Most are too big for the toads to eat, now, but fun to look at nonetheless.   I AM having a bit of a mold issue.  In spots, it seems to appear, so I haven't misted in a little while.  My peat was damp when I put it in a week ago."

terrariums,3d7tou,angry_squidward,2,Tue Jul 14 11:18:38 2015 UTC,I don't really know if this will work. An airplant's base needs to dry out completely between waterings. Otherwise it starts rotting. I learned that lesson with 2 of mine so far.
terrariums,3d6r7w,RexPop72,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:29:12 2015 UTC,"Really depends on what kind you're growing. Is this something that was wild collected, something you got from another hobbyist, or a commercial grower? For most of the commonly traded ones, a consistently moist substrate and bright light will promote the fastest and most compact growth. That wild collected stuff from ebay can be a bit of a crapshoot, and usually comes with all sorts of fun things like snails and slugs, etc... Pics would be useful to get an idea of what you're dealing with."

terrariums,3ct4cs,Bombsk,2,Fri Jul 10 15:42:12 2015 UTC,"If you want real advice you're going to need to narrow your question a bit. There's more than a couple terrarium types, and I believe there's at least a handful of insect species out there too.   Are you looking tropical, desert, temperate? Spiders, scorpions, millipedes, praying mantids? The list goes on and on.   Insects and lizards aren't going to co-habitate well together, yea know, cuz lizards eat bugs...lots of them!"
terrariums,3ct4cs,Dollburger,2,Sat Jul 11 15:23:55 2015 UTC,"Do you have land that you live on? Or access to land where you can poke around, lift rocks and pieces of wood, etc.?  I am no expert, but when I was a kid in Georgia, I was outside everyday poking around and completely fascinated by the bugs. I would go out and watch the 3 inch long praying mantises, or lift the pieces of wood in the wood pile to observe the huge wood beetles that screeched when you touched them. I would even find small scorpions that I learned to handle by picking them up by the joint of their stinger.  I got creative a few times and created a vivarium for these bugs. I figured the method was simple. Take their environment and put it in a large box (a large crate I had). If the wood beetle lived in wood, I got wood. The Praying mantis preffered plants  or hard objects to perch on. Scorpions preffered wood or stones to burrow under. Etc.  It worked. It worked really well, actually. I had two praying mantises that mated. I know this because to my horror, the female ate the males friggin head. She laid egss which was fascinating because it comes out as a soft foam but hardens into something more closely resembling cement.  The wood beetles and scorpions did fine. I simply went out everyday and found a cricket or two, or a grasshopper and threw them in.  The point is, learn their environment and then make it. If they have their natural environment,  then they will be fine."
