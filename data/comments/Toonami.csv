Toonami,3dwy97,GreyouTT,8,Mon Jul 20 06:17:18 2015 UTC,I totally agree with this. Steven universe has such heart. It's really neat to watch it and catch so many themes in the writing and its soundtrack stands strong on its own. While regular show is basically just reddit on television.
Toonami,3dwy97,RolandTheJabberwocky,4,Mon Jul 20 07:08:32 2015 UTC,"Regular Show managed to be ""le exks dee so random"" without making me cringe"
Toonami,3dwy97,GreyouTT,8,Mon Jul 20 12:50:11 2015 UTC,"Less random and more a expansion on the ""2 Nitwits get in trouble"" thing. Its basically Mordecai and Rigby do a thing theyre not suppose to do, the bad thing they were warned about happens, but the twist is that its about a million times worse then anything anyone thought would happen. Pretty simple formula followed up by excellent writing makes for a funny cartoon show."

Toonami,3dtewm,Animedingo,0,Mon Jul 20 04:26:14 2015 UTC,"Did you watch the video? They said superman has no limits, which means he is infinitely strong, you can't reach a limit to infinite, the only thing holding superman back from destroying doomsday by sneezing is poor writing and a weak concept of character. Even in certain comics, such as All-Star Superman, he becomes immune to his only weakness, kryptonite. So what is the point of a character that only has artificial ""limits""?  It makes stories boring, knowing that Superman could at any point, end any engagement at any time, or could just travel back in time and stop it from happening anyway. Not to mention that he can't even die, he just goes into extended ""resting"". There is no conflict in any of his stories, he has the power to literally do anything he wants but he always holds himself back.Why? Because if he didn't every comic would end in two slides, the first, villain showing up, the second, superman killing them by farting."
Toonami,3dtewm,IDoNotAgreeWithYou,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:45:08 2015 UTC,"Of course I watched the video, unlike half the people trying to argue that goku should win.   Superman absolutely can die.

Toonami,3dtewm,Animedingo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:51:59 2015 UTC,"That's what I'm saying, superman is so powerful and omnipotent that all conflicts in the grand scale of things mean absolutely nothing to him. He doesn't like something? Travel back in time and change it. He can do anything he wants, with no repercussions.  They should make a series where superman gets bored because nothing can challenge him. So he tries to kill himself, he succeeds and creates a black hole that consumes the entire universe and every other parallel universe. The end. He'd still manage to find a way out then there would be sequels where he's just sitting in an endless void masturbating for eternity. That would be more interesting than the trash we get now."
Toonami,3dtewm,Murky_The_Murloc,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:59:38 2015 UTC,"Ok that travel back in time thing isn't a real power, that was back when he could make up shit.   Once again, the story of superman is different from DBZ. Its not about him fighting bigger and badder enemies.   Do you watch romantic comedies because Zach Braff can kick someone's ass? It's a completely different genre! You can't solve peoples problems by punching them.   Superman is the most powerful yes, but you can't solve hunger by punching people."

Toonami,3dskzh,Irongarden3,4,Sun Jul 19 01:33:36 2015 UTC,Oooohboyohboyohboyohboy! Last I heard Titmouse was talking with CN about bringing back Megas. No idea what ever happened about it but this is good news at least. Maybe we'll get blurays or something out of it.
Toonami,3dskzh,SOLIDninja,2,Sun Jul 19 03:57:50 2015 UTC,Maybe they'll make that video game with Valve finally.
Toonami,3dskzh,Flynn58,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:00:36 2015 UTC,Isn't that literally impossible since it got written off?
Toonami,3dskzh,SOLIDninja,3,Sun Jul 19 19:59:39 2015 UTC,"Nothing's impossible!  Right now and technically? Yes - impossible. Can that situation change in the future? Yes - totally possible.  IGPX was in the exact same boat a few years back as Megas is in right now and it's seeing a blu-ray release. Thing is - IGPX doesn't have a proven animation studio with a few hit shows under its belt asking CN to bring it back like Megas does(Titmouse)  It all depends on fan demand though. If they have that anniversary panel next year and nobody shows up then heck no nothing's happening - but if YOU dig giant robots, and I dig giant robots then WE dig giant robots and the CHICKS will dig giant robots."

Toonami,3dsqtx,GreyouTT,4,Sun Jul 19 07:08:16 2015 UTC,The designs are all a style choice of the manga creator. Animation on the other hand is Toei being Toei

Toonami,3dhxys,Irongarden3,4,Thu Jul 16 12:31:01 2015 UTC,"Slayers is a great series, and really has it all. Personally, my favorite series is Next, but all of them have their good points, imo. Most of the series of light novels was translated (I think it was by TokyoPop?) a few years back, and they're also really entertaining and often times laugh out loud funny. I hope that eventually the remaining novels are translated and released in English."
Toonami,3dhxys,Wakkorotti,2,Thu Jul 16 18:50:27 2015 UTC,"My only exposure to Slayers is via old TRG Productions webcomics on what was once fireball20xl.com (which has now gone defunct ever since the creator was revealed to be a giant asshole). Pretty much the MC of the creator's main comic looked liked Lina, and he poked fun at it. He also had the MC shave Lina's head bald which led to a side comic about her getting revenge on the MC. It also has Inuyasha fighting Lina, which is actually pretty funny.  Luckily we have website caches.  EY I ACTUALLY FOUND A WORKING CACHE OF TRG"
Toonami,3dhadq,pterynxli,8,Thu Jul 16 07:07:02 2015 UTC,It cool to see other networks try to get more anime/action animation but I can't help but remember a little talk T.O.M did a long time ago while I was reading this.

Toonami,3dhadq,GreyouTT,9,Thu Jul 16 16:35:40 2015 UTC,"This isn't the first time that Chiller has aired anime, as detailed in the article. But it's still surprising that they've decided to include it on their channel.  The first bunch of shows on this new block will be:    Is This a Zombie?  Tokyo Majin  Devil May Cry Black Blood Brothers   ...Not really the most interesting selection of shows (although I never would've expected to see Is This a Zombie? on US TV), but it's more or less in line with the rest of the channel's programming in terms of quality. Chances are, Toonami will continue to have a better line-up of horror/thriller/supernatural anime than Chiller, what with Hellsing Ultimate's airing last year and Parasyte coming soon."
Toonami,3dhadq,pervyninjaturtle,5,Thu Jul 16 07:13:27 2015 UTC,Is this a zombie is a fun show to watch would recommend
Toonami,3dhadq,SOLIDninja,5,Thu Jul 16 08:10:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah - and even then, no anime block ever has the same heart/soul/community/fanbase/whatever that Toonami has.  It's silly to say - but the packaging Toonami does helps a LOT - the work that goes into the stuff between the shows - the banter between Tom and Sara, the Game Reviews, the Music Videos - other blocks will try, and the fact that they're trying says a lot, but ""Only Toonami"" is an old adage that remains true."

Toonami,3dagys,wardaniel9,2,Wed Jul 15 05:08:43 2015 UTC,"was Hatchin getting better rating than SAO before this week.. I can't imagine Hatchin is more popular than SAO and thus SAO should have better rating, right???."
Toonami,3dagys,SonicGamer74,5,Tue Jul 14 19:52:01 2015 UTC,"Might be because SAO was on an Arc Finale this week.  I think Hatchin gets better ratings than SAO ever week, overall."
Toonami,3dagys,wardaniel9,5,Tue Jul 14 20:14:25 2015 UTC,probably because Hatchin has a better time slot...
Toonami,3dagys,radiospringy,3,Tue Jul 14 20:18:09 2015 UTC,"For the previous two episodes, yes.   Of course, you have to take a lot of things into consideration, and such a bump is generally unusual. Especially considering #MichikoAndHatchin maintained a consistent trend throughout the evening on twitter, while #SwordArtOnlineII was largely constrained to it's own timeslot. Reception varies as well. Hatchin was received positively, while SAO was mixed, so instinctively, I would expect it to perform better.  If you look at a full dataset (check the source link above), You'll notice that with adult swim's ratings, they start out low at 8PM, increase steadily (people seem to tune away in large quantities during The Boondocks, but it's an outlier in a largely linear relationship), they peak somewhere around 11:30, and they steadily decline until around 4am, when there's a little bump as the ""normal"" [as] programming comes on, and then falls off again.   When there's a disruption of any kind, you have to ask ""Why?"" With the Boondocks, I can look to the material itself - it's controversial in nature - perhaps moreso than the Cleveland Show, American Dad, and Family Guy. With Hatchin? I'm not so sure - popularity does play a role, but any ""watchable"" show will likely do well in a good timeslot.   While Hatchin is still doing more than well enough in it's current position and I highly doubt it's going anywhere, [as] is likely going to address the problem with The Boondocks at some point in the future.   Just some food for thought."
Toonami,3dagys,radiospringy,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:22:44 2015 UTC,"For whatever reason Adult Swim has kept The Boondocks on Saturdays and whenever it does disappear, it eventually returns, so I think there's a clear incentive to keep airing it there. Since it's TV-MA, they won't run it before 10 PM.   They've hit their contractual limits with American Dad and Family Guy and cannot run another episode unless they drop an airing from another day, and they've shown that if they can play them on ANY other day of the week, they'll do it. For example, they dropped Jack and Triumph from Sundays and replaced it with an American Dad airing. To do this, they dropped a Friday timeslot and replaced it with a second Cleveland Show."
Toonami,3dagys,anteater97,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:45:33 2015 UTC,I stand corrected. It appears Boondocks will be replaced with American Dad effective Saturday August 1st.

Good weekend. I think the recent lineup changes and future ones are breaking up stagnation. People are enjoying the hell out of Michiko & Hatchin and Parasyte's drawing a lot of interest - it's something I've only heard good things about.  I like that they're taking more risks with the lineup beyond the safe ""mega-hit"" series they had been after for a while there.

It's been pretty good overall, the animations is interesting, and all the recognizable voice talent has definitely kept me engaged.

Toonami,3ctbuz,killatubby,2,Fri Jul 10 17:03:26 2015 UTC,I love how Nagate is good pilot not because he's the protagonist so he has natural talent but it because he has natural talent and he practiced to get that good. My biggest problem with mecha shows is when the protag is just good with no practices but Nagate practices to keep his skill level.

Toonami,3c9m0d,NaturalThe1,6,Tue Jul 7 00:34:14 2015 UTC,I've only ever been to anime central in Chicago twice. We stayed in a hotel and when you do that it's pretty much a 24 hour drinking fest for three days straight. During the day you cosplay and meet new people while shopping at the vendors and going to panels and cosplay meetups and at night you party in the hotel rooms or go to the after hours panels like the hentai panels lol or playing video games.
Toonami,3c9m0d,Error400BadRequest,3,Mon Jul 6 06:07:48 2015 UTC,"How weird is the schedule? Link it.  Anyway, I've been to quite a few cons. Mostly smaller and medium-size ones, but I also went to AX last year just to see how it was. (It was worth the trip, but I also had other stuff I wanted to do. I'd have done it again if I had the cash).   First things first: Con stereotypes? They aren't as rampant as people say, but they do exist. (funnily enough, I've heard Comiket is far worse, in terms of the ""stereotype"", but instead of weeaboos, it's native Japanese) You will inevitably find some socially inept people who smell a bit weird. But it's certainly not everybody. I've met some awesome people and have done some awesome stuff at cons. Know what to expect when you get there - but don't set your expectations too high.  Long story short? You have to go to a con to really see what you think. For some? It's heaven. For others? It's hell. Some cons are shit, though. See what people think before you waste your time.   Smaller cons will be comfy. Perhaps a greater percentage ""serious"" fans just because it's smaller, but there's also a greater percentage of casuals who just want to see what's up. It's a more polarized group, if you're ""average"" in power level, you're in the minority. If you're there to make friends, you'll still make some. I normally go to nearby events with friends. We hang out, play in the tournaments, check out the dealers rooms, sit in and participate at some panels, and occasionally catch a viewing if we've got nothing to do. It's all good fun. We've also brought instruments before, and that's usually well-received.   Larger cons? Not so cozy. Some still feel reasonably comfy, but a really big con like AX? AX is fucking huge. The lines were long (took me 4 hours to get my badge, and I preregistered), but allegedly, this got fixed this year.  People are everywhere, the dealers room is packed, and if you weren't waiting a while to get in a panel, you wouldn't get in. I didn't really make many friends, per se, but there was a lot more spontaneity and a lot more ""collective inclusiveness,"" if you will. Panels will generally be bigger, and more impersonal, but they aren't any less interesting. If there's a premiere, go to it. It will be one of the most interesting things that happens, and if you talk about it, you'll make a few friends whether you liked it or hated it.   Also, if you're over 18, go to some 18+ panels (especially if they're hosted by guests). They're always the most fun. Don't get scared off by the adult label, they just want to keep kids out so parents don't get upset. They're (probably) not going to throw up full-blown tentacle hentai on the projector screen. I haven't had it happen... yet."

Biggest thing to know from me is that (at least last year) it did not fill the entire convention center so there may be another event going on nearby. That means you might get some weird looks from the ""normal people"" for just being nearby a weird cosplayer. I go to about 12-15 conventions a year and Anime Blues is definetly one of the better ones, so you'll have a good time."

Toonami,3c4513,TheShadyProfessor,8,Sat Jul 4 17:27:06 2015 UTC,Dbz Kai is already on toonami...
Toonami,3c4513,Irongarden3,2,Sat Jul 4 17:02:45 2015 UTC,He is talking about the season that started in 2014 covering Buu. Production in Japan halted because of the earthquake/tsunami disaster in 2011 and then resumed in 2014. Kai that is dubbed right now only goes to Cell. :)
Toonami,3c4513,ZaneMiddleten,1 point,Sun Jul 5 00:18:22 2015 UTC,I'm fine with that the Cell games is the best saga.
Toonami,3c4513,killatubby,1 point,Sun Jul 5 01:51:37 2015 UTC,"At the pace they're going, do you really think the dub for the Buu arc won't show up on Toonami? Ever?"
Toonami,3c4513,Flynn58,3,Sun Jul 5 05:18:51 2015 UTC,"No, depending on the DB Super situation, it probably will. I was just clarifying."
Toonami,3c4513,ZaneMiddleten,2,Sun Jul 5 07:04:56 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, if Toonami gets a DB Super dub, DBZ Kai is going off the air. It would be a ratings super-hit."

Toonami,3c4513,Flynn58,1 point,Sun Jul 5 05:19:06 2015 UTC,What he said.
Toonami,3c4513,MS14JG-2,7,Sun Jul 5 01:10:35 2015 UTC,"Outlaw Star. It was pretty butchered when it aired on 2001 Toonami but my brother loved the show. I'd like a way to see it uncut so I know what I've been missing. Studio Ghibli movies, even ones not made by Miayzaki, haven't aired on American television in over six years (would be ten if Turner Classic Movies didn't show Spirited Away for Oscar Winners Month in '09). Even if we got Tales from Earthsea, it'd be something. Though I understand how expensive the rights would be so that's a pipe dream. Hellsing. Hellsing Ultimate X got me curious.   There's also two new shows apparently coming: Akame ga Kill! and Parasyte.  I don't know a lot of anime guys."
Toonami,3c4513,jelatinman,2,Sat Jul 4 17:58:42 2015 UTC,So I'm going to be the guy that just stomps on your dream for number 2. Ghibli distribution rights are own by Disney and the only reason we got month of Miayzaki back in the day was Ted Tuner got the right to some how to play them on all tuner channels so Toonami use that to their advantage.
Toonami,3c4513,killatubby,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:13:16 2015 UTC,I do remember the promotion Disney Channel did for Ponyo and may have aired it once or twice but I haven't really seen any Ghibli on TV (presumably due to their hatred of cutting films).
Toonami,3c4513,jelatinman,2,Sat Jul 4 20:57:26 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure Ghibli's no cuts policy is still in affect.
Toonami,3c4513,killatubby,1 point,Sat Jul 4 21:09:16 2015 UTC,I've never seen any Ghibli air on Disney Channel at all. It seems like such a waste.

It uses the imagery of ""graduation"" to symbolise the move from one era to another as the characters leave Honnouji for good."

Toonami,3c0wsv,WalterOzymandias,3,Fri Jul 3 21:10:20 2015 UTC,"It's pretty much Attack on Titan in space, but better. I watched about half of the first season, so  I'm not sure how the rest of the season fares, but what I saw was great. The only thing I wasn't too much of a fan of was the art style, but the world building is great as tubby said, and it has much better pacing than Titan. I'd say it's probably worth your time."
Toonami,3c0wsv,anteater97,2,Sat Jul 4 00:50:15 2015 UTC,"I'll be honest I'm watching because it got Mechs, Johnny Yong Bosch and for the 3D art style. The basic plot with no spoiler Earth got fucked again as per usual and now the last space ship colony in space the Sidonia is constantly at war with the alien thing that fucked the earth. The show really good at world building also."

Toonami,3bzzla,Lucienofthelight,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:16:42 2015 UTC,I made a list of all of the video games I have but haven't beaten to remind myself why I'm not buying any right now (list seen here) Problem is now I can't decide what games to play. Any recommendations from you guys?
Toonami,3bzzla,dan96kid,2,Fri Jul 3 18:16:20 2015 UTC,"Naturally this is my opinion, as such it is entirely subjective, so don't take me too seriously:   *The Batman games are great, some of the best Batman stuff to have ever existed outside of the comics, I recommend focusing on it;   *Fallout 3 is pretty relevant, considering that FO4 was recently announced, but keep in mind that this is a Bethesda game, it can be very time consuming;  *Little Big Planet 2, Saints Row 3 and Mario Kart 8 are more fun with friends, keep that in mind;  *A remake of Final Fantasy 7 was announced, perhaps you would be more interested in playing that instead of the original?  *If you are going to play Mass Effect and Dragon Age, then it would be interesting to play the KoTOR games first, as they are sort of a spiritual predecessor to those series;  *Speaking of Star Wars, Republic Commando is great, it isn't very long, and it's kinda similar to Halo in some ways, so I think you would like that;  *The Force Unleashed is fun, second one isn't as good as the original;  *Unless you're very into classic Doom, you're probably not going to like Dark Forces, it's pretty outdated;  *Final Fantasy 13 and Red Dead Redemption are also fun, but, once again, very time consuming;  *Personally I would save Dead Space for Halloween, just for fun;  *Unless you have friends to play with, Dead Island is going to get boring.  That's what I think, not so much of a list of recommendations, just some pointers."

Toonami,3bvznr,NaturalThe1,21,Thu Jul 2 16:34:37 2015 UTC,"Guys... guys... This show is fucking awesome. It's brilliant. I love it to death and I can't wait to watch it again. I know the premise looks campy/stupid on the surface, but the show takes itself very seriously and tackles some deep themes in a very objective way. Plus there's a lot of violence, which is always a good thing ^_^"

Toonami,3bvznr,Atomos128,2,Fri Jul 3 04:20:42 2015 UTC,Sentai said at AX that it'll air in October. So it'll most likely replace SAO 2
Toonami,3bvznr,hs94,7,Fri Jul 3 04:43:42 2015 UTC,"Wow. Sentai is on a roll this year with Toonami. From 0 shows to 2, and they haven't even aired yet.  Sidenote: if this replaces SAO 2, it'll be kinda funny, since this'll be the 2nd Aniplex show to be replaced by a Sentai show (but also kinda sad, since Kill la Kill >>> Akame ga Kill)."
Toonami,3bvznr,hs94,6,Thu Jul 2 16:48:35 2015 UTC,Watched some clips of this show a few months ago and I think it definitely fits in the block. Loving how Toonami is already establishing a good relationship with its newest distributor.  Spoiler
Toonami,3bvznr,CMViper,5,Thu Jul 2 17:06:39 2015 UTC,"I hope Sentai improves their dubbing. Sometimes their work is ok, not as good as Funi or Bang Zoom, but decent enough. Then they do things like this. That kind of thing is ok if they're doing an obvious gag dub like Ghost Stories (same VO director, actually), but not when doing something serious.  If they botch it, well, the live thread should be fun."

Toonami,3bvznr,lftenjamin,2,Thu Jul 2 22:03:16 2015 UTC,"This is exciting! This show was suggested to me by crunchy roll and I usually hate commercials but this one actually looked promising so i binged the series and have eagerly waited to see when the dub released. Thank god toonami got the rights because I immediately knew they'd be a perfect fit. The only thing up in the air is quality, I hope they keep in the humor but incorporate it naturally so it sounds better to western audiences. I can see this show turning people on to anime."

Toonami,3bvznr,anarchycupcake,2,Fri Jul 3 06:02:22 2015 UTC,"you guys all say it's good, but it sounds like another Blue Exorcist to me. and i hated the way that shit turned out. ugh. as if the devil needs a lesson in love by a human. wtf. then again, japanese concept of the devil probably different than western concept of the lord of hell, lord of lies, master of all evil. pfft.   but man i hated the ending to blue exorcist. so fucking sappy and stupid"
Toonami,3bvznr,blargiman,3,Fri Jul 3 06:11:03 2015 UTC,It's not like Blue Exorcist at all.
Toonami,3bvznr,anarchycupcake,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:55:05 2015 UTC,that's good. i'm looking forward to it then. but the short summary of it definitely made it sound like another blue exorcist. :-/

Toonami,3bojb5,Ryan_Rigato,3,Tue Jun 30 22:36:04 2015 UTC,Sheesh. That drop from KLK to M&H. You think the new show would be the most popular out of them all. I guess the actions a certain family did in the first episode made some people stay away this time :/
Toonami,3bojb5,thepostaldud3,2,Wed Jul 1 03:25:54 2015 UTC,Eh it's just one weak week. If there was a month of these ratings I would worry a bit but this is fine
Toonami,3bojb5,Irongarden3,2,Tue Jun 30 22:23:46 2015 UTC,Looks like AS as a whole was down. I wouldn't worry unless we start seeing similar ratings for a few straight weeks.

Toonami,3bojb5,BlueLose,2,Wed Jul 1 02:10:47 2015 UTC,The story is good but the pacing is slow and it don't have that much action.If it had more action or faster pacing then I guess it'll get better ratings.I mean I like the early episodes of One Piece but after Skypiea I lost interest.If One Piece was on every night people would probably like it.
Toonami,3bojb5,Biniti123,2,Fri Jul 3 01:24:08 2015 UTC,I see what you mean it's not for everyone. It's just kinda infuriating when something you like is dragged through the mud by people and THE PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY MAKE THE SHOW! I love One Piece but yeah it is slow and I understand that but I'm one of the people who can tolerate that. It has really good action to me at least  (The manga has none of these problems mind you)

Toonami,3bojb5,Classic1990,2,Tue Jun 30 23:24:16 2015 UTC,I don't see Michiko and Hatchin pulling in great numbers every week. It seems really hit and miss in the anime community.
Toonami,3bojb5,Ryan_Rigato,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:15:44 2015 UTC,I think its going to be variable because the show is what 6 -7 years old now? I think age of the show is the most important factor (with dbz being the outlier that proves the rule)
Toonami,3bojb5,SonicGamer74,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:12:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I honestly thought that too.  The older a show is, the easier it is for people to just find the whole thing online, and watch it that way, instead of watching it on Toonami.  DBZ: Kai is different, in this regard, because of nostalgia, I'd suppose.  But I may be wrong."
Toonami,3bojb5,radiospringy,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:25:05 2015 UTC,It wasn't released stateside until 2013. A company licensed it and then squatted on it til they went out of business.
Toonami,3bojb5,Ryan_Rigato,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:13:41 2015 UTC,"Ya but I think what's important is when it was made. I think a similar reason can explain /part of/ the reason why One Piece is also not doing as well. Although the episodes are 2015 AMERICAN TELEVISION PREMERIES, they were made in 2007 which is forever ago even if they are in hd. Possible other reasons for OP not doing great are that it has a million episodes, Toonami started 200 episodes in (not that they had a choice and I agree with that decision because you can't expect something from the early aughts to do well in 2015, and maybe its comedy/art style/ whatever just does not relate to American audiences."
Toonami,3bojb5,radiospringy,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:15:52 2015 UTC,"One Piece is a totally different scenario than Michiko & Hatchin. They started it late, it's long, daunting and SLOOOOOOOW, and the art style isn't the most appealing. At least M&H is a 22 episode run."
Toonami,3bojb5,ClintonD85,1 point,Fri Jul 3 04:40:25 2015 UTC,"Its also a seinen, and, like Black Lagoon and other seinens, are bound to be popular with older, more experienced Toonami fans, but less popular with casual viewers.  I dunno if age is much of a factor. Its not noticeably older, the style is still unique and cool and its in HD. I guess the fact that some may have probably seen it before years ago may hurt it, though."

Toonami,3b7a99,ShiftyPlatypus,2,Fri Jun 26 17:05:14 2015 UTC,Toonami News that did not make the cut: Toonami Asia Picks up 'YO-KAI WATCH' http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/press-release/2015-06-25/toonami-picks-up-yo-kai-watch-in-asia/.89708
Toonami,3az0ot,John_7_2,4,Wed Jun 24 17:15:27 2015 UTC,Maybe. I have seen it and it starts out promising then falls flat in the middle but rebounds a bit during the end. The action in the show is pretty good so that help's the show's case for being on toonami. Overall it was pretty enjoyable but it also has a fair amount of issues to it.
Toonami,3az0ot,Irongarden3,2,Wed Jun 24 18:17:59 2015 UTC,"I agree. One thing to keep in mind is that a lot of shows on Toonami have issues with them: One Piece (pacing), Naruto (pacing, filler), SAO (ALO). However I do find Black Bullet to be riddled with more issues than these it is still an enjoyable 13 episode series that could be a fun short run for Toonami."
Toonami,3az0ot,Fenderz,3,Wed Jun 24 18:22:21 2015 UTC,They dont pick shows based on whether they have a issue in them tho
Toonami,3az0ot,bradsahm,1 point,Thu Jun 25 00:10:52 2015 UTC,"That is true. In case it wasn't clear in my previous comment, I was not complaining about these shows or the issues that they have. In fact I love quite a lot of these shows. I was just giving examples of shows that have ""issues"" to show that Black Bullet is not out of the running for a possible Toonami run."
Toonami,3az0ot,ChuckFinley97,3,Thu Jun 25 05:20:46 2015 UTC,"I watched it and I still don't know how I feel about it. Starts off really cool but goes WAY too fast through the first Arc. Gets kinda boring in the middle, then the end is pretty fun but the ending was like wut. That being said I would watch the dub."
Toonami,3az0ot,lftenjamin,3,Wed Jun 24 20:19:03 2015 UTC,"I don't quite see the same amount of issues as the other commenters. I would love to see this added to Toonami's collection, especially as something to say it had looking back a couple years from now.   The loli involvement (can we call them that?) was a bit odd but the gastraea fights were always interesting and fun. What I really think did it for me is the flip on its head it did with the ending."
Toonami,3az0ot,Stoick_the_Vast,2,Wed Jun 24 23:39:52 2015 UTC,"This show wasn't all that good. Plus the way it sequel bates the ending even though there probably won't be one, kinda sucks from an airing standpoint."
Toonami,3az0ot,toast56,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:44:00 2015 UTC,When they say combo pack do they mean it'll be combo'd with the movies or what?
Toonami,3az0ot,TheFifthSource,2,Wed Jun 24 19:35:19 2015 UTC,It means it will include both the DVD and BluRay.
Toonami,3az0ot,anarchycupcake,1 point,Thu Jun 25 01:04:17 2015 UTC,i watched the first episode and then i dropped it. i wasnt into it

Toonami,3aesp6,WalterOzymandias,1 point,Fri Jun 19 22:01:33 2015 UTC,"What are some shows I should watch (anime or otherwise)?   I'll make three suggestions in different genres:  Sports - Hajime no Ippo - It's pretty fun if you've never seen it. It's about a boy named Ippo who discovers a love for boxing. There is a dub floating around, and it's enjoyable.   Action - Tiger and Bunny - 3 words - Corporate. Sponsored. Superheroes. Not to mention the English dub is so good that many Japanese fans like it, so it's a good casual show if you just wanna pay attention to the pretty pictures, instead of read the dialogue.   Slice of Life - YuYuShiki - General SoL shenanigans, but it's fun all the same."

Toonami,3aauqv,Irongarden3,2,Thu Jun 18 16:36:55 2015 UTC,"Pokemon was what got me into Gaming with Red Version all those years ago. Hell I still replay it from time to time and even have a surfing Pikachu on my Yellow version!  Well....I did until I tried the clone glitch and corrupted my save T_T  But man has Pokemon evolved since then, the games are all full 3D now, and the plots have gotten much more intricate. Though I think the games with the best plots thus far are the Colosseum games."

Before you know it, I'm collecting everything that has the Pokemon label on it.  Pokemon actually really helped me through grade school. It got me through my parents' divorce and the depression that followed.  Now here I am, 14 years later, still playing the games, still watching the show, and still collecting the cards. I don't see that changing anytime soon, either."

Toonami,3a3ifk,Irongarden3,2,Wed Jun 17 03:12:54 2015 UTC,Whoa Frictional added a lot more live action SOMA stuff to their youtube since the last time I checked.

Toonami,3a3ifk,thepostaldud3,2,Wed Jun 17 03:27:35 2015 UTC,"Well, that was a alright stream. Unless they have a surprise guest... I am tuning out."
Toonami,3a3ifk,BeardyMcBeardster,2,Wed Jun 17 03:30:29 2015 UTC,Getting my pitch fork.
Toonami,3a3ifk,thepostaldud3,1 point,Wed Jun 17 03:31:06 2015 UTC,"Also, HOW ABOUT THAT NINTENDO DIGITAL EVENT GUYS?  Holy shit has that exploded.  Even Iwata did some damage control today about it."
Toonami,3a3ifk,BeardyMcBeardster,1 point,Tue Jun 16 23:04:40 2015 UTC,Better than that Square Enix event. They better do better next year.
Toonami,3a3ifk,thepostaldud3,2,Tue Jun 16 23:41:13 2015 UTC,I would say square enix was better than Nintendo. At their worst square was just boring. Nintendo made me sad with the metroid and animal crossing game
Toonami,3a3ifk,BeardyMcBeardster,1 point,Tue Jun 16 23:48:15 2015 UTC,"I know I should be angry at the Metroid game... but in the end I know I'm getting it. It's not no Metroid Prime: Hunters, but hey, at least it's something. I wasn't expecting anything big from Animal Crossing.  SE did good with KH, but that was kind of it for me."
Toonami,3a3ifk,thepostaldud3,1 point,Tue Jun 16 23:50:53 2015 UTC,I was actually really excited for Nier 2 and they got my interested in the new star ocean. And the mankind divided stuff was great.  Nintendo just had star fox. It was cool but that was it for me. Would have been smarter to take out woolies world and put in the cool fatal frame trailer they had. Also I've been starting to dislike amiibo and the animal crossing game didn't help
Toonami,3a3ifk,BeardyMcBeardster,1 point,Tue Jun 16 23:54:49 2015 UTC,"I'll have to try out Nier when I get back from training. I had no idea that game existed. I might wait around for Star Ocean once I beat everything else. And of course, I forgot to mention Deus Ex in my last post. You're right, they did focus on some of the games too much (Star Fox deserved what it got, though). Like another post mentioned, they definitely could have dropped more news and trailers than what they had."
Toonami,3a3ifk,BeardyMcBeardster,1 point,Tue Jun 16 23:57:14 2015 UTC,"Nintendo's biggest issue is that they have spread themselves to thin and rely on just announcing a game at one event and then talking about it at a later event. Lots of companies do this but Nintendo has a lot more events so it is a lot more noticeable. As great as Star Fox was it was a game that people knew was being worked on. Same with Woolie's World, Xenoblade X, FE x SMT, and the new FE game. If this was just a direct it would be passable but with E3 they should have stepped up a bit"
Toonami,3a3ifk,GreyouTT,1 point,Wed Jun 17 00:01:35 2015 UTC,"True. If they didn't have that SSB leak then they definitely should have saved that content for E3. It wouldn't make it for them, but at least it's something else."
Toonami,3a3ifk,GreyouTT,1 point,Wed Jun 17 00:06:53 2015 UTC,Well there was Ryu and Roy speculation since the mewtwo update but yeah it would have helped them out a good bit. I think also having to follow Sony hurt them because even if they gave a perfectly good show it would have still fell like a step down
Toonami,3a3ifk,BeardyMcBeardster,1 point,Wed Jun 17 00:09:57 2015 UTC,Hopefully we see more Fallout 4! I couldn't get enough. Kinda sad though that i cannot get the game myself :C But pls fallout 4 pc footage.
Toonami,3a3ifk,GreyouTT,1 point,Tue Jun 16 23:28:31 2015 UTC,"As much as we've seen already, I'm setting myself to not expect anything else. I'm already excited to get the game. Shit, I fucked up and preordered the game already (even though I'm on a supposed preorder strike).    I'm just hoping they don't destroy the modding community by making it a Steamshop only mod support sort of restriction."
Toonami,3a3ifk,killatubby,1 point,Tue Jun 16 23:40:54 2015 UTC,"If i had the cash, i would pre-order it. Fallout is my favorite RPG of all time. I trust Bethesda to deliver.   With the terrible reaction to paid mods for Skyrim, i don't think we will see it pop up again with Fallout 4. That would be a extremely bad idea."
Toonami,3a3ifk,GreyouTT,1 point,Tue Jun 16 23:43:25 2015 UTC,"I don't even know why I thought to mention such a horrible idea... however they did deliver paid mods for a couple days, so it's not like they don't make bad ideas. The odds of it happening are pretty slim. ... but it could happen. D:    You're probably fine without preordering it, but I was just too stoked not to."
Toonami,3a3ifk,GreyouTT,1 point,Tue Jun 16 23:46:49 2015 UTC,"If i don't end up getting it day one, the internet will spoil everything. So i am trying to find a way to get the game without having to lose too much. I don't have a income and i am waiting for disability to come through though that's gonna be a year or so.  I tried to dodge spoilers for skyrim and was fine for 4 days. D:"

Toonami,3a223y,anteater97,2,Tue Jun 16 18:10:01 2015 UTC,"Looks alright. Not very stealthy, but fun nonetheless."

Toonami,3a223y,Irongarden3,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:56:43 2015 UTC,I'll definitely get into playing them before KH3 is out. That'll give me a lot of time to wait for the PS3's to go cheaper.
Toonami,3a223y,GreyouTT,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:57:53 2015 UTC,I thought world of final fantasy was just a joke to lead into the FF7 remake
Toonami,3a223y,Irongarden3,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:46:46 2015 UTC,So can he have Sabin as a superboss in KH3 where if you try to use the train attack he will just suplex it?

Toonami,3a223y,GreyouTT,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:52:00 2015 UTC,So the trailer of KH3 only made the already convoluted and confusing plot even more confusing. But who actually plays kingdom hearts for the plot?
Toonami,3a223y,BeardyMcBeardster,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:53:04 2015 UTC,.........
Toonami,3a223y,Irongarden3,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:55:27 2015 UTC,Due to Disney owning Star Wars and Marvel the main director has said there will be more KH and he's down squeezing those IP in.
Toonami,3a223y,Desril,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:55:53 2015 UTC,What? That made perfect sense to me since I played all the games. What confused you?
Toonami,3a223y,Irongarden3,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:07:50 2015 UTC,What actually is kingdom hearts?
Toonami,3a223y,Irongarden3,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:10:48 2015 UTC,That was pretty much left vague until Birth by Sleep gave us the Xehanort Reports. I suggest you read those cause they pretty much blow the plot wide open.
Toonami,3a223y,BeardyMcBeardster,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:13:30 2015 UTC,then what was the actual plan of xehanort in the 3ds game? Get 13 of myself and be evil?
Toonami,3a223y,BeardyMcBeardster,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:16:43 2015 UTC,Get 13 darknesses to go up against 7 lights and forge the X-Blade and open Kingdom Hearts.   And he decided to have the 13 be 13 people with pieces of his heart implanted into them yes. Sora was gonna be the final darkness but the rest of the team saved him.
Toonami,3a223y,Irongarden3,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:20:29 2015 UTC,Do you realize just how silly that is to read? I like the games but the plot is just a really silly

It seems like Ubi cares more about a clean presentation with celebrity promotions and developers scripted speeches on the game than bringing in people who love the games they show actually play it.  No rehearsal, no speeches, just get up there, play it, and love it.  I think it's because of me watching the Nintendo World Championships last night, showing off Mario Maker and how much fun that was compared to this.  One of many things I wish E3 conferences could fix."

I like the premise so far, and I can't wait for tonight's episode. ^"

Toonami,39wuw1,jrgolden42,1 point,Mon Jun 15 16:23:53 2015 UTC,"Bakemonogatari's in-character commentaries. They're scripted by the author of the light novels, and they're really fun assuming you like the series for its banter.   The Commentary Hosts for Bakemonogatari are: Vol 1: Hanekawa and Senjougahara Vol 2: Hanekawa and Hachikuji Vol 3: Senjougahara and Kanbaru Vol 4: Oshino and Sengoku Vol 5 Ep 1: Hanekawa and Sengoku Vol 5 Ep 2: Hanekawa and Senjougahara Vol 5 Ep 3: Hanekawa and Hachikuji Vol 5 Ep 4: Hanekawa and Kanbaru Vol 5 Ep 5: Hanekawa and Araragi  Sadly, Bakemonogatari is the only part of the series that had their tracks officially translated (Aniplex can go fuck themselves), and there's only fansubs of Nisemonogatari's first two episodes, and the first episode of Koimonogatari.  Nobody's really taken up the project because it is a monstrous endeavor - and it requires a lot of cultural awareness - also likely why aniplex dropped it from later releases, it's an awful lot of work for something very few people care about... But when those very few people are paying $150 for a handful of disks, they really should have included them."
Toonami,39wuw1,Error400BadRequest,1 point,Mon Jun 15 17:28:21 2015 UTC,Who would actually pay $150 for only a few episodes!? They would have to be insane
Toonami,39wuw1,Error400BadRequest,1 point,Mon Jun 15 17:34:57 2015 UTC,"Well, Bakemonogatari and Nisemonogatari are $150 for 15 and 11 episodes respectively, which is reasonable... by Aniplex standards, anyway considering TTGL was $600 on BluRay.   But many of the Monogatari SS arcs are $100 for 4-5 episodes tops, and you're pretty much just getting the episodes (subtitled only), and a few postcards or other miscellaneous ""extras"" in the box that are worth absolutely nothing. It's Japan-tier pricing, which doesn't fly in the US as consumers are not used to it (and the average income of the average fan isn't conductive to this sort of market).   There's a reason why most of /a/ tells people that if you really want to support your favorite shows, just download them as normal and import one volume or just buy some other merchandise from it."

I have 4 more episodes of Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood, so I'm appropriately hyped as fuck. I'll probably get around to them after E3, then start watching Soul Eater.   Other than that, I've been watching 30 Rock off and on with my brother, catching up on Wayward Pines, and trying Golan the Insatiable. The latter one is pretty good, but really uneven. I haven't seen last night's episode, but the last two were chuckle-worthy, but nothing special."

Plus Pokemon XY, Dragon Ball (started the Red Ribbon Army arc last night), and original Naruto (I'm at episode 126, whatever arc that's in). And Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan (they introduced one of the key plot points pretty late into the season). And I Can't Understand What My Husband Is Saying! Season 2 (very fun ride for how short it is).  I have rules about progressing in Naruto and Dragon Ball, though, to make them feel less daunting. I watch an episode of each after finishing each daily batch of weeklies from currently running manga and anime series I'm following. I bundle Toonami into one batch since they all air within 5 hours of each other. Pokemon XY is a batch of its own since it's the only thing that airs Saturday mornings that I bother to watch. I also tack on an episode of each if I get caught up with a currently airing series that I was completely behind on, and, similarly, I tack on an episode of each for each series I complete (going by MAL's series stats).  Despite the rules I have, I do enjoy both of them. The rules are mostly just there to make sure I'm actually progressing to complete the two series, which is something I want to do to fill/refill my knowledge gaps about the universes of each series."

Anyways, my internet was out this morning, so that's why I wasn't hanging with you guys during Microsoft's thing. I still watched it live, though (thank god for Spike), and I really liked it. It wasn't as hype as Bethesda's, but it showed off some pretty cool stuff.  Best thing announced for me was backward compatibility, which has pretty much sold me on an Xbox One. Fallout 4 mods, Hololens, and Recore looked pretty nice as well, although I don't know how they'll do the former as most Bethesda mods are ""make everything not look like shit"". Biggest duds were Halo 5, Gears 4, and Tomb Raider. They didn't look BAD, perse, but they just weren't particularly shocking or revolutionary.   As for EA, I'm super hyped for Mirror's Edge and Battlefront. Really excited to experience this with you guys!"

Son, we live in a world that has walls, and those walls have to be guarded by men with guns. Who's gonna do it? You? You, Lt. Weinburg? I have a greater responsibility than you could possibly fathom. You weep for Santiago, and you curse the Marines. You have that luxury. You have the luxury of not knowing what I know. That Santiago's death, while tragic, probably saved lives. And my existence, while grotesque and incomprehensible to you, saves lives. You don't want the truth because deep down in places you don't talk about at parties, you want me on that wall, you need me on that wall. We use words like honor, code, loyalty. We use these words as the backbone of a life spent defending something. You use them as a punchline. I have neither the time nor the inclination to explain myself to a man who rises and sleeps under the blanket of the very freedom that I provide, and then questions the manner in which I provide it. I would rather you just said thank you, and went on your way, Otherwise, I suggest you pick up a weapon, and stand a post. Either way, I don't give a damn what you think you are entitled to."

Toonami,39re75,itspinkynukka,3,Thu Jun 18 09:02:19 2015 UTC,Lupin the 3rd or shut it all down!
Toonami,39re75,shadycrop,9,Sun Jun 14 09:01:03 2015 UTC,"Time for Error's Unpopular opinions.   DBZ Super isn't a thing yet - it could be shit.  Sailor Moon Crystal was terrible.   JoJo - I'd be on board with this because it's fun, but I don't know how it would do.   Hunter X Hunter - didn't this anime get cancelled? That seems like it'd be a bad move.  Fairy Tail - the anime is/was bad. The manga is much more easily digestible, but even it's not particularly great."
Toonami,39re75,Error400BadRequest,3,Sun Jun 14 02:24:50 2015 UTC,Hunter didn't get cancelled. The anime ended as far as the manga has gone save a few chapters. The manga is in permanent hiatus and the anime ended with the last finished manga arc. The only problem is that it isn't dubbed and is looking like it won't be.
Toonami,39re75,ZaneMiddleten,-4,Sun Jun 14 03:35:43 2015 UTC,"The manga is in permanent hiatus   That's honestly even worse.  I've heard it casually referred to as Hiatus x Hiatus, so I never bothered to pick it up (same with Berserk), I just assumed it was on an irregular release schedule.   I'd refrain until it's complete."
Toonami,39re75,Error400BadRequest,6,Sun Jun 14 03:42:19 2015 UTC,"If you wait for Hunter X Hunter to finish you're going to be waiting for 20 years. Honestly you should watch HXH, it's freaking great and they do find a great spot to end it."

Toonami,39re75,rmm45177,3,Sun Jun 14 03:29:47 2015 UTC,The only ones I agree with are DBZ super (which is worrisome right now) and Jojo. The others are either terrible or won't be dubbed.
Toonami,39re75,2th,5,Sun Jun 14 03:49:45 2015 UTC,Gundam has fallen off again  All those fucking long runners  FAIRY TAIL   You disappoint me Toonami Faithful.
Toonami,39re75,panderson1988,4,Sun Jun 14 00:41:45 2015 UTC,"Only Hunter x Hunter would be decent. We know nothing about DBZ Super, Sailor Moon was mediocre at absolute best. Jojo could be fun but I am not sure about the audience liking it. Fairy Tail is just so damn generic. It isnt particular good, but it isnt horrible either. It just  is. I wouldn't waste the money on something that will not get ratings."
Toonami,39re75,anarchycupcake,2,Sun Jun 14 03:54:09 2015 UTC,"The problem is some of these shows are old, and beyond the faithful, then the chances of them doing well is unlikely. I get nostalgia at times for old shows, but it's short lived. Also most of us know what is going to happen, and people will be less incline to tune in. I think pursuing mostly new shows is a better idea."
Toonami,39re75,Questioning_Account,2,Sun Jun 14 05:14:08 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't want any of these shows on Toonami really. Many are already long series or look like they're going to be long series, which would hog precious airtime. Many are mediocre. Jojo is too polarizing to really do well and for viewers to get a real understanding of the plot, they'd have to air the older editions of the series. I mean, DBZ Super hasn't even aired yet. These all seem like bad ideas to be honest; they really need to focus on acquiring new, short to mid-length series (25 or 26 episodes max) that are fairly well liked and received general critical praise to acquire a wider audience."
Toonami,39re75,BlueLose,2,Sun Jun 14 16:27:11 2015 UTC,The only one on there that's awesome is Jojo. Hunter x Hunter is ok.  That's an objective fact and definitely not an opinion.

Toonami,391in6,GreyouTT,2,Mon Jun 8 15:56:45 2015 UTC,One thing I continually don't understand is the hate that Halo 4 receives. I enjoyed the more story-oriented approach to the game and felt that overall it was  great. Am I missing something?
Toonami,391in6,Error400BadRequest,2,Mon Jun 8 18:00:47 2015 UTC,"I believe the hate is more for the multiplayer than the story itself. Although personally I think the final boss could have been handled better. I mean the halo games haven't had the best final bosses, but at least we had actual fights in the other games.   Another gripe I have is the fact that the enemy you face for most of the game can TELEPORT. I mean, if they just had THAT innate ability then it would be fine. But they have RECHARGEABLE SHIELDS to go along with that, which makes for a very aggravating enemy to deal with."
Toonami,391in6,GreyouTT,1 point,Mon Jun 8 18:05:16 2015 UTC,"but at least we had actual fights in the other games.    Halo 1 didn't have a final boss.  It had The Maw, a really fun driving level, with Halo 3's final level its spiritual successor."

Toonami,391in6,Mo145678,2,Tue Jun 9 02:14:21 2015 UTC,"I enjoyed the more story-oriented approach to the game and felt that overall it was great. Am I missing something?   If you want a really story-driven Halo, ODST was the best there was.   I actually played a bit of Halo 4 because my brother bought it. The multiplayer was definitely weaker than previous installations. It felt slow, and more like a tactical shooter, and it wasn't what I wanted to see from a Halo title. 343 simply isn't fit to carry to the series.   Halo 4 introduced customizable loadouts. That's a big deal - you could pick the gun you spawned with. That's cool, it makes it more like Call of Duty, right? WRONG.  Halo, at it's core, was heavily based on the Arena shooter genre.   You spawn with 2 guns - an assault rifle, and the pistol (which was arguably the best mid-range weapon in Halo CE). You spawned with weapons that could take on anything - they could be universally used, switching to an alternative weapon was a tradeoff, and there's no guarantee you'd win.   This changed in later installations in the series. Your starting weapons were almost always terrible, not the worst, but nowhere near the best options? Your pistol? Swap it for a Battle Rifle/DMR. Assault Rifle? Ditch that for a shotgun. The balance was gone.   Halo moved away from what made it great - (Halo CE would be regarded as the best title in the series if it wasn't for the lack of Xbox Live, that's why more people favor Halo 2).  I also don't think 343 should have continued Master Chief's story. I think it would have been better off doing something from scratch instead of pulling a ""but wait, there's more!"" but that's an argument for another day. I think they should've left Master Chief where Bungie did."
Toonami,391in6,GreyouTT,3,Mon Jun 8 23:25:36 2015 UTC,"When I meant story-oriented, I meant delving more into the lore of the Halo universe. (I'm one of the very few people who actually bothers to read the books.)"

Toonami,38zyi1,SonicGamer74,2,Mon Jun 8 17:36:28 2015 UTC,durarara x2 won't even be done in japan by september
Toonami,38zyi1,spacklez,3,Mon Jun 8 17:42:08 2015 UTC,"DRRRx2 has a broadcast dub ready to go. AZ has a finalized dub ready to go.  Space Dandy was a Toonami-before-Japan premiere.  Code Geass didn't have a completed dub and R2 aired on AS only weeks after it finished in Japan. Heck, certain eps were delayed because the dub wasn't finished in time.  Your argument needs work since airing in Japan has never stopped AS/Toonami."
Toonami,38zyi1,radiospringy,5,Mon Jun 8 17:47:23 2015 UTC,FMA: Brotherhood was still going when AS started airing it in early 2010.
Toonami,38zyi1,spacklez,3,Mon Jun 8 21:27:34 2015 UTC,"If they start in September they would catch up to the current schedule of the simuldub (and possibly even the Japanese broadcast but I'm too lazy to work that out) before the show even finishes. They are being really weird with x2: ""It continues after the first television series Durarara!! and will air in three different cours, or quarters of a year. Each cour is subtitled Shō (承?, lit. ""understanding""), Ten (転?, lit. ""motion""), and Ketsu (結?, lit. ""conclusion"") respectively. The first cour began in January, 2015, the second cour is scheduled for July 2015 and the third cour is scheduled for January 2016."" For Sho the simuldub was additionally a couple months behind Japan (it just finished like two weeks ago).  And I love Durarara but if you'd been watching that simuldub you'd know it's kind of a clusterfuck right now. Not only is this new animation studio routinely falling behind schedule and just leaving in blatantly unfinished scenes for the Japanese TV and streaming versions, the dubbing itself isn't super great and Aniplex has said this is because they're just hammering it out as quick as possible to have a new episode each week and will redo some of the lines for the physical release (there are lines they clearly didn't even try to lip sync and in addition to that some scenes don't have the mouth flaps animated yet anyway so those will need to be redone as well). They haven't even changed the names in the opening from Japanese to English yet.  The simuldub of this show is an interesting experiment to be sure, but this show is not at all in a form that is ready for American TV yet."

Toonami,38yfyq,kevoc2008,1 point,Sun Jun 7 22:56:49 2015 UTC,"From a technical standpoint, saying 60FPS means nothing or worse than usual in video (NOTE AGAIN IN VIDEO). Saying 60 fps output is more of a gimmik word than a real standard for video.   99% of the time, Anime runs at a streaming frame rate of 24fps. 24fps is the standard that films used since the beginning of film, and still is the standard for film (the only exception is the hobbit which uses 48 fps = 2 * 24fps, and yet people complain of the weirdness).   Also Note: Since you are saying 60 fps on a video when the source material is 24 fps, you are just falsely upconverting it. When you upconvert the frame rate of the video, you are just throwing extra frames that are just filled in; and I know since the source material is 24fps from streaming and blu-ray.   When you use 60FPS, you have more of a plastic soap opera feeling than 24fps. With 24 fps, you retain that natural motion blur that a human eye usually sees, everything as static frames and loose that natural motion blur. Typically, in movie like videos, you want to retain motion blur in videos to emphasise motion or action.   If you ask any experienced videographer or filmmaker, and they will always say 24fps over 60 fps or 120fps, etc.   I do video as a hobby and I exclusively do 24 fps even though my equipment can do 60 fps with no problem.   The only time you would want to use 60fps is if you want to slow the video down in post 1.5 times slower for those slow-mo video, and video gaming since it is already have that plastic feeling and you need that immersed feeling.

As long as a user is not just throwing out spoilers to be a arse and he puts them in the correct format we will allow them.

Toonami,38pl4a,MS14JG-2,2,Fri Jun 5 23:39:01 2015 UTC,"It's because Bandai Entertainment had to bow to the will of their Japanese Overlords who didn't understand how to listen to their advisers and work with the US Market. They're gone now and because of that, there's only the recent return for the Franchise under RightStuf's management that is slowly working its way back into being a reasonable to afford DVD release.   There's a reason they went belly up mere months before Toonami returned to the American Anime scene and breathed some new life into the scene.   Bandai's scared of losing their home front to their foreign front.   See the scene in Japan for Anime is a very sick and twisted one, do you know how much it costs to get Gundam Wing or Gundam 0079 on Blu-Ray?  About 600$. I'm not even fucking kidding. The reason the Gurren Lagann Blu-Rays cost an Arm and a Leg even here in the States? Same fucking reason.  Because the concept of lowering the prices for even basic DVD's in the states terrifies the Jap Execs else the Otaku they milk the wallets of Reverse Import their shows.

They just look like those shitty animated Esurance commercials, and it's just so gross looking. Still love the game to death, and I'm hyped as hell for the sequel.  Good video though! A lot of the ones I see aren't particularly remarkable, but yours are always well done."
Toonami,3847bq,anteater97,1 point,Tue Jun 2 01:42:47 2015 UTC,"Oh wow you're right they do look like those Esurance commercials I didn't even think about that lol. I was originally gonna make the intro off of those cutscenes but while editing I realized it wasn't gonna work.  I'm excited for mirrors edge 2,  with the right improvements it can be a phenomenal game. Thank you for the feedback I really appreciate it."
Toonami,382z3g,Irongarden3,3,Mon Jun 1 14:04:15 2015 UTC,On the last season of Sons of Anarchy. Its a bit of a struggle at this point.  And Gundam Seed Destiny. Which is also a struggle.   Basically I've been playing a lot of Splatoon and Monster Hunter instead of watching TV lately

Thinking about starting Steins;Gate cause the premise sounds interesting.  Far as regular TV goes, I should REALLY finish watching Daredevil already.

It's been a while since I finished the first one and I've forgotten about a few key details so I'll probably be rewatching the original.   It's an enjoyable series with a good dub that I could certainly see on Toonami some day. [fingers crossed]

A.D.: The Bible Continues on NBC is another.  I watched the original Bible series on the History Channel, a few years back, so I tried the sequel.  It's actually really good; regardless if you're Christian or not.  Re-Watched RWBY Volume 2, like I said I would in the last post.  It was better than I remembered it being, though watching all the episodes as a movie (as I had a Bluray/DVD release that allows that feature) definitely helped that.  Planning on starting The Whispers on ABC tonight; the premise of that show intrigues me very much.  Didn't make any progress on any of the other shows from my last one (to recap, they were Bebop, Madoka, Steven Universe, and Star VS. The Forces of Evil), except for Sonic Boom, but that's because it's currently on a hiatus until like, September I think. lol"

Toonami,384r3p,Ryan_Rigato,2,Mon Jun 1 22:37:42 2015 UTC,"wow really. I loved the OVAs, they made me cry. They really drove home that 'life if pointless no matter what you do you are going to cause someone pain no matter your intentions' storyline. They just really spoke to me sometimes I love that whole dark/depressing stuff. I also thought the ovas were a more realistic of what a revolution is like (ie everybody stabbing everybody in the back)"
Toonami,384r3p,nmaster12,3,Tue Jun 2 02:48:52 2015 UTC,"The first two definitely were realistic, and I think they had to paint kenshin as a cold killer to fit the OVA atmosphere.

However there have many show with very little action shows, like Space Dandy, and Tenchi Muyo! GXP. the former being on the most popular shows on Toonami and the ladder having ratting so bad it had to move back in the night. Jason Demarco has stated the one of the rules of the current Toonami is that a show has to have at least some action to even be considered."
Toonami,3811p1,LibraryNerdOne,7,Mon Jun 1 02:09:25 2015 UTC,Space Dandy was so good. The zombie episode traumatized me.

Toonami,3811p1,anteater97,3,Mon Jun 1 19:19:50 2015 UTC,"Well, considering Toonami's theme is action and general ass kicking, probably not too well.  Considering the fairly limited time slot and Toonami's mainly adult demographic, it probably wouldn't get much love from anyone besides hardcore fans.   That said, I'm sure I (as well as others) would be open to the idea if there's enough demand and the show is decent. I'm fairly new to the anime genre, and am pretty uninterested in non-action anime (as of now)  but I trust the crew to pick good shows."
Toonami,3811p1,radiospringy,2,Mon Jun 1 03:04:22 2015 UTC,"Non-violent action shows can and have done well, but having a non-action series on the block defeats the whole purpose of Toonami."
Toonami,3811p1,Ryan_Rigato,2,Mon Jun 1 03:16:58 2015 UTC,Having a 'not an action show' on an action block defeats the purpose of a having an action block on toonami.

I was surprised at the negative reception it and Nintendo Land got around launch. Playing with friends, it was genuinely the most fun I had in a long time.   I don't wanna sound like grandpa or anything, but perhaps its just the industry is changing, and games ""for kids"" just aren't in style anymore.   The Wii U isn't my only platform as I've also got a solid PC (and a lot of other stuff, but nothing current gen), but my fondest memories usually involve playing Nintendo games with my friends. I feel like kids today are missing out on that kind of lighthearted fun. Its a different experience."

This is believed to have resulted in a series that is distinguishable from its counterparts.   EDIT: I also don't see anywhere that says MacFarlane has had any less involvement with FG.

I remember when they first announced that they were working on a movie, I think that was 7 years ago(?), it sounded like they were going to do something based on WoW, and I wasn't really feeling it, WoW has such a loose continuity and there's just so much to it already, there was no way they could pull it off.   I'm glad they decided to do the sensible thing and base it around the first war."

Toonami,36vt0m,Nihillo,2,Fri May 22 16:57:57 2015 UTC,I just hope that the splatoon ones will be well stocked. when they come out
Toonami,36vt0m,triffc_tinika,2,Fri May 22 22:17:21 2015 UTC,From what I've seen on /r/amiibo they will be uncommon on launch. It looks like most places are getting equal numbers of both of the Inklings and the three pack.  I managed to get all of them on preorder except for Silver Mario and Greninja thankfully

The show is open to anyone with a badge for the weekend but it's first-come-first-serve occupancy so not sure If I'll get in or not since I'm not waiting in line right now 5 hours before it starts. Either way - the gunpla is due at 11am tomorrow for the model kit competition! Wish me luck!!
Toonami,36vt0m,ClintonD85,2,Fri May 22 19:15:37 2015 UTC,I'm going to a Comic Con tomorrow too! How do model kit competitions... work? What makes a good gunpla seems very subjective.
Toonami,36vt0m,Nihillo,2,Fri May 22 21:43:05 2015 UTC,There's a few different points of detail that get inspected generally.  Nub removal. Panel lining. Painting/type of top coat.  All this in addition to customizations and display/posing/etc.  I'm not entirely sure what they will be judging on but the competition is open to all plamo and not just gunpla!  Which Comic Con are you going to? I'm in Denver!
Toonami,36vt0m,ClintonD85,2,Fri May 22 21:55:57 2015 UTC,"Here in Puerto Rico we only have the one yearly convention, but it's an official Comic Con so it's actually a big event. Last year Steve Blum was here, but I wasn't able to go -.-"
Toonami,36vt0m,SonicGamer74,3,Fri May 22 22:02:48 2015 UTC,"Lazy(ish) Friday, I guess.  Summer classes are all online so I can do them whenever I feel like.  Right now I'm actually cleaning up my workspace a bit and hooking up my printer (I spent like 2 hours trying to find the proprietary power cable for my HP printer...)  I'm allowed to scan work and turn it in rather than typing it out in Word or LaTex, so I'm definitely gonna do that."
Toonami,36vt0m,FEMINISTS,3,Fri May 22 20:06:56 2015 UTC,"I posted this to /r/anime, but no one seemed to care. While I was driving in my car I heard a very familiar tune on the radio that left me puzzled and after googling the lyrics I found out it was the One Direction song ""No Control"". The weird part was that I was pretty sure I'd heard that tune before, but that was literally the first time I'd heard that song. I didn't really care enough to keep digging further so I just chalked it up to me being crazy or something. Randomly yesterday, I saw a Bleach episode that instantly dragged that memory out and then the similarities were too much for me to ignore.  Here are the relevant parts of the songs:  https://youtu.be/6kxR1us1GbI?t=57s   https://youtu.be/pW7W8hbdhX8?t=38s   I dunno, to me it just sounds like a blatant rip-off but I'm sure there are plenty of reasonable explanations for the similarities... right?"

Figured using my own name won't be enough and  won't immediately strike a chord with people. Damn near everything I've come up with so far has already been taken. Trying to come up with something that has fantastical steampunk/art deco connotations with a hint of classiness.
Toonami,36vt0m,Fenderz,3,Fri May 22 18:30:37 2015 UTC,"It's generally best to leave the name for last. Either way, you should read up on something related to steampunk and or art deco, it will probably help you come up with something."

To me Superman is far too overpowered which is why I'm not a fan of his, with his race against the Flash being one of the main reasons why.  But I suppose something similar could be said about Batman, given that despite his lack of superpowers he's able to come out on top so often."

Also finished Love Live! S1 and Squid Girl S2 over the last couple weeks. Former was cheesy but a lot of fun, the latter was simply a lot of fun.  And I started A Certain Magical Index and Love Live! S2 this weekend. I know TouMAN will be fun, as I've read up to book 8 or book 9 in the novels. 2 episodes into that. Also just a single episode into Love Live! right now. The latter's S2 is just as cheesy as its S1, but still just as fun.  Also been slowly working through original Naruto since they dropped it on Toonami. Just crossed the halfway mark.  I Can't Understand What My Husband Is Saying! is my only currently airing watch from Japan, mostly because I never got started on the other Spring shows I wanted to watch because I wanted to narrow down my currently watching list.  I'm also watching Pokemon XY as well. Following the English dub due to ease of access.  And to top it all off, I'm doing a Dragon Ball re-watch/proper finish of the series (I never properly finished it) with some friends on another forum. We're at Episode 14."

Both are pretty good, with Todd Margaret being incredibly weird. And I'm still making my way through Futurama, although I haven't watched in a couple months."

Has stuff relating to greek gods, good old DnD, and the idea of Guilds and Groups that you'd see in an MMO. But all in a ""this is real life"" type of scenario (AKA meaning its better than SAO by a land slide for taking its shit seriously rather than making it all a literal game)  It's currently airing subbed on Cruncyroll, I would be beyond ecstatic if it made it to Toonami once it gets dubbed eventually."

Toonami,36d1q3,broadmat,1 point,Mon May 18 14:07:25 2015 UTC,"I've been slooowly going through Read or Die/Dream (""R.O.D. The TV""), an old anime that I watched 10 years ago, I have  forgotten about most of the plot, so it's almost like watching it for the first time.   R.O.D. is about three sisters who are capable of manipulating paper in a variety of ways, and who work as tourist guides/detectives/bodyguards/covertops commandos (quite the escalation), they end up being hired to protect a renowned foreign writer, but they blow through all of their money and end up having to live at her place (once again, quite the escalation).  It might sound exciting,  but the truth is that this show is mostly one of those slice of life types of anime, revolving around the relationship between the three sisters (and their annoyed protectee), it does have its share of awesome action scenes though. Naturally this means that R.O.D. relies heavily on its characters, so it is a good thing that they are all very likeable and realistically portrayed, even if the voice acting (I'm watching it dubbed) sounds a bit stilted sometimes.   It's a pretty chill and charming show punctuated by brief bursts of action. It also has a pretty snazzy opening that makes it look like a buddy cop show from the 80's."
Toonami,36d1q3,Nihillo,1 point,Mon May 18 16:05:40 2015 UTC,The OVA is substantially more action packed and is one of my favorites.

Toonami,36d1q3,Nihillo,1 point,Mon May 18 23:13:00 2015 UTC,"Fate UBW - Quality show with amazing animation. Story is mind blowing, too. It's almost over. I could definitely see this coming to toonami when the dub hits.  Ninja Slayer - like inferno cop part 2. Anime of the yeeart, mos def.  Danmachi - the epitome of average but it's fun.  Jojo's Bizarre Adventure: Stardust Crusaders - shits getting serious. Can't wait for season 1 dub."

Toonami,36d1q3,Ianjh,1 point,Thu May 21 10:01:50 2015 UTC,"Puella Magi Madoka Magica - Seems like a really nice series.  I'm 4 episodes in, and it's definitely a thrill ride.  The fact that it's shorter than most Anime makes it easy to get through as well. Cowboy Bebop - I missed this, when Toonami aired it, but I got the complete series on DVD a few months back.  Amazing series.  I can't think of an Anime that's better than it, so far.  Already halfway through, so shouldn't take long to finish. Sonic Boom - A decent show.  It's got some jokes I actually laugh at, and other times, it gets blatantly obvious it's for kids.  Nevertheless, it's a somewhat entertaining show.   Also started up Steven Universe, and Star VS. The Forces of Evil a week ago.  Only saw the first episode of both.  Steven Universe looks like a great series, so I'm in to finish it.  Star VS. The Forces of Evil, however, was kind of a mixed bag.  But I'd be lying if I said I didn't enjoy it.  Might also re-watch RWBY Volume 2 soon, since I have an urge to.  Edit: Added Star VS. The Forces of Evil, since I somehow forgot to include it. lol"

They're definitely falling into more graphic territory this season which isn't a bad thing, but I guess I'm just not exactly following the reasoning behind what's happening in the central plot.  The Lizzie Borden Chronicles- I really liked this at first, but now I'm getting kind of bored with it. She gets out of trouble too easily now."

Aquarion Evol is very good, and it seems like something AS would air. Giant robots, holes and merging. It is not as epic as Gurren Lagann but it is still very good. Steins;Gate is really, really good and I think it would be a good show for Toonami. It brings the feels and has a very good story.   I loved the first season of Last Exile, the second one is good, but I don't like as much as the first so far. It is still a very nice looking series.  Senran Kagura is OK, KLK is a much better girls losing clothes while fighting type show.   Noir is great for an old anime, maybe a bit slow pacing-wise compared to modern shows. Appleseed is a good story but the CG is dated and too often the characters fall into the uncanny valley, there is just something off-putting about the way the teeth look. I ended up really liking Fairy Tail, it is what I would have liked to have seen fill the void left by Bleach ending its run on AS."

Toonami,364bsg,SwizzleStyx,2,Sat May 16 20:42:51 2015 UTC,"Daft Punk is probably my favorite musical group of all time. Although I only got into them after TRON: Legacy, they were the first musicians I loved from the very beginning, and have been very influential on my life.  Out of all the albums they put out, RAM is probably my favorite. Although Discovery has an album full of classics, RAM has my two favorite songs by the group (Touch and Get Lucky are fucking masterpieces imo), as well as many memories attached to it (I remember the day that album came out very vividly, and frequently call it the best day of my teenage life thus far). Discovery is an obvious #2, with TRON, TRON Reconfigured, Homework, and HAA following after.  For whatever reason, I haven't even taken the time to watch Interstella 5555 (in order) or Electrorama. I'm thinking that might be my weekend plan, because I'm pretty sure both are on Youtube.   So yeah, Daft Punk is the fucking best. Although I never watched the Midnight Run (probably would've if I wasn't 3 at the time), they became a huge part of my life, and will probably continue to influence me into adulthood.  Also, if anyone has a tape of the Midnight Run, I'd like you to know I would pay damn good money for it."

Toonami,363o5j,Nihillo,2,Sat May 16 00:23:27 2015 UTC,And Rhinestone Eyes was supposed to follow that (there's some storyboard of a video that was never done).
Toonami,363o5j,Nihillo,2,Sat May 16 00:27:54 2015 UTC,"Always loved Gorillaz, the eponymous first album and Demon Days were impressive and fresh, they weren't just music albums, they were unique experiences with exciting highs and melancholic lows.   Plastic Beach was kinda ""ehh"", aside from Stylo, On Melancholy Hill, Some Kind of Nature and Rhinestone Eyes, there isn't much going for it in my opinion, there's a lot of experimental tracks that aren't very engaging one way or another. I gave The Fall a try some time ago and I felt the same way about it. It is unfortunate that the project faded into obscurity like this, but at least Gorillaz left its mark in pop culture with its ambitious and weird style."
Toonami,363o5j,CMViper,2,Fri May 15 22:14:36 2015 UTC,"Plastic Beach had an interesting concept, but it's tough to create a ""plastic"" sound and creating something authentic or original out of it, at least in the context of the Gorillaz execution of it.  You also mentioned 3 of my favorite tracks on PB, too (Stylo, Melancholy Hill, Rhinestone Eyes)."
Toonami,363o5j,Morbidmort,2,Fri May 15 23:16:10 2015 UTC,inb4 new Gorillaz album next year. I'm excited!

Toonami,363ijr,GreyouTT,5,Fri May 15 20:13:34 2015 UTC,"Link to this weeks Episodes.  We've hit what has to be the single most racist design in the series. Yes, I do mean that wholeheartedly.   ""Spike Gundam"" is one of the smartest name changes in the series, if you're doing as you should and watching the dub.  ""Spike""'s original name? TEQUILA Gundam.   TEQUILA. GUNDAM.  Let that sink in for a second.  My question is, what the fuck is its signature move? Spring Break party bender? Tequila Worm ball tripping, destitution? Hey it's G Gundam, we're allowed to make those jokes!  Anyway, G Gundam continues on its opening ten, we meet a few one offs, and a few recurring characters continue to show up, each of them continuing to have plot relevance to Domon's part of the story, and for at least Argo, get some backstory to themselves.   Next week though?  TIME FOR BEST CHARACTER!"

Toonami,3622wo,SonicGamer74,2,Fri May 15 21:52:23 2015 UTC,"Well, without going into actual spoilers, things will slow down before they pick up... briefly, and then the arc ends. They basically waste an episode and a half with exposition, where the main characters figure out how death gun does his thing and what they are going to do about it.   After that we have a completely inconsequential 3 episode arc, which I'm tempted to call filler.  As for the third arc... well, you probably won't believe what I'm about to say, but the third arc does not feature Kirito, and that's probably it's strongest point, we have actual, fallible main characters who have to struggle to achieve their goal. Some people claim that this is the point where the author actually started to get good (their words, not mine), personally I think it starts off too slow, but I can definitely see how it is an improvement over the rest. It is a shame that it will take us MONTHS to get to it.  But yeah, pacing is awful overall."

Toonami,3622wo,TRMeson,3,Fri May 15 16:33:49 2015 UTC,"I can't see why anyone might like SAO. The art style is nice (even though characters' faces look kinda funny), the OST for both series has been passable, but it doesn't know if it wants to be a harem ecchi show or an action-adventure shounen, and it's pretty bad at doing both. Kirito is one of the most inexcusably unrelatable main characters I've ever come across in anime.  This might be one of those situations where an anthology series might have been a better idea for SAO. Phase 1, Kirito is our main character while he is trapped in SAO. That way his storyline would be reigned in a bit and we could get some real closure and maybe, gasp, character development.  Phase 2, ALO. We ditch Kitty-Toe and use cousin-fucker as our main character, without the cousin-fucking storyline. Or we skip ALO altogether, no skin off my back.  Phase 3, GGO. Use Sinon. Obvious. She will be the skilled player hired by the govt to track down Death Gun. No Kitty-Toe=no shitty shoehorned weird pseudoromance subplot. We can flesh out the realities of her PTSD and show her becoming a better person through her experiences tracking down Death Gun."

I just got the recipe online and switched from Red Bull to blue raspberry/citrus-flavored Mountain Dew Voltage and switched from peach schnapps to berry fusion schnapps.  I just came up with it on the spot today, lol, though I have been thinking about something similar for a while. I might try it myself sometime...while watching Toonami, of course."
Toonami,35yor8,ClintonD85,6,Fri May 15 01:59:52 2015 UTC,Ill grab the Toonami drinking game from 4chan this week

Toonami,35yor8,SwizzleStyx,3,Fri May 15 01:12:42 2015 UTC,Toonami Non-Alcoholic Drinking Game (because no human could survive WITH alcohol)   Probably important to note before some one jumps the gun.
Toonami,35yor8,ShiftyPlatypus,2,Fri May 15 04:42:23 2015 UTC,Oh it can be done. I'll have old faithful sour mash jack on my side
Toonami,35yor8,SwizzleStyx,2,Fri May 15 07:12:06 2015 UTC,"Occasionally and it's usually red wine that my roommate gets on the weekends. Rarely do I break into my own stash of whiskey and sake. Every now and then I'll get a six pack of Fat Tire and have a few on Saturday.  Craft beers like Holy Grail Ale will surprise the hell out of you. I live in Colorado and the Breckenridge Brewery company makes a new brew each year with a crazy name like ""Caped Brewsader"" for Denver Comic Con and it's always really good and usually sells out midway through Saturday of the con."
Toonami,35yor8,SOLIDninja,2,Thu May 14 18:10:19 2015 UTC,I did for a bit until my blood pressure started to spike and I realized it was just fueling my alcoholism. Mainly bourbon and coke or wine.
Toonami,35yor8,rmm45177,2,Thu May 14 18:36:13 2015 UTC,came here for the title stayed waiting for someone to make a one piece reference
Toonami,35yor8,Ryan_Rigato,2,Thu May 14 19:17:09 2015 UTC,I usually go out on Saturday nights...so when I'm watching Toonami it's typically after I've stumbled in the door pretty drunk already.
Toonami,35yor8,CoolCalmJosh,2,Fri May 15 06:04:37 2015 UTC,Hey doesn't mean you can't have a crisp beer and a kind joint to end the night with toonami
Toonami,35yor8,SwizzleStyx,1 point,Fri May 15 07:10:37 2015 UTC,Sometimes in a fortnight. I'll either drink vodka straight or mix it with a Neuro Bliss or Orange Juice like a poor russian.
Toonami,35yor8,JohnXSky,1 point,Thu May 14 19:37:22 2015 UTC,"Been drinking while watching toonami every Saturday for the past 2 years, it just makes it even better when you have a group of people to watch it with. My favorite drink has to be either Golden Monkey Tripel or Knob creek whiskey neat, by the end of the night the ending show is always hilarious no matter what."
Toonami,35yor8,SwizzleStyx,1 point,Thu May 14 20:07:53 2015 UTC,Haven't drank during the block in a long time but green apple smirnoff is usually my go to or I'll mix some vodka and coke.

Toonami,35rmmu,WalterOzymandias,6,Tue May 12 22:58:18 2015 UTC,"Thanks for doing this!  Also,   the Toonami staff was interested in having a sequel to FLCL created but nothing ever came of it   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsvnQc12S9Y"
Toonami,35rmmu,oringe,3,Tue May 12 23:19:34 2015 UTC,"Happy to do so, I look at it as a way of adding to the liveliness of the board while we wait for each Saturday to roll around.  As for the remorse of what could have been in a sequel to FLCL, I can respect Gainax for being happy with where it ended. In my eyes FLCL is like the Seinfeld of anime. It doesn't take itself too seriously and is just about having a good time. Whereas with Evangelion, while also insane its own right, it needed to be rectified with additional content when it entirely jumped off a cliff in its last two episodes."
Toonami,35rmmu,Irongarden3,3,Wed May 13 00:53:13 2015 UTC,Some more recent dubs that I found very good are deadman and the railgun/index series
Toonami,35rmmu,kevoc2008,3,Wed May 13 00:50:15 2015 UTC,"So, I noticed something that Toonami is doing with one certain show (I think you know what I am talking about)..  Should I post my prediction that something is going to happen with one show on Toonami this weekend?"
Toonami,35rmmu,GreyouTT,3,Wed May 13 01:37:48 2015 UTC,Be my guest!
Toonami,35rmmu,darknessflamegundam,2,Wed May 13 02:05:12 2015 UTC,"While a number of people are certainly of the belief that subs are greater than dubs, the question of favorite dub really got me thinking of how for people that prefer dubs, shows can be ruined for them so much more so if the voice talent isn't there or if its originality is lost in translation. For me personally, although I'm trying to get into One Piece now that Toonami has been airing it for some time, the 4Kids dub version from back in the day made me look at the show negatively. With so much of the dialogue and scenes edited incomprehensiblly, it's no wonder why I didn't really care for it back then."
Toonami,35r52p,Error400BadRequest,5,Tue May 12 20:46:02 2015 UTC,SAO is killing toonami they say. Suuuuuuuure
Toonami,35r52p,Irongarden3,1 point,Tue May 12 22:22:16 2015 UTC,"People said it was shit.   I don't think anybody said it was ""killing"" Toonami."
Toonami,35r52p,candycaneforestelf,1 point,Wed May 13 03:40:26 2015 UTC,It is kinda sorta shit. But it's still a fun watch.
Toonami,35r52p,anteater97,5,Thu May 14 16:03:56 2015 UTC,"Pretty nice! As long as we're getting good views, average ratings don't have me complaining. Now, if some of those drops get smaller (which summer could possibly remedy), I'd be a REALLY happy camper."
Toonami,35r52p,rmm45177,4,Tue May 12 21:15:06 2015 UTC,"Overall it's nice, but the numbers on the dbz rerun and first three shows seem less than usual.  I'm surprised AoT rerun can get so many, though, considering the last time they ran it.  Hope for some better numbers next week, as more people finish finals."
Toonami,35r52p,SonicGamer74,2,Tue May 12 21:59:11 2015 UTC,"It mostly amazes me, considering it comes on at like, 2 AM.  I mean, I'm sure a lot of people watch Toonami throughout, but 0.6 Million people?  That's....pretty impressive for that time."
Toonami,35r52p,GreyouTT,1 point,Wed May 13 02:48:57 2015 UTC,The viewer number is actually the second one over. The ones with 0.6  had over 800k viewers.
Toonami,35r52p,SOLIDninja,3,Wed May 13 20:15:40 2015 UTC,Trips! Not bad at all!
Toonami,35r52p,SOLIDninja,2,Tue May 12 20:50:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's not bad, but it's also pretty ""average"" nowadays.   As an aside, what's up with the highlighted usernames?"
