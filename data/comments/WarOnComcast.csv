Cable isn't like electricity. Contact your electric company or check the wiring where you live. Cable cannot and will not destroy a tv in the way you describe. Calling them would make you look really stupid and get you no where. If your tv is fairly new you could probably send it in for warranty.

Your TV not turning on and flashing a red light sounds an awful lot like a failed power supply capacitor.  I've replaced too many of those to count to bring people's LCDs back to life.  Could have just been a weird coincidence that it happened at the same time the cable was shut off, but I'm not aware of a cable provider being able to fry downstream equipment unless a lightning strike came through the cable.  If they did, they'd fry every TV on your block since it operates on a big splitter network and aren't really able to isolate your line alone unless they do it from the local splice or demarcation box.  The cables to each dwelling are not homerun all the way back to their facility.  Source: I'm a Telco tech with a little hobby electronics background.

You'd get broadcast channels (which yes, is normally free OTA anyway), but you also get their version of Netflix and a cloud DVR.    The benefit here is being able to record some shows, watch some on demand movies and shows, and having HBO.

WarOnComcast,3d63if,turdBouillon,8,Tue Jul 14 15:11:13 2015 UTC,"I mean -- the extra speed really is more or less a complete waste, as almost nobody has hardware capable of speeds greater than 1Gbps in their home. To take advantage of that, you need (at least) a 10Gbps NIC for each computer that you would like to use (~$400) and a 10Gbps switch (>$800). Even if you only wanted this to provide 1Gbps speeds 2 devices simultaneously, you would still need the expensive switch, as you would need the 10Gbps connection to the modem.  At this point in time, 2Gbps is just... kinda dumb. It makes things way more expensive and complicated, without offering any real benefit over 1Gbps. Again, unless you are one of the 0.000000000000000000001% of home users that are using hardware capable of >1Gbps, this offers no benefit whatsoever over Google Fiber, which is 1/4 the price, has 1/3 the startup costs with no time commitment (or 0% with a one year commitment), and doesn't lock you into a contract with the devil for 2 years.

WarOnComcast,3by0hk,vaultmaira,6,Fri Jul 3 02:24:08 2015 UTC,"Go ahead and turn off that âxfinitywifiâ hotspot bullshit. You're paying them for the modem AND you're paying for the electricity. They should be paying YOU.  To disable the *hack-spit* ""feature"" visit My Account, click on My Services, and then select Manage your home hotspot under the XFINITY Internet tab. See XFINITY WiFi: Enable or Disable Home Hotspot in My Account for step-by-step instructions.    Now,  First off, you'll want to connect a computer directly to the router with an Ethernet cable, completely bypassing Wi-Fi and run some speed tests.   You can test with Comcast's internal speed test, which will give you speeds to their on-network test server, but be sure to also test with off-network sites like Speedof.me and Speedtest.net, which will give you an idea of how good your connection is to the rest of the world.  If the direct connection looks crappy then it's something to do with your router or your Comcast connection or Comcast. That will require further testing and diagnosis.  If the direct connection looks good then it's something with the Wi-Fi, your environment or the device(s) your dad is connecting to Wi-Fi.  Use something like WirelessNetView or inSSIDer to see what channels are being used by other Wi-Fi systems in the neighborhood. Configure his router to sit on a channel least used and furthest away from others. inSSIDer is good for that if your airwaves are crowded because the graphical representation shows channel overlap, making it easier to choose a less used band.  Anything further than that will require examining the router's Wi-Fi config, performance logs and having a good look at what your dad is connecting to it."
WarOnComcast,3by0hk,nspectre,2,Fri Jul 3 04:36:00 2015 UTC,"One things that's worked for me before, with stupid shit like this, is to unplug both power and coax from the modem, reset the modem, wait about 15 min, then plug everything back in and try again.  Also try testing it while hardwired to the modem."
WarOnComcast,3by0hk,PooPooCaCaChips,2,Fri Jul 3 03:58:23 2015 UTC,"Getting rid of the xfinitywifi network is a good start, but really the best way to improve this is to get your own hardware (modem + wireless router).   You said he lives in a city, so I would imagine there are many other networks running nearby, which will create interference problems. Get a modern router that supports dual band wifi (2.4 and 5ghz), set up his wifi to run on the 5ghz network, and you should start seeing the speeds you're paying for.   Troubleshooting wifi problems can be a bit of a rabbit hole, but I usually start with the equipment, especially when it's being rented from the ISP.   Buying your own modem will also save him a few bucks a month. I'd recommend, and personally use, the Motorola SB6121 modem."

You do NOT need to go into excruciating detail. 1 screenshot of FCC website showing what they detail for your area. Photographs of the AT&T equipment near your property. I would combine these into an info pack and make multiple copies.   I would then write up a concise 3-minute max verbal statement of what the problem is and what it is you desire.    I would then schedule an appearance before your city council. There, I would give the 3-minute speech and submit the info packs for their perusal.  This is what your city council is for. They are your community representatives. They can advise you on what needs to be done or take action on your behalf.  You may find that AT&T has misrepresented itself, its services and its coverage to your city administrators (and your county. And your state. And the FCC.)  Who knows, maybe a stern letter from the city attorney can shake loose some AT&T action. At the very least you're bringing to their attention that a local problem exists.  Plus, it can be interesting, eye-opening and may be fun.    Edit: If you really want to drive a point home. A little research should pull up quite a bit of information on how AT&T has for many years been sucking off the government teat specifically to obtain tax-payer dollars to fund the servicing of remote and rural communities, such as yourself, but has come under lots of criticism for not delivering upon its promises."

If they were bound to, say, forfit 20% of corporate profits for every year they imposed caps and the board/CEO/etc were under a contract that insta-fired them with no golden parachute, plus a fine of 20% of their personal net worth if they started imposing caps or something equally draconian then, and only then, would I believe them.

WarOnComcast,3axhw3,eacrataes,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:26:49 2015 UTC,"Like others have said,  speeds can vary depending on a lot of circumstances.  If you have hardwired speeds that low connected directly to the modem/wireless gateway you have a real and legitimate complaint and probably have a line issue,  get a tech out.  If those speeds are wireless you should take into account the following:  How far away from your wifi access point are you?  Are you on the same floor?  What is between you and your access point?  Are you connected to a 2.4Ghz network or a 5Ghz network?  How many other networks are in your area?  Are you using a Comcast wireless gateway?  The wireless gateways are a modem and (shitty) router combo unit.  Most are 2.4ghz only but some of the newer ones are 5Ghz as well.  The 2.4Ghz radio has a range of about 100 ft at best,  the 5Ghz is half that.    If you have one of these do yourself a favor and buy your own modem and separate router.  These things are about as reliable as an engine block made of hard cheeses. At the very least get your own router and exchange the combo for a cable modem and ditch the wireless aspect. They claim they don't have just regular modems when you talk to them over the phone (at least their tier 1 agents do) but just March into the local office with your combo unit in hand and they won't give you any hassle. The combo units have a setting called bridge mode that Disables wifi and routing on that unit which  in theory should work but doesn't half the time so skip it.   Keep in mind though,  they will refuse any help if the hardwired speed is at or above 100 and your wifi is slow if you have your own gear.  They'll refer you to the router OEM."

WarOnComcast,3axhw3,snootyduckhunter,1 point,Thu Jun 25 06:20:00 2015 UTC,"Bits per second (*bps) and Bytes per second (*B/s) are terms used to express values for different things. bps is generally used to express bandwidth measurements - when you look at Internet ads, and speed tests, and such, you'll see bandwidth measured this way. B/s is generally used to measure download and upload speed - when you transfer a file, you'll see your speed expressed in this way.  This is partly a marketing tactic, and partly to clarify a distinction between ""bandwidth"" and ""speed"", two different concepts.  Does this mean that Comcast is lying? Well, partly. You will get a bandwidth of up to 105mbps. But does that mean you'll get crushingly fast speeds? Probably not, for a lot of reasons like ""network congestion"" and ""bottlenecks on other networks"" that amount to a lot of bullshit.

WarOnComcast,3axhw3,domdest,8,Wed Jun 24 12:46:31 2015 UTC,"They aren't different concepts, just different units. One megabyte contains 8 megabits. When the ISP's measure speeds in mbps it seems like it's higher because computers rarely ever display bits and usually use bytes."
WarOnComcast,3axhw3,MilkasaurusRex,-2,Wed Jun 24 17:51:52 2015 UTC,"Not so. The first is a measure of net bit rate or channel capacity. The second is a measure of bit rate.  Edit: I get what you're saying here, that mbps and MB/s are just different orders of magnitude for the same mathematical unit of measurement. But what I'm saying is that bandwidth is expressed in bits per second, while bit rate is expressed in bytes per second. This is done almost entirely for marketing purposes."
WarOnComcast,3axhw3,domdest,3,Wed Jun 24 18:05:02 2015 UTC,"There a two factors to consider; bandwidth and speed. If we compare this to plumbing, the factors are pipe diameter and speed of liquid. The thicker the pipe, the greater the quantity of water that can be moved through the pipe in a given time period at a given speed.  The figure ISPs advertise is the data throughput; the combination of the bandwidth and connection speed. The rate of water flowing though a pipe can be calculated with the diameter of the pipe and the water speed. Data which does not become out-of-date quickly, such as media streaming or file downloads, does not require high speed, so long as throughput is high. Multiplayer gaming, however, requires low latency, or higher-speed water in our plumbing analogy.  Bandwidth cannot be measured in bytes or bits per anything, as it's not throughput. Speed can be, and is, measured in physical speed (shown as ping time in milliseconds). Throughput is what arguably matters the most, and this can be measured in MB/s, MBps, Mb/s or Mbps.  Marketing is another matter, which is why throughput and bandwidth can be so easily confused."

Width of the road, not speed or volume of the cars.   The capacity expressed typically in metric multiples of bits per second, as is being discussed.

Let me ELI5 it for you kiddo:  You have this train, see. It has a capacity. You see how I used that word capacity from your source? You can fit 500 people on that train. However, only so many trains can travel at the same time, and there are other areas in the transportation system that can't fit 500 people at a time, like the doors and the turnstyles. So your train takes five minutes to fill up, and then it takes 25 minutes to get to its destination. So break that down and you're averaging 16.6 passengers per minute.  That's the difference between bandwidth and speed. Bandwidth is how much data you can fit. Speed is how fast the data gets t here.

Wireless is fickle magic shtuffs. ;)  I believe all of Comcast's current routers support up to 802.11n.  If your laptop is old-school 802.11 you should see speeds in the neighborhood of 1 to 2mbps with an indoor range of about 20m/66'. Solid objects like walls attenuate the signal but at 2.4ghz you should see ranges comparable to standard ""cordless"" telephone handsets.  802.11a should net you speeds of 6mbps to 54mbps within a range of about 35m/115'. At 5ghz, it has a little tougher time getting through walls and objects than 2.4ghz does.  802.11b @ 2.4ghz should get you between 1mbps and 11mbps at the same range.   802.11g @ 2.4ghz should see 6mbps to 54mbps within an indoor range of 35m/115'.  802.11n @ 2.4ghz or 5ghz gives a broader potential speed range depending on various factors. You should see, oh, let's say 6mbps to 70mbps or 13.5mbps to 150mbps with an indoor range of about 70m/230'.    If you have a lot of close WiFi neighbors, such as in an apartment building, use a program like InSSIDer to see what channels they're camping on and choose a least-used/-overlapped channel to configure your own router to."

There is a lot of pressure to praise the company and pretend that everything is great, and I'm certain this is a problem from the top down.  It's commonplace for departments to fudge their metrics and make excuses for anything that looks bad, rather than actually doing something about it.  It's a culture of blame where facts mean very little.  Remember that whole issue that came up with customers having their names changed in the billing systems to vulgarities?  Internally they represented it as a security incident, as if Comcast was the victim of skilled hackers.  It's not safe to be honest and direct, and without this the company will never change.  People who are honest and direct become targets of slander and eventually quit.  Most of us that have been around for a while are either pushovers with families to support, or instigators trying to climb the corporate ladder.  The expectation is to say the ""right"" thing, but to take which ever action meets the least resistance, regardless of how right it is.  Comcast does have the resources to become a great, innovative company, but it's so plagued by dishonesty and delusion that the best it can do is stifle competition through shady business practices.  I wish it was different."

We didn't have issues getting the service setup with the self-install kit originally about 10 years ago, and the only time we have had line issues (internet and TV both cutting out during light rain, but working fine in a storm), they sent a tech out the next day (on time, but with a 4 hour window) and he replaced the entire line from the power pole to the junction at the house, also replaced the splitter there since it wasn't rated correctly apparently.  When we upgraded to Business Class the tech they sent out definitely knew what he was doing, got whatever needed upgrading at the box done and replaced our old (owned) modem with a DOCSIS3 capable one (left our old modem here and we have no rental fee). The total time for that upgrade from when he got here to leaving was about 25 minutes.  All that being said, I am certain my experiences are an anomaly."

Are you just beginning to attempt to get service or are you actually a contractually-signed customer? If you ARE a customer....  Step #1:  Per the Comcast Agreement for Residential Services, Section 13 BINDING ARBITRATION  Opt the fuck out NOW. Do it on-line AND via registered letter. Take screenshots and save them. Comcast arbitrates through the American Arbitration Association which rules in Comcast's favor 99.99999999999999...999% of the time. And if the AAA doesn't arbitrate in Comcast's favor? Comcast just ignores their judgement.  Arbitration does NOTHING for you and EVERYTHING for Comcast. And it locks you out of the regular judicial court system.  Step #2:  Get yourself setup to record ALL telephone calls, on-line chats and other communication mediums you may have with Comcast reps.  Then call them back and explain that you've opted-out of arbitration and if they do not give you the information you need to configure your own modem, as mandated by the FCC, you'll have little recourse but to seek legal counsel.  See what they say to that. ;)    Comcast doesn't want you to use your own equipment because Comcast's $68 (or less) modems are an insanely massive cash cow. They bill you $10+ a month and after 6 months it's nothing but profit. $10 free-and-clear profit a month from 22 million customers is nothing to sneeze at.

WarOnComcast,381obg,nspectre,5,Mon Jun 1 07:33:26 2015 UTC,"I may be incorrect that it's mandated by the FCC (as of yet).  But it has ALWAYS been the case, since the birth of online connectivity, that a customer can connect their own equipment. ISP's originally DID NOT supply a customer's modem. The customer had to purchase it themselves. It was not until ISDN, DSL and Cable that the dynamic shifted somewhat (in that you could rent one), BUT IT NEVER EXCLUDED customer-owned equipment. Do not let them lie to you.  It is one of the basic tenants of Net Neutrality that an end user is allowed to connect ANY network-compatible device of their choosing and the ISP doesn't get to say jack-shit about it.  Personally, as someone who has been on the 'Net since before the WWW was invented, if an ISP refused to allow me to use my own equipment on my connection, I'd be down at their offices with a baseball bat looking to bust some kneecaps.

INSIDE your apartment they will almost certainly let you plug in your own gear--and that meets the requirements of the whole FCC 'self-install' thing. You having access to everyone else's cable and phone connections? No. What you get from that restricted access is later none of your possibly crazy neighbor's has access to your connection either. You describe that the 50 bucks is for zero activity. Not exactly true. It's a tech, who has access to that closet, confirming in person that everything works. He might just stand there... but he/she is 'doing' something. In rare cases they actually 'tune' the signal--it's sort of like dialing in an old radio station.  You might be able to persuade them to let you 'attempt' a no fee self install with the presumption that all of the connections are intact. But if it doesn't work, you will be paying for a tech visit that bills at a different rate than the 50 bucks. And... all of that said, Comcast's culture is OBEY.

WarOnComcast,37mlnw,CogitoNM,3,Thu May 28 19:10:58 2015 UTC,"I get about 30Mbps up/10down for $50 with Comcast. The speeds are normal for this area, but they're the only Cable company in town."
WarOnComcast,37mlnw,LongDevil,5,Thu May 28 19:12:39 2015 UTC,"It's pretty competitive where I am with Comcast/Xfinity, WOW, and U-Verse.  I've read a lot of people had bad experiences with WOW, but satisfaction rate in this area with them is very high.  People hate Comcast around here and have kept WOW many years. I was the lone hold in my area. I went with WOW on that Internet only plan and get my signals OTA, and use a Tablo TV to record, and watch live even away from the house. One thing I don't have to worry about is the rate jumping up 20-40 bucks/months after a promo period.  Well, the internet maybe - I might have to go back to Comcast for a when the 12 month promo ends. But, I'll say this much for WOW. When they say 50 Mbps, I'm getting very close to that any time I check through speediest.net. I can't say the same for Comcast."
WarOnComcast,37mlnw,CogitoNM,5,Thu May 28 19:33:10 2015 UTC,"Lucky, they charge me $87/mo for the same speeds packaged with economy basic cable. I asked what the price would be if I got rid of cable (which I never watch) and they said it would be $80/mo.  My only other ISP choice is AT&T with higher prices, slower speeds and even worse customer service."
WarOnComcast,37mlnw,LongDevil,5,Thu May 28 19:21:00 2015 UTC,"Yup. It's quickly becoming the norm that basic / extended cable is being left behind.

WarOnComcast,37mlnw,crawsome,1 point,Thu May 28 19:34:42 2015 UTC,"Before I fired Comcast in March, and took WOW up on their $50/50 plan for Internet only, they quoted me like a $6 difference if I eliminated phone. I was probably looking at over $100 when factoring in equipment and price increase after promo. WOW is good in my area, and there was no contract, so I am free to back out at any time without penalty. That price is locked for 1 year. I'll re-check my options then. Comcast doesn't like people downgrading."

After that, does this mean it's going to be around $20? So, the promo is $89 + $7.99 + $3.50 (broadcast) + $1 (regional sports).  What I wasn't clear on is if these channels are HD or if that requires that box to get the HD. I cut the cord recently, but $89 for all that had me suspicious.  At the end of the day, I'm thinking Comcast is still going to get close to $100 or over.  I also don't understand the X1 box and how that works.  You have one device, but how do other TV's receive it, or is it enough to have a smart TV?  Or, do you need to get additional equipment on top of that?  I'm a cord cutter, so I'm not planning on doing this, but I'm trying to explain it to others."

I've talked to Charter customers. I used to raid with a handful of them on WoW. They were constantly dropping their connections. They said the coverage was awful. The only reason Charter isn't rated worse than Comcast is that they don't cover much of the eastern seaboard (including NYC, the media hub)."

It's been a little soured recently as someone close to my friend is likely using grow lights (or similar) that's introducing interference to the line and causing my friend to have dropped connection issues and Charter won't do anything about it.

And you can expect that to change when/if they buy TW. Charter is pretty much the only viable broadband connection in my city (where I live, I actually only get HughesNet Satellite). They're okay at the moment as far as consumer treatment goes (although they refuse to run cable an extra half mile without me paying them 10 grand). From age 13 to 24 they were the only highspeed connection I had access to.  However, don't kid yourself...they have just as much potential for corruption as any other ISP does and if they buy TW, you can guarantee they'll become insufferable. They, like many others, have been given hundreds of thousands in grant money to expand their network, yet they just let all that cable sit in warehouses instead of actually putting forth the effort to expand across the area. Wanna know why? Because they have no competition. AT&T Uverse is just starting to creep into a couple of areas around here, but by and large if you don't want to use or don't have access to Charter, in my country, then your only other choices are satellite internet or dial-up."
WarOnComcast,37fuhe,Xunderground,-1,Wed May 27 18:05:04 2015 UTC,I use Charter. Switched from AT&T and previously had Comcast. Charter is fantastic. Amazing customer support and my speeds are always higher than advertised.

WarOnComcast,37fuhe,lonelyboyisme,2,Wed May 27 14:51:41 2015 UTC,"They are fundamentally a different company. Comcast owns content creators, they have a much larger market share, and a long history of terrible and well-voiced horrors involving customer service.  Comcast owning content creation hubs was the biggest problem I had with the whole thing. Charter wouldn't be obligated in any fashion to prefer one thing over the other if they don't perform the shitty practice of accepting bribes to get preferred network bandwidth of course  Now, that being said I don't believe Charter should be allowed to acquire TWC. This whole acquisition crap is sort of expected, as cable companies are starting to fall apart due to cord cutting. They need to stop trying to force everyone else to adhere to their business model and adapt to the changing media landscape."

I'm guessing the round green ""junction"" boxes may be pedestal taps? Are they near to a telephone pole feeding overhead wires to your house?

Right away, pull your credit reports from the 3 major credit reporting bureaus.  You have a strong case against Comcast if the information is being reported on your credit report.  Next, send a letter to Comcast and the collection agency along with a copy (always keep all your originals they never need it) of the proof you paid it.  Make sure you state in the letter that you are disputing the debt and that you are also requesting they prove you didn't pay it (this is called ""debt validation"" and they have a certain amount of time to respond or you can sue them).  Send the letter certified so you have proof they got it.  Wait 30 days for both to ignore you.  Now, file a claim of $3,000 ($1,000 for each offense if all three credit reports are reporting the negative info) against Comcast (original creditor) in small claims court.  They are violating the law, damaging your credit, and it is up to you to do something about it.  I know I would.  I mean, it's up to 3 grand you could get, and odds are you are going to win.

On one hand Comcrap can claim they are just warning users with friendly reminders, on the other this violates multiple laws on data intrusion and tampering with network recourses without operator permission. According to FCC mandate Comcast's network policing ends at their coax cables termination. Because their tampering with normal system operation on the LAN it could be perceived as illegal, but since the JS is injected before it even reaches the modern, they could say they have nothing to do with what happens in your PC.

WarOnComcast,35xxkm,Javad0g,2,Sat May 16 14:35:57 2015 UTC,"To make things easier, just check out the comments in the Hacker News discussion I posted. There are several problems with that code, but the top comment nailed the biggest problems.   This code is beyond awful - it fails to display, makes endless AJAX requests, and more; here are a few fun tidbits:   The code is not encapsulated in an IIFE, so it clobbers any global variables (like 'image_url') in the page, breaking any scripts relying on those variables. The code spends an inordinate time checking if you're running Netscape Navigator 6. Strangely, they include a whole bunch of code allowing the message to be dragged around the window (which is nice) but they don't allow it to be closed. Of course, it closes itself after making a single AJAX request into a black hole, so there's that. Bugs piled on top of each other make this entire message mostly harmless, if it weren't for the variable clobbering & bandwidth usage (see the next item...) Upon load, checkBulletin() is immediately invoked. This does an AJAX call to '/e8f6b078-0f35-11de-85c5-efc5ef23aa1f/aupm/notify.do?dispatch=checkBulletin'. I assume this is to check if the bulletin has changed, to see if there are new messages, or maybe to check if the user has acknowledged the message yet. Unfortunately:    This URL is relative, which means it will never actually reach its intended target (instead filling your web logs with this request) Upon xmlhttp.readystate=4 (request finished, successful or not, so this will change to 4 even on a 404 error), the comcast message is hidden. This means that the entire 'bandwidth exceeded' message will actually be hidden as soon as this request completes, which may be in <500ms, giving the user absolutely no time to see or acknowledge it. The author makes an attempt to not continue sending AJAX requests to this URL after a successful attempt, but botches it, so this request is actually sent indefinitely, every 5000ms, while every any page is open. This means every single tab on your system is popping AJAX requests every 5 seconds for the whole month that your account is nearing its quota. This likely brings you over quota pretty quickly if you leave your computer on all day.   That's right, this code causes every page served on your system to pop an AJAX request to the wrong URL every 5 seconds, as long as the tabs are open.  We can sit and argue all day whether or not it's ethical to display messages by injecting code into the DOM, but it is certainly unethical to write such awful javascript that clobbers global variables and drives up bandwidth costs by making AJAX requests to the wrong url every 5 seconds until the cows come home. Whoever wrote this script should be fired."

After discovering that they gave a fuck-all about burying their lines, I discovered a nearly sure-fire way to get them to get the job done.  I would tell them that there are children in the area, and the exposed line was a tripping hazard. I told them that the call was recorded, and they were officially notified that they had created a hazard to the children. I told them that if any child was harmed by their exposed cable that they were officially liable as they were on the record as having been informed of the dangerous situation.   The only time this tactic failed was in the north-east in winter, when they claimed the ground was frozen and they literally couldn't dig to bury the cable. Every other time that cable was buried within days."

No one ever came, we called back they said the contractor said that he had buried it. We told them he never buried it. Comcast told us since he reported it buried it was good enough for them.

Hattiesburg isn't huge and I do believe that the drop bury crew works all over Tennessee, Mississippi, and Alabama; which means that in order to get the drop buried, they have to get enough burial requests in the area to make a days worth of work out of it.

One guy has been out there twice to finish and both times left w/out doing it. Another guy came, got out and looked and said he would have to call a supervisor and she hasn't heard anything else. The local office says they don't know when it will get done. Meanwhile, every month since December she gets asked at the HOA meeting when she's getting her cable buried. Meanwhile the line gets run over dozens of times a day laying across the street by the residents, not to mention the garbage truck, UPS, USPS truck, paper carrier etc. and now the guy on the riding mower has to work around it every week when mowing. This is an older condo community too, not sure why the infrastructure isn't there already. I havent even started the part about how many trips the initial install took, how many times she's been on the phone, and how the bill has been wrong. Those are other topics I'll address once the cable gets buried.  As a side note, I set her up w/ a Roku this weekend, in other words the cable cutting seed has been planted and the longer her Comcast problems take the more the seed develops.

WarOnComcast,35gkna,eacrataes,1 point,Sun May 10 22:04:24 2015 UTC,"Most of the time when something screws up it's a fault of one individual not doing their job. In the beginning, it probably started off with the original tech forgetting to put in the request, then who knows, once FINALLY the drop bury guys got there they could've run in to problems with their machine or whatever. Then they could've forgotten about it too.      What really sucks is that the company itself doesn't take responsibility for any of it. They just try and schmooze things over temporarily. Like a child getting disciplined for being mean to another child, then they cry and tell you what you want to hear all while doing the exact same thing the very next day. There's no hierarchy for discipline for something like that. No one's accountable. I get really frustrated if i go behind another technician and get bitched at by the customer, i get on the phone with my dispatch and find out that there's no crew coming because a request wasn't put in. So, naturally I do what I'm supposed to and put in a ticket. Inform my supervisor of what happened and the tech that forgot to do it doesn't get reprimanded, talked to, or even hears about it unless i speak to them personally."

I realized a while ago that Comcast is just so insanely huge and unwieldy and broken-to-the-core that no matter how many kind and well-intentioned, ethical, good people may be working there... it's just impossible for the giant to produce overall good results for society as a whole.  And I seriously doubt it can be fixed without tearing down the whole behemoth and building it up over again from scratch.  I foresee them getting broken up, like the Telco's, sometime in the next 10 years."
WarOnComcast,3588l5,flumpis,6,Fri May 8 08:33:36 2015 UTC,"I really think that if the organization were leveled and built from the ground up, it would improve significantly.

It's sort of like buying up a bunch of buildings and just using those buildings for the materials to build an even larger building. The result is an ugly patchwork that is dangerously unstable."
WarOnComcast,3588l5,domdest,5,Fri May 8 15:20:27 2015 UTC,"The problem here is that it's a publicly traded corporation, and a lot of the shittiness comes right from major stockholders, and cascades on down into upper management. The major stockholders aren't going to change their business philosophies any time soon, and they're not going to sell or give away their stocks any time soon. How do you dismantle an edifice such as that? You'd have to overhaul the whole concept of publicly traded corporations (which I'm down for, but that's a much larger monster to vanquish)."
WarOnComcast,3588l5,flumpis,3,Fri May 8 16:52:32 2015 UTC,"You're right on that front, but a lot of the shittiness also comes from operational issues within the company itself. A friend of mine recently set up Comcast at his new apartment in SF and had a hell of a time getting it up and running. At one point he was connected to a support group that wasted 20 minutes of his time before realizing that he was in California, and they were only able to support users in Delaware. Shit like this happens very often and it's not really a management issue (although one could argue with better management they'd fix these issues). Their infrastructure is so screwed up and has never been rebuilt, only patched. But couple this with terrible business practices and you have the steaming pile of shit that is Comcast."
WarOnComcast,3588l5,domdest,4,Fri May 8 16:59:23 2015 UTC,"Having worked for 3 years for Comcast customer support and a brief stint in corporate-level support (2007-2010), I can tell you much worse horror stories than the one about your friend. And I agree with you. The organization from the middle on down is an absolute mess. There is no drive whatsoever to streamline processes, and every policy is obfuscated and changed so frequently that no two employees have the same information. The software tools that drive the business are built on disparate platforms that don't communicate well with one another. And the entire thing is structured off of a legal and regulatory structure that hasn't been overhauled since the 1970s - in many states (like mine, New Jersey), the cable rules vary by town and not just by state, and all of this is stored in a database older than Windows."

WarOnComcast,3588l5,domdest,7,Fri May 8 17:20:33 2015 UTC,"Sure! Prepare for text-wall. :)  I don't have any particularly awful stories from my time on corporate-level support, because they're a team that is basically authorized to override any and every policy that is in place under the guise of establishing a ""standard operating procedure"" that doesn't favor one customer over another. This team responded to customers who had contacted the ""office of the president"" with complaints, or threatened legal action, or complained to some regulatory body or the BBB. And VIPs. Anyone who was a VIP got forwarded directly to this department - meaning celebrities, politicians, rich people, etc. They never had to wait on hold, or get the run-around, and they rarely ever paid things like activation fees. Basically I could pick up the phone to any department in the company that could fix the problem and get it fixed within hours.  However, in my days as regular support, I got to see the results of some of the worst botch-ups I've heard of in my professional career to date. The thing that is hard about Comcast from the inside is that you get to work alongside these people who are clearly skilled and passionate, who love their jobs and care about their customers, but then those people are grossly overshadowed by a handful who have no comprehension, no drive, and they have the power to make horrible mistakes on a customer's account with a few button presses.   These representatives are trained to focus on their METRICS rather than their customers. The metrics were bible and scripture. And the problem here is not just organizational but institutional. Government regulatory bodies base their fines of Comcast on those same metrics - how long was the customer on hold before getting to a representative? For example, one regulatory body required that a minimum of 85% of cable customers speak to a live person within something like 90 seconds of being directed to that department, or Comcast would get a fine. What this led to wasn't an increase in quality staffing - it led to cheaply paid outsourcing, and pressure placed on representatives to get customers off the phone as quickly as possible without them having to call back and muck up our lines again later.  This is then bolstered by a skeleton crew supervisory staff - on any given shift, you had three supervisors overseeing fifty employees, and each employee got at least one call per hour that required some interaction from a supervisor. In my early days there (before they fixed a lot of this), any time a customer's technician was late to an appointment, the supervisor had to call dispatch and sit on hold, sometimes for up to an hour, in order to get 30 seconds on a line with a dispatcher who would pass along whatever line the technician made up about why they were a no-show.  The technical operations department (the department that lays and repairs lines, runs the contractors who install services, triages and dispatches these jobs) functioned in much the same way as certain judicial bodies in our government - no accountability, no integrity, and they were more concerned with the ""CYA"" approach than with customer service. They covered each other's asses.  Story-time:  Whenever someone asks me to tell them my ultimate nightmare story, this is the first that comes to mind. I get a call from this guy who is literally screaming fit to give himself a brain aneurysm the moment he gets on the phone with me. Now, most other people would gladly have foisted this guy off on a supervisor or gotten rid of him with some cheap lines, but I had this thing about my calls never being escalated to supervisors. I'm a cocky, arrogant bastard and I was either loved or hated by my superiors and peers, but I also did the job I said I'd do.  So this guy, he's screaming, and I manage to calm him down a bit to get him to tell me what the problem is. He's been without telephone service for the past couple of weeks. And it's worse than just he needs a tech out to fix his wires. Some idiot in customer service disconnected his whole phone, locked up his phone number in our computer systems (which are reliant on a much more large-scale inter-company switching system), and bogged the whole thing down with work orders and rate codes (specialized codes that designate what services you have) to kingdom come. This guy was fucked. He was fucked to the point where it was impossible for me to get him unfucked in the space of a phone call. So I say ""look...it's gonna be impossible for me to fix this tonight. But I will fix it. What's your situation?""  He freaks out all over again, but tells me ""your people sold me this phone and told me that I could use it for my nine year old daughter's LifeAlert (which was a lie, so that someone in another support department could meet their high pressure sales quota - Comcast recommends AGAINST using their phone service for LifeAlert). She lives on life support and when her equipment can't connect to a phone line back to the hospital she has to stay the night in the hospital.""  I honestly can't say that I've ever felt more helpless in my life, hearing this distraught dad say his kid's life was in danger because of our fuck-up, and that she had to be miserable in a hospital instead of at home being a kid, and I KNEW there was no way I could fix the problem that same day.  Ultimately, it took me two days. I ended up talking to something like four departments within the company, which I think was what put me on the radar of that corporate team. I legitimately sat there on the phone with every person who touched this guy's account, and made sure that every step they took was unfucking his account rather than making it worse.  Still, at the end of it, something had diminished in me. I had kinda gone into the company believing that I could really do some good and make it a better company, but once I had fixed this guy's problem it had jarred my faith. It's so hard to believe that you can do any good when you're surrounded by so many people who just stopped caring."

WarOnComcast,352fjr,DrSpagetti,10,Wed May 6 15:35:59 2015 UTC,"When this article says in their update that the On Time Guarantee has existed for ""more than two years"" before that article, they mean that the On Time Guarantee has existed for about 7 years. This was introduced when I worked there, from 2007-2010.   However, when it was introduced, customer service representatives were trained to only give the $20 credit on the account if the customer specifically said the words ""On Time Guarantee"" when they called to complain that their technician was late, and that we weren't to offer the $20 credit without being asked for it.  On a couple of occasions, I had customers on the line who were out-and-out screaming about the lateness of their technician, that they had lost time and money from work to be home for the tech, that this was the fifth time in two weeks that a tech had been late. I'd heard it all. And if I offered them the $20 credit, I'd get pulled aside by a supervisor for it. However, if the customer demanded to speak with a supervisor, that same supervisor would get on the phone and say ""I'm so sorry, tell you what, I'm going to give you a $20 credit for your trouble"", which was then marked as part of the OTG and came out of that budget - and end up looking like the hero while I was the asshole who didn't do anything for the customer.  Edit: Coincidentally, sometimes techs would deliberately juke the numbers. They would claim that they had been to the house, knocked, and got no answer. One supervisor who gave a shit gave me the number for dispatch, and I would get dispatch to call up the tech and ask the tech to give a basic description of the house they'd supposedly just driven away from. More often than not when a customer said the tech was a no-show and the tech said the customer didn't answer the door, they couldn't give the most basic description of the house. However, dispatch and technical operations do a lot to cover for each other, so this trick didn't always work.  In other cases, the tech would show up half an hour late and get the customer to sign their work order with a time half an hour early (or the tech would leave it blank and fill it in later - these work order forms have a lot of fields that are left empty and the customer doesn't usually know what they're looking at). This got logged in the system by the time that the tech wrote down, and again, the tech's supervisor would cover for him or her."

Finally get a comcast tech out to your house to fix an issue? Issue might be taking to long to fix, and suddenly your tech is called away, your issue is passed on to another department, or a part needs to be ordered. What happened most likely is the tech needs to leave to meet his appointment quota and has to rush to his next one, whether your issue is fixed at that point or not.  And as someone who's worked as low man on the totem pole before, please remember that 95% of the time, these are forces beyond the tech's control. Unloading on a tech that has come to help you with your service is a waste of time, and probably pissed the tech off to the point where they don't even care about making sure your issue is resolved at all."

Provider's throw up their hands, say 'Well, I tried helping you' and let ESPN have their $5/sub per month fee, which gets passed directly to the provider's customers...repeat and break out a calculator to add up sub fees for each major network and voila! you'll see most of your bill comes from a decade trend of skyrocketing sub fees.

How about this: All politicians (corporate stooge or not) need votes at election time. If we all hold our politicians accountable for their actions and vote them out of office when they side with big business or whatever then you'd see them change real quick. But the key is, we ALL need to vote.   Voting works. Look at what the Tea Party did to the the Republicans. When they saw someone from their side veering to far away from their core principles, they'd boot them out during a primary.   I do the same thing with my local representatives. When an important vote comes up, I contact them and let them know how I feel about the subject and remind them that I vote during the general and primaries.   Look, if you don't think voting matters, fine. Stay home with your dick in your hand. It's a free country."

That sentiment right there IS NOT the reason big money stays in power.  The reason big money stays in power is because lots of Americans are like ""Meh, voting, whatever."" ""I don't really understand the system."" and/or ""Team Democrat FTW! Team Republican P0wnz!""  THIS mentality has not been ""adopted"" by Americans, it has been actively and successfully engineered by the people making real decisions in this country with such effective social engineering that whether I change my personal little attitude or not is irrelevant, as is whether 10,000 people like you try to convince us all to go vote.   If we all hold our politicians accountable for their actions and vote them out of office when they side with big business or whatever then you'd see them change real quick.   Except the psychology of this has been studied quite extensively and it's simple.  Money for promotion wins elections.  This is mostly because most people don't actually understand most of the issues and don't think too hard about them.  The money has CREATED an environment in which educating large chunks of the electorate is actually impossibly hard.  For you, me or ANYBODY who can't match their financial resources, regardless of what your beliefs are.   Look at what the Tea Party did to the the Republicans.    The Tea Party started out as some racist old people getting angry and was co-opted and built into an astroturfed circle jerk of low information reactionairy voters who could be easily manipulated.  They don't prove your point, they prove mine.   I do the same thing with my local representatives.   Local politics is a different animal.  It's the only stage of the process where actual Democracy still functions.   Look, if you don't think voting matters, fine. Stay home with your dick in your hand. It's a free country.   I don't.  I vote too.  Every election.  Because the ONLY way Democracy CAN work is if I do.  But I'm under no illusions that voting or Democracy is actually working anymore in America.

Just today, Verizon agreed to provide free peering to Cogent rather than risk a complaint to the FCC.   Holy shit, it works!  But I would have worded it, ""Verizon agreed to accept standard free peering to Cogent rather than risk a complaint to the FCC.""  An ISP has ZERO right to charge anyone else but their own customers to access their network.  If an ISP needs to connect to a backbone to get efficient access to parts of the 'Net its customers want access to then THE ISP pays for the connection to the backbone (Tier II).  If the ISP does not want to pay for an interconnection to a backbone then 1) they need to fulfill the requirements of being a Tier I provider and 2) agree to a Settlement-Free peering arrangement with said backbone.  This whole idea of ISP's being the gatekeepers of their customers and charging a toll to everybody else on the fucking planet to get access to them is criminally evil and needs to be put to death with extreme prejudice."

WarOnComcast,349lak,bigsheldy,-2,Wed Apr 29 20:47:02 2015 UTC,Ok?  That's really entirely beside the point of using a hotel's TV service to access shows you don't want to pay a subscription for at home.
WarOnComcast,349lak,bad_fake_name,2,Wed Apr 29 19:20:23 2015 UTC,"My point is a hotel room costs a lot more than one person getting an HBO subscription and then splitting the cost with everyone.  Let's assume for simplicity there are 5 people, and the hotel is $50 for the night. That's $10 per person each week, or $100 for a 10 episode season of Game of Thrones by going to the hotel each week.  Now let's assume a single HBO subscription comes to $25 per month (on the high side, the Comcast website lists prices between $10-$23 for some reason). That comes to 3 months of HBO for $75. That's a $25 savings already, and I don't know anyone that actually pays $25 for their HBO subscription, everyone I know pays ~$15/mo. which would be only $45 for that 3 months of Game of Thrones.  Unless you were already planning on being at the hotel anyway (unlikely given the circumstances) you're still paying for HBO one way or another, it's just buried in the cost of the room."

Proposing one pay double for the same service is just stupid. I was hoping you were just naive not dumb.

I really see Comcast's chickens are coming home to roost.

So while Comcast's service is actually not bad, or the lesser evil of you will, they Know that they're often the best nets in town, and will charge accordingly. So pretty much its.....you pay a little less, and get shittier internet, or you get Comcast because you know that they charge a ton, but they're also some of the more consistent and better service. Comcast Also bullies their consumers into buying up all the time. And have some super shady back door deals.

I asked my mom about it and she said the landlord/administration the box is only for those who have more stuff with Comcast and that they don't provide a box or remote, and that you use the actual TV remote. My remote works fine but, I can't change a channel,not even going up to the TV and pushing the channel switch button works. So now we are stuck watching FOX 247."

You'll need to go over your tenant agreement and determine what it says first.  You'll need to figure out:   Does the landlord, specifically, provide all TV service (like old folks homes, hotels/motels, hospitals, low-income housing) and it's the landlord that gets the bill from Comcast and determines what services/pay-per-view/channel packages are offered? I.E; You are not billed directly by Comcast, but instead pay ""your share"" in your monthly rent? Are you billed individually by Comcast but not allowed to choose another provider because of some ""exclusivity"" agreement between Comcast and the building/landlord? Are you billed individually and the building does not have some exclusivity agreement and maybe the landlord is just feeding you bullshit because s/he thinks Comcast's vans are prettier? Is this arrangement in violation of any city, county, state or federal laws?     If the landlord does supply the TV service, which includes more than one channel and you can't utilize it because they will not provide a remote, they may be in breach of contract. Something to look into."

Believe it or not, even after all this, Comcast continued to run online ads claiming that support of net neutrality is an argument in favor of their proposed acquisition of Time Warner Cable, because the deal would, in their words, mean ""Net neutrality for more people.""

The representative agrees to be recorded as per their job with the call center they work with. Then what is the problem? Theyâre recording so I can record.â  Youâre going to hate me on this but no, you can not. These are two separate instances of the same thing.  â Thing 1 (T1): The location you are calling has consent from you and the person you are talking with to record the call.  â Thing 2 (T2): Recording a call between you and an entity that you agreed to record your call â but did not agree to you recording them.  These are two different things. The center had consent to record from both parties. Ryan did not have that consent nor, in the recordings placed online, did he specifically ask or tell the representative he was recording. SOURCE"

I had the option of having a tech come out or doing it myself, I opted for doing it myself.  It's easy, you plug them into your Tivo,  get a number from your setting menu, call comcast and give them the number and then it works.    So later I move, to the Sacramento area.  I call up comcast and tell them that I have a Tivo and I can install the cable cards myself.  Turns out Comcast thinks people in Sacramento are too dumb to hook up a Tivo themselves and doesn't even allow customers to hook it up themselves.  So I had to wait for an appointment, then let the high school dropout comcast tech in to my house.  I was not happy.   Edit: I got my first Tivo in 2001 and it was the first step toward cord cutting for me."
WarOnComcast,30p6nb,slick8086,-7,Mon Mar 30 02:04:14 2015 UTC,I saw the self install kit charge as an activation fee. I always told my customers for activating service.   But if you're transferring service then their should be only a small charge of a couple dollars to transfer service.

We do not know enough to get any conclusions from that.  There can be myriad reasons for that speed.  Make no mistake, I am no fan of Comcast but there is little reason to suppose they are blocking you.    I use Comcast and I actually do a lot of uploading for various reasons and I regularly check the speeds.  Comcast is delivering what they promise (for me at least).

You have written your congressman 300 times this year and the poor aide that is forced to read them rolls their eyes every time. I don't mean to make it personal, I've dealt with people like you in a related industry and the way people like you take up grievances does nothing but cause friction to getting the problem solved to the point where you basically have to wipe your hands of it and escalate to somebody that can appease you, but in this case it's not possible because you are talking about all these external things that they have no influence over.  You have a legitimate grievance with Comcast billing, your email got phished or hacked by this guy and they had run off your account. They should take have taken care of those fraudulent comcast charges and reset the homepage for you too, on the first call. Comcast is a shitty company for not doing that. The rest is on you. You don't seem to understand how this hack happened, it didn't need to be a virus, your password just had to be compromised in some way. They get your email, your email links all of your accounts in some way. There is no mystery here, nothing to solve or report to the general public. the police report is useful, the documentation is useful. It's a fucked up situation and is the worst thing that can happen to you on the internet, but other than being the initial way they made these Comcast charges, it's inconsequential to the general case against comcast. this will happen to any webmail out there the same way.   This is conjecture, but I have this sneaking suspicion, just from knowing your type, that you see it as all related and want Comcast to take care of everything that has occurred because of this like banking and other accounts. And you will bring it up every call, talk about recording calls and reporting what they say to the attorney general, local news, and your local church. And you won't let them fix their part effectively. You will just pile on factual, but COMPLETELY IRRELEVANT proof that they give zero shits about. Like I'm imagining you were on the phone with comcast for 5 hours trying to prove to them that Norton and MBAM said you were virus free and that this somehow changes the situation. You're putting out theories that it's a rogue Comcast agent that they have in some way acknowledged it when they would absolutely never acknowledge that. All those things, as someone in customer service, sets off by bullshit'o'meter and simultaneously makes me not want to deal with you any more, because you are a pain in the ass that is going to misquote me and try to lead me into making promises or assumptions that will backfire.

What if the hackers were able to aquire something like a social security number, or a form of ID such as a drivers license and they're using that to use social engineering in order to call comcast to reset your password. Just because your computers are virus free, doesn't mean that the hackers haven't already taken what they need to reset your password or change your information without your consent.  Another situation: What if the hackers have hacked your email. You change your password, they go back to the site, reset the password again, and delete the confirmation email that's sent to your inbox.  You need to think outside the little world that you think of how thing works, and open your mind to the possibility that you may have overlooked something. Let me leave you with one final ""for instance"" thought: You think that your email is safe (You've formatted your computers, replaced the hard drives, changed all your passwords and security questions), but they've hacked your phone and added in a way to remotely monitor and access your email. All of what you did is outside the scope of what you did. Even though you believe you've thought of everything...you've missed something. Just open up your mind to the possibility that this was something on your end (Whether it be you opened up a bad link on your phone, you left your ID at a bus stop, and someone took a photo of it before returning it to you...etc...)."
WarOnComcast,2zujs1,RockyK,-5,Sun Mar 22 02:21:08 2015 UTC,"How come Comcast allows social engineering? How are the hackers able to ""reset the password again"" after the security team assured me only they would be able to reset it. How was the billing name on my account changed if you need to visit a office in person with an id with the name you wish to switch to? You're theorys have big holes."
WarOnComcast,2zujs1,RockyK,5,Sun Mar 22 02:39:50 2015 UTC,"what you ""need"" to do and what you can do are two totally different things.  social engineering is about making the other party feel pity for your position and allowing you to bypass certain rules and regulations to help you out. So it could be as simple as the ""hacker"" calling up and pretending to be you on the phone, complaining about this entire mess (just like you) and acting like he just wants to get his password reset so he can pay his bill (you think they wont bend over backwards when he says he wants to pay the bill?)  Also, maybe it was somehting as simple as getting access to your email account. He doesn't have to use your email, just have access to it. Now he can abuse CS, use your email to ""verify"" while deleting all those incoming emails before you see them. Same thing happened to a buddies Steam account, they got his gmail and used that to bypass support.  So what it sounds like you need to do, is make a new email with new password, attach that to your comcast account, which itself has a new never before used password, and both have never before used security questions and no attachment to old information. this should in theory fix any phishing/hacking attempts unless you have a rootkit on your PC or you are getting hit in drive-bys on sites  the more i scroll thru your links, the more it looks like a personal vendetta against you by some bored kid on /b/ as its the exact kind of shit we use to do. Your email accounts are compromised, not just your Comcast account."

WarOnComcast,2zujs1,thardoc,8,Sun Mar 22 01:09:48 2015 UTC,"Hey Bill!  I wanted to jump in here and give my two cents on the issue. I'm very passionate about networking and security and I believe my feedback could really help you here. First, and most importantly, I believe there's one or more individuals that keep getting access to your accounts and causing you grief, not an organization like ISIS or the US Government, and specifically, not Comcast. It's important to understand this because you will need to take steps to secure your information from other individuals.  From an IT standpoint, you are extremely vulnerable to ""hacks"" like the ones you have been experiencing. Windows XP is no longer supported by Microsoft, so there may be additional security vulnerabilities that don't exist in a supported OS like Windows 7 or 8/8.1. Upgrading your OS to a more recent one is one of the best things you can do to protect yourself.  From just visiting your website, I know your full name, date of birth, physical mailing address, social security number, two separate email addresses you use, phone number, what websites you are signed up for, who you bank with, and even some of your friends or relatives names. This makes it so easy to ""hack"" you, having all this information publicly available is doing you no favors. Someone has taken this information and has used it to falsely order things in your name.  What you need to do from here to protect yourself from future attacks:   Delete all of the sensitive information on your website. This includes most of the pictures and some text. If you must keep records of everything, store them offline so they cannot be accessed by third parties. You may even want to delete that website entirely and create a new one with a different hosting provider. Hostgator has been good to me in the past and I recommend them if you can't find one yourself. Make new accounts on all the websites you use. Start with a new email address that doesn't look like the other two you have posted here. Delete all of your old accounts, even Facebook and LinkedIn, and create new ones using the new email address you just made. Request replacements for your identification. New social security card, drivers license, switch to a new bank account with a new account number as well. Upgrade your operating system to reduce security vulnerabilities. I alluded to this earlier, but Windows XP is no longer supported by Microsoft, so there may be security holes. Upgrade to a current OS like Windows 7 or Windows 8.1. Explain that you didn't order these services. You will need to make support tickets with sites you've received things from, including Comcast, Amazon, and if there are fraudulent charges on your bank account, with your bank. Your identity has been stolen and you need to go through the mess the thieves have left. Finally, don't make the same mistakes. You don't need to have a virus on your computer or a leaked password when you make information like this public. Anyone can figure out your passwords when you present all of your personal information in one easy-to-access hub.    I'm sorry that everyone else in this thread has chosen to ignore the larger message here and focus on why they shouldn't take you seriously. This is not reflective of professionals in my field and I truly apologize for the lack of help you have received thus far. I realize this message is quite long, so I apologize if it's a lot to read. I hope you take this message to heart and work to improve your own security by following the steps I outlined here. Let me know if you have any questions about the information I covered here, or if there's anything else I can help with."

Anyone at all can say ""I'm a Comcast employee and I'm holding your account hostage"" but it doesn't make it true.

Because I'm fundamentally torn over this issue. On one hand I want this problem to get worse, to the degree that the only available recourse is to have comcast torn up by the root, burned, and the ashes pissed on. On the other hand, having someone actively working on fixing comcast's problems alleviates suffering that actual people are going through. But I'm incredibly dubious of this idea, because I have a feeling that this is just comcast's attempt to try and placate the populace just enough to keep on fucking them. When working with comcast I've learned that one must always assume that they are more evil than the most evil thing imaginable, so as not to get caught off gaurd by how malicious they are. Keeping this in mind I've decided that comcast is playing at the longer game of placating the populace just enough to allow them to sneak a couple more inches into our collective asses. This being said, I've decided I must hate you for being a comcast shill.  Thanks for the talk, it really helped me out."
WarOnComcast,2z5v9k,nerdburg,5,Mon Mar 16 02:41:14 2015 UTC,"I think you're giving Comcast waaaay to much credit. For one, they would never bother placing a shill on Reddit because they simply don't give a shit. It's easy to interpret the things Comcast does as some type of malice. Comcast does so many horrible things to its own customers that it flies in the face of reason. I mean really how is this company still in business? They make colossally bad decisions one on top of the other, particularly in the customer service area. Why? Because they really truly and honestly don't give a shit. It's not exactly malice on the part of Comcast that they treat people so badly, it's more of an intentional indifference and incompetence. Although, the executives are generally baby eating Satan's spawn.  Make customer service centers that are worse than the DMV? Check  Outsource the call centers so angry customers can't even understand the reps? Check  Outsource the chat to even worse reps and make them handle multiple customers? Check  Close convenient local service centers? Check  Have a kludge of a phone system that drops calls for no reason after having customers on hold for an eternity? Check  Have poorly trained tech support that tries to upsell to already angry/frustrated customers? Check  Have the most fucked up billing system that even the reps don't understand half the time? Check  Randomly bill thousands of customer rental fees for their own equipment for years? Check  Have a convoluted system of promo rates and packages that differ geographically and even for the same customer online or over the phone? Check  Add fees for absolutely no reason whatsoever? (HD Fee anyone?) Check  Add some data cap bullshit for no reason other than to make more money on top of incredibly overpriced internet service? Check etc....  Comcast gets away with this because they have a simple business plan. They sell what people want. There isn't anything that Comcast sells that you can't get elsewhere. Just about everyone can get TV, Internet, phone and home security services from other sources. Comcast has a philosophy of early adoption of technology so they have what customers want. They strive to have the most channels, the fastest internet, the most sports programing etc because they know customers will pay for entertainment. No matter how shitty Comcast is or how horrible the economy, people will pay for entertainment. Hell they pioneered the ""dual revenue"" idea of charging people for TV service and getting advertising revenue at the same time...and consumers just accepted the idea.  Anyhow...I'm just a volunteer mod on the official Comcast forums and I enjoy helping people navigate the hell that is Comcast. Please don't hate me.

WarOnComcast,2z5v9k,ZiggyTheHamster,6,Mon Mar 16 22:35:17 2015 UTC,"I had a similar experience, only fewer people were affected than in your case OP.  Several years I had my Comcast internet and cable go out suddenly. Rebooting shit didn't help, so I called support. After all the usual bullshit on their end they finally sent a signal down and didn't get anything back. They sent someone out a couple of days later, and he discovered that the idiot technician before him had disconnected my connection while connecting someone else. Innocent, but incompetent and very annoying, mistake.  But disconnecting EVERYONE? How the hell did he do such a thing and not notice!  I swear, I don't know how most of the Comcast techs I've encountered even manage to wipe their own asses, let alone drive a vehicle or operate electronic tools. I had one guy pull some excess coaxial cable down from my attic because he thought the extra length was degrading the signal. In the process he ripped a huge hole in my living room drywall. Did it fix the bad signal? Nope. Just left me with yet another mess to deal with!"
WarOnComcast,2z5v9k,Geohump,5,Sun Mar 15 21:56:00 2015 UTC,I have never had a cable repair guy come to work on my connections who knew more than I did.  I have never called cable tech support and dealt with a person who knew more than I did.  And I say that noting my networking skills are pretty good but not exceptional.  Their workers are trained to put the square peg in the square hole.  If that doesn't work they are lost and will invariably blame it on something else or blame it on you.  I once had very intermittent and slow connection speeds.  Over the course of three months I had five or six techs out to see the problem.  They ALL saw the problem.  They ALL agreed it was not my fault.  They ALL agreed I should be getting a substantially better connection yet NOT ONE ever resolved the problem (that was on DSL...switched to cable).
WarOnComcast,2z5v9k,nbx909,8,Mon Mar 16 02:40:14 2015 UTC,"I had this done to me recently. I approached the technician who was working on the node for another resident, as I watched him go to the junction box, do something, and my Internet went out. The man actually told me to call Comcast headquarters, that he couldn't do anything, and then walked away. Chicago suburb.  It was fixed the next week (""at the earliest possible opportunity,"" over 7 days without Internet)... no compensation. I have a home office I depend on and was forced to commute.  I think your only chance at having it fixed quickly or being compensated is to try and make a big deal out of it on social media. Negotiating directly with Comcast absolutely will not work, you'd be better off negotiating with ISIS. You have to go around them.  This will not change until a law is passed that requires uptime agreements and minimum rate of downtime compensation when uptime agreement is not met."
WarOnComcast,2z5v9k,xFiGGiE,6,Sun Mar 15 22:50:43 2015 UTC,"no compensation   Next time, keep records of it being down (could be as simple as Pingdom or New Relic hitting a dynamic DNS address that points at your computer), and then figure out what your agreement says about arbitration. Determine what they owe you (if you pay $34.99/mo like I do, they owe you $8.16 plus whatever you paid to commute; keep receipts), then call them and demand they credit you for the amount or you will {enter arbitration | file a claim in small claims court}. The 1st and 2nd level techs will immediately escalate you because they can't handle those type of problems. I would also be sure to record every call with them."

Once you get a Level 3 tech guy, have him tell you that there is nothing they can do and they will give you a competent person to get someone to come out and fix your shit.   I had a similar problem because when I move Time Warner fucked up my account and it take me 2 or 3 hours of cussing and threating to leave to finally get a Level 3 tech support guy to go, ""wtf? Those guys are idiots."" and give me the correct person.

WarOnComcast,2z3ram,DoktorLuciferWong,12,Sun Mar 15 07:13:46 2015 UTC,"It could be any number of things, some unrelated to Comcast.  Keeping it simple, I would run a few speed tests. One to Comcast's speed test, which is inside their own network. Contrast that against a few speed tests outside of Comcast's network, like http://speedtest.net/ and http://speedof.me/  If all three tests suck, then it could very well be your connection.  If all three tests look good and you haven't seen issues with other software, then it's likely not your connection nor Comcast's network. It may be something out there between you and the Quake server or the Quake server, itself.  If Comcast's speed test looks good but one or more of the other tests suck, then it's likely congestion at the Comcast peering exchange point sitting between you and that particular testing server (where Comcast hands off your traffic to an Internet backbone.)"
WarOnComcast,2z3ram,nspectre,4,Sun Mar 15 07:51:08 2015 UTC,"If you haven't recently, reset your modem and router.   Are you using wireless? If so a new network may have appeared near you causing interference. You could check for a clearer channel.  Do you have this problem on more than one device?   If you feel like bring your head against the wall, you could call comcast and ask them to check from their end. Even if they say there is no problem (they will) having them re provision your modem may help. You may have to ask them to do that directly.  Good luck."

I pull 11.4MBytes/sec (91.2Mbit) when downloading over Steam (fastest I have benchmarked consistently).  I pull ~72Mbit when torrenting.  I attribute that difference to the nature of torrents and job control overhead.  I have seen no indication that Comcast has throttled me in my area.  They do suck for many other reasons, however."

WarOnComcast,2z3ram,Stone-Bear,0,Sun Mar 15 18:25:06 2015 UTC,I don't think bandwidth has anything to do with. I think Comcast probably has oversaturated their routers or something which causes delays. I have the same issue with TWC. I used to have 30ms ping in games and now it's 60 or 70 at best.

WarOnComcast,2yug7o,nerdburg,10,Fri Mar 13 02:04:29 2015 UTC,I think many people would be happy to sue Comcast. I would guess the reason most people don't bother is that the claims would be very small. What damages would they hope to recover?   So really this would just be a way to stick it to Comcast and make lawyers $? Probably in most cases customers hate Comcast more than lawyers.
WarOnComcast,2yug7o,_FreeThinker,10,Fri Mar 13 00:17:52 2015 UTC,"Yes.  The claims are small, which is why most people don't pursue anything and just let themselves get shafted by Comcast.    That is why consumer protection laws are so beautiful.  The wronged consumer can hire an attorney to assert their rights, and not have to worry about paying all those fees and costs.    Yes, as I said, I thought of it as a business idea.  I wish I could be Super-Anti-Comcast man, but I need to make a living too.   In a good case, the consumer would get their money back (whatever it might be), and perhaps additional damages (which would likely be small, given the circumstances).  So, really, yes, I would need a large client base would really cares about screwing Comcast over, and changing the legal landscape for these kinds of scumbag companies.   I totally get your skepticism, though.  Many people might just see it as a hassle to get their $80 back . . . just to enrich a lawyer.

WarOnComcast,2yug7o,pueblokc,3,Fri Mar 13 10:08:37 2015 UTC,"It is extremely difficult to invalidate an arbitration clause.   In fact, as far as I know, you can only invalidate one if the clause itself is unconscionable or illegal.    There is nothing unconscionable or illegal about the clause Comcast includes (as far as I can tell, and, remember, this isn't my practice area, so I might be missing something).    So, the only solution I know of is to opt out of the arbitration clause in the first place to protect your right to the civil court."
WarOnComcast,2yug7o,supergalactic,2,Fri Mar 13 16:07:42 2015 UTC,"Can you argue that it's unconscionable to force someone to settle before a disagreement has been made? Anyways we could use more people at /r/bindingarbitration  Also, can you argue that because they didn't provide a means to opt on in the same way they allowed service to be rendered, it provided an unnecessary burden to the user beyond which is reasonable?  For example, it wouldn't be reasonable for me to demand that you settle any disputes with the gasoline company by being forced to buy a horse when you can use your car, and you have gas (Bad analogy, but I can't think of a better one right now).  Similarly, making someone mail something before you have a disagreement means nothing. There's nothing preventing a binding arbitration agreement after either party is in a disagreement."

WarOnComcast,2yug7o,Amadameus,1 point,Sat Mar 14 04:34:49 2015 UTC,"Be vigilant.  When signing up for anything, cell phone service, internet, credit cards, read through the contract and see if there is an arbitration clause.  If there is, then see if you can opt out of it.  If you can opt out of it, do it (unless you don't care about preserving your right to the court).   In cases where you can't opt out, and the arbitration clause itself is enforceable, consumers are pretty powerless.  It sucks to say it, but it's the hard truth. To change that, it's a matter of talking to your political representatives, and persuading them to change the law to invalidate binding arbitration clauses.  That seems futile, though, too, because you'll probably only get a form letter back, and you aren't contributing $10,000 to their re-election campaign.  ""The Perfect Case.""  There might be a perfect case one day that could overturn those previous decisions.  Those don't come around very often, though.    Anyway, it's tough.  The legal landscape isn't very consumer friendly, even when a company has violated some very serious legal rights.  It's just the landscape right now."

WarOnComcast,2yug7o,Uplus00A9,7,Fri Mar 13 00:14:17 2015 UTC,"In these types of cases, I would probably do it by means of ""fee shifting.""  Even with exemplary damages, the amount in controversy would be prohibitively small.  For a $100 controversy, for example, I might put 20 hours into it, and only earn $33.33.   However, I could bill my hourly rate to Comcast (assuming we win, and I would only take good cases).  Not a bad way to stick it to 'em.    A contingency fee case would work in a class action suit; however, Comcast's grievances are so varied that it would be difficult (maybe impossible) to qualify a class."

WarOnComcast,2yug7o,jungleboogiemonster,3,Fri Mar 13 14:15:47 2015 UTC,"Because state legislatures have said so, and common law contract principles say so as well.    It is part of a contract.  When you signed up for Comcast, you agreed to the clause.  You weren't forced to, and, whether you read it or not, it was there, and you had the right to hire an attorney to review it for you.    From a morality standpoint:  I think arbitration clauses between corporations and businesses that negotiate about them beforehand, and purposefully agree to include them in their contract, are good.  When big companies have a dispute, they can resolve it outside of court, which is good.   When it comes to corporations and  an individual consumer, I think they are total bullshit.  The consumer has no power to negotiate a contract.  It's take it or leave it.  In the modern world where internet is a necessity for daily life, most people have no choice but to take it, and thereby sacrifice their rights to the civil court.  It is actually a really disturbing legal trend.  The civil court is one of the only places where an individual person can truly confront someone (or some organization or business) who is much more powerful and otherwise untouchable.   The civil courts levels the playing  field.   Further, lobbying by big companies has influenced tort reform in many states as well, which has, in turn, capped or otherwise limited plaintiff recovery in a lot of cases.  By limiting plaintiff recovery, you dissuade attorneys from taking even legitimate cases.  People criticize attorneys for just being greedy sonsofbitches, and maybe some are, but, the cold hard fact is that if I am going to spend 3 years of my life risking my livelihood and my business on a big lawsuit that might never pay out, then I need a pretty big incentive--the contingency fee and a good recovery.  That's how it works.  People expect lawyers to work for free, and I find that ridiculous.  Would they be willing to sacrifice everything and make nothing for three years on something that might never pay out?  I doubt it.    I recommend you buy or rent ""Hot Coffee.""  It is a documentary that explores all of these ideas, and discuss them from the perspective of the famous McDonald's hot coffee case.  It exposes the lies, the deceptions, and how McDonald's was truly negligent and responsible for 3rd degree burns!  It wasn't just some frivolous lawsuit.  However, by way of settlement, McDonald's required a non-disclosure agreement, meaning that the plaintiff could not share her side of the shore lest she forego her recovery.   What does this mean?  Big corporations can say whatever the hell they want, and they influence the message.  They can go on and on about ""sleazy lawyers"" and ""frivolous lawsuits"" and how ""businesses are being taken advantage of.""  When they control the message, they have much more influence over the law.    Anyway, I'll leave it at that.  Check  out that movie.  I think you can rend it On-Demand on Amazon."

We conclude that the best approach to achieving our open Internet goals is to rely on several, independent, yet complementary sources of legal authority. Our authority under Section 706 is not mutually exclusive with our authority under Titles II and III of the Act. Rather, we read our statute to provide independent sources of authority that work in concert toward common ends. Under section 706, the Commission has the authority to take certain regulatory steps to encourage and accelerate the deployment of broadband to all Americans. Under Title II, the Commission has authority to ensure that common carriers do not engage in unjust and unreasonable practices or preferences. And under Title III, the Commission has authority to protect the public interest through spectrum licensing.

Knowing the IP of the router the camera system is on (plus the ports it uses) or even if the piece of equipment has a public address (meaning it isn't behind another router creating a private network) means you can access that equipment from anywhere you have internet access.  Most residential services use dynamic addresses that changing periodically depending on what your isp has set up. It could be 6 hours, it could be 24 hrs.

Transferring a 5MB file at 1Gbps on Google Fiber wouldn't give any sort of accurate reading, but that same 5MB file at 2G mobile speeds like 1xRTT or EDGE would take a long time without giving much more info than a 1MB file would.  Also, since many wireline ISPs artificially inflate the initial speeds of downloads (like Comcast with SpeedBoost) the transfers have to be large enough to get past that and ignore the initial data for networks like that."

A better test that you should run today, just so you could really see the difference VPN makes:  1) Play netflix without VPN and with VPN. Big difference. Netflix also offers a test video in HD,which I believe isn't buffered on purpose and I never have that video play smoothly off VPN.  2) Run the famous speedtest.net on and off VPN.

No one is getting a free ride here.  Comcast just wants to charge Netflix extra because they can.  Comcast is not providing anything extra.  Just for a price they agree to not slow them down.  Comcast is trying to hold Netflix over a barrel because Comcast controls the last mile (basically the connection to customers' homes).  They want to act as a gatekeeper deciding what data gets through and what doesn't (or what data gets delayed and slowed down).  So, for instance, Comcast owns NBC.

They have been accused, and it has been shown (though they never admitted it) that they were slowing the connection to netflix. Netflix is a direct competitor with their video on demand service. It only makes business sense to discourage the competition and encourage your own services.  Even more than this, what other reason is there for getting rid of net neutrality than doing things like this.  Edit, re-read your question.  Bandwidth is bandwidth. 1gb of data is 1 gb of data, no matter where it comes from. As technology advances the transmission cost per mb goes down, due to the better server capabilities. The actual transmission of data is only a small portion of the cost of providing internet service. Increased bandwidth consumption is an increased cost for the ISP, but a small one. Add to this Comcast is setting record profit levels and the argument does not hold water."
WarOnComcast,2y4ggy,vanwe,1 point,Fri Mar 6 12:16:30 2015 UTC,"Fast lanes would be completely acceptable in my mind if it means that a 50/10 connection you buy from them gets everything at 50Mbps, except a few things which get designated fast lanes that are, say, 300Mbps.  Making everything else slower isn't exactly what a fast lane means - that's just a regular lane and you're covering everyone else's lanes with tar and nails."
WarOnComcast,2y4ggy,tangerinelion,1 point,Sat Mar 7 00:48:05 2015 UTC,"Both would technically be considered fast lanes. So long as some sites have faster speed than others, that is a fast lane whether you get there by speeding up some sites or by degrading most sites."
WarOnComcast,2y4ggy,vanwe,2,Sat Mar 7 14:14:40 2015 UTC,"I've used this YT to explain to FB friends who do not understand Net Neutrality, or who did not want it .. after they seen it, they understand it better.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rz4Ej3IVefo"
WarOnComcast,2y4ggy,Joshatdot,2,Fri Mar 6 23:39:29 2015 UTC,"Ok, so here's the thing: The bandwidth argument is mostly null and void on this issue.  Comcast and other ISPs aren't arguing that they want people to pay for the amount of bandwidth that they use. Comcast and other ISPs want to impose the fee based on what services they use.  Hypothetically, let's say that we have Service A and Service B, and they both use the same amount of bandwidth. Without net neutrality, Comcast would be able to cut a deal with Service A, where A pays extra money and therefore gets its content delivered to consumers at faster speeds. Service B, meanwhile, remains at the same speeds, or worse, gets its speed downgraded or is ignored when Comcast upgrades its internet pipelines because it's not paying the extra amount.  The result is more people end up using Service A because it's easier to access because Comcast is giving it priority through its pipes, while Service B gradually looses customers because its service is less reliable, again because of Comcast.  This essentially allows big ISPs like Comcast to decide what content we have access to on the internet, which gives them a frightening amount of control over the flow of information in this country. Especially since there are really only 4 or 5 major ISPs in America (not counting wireless service, as it's not truly High Speed Internet yet), that concentrates a lot of power in very few companies."
WarOnComcast,2y4ggy,Droid2Win,2,Fri Mar 13 22:18:53 2015 UTC,"Hey, thanks for replying. With all the replies in the thread I see good reason to not allow Comcast to have a tiered internet structure."
WarOnComcast,2y4ggy,DigitalGarden,2,Fri Mar 13 22:20:59 2015 UTC,"Ok, let's say that I provide a service to you- like I make you a hat.   Let's say that, including labor, the hat costs me $5 to produce. I sell it for $10.  You buy the hat. The trick is that UPS doesn't tell you how much I was charging you for the hat. They instead have been charging you a flat amount a month for deliveries ($20). You, on average, use about $3 a month of delivery services- but you don't know this, UPS doesn't tell you. They make $17 profit off of you every month.   You have no way to tell how much I charged for the hat- all you see is the bill from Comcast. They charge you that $20 flat rate. They give me $10, keep $10, and end up with $7 profit for the transaction.   Now, let's say that everyone wants a hat, so UPS starts noticing that 80% of their deliveries are hats.  They want to charge you more for buying hats instead of scarves or shoes or anything else you might buy.   They say it is because it takes up a lot of the delivery trucks for them to deliver hats.   Why do they care what you order? How do they know what is in the box?  They make the same amount of money no matter what is in the box. If the box is empty or contains porno mags or DVDs or shoes or a hat, it is all the same to them. They make the same money off of you either way ($7/month).   What Comcast has been doing is tracing where your packages come from, assuming the contents based on the source (it came from Netflix, so it must be streaming data) (or maybe they are opening the packets and looking at them? Even worse), and then bullying Netflix into paying them in order for their packets to get delivered appropriately.  Working this into the analogy, it would be like UPS delaying all the packages from hat companies until the hat companies pay up.   Comcast is doing some blackmail-mafia-type shit over here.   And guess what?  Now they want to charge you on top of your normal delivery fee if you want to receive your package. When the delivery guy comes up to the door, if he sees the return address comes from a hat company, he charges you another fee on top of your normal fee.   Yeah, Netflix takes up more of the internet packets, but why does it matter who the sender is? If you get 10 packages a month from UPS of the same size and weight, why should UPS charge you more because of who it comes from? It doesn't cost them any more to deliver it, they are charging you more just because they can."
WarOnComcast,2y4ggy,tangerinelion,1 point,Fri Mar 6 19:58:08 2015 UTC,"Looking at packets (Deep-Packet Inspection) puts ISPs in a very tricky situation.  If they uncover something illegal, like child porn, they're now obligated to report it or can be held liable for it.  This is an excellent argument for not looking at the packets, and actually mandating that ISPs are to operate as a dumb telecom provider.  It provides a pipe between A and B, that's it."
WarOnComcast,2y4ggy,DigitalGarden,2,Sat Mar 7 00:50:30 2015 UTC,"Good point.    It isn't just about the expectation of privacy, it is about what is done with the information.

Just wondering the sales rep kept saying I shouldn't see congestion/speed drops during peak hours. Is this true? I notice it here and there but I'm on a 50/15 rate anyway so a drop to 30 isn't really noticeable unless I'm downloading a game. I just feel like if they aren't on separate lines how can they prevent this or do they just control the data to prioritize your speed vs normal customers.

I just can't wait until I don't have to think about the impact downloading something might have on my cap. I bought a game a few months back and I was already near my cap and was about to reset.

It's a great time to be a techie but it certainly had it drawbacks right now. Honestly, I wouldn't even be too mad at a cap if it were reasonable (2-3 TBs/60$). Sure there are a bunch of people who can go over that no problem but I think even a family of 4 could easily stay under that for the most part. Then after it would be dirt cheap, 10$/TB."

As someone who only uses Netflix for TV at 4k, plus digital games, I'll blow through the 300gb cap and I'd expect to probably pay ~120 with overage costs.  I can get business 50/15 for 110 and not have a cap plus no line congestion during peak hours.   This is stupid that I should have to do this but this is the best option with what is available to me.

WarOnComcast,2xowik,PixelVector,5,Mon Mar 2 18:46:20 2015 UTC,"I don't think the merger is that important, tbh. Yeah, both companies suck tremendously, and are in areas with no competition. This is not going to be fixed by having them as separate companies nor will it be fixed with the merger. This is not like T-Mobile and AT&T, where the merger was going to significantly reduce competition and it was going to allow a cheaper, more consumer friendlier company to merge with AT&T. Also, when that merger fell, T-Mobile got access to spectrum and money which then allowed them to compete."

WarOnComcast,2xowik,zdroj,3,Tue Mar 3 03:16:40 2015 UTC,"Let them merge at this point, and let the impending local competition hit their gigantic, unresponsive company at all sides.  Also, who wants to start an ISP?"
WarOnComcast,2xowik,crawsome,9,Mon Mar 2 19:01:11 2015 UTC,"It would still be prohibitively expensive for someone to just set up an ISP. The Net Neutrality ruling did not change anything at all. Which was the point. What it did was set the rules for what the ISPs were trying to do, which was discriminate data traffic. They are now expressly not allowed to discriminate traffic. That was pretty much it.  It did not force them to let anyone else use their lines. It did not change any state or local laws that prohibit municipal ISPs. It didn't even do anything to create or foster competition. That all still has to be tackled."
WarOnComcast,2xowik,earthwormjim91,3,Mon Mar 2 19:17:36 2015 UTC,"Wasn't there something that would stop states from banning municipal ISPs?

I mean, it's still expensive, but now it's doable because many times new ISPs weren't allowed to install the customer network."

As I understand it, only ensures that new broadband providers are allowed to use the same poles and conduits, not the same lines. So any new ISP would have to come up with the capital to lay those lines. I could be wrong on this though.  I think the state bans are being challenged, but nothing has been ruled yet, as I understand. The FCC doesn't have any pull over the legality of municipal bans. That would have to be a court ruling. The FCC did overturn some state bans, but it relies on some unprecedented legality, and will certainly be challenged. Municipalities would still have to raise funding to lay out entire infrastructures though, so even if it all sticks it won't be an overnight thing. Could be really good news for municipalities that are sitting on dark fiber lines because of state laws."

WarOnComcast,2xowik,earthwormjim91,3,Mon Mar 2 23:17:26 2015 UTC,"I agree it didn't change much right now, but it changed the direction of the internet. Cable companies are trying hard to be more than just dumb pipes for the internet, and they want to continue to get revenue of content distribution. What was happening with Netflix was a clear picture that Cable companies, due to the lack of competition they experience, were willing to stop their customers from using different sources of content by means (caps and throttle). Net neutratily ensures these means are not longer fair game."
WarOnComcast,2xowik,unfortunatebastard,3,Mon Mar 2 23:47:32 2015 UTC,"Agreed. It did major things in regard to content discrimination, which was becoming a thing.

WarOnComcast,2xowik,earthwormjim91,2,Mon Mar 2 23:56:16 2015 UTC,"The internet should be abstract, and from the perspective of the ISPs, all data should be delivered equally.

WarOnComcast,2xowik,PartyLogic,2,Mon Mar 2 22:30:30 2015 UTC,"Like I said in another comment, I could be wrong. As that article states though, all of this is relying on untested legal precedence and will certainly face judicial opposition.  Even the last paragraph of that article states:   The FCC is also scheduled to vote today on reclassifying Internet service providers as common carriers under Title II of the Communications Act. Title II includes authority to preempt state laws that prohibit the ability of ""any entity"" to provide telecommunications. But this authority has already been tested, with the Supreme Court in 2004 agreeing with the FCC that ""any entity"" only referred to private entities.   Bolded emphasis mine. So depending on who challenges it, and what gets ruled, it could very well only apply to private companies, not municipal internet.  I support what the FCC has done with this, but the fight isn't over and there is still a lot that needs to be done to reverse what the big cable companies have done. This recent ruling was still mostly a preventative measure to keep the Internet traffic how it has always been, and that is to treat it all equally."

WarOnComcast,2xowik,earthwormjim91,1 point,Mon Mar 2 23:08:53 2015 UTC,"wow, does this article author miss the forest for the trees.     merger complaints are generally about fears related to net neutrality, wired data caps, and discouraging municipal broadband.  all 3 are being addressed by separate FCC proposals - and once each issue has been ruled on in support of consumers and to promote competition, there will be little need left to block a merger, so at this point all sides are simply playing for time."

AS A RESULT, IT IS LIKELY THAT HISTORY WILL JUDGE TODAY'S ACTIONS AS MISGUIDED. THE FCC'S MOVE IS ESPECIALLY REGRETTABLE BECAUSE IT IS WHOLLY UNNECESSARY. THE FCC HAD TARGETED TOOLS AVAILABLE TO PRESERVE AN OPEN INTERNET, BUT INSTEAD CHOSE TO USE THIS ORDER AS AN EXCUSE TO ADOPT 300-PLUS PAGES OF BROAD AND OPEN-ENDED REGULATORY ARCANA THAT WILL HAVE UNINTENDED NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES FOR CONSUMERS AND VARIOUS PARTS OF THE INTERNET ECOSYSTEM FOR YEARS TO COME.

Lewis and Owen Barfield, describing the erroneous argument (usually considered an outright fallacy) that the thinking, art, or science of an earlier time is inherently inferior to that of the present, simply by virtue of its temporal priority. As Barfield explains it, it is the belief that ""intellectually, humanity languished for countless generations in the most childish errors on all sorts of crucial subjects, until it was redeemed by some simple scientific dictum of the last century.""  The subject came up between them when Barfield had converted to Anthroposophy and was persuading Lewis (an atheist at that time) to join him. One of Lewis's objections was that religion was simply outdated, and in Surprised by Joy (chapter 13, p. 207-208) he describes how this was fallacious:     Interesting: Appeal to novelty | Argumentum ad populum | Snob | List of fallacies   Parent commenter can toggle NSFW or delete.

And if you really read that article (and any others) it does not state that anybody outside of the FCC saw the document.  It is absolutely normal for the commissioners to discuss specific issues with industry. That's entirely what the comment period is all about! That's why the large incumbent carriers and Google and others had large teams of engineers and lawyers, et al, submitting massive detailed documents with graphs and charts and law and proposed law and arguments for and against and numbers on how stuff might hurt them or help them and on and on and on.  People and companies who've been scrutinizing the issues and the proposals and the court cases and the commissioners statements over the past years know what issues are in those documents. They just don't exactly what's in those documents (and relatively few of those pages are going to be the set-in-stone roman numeraled Rules. A lot of it is going to be explanatory verbiage, references to case law, justifications, etc, etc.)  So, no. Google didn't get to see the document. But you know that they and lots of other players on the field were consulted. The commissioners, I believe, have said as much. The FCC does work with the industries it regulates, as it should.    As an aside, if you want a perplexing chuckle, go read up on what the FCC comment period is actually for and what the FCC expects to get out of it.  You know those 4 million public submissions we're all woo-hoo'ing and slapping ourselves on the back about? I believe a massive, massive number of them were not at all applicable to the meaning and purpose of the comment period. Very, very, very few of them were of any use to the FCC in coming up with the gory details and nuts and bolts of an ""Open Internet Order"".  People thought it was a ""vote"". They were sending in their Yays and Nays and You Assholes Suck's. They were not sending in articulate, intelligent, detailed discussions on the pluses and minuses of the issues and how they effect them, good or bad.  The vast majority of our comments were little more than trash.

WarOnComcast,2x4bbk,KMustard,3,Thu Feb 26 00:11:29 2015 UTC,"I have no source to stand on, but I'd imagine its the latter of the two.  It just makes no sense for the first one to be the case, especially with the amount of public scrutiny being put on this bill.    Think of it like this:  Congressman A says we need a bill that bans rubber ducks from TV and congressman B supports this as well.  B and A bring it up at the next meeting and the bill is sent to the FCC to be drafted.  The FCC comes up with a preliminary set of guidelines that are to be followed by all TV networks and sends it to public comment.  The public then comes forth in an uproar about how rubber ducks shouldn't be banned from children's TV but is fine with everything else.  The FCC, taking this into consideration, then drafts a bill that bans all rubber ducks from all non-children's programming and then votes on whether or not they believe this bill would work (the current events being right around here).  They vote yes and invite all public comment on the bill again.  This process proceeds until the FCC believes the bill is sufficient and implementable and then has a final vote to implement the bill.  Again, this may be all bullshit and completely wrong, but I'd imagine it isn't far from what is happening.  To summarize, what I think is happening now is the FCC voting on whether or not they think the bill is good enough to be implemented and will be followed by a round of public comment/scrutiny."

WarOnComcast,2x4bbk,Howarthuk,3,Thu Feb 26 01:10:42 2015 UTC,"http://www.fcc.gov/encyclopedia/rulemaking-process-fcc  This is their official procedure.  See section 6 on rulemaking process.  As I understand it, there are three main phases to the procedure.    First (unwritten) the agency creates a proposal. Proposal is released to the public as an NPRM, ""Notice of Proposed Rulemaking"".  Public is allowed a period to issue comments concerning the rules. Final rule.  ""After the comment period closes and the Commission has reviewed and analyzed the comments received, we decide whether to proceed with the rulemaking we proposed, issue a new or modified proposal, or take no action on the proposal.""   Yes, unfortunately this doesn't really tell us that much.  It's not very clear to me what's going on right now.  But I'll try to reason about it.  The last proposal (famous 4 million comments) was published as an NPRM.  There's no good reason why they wouldn't publish another NPRM for an alternative set of rules.  However...   NPRM. In notice-and-comment rulemaking, an agency must first issue a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) and provide an opportunity for public comment on the proposal before it can issue a final rule. There are exceptions to the requirement for notice and comment. For example, notice and comment may be waived for âgood causeâ for such things as emergencies.   So there is a loophole in which they can skip NPRM.  While this could happen I have 0 supporting evidence to suggest that they are exploiting this now.  We also know that the current rules in question are Tom Wheeler's rules.  They are his proposal and it may be the case that the vote will be for the FCC to publish them as NPRM.  Or we've somehow skipped a bunch of steps and this is the vote for final rule.  I can't tell, but I should mention that in the history of the FCC no chairman has ever released their proposal to public eyes prior to vote.  This would support the claim that Net Neutrality opponents are trying to scare the public into believing that the FCC is scheming.  The only other thing that concerns me is that the word ""vote"" doesn't appear anywhere on the page.  It's not clear to me if there are two votes (to put the proposal into NPRM) or only on final rule."

In fact, myself and a buddy wired up Earthlink's first office in Atwater, CA when Sky Dayton moved Earthlink out of his living room. I've been relatively deep in this stuff for a long time.  I have lived through the days of punch cards, 300 baud acoustic couplers and teletypes. I was living in a world of dialup and Usenet and Telnet and Archie, Gopher, Veronica and Jughead when this cool thing called HTTP was proposed and NCSA Mosaic was released. My buddies and I instantly had web pages up with way too many Blink tags.  I was there for the AT&T breakup and the explosion of services, new businesses and 10-digit dial-your-own long distance. I enjoyed online services like Compuserve and AOL, The Source, Delphi and Genie. I enjoyed having numerous ISP's to choose from (Thanks Title II!). I ran my own BBS and FidoNet node and gatewayed a few newsgroups. I early-adopted new advances in modem technology as they came about (even given new modems because I ran a BBS. Thanks Zyxel and US Robotics!). I was all over DSL in leue of ISDN (couldn't afford that shit) when most people didn't even know the Internet existed.  I've watched the 'Net grow for over 20 years under Title II regulation and do just fine thank-you-very-much. I've watched Cable and QAM/DOCSIS hit the scene and become deregulated in 2002 (followed by DSL in 2005). I've watched wireless cell technology grow, under light-handed Title II regulation I should note.  I've read the FCC regs, in full. I've even printed some of them out and with colored pens red-lined the stuff not applicable to the Internet and gone over the rest, noting other specifics.  I am hard-core, fightin' mad, Pro-Net Neutrality principles and I'll pick up a Kentucky Long Rifle to defend it and the Internet.  The last 10 years have proven beyond any shadow of a doubt that the de-regulated ISP's cannot be trusted to manage themselves with any thought towards the common good. Ditto to the wireless companies.  The FCC is the appropriate body to drag these fuckers kicking and screaming back under Title II regulation. So they have my grudging and heavily scrutinized support.  To me, unsupported-by-evidence-or-history bitching and moaning and whining about ""Government Takeover"" and ""Power Grab"" and ""Impending Doom of Taxation"" just comes across as the ignorant blatherings of technically and historically uneducated dolts."

And you all want more regulation?  Are you fucking kidding me?  Get rid of the laws holding back competition and this will sort itself out."
WarOnComcast,2x10mr,fritnig,5,Wed Feb 25 01:47:04 2015 UTC,"The thing about adding competition is it's physically limited. Unless you want your phone poles to look like the tangled rats nest in Delhi... Which would of course impact the beauty of your neighborhood, and thus property values. Or worse yet, would involve companies trenching to lay fibre with no government requirements that they notify one another, document the locations of the cables, and do so at a reasonable time. At the end of the day some form of regulation is necessary to have efficient competition in this market simply because it's what economists call a natural monopoly due to physically limiting factors; similar to how it doesn't make sense to run multiple sets of power lines. In the 90s cable companies were required to lease lines to competitors (Which was how the phone market successfully became competitive), and that regulation eventually ended and competition dramatically decreased in that space. There's a middle ground between no regulation, and regulations that hurt competition; and that is regulations that promote competition.  And the other issue is we live in a world where politics are what they are, Comcast is already as big as they are; so realistically we still need to work within that framework. We don't live in a fantasy Lala land where things like that are going to change over night, or even in the space of a year. The thing is this issue has immediacy that an anarcho-capitalistic revolution just cannot offer period... Unless you want to get your gun and start shooting us dirty statists now? But I must warn you, I have one too, and I will shoot back."
WarOnComcast,2x10mr,JamesIsAwkward,1 point,Wed Feb 25 00:03:40 2015 UTC,"That would be ideal.  The problem comes when sufficiently large companies have the monetary, and therefore legislative, clout to prevent competition.  Cable companies have been endorsing laws banning municipal internet services and using those laws to prevent other companies from entering competition (mostly Google offering to front the cost for local fiber networks).  Getting rid of these laws requires (at least in Colorado) that the matter be put to a public vote, which requires a vote from local councils to pass first.  Barring legislative issues, the major players are already so big, they can just buy up competition or sublet portions of their market to smaller companies they effectively own.  Barrier to entry is pretty high for new ISPs that aren't willing to lay their own physical infrastructure.  More to the point of enforced net neutrality, though, consider that not-so-hypothetical circumstance where a competitor in one of Comcast's other services - streaming video, for example - was dominating the market for that service.  In this example, the second company is reliant on a separate service, coincidentally provided by Comcast.  Without this regulation, or something similar, in place, Comcast could arbitrarily limit or extort its competitor simply because it happened to be the only provider of a necessary resource.  The problem this is trying to address is that people would like oligopolies to be on a level playing field with Internet based services regardless of the fact that they control access to the data."
WarOnComcast,2x10mr,fritnig,1 point,Wed Feb 25 04:04:00 2015 UTC,Without the oligopoly creating laws Comcast wouldn't even exist. Competition would destroy anyone so unethical.
WarOnComcast,2x10mr,MINIMAN10000,1 point,Wed Feb 25 01:57:00 2015 UTC,But those laws did exist and now Comcast exists and has the clout to make sure it holds it's place in the market through purchasing power spent on legislature.   So title 2 creates some guidelines that they will have to follow. Unfortunately what I was hoping for - the resale of lines doesn't exist but it sounds like multiple lines can be put in place to a single house which is what was blocking competition from reaching my house.
WarOnComcast,2x10mr,fritnig,1 point,Wed Feb 25 02:09:49 2015 UTC,"I feel like a counter-example to this was the company that prompted the creation of anti-trust laws in the first place: Standard Oil.  Using a fair amount of money from previous (arguably ethical) business practices, the company engaged in massive horizontal integration of resources.  Since it controlled most of its own supply chain, it was able to drive out local competition by undercutting prices.  After eliminating competition (at this point without any legislative interference), they raised prices to well beyond their original point.  Since no competition remained, they were free to charge what they wished for fuel until legislation was passed to prevent this.  It's a clever, arguably unethical, strategy that was unable to be defeated by competition at the time.  There are also a few documented cases of the company buying out innovative competitors.    It's also a similar strategy to the one currently employed by OPEC, though the setting is a bit different."

Adjusted earnings per share of 77 cents matched analysts' consensus estimates. The estimates ranged from 76 cents to 81 cents, as compiled by Zacks Investment Research.  Comcast shares rose 1.3% to $58.96.  Operating revenue rose 4.8% to $17.7 billion.""  http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2015/02/24/comcast-2014-q4-earnings/23906839/"

I had a serious issue with TWC when I got a TiVo a few years ago, they made it all but impossible to get the cable card and tuning adapter activated, even after 2 weeks of trying.  After complaining to the FCC, I got a call in 2 days from their executive customer relations department, and had everything working within an hour.  Do yourself a favor first though and try and isolate all the variables first.  I had intermittent internet issues with TWC a few months ago.  I basically dragged my cable modem to the attic where the feed from them comes directly into the house, and the issues persisted.  I then did the same thing with one of my TiVos, and got similar signal issues.  After explaining on the phone to the reps that multiple pieces of equipment experienced signal issues on the feed directly from them into the house, they dispatched a tech and discovered the neighborhood node was at fault.  Everything was fixed within 72 hours (I'm sure my neighbors had similar issues and were glad it mysteriously ""fixed itself"")."

If you have one of their awful all in one modem/router combos, kick that hunk of crap to the curb (take it back), and purchase your own modem and router and learn how to configure your router.

Improperly made fittings can also screw with the signal. If the white di-electric isn't flush with the bottom of the cap you might want to have it remade. If it were me I'd re-set all the fittings and run new lines of they were old.   But with Comcast, just keep bitching and speaking to the managers. Don't take no for an answer. You have a contract with them for internet that doesn't drop out. The internet drops out. You got a valid argument that won't go away until the internet gets better."

Your mistake is assuming that ""comcast"" is a single entity.   As a lot of media stories have documented, ""Comcast"" is an agglormeration of dozens of regional companies that have been strung together through mergers, and that corporate HQ attempts, and fails, to make dance to the same tune.   Add in that they have partially centralized call centers, and that different department's call centers might be in entirely different regions (or different countries for that matter), you get a lot of these results with one person getting one result and another person getting a different result.   Policies are told to the workers inconsistently, and workers follow the policies inconsistently.   From media reports, many workers wills straight up lie for their own ends (to meet workplace metrics).   OP happened to get a worker who had been told the policy is ""no reductions below market rate"" and because he wasn't in retention, he wasn't authorized to change OP's rate, so he just processed the cancellation.   that worker doesn't know what is better for Comcast, nor likely, does he really care.

WarOnComcast,2vuccs,trivialretort,3,Sat Feb 14 06:13:21 2015 UTC,"IMHO, I would suggest...  Opt the fuck out of Comcast's Binding Arbitration Provision within 30 days.  Comcast Agreement for Residential Services  Section 13: BINDING ARBITRATION   a. Purpose. If you have a Dispute (as defined below) with Comcast that cannot be resolved through an informal dispute resolution with Comcast, you or Comcast may elect to arbitrate that Dispute in accordance with the terms of this Arbitration Provision rather than litigate the Dispute in court. Arbitration means you will have a fair hearing before a neutral arbitrator instead of in a court by a judge or jury. Proceeding in arbitration may result in limited discovery and may be subject to limited review by courts.  b. Definitions. The term âDisputeâ means any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Comcast regarding any aspect of your relationship with Comcast, whether based in contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, tort (including, but not limited to, fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, negligence, or any other intentional tort), or any other legal or equitable theory, and includes the validity, enforceability or scope of this Arbitration Provision. âDisputeâ is to be given the broadest possible meaning that will be enforced. As used in this Arbitration Provision, âComcastâ means Comcast and its parents, subsidiaries and affiliated companies and each of their respective officers, directors, employees and agents.  c. Right to Opt Out. IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO BE BOUND BY THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION, YOU MUST NOTIFY COMCAST IN WRITING WITHIN 30 DAYS OF THE DATE THAT YOU FIRST RECEIVE THIS AGREEMENT BY VISITING WWW.COMCAST.COM/ARBITRATIONOPTOUT, OR BY MAIL TO COMCAST 1701 JOHN F. KENNEDY BLVD., PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103-2838, ATTN: LEGAL DEPARTMENT/ARBITRATION. YOUR WRITTEN NOTIFICATION TO COMCAST MUST INCLUDE YOUR NAME, ADDRESS AND COMCAST ACCOUNT NUMBER AS WELL AS A CLEAR STATEMENT THAT YOU DO NOT WISH TO RESOLVE DISPUTES WITH COMCAST THROUGH ARBITRATION. YOUR DECISION TO OPT OUT OF THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION WILL HAVE NO ADVERSE EFFECT ON YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH COMCAST OR THE DELIVERY OF SERVICE(S) TO YOU BY COMCAST. IF YOU HAVE PREVIOUSLY NOTIFIED COMCAST OF YOUR DECISION TO OPT OUT OF ARBITRATION, YOU DO NOT NEED TO DO SO AGAIN.   d. Initiation of Arbitration Proceeding/Selection of Arbitrator. If you or Comcast elect to resolve your Dispute through arbitration pursuant to this Arbitration Provision, the party initiating the arbitration proceeding may open a case with the American Arbitration Association - Case Filing Services, 1101 Laurel Oak Road, Suite 100, Voorhees, NJ 08043, 877-493-4185, www.adr.org under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association ""AAA"".     Take note of d. ""If you or Comcast elect to resolve your Dispute through arbitration...""   Comcast will always elect for arbitration, whether you like it or not. Because the American Arbitration Association is a kangaroo court that will rule in Comcast's favor pretty much every time. After all, Comcast pays the bills. Yet, if Comcast doesn't like something? Well, Comcast will simply refuse to abide by the rules and will tell you (and the AAA) to go fuck yourselves.  Don't close yourself off to remedies from the courts. Opt out of arbitration. And document the fuck out of everything. I promise you the first thing they will do is try to claim they have no record of you opting out.  If something does happen between you and Comcast in the future, you'll have better luck in Small Claims Court than arbitration. Plus, you don't lock yourself out of higher courts, should the need arise."

They could have put a stop-payment on the check with a simple trip to the bank.  Yes, mistakes happen.  People get in a hurry and mail the wrong thing to the wrong place.

Philadelphia Daily News columnist Ronnie Polaneczky regularly gets emails from exasperated readers who are completely fed up with Comcastâs Kafkaesque customer service, which is quite a common occurrence for those of us who regularly write about the company. However unlike most of us, Polaneczky happens to know how to get in touch with Suzanne Roberts, the mother of Comcast CEO Brian Roberts.  When Polaneczky recently contacted Mrs. Roberts about problems one of her readers was having with Comcast, she found that she immediately got results.  âCenter City couple Diana and Jason Airoldi finally got their Comcast cable and internet hookup after six full weeks of broken appointments by the cable giant,â she explains. âWhy? Because I took pity on the couple and called to the ultimate authority at Comcast Corp. â Suzanne Roberts, the 92-year-old mother of the companyâs CEO. In less than a day, Comcast trucks were at the Airoldi home, and the problem was solved.â  While itâs great that Polaneczky helped this couple get their problem solved, itâs pretty pathetic that Comcast customers have to either contact reporters or hope their stories go viral on Reddit before getting any kind of attention. Whatâs especially bad is that this columnist felt the only way to get the companyâs attention in this case was to tattle on the CEO to his mom, which is something most of us stopped doing around the age of 9 or so.  It would be one thing if Comcast were simply an incompetently run company, but we know itâs not. Comcastâs lobbying operations are absolutely first-rate and it can cozy up to politicians and regulators like almost no one else in the country right now. The reason Comcastâs customer service is so bad is because it simply doesnât care."

We can't sit idly by while telecommunications companies begin to rape out wallets, and demand more money for services they have provided for years. With the new technology available, and the ability to blow through their limits in a matter of days (especially with 4k streaming on its way) we have to tread carefully.   Today my service was interrupted for the 2nd time this month for going over my Data Cap of 250GB. A game from my steam library is on average about 60gb. My family uses netflix as primary entertainment.  THIS IS RIDICULOUS! They are robber barons, and they know how to make money. They are literally skimming from the top of true businesses such as game developers who are giving us something in return for a good. The game dev makes the game, sells it to us. We pay for internet to receive that game, and on top of that, the companies limit how much we can receive. This is bull."

So I filed a complaint about ISPs in general having data caps and just got this message back yesterday:   Thank you for filing a complaint with the FCC regarding data caps applied to your broadband Internet service. The FCC recognizes the potential significance of data caps and other usage-based pricing for consumers of both fixed and mobile broadband services, and has been evaluating developments on this issue in several ongoing proceedings. In particular, the FCC asked for comment on a variety of usage-based pricing and transparency issues in conjunction with its proceeding to promote and protect an Open Internet.     You might want to add public comments to this proceedingâs record. If so, you can search for this proceeding (Docket No. 14-28) and submit your comments through this portal: http://apps.fcc.gov/ecfs."

WarOnComcast,2vd1k9,Twiztid89,2,Tue Feb 10 15:52:34 2015 UTC,How?
WarOnComcast,2vd1k9,stonecats,1 point,Tue Feb 10 16:49:27 2015 UTC,"The FCC and other regulatory bodies automatically forward all complaints made about a provider to that provider, even if they aren't necessarily a regulatory body for that provider. Comcast has a department called ESL, a department whose representatives act as ""the office of the president"" in customer service matters, and fields these complaints. Any time you decide to call the office of the president, threaten legal action, make a complaint to the Better Business Bureau, the FCC, the BPU, or any regulatory bodies in your area...it ends up as a ticket for an ESL representative. These teams know the representatives who work these complaints for the regulatory bodies by name, and in fact many ESL employees originally worked for the FCC etc.  That story about Frank Eliason that was posted here recently, he used to head up the ESL team for the whole corporation.  ESL representatives have a lot of power that regular customer service representatives do not. In 99% of cases they do exactly what the customer is demanding - unless it involves demanding not to pay your bill and you've very clearly been using the services you owe money for. An ESL rep can call any other department and has authority to ask for anything. Your tech was a no-show five times in a row and you got pissed off? ESL can get a dispatcher on the phone and send a tech to your house within the hour - this gets trickier after business hours but I've done it and seen it done, in emergencies. Getting dicked around over that box you returned and are being charged for? They can research and wipe it from your record within a matter of days.  So yeah, short answer is, you made your complaint, the FCC forwarded your complaint to Comcast, and Comcast fixed your little problem to persuade you to stop being a squeaky wheel.  Source: worked for Comcast from 2007-2010 and spent 6 months on the ESL team."

It comes across as a slimy attempt to get his name attached to being pro-Title II only to push legislation through the door before the outraged masses catch on that Title II changed.

WarOnComcast,2uj3om,500500,38,Mon Feb 2 16:41:13 2015 UTC,"The shell game isn't just trying to ratchet up prices on customers, it also has to do with duping investors. If comcast sells their starter triple play for $99/mo, with a 2 year price discount promotion that goes up $25 after year one and $25 again to actual price, they can then turn around and say that based on their average retention length of a new customer that they have a huge amount of future profits coming to them. But that average customer length includes grandmas who have enjoying their mandated $16-$22/mo limited basic service for decades. The actual number of people paying full rate is much more debatable.  Similarly, as TV subscriptions have plumited, Comcast now offers deals on internet plus a cable box with economy or limited basic for a better price than internet by itself, at least, on promotional pricing. Final rates are like $10 more than internet alone, this allows them to then turn around to investors and insist that TV is doing great and adding new customers all the time.  Comcast's customers are not the end users of their service, it's the franchise tax board and the investors who pump up the stock prices.  Source: did door-to-door sales for them for several years."
WarOnComcast,2uj3om,DiscordianAgent,4,Mon Feb 2 17:33:59 2015 UTC,"I feel like this is lost a lot, they don't care about the customer, because we need the service and we have to use them, so they just want to make the most they legally can off of us."
WarOnComcast,2uj3om,scuczu,12,Tue Feb 3 13:59:21 2015 UTC,"A great deal of the pricing problems is a result of rate codes. The television market is far more complex than it needs to be as a result of regulatory bodies, must-carry agreements that are broken down by town, and so many other external factors. I worked for Comcast for three years and time and time again I said ""things would be so much better for our customers if the rate code system were simplified on the front end"". They said that this was a high level technical problem with how the software we used was written. So I applied to be one of their developers. And was rejected. So I left.  Edit: So I read the article properly and saw that this is coming down from Frank Eliason. I've worked directly with Frank in the past, spending six months on a corporate escalations team (ESL) that dealt with customers who were angry enough to report their issues to the ""president's office"" or some regulatory body, or to threaten legal action.  He's absolutely right. He was also easily the best asset that Comcast had. In my time with the company I saw him defuse so many explosive situations with angry customers and media outlets. He did ten times as much to fix Comcast's reputation as anyone else I worked with at that company. Comcast is about to get much worse without him in it."

My hook ups were done on time and professionally and the services always worked. I simply got tired of watching the bill deviate every month! I had the same services the entire time and don't think I ever had a bill that was the same from 1 month to another. Some months it dropped, some it went up, then back down. I did online chat recently and pretty much forced the rep to put everything in writing, found out cable was going up $20/momo w/ no increase in service on Jan 26 and decided to pull the plug. I didn't do the song and dance w/ customer retention, just unplugged it all and took it to their office. The ""please sign up again"" deals haven't started yet but doesn't matter.

I wanted to let you know that here at Comcast we work really hard to make everything comcastic! And unfortunately, this sounds like it fell short of that (you might even say it was a comdisaster). I've reviewed your bill and determined that everything checks out. Unfortunately you live in a hippie riddled liberal shithole that has decided to charge $45/month in utility taxes to pay for a homeless women tampon exchange program. I wanted to thank you for you business and let you know that although you don't have a choice in cable/internet providers in your area, we're glad you chose us! If I can be of any further assistance to you, please email me at comcast69@sbcglobal.net! Thanks again Thedud!"

WarOnComcast,2u52vu,firedfromcomcast,3,Fri Jan 30 03:08:00 2015 UTC,"Don't be a dick. Read the article, Our previous plan had no charge for equipment.  If we are changing service plans and there is no mention of an additional charge for equipment, am I to assume that there will suddenly be a charge?"
WarOnComcast,2u6aw7,SleepyFantasy,1 point,Fri Jan 30 06:52:32 2015 UTC,"It's a little bit of both.  About 3/4 of a a bill goes to all of the channels you are subscribed to, and the rest goes to Comcast which is used for either actually bringing the channel for you or a profit.  ESPN and the rest of the channels charges Comcast to air the channel, this usually ranges from $1.00 a month for a set of channels to $5.00 a month for a specific channel.  It is then up to Comcast to decide how to sell that to the customer.  This is usually done by a cable package.  Now, let's say ESPN charges $4.00 a month to Comcast.  ESPN comes up with this $4.00 a month by dividing its cost by estimated revenue.  It's cost comes from many things, but the biggest is the rights to cover the NFL, NHL and other sports leagues games and news.  Reportedly, just for the NFL, ESPN is paying over $1 billion a year from now until 2022.  These costs add up, and charging customers through Comcast isn't going to cut it.  So, ads need to put in between shows so more revenue could be raised.  Unless it's a commercial for ESPN, the advertisers pay ESPN to put their ads on the channel.  So, to answer your questions  ESPN charges Comcast to put its channel in its lineup.  ESPN needs to pay the NFL & NHL & other sports leagues so ESPN has the rights to cover them.  ESPN doesn't care if you are subscribed to Comcast, they only care if you are subscribed to a cable or satellite TV company that covers their channel. The more subscribers the cable or satellite company makes, the more money ESPN makes.  In the short term, no.  ESPN has contracts with the sports leagues years in advanced, so the NFL & NHL made a ton of money even before ESPN covers them and anyone has a chance to watch them.  However, if no one watches the programs through ESPN, ESPN doesn't find it valuable to cover those sports leagues anymore, so they would not sign a contract with them when the time comes.  This is rarely the case for very popular sports leagues, so ESPN would probably reorganize its coverage of those sports before they decide to not cover them anymore.  When an ad is put on ESPN, the advertiser pays ESPN x amount of dollars to run the ad on its channel.  This is revenue for ESPN, and it could either be used to cover its cost of covering the NFL or NHL, or use the money as ESPN's profit.  As stated before, ESPN decides how much it would charge Comcast for ESPN's services.  So, when you pay your cable bill, it goes to Comcast, which keeps some of the money for profit and other costs, and spends the rest for airing cable channels like ESPN.  ESPN then uses Comcast's money either for profit, other costs or for paying the rights to air coverage of sports leagues such as the NFL and the NHL."

WarOnComcast,2szzs7,jjchap4317,10,Tue Jan 20 01:07:25 2015 UTC,"I have had DirecTV for about 7 years now and I will never, ever go back to cable if I can help it.     I personally think the picture is better which is to say I seem to get more...I dunno...artifacts and weirdness with cable.  The picture from DirecTV is reliably great (note I have a good, unobstructed line-of-sight for my dish).  It is also possible (though rare) to get 1080p shows.  My GFs cable can only do 1080i. The on-screen guide is light-years better than cable.  There is no comparison.  It looks better, is devoid of ads and intuitive. The service is outrageously good.  When I call I get a human within two minutes (usually faster).  What few problems I have had they resolve on the spot and always remotely (no need for a visit).  In fact, I called a year ago to see about upgrading my service.  I called on a Saturday afternoon.  They agreed to the upgrade which include a new, better DVR and a new dish.  They sent out a guy the next day (Sunday) to install it all.  Took a couple hours to get it all set up.  No charge. Superior equipment.  My DVR can now record six shows simultaneously off of one input (IIRC cable does two shows at once).  It also shares its recordings with all the other DVRs in the house (so you can play something recorded on the family room DVR in the bedroom and vice-versa).  The remote can work on RF instead of just IR (does both) so you can hide the unit in a cabinet or behind something and still control it.   Note some will complain that the picture goes out in bad weather.  While this is true it has to be really bad weather.  I live in Chicago which has no shortage or rainy/snowy shitty days and maybe twice a year do I experience the picture dropping out because of weather and only then for 5-10 minutes till the worst is passed.  My only complaint is I bought the gizmo that allows you to access your DVR from other devices via the internet so you can, in theory, watch your recorded shows anywhere.  Turns out the thing is horribly gimped in numerous ways.  Pretty much it is complete shit and a huge waste of money.  That said the thing is completely optional.  Other than that I love the service."

This may be one of the few instances where you can tell your HOA to fuck off which is always nice.

Turns out that the package doesn't even activate until you pick up and install the cable box. It also turns out that for whatever reason I had to manually call them after the cable box was hooked up to upgrade my internet - the boot file on the modem didn't update.  For the joy of all of this - I also owe them $15 for an ""upgrade fee"".  I'm not sure I've ever felt so fucking ashamed of letting something pass in my life."
WarOnComcast,2riwia,Budikah,2,Tue Jan 6 20:28:58 2015 UTC,That's very strange. I was given the same deal. My internet went from 30mbps to 50mbps that day and the cable box was mailed to me.
WarOnComcast,2riwia,G_Maharis,4,Tue Jan 6 22:13:59 2015 UTC,That's just how Comcast works. No consistency. I explicitly asked if it could be increased before the box arrived and was told no. I even asked if I could reject the box all together and was told no.
WarOnComcast,2riwia,Budikah,3,Tue Jan 6 23:48:38 2015 UTC,Yeah comcast has different policies in different markets.  I had a tivo that takes cable cards and in the SF market they will just give them to you with the relevant info if you tell them you don't need a tech to help.  I moved to the sacramento market and they required a tech to come out and do it for which they charged me.
WarOnComcast,2riwia,slick8086,3,Wed Jan 7 09:27:06 2015 UTC,Sounds like my new deal. They mailed me the box AND charged me a hookup fee.

I have business internet from them I was getting 6Mb/s called to ask why I'm not getting 15 they are advertising. Talked to 5 different people some telling me I'm still under old contract and that's the speed I'm paying for one trying to upsell me to 50Mb/s for same price for the first year then going up to 100 a month next 2 years. But I can call after a year to get promo code again of course that's not in the contract what am I an idiot. Finally get one that says I'm not on contract anymore and can get faster speed I need a new modem. No problem I go get my own and save $13 a month rental fee and now getting 18Mb/s not 15 took half the day but at least I'm getting what I'm paying for.

WarOnComcast,2r5l5i,iwasinmybunk,0,Thu Jan 15 01:24:08 2015 UTC,You actually had a promo. There is one -$9.99 and one -$9.95 on the bill. One was labeled as a service discount and other other showed you had a the promo price by six in the line.   So went from $10 to $15(use to be $20) DVR went up $2. Promo on the bundle expired and a the taxes and fees went up a little.
WarOnComcast,2r5l5i,owlboy,0,Thu Jan 15 04:45:46 2015 UTC,"I think you're missing the point.  The itemization even shows a bundle on the previous bill, whereas the new bill has completely abandoned this concept.  Those ""promos"" you keep referring to are the adjustments their billing system makes in order to have the overall price be lower when the customer has a bundle.  Because that's how a bundle works - agree to more than one service in your home and the price for both is reduced instead of charging separately for both, like they've done here.  Likewise, the CSR I spoke with confirmed that there wasn't any promotions on my account for years.  Edit: Spelling"
WarOnComcast,2r5l5i,Colorfag,0,Thu Jan 15 11:30:21 2015 UTC,You're still in a bundle price with bundle pricing. I can tell because of the new bill and it showing the price for the internet.  Bundle internet is usually 53.95(depends on area) and non bundle(internet only) is 66.95(depends on area)
WarOnComcast,2r5l5i,bkdlays,0,Thu Jan 15 13:41:32 2015 UTC,"Then why have two (now) Comcast reps confirmed that I am no longer in a bundle?

WarOnComcast,2r5ush,amfjani,1 point,Sat Jan 3 02:02:43 2015 UTC,"This still has not been fixed!

If you want to be cynical, this is one possible mechanism by which certain online services such as Xfinity TV on Xbox 360/iPad could be prioritized (""fast lane"") and made cap-exempt once they no longer have to abide by the NBC merger concession."
WarOnComcast,2r5ush,heft_on_wheels,0,Sun Jan 4 02:15:38 2015 UTC,Not mine.  Because I bought my own DOCSIS 3.0 cable modem and refused to allow any of Comcast's hardware inside my home.  My N routers and gigabit switches work just fine.

WarOnComcast,2r0mnd,Scientologist2a,5,Thu Jan 1 17:11:05 2015 UTC,"i never understood how pole ownership works.  as far as i know, if you have a pole on your property, you do not own the pole; it's technically public property.  you still have to maintain it (keep it accessible), but if you try to move it/alter it you can face some pretty serious criminal charges.  so who owns the poles?"
WarOnComcast,2r0mnd,Grammer_NotZ,5,Thu Jan 1 21:02:20 2015 UTC,"Usually the electrical company in the area. My mom works for a large electric company in California and they own the poles, they set the poles and deal with damaged poles. Phone and cable companies lease the use of the poles and must adhere to the owners rules and regs."
WarOnComcast,2r0mnd,87stangmeister,6,Thu Jan 1 23:58:23 2015 UTC,"Not just owners rules, but there are utility regulatory commissions in every state that help negotiate rules about who can access utility poles and what fees they are responsible for etc. The electric utility owns and maintains most poles (although some are also installed and maintained by cable and telecom companies) but there is an understanding that there can only be so many utility poles around or streets will become cluttered etc... having utility poles go across your property is one thing, but people would start to get annoyed if there were 3 or four sets of poles crossing the front of their yard. So, because utility poles are a limited resource and they serve a common good, it is the governments place to regulate them. Unfortunately, because internet is not considered a utility like a phone line, the utility regulatory commission in each state doesn't necessarily need to make deals with companies that want to supply internet access or cable. This opens the door for established cable companies to essentially bribe the electric utility to deny access to the cable companies new competitors, which is what has been going on with Google Fiber. They are not guaranteed a fair shake when it comes to accessing the poles which has limited their growth.   It's a real dicked up situation and the FCC sucks a bunch of dick. I am in wireless communications and have to deal with the FCC all the time and from my personal experience I can say that they are probably the most corrupt government organization on the planet. They are not even ashamed of it at this point... they carry it out in the open and nobody does anything about it. The whole situation is just fucked."

WarOnComcast,2qxg4m,rit56,12,Wed Dec 31 16:20:58 2014 UTC,This really blows my mind. I've worked in customer phone support before at a couple of different employers and I would have been immediately fired for acting like that on the phone. I don't understand why Comcast allows their employees to treat their customers like this.
WarOnComcast,2qxg4m,CrystalSplice,15,Wed Dec 31 20:05:05 2014 UTC,Maybe that's how Comcast trains them? TheVerge did a story about Comcast support training and it mostly consisted of how to up-sell customers and very little about actually helping them.
WarOnComcast,2qxg4m,jungleboogiemonster,8,Wed Dec 31 21:18:17 2014 UTC,"I'm just saying, customer service isn't this great unsolved mystery. This isn't how you do it."
WarOnComcast,2qxg4m,CrystalSplice,10,Wed Dec 31 21:52:34 2014 UTC,"Monopolies don't need to care about customer service, just upselling for more profit."
WarOnComcast,2qxg4m,john-five,6,Thu Jan 1 00:12:52 2015 UTC,"Can confirm. I worked as tech support for a Comcast contractor. The rules were basically ""be polite and upsell"". This is why you get shitty tech support. There was absolutely nothing about that call that was unusual for Comcast."
WarOnComcast,2qxg4m,nerdburg,1 point,Thu Jan 1 11:05:15 2015 UTC,"What would be required of Comcast to be classified as having ""helped him""?  The bigger question here is going to end up being ""Can a company be held responsible for offers made outside of the scope of an employees authority and contradictory to training and documentation, when an employee makes a mistake, or when an employee willfully attempts to deceive a customer?""  If the answer to that question is yes, what are the limits if any?  If I work at a gas station and tell you that you get free gas for 6 months, does the company have to ""stand by its word""?  To me its like a child yelling ""GOTCHA!!! NO TAKE BACKS!!!""  Paying the difference in what the customer understood with the last two bills corrects for any damage suffered by relying on bad information, and then letting the customer know what is available is the only rational way I can see this playing out.  This sort of situation happens all the time.  All you can do is correct the mistake and move on.  ""But so and so told me _____""  I've never told a customer ""No, no they didn't.""  I just apologize for the incorrect information provided and explain what the right information is.  The only reason he got his way was because they wanted to shut him up to avoid additional bad publicity, but that doesn't mean it was the right thing to do.  Sure, this issue could be pushed but all that happens is that you end up with having people sign a contract they neither read nor understand.  While I worked at Comcast, I frequently had to read signed contracts to customers who insisted something was part of the contract (usually dvr / hbo etc.) when it wasn't.  Comcast is a shit company with shit training that is mostly about upselling, its corporate culture is absurd, but I just don't know what people expected here.  I've worked in various call centers including as a Comcast billing rep, I don't see what was wrong here, other than the customer liked the wrong information and didn't like the right information."

The trick is to ask them the right questions so that they can't fabricate information and they had to fund a bit of research to do that and let the person provide feedback on every leg of the call and not just the call as a whole, as well as a web interface so that the person can work through it visually and pick and choose who to ding with bad feedback.

WarOnComcast,2qukkg,abootypatooty,11,Tue Dec 30 20:44:04 2014 UTC,The solution to this is simple.  Buy a $70 DOCSIS 3.0 modem and a $120 or less wireless router.  Return your equipment to Comcast and KEEP THE RECEIPT.
WarOnComcast,2qukkg,roo-ster,5,Tue Dec 30 22:23:59 2014 UTC,You can spend much less than this if you buy refurbished or used. Just remember to get a DOCSIS 3.0 and 8x4 instead of 4x4.

WarOnComcast,2quxha,RogueAngel,1 point,Tue Dec 30 22:32:56 2014 UTC,"I'll clarify and revise:  In response to CC reps like the one in this video,from a post in another sub.  If a caller actually gets a helpful rep, play nice."
WarOnComcast,2quxha,Andromansis,3,Tue Dec 30 22:40:21 2014 UTC,"Good advice.  Abusing the low level grunts that have nothing to do with the decisions that are made higher up is just not very nice.  Somebody gets on the phone and starts abusing me and I have to hold back a lot so that I don't slip up and ask them if they abuse pets and waiters as well.  So here are a few general guidelines   1) as much as possible has been done to align your interests with the agents interests.  In the video you cited the customer quoted $53.48 or something and the agent came back and offered him a contract price of $49.99.  That customer was less concerned about the outcome and more concerned about being right.    2)  Please remain consistent between legs of the call and understand that it actually federal law that we have to verify you on every leg of the call.  If you tell one agent one thing and another agent a different thing, you're not going to be working toward the same thing.  Like if you get transferred to TV because you went on a 5 minute rant about the TV not working and then you tell the TV agent that you're having problems with your bill and then you tell the billing agent that you're having wifi problems... you're gonna have a bad time.  3) If they sound robotic and like they are reading from a script that is because they are new.  More experienced agents have long since learned, internalized, and personalized the QA guidelines.  Somebody being new is no reason to get as mad at them as people tend to.  You can give feedback calmly.  You've worked customer service or you've done things where you were new at before too.  All in all though, the customer is the biggest variable on the call.    You can request an agent in the continental united states, just do not expect this to work 100% of the time and results, while usually pretty good are sometimes suboptimal  You can always request an escalation for technical reasons or for agent misconduct."

WarOnComcast,2qqqy6,athriftyguy,4,Mon Dec 29 20:29:04 2014 UTC,"DOCSIS 3.0 is worth it but decline their offer and buy your own modem and/or router.  This avoids their billing shenanigans, avoids them creating a public 'XFinity' network (which ties up valuable wifi channels in dense wifi signal areas), and it gives you more flexibility to choose better equipment."
WarOnComcast,2qqqy6,roo-ster,3,Tue Dec 30 17:41:34 2014 UTC,This is what i did
WarOnComcast,2qqqy6,Howarthuk,2,Wed Dec 31 00:56:27 2014 UTC,This.  The new Comcast combo modem/routers destroyed the properly built networks that I installed for family and friends.  Suddenly I got all these calls about things not working.  Comcast was double-NAT-ing with the internal routers that we already had working.  Get your own router from the hardware compatibility list on Comcast's site (a quick Goggle will find it) and run your own switch/router inside your network.  Comcast can only mess things up.
WarOnComcast,2qqqy6,helmet_newton,2,Fri Jan 9 16:11:55 2015 UTC,The upgrade is free. For me it upgrades from Docsis 2.0 to 3.0 raising the bandwidth limit from 42.88 to channels * 42.88 according to the wiki. Talking with the rep on the phone it sounds like there are 2 models that have docsis 3.0. One of which has wifi and the other doesn't. Finally this brings us to the catch. They create a separate Comcast subscriber wifi channel. The number of channels within wifi is finite. They will be extra baggage on your infrastructure leading to the internet. Not entirely sure how quality your local infrastructure is but mine seems fine for anything I throw at it so I don't believe this would be an issue for me. Then there are people who don't want to have to run wifi for Comcast due to the power it uses to run it. I've been told you can call up support and have them disable it remotely. There is also a route through the website in which you can disable it. If you do want to disable it make sure after whichever route you take to check to confirm it is disabled. I don't have any information in regards to the wireless vs the non wireless modem nor do I know their models so I can't Google reviews on them.
WarOnComcast,2qqqy6,MINIMAN10000,2,Tue Dec 30 01:14:40 2014 UTC,"I recommend this modem http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16825188005 to replace theirs, it's the same or even better.

If I was at the top of these two companies, I would be rather embarrassed over the negative press they're receiving. Of course those people are so far removed from the bottom of the heap, that they are focused on the billions of dollars they'll make and the compensation packages they will personally receive.

WarOnComcast,2q0t0h,nineteenseventy,1 point,Tue Dec 23 00:17:25 2014 UTC,"Companies reuse MAC addresses with the assumption that the probability of two devices with the same address ending up on the same network as very slim, but it does happen.   I wish people like you would stop pulling bullshit out of their ass. You have no idea what you're talking about and what's worse is that you're spreading misinformation like fact. A quick google search of what a MAC address is and where they come from proves you have no idea what you're talking about and that you are simply pulling shit out of your ass.  MAC addresses are tied to a network interface such as a wifi interface or ethernet interface. A specific set of hardware and each manufacturer of hardware gets a list of available MAC addresses that are unique and not used by any other company. So there's no way a company reuses the same MAC addresses unless its a manufacturing defect where a MAC address is used more than once.  Sounds like Comcast just couldn't change the account MAC address due to some internal policies or the tech had no permissions to change that at their level. There's no such thing as duplicate MAC addresses unless a hardware manufacturer screwed up or someone is spoofing their MAC address, which is not the case with OP.  @ /u/jungleboogiemonster go read about something before spreading misinformation and get your head out of your ass."

So with so few connections compared to other ISP's, they are able to devote more resources to you connection, so your speed will only be limited by your cable or whatever the slowest equipment there is between you and your ISP.  This also explains your ping, since your ISP's equipment is so close to where you are physically, there isn't much distance for your connection to travel.

WarOnComcast,2p6oqf,reddy97,20,Sat Dec 13 22:57:22 2014 UTC,"Ok no, being vocal about good things Comcast does is the exact opposite of what you should do, that's their strategy. Comcast isn't a dog or child that is stupid and doesn't know what to do without being taught right and wrong behavior, it's a huge corporation with experts on how to destroy competition and increase their bottom line. Being vocal about good things they do would just undermine the campaign to portray Comcast as the shit company it is to prevent their success in passing the merger (as well as a plethora of other issues). If you're vocal about their ""good"" qualities, their reputation and public perception will change.   Also, your title is completely misleading when compared to your post. One person isn't ""Comcast,"" especially after a HUGE majority of reps you dealt with fucked you over. This one person is not someone that Comcast would even want to keep. Comcast trains their employees to do basically the opposite of what this rep did. Don't think that Comcast actually doesn't know how to have good customer service, they simply choose not to.

In fact, my city is on Google's potential fiber cities list, and if it comes, I will be one of the first to switch.   With that said, we have to be reasonable here. You have to ask what can Comcast do that could potentially make you a loyal customer. If the answer is nothing, then this isn't a productive conversation. It's like in the Bill Nye vs. Ken Ham debate. Part of what makes Ken Ham such a moron and Bill Nye such a respectable guy is that when asked what could change each of their minds, Bill Nye listed specific things, and Ken Ham said nothing would change his mind.  This is a similar situation. At the end of the day, for Comcast to be a good company they need: a good product, fair prices for that product, and good customer relations. Today, they did one of those things. Part of what I can do as a customer is voice when I think they do the wrong thing but also point out when they do the right thing in the hopes that will continue doing that. What I've told the supervisor is what I've told you guys, that I've had shitty experiences but this experience in particular was a good one and there should be more of these types. If part of the reason I had a good customer service experience today was because of the flak they've received about their usual customer service, and they are finally changing things, then GOOD. They should be told that what they did before is bad, and positive changes are good.

I'm sure thousands of people don't watch their bills closely enough to notice, or have auto pay turned on, and so this slips by enough to be profitable for comcast.

WarOnComcast,2ony5u,_BindersFullOfWomen_,8,Mon Dec 8 17:51:58 2014 UTC,"I'm a software developer who has programmed automated systems for taking payments. I hate Comcast just as much as the everyman, but this problem isn't on Comcast's end. Credit Card payments can show up on the account immediately, because when a credit card transaction is sent to the credit card company, an automated response is sent back immediately, saying if the transaction succeeded or failed. If it succeeds, it's very easy to credit the transaction amount to the account. Checks, on the other hand, are different. The company taking the payment only receives a failure notice if the check transaction failed, but it's not instantaneous. The failure notice can take up to 30 days to be received. The 10 day period for Comcast is a measure put in place to give 10 days for them to receive a response that the payment couldn't go through, for any reason, such as the checking account having insufficient funds."
WarOnComcast,2ony5u,theshankm,5,Mon Dec 8 19:24:57 2014 UTC,"Sure, but they can flag your account as 'payment pending' or something like that instead of it showing past due."
WarOnComcast,2ony5u,Suppafly,2,Mon Dec 8 21:59:13 2014 UTC,"That's very true. Unfortunately in a large company like Comcast, good ideas don't get as far up the ladder as they need to go. I'm sure the developers would appreciate ideas like this, but Comcast doesn't offer a forum for that kind of conversation. As a developer, I love this kind of feedback from the people that actually use the systems. In the company I work for, there are lot less layers between the customer and the developer, and I'm grateful for that.  Which is yet another reason to prevent Comcast from getting any bigger than it already is."
WarOnComcast,2ony5u,theshankm,3,Tue Dec 9 02:35:30 2014 UTC,"Ok, that's actually really great to know. Had the CSR told me that I totally would have understood. I guess going forward I'll just make sure to send the check sooner.  Follow up question though, if they successfully got the funds from my bank account - wouldn't that indicate to them that the the transaction has succeeded?"
WarOnComcast,2ony5u,theshankm,5,Mon Dec 8 19:36:42 2014 UTC,"First of all, from my experience, the CSRs know only what they need to know. They usually aren't the most educated people, so from a technical standpoint, they probably only understand that it's how the system works.  To answer your question, the process for processing a check payment is probably close to the following:  1) The Payment center receives your check, and the checks of millions of other people  2) Somehow, the checks are delivered physically (or probably digitally) to their bank. (This may only happen once a week.)  3) The checks are processed by the bank, it takes a couple days to determine whether there are sufficient funds in the payer's checking account.  This process seems to match up days-wise with the 10 days. If the delivery of checks to the bank is done once a week, then it may take as many as 7 days to be delivered. and then 2-3 days given for the processing of the check to determine if funds are sufficient. The 2-3 business days processing is, I'm sure, something that people who use checks are familiar with.  EDIT: As for why check delivery might happen only once a week, I have no idea, but that's how the company I work for does it, too. It most likely is, in part, because of other automated processes that are related. For instance, our company analyzes check payments by batch numbers (i.e. all check payments delivered on the same date.)  EDIT #2: Well I just re-read what you said about the money having already been removed from your account. My guess is that, because they give 10 days to receive a response, they have an automated process that runs every 10 days, applying the applicable credits to the accounts they didn't receive failure notices for. So even though your payment was processed early in the 10 day span, the automated CreditSuccessfulPayments process hasn't yet run. Again, this is probably run every 10 days instead of on an individual basis in order to keep everything organized and keep data from getting screwed up.  In databases, if two processes try to access or change the same piece of data at the same time, the data can be screwed up. So most automated processes are scheduled for specific times of the week, so that two processes don't run at the same time.  This may be confusing. I've typed this all on my phone, so there may also be typos and such.  TL;DR There are hundreds, if not thousands, of automated processes that run at specific times, in order to avoid compromised data."
WarOnComcast,2ony5u,CaptainChewbacca,2,Mon Dec 8 19:44:11 2014 UTC,"The 10 days is because it can take that long for a bank to detect a fraudulent check.  For example, if you had cut a counterfeit check the bank will honor it immediately but not necessarily verify it immediately.  If it is found to be fraudulent, the bank will take back the money they gave comcast.  10 days is pretty standard for check transactions."

Wait a minute... Wasn't Netflix the one who was extorted into paying protection money to Comcast in order remove the throttling on Comcast's side?  Also, at what point is Comcast not obliged to provide the so-called ""free interconnection services?""  Isn't providing ""interconnection services"" the entire point of an ISP?  It's downright appalling how brazenly Comcast lies to everyone's face about these issues.  It's so bad that now they are blaming the victim (Netflix) for the crime!"
WarOnComcast,2om1a4,misquotes_wikipedia,1 point,Mon Dec 8 17:24:49 2014 UTC,"Also, at what point is Comcast not obliged to provide the so-called ""free interconnection services?"" Isn't providing ""interconnection services"" the entire point of an ISP?   It depends on the details. If the interconnection is mutually beneficial (I get to access your network and you get to access mine) it's usually free. When you're plugging into someone else's network without providing much in return, however, you pay.  When Comcast interconnects with transit ISPs like Level 3 and Cogent both companies benefit from being able to use the other company's network. The transit ISPs get to sell their customers access to Comcast's customers, and Comcast gets to sell their customer access to all the other networks that the transit ISP is connected to."
WarOnComcast,2om1a4,rspeed,10,Sun Dec 14 09:53:13 2014 UTC,"Of course since neither Netflix or Comcast will allow anybody to see this data, people (and analysts) generally go with who they trust more in the equation and speculate accordingly.   In the absence of data, I think looking at it from a ""cui bono"" perspective makes more sense than trust. Netflix/Prime Video/Hulu is clearly the future of entertainment - on-demand, cheaper, potential for options - and Comcast, with it's dying cable tv model, wants to position itself as the gatekeeper for that future (i.e. ""if we can't dominate content indefinitely, we need to ensure that we have the legal positioning to charge the content providers whatever we want"").  Netflix has little to gain by ""rigging"" the traffic problem, IMO, since they have technology and consumer support on their side. They want to demonstrate to the FCC that they are an honest business who offers a valuable service to customers, an image that would be tarnished if Comcast could prove that they were doing underhanded things.  Comcast, on the other hand, desperately needs to prevent legislation that allows tight oversight of price negotiation, otherwise they can't eke out every last dollar from content providers (a cost that will ultimately fall on customers' shoulders.)"

Comcast charged me a technician fee on my internet account despite me not initiating any service because the landlord changed service on the apartment complex's free cable TV which I wasn't using and Comcast refused and hasn't refunded what they charged on my account. Comcast added a high-speed trial against my will and turned my account into a expensive plan and refused to refund my money. I canceled, signed up again SPECIFICALLY to ensure I got the right plan and they swore the price wouldn't go up, it went up AGAIN after a few months. I got them to switch it to the advertised plan for the 3rd time and I complained to the BBB, and in responding to the BBB the corporate Comcast agent said I was not eligible for the advertised plan (which was a blatent lie and the plan is something anyone can sign up for) and raised my rate to the $80 a month plan AGAIN in retaliation of my complaint, prompting me to close the account and without any fucking refunds!!"

IOW they were trying to prove that the existing ISPs are full of shit when they cry that they can't make any money. And to a degree it's working.

Yet they'd sign a 2-year commitment for a one-time $50 credit or something similar like that, so obviously not refusing because of the contract portion of it.  Some people simply don't listen, especially if they think you're trying to sell them something, even if it truly is better for them and worse for the company.

It's claims are objectively false.    âThe same speed, the same prices, the same access, but all web content isnât equal. Netflix is not the same as a high school blog, and YouTube certainly isnât the same as Facebook. They serve very different purposes and they have very different needs.  By dictating that all these sites be treated the same, Net Neutrality makes small companies that donât take up much bandwidth at all pay more so that big companies can pay less""   Net neutrally has nothing to do with bandwidth pricing, metering vs flat rate pricing, or connection speeds to the ISP.  The operator of every web site still has to buy the appropriate bandwidth and connections to their server(s).    Net neutrality is about whether ISPs can artificially delay or constrain the transport speed/bandwidth of traffic on their network.

WarOnComcast,2lpr5c,antdude,16,Sat Nov 8 23:16:28 2014 UTC,"I recently spoke to city officials in my town about the quality and availability of competitive service here. They were pretty forthright about the challenges faced by small towns like this one over ISP and cable contracts. Basically Comcast owns all of the lines here and any new provider would have to lay their own groundwork to set up shop. It's really not worth it to a competitor to try and move in to lay out that kind of infrastructure from the ground up, and Comcast is consistently unwilling to sell it or lease it out.   The other problem is the contract they then leverage on the town blocks just about all other competition so despite having CenturyLink in town they are not allowed to service their broadband option (only their DSL). We also have a regional fiber provider who is only able to exclusively work with our state university and cannot provide to anyone else in the community.   I think the best step forward is to reach out to city officials and attempt to propose moving towards municipal fiber as cable/ISP contracts expire. The only problem that persists with this is Comcast still whines and threatens to pull out cable service if the city moves to provide its own ISP coverage, so if it's put up for a vote more people would vote to keep their cable. It's a nightmare to overcome and Comcast essentially has small town America by the balls."

WarOnComcast,2lg2lt,KILLSBITCHES,1 point,Fri Nov 7 00:25:52 2014 UTC,That makes sense. The mom and pop can't really compete with a giant company like Comcast. In my family home I canceled Comcast and went for the small competitor. Over the years they went from 1.5mb to 5mb speeds and more recently they installed 1GB lines to local schools and are planning to roll out faster speeds for home clients. My conscience feels better giving them my business over the big guys.  In my business apartment I have Comcast because my apartment only allows Comcast and Centurylink. I went with Comcast because it's the only one without a contract since I move around frequently.

The real scam to me is the fact that Comcast doesn't share any of this money with their customers who share and slow down their Internet connection unwittingly or otherwise.  If Comcast took some money off the customers' bills or something, I could then see how this benefited them, but instead Comcast is taking all of the money, then pats their customers on the head and tells them they're doing them a favor.

The FCC is basically proposing to ignore the consumer side of the market, leaving it exactly the same. They are reclassifying connections between content providers (like Netflix or Blizzard) and ISPs as a common carrier relationship. This means that ISPs would not be allowed to enact exclusionary or anti-competitive behavior on content providers.  This doesn't mean that they can't charge netflix extra fees, only that any fees they charge to netflix have to be consistent with the fees they charge other ""high usage platforms"" like youtube. If their fees are inconsistent then the FCC can penalize them.  One possible benefit is that it doesn't reverse any previous ruling by the FCC making it much more likely to stand up in court. Any rules formulated by the FCC are only going to help us if the FCC is allowed to enforce them, which is exactly what changed with the verizon decision.  <possible bias> This concern doesn't change the fact that they way people use the internet has changed in a fundamental way which warrants the change from information service to communication service. We now have interactions with companies via the internet which are not merely for the purposes of gathering information. This change in usage is what might warrant a reversal of previous decisions</possible bias>"

""The proposal would also allow the commission to explore usage-based pricing at some point, in which consumers are charged based on how much data they use and companies are able to subsidize traffic to their websites or applications.""   As much as I hate this it's probably the most fair way to charge for internet service--by bandwidth usage.  That's how the utilities work.  You don't pay a flat fee for electricity or water, you pay for what you use.  EDIT: Downvoting isn't going to stop it from happening.  Sorry."
WarOnComcast,2kvrbx,turdBouillon,33,Sat Nov 1 01:09:38 2014 UTC,Water and energy are finite resources. Data on the other hand is not. Most of the cost involved in serving data is in the infrastructure build out to deliver it. Once you're hooked up to the internet the cost differential between sending a kilobyte and a gigabyte is totally marginal. Charging by bandwidth usage stifles innovation and is completely divorced from the actual costs of delivering service. You are drinking the telecom Kool aid on this one.
WarOnComcast,2kvrbx,nevergetssarcasm,15,Fri Oct 31 15:50:57 2014 UTC,"Good points, but the cost to send a gigabyte of netflix data isn't any different than the cost of sending a gigabyte of youtube data.

WarOnComcast,2kvrbx,uzuhl,-1,Fri Oct 31 21:42:58 2014 UTC,"I disagree.  While in your example the impact is negligible because of small size, if you multiply each to realistic numbers you'll find the resources required to deliver more data impacts costs by requiring additional routing therefore you need additional network equipment, additional staff to run that equipment, additional electricity, additional space, additional pipe size...so those costs scale with overall bandwidth use.

I will say that if you have the option to double your speed then you might be happy with that or at least be able to stall a little longer until something proper is decided on title II or other options.  I think it is somewhat reasonable to consider TWC even with how terrible they are, but when considering a switch, factor into it all of the little hidden expenses. Stuff like time waiting for a technician. I can't speak to the experienced speeds but there are websites like speedtest which can be good for assessing stuff like that. As for throttling, that is an issue you will have for every provider, so your best bet there is to factor in the cost of a decent VPN to dodge (or at least test) those.  I wish I could give you more particular advice, but I am in roughly the same boat, using verizon DSL and debating about switching to Cox.

WarOnComcast,2kl0t8,Maximus_Aurelius,12,Tue Oct 28 16:52:54 2014 UTC,"Highlights from the letter:   -- First, we address important market definition issues. We consider the critically important national market for broadband distribution of content, and in so doing, we draw upon a highly relevant precedent: the AT&T/MediaOne transaction in 2000, in which the Department of Justice prevented the merging parties from combining broadband assets that would, like the current transaction, have given them roughly 40 percent of the national market for broadband distribution of content. On the consumer-facing side of the market, we address issues of switching costs and potential entry into local broadband access markets, and establish that neither competition from existing DSL providers nor credible entry threats would be effective to discipline the merged firm from engaging in anti-competitive behavior. We also reject claims that either mobile or satellite-based broadband should be included in the relevant market. And we point out that the partiesâ âno overlap, no problemâ argument, if accepted, would lead to the conclusion that the antitrust laws would permit one party to own the dominant cable provider in every local market in the United States. Such a notion, with no limiting principle, simply cannot stand.  -- Second, we address the long-term competitive threat to the merging partiesâ cable business presented by online video distributors (âOVDsâ), and show that the merger would significantly enhance the Applicantsâ power to foreclose this important competition, resulting in fewer choices for consumers.  -- Third, we examine the partiesâ claimed efficiencies and conclude that they are inadequate under case law and the 2010 DOJ Antitrust/FTC Horizontal Merger Guidelines (â2010 Merger Guidelinesâ) to offset the competitive harm threatened by the merger.  -- Finally, we explain why behavioral remedies are insufficient to prevent harm to competition and consumers and conclude that the merger should be blocked in its entirety under the Clayton Act and the Communications Act of 1934."

WarOnComcast,2kl0t8,renational,3,Tue Oct 28 18:38:19 2014 UTC,"The AT&T / Media One precedent referenced in the letter is fascinating, and deserves further mention.   In this regard, AT&T owned a controlling interest in broadband provider Excite@Home. Excite@Home at the time had exclusive contractual rights to offer residential broadband service for cable providers AT&T, Comcast, Cox, and others. AT&T sought to merge with cable provider MediaOne, which owned a substantial interest in Road Runner, which had exclusive contractual rights to offer residential broadband service for cable providers MediaOne and Time Warner. Together, MediaOne and Road Runner controlled approximately 60 percent of residential cable broadband service, and cable broadband constituted approximately 70 percent of broadband service, so the merged entity would have controlled approximately 40 percent of residential broadband service.  Because of the mergerâs potential anticompetitive effect on the national market âfor aggregation, promotion and distribution of residential broadband content,â the Antitrust Division of the US Department of Justice refused to permit the merger to go forward.   Remarkably, the Road Runner broadband assets in question in 2000 remain Time Warner Cableâs to this day, while AT&Tâs broadband assets were subsequently transferred to Comcast. Thus, the proposed Comcast/Time Warner Cable merger would combine the very broadband assets that DOJ blocked from combining in 2000.  And of course, think about how much more important and heavily utilized residential broadband is today than it was in its infancy fifteen years ago.   TL:DR - the DOJ already considered -- and rejected -- this same merger of assets nearly 15 years ago. We've already seen this movie, and we know how it (should) end."

Comcast is testing the caps in some markets and plans to extend them to its whole territory within five years.

When big cable refuses to give evidence, the government just stops looking for it.   Absolutely fascinating.  Speedy edit: So, according to the article, the lesser cable companies have requested that the review be halted because the bigger companies refuse to share their data. This is actually a good thing. This will mean that, once the big companies finally are forced to hand over their data, the FCC will have plenty of time to review it. It also means that the big cable companies cannot just wait to hand over their data, which is likely what they were doing. This whole time, a 180 day review has been ongoing, and Comcast & Co. wanted to leave as little time as possible for the FCC to review their data.

Maybe I'm biased or idealistic, and I've never had to use Comcast but I have canceled AT&T and Verizon for months at a time because of shitty service and eventually found other things to do with my time. It wasn't that difficult, people just have to be willing to sacrifice convenience which seems to be the biggest problem.

People have to start making super high quality content that requires at least a gigabit internet connection. Either it be some new form of 4k streaming channels or a super high quality MMO by a company like Blizzard or something like that.  Lets face it right now, something along these lines IS going to happen eventually. A cool game will come out that blows everything we know away but requires super high speed internet to play it. People will stream the game. People will rub it in that even though you are a millionaire and live in America you are underprivileged.  A game that even Donald Trump couldn't play if he wanted to without leaving his mansion.  The streets would flow red with indignation, and probably blood.

We went back to Comcast /Xfinity for their internet and phone service. But we didn't like those fees either.  Eventually we looked at the essentials and began cord cutting . Got rid of almost everything except Internet. I still watch everything I want to include sports. Even convinced wife and kids that cable is only going to get more expensive and it's not worth the energy to be mad at essentially a 1st world problem and discretionary entertainment.

As you may know, earlier this year the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit struck down portions of the FCC's 2010 Open Internet Order, ruling that the agency's rules overstepped its regulatory authority under current law. As a result, FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler proposed a new set of net neutrality rules on May 15, 2014. While these rules have not been finalized, the FCC is encouraging interested individuals and groups to comment on the proposal, either through the FCC's website or by sending an e-mail to openinternet@fcc.gov.    I want to be clear that I suppo rt a hands-off approach to the internet. Since the Telecommunications Act of 1996 was passed into law, new technologies and advancements in telecommunications have rapidly developed due to the limited government regulation of internet traffic and services. As Congress continues to debate this issue, I will be sure to keep your thoughts in mind. Rest assured, I believe in preserving the first amendment right to freedom of speech on the internet and will always support policies that preserve the internet's open structure to promote innovation, spur economic growth, and protect the free exchange of ideas.    Thank you again for sharing your concerns with me on this issue. Communicating with the constituents I represent is very important to me. By receiving correspondence from you, I can stay informed on what matters affect you, which allows me to better represent the values of Coloradoâs Fifth Congressional District.    I encourage you to continue contacting me with your opinions on important matters. For more information about my efforts on behalf of Colorado, please visit my website at Lamborn.house.gov and âLikeâ me on Facebook.    Sincerely,    Doug Lamborn Member of Congress"
WarOnComcast,2j8kaz,CptnHeinry,6,Tue Oct 14 18:56:41 2014 UTC,"That's eerily similar to what Scott DesJarlais (also from Tennessee) sent to me, minus the slick social media bit:  Dear Mr. Anothercat,  Thank you for contacting me with your thoughts regarding net neutrality and the Federal Communication Commission (FCC). I appreciate having the benefit of your views on this matter.  Net neutrality, in general, is the idea that internet providers and governments should treat all data on the internet equally and not discriminate based on type of content. In 2010, the FCC approved an Open Internet Order, which prohibits broadband providers from blocking or discriminating against Internet content, making net neutrality the law. However, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia struck down portions of the Open Internet Order, ruling that the agency's rules overstepped its regulatory authority under current law. As a result, FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler proposed a new set of net neutrality rules on May 15, 2014. While these rules have not been finalized, the FCC is encouraging interested individuals and groups to comment on the proposal, either through the FCC's website or by sending an e-mail to openinternet@fcc.gov.  During my time in office, I have continually worked to promote accessibility and to stop unnecessary government interference in the internet. Please know that I will keep your thoughts in mind as Congress continues to debate this issue.   It is an honor and a privilege representing you and all of Tennessee's Fourth Congressional District. Please let me know if you have additional comments or question on this or any other legislative matter. Sincerely,  Scott DesJarlais Member of Congress"

While I would be excited if I felt he was acknowledging the unhealthy monopolies that currently exist in the ISP marketplace, I think he may have just been saying that regulation discourages ""healthy competition"".  I think his emphasis was on ""healthy"" and not on ""competition"".

WarOnComcast,2j8kaz,dontbethsad,3,Tue Oct 14 21:47:29 2014 UTC,"The internet has been an astonishing success in the past two decades.   this just shows that he has no idea why the internet has been so successful until now  The internet was largely a success because there was competition between isp's.  American Online fueled the internet boom in the United States and dominated internet services with their hubs placed all over the country.  Soon enough, local providers started offering cheaper and unlimited access without all the bells and whistles that AOL forced its users to go through.  A lot of these local providers did so well they started fiddling with ISDN and investing in DSL infrastructure.  The internet was moving forward at a good pace through the collective effort of thousands of business owners.  Then coaxial access became a thing.  Cable companies, which already ran incredibly profitable local monopolies throughout the country, were pumped full of federal, state, and local grants and loans to hastily lay additional infrastructure (the latter of which were often double-dipped by cable giants through surcharges).  This is the point where the government intervened to take the internet from a thriving market and hand it to corporate giants on a silver platter.  DSL is pretty much dead and the remaining cable providers throughout the country have been mostly bought up by one of a very few cable giants, cornering the market.  Fiber can't compete with cable in most areas because of exclusivity agreements between competitors or companies and local governments, which sometimes include free or heavily discounted internet for public schools or other government buildings.  So, in a very real way, the grants and loans paid for and back from the taxpayers have already ""regulated"" the internet access market.  Further regulation would just be a way to help control this mess that was created by a government which spoon-fed cable companies in its early years."

For instance, when you someday close your Comcast account, there is a possibility Comcast will say your router is theirs.  And in that scenario if you refuse to give Comcast your router, they will hit you with an Unreturned Equipment Fee, which then may or may not end up in collections.  Also, Comcast sometimes claims that their customers have bought stolen routers, and therefore Comcast claims the routers as their own property too.  So if possible (I'm not sure how ones goes about doing this) make 100% sure you buy a non-stolen router."

If you're ok with less than ideal latency, you can cut the cord from Comcast completely. Of course, I only mention satellite at all because I'm assuming you have no other local ISPs besides Comcast or you'd have cut the cord awhile ago."

WarOnComcast,2j0s6t,Cowicide,19,Sun Oct 12 12:08:43 2014 UTC,"If Comcast said they were working on new fiber optic technology to bring faster speeds to customers, then sure, that's technology.  This is much more about Comcast's customer service, or public relations. Even though Comcast is a services technology company, not everything they do is considered technology. This would be one thing Comcast has done that is not related to technology.  Also, screaming censorship on an online forum is pretty extreme. It's moderating content to get actual technology articles."
WarOnComcast,2j0s6t,Appable,-1,Sun Oct 12 14:59:43 2014 UTC,"Also, screaming censorship on an online forum is pretty extreme.   That's your opinion and you and your small amount of upvoters are welcome to it.  The article was censored, in my opinion, and I think it's healthy for the community to call it out wherever we see it especially once you consider /r/technology's lurid history in regards to censorship.  For example:  Reddit downgrades technology community after censorship  http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-27100773  The mods there at /r/technology also keep lying and saying that I didn't contact anyone about it.  Actually, I contacted the mod who censored it directly and ask him politely to please not censor it and I was ignored.  There was no response at all and the censorship remained in place, so I edited my post with more forceful language because I found that to be rude and dismissive and, again, I despise censorship.  Also, if you look at what the mod there used as an excuse to censor the article, he or she disingenuously said it was a ""self-post"" which was obviously untrue.  So, perhaps the moderator was inept, but that wouldn't explain why the mod ignored me after I politely asked for the error to be corrected.  You don't think it was censorship, but I disagree with you and if you look at all the downvotes of the mod who censored me, it's clear a lot more of the community agrees with me than they do with you.   Even though Comcast is a services technology company, not everything they do is considered technology. This would be one thing Comcast has done that is not related to technology.   Aside from the votes here in this specific thread, you are in the vast minority on this opinion.  The previous thread in /r/technology on the exact, same topic is now at about 5,500 upvotes and nearly 3,000 comments.  A few people within the huge thread claimed the story shouldn't be there but received very little upvotes comparatively and were overwhelmingly discounted/dismissed by the majority of Reddit users.  Observe:  https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/2ihy3x/unhappy_customer_comcast_told_my_employer_about/  Comcast is a technology company providing a technology service that affects technology directly and by proxy for consumers all over the country.  It's a technology story.  It may not be a technology story you and a few others prefer, but it's a technology story for the the overwhelming majority of the community nonetheless and that's why it received a vast amount of upvotes when it wasn't censored.  My initial post in question is a followup to the previous post that's already on /r/technology as shown above. It's even from the same media outlet.  The only difference is the previous article had unconfirmed allegations that made the corresponding reddit thread a nice bash-fest of character assassination on the Comcast customer including baseless allegations of fraud and even extortion sprinkled throughout.  On the other hand, the article I submitted that was censored was a followup where Comcast confirmed some of the customers allegations by admitting fault with their tech service, etc. and even apologized.  Thanks for your response."

They point blank admitted the reason they did it was not because I broke their rules, but because they don't like my speech and ideas at reddit outside of their own subreddit.  The lesson they're trying to convey is. Don't complain about our censorship or we'll ban you. Don't complain about our censorship or we'll attempt to shadowban you.

Assuming you would be voting for a third party much more extreme in either direction than one of the two majors, they have very little chance of winning (in a presidential election / most federal offices), and so it's far more likely that your vote would be the one that would push the major-party candidate over the line than the one that would push the minor-party candidate over the line.  If you say that you would give one candidate a score of 1000 (Green, say) and another 100 (Democratic), but the chance of a Democrat winning is 45.5% and the cance of Green is 0.5%, then voting Democratic will have 10x the value of voting Green to you.

As a matter of fact, i absolutely despise people that using sockpuppets.  I think it's one of the worst problems at Reddit (and scourge of the entire Internet) and I commend any moderator or whomever that legitimately spots it and stops it.  I think sockpuppets and secret, organized vote brigades that were organized at offsite areas from Digg helped to make it an amazingly crappy place for discourse before its ""demise"" or change or whatever.  Sockpuppets?  I hate 'em.  And, thank you very much for the all the info, can you PM me the moderator so I can ask them why they think I'm using alts to vote manipulate?  More out of curiosity than anything else.  I haven't had any moderators reach out to me that I know of and I honestly was so pissed off I didn't want to talk to any moderators after the Comcast article was censored, much less after I was banned and ready to tear someone a new asshole (figuratively) and (obviously) just make things worse by flipping out.  Yes, I'm passionate... so ban me. Wait...  After work and sleep, I'm going post Friday if this account isn't shockingly gone by then and explain how my housemate and myself are set up.  Well, at least as much as I will without jacking up our security.  I do not ask my housemate to upvote for me nor vice versa.  One question: Can I name names here and links to posts to explain what I think happened or does that simply extra ban me by doing that?  Some of the posts I'd link were in regards to people I was scrapping with just before the censorship and ban.  Thank you to those that were concerned enough about the general issue to post here, post PMs, emails, etc. -  That's very nice of you and it's one of many reasons why I love most of this community here at Reddit (even the assholes I scrap with for the most part)."

And, to clear it up, I was telling the truth.  I don't use alt accounts, I don't do vote rigging and that's why after complaining to higher ups at reddit my suspicious ban was removed.  Yet another example via agentlame:   don't apply skepticism to the type of person that would call someone else a pedophile because they didn't like their title   My God, agentlame never stops being obtuse and a compulsive liar.

Insight (referenced in the article) was a dream compared to what I have with Comcast here in Seattle.

I do actually get twice the speed for the same price with Comcast. Now that I think about it, I'm not sure if TWC made significant improvements in Lex since they took over. (at least not across all the the tiers of service)  Lexington is definitely one of the more progressive cities in the south, it's just still in the south and doesn't have the same level of infrastructure.

WarOnComcast,2inutf,Toribor,2,Thu Oct 9 03:06:43 2014 UTC,"Used to work for Comcast, years ago (story is fuzzy). Had a customer once who had been utterly dicked on his phone service - I forget the specifics but they basically shut off his account because some customer service rep created a work order wrong, and it was gonna take a couple of weeks to fix it. What this meant was that his daughter, who was on some LifeAlert alternative where her life support had to be hooked up to a phone line, was spending her nights in the hospital instead of her own bed.  Nooow I'm not gonna say that their lives were ruined, but that little girl's life was significantly worse because Comcast dicked them over. (Conclusion was that I busted my ass, took myself off the phones, and called EVERYONE to get this guy fixed by the next day. I tended to break rules in cases like this one, which ultimately led to my being stonewalled for every promotion opportunity.)  In another case, I spoke to a mother whose teenage son had autism, and for some reason kept ordering PPV movies on their digital box. She had a PIN password set on it that she updated once a week because of this - he would keep trying different PINs hoping to crack it, at all hours of the day. Well, some technical error wiped the PIN off of her box and her kid ordered a couple THOUSAND DOLLARS worth of PPV on her box. We're talking like 2 hour movies ordered 5 minutes apart from each other, clearly not even being watched. Comcast's decision? She still owed.  I hate to break it to you but Comcast provides at least two vital services to the American public, AND their third service has the power to incur massive debts. Yeah, they have ruined someone's life."

As for me it's not so much the size of the company but the abuse of market power and use of political corruption to eliminate competition that pisses me off.  There's nothing so bad about Comcast that a competitive market can't fix, short of their repeated successes in blocking a competitive market.    By owning and denying content (or charging exorbitant fees) to potential competitors, they kill any rival television service before they start.  By using frivolous lawsuits and well placed political donations (this is all David Cohen's doing, which is why he is just as guilty) they are able to effectively ban infrastructure competition from both private and public enterprise.  And data caps and usage based billing on a pure fixed cost service ensures no one can use the Internet to mount an effective competitive threat too.  When a company gets too big and can threaten their profit margin (Netflix) they can use their last mile infrastructure monopoly to extract rents.  Only when regulators, legislators, and citizens realize that a competitive market can fix our problems, and that no such market exists, will we see things get better.

We ask for competitive bids to get them built, and we do the same for larger maintenance task, whilst keeping a smaller permanent staff to do the little stuff.  We pay for the road network with taxes on income, land, gasoline, and car registration.  With proper municipal financing and competitive bid management, we should be able to build local Gigabit networks that anyone can use for $30 a month. This would include phone and video(tv) services.   Why isn't Google fiber this cheap?  Simple, Money.    Google has to get an ROI one every penny they spend within 2 to five years, and they prefer it to be 2 years. They are a corporation and they exist to (and must) make money for the stockholders No access to municipal bonds to fund construction. Muni-Bonds are the cheapest and best way to finance large projects. They have low interest and payback periods of as long as 50 years!

He is aware of how many people are affected by Comcast's poor customer service and shoddy business practices.  Rather than trying to fix any of that, he is aggressively trying to buy TWC.  It shows that they have no interested in acting as humans.    I own a business.  If I found out my customers were being hurt in anyway, I would try to fix it to avoid hurting anyone else.  I would not go out and purchase more businesses.  It is unethical when you are aware of a severe issue and intentionally do nothing to fix it.    Some examples of how this affects people's lives.  Comcast has leveraged its market share to become a monopoly.  In certain areas, people can only pick between Comcast and Comcast.  If someone is working from home one day, and their internet goes out, they have no options.  They have to call Comcast and spend a huge amount of time (and possibly money).    Comcast has also wrongfully charged customers and put a lot of their bank accounts into overdraft.  Customers have to fight to reduce the charges with a very low chance of them covering overdraft fees (due to Comcast's mistake).    Brian Roberts as CEO of Comcast has every right to make money, but as a Billionaire, he should have enough dignity to make money without hurting innocent people."

WarOnComcast,2im8nl,rit56,5,Wed Oct 8 01:20:53 2014 UTC,"Here's the piece.  After discussion and debate at six Federal Communications Commission roundtables stretching over 24 hours, a consensus has finally emerged on net neutrality: Whatever rules the F.C.C. adopts, someone will take it to court.  That was the judgment on Tuesday of the final two panels in the commissionâs effort to examine the economic, technological and legal aspects of its net neutrality authority.  âThere will be blood,â said Tim Wu, a Columbia University law professor who coined the term network neutrality in a 2003 academic paper. Which is to say, he added, âthere will be litigation.â Photo Tim Wu, a Columbia University law professor, coined the term network neutrality in a 2003 academic paper. Tim Wu, a Columbia University law professor, coined the term network neutrality in a 2003 academic paper.Credit Tina Fineberg for The New York Times  Others concurred. âThe chance is pretty slim that litigation will be avoided,â said Pantelis Michalopoulos, a partner at Steptoe & Johnson who has worked on net neutrality proposals for AOL.  Gus Hurwitz, assistant professor at the Nebraska College of Law, agreed, saying, âLitigation is probably inevitable.â  What the panelists did not agree on was the best way for the F.C.C. to structure its rules for net neutrality, the concept that all Internet traffic should be treated equally, with no type of traffic being favored over another as it makes its way from a provider to a consumer.  Mr. Wu, for example, firmly held that the best way for the F.C.C. to ensure an open Internet was for it to invoke its full authority under Title II of the Communications Act.  To do so, the F.C.C. would have to reclassify Internet service as a telecommunications service, a change from its current status as a Title I information service. The difference between the two is that the commission has more authority to regulate under Title II, which also covers utilitylike services, like traditional telephone service.  To some, that would cause big problems.  âTitle II would be a bonanza for attorneys,â said Thomas J. Navin, a partner at Wiley Rein. âBut not for innovators.â  Mr. Navin favored drawing up net neutrality rules based on Section 706 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996â. That is the part of the law that a federal appeals court cited in January, when it struck down the previous rules, as the likely source of F.C.C. authority.  Nuala OâConnor, president and chief executive of the Center for Democracy & Technology, was one of several participants who favored a hybrid approach, using elements of both Title II and Section 706 to outlaw blocking of and discrimination against web applications by Internet service providers.  But focusing on whether or not a given approach is more likely to attract litigation âis not the way to make a rule,â Ms. OâConnor said. âWe should look at the principles we are concerned about and act.â  Mark Cooper, director of research for the Consumer Federation of America, who also favors a hybrid approach to net neutrality rules, agreed.  âNobody should make a decision based on whether or not there will be litigation,â he said. âBecause there will be litigation.â"

WarOnComcast,2i5jfx,nerdburg,-1,Fri Oct 3 11:13:36 2014 UTC,So you're blaming the victim in why the system they paid for didn't work?
WarOnComcast,2i5jfx,unfortunatebastard,2,Fri Oct 3 18:31:33 2014 UTC,"They are victims of the criminals that broke into their home.   Comcast is just like every other alarm company; they expressly deny liability for damages even if it is due to their own negligence. Even if they are found liable, they are only on the hook for $250.00. I agree that that is a pile of BS and I do feel very bad for the family. All I'm saying is that it's a mistake to expect an alarm system to keep you safe. Put some bars on vulnerable windows, get a German Shepherd, arm yourself if you are comfortable with that...but please don't expect Comcast to protect you."

But the all-in-one devices (gateways) notoriously have poor Wi-Fi and routing capabilities. If there are one or two users in your house, it's a small house and you don't do heavy streaming or gaming, then it's probably fine. Otherwise you are better off with a separate modem and router. You can use the gateway as as straight modem by bridging it, that disables the router/wi-fi function. This allows you to use your own router.

Same thing with me. No wall plates, no sealant, no nothing. A hole drilled straight through from the inside through to the outside stucco. The cable comes out of the wall about 2"" off the floor (barely above the baseboards). There should be a wall plate, and it should be the same level as outlets (I forget, I think it's 6""). You shouldn't be able to pull the cord 10 feet inside because there's a shitload of slack and no sealant on the outside. The installation is the worst."

You can hide it in a plate against the wall, snake it through the wall, move the drop to another location from exterior, etc. A proper cabling tech can advise you on that.

I am honestly and sincerely interested in how you know for a fact that this is not their problem.  If you can back this claim up, I would love to see it in writing somewhere.

Cable under the carpet = tripping hazard and if that policy is broken then the individual install tech that does the install is legally liable if you move the cables and stage a fall.

I am completely open to whatever the official policy is, but I have yet to find out what it is.   It looks like I am not actually looking for a policy answer?    Perhaps because you are not giving a policy answer.  You are speculating.  I will accept what you've said to be true only when it has been backed up by a reference of some sort by you or someone else. The dispatch center who sent the tech told me that a few months ago, they stopped doing carpet installs (even though the tech told me they have NEVER done it), so this leads me to believe that there has to be something in writing out there, some policy letter of sorts that outlines the protocol.  This is what I want to see.     your maintenance person authorized it rather than argue with you.   nope..the maintenance guy is the one who recommended i do it that way.

That public posture is in keeping with the low-key approach favored by Brian L. Roberts, the companyâs chief executive, as he seeks to take over the world. Itâs worked very well so far.  But in a filing submitted to the Federal Communications Commission last week in defense of its proposed merger with Time Warner Cable, the company lashed out uncharacteristically at its critics. And David L. Cohen, Comcastâs chief lobbyist, continued the salvo in comments to reporters and in his written remarks.  Watching Comcastâs ballistic response to opponents of its $45 billion takeover bid was a bit like watching a campaign debate go off the rails. The front-runner, ahead by 20 points, is besieged by ankle-biters who suggest he is a lout and a bully. He finally loses it and goes off on his opponents in a fury, generally acting like, well, a bully. Continue reading the main story Related Coverage  DealBook: Comcast Accuses Rivals of âExtortionâ in Opposing Its Bid for Time Warner CableSEPT. 24, 2014   Thatâs one way to make a big lead go away.  In baring its teeth, Comcast sought to show that the companies now opposing the deal were using public interest arguments to advance private business agendas. It said these companies had privately sought $5 billion in concessions from Comcast before going public with their opposition.  In a thick document bristling with arguments on its own behalf, Comcast used quite a bit of ink and hot rhetoric on those who would lay it low, saying in part: âThe significance of this extortion lies in not just the sheer audacity of some of the demands, but also the fact that each of the entities making the âaskâ has all but conceded that if its individual business interests are met, then it has no concern whatsoever about the state of the industry, supposed market power going forward, or harm to consumers, competitors, or new entrants.â  Gee, Comcast, donât sugarcoat it. Say what you really mean.  The word extortion is usually applied to guys with names like Nicky who wear bad suits and crack their knuckles a lot. If this is how the company acts in the wooing stage, imagine how charming it will be once it actually gets what it wants.  The company named names, plenty of them: Netflix, for complaining about interconnection plans it freely negotiated with Comcast; Discovery, for asking for sweetheart carriage deals before its current contract is even up; and Dish, for whining about enhanced competition.  Its opponents were surprised by Comcastâs ferocity â and overjoyed. An air of inevitability has been hanging over the merger since it was announced in February â Comcast has a legion of allies in Washington, and a formidable advocate in Mr. Cohen â but the opposition that has built up in the ensuing months seems to have driven the company around the bend.  Comcast executives are offended. They genuinely believe that it will take a company of its scale and growing technological innovation to deliver the next generation of programming and data services.  Opponents of the merger are convinced that granting a beefed-up Comcast dominion over much of the countryâs broadband would stifle innovation and tilt the field in unhealthy ways. Continue reading the main story Continue reading the main story Continue reading the main story  Both sides believe they hold the key to a consumer-friendly, high-functioning Internet.  Right.  What is actually going on is both more basic and more interesting. Programmers are worried that if Comcast takes over Time Warner Cable, it will have the leverage to dictate prices. Web-based services like Netflix foresee a giant that will extract significant fees for providing high-speed performance.  Comcast, which agreed to all manner of regulation to complete its acquisition of NBCUniversal in 2011, does not want to hand out so many bonbons to other players that the proposed merger becomes noneconomic. There is no breakup fee on the deal and Comcast could still walk, especially if it feels that a merger would lead to the regulation of broadband access as if it were a public utility.  Opponents are trying to enlarge the merger debate to include the broader issues of net neutrality and monopoly control, and there are signs that these efforts are gaining traction in significant places. On Sept. 4, Tom Wheeler, the chairman of the F.C.C., surprised many, including Comcast, when he said in a speech that in terms of broadband that can support streaming on multiple devices, 82 percent of Americans have only one choice in providers.  Regardless of motive, the issues raised in the filings are hugely important and wonât be brushed aside by bombast or counterattack.  From the start, Comcast has sought to frame the debate more narrowly, portraying it as the merger of two cable operators that do not compete, which is sort of true and sort of beside the point. The future, as anyone with a router could tell you, is all about broadband; a merged Time Warner Cable and Comcast would control more than 35 percent of the broadband market with easy access to far more households and would be the dominant presence in 16 of the 20 largest cities in the country.  Comcast is aggrieved that the people it has seen across the negotiating table â with their hands out â cocked a gun after they didnât get what they wanted, but in terms of the public debate, Comcast is at a disadvantage.  From the consumer perspective, Netflix provides a wide array of programming for $8 a month, and Discovery delivers abundant reality programming along with lots of furry and furious animals. Comcast is the cable guy with the drooping pants, the one who collects money for everyone else by issuing big, fat monthly bills â and then sends much of it right back out the door to programmers.  A senior executive at Comcast agreed that its aggressive response was âuncharacteristic,â but said, âEnough was enough.â This executive spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal strategy.  âThe increases that these companies are looking for in exchange for not opposing the deal are exorbitant,â the executive said. âProgrammers donât expect to get called out on this stuff, but the industry is reaching a breaking point, and we needed to stand up for ourselves.â  It sounded sincere and very likely is, but going on the attack is probably not good strategy. Comcast has always combined its political might with restraint of tongue, a brutally effective combination that it has temporarily abandoned. In reminding the F.C.C. to scrutinize motives behind the arguments it will hear as it weighs whether to approve or challenge the deal, Comcast seemed defensive and frantic.  I remain unconvinced that giving Comcast a bigger footprint is good public policy, but I understand its frustration. No one, even big, powerful companies, likes being ganged up on by opponents whose own motives are open to suspicion, but their response could create more problems than itâs worth.  When I was young and stupid, my friends and I tried to cut through a yard full of turkeys just for the thrill of it. The turkeys surrounded us and immediately began hitting us with their wings, protesting the intrusion. My farm-raised pal cautioned me just to ignore it, but after a while I couldnât stand it anymore and gave one a nice swift kick.  And thatâs when the trouble really started.

WarOnComcast,2hp1a7,spivey378,6,Sun Sep 28 20:59:33 2014 UTC,We should start a page where people pledge how long they quit Comcast. Even if it's for just a day or two. Total up the lost revenue on a page hosted where it will broadcast to their shareholders on how shitty they are and how it is causing them to lose money
WarOnComcast,2hp1a7,turdBouillon,7,Sun Sep 28 14:11:29 2014 UTC,I like this idea!    They lost me four years ago over a bogus $34 charge. I've moved five times in that time and when Comcast is the only option ( like right now ) I just forego internet service.  I'll probably be here for another year so Comcast lost 5 years of subscription charges over $34 and incompetence...

Right now it seems the best way to get their attention is Twitter (@ComcastCares) or we_can_help@cable.comcast.com. That puts you in touch with Corporate Customer Service. If you write to the CEO, VPs, or complain to the BBB, the complaint is handled by Corporate Customer Service anyhow, so you might as well just contact them and cut out the middle man.  If Corporate does not resolve an issue the choices are:   1)File a small claims suit (not likely to be successful) 2) Complaint to your franchising authority. Usually this is your local government. Some of them will help you and some of them won't since they get a fat check from Comcast on a regular basis.  3) You can file a claim for arbitration as per the Comcast customer service agreement. But your chances of winning suck since the arbitrator is not neutral."

But on the very remote chance they really mean it, and if any one from Comcast ever reads this (99% sure they won't) and want some pointers, here you go:   Stop using every customer service call as a way of selling people more fucking shit. Stop jacking up your prices every couple of months you greedy fuckers. Capitalism is one thing, but what you're doing is outrageous. Better still, reduce your prices. And standardize them across the nation, so people in areas where you are the only option pay the same lower price as those in areas where you compete with other companies. Fire the aggressive lying assholes and reward the good, honest employees. Oh, that would mean firing 99% of your senior executives? Even better! Enough with the nickel & diming people. $8 a month for a cheap modem they can buy themselves is outrageous. Especially when you try to deter them from buying instead of renting at every opportunity. You are taking advantage of people's fear and ignorance to an obscene level. Stop switching people's services on them without their knowledge. Kind of a sub-point of other points here, but stop telling customers who log in to work via VPN they are breaking their contract and need to upgrade their service. You know that's bullshit, so stop being assholes and saying such lies. Stop selling customer data. We know you do it. Almost everyone does it. But it's still wrong. Stop screwing people about with technician appointments. It's disrespectful and inconvenient. Screen your technicians and contractors better. If I have to deal with one more clueless dip-shit who who rips a hole in my wall with their negligence I will lose it. Offer more speeds in Internet access. Having no options between 6mbps and 25mbps is fucking annoying. Enough with the fucking 'triple play' bullshit all the time. If someone only wants Internet respect that and don't keep pushing other shit. Don't trick people by offering HBO for 3 months when they are unhappy with their Comcast service. We all know you pay a flat fee to HBO etc, so you're not fooling anyone, and instead you aren't fixing people's real concerns. Offer existing customers the same deals as you offer new customers. In other words, reward loyalty and treat your customers with respect. Stop rebranding your shit. Changing name to 'Xfinity' or whatever else is just putting lipstick on a pig. Use the marketing money instead to improve training, expand customer service, or lower monthly costs. Make customer support more accessible, so customers don't have to wade through that stupid automated phone system. Enough with the fucking Xfinity wifi crap. It's a stupid idea and an invasion of people's privacy. Stop with the lies and manipulation about net neutrality. We all know your arguments against it are horse shit, and you're just being greedy shits. So just stop. And most of all... stop with the regional monopolies and political bribes/blackmail, and let competition in. If your service is truly good enough you will beat the competition. Have some fucking balls and start embracing the free market you chicken-shit assholes.   I'm sure I'm missing many other points. But this is a start."

I believe I know which ISP you are referring to that you would like to get. I work for them in another state. If they really wanted in that MDU (multi dwelling unit), they would be there. Sure you might get local people saying they would love to come in there to give you service, but the people who control the money will disagree.   It costs a lot of money to bring a service to a place that has no existing infrastructure. The engineers along with management will look at how much the project will cost and what is the probable number of customer's they'll get in the neighborhood or MDU. Then based on that, how long to recoup their investment. If it is too long then they just will simply not do it.   It makes it more difficult since Comcast is already well established there. So maybe they would calculate getting 10-30% of the residents there. Depending on a number of factors, we could be looking at a $10,000 or a $100,000 project.   It's harder for smaller ISPs, because you really do need to pick your battles and pick which areas you can effectively compete in.  Even though I work for one, I would love to see ISPs regulated like utilities, because it really is more of a necessity anymore.  Either have them government run entities or highly regulated. I would love to see cable companies forced to sublease their lines out to other companies selling services. That is what the government did to the phone companies to do after the breakup of ma bell in the 80s."

If we had markets that had more service providers than grocery chains, I could see it, or an infrastructure where the last mile was municipally owned and terminating in a co-locate facility where you could shop among several providers.  But we predominately have areas served by an average of less than 2 broadband providers, and sometimes when you think you have two you only really have one. (Most Florida franchises do not require cable companies to offer broadband service, or to offer it to every subscriber).   Free market policies only work in marketplaces where there are a plethora of buyers and sellers."

Or...  2) Split them up (but then the same number of data lines in each area, not helping the problem), not to mention many municipalities have non-compete clauses with big ISPs rendering this moot, or...  3) Remove non-compete clauses, give incentives to start-up ISP companies to compete (due to high cost of entry), and strictly enforce antitrust laws."

What I've found is if you call in and complain about the charges, they drop them. So I think they recognize it's unreasonable, but they still do it because plenty of people don't call in, and it makes them money.  Good luck getting even that amount of service from comcast though."

Most of the time even if the charges are legitimate, they'll take it off (AT&T customer service, not her store). You might have to escalate it instead of letting them brush it off, but they will do it.  That said, she also has repeat offenders that come in regularly.

It doesn't take a genius to read between the lines; they want private/corporate entities (hi ISP companies) to control the internet. Remember, it's Internet-SERVICE-provider, not Internet Provider. The way they twist words is such a load of shit. Don't let them convolute the real conversation. The internet is made up of the content that THE PEOPLE (us!) create. The internet is for the people, not for blood sucking megalomaniac fascist corporations to control.   Lets follow the money:  Ted Cruz (R-TX) accepted $119K from the ""internet industry"" so far this year. He also has received money from a ""Communications/Electronics"" PAC.  Orrin Harch (R-UT) takes significant campaign contributions from the ""TV/Movies/Music"" industry, and also has a PAC set up from the ""Communications/Electronics"" industry.

In order for a democracy to function there needs to be a roughly free flowing exchange of Ideas that can be considered by the majority. The internet is a major force in our world because it truly has the potential to be an exchange where this can happen fairly and frequently. ISPs act as gatekeepers in that they can provide or deny access to this marketplace. It can be argued that they have a moral and civic duty to provide unbiased access to this potential marketplace thus allowing for the potential growth of a healthy positive democracy.   This isn't even talking about the effect that having access to decent internet can have on areas of extreme poverty. You can see a drastic difference in income of an area from this addition. Yet even though Comcast and TWC were already paid to build out the infrastructure to provide this service to impoverished areas they have been negligent on this because it isn't profitable. The connection isn't even limited to the US you can find the same is true nearly everywhere else in the world. Even just having the access through a wireless carrier can empower and enrich people simply because of the opportunity that is provided from that access.  Next look at Chattanooga TN, and the battle they are currently having with their state government that wants to make their operation illegal. Here you have a community that came together and had an opportunity to make their internet infrastructure better, then did so, and is now having to defend their right to make that choice. Major money interest is infringing on the rights of local government.  If none of those topics listed above are not considered a ""Social Issue"", ""Community Problem"", or ""Civic Concern"" then your professor must have a very particular definition of what they mean and should further define it. If they do have something different in mind message me and let me know what it is because I can pretty much guarantee you that I can help frame the topic."

At the same time, they won't build out to these communities, leaving them with nothing. The Internet Must Go, a mockumentary made around the time of the initial Verizon court case, does a pretty good job of portraying this. It starts at around 20:30, but you should watch the whole thing if you haven't already (though, remember, some of the figures in this may be outdated). The internet is already so vital to our day to day lives, it's kinda hard to see how people in our own country are denied access to it arbitrarily. Emphasize what impact this has.

They should not care about the order at which those 0s and 1s come in, especially when ""the internet"" is nothing hosted on their service providence network.  I don't care if it's TOR or whatever else. They should not be able to dictate what kind of traffic you're allowed to have/tunnel through your connection because it ""might"" be illegal.

WarOnComcast,2g8fza,tyranicalteabagger,3,Sat Sep 13 04:43:49 2014 UTC,"They already did.  Cable subscriptions are declining rapidly and Comcast is trying to leverage HBO's popularity to maintain their monopoly.    Game of Thrones is the most pirated show in history by a pretty staggering margin.  A lot of people can't pay for the show at any cost, and this is because HBO is so tightly bound to cable providers as the sole distributor.  I refuse to use Comcast cable and have no other option, so for last season's Game of Thrones I paid Comcast for an HBO subscription solely so that I could use HBO GO on my TV, and did not allow them to install a cable box in my home.  Comcast blocked this from working on all of my devices.  It was impossible for me to pay to watch HBO without sacrificing my ideals and doing it exactly the way Comcast demands.  This season, I've purchased a satellite dish for my neighbor, had it installed and set up, and am covering his HBO billâ¦ solely so that I have a functional HBO GO subscription.  I've had to go a long ways to pay a lot of money to watch just one show.  There are much easier and much more free ways to do this.  If it's both substantially easier and cheaper to do something, most people are going to do that."

I bet I will have to pay for the ""big sports package"" for the two measly channels that carry the content I want. As soon as everyone can dump all the channels they don't want and drastically reduce their bill, who is going to fund the content? With a lot less cash, shows with a high production budget are out the window.

WarOnComcast,2g3t2d,oxjox,3,Fri Sep 12 03:22:49 2014 UTC,"I've been told by a technician that they also sprinkle these randomly through service areas. Back when I had a roommate, we had Comcast call us more than once to say they detected signal loss and wanted to send someone out. We noticed no issues with TV or internet service.  They sent a guy out twice who came in, re-cabled, tested out to the nearest junction box, and explained that they were getting bad readings for unknown reasons. The signal was within spec. The second time they sent him out, he replaced the modem, the TV receiver, the inbound cable, and replaced the connectors on every cable to rule out reflection. They never called back after that, so whatever caused it had been sufficiently fixed.   I had my first bona-fide outage last night, oddly enough, for a couple of hours. When I called in, I got a recording that based on my phone number, I was known to be having issues and someone was being dispatched already. It said I was a VIP member, but they might say that to everyone with no late payments, or maybe everyone. Anyway, it was nice to not have to run through the script with some clown asking me to reboot and unplug shit - it just told me they were aware of a problem with my service, and it was already being worked on. I called a friend about a block away, and their service was up, so it was a pretty localized outage that got fixed at 9:00 PM without hassle.  I have to say, I was pretty pleased overall, with the exception of the outage in the first place."
WarOnComcast,2g3t2d,moikederp,8,Thu Sep 11 18:08:16 2014 UTC,"The reason why you got called proactively could only be due to backnoise feeding into their network.  When houses aren't grounded properly or have something jacked within their wiring, they emit an amazing amount of 'noise' that feeds back into the system which more than likely affects others within the same node.  The way they detect these is by having trucks driving around your neighborhoods with listening devices.  It's their 'leakage' program.  Their billing system is what is used to flag you as a VIP, and someone had to have proper access to do that.  (The regular folks you talk to on the phone typically do not have those privileges.)  Your real name isn't Ralph or Brian Roberts is it? ;-)"
WarOnComcast,2g3t2d,moikederp,8,Thu Sep 11 18:14:44 2014 UTC,"The first time the tech came out, he plugged his gear in and said we were within spec, and wasn't sure why he was dispatched. The second time is when he just replaced everything he could  - I think to avoid getting called back out. There was visible damage on one of the runs of coax, but it didn't seem to affect the signal (according to him from measuring before/after replacement). Perhaps it was a poorly-terminated line reflecting back, but he still wasn't convinced there was an actual problem to begin with.  A couple of years ago when I moved to my current location, I did have serious issues with fluctuating download speeds, but not uploads. I had someone out a few times, replaced more coax, and said that I should try to get my landlord to pay to have the whole building re-wired. I wish she would, because it's a tattered mess up the side and back of the building. I also had a card tucked into my door from the ""Priority Install / Priority Pricing - Territory Manager"" in the area - maybe he put VIP on the account?   Just like the Tootsie Pop Conundrum, the world may never know."
WarOnComcast,2g3t2d,moikederp,5,Thu Sep 11 18:28:05 2014 UTC,"That strengthens my suspicion that you only were contacted because of the screaming leakage that your location had.  When that tech got there the first time, it was for a leakage job.  The strength of the signal isn't the only thing that would cause leakage.  (For example: if you have any of their AnyRoom DVR technologies [X1, AnyRoom], and they didn't put a MOCA filter on your feed in, all of the network transactions that should stay within your house get 'leaked' back onto their Comcast network.)  So, this poor tech got what is called a 'repeat' ding on him since he didn't properly fix the issue the first time.  That is why he took so many measures on the second trip...  The only techs with leakage detecting devices don't actually do much other than drive around, so most techs that come to your house wouldn't be able to determine if something was 'screaming' noise.  I have a perfect signal to my house (I used to monitor that shit daily when I worked in the engineering group to gain a better understanding of how everything works), yet I get a shit-ton of FEC errors, un-responded to TCP requests, etc.  This is the noise I'm talking about.  My signal has no bearing on this 'noise'.  The symptoms I have noticed with  my X1 is that I can hit buttons on  my remote and about 80% of the time it works, while the other 20% of the time, my box looks frozen.  I can't do anything about it now that I've left that company.  Any premise tech (techs that go to our houses) would not have a clue as to how to resolve, so I just deal with it and accept my fate."

Comcast clearly has a ""hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil"" mandate when it comes to allowing actual customer complaints to reach the company's top echelon. It gives them plausible deniability when they assure regulators that their company is striving for excellence, when the folks in the trenches are either trying to sell you something when they should be fixing your problem or just trying to get you off the phone without costing the company any money."

I had a terrible time trying to get rid of my internet service, as the representative was doing what I expect is their job - trying to retain me as a customer. I can't fault >you for that. However, this representative, Christine, Operator ID: 1H0, decided that it would be appropriate to remove my internet service, and promptly add not >only HBO to my account, but upgrade my cable package without my consent, without my acknowledgement, without even asking.

Gerald > It is not and we dont do this online. ME_ > But you do it over the phone? Gerald > That I dont know about them as I am for billing chat only.  This is pretty alarming to me. As some sort of recourse, your phone representatives can add or upgrade service as they see fit? Is this a joke?

Please let me know how you plan to rectify this.  Best,   Immediately following the slew of 40+ rejection emails of ""this email doesn't exist"", I hadn't given up hope, and just waited around. About two hours later, a flood of calls started pouring on my phone. Randy, a supervisor, had been forwarded the email, and was most excellent. He made sure everything was taken care of, cut my bill in half, gave me the free NFL package, and took away any rental fees for a year. A plan that (absurdly) would have cost $110 is now at the low low price of $49.99. For a year. Not half bad.  But, then I kept getting calls. I've had about 8-10 calls now, from various levels of folks at Comcast, trying to rectify this matter. Pretty alarming that even though they knew it was taken care of, they called to speak to me about it, etc. I'm impressed."

WarOnComcast,2fydf6,Fingledobe,11,Tue Sep 9 23:18:45 2014 UTC,What? Even on the picture of the website you posted it says 44.99 a month for 12 months for the Turbo 20/2. That is their promotional price if you order online. If you go into a TWC branch and pick that same package it is 49.99 a month for 12 months.  They are pulling the same standard bullshit of promo rates and a big increase after. This is why you need to do the call and cancel every year to get them to lower the price.
WarOnComcast,2fydf6,earthwormjim91,5,Wed Sep 10 03:15:22 2014 UTC,It would make sense if it was a contract.... But now with month to month... It makes no sense to do business like this...  You literally have to threaten to cancel every year like you said. I took her four seconds to lower the price to lower than the normal rate. It's disgusting.
WarOnComcast,2fydf6,earthwormjim91,2,Wed Sep 10 04:51:03 2014 UTC,"It is absolutely disgusting. I have to go through it with Cox as well. Actually just this month my promotional rate went out. I live on base though, so my choices are Cox at any of their speeds, or AT&T DSL which caps at 4 Mbps down. I can't even threaten to cancel. I just tell them that I can't afford it and to knock me down the next level. They usually take 10 bucks off my bill, but it's always a few bucks higher than what it had been."
WarOnComcast,2fydf6,havelotsofsax,1 point,Wed Sep 10 05:12:16 2014 UTC,"More than likely, the star beside the $54.99 in your letter was indicating that was the price before taxes. And online pricing is different than calling in and speaking with sales. Normally $5 cheaper."
WarOnComcast,2fydf6,nssdrone,-2,Wed Sep 10 11:20:49 2014 UTC,"Those prices in the image ARE the promo rates, what are you talking about?"
WarOnComcast,2fydf6,nssdrone,1 point,Wed Sep 10 16:25:58 2014 UTC,"Then why were they trying to up my rate $10 above what those rates in the picture are.  The fact of the matter is that they were offering me a promotional rate of $54.99 a month for the 20/2 connection...  That is after I have been a customer for well over 2 years.  I even changed to these ""promotional rates"" in the middle of last year well after I have been a customer for over a year. so the garbage that they are for new customers only is a total lie on their end or why would I be able to change after I had been a customer for over a year.  The whole situation doesn't add up and the fact that I called in to cancel and they lowered my rate to 49 99 a month means that they do not even care what they charge people as long as they're reaming us up the ass.  They raised the rates to see how far you'll take it and when you complain they lower them again."
WarOnComcast,2fydf6,nssdrone,-1,Wed Sep 10 16:38:19 2014 UTC,"I never said they have to charge you full price, they don't admit it but they are flexible if they need to be to retain a customer. That doesn't change the fact that the prices you showed us are limited time frame (12 month) PROMOTION prices. They offer that to new customers. If you negotiate with them, they often extend that promo pricing, or offer you some compromise to keep you as a customer.   The letter you got was their way of saying your promo pricing was expiring, and If you are month to month, they have every right, and their is nothing anti customer about it."

Luckily, I just gave her a general area where I have service. I refuse to give anyone my personal information that can't help me and can't tell me who could.

Apparently, upgrading to Blast is useless anyway (according to the one tech support guy) but if you are using hardline than maybe it isn't. I keep thinking that there's no way a company this big can have such a large percentage of incompetent employees, but I'm starting to think that their bigness is what CAUSES the incompetence. Either that, or one of the first rules in the handbook is to tell the customer that the last person they spoke to gave them the wrong information, because I've heard that now more than ever.  I think the worst thing in all of this, for me at least, is that Comcast doesn't seem to care. Apart from the ""I'm sorry you are experiencing _____ and I do understand your _______"" (which I've heard now too many times to believe it), I haven't gotten one useful answer or work done to fix my problems.  Anyway, I'm sorry that you had to go through that, and I hope you never have to again. I wonder if there's an upgraded package that gives you a direct link to someone who can actually fix issues as they arise, because I'd rather pay for that than for ""faster"" speeds that I never seem to get."
WarOnComcast,2fthbj,Natirs,1 point,Tue Sep 9 02:43:41 2014 UTC,"Having a variance in wifi speeds between devices makes total sense.

WarOnComcast,2fthbj,Mfluffyk,2,Tue Sep 9 02:32:43 2014 UTC,"We are definitely buying our own equipment. That comcast tech was the only person who actually seemed legit to me. We tried to disable the public portion of the modem/router but were derailed from that objective pretty quickly by the phone rep. The Wireless Gateway they sent me is apparently bad anyway, so once I get all of this taken care of, they're  getting their modem back.   I wouldn't doubt them all being disgruntled either."
WarOnComcast,2fthbj,Natirs,2,Tue Sep 9 02:56:43 2014 UTC,"The tech that advised you to get your own equipment is a friend of mine. I used to work there too until I couldn't take it anymore. Employees are under high stress and constantly getting threatened to get fired if they don't meet the set goals of calls handled per hour; all that after crap pay. Obviously a rush to end the call is not gonna bring up quality. Supervisors have many times advised to just hang up on difficult tickets.  As for the hardware, they lease out only 4 models of wireless gateways, each crappier than the other. Problem is, if there is a speed or quality issue once you get your own stuff, they'll blame your equipment. Your best bet would be to try and get a basic modem from them (no wifi) as well as an ethernet cable (again so they don't blame your equipment) and buy your own wireless router. They are contractually obligated to provide you with a certain speed.  EDIT: When a tech over the phone tells you to swap the router because of the range/signal issue, service centers don't even quality check the returned one, they just put it back into circulation like nothing happened."

Everything sane gives you their throughput rates in variants of bytes/second. Comcast, though, gives their throughput rate in variants of bits/second. This means that their numbers come through ~8x higher for the same connection. In turn, that means your three megabyte/second Steam download is using up (3x8) roughly twenty-four megabits/second before accounting for metadata.  The reason Comcast (and all other providers) still use these outdated analog-modem measurement scales, essentially, is because the numbers are bigger and bigger numbers sell better."

Under the deceptively-named Consumer Choice act of 2007, cable companies can opt for a state franchise to supplant a local one. Comcast has done this in most if not all of its Florida service areas.  One of the ""features"" of the state legislation is it completely deregulates internet service unless TCP/IP is used as the underlying technology to provide classic cable services; even then, TCP/IP used to provide Internet service is not regulated.  Which means in Florida, it isn't really a duopoly, its one provider mandated to provide service and another one that can do so at its whim and caprice.  Making internet service so expensive that it is cheaper to get video, or not providing it at all is an ace in the hole for Comcast in Florida."

But if they are forced into a corner on an internet-only install where they'd have to do a buildout, they'll simply not take the order as long as they can and then finally admit that they aren't going to install because it would cost them too much.

If the person takes the settlements he leaves with a sizable wad of cash and the Company is allowed to continue the presumably profitable practices that lead the suit to be brought about, or, the lawyers continue to negotiate until the plaintiff can't afford it anymore.

WarOnComcast,2f4mg3,tsmartin123,1 point,Mon Sep 1 14:10:46 2014 UTC,"There hasn't been a class action against Comcast because of its arbitration provision, Â¶ 13. It requires that customers opt-out within 30 days of receiving the Agreement. The Agreement was in the ""Welcome Packet"" of stuff you got when you first had a technician install your equipment or when you picked it up/received it in the mail. Most people are unaware of it until the 30 day period has passed.   The arbitration clause prevents class actions in two major ways:   On a practical level, to get a class certified in federal court, you have to meet the requirements of FRCP 23. Long story short, out of the handful (relatively speaking) that opted-out in time, I highly doubt the class would be able to meet these requirements and be certified. Because of the relative low probability of certification, most-class action attorneys will not take the case. They are paid on a contingency rather than billing basis, meaning that they only get paid when the case gets resolved in the class members' favor or there is a settlement. Both scenarios require class certification, which as mentioned before, is a low probability. Under the provisions of Comcast's Arbitration Provision, a customer can only bring individual claims for arbitration, which means that he/she cannot bring class claims.   Having said all of that, the Arbitration Provision doesn't preclude customers from bringing individual claims in small-claims court. However, the claims that are heard in small claims courts are based on causes of action that require actual monetary damages and a casual link between Comcast's actions and the damages you suffered. However, if you do file a claim in small claims court, Comcast will probably want to settle and pay you (a minimal amount, but still more than your damages) instead of actually going through the whole process."

WarOnComcast,2ezkzl,PBCliberal,36,Sat Aug 30 06:44:01 2014 UTC,"TL;DR Netflix points out that Comcast was selling customers more expensive packages with higher speeds, even though Comcast was still throttling their Netflix speeds.  They refer to the case 14 years ago when AT&T and MediaOne -- the Time Warner and Comcast of today -- were denied a merger by the FCC, and how Comcast/Time Warner are conveniently ignoring this precedent.  Netflix clarifies that they aren't ""dumping"" content on Comcast, that they go through CDNs (whom they already pay pricey fees) that then give the content to Comcast to deliver to customers at speeds they paid for, therefore Comcast has no reason not to offer higher speeds at reasonable costs."
WarOnComcast,2ezkzl,yoloswagrofl,22,Sat Aug 30 15:40:20 2014 UTC,"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  Comcast Corporation (""Comcast"") and Time Warner Cable, Inc. (""TWC"") (together, ""Applicants"") ask the Federal Communications Commission (""FCC"" or ""Commission"") to approve their application to become the nation's largest onramp to the Internet. The Commission should reject the request.  The proposed merger puts at risk the end-to-end principle that has characterized the Internet and been a key driver in the creation of the most important communications platform in history. Unsurprisingly, given their dominance in the cable television marketplace, the proposed merger would give Applicants the ability to turn a consumer's Internet experience into something that more closely resembles cable television. It would set up an ecosystem that calls into question what we to date have taken for granted: that a consumer who pays for connectivity to the Internet will be able to get the content she requests.  The combined entity would have the incentive and ability-through access fees charged at interconnection points and by other means-to harm Internet companies, such as online video distributors (""OVDs""), which Applicants view as competitors. The transaction would give Applicants control of a dominant share of the nation's residential high-speed broadband customers at a time when those customers increasingly engage with more content-rich applications that require high-speed broadband to work properly, such as Internet-delivered video.   Regulators faced a nearly identical fact pattern 14 years ago when AT&T and MediaOne-then the nation's two largest cable companies-sought to merge. The combined company would have controlled nearly 40 percent of the nation's broadband households. AT&T owned a majority stake in a broadband provider known as Excite@Home and MediaOne owned a substantial stake in a broadband provider known as RoadRunner. The federal government intervened, however, and insisted that those applicants divest one of the broadband businesses, because the combined company otherwise would have had a significantly increased ability to harm Internet content providers in the national market for high-speed broadband distribution of edge provider content.   Applicants fail to account for this precedent. They fail to identify, let alone address, the Department of Justice's (""DOJ'') and Commission's view of the relevant market by which the government should view this transaction. And, they fail to address the identified harms, required divestitures, and other remedies involved in the AT&T-MediaOne merger.   This Transaction is proposed at a critical time for consumers. OVDs have re-imagined the way in which consumers access and enjoy video content-enabling consumers to access through an intuitive user interface a rich library of content at times and locations of the customer's choosing. In response to OVD innovation, users increasingly demand more Internet-delivered video that they have paid high-speed broadband providers to access. In turn, broadband providers can attract new subscribers and sell existing customers more robust Internet speeds. The Commission has identified this phenomenon as a ""virtuous circle."" As a result of this phenomenon, there are now more broadband subscribers than MVPD subscribers in the country.  Despite the boon OVDs have been for the broadband market, Applicants are clear that they see OVDs as a threat to their core video business. Comcast already has acted to lessen that threat by using its control over interconnection pathways to allow its own customers' access to Netflix content to degrade until Netflix paid Comcast a terminating access fee. OVDs are particularly vulnerable to congestion and degradation of their services, owing to the myriad video providers available to consumers, the low costs of switching OVDs, and the sensitivity to congestion of video streaming traffic.   At the same time, there is nothing in the market to discipline the behavior of the combined entity: Comcast's and TWC's customers often lack any (let alone several) viable alternative broadband provider that is capable of providing the download speeds necessary to enjoy video content; and the high cost of switching ISPs, compared to the low cost of switching OVDs, makes it likely that OVDs will feel the brunt of consumer disappointment, not ISPs. In addition, at the same time Comcast engaged in strategies to degrade its own customers' ability to watch Netflix's video, Comcast sold customers who wanted access to high-quality Netflix video a more expensive broadband package even as it knew that a higher-speed broadband plan would do nothing to address the quality ofNetflix's video.   In Netflix's experience, there are four ISPs that have the market power to engage in degradation strategies to harm OVDs. Two of those four propose to merge in this Transaction. Consequently, the proposed merger would significantly strengthen the harms to consumers and to Internet content distributors, such as OVDs. The business models employed by several OVDs necessarily depend on having access to a ""critical mass"" of consumers to operate profitably. Achieving and maintaining this critical mass allows OVDs to purchase programming and develop products more cheaply, but it also goes to the heart of an OVD's ability to retain subscribers and invest in new content. Particularly for fixed-cost OVDs the sudden loss of access to a significant number of customers could immediately throw the OVD into financial peril. And as a result of this merger, Comcast would have significantly greater power to engage in a variety of foreclosure strategies to make it harder for OVDs to provide streaming services to Comcast subscribers, including raising-rivals-costs strategies to squeeze the finances of OVDs. More troubling, Comcast may become large enough as a result of this merger to prevent a new OVD from ever reaching the critical mass necessary to provide viable national service to American consumers.   Comcast has suggested that OVDs should be required to pay interconnection fees to help pay for all the traffic they are ""dumping"" onto its network. This characterization is false. Netflix does not deliver a single bit of traffic that a broadband provider's customer does not request. Moreover, OVDs pay content delivery networks (""CDNs"") and transit providers, at great expense, to carry that requested traffic all the way to Comcast's door step. Comcast's only responsibility is to do what it already has assured its customers it will do: carry that traffic the remainder of the way and at the speed for which Comcast's own customers already have paid.   This threat to the OVD industry is significant and a fundamental public interest harm too heavy to be balanced against the speculative benefits of this Transaction. Moreover, that threat also undermines Applicants' proposed public interest benefits, which expressly depend on the viability of existing OVDs and the ability of new OVDs to reach the critical mass necessary to operate.  Nor is this threat limited to OVDs. The combined entity's control over its interconnection arrangements, coupled with such an increase in size, would allow it to insert itself into the heart of all Internet commerce, disrupting innovation, reducing financing for edge providers, and foreclosing compelling services from ever reaching the light of day. While this threat remains, the proposed merger cannot be justified under the FCC's public interest standard."

WarOnComcast,2es7fo,totes_meta_bot,2,Thu Aug 28 17:22:33 2014 UTC,"Update: Comcast tech came out and spent a good hour and a half changing out the modem, checking all the lines, signals, etc. My Dad said that he was really helpful, but in my experience the tech's always are. Anyway, the tech I'm sure was probably checking out to see if the vulnerable adult claim was factual. Dad got two robo calls one to make sure the tech showed up and the other to complete a satisfaction survey. But as far as my knowledge did not get a phone call from an actual person. At least its fixed.  So, all together she was without a phone for 5 days. Even the tech was unsure why it would take that long. I could understand a short period of time, say 24 hours. I know other providers escalate phone issues to be resolved within 24 hours. I have to wonder why Comcast does not? Or do they and this is once again horrific customer service? In any case it isn't right and should never have happened. ever. I'm thankful they were able to get her phone back up and working in less than 24 hours of my letter to them. I do want others to know about the issue so they can be mindful over their own seniors or vulnerable adults, however.   Thank you everyone for your advise, kind words and suggestions."

WarOnComcast,2esimo,Kwahn,10,Thu Aug 28 03:50:12 2014 UTC,"If you have any advice, comments or suggestions, please tell me what I could do at this juncture. I plan to call their Loyalty department tomorrow.  tl;dr: It takes 1 idiot 1 minute with 1 button to break my internet, and 8 hours for a team of departments in the largest American ISP to fix it. By being incredibly tenacious, patient, and polite to even the biggest of idiots (It's not their fault - just trying to work a shitty job. Never be an ass!), you, too, can get shit on slightly less by a monopolistic corporation!  LIE COUNT: 4 HANGUP COUNT: 2 FAILED-TO-RESOLVE-PROBLEM COUNT: 7 DISSATISFACTION COUNT: YES  Comcast and The Failed Transfer.  My tale begins at 12 PM on a Tuesday. I'm moving soon, from my current apartment to a new apartment in the same complex. I submit a move request to Comcast through their site - it asks me to specify a disconnect date for my current apartment, and a connect date for the new one. I'm moving next month, on the 12th, so I tell them to connect the new on the 12th, and disconnect the old on the 13th. Seems simple enough, right?  I then get a call from Comcast verifying that, indeed, I want this move scheduled for next month. Their information is accurate, and makes sense - and I agree. All good, right? Move scheduled for next month? However, they want me to pay $12.95 for the privilege of paying them money for the next year. ""Fine"", I say - and they confirm it and the call ends normally. But this is where everything goes horribly, horribly wrong. 5 minutes later, my internet cuts out. The modem lights sinisterly cut out, and all are dark, except for the glaring, green eye of the power button. Then they light up. All are connected. My loading page turns into http://i.imgur.com/Qx4uCif.png and requests authenticaton of my account number and phone number. Then the lights cut out again, before lighting up, one-by-one, as if trapped in a repeating, existential hell of booting and failing to authorize. The authentication page is unusable.  ""Well shit"", I say to myself. ""That can't be right. Let me call them back.""  I call the transfers department that contacted me initially, and explain that shortly after my transfer request for next month, my internet cut out. Transfers department says ""Most likely not related, so let me transfer you to our tech support department."" Line cuts out, end scene.  After realizing I was hung up on, I call back, and request the general tech support department. I get a somewhat hard-to-understand woman who looks into it, and says ""This doesn't look like something we can fix immediately. I'll write a ticket, and have someone call you back within an hour to resolve it."" I'm skeptical, as I've never had an issue go to ticket with Comcast, but I let them write the ticket, and resolve to take a 1-hour break from this.  One short power-nap later, I, naturally, have not been called. I call Comcast back, and get their general tech support. This guy sounds like he knows what's up! He sounds like he cares, realizes the transfer agent made a huge mistake, and says that he'll work to get the service back to my current apartment. Puts me on ""hold"" (Comcast agents hate to put people on hold, and prefer the mute-hold - I wonder if it's to avoid ""check-in"" timer requirements. Either way, I thank them. Screw that music!) . Comes back, says ""It should all be fixed, and activated in about 10 minutes. If not, I'm to call their activaton line (855-OKBEGIN) and request that they activate the service. I thank him, hang up, and wait 15 minutes. Silently, alone, and despondent, I watch as my modem, trapped in its cycle, continues to work very hard at accomplishing nothing (much like my calls).  I call the activaton line, and this is where it gets fun. They see a transfer-in-progress, and will try to activate it. 15 minutes later, they see a transfer-in-progress, and the agent insincerely wishes they could do something, but cannot do anything about the transfer-in-progress that the previous agent supposedly cancelled. She tells me to call the billing department. I ask if she can transfer me - puts me on hold for about 5 seconds, then says ""Oooh saaaaaaaahry, the billing department is closed for the day."" I'm a bit miffed at this point, but ever-polite as I ask to speak to a supervisor or manager. ""They'll just say the same thing"", which worries me a bit, and you'll see why. I then ask if there's any chance of compensation for this - ""You'll have to talk to our loyalty department, which is closed right now. So sorry, so sorry."" Then they hang up on me.  So I call the billing department. I get an answer, and my first question is, ""The tech support agent I talked to says you're closed. Is that true?"" (I ask politely, almost jokingly.) They say, ""No, we're open - that's very strange."" So I explain what I've been going through, and they say ""Give me a few minutes to look into this."" Girl seems to have a clue, and goes and works on it for a bit. Then they come back and say ""Well, this is an unusual situation. Your cancelled transfer is in progress, and scheduled to both be when you want it, and right now. So I'm deleting everything, transferring your connection to {new apartment address}, and then re-scheduling it."" I'm like, shit, sounds like we're getting somewhere. Then I realize - ""Did you say {new apartment address}? It's supposed to go to {old apartment address}. They apologize and state that COMCAST'S SYSTEM RANDOMLY SWITCHES THE TO AND FROM FOR TRANSFERS, which makes filling out the form confusing. That sounds ludicrous to me, but they assure me it will be fixed, and work on it. 20 minutes later, they come back and proudly state ""It should be working in about 5-10 minutes - and if not, call our activations department!"" I'm paranoid, as that's what the tech agent said, and I voice my concerns. However, I decide to ask to be transferred to Loyalty Department, as I ""would like my $12.95 refunded, since this transfer's been a bit disastrous so far"". They completely understand and patch me through to the loyalty department.  Loyalty was, by far, the quickest department to talk to. I explained that I wanted a refund on the transfer fee since they knocked out my internet and were unable to restore it for hours. ""Is your internet still out?"" they asked, a hint of mirth in their voice. I check, and it is. ""Then you need tech support! OFF WITH YOU!"" It felt like being Moonside-banished in Earthbound - I was with tech support again before I even knew what was happening. All too quickly, I was with the second-to-last department I'd be with that day.  Tech support asked what my issue was. I gave them the TL;DR: Transfer broke internet, all the king's horses and men can't put it back together again. Tech support spends about 45 minutes at this point contacting every department I've talked to - Activations, Transfers, Billing, Loyalty, and Tech Support. With their powers combined, THEY DID IT! Mission completed - The Internet Was SAVED. I thanked them gratuitously for correcting the previous technicians' errors, and asked to be transferred to the Loyalty Department to request a possible transfer fee refund for this mess. ""Absolutely"", she said, in her most sincere voice, and my phone rang one final time.  ""The Loyalty Department is currently closed, and will be open again tomorrow, during business hours."" THE END  So now what do I do?"
WarOnComcast,2esimo,cive666,5,Thu Aug 28 03:50:20 2014 UTC,"When I was bouncing apartments every year I would take my cable modem with me to the prospective apartment and see if it would connect.  If it did I would not call for a transfer of service until I moved in.  A cable modem has really no tie to a street address and will work if it is in the same general area.  This way they push the transfer through that day, and I say everything is working and I don't need a tech.  Never once failed me.  They rarely disco apartments when people move out because they know someone will be in there shortly."
WarOnComcast,2esimo,ZiggyTheHamster,7,Thu Aug 28 15:50:57 2014 UTC,"This.  Your MAC address is allowed, not your residence. Separately from that, your residence may have a filter installed that blocks the frequencies used by the Internet, which requires a tech to rectify, but in most cases you can either take it off yourself because the box isn't locked or you don't have a filter at all. This is especially true in an apartment.  The idiots in the transfer department should have just scheduled a tech on the 13th to remove the filter and on the 12th to add a filter and left the modem provisioning alone. The tech who works your building might know that there are no filters and then be able to bill two jobs without doing any work and then everybody wins."

Since they probably fubar'd your service, I'd tell them to remove the request that you are moving. Let them turn your internet back on, and then a two weeks before you move, set a cancel date. Then proceed to Step 1.   Also don't be afraid to cancel periodically/switch providers to get better rates."

His warnings about the Comcast deal, as well as AT&Tâs $48.5 billion bid for DirecTV, echo a fear that some television groups have expressed about the pending mergers: The deals would create behemoths that will use their heft to push around networks, forcing them to either cut the fees they charge for their programming or risk being thrown off the air. Some executives say the consolidation would result in challenges for new networks, especially those with niche or underserved audiences, and a lack of diversity on TV.  âAs media companies get bigger, there always is the sense that the East Coast, West Coast and the N.F.L. cities are very well represented,â said Amy Yong, a media analyst at Macquarie Securities. âThe rest of the U.S. gets ignored sometimes.â  While few executives at larger broadcasters have publicly opposed the deals â though they complain privately â Mr. Gottsch has stirred up a dust storm. The polka party this month was his first stop on a tour of state fairs, rodeos and farmersâ conventions to rustle up opposition. In Washington, he has hired a lobbying firm and appeared before a House antitrust subcommittee, the F.C.C. and the Justice Department. His two stations, RFD-TV and Family Net, have run spots urging viewers to speak out. Of the more than 63,000 comments filed to the F.C.C. about the proposed merger, about a fifth mention RFD-TV.  Several other companies have joined Rural Media in denouncing the Comcast acquisition, which would give it control of 35 percent of the countryâs broadband Internet service coverage and 16 of the countryâs top 20 cable markets. Netflix, the Internet streaming business, and Dish, a satellite television provider, have urged regulators to reject the bid. And The Blaze, the conservative channel run by Glenn Beck, has collected 42,000 comments from viewers that it plans to submit to the F.C.C. before the public comment period closes on Monday, a spokesman for the network said. Continue reading the main story  Mr. Gottsch said he did not strictly oppose the Comcast-Time Warner Cable and AT&T-DirecTV deals, but he wanted conditions added to ensure that his networks and other independent channels were carried to maintain a diverse programming slate. Some critics question his motives, however, as companies often exploit mergers to negotiate better financial terms.  In a letter to Mr. Gottsch dated Aug. 15, David L. Cohen, an executive vice president at Comcast, wrote, âYour efforts to drive a wedge between Comcast and rural viewers as a means to promote your own business interests is unfair and grossly inaccurate.â  Mr. Cohen said Comcast had not abandoned rural programming and continued to carry the network in cities like Nashville and Salt Lake City. He said Mr. Gottschâs campaign had confirmed what his company already knew: Some viewers want rural-themed programming.  âComcastâs commitment to rural-themed programming is simply not just about you and your self-interested pecuniary interests, which now seems to be the exclusive focus of your advocacy,â Mr. Cohen wrote. Photo Patrick Gottsch of the Rural Media Group is one of the nationâs most vocal critics of the proposed media consolidation. Credit Bryce Bridges for The New York Times  Mr. Gottsch fears he has much to lose. He dreamed up the concept of a rural-themed network in the 1980s while selling satellite dishes. In the 1990s, he put together a business plan for RFD-TV, named for the Rural Free Delivery services established in the late 19th century to deliver mail to farm families. Willie Nelson was an early supporter, contributing his library of music shows like âPop Goes the Country.â  But after Mr. Gottsch had trouble securing financing and getting his programming picked up, he started RFD-TV as a nonprofit public interest channel. In December 2000, Dish Network became the first service to carry it. RFD-TV became a profit-making entity in 2007.  Today, the 24-hour cable network is carried by more than a half dozen cable and satellite providers, reaching about 40 million homes. Still, it attracts a relatively small audience. This year, through July, RFD-TV had an average of 137,000 viewers during prime time, according to Nielsen. In contrast, Comcastâs USA Network drew 2.3 million prime-time viewers and Time Warnerâs Headline News network 335,000.  The Rural Media Group, which is based in Omaha, also includes a satellite radio station and a magazine. It is profitable and on track to make about $40 million in revenue this year, Mr. Gottsch said. Its flagship, RFD-TV, features 6.5 hours of rural news a day and a mix of agriculture, equine, rural lifestyle and entertainment programming. Like other TV companies, it makes money two ways: through fees from the providers that carry its programming and by selling ads. The more homes a network is in, the bigger the potential audience for advertisers, and the more money for the network.  Fewer homes probably mean less money, and the mergers have Mr. Gottsch worried about his companyâs fate. A warning sign came last year when Comcast pulled the network off the air in Colorado and New Mexico. RFD-TVâs contract with Time Warner Cable has expired. DirecTV does not offer Family Net, and AT&Tâs U-verse has not had an agreement to carry RFD-TV, though it does carry Family Net.  âOnce we gain approval to acquire DirecTV, which has nationwide reach, and with our significant rural broadband expansion that the merger makes possible, we expect content thatâs focused on rural customers will have greater appeal,â Fletcher Cook, an AT&T spokesman, said in a statement.  The brouhaha over rural programming has attracted the attention of both Republican and Democratic legislators. Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, said in a statement, âWe need to make sure families have access to a diverse range of content, including rural-focused programming thatâs important to millions of people in Minnesota and all across the country.â  At the polka party, Mr. Gottschâs jeremiad had fans concerned that his stations would disappear from the airwaves.  âIf they take him off, we are going to throw the TV out,â said Alfons Speidel, 75, of Goshen, Ind., between dances.  Eileen Tlusty, 73, of Protivin, Iowa, said, âI canât live without it.â She added: âWhat am I going to watch? Dating in the nude?â"

It's not even a good one, it's slow buggy and doesn't auto play any episodes after the one you told it to play. It suffers from disconnect issues where once it loses the signal it has a hard time getting it back without being entirely restarted. Not only that, but you can't turn off just the controller, unless I'm missing a feature somewhere. The battery in the remote lasts a couple hours leaving you having to be tethered in half the time you're playing. In most games the screen on the remote isn't utilized at all making it feel like a waste, so certainly pick up the pro controller if you want to just play on the TV. The games that are good for it are fun, albeit a little sparse. It is a fun system to play on. Also, it's great if you have kids, they wanna play a game, boom here you go tv on the controller in your hands. I'm just trying to let you know about what I consider serious flaws in the systems design. Overall, I'd say if you're into a more casual gaming experience and only play a couple hours at a time it's worth picking up. If you're more serious about gaming and need a good library to play through don't get it yet, wait until they work out more of the bugs."

WarOnComcast,2dz0vl,llzardklng,-1,Tue Aug 19 21:48:05 2014 UTC,You didn't purchase content through your cable company. You purchased a means to access another companies content. The owner of that content makes its money through ad revenue. Whether you get it through an antennae in your back yard or through a CATV pickup and rebroadcast is irrelevant. Comcast or Time Warner or Verizon can either feed their content through the way they want it fed or not at all. Your cable company does not own the content unless they produced it themselves.
WarOnComcast,2dz0vl,Lolor-arros,6,Tue Aug 19 22:16:41 2014 UTC,That doesn't change the fact that cable providers do not have to allow this.
WarOnComcast,2dz0vl,llzardklng,1 point,Tue Aug 19 22:19:28 2014 UTC,"Then the option would be not carrying at all. If someone produces and owns content they have discretion over how it's broadcast. If you had say, bought every episode of CSI on iTunes and they made you watch commercials anyway, that would be total bullshit because they actually sold you content already. In no cable contact ever has it said by subscribing to cable you have ownership of anything broadcast. If the content producers let you watch all their shows commercial free at the same time as broadcast, they would be out of business. They put up the investment, they own the content, they get to set the rules of how it's rebroadcast. You can choose to boycott their sponsors for not letting you watch it commercial free and you would then be making a choice. If you don't want to see commercials just record it and FF them. The CATV companies are never going to just stop carrying their content unless they give it away for free."

The Division President was touting the fact that Comcast would get to a position of ownership/influence of over 80% of the content being aired.  (Maybe he was exaggerating - I cannot say for certain, but I suspect the worst when it comes to their greed.)  Also, just to avoid the flaming of me being jaded about Comcast: I left Comcast on my accord.

The internal battles between the cable division and the content division who see streaming delivery like Netflix as the future must be bloody. Throwing the cable division out of the company will make these decisions easier.

Complaining to Comcast itself is akin to yelling into the toilet.  The only thing Comcast is going to respond to... is a way for us to hit them where it hurts, in the wallet.  If you can't get folks to buckle down and refuse to pay... if people just continue as they have been, and just pay the bill without saying a word, then there's very little hope for the future of the internet.  There needs to be some kind of united alliance against these unscrupulous providers or the net, as we know it is doomed.  How are we going to fight as individuals against Comcast's giant bank account, that's lobbying our politicians ?

Those first discs REALLY WERE nearly indestructable. Nowadays, you can breathe on them and they get scratched.  Back on topic...  I agree... that possibility is likely, or it sure seems so, but it's vapor until it does happen. Comcast could morph into something more powerful, it ""could"" change, and while I think they might be able to keep up with the tech, I don't see them becoming good for the consumer in any viable way.  I'm highly skeptical about Google and Google Fibre. I don't like the idea of privacy being flown out the proverbial window and Google is vehemently anti-privacy. Fibre, just means they can track every digital move I make at much faster speeds.  But yeah... keep up with educating people. The more resistance to Comcast there is, the better off we all are."
WarOnComcast,2dvb35,SCphotog,2,Mon Aug 18 15:40:56 2014 UTC,Agreed. I just feel that this same story has played out over and over.   Company X has a ridiculously profitable product and has cornered the market. Their product slowly becomes dated. They don't want to change/upgrade because   1) it will alienate their current customers (they think) and   2) it will cost tons of money to upgrade.   Profits start to decline and they become very cut-throat in an effort to maintain current profit levels. Company Y comes along with superior product and great PR.

There are really only 3 choices as far as ""some sort of wire hooked into the home"" methods of content delivery go: The monopolies we have now, increased competition by letting anyone who wants to compete tear up the streets and people's yards and bury their own cable, or making the government the owner of the cable and everyone leases direct from the state.  The first option isn't working. The second option is gonna piss you off when company #10 tears up your street and your front lawn, again, to bury their cable, and the third option is gonna have a bunch of morons screaming vague objections to something they think is socialism.   There needs to be a clear goal, and a clear roadmap to getting there, in place before the outrage can hope to lead to a good, permanent solution."

It is a public utility cable. Comcast has deals with local/state/whatever government to exclusively use the cable. If that is the case, tearing up the street is not an issue to provide the same service from a different company who is (hopefully) offering better service. For fiber, yes they would have to.

If that were how our internet charged us based on the amount people need, then fine, but it's not, and it won't, because this is meant to drive people back to cable subscriptions.  The only solution is to oppose them from top to bottom, no leniency for it.  If they want to charge me like a utility then they should be regulated like a utility.  If they aren't regulated like a utility they should not be able to charge me as such."
WarOnComcast,2dvb35,cmon_now,0,Mon Aug 18 14:59:29 2014 UTC,"Right, the low caps and egregious charges for extra data is to force you to seek traditional cable subscriptions for entertainment as opposed to online video or other high bandwidth applications that compete for eyeballs.  I'm not opposed to usage based billing per se, just the way it has been implemented in every case so far.  Charge me a $30 ""infrastructure fee"" and then $0.02 per gigabyte.  That's fair, covers the costs of the company in question while affording them a profit, and allows me to pay a cost that is representative of my usage.  Everybody wins who isn't being a greedy rent seeking monopolist (well I suppose it sucks if you pull a TB of data each month, but otherwise everybody wins)."
WarOnComcast,2dvb35,Asmor,-5,Mon Aug 18 19:56:40 2014 UTC,"This is actually one of the few areas I don't really have a problem with.  Metered bandwidth charges just make sense.

The problem? I returned their modem immediately and was using my own. I asked the guy ""If I've got your modem, then you can tell me which model I'm running. And since you guys only use Arris modems on installations, you're gonna have some trouble explaining to me how you claim to own a Motorola SB6121""  He switched his story suddenly from ""we'll have to investigate to figure out if you actually returned the modem"" to ""Please hold on, I will take care of this for you.""  I've had plenty of friends have the same thing happen. I'm 99.9% sure that Comcast INTENTIONALLY sends these letters out to try to illegally make money from people based on fraudulent claims.    Then, last week I received a letter from them in the mail, letting me know that my DOSCIS 3.0-powered Motorola SB6121 cable modem is likely not receiving the DOCSIS 3.0 speeds needed for Comcast's new and improved ""doubled speeds!"". THey insist that I need to upgrade to a Comcast approved modem with DOCSIS 3.0 (despite the fact that I am running the most compatible modem they've ever listed on their page).

WarOnComcast,2dv7ao,nickmv5,5,Tue Aug 19 20:55:17 2014 UTC,Have you been paying attention?  The entire point is that Comcast both actively and passively fights you.  This sort of confusion was intentional. It's not enough that your bill just magically goes up.. it's that the decision to do so was calculated.
WarOnComcast,2dwepc,thesupergeek42,7,Mon Aug 18 17:08:23 2014 UTC,"I would say there are a few possibilities.  One, you could be in an area where Comcast has competition. This means they're more likely to take your requests and concerns seriously. I don't know of that's a result of overall policy, or just that the mid-level managers run a tighter shift knowing that effort will need to be put in to keep their customers and numbers (which is how capitalism works and is a good thing, imo).  Two, you maybe be in a new customer time frame. Your bill is cheap because you just signed up, and although you're contractually obligated to keep Comcast for two years, the price will change after the first six months or year. Or that's what happened to me. The price jumped up to their ""normal"" rate.  Three, you're lucky. Either to be in an area where the staff gets stuff done generally on time and correctly, or just to have those events line up.  I have them for tv, internet, and phone, and have had service with them for 3 years. Very rarely have my interactions gone smoothly, but most of the time I got what I needed eventually. Still, 3 years in and my bill has gone up 70$ since I first signed up, so I'll be going through the effort to cancel as I can't justify that kind of price for entertainment. I'll likely end up sticking with them for internet, as they are the only high speed provider in my area."
WarOnComcast,2dwepc,DynamiteIsNotTNT,2,Mon Aug 18 18:07:44 2014 UTC,"Competition is key.  Comcast isn't allowed to sell in the building where I live in Seattle, so we have no other option other than CenturyLink and they know it.

Money will not solve corruption, and we cannot hope to match the organization of special interests. At this point, the only logical answer is complete reform of all branches of government."
WarOnComcast,2dmx56,johnfromberkeley,3,Fri Aug 15 19:26:06 2014 UTC,"i wasn't looking at it as a solution, but more as a ""culture jam"". The idea isn't to bribe the FCC chairman. It's to exploit an egregious corporate blunder to raise awareness that could lead to the reform you speak of.  Before the Internet, citizens couldn't even contemplate pooling money to compete with or challenge corporate interests.  Did you think I was suggesting fundraising a bribe?! That would be stupid."
WarOnComcast,2dmx56,spacerace,1 point,Mon Aug 18 21:24:12 2014 UTC,"No, I see what you're saying, I merely want to draw attention the larger issue at hand. We shouldn't have to spend additional money beyond the taxes we already pay in order to shame public officials into doing their job correctly. That's essentially what the best possible outcome this kickstarter suggestion could have.   What about the next time public officials act in the interests of special interests over public good, or the next? Are we going to have to pool money for kickstarters every time a corrupt official accepts legal bribes and puts special interest before those of your average citizen (ignoring that we already do pay them)? My point is, money cannot solve systematic corruption like this."

Burgess Secretary, NYS Public Service Commission Three Empire State Plaza Albany, New York 12223 Dear Commissioner Burgess, I am writing to express my support for the proposed transaction between Com cast and Time Warner Cable (NYS Public Service Commission Case 14-M-0183). The combination of Com cast and Time Warner Cable will create a world-class communications, media and technology company to help meet the increasing consumer demand for advanced digital services on multiple devices in homes, workplaces and on-the-go. Comcast has a proven record of investing in new technologies, facilities and customer support to provide the best in broadband Internet access, video and digital voice services. Similarly, Time Warner has made significant strides in offering a diverse array of video, broadband and voice services to its customers. Combining the two companies' complementary strengths will accelerate the deployment of next-generation broadband Internet, video and voice services across the new company's footprint. Residential customers will benefit from technological innovations including a superior video experience, higher broadband speeds and the fastest in-home Wi-Fi, while also generating significant cost savings and other efficiencies. An example of a product offering that would be enhanced by this merger is Comcast's Internet Essentials program, the nation's largest and most comprehensive broadband access initiative, which provides broadband Internet access to the homes of low-income families. In just two-and-a-half years, over 350,000 families, representing approximately 1.4 million low-income consumers, have been connected to the Internet thanks to this program. This proposed merger would extend this vital program to many more low-income households in New York by providing access to it in certain areas of the state currently only served by Time Warner. Overall, I expect this merger to result in increased consumer benefits and continued focus on investment in broadband, particularly in Upstate New York. For these reasons, and many others, I respectfully request your support of this proposed transaction and thank you in advance for your attention to this matter. Warmest personal regards, JOSEPH D. MORELLE Majority Leader New York State Assembly ALBANY OFFICE: 926 Legislative Office Building, Albany, New York 12248' 518Â·455-5373, FAX 518-455-5647 DISTRICT OFFICE: 1945 East Ridge Road.

It's a good way to force them to give you more than 15 bucks off, along with a service you don't want. I got them to cut my service by 30, just by mentioning U-Verse was just out to talk with me after they finished setting up the neighborhood.  Either way, I get my AT&T U-Verse service this afternoon, so I can stop dealing with Comcast. Had 3 weeks of outages, decided it was easier to switch than deal with Comcast any more."

Just wait until that free service starts costing you $60/month. You better be sure that's not some limited time promotional pricing.   Honestly, I don't know anywhere that you can get basic cable for $15/month. That's like going back to the early 90's in pricing. If I could get that pricing, I'd jump on it for basic.   So, um, I'm going to call bullshit on this story. Even if it isn't, the idea, and it's a common theme with Comcast, that you're not getting advertised service but they'll give you additional/other service for a limited time promotional price is insulting.

How anyone can conclude that Comcast is to big to function demonstrates a lack of intellectual acumen. Comcast has a huge technological infrastructure where it systematically deploys and manages, quite uniformly, technologies that actively break inherent  functionality of networking in order to sell it back to you. They capture & classify traffic of their customers nationally providing this information to LEO's on requests thousands of times a year. It's complex, and requires they know exactly what it is they're doing and how to do it.   So, when customers across the nation are repeatedly treated like shit, mis-billed for modems they own, don't receive service they were promised, have to wait days and months to get a repair, this is not a broken company. This is a company that absolutely does not care about you, the customer and in fact profits by not providing you service that you continue to pay for or allowing you to languish in que hell as you're shuffled around and harassed when you attempt to cancel their service. It is by design in the same fashion that medieval torture devices are designed to extract the most gruesome types of pain and suffering from their victims. Except instead of pain and suffering Comcast is extracting money and they care not if they cause pain and suffering in the process."

They have to set up to schedule a technician to come out and disconnect you, making your account still active, though they probably have the stop bill date for the 7th. It just won't go into affect until your actually, physically disconnected. I would have asked them when the disconnection had beem scheduled, then waited a few days after that to call and check on your bill. This is just an assumption though."
WarOnComcast,2dcset,havelotsofsax,1 point,Wed Aug 13 13:25:41 2014 UTC,"I think it is fairly strange that they can continue charging until they choose to send out a technician. I would think that if I tell someone I no longer need their service, but they keep providing it anyway, they shouldn't be able to charge me for the service I requested they cancel.  This is assuming there is the appropriate notice given, such as 14 days or 30 days or whatever is in the initial agreement, but that seems to be addressed by the August 7th deadline."

This was free because it was their equipment. I can't even imagine how much Comcast would have charged us for it.

I HAVE to suggest replacing that as the first course of action even though equipment typically accounts for less than one percent of no sync scenarios.

The customer called into customer service and the rep who took the call basically stole the customer from him. She was having an issue and called in. The rep on the phone changed her account, charged her for a install, that was a self install, signed her up for something I forgot. He found out when she called him about something. He called into do whatever he does and he couldnt do anything with the account because his ID number was not on it anymore. That seems to be a big problem. When its all sell sell sell, employees end up stealing each others customers and screwing them over so they can get that commission. He's new and wasnt sure what to do.

It's because it's illegal to deny another ISP access to customers.  The FCC made exclusivity deals illegal(PDF) in 2007. It survived the appeals attempt in 2008.  Whoever you're talking to are incorrect or outright lying. Talk to the Attorney General, and print out the PDF above if necessary."
WarOnComcast,2cjdy7,Craysh,9,Mon Aug 4 01:27:26 2014 UTC,"Here is the FCC's response. From the looks of it the law can only protect a landlord from being contractually forced into one provider, but if the landlord is happy with a given provider they don't have to allow another provider in or extend other options to residents.   You are receiving this email in response to your inquiry to the FCC.  Dear Consumer,  The FCC adopted a Report and Order (FCC 07-189) on October 31, 2007 banning the use of exclusivity clauses for the provision of video services to multiple dwelling units (""MDUs"") or other real estate developments.  The Order finds that nearly 30% of Americans live in MDUs and these numbers are growing.  With this proceeding, the Commission is taking another step to foster greater competition in the market for the delivery of multi-channel video programming.  These rules will increase choice and competition for consumers residing in MDUs and other real estate developments. In this Order, the Commission prohibits the enforcement or execution of existing exclusivity clauses and the execution of new ones by MVPDs. Specifically the Order finds that:  -exclusivity clauses that bar competitive entry harm competition and broadband deployment and can insulate the incumbent MVPD from any need to improve its service.  -exclusivity clauses are widespread in agreements between MVPDs and MDU owners.  -incumbent cable operators have increased the use of exclusivity clauses in their agreements with MDU owners with the entry of LECs into the video marketplace.  -the use of exclusivity clauses in contracts for the provision of video services to MDUs constitutes an unfair method of competition or an unfair act or practice under Section 628(b).  This ruling became law on March 7, 2008.  In that Report & Order FCC, the Commission adopted, a Further Notice of the Proposed Rulemaking that sought comment on whether we should take action to address exclusivity clauses entered into by DBS providers, private cable operators, and other MVPDs who are not subject to Section 628. The Further Notice also sought comment on whether the Commission should prohibit exclusive marketing and bulk billing arrangements. The Second Report and Order, FCC 10-35 adopted March 2010, resolved the question of prohibiting exclusive marketing and bulk billing arrangements only, allowing both to continue.  Website:  http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DOC-277763A1.pdf  October 2007 News Release  http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DA-08-1107A1.pdf  Compliance Guide  http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/FCC-10-35A1.pdf  Second Report & Order  Rules: Docket MB No. 07-51, FCC 07-189 and FCC 10-35  (1) Building exclusives are forbidden as previously discussed.  - But if an MDU (landlord, condo board, etc.) is happy with only one video provider, nothing in our decision requires that the MDU let in a second or third video provider.  (2) Residents of such an MDU who want a second video provider have no rights under our decision; it is suggested that they talk with their fellow tenants/owners and lobby the landlord/condo board to let in #2. An MDU could file a complaint that (a) they had a contract with a cable operator and it contained an exclusivity clause, the very kind of clause we declared unlawful; or (b) the MDU wanted to let in a second video provider (Verizon, typically); and/or (c) the cable operator was threatening to go to court to keep Verizon out or to cut service to the MDU if the latter lets Verizon in.  This is not very likely, because as far as I know there has been total compliance with our decision by cable operators. To file a complaint use FCC Form 2000F by any reasonable means, including electronically on the Internet at www.fcc.gov/complaints; or by postal mail to: Federal Communications Commission 445 12th Street, SW Washington, DC 20554. A complaint may also be submitted in an alternate format audio-cassette recording or Braille.  The complaint should include the following:  ""       the name of the company that is the subject of your complaint and the name of any company representative you spoke with; ""       a description of your complaint and the resolution you are seeking, including the dates, times and nature of any conduct or activity complained of and identifying information of any companies, institutions or individuals involved; ""        the account number that is the subject of your complaint; ""       Any other information you feel is helpful to your complaint.

I emailed all of the district 7 candidates and the only other response I received was from Doug McQuaid (Independent). He also responded to my response. See his response below.   Dear slightlycreativename,      Thank you for interest in considering me as a candidate for U. S. Representative for District 7 in the upcoming primary election.  I very much appreciate your interest in these very relevant and important issues regarding free and unrestricted access of all citizens or residents of this country to the internet which has become such so important given the digital age we have entered and its paramount relevance to the everyday life of all people today.     To quickly answer your questions without taking the time to research the issues in more detail, I will give you my answers off the top of my head:    Net Neutrality:  I strongly and positively believe in absolute net neutrality for all persons, regardless of their position or status, as a matter of a basic civil right and fair due process. There is no place or right under our Constitutional principals of freedom and equality for any such thing as a ""slow lane"" and a ""fast lane"" for unrestricted free and equal access to the internet and no person, entity or corporation should be given any greater right to than anybody else, regardless of their status or ability to pay.  Yes, ""large incumbent ISP's"" and other money privileged entities have too much power to arbitrarily provide internet speeds and service at their whim, solely for their financial gain, while the consumer is being discriminated against by the ISP's simply because they are the small suckers who can be taken advantage of by charging more money for access to the ""fast lane.""  That amounts to total dominance and discrimination by the ISP's for the sake of every increasing profit and corruption.  The unfortunate common consumers are being misrepresented and essentially lied to by the big service providers by their misrepresentative advertising and sales propaganda [""unlimited data'] which fails to mention or inform the consumer of streaming or download speeds of that data.  In the meantime they cleverly and unilaterally limit the data or download speeds for carefully selected internet material at the expense of the consumer and devise clever plans to get some, but not all, material or streaming at faster speeds for the payment of more money by the consumer because of their monopoly and what actually amounts to corruption. Then they cleverly limit streaming or downloads to certain web providers [Netflix, Hulu, etc.] to extort more money from those providers.  Legislation needs to be enacted to prohibit these unfair and deceptive practices and grant unrestricted access and internet speeds to all consumers at the same fair price in the interest of equality and due process. Municipal or Private Gigabit Broadband Internet Services:  Absolutely, and by imperative evidence, local municipalities CAN NOT be trusted to build out their own fiber networks!  This has been proven beyond doubt in Seattle where the gigabit broadband services promised to us years ago has never been completed due to numerous scandals, unnecessary delays, and the more recent influence of Comcast which by political influence sabotaged the project by serendipitously putting money in the pockets of our political ""leaders.""  First, McGinn and now Murray, and the City Council.  So, our municipality has been corrupted by the political power, influence and money of a private corporation for its own financial gain.  So, how can anybody trust a municipality or any other government entity to provide a much needed service when it is influenced and corrupted by a private company to further the political agenda of the politicians who control the municipality or government body?  Based on this frustrating experience I do think it would be wise to remove the politics from such an important project and contract with a private company to build the the promised upgraded, modern and fast fiber optic system for Seattle or any other local municipality or government body.  So, certainly I would push for the legislation you suggest with built-in guarantees of completion dates, reliability and fair rates for each and every person or entity.  I hope this answers your questions based on my honest personal beliefs and opinions.  If you would like further clarification do not hesitate to ask me. Respectfully, Doug McQuaid Candidate for U.S. Representative, District 7"
WarOnComcast,2ch5zx,renational,1 point,Sun Aug 3 05:37:08 2014 UTC,"I got this back from my Queens NY district congress women;  Thank you for contacting me with your views on net neutrality.       Currently, when you use the internet, companies like Time Warner and Verizon are not allowed to slow down or block your service. These companies are known as Internet Service Providers (ISPs). Net neutrality is the principle that ISPs should not be able to control your internet. I fully support net neutrality and will continue to fight for it.       To make the unofficial principle of net neutrality into law, the Federal Communication Commission (FCC) issued the Open Internet Order in 2010. This set of regulations required ISPs to be transparent in agreements with customers and prevented ISPs from blocking or slowing down a customer's internet.       On January 14, 2014, a federal appeals court struck down large parts of the Open Internet Order. After this ruling, FCC proposed a new regulation that would allow ISPs to slow down the websites of content providers like Netflix or HBO if they do not pay an additional fee to the ISPs.        This new regulation would be disastrous for both content providers and for internet users. Small businesses or regular individuals seeking to start a website would not be able to afford the fee charged for normal internet service. Moreover, the costs of the fee would almost certainly be passed down to consumers â meaning that you would pay more for access to the websites you use today.       The FCC has opened this proposed rule to comments by the public and will make a final regulation proposal based, in part, on these comments. Comments about the rule can be submitted until Wednesday, September 10th, 2014. Comments can be emailed to openinternet@fcc.gov or submitted online at: http://apps.fcc.gov/ecfs/upload/display?z=x9mgh.       I will continue to oversee this effort to ensure an open internet. Should the rulemaking process prove insufficient, we in Congress will consider legislative recourse.       I appreciate you taking the time to share your views with me, and I hope you will continue to do in the future. Sincerely,  Grace Meng  Member of Congress"

Then the second your off the phone you get pulled into the office and get yelled at by your boss because you didn't retain control of the call and ask the right questions to retain the customers.  Worst of all is sadly you cant take pitty on the phone reps if you dont get stern with them we will get control and keep you its the worst. You dont have to be a dick and call me names but dont let me control the call either.

The semi-fast way of doing it (may require some teeth pulling) is immediately tell them you're recording the conversation, that you wish to disconnect (list of services) due to reason X which cannot be remedied, and you do not want to hear counter-offers or retention deals. If they do a song and dance ask them if they understood what you just said.  Affirm they understand.  If they get off topic interrupt and ask them again - multiple times till they say yes.  After they say yes tell them they acknowledged the end of financial obligations, and that you will be hanging up and would like your confirmation number before doing so.  If they give the number:  Good, you're done with them.  Return any rented equipment you may have.  If not:  If they continue to fight tell them you will take the recording to their twitter, FB, corporate emails, share holders, and major tech news sites such Ars and Consumerist.

The lawyer thing I understand to an extent - CSRs aren't qualified as to the legality of an agreement.  So what you're saying is the customer merely needs to express their desire to end service, get you guys to say you understand, then tell you they're recording to end the conversation.  Cool - at that point you have their intentions to end services and not following through can get you guys sued.  I'm guessing you guys also have a machine that says the call may be recorded which is considered consent.

Capitalism as we know it depends on private ownership of the means of production and cannot exist without it.  And if you introduce a private army/police force to protect your property, you are just filling in the vacuum with another state-like entity.  This is what classical anarchism tries to do in a nutshell...abolish private ownership of common modes of production and people democratically and horizontally managing state and former capitalist resources and industries, rather than a hierarchy such as the present model.  These are the people who fought for our 8 hour work day and child labor laws in the late 1800's to early 1900's.  The IWW (Industrial Workers of the World) was very influential among leftist groups such as this.  Edit: Libertarians (the American political party at least, that word means something different to the rest of the world) mostly actually advocate for a minarchy, a state much reduced in scope to only enforce contracts and private property laws.  This is why this party is so well funded and promoted by business interests, as it pushes for a political situation which has the perfect conditions for a full blown capitalist takeover of the country."

Also as a rep its your job to throw credits at these customers when they call in upset about it.  This is pretty standard for all phone and cable companies."

I called them up, told them I wish to cancel, they did ask if there was an issue and I told them that and he simply said sorry to hear that and asked if he could help with anything else. If t-mobile can pick up there coverage in this area I would go back.  Pretty much every company tried to upsell everywhere.  When I start getting the line for it I just very directly tell them I am interested in nothing else than what I asked for and rarely have issues, I don't listen to their sales pitch that I am not interested in, and they can move on to the next call quicker, less time wasted on both sides."

WarOnComcast,2bmwcg,Appable,1 point,Fri Jul 25 05:01:22 2014 UTC,"It really depends on your exact locale and what the community at large is using along with a lot of other factors. I have Centurylink right now paying for ""up to 40mbps"", and I see anywhere between 15 and 38 in any given day with a MB/s speed that varies to reflect that. However CL is the ONLY provider in this complex offering anything higher than 1.5 so at peak hours there's a huge amount of strain on our node. It also depends on what type of connection you have. If it's fiber (which it likely is if their offering 40 down) then is it fiber to the house/building, or fiber to the node with copper going from the node to the building? There are other significant factors as well. Basically I encourage you to experiment with the providers in your area and ultimately choose what works best for you. Keep in mind though, that, while most have abolished them at this point, there are still providers that will try to lock you into a contract.  Tl;dr: Internet service varies widely between locations, even from the same provider, for lots of reasons and I encourage you to try out different ISPs until you find the one that best fits your usage and requirements. Just be careful of contract providers as some ISPs still use contracts to lock you in.  Edit: for clarification, I'm in Mesa, AZ"

I first chuckled at their Orwellian doublespeak that they have ""increased"" people's data caps. Guess that ranks up there with ""making it easy for people to choose to stay with comcast.""

I guess they figure that if you're unlucky enough to live in one of these ""test"" areas, and dumb enough to actually take them up on this joke of an offer, they might as well just tell you to bite the pillow, 'cause they're going in dry. 5GB. What a joke. It's 2014; you could go through 5GB in a couple of minutes. Are they really just trying to find out if there's anyone out there that's willing to pay so much for a service that's literally unusable? Why not just have a ""Rock Bottom"" offer: ""For $49.99/month, we'll give you absolutely nothing."" This ridiculous offer isn't that far from it; I guess they're just seeing if people are willing to pay for nothing.  And what the hell kind of ""test program"" is this anyway? New programs typically have at least some benefits to the consumer. Where is the benefit in imposing data caps where there previously were none? Where is the benefit of a <10% drop in your cable bill if you drop your usage by 98% and put yourself at risk of being financially raped if you dare to go over it?  ""Thank you, Comcast! I always wanted to have a data plan that was just as restrictive as my cell phone, but more expensive and with even higher overage fees!"" -- said no customer, ever.

With many netflix users, plus Steam downloads and Spotify, it's really easy to go over the 300. While I'm not incredibly happy about what I am going to do, I've decided to switch. I have already started talking to the only other internet provider in our area, Fairpoint (DSL), to get rates and plans. It'll be 10 dollars cheaper, but half the speed. I'm not sure how reliable it's going to be--I have not heard a lot of good things about Fairpoint.  On the plus side, at least I will be free from the data cap and can actually use my internet without fear from now on. And maybe one less subscriber leaving Comcast with the reason bandwidth caps and net neutrality might cause them to rethink their policies. (I doubt it)."

WarOnComcast,2bmwcg,-Intrinsic-,1 point,Fri Jul 25 14:36:39 2014 UTC,"Southern NH Fairpoint user here, have a couple good things to say about them.  I first got DSL in mid 2006 - right when Verizon began offering it, unfortunately only at 1.6Mbps (all they said they could offer to my house). 1.6 wasn't great, but was better than dial-up, and I had cut the Comcast cord in 2004 or 2005 (hate them).  Had no issues with the Verizon to Fairpoint transfer.   In 2010 or 2011 for several weeks I had an issue where my internet would intermittently cut out when it rained. I called they sent out a tech, and he determined the line was corroded, so he replaced all 1.5 miles of it back to the switching station. Problem was fixed, with just the single call.  Last week I went to pay my bill online (as I have done for a few years now), and they changed/redid the website, so I had to call to get my account # (I typically trash my bill w/o opening it). Still at 1.6Mbps, which was ok for some lite gaming or youtube @480, but now with Netflix/streaming/better gaming it's passable, but not so great.   Talking to the Fairpoint operator I asked what was available for an upgrade. She told me: 1.6 for 33.99 (what I had/paid); 3.0 for 36.99; or 7 for 53.99. I didn't really want to pay 53.99/mo so I asked her to switch me to the 3.0, she says sure...and a few seconds later comes back with ""oh we have a special going on...7Mbs for 30.99"". Needless to say I was thrilled, $3 drop in price, plus 4x the speed. 1 year contract, 30.99/mo  price is good for 2 years. Didn't have to change my modem (still using my original one).   Chatting with the tech on the phone, she told me that Fairpoint guarantees 80% of their advertised speeds, and no data caps at all. I am a moderate(?) torrent user typically in the 100-150GB/mo usage, with heavy Netflix/gaming/other; I am sure I use 300GB+/mo. Not sure how that falls with others' usage.  3 houses down is in a different town, they have fiber (since Verizon days). Do I wish I had it? Of course, but ultimately I am not unhappy. I realize 7Mbps isn't great compared to other areas (Hell I get 20Mbps on cell), but I will live with it. I've done a speed test most every day since I got the upgrade, it's always been between 6.9 -7.22Mbps.   Other than the one time they needed to replace the lines, the internet only goes down when the power goes out. The couple of times I needed to call customer service, they were polite and knowledgeable.  I realize many people have not so nice things to say about them, but for me I have been happy with my service since they came to New England.  Edit: spelling"

WarOnComcast,2bmwcg,AndroidAaron,2,Sun Jul 27 10:49:08 2014 UTC,I got 5GB of data on just my phone last month. I can't imagine only having 5 in my house. Fuck. That.
WarOnComcast,2bmwcg,Error400BadRequest,15,Fri Jul 25 16:16:40 2014 UTC,"So,  let's propose a new plan.  I pay no monthly service charge and buy all of my data at $10/50GB(or even better,  $10/100GB) and let me use it as fast as my modem allows. It supports up to 300mbps connections,  which would be quite the upgrade.   Who's with me?"
WarOnComcast,2bmwcg,FluffyBinLaden,5,Thu Jul 24 23:38:18 2014 UTC,"I actually don't agree with this.  I think the current system works wonderfully.  Or, it would if we weren't at the feet of a natural monopoly.  I'd rather be paying for a stream of internet (reasonable streams of course, not this fucking $100/month for 15 down) than a metered service.  Regulation is a must, as well as finding a way to kill monopolies, but I don't know if actually classifying internet as a metered utility is the best route.  Think of the effect Google Fiber has on cities, and think about that happening everywhere.  I, personally, feel that's the preferable solution."
WarOnComcast,2bmwcg,Jasonbluefire,1 point,Fri Jul 25 07:52:34 2014 UTC,"A metered plan would see enormous drops for average users if ISPs charged reasonable rates on a per GB basis.  Some of the heaviest few % would see their bills go up a small amount, but the vast majority would either stay the same or drop.  Last I've read, it costs ISPs .07/GB to deliver data to the consumer.  I've heard the cost is actually a bit lower than that, but we'll go with .07 for the sake of discussion.  I consider myself an above average user, and go through about 500 GB a month.  If I were to purchase my internet seperately, it would cost me $129 a month at my current speed.  It costs me about $80 as part of my bundle.  (grrr.....)  At .07/GB their price, I'd say a reasonable price to charge would be .15.  A bit more than double.  500 GB * .15 = $75.    I'd be saving money.  Many people use far less than that -- think Grandma who checks facebook, the weather, and reads the news off of whatever default home page her browser has set.  Her bills would hit the floor.    And that's why ISPs don't do it.  Most people would be saving boatloads of cash.     Of course, this is all based on the pipe dream of ISPs charging reasonable prices on a metered basis, which you and I know has absolutely no chance of ever happening.  Under their current ""Let's see how far up their ass we can ram this giant horse cock"" method of pricing, I agree that the current system is probably as good as we can expect to get."

If I am understanding this right if you were to enroll in flexible-data option you will pay 5$ less from your bill but a 1$ per GB if you go over and you lose that 5$, so if you hit 300GB you would pay 300$ more then if you did not enroll...

WarOnComcast,2bmwcg,ApplicableSongLyric,7,Fri Jul 25 05:58:06 2014 UTC,I don't have Comcast but I do have Suddenlink. I have 50/5 in my area and they give you 350gb a month and 10$ per 50gb after that. I was going over every month for about 6 months and after calling over and over a customer service rep told me if I get two lines of service I can avoid the cap because they are unable to count usage with 2 modems on one line. So I have 1 connection at 50/5 and another at 5/1 and that runs me about 100$ a month but its still cheaper than the overages I was paying every month.
WarOnComcast,2bmwcg,sn76477,2,Fri Jul 25 00:29:21 2014 UTC,Lmao that's great that they can't track that.  That is awesome that you got a good rep to let you know about that.  Maybe they got a + into their quota for technically selling you a new line.

I am not saying these wouldn't be good but companies like Comcast, Time Warner, Verizon, AT&T, etc, have set up their networks to alleviate this issue. By that I mean, they have agreements with each other to not go into each others territory. No competition means you can set whatever price you want and do whatever you want.

We have to show them that we are willing to go without or else where to get the internet if they choose to treat it inappropriately   If we could do it before household internet we can do it again without (although it wont be as easy).

We want the entire bullshit political shitstorm war you are waging to control the free flow of information stopped. The internet is too important and too powerful a tool to let rest in the hands of a single gatekeeper.   This is about control, and the power to let one of the greatest innovations of mankind be left alone to flourish. You're trying to pigeonhole the internet into a content control machine with the same dinosaur price structure of fucking television. We are the ones who create content here, we are the foundation of the internet, and you want to offer us fucking crumbs like this? The internet should be treated as a utility, and we will not settle for anything less. This is far too important, we know what is really at stake, so this bullshit is particularly offensive.

WarOnComcast,2b80xy,TeaPartyDem,3,Mon Jul 21 03:04:29 2014 UTC,"Comcast reps gain experience daily on how to deal with every ""threatening to cancel"". The company will pour tons of money into advertisements boasting their ""superior customer service"" until they're blue in the face. Why? Because they have the resources and bank on where there is a group of annoyed customers, there are how many more pleased ones.  Unless a completely new company were able to surface and turn Comcast on its head, otherwise Comcast is here to stay.    Until then, the runaround my brother and sister-in-law experienced proves that even the most calm, workable customer will not end up getting his/her way.  Hopefully this proves useful to the subreddit:  Where the trouble began was transferring brother and sister-in-law's triple play (with premium channels) after they moved.  They had a decent deal going for around $130+change per month.  Two months later, the bill increased to the $200 range, and by the next it was pushing $300.  They were not in a promotion; the $130 was supposed to be locked in for the year.    After hearing about the Retention Department, my brother and sister-in-law gave it a go. They explained that once a representative answers, tell him/her to connect you to the RD.  Apparently these reps can attempt to talk you into staying with Comcast with the promise of discounted packages. My sister threatened to cancel and successfully resolved the issue in this phone call, yet when she expected the change to be reflected on the next bill, she was met with $400.    Naturally, she calls back and speaks to another retention rep...whom lowered her bill to $330 and told her the original $130 rate was a no-can-do.    Rightfully so my sister had enough and demanded to cancel.  Many representatives, wasted time, and supervisors later, she is told she needs to pay a $200 early termination fee.  She was so aggravated she basically said ""fuck it"", paid the $200, and immediately called Verizon.  Not a single problem."

""triple play"", double play""... just a bunch of sensational ad-words.. As if we're all kids hankering for the toy in the bottom of a cereal box. These ""plans"" are purposefully obtuse and confusing.  How about just use a plain explanation of what it is that we're paying for instead, with a clear and concise chart/list of the bandwidth we can expect, without the happy meal deal, that's not a deal at all.  The pricing and package scenarios that we see from Comcast... the weekly flyer in the mail (the rainforest is coming in the mail), the TV ad, the radio ad, what I see on the comcast website and what the rep' is telling me on the phone.... none of them match and none of the people you deal with on the phone, in the local comcast office or anywhere else knows anything about the OTHER promotion... and ""sorry I can't help you with that"".  A burger alone costs near as much as a burger with a drink and fries, even tho' I don't want a drink and fries. This is an advertising and sales deceit. It 'tricks' the consumer into purchasing something they didn't really want. The same can be said of the ""packages"" that Comcast offers.  ""Preferred channels"" is a joke. These are the channels that Comcast prefers to let us have. Mostly a bunch of crapola that almost no one wants to watch... it's a bunch of filler. You get 500 channels, but 450 of them are televangelists, shopping networks and infomercials, the occasional rerun of some reality show made in the 90's, so on and so forth. Even the ""good"" channels are reruns and bumpers. HBO runs bumpers advertising themselves just as much or more than they play movies... as if the consumer wasn't already watching HBO.   WTF..........over ?  You have to ""buy"" the package that includes all of these channels that you don't really want... just to be able to get a few that you do.   Comcast's service... ie. dealing with phone support or an onsite tech isn't even a joke. It's a sad and demeaning experience for both parties. The onsite techs are so bad... ""Here let me put this CD in your computer"", ""It won't work unless I install this"". There's never been a more effective virus delivery method. Thanks for the Trojan Comcast... glad you can now keep even better track of everything I do on the net.  Comcast is also, right now,turning everyone's router into a wi-fi hotspot. What a load of crap that is.... but I can 'opt-out' if I want. How about don't be an asshat in the first place. That would be better.  $55 is an exhorbitant fee for what's delivered by an unscrupulous company, led by a deceitful greedy group of men, who are lining the pockets of the heads at the FCC and lobbying (handing out cash in exchange for preferrential treatment) the Gov' in DC with untold, unreal amounts of money, parties, expense paid vacations... etc... so on and so forth.  It's one of the most corrupt institutions in the country. There's nothing good or admirable about Comcast in any way... unless you just like rooting for the bad guy."

WarOnComcast,2asxsq,allsmiles_,1 point,Wed Jul 16 06:08:41 2014 UTC,"The problem is that Comcast executives are acting in Comcast's best interests (at least with regard to the merger, net neutrality you might be able to argue a little bit but it is still pretty clear that the company would benefit from a weakening of regulation). I just don't see what I could possibly say to them, it is the FCC which is acting out of accord with their purpose."

WarOnComcast,2aq048,omarfw,67,Tue Jul 15 03:35:55 2014 UTC,He does. It's called losing his job. Comcast monitors every call their employees take that leads to an actual cancellation and it counts as a mark against them.  source: knew a coworker who had worked at comcast.

They have a certain quota they have to fill per month and if they don't meet it, they get fired. Even people who have been there for 5 or 10 years. With all this non-sense going on, I am sure there are lots of people losing their jobs.  Ironically, that can explain why I kept getting calls and emails recently from Comcast trying to get me to work there, since I recently put my resume out online. I laughed. Obviously I'm not on enough lists yet for them to know how much I hate their company. Yet."

Since each customer's experience varies greatly, because Comcast settles and lets some customers pay less. Other accounts, they stay firm on and make sure they keep getting charged sky-high. They had my mother paying 220/mo for standard digital cable, 16mb/s, and phone service. (Not even 3 months ago) They refused to budge, even though I told them the features were outdated and overpriced. I called so many times to get it lowered. All they would do is offer free HBO for so many months. Fuck those clowns. I moved her house over to VZ.  I switched her to VZ and she pays 89.99 for 30/5 package as an intro rate right now, and it will go up to 130 in a couple months.  Still better than 220.00/month.   Two months later, Comcast calls us telling us we never returned our equipment. They call her all the time about it and I'm starting to wonder if it's another shady way they increase their revenue, by lying about equipment returns."

Want to watch Netflix?  It's coming across a 60gbit link via OpenConnect direct from Netflix to CondoInternet. (https://www.netflix.com/openconnect)  For $20 more a month, the speed raises to 1000/1000.  Oh, and caps?  Yeah, they don't have them.  They don't even monitor individual port use, just the interconnects to know when it's time to upgrade.  I had probably 5TB of traffic over my connection in the first month.  Most of it an initial cloud backup run with 4.something TB uploaded.  When I needed to move out of a crappy initial Seattle apartment, I made sure to move into a place with this service.

In time, they should be able to hit a lot more buildings, they have a solid fibre run now out of the downtown core and into Ballard and Fremont.  When you are looking for apartments, make sure to ask if they have it, and indicate it's a preference to have.  They are very much a demand driven company, but the demand and acceptance has to come from the building.  http://www.condointernet.net/our-buildings/new-building-request/ is their form to have a building manager fill out.  Thankfully with the tech population here, this can be a factor more and more buildings consider.  Condo also has a few competitors also pushing into more buildings too.  Hopefully we see a big boost from the Mayor too, since he's been holding a lot of public comment sessions about Comcast and their franchise agreement.  I'm sure the tech crowds here are not happy to see Google Fibre show up in Portland before Seattle."
WarOnComcast,2aq048,PanzerFauzt,1 point,Tue Jul 15 16:37:46 2014 UTC,Portland is more flexible and willing to accommodate google fiber.

I thought they were supposed to offer last-minute begging type discounts to save the deal?   edit: thinking about it more, I guess it's possible that the rep would've made some kind of offer if the customer answered why he was disconnecting. Like if the customer said he was disconnecting because his bill was too expensive then they probably would've gave a discount."

I can proxy  through any server, at any time,  and I can hack you in over 700 ways, and  that's just in command prompt. Not only am I extensively trained in non-script assisted hacking, but I have access to  the entire bandwidth of a Google fiber connection,  and will use it to DOS your server of the face of the internet,  you little shit. if only  you could of foreseen the unholy retribution your little 'caring' customer service was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have disconnected my fucking service. but  you couldn't, you didn't, and now your servers are paying the price, you little  shit.

Dear FCC;  Regarding recent proposed rules that implicitly endorse ""internet fast lanes"", allowing Internet providers to offer an option for web companies to pay to connect to users at faster speeds, I would like to make the following comments:  You swines. You vulgar little maggots. You worthless bags of filth. As we say in Texas, you couldn't pour water out of a boot with instructions printed on the heel. You are a canker, an open wound. I would rather kiss a lawyer than be seen with you. You took your last vacation in the Islets of Langerhans.  You're a putrescent mass, a walking vomit. You are spineless little worms deserving nothing but the profoundest contempt. You are jerks, cads, and weasels. I take that back; you are a festering pustule on a weasel's rump. Your life is a monument to stupidity. You are a stench, a revulsion, a big suck on a sour lemon.  I will never get over the embarrassment of belonging to the same species as you. You are monsters, ogres, a malformity. I barf at the very thought of you. You have all the appeal of a paper cut. Lepers avoid you. You are vile, worthless, less than nothing. You are a weed, a fungus, the dregs of this earth. You are a Technicolor yawn. And did I mention that you smell?  You are squeaking rats, a mistake of nature and heavy-metal bagpipe players. You were not born. You were hatched into an unwilling world that rejects the likes of you. You didn't crawl out of a normal egg, either, but rather a mutant maggot egg rejected by an evil scientist as being below his low standards. Your alleged parents abandoned you at birth and then died of shame in recognition of what they had done to an unsuspecting world. They were a bit late. If cluelessness were crude oil, your scalp would be crawling with caribou.  You are thick-headed trogs. I have seen skeet with more sense than you have. You are a few bricks short of a full load, a few cards short of a full deck, a few bytes short of a full core dump, and a few chromosomes short of a full human. Worse than that, you top-post. God created houseflies, cockroaches, maggots, mosquitos, fleas, ticks, slugs, leeches, and intestinal parasites, then he lowered his standards and made you. I take it back; God didn't make you. You are Satan's spawn. You are Evil beyond comprehension, half-living in the slough of despair. You are the entropy which will claim us all. You are a green-nostriled, crossed eyed, hairy-livered, goisher kopf, inbred trout-defiler. You make Ebola look good.  You are weary, stale, flat and unprofitable. You are grimy, squalid, nasty and profane. You are foul and disgusting. You're fools, ignoramuses. Monkeys look down on you. Even sheep won't have sex with you. You are unreservedly pathetic, starved for attention, and lost in a land that reality forgot. You are not ANSI compliant and your markup doesn't validate. You have a couple of address lines shorted together. You should be promoted to Engineering Manager.  Your life is one big W.O.M.B.A.T., and your future doesn't look promising either. We need to trace your bloodline and terminate all siblings and cousins in order to cleanse humanity of your polluted genes. The good news is that no normal human would ever mate with you, so we won't have to go into the sewers in search of your git.  You are a waste of flesh. You have no rhythm. You are ridiculous and obnoxious. You are the moral equivalent of a leech. You are a living emptiness, a meaningless void.  You are sour and senile. You are a loathsome disease, a drooling inbred cross-eyed toesucker. You make Quakers shout and strike Pentecostals silent. You have a version 1.0 mind in a version 6.13 world. Your mother had to tie a pork chop around your neck just to get your dog to play with you. You think that http://www.GuyMacon.com/flame.html is the name of a rock band. You believe that P.D.Q. Bach is the greatest composer who ever lived. You prefer L. Ron Hubbard to Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle. Hee-Haw is too deep for you. You would watch test patterns all day if the other inmates would let you.  On a good day you're half-wits. You remind me of drool. You are deficient in all that lends character. You have the personality of wallpaper. You are dank and filthy. You are asinine and benighted. Spammers look down on you. Phone sex operators hang up on you. Telemarketers refuse to be seen in public with you. You are the source of all unpleasantness. You spread misery and sorrow wherever you go. May you choke on your own foolish opinions. You are a Pusillanimous galactophage and you wear your sister's training bra. Don't bother opening the door when you leave - you should be able to slime your way out underneath. I hope that when you get home your mother runs out from under the porch and bites you.  You smarmy lagerlout gits. You bloody woofter sods. Bugger off, pillocks. You grotty wanking oik artless base-court apple-johns. You clouted boggish foot-licking half-twits. You dankish clack-dish plonkers. You gormless crook-pated tossers. You bloody churlish boil-brained clotpole ponces. You craven dewberry pisshead cockup pratting naffs. You cockered bum-bailey poofters. You gob-kissing gleeking flap-mouthed coxcombs. You dread-bolted fobbing beef-witted clapper-clawed flirt-gills. You jetere steatopygous pilgarlick hircine whigmaleerious rhadamanthine lintlickers. I refer you to the reply given in the case of Arkell v. Pressdram.  You are so clueless that if you dressed in a clue skin, doused yourself in clue musk, and did the clue dance in the middle of a field of horny clues at the height of clue mating season, you still would not have a clue. If you were a movie you would be a double feature; Battlefield_Earth and Moron_Movies_II. You would be out of focus.  You are fiends and sniveling cowards, and you have bad breath. You are the unholy spawn of a bandy-legged hobo and a syphilitic camel. You wear strangely mismatched clothing with oddly placed stains. You are degenerate, noxious and depraved. I feel debased just knowing that you exist. I despise everything about you, and I wish you would go away. You are jetsam who dreams of becoming flotsam. You won't make it. I beg for sweet death to come and remove me from a world which became unbearable when the bioterrorists designed you.  It is hard to believe how incredibly stupid you are. Stupid as a stone that the other stones make fun of. So stupid that you have traveled far beyond stupid as we know it and into a new dimension of stupid. Meta-stupid. Stupid cubed. Trans-stupid stupid. Stupid collapsed to a singularity where even the stupons have collapsed into stuponium. Stupid so dense that no intelligence can escape. Singularity stupid. Blazing hot summer day on Mercury stupid. You emit more stupid in one minute than our entire galaxy emits in a year. Quasar stupid. It cannot be possible that anything in our universe can really be this stupid. This is a primordial fragment from the original big stupid bang. A pure extract of stupid with absolute stupid purity. Stupid beyond the laws of nature. I must apologize. I can't go on. This is my epiphany of stupid. After this experience, you may not hear from me for a while. I don't think that I can summon the strength left to mock your moronic opinions and malformed comments about boring trivia or your other drivel. Duh.  The only thing worse than your logic is your manners. Your attempt at regulating the Internet was pitiful. I mean, really, stringing together a bunch of platitudes among a load of babbling was hardly effective... Maybe later in life, after you have learned to read, write, spell, and count, you will have more success. True, these are rudimentary skills that many of us ""normal"" people take for granted that everyone has an easy time of mastering. But we sometimes forget that there are ""challenged"" persons in this world who find these things to be difficult. If I had known that this was true in your case then I would have never have exposed myself to your prposed regulations. It just wouldn't have been ""right."" Sort of like parking in a handicap space. I wish you the best of luck in the emotional, and social struggles that seem to be placing such a demand on you.

WarOnComcast,2ai3sh,bkoppe,9,Sat Jul 12 13:33:27 2014 UTC,I disagree. Nobody at the FCC is going to read all of those comments.

If a comment like this is actually what convinces another person to leave a comment, odds are that person's comment will be of similarly low quality. You want the staffers on your side, because they are the people who filter and summarize what gets to the government officials. At best, this comment will accomplish nothing. At worst, it could cause the person reading it to have less patience for the pro-Net Neutrality comments they read for the rest of the day, regardless of their quality.  Thoughtful, sane messages are always appreciated by staffers, regardless of viewpoint, and those are the best way to actually get your opinion heard by the government officials they work for. Stuff like this, on the other hand, just ensures that the few people arguing for fast lanes - who will all be sending in thoughtful arguments because they're industry professionals - stand out even more in contrast to the pro-Net Neutrality ""crazies"".

WarOnComcast,2acxkg,FoxK56,1 point,Thu Jul 10 22:56:00 2014 UTC,"Same. Mine was a little more drawn out, I stopped paying my bill in June because I was paying $55 for 30/5 service, and was getting 7/7 according to TWC's own speed test plugged directly into my modem.   So, this ended up being a wall of text (leaving it for therapeutic reasons), here's the tl;dr: After a 5 month shitshow, I'm now paying $59/mo for 50/5 service, getting full speed, got 2 months free, and got 2 late fees and a technician fee waived. I paid $129 for 5 months of internet service.   May - slow speed.   June - slower. Stop paying bill.  July - DSL becomes faster, call TWC. Tech cancels appointment because I missed the call I wasn't told to expect. Call to cancel service and switch to DSL, phone support offers free month of service and tech next day - also places note on service call that under no circumstance is the call to be cancelled and NOT to call me, just show up. Tech calls, gets no answer. I call support, they say he hasn't cancelled yet, transfers me to dispatch where I get hung up on. Call support again, notified tech cancelled call, too bad so sad - transfer to retentions to cancel service. Tell retentions ""You can cancel my service, and I want it on that technicians record that it is his responsibility that you lost a customer"" - retentions begs one last chance, I tell them ""No, Absolutely not, I cannot allow someone into my house to work on my network that cannot even comprehend basic english"" - tech sees note on account telling tech not to call or cancel, sees tech called then cancelled, offers second free month of service and tech next day. Tech arrives next day and ""miraculously"" the problem that had been happening for months disappears with a simple reboot of my modem (I rolled my eyes at this, I saw him dicking with the box outside my complex). Tech charges $39.95 service call.   August - bill shows up, call TWC, find out I only received one month credit and got charged for tech, go ballistic on phone. Receive $40 courtesy credit from retentions, reach limit of ""credit"" my account can receive. Am transferred to supervisor escalations, talk to someone very clearly USA employed, and not a normal phone support person. Am given $40 credit (waive tech fee), am told a call audit will be performed to review call recordings to verify what was promised.  September - still getting final notices, call TWC, again, go ballistic on phone. (I say ""go ballistic"" - I start my call with ""I want you to understand, I've worked help desk, I understand how tight your leash is, and my coming tsunami of anger is for TWC and not you."" because I understand how difficult it is to get a job in some parts of india). I called several times in Sept, at the end of it all, it was a wasted month as far as getting anywhere with TWC.   Oct - realize bill is growing every month, call support. Before going ballistic, ask for a full rundown of my bill. Am told there is 3 late fees. Finish building ICBM, press launch button. Tell TWC that ""I am not paying late fees on a bill that is not correct. When you can get me a correct bill, I will pay it; I would expect you to understand the error is on your end and I will absolutely NOT be paying any late fees on this.""   In the end, I ended up paying one of the late fees as I was technically late by not paying June (it was a moral decision on my part, even though June and July ended up credited), and like a cat that finally destroys the toy mouse, calling TWC was no longer providing the stress relief I needed."

Where I am the only option is brighthouse.  They're like time Warner but somehow more expensive, slower, less reliable, less helpful, and more masabatory knowing that they are the only option for most of my area.  Verizon argued in court that cell carriers offered a viable alternative.  It was a shit argument at the time and they knew it but T-mobile has spent millions ensuring that it is a self fulfilling prophecy.  If you get even 1 bar of 4g on t-mobile you're likely going to be faster than 15 mbps.  I currently pay $95 a month, I have unlimited minutes, unlimited text, and, most importantly I have unlimited 4g with hotspot.  In my area in central Florida I get around 60 mbps consistently.  I travel a lot and love to run speed tests.  I've hit in excess of 100 mbps consistently in a number of cities.  I used over 400 GB of Internet last month.  I don't have cable, I don't have home phone, and I don't have home Internet.  Last week we had a strong storm in my area that knocked out power.  I continued playing BL2 online the entire time since the cell tower wasn't affected and I have my PS3 and TV hooked up to a battery back up system.  Seriously.  Go to T-mobile.  They just started a two week risk free trial thing that I've been reading about on /r/tmobile.  Go and try it.  If you don't have service where you need it or it isn't fast enough you return the phone, keep the headset that comes with it, and they won't charge you a thing.  (I think you get to keep the iPhone charger it comes with too.)  T-mobile has been very ethical and trying to fight back against both other carriers and ISPs they don't even compete with.  They don't throttle Netflix. They don't screw you out of anything and they have some of the best customer service if you do have to deal with them.  Seriously, I know a lot of people have heard bad things about T-mobile in the past, some of that was true, a lot of that is At&T and Verizon doing the same shady buy off the government shit they always do.

If your dad has slow internet and tiling that is a strong indication of bad signal levels. Typically those levels are due to bad or misconfigured wiring, but it certainly could be something on Comcast's end.  Get your Dad's account number and contact info and send an email message to: we_can_help@cable.comcast.com Explain that your dad is frustrated and is having ongoing service issues. You'll be talking to Comcast corporate, they can motivate your local system to get the problem resolved and will follow up with your Dad to make sure his issues are fixed."
WarOnComcast,29awmt,nerdburg,11,Sat Jun 28 15:27:32 2014 UTC,"TY for that address, I have passed it on to my dad and told him to be as detailed as he can with everything that has happened.  A few things have changed since my dad spoke with an actual technician at the house. Namely the term I used Scaling is apparently, ""Tiling""(Which I see you already know).  I guess Comcast has also done more than I was aware at first.  They have replaced under the house cabling, they have replaced the drop in his yard, they have replaced all coax in the house and the HDTV boxes.  My parents are paying for the Gold HD whatever TV package and the fastest (I have no idea why, I would have advised them otherwise was I aware previously) Internet speeds Comcast could offer them.   The technician onsite was also in hand with a signal detector and went to 3 other houses on my parents street(All of which have previously called and complained of the same issue(s) on their Comcast HD signal) and he said they ""All failed"" the signal quality test.  They then knew the issue wasn't isolated or related to my dads house/tv.  The tech told my dad ""Don't let support send out any more techs, there is nothing else a tech can do here, this is not where the problem is.  My dad called back, that is when he got told that the issue was indeed on the Comcast system somewhere.  The parts about being told to accept the service or cancel the service still stands.  The part about being told it was on Comcasts hardware also seem to be evidently clear.  I will admit that my mom can get ""carried away"" at times and whether or not they told my parents that they ""Weren't going to fix"" the issue, might be up for some debate. But in other words, they have told my parents that it could be on the primary cable on the telephone pole or it could be even further off than that.  The last thing support offered was a every 5ms ""Light test"" where it sounds like they must run some sort of ""Fiber-Optic Trace Route"" in an effort to detect the actual signal issue in transition on the line.  They told him they would call him before doing this and have as of yet, not followed up with him.  I also found out this issue has gone on much longer than I was aware of involving more than just the few calls my parents had told me about before I said ""Tell me again in detail everything""   So, while I stand by the majority of the situation, the feelings my parents are going through, the frustration and the feeling of being at a dead end with no possibility of a way out are all very real and spelled out in the main post.  It was never my intent to hold back information with this post, my dad had just unloaded all of this on me and I took mental notes on everything I had been told the first time, which in turn, led me to ask more questions to make sure I am putting more info out there.    I hope they can resolve the issue, then I hope I can find a way to move my parents beyond Comcast and onto something better."

He's entitled to a credit from the time he first called and complained until the issue is resolved. If that is months...then he get a credit for months. He's also owed a $20 credit for every time after the first time a tech was out and didn't repair the problem. Only corporate will have the authority to do that though. They will probably also offer him some kind of deal on future service too.   Intermittent issues can be tough to diagnose and correct, but that's Comcast's problem and it shouldn't be causing your family that much grief. I agree with the tech though, don't bother calling the regular phone support anymore, they will just send another tech out that can't fix it.

They were one of these companies sitting on piles of cash while the rest of the country was sitting on their thumbs unemployed.

With something like Cyanogen they can't tell if your data is hotspot or not and as such, if you have the unlimited plan, you can relatively easily get unlimited hotspot."

The reason I point this out is, as much as I love T-Mobile, I hate that they do this. The more consumers use their marketing terminology the same way they do, the more likely other carriers and ISPs will look at this as an alternative to hard bandwidth caps because people won't be as likely to get mad about it based on the verbiage."

They have a usage limit, after which you pay a per GB overage fee, at $1-5 per GB over the limit. 500 GB was the highest limit, on a 50 Mbps connection. Last I calculated it out, they give you 22 hours of usage at max speed, assuming no uploading, just downloading. That's a ridiculous limit per month. I'm having trouble getting DSL in the largest city, the ISP says they aren't selling new connections in my neighborhood, less than a mile from their nearest wire center, and their online tool has been broken for 4+ months to tell if internet is available in the area. The reason I want the DSL service is it has no usage limit or overage fees. I'd rather have 5-15 Mbps at that policy than any faster speed with a limit, when I can use 300 GB a month on 3 Mbps, and regularly do."

I worked support for AT&T's shared server Web hosting and on numerous occasions I'd hear from people who found out that AT&T had been charging them that 10-30 dollars per month for Web hosting,  even in cases where the person hadn't signed up for it.   They would bundle it with their phone/Internet/tv service.   Sometimes the Web hosting fees would be there from the start,  sometimes it would start appearing later.   You could tell the people had never even used the service because their first login attempt to the control panel would bring up A TOS agreement they had to accept to proceed.   There were also a lot of people who were paying both AT&T and yahoo for service after the two companies ended their hosting and email merger.   In some cases this added up to hundreds or thousands of dollars.   Officially AT&T did not provide refunds, but if people argued enough they would let me issue a 90 day courtesy credit.   No exceptions,  even the elderly and non profits were only ever allowed three months.

Next day it went out again, called, second dude knew exactly what he was doing and said ""You haven't been paying for internet for 8 months.""  I knew.  I pretended that I didnt.  He knew I knew.  He conference called someone from billing onto the phone line, but before he did that I asked if they were going to back-charge me.  He said he didn't know.  I said I was a poor college kid and if they did that, I'd have to cancel the service to pay for it.  They didn't back charge me, but now I'm back to actually paying for the service.

AT&T, Verizon, Comcast, and Time Warner have engaged in Sherman Anti-trust Act prohibited actions by colluding together. In conjunction with local municipalities, competition for cable provided services is at an all-time low. Customer satisfaction is low, pricing is way too high, and investment into telecom and internet expansion is at an all time low. These four giant companies have colluded with each other to not compete, and to keep prices higher than a competitive market would allow. While there is minor amounts of competition from other internet providers, barriers to market entry have inhibited other start-ups from offering cable services.

As far as cancellation? If you're going to do that, make it a separate phone call - you want to make sure you take up their time opting out first.  If you do cancel, talk in-depth with the person on the other end as to the reasons why, not so that Comcast the company will know, but so that the random guy working there knows. Do they tell these people anything? Who knows, but you can.  Do you have alternative internet access? You could try dial-up if there's nothing else available, as that still exists. Also look into /r/darknetplan and the meshnet.  If we're actually trying to bankrupt the company... yeah, that was what we were trying to do, wasn't it?

WarOnComcast,28gi3q,UltraSPARC,1 point,Wed Jun 18 20:23:41 2014 UTC,Reputation? Comcast is one of the most disliked companies on this planet and they don't give a shit because you either get your cable TV and your internet though them or you don't get cable TV and internet. The exception being a couple cities with Google Fiber where like we just saw with Aereo will be fought with litigation and not customer service.  If anything actions like the above just give them a better leg to stand on when it comes to net neutrality issues.

WarOnComcast,28gi3q,SCphotog,7,Thu Jun 19 00:26:51 2014 UTC,Presumably the bandwidth could count against each user's cap.  Perhaps Comcast hasn't thought ahead about this though.
WarOnComcast,28gi3q,rreighe2,12,Wed Jun 18 22:16:36 2014 UTC,I don't think that's what's happening...  Comcast definitely plans extensively on how to brutally anally rape their customers.

WarOnComcast,28gi3q,dthemk,1 point,Wed Jun 18 15:40:44 2014 UTC,The public portion is throttled to a fixed rate. This fixed rate is in addition to the private portion. As much as I hate comcast I don't think this mesh of hot spots (even at fixed bw) is bad AS LONG AS you get the bw you pay for (which is the real problem).

WarOnComcast,28ezvz,disgustipatedopiate,31,Wed Jun 18 01:17:10 2014 UTC,It means that Comcast is using your router as a Wi-Fi hotspot for the public.
WarOnComcast,28ezvz,midnitewarrior,6,Wed Jun 18 01:36:37 2014 UTC,The XIFINITY WIFI should be its own separate network with its own dedicated data channel back to the Comcast network.  This traffic should never be on your private network unless Comcast really screwed things up.
WarOnComcast,28ezvz,UltraSPARC,5,Wed Jun 18 06:03:46 2014 UTC,"Exactly this. If you're seeing random MACs showing up in your routers history, it means something else. Make sure you're not using WEP."

Also, we got a message in the mail stating that we would be one of the 500,000 homes but it never showed up on my list and you can't find it.

I have had good guys that completely rewired the house just to fix a signal issue, while another one reset my tv tuner and ran out the door before he could see the problem (like i didn't try that before he came), another guy added several splitters (degrading the quality even further) and connected some old cables from the 90s that they never removed in under the house.

WarOnComcast,289y44,Purpledrank,32,Mon Jun 16 12:55:32 2014 UTC,Coaxial cable companies are Comcast is like the coal and railroad industry desperately trying to cling onto their carefully backed monopolies by thwarting the construction of roads and gas stations.
WarOnComcast,289y44,hoochyuchy,23,Mon Jun 16 12:56:53 2014 UTC,The similarities between the current cable companies and the old rail companies is actually pretty damn scary.
WarOnComcast,289y44,Whoaduder,3,Mon Jun 16 14:42:54 2014 UTC,Any good reading materials you can link to? I've done some research on this but would love further recommendations.
WarOnComcast,289y44,hoochyuchy,5,Mon Jun 16 17:50:01 2014 UTC,"Nothing much, but from the information I've gathered the only way the ISPs will be stopped are from A:  Heavy government oversight and laws, B:  An actual union of workers under ISPs (the rail union played a fairly big role in actually getting the job to be worth working, at least from my understanding) and C: another business takes over.  A is iffy because bribery and lobbyists, but I have faith that the government will supply a law that will help rather than hinder, it just takes time for it to happen because red tape, waiting lists, etc.  B could work for the very same reason that my father (former rail employee) explained to me:  They can so damn easily fuck the system in ways you wouldn't believe.  An example:  Nowadays trains run off of a lot of sensors, signals, and electrical wires that the operators on the train have grown to rely absolutely on.  If a disgruntled employee decided to, he could cut those wires or worse yet confuse the signals and force trains in an area to a crawl because they need to go that slow in order to avoid a crash in the case of an emergency.  Now lets say you have an entire union at your disposal nationwide.  It just takes one consensus to absolutely fuck up the entire system nationwide, causing delays on deliveries causing your company stock to plummet causing your company to just basically die.  This is why you don't see rail strikes a lot nowadays.  Now, apply this to ISPs and you get the idea.  All of it is very much illegal, but so should be the profiteering scam that ISPs have.  It would be the very last last-ditch effort to force ISPs to bend to public opinion.  C:  A new business would definitely be Google and their fiber service, but even that won't help much until it actually gets enough steam to force ISPs to bend over.  Tbh, all we need to do now is wait and see what Google and the government do before anything drastic is done on our parts.  Tl;dr:  Rail fell because of unions, legeslation, and new business.  The same applies here.  Unions because they run you and can ruin you just as easy, Legislation because if you can be arrested for it they will, and new business because old practices couldn't adapt.

But to play devil's advocate for a bit, I do have to say that the government is actually doing what I expected them to do (at least, as far as congress goes).  The problem of net neutrality has been a problem for a while but has really only come to the attention of the public in the past couple years.  Because the government is basically a giant bureaucracy created from red tape I never expected them to do anything about the neutrality problem for at least 4 years.  They need to do investigations, investigations on those investigations, and then create a committee to interpret those investigations and launch even more investigations.  It isn't that they're completely complacent and don't give two shits about the public (although, that is true), its that they can't move forward with ANYTHING, positive or negative, until they've built a nice, big case.  Until we see an actual bill enter congress concerning Net Neutrality and the prevention of ISP fuckery I plan on just sitting back and waiting to see if the government has any redeeming qualities or if I need to start working on an action plan for plan B."

WarOnComcast,28a1f0,Rpaulv,2,Mon Jun 16 21:45:04 2014 UTC,"K, then it's safe to assume you have centurylink as the Internet provider bundled with DirecTV, in which case, Comcast is sadly the better of the two. This is coming from someone who is currently stuck with CenturyLink as his only option and has previously been with Comcast. I had minimal interaction with Comcast over my account and Internet speeds as I was consistently getting close to what I was quoted. I did have a small issue with a tech coming out,  quoting me no charge and then Comcast charging me $50 for it. This was eventually refunded to my bill after several months.  Aside from that however their service itself was clean. Centurylink on the other hand I cannot say the same about. I am paying for 40mbps download speed and sitting consistently at 10-30 depending on the time of day. This can be attributed to the huge amount of traffic since they're the only Service provider in the complex, but could easily be remedied by updating their infrastructure in the complex, which they won't do.   Tl;Dr I hate to feed any more cash into Comcast, but they are probably your best option for Internet service. I would however recommend Direct TV for Television service."

I'm assuming (hopefully correctly) that OP's congressman has issued no formal statement on the matter. You would think (again, hopefully) someone in his office would go, ""Uh, ay Bob. Your people want to know about this Net Neutrality thing and you've been silent on it thus far. Now you're getting personal inquiries about it.""  A. Having an intern issue a standard response on an uncommented matter shows little care. Although it's possible that he had a standard response that said, ""Thanks for your concern I will be issuing a public statement on such and such time"" we won't know since that's not what OP received.  B. If the congressman doesn't ever issue a statement, then either way it's not in his favor. Either because he never got involved in it with his constituents or because the inferred afterthought of ""Thank you for your concerns about Net Neutrality"" was but I'm really not going to do shit about it or take a stand on it because of reasons. Reasons I could think up would be, I don't support it but if I publicly state that I'm tying my own noose. Or, I do support it but I can't lose all my big corp contributors by stating it publicly.  In reality, he/she was elected by the people to represent the people. They owe the people a statement either way on such a heated topic. Because honestly, come next cycle that they are up for election, there will probably not be as many people doing a refresher on their rep's voting record vs the memory of how they either stood for the people and Net Neutrality, or handed them to the wolves.  Edit: (How did I forget the point of it) Um, the point being in making the rep look stupid. Plain and simple. Then in a way it forces comment on the issue. ...fucking politics."

Even if you don't actually plan to cancel, if you just act (or maybe it wouldn't be acting) like you're completely fed up with Comcast they'll usually break and give you a better deal or some free months or something. Just recently happened to my brother that his internet was ridiculously slow compared to what the deal advertised and he called and argued and they gave him a free month, and I don't even think he has a second option for internet.  It's like the suckiest way to do business ever, but with Comcast you just have to argue the fuck out of them before they start to give you what you want.

WarOnComcast,27vjnd,jessejanderson,10,Thu Jun 12 00:12:22 2014 UTC,This would be great if they did something like make it a business deal and offer you an incentive to allow them to use your router for this. Perhaps a discount on your bill and unlimited data caps.    it allows city-wide wifi using already existing infrastructure if you have enough people opt-in. My main issue is the way they're doing it as a poorly publicized opt-out. Are they even raising bandwidth caps? Or are people going to start seeing massive spikes in their usage?

I clicked it, and it asked me for my Comcast username and password. Since I'm not a comcast customer, I just backed out of it. But it looks like you must be a comcast customer and log in using your customer info.   At the time I thought Comcast had cut a deal with my city to install wifi hotspots. I'm assuming now that one of her elderly neighbors has a comcast router and is now serving as a hotspot unknowingly.   Of course this also opens up a security question: What's to stop me from naming my router ""Xfinity Wifi"" and having the connect page be a dupe of comcast's, and then use it to phish for passwords?"
WarOnComcast,27vjnd,atomicxblue,1 point,Thu Jun 12 14:30:40 2014 UTC,Huh I see. So its rarely a positive unless you are visiting a friend's house or something and you still have comcast. But then if your friend already has wifi whats stopping them from just letting you use it. The only other benefit would be if maybe you lived in a clustered area and people walking by used it to look for something on the Internet.

Many routers have a 'guest network' option, and my only reason for not turning it on would be fringe concerns about neighbors torrenting on it or some pervert looking up kiddie porn and it being linked to my home address.  If the wifi is public and connects through a separate public IP, I shouldn't be implicated in either case.  (I presume this is how they handle XFinity WiFi supposedly using an additional bandwidth allocation on top of your paid service, to not affect your connection if it's used.  Since the cable modem is what controls that bandwidth provisioning, if it all went through NAT on your one public IP, they wouldn't be able to make that claim since the cable modem would only see one lump of traffic.)"

Unfortunately, they are allowed to do this.  The only message comcast understands is, ""The Dollar"". If everyone cancels their accounts any time on December, I bet they will change their tune mighty quickly. But unfortunately, this will never happen and comcasts knows it."
WarOnComcast,27td6d,Stu_Padasso,6,Tue Jun 10 21:40:17 2014 UTC,"The difference is they also don't put another tiered paid cap on you, like speed. Water is delivered the same to everyone, it's just overall consumption. Electricity is a bit different in that there are different voltages, but that is comparable between a real business tier connection (dedicated T1 or something) versus household.   Also, though I also dislike the two main telecoms, the speed of your data connection is based nearly souly on your own phone. They only meter data.   Sorry to say, the comparisons don't hold up"
WarOnComcast,27td6d,ByrdmanRanger,3,Tue Jun 10 22:16:21 2014 UTC,"It's all metered, but they're charging you generation cost plus some other fees. Comcast et all is charging you all those fees, plus multiple times what the bandwidth costs."

Also, I can't stress this enough, but make sure they disconnect your residential internet and take all their hardware (if you are renting it), because they will try and screw you over.  They tried to charge me for 4 months of residential internet after I had signed up and received the business class hardware and connection.   They said it was my fault the residential internet wasn't disconnected, despite me telling them to turn it off. Why the hell would I need the residential connection when I just signed up for business class?! They then tried to follow up with ""well... we don't have a log of receiving our hardware back"", to which I reminded them that should be correct because I used my own modem and router.  This loop continued for the 12-15 people I talked to and took me 3 weeks of phone calls to finally get the bills sorted out and them to admit fault."
WarOnComcast,27td6d,Squabbler,9,Tue Jun 10 21:14:59 2014 UTC,"Same situation I've had with my own modem. Every few months they do an ""audit"" and find that I'm not paying a rental fee for my modem. That I own, and is NOT Comcast's. So they start charging the fee until I goto a Comcast service center and dispute it. Ridiculous."
WarOnComcast,27td6d,entangledphysx,7,Tue Jun 10 22:38:29 2014 UTC,"Me too.  I hate them so much.  I did have one awesome tech a few years back who actually was a cool guy and worked to figure out a connection issue I was having.  I still remember him going through my apartment and testing all the wires until he found a faulty splitter in the wall, AND REPLACED IT FREE OF CHARGE.  This was after weeks of phone calls and multiple rep visits (well, it must be your modem/router/computer/karma... it must be the weather... it's not our equipment I checked it and so did the last guy...).  That guy was cool, fuck everyone else who works for Comcast."
WarOnComcast,27td6d,AssaultMonkey,2,Wed Jun 11 04:06:27 2014 UTC,"I owned my own modem as well, bought many years ago. At some point their system clicked and they began charging me rental fees. I called to complain, but they refused to stop charging me rental fees unless I agreed to bring in the device to a Comcast center for ""verification"". I asked them when they delivered the device to me, and what its serial number was, and they said they couldn't find that information since it was too long ago and they asked me to provide them the serial number of the device for verification. I didn't.  I cancelled service with them about a year later, and they harassed me about returning the equipment which they claim was theirs. Eventually I just sent them my cable modem to be done with it, since they said they'd bill me and send it to collections if I didn't return the equipment.  I lost the receipt for the modem years ago, but it was purchased in the early 2000s and they'd only begun charging me rental fees much later."
WarOnComcast,27td6d,lext,1 point,Tue Jun 17 21:35:12 2014 UTC,"When I first had this problem with Comcast, I went to their service center, and they said that they needed proof that it wasn't their modem (it was purchased from them years and years ago, and I didn't have the receipt). So of course they also don't have that info in their system.  I bring the modem with just in case. I said, look, here's my modem. They said since the serial number of the modem was the same that was on my account, that it had to be Comcasts modem. Like DUH GUYS, you required me to give you the serial number from the modem when I signed up over the phone! GAH!!! They ask for the s/n, then say it's their equipment because the s/n's match. It's so bizarre, you really can't make this stuff up...  Even though when I signed up with comcast 8 months prior to this issue, with a self-installation and no equipment sent to me when I signed up. They still didn't believe me that it was my modem, even though they had no record of me getting any equipment from them. It's like, hey guys, if you don't have a record of sending me equipment, and I'm telling you that you didn't, I think we both can be pretty damn sure it's MY equipment!"

Between the boys and I we probably buy two or three games a month total, and they range anywhere between 2-15 gigs each.  that's another 4-45 gigs.  We play several games that sometimes require 1-2 GB patches a few times a month; slap on another 8 gigs.  The problem is that there is no normalcy to our bill.  Sometimes we use 180GB, but there have been months where we've got as high as 700, which is $40 in fees.  That's a 50% increase in our internet bill."

You will get symmetric connection, might not have any DPI applied to your traffic, and will have the option of a static IP. There's also no throttling because, unlike consumer service providence, business service providence is actually competitive. Maybe it is worth the cost."
WarOnComcast,27td6d,UltraSPARC,2,Tue Jun 10 23:45:50 2014 UTC,"Comcast does not offer symmetric services over coax. You are on the SAME node as consumer users. They throttle you more than consumers. If you pay for 50/10, you only get 50/10. You have to sign at least a one year contract. You pay extra for a static.   Source: I have 5 offices on Comcast Business cable service in Maryland, DC, and Virginia. All offices behave exactly as described above. I have consumer Comcast where I'm paying for 30/5 and am getting 140/30. It's like they want to give consumers more speed so they hit these caps faster!"

Other than that, this is insane. No symmetrical connection? As for connecting to the same nodes as consumers, yes but you're not going through the same links to the internet, which is what matters here. As for your more-than-paid-for speed on consumer, you're one of few with this ""problem"" on Comcast."
WarOnComcast,27td6d,UltraSPARC,2,Wed Jun 11 15:06:35 2014 UTC,"I'd consider it throttling because the node supports faster speeds, but they cap your modem. They don't do this for consumers in our area - just business class. I've reproduced these results many times in the DMV area.  You do not go through other ""links"" as you described. All of Comcast's coax users share the same node AND backbone. Business users are given a different gateway, but that's purely for managing the business users and their extra ""features"". I think you're confusing Comcast's offerings with true enterprise grade internet. We have this at work, 100/100 EoC pipe. We pay a pretty penny for that privilege and the SLA that comes with it.  Comcast used to offer every single business class ""feature"" to consumers (before they invented business class)."
WarOnComcast,27td6d,Shiroi_Kage,2,Wed Jun 11 15:38:04 2014 UTC,"Throttling never means making you have the speed cap you paid for. Never. It's about controlling traffic from certain places, like Netflix, or giving you a lower bandwidth than what you paid for. I've never tried business-class connections so you would have to tell me if things fall below your 50/10 often.  As for the links thing, my bad. I confused this with Verison (they have a Tier 1 network for Verison Business, unlike their Tier 3 for consumer) You would probably still be prioritized through routing software though."
WarOnComcast,27td6d,UltraSPARC,1 point,Wed Jun 11 15:46:10 2014 UTC,"Haha agree to disagree. But anyways, speeds do fall during peak hours in the office buildings (11am-1pm, people taking lunch breaks and watching YouTube, etc).

WarOnComcast,27td6d,TeslaIsAdorable,-1,Tue Jun 17 21:28:16 2014 UTC,"I'm curious what the hell the OP is doing to consume that much bandwidth?  At the most Netflix will consume about 2.3GB/hour to stream high definition movies.  That works out to 13 hours of high definition movies per day at your current rate.  This is WAY over the average consumption of internet users and well above the average of the top 15%:   The Sandvine report also examined consumption patterns among different cohorts of users. The top 15% of bandwidth users dominate network usage in North America, accounting for 54% of total monthly network traffic in March. That group consumes on average 212 gigabytes per month, the equivalent of 100 hours of video and more than seven times the 29 GB of a typical subscriber. (Sandvine termed this top 15th percentile of users âcord-cutters,â speculating that they are relying on the Internet for video entertainment â but it doesnât actually know whether those consumers have canceled pay TV.)  Overall, mean average usage per subscriber for wireline broadband in North America was 51.4 GB in the first half of 2014, up from 44.5 GB last fall. That increase is in line with the 30%-40% annual growth rate in bandwidth consumption ISPs are forecasting for 2014, according to Sandvine. SOURCE   Netflix will be your biggest use by far.  Games and music do not come close (people think games are a big use but they really aren't apart from the initial download of a given game...online gaming is pretty low bandwidth...IIRC Battlefield 3 uses about 80MB/hour).  Normal browsing and email hardly register.  I am no fan of Comcast by a long stretch but maybe this time they have a legitimate gripe.  I cannot imagine what your house is doing to consume that much bandwidth.  Whatever the case I hope you don't live in my neighborhood."
WarOnComcast,27td6d,Zerowantuthri,5,Wed Jun 11 04:22:37 2014 UTC,"I can easily burn through 200GB in a day. There is more to the internet than Netflix, hell I don't even use my subscription"
WarOnComcast,27td6d,TRY_LSD,6,Wed Jun 11 04:49:49 2014 UTC,"I cannot think what you would do at home that would use 200GB a day that is a bigger bandwidth hog than video streaming.  Only things that come to mind might be torrents and/or a home web server.  What you would want to torrent that uses 200GB (or a significant portion of that) per day (or 6 TB/month) on a regular basis is beyond me. I cannot imagine having enough storage at home to handle that (72TB/year).   If you are running a web server from home to hit that bandwidth you are violating the Comcast TOS (nothing new there...they have never allowed that).  Bottom line, as you can see from the Sandvine stats I posted, you are waaaay beyond even heavy user usage (whatever it is you are doing)."

I'll post the full letter below if anyone wants to read it, but he basically responded to a totally different topic. It's really sad. And, yes, I know, Mississippi... sigh.   Thank you for contacting me regarding the regulation of the Internet by the United Nations.  As your Congressman, I am committed to putting the needs of Mississippi families first.  Knowing your views and ideas on federal legislation is critical in order to best represent Mississippians.  Your comments are always appreciated. As you are likely aware, the United Nations is considering a proposal that would give the UN's International Telecommunication Union (ITU) more control over the Internet.  Cyber-security, data privacy, and technical standards would all fall under UN purview, rather than the private and nonprofit sectors under which it currently operates.  Further, the proposal would allow European telecom companies to charge more to carry international traffic, forcing American companies like Google or Netflix to pay more in fees to global operators.    A proposal like this would stifle innovation and damage the American economy.  In the past, Congress has already voted unanimously in favor of a resolution promoting a global Internet free from government control and urging our delegation to the United Nations to ensure this continues.  I will continue to work to make certain that the Internet remains free from UN control, promoting innovation and free market economic growth in the process. Again, thank you for contacting me and helping me better understand the concerns of Mississippians. If there is anything else I can do for you, please don't hesitate to contact me.  As a reminder, please visit my website www.palazzo.house.gov and sign up for our E-newsletter for updates on issues and legislation.  Sincerely, (signed) Steven M. Palazzo Member of Congress"

WarOnComcast,27fl4y,SIlentguardian11,2,Fri Jun 6 19:02:33 2014 UTC,"In a truly voluntary capitalist society a monopoly would be the IDEAL scenario. This would mean that this company's product or service is so good that no one has felt the urge to challenge them. Should there be a problem with their service, a competitor would appear - no crazy regulation or ""legal"" monopolies would exist in this society. Because the original monopoly had bad service, people would be willing to switch to the new company thus funding this new company.   The only rules you have to follow are those you agreed to in a voluntary contract.  If a particular carrier did have a non-government enforced local monopoly on a certain geographic region, and that carrier discriminated against certain websites by providing lower bandwidth to them, that would be seen as undesirable for many of their customers. This would provide additional financial incentive for a competitive carrier to go into business to compete against the local monopoly."

You could make the argument that in a highly-competitive ISP marketplace, allowing ISPs to charge whatever fees they wanted wouldn't be a problem because people would naturally flock to the businesses that don't charge those fees (I would disagree with this argument, but it's at least a reasonable argument).  But there are practically no choices and no alternatives if you want high-speed Internet in the US.   Literally, the best case scenario is if every ""commercially unreasonable"" action is taken to court (won't happen), is a fair trial decided by people who are unbiased and very technologically adept (won't happen), and in every case, is ruled correctly (won't happen). EVEN IF all of that happens, it's still at an enormous cost to the taxpayer who foots the bill for the trials.  That's the best case scenario. If anyone thinks that ISPs won't press their luck in court, they should realize how much money is at stake."

They justify their stances with references to the constitution in ways, at least to me, that are incorrect.  How does net neutrality violate free speech? On the contrary, I would think that lack of net neutrality would violate free speech, as you make the internet a place where only those who can afford the fast lane can be heard.   I also don't understand how the internet can be considered private property. Perhaps this argument is a bit better than the first, but I think on an ethical standpoint, the internet is so important that we shouldn't allow it to be considered private property in such a way that there are fast lanes and slow lanes. Nevertheless, in reply to Bridenstine's claim, I would argue that the government in no way would tell the cable companies how much they can charge for service, only that when a customer purchases that service, they receive equal access to all internet activities.  I don't see how the internet is different from telephones, and I think they both should be class II common carriers. If I want to call the hospital or my grandmother, I should and do receive equal call clarity and access. Same should apply for the internet.

It was taken over by Comcast that year during the Adelphia dissolution. Time Warner Cable had already begun to implement their own home security service in Houston by 2006, and that service was assumed by Comcast when they entered the market. Whatever the fuck up was in this case, it was almost assuredly a result of the TW-to-Comcast transition.  It's no coincidence that Comcast's service was ""first unveiled"" in Houston. They'd acquired the system from Time Warner in 2007 and had been building it out for several years prior to launching it."

Comcast assumed responsibility for it when they took over that customer (and the rest of the Houston market) in 2007.  The customer's bills have been coming from Comcast, not from Time Warner, since 2007. If the service being billed for was not being provided, that is entirely on Comcast. The fact that Comcast did not launch their own branded home security service until 2010 is irrelevant.  I stand by my statement: the story is not BS."

From what I've read of the linked article, I can say I share this gentleman's sentiment.  It boils down to this: ISPs are terrible, but the government's no better, and could be worse. We're all so caught up in this current issue of chairman Wheeler's proposed rules that a lot of us fail to realize that the problem lies not within the corruption of the corporations, but the fact that there is zero incentive for them to improve and ""innovate"" (which at this point is a wildly inaccurate term, as we are behind the curve in most respects and any improvements would be just that ""improvements"", innovation implies doing something completely new and different, but this isn't an English class.) I pay right now $35 per month to centurylink for 40mbps down and 20mbps up, would I love faster speeds? Hell yes! Does centurylink care? No. Why? because no matter what speed they give me I'm still going to give them my $ because I can't just go get a faster speed from another ISP, because there isn't one. And that's the problem. And that problem exists BECAUSE of government regulations and restrictions, so why the hell would I want them telling the ISPs how to give me access? I don't like Comcast, Centurylink, or Cox (those being the three I've used between 3 separate apts), but these days, I don't like our government any better, at the federal or state level. (Btw most utilities are mandated and regulated at the state level, not federal, at least by my understanding.)  This is just my understanding and why I don't think Title II is the solution. Feel free to provide ample evidence to change my mind. Also I do understand that the FCC has proposed using ""only the relevant bits"" of Title II, and that may be a decent band-aid for the moment, but it doesn't solve the problem."
WarOnComcast,26w4m2,animeflagger123,1 point,Fri May 30 22:29:39 2014 UTC,"Sorry for the delayed response. There are a couple of items I'd like to respond to:   ISPs are terrible, but the government's no better   Absolutely, bear with me here, but as an example of local government working quite well for the people Municipal Broadband projects have the potential to lower prices and create competition whereas the private industry has just stagnated and gotten more expensive instead of faster & cheaper, as you noted. Additionally, municipal government typically has to be held accountable by the people. I know that's not saying much these days, but compared to a privatized monopoly that answers to... well no one. Surprisingly, a lot of municipal governments are as pissed as we are, and are therefore compelled by nature to innovate and compete. My city recently announced it has a ton of dark fiber that it is considering selling connectivity to homes with. Gigabit fiber for $40 or so a month where Centurylink also doesn't care to offer me anything more than 40/5. Qwest had originally intended our node to offer up to 40/40, but after CL took over, they quickly nipped that.  Back to Net Neutrality, my point is the Telcos & ISPs of the time were given their chance and a bunch of money, and antics like this is the result.  PBS had a good Pulpit segment on this: http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/2007/pulpit_20070810_002683.html  Moving on to Title II, ultimately you're  right, it is just a band-aid. And that's why I support it - it is a step in the right direction, or at the very least, a step away from what I perceive to certainly be a terrible one; that is, the ability to effectively ransom traffic types and prioritize based on monetary kickbacks. Title II doesn't attempt to fix things that aren't broken like most regulation, it just demands that all traffic be treated equally, which I think is fair, and the kind of regulation that is not only needed (based on current example), but also helps us consumers. The fact that the FCC is willing to forbear certain parts of Title II so it is a better fit for current technology is, in my opinion, further good faith that they wish to apply it in a proper and meaningful manner. In the meantime, something else definitely needs to be done regarding competition, such as the Municipal Broadband, or something else entirely who knows, but I view it as a separate issue that doesn't directly relate to Net Neutrality other than it's going to be harder to do the latter without the former.  Let me know what you think!"

The government needs to stay out of this. Period. If the government wasn't involved we would still have a wonder internet. Lobbyists couldnt manipulate the market if the avenues for which the manipulation were gone.  I know the grounds for the internet were invented by government officials but the fact is it couldn't be as large as it is not unless it were private.

Source  I will admit that there are many example of when the private sector does a much better job of creating products and services. Your examples were several of them. But the difference is that all of those have competitors.   At best, internet service providers are a duopoly. At worst, they are a monopoly. Comcast should not have ever been allowed to get as large as they are now. And they should be heavily regulated to make sure they aren't taking advantage of their monopoly. Companies that provide gas for heating your home or electricity to run your lights are heavily regulated for the same reason.   Could you imagine if every road in the country was privately owned and you had to negotiate with every owner just to drive somewhere? It would be mass chaos.   It boils down to figuring out which industries will thrive without regulation and which ones won't. And it is no coincidence that the ones that need the most regulation are the ones with the least amount of competition."

I ended up having to short my rent and make that up next paycheck.  What I don't get is, so I canceled the service before the end of the month, so they basically issued me a credit on the adjustment... on a bill for the next month (after I canceled service). Turns out, the first bill I had paid was for next month's service and the second bill was for the following month. Like, wtf. Why would I pay you at the start of April for service from May to June?... Second, if I canceled service in April... why did I get sent ANOTHER bill for June to July?  Edit: Actually... I have an interesting theory. The negative balance is what is shown as ""DUE"" on my account. I wonder what would happen if I tried to ""pay"" it?"

We're gonna have to back the other side, with big money, who have come out in protest or have talked about competition.  I live in Colorado.  As great as many media sites, Reddit, and other outlets have been with raising awareness, Comcast has the disposable income ten-fold to quickly avert the public's short attention span.  Ads non stop on Youtube and plastered everywhere else about their love for quirky, awkward comedians and puppies and kitties and how nobody thinks they're child-raping bastards anymore.  Thing is, I noticed they were preparing somehow, for something, a few years ago. When not only did they have those ridiculous commercials featuring every possible ethnicity preaching their new-found lust for customer satisfaction, but having people walking around shaking hands like your local city treasurer.  I moved a couple times in 2011 and developed this awkward relationship with one of their sales reps (boots on the pavement campaign, poor bastards) and she worked her ASS off for whatever pittance they were paying her.  Everyone in the neighborhood was in love with her, she would make house calls to adjust people's bills, toss around $50 gift cards if you had a service interruption, calling techs and supervisors to yell at them if something wasn't working right, the list goes on and on.  She extended everyone's 12 month lower-price trials, and could probably name every single man, woman, child, dog, parakeet and any other creature in about 50 homes.  I didn't have any problems other than the occasional outage, and at that time they were still doing the ""call the customer before they can call us"" thing which was almost always accurate about the time it predicted service to resume.  Then the kind sales rep lady would call the next day, ask if it caused you any problems with work (yeah girl!  I totally missed some double XP action in BF3) and she was nice enough that you probably wouldn't lie, but even then you'd see a thoughtful little discount on your bill the next month.  2013 comes around and no more nice.  All gone.  They ran out?  Na, no need for nice anymore.  The boots on the ground became these overgroomed, 1950's style door to door salesmen types (no offense if you were one of them, I know you probably had the dot of a sniper rifle on your back).  The nice recorded real person calls about interruptions disappeared, and when you called you got this smarmy southpark sounding message, ""Oh we're so sorry, service in your area appears to be down, we expect it to come back oh I don't know, sometime between today and next week"".  The good techs were probably fired for asinine reasons (AKA they made too much money) and replaced with folks that, bless their poor souls, probably received very little training and even less warning that customers might not always be happy to see them...  I was then faced with a week long battle about using my own modem but leasing a router from comcast (stupid I know but I was broke) all because the tech unknowingly confused a DCT700 with the Netgear he was supposed to grab.  On the phone with his boss, he says, ""the router is in the van"", but no he is not allowed to walk out there and get it, and I felt so bad for him as he appeared to think he made a mistake that would either get him fired or haunt him for the rest of his life.  I called and canceled a week long fight over the stupid router, selling some crap on craigslist to afford my own.  THEN purely out of spite (please someone tell me it wasn't PURE SPITE) they make me re-register my modem, and then kill my upstream and try to tell me it was because I was using only my own equipment, and that I caused a line problem (apartments were brand new).  Huge rant I know but I hope my rage against the comcast machine can illustrate a little the change we saw here in CO, and it was nice to vent a little too.  A lot of us are pretty damned scared of how this will affect well, just about every single thing there is... but I think the biggest problem is that people don't look at the past enough.  The conglomerate has learned how to deal with the public, and they've been collecting data on how to manipulate the mainstream for years.  They were ready for whatever we had to throw at them, impregnating our government with their Borg was just one small part of a very big plan.  edit: words n stuff"

Talking heads are going to spare no expense to seduce you.  You are here on Reddit, you already know what's happening:  Make sure that others, your family, friends, colleagues, that dude next door who binges Breaking Bad on Netflix every 2 weeks.  Start a conversation.  If they aren't informed, talk to them in a way THEY will understand and empathize with.  Don't just blast out reasons it's a bad idea and how it could affect the world or their Youtube habits.  You have to keep it short and sweet.  If you come of as sounding too adamant, arrogant or shed a hint of conspiracy-theory they will most likely tune you out.  The small videos about fast lanes, those help, but finding something they can relate to without any tech or legal babble, is your first foot in the door.  Getting through, inspiring them to also believe making a phone call, educating themselves, and talking to other folks, that should be your real goal.  Most people I've talked to respond less to the ""lane"" talk and most wouldn't even care if their bills DOUBLED.  What they've responded to more is the humanity of it all, the fairness debate, and how it could affect the job and economy segments.  Regular dudes don't feel tingly inside about giant corporations swallowing up thousands of jobs just to go on hiring freezes, hell, compare this merger with recent Walmart protests, the lines can be drawn if you think about it.

This was right after I took over billing after a housemate moved out, and the first thing I did was cancel cable.   Curious, I researched the service and discovered it was some form of streaming cable through the Comcast website. The kicker was that the website prompted that we had to order the service before we could access it, yet there it was as a charge on the monthly bill.  I called customer service and pushed them to refund the three months I discovered we had been billed for stating that the charges had been unauthorized. They were happy enough to comply, but I find it unacceptable that I had to be vigilant enough to detect the charge and take my time to deal with.  Since then I have discovered ""Streampix"" on both my parents and significant others Comcast bills.  Where are the anti-trust regulators questioning the legality of the Comcast / TW merger again?"

I believe they do this to juice their cable subscription numbers to make it look like people still want what they have to offer.  I don't own a TV at all. They sent me the DVR box once and I took the time and gas to bring it back to the nearest storefront 20 miles away. My main concern being their monthly rental fee for the thing.   At the beginning of the Olympics, I called comcast to find out how to get it streaming live through xfinity online as they advertised they would.  2 days later another DVR box arrives...and I never even got the Olympics to stream through Xfinity online. The 2nd one is in the closet now, but I have thought about walking a few doors down to give it to whoever drives their Xfinity van home from work. So far, there hasnt been a rental fee for the box though..."

It's almost like Comcast is purposely charging people in the hopes they don't notice, but when they do notice to refund them their money, interest free!  It's almost like... Comcast is using these dubious tactics as interest-free loans from their customers. ""Sorry about those charges, they are of course reversed!"" Multiply that by how many customers they're screwing over, and it's like they're running their own bank. Jeepers."
WarOnComcast,25tmul,thebackhand,2,Sun May 18 08:27:08 2014 UTC,"I wish I could upvote this more. This is an excellent idea and really should be looked into more.  I actually used to work for a retail company that used to do something very similar, instead they would charge someone a very small fee one time and then keep that small fee in their system, and then bank on the customer never remembering to come and get that money. The money they made on interest alone was STAGGERING, until someone found out about this loophole and they had to pay out to all these people less they get sued. Honestly it sounds a LOT like this only worse. More of we will charge you and just hope you don't find out, which honestly I think cable and phone companies have been doing for years.

Now that he's been in office for years, I do see the hope in uncovered persons now being covered by health insurance, but every other decision he's made or been responsible for has been sending America down a slippery slope towards government control by wealthy, powerful corporations.

The biggest problem with the whole ""us vs. those dirty poor people"" mentality is that people don't willingly embrace a life of hardship and destitute conditions.  These people want to work too.

Is this how your system ideally works out?  What determination is there to judge whether a person is ""worthy"" of aid in a situation beyond their control?  Shouldn't paying into taxes like any good citizen be justification enough?  I'm not saying we should have to pay medical costs for people living outside of the system and not contributing to society.  I'm saying that citizens of this country should not have to choose between eating a meal in their home or seeking medical help.  However, as it is, medical care is a luxury in today's America.  People regularly forgo regular check-ups (that could catch symptoms before conditions worsen) and procedures that they might not need immediately just so they can eat and stay under a roof.  So what?  These people should either die of their illness or starve after being cleaned out by medical bills?  If you think the system we currently have works, you clearly are blinded by privileged living.  Edit: And the bottom-feeders you mention are a very small fraction of the people who receive benefits.

I mean, don't get me wrong, first termers might not be the best ever either, but at least they still pretend. But right not it looks like Obama just doesn't even kind of care, and why would he? He has no chance of being a president again. With the whole ""it's not my senator"" mentality that allows a low-approval congress to perpetuate, he might even get back into his home-state senate, or else his political career is too fucked and he's giving it up for a place on the board of some cable company.  From here on out, I expect all I'm going to be doing these days is picking the best of the new guys and just say fuck it to any returning presidents. It's frankly not worth the risk."

The other thing to keep in mind as Comcast's user base grows that means they have to get more ipv4 addresses which costs them more money at this point  The reason you haven't seen a lot of adaption of ipv6 in the consumer space is mainly due to router providers not supporting ipv6 or at least properly  TL;DR your theory is flawed

Additionally, if you put in a written filing, you can link to it any time you talk to someone about the issue.  Instead of, in your subreddit's side bar, asking what people know how to do, why don't you come up with a list of specific things you want done, and then people can decide if they want to do them? If ""calling your senators and filing with the FCC"" isn't sufficient, then what, in your mind, is? I've been suggesting meshnet (see /r/darknetplan), but that's kind of technical at the moment and not everyone has the time to work on that. There's also asking people to check whether their local area has any legally enforced monoplies, and if so complaining about it. There's NOT signing up for AT&T UVerse. There's testing your ISP. There's spreading this around (song, pic, and thread).  Could you please be specific as to ""what more"" you want people to do (besides subscribing to your subreddit)?"
WarOnComcast,25tzcm,OakTable,1 point,Sun May 18 05:03:28 2014 UTC,"Meshnet:       A mesh network is a network topology in which each node (called a mesh node) relays data for the network. All nodes cooperate in the distribution of data in the network.  A mesh network can be designed using a flooding technique or a routing technique. When using a routing technique, the message is propagated along a path, by hopping from node to node until the destination is reached. To ensure all its paths' availability, a routing network must allow for continuous connections and reconfiguration around broken or blocked paths, using self-healing algorithms. A mesh network whose nodes are all connected to each other is a fully connected network. Mesh networks can be seen as one type of ad hoc network. Mobile ad hoc networks (MANET) and mesh networks are therefore closely related, but MANET also have to deal with the problems introduced by the mobility of the nodes.  The self-healing capability enables a routing based network to operate when one node breaks down or a connection goes bad. As a result, the network is typically quite reliable, as there is often more than one path between a source and a destination in the network. Although mostly used in wireless situations, this concept is also applicable to wired networks and software interaction.

I think calling your representative is extremely important but I do not think random pleas to call your rep is. My medium term goals are:   Link people to representatives to call. Starting at the state level and as we get commitment to the district level. My goal here is to get 100% representative awareness of the issue from their direct constituents.    1.part2. Id like to push every rep to put a stance on record on the issue and then target representatives not in favor for increased calling.    Expand into contacting local news agencies to push for stories onto net neutrality. Wether it be paper or tv with a focus on best bang for our buck. Reach out to site owners to see willingness to place banners. Or participate in blackouts. Focused campaigns across social media to keep net neutrality trending over the next 3 months.    I hope that's makes it clearer on why I was looking for people first. We can scale into individual markets as people join up. It doesn't have to be everywhere at once.

So not, ""The government won't do what we want, let's try something else,"" but, ""We need to put forth more effective efforts to get the government to do what we want""? Ok.  I take it that you'll be tracking voting records, legislation introduced, public statements, and other actions on key internet-related issues so that people can then move from calling their reps to deciding who to vote for (or against), and then voting when the election comes around?  To that end, are things like this useful, or this?  I had been using http://thomas.loc.gov/home/thomas.php , but that is going to be redirecting to http://congress.gov so you'd want to post links from there instead. Good place to get ahold of legislation.  So... you want individuals because your plan is more about organizing specific individuals who know and work with each other and can move a plan forward, rather than talking to random people day after day who know more or less about the issue at hand and who aren't necessarily working towards a specific project?

Pretty much Mr. Wheeler stated was, ""the line between you and Comcast and Netflix, will be unimpeded"",  then ffs if you like ""the brave new world"" or ""1984"" he stated the line between networks,  ""Netflix to Comcast"" or ""Netflix v 3rd party to you"" will be under other regulation.    What i got from his FCC speak (i watched all 2+hrs of it) was he was playing bullshit til it got to that.  Mr. Wheeler (i give the guy respect only because i want respect back), is a paid comcast lobbist, if you watched the 2+hrs of film he gave respect/dabs to every god damn person he knew.   Even if they gave him ""hard""/basic questions.  There is no private sector, when there is monoplies they shut locals down via local laws  (wireless megacity broadband),  this lead to Google to choose the remotest places to ""try"" their infrastructure.  This is something you should seriously research more.  Fiber wire is expensive but not that expensive when you are making 5bil+ on average.

The very fact they are not considered by definition a ""telecom"" service is pretty messed up.   Their whole thing is to produce telecommunications.   Via a wire or wireless transmission.  There are some in very very small precentages ""competetors"" but when you are asking for a beyond 70% market share after buying out the number two ISP, there is something wrong here.  The only way to make more growth is to open the regulations up.   Right now even Google cannot expand w/o buying off the regulators in different areas.

According to www.campaignmoney.com, and without digging any further than the first page of his donations because I don't have time for their vintage web design, David and Rhonda Cohen each gave the legal maximum personal contribution. David is listed as working as an Executive VP at Comcast, while Rhonda, who has also given to the Comcast Co. and NBCUniversal PAC was listed as a ""Homemaker"".

WarOnComcast,25pqon,aDDnTN,3,Fri May 16 18:48:32 2014 UTC,"As you may know, on December 21, 2010, the FCC adopted an Open Internet Order, better known as ""net neutrality,"" that imposed new federal regulations on the types of services Internet providers could sell.  Moreover, the Internet and online content have thrived in the United States without net neutrality regulations, which throws into question the need for more government intervention.   i know the internet existed before the 2010 OIO. but that order was made because the FCC found that the internet was becoming less open because of new behaviors from the ISPs (like throttling and blocking access to sites) required them to order them to do something that everyone assumed was implied or just part of them being an ISP.  so this gasbag is off his rocker, and basically states that the internet was good before net neutrality was forced on it, so it will be good after it is taken away.  Let's just leave out the fact that the growth of use during 2010-2014 was probably larger than the growth of the internet from 1974-2010.  So he's making the case that it's done just fine under net neutrality, so we don't need it.  IE, he's been bought and probably never understood the issues at hand.  time for anon to figure out what skeletons he's got in his closet, which ones he like to have access to daily, and then cut off the supply.  then we'll see how ""okay"" he is with a ""non-regulated"" internet."

Your state rep is simply stating he has no federal power because he is not a member of the federal government. Either way they can't force the cable companies to expand their coverage so people have more options to choose from. There are areas where I live where Comcast is the only option but in the more populated areas there tends to be more than one provider to choose from. Technically they are not a monopoly because nationally there are many options. The reason this happens is because whoever gets to that part of town first has already dominated the market. For competitors to come it they have to lay down  wire (which is expensive) and then try and recapture a market that has already established themselves with a provider. From a business standpoint, it just doesn't make sense for new companies to come into town. Essentially everyone gets comfy with where they are and they do just fine. No one is stopping new providers from entering the market but the other companies themselves."

WarOnComcast,25ovin,roo-ster,3,Fri May 16 09:41:03 2014 UTC,"Supremacy Clause:       The Supremacy Clause is the provision in Article Six, Clause 2 of the U.S. Constitution that establishes the U.S. Constitution, federal statutes, and U.S. treaties as ""the supreme law of the land"". It provides that these are the highest form of law in the U.S. legal system, and mandates that all state judges must follow federal law when a conflict arises between federal law and either the state constitution or state law of any state.  The supremacy of federal law over state law only applies if Congress is acting in pursuance of its constitutionally authorized powers.  Nullification is the legal theory that states have the right to nullify, or invalidate, federal laws which they view as being unconstitutional; or federal laws that they view as having exceeded Congressesâ constitutionally authorized powers. The Supreme Court has rejected nullification, finding that under Article III of the Constitution, the power to declare federal laws unconstitutional has been delegated to the federal courts and that states do not have the authority to nullify federal law.

For example, states and cities have long had the power to assign franchise agreements to cable operators (effectively carving out exclusive territories to avoid pesky competition).  And cables companies depend on municipally controlled assets to string cable, dig up streets, etc.  I'd like to see a state or city impose a net neutrality provision as a condition for any cable company using public rights of way, utility poles, cable vaults, inground conduits, etc.  Alternatively, they charge the provider a 'non-neutral access fee' which could be used to support public infrastructure for use by providers than offer neutral internet access.  There are lots of remedies that have yet to be explored."

What they actually voted for was to potentially regulate the market. Again, as it is today, because the courts knocked down existing regulation, currently there are no restrictions/regulations - and thus, deals like the one Netflix has with Comcast are fair and open game.  What happened at the FCC today was -- ""Look, we heard quite a few people getting upset (they really did say this, look up the transcript), and we're going to see if we can't draft some regulation based on comments from the public."" They could have proposed the aforementioned Title II regulation and voted for that, but that wasn't on the table. Maybe that's bad, maybe not.

WarOnComcast,25msfx,dougbdl,4,Thu May 15 18:56:45 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I generally agree with that."
WarOnComcast,25msfx,altCognito,5,Thu May 15 19:03:51 2014 UTC,"There are many steps we will have to take to prevent this from being an issue. They keep trying to push through unwanted legislation, we need to make sure that they can't do that. The biggest problem is corporatism (not to be confused with capitalism), and if we keep allowing money to leak into politics we will never be free or prosperous. We need to get big unions and corporations and other organizations out of government, but we also need to get government out of our business. It is a highly complex problem, and it is one that will not be resolved without some hard work on our part.   Personally, I do not believe we will ever succeed in solving this problem until we tear down the entire system and rebuild from the ground up. Think about how arduous the process of instigating change in our own government has become. Imagine trying to convert from our current system to a more free system. I would propose a monetarist system, more akin to what Milton Friedman had in mind, but others would disagree. Regardless, transitioning from one system to the other is bound to take decades if not centuries. And this is assuming that we stay the course.   People have a tendency to get distracted very quickly and easily. The only possible way that I can conceive of that might make this less painful and more plausible would be immediate legislation to reform lobbying and campaign finance.   I can see some room for lobbying as an honest practice, but presently it is used to bully people into supporting and enacting legislation that hurts other industries. Of course, we will face strong opposition. Every single large corporation or organization that benefits from lobbying will be lobbying against this legislation, but the most prudent issue is money in politics. We need to completely remove campaign finances. If people want to get to know the people they are voting for, then they should have a central place to learn about these people. A single website which would be required to list every candidate (no discrimination) and provide all of the information on them. Their stances on every issue, their experience, their voting history, affiliations, etc. There are many intricacies that will need to be worked out with this, such as deciding who writes the information and who manages the website, but I am proposing this as more of a base idea and not the final rendition.  Perhaps we should separate government elections from the same realm of freedom as our own. We need to address how to handle campaigning as a whole. Those with more money are bound to win. They can cover transportation costs, media appearances, marketing, lawyers, writers, etc. Less well-funded candidates stand no chance. This is the problem that needs to be addressed. If we can address this, it will solve many of our problems."

So: You want to stop laying wack-a-mole when it comes to net neutrality?  Guess what, you aren't alone, everyone who knows the tiniest thing about the issue does.  But it's not going to stop as long as we can only elect politicians who have a financial interest (through where their campaign donations come from) in following the agenda of the telecom companies and not the people.    The long-term solution is campaign finance reform.  We have to be pushing that as a bipartisian issue- the only one that will ultimately begin to give a say in politics back to the average Joe."

The easiest way to describe this would be:  today we all fight over the same 100% of bandwidth within the service provider network, how we each get our piece really boils down to a first in first out order.  tomorrow the service provider can take that 100% and portion off say 20% to people willing to pay additional money (not consumers at the moment but more content delivery providers)  thus that allows them to be classified and treated differently.  that leaves us the common users now in contention for the remaining 80% of bandwidth that is available.  there is alot more around this and it all has to do with how the verbiage is played and what can actually be done to the data inside of their networks."
