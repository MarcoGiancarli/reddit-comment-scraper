TrueDetective,3e30dk,BeanAlai,18,Tue Jul 21 15:52:49 2015 UTC,"What I got was that Frank told Ray he had info on his wife's rapist so Ray would go kill the man. It was just someone Frank wanted dead. Ray thought he killed his wife's rapist, and told her so. After this past episode she thought he was lying back when, but to his knowledge he wasn't. He's just realized Frank set him up. Probably to have a Vinci PD officer owing him favors."

TrueDetective,3e30dk,Lokillo40,-2,Tue Jul 21 16:19:26 2015 UTC,I dont know. Something seems off with Rays ex. Maybe she wasn't really raped. Maybe she participated in the sex parties. The kid looks like it could be Ani's fathers. Just something fishy going on there with Ray's ex.

I can't help but notice how much information there is for a show that has had only 5 episodes. For me, this season has been very confusing and convoluted so this type of post really helps. I also like that it sticks to known facts and reasonable suspicion as closely as possible - when you start adding in all the crazy theories and random speculation it complicates things even further and just muddies the water (although those theories and the speculation can be fun too)."

Maybe he wants all his stuff back, so what better way to do, he kills caspere, gives himself a reason to start all this shit again, get his stuff back from the mexicans, that's when stan finds out so he kills him too. And when Collin Farrells character (man I should learn the names) goes to the casperes 2nd house, Vince is there collecting the hard-drive when he shows up. So he quickly puts on the mask and takes him out with that shotgun, bb gun thing, I mean they're still friends right? Vince just acts like he's in tons of shit when really he just wants his shit back because lets face it, being legit after that must be boring as fuck.

TrueDetective,3e30dk,MissPoodle,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:05:55 2015 UTC,Looks like he is about to torture people in search of the hard drive in Ep6. He would just wait it out a couple days and hand over the hard drive to the Catalyst guy if he already had it in his possession.
TrueDetective,3e30dk,KingLittlefinger,6,Tue Jul 21 21:12:24 2015 UTC,"One small detail that doesn't really change a lot.  I don't think we know for sure that Blake is involved with Osip yet.  Ray tails Blake to Pitlor's, and then tails Chessani's Escalade to Osip, and after re-watching the scene , I never saw Blake present at the exchange between Tony and Osip.  However, Blake is definitely in the scene from next week's preview standing in front of Ani as she's about to go into the sex party along with a couple other girls.  So he's definitely involved with the Chessani's/sex parties, but unconfirmed he's involved with Osip directly.    If that's completely wrong and I missed something please let me know though lol.  I'm actually developing a theory that Tony Chessani is preparing to make a move for power against his father, and that Mayor Chessani may just be your typical corrupt politician and not necessarily involved in all the darker stuff that Caspere and his son are/were involved in."
TrueDetective,3e30dk,JoeCoug5,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:08:35 2015 UTC,"You may be right, but I could of sworn that he was at the women exchange.  I am sure someone else will come in and let us know.  I don't have screenshots from the scene myself.  I think you are absolutely right about the last portion, in fact Piltor says he was not involved in any of that."
TrueDetective,3e30dk,m_walusi,3,Tue Jul 21 17:35:06 2015 UTC,"I will confirm what /u/KingLittlefinger said about Blake and Osip.  There are two scenes close together which involve Pitlor, Chessani, Osip, and Blake.  In the first, Velcoro follows Blake's sedan to what I presume is Pitlor's mansion.  Tony Chessani's white SUV was already in the driveway.  We see both men exit the car and greet each other warmly, followed shortly by them greeting Pitlor, who was there with the girls.  At the end of this first scene, the girls load in to Chessani's SUV.  In the second scene Velcoro decides to follow Chessani's SUV rather than continuing to follow Blake.  We see Chessani arrive and meet Osip, who then inspects the girls.  Neither Pitlor nor Blake were present during this scene and presumably neither was there.  So we still don't have a direct link between Osip and either Blake or Pitlor.  Clearly both Blake and Pitlor knew that Chessani was taking the girls somewhere, but we don't know if they are aware of the fact that Osip is the guy on the other side of the transaction."

I'm beginning to get afraid that a lot of the clues we note are simply plot devices written as coincidences.  Pizz simply needed a way for Velcoro/the audience to confirm that Blake was going behind Frank's back, so he writes a pointless scene where he leads Ray straight to a meet up and doesn't see him follow him into the driveway?  I hope not."
TrueDetective,3e30dk,PoochieTheRockingDog,2,Tue Jul 21 20:55:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, from what we see Blake adds literally nothing to the transaction.  But we don't know what happened after the scene cut, nothing shows Blake leaving.  Maybe Blake is the money guy that pays Pitlor for the girls after Chessani takes them?  Either way, we know he's gone by the time Velcoro returns to beat the bejeezus out of Pitlor.  Or, more likely, it was a hamhanded way to show that Blake was involved with Pitlor and Chessani behind Frank's back.  edit: Actually now that I think about it, it's likely that Blake was the guy that originally delivered the girls to Pitlor.  He could be there just to ensure their arrival (they are traveling with suitcases) and to ""inspect the merchandise"" to make sure they are what he expected.  Where is Blake sourcing the girls?"

TrueDetective,3e30dk,corundum9,3,Tue Jul 21 21:39:26 2015 UTC,"Are you sure there was a hard drive in the hollywood bungalow? I only saw a modem and a camera. If I'm right, it would explain why Caspere's house was torn up. Velcoro or Dixon also said that the hard drive was missing, when they were investigating Caspere's trashed house in episode 1.   Great read. I would suggest adding another section, people with motive. Birdman could be acting for someone else. McCandless has motive - the footage, The state senator has motive - the footage, Geldof - possible, but i wonder if his sudden entry into the govenor race could just come down to him being corrupt and whitewashing the events of Vinci, Blake - he worked for Frank and knew, I assume, that Frank had given Caspere 5 million in cash, Elliot Bezeredes - no motive yet, but he is suspicious - though if you want a possible motive, he may have actually known Vera, who went missing - though I'd put money that he has a much larger motive. Theres also something about those diamonds - which i have to assume plays a larger role in the motive, but that s just a hunch.  lastly, and this is just an observation, not related to the motives, but I noticed in one of the photos that Ani was given, the state senator is shaking hands with an old man who is flanked by two women. The photo looks like the senator is treating this man as very important. He might be the mayor's father. This may mean that he is playing a much larger role in events - but that is totally conjecture."
TrueDetective,3e30dk,venomsentinel,2,Tue Jul 21 17:27:06 2015 UTC,"For your first point - I believe Ray himself says there was a camera and a hard drive there before he got shot. I could be wrong, it did look like a modem, but I a believe that was the hard drive.   Second Point - That is a good idea, I will see what I can do with the outline you provided.  Third - That photo (i still need the link of those photos she got) is the guy mentioned in the Sex Party Crew section, Ani looks him up on the computer.  Isn't that what you are talking about?

TrueDetective,3e14w2,ForeverUnclean,8,Tue Jul 21 04:26:13 2015 UTC,The guy farted enough to be described by someone he just met as flatulent.  What a first impression.
TrueDetective,3e14w2,antisquarespace,3,Tue Jul 21 13:09:41 2015 UTC,"I think it only takes one, if that one is especially smelly."
TrueDetective,3e14w2,Chewblacka,4,Tue Jul 21 14:38:36 2015 UTC,I feel like the flatulence was germane to the plot line
TrueDetective,3e14w2,NeonSignsRain,6,Tue Jul 21 10:38:20 2015 UTC,"Pizzolatto furiously rewriting final three episodes to include the word ""germane"""
TrueDetective,3e14w2,SgtHennessy,3,Tue Jul 21 13:40:30 2015 UTC,That was a great use of germane.
TrueDetective,3e14w2,rosemaryintheforest,2,Tue Jul 21 11:54:13 2015 UTC,"Yes... a laugh. People said this season lacked sense of humour. It's just different. It's like unexpected.  I Really Had A Hard Time trying to guess to whom he was referring to.  A toast to Ticky Teague, sipping bourbon in Hell."
TrueDetective,3e14w2,NeonSignsRain,3,Tue Jul 21 10:51:42 2015 UTC,I knew as soon as the guy said a detective brought pictures in before. Who else would it have been?

TrueDetective,3dxtug,edyer12,189,Mon Jul 20 12:36:37 2015 UTC,It's good and I enjoy it every week but last season is still better imo
TrueDetective,3dxtug,Jezamiah,130,Mon Jul 20 14:43:24 2015 UTC,Rust Cohle is one of the greatest television characters... ever. You've got to set some reasonable expectations.   I think if the show makes it through 4 or 5 seasons it will be easier to appreciate the differences between them.
TrueDetective,3dxtug,welcome_to_miami,54,Mon Jul 20 16:12:11 2015 UTC,"agreed. there was no way season 2 was ever gonna be as good as season 1, just by virtue of how good season 1 was.  doesn't mean season 2 isn't great TV."
TrueDetective,3dxtug,SeigneurHellier,23,Mon Jul 20 18:49:00 2015 UTC,"I've been thinking about this a lot. If this season was the first season of True Detective, I guarantee people would like it more. Last season the show was just very different than what was on TV.   But now that a precedent for gritty detective shows with big movie stars has been set, it takes a lot more to impress people. I'm loving this season though."
TrueDetective,3dxtug,BryLoW,7,Mon Jul 20 22:00:57 2015 UTC,"Nothing is gonna beat season 1's storytelling method and it would feel disingenuous to try to repeat it. I think that's really what made it so great, telling it all through flashbacks."
TrueDetective,3dxtug,AllYourFearsAreLies,17,Tue Jul 21 00:02:20 2015 UTC,I heard Nic Pizzallato say that he is only going to do 3 seasons since it requires so much work to build from scratch between seasons.
TrueDetective,3dxtug,romafa,30,Mon Jul 20 18:57:56 2015 UTC,"I hope he means that. Three is a strong number. It would also help keep the show from becoming completely ridiculous and running out of steam. Three seasons of epic television (each with its own complete story, no less) is better than 7 seasons where each season gets progressively worse."
TrueDetective,3dxtug,Justice-Guy,13,Mon Jul 20 20:57:12 2015 UTC,"Or conversely someone else takes it over. The anthology format could benefit just as much from new writers as it does actors, directors and locations. Another big difference this season is multiple directors. I guess personal differences precluded Cary Fukunaga from coming back, but I'd love to see a return to the one writer/one director format in the future. The consistent visual tone of season 1 was a huge contributor to its success."
TrueDetective,3dxtug,FasterDoudle,8,Mon Jul 20 22:07:36 2015 UTC,"Frankly I would even take another 3-4 seasons of Season 2 quality. I still think Vince Vaughn was kind of miscast for this season but Farrell, McAdams and Kitsch have been dynamite. The dialogue and pacing could use some work but if you could find another writer/director combo that could bring a unique and consistent vision that would still be great TV. I also like the idea of getting some big name Hollywood actors to come in. I think if they went back to the two detective format it would serve the story better. Helps make the narrative tighter and allows them to play off each other's strengths and weaknesses more. Kitsch's story has been kind of interesting but it's left me a little apoplectic when I know that we could have gotten more development from Velcoro and Ani's characters."
TrueDetective,3dxtug,WhatJonSnuhKnows,2,Mon Jul 20 23:23:13 2015 UTC,"Yes, Vince Vaughan is so out of his element in this, even the bit players look like they feel bad for him."
TrueDetective,3dxtug,ifeellikeimflying,49,Tue Jul 21 05:26:29 2015 UTC,"Season 1 was amazing, I'm not a fan of detective cop shows but season1 had me seriously wondering who is killing these people? Kidnapping children and forcing them to be sex slaves? Who is this crazy cult? And I was really interested in finding the bad guy.   This season I don't know who we are looking for, the person that killed Casper? I don't even care about Casper. Who shot Ray? Sure I'm interested but no way am I as involved as the first season."
TrueDetective,3dxtug,Full_Metal_Packet,21,Mon Jul 20 16:11:59 2015 UTC,"This season I don't know who we are looking for, the person that killed Casper? I don't even care about Casper. Who shot Ray? Sure I'm interested but no way am I as involved as the first season.   I completely agree with this. The first episode seemed like it was going to be setting it up to find someone who killed this guy in a pretty brutal way but then that just kind of fizzled out. I love watching Collin Farrel do his thing but it just kind of seems like there is a bunch of not so interesting stuff going on. The shootout was cool but I'm not even sure what the point of it was. I'm still really enjoying the show though."
TrueDetective,3dxtug,bobthebobofbob,7,Mon Jul 20 23:32:20 2015 UTC,"This. Just that opening scene with the ritualistic murder scene drew in the audience with immense suspense that this season hasn't been able to do. Not to mention the characters, the dialogue, the cinematography, it was all just excellent. I really don't think this season is in any way on par with the last."
TrueDetective,3dxtug,breathethisair,2,Mon Jul 20 19:26:10 2015 UTC,"I think last season took you down such a deep rabbit hole you never saw coming and when you thought it couldn't get more twisted it did. You were cheering for the cops to do the wrong thing to get at these people. It flipped thr script into a word where there was so much wrong that you didn't care about right anymore, just less morally wrong than the alternative. When the season ended, there we still so many unanswered questions from little bread crumbs sprinkled throughout the season.   I feel like this season just doesn't have as deep a rabbit hole to go into, but on the bright side, I think we will be left with less questions at the end. It is also a less horrible story in terms of being demented. I know it is worse than most, but last season was something I don't know if they will ever go back to in this series.   I am however starting to wonder if there will be this underlying theme that ties every individual story together of an even group of rich elitists and true detective through thr seasons will show how it is all torn down throughout the country."
TrueDetective,3dxtug,Lazarous86,74,Tue Jul 21 03:37:44 2015 UTC,"This was hands down the strongest episode of the season. The seeming complexity and scope of the conspiracy became much more clearer and defined, and all the characters shined, including Paul.  Ray beating the shit out of the doc was one hell of a scene, and I really think a recurring theme of True Detective is how these ""good guys"" have to resort to their seemingly criminal side to solve cases, i.e Rust breaking into Tuttle house, intimidating Geraci, etc."
TrueDetective,3dxtug,Ryduce22,37,Mon Jul 20 13:42:10 2015 UTC,When he started picking out teeth while talking to Ray... Fuck man.
TrueDetective,3dxtug,Da3dalus42,31,Mon Jul 20 17:20:34 2015 UTC,"or how he acts as if he's not even taking him serious, and starts throwing 50-dollar-words... at Ray..."
TrueDetective,3dxtug,foll-trood,30,Mon Jul 20 18:27:20 2015 UTC,Right? That guy sure had some gall to act like Ray was still playing it by the books when he barged into his office wearing leather gloves and wielding a billy club. I'd have been shitting my pants.
TrueDetective,3dxtug,starmandelux,15,Mon Jul 20 18:43:26 2015 UTC,"To be fair, he probably has no idea who Ray is, and that Ray is no longer an official cop. And, being part of a cushy, powerful conspiracy probably has hidden him from the nasty things of life.   But as soon as Ray took off his coat, and I saw the gloves, my own flight instinct started to kick in."
TrueDetective,3dxtug,Justice-Guy,16,Mon Jul 20 20:59:18 2015 UTC,I know. I thought he was gonna skullfuck my father with my mom's headless corpse right here on my lawn.

TrueDetective,3dxtug,latarian,5,Mon Jul 20 20:16:37 2015 UTC,The world needs bad men....we keep the other bad men from the door.
TrueDetective,3dxtug,Lamp_in_dark,85,Tue Jul 21 02:42:09 2015 UTC,"It's not bad, but I wish Cory Fukunaga would've been onboard. Last night was awesome, but looking at those first four episodes... I think it takes a certain kind of director to really make this material shine."
TrueDetective,3dxtug,Jig86,33,Mon Jul 20 13:01:16 2015 UTC,He really was the perfect director for it. And just about every ep is a different director. I feel like it helps everything just to have the consistency.
TrueDetective,3dxtug,So_Many_Dicks,18,Mon Jul 20 13:54:29 2015 UTC,"All of the great TV shows have different directors almost every single episode. Breaking bad, Sopranos, Mad Men, The Wire, etc etc. So it's ok to have someone new at the helm of each episode and still make great TV!"
TrueDetective,3dxtug,3th0s,3,Mon Jul 20 17:34:35 2015 UTC,Yeah I know. I just think it would be cool to have been done that way. And surely it would help with the actors some. At least I think it would.
TrueDetective,3dxtug,So_Many_Dicks,20,Mon Jul 20 17:58:08 2015 UTC,"The prior episode made me realize how much the show misses him. The scene where they are on the film set totally kicks off like a clip from Law and Order, with the shot set on the guy climbing the hill while playing the audio from the detectives interviewing the producer. Still, I'm digging this season, and with the exception of the force fed lines from Frank it's been pretty on par with the last."
TrueDetective,3dxtug,dead_cats_everywhere,2,Mon Jul 20 15:27:15 2015 UTC,You have any idea how hard it is to direct 500 pages of Television by yourself?
TrueDetective,3dxtug,Ferocious_Fury,3,Mon Jul 20 19:26:09 2015 UTC,"that's funny, last week I said that I thought the problem was the director, and I was accused of watching the wrong show...which was kinda baffling. I do think the director made a huge difference, especially in terms of dialog pacing consistency between actors. Some of the actors (I'm looking at you, Vince Vaughn) appear to be imitating the style of last season as opposed to embodying a character."
TrueDetective,3dxtug,fractalfay,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:33:47 2015 UTC,Absolutely agree.
TrueDetective,3dxtug,Gonko1,14,Mon Jul 20 23:35:42 2015 UTC,"I don't know if it seems as obvious to anyone else but Ani's family most likely has some involvement with this sex cult. The foreshadowing with her father and the tid bits spilled by the shrink pretty much lead to this direction. Who knows what kind of fucked up shit is going on with that family.   Makes you think considering that Paul's mother was a dancer who got pregnant. Who's to say that she wasn't also at these sex parties at one point. The show could take a big fucking turn that is for sure. Its definitely building to something, how big and complicated is anybody's guess. Season one got a lot simpler in the last episode, so who knows."
TrueDetective,3dxtug,binkles,90,Mon Jul 20 17:55:43 2015 UTC,"I love it.  I adored season one, but never wanted a carbon copy of it for season two. I wanted a new, fresh, interesting spin on the 'detective story'. That's what the series is about, right? The true detectives, those completely committed to their job and the truth.  It'd be far too easy to have eight episodes of Rust doing weird shit, and we'd love it. Being so different from the first is brave, and I still think is excellent TV.   Our standards are so high, also. TD S2 is better than pretty much everything on TV right now."
TrueDetective,3dxtug,outline01,26,Mon Jul 20 13:11:22 2015 UTC,Mr. Robot is also really fucking good.
TrueDetective,3dxtug,Useless_Throwpillow,22,Mon Jul 20 15:38:41 2015 UTC,Excluding Hannibal which is killing it but will sadly be cancelled after this season.
TrueDetective,3dxtug,thetacobellvampire,13,Mon Jul 20 14:01:35 2015 UTC,ohhhh man Hannibal is so good
TrueDetective,3dxtug,meinkush,3,Mon Jul 20 15:13:17 2015 UTC,"He gave them a rare gift, but NBC did not want it.."
TrueDetective,3dxtug,Relapsegalore,7,Tue Jul 21 05:14:15 2015 UTC,I think Hannibal is better than TD S2
TrueDetective,3dxtug,dqingqong,16,Mon Jul 20 17:59:26 2015 UTC,"It's actually a damn good season, but it took a little longer to warm up. Only now are the major themes starting to fall into place: children, lineage, how life can continue in the midst of moral and physical devastation, how life that is not properly nurtured goes awry, inter-family conflict, and lastly of course how you cannot escape your past. Furthermore, maybe I'm imagining things but I'm starting to understand why there is such a large cast. Each person has a 'mirror' : e.g. the VV and CF characters.  I'm not sure it's quite as good as season 1 (and in any event it's still too soon to tell) but it's still one of the most intelligently written and acted series on television."
TrueDetective,3dxtug,pimpbot,16,Mon Jul 20 14:52:14 2015 UTC,"When you are have only eight episodes , its really poor that it takes four episodes to ""warm up""."
TrueDetective,3dxtug,NAFI_S,11,Mon Jul 20 16:38:33 2015 UTC,It's safe to say our opinions differ. While I'm not saying that it couldn't have been improved upon there is something to be said for deliberate pacing and a slow burn. Instant gratification is not why I watch True Detective.
TrueDetective,3dxtug,pimpbot,8,Mon Jul 20 17:13:33 2015 UTC,"""Slow Burn"" alert.  Whenever I see someone use that phrase it's in the context of them explaining to almost everyone else that no, this show isn't poorly written and paced, you are just watching it wrong."
TrueDetective,3dxtug,JJFreds,13,Mon Jul 20 18:31:26 2015 UTC,Huh? Or that just means the pace of True Detective is slower than most shows because of all the details thrown in. Same was true with season 1.
TrueDetective,3dxtug,folettary,6,Mon Jul 20 19:15:19 2015 UTC,"Well, maybe you are watching it wrong."
TrueDetective,3dxtug,starmandelux,6,Mon Jul 20 18:45:41 2015 UTC,"Funny you say that. I work with a guy who has been telling me The Walking Dead has been slow burn for the majority of it's run, whereas I think it's just kind of a shitty show."
TrueDetective,3dxtug,DanzigMeowMeow,5,Mon Jul 20 21:30:45 2015 UTC,"Disagree. Also, if you go back and rewatch the first episodes, I think you'd find them more enjoyable since you know what's going on."
TrueDetective,3dxtug,TrynnaFindaBalance,7,Mon Jul 20 21:11:06 2015 UTC,Well I certainly love the show - maybe doesn't have the 'sense' of supernatural menace that season one had...But I think Farrell's peformance is easily my favourite out of both seasons...His work last night was Emmy worthy...
TrueDetective,3dxtug,SJA74,7,Mon Jul 20 19:31:36 2015 UTC,I can confidently tell you that you are not the only one.
TrueDetective,3dxtug,ElectricMarmalade,198,Mon Jul 20 22:18:50 2015 UTC,"Call me nuts, but I actually like it better. I felt Season 1 was stronger in the early episodes but faltered somewhat in the end. This season feels more patient and deliberate. The close, IMO, will be much better."
TrueDetective,3dxtug,The_DarkOne,55,Mon Jul 20 12:49:27 2015 UTC,I was discussing this with a friend. What really made S1 so strong for me was throwing the weight of the show behind the two leads.  The attention to character really made the story a bit inconsequential to me. They could have been driving to go get ice cream and I would have been just as engrossed.  (The story was weird and good and made me feel things)  The thing with S2 that I think may end up making it better story wise  (not necessarily character wise) is that it seems to have more of a goal in mind than S1. Each week we're seeing more of the puzzle being assembled and it seems to be getting clearer as to what the end game is.  S1 felt like a character study to me. S2 feels like a conspiracy-noir-slowburn story and I love it.
TrueDetective,3dxtug,russketeer34,9,Mon Jul 20 13:57:24 2015 UTC,"Imo, the story and characters were an equal part of S1.  It was only after the lackluster ending that didn't solve the expansive mystery or really even care to address it that people started saying it was a character study."
TrueDetective,3dxtug,Amerikaner,81,Mon Jul 20 17:28:36 2015 UTC,"The writing is more consistent. Already, we're starting to see that a SPOILER this time around. That's not even mentioning the foreshadowing and callbacks to things we've seen or heard of before. (The dialogue is debatable for some folks, though I mostly like it.)  It's amazing how people say S2 fails compared to S1 ... and they don't make any mention of the latter's ending. ""Form and Void"" pissed off the internet for weeks. You could not talk about it without people acting like Pizzolatto took a dump in their coffee.  Then S2 comes out and S1 is canonized. Okay.  Edit: added an ""is"" Edit 2: missed the first letter on ""dialogue""; classy"
TrueDetective,3dxtug,i_bite_right,83,Mon Jul 20 13:34:24 2015 UTC,I loved the ending of S1. Rust and Marty busting open that conspiracy so many years later would have just been completely unrealistic. They flushed out the local aspect of it that still remained and took care of the current killer and man who was being used to supposedly manipulate/capture victims when it was all actually up and running. It was enough to fulfill their end of it. But the point was that the larger conspiracy had moved on. And it's just not realistic that these two guys are going to save the world. And that was reflected by Rust and Marty's final conversation in the end as well.
TrueDetective,3dxtug,nightpanda893,23,Mon Jul 20 16:37:46 2015 UTC,"Great points, all, and they're reasons I liked the ending too. The ending is actually a lot darker than it first seems. Marty and Rust catch but one criminal in a great, interconnected web of criminality. And that was only because the guy doing it was unhinged enough to replicate the acts of his brethren in the open.  The ending was straight up foreshadowed too: ""This is a world where nothing is solved."""
TrueDetective,3dxtug,i_bite_right,9,Mon Jul 20 16:47:38 2015 UTC,"I don't understand how you could not like the ending, Rust's final speech at the end, was so incredibly life affirming ,that I couldn't help but take a step outside and stare at the stars."
TrueDetective,3dxtug,zombiezs,12,Tue Jul 21 03:31:09 2015 UTC,The ending of S1 was great. The problem is people got so used to fucking twists and shocking moments. They expected something from Game of Thrones where everyone dies and the Yellow King is revealed to be Marty or something. Instead they got a deep and interesting conclusion to the story that ties together everything about the main characters. I have only admiration for that.
TrueDetective,3dxtug,LlamaTheBountyHunter,26,Mon Jul 20 23:11:26 2015 UTC,"Wait, why was form the void so poorly received? i thought it was awesome. I wasn't on reddit at that time, so maybe I missed the internet being pissed."
TrueDetective,3dxtug,biggbad18,24,Mon Jul 20 14:39:54 2015 UTC,The way S1 shook out left some people cold. They didn't like who the killer was or what happened to Rust at the end or the fact that red herrings don't pan out.  The reviewers weren't nearly as bad about it as some of the fans were; comment sections on any article were a wasteland.
TrueDetective,3dxtug,i_bite_right,20,Mon Jul 20 14:51:05 2015 UTC,"I was off reddit when that came around so I missed out on that. I was satisfied with the ending personally. Who else would the bad guy have been? Like, it was a perfect fit in my opinion."
TrueDetective,3dxtug,rack_em_willie,5,Mon Jul 20 15:01:29 2015 UTC,"less about who the bad guy was than him not being a fully developed character representing a coherent idea, i think."
TrueDetective,3dxtug,jakerie,10,Mon Jul 20 16:57:23 2015 UTC,"People were really into the supernatural/goth theme stuff that was going on and we're hoping for some yellow king ghoul to appear.  I won't lie, I was hoping for that also, but I have no gripes with the way it ended. The show was about the characters of Rust and Marty first and foremost."

TrueDetective,3dxtug,Lambchops_Legion,2,Mon Jul 20 17:50:02 2015 UTC,"I think between the plagiarism accusations and the infamous Vanity Fair piece, a lot of critics went into S2 wanting to find mistakes. And so they have."
TrueDetective,3dxtug,i_bite_right,2,Mon Jul 20 18:18:18 2015 UTC,What was controversial about the Vanity Fair piece? And what plagiarism? Didn't really follow the show until it got on the air
TrueDetective,3dxtug,cristopherdolan,9,Tue Jul 21 00:17:20 2015 UTC,"It was actually received perfectly well here. In this subreddit anyway. I remember being disappointed in the last couple of episodes and not really being able to talk about that here because anyone who did was just downvoted en masse.

I really like it too, and I feel like I'm in the minority. I think it's a lot better when the show is viewed through the lens of ""stylized noir"" as opposed to ""realistic crime drama"" which I feel is almost the exact opposite of last season, but maybe that's just me."
TrueDetective,3dxtug,Lambchops_Legion,4,Mon Jul 20 17:49:05 2015 UTC,"""Stylized noir"" is an apt description for the dialogue, and it makes me itch for a S3 set in the late 1940s. It also seems to be one of Pizzolatto's creative signatures."
TrueDetective,3dxtug,i_bite_right,2,Mon Jul 20 18:06:03 2015 UTC,"That's an excellent way to say it. Pizzolatto used to be a professor of literature. It's a lot like Tarantino taking all of the elements of grindhouse cinema and making them work: Pizzolatto is taking noir tropes and writing complex, flowery, dialogue and symbol-laden plots. This is thinking-man's noir."

TrueDetective,3dxtug,nonliteral,6,Mon Jul 20 14:14:33 2015 UTC,"lol, no. It's just not as good. The acting, plot, dialogue, and directing are just not as good. The first season set the bar very high.

TrueDetective,3dxtug,avidman,4,Mon Jul 20 23:42:00 2015 UTC,"It just has so much more going on this season as far as subplots go. There wasn't much substance outside of Marty's fucked up family and Rust being a ""lonestar"", you know? We just have so much more to go off of with this season"
TrueDetective,3dxtug,rack_em_willie,3,Mon Jul 20 15:02:31 2015 UTC,"I feel the same way. It's more ambitious and does better work with its characters. Frank is the weak link as far as they go, but the entire cast is doing a great job. And so far, the only episode that I felt had really subpar direction was the fourth.  It's gloriously pulpy, bizarre, and ridiculous. And I wouldn't want it any other way."
TrueDetective,3dxtug,r4rtrekintodarkness,3,Mon Jul 20 14:28:39 2015 UTC,"I like it better as well.   I'll be the cheese that stands alone, but I actively didn't like Season 1. I thought there was way too much existential pontification from Rust, and the plotline with Marty's wife bored me to tears. I also hated Marty as a character. He was completely useless through most of the series. The only thing he contributed was putting 2+2 together about the green paint/green monster. There were so many red herrings throughout (Reggie LeDoux, ugh), that felt like enormous time sucks. I thought the overall plot was interesting and I loved the setting, but it felt like a movie stretched out over 8 hours. I think they could have really tightened things up.   This season feels much larger in scope. I like having a larger main cast, as it gives more opportunities for different pairings and conversations (rather than just Rust and Marty in a car) and perspectives. And I like that these detectives are actively investigating the larger conspiracy, and seem to have a shot at taking it down. Season 1 seemed so futile, whereas this investigation seems deeper and more legitimate."
TrueDetective,3dxtug,ragnarockette,5,Mon Jul 20 14:54:01 2015 UTC,I thought Marty's usefulness was his networking within the police force. Rust was too cynical to be anyone's friend but there were times when they need Marty's connections.
TrueDetective,3dxtug,seekunrustlement,2,Mon Jul 20 19:12:31 2015 UTC,"It's much stronger. Less reliant on the spiritual voodoo of the first. Not to say I don't absolutely love a bit of southern eeriness when it's done well (James Lee Burke, Angelheart etc) but my absolute favourites of the genre are the hardboiled L.A. noir works of Ellroy, Michael Mann and so forth. Pizzolatto just seems talented enough to deliver both.  On top of that, I think McAdams and Farrell are just in top form. Vince Vaughan is occassionally great but inconsistent."
TrueDetective,3dxtug,avidman,0,Mon Jul 20 23:39:53 2015 UTC,"I definitely wouldn;t say its better, at least not yet. It really is picking up steam and i'm desperate for more episodes. Few really defining moments in season 1 that definitely have not been bettered yet."
TrueDetective,3dxtug,Flying_Scot,14,Mon Jul 20 21:07:47 2015 UTC,"I am definitely enjoying this season as much if not more than the first. It's annoying to compare the first and second since it is such a departure, however similar they seem. I think this season seemed slower in the beginning but now it's clear that it was carefully laying a foundation for what I feel will be a great payoff. I also feel this is a more ambitious season, being that it is awfully convenient story telling to have your character stare into the camera and deliver exposition for the first 8 episodes like last time. Also the fact that we knew last season that something happens all these years later after the case was and easy plot.   This season is standing alone and I think it measures up great."
TrueDetective,3dxtug,androidlexembomb,12,Mon Jul 20 14:35:24 2015 UTC,I'm enjoying this season as much as I enjoyed the last season.
TrueDetective,3dxtug,TheBroodyCalibrator,6,Mon Jul 20 17:57:50 2015 UTC,"I find this season ""good"" and the first ""amazing."""
TrueDetective,3dxtug,rdz1986,19,Mon Jul 20 16:51:05 2015 UTC,No you aren't the only one. I think it's just as good. I'm way into it. Last night's episode was the best one of the season so far.
TrueDetective,3dxtug,thedreamcomparison,7,Mon Jul 20 12:56:55 2015 UTC,Yeah this season is the shit. All the conspiracies that have gone along with it and the occult themes are blowing my mind. Especially since it takes place in CA and is right in my backyard makes the experience that much richer.
TrueDetective,3dxtug,CalmerThanYouAreDood,17,Mon Jul 20 15:25:58 2015 UTC,"here's the thing.  if season 2 comes out first, it's hailed as complex, dark, unrelenting, and intelligent.  if then season one comes out after two, it comes across as gimmicky, simple, and exploiting the occult and taboo sex as a means of using shock value to replace writing.    i may be off base, but i think it's interesting to try and figure out how season one would be reviewed if it came out second, and i think it does come across as a more sensationlized and dumbed down story if their release order is flipped."
TrueDetective,3dxtug,runningthefamily,6,Mon Jul 20 20:03:15 2015 UTC,Best point so far
TrueDetective,3dxtug,Clivepwnens,3,Mon Jul 20 20:34:59 2015 UTC,"I haven't seen season 1 yet. I tried watching it, having seen all the episodes of s2 so far, but I had trouble getting into it. I like the setting and characters in s2 better. Although I probably will watch s1 and pay much closer attention to it after s2 ends."
TrueDetective,3dxtug,TrynnaFindaBalance,11,Mon Jul 20 21:05:56 2015 UTC,"I like this season more.   And now gotta wait a week till next episode... It's like blue balls, in your heart."
TrueDetective,3dxtug,luaudesign,3,Mon Jul 20 16:47:42 2015 UTC,I haven't been cliffhanger'ed so bad since To'hajiilee.
TrueDetective,3dxtug,thatguywiththe______,7,Tue Jul 21 03:08:56 2015 UTC,"No, I'm enjoying it as much, though for different reasons than season 1. I feel like the mystery is more intriguing and complex this season."
TrueDetective,3dxtug,Eiyran,6,Mon Jul 20 13:57:13 2015 UTC,"It's on par for sure. Storylines are somewhat the same where they're working a case. They get into a gunfight (""gunfight"" for Season 1) and end up with no one in custody. Moves forward in time. Everyone is disbanded but now are trying to do their own investigation to find out what really is going on. A lot of similarities but Season 2 has so many other storylines going on that are just as gripping. Season 1 just had Marty being a drunk cheater with a messed up family and Rust who was off his rocker and obsessed with this unsolved case. I'd like to say Season 2 is better"
TrueDetective,3dxtug,rack_em_willie,3,Mon Jul 20 15:00:02 2015 UTC,"I'm enjoying it a lot, but went in feeling last season was the best season of TV I've ever watched, so I had lower expectations going in. I think the show is spectacular but slightly less so than last season."
TrueDetective,3dxtug,dunterdunt,3,Mon Jul 20 15:00:18 2015 UTC,I like them both for different reasons.  Both of these took four or five episodes to really have me salivating for more story.
TrueDetective,3dxtug,daddybubbles,3,Mon Jul 20 15:07:24 2015 UTC,Does anyone know what the bludgeoning device Velcoro uses on the Doctor was?
TrueDetective,3dxtug,beefox,4,Mon Jul 20 15:16:52 2015 UTC,"I assumed he was going old school and brought a blackjack with him. It was dark, though; so I couldn't really make it out."
TrueDetective,3dxtug,Telodzrum,2,Mon Jul 20 16:37:45 2015 UTC,"Yes, as you and /u/ism-ist pointed out it does indeed appear to be some form of a blackjack.  Never knew of such a thing until this episode."
TrueDetective,3dxtug,beefox,2,Tue Jul 21 15:56:29 2015 UTC,"Was wondering the same thing.   At first I thought it looked like a miniature curling stick or something. Now I'm thinking it might have been a leather ""slapper"" King of an an oblong, semi stiff baton of leather with two pieces of lead sewn inside either end. The larger of the two lead weights plays the business end. That's my best guess.  http://www.amazon.com/Slapper-Black-Leather-11-Equipment/dp/B0007VBSQW"
TrueDetective,3dxtug,ism-ist,3,Mon Jul 20 19:23:52 2015 UTC,"It's picking up steam for me. Right now, I still like season 1 better, but I guess we still have 3 episodes."
TrueDetective,3dxtug,Brewha88,3,Mon Jul 20 17:27:43 2015 UTC,I'm starting to really enjoy this season. It's very L.A./CA hardboiled crime drama -- which is what I was hoping for really -- and seeing Velcro beat the shit out of Rick Springfield was icing on the ugly underbelly cake.
TrueDetective,3dxtug,monsterlynn,3,Mon Jul 20 18:16:15 2015 UTC,"I can appreciate how deep the writing is on this season, but as a viewer, it gets a bit tiring when there are periods of 20-30 minutes of virtually no plot development.   The beginning of this series was so disorientating and difficult to follow. Without this sub, I would be pretty lost on the story unless I went through each episode with a 2nd or 3rd watch, which is something I don't want to do.  Another reason I haven't liked this season as much is the casting of Vince Vaughn as well. He plays a big role in the show and I am just unconvinced of his character. Every one else, I see the character first, and then I see the actor. With Vince, I see him first, then I have to convince myself that he's ""Frank."""
TrueDetective,3dxtug,kukukele,4,Mon Jul 20 19:15:37 2015 UTC,It's a great season. Lot's of haters.. but they are woefully misguided.. it will be one of those things where people will eventually catch on to how great it is. haters tho.. they are a goddamn blight.
TrueDetective,3dxtug,CosmicCastoff,3,Mon Jul 20 21:01:14 2015 UTC,No. Actually I like it even more than the first one.
TrueDetective,3dxtug,somik27,3,Mon Jul 20 22:18:48 2015 UTC,"And yeah, compared to virtually all over police procedurals/dramas on non premium cable tv(especially network tv), it blows that all away. I mean look at David Duchovny's NBC show Aquarius...it typifies all that's wrong with network tv shows still(bad cinematography, bad camera lensing, bad acting, unconvincing writing) I even feel the same way with ""Hannibal"" sadly."
TrueDetective,3dxtug,mechasquid,3,Tue Jul 21 03:47:23 2015 UTC,"I'd say I'm liking it the same. I'm less interested in the plot than season 1, but I care more about what happens to the characters. I'm not sure if that makes sense."
TrueDetective,3dxtug,Bucket1984,3,Tue Jul 21 05:01:37 2015 UTC,I like it a lot more. The characters are just more likable to me. And damn there have been so many epic one liners there are almost too many to count. I dont understand anyone who doesnt like and I truly feel sorry that they dont get to feel this enjoyment that I am feeling.
TrueDetective,3dxtug,JoeMWallace99,3,Tue Jul 21 06:16:41 2015 UTC,"People are way too hung up on comparing last season to this season. It's a different show, just with the same title. How about we let the story unfold before we judge the entire season?"
TrueDetective,3dxtug,MrWrestling13,11,Tue Jul 21 15:07:53 2015 UTC,I like it a lot. I think this season needs a lot more thinking which is possibly turning casual viewers away.
TrueDetective,3dxtug,HerroPhish,7,Mon Jul 20 14:46:56 2015 UTC,Yes
TrueDetective,3dxtug,DjGenes,3,Mon Jul 20 17:47:28 2015 UTC,it really is that simple. Anyone who thinks this comes close to the same caliber show as last season just simply isn't being objective about it.
TrueDetective,3dxtug,montetristo1,5,Tue Jul 21 15:09:30 2015 UTC,I'm loving every thing about season two just as much as I loved season one. I like all the characters in both seasons. I might even like Ani and Ray better then Rust and Marty. I can't wait to see where the show takes them!
TrueDetective,3dxtug,Regreditt,7,Mon Jul 20 18:52:11 2015 UTC,"Dare I say it is even better. Last night in the episode threat someone was whining about how their is too much character exposition... Umm, I personally think that is one of my favorite things when watching a visual medium. I think an added benefit from Season 1 to Season 2 is additional characters. In Season 1 Marty and Rust are the only two true main characters, Michelle Monaghan plays her part but doesn't really exist out Marty and Rust Cohle's world, similar to Jordan with Frank this season.  This season there have been four main characters throughout: Ani, Frank, Paul, and Velcoro. There have also been several other characters who have been involved in more scenes and help create more ""world,"" where as I don't feel there was as much of that in season 1. Alex Daddario and the two new cops were probably the biggest other characters after Marty's wife, and they didn't get a lot of screen time. Contrast that with Vinci City Hall, Pitlor, the state attorney, Ani's sister, Paul's fiancee, Velcoro's ex wife (who actually had nude pictures of her released during The Fappening FYI :), and Ray's son.  This might be partially biased just by watching Season 2 now, but I feel the additional characters and their development has allowed for a more complex story to be told. I have enjoyed them both immensely."
TrueDetective,3dxtug,piraterio,14,Mon Jul 20 16:48:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah I actually like Season 2 better because I think the plot is better and the characters are richer.  A lot of the criticisms that are being thrown around about Season 2 (bad dialogue, cliched settings) I thought were just as problematic or worse in Season 1.  Rust's monologues made me cringe, the whole ""oh look we found a devil's nest"" thing was stupid, and anyone who's spent some time deep in the deep south could see through the show's almost Disney-like portrayals of biker bars, brothels, church revivals, etc.  I think this season has some of the same issues, but I don't think it's any worse than Season 1."
TrueDetective,3dxtug,monalisa2380,7,Mon Jul 20 13:38:45 2015 UTC,"Season 1 didn't get really popular to the masses until it had already aired 4 or 5 episodes.  People could binge watch those first few episodes.  Not the case this year, which is why it seems more slow paced, but it isn't.  It's all relative.  I like season 2 as much as season 1 because it's completely different, who wants the same shit every year?"
TrueDetective,3dxtug,tonyjefferson,4,Mon Jul 20 15:02:41 2015 UTC,"Season 1 didn't get really popular to the masses until it had already aired 4 or 5 episodes. People could binge watch those first few episodes. Not the case this year, which is why it seems more slow paced, but it isn't. It's all relative.   Completely true. I've been saying that for weeks. Thanks for thinking that too."
TrueDetective,3dxtug,metalninjacake2,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:13:23 2015 UTC,"As far as plot progression goes this season is slow as everloving fuck. Very little happened from the end of episode 1 to the beginning of this episode. Lots of exposition sure, but no progress."
TrueDetective,3dxtug,BrainSlurper,4,Mon Jul 20 18:40:08 2015 UTC,"I see the show as an eight hour movie. I think it's really difficult to judge the whole without knowing all the parts. Any perceived weaknesses in the first act still have a chance to be redeemed, or at least substantiated, by the end result. So I'll wait and see, but so far I'm enjoying the fuck out of it."
TrueDetective,3dxtug,ancientlogics,5,Mon Jul 20 16:05:03 2015 UTC,I don't necessarily agree with this. If the journey isn't interesting then how good the ending is becomes irrelevant to the overall quality at least imo.
TrueDetective,3dxtug,TreyAdell,2,Mon Jul 20 19:49:15 2015 UTC,"That's true if you find the journey entirely uninteresting, but with season 2 of TD it seems that most people find faults with the story so far but remain interested in where it's going. But yes, if none of it interests you then the ending will likely disappoint regardless."
TrueDetective,3dxtug,ancientlogics,4,Mon Jul 20 21:08:36 2015 UTC,"I'm enjoying season 2 so far, but I wasn't the biggest fan of season 1. The first five or so episodes were great, but in the end it felt a little flat. However, I feel like this season is working in reverse; the first half of the season was somewhat dull, and now it's finally starting to pick up. However, I don't think it should have taken half the season in order for things to get interesting. But in the end, it still has all the same elements that drew me into season 1, if not a bit more understated, so what's not to like?"
TrueDetective,3dxtug,hosiahbartlet,4,Tue Jul 21 00:47:34 2015 UTC,"Absolutely LOVING it. I don't know what Wired, Vox, Daily Beast and every other buzz site out to attack season 2 is thinking. Yeah there's a lot of characters and plot points and unnatural trope filled dialogue...but it's pulp noir. And I love the feel, cinematography, etc of it. There was things about season 1 that annoyed me too. Just the fact we have a season set in a whole different time, world, geography with different characters. It's amazing. And there's been plenty of holy shit moments and im sure will be plenty more. Still tho, Birdman was my fave moment yet. And if we saw an amazing next level acting side of Mcconaughey, this year's its all about Colin Ferrel."
TrueDetective,3dxtug,mechasquid,6,Tue Jul 21 03:45:45 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's horrible or anything, but I did not realize until after last night's show that there are only three remaining episodes to come. My immediate thoughts were ""Wow, they need to wrap up a lot of stuff in those last three"", ""Wow, are they even going to wrap up a lot of stuff in those last three?"", and ""Wow, I hope they don't wrap everything up too conveniently in those last three"".  I think they could have done a better job with pacing and maybe lost the Woodrugh character. There's a lot going on, and while I'm not advocating writing that blatantly spells it out for you, at times I've thought the characters and what they're dealing with has come across as a little sparse.  Also does the guitar girl just live on that stage only playing for the waitresses? C'mon... stuff like that makes me think this season might have taken itself a little too seriously."
TrueDetective,3dxtug,DanzigMeowMeow,2,Mon Jul 20 15:03:53 2015 UTC,"Someone pointed this out earlier, but the bar singer is definitely supposed to be the equivalent of the chorus in a Greek tragedy. If you listen closely to her lyrics, and the way characters pause their dialogue to listen to her, you'll see what I mean."
TrueDetective,3dxtug,TrynnaFindaBalance,4,Mon Jul 20 21:13:43 2015 UTC,"Hah, well hearing that makes me think they really took themselves a little too seriously this season :P Thanks for the knowledge though, I figured she had some type of Lynchian dynamic I wasn't aware of."
TrueDetective,3dxtug,DanzigMeowMeow,7,Mon Jul 20 21:28:53 2015 UTC,"I love it. I don't even think about season one like so many in here do. It's an exceedingly interesting show. Take it for what it is.  And besides, season one had a shitty ending. People remember it more fondly than they actually felt about it at the time."
TrueDetective,3dxtug,CircusMaximo,2,Mon Jul 20 13:11:02 2015 UTC,"It's been up and down in the early going but I've been really enjoying this season. I think season was more polished, especially from a visual standpoint, but I'm way more into the plot and thinking about the show throughout the week than I ever was with the first season."
TrueDetective,3dxtug,TcH3rNo,2,Mon Jul 20 16:51:23 2015 UTC,"I really think it's like comparing apples to oranges, the crimes are different the setting is different so I just take it as it is, I find myself just as engaged as I was last season."
TrueDetective,3dxtug,Cannot_go_back_now,2,Mon Jul 20 17:51:59 2015 UTC,"The hardest part is the fact that this time instead of 2 main characters, its 3 and that changes pacing and the whole dynamic quite a lot.  We're a little over half way through I guess and its the same fun as last season watching all the pieces fall into place, its just a matter of time before shit REALLY hits the fan and we'll have to go back and re-watch to understand the pure genius of what was really happening."
TrueDetective,3dxtug,gunpla,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:00:24 2015 UTC,"They're entirely different shows, and I'm cool with that.  I like each season basically being its own self-contained show."
TrueDetective,3dxtug,spergery,2,Mon Jul 20 18:09:18 2015 UTC,I think Ray is gonna kill Frank in the next episode.
TrueDetective,3dxtug,dark_night_life,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:12:16 2015 UTC,"I like both seasons a lot. Neither season is perfect, but people love to talk shit about season 2 for some reason.  The writing is not as good this season, but was the dialogue really that good last season? Or did they write the same ridiculous dialogue, but since mcconaughey delivered it, it was great?  Also, the ending of season 1 was garbage. So if season 2 can end in a strong way, it could easily surpass season 1 as a whole."
TrueDetective,3dxtug,KillerTofuuuuuu,2,Mon Jul 20 18:16:24 2015 UTC,Thank you for not making this one of those damn John Goodman memes.
TrueDetective,3dxtug,jefusan,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:46:52 2015 UTC,As of right now I enjoy season 1 quite a bit more (but that could just be due to being a huge McConaughey and Harrelson fan). But I'm going to wait till the season finishes to make final judgements
TrueDetective,3dxtug,IDKimnotascientist,2,Mon Jul 20 18:52:00 2015 UTC,"I am enjoying this season as it progresses. However, I still think you can't touch the aura that last season brought. Last season to me brought this much more effective 'mysterious' feeling that hasn't (nor do I think it could) been replicated this year."
TrueDetective,3dxtug,conman404,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:14:19 2015 UTC,"I think the last season was the best television show I've ever watched, period. This season, while good, doesn't sniff the greatness of last season."
TrueDetective,3dxtug,Flymolo2,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:38:35 2015 UTC,this season is trash Everything is about pizzolatto' toxic version of masculinity  The dialogue is hilariously awful All the good feedback he got from last season led him to try and recreate rust in 4 different characters but it's so broken
TrueDetective,3dxtug,memefan69,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:41:50 2015 UTC,I like this season a lot but I can see how people might not like it. Just drink more whiskey during the show and it will be a 100% better ahahahaha
TrueDetective,3dxtug,SpaceHooker,2,Mon Jul 20 19:55:07 2015 UTC,"I really like this season too, and I get annoyed that people are judging it so harshly. Each individual episode hasnt been great, but this is a show that works as a whole, not in chapters. I will feel more confident in judging the season when its done."
TrueDetective,3dxtug,jollylolly101,2,Mon Jul 20 19:57:00 2015 UTC,"Last night was the first episode I watched on my own (previous episodes from this season I watched with the family). A lot more enjoyable watching it in a nice dark, quiet room instead of watching it in room full of people complaining about how difficult it is to understand.  Seems to me that last night was evidence that this show is a lot more nuanced and detailed than both the first season and other TV shows from the last 5-7 years. I.e, watching something like Mr. Robot or The Brink requires very little processing to understand the story. Why? Because those shows were designed to be TV shows whereas TD Season 2 behaves more like a book (the subtleties in the acting and individual character plots are what make it interesting).   If you look back to Season 1, that worked so well with the audience because those 'bookish' elements were not dependencies for the story itself. Take away the book elements of Season 1 and you're still left with a solid detective mystery/show. Sure, adding them in enhances the story and brings it to a whole new level but not understanding/not paying attention to Rust's stories and so on don't detract from the mystery. Many people I know that watched Season 1 didn't really get all of what Rust was saying but it was clear that they liked it because they saw Rust as some enhancer for the mystery/story. Too many people came into this season excepting that same formula as Season 1, a formula that allows people to ignore the characters and dedicate their concentration to the story alone. You can't do that with this season because the story this time is the characters themselves. That was the case with my family: By episode 2 and 3 they didn't know what was going on because they were 'waiting for something to happen' which meant they ignored the character stories..."
TrueDetective,3dxtug,zakarhino,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:11:11 2015 UTC,"It's getting better with each episode, and maybe once it's done it'll click, but the first season was phenomenally good, yet to be matched."
TrueDetective,3dxtug,spundred,2,Mon Jul 20 22:03:32 2015 UTC,I love it because it takes place a few miles from my house and its got that Noir LA theme
TrueDetective,3dxtug,apineda50,2,Mon Jul 20 23:23:39 2015 UTC,I love it too! It's not as accessible as the first season but it is amazing if you can read the symbols and have had even the slightest training in literary analysis.
TrueDetective,3dxtug,drunkymcgee,2,Mon Jul 20 23:47:26 2015 UTC,"You're not alone, OP. I'm enjoying this season just as much as the first for different reasons."
TrueDetective,3dxtug,chicken_boob,2,Mon Jul 20 23:56:18 2015 UTC,"Exactly. It might not truly hold the same quality as last season but it's still engrossing, sophisticated television. I have no complaints."
TrueDetective,3dxtug,mcrandley,2,Tue Jul 21 01:22:57 2015 UTC,"I've enjoyed this one as much as the last one, a lot of people are giving it slack. And, while last season was phenomenal, I was really let down by the ending."
TrueDetective,3dxtug,lambomrclago,2,Tue Jul 21 01:36:04 2015 UTC,"Honestly, it's the best show on television. I can't think of anything that even comes close to it right now."
TrueDetective,3dxtug,pieman_,2,Tue Jul 21 02:08:25 2015 UTC,"Better call Saul,  but it's on break"
TrueDetective,3dxtug,Dundunbanza,2,Tue Jul 21 03:29:05 2015 UTC,I liked this season better than the last actually. It seems more filled out  to me. There are more characters with lives that are more complete this year.
TrueDetective,3dxtug,mechasquid,2,Tue Jul 21 02:19:46 2015 UTC,"For those of you hating Season 2...did you like the rather boring episode 6 of last season, or the rushed episode 8 where literally half the episode was spent anti-climatically in a hospital with cheesey buddy buddy anecdotes(after a meh final fight with the yellow king right out of a 1993 van damme movie) ?????"
TrueDetective,3dxtug,arthwyr,3,Tue Jul 21 09:52:50 2015 UTC,"I'm enjoying it just as much as the last season, just a different experience this time around. I'm a little sad there's only 3 episodes left. I'm already wanting another season."
TrueDetective,3dxtug,ravelle,3,Mon Jul 20 14:07:11 2015 UTC,"I'm liking it but I'm having a hard time following what's going on in this season, maybe it's because there's so many characters and names being dropped but I had to look up who Caspere was when the show started."
TrueDetective,3dxtug,NativeMonday,2,Mon Jul 20 14:15:18 2015 UTC,"I agree with your sentiment for the most part. From week to week I have a hard time remembering how exactly what connects to what and who connects to who. I feel like they'll get a clue and investigate that clue in the next episode, but I've already forgotten where they got the clue so the set up for the ""investigation"" of it is somewhat lost.   Like I'm supposed to expect certain things out of a scene but instead I have no expectation because I forgot why they're going there in the first place.  From that perspective, I think I'm going to binge-watch the season once the last episode is aired, because it feels like that's the way I should be watching this show. Once I am able to binge it, I think I'll enjoy this season more than the last."
TrueDetective,3dxtug,bilsonM,3,Mon Jul 20 15:51:52 2015 UTC,"People love to compare the two seasons, which I think is a waste of time. I am enjoying this season just as much as last season. My adrenaline was pumping last night watching the group decide to go ""off-grid"" and seeing them piece things together.  Also, I hate this notion that this show is confusing. It's not confusing, it's an extremely straightforward premise. I sit and talk with people about the show and they're all ""I have no idea what's going"" and I just sit there thinking they're not actually watching. Maybe put your phone away and actually listen to the words being spoken."
TrueDetective,3dxtug,564738291056,3,Mon Jul 20 16:51:01 2015 UTC,"I agree with you. I think the previous season had more exciting individual episodes, as the action was focused on two people with clashing ideas dealing with a simple mystery. This allowed you to invest quickly and powerfully in the characters and their goals, which also developed quickly. I think this season, viewed as a whole, will be just as strong. There are a lot of interesting parallels between all of the characters, as well as a few motifs. The ideas are less explicit, as the characters aren't sitting about arguing them as they drive to the case, but they're there, and will become, I think, quite apparent once the final actions of the story take place. The characters also take much longer to unfold to us, and to grow close to one another, but they do it for reasons that are much more profound than proximity. Those parallels. It'll be much easier to see everything coming together episode to episode on a rewatch, when we finally know what is slack and what isn't. I suspect most of it won't be."
TrueDetective,3dxtug,Takeme2yourleader,3,Mon Jul 20 17:36:59 2015 UTC,It's not as good. And by that I mean the directing.
TrueDetective,3dxtug,Ellisj98,5,Mon Jul 20 14:21:26 2015 UTC,"No, but I stopped watching this season. I thought it was just awful"

TrueDetective,3dxtug,treemeizer,3,Mon Jul 20 21:11:37 2015 UTC,"Maybe I'm just too dedicated to hate it.   This. Had season 2 been the flagship of the series, I doubt it'd be picked up for a second. The back tracking of opinions wreak of desperation, calling attention away from it's many flaws. The shootout stands as a cross section of this; a b-movie attempt at suspense. The only 'susp' I experienced throughout it's over-the-top antics was the 'susp'ension of disbelief I had to force just to get through it.  If you're too dedicated to hate it, I'm too dedicated to let quality slide. Everyone involved with this series can do better, and they know it."
TrueDetective,3dxtug,monsterlynn,3,Mon Jul 20 17:59:20 2015 UTC,"Had season 2 been the flagship of the series, I doubt it'd be picked up for a second.    Gotta disagree here. You've got big name actors in a crime drama focusing on the peculiarities of the setting in a way that touches on some pretty sophisticated discussion of the decadence that California represents without beating you over the head with it. Just because it doesn't have that baroque, Spanish-moss covered Southern creepiness to it doesn't mean it isn't hitting the mark.   I think if the order of seasons was reversed, we'd be having much the same discussion about Rust and Marty being flat caricatures of Southern cops, and people would be pissed the fuck off with Rust's philosophical ramblings, thinking they're way over the top for a crime drama show, and wondering when the hell it's going to get into what actually happened with the case.   It's so apples and oranges. It's the same genre, but two different takes on it. I like the robust, no-nonsense police work aspect to this season, the way it takes you into various crime subcultures of the CA, and how, like season 1, it all comes down to the games the rich and powerful play in the shadows."
TrueDetective,3dxtug,friendlystar,4,Mon Jul 20 18:28:13 2015 UTC,"Youre only watching because of the title True Detective. When you realize you cant remember taylor kitsch's name in the show and how hes almost forgettable in it, then you start to realize how bad the show actually is. You guys think people are complaining because its ""good"" but not as good as season one. No its night and day in quality, writing, directing, pacing, and most importantly acting. People dont watch a tv show and want it to be bad. Youre being sold bullshit because the brand you know and love sold it to you."
TrueDetective,3dxtug,gulagdandy,3,Mon Jul 20 17:30:52 2015 UTC,"Yep, you're 100% right. It's not just worse than season 1, it's bad. It's a bad show."
TrueDetective,3dxtug,montetristo1,2,Mon Jul 20 22:13:25 2015 UTC,after tonight i think its a safe point to say this season is just no good.
TrueDetective,3dxtug,Viney,3,Tue Jul 21 15:14:55 2015 UTC,The only thing season two lacks that season one had going for it was McConaughey's drawl which is perfectly suited to Pizzolato's dialogue. The show is not at all that different otherwise.  I am as engrossed in this season as I was with the last. I hope it gets renewed for a third season
TrueDetective,3dxtug,likeagirlwithflowers,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:46:35 2015 UTC,That's a good point you make about his drawl suiting the dialogue. Never considered that. It sounded so poetic coming from his mouth.
TrueDetective,3dxtug,nonghost,2,Mon Jul 20 15:00:04 2015 UTC,"There's over 7 billion people in the world, you're probably not the only one of anything."
TrueDetective,3dxtug,yogurtmeh,3,Mon Jul 20 15:42:01 2015 UTC,"I love both seasons equally. I can't stop watching. But I'm sort of bothered by some of the writing in Season 2.  First off, the high-end call girls are revealed to be victims of human trafficking. That's not really the case for most high-end prostitutes. (See the documentary about the ring Elliot Spitzer and other politicians were involved in.) This type of portrayal frames prostitution as a forced act that desperate women turn to, which is why so many people think it should be illegal.   Human trafficking is a nasty business; it's not boob jobs and lip gloss and houses in the hills. It's men, women, and children forced to perform manual labor without fair wages. Human trafficking ≠ high-end prostitution. Sometimes they overlap, but not usually in this way.   Then Frank's wife Jordan (Kelly Reilly) is unable to conceive because of previous abortions. Legal abortions performed by a doctor don't affect fertility. Things that can actually make you infertile that they could've used: untreated, symptom-less chlamydia leading to Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID); nonviable eggs; uterine damage due to an emergency c-section or injury; illegal abortion by an unlicensed practitioner; etc.  But the writers were lazy. The whole abortion leading to infertility thing is a pro-life myth meant to scare and shame women."
TrueDetective,3dxtug,Boopa1219,3,Mon Jul 20 17:04:46 2015 UTC,"I think this season is WAY WAY better than last season, and I realize that I might be in the minority. I love the contemporary noir-esque setting, the Michael Mann, John Woo flavor and the Greek tragedy aspect to the overall plot and characters."
TrueDetective,3dxtug,MaceOfBass,3,Mon Jul 20 22:42:17 2015 UTC,Same
TrueDetective,3dxtug,GoryWizard,3,Mon Jul 20 22:59:37 2015 UTC,"I'm absolutely enthralled in this season. I was expecting a big episode this week and since that's what we got, I can now confidently say I'm just as much of a fan of this season as I was of season 1. Casting, acting, cinematography, plot, pacing, tone... I've loved it all.  People keep complaining about the season's pacing, but I think it's been fantastic. We, as an audience, are expecting some sort of crazy, intricate, dark hidden mystery because we're watching True Detective, but these characters don't know that. They aren't living in a fantasy bubble where nominal police work involves busting ritualistic murder cults and corrupt shadow conglomerates. Murder cases are cut and dry, more often than not, and it's not unreasonable to suspect that the lives of miserable burnouts are slow, laborious, and depressing. The first four episodes were necessary staging and setup for what very well could be the most dynamic 4 episodes of television to hit this year. Plus, there's nothing inherently wrong with (potentially) superfluous information; good mysteries are typically full of dead ends, false clues, and disconnected character information. Shit, season 1 was full of ""useless"" information, but nobody seems to be complaining about that."
TrueDetective,3dxtug,Scapular_of_ears,5,Mon Jul 20 14:24:37 2015 UTC,"I'm glad you do. I have to say I'm barely hanging on at the moment, but I'll see it through to the end. Perhaps a second binge watch after it's done will solidify it for me."
TrueDetective,3dxtug,Jig86,4,Mon Jul 20 14:35:57 2015 UTC,"This season's story is actually better than S1, but it's developing a little slow. The S1 plot device of time-switching spiced up a lesser story.  My main issue with this season is Paul. I think he takes more away than he adds. Any time devoted to Paul would be better spent on Ray/Ani/Frank imo."
TrueDetective,3dxtug,rdz1986,8,Mon Jul 20 13:20:00 2015 UTC,I think Paul's going to have some kind of shocking reveal. So far he's the only one not tied to anything.
TrueDetective,3dxtug,Scapular_of_ears,2,Mon Jul 20 13:32:14 2015 UTC,I find the story this season pretty bland. It's an investigation I really couldn't care less about. I thought the first was creepy and oddly majestic with its southern gothic setting.
TrueDetective,3dxtug,Frankybigs,0,Mon Jul 20 16:54:57 2015 UTC,"imo the first season's plot was very simple, but stylized with the creepiness, the interviews and the time-switching. This season's plot is more complex and more interesting, but it's told so slowly and straight forward as to make it less appealing, overall."
TrueDetective,3dxtug,TastelessAlien,2,Mon Jul 20 18:33:17 2015 UTC,"I love it just as much. People are so negative. Plus, they look back on season one so fondly because it was a great product but they forget it was just as slow in the beginning there was just not a previous season to compare it to"
TrueDetective,3dxtug,JoesShittyOs,2,Mon Jul 20 13:33:02 2015 UTC,Yes.
TrueDetective,3dxtug,ircmullaney,2,Mon Jul 20 18:16:06 2015 UTC,"I rewatched the first season last night and basically... No, season 2 doesn't even come close. The worst episode in season 1 is still better than the beat this season has had to offer. And I'm not even that critical of a guy.   The first season felt like an 8 hour long movie where this season feels like a tv show (albeit a good one)."
TrueDetective,3dxtug,rmarti78,2,Mon Jul 20 22:29:25 2015 UTC,"I've been recapping this season with a friend and so I've watched every episode twice this season. Frankly, most of it is pretty boring (pun intended). The big exception is Ray. His storyline is very compelling. His scenes with the state's investigator and his ex wife were fantastic, while almost everything with Frank and Jordan bores me."
TrueDetective,3dxtug,Monkeyexp7,2,Mon Jul 20 22:56:55 2015 UTC,"People still use that ""better than 90% of everything on tv right now"" line like it's still 2007 and you're trying to justify why you're still watching a bad season of 24 or Heroes. Justify why you like True Detective without trying to slam TV in general. TV is so good nowadays that even freaking USA has a AAA show in Mr. Robot."
TrueDetective,3dxtug,reedmaster16,2,Mon Jul 20 13:13:18 2015 UTC,I'm leaning towards season 2 honestly. I really like the urban setting and the larger scale better than the first.

Edit for sense."
TrueDetective,3dxtug,colonizemalar,0,Mon Jul 20 16:30:57 2015 UTC,"The only thing I'm really pining for is the creepy vibe. I get that bird-mask-man is occultish and the rich pervs are doing creepy shit, but I really am having trouble coming up with the strong themes that typified S1. Like the way Marty is the same kind of sonuvabitch that he was trying to capture, the point being that Errol was taking Marty's mistreatment of women to its extreme. And that the evil the were fighting is in all of them, in the universe. Maybe having the church be a major player made this easier?  In this season, all the cops are drunks. Um...I mean I guess that's depressing? Like I see how the show is trying to tie things together - Ani's gambling relates to Frank and she is indirectly supporting the whole pros ring, jerk Geldof is just as corrupt as those he investigates - but it doesn't resonate soo darkly like the first did. The further we go the more I expect the ending to be Scooby-Doo: they pull the Bird-Mask off and it's Blake!?? He woulda got away with too, if it weren't for meddling kids!"

But until we find out what exactly was/happened at Black Mountain I'd say he's more of a product of his environment.  Also the story behind the scars has to be a big deal to him.  I mean just look at the relationship with his mother, that would fuck any child up.  Also, his sexuality and now having a child/getting married to get away from being gay that is a whole mother set of problems.  Maybe he should set up an appointment with Dr. Pitlor.  I'm sure he could find a cure using a combination of hookers, plastic surgery, medication, and psych wards."
TrueDetective,3e1zlj,DirtyxD75,0,Tue Jul 21 11:01:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I know it's very 'conspiracy theorist' haha. We've seen a lot of allusions to Bohemian Grove conspiracies so it doesn't seem like a huge leap to assume if NP is aware of Bohemian Grove theories he would also be aware of MKUltra right?  I'm interested to see how much of his Black Mountain background we get to see."
TrueDetective,3e1zlj,DirtyxD75,2,Tue Jul 21 11:35:07 2015 UTC,I was talking to my mom the other night on the phone about bohemian grove (when I was a kid living in SoCal they were members of club 33 at Disneyland for a little bit) and asked if she knew about it.  She said her hairstylist dated a guy who was a chef for the bohemian club and one night had a Paul McCartney concert for like 15 people.  I think bohemian grove are just the 1% of the 1% thinking they're God and control the whole world and can do whatever the fuck they want.  Kinda like the city of Vinci.  I think when they referred to Chessani's lodge that was s clue to the whole bohemian grove.    I do think the scars are going to be what gives us a clue into what black mountain really was but by TD standards we won't find out till the last episode.
TrueDetective,3e1zlj,ShockingConclusion,2,Tue Jul 21 12:02:42 2015 UTC,"Thanks for sharing that McCartney story, I can believe it for sure.  I didn't know a huge amount about Bohemian Grove but thanks to TD and Reddit I decided to read up on it. I agree with your view, just a venue for the elite to socialise with each other.

TrueDetective,3e1zlj,hakikidedektif,0,Tue Jul 21 13:40:01 2015 UTC,Just inference but something tells me Paul wasn't all that involved in what ever bad stuff happened within black mountain operations and he tells the actresses lawyer he wasn't there in episode 5.  His military friend talked about 3 days in a village during that time. I think they took safe haven there away from the violence and Paul might have to admit this for his defense on whatever the audience will find he is accused of.
TrueDetective,3e1zlj,kicklecubicle,3,Tue Jul 21 15:26:04 2015 UTC,MK name comes from monarch butterfly.  Remember butterflies on the walls of Paul's girfriend's house. Or were they living together? http://vigilantcitizen.com/hidden-knowledge/origins-and-techniques-of-monarch-mind-control/
TrueDetective,3e1zlj,hakikidedektif,2,Tue Jul 21 12:12:01 2015 UTC,No one has noticed that there is an extra butterfly added to her wall between the first and second episode.
TrueDetective,3e1zlj,czj113,0,Tue Jul 21 15:35:55 2015 UTC,I saw that too! great spot.  I think the symbolism is definitely there. I don't know if it will actually impact the plot though. It wouldn't surprise me if it never goes anywhere. What do you think?
TrueDetective,3e1zlj,thedreamcomparison,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:48:47 2015 UTC,"I am not a native English speaker. Be prepared for awkward expressions. I am sure there is something about butterflies but not sure if it is going to be MK Ultra. Butterflies everywhere; Paul's house, Chessanie's daughter's room, Vera's sister's house. In season1 there was symbolism and it was going somewhere.  Story was complete.  There was a main plot(yellow king,carcosa) and there was another story about how the corruption of powerful people poisoning the society with them though the generations.  All the symbols were supporting that background story. I think it is the same again. We should wait for season to end. In the mean time you should read this article about season 1 symbolism if you haven't yet: http://vigilantcitizen.com/moviesandtv/deeper-meaning-true-detective-season-one/"
TrueDetective,3e1zlj,bobvsdonovan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:28:50 2015 UTC,Your English is very good. I did read that article a few months ago and I think it helps prove that the True Detective team do include esoteric messages in the show.  I agree with you regarding Season 1 too. It had a very layered story. I think a lot of people are only interested in the top layer (the murder mystery) and miss the more subtle plots. I think season 2 will prove to be the same.
TrueDetective,3e1zlj,peepholepringle,3,Tue Jul 21 13:42:14 2015 UTC,"I can totally get on board with this. I mentioned a few days ago about the signs of Paul having Dissociative Identity Disorder and touched on some of these points.   Now, that I'm looking into this MK-Ultra thing, there is definitely some more supporting evidence. I think there might more characters controlled than Paul.  Interesting Notes: Supposedly, the first evidence / history of mind control by Occult was in the Egyptions ""Book of Dead"". Monarchs on the wall. ""Other Lives"". Experiments with LSD in military. ""He couldn't handle the deep trip"",  I think Ani's sister and maybe the Chessani son are also controlled through years of past abuse, but the son has too many personalities to control."
TrueDetective,3e1zlj,thedreamcomparison,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:20:48 2015 UTC,"I actually saw your post about DID, we have a very similar take on Paul it seems. I guess my view differs as I think his identity disorder was deliberately programmed into him where as you thought it was a consequence of his time in Black Mountain right?  Great point about the Egyptian ties. I didn't spot the ""Book of the Dead"" reference but I wouldn't consider myself well read on Egyption myths or culture.  I definitely noticed the Mayor talking about ""the deep trip"" and his Son's alter ego's though. It feels like a lot of the smaller players in Vinci are pawns being manipulated by the Elite.  Something I found interesting was Ani's father speaking about not forcing his will on people anymore (not sure of exact quote) could it be possible that he found a way to mind control/manipulate people and he shared this technique with his ""camp buddies"" like the Mayor and Dr?"
