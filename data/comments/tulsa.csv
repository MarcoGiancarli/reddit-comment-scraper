I've had outdoor cats before and I know how they are, but is it technically illegal for someone to kill your pet if it is on their land? I grew up in the country and well... Killing wild cats and dogs is something we had to do to protect our own cats/dogs."

tulsa,3e0pcj,Thats_absrd,2,Tue Jul 21 12:22:41 2015 UTC,Not really downtown or midtown area but fogue and bates around 71st and sheridan is my favorite place. Great selection and the gentleman that usually works is more than helpful. He is the main reason I go back because he is very knowledgeable with recommendations and very willing to answer questions
tulsa,3e0pcj,Stands_While_Poops,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:07:15 2015 UTC,"Did you notice if the cigar shops also carry shisha for hookahs? The smoke shops around here that have hookahs are pretty dissapointing. Most only sell Fantasia or Starbuzz brand shisha, which are the grossest brands. Shisha at 71st and Mingo has a decent selection, but they are so damn expensive.   They claim it's mark up due to Oklahoma tobacco taxes, but the same size and brand of shisha at star ship is $5 where they charge $8. They also up charge on on nontobacco items for hookahs, like hoses and coals. Like I can get a hose online for $4 while they charge $12 for the same thing.    Ordering online is cheaper, but takes a couple days to get here. I'm always on the lookout for new places around town to get shisha."
tulsa,3e0pcj,CeeDiddy82,2,Tue Jul 21 23:53:34 2015 UTC,Fogue and bates is strictly a cigar and tobacco pipe shop. The only hooka place I've been to is the one you mentioned

They might be below the average but they are well above the median so there are far more teams (cough cough the Kings) that would be more likely to move."

I guess if you think that the 45th largest market is going to keep a pro team in the long run then you are. Only Memphis and NO are smaller. As soon as the team starts losing and they start asking for a new arena to replace the shitty one they play at, they'll be gone. You think Oklahoma is the only place with billionaires that want to buy rejected teams?  At least you can enjoy them for another decade."

I remember that same lot being there 20 years ago, and probably longer than that, back when it was a Service Merchandise.  Tulsa had a far smaller population back then.  I am really hoping that the parking lot for the new development is packed all the time.  I am tired of seeing these empty parking lots everywhere.  Seriously, why won't anyone build where the Best Buy is off of I-44 and Yale?  Do you go to that park a lot where the new development is going?  I used to live down there, and I remember it being pretty unused, I haven't been there in about a month or so tho."
