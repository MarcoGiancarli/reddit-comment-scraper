Nirvana,3e13wf,PlasterBaby,3,Tue Jul 21 03:41:36 2015 UTC,"To this day it blows my mind (sorry) that Kurt agreed to wear eye liner. Not that it really matters, and it does look kind if cool, but that seems like the kind if thing he'd loathe"
Nirvana,3e13wf,rouletabille,3,Tue Jul 21 09:21:50 2015 UTC,Why?
Nirvana,3e13wf,TerraTactics,2,Tue Jul 21 10:54:08 2015 UTC,"Well wearing makeup so as to fit the image of 'rock star' seems a bit phony, doesn't it? I'm assuming he was asked/told to do so, but who knows? Maybe it was his idea"
Nirvana,3e13wf,rouletabille,6,Tue Jul 21 11:04:34 2015 UTC,"I'm sure it was his idea. In 1991 The Year Punk Broke, Kurt is* allowing Kim Gordon to apply his make up. And I read quotes before about Kurt, that he wore foundation and stuff, to cover up his problem skin."
Nirvana,3e13wf,orangeappled,6,Tue Jul 21 13:10:23 2015 UTC,"I think Kurt just did whatever the f*ck he wanted, like wear dresses, dye his hair purple, etc."
Nirvana,3e13wf,tuneorg,3,Tue Jul 21 13:31:58 2015 UTC,he has eyeliner on 4 years later here
Nirvana,3e13wf,bradyarmobile,0,Tue Jul 21 13:10:29 2015 UTC,This looks later than 1990 to me.  Didn't krist and Kurt both still have long hair at that point?  It looks short here.  I'd say this is 1993.
Nirvana,3e13wf,LunchpaiI,3,Tue Jul 21 14:31:04 2015 UTC,The first half of the year he did. This is from October 21st.
Nirvana,3e13wf,Dissident82,2,Tue Jul 21 14:46:19 2015 UTC,This is definitely from 1990.  This picture was taken during the John Peel Sessions.  VIDEO

Nirvana,3dr9o9,my_butt_hurts_now,2,Sun Jul 19 10:06:08 2015 UTC,Polly's pretty good
Nirvana,3dr9o9,gredgex,3,Sat Jul 18 23:29:06 2015 UTC,"Sappy, the smart studios version is chill, really good too. Pennyroyal tea, the lithium demo, and here she comes now may count too.   Also check out the entire unplugged album as well, that may be more what you're looking for."
Nirvana,3dr9o9,jcjh,2,Sat Jul 18 18:41:03 2015 UTC,Thank you i really like the unplugged album
Nirvana,3dr9o9,viners,3,Sat Jul 18 18:43:17 2015 UTC,"How about ""Horrified"" (not the real title, which is unknown)? This one is really chill."
Nirvana,3dr9o9,ottoplainview,2,Sat Jul 18 20:10:51 2015 UTC,Omg yes thank you
