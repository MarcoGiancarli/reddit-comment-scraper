shootingcars,3dzq7x,marsofwar,7,Mon Jul 20 21:05:30 2015 UTC,"Personally it's right on the edge for me. The problem with HDR is most of the time you lose a little sharpness and clarity, which is then compensated for in post, which give it a harsh and cloudy appearance. This isn't that far and I think is a good example of what HDR could be capable of, but I wouldn't push the HDR any further.  That being said, I think it's a great and interesting shot, beautiful car, and really awesome backdrop!"
shootingcars,3dzq7x,Iamthetophergopher,2,Mon Jul 20 22:16:10 2015 UTC,Thanks! I was wrestling with whether to push it further or not. I hate landscape images that push it too far and you see the tale tell signs like the highlighting and such.  But thanks for the critiques. It was quite a bit more fun than just taking landscapes.
shootingcars,3dzq7x,outerspace_rebel,5,Tue Jul 21 00:12:58 2015 UTC,Yes you did in my opinion.  A photo is supposed to have some shadows. Personally i dislike the amount of reflections in the car. It distracts from the car.

shootingcars,3dzq7x,CRCasper,4,Tue Jul 21 15:40:22 2015 UTC,I think the HDR is done pretty well. Have you tried cropping out the roof thing? I feel like it is making the scene feel a touch cramped. Lovely model and backdrop though!
shootingcars,3dzq7x,dacxint,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:35:34 2015 UTC,yes but I also wanted some of those clouds in there cause it was reflecting the light from the sunset. I'll try a tighter crop when I get home.
shootingcars,3dzq7x,imsoupercereal,2,Tue Jul 21 15:41:09 2015 UTC,"I'm in no way a pro so take what I have to say with a pinch of salt.  The HDR is on the verge of being overdone, but it's cool that you've experimented with it. Also, I think the reflections and orange indicator are too distracting.  As a side note, I didn't realise how slick an all-black Tesla was."

shootingcars,3dt02x,dacxint,3,Sun Jul 19 04:11:54 2015 UTC,"Lovely car, really very pretty, some nice photos in there and some has the potential to be great photos, I'll just point out a few things I would have done differently. Please don't be offended, I'm not implying you're photos aren't good, as everyone has their own style, I'm simply sharing my perspective so feel free to try them out if you wish.   White Balance - see how some of these are indoor and some are outdoor, notice how the indoor photos has a warmer hue whereas the outdoor ones are cooler? That's because of the artifical lighting in the parking lot tend to give off a warm (yellow) tint, and sunlight and atmosphere tend to give off a cooler (blue, or even purple) tint. These characteristics are good to give a sense of atmosphere, but they have a way of ruining a car's colour. Look up white balance on Google and find some tutorials on how to adjust your camera (if you're shooting straight to JPEG) or how to correct them in post process (if you're shooting RAW). Framing & Angle - look at car photos from the classified ads, then compare them to car magazine front covers or your favourite online car site, something like http://www.speedhunters.com/ is a brilliant example of good automotive photography. See how they differ in style? Classified ads are for the most part shot by amateur photographers with a point and shoot, and the car tends to fill out the whole frame, that's fine when all you want to do is show unadulterated photos to the buyers. But automotive photography on the other hand, is expressive, it stirs emotion, it draws you in on what the photographer wants you to look at. You need to treat the car like a model and find which angle works, and which angles don't, then you need to think whether you want to draw the viewer to a certain point - is it the steering wheel? or the gauge behind it? a fast lens will help here. The Cobra has lovely sweeping lines and bubble fenders, I would try to get nice reflections of them when stationary, and maybe some panning shots of it driving by around a corner. Location, location, location - got the car in a scenic spot? show us how it complements the car. Don't have a nice spot? Find one or get creative with close ups and depth of field so the car pops out from the backdrop. The Background tends to be either a complement to the car or a distraction, it takes experience and skill to turn a distraction into a complement. I would park the car away from others in the parking lot so there are no obstructions or distractions from the other cars. Shoot lots, then filter out the best, then pick THE best few. Those professional photo shoots always results in about a dozen or half a dozen shots being published. We are blessed with memory cards that can hold thousands of photos, but that doesn't mean we should showcase all of them, sometimes not even half of them. Pick, then filter down to just a few of the best. Post processing them and use them to tell a story of discovery and exploration of this wonderful machine. I would narrow down to about 5 to 7 photos from this album. Keep Shooting - most importantly, look at your own photos critically, are you satisfied? what could you have done differently to achieve even better results? pick up that camera, find a location and go shoot another few hundred photos, analyse them and repeat.   Here's a post from Speed Hunter that might give you some ideas: classic car, good use of backdrop, nice well focused close ups, very atmospheric scenes that makes you want to be there.  http://www.speedhunters.com/2014/03/perfect-911-singer/"
shootingcars,3dt02x,dacxint,2,Sun Jul 19 07:28:59 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much for your reply. This is some great info as when I was doing the shoot I didn't have much of a direction and was kinda walking around and trying to find what looked good. Im looking forward to doing another shoot with my car(frs) and my friends car(NB miata) so hopefully I can bring what I learned here to that shoot.   A couple follow ups though, for point number 1. I was working on the white balance and when looking at the album as a whole I see that the hue does change. What should I be aiming for because I kinda just look for a happy middle ground that looks good. Same thing for when I do any other photography Im kinds just guessing on the white balance.   point 2, Im still very new so I'm still learning about composition and framing and all that. I feel like im struggling a little with that, but im hoping with more practice I will figure it out.   For point 3, I agree totally on the location. I wasn't too happy with where we shot but was just because we kinda had to do it then or wait a while. I live in Miami so with the shoot that I plan to do with my friend I'm going to aim for something a bit more scenic.   point 4, I totally agree, I felt like this was way too many photos. I tried to filter  but I had to keep in mind that my brother was trying to sell it and he wanted a lot of different photos. With that said I probably should have been more selective about what I uploaded to flickr.  point 5, definitely trying to find different things to shoot and figuring out what I like, ex portraits or landscapes or cars. But I having a blast doing it while still trying to improve.   Again though thanks so much for the input. This is exactly the kind of thing I wanted to hear. Cheers!"
shootingcars,3dt02x,DumDumDog,2,Sun Jul 19 07:52:57 2015 UTC,"You're welcome, I'm really glad you found that useful. To further clarify some of those points:   White balance setting & correction. According to the info displayed on your flickr album, you're using the Sony Sony a6000 (ILCE-6000) mirrorless. If that's the case, you have a very powerful tool in your hands, don't let anyone tell you otherwise, it'll get you some amazing shots. Point proven here: https://www.flickr.com/cameras/sony/a6000/. Now let's get to checking white balance.     If you shoot in... Actions...    JPEG you NEED to set the white balance before taking any serious pictures. Find a neutral grey card paper and put that secret weapon in your camera bag now. Every time you shoot you need to set your camera to auto-white balance, then take a shot of that grey card. Now go to your camera's menu and turn white balance to manual, and then select the photo you just took of that grey card. From now on, every photo you take while in this mode will be adjusted to that. Check your camera's manual for help.   RAW you can set your camera to aut white balance, then use a software like photoshop or lightroom to correct white balance afterwards when you work on your photos. Google is your friend.     This is the playground, find what works and what doesn't is very much dependent on the car and location. Before you shoot, look at the car by walking around it, do you see any good features? How can you bring the best out of it? Miami must have TONNES of great locations, don't be afraid of cliches, your audience is the WORLD, don't hinder yourself to pleasing just the locals. I, from half way across the world would find the smallest, silliest things of your city beautiful. In light of what you said, I've taken the liberty of picking a few photos from your album and did a little editing on them. Take a look here: http://imgur.com/a/MJV0I Don't give up. What ever category you're shooting. It's all art.   Good luck!"
shootingcars,3dt02x,DumDumDog,2,Sun Jul 19 08:13:12 2015 UTC,"Wow, I love the edits that you put together. It really brings together the background and the car. The way I edited, I felt it was pretty flat or bland honestly that was kinda the point as I didn't want to go crazy since the photos were supposed to be for an ad. I should have continued to edit them for my own purpose though and been a little bit more creative. I would be doing that right now but I'm waiting for a flight to Chicago. Once I get back though I'm going to revisit, re-edit, and be more selective about what I should be uploading.   Also about the focus point, it's one of those thing that I keep overlooking. And actually when I was editing the images. I kept looking at the headlight to make sure it was in focus and majority of the time it wasn't, which kept annoying me. I need to spend more time while there to make sure that the focus is on point as well as checking the corners so that I make sure to not include anything I don't want in the frame.   But hey, thank you so much for the advice and help. I excited to come back and do that shoot with my friend and my car. I just need to convince my friend to wash his car so that we can get it done."

shootingcars,3d54u6,ponyrojo,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:32:07 2015 UTC,"2. Not making sure the car is spotless. Not entirely true. If I'm shooting, let's say, an off-road rock crawler, the dirtiness kinda adds to the whole off-road theme. It's also possible to pull off a wet car in the rain really well.  4. Not using a tripod. Not true. There are situations that call for it but it shouldn't even be on the list.  5. Not getting down low for the best angles. Kinda true but the best angles aren't always from down low.  1 and 3 are pretty much spot on."
shootingcars,3d54u6,luscious827,2,Mon Jul 13 18:00:23 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  The whole tripod thing is great for properly lining up a shot or if you're incorporating long exposures, but I wouldn't really call it a must."

Generally if you're going on a photoshoot, you should wash your car, but there are times you might pick up dirt on the way to your location so you'll want to wipe it off. Also it doesn't help that the image he used was a wet car which is okay to shoot."

shootingcars,3d1332,dotyy,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:43:34 2015 UTC,"There is so much that goes into these types of shots. We're talking 7-8+ exposures with different lighting positions, hours of post work and lots of gear. There isn't a tutorial out there that will be as beneficial as shooting until you go crazy. Tons of practice, studying others' work and watching channels like Phlrean on Youtube will take you as far as you want to take it. Pick one thing you want to concentrate on, such as lighting,  and practice at it as much as you can. Start simple and work your way up."

Quick question on light painting as well, I understand that multiple exposures go into this, but I've struggled with getting all the exposures to line up (despite being on a tripod that hasn't moved). I've resorted to using three shot bursts in bracket mode, but it limits my exposures to 3 to light paint and it's not enough.   Is the only solution to use a remote shutter? as in remote shutter, light paint, and repeat?   Thanks :)"
shootingcars,3d1332,berntford,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:52:48 2015 UTC,Yep. The easist way is with a remote shutter. I rely on it for pretty much every shot I take. Instagram is @jordancolephotos

shootingcars,3crfbl,Morocco10,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:16:32 2015 UTC,"I like the car, and the processing is nice, but I'm really not a fan of the composition.   I personally would have gotten in tighter and filled more of the frame with the car or, if you're going to stay that far back shift the car more to the right of the frame. I'm not saying ""thou must always follow the rule of thirds"" but in the case I think you should have.   Putting more space in front of the car than behind always looks so much more natural.  Like I say, I think it's a fairly solid image, but just try a quick crop and see what you think, personally I believe it'll make for a stronger image."

shootingcars,3ch8rz,imadamb,4,Wed Jul 8 04:45:17 2015 UTC,"No I meant like, train wrecks, accidents. Supposedly unused tracks and all of a sudden a train is upon the shoot and disaster strikes. Like the Midnight Rider film, where a crew member was killed. And the fitness trainer that was reportedly doing a photoshoot in LA earlier this year. Or in Santa Barbara, late last year, people shooting a sunset on the tracks. There was another pair that I remember but can't confirm details so I'll leave them out. It's a risk that's extra risky. Lives at stake risky, not just the photographers."

shootingcars,3ch8rz,MGJon,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:05:13 2015 UTC,"Wicked photos.  I'm no professional or anything, but here's my 2 cents.  In some of those photos I personally found that it was too hard to actually pick out the subject (the car) in the photo because there was so much going on in the background or the car was being overpowered by another object.  Not sure if that makes any sense, but it's a common thing I see with car shots where the photographer has a conflicting background.  It could also be the fact that the hellcat is such a bland color that kind of gets lost in the photo... I'm not quite sure, but I do love the crispness of the image!  Most likely better than I could do in the same setting."
shootingcars,3cc0gc,insepsis,5,Mon Jul 6 19:02:49 2015 UTC,A circular polarizer would do wonders for this. I would do a few exposures and blend them to remove the reflections.
shootingcars,3cc0gc,Veyron109,6,Mon Jul 6 20:28:14 2015 UTC,I have 3 CPLs sitting around. Sadly I was visiting the showroom and snapped a photo really quickly before I had to leave. It was a very unplanned shot.   Here is the before (Its still a work in progress if you see my Flickr page) I have spent some time removing reflections but it will take a few more hours to get them all removed. Didn't even have a tripod with me.    It's not paid work or client work so I am keeping my editing pretty conservative time-wise and would have prepped much better if it was an actual photo job :)

shootingcars,3cbi6l,Nostalgic_Japanese,2,Mon Jul 6 16:52:42 2015 UTC,"You have a few options in addition to moving to Sony.   If you want to keep your current body, you could always look into a canon 85mm 1.8 for that longer focal length look or Tokina wide angles for interior/location shots (both sub-500). That being said, those lenses both work on all crop sensor Canons so you could use them if you upgraded to a T4i/5i/6/6i later down the road.   You could also try keeping your 50 and shooting with it stopped down to f/2 to 2.8 range and it'll get noticeably sharper. That being said, the body is more to blame when it comes to AF speed in this case. I used a 50 1.8 plastic fantastic stopped down to f/2.8 on a 5DMKIII to shoot this and it came out fine   If you're serious about moving forward with shooting and look at investing in lenses, I'd look at a 24-70 or 70-200 if you're going for snappy AF (but those should also be paired with a slightly newer body when budget allows).   Unfortunately I cant help much with a move to the Sony ecosystem."
shootingcars,3cbi6l,XM62X,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:10:58 2015 UTC,"I also noticed that fringing was really bad on the 50 as well. Does this mainly happen because of the body or because of the lens? 90% of the time I have to manually remove it because PS will only reduce it, and often times do nothing.  If it's the body causing it, I may use the money to upgrade."
shootingcars,3cbi6l,XM62X,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:33:00 2015 UTC,The chromatic aberration is there on any entry level 50mm and if you spring for Lightroom on Creative Cloud it'll take it (almost) all off for you. The amount of fringing decreases as you stop down from f/2 until about f/8 when it kicks back in somewhat until f/22. Fortunately/unfortunately that's lens-based so you'll see it on any body if it's bright out or the subject is back lit.
shootingcars,3cbi6l,airplaneshooter,2,Tue Jul 7 05:45:04 2015 UTC,"Grab an old 35mm f/2.  Noisy little bugger, slow AF...but great bang-for-your buck."

shootingcars,3c9ygc,Smkthtsht,3,Mon Jul 6 06:42:42 2015 UTC,"A relatively small image with quite a bit of .JPG compression makes it hard to make out any details so I'm not sure if it's that or that it's just a bit out of focus, but it's soft either way.  With everything else being desaturated so much the tail lights definitely draw the eye away from anything else despite them not being an especially interesting part of the car.  There's odd green/blue coloring on the tail lights too, but I'm not sure if that's from a polarizer filter or what.  The framing and composition is nice though; no complaints there."

shootingcars,3c88b5,dag1nger,2,Sun Jul 5 20:40:22 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately a lot of it comes from taking better pictures in th first place. Takin the Instagram approach to try and make a picture good doesn't really work. Every time you bring your camera up to your face, think about what you are wanting to capture. Look around the frame in your viewfinder for things that don't belong or will detract from the image. (orange cone, white suv) with digital it's way too easy to try and take a ton of shots hoping to end up with a few good ones, but it should be the other way around. Think about the shot, move around.

shootingcars,3c88b5,Smkthtsht,1 point,Mon Jul 6 06:38:27 2015 UTC,"First, learn and apply the rule of thirds on every picture. Sometimes you can can break the rule. Remember that the better is the picture from the camera, less work you have to do in photoshop. Sometimes i hear friends saying ""oh don't worry, I will get rid of that with photoshop"". Then you realize that you just spent 30 minutes fixing something that could have been done by taking another picture. I've learned a lot from youtube, but if you aren't thah experienced with the photoshop interface, checkout www.lynda.com . Checkout the list of tutorials(PS essential training) They have videos of 3-5 minutes, And I can say that u are going to learn a lot from there! (A LOT!) Is not free, but it worth it. So go to Lynda and learn something new! They also have photography classes as well. Wish u the best! Sorry for my bad english, I'm puertorican haha. Nice pictures btw!!!Keep going....

shootingcars,3c6mor,twospooky,3,Sun Jul 5 09:40:09 2015 UTC,"Take up analog photography if you're too lazy to learn how to edit. And even then, editing on your own is still a very distinct possibility. Not trying to edit is a colossal mistake, even more so considering that it really helps you to learn to be a better photographer. You'll notice your mistakes more and learn to correct them while you shoot. Also, making photos better is trivial with most modern software - tweaking just a few sliders - the same few, every time - will result in better photos ~75% of the time. Obviously it takes time to work out what all of the things in software do, but starting out is really easy. Even more so if you have some sort of RAW mode on your camera, but it's far from mandatory.   Other than that, very standard problems arise.    Something needs to be sharp, and it cannot be a random thing. If the only sharp thing in your picture is a rear view mirror, it had better be an extremely interesting and important rear view mirror.  Composition! Learn some tricks like the rule of thirds and adhere to them like superglue. Only when you've mastered the standard rules of composition can you start trying to ""be more creative."" As an example: #2 is fine. #15 is painful.  And for god's sake, be more critical of yourself. I'm not looking through 36 unedited, mostly random pictures. Pick and choose. Give us five. That's a good place to start: choose five from these pictures that you like the most. Why do you like them the most?"

Yes, I understand that one of your points was to get criticism, but I hope you don't need us to tell you that (or why) #14 doesn't work.

My only critique would be to change away from the moody lighting once in a while (I know it's personal taste, though) and shoot with just a little more extra space left (at least on the first photo).   If you hadn't asked for any critique, I would've left it with a simple upvote.  Not bad photos, by any means."

You either expose for the shadows and blow out that background, or expose for the highlights, and leave the car a dark lump.  One of the few instances where properly done HDR would do this justice."

shootingcars,3ayzih,Witherkay,2,Thu Jun 25 11:42:38 2015 UTC,"So I edit primarily in Lightroom and the easiest (and best IMO) way to take color out of certain areas or to edit certain areas is with the Adjustment Brush.   On a shot like this where I want the car to be it's original color and everything else to be black and white, I take the brush tool and fill in everything but the car, making sure to zoom in and not accidentally clip part of the car but get the edges right up to the car.   After filling the areas I desaturate the brush fill so that it pulls all color out and then I normally will add some noise and blur to that area just to bring a bit more focus on to the car."

I ma not sure how I would feel about it if there were no other cars in it.  Maybe crop in close to the front wheel?
shootingcars,3a0x6m,adudeguyman,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:57:40 2015 UTC,Thank you! I probably should have just opened up the aperture a bit more as /u/luscious827 suggested. If there were not other cars it would probably be better but since it was at a car meet my options for composition were limited.

shootingcars,39yzve,johnnytaquitos,1 point,Tue Jun 16 04:08:36 2015 UTC,"Photographing motorcycles is a funny thing.  Backgrounds, while important in car photography, are crucial with motorcycles, because so much more of the background is going to come through.  That train, while cool (I like the flag), is competing with the motorcycle.  Part of that is that you shot at ƒ/11.0.  I'm not a huge bokeh fanatic, but I would have stopped up to at least ƒ/4.5, or maybe even larger, to try to get the train to fade more into the background, giving more separation between your bike and it.  Other quibbles is that the framing is quite tight around the back tire, I would have not cropped so close, or framed different.  And, as someone else pointed out, the bland POV is killing this.  In this case, getting lower would have done much more to create interest.  Sorry for the long post, overall I do like this, I swear!"
shootingcars,39yzve,ponyrojo,2,Wed Jun 17 15:16:15 2015 UTC,Thanks all for the input. I shoot cars. I shot this image waiting on the trains to move in the background. I was going for a motion blur but they never moved that day (hence the f11) and I had to change locations. I did other location that turned out a lot better than this image. If you look at the flickr gallery you can see some of the images.
shootingcars,39uige,I_DRINK_CREAMER,3,Sun Jun 14 22:04:57 2015 UTC,"I like your shot in general, but I think all the black on the right side draws too much attention away from the car.   Furthermore, photography is one of my hobbies, but I'm quite new to this sub. How did you pull this one off?"
shootingcars,39uige,zarex95,1 point,Mon Jun 15 07:45:13 2015 UTC,Ok thanks for the critique! And I'm not really sure how to fix the black though.  And to get this shot I had my DSLR on shutter priority (S for Nikon and Tv for Canon) and used continuous focus and kept the center focus point on the center of the car while it was moving so the car was kept sharp in the frame and the background had motion blur.  Also it helps to be in Beverly Hills where you can practice on an abundance of exotic cars. :P

shootingcars,39ktjb,SteiniDJ,2,Fri Jun 12 15:28:23 2015 UTC,But panning precludes detail. My edit was a 2 minute quickie.

shootingcars,39ktjb,SteiniDJ,1 point,Sat Jun 13 01:29:48 2015 UTC,In my opinion if you want to shoot this wide and really give a sense of speed you have to shoot even a slow shutter. I love the wide!   I would say get down to 1/8th - 1/13th and you would be cooking with gasoline :)
