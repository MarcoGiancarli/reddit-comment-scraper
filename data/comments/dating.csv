dating,3e2vzx,mistnimbus29,3,Tue Jul 21 15:21:08 2015 UTC,"So you never had the 'exclusive' conversation with either of them so you think it's ok to see other people. The problem with that assumption is that either or both of them may be thinking that you've never had the conversation because it isn't an issue that needs to be discussed.   There's nothing wrong with saying to people that you start seeing that you don't want to be exclusive right now. The error here (I think) is that the lack of conversation has two possible assumptions and you have no way of knowing what they're thinking since you never had the conversation!  I'm not condemning you, nor do I think you're a bad person but you need to have the conversation, now. They might be fine with the way things are, they might not but if they don't KNOW how things are then that's a problem."
dating,3e2mmk,Havokboi,2,Tue Jul 21 14:07:23 2015 UTC,"You're 24 years old. If you didn't put your age I'd think you were between 15-17 with a silly post like this. Ask the girl out. Whatever happens, the earth will keep spinning after the fact and you'll be fine. Hell, you may even learn how to control your emotions like an adult."
dating,3e2fu0,yoitsme14,3,Tue Jul 21 13:07:10 2015 UTC,"You need way more details for anyone to be of any help, but I want to caution you on something. Calling her the ""girl of your dreams"" is nice and all, but it sets you up to be a doormat if you put her on a pedestal like that. Instead you should see her as an equal."
dating,3e2e4s,dadywarbucks231,2,Tue Jul 21 12:50:54 2015 UTC,"You are young, and I've often heard that ""breaks"" are just the appetizer for ""break ups."" You need to learn a little bit of emotional control, I understand that may be difficult because of your history with being cheated on but you need to realize two things:  It is 2015. Cheating is alive and vibrant, possibly more than ever (but probably not, it's really just easier to get caught with social media and all that nonsense). Why is this? Well pop culture loves promiscuity and makes it seem ""cool"" for one, and for two, things like tinder make it easier than ever to just dial-a-hookup. Judging by your post I don't think you're 18 yet, or you've just turned it. If I'm wrong, you have some serious growing up to do. Anniversary in her bio? That is some middle school shit and just shows her how insecure you are about the relationship. Based on her reaction, y'all probabaly shouldn't get back together.  Lastly, ""I love you"" is not an end all be all problem solver."
dating,3e1kop,TheDeltaFlight,2,Tue Jul 21 06:36:21 2015 UTC,"You don't have to go out to 'look' for girls specifically, if you're outside and you think someone seems nice, just go up and say hi. Most girls appreciate that. You can even find someone in an elevator, I did ! :)"

dating,3e1kop,Grammaton485,-1,Tue Jul 21 07:12:53 2015 UTC,"Dude, real talk.  Put yourself outside your comfort zone and stop looking for women. as someone who was entirely in your position earlier, if you stop looking, they'll come to you. and DON'T BE TIMID.  that's the worst thing a guy can do. a female friend of mine said ""it's not the nice guy that finishes last.  it's the timid one"""
dating,3dzkc3,throwaway42069213,4,Mon Jul 20 20:24:36 2015 UTC,"Ok, I don't exactly have an answer... But I suspect you are just enjoying the hunt and then realize you aren't interested in committing. I think it is natural for a man to go after something they want, and that game, those first few weeks of interest and attraction are usually really fun. As a woman, I am usually building up expectations on what happens in those first few weeks. Example, if he texts a lot and is eager to talk, I assume that as a boyfriend he will be attentive. I think it's hard for a man to see beyond what is right infront of them. They are feeling something in that moment, and that's it. So, don't beat yourself up over it, but take a minute to think about what expectations are being set by your words and actions. If your expectations don't match hers, then let her down gently. Part of me also wants to say that if you aren't interested in pursuing her more once she is interested, then maybe she just isn't the right one.  Sorry for the ramble... Know what you are able to give/want upfront and be honest with your potential partner on what that is."

I don't want give people the idea that I'm just using these girls for the moment but that seems to be the case. I end up feeling really bad when feelings aren't mutual. But i think you are right, maybe they aren't the right ones for me. i just don't like the feeling of leading people on because I really had good intentions."
dating,3dzkc3,hamfraigaar,2,Mon Jul 20 20:56:35 2015 UTC,"I enjoy the thrill of the chase as well. The whole falling in love, the first kiss and yadda yadda. Relationships get old, new feelings don't for obvious reasons. But relationships are great as well. I don't think you're doing anything wrong, but I think that if you think you're leading anyone on, you should just start being honest about your intentions. If they're up for doing it for the moment or seeing where it leads, etc., that's wonderful, and if they aren't, then there's no harm done for either of you."
dating,3dzkc3,birdwingsbeat,2,Mon Jul 20 22:57:20 2015 UTC,"I suggest something similar to what I just told this person HERE. Possibly, for some emotional reason, you're afraid of the actual prospect of getting into and maintaining a real relationship, so you're subconsciously self-sabotaging yourself by turning off from women who actually want you and wasting your time on women who don't."
dating,3dzkc3,SneakyTouchy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:58:52 2015 UTC,"I do not doubt at all that I might have some emotional issues lol ..I think you are right, but the thing is, I'm not afraid of the commitment. I think I'm more afraid of committing to the wrong person and backing out when it's too late. Maybe I just think too much..."
dating,3dzkc3,SneakyTouchy,2,Mon Jul 20 21:10:08 2015 UTC,"I think I'm more afraid of committing to the wrong person and backing out when it's too late.   That's always a risk you'll take. It's literally unavoidable. If everyone could just somehow magically always pick the right person for them, there’d never be divorces. Everyone would just meet, date, then marry one person their entire lives. But that’s not how it works. The only way to never risk committing to the wrong person is to never commit to anyone. Otherwise, you’re just going to have to take a chance sometimes."
dating,3e1ejg,HenryFuckMeTheV,2,Tue Jul 21 05:26:06 2015 UTC,"Just read that all man. Yeah one question though, are you still dating that girl? If not, tell this girl that you are in love with how you feel. It seems like she is shy when it comes to talking about things like that and the only way you're ever going to find out is if you just tell her how you feel. You're not going to accomplish anything by just looking for her signs. Just have a heart to heart with her dude. Who cares if she has a boyfriend, all you're doing is telling her how you feel. It is about you in this case, and your happiness. Tell her, ask her.   Edit; even if you're still with your girlfriend, tell that girl anyways. It's about your happiness"

dating,3dwrn1,anythingbox,2,Mon Jul 20 04:27:13 2015 UTC,Everyone has a different life. There is so much going on like it's the number one priority in life and that is get married and get children. You might have less experience than high schoolers but there isn't to worry. Be sure to look ever forward and don't compare yourself with other OP. Don't let small things ruin your life; instead start thinking what you can change. Look into some OP and stay positive.

Undiagnosed and unwilling to work on the fringe issues associated with it (anxiety and depression), it ended up not working out. But still, I'd encourage you to put yourself out there and would suggest Match.com for your age group.  I'd also encourage you to seek therapy or counseling to work on your personal issues at the same time if you're not already doing that."

dating,3dwrn1,JellySausage,2,Mon Jul 20 09:00:40 2015 UTC,I'm going to say a dating site for you is a bad idea. Women on these sites are for the most part incredibly shallow. You need to find a therapist your comfortable with and then a place/group where you can interact with girls and guys so they get to know you and you them.
dating,3dwrn1,phungus_mungus,-1,Mon Jul 20 09:43:11 2015 UTC,"I would recommend seeing a therapist if you truly have these disorders. It's gonna be on hard mode for you man, and that sucks but it's how it is."

Nothing to identify you guys personally but enough to know what your interests might be and what's nearby. Your ages, city, and how much you want to spend, are you in college ect. Would be helpful as well."
dating,3dzcjd,thatguywhosadick,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:46:52 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I kinda figure that if she is willing to kiss me she'd be into me. We were both a little drunk, so that puts some doubt in my mind. Probably just overthinking, as usual.  She did tell me that her favorite movie is a heavily romantic movie, but I know she also like comedies. We both have a similar taste in music, mainly rock. She also likes indie rock too. Nearby there is a cinema, multiple restaurants, bars, a beach (a bus ride away). We live in a small town like 15 minutes away from Glasgow, so that is always a possibility. We'd need to take the train though. We're both in uni, 20, and I don't really mind how much I spend. I'd just like it to be a good night!  How do I ask her? I figure just text asking what's up to strike up a conversation, then ask when I feel the time is right. Rather than asking out the blue, which I assume might startle her a bit?  EDIT: Actually, we're both going to a work night out kinda thing that's later at night on Saturday. Is it a good idea to ask if she wants to go on a date before the night out, then head straight there since I know we're both off or better to just leave it open for her to choose a time?"
dating,3dzcjd,thatguywhosadick,2,Mon Jul 20 20:03:01 2015 UTC,"Either turn off your phone or cut off your thumbs for the time being. Let things simmer down and use Saturday as a way to test the waters. It will allow you to figure your shit out and see where you stand. Depending on how late you are out either ask her to get a drink/bite to eat, or offer to walk her back to her car/flat/train station around when people start leaving. If she says yes to this then nothing other than dropping your kilt and taking a shit in the middle of the road could fuck this up. As far as dates go, movies, going to the pub, and lunch should be good until you can figure her out and dial it in to her tastes. Good luck."
dating,3dzcjd,The-CiscoKid,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:00:17 2015 UTC,"Ask to hang out one night, then bring a blanket and take a ride down to the beach  EDIT: talk about anything, then let her kiss you. If you're like 15 min in and nothing's happened, make a move."
