I learned quickly that it's MY classroom and it doesn't matter if I stop the lesson to joke around a little or to have a little fun with the students. Don't do this EVERY day, but make a habit of just having some fun every now and again.  Also, call and/or email parents during the first 2 weeks. You'd be surprised what you can learn about a student just by talking with a parent for a few minutes. It also makes it less awkward when you need to get in touch with them later on.  I think the former behavior comes from college. Some people get into teaching thinking they can run their room like a lecture-hall. That isn't very effective for ANY grade level including high school."

Teachers,3e372x,jsu718,2,Tue Jul 21 17:20:10 2015 UTC,"Dream. It doesn't matter the dream, the reality, the reason, the anything... just dream.  Let me tell you a story...  So I do Outdoor Education. This means that basically the world is my classroom. Have you ever taken your students on a field trip to a zoo, park, nature center, or residential camp? I'm the one who greets you, asks if your shoes can get dirty, and snickers when you say ""oh, they won't get that messy"".  Enter a first day fifth grade class from the suburbs. In particular, one student who I will call Suzie. Now Suzie was a quiet student. Very nice, very respectful, very smart, but generally quiet as a church mouse (from my observations up to that point and her teachers' words, I would agree). So imagine my surprise when she says ""oh"", blushes quickly, then raises her hand.  Granted, the question was a simple ""what might we find in the pond today?"" But those first questions can be the hardest questions the students will ever ask. Not to mention, she raised her hand.  So I just smile and say “Yes?”  “Giant Squid.”  I cock an eyebrow, “are you sure?”  “Yep. Maybe…”  “Alright,” I look at the white board again, knowing that she could get this right, “let me ask you a question: where does a Giant Squid live?”  “The ocean.”  “Not ponds?”  “Sometimes?” she asks.  “Maybe they do, let’s think about this. What kind of water is in the ocean?”  She thinks deeply, tilts her head to the side, and begins to chew on her lip. Deep in thought.  Another student chimes in, “salt water!” She bonks herself in the head, the universal sign for ‘I totally knew that’. A glare is expressed, but the eager little boy just beams at me, completely unaware of the little girl behind him.  “Now what type of water is in the pond?” I ask, making sure to look at the girl.  “Not salt water… freshwater?” she says eagerly.  “Very good, so do you still think you might find a Giant Squid?” I smile, waiting for her to make the connection.  “Maybe.”  “Maybe?”  “Anything can happen.”    An hour and a half later    “Mr. Chris,” says the little girl, walking over to me, “I caught one.”  “A Giant Squid?” I ask.  “Yep,” she shows me her net, which contains something obviously not a Giant Squid, “or maybe not.”  “Maybe not,” I laugh, “you told me you were going to get me a Giant Squid. I want to see one by the time we leave.”  “What will you give me if I catch one?” she offers a shifty smile.  This catches me off guard, “Ummm… I’m I’ll buy you a coke.” The vending machine at camp might as well serve liquid gold for how the students always look at it.  “Really?” her eyes go wide.  “Yep.”  “I don’t think I’m going to find one in the pond,” she says, dejected.  “How about this,” I say, “if you catch a Giant Squid anywhere. Any time in your life… I’ll buy you a coke.” Her eyes get wide again and a smile begins to form, “in fact, if you ever bring me a Giant Squid, I will buy you an entire coke machine.”  Her jaw practically falls into her net, “really? REALLY!?”  I smile and hold out my hand. She looks at it, takes it, and gives one firm shake, “remember, you promised,” and then saunters off to the pond.    This is why I’ll remember her: She’s a dreamer.  She is the future.  I believe that everyone starts out with an inherent sense of exploration, a sense of learning, a sense of… dreaming, I guess.  Whether that takes shape in the people who seem to be born with a paintbrush in their hands, or those who’ll publish twenty books in their lifetime, or maybe those who want to know why that bird likes that particular bush, or ones that want to set foot on every continent.  Dreams.  Dreams of bigger and better things. Of new images they can create, words they can fashion into tales, or stories they can fill their lives with.  I know those who claim we have lost this sense of wonder, exploration, or whatever you want to call it. They say the internet, the TV, smartphones, video games, helicopter parents, or pop culture has suffocated that fire.  I disagree.  But I’m an optimist at heart. I believe that everyone has that sense, has that deep seeded desire for something more, for something else. Who hasn’t looked at the sky and said “I wonder how many stars are out there?” or popped on the Discovery Channel and mused “I wish I could see that in person.”  Kids are the most open with this. They admit these feelings, ask these questions, and try to take in everything they can.  Adults are afraid of those things. I’ve had science teachers take notes while I’m teaching, and I’ve had parents tell little Johnny to ask Mr. Chris a question for them. Why? Because they’re afraid of not knowing, they’re embarrassed to admit they don’t know as much as me.  I’m the opposite.  If I have a question, I have to ask. I have to know why? How? When? Where? I acknowledge there are things I don’t know, much like the students I teach. Because we all started out not knowing anything, and how else do we learn?  We ask.  That’s why I work with kids; Because they’re not worried. Why should they care if the dad next to them knows the difference between a Hellgrammite and a Leech? Does it matter that the Ph.D in Physics can’t catch a Salamander to save his life?  No, because they’re here to learn.  So why do the adults care?  I can’t answer that question, nor do I really want to. Because many people just cannot and do not understand this little girl. This little girl who, come Hell or high water, just knows she’s going to find a Giant Squid.  If only so Ranger Chris will buy her a coke machine."

I spent several days at the beginning of the year setting up reading and writing notebooks and teaching expectations for using them.  I'm so glad I did this!  It made the rest of the year run more smoothly.  They always had a place for their assignments and didn't lose them.  I also spent the first few weeks of school meeting them at their lockers (luckily all of my students' lockers were grouped together) to make sure they had all of the required materials before they came to my room.  I also taught them to free read or free write when they were finished with their assignment.  My students loved this!

Form good relationships early on. 6th grade is a big transition year for a lot of 6th graders, because they go from one teacher for all core classes to 4 different teachers.  They are emotional creatures and when you have a kid acting out or freaking out you need to calmly de escalate the situation. No yelling, no arguing, no negotiating, no disrespecting. Easier said than done, but crucial.   If you ever have the chance to be a ""student"" for a day in your school you will soon realize how much they sit all day and how much that sucks. I try to get kids moving a bit when possible. Ex. Guided note taking/vocab: place definitions or explanation on sheets all around the room and they have to go up to each one with a clip board and fill in the blanks.

Now I have some very nice posters to hang up around the room every year! And they are way more original than the generic ones you get at a teacher store (Especially since those are usually way over priced)  I also covered my bulletin boards with a clearance flat sheet from Walmart. Much cheaper than paper, and it makes the room look so much nicer than a blank cork board.

Teachers,3e50fp,bunnyfitz26,2,Wed Jul 22 03:58:37 2015 UTC,"Well a ""reading teacher"" is usually in a school that's decompartmentalized so they teach reading while other teachers are in charge of other subjects. That means you're usually teaching a 90 minute uninterrupted reading block that includes a lesson, some sort of practice, reading out loud, and the having the kids read independently while you pull small groups and conference in (this is a reading workshop school). If it's not a reading workshop school you're focusing on a reading unit out of a textbook that covers a multitude of reading skills. Either way you need to pull small groups that focus on specific skills. You are also responsible for ""word work"" that teaches them phonics or phonemic awareness. Depending on the school you may also be in charge of iii which is an intensive reading block for struggling students lasting 30 minutes. Also Depending on how your school compartmentalizes the subjects you may also be in charge of writing. Now sometimes people talk about their ""reading teacher"" as someone who just purely does small group pull out for struggling students in a particular grade set. Then you would just be following a script and doing what the program tells you to do. Easy peasy lemon squeazy.  I hope this answered some of your questions and just didn't give you a bunch of information that didn't make sense."

I always provide an actual lesson that anyone could easily follow and you'd be surprised at how manny substitutes just do their own thing. Very infuriating. On a similar note, have a few spare plans for any age level/class just in case you have nothing. If a teacher has an emergency they may not have the time to prepare anything. If a teacher doesn't leave you with a list of classroom rules don't trust the kids when they say ""Ms. Teacher always lets me work in the hall."" A substitute needs to have pretty tight boundaries since there is little to no rapport."

I've been on both sides of this situation and as a current substitute teacher it really surprises me (and to be honest really irritates me) when I'm left a lesson plan by a teacher who for whatever reason not only thinks that I as a sub know the subject matter well but well enough to teach the class. I would never expect a sub who is qualified in English or History for example to be able to teach my Grade 12 Physics class. Yet sometimes that's the lesson I'm left. Luckily I've always been able to fake it, but relearning high school Calculus in the 5 minutes between classes is a pain in the ass."

Teachers,3e44nx,gimmefantastic,0,Wed Jul 22 02:28:25 2015 UTC,I subbed for three years before I was a teacher and I would never have handed out supplies from a closet that the teacher didn't give me permission to give to the kids. And if they made a big mess I cleaned and put things back in place before I left. and I understand messes happen like one time I subbed pre-k and one of the kids found a big bottle of glitter during craft time and it went everywhere before I could get to him. I felt so bad for the mess I got some tape and picked up as much as I could and wrote her an apology. I don't call subs back that leave huge messes because it shows me that they have no control and subs that leave my room semi the way it was I totally love.
Teachers,3e44nx,TTUgirl,4,Wed Jul 22 02:40:51 2015 UTC,Don't fall asleep in class. The kids will take pictures/video and show it to their teacher the next day.  Have a plan for when the teacher's lesson plan isn't enough to keep the students occupied. I've had some subs tell interesting life stories. Maybe have a game ready. Clean the room. Whatever can keep them busy.

Teachers,3e44nx,Scienceninja3212,2,Wed Jul 22 00:44:50 2015 UTC,"1) Dress like a teacher. That means slacks, nice shirt, tie, etc. Look like you are going on an interview for a teaching job, because you just might be and not even realize. You shouldn't be confused for one of the students. 2) Stick to the lesson plan.  Classroom teachers have a certain amount wiggle in the plans usually but not for you to go off doing your own thing. 3) Students are like sharks/bears/honey badgers: covered in teeth and claws they smell fear.  Be confident and in charge.  That's not to say be an a**hole, but don't let them walk all over you  simply because you aren't the regular teacher. 4) Be friendly, but you aren't there to be their friend. 5) Try and be positive and upbeat, even if the lesson is something simple or in your opinion boring. 6) I like when the sub leaves me a quick note detailing what happened. Can be as simple as: Class was good/bad, Johnny was helpful, Jimmy wasn't on task."
Teachers,3e44nx,DarthBall,2,Tue Jul 21 23:13:18 2015 UTC,"My best advice for a guy subbing in middle school is to be firm and consistent. I see so many male subs in my school who come in and act too friendly with the kids, joking with them, etc.   Look into the scoreboard game from Whole Brain Teaching, and play it to give the kids a chance to earn a 5 minute game or something at the end of class. If I was subbing, I would use this every day!   As for clothing, dress professionally but not stuffy. You can wear polos and button-ups with khakis. Ties aren't necessary unless you just like to wear them.  And as others have said, follow whatever instructions the teacher leaves you as closely as possible. Leave the teacher a note letting them know how things went (good or bad). It is not a bad idea to have some ""emergency plans"" to use just in case the teacher doesn't, whether that's a video with questions you can give afterwards or whatever it may be."
Teachers,3e44nx,boringmom,2,Wed Jul 22 02:57:38 2015 UTC,"Take note of who goes to the bathroom and the times.  Do not let more than one out at a time.  Students will take advantage of you not knowing who they are.    If you do not have a seating chart, create one ASAP for each period (usually kids sit in their assigned seats, so you just draw a picture and have them put their names on the correct seat).  This will help with names, attendance, and with behavior issues.    Bribery candy will go a long way, but so does praise.  Praise is easier to keep from being an issue in class.  Compliment a student for doing something right, even if you don't know his/her name.    Have 4-5 rules for your ""classroom"" to use in case the teacher doesn't leave the rules for you.  Rules should be simple and self explanatory (ex: Follow all directions or Stay in your seat until you have permission to leave).  Have a clear idea of what you will do if a student breaks a rule (progressive discipline plan).    If possible, talk to your neighbor teachers ahead of time, to see if they will be able to take a student on ""time out"" from your class.  This allows you to remove a disruptive student without having to resort to a referral to the office.  Know the names and room numbers of the teachers who will help you."
Teachers,3e44nx,AwesomeLandia,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:27:29 2015 UTC,"Be brief. Be gone.   Set yourself apart by absorbing the material so that you are able to speak on it for questions.   Teaching is a performance and you must be ready to improvise.   Take the roll call time to get to know who your students are (name and plans after high school work best).   Moreover, be a moving target. Work the floor. A number of schools are allowing phone usage so be aware of your words and temperament.   And bring some atmosphere with you, meaning, speak and act at a level above the milieu already in the class.   Never single anyone out but also call attention to language. Be sure to set the tone about what is allowed socially and verbally.   And the best way to build rapport with that age group is to connect on a linguistic level...   Good luck!"

If the teacher left notes with their rules follow them like if they don't allow talking or cellphones don't give into their begging and crying you can get yourself into difficult situations when you go against a teacher's specific behavior expectations they know if their class is difficult and will usually leave expectations that keep them under control. I had an 8th grade study period class that if you let them move from their assigned seats or let them talk they would rage wildly out of control and I had so many office referrals for that class and I had to leave very specific instructions on how to handle that class and subs who didn't follow it had some big issues come up that required principal intervention to get control of the class.
Teachers,3e44nx,TTUgirl,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:31:29 2015 UTC,"Follow the lesson plan is definitely the biggest thing.  You need to check with the school or district policies on dress code. Some schools require men to wear ties daily, at my school the teachers usually wear jeans but a sub could easily get away with khakis and a polo.

Teachers,3e44nx,kayteearr,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:38:52 2015 UTC,"Be prepared for teachers to not have left a plan. It is always a good idea to get there early so that if the absence is unexpected and there is no plan you can get with a nearby teacher with the same area/subject to come up with something. Content is key. The better you get to know the material and teach it properly the easier your day will go. When the teacher just leaves a worksheet that won't be enough, that is a perfect time for you to teach how to do it before handing it to them."

Teachers,3e303y,v_logs,12,Tue Jul 21 15:50:52 2015 UTC,"Hi!  I teach 9-10 grade social studies, but I think folders can be a great way to keep kids organized regardless of subject. I use this with my lowest level kids only and it really helps keep them on top of things.  They get a new manila folder for each chapter that they label with their name and chapter title.  One kid is tasked with passing them out daily, and that rotates.  Once the chapter is over, I keep them.  This is for midterm/final purposes, so if your big tests are not cumulative, you could toss them.  They do not bring these folders home, generally speaking.  I know once they go home, they won't come back.  At the end of the chapter, they get a checklist and papers NEED to be in order to get full credit.   I can't stress that enough.  Otherwise, you will be sifting through paper for hours.  They get ~3 points per sheet and it's a great grade booster, especially since most either don't test well or don't care, but don't want to fail either.  I know that this system will sound baby-ish to some since they're high school students, but the kids I have need a system and this works for them."
Teachers,3e303y,thepants28,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:57:45 2015 UTC,Wow thank you! This sounds awesome since I don't have any textbooks to go home and most things that go home are lost.
Teachers,3e303y,TTUgirl,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:59:38 2015 UTC,Me and my co-teacher did this but just labelled it with their name and put them in hanging file boxes by their table number. The box stayed under their lab table or set off to the side of we needed more room and all of their papers stayed in there for the six weeks unless they were turned in for a grade. We'd dump the after every grade period. In another class we had them bring two inch binders and each unit had a colored cover sheet and students kept them in the room. New papers were dated and put in each unit and we had a table that we passed out to the for them to write down the grades from their binders. One side had a table for check grades (after ten were added up for a final grade) a the other side for numerical grades. So you never had to grade piles of binders or lose loose papers.
Teachers,3e303y,CatShirtFTW,7,Wed Jul 22 03:03:21 2015 UTC,"One of the things my high schoolers struggled with was organization. This was especially true for at-risk students and kids with (certain) learning disabilities.  I set up a crate system in my classroom to help students stay organized. All of their graded materials went back into a hanging file folder with their name on it in a crate for each hour at the back of the room. I found that once the materials left the room, there wasn't much chance of them coming back, so I figured whatever I could do to help the organizational process was a plus.  At the end of each unit or marking period or even the semester, the students cleaned and ordered the materials from the hanging file folder and transferred it to their personal binders.   Also, a huge thing that helped (but was kind of a 'duh' moment in how long it took me to figure it out) was providing students all of the course materials with the 3-holes already punched. No waiting at the desk for each student to do his/her own paper, no losing the papers because they were too lazy to get up and hole punch them. Pre-hole-punched.   I even started using mirrored margins (it's an option in Word, OpenOffice, etc.) as I created the documents to make it easier for me to hole punch while I was waiting at the copier.  Having the holes already punched also helps struggling students figure out which side of the assignment is the front (sounds so stupid, but is actually super necessary and helpful)."
Teachers,3e303y,gimmefantastic,5,Tue Jul 21 18:48:30 2015 UTC,"I did this last year, but with a notebook rather than a binder.  My one piece of advice is to keep a chart up with what should be on what page & the date (like ""7/21 Warm Up pg. 1"" etc)"

Teachers,3e303y,unisandpearls,5,Tue Jul 21 19:57:08 2015 UTC,"I don't do this at the moment since I am teaching on-level, but here's one method to do a binder-check:  Create a check-list to hand out at the beginning of the unit. If you are really organized you can list the assignments AND due-dates along with the dates for quizzes/tests. You can use this in two ways. Either collect work along the way by stamping their check-list or let them turn in the entire thing at the end of the unit (on test day maybe).  When making the checklist make sure you leave some blanks in case you want to add something in and they can write it down.  Edit: I just wanted to add that I don't do this because I expect them to take a little more responsibility for their items. They don't get binder-checks in college OR in a job. However, I do think that providing a method of organization is necessary. I provide binders (they are left over binders that are perfectly good) and I go over how it might be best to organize their work. That's it. If they are missing something at a later point I make a comment to them about getting more organized, but I'm not about to go out of my way to assist them. I know from personal experience that it wouldn't help anyways. I ignored my teachers for the longest time until I took the matter into my own hands (as I started teaching). Doing this for one class won't change their habits. They have to want to change those habits and if losing out on a grade because you are unorganized doesn't do it for them then something else will. Or nothing will and they'll be a slob forever. shrug"

Binder checks are extremely helpful for 9th graders (middle-school is usually very structured for them) and they are much more helpful for students with IEP's that have issues with organization.  Most of the time binder-checks are a last resort method of getting work checked because a lot of teachers find that students just have issues keeping anything except their cellphones. If it was easy to create worksheets that the students could do on their cellphones I would probably do it, but that's another issue entirely."

Teachers,3e303y,Xcsn,4,Tue Jul 21 23:24:26 2015 UTC,"That's great. But some don't.  If my job is to help students learn, and by requiring a binder, I get more students to learn, then maybe that is actually a useful tool. (certainly unnecessary for some, but my goal is to get the most amount of students producing academic growth)  Students should also remember important dates, but by your logic, I should not need to provide reminders for test, homework, projects, etc."
Teachers,3e303y,roger_pct,-1,Tue Jul 21 23:34:15 2015 UTC,Reminding your students of a test is completely different than forcing the entire class to get a binder and be graded on their organization skills rather than the subject.
Teachers,3e303y,Xcsn,3,Tue Jul 21 23:41:52 2015 UTC,"""Student handholding"" is ""student handholding"" big or small.  Now you are making the false assumption that I do binder checks for grades. You probably also have assumed that I check homework for grades.  This is not the case. The only thing that should count for grade is demonstration of material retention/learning. NOT BEHAVIOR  However, grading binders for an alternative look at student behavior to show correlation between behavior and academic performance is an amazing tool. Great data for parent-student-teacher conferences.  But no, my binder checks do not effect the grade in the class."
Teachers,3e4liq,mysillyokcthrowaway,4,Tue Jul 21 22:28:17 2015 UTC,"You didn't explicitly ask for advice, but I can't imagine what else you're looking for with your post, so I will give you some: Don't continue with teaching. You describe teaching as having ""left a bad mark"" on you. You are concerned about stable opportunities. Your gut instinct is to get out. That's two more reasons than you need.  You can find other ways to help children besides teaching. Hopefully, one of these other ways will be a better fit for you."
Teachers,3e4liq,blankenstaff,3,Tue Jul 21 22:52:28 2015 UTC,"Think about tutoring, maybe do some work as a teachers aide? There are lots of ways to work with children in a school. Perhaps going back for certification as a school counselor? If you're soft spoken and uncomfortable with classroom management, that may be an avenue for you."
Teachers,3e4liq,Lulahula01,4,Wed Jul 22 00:21:26 2015 UTC,"Student teaching is not the same as being in charge of your own classroom.  That being said, you need to decide if teaching is really for you....the first few years can be difficult also."
Teachers,3e4liq,bcnc88,3,Wed Jul 22 00:58:27 2015 UTC,"The greatest tragedy of Schools of Education is that everybody passes. Teaching is not for everyone; the best way to decide is to watch effective teaching and ask yourself ""can I be like that?""  If you've never seen it being done, then it's hard to emulate it.  Don't be that guy or gal who does a job because it's all you feel is out there. Teaching is one of those jobs in which you do active damage by not doing it correctly.  Explore your options."
Teachers,3e4liq,BorealYYC,2,Wed Jul 22 04:01:52 2015 UTC,"Sometimes it can be the school culture and difficult people that can make or break your teaching experience. You might consider going older because the younger kids are the more they stress me out, I do best with 5th-8th grade. Some other careers you might look into: there's graduate programs that help prepare you to work in non-traditional education places like museums, science centers, and national parks where you design learning programs or give tours and such so you're still teaching but in a different way and environment. I have also looked into being a Child Life Specialist they work in children's hospitals and help make the stay less scary for children by explaining procedures in a way that a child can understand and bring them toys, read them stories and play video games with them it takes a Masters usually. You might look into Speech therapy or Occupational therapy where you can help children, play with them but you're one on one or small groups. Librarians can have pretty cool jobs in schools or library programs and often get to read or teach children with less of the teacher stress. You can also look into working at camps for children as a camp counselor or running parts of the program like a director. You can also work with special programs like intercity pre-k reading programs, YMCA, CASA, WIC, orphanages and Child Protective services."
Teachers,3e4liq,TTUgirl,2,Wed Jul 22 02:08:50 2015 UTC,"I had a terrible student teaching experience as well. Mine was exacerbated by my having generally bad mental health, but my mentor teachers weren't great, and I had some very challenging classes. My lesson plans were shit and I had very low morale for the whole 10 weeks I was there.   Now though, I've been teaching full time in my own classroom for six months and for the most part, I love it. My lesson plans are still kinda crap, but I'm improving. I'm getting better at classroom management too. My 'teacher voice' has only really come about since I started teaching on my own.  As for the stress of not knowing what to do - this goes away with time. And in any job there'll be times where you've got no clue. You deal the best you can in that moment, and evaluate your behaviour afterwards. My deputy once gave me a great statement that really helped me ""If noone died and nothing burnt down, then it's probably ok"".  You treated the kids fairly - that is 90% of classroom management. You must have been consistent with enforcing the rules and gave some leeway when it was necessary. You did this well enough that multiple students told you. This is a sign of a GOOD teacher, not a bad one."
Teachers,3e4liq,notunprepared,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:48:14 2015 UTC,"I also had a bad experience student teaching. From some of your remarks about ineffective lesson plans and classroom management I am tempted to tell you to find another path. However, if you want to pursue this career angle a bit more I would suggest being a sub and attending some professional development on lesson planning. If you can't cut it as a sub...get out and find a new path."
Teachers,3e4liq,chipsnsalsa13,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:15:26 2015 UTC,"Tbh, when you first start out as a teacher it is always hard.  Even when people are trying to help you, for the most part you just have to practice and get good on your own.  No amount of advice will teach you how to manage a class better than simply practicing a ton.    It sounds to me like since you loved working with kids so much a career in education that isn't a classroom teaching job might be for you."
Teachers,3e5qxe,crystalarrows,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:08:41 2015 UTC,One mistake I made that you shouldn't make is thinking that the students aren't interested in who you are as a person.  Show them a few pics and and tell them about your life for like 5 minutes and let them ask questions.

I noted that everyone listed had the same format for email. FirstnameLastname@schooldistrictinitials.com. So I took a guess and I plugged his name in, and it worked. You said you don't know the spelling...maybe you can take a guess.   You can also contact someone in Human Resources for your district and see if you can get the principal's email through them."

Teachers,3e3r5g,Gypsophillia,2,Tue Jul 21 20:11:34 2015 UTC,"Also, if you reach someone in the office/school/district, they can tell you the correct spelling of the name. That way you can get both things you need at once, and you can choose whether to do paper or email."
Teachers,3e3r5g,bookchaser,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:55:58 2015 UTC,"I would just call during regular business hours and ask for the proper spelling of the interviewer's name. Be upfront and say you want to be sure that your thank you note has the correct information. You might not have been able to reach anyone earlier because some schools have shortened business hours during the summer.   E-mails are fine but I think that a good hand written note would be a better option. Maybe after you get the name, write your card and drop by the school. You can hand it to the interviewer or if they are busy, ask if the secretary can give it to them or leave it in their mail box."
Teachers,3e3r5g,bookchaser,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:20:11 2015 UTC,ok...go to the district's website...look up the school...there will be all the information you need...I used to be in HR and now I teach.  A paper thank you note is much more appropriate and appreciated.

I give parents a copy (even though one was sent home). * I share a brief teacher bio (mostly work experience and education). * I also show parents the textbook, workbook, and other important class materials (we use an organized binder, so I show examples). * I explain how much homework a student should have each night/ week (they always want to know this). * I show my class website and directions for getting there. * I also show them some student work (usually Back to School Night is 3 weeks into the school year, and Open House is 5 weeks before the end). * I also talk about the types of assignments we do in my class. * Finally, I give parents my list of contact information. * If I have time after, I take questions.  Sometimes I have students who show up explain part of the class. * If I get the names of parents and who their student is, I usually show them where their student sits in the class."
Teachers,3e3bkx,AwesomeLandia,2,Tue Jul 21 21:20:23 2015 UTC,"I teach Media Literacy, so I end up planning on doing a 4 minute demo of what the course actually covers - skills, projects, etc.  Then no one sticks to the schedule, so I end up doing mini-conferences with each kid...though over 22 years I've learned that best way to run such a conference is ""so, _____, these are your parents.  What am I about to tell them?""  Then they do all the talking (with a little prompting), and I come off as a masterful teacher who really knows the kids."
Teachers,3e3bkx,hoybowdy,2,Tue Jul 21 21:30:59 2015 UTC,"Our back to school night has decent attendance (at least at my level - 6th grade).  We encourage the students to stay home, since they are middle schoolers and usually are fine to stay and babysit any siblings.  This helps keep it from being overcrowded, as I can't fit 36 kids AND their parents all in my classroom.  The parents receive a copy of their child's schedule, listen to a welcome from the principal in the gym, and then they follow their students schedule, spending about 15 minutes in each classroom.  It helps give them an idea about the rotation their children will follow.  We tend to give a basic introduction to our class, how we grade, expectations regarding late work, redos, absences, etc.  I try to leave about 3 minutes for questions at the end (more if possible).  I always push three topics the hardest:  Scholastic book orders that go out every month and how they benefit the students, the different modes of communication I use (mass email every week, Facebook page for classroom updated daily, and introducing Remind this year), and RESPECT.  I push how important the classroom community is and how much I value their children and want them to value each other.  I enjoy meeting the parents."

Teachers,3e2e4k,CunningAllusionment,2,Tue Jul 21 16:21:25 2015 UTC,Standards based grading is most useful when students:  1) clearly understand what they're expected to learn.  2) can recognize whether or not they've learned it and know how they're expected to demonstrate it.  3) have the opportunity to be retaught if they don't learn it the first time.

You are going to have to sell that bitch for students to give a shit and like transform it over the year to keep it interesting. Different formats, images, little boxes for them to check, constantly refer to it in class, highlight things together, etc.  Do NOT throw too much stuff in one rubric. If it they are seperate grades have seperate rubrics unless they are incredibly dependent on each other.  Have fun creating these! I know how much of a pain in the ass they are :)"

I use those cards as my ""random name generators"" all year, and if I have to track a student down in a different class, I know where to look.

Incentivise behaviors instead of results.  If you are working harder than your students you are doing things wrong."
Teachers,3e0sit,MrPants1401,2,Tue Jul 21 02:54:04 2015 UTC,Must teach in a decent area to be able to skip the introduction. Where I teach we have to spend a whole week on rules and procedures lol
Teachers,3e0sit,Collegeen,5,Tue Jul 21 02:59:29 2015 UTC,"Definitely not true. Teaching on the first day worked better in a title 1 school for me. We do some sort of scientific method-related activity on day 1, then spend some time covering notebooks. 2nd day we go over procedures and policies and while I might mention them again as reminders later, we never spend another day just covering them. You need to be very clear with your expectations and confident in your classroom management skills, though. And I can't even imagine spending a week on policies and rules..."

I have a set of trays with the name and hour of each class so they can turn in homework.   I also make sure there is an organized space on the board for the agenda, homework, and objectives for the day.  I group all of my contacts for each class into groups on Gmail as well. They are split into students and parents (EX: Biology has a Biology Students group and a Biology Parents group).

Teachers,3dzet2,justagirl106,22,Mon Jul 20 19:46:09 2015 UTC,"I was going through depression during the first few years of my teaching as well (was depressed before teaching, but the stress of the job obviously exacerbated it).  I actually found that putting a lot of energy into work made me feel better. It was when I would get home and think about my day, my students, and not be doing anything productive that I would feel really sad.    Exercise, getting enough sleep and eating healthily will set you up for success.  However you manage your depression otherwise should help you during the school year.  I also will suggest that maybe your school isn't the right fit for you.  I taught at a school where the levels of aggression were really high, then after moving to a different school and position (from core English to special ed) I found I was much happier at work.  Good luck to you!"
Teachers,3dzet2,gimmefantastic,9,Mon Jul 20 20:04:12 2015 UTC,"I agree with this. The pattern and schedule of school, plus having others counting on and depending on me, was a really helpful and powerful thing in combating my depression. (Not curing it, but keeping it at bay.) In a lot of ways, being at school distracted me and kept me focused on more 'real' things rather than wallowing in self-pity or sadness.   Also, hello fellow ELA to SpEd convert! ;)"

Teachers,3dzet2,gimmefantastic,4,Mon Jul 20 20:40:10 2015 UTC,"I got my Master's in Special Ed. by taking night and summer classes at a local university from 2009-2013. I think I did one course per semester up until one of the last semesters where my adviser said if you don't take these two at the same time, you'll have to get all these other crazy requirements to confer the degree.  Most of the classes were 1-2 nights per week, so the final semester was 4 nights per week of classes!  It was busy but very doable. I actually did a lot of the work at school (on my lunch or prep) and even got help from teachers in the SpEd department occasionally to save me some time. The program required student teaching (even though I was already a certified teacher), so I did that part in the summers. One summer at juvie and one summer at an elementary!  Man, the stories I can tell my high schoolers now! Heh."

Teachers,3dzet2,gunnapackofsammiches,13,Mon Jul 20 20:23:08 2015 UTC,"Yoga/working out. Endorphines, plus an hour during the day when you're not thinking about school. Plan things every week or two to look forward to!  Be open and honest with your grade level/subject area team. If you're struggling, let them know so they can help you. If you don't, you end up looking like you're letting things fall through the cracks. Schedule a mental health day or two during the long stretches when there aren't any vacations (if you have a reasonable number of sick days and access to subs). Taking a day for yourself works wonders.  DO NOT SYNC YOUR WORK EMAIL TO YOUR PHONE. No work email during off work hours.  Eating during the school day. It sounds dumb, but low blood sugar kills your patience levels."
Teachers,3dzet2,Sohhyeon,3,Mon Jul 20 22:01:48 2015 UTC,"Can't agree more to taking a couple mental health days!  I told only two people about my mental health issues at school, and one was very sweet because she has experienced it her whole life and it was incredibly helpful to talk to someone who knows what it's like to try to manage mental health in the profession-- I ended up going into her classroom crying a couple times before school or during lunch because I needed to get it out and she was so understanding.  The other person I told was not understanding and held it against me a few times.    When I needed to take a mental health day, I usually told my teammates it was a ""24 hour bug"" so they wouldn't ask any questions.  Sometimes I've had to take a day off if I was going off meds and was feeling like the world was ending for a day (I knew it was best for me and my kids that I spend a day wallowing and then I could come back fresh).  I never felt like I could tell my teammates because I knew that they viewed mental health issues in more of a ""it's all in your head"" kind of way, and that's the least helpful thing to hear when you're in the middle of a bout of depression.  In my first couple years as a teacher, I did see a therapist for PTSD, which caused a relapse of depression, so that was somewhat helpful to talk things through, but my coworker who had experienced it herself was infinitely more helpful.    I also tried yoga, but my anxiety prevented me from getting relaxation from it, though I did become stronger and more flexible."

Teachers,3dzet2,adorablebutdangerous,7,Mon Jul 20 20:29:49 2015 UTC,"I am going to say something that is extremely unpopular and will get downvoted to hell, but it is something I wish someone had told me a decade ago.  Teaching in some environments can be hell.  I spent my first several years in the classroom in struggling failing urban schools in a large US city. Parent involvement was nil, the kids were  extremely challenging, and morale very low. Teacher talent among my peers was very dim, which made me feel better at teaching than I actually was.  In my first few years of teaching, I felt awful all of the time. I worked in my classroom countless hours and worried about school every minute. I worked on lesson planning all weekend. I gained weight, I cried all of the time, I could maintain no positive social relationships, except with other teachers. I could not carry any conversation that didn't center on school and teaching. I had no outside interests. The anxiety and depression were horrible.   I sought anti-depressants. I tried therapy. It did not get better.   It wasn't until I was nearly 29 (and had been teaching 8 years) that I was able to teach and not feel miserable all of the time. I went back to a less demanding public school system after three years of private school teaching, and I had the maturity and the life balance to make it work. I no longer wanted to be the best.  I no longer took home work. I did my job and went home.  Here's the thing.  I deeply, deeply regret the years I toiled (and really gave up to the job) to get better at teaching. I regret the years I spent in misery.  I wish like heck I had quit my first job - even mid year - and found something else to do with my life. The toil did not pay off, not in job satisfaction or in salary (of course).    If teaching makes you miserable and depressed, maybe consider what else you want to do with your life.  I always wanted to be a lawyer, but I doubted my ability to compete and fell back on teaching as an easier path. I find that an oddly high number of high-performing, perfectionist young female teachers actually had other dreams of excelling in other careers, but got scared and went to teaching as an alternative. If that is you (and only you know if it is), please get out as soon as possible and pursue what you really want. After a decade in the classroom, I can't afford to walk away from a guaranteed paycheck to go to law school. But at 21, I could have. And I should have."
Teachers,3dzet2,heather80,3,Tue Jul 21 04:11:48 2015 UTC,I also should have quit while I was young. Instead I am making it work for me by finding an area that I do like and am doing my Masters in that.  I like study as it takes my mind off my problems but pressure when depressed can backfire.

I just hit about rock bottom with my job, the stress and anxiety sent me into a depression and I knew I just had to get out. I tried to get a summer job at a tutoring center last month and hated it as well.  I think one of the hardest parts about teaching (or any job for that matter) is that once people know you in that role it's very hard to get out.  I don't know what I want to do next, but I know I don't want to teach anymore. Just thanks for expressing how you feel. It's really made me feel better about my decision to quit."

I'm going to do this for a few years and then consider some other leadership role perhaps.   Thank you for your testimony, as it were. I felt really bad about myself as a young teacher, like, ""What is wrong with you that you are such an emotional wreck?"" I did not blame the job. I should have."

When things are particularly rough, we have a 'no shop talk' rule.  We celebrate everything and throw a pot-luck 'surprise' birthday party at least once a month.  We decorate with the silliest things we can.    -I leave notes for staff and students, or do a random good deed. It's even more fun to do it anonymously because it gets positive discussion going and builds a sense of community.  Bonus - often people pay it forward so it spawns happiness elsewhere.  It makes me feel good to boost someone else up and I find everything easier to deal with in a happy environment.    -Create boundaries for yourself and stick to them.  Set a timer to leave school if you need to.  -There is no such thing as a perfect lesson or worksheet so do what you can and make notes on what to  edit for next year.  Over time you will build a collection of activities, lesson plans, worksheets, etc that just need to be refined.    -Practice mindfulness and deep breathing throughout the day.    -Drink plenty of water.  -Be silly.

Teachers,3dzet2,a_junebug,5,Tue Jul 21 22:25:56 2015 UTC,"Just a few tips being a teacher for eight years already:   As much as possible, do not bring home work. You need the time to rest and chill. Working at home will just retain whatever stress you experienced during the work hours. When you get home, just reward yourself for a job well done such as eating your favorite snack or watching television for maybe half an hour. Review your reason for teaching. I always remind myself that I work very hard because I want the best from my students. When my students perform really well, it motivates me to challenge them even more by preparing more authentic academic tasks for them. Perhaps you may have some qualms with admin or other people but in the end, your students should motivate you enough to continue and enjoy your job. Learn something new. Being a teacher, you are also a student. Always try to learn something new, whether it be related to your subject matter or not. Maybe you can learn digital learning, inquiry-based learning, or other methodologies that can aid you in your instruction.    Always keep an open-minded. Always ask yourself this question: ""Why do I teach?"" Make sure that your answer centers around your students. Any other answer may be problematic and distracting as you work on teaching on a regular basis."
Teachers,3dzet2,Yanley,4,Tue Jul 21 00:28:45 2015 UTC,"I think I have told only maybe one or two people at work about my depression (in a large building of 100+ staff), just because there was really no reason for anyone else to know. Most people would probably be shocked to find out since it's one of those invisible things that isn't obvious even once you tell a person about it.   Personally, I learned what triggered further/worse depression and found ways to work through those triggers. For examples, Sundays (or any day back from a long weekend/vacation) were particularly awful for me. It would be especially bad if I had lots of grading, lesson planning, or other teacher-y stuff hanging over my head.  So, I learned to make those days fun, relaxing, and enjoyable for myself. I also stopped pairing up other undesirable tasks (like grocery shopping, cooking, or paying the bills) on those Sundays where I would already be feeling like total junk.   Sometimes, I would also 'take advantage' of my depression. If I already felt bad, why not be productive about it?  It would normally be a total downer to stand there and do dishes or fold laundry, but if I'm going to cry and have a pity party, at least I would get something productive out of it. Since these are kind of mindless tasks that have to be done anyway, it killed two birds with one stone. I allowed myself to feel my emotions and try to just work them out, and if I wasn't feeling better by the end of the chore (at least a little bit from the sense of satisfaction over completing it), then I had a good clue my 'bout' of depression was maybe more serious than I initially thought and could start on other remedies (seeking help, for instance)."
Teachers,3dzet2,CatShirtFTW,3,Mon Jul 20 20:43:37 2015 UTC,"I don't have much to say except it is good to hear that others are there with me.

Teachers,3dzet2,mryanj1,3,Tue Jul 21 09:01:15 2015 UTC,"Exercise, good diet, and talking to anyone who will listen. Meds are a possibility in the future, but I'm always unsure about it.  Occasionally it affects my interactions with kids. Sometimes I need to remove myself or stop the lesson to regain composure, and sometimes I just openly share how I'm feeling. They're high school kids so I feel like it's a bit more appropriate to humanize adults sometimes.   Some of my own teachers broke composure because of mental issues when I was in school. Their lessons never went well that day, but I probably learned more about humanity those days than any other ones."
Teachers,3dzet2,PolishMusic,3,Mon Jul 20 22:43:19 2015 UTC,"I throw myself into work while I'm there, and separate myself when I'm not. I know that's easier said than done, but I find joy and happiness in my students as much as I possibly can. Sometimes I have to take a step back because I feel it creeping up and taking over, but focusing my energy on making their experience better in the classroom helps me tremendously to get through each day. Truly, they are the reason I get up in the morning and the reason I work so hard. Remembering that I am there for them and not myself has gotten me through so many hard days.   I feel like I am the only person who dreads the weekends and summer and time off because it gives me too much time to think and obsess.   I don't think it's necessary to tell any of my colleagues, but I did confide in a teacher who I knew was going through something similar. We became close and were able to vent to each other when we needed to and be a shoulder to lean on. We aren't going to be working in the same building this year and that makes me so sad.   I really hope some of this is helpful; I feel I'm upfront about mental illness and try to take the stigma away from it as much as possible. It's a part of my everyday life and will be for the rest of my life. Once I accepted that fact as truth it became a little easier to deal with.   Oh...and Xanax ;-)"

I remember my favorite days though, where I played softball on the same league with my coworkers and admin, did yoga in my classroom after school, and chaperoned a snowboarding group on the weekends.   Find things to do that make you happy and work it into your schedule so that you have something to look forward to each week.

What really helped me was reaching out to a mentor teacher and other first-year teachers who were going through similar situations. http://teachers.net/mentors/ offers some online connections for finding a mentor and getting peer support, but I would recommend trying to connect with teachers in your area--even if it is only once or twice a month. :)"

Follow a standard operating procedure checklist for living a healthy life and taking care of the body and mind:  1) Are you eating healthy? (fresh fruits, nuts, vegetables making up the majority of your diet) Refined sugars are a silent killer.  2) Are you exercising at least 30 minutes, 4 or 5 days a week?  3) Are you sleeping enough? This one is HUGE for teachers. YOU NEED TO SLEEP. If you're not dreaming (or remembering your dreams) then something is wrong.  4) Are you meditating at least 10 or 20 minutes per day?

I was suicidal for 3 months, but when I finally came out and told people what had happened at the end of the school year (and that I was leaving), only a couple kids said that they ever even suspected that anything was wrong, most of them said that I was my cheery enthusiastic self with them."
Teachers,3dzet2,infinitum17,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:17:13 2015 UTC,"Not really advice, so much, but be aware that the first year is as hard as anything can possibly be. That kind of pressure from without and within can send your anxiety into the stratosphere. Once you go from ""survival mode"" to ""management mode,"" it becomes easier. The meds will hopefully help, as will the therapy, but you being more familiar with the job will also be a benefit you notice on day 1 of year 2. That said, if this is a shitty environment for you, there are plenty of places to teach. I teach at a Title 1 school, and its a different type of pressure, but it's an environment I enjoy."
Teachers,3dzet2,anti-ayn,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:22:58 2015 UTC,I would get oit of school on Friday and just shut down for like 24 hours. I would just feel so drained and hollow. I hope to avoid that this year by...well I haven't figured that out yet.

I don't have anything to add that has not been said, but it is awesome to see so many people that deal with the same things and so productively. Especially since there's at least a handful that have said other teachers don't understand their mental illness- now we all have a handful of ones that do. :)"

Teachers,3e0e7k,titations,5,Tue Jul 21 05:03:52 2015 UTC,One has to wonder why.
Teachers,3e0e7k,JRoch,6,Tue Jul 21 12:56:33 2015 UTC,"You don't have to wonder. The state keeps cutting funds, so not only can they not pay their teachers a decent wage, but the schools lack resources.  I just graduated with an M.Ed, and got my first teaching job in Tucson. I'll be making about 33k this year. I'm only staying for one year to get a little experience under my belt."
Teachers,3e0e7k,CowOfCthulhu,2,Tue Jul 21 13:03:06 2015 UTC,"Those who are just starting out, AZ can be a good place to get 1-2 years experience, then go elsewhere.  If you're in a district for a long time, it's definitely a pay cut.  I've looked into moving to other places - but it would likely be a $15-20K pay CUT for me, rather than a raise."

The cost of living is about the same, so I think after my first year I'm going to start putting in apps there. It's a beautiful area, the schools are good, and we have family there.  So I'll just keep my head down, work my butt off, learn what I can, and bail as quickly as possible. That's not to say that my school is bad (it's decent) or that the people I work for are terrible (they're actually pretty great), but the problems come from a much higher level in AZ."

Teachers,3e0e7k,HotDamn18V,8,Tue Jul 21 13:21:59 2015 UTC,"Man it's terrible what's happening in Arizona. I bailed after 2 1/2 years and my job in PA is SO much better. What AZ needs is for all their teachers to bail and create an actual crisis that can't be stopped by emergency certs, forcing the government to do something that isn't stupid as hell for once and improve conditions in their schools. It would hurt the kids in the short term, but not as much as all this nonsense is in the long term. My old school is over 1/4th long term subs!   Edit: I'm not actually trying to derail your thread. I should say that I loved my time in AZ, despite the crazy school nonsense, and it would not have been possible to get my current job without the all the experience and opportunities I got in such a short amount of time in AZ. I was doing things like running student council and coaching football. Stuff that would normally be held by veteran teachers. At 2 1/2 years, I was one of the more veteran teachers in my district. If you want experience and to work with other young, motivated, new teachers for a while, move to AZ. If you are seeking a permanent career in teaching, look elsewhere."
Teachers,3e0e7k,CowOfCthulhu,2,Tue Jul 21 06:08:38 2015 UTC,"You make some good points. The district I was just hired by seems pretty great. The staff is awesome, and I work with a lot of young, motivated teachers. Unfortunately, with a lack of funding, schools seem to have to make the choice to pay teachers, or fund the school, not both."
Teachers,3e0e7k,CowOfCthulhu,2,Tue Jul 21 13:06:21 2015 UTC,"True.  My husband has been attending the new teacher induction this week (he's not really a new teacher, but he's returning to the district so he's attending it) and he said that they are doing everything possible to make the teachers feel welcome and wanted.  While the pay may not be super-high, the district itself DOES value the teachers and he's always been treated well there.  I've found in my experience that even with the money issue, it really depends on who you're working with.  At one point our superintendent was awful and he made a lot of enemies - and despite being well paid, many teachers were looking into leaving the district.  But then you have districts that don't pay as well but the teachers are respected and valued as professionals, and people want to come to those places."
Teachers,3e0e7k,evillordsoth,2,Tue Jul 21 13:26:09 2015 UTC,"What district? Because the NTO I'm doing this week has a lot of returning teachers, and I feel the same way. Very welcoming, and the district has a distinct and close-knit feel to it."
Teachers,3e0e7k,evillordsoth,2,Tue Jul 21 13:31:29 2015 UTC,"he said that they are doing everything possible to make the teachers feel welcome and wanted   I'm sure they are, being nice is free.  Especially when 20-40% of your school is LTS."
Teachers,3e0e7k,HotDamn18V,2,Tue Jul 21 13:32:10 2015 UTC,"No, they are spending some $$$,  it's not all free.  They're catering lunch and breakfast all week.  He came home with a huge swag bag yesterday full of supplies."
Teachers,3e0e7k,evillordsoth,3,Tue Jul 21 13:35:55 2015 UTC,"Judging from Arizona's average teacher salary, they could be spending upwards of $3500 a head, and would still be making out on that deal if the teacher left happy and satisfied with their grab bag of stuff and free lunch.  I was always wary when I was in the private sector of this type of behavior.  Company has catered lunches and free gym access, but wants you to be on campus for 65 hours a week? No thanks, I'll cook at home and work out outside, and leave at 4."
Teachers,3e0e7k,CowOfCthulhu,2,Tue Jul 21 13:50:04 2015 UTC,"That's what working in AZ felt like to me. Being part of a private corporation. There isn't any union, of course, so you're left with meaningless gestures from admin like free carne asada lunches to keep you happy when you have rent to be paid and 38 kids sitting in your classroom."
Teachers,3e0e7k,JRoch,-2,Tue Jul 21 20:43:22 2015 UTC,"Have you worked as a teacher? Free meals and boxes of supplies aren't something teachers usually get.  We get one free meal a year from my school - and it's served in the cafeteria, on open house night. Not catered.    So for other types of work, this may be par for the course.  But for teachers, it's not typical at all.  So yes, most teachers would be happy to see this sort of thing the first week back. Usually it's ""OK guys, you have an hour for lunch, there's a McD's around the corner"" and then we go to Wal-Mart to buy the supplies out of pocket."
Teachers,3e0e7k,Eightdaysago,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:08:36 2015 UTC,"It's certainly ""typical"" to be offered free or cheap meals in the cafeteria throughout the year, and to have catered PD days.  Though admittedly usually the caterers have been Panera bread, or something of that type."
Teachers,3e0e7k,firstroundko108,2,Tue Jul 21 14:29:15 2015 UTC,"I've been teaching for 20 years.  I've had maybe 30 free meals in that entire time - every once in a while during the first week back, and once per year on open house night.  I've never seen a catered PD day - usually the host campus has everyone bring something for a pot luck type breakfast.  The only free lunches I've received have been pizza and subs at union meetings - which come from union dues and aren't really free.  Where do you teach that it's typical?"
Teachers,3e0e7k,seis_cuerdas,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:46:34 2015 UTC,"Same thing at my district. While I was setting up my classroom, the principal's secretary brought me a huge box of supplies. White board markers, pens, pencils, desk organizers, tissues, hand sanitizer, paper, hanging folders. Like I said in another thread, the problem isn't necessarily the schools. The problems come from a much higher level."

Teachers,3e0e7k,seis_cuerdas,18,Tue Jul 21 01:46:47 2015 UTC,"Arizona is in the worst possible situation right now. I wouldn't do it unless you're absolutely desperate for a job. They need to reform their ways before they screw over any more teachers. One of my good friends who is an amazing teacher and loved by all his students recently gave up on the profession because of his experiences at multiple districts in Arizona.   A recent survey of Arizona teachers found that ""[t]he three most significant causes of the teacher shortage include poor compensation, inadequate public respect and increased accountability without appropriate support."" My friend quit for all three reasons, but primarily the third one. He was required to throw out reading and writing about literature in favor of a canned curriculum for increasing standardized test scores, and he was harshly reprimanded when it didn't work.

Some parents/guardians feel like all of the learning should be done at school, so providing some info on how to practice/review at home might be really helpful.    For example, my mom (a music teacher) used to sing these rhyming songs with my younger siblings (and probably me, too, but I don't remember it).  They were so silly, but helped them learn to spell and recognize words. (One I remember went, like, ""I can spell bat: B-A-T. ... I can spell cat: C-A-T"" and on and on with all versions of rhyming -at words. It drove me nuts since I could already read/spell, but you get the picture.)

It seems appropriate only for parents who didn't enroll their kids in kindergarten, and those parents who are transfers."

Here's the post that started me. From there, I began exploring some of the blogs that were on there, many of which have been around for awhile. One blogger (CoolCatTeacher) talked a lot about using Twitter and how that has helped her to network and share ideas with other teachers. So I joined Twitter.  Now, I sit on the sidelines of Twitter, just as I do here, but there are several huge communities of teachers that talk and share there. A few interesting ones are on the hashtags #edchat and #tlap (stands for Teach Like a Pirate, a book by Dave Burgess, who's active on Twitter as well). Most seem to go toward Twitter for 2 goals: (1) sharing ideas and professional development, and (2) encouragement. It's pretty cool.  The upside is, you don't have to post or be involved to just follow along. Might be interesting for you to check out.  TL;DR: It appears that blogging is almost secondary to twitter in ways to share and do Professional Development informally to help improve your teaching.  Edit: 8 hours later I realize I forgot to link the older post. Somehow no one called me out on it. Sorry about that!"

Teachers,3e01vk,gimmefantastic,0,Mon Jul 20 23:15:58 2015 UTC,"private school   The parents are in charge, then. BUT before trying to get the parents, maybe see if you can talk with this teacher about his attitude. He seems like the type to be really proud, so I'd suggest asking to meet up with him after school at or recess to talk. Talk with him individually (but keep the door open) and very calmly explain yourself, something like ""I really like the way you teach because you can explain concepts in a way we understand. I know that most of the class agrees with me when I say we think you teach well, and you really know your subject. But... we believe that using fear as a disciplinary tactic is disrupting the learning atmosphere. I believe that we can understand the concepts if you teach us, but if you see here (then refer to the syllabus), you were asking us to recall information that hasn't been taught, and we are here to learn, so it's not too surprising that we may not know some things. What I'm asking is if you can please stop making these threats because they don't help us learn, these threats are scaring us away from the subject. We would really appreciate it if you stopped threatening students to leave the class. What are your thoughts on this?""  If that doesn't seem to go by smoothly, just be like, ""Ok, thank you for your time, and have a nice day"". Be completely mature about it.  Then try and see if you can get your dad to rally up a group of parents who will band together against this teacher's teaching style. It is a private school, so money talks. You may need to get a petition going with these parents and submit it to the teacher. In your petition, write down what you are concerned with, and your solution to fix this (ex. change disciplinary style), then a list of signatures and names."
Teachers,3e01vk,Chuchoter,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:52:48 2015 UTC,"I don't recommend going to the principal by yourself. I've had friends in similar situations, and I think it's probably better to get a group of parents to talk to him. Or go to the school board (I think some private school's have them too)."
Teachers,3e01vk,TeacherTotodile,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:23:54 2015 UTC,I was thinking that too but I felt like that this teacher/principal (what a horrid combo) is on a pride trip and would rather try to settle on a micro scale before getting to the real bosses (i.e. parents).
Teachers,3e01vk,Chuchoter,0,Tue Jul 21 01:52:20 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure. :S It's definitely a hard situation, I don't envy you OP. While I think the Principal would rather do it on a small scale, sometimes the power trippers need a higher up (or parents in this case) to speak to them."

Black because it goes with almost everything (and for the few pants it doesn't, I buy the same pair in a nude), comfy because I will wear them every single day, clicky because it adds to the ""teacher persona"" and creates obedient kids because of an unconscious learned behavior to obey authority and clicking = authority."

(It sounds like you want to take the new position, regardless of pay or hours!)  Don't worry about your current school having to fill your position. That's not for you to worry about. I would, however, call your current administrators and thank them for the opportunity to work with them the past few years. If they ask why you are leaving, talk about how it is closer to home, and a chance to try something new. This way you're not bashing the work they are doing, but any smart admin will know."
Teachers,3dzdc3,gimmefantastic,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:49:00 2015 UTC,"In addition to the pay cut, is there tenure? Job protection? What are the hours? It sounds like you should take the new position.   I'm in a conservative state that's done its best to do away with tenure across the board - we have performance based evaluations now which have very little to do with our years of experience. Job protection - not sure although because it's a charter school, there's probably no union.  Hours are good - I asked about prep time, PLC time, etc. It's a block schedule where every other day, you get an 85 min prep period, and there's a 25-30 min mandatory academic only study hall for all kids every day, where I'm expected to just monitor and help kids who need help with my subject. I'm used to having prep time during school every day now, but we're not on a block schedule. Also, school starts at 9 and ends at 4 at the new school - currently, I get to school at 7:30 for mandatory PLC time, school starts at 8:30, and it ends at 3:30. With my 30 minute commute that means I get up before 6 every day...which sucks. At the new school, PLC is once a week on Fridays, and the kids start later so that we have before school time for prof development.  I think my administrators will understand, even though I do think it's bad that I'm really only giving them a week's notice. My current department chair is great and has always been very supportive. I just don't want to burn the bridge with her or anyone else."

However I somehow ended up in primary and now going into my 3rd year as a 1st grade teacher. What you really want to do is speak as if you are excited about everything you are doing. If you sound pumped up for it, the kids will be pumped up for it and engaged. Also you will want to really boost them up and blow their heads up big time. For example, if a child does something as simple as add 2+5, you should treat it as if they have just completed rocket science. Make them feel good. You don't have to use a kiddie voice for any of this, you wouldn't want them trying to copy it."

Kids pick up on ""fake"" and being ""talked down"" to. Even if they can't articulate it, they sense that it is disingenuous. I teach older kids, but I have never talked to my own child or other kids any differently than I do to adults. Of course, I cut out the swearing and some of the advanced vocabulary. To show my excitement and enthusiasm, I use old-school hip hop jargon and valley girl lingo because that is just my personality. The kids think it is hysterically dorky, so it gets them amped."

When a child lashes out at you, the vast majority of the time it's because of something happening in his/her life that he has no clue how to handle. You're the easy target. Building healthy, meaningful, appropirate relationships with your students will be your biggest challenge and biggest reward.  Those horrible parents who drive you crazy are almost always coming from a place of love and concern. They just don't know what to do.   The more difficult the class, the more structured you have to be. Plan, plan and plan some more. Most minor classroom management issues can be solved by careful instructional planning on your part. This will be the most time consuming aspect of your first year. The internet is your friend! Make use of Pinterest, TeachersPayTeachers, A to Z Teacher Forums, etc. to help you with lesson ideas.   Try to say ""no"" to helping out with anything extra this first year. No cheerleader sponsoring, no yearbook, no coaching, etc. LOL. They'll try to sucker you in to all of that. :)  Best of luck to you!"
Teachers,3dxe45,bandnerdtx,5,Mon Jul 20 21:04:05 2015 UTC,"tl;dr version of Harry K. Wong:   There is only one way to improve student learning. It is with an effective teacher. Here’s the biggest secret to being effective: beg, borrow, and steal – and work collaboratively. Effective is defined as having an effect, producing a result. Proficient is defined as possessing knowledge and skills. The only intervention that can make a difference in student learning is one with a knowledgeable and skillful teacher. The most important factor, bar none, is the teacher. An inefficient teacher can affect student learning for years, but two successive ineffective teachers can damage a student forever. There is only one way to produce good schools and that is with effective teachers. We have been trying for years with programs, fads, and ideologies. The four stages of teaching: Fantasy, Survival, Mastery, Impact. The three characteristics of an effective teacher are: 1) has good classroom management skills, 2) teaches for mastery, and 3) has positive expectations for student success. Your expectations of your students will greatly influence their achievement in your class and in their lives. Ineffective teachers will teach out of a book, follow a program, or complain about the culture or the neighborhood of the students.   Classroom Management   What you do on the first day of school will determine your success for the rest of the year. You will either win or lose your class on the first days of school. The most important factor that must be established the very first week of school is CONSISTENCY. The number one factor that leads to student achievement is classroom management. Stand at the door and greet the students. Give each student a seating assignment and a seating chart. Your very first priority when class begins is to get the students to work. There must be a schedule, bellwork, and a lesson objective or assignment posted in a consistent location, when the students enter the room. Effective teachers have a script or classroom management plan ready on the first day of school to structure and organize the classroom. The number one problem in education is not discipline. It is the lack of procedures and routines, the lack of a plan that organizes a classroom for success. Many teachers spend time covering lessons and then disciplining when things go wrong. They never spend time managing their classrooms. Discipline refers to BEHAVIOR. Procedures refer to getting things DONE. Discipline: Has penalties and rewards. Procedures: Have NO penalties or rewards. Effective teachers MANAGE their classrooms. Ineffective teachers DISCIPLINE their classrooms. Student achievement is directly related to how the teacher establishes classroom procedures the very first week of school. The ineffective teacher begins the first day of school attempting to teach a subject or do a fun activity and spends the rest of the school year running after the students. The effective teacher spends much of the first week of school teaching students to follow classroom procedures to organize the classroom for engagement and learning. The three steps to teaching a procedure are: explain, rehearse, and reinforce. Students get low grades because of the failure to know what procedures to follow and what objectives to learn or do. Classroom management are those practices and procedures used to manage a classroom so that instruction and learning can take place. At-Risk: Students risk failure because of a lack of structure. Classrooms risk failure because of a lack of structure. All effective classrooms have structure. A series of procedures and routines equals structure. Learning is much more effective when it takes place within a supportive community of learners. With procedures in place, you’ll have time to devote to the art of teaching and become the effective teacher your students need and deserve.   Lesson Mastery   Good instruction is 15 to 20 times more powerful than any explanatory variable. Learning has nothing to do with what the teacher covers. Learning has to do with what the student accomplishes. Students learn when they know what they are to learn and how they will be assessed and graded. Objectives focus students on what they are aiming for; thus, they know what they are responsible for learning. When both the students and the teachers are moving towards the same objective, that’s when you get learning. Students get more done when they see where they are going and what they are doing. Effective teachers have a study guideline with a list of the objectives that tells the students what they are responsible for accomplishing. The lesson objectives are to be correlated to either state or district standards. A criterion reference test is to be written before the lesson begins. A scoring guide or rubric is to be written before the lesson begins. The activities used in a lesson must be correlated to the lesson objectives. A test allows a teacher to assess for learning, not to grade a student. A scoring guide is a formative assessment used to guide student improvement. The purpose of assessment is to gather information to improve instruction for student learning. The only way to improve student learning is to improve teacher instructional practice.   Positive Expectations   In low performing schools, teachers are less likely to collaborate and learn from one another. In high performing schools, teachers share with one another the needed knowledge and skills to help their students reach high standards. Effective teams of teachers will analyze student work to determine how to improve instruction. Success has little to do with money, class size, fancy programs, parental involvement, or tutoring. These can be found at good and bad schools. Effective teams of teachers teach to pre-stated objectives, assess and reassess student work, and use the results to teach and reteach until they find a way for students to grasp the lesson. Ineffective teachers view teaching as a job. They sit at the back of meetings and put in time. Effective teachers have a positive expectation that they can be effective, that they ARE the difference in the lives of children. Teachers who work at being effective will create classrooms in which students can successfully learn. The single greatest effect on student achievement is the effectiveness of the teacher. The most effective teachers are those who produce an effect on themselves. Inside every great teacher there is an even better one waiting to come out. Teachers are the sculptors of the human race."

Starting a wall of text like this makes me not read the rest of it. In this way, it is an example of poor teaching.  I've heard great things about this book, but if it's like this, I want no part of it."

Teachers,3dyl22,livetolearnandlove,12,Mon Jul 20 16:16:54 2015 UTC,"I'm going to advise you against doing this. For one, reading a ""blue dot"" book instead of a ""red dot"" book (or whatever system you might use), can embarrass a child or stigmatize them. Even if the levels aren't explicit, they still know which is a ""smart book"" and which is not. Furthermore, when students enter a library, bookstore, or any other place in which they might authentically acquire reading material, there is more than likely no leveling system. Without skills to help them effectively choose a book by themselves, they are left helpless.  Instead, I encourage you to teach your children how to examine a book cover, know its respective parts, and understand how each part functions. With my eighth grade students, I also teach them the Five Finger Rule, and I teach them that it's okay to abandon a book when it's not working for them. Good readers do that from time to time! With these strategies, my students read an average of 26 independent books per kid last year.  I hope this sways you. For more reading-related suggestions, I loved ""The Book Whisperer"" by Donalyn Miller."
Teachers,3dyl22,Linguiste,2,Mon Jul 20 16:49:11 2015 UTC,"Wow that would be so much easier! I only wanted the levels because our administration asked that the entire school send home ""levelled book bags"" for each child. I understand why younger grades do this, but I feel like it's micromanaging my 4th grade room unnecessarily. I'm at a title I school and when the year began, only 3 of my students last year were reading on level.  I did a reading journal last year and all but a few were reading on or above grade level by the end of the year. One parent complained that I wasn't sending books in bags home last year because her younger son got one.  I explained that I taught the kids how to choose a ""just right"" books and felt that it was important to allow some freedom in what they ultimately read. Additionally I taught the class how to search on the media catalog by level. I have this strong feeling that this parent is why we have to send bag books now. I just want it to be easier to make these bags for the kids."
Teachers,3dyl22,Linguiste,4,Mon Jul 20 17:19:39 2015 UTC,"Can your students pick out the books that they want to be in the book bags? That sounds like a lot of work for you, and it detracts from the independence you are fostering in your students with regard to reading."
Teachers,3dyl22,Linguiste,2,Mon Jul 20 17:24:20 2015 UTC,"That's what I'd like, but I asked and they said only if the books are labeled by level. Additionally they want me to check that they all have one before they pack up."
Teachers,3dyl22,Lulahula01,3,Mon Jul 20 17:28:16 2015 UTC,"Dang. Your administrators sound needlessly inflexible. If there is a rationale (and data) behind your ways, what's the point in doing something simply for systematicity?  In any case, the Lexile Framework site has a book search in the top right corner.  I've found that it's not always the most helpful, but it's something."
Teachers,3dyl22,gimmefantastic,2,Mon Jul 20 18:17:59 2015 UTC,"We have bins for each level. Students work through their level until they're ready for the next one, choosing books that interest them. They check with the teacher before they bring the book home, for both level and appropriateness."
Teachers,3dyl22,newteacher14,3,Mon Jul 20 18:34:46 2015 UTC,"I think it's good to have your library as a mix of leveled & genre.    Eventually, kids know which books are ""smart"" anyway. For example, I teach middle school sped and some of my kids are at 1st or 2nd grade reading level.  Don't need a sticker to tell the difference between a 2nd grade book and a 7th grade book..I think it's also important to help kids understand that everyone learns differently and at different paces, etc.  I agree about the 5 finger system, though!  Instead of stickers or something, I keep books on shelves by grade level and the actual level is written on the inside back cover of the book so nobody has their level put on blast."
Teachers,3dyl22,heckyeahliteracy,9,Mon Jul 20 18:27:30 2015 UTC,"Scholastic Book Wizard might be helpful. You just type in the name of the book and it will give you the lexile level, grade level, and genre."

Sometimes I use the Book Wizard, but sometimes I don't. its pretty easy to tell the grade level of a book and half my books are printed with the grade level on the back anyways.  The kids basically ignore the leveling system, it is more for me to see what level they are comfortable at and what books are getting read a lot. Don't spend too much time on this."

They are constantly adding new books AND give the identifiers to begin leveling books if they don't have one you need (you won't be spot on, but closer than no level at all!)"
Teachers,3dyl22,mellie428,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:32:09 2015 UTC,"::Shutters:: F n P levels are the worst. We switched over from the DRP to F n P two years ago and it's still confusing for many people in my school. Many teachers in my district still think the DRP books are harder than the F n P levels. I'm not sure of any websites that might help you out, but I might just do a search on guidelines of labeling a book via F n P or Lexile. Whichever you choose. If no luck do you have reading consultants or tutors in your building? We do, and they help a lot of us with that stuff."
Teachers,3dyl22,ceruleantornado,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:53:48 2015 UTC,"you must mean ""shudder"". Fountas and Pinnell is actually one of the most well researched of the leveling systems.Many of the others are merely based on content or word count."
Teachers,3dyl22,Woody716,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:30:42 2015 UTC,"Yes, on my mobile device so it was auto-corrected. I don't disagree with that...it's definitely easier to administer and the comprehension questions are better for students. I just know from experience and working with my co-workers who have been taught and re-taught how to do the DRA it was quite the change for them. Personally, it's what I learned when going to college and student teaching and I'd rather use it."

Teachers,3dydmf,gtmrkd,4,Mon Jul 20 15:23:20 2015 UTC,"Yes and no. Someone could either see you as and aide and decide that you would make a good teacher and help you into a teacher position. However, someone could also see you as a good aide and want to keep you in that capacity and not help you advance. I would think your best bet is to go ahead and get certified and use the aid job as experience, but don't expect to get a teacher position at the same location."
Teachers,3dydmf,Collegeen,3,Mon Jul 20 15:27:05 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, yes. Working as a paraprofessional is, in my opinion, the best way to be prepared to become a teacher. I worked as a para for 3 years, then student taught, then accepted a teaching position in the same district."
Teachers,3dydmf,H_Floyd,2,Mon Jul 20 18:13:51 2015 UTC,"I also think it's a great idea! I was a para for around a year with older kids then recently switched over to preschool as I work on my bachelor's for ECE. I plan to move out of state once I'm done & start looking for teaching jobs:)  Best of luck, OP and keep your mind open to other locations once you're qualified :)"
Teachers,3dydmf,bro20blazeit,2,Mon Jul 20 20:47:20 2015 UTC,I think any position in a school is a good way to get your foot in the door AND help you make certain that you really enjoy the work. Don't rule out anything that gives you a chance to work with students and staff alike. Even the current NEA president started out as a lunch lady! ;)
Teachers,3dydmf,CatShirtFTW,2,Mon Jul 20 21:00:12 2015 UTC,"Bad idea, get certified and jump in. This is the real world and making money is part of it. You'll never be prepared. The only way to become a good teacher is too actually do it. Keep your head up and don't doubt yourself. Confidence is the key."
Teachers,3dx4rt,panda1312,5,Mon Jul 20 07:00:47 2015 UTC,"The biggest thing for me, dealing wth students like that, is to not take their behavior personally. As soon as you take what they are doing to heart you lose your composure.  In regards to behavior you can write up a behavior contract for them to agree to and sign with a set of consequences agreed upon by you and the student. If the student wants no part then you can go to the parent to see what they find as acceptable punishment.  When that student acts out you follow the consequences. This way they fight with you less because you told them exactly hat would happen in detail.  You can also set up a reflection desk with a worksheet to have them fill out.   If a student is upset they need a good couple of minutes to calm down so have them sit back there and chill for a while. Once you see they are calming down ask them to work on the sheet.  These don't always work and some students are just going to keep acting out no matter what.  I always try to pull some time from my schedule (I'm a specials teacher, so it's easier for me) to sit with my ""trouble"" students at least once a month to check on them, talk things out, ask why they acted like that and what a better response could have been. Basically reviewing the questions I would put on a reflection sheet with them in person."
Teachers,3dx4rt,misskaitykat,5,Mon Jul 20 12:32:24 2015 UTC,"My biggest thing is to follow through on my ""threats."" Eg. If I say I will call mum, she's getting a call. If I say they are going to the coordinators, they're going. I don't make threats I can't follow through on.  If they want the last word? Let them have it, that's the end. Move on. It's tough, but the reason they keep talking back is because you're biting back."
Teachers,3dx4rt,historicalhobbyist,2,Mon Jul 20 09:29:17 2015 UTC,Thank you! I will definitely be following through on everything and hold my tongue when they are baiting!
Teachers,3dx4rt,blankenstaff,2,Mon Jul 20 09:44:39 2015 UTC,"Agree, and to follow up: Do you have dogs, OP? If so, you might try to respond to these problematic students similarly to how you would treat dogs acting out like this. I've found that students, children, and dogs are very similar: They are most comfortable when there are firm, clear boundaries, and their natural tendency is to push these boundaries until they find (through experience) that you decide where the boundaries are.  By the way, I know that sometimes people get offended when I compare people and dogs, but I mean it as a compliment. I LOVE dogs.  Be firm, kind, and consistent. All three, every single time."
Teachers,3dx4rt,historicalhobbyist,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:30:40 2015 UTC,"When I first read that I was thinking ""what is this person talking about??"" But yes, very similar!"
Teachers,3dx4rt,milton_franks,4,Mon Jul 20 22:09:01 2015 UTC,"I really struggled with following through with threats as well. If students have no consequences they will play up more. They could also be testing you, trying to push you and see how you will react."
Teachers,3dx4rt,Howls_Castle,3,Mon Jul 20 09:53:05 2015 UTC,"What has worked with me in the past with these students are getting to know them and their family. Build a relationship. Usually these types of children have some reason to act out-- they are embarrassed by their school performance, dad or mom sleeps around, their parent got arrested for drugs, their mom works three jobs and is never home, dad cannot afford food, mom and dad pay a nanny to care for the child and never really bond with them. I found most kids who act out are missing out on love/caring in their lives for whatever reason.  Also, many students see going to the principal's office or leaving class to think about their behavior as a reward so they don't have to be in class. I would stop sending kids to sit outside to think and rarely, rarely send kids to the office for thsi reason."
Teachers,3dx4rt,Linguiste,2,Mon Jul 20 17:20:27 2015 UTC,"I'm currently reading Lost at School by Ross W. Greene, PhD., and his philosophy is to seek to understand what is prompting students to exhibit these undesirable behaviors. Often, the cause of these behaviors is some sort of cognitive skill delay (such as: difficulty changing tasks, difficulty maintaining focus, or difficulty handing frustration).  Rather than punishing the behavior (which is often a symptom of some type of cognitive deficit), he suggests working with the student, parents, and learning team to get the student up to speed on these delays.  It's been an eye-opening book, and I intend on using its strategies with my eighth graders this year."
Teachers,3dx4rt,gimmefantastic,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:11:19 2015 UTC,"I agree with a lot of the advice here: - first and foremost, build a relationship with the student. try starting with the 2 by 10 strategy.   try & diagnose the root cause of the behavior instead of simply reacting to it.  is the student bored, control seeking, anxious, is the work too hard, etc if the student wants to have the last word, let em.  engaging in arguments and power struggles is never a win for adults.  make sure to issue consequences but never engage in arguments.  redirect the student privately (i like to do outside the door with an eye on the class at the same time). do not give the kid an audience.  if they keep yelling, arguing etc i say something like ""i already let you know that i need you to step outside, i'm done talking to you until you follow directions""   good luck!  edit: formatting"
Teachers,3dx4rt,ilovethelionking,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:33:51 2015 UTC,"First off, I'm not a teacher, I'm a college student looking to go into teaching. Honestly, looking back to high school, I can hardly remember a time when I was in a situation where one of my peers was disrespectful. One thing I know, from the kids' perspective is, if you've been a pushover, made a fool out of yourself, not been assertive, etc etc than students will lose your respect and they will treat you badly. Like others have said, the first thing you need to do is follow through on threats and punishments. A second tactic is one I picked up from my English teacher, she always says she ""doesn't do discipline"" and it's true, she sucks at traditional discipline. However, she uses humiliation tactics to get students to behave, she usually has a sarcastic quip in return to disrespectful comments. If students are on their phone, you better believe she's calling on you next, if you complain about work, she's just like ""that's unfortunate"" and moves on. Despite all this, she's an extremely popular teacher, she lets you banter with her to the point of disrespect as long as you buckle down when necessary. Long tangent aside, I think isolation, humor, ignoring/not giving the satisfaction of a reply/calls to parents would all work. Just make sure to be assertive."
Teachers,3dx4rt,Sssarahhh28,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:49:35 2015 UTC,"There's some really good advice in here, but I'll add my two cents:  Don't ever engage in an argument with a student. If you're arguing with them, they've automatically won the argument.   It's really helpful to pull students aside when you're correcting them about behavior. Sometimes they act much differently when they don't have an audience and there's not as much incentive for them to argue with you because nobody's there to see it.   Like a few others have said, make sure you follow through on anything you ""threaten"" and make sure you're not threatening outrageous things that you CAN'T follow through on.   Maintain contact with parents...this can be tough, because a lot of the students you have issues with are the ones with parents who aren't very involved. With my tougher students in alt ed, I would update their parents on their progress every week or every couple of weeks at least...that way their positive behavior is being acknowledged along with negative behaviors and parents and students alike don't feel like you're ""attacking"" them and only focused on their mistakes.   Building relationships is KEY. We had a gang problem at my old school and it was super obvious who the leaders were; there was one kid who gave me HELL at the beginning of the year (like made jerking off hand motions while I was talking to him and other crazy shit kind of hell) but by the second half, he realized I wasn't going anywhere and would follow through on things. I wouldn't say he really liked me, but he respected me enough that he realized it wasn't worth it to try and challenge me every minute of the day. Other students saw that and since he was the leader and he didn't act like a fool in my class, they stopped acting like fools in my class as well (at least mostly....they were behaviorally challenged middle schoolers, after all). It's a long process, and especially if you're at a new school it will take some time. But consistency and being more strict at the beginning than you feel like you need to be REALLY pays off by the end of the year. You'll probably still have issues here and there, but reducing them to a rare occurrence is still great. Don't beat yourself up; you can't use mind control, but you can manage behaviors as they happen!"
Teachers,3dx4rt,Sssarahhh28,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:01:52 2015 UTC,"Oh, and I'll also leave you with my favorite line for when students will not stop trying to argue with me/verbally attack me over something: ""I'll be happy to talk to you privately when you feel calm enough to talk about the problem like an adult. Please let me know when you're ready."" Obviously it can't be in the middle of instruction, but there were several times when students actually asked to come see me on my prep period and we did talk about the problem. One of my happiest moments at the end of the year happened after a kid screamed at me in class and I had to remove him..he came to me on his own the next day and said ""I'm ready to talk to you calmly, do you have a few minutes?"""

Teachers,3dvkcv,gimmefantastic,4,Mon Jul 20 00:03:23 2015 UTC,"This year I'm assigning first seats by using 2 sets of playing cards. I'll tape a card from one deck to each spot. As I greet them at the door, I'll give them a random card and they find their match. We start on a Thursday so I'll probably continue that through our first full week before I assign seats.  I made a rap that outlines my entry and exit procedures as well as some of my main behavior expectation. I'm recording a video so I can't mess up an embarrass myself. To go with it I have a sheet with the lyrics, a place for them to explain what each segment means, and a place to go over it as a class. That's our lesson for day 1.  On day 2 we'll talk about respect and the students will decide how students can be respectful to the teacher and other students and how a teacher can be respectful to them. Those get made into. Contract that we'll sign on the 3rd and 4th day  (we see all classes the first two days and then we switch to block scheduling).  I use the first two days when I see all my classes to focus on procedures and expectations. After that we start normal classes with more time allowed for transitions, learning procedures as we go, and work expectations."
Teachers,3dvkcv,undependent_1,2,Mon Jul 20 06:36:08 2015 UTC,What grade/subject do you teach?  Your ideas are phenomenal and might work well for my artistic needs albeit with some tweaking. I would guess that you aren't high school unless you teach 9th grade (which this would certainly be viable in as a means of preparing them for high school).
Teachers,3dvkcv,leeshis0019,2,Mon Jul 20 17:36:40 2015 UTC,I teach 8th grade language arts. I think in high school I'd still do the 1st day activities but modify the respect part to something more age appropriate.
Teachers,3dvkcv,undependent_1,3,Mon Jul 20 18:13:56 2015 UTC,"O', okay. That makes sense. If there's one thing that high school students do not want a lecture on it's respect. Let alone do they want to talk about it.  At my school we talk about developing character in a student. Respect is part of that, but it's mostly about being a good person and being able to learn from mistakes. I think it's an excellent topic for high school students, but unfortunately it isn't implemented very well. We used to reward students we believed to have good character with coupons, free lunches/drinks (from sponsors) and a medal that they'd proudly show off.  Due to cutbacks and the recent advent of new assessment and evaluation measures taking up a bulk of of the budget it became difficult to get those things. I hope we are able to start it up again. The students noticed it and were upset that we stopped. I told my students outright that it was just a ""money problem"" and they understood, but they were still upset."
Teachers,3dvkcv,leeshis0019,2,Tue Jul 21 01:06:42 2015 UTC,"I think with high schoolers I would ask them to explain what a teacher can do to show respect to them in the context of helping me do better. For their rules I'd go with having them establish norms for direct instruction, group work, and independent work. I'm not 100% sure. High school is the only level I haven't worked with in the classroom. I'm certified for 1st though 12th but I hope to stay in 8th grade for a long time."

Teachers,3dvkcv,flowerofhighrank,3,Mon Jul 20 14:10:12 2015 UTC,"Mix it up: The first day of school is both exciting and filled with anxiety. Students are greeting friends, talking about summer and worrying about classes. When I was going to school the first day usually meant a reading of the syllabus and a quick activity for learning names. Sometimes it was just the syllabus and maybe some pre-test.  Instead of that do a game of some sort. It doesn't have to be related to your content, but it can be. Find something that's fun and structured well. Obviously, making it age appropriate as well. High school students won't like what elementary school students like (at least most of them won't). It is also an opportunity to start your classroom management on the first day. Explain the objectives and rules: if someone isn't listening then get onto them. It's even better if you have them work in groups because you can start to enforce that part of your behavior plan as well."

I have posted this a few times already, but I am going to have my students ""Build the tallest, free-standing tower in 10 minutes using jellybeans and spaghetti.  I have done this before and enjoyed it immensely. The students seemed to enjoy it as well and I think it got us started on the right footing.  I have done brain teasers on the first day as well sometimes involving thr use of different classroom materials.   I actually want to try and incorporate some kind of artistic game or activity on the first day, but I cant really think of anything. Maybe having them come up with a design for the bulletin board?  I also do activities that has them moving around. I will give them a multiple intelligences survey and have them complete it. This usually takes about 10 minutes. Around the room I have laminated the intelligence with a description and they have to put their name on a post-it note and onto the paper. We usually spend some time discussing each intelligence and how it might be best to study and practice. I dont talk about their best way to learn because that is under my control and it's usually far too difficult to accomodate for the wackier ideas. As much as teaching outside is fun it is hard to do it even just once a week."
Teachers,3dvkcv,leeshis0019,2,Mon Jul 20 03:37:27 2015 UTC,"I'd reconsider engaging them with material about ""multiple intelligences,"" especially considering that the concept is more likely a fallacy than fact."

I know well that it is ""more likely a fallacy than fact"" as I wrote a paper on the context of multiple intelligence within curriculum writing. It's hogwash to believe that catering to a specific method or within a specific modality will improve learning.  The point I make to the students is that it's important to try and experience all types of learning and to understand that it is not a one-size-fits-all experience."

I worked with and learned from current researchers in the field within the last 3 years and while there are certainly specific intelligence researchers who don't believe in it, it hasn't been discounted by the field as a whole. MI is still taught as a valid theory of intelligence in both psychology and education programs."

Teachers,3dvkcv,jcal9,3,Mon Jul 20 11:26:38 2015 UTC,I prefer not to assign seats on the first day specifically so I get a better sense of who shouldn't sit near each other or who I can trust to sit by their friends.

Teachers,3dvkcv,jcal9,2,Mon Jul 20 13:15:26 2015 UTC,Maybe instead of directly assigning seats you can do so indirectly. Someone mentioned taping cards to desks and handing out cards as they greet students. The students find the match and sit. You aren't telling them where they sit--the cards are telling them where to sit.  :o

Teachers,3dwvpa,chipsnsalsa13,3,Mon Jul 20 05:08:46 2015 UTC,"I don't have any web links to guide you, but I can share some tips I've learned through experience and PD.     Use visuals for the important stuff and refer back to them.  Hand gestures will also work. Write out notes or at least important phrases if students are expected to take notes. Do not talk with your back turned away from the class. Give students the opportunity to Think-Pair-Share (T-P-S) before being asked to respond to a challenging question and/or after learning something new.  (Ex: ""Turn to your partner and T-P-S: How do plants get their energy?). Teach them vocabulary directly.  Make vocabulary instruction for your content part of your instruction.  When you say, ""Analyze the samples and then make a conclusion,"" there is a good chance that your English learners will not know or fully comprehend analyze, samples, and conclusion.  Teach them academic vocabulary as well as content specific words. Use rewordify to lower the complexity of some articles.  Or give that website as a resource to students when completing research. Give wait time before calling on students to answer. Allow your limited English students to draw their responses, if appropriate. Provide sentence stems or examples when asking for complete sentence responses.  How much does the formula weigh?  The formula weighs _____ lbs. and ___ oz.  What is your hypothesis?  Explain why you chose this hypothesis.  My hypothesis is _____.  I chose this hypothesis because... Repeat the important stuff. Try to remind yourself to speak more slowly and clearly when giving new information. If possible, pair a students with higher achieving peers.  To make it fair, pair a low with a medium and a medium with a high.  With your lowest ELLs, try to pair them with a partner who speaks their home language. Provide examples of the kind of work you expect (notes, labs, essays, etc.). If you show a video, try to use closed captioning so your ELLs can read the English words.  It helps them to see the words when spoken, and they might pick up more of the content that way. If possible, have Spanish-to-English or other language translation dictionaries available in class.  Encourage your students to use them.  If not available, consider allowing students to use their phones for Google translate (this can become a classroom management issue, so set it up beforehand). If you want students to write essays, you will need to teach them how to write that type of essay (ex: research will require writing a thesis, breaking topics into paragraphs, and writing a conclusion).   I'm really excited that you're asking for ideas.  Too often I see a lot of content teachers who expect their ELL students will just get it.  Many teachers seem to think that our ELLs are only supposed to receive language instruction and support in their ESL class.  PM if you want to bounce ideas around or you want me to look at a specific lesson plan to give ideas for making it more effective for ELLs.    EDIT: typo"
Teachers,3dwvpa,AwesomeLandia,2,Mon Jul 20 14:13:59 2015 UTC,"You can also provide the translation of some important words beforehand, if you know your students' L1.  A lot of English words have cognates in Spanish that can help your students.  Analyze is analizar."

There is some sort of paint that turns the surface into a chalkboard and another that turns things into whiteboards. I saw lots of discussions about the whiteboard one years ago when I was considering painting over my chalkboard, and the general consensus was not to use it because it didn't work.    Also, in terms of colors, you might want to choose one of your school colors (or a shade of it, if your school has too dark or completely obnoxious spirit colors, heh).  When our school was remodeled, they did at least one of the walls in all of the rooms in one of the school colors, and it looks quite spirited!"

Teachers,3dw0ct,mngirlintexas,4,Mon Jul 20 00:16:07 2015 UTC,"9th Grade ELA Teacher here:  Exit slips are a great option for assessment and mastery. What I love about them is their flexibility. You can use them formatively to show you what students picked up from a cold read, a lecture, a grammar or vocabulary set, etc. You can also use them summatively as a quiz, reflection, or synthesis activity.  Also, the term ""exit slip"" was initially deceiving to me because I strongly associated it with the end of the class period (leaving my room, students have learned x today) but exit slips can work on bigger (and, more importantly, smaller) scales. Microassessments, given immediately after learning, implementation, collaboration, or discussion, can be used to quickly inform a teacher how to proceed with the next part of class (for instant exit slips, see Zipgrade https://www.zipgrade.com/, Kahoot, or the Smartboard Smart Response software). Because of all of these possibilities, I see exit slips as exits to any set increment of learning.   I throughly enjoy using them. I'm sorry your mentor teacher is not in sync with you. Not knowing the particulars, I cannot speak on their behalf (or yours). However, in the past ten years, public education has changed significantly. This person may be trying to look out for you."
Teachers,3dw0ct,NoTeeNoShade,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:10:36 2015 UTC,"Thank you for such an informative reply! I will definitely look into Zipgrade; I hadn't thought about using Kahoot as an exit slip, either, but that would work well.  I also appreciate your feedback regarding the mentor question.  I have been slightly surprised at how much has changed in the past ten years, and I think she's trying to redirect my focus to the students passing the state test as opposed to pulling in new/multicultural novels and idea like that. Hopefully I can find a good middle ground!"
Teachers,3dw0ct,undependent_1,3,Mon Jul 20 20:51:57 2015 UTC,I'm terrible at actually doing Exit Tickets before dismissal. So this year I'm reworking my class schedule and my exit ticket won't be the last thing we do and I probably won't do one every day just when I want to check for understanding. I've decided my conclusion to each class will be my students making two tweets with hashtags (on paper) in which they summarize what we actually did in class and what topic or skill we focused on. I chose to do this so we can end class the same every day and I can use an exit ticket as needed.  I plan to use them on one of my bulletin boards just to highlight what we've been working on.
Teachers,3dw0ct,undependent_1,2,Mon Jul 20 06:50:29 2015 UTC,I like that bulletin board idea! Stealing it :)

Teachers,3dw0ct,Lulahula01,2,Mon Jul 20 21:29:03 2015 UTC,"First, re: Exit Slips.  I teach Math and Science, so I suppose the process may be somewhat different for me than you, but nonetheless: I use them whenever I want to do a quick check to see where EVERYONE in my class is with their understanding of some concept, and I want to do it in a relatively short amount of time (like when I go to the door with them on the way out).    Regarding your enthusiasm - which I think is great, FWIW - you have to do your own thing because if you try to do things someone else's way, you'll just end up doing it poorly.  I knew from very early in my career that I simply could not be the ""I am the law"" type of teacher, and it took me a while to become comfortable with that.  I'm a relationship-builder and find that my students do my work because they trust that it is valuable because I think it is valuable; all of our interactions are based on shared trust.  They believe that I want the best for them, and I believe they are doing the best they can at any given moment.  Do fit in with the group that you are working with, but do not go in lockstep with them.  You will become so tired and disillusioned!  Experiment - try new things - it is the only way to grow and learn."

I believe that even the most reluctant student can find value in a lesson if there's a level of trust and respect--and in writing that out, I see how I should approach the feedback/advice I get from my mentor.  Thank you!"
Teachers,3dw0ct,preposterous-hypothe,2,Mon Jul 20 20:57:28 2015 UTC,"Exit slips are one fom of formative assessment. I call them check ups and may give them in the beginning, middle or end of a period. I use them to see if I need to spend more time on a topic or if we can move on.  I don't grade them. As with most formative assessment, we often use them to guide instruction, not as a summative measure.   New teacher enthusiasm is great. Just make sure your ideas are driven by academic pursuits and not cutesyness. Often I see teachers pintresting their lessons or doing tricks (I'm in math) , when the substance of what they're doing is lacking and will make next year more difficult. The mentor may be trying to give you some suggestions based on the culture of the school. I always reply, ""thank you for your feedback, it gives me something to think about"". And then you should do what you think will work best for your students."

Teachers,3dva7j,panfriedmayo,6,Sun Jul 19 23:38:41 2015 UTC,"Here's the thing: as a first-year teacher, you have no idea what your teaching style is like. You probably have some thoughts from student teaching, but all student teachers mimic their mentors quite a bit. So, lots of that first year is discovering what works for you and what doesn't.   It will be hard to identify that if you're relying heavily on someone else's work. If you have a terrible day in the classroom as a first-year, it could be any number of things: your management could be off, your procedures could be a hindrance, your lesson might be aimed too high or too low, or it could just be everyone had a simultaneously crappy day. Add another factor in (""I didn't understand the ins & outs of the lesson/used a technique that is totally NOT ME"") and you make it harder to identify what went wrong -- especially if you don't have confidence in your lesson. What works in one classroom doesn't necessarily work in another, and if you're relying entirely on another teacher's lesson it will become very easy for you to start thinking, ""why isn't this working? The old teacher did X for years and had no trouble... maybe I'm the problem!"" when the real problem might just be that you don't own the plans!   So, this is a long way of saying... do what you feel comfortable with. If you're not comfortable everything will become that much harder. Use the lessons however much you want -- entirely, not at all, or somewhere in between. Likely, you'll start the school year off 100% your own and as you get more comfortable start cribbing from the other person. That is absolutely okay."
Teachers,3dva7j,EarlofWiseborough,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:55:31 2015 UTC,"I still hear from veteran teachers, ""oh! I should've done x"" or ""I'll do x next year!"" So no lesson is always perfect, it can be changed. But being the control freak I am, I want the lesson to be perfect the first time (this is truly impossible - I know).  Thank you so much for your advice! This really helped. I suppose I cannot rely too heavily on others work, especially when I have no input, so I am no confident. I felt this way a lot as a student teacher. I was a bit limited on what I could do and often my cooperating teacher would give me her lessons and have me just put my own feel into (this was a very difficult as our teaching styles, I could tell, were very different).  I want to own this year :) I am just afraid of passing up good lessons or resources."
Teachers,3dva7j,EarlofWiseborough,2,Sun Jul 19 23:41:15 2015 UTC,"I am just afraid of passing up good lessons or resources.    Just because a lesson is good for someone else doesn't mean it's good for you. So you can't know whether you're passing up on something good unless you already have your own frame of reference!  Your first year is already going to be full of anxiety and worry and doubting yourself, so do whatever you need to minimize that. Whether that means storing or using or modifying the other teacher's plans is completely up to you. Most teaching programs emphasize best practices, giving the impression that there is one best way to do thing, and so many first year teachers chase the idea of doing the absolute objectively best thing at any given moment. It sounds like you have a little bit of that by worrying about passing up on a good resource. But, really, what you should be working on is finding things that work for you. Don't tie yourself to resources that don't work for you, and don't feel like you have to create everything from scratch to prove yourself."
Teachers,3dwd00,BigGulpHuh,2,Mon Jul 20 02:09:59 2015 UTC,"Depending on who the lesson is for, I might suggest this one: http://reasonandwonder.com/charge/  I think this would work especially well if you are able to have your ""students"" work for a bit on their own before the reveal at the end. When I have done this lesson, it was toward the beginning of our unit on slope/graphing lines. I basically structured it the way it's described in the link.   My favorite part (and the big takeaway, I think) is that while it looks linear and your might project out to a time when the phone is fully charged, the REAL data doesn't match. It opens a lot of good, yet short discussion about how math is good to model, but models aren't always perfect and we have to critique/interpret our results.   It is sooooo satisfying to have a class all go ""Whaaaa?"" and stare at the real data in disbelief. They want to know what's up and why their math failed them when in reality, it didn't!"
Teachers,3dwd00,icookmath,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:22:38 2015 UTC,"I would take one of your best middle school lessons and just increase it to more high school. For example, you probably taught slope and linear equations in middle school. Well, we do that in Algebra 1 also. Focus on trying to engage students.... I agree with the other post about using some sort of data to examine functions. It's really cool and engaging. illustrativemathematics has some great stuff too."

In the meantime, read Carol Dweck's ""Mindset,"" watch Penny Kittle vids on YouTube, find Richard Allington's ""What I Learned..."" article, and stock up on pens and sticky notes.

Lots of schools and districts have the resources to have teams of qualified teachers working on planning and they post these guides to district  websites. You can find guides that include objectives, standards, activities, topics, and texts for each week of the school year. Find a a few that you like and adapt them for your classes."

It is overwhelming at first (okay, it keeps being overwhelming sometimes after the first...), but having a variety of classes keeps the days lively (I used to teach fewer classes at a bigger school). Since you have everyone (thus aren't dependent on what others teach as much), a useful place to start is mapping out the big picture. Sketching out what units you aim to do in each class now can be a great help when you actually go to flesh out lessons later."

Please make sure to see if there is a strict guideline on how your school/department needs the syllabus.   There usually is a week or a few days before school starts where you should be meeting with your fellow teachers to discuss this and create PLCs to help each other. If you don't have that going for you, start one."

Teachers,3dtdi2,NoTeeNoShade,4,Mon Jul 20 02:19:24 2015 UTC,"If your school uses certain email clients (I know Google does, for a fact), setting up all of the contacts into groups can save you a ton of time throughout the year. I have two groups for each type of class (Bio, Chem, etc), with one group being just students and the other just parents. I normally wait about a week in to set this up though, since kids will drop and transfer classes the first few days. But, knowing HOW is a huge plus.  You might want to look into how discipline is done at the school. Some schools have a pretty simple procedure. Others (like mine) have a pretty complex behavior reinforcement system that sometimes causes new teachers a bit of confusion.  If you are teaching freshmen classes, you might want to contact the middle school English department head(s) to see if there is anything in particular the kids coming in are struggling with.  If you haven't already, start making procedures for your class. How are kids turning in homework, starting the class, leaving the class, etc.  Set up any online accounts you might want to use and get familiar with them. My favorites are Quizlet, Kahoot.it, Socrative, Remind, Plicker, Dropbox/Google Drive, and some sort of online planner (Planbook and Planboard are pretty good). If possible, I highly suggest using non-work emails if allowed. I had a nightmare with a former district and had a hell of a time transferring things after I left because of it."
Teachers,3dtdi2,mngirlintexas,4,Sun Jul 19 19:58:44 2015 UTC,"Set up your classroom management plan and script/design your syllabus and supplies list. You will not be able to really collaborate too much right now but you can certainly design a set plan of routines and procedures you want students to follow. Download your school's handbook, skim it, and start from there. Here's an example of a planned first day:  I am a freshmen English teacher. I had minimal discipline problems last year. Last year, I purchased the Wong's Classroom Management and adapted it for my needs; all levels can make use of that text. I implemented it from day one. http://imgur.com/2cWE9OI The procedures that stuck were the procedures I put the most time in. The BEST one by far was this: http://imgur.com/TRqCv3R All procedures were represented with images on my PowerPoint: http://imgur.com/B0B6ANH http://imgur.com/anlEwF2 This year, I'm going to kick it up a notch! Here's my go-to: I seat people (in an alphabetical seating chart) as they walk in, then I ask them to grab a copy of a student survey that asks them about their previous experiences in my subject, what their priorities are, how they perform, etc. While they fill out the survey, I walk around and individually introduce myself to each student: I shake their hand, I say welcome to my class, I ask for their name (seating chart in hand, making pronunciation corrections and name preferences) and simultaneously take attendance. When the survey is complete, I start to use the seating chart and teach them our first class-wide procedure: passing in papers. Then I hand out the syllabi by practicing the same procedure in reverse: passing back papers. Then, we read through the documents traditionally. This year, however, I'm going to tweak the script because Jim Burke @englishcomp, my idol teacher, also gives students a painting to reflect on: http://imgur.com/bHyMdwR Example: Why would this be an iconic or relevant painting to think about on day one? Side note: I'm also been really invested in higher order thinking skills over this summer and stumbled across Harvard's Project Zero's Artful Thinking http://www.pz.gse.harvard.edu/artful_thinking.php which has a ton of interesting (and purposeful) formative assessment ideas for higher order thinking about ANY subject, not just art. However, because I will use that Burke painting, I'm totally going to introduce Artful Thinking to complement the painting either day one, day two, or day three. But those are just tentative plans..."

Teachers,3dte9s,CatShirtFTW,12,Sun Jul 19 20:14:40 2015 UTC,"I wear nothing but TOMS.   Most schools won't get on you for your footwear- teaching is a job where you're on your feet all day. A good administration recognizes this and acknowledges it. If your admin is harping on something like shoes, it might be time to find a different school; focusing on professional dress is often a sign that administration has little ""control"" in other aspects of the school day."
Teachers,3dte9s,llammacheese,4,Sun Jul 19 11:58:39 2015 UTC,"focusing on professional dress is often a sign that administration has little ""control"" in other aspects of the school day.   Sometimes. My admin cares about professional dress A Lot, but gives a great degree of freedom in the classroom. One day I asked him why , he told me (and we're in a high poverty urban area), that we have to sell education. We're competing against a lot of bad influences in the neighborhood with gangs and drugs that sell a very easy yet attractive lifestyle. The best thing, and I tend to agree, in such situation is to be respectful, be kind, and be sharp. He does the same with school uniforms. I stepped up my game after that.  This is a traditional public school, mind you. No fancy uniform games like I see in the charters. Though something can be said for it."
Teachers,3dte9s,robocaller,2,Sun Jul 19 15:31:38 2015 UTC,"I spent the last three years working in Title 1 schools, and I completely agree. As a man and a coach I wear a full suit and tie every Monday at a minimum, and sometimes 2-3 times during a week.   (1) Inevitability I get complemented on my ""tuxedo"" when I wear my charcoal grey three-piece. I take this as a brief learning opportunity to show and explain the difference in both type and appropriateness to students.   (2) Pay attention to classroom management on days where you dress professional, it is far easier. Some of my teacher besties, who still dress like they are undergrads, often need me to step into their room to regain control, typically the suit does the job for me.  (3)  Poor or wealthy school, you are selling Education. Often times in the US, the professionalism and capabilities of teachers get called into question, especially in more affluent areas. If you are dressed like you are going to a ballgame at your job, you create a less than professional image of yourself to students and parents, and reflect poorly upon the profession."
Teachers,3dte9s,dabear2002,2,Sun Jul 19 22:50:06 2015 UTC,"Exactly. I did notice a definite change in the way students respond to teachers who dress more formally. I don't tend to wear ties, particularly in the hotter months, but a suit without the tie does the same. I wear a suit four days a week now. As an ESL teacher, I've had the same students since year 1, so the transformation in behavior was not as swift. But I can tell a difference when I walk down the hall."
Teachers,3dte9s,robocaller,4,Mon Jul 20 04:35:51 2015 UTC,"The only exception to this is open toe shoes. Those can be a ssfety risk for the teacher quite easily, depending on the classroom/population. If you are in SPED I wouldn't be mad if admin spoke to you about wearing open toes."
Teachers,3dte9s,massholeteacher86,5,Sun Jul 19 12:38:18 2015 UTC,"In my experience, Title I schools expect teachers to dress more professionally than other schools. (I was told that this is because many students do not have the opportunity to see people in professional dress whereas students at more affluent schools have parents who wear suits to work everyday). Also, the higher the grade level, the higher the expectation for professional dress.   I would not invest in buying a lot before school starts that way you can get a feel for what is acceptable for your school.    At my daughter's school, Tom's, Chacos, and Yellow Box flip-flops are the norm for teachers. At my school, dressier shoes are required.   I've found that Easy Spirit makes a lot of flats that literally feel like sneakers. They are so comfortable. While most of their shoes look ""old lady,"" they have a lot of plan flats that don't look any different than more stylish brands, but they feel so much better."

Personally, I'd play it by ear and wait to see what everyone else wears before buying new shoes. Some schools are quite formal while others are much more relaxed. As an example, at some schools I've worked in sandals were fine; in others, that was the kind of thing that would get you talked to by admin about appropriate workwear.   If you do need a pair of more formal shoes (I dress formally on Mondays, and for parent-teacher interviews etc.) you could try shopping for shoes targeted at nurses. There are plenty of plain black shoes designed for people who are on their feet all day - maybe try a trip to the Athlete's Foot or somewhere of the like to try on a few pairs and see if there are any that don't cause you pain?"

In a title I school myself, worn them for 2 years now and no one's said anything.  I've NEVER worn dress shoes to school. Something to consider though: If you've got foot problems, see if you can get a doctor's note and wear tennis shoes.

However, because I had worked at the shoe store, I found all sorts of weird styles in crazy colors through old contacts. People (students and staff) notice my footwear (it's hard not to), but I've never had a problem in terms of it being labeled unprofessional attire.  I do have some TOMS, Jambu, Teva (yes, flip-flops!), and Simple GreenToe shoes that I've added into the rotation over the years.

What I learned from watching the video was that things went MUCH better than I remembered - I was WAY nicer than I would have thought.  This was because most of the shitty things I was saying was only in my head.  I thought "" just shut up"" several times, I screamed at them ""aughhhh I just told you this five seconds ago"" - but only in my head.  What came out was ""I am waiting until it is quiet"" and ""is there anyone who can explain it another way?"".   All the negativity was in my memory, but only because it was in my head.

Teachers,3dqnv0,waxlrose,2,Sun Jul 19 18:02:50 2015 UTC,"Sure. But let's be real - Even in a charter it seems fishy. Part of the issue with charter is finding quality replacements. You have a teacher that is well liked by both teachers and students, yet gets yanked three months in? Hmmmm."

But they might need to hear about those  really boring lessons-- I remember teaching one aspect of English 1 that was just grinding it out. There wasn't a dog-and-pony way to teach it-- you just had to get the information and memorize it.

She didn't study, apart from using the very short study guide provided by the FTCE on their website.   She has a history degree, but even 4 years out of college, thought the exam was extraordinarily easy to pass without any prep. I believe you only need a 60-65% to pass.

I explained to him that when we're at school, I'm a teacher and need to be treated like all the other teachers. The situation ended up having to go higher up for various reasons, but when he and I and a member of admin sat down, she suggested that if he can't remember to call me by my title at school that he should call me Ms Lastname when he says hello over the fence as well.  I haven't had any issues since. I doubt you'll get questions, but if kids who know you outside of school slip and call you by your first name it should be pretty easy to manage. I can't imagine that church youth group kids will do it to be deliberately disrespectful, so a gentle reminder should do the trick."

The compromise I eventually settled on was to call all my students by their last names also, as a way of establishing a formal tone for class and emphasizing mutual teacher-student respect.

Teaching is a specialized career with specialized skills beyond just content knowledge. Having properly trained teachers gives better results in student outcomes.  Having an approved program means that you've done proper training, whether it's through a traditional certification route or an alternative program that trains you while on the job.  Now, as for the cost of the programs, that's an issue with the cost of higher education in general and a completely different discussion."

Look at how many posts are made on here by first year teachers on their last thread of sanity ready to leave teaching all together. As someone who has frustration cried their first year  in the supply closet multiple occasions because I was overwhelmed by my students and their parents, lesson planning and a bitchy principal believe me you're going to want more training and guidance than test prep this coming from someone who had passed all tests on the first try and gotten near perfect ratings as a student teacher.

Teachers,3drvs4,shadowcat0204,4,Sun Jul 19 00:08:15 2015 UTC,"My biggest defense of the CC, which I'm not wild about but which is not any more asinine than our own state standards, is that it enables a student to move from state to state or even district to district and not be faced with a completely different experience that doesn't build on what they've already been taught. There's something to be said for uniformity across the states.  Also, all the countries we routinely praise as being amazing at education (Singapore, South Korea, Finland, etc.) have national standards. I would imagine they included more teachers and fewer businessmen in the creation of those standards, however, and that Pearson wasn't consulted on the matter."

However, the way it is implemented by district administrators has been awful (used to push out novels), and I am vocal about that, but I try to make the fact that that is a district decision quite clear.  However, if it is about the appropriateness of the standards at the early childhood/elementary level?  It depends if I'm on the clock or not, because there are several standards that aren't appropriate for the ages they are assigned to.  My grade/subject area is fortunate that it isn't in one of the harmful parts of CCSS, but there are some terrible parts.  (Also, the standards for the different grammar pieces are just ridiculous.  6th graders should be working on a lot more than just pronouns, so I risk being yelled at for using younger standards when I meet them at their need level.)"

I told her that each week when I send home the math homework it comes with a sheet for the parents that details how we are teaching it now that we don't actually teach the standard algorithm.  We had multiple conferences where she slammed public schooling and the standards.  I live in Florida, so we use a modified standard set.  I kept having to explain to her that while I couldn't and didn't choose the standards or the curriculum chosen, the rigor was necessary for success in future grades.  The number of parents I had who questioned the rigor amazed me.  I had parents with older children (I taught first grade so 6-7 yrs old) who didn't have as much homework and it took a few meetings for them to understand that the older children have less homework because they know the things I have to teach.  They know basic CVC words, they know their addition and subtraction math facts, they know how to read and comprehend what they are reading.  These are things I am teaching to ensure that when they get older they aren't failing."
Teachers,3drvs4,THAT_GIRL16,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:33:32 2015 UTC,Off topic but may I ask what type/amount of homework you give? Is it an weekly packet or daily?
Teachers,3drvs4,starraven,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:50:26 2015 UTC,"A little background, at my school there are 6 first grade teachers. We were split into 2 buildings, 3 classes in each building. Due to that fact we as a team differed in what we gave for homework. In my building we did a weekly packet consisting of the phonics and grammar pattern for the following week, sight words, a small paper book with comprehension, and some math. This was given out on Friday and due back on the following Thursday. It was never more than one sheet a night, and we recommended to parents to do the math or the comprehension over the weekend, if they chose to do work over the weekend, because the grammar and phonics hadn't been taught yet so they wouldn't have the knowledge yet. The other half of the teachers did nightly homework. They sent home the same amount and typically the same worksheets just split into days."
Teachers,3drvs4,THAT_GIRL16,3,Sun Jul 19 14:06:15 2015 UTC,"You have to remind them what the CCSS really are: statements about what students should know and be able to do. We need national standards because of this. Acknowledge that a lot of the knee-jerk reactions to the CCSS in instruction and assessment suck, but that the standards themselves and the spirit in which they were written are valuable."
Teachers,3drvs4,ericineducation,4,Sun Jul 19 15:23:01 2015 UTC,"I'll be honest. In this regard I don't care about being downvoted. Most of my problems with them stem from them being backmapped. In other words, they started with what needed to be known by the end of 12th grade and worked backwards. The major issue I have with that is you end up with standards that may be developmentally inappropriate for students. Younger students need to explore things for themselves. They need to be able to take things apart and see how they work...that includes figuring out that if I have two apples, and I take three more, I have five apples. CCSS requires teachers, especially at the younger grades, to use direct instruction to make sure their students master the standards. Students aren't automatons. They are living, breathing, thinking people. Some develop faster than others. We have students in my school that are taking Algebra who can't solve simple math problems. I asked students what half of 435 was (for a lesson on Congress). Most of them had to take out calculators to figure it out. These are 7th graders. When I showed them how to do division long-hand, they acted like they'd never seen it before. I did multiplication long-hand and they said it didn't make sense to them. One student showed me how to do multiplication within a matrix. I asked the math teachers about it and their response was that was how the CCSS instructed students how to find answers. It is no longer enough to know that 2x2=4, now I have to be able to explain how I arrived at that answer and simply saying, ""I did it in my head because that's the answer,"" isn't good enough. According to math teachers that answer lacks ""number sense"", which is something the CCSS states is necessary. What does number sense even mean? No one has been able to explain that to me.  That's why I hate the CCSS. We have to use them. We have to teach them. We have to teach to them. But no one, not us, not our administrators, not people from the NJDOE can explain to me what they are talking about. The only thing I'm told is that it really doesn't change what I teach in my classroom. It has changed my classroom. It has sucked the life from my classroom. My classroom where students were engaged in history and did fun projects related to the subject now has written tests that are designed to model PARCC. Where I used to engage students in realizing that there was a world beyond their small NJ town through the use of current events, I am told there is simply no time for that. I am increasingly wondering what it is I am doing. I feel that the CCSS do students a huge disservice by forcing us all to think, teach, and act the same way. We've stripped anything fun from school. At the younger grades we actively discourage play; then we wonder why kids can't solve problems without acting out. Students get two hours of math, and three hours of ELA, 30 minutes for lunch (no recess, no time), and one hour for science, social studies, art, music, and gym. When they have computers it is really ELA or math time being used to write or solve problems and learn how to manipulate Word or Excel. Kids have always disliked school, now they actively hate it. Who can blame them?"
Teachers,3drvs4,phiwings,5,Sun Jul 19 05:36:57 2015 UTC,"I think you should start reading the math progressions documents. It gives a good idea on how the standards fit together and what they mean. I think of lot of what you are complaining about is how your school is choosing to implement instruction. Also, the CCSS is not PARCC, so conflating the two is really about policy implementation than the standards themselves.   (Also, 2 hours on math is way too much in one day, imo. )The CCSS math are supported by NCTM and NCSM, however if they aren't clearly communicated by the school administration or explained to the people that are actually using them, then problems will occur."
Teachers,3drvs4,Lulahula01,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:55:52 2015 UTC,"PARCC is based on the CCSS however, and since test scores are all that matter we are required to have PARCC-like assessments.  In addition, I'm happy that NCTM and NCSM are supportive of CCSS, however how many early childhood educators helped write these standards for the younger grades?  Also, I don't teach math.  I teach social studies.  All I know is what I see, and what I see is kids who are incapable of doing basic math at the 7th grade level."

Teachers,3drsvt,Mijder,5,Sat Jul 18 21:01:40 2015 UTC,"Standards are the most important, find those!  Find the standards that match up with your unit, and you got everything you need to teach.  Next, grab the book, and see how the book outlines things.  I use my textbooks strictly for structuring my units.  Sometimes I follow the book, sometimes I go my own way, depends on how I value the order of things.  You have to teach the standards though, so go with those primarily.  The book can also be nice to brush up on your history, or what needs to be taught.  In my opinion books are a useless waste of space, my students, if I can get away with it, will never see the inside of a book next year.  Doesn't mean my units aren't designed with the book in mind, after all that's a lot of work already done for you.  For 5 day 90-minute block you're looking at an entire unit, think about how you would teach it.  Allow for plenty of time for practice, and a lot of time for individual work.  You can teach an entire unit in 2 days of block instruction, but your students won't learn an entire unit in 2 days of block instruction.  You can probably get away with a section or two per 45 minutes in your unit.  Come up with good activities for these sections, and you'll find that 5 days at 90 minutes each, is not enough time.   Also remember a well designed unit should allow for testing, and a quiz or two.  Projects can also be a great way to organize a unit around.  Best of luck!"
Teachers,3drsvt,zaijj,3,Sun Jul 19 01:52:54 2015 UTC,"Look up Understanding by Design and the backward design process; this will alleviate a lot of anxiety if you devote some time to learn about how to align your curriculum properly.  In short, you begin with standards, then plan how you'll assess your students meeting them, and lastly plan learning events and lessons to address the assessments.  This helps ensure that your class has substance and direction since all activities and assessments serve a purpose in achieving your desired learning outcomes.  Your textbook should be a resource at most, not the structure of your class."

Textbooks tend to have way more material than is necessary, and backward planning can make sure you hit all the really important stuff while not havng to rush through everything on the text. I'm not a SS teacher, but friends tell me that standards are normally pretty general, and that you need to know how the standards are tested in order to teach them well. See if there are example EoC test questions for the standards, and that will help you prepare even more."

We have standards that cover things like ""Habits of mind"" and so forth that get covered throughout the year no matter what so I generally don't worry about those.  The Content standards are what I focus on. What are they? I work them into an order that makes sense first then go from there.  My first unit covers ""Lab Safety/Usage & Measurements"". So I build assessments around the standards that cover those topics. I'll make my unit test first and decide what's important. Will we cover significant figures? What method of metric conversions should they know? Etc. Then I build lessons around THOSE topics.  I find that this helps much more because you have a goal to work towards rather than a blurry vision of what should be."

I had them come up with other things, too.  ""Which line is blue?""  ""What is the answer to this math problem?""  We tried with with seniors in a senior class, sophomores in a senior class, and juniors in a senior class.  The younger the student the more likely they were to conform.  We tried having everyone give just an oral answer, and then writing down an answer first and then sharing it.  When students committed to writing it down they were more likely to stick with the answer they originally had rather than conform.  Also apparently no one trusted their own math skills so we actually had 100% conformity with the math problems.  The actual experiment only had about 33% conformity though I think...."

ABC looked at the Milgram experiment in 2004 and had a 10 minute video where they recreated it, but stopped the experiment at 150 volts instead of 450.  Along the lines of the Milgram experiment there's the Stanford Prison Experiment (they're making a movie based on it, and there's also one called The Experiment on Netflix that's BASED on it that you can watch).  There's the Ashe Conformity Experiment, and there was a thing in the 1990s called the Strip Search Prank Phone Calls that went on for almost 15 years.  All are good examples to study for human conformity.  All are basic examples taught in any intro to Psychology course.  Confirmation bias, mindless compliance, obedience to authority, etc.  I teach an elective that deals with this.  We end the year with a behavior/conformity unit.

Teachers,3dp6w7,misyo,6,Sat Jul 18 06:14:45 2015 UTC,"Humans like the simpleness of the story of good versus evil.  The Angels versus the Devils.  Saved vs Damned.  For 60 years now, America has portrayed itself as the Savior of World War II to the Demons of Berlin and Tokyo.  Students naturally assume then, that they know all about the ""good"" America, but want to learn about the devil incarnate in the Nazis.  Their grandfathers and uncles fought in this war, they want to know how their eldest family members they've met were the valiant heroes, being the true Captain America's.  In American cinema, the Nazi's stand as the biggest and baddest human villains ever created.  Casablanca, Saving Private Ryan, Band of Brothers,and Indiana Jones are the great examples of this, the latter being best demonstration of this.  The two other villains that they used, Indian Thuggees and Russian Communists, did not play as well.  There's a reason they returned to Nazis after Thuggees.  The heroism of their family members coupled with Hollywood's portrayal sets up the Nazi's as the biggest baddest enemies ever, evil incarnate.  Unsurprisingly, video games have translated them as some of the most popular foes in games, whether they are set in World War II or in alternate realities where the Nazis are zombies tied to the occult.  It means they now get to be their grandfathers and fight the greatest evil the world has ever known, or so they think.  This simple story line means they get to see one of their fairy tales of childhood told again with good triumphing over evil.  They wish to stare into the abyss of humanity.  It's our job to add some nuance, and make sure they realize what else was going on."

Teachers,3dp6w7,henrijonesjr,2,Sat Jul 18 06:11:48 2015 UTC,"A few years ago I read The Kindly Ones by Johnathan Littell.  It's a historical fiction about an SS lieutenant who is present among all aspects of the war- from the mass slaughter in the Ukraine, to Stalingrad, Aushwitz and Birkenau, and finally the fall of Berlin.  It is a difficult novel to read, emotionally.  But this excerpt really stuck with me, and I share it with my students when we read Night by Elie Wiesel.   -“And how do you think this sadism develops?” I asked. “I mean with normal men, without any predisposition that would be revealed under these conditions?” Wirths looked out the window, pensive. He took a long while to reply: “That’s a question I’ve thought a lot about, and it’s difficult to answer, An easy solution would be to blame our propaganda, the way for instance it’s taught here to the troops by Oberscharfuhrer Knittel, who heads the Kulturabteilung: the Haftling is subhuman, he’s not even human, so it’s entirely legitimate to hit him. But that’s not the whole of it—after all, animals aren’t human, either, but none of our guards would treat an animal the way they treat the Haftling. Propaganda does play a role, but in a more complex way. I came to the conclusion that the SS guard doesn’t become violent or sadistic because he thinks the inmate is not a human being; on the contrary, his rage increases and turns into sadism when he sees that the inmate, far from being a subhuman as he was taught, is actually at bottom a man, like him, after all, and it’s this resistance, you see, that the guard finds unbearable, this silent persistence of the other, and so the guard beats him to try to make their shared humanity disappear. Of course, that doesn’t work: the more the guard strikes, the more he’s forced to see that the inmate refuses to recognize himself as a non-human. In the end, no other solution remains for him than to kill him, which is an acknowledgment of complete failure.” Wirths fell silent. He was still looking out the window. I broke the silence: “Can I ask you a personal question, Doktor?” Wirths answered without looking at me; his long, thin fingers tapped the table: “You can ask it.” –“Are you a believer?” He took a while to reply. He was looking outside, toward the street and the crematorium. “I used to be, yes,” he said finally."

She shut all the windows in the room as we watched the movie. We had to stand super close to each other for the entire 50 minute period. Imagine this as an 8th grader... The teacher then randomly picked one student to be a nazi guard. This student was allowed to do whatever they wanted during the multiple class periods we were locked in the ""car"" watching the movie. They could chew gum, sprawl out on the floor, even go through other students backpacks and take our snacks.  I will never forget this ""hands on"" learning experience.

I think there's a certain degree of indifference required of professionals. A lawyer doesn't doubt themselves and is rather dismissive of those that do... because they know they are a professional. The people that spend the most time wondering if they are or are not a professional certainly aren't. To me it's that je ne sais quoi.

August - January was full time classes, plus tutoring. February - May was full time student teaching.  I think the total program costs amounted to around $18,000. It was not expensive to live/move to Canada.  When I got back to the states, I had to take the PRAXIS and I had to submit my transcript to an expensive company (I think total was about $500) to get evaluated. While I was waiting for all this paperwork to process, I spent half a year teaching outdoor education and the other half being a nanny. It took about six months total from start to finish to get my license. I applied to both California and Colorado, but canceled my Cali application and went through with Colorado.  I got my teaching license after that! It might be a bit more expensive/different than many people's routes, but I am very glad I did it.

You can train them to move desks for partner work, small group (3-5), or even whole class discussion.  Decide on a signal and a name for each grouping (ex: 3 fingers up and call out ""X Grouping"" for a 3-person team), decide what it should look like, take a picture of it, and then show your students how you want them to move the desks (ex: life the desks and don't drag, work together).  You will have to practice multiple times to get them to do it the way you want.  When I'm starting out, I practice one grouping maybe 2x a day (I don't try to confuse them with different groupings in one day).  The next week, I teach them a different grouping, etc.    Using a timer and congratulating them, or having them race against themselves or another class, is surprisingly motivating.  Congratulate the groups who get it right the first time, or are the fastest, or who help each other.  MS students love the praise.  ""Wow, I love how Johnny, Claire, and Juan's group put their desks together so neatly for the X Grouping.  Look at this.  All their desks are exactly how I asked them to do it.""

That is my preference, as it is easy enough for kids to turn and due a little moving for group stuff.

So, row 1 and row 2 are facing each other, with the fronts of the tables touching, and rows 3/4 make the second column, with 5/6 making the third column.  I hate it when students have to turn their head to see the front, but there is not another configuration that works with 36 students (18 tables) in my classroom.  There are no available desks, so I'm stuck."

I wish she wouldn't have talked crap about teachers on the grade level. It would have been wonderful if I didn't have to worry about what she shared.   I wish she would have been more of a leader during team meetings. If you call a meeting you should push the agenda and keep everyone on topic.

Teachers,3dntrk,NeilBillAndI,20,Fri Jul 17 20:00:03 2015 UTC,"I found someone that I could trust from the beginning of the school year. Then I told that person about how introverted I am, and how bad my social anxiety is around other adults. She knew that as a student teacher/new teacher that wouldn't fly. So she pulled me into every conversation, asked me endless questions when in a group, and pushed me to go talk to others.   For the rest of the year I just ""faked it."" I spoke with others all day, volunteered when anyone needed help and plastered a smile on my face no matter what. I became known for always having a smile on my face, and that seemed to ward off any idea that I was anti-social. They all still thought I was a little quiet but that is better than being viewed as rude/snotty. Just being helpful and smiley made them think that I was some kind of social butterfly. Which was weird for me because in the past people always end up thinking I am standoffish.    I pretended that it didn't exhaust me to talk to others all day, and then I recharged my introverted batteries on the weekend/after school. It became a lot easier to handle by the end of the year. I also forced myself to eat in the staff break room with everyone else. I didn't have to talk while in there, I could just listen/eat. Then after school I closed my door, and pretended I was busy so that I could be alone for a little bit. That is at least what worked well enough for me."

Teachers,3dntrk,impossiblesoul,8,Sun Jul 19 00:20:42 2015 UTC,I find that I typically only interact with a small core group of teachers. As an introvert it is less draining to have deeper relationships with only a few others.

Lunches I eat alone and if I want to coordinate with a teacher, I catch her at a time where it can be a quick one-on-one with talking points prepared and practiced.  I have one teacher that I feel completely comfortable to talk to. Otherwise, I hide in the therapy room after they are done with it to calm down and rebuild a moment to breathe.   It's so important that you find a place to do that. Outside of your classroom so ""they"" can't find you for about 5 minutes give or take every day. It helped me so much ch when I felt overwhelmed."

It's not that I'm two faced or acting deceptive, it's really just a matter of compartmentalization: there's the part of me that needs to be introspective and in solitude and the other part that can lead a room of rowdy high school students. It's a yin-yang sort of balance that I've come to accept about myself, and as long as both needs are being met I don't feel stressed out but I can get edgy if one starts to dominate."

On the weekends, I reserve Sat for any social contact which is usually sparingly.  I come in early in the morning so I can leave right away after school when I am drained."
Teachers,3dntrk,Howls_Castle,3,Sat Jul 18 00:14:40 2015 UTC,"Best tip, learn to fake it. Most teachers don't get it. They got into teaching because they enjoy all the things that make us uncomfortable or exhausted. You may find one or two that you can confide in but as a whole you're just going to have to become an amazing actor. I'm a grade chair (team leader) now because of my seniority in my grade level, and it's a real drain on me as an introvert. I get to work as early as I can (usually it's me and the janitor for 30 minutes or more) so that I'm able to leave as early as possible. Most people like to visit after school. I ate lunch in my room ""so I can get grading done"" until I became team leader. Then I ate with the other teachers on my grade level to build camaraderie. If I was too worn out, I'd only stay with them for 5 minutes before making an excuse and retreating to my room. You're going to have what I call ""mandatory fun"" that you just have to get through. Wedding/Baby showers, committees, etc. Find what works for you to recharge after those days in particular. I spent an extra 30 minutes driving around in the car listening to the radio because my family would rather I get home feeling like a human being than frazzled. Hope this helps."
Teachers,3dntrk,81ackWidow,2,Sat Jul 18 01:49:32 2015 UTC,"I'm really introverted.  I don't do feelings well, I don't get vulnerable in groups, I never feel excited about a group larger than two.  This has never hindered me in the classroom (I think it helps?  I hear stories from my more outwardly social peers about being really derailed by the feelings brought into the room by their students?) but it can be really difficult to manage in orientation/staff training/PD, especially on my current team (which is an unbelievably good team, but really all about the vulnerability-builds-trust model).  I've found that being open with people (1 on 1 because the hell with making some personal announcement to a group) about being introverted, if you have good teammates, will result in people giving you a lot of space to do your own thing.  Be up front with what you need.  I point out to people that on breaks during PD I'm going to do my own thing, or when I'm in my classroom working with headphones on after hours it's because I need some me time and I'm not trying to be unfriendly but stay the hell out and email me if you need something, and everyone has been incredibly supportive of that.   It's just a different style of communicating.  Think of it in the same way as some team members request brevity in emails and some people want action steps highlighted in announcements - you want more alone time and your not sharing every personal thought or feeling isn't a sign of lack of trust, and if your team is compassionate, they should get your back on it."
Teachers,3dntrk,camgnostic,2,Sat Jul 18 02:22:52 2015 UTC,"Give yourself opportunities for breaks.

Teachers,3dntrk,Amdir,2,Sat Jul 18 02:48:22 2015 UTC,"In my first few years I created an intimate support system which consists of fresh teachers my age. It really helped me gained confidence and grow. We taught different subjects, were reporting to different people, had different duties, I could count on them to be there for me.  But last year, 3 of them went of maternity leave (I am happy for them, really), it really sucked for me. My support system fell apart.  On top of that my Supervisor is huge on team bonding and claimed that she was an I converted to an E on her MBTI scale. Hinting that I can be social if I want. So I was expected to mingle and hang around. If she sees me having lunches with them, she actually takes the time to text me to say that shes really glad to see me take time to do it. (which really gives me a lot of pressure, because she lets me know that she paying attention).   So last year didn't turn out well, and shit blew up in my face, by the end of the year I broke down. This year, I started fresh. I fake it like most people here. I became strategic about when I show up, and who I minimally socialise with. So there are people I have to share my weekend details with (because they are like that), people I have to share my classroom experience with because they are concerned, people I have to share some emotional tidbits now and then. Or my travel plans, or stories of my dogs. Its a lot of work surely but its easier than trying to hang around and keep up with everybody. Basically, give them what they want, minimally. Be strategic."

Teachers,3dntrk,floatsmyg,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:05:11 2015 UTC,Thanks! I'm actually fine with the kids; it's the social expectations of the staff I'm struggling with.
Teachers,3dntrk,adoaboutnothing,2,Sun Jul 19 14:45:48 2015 UTC,"That's what I mean. I never had a problem with the kids. But when you become the super excited teacher, it suddenly becomes a part of you when your around kids and adults and finally just the other staff."
Teachers,3dntrk,renegadecause,2,Sun Jul 19 14:49:36 2015 UTC,"I'm super introverted, but I get along with my department and some other teachers I've met around campus really well. I like them, they're smart and fun, and we have common interests. It's not nearly as draining to socialize with people you like and who are similar to you (not necessarily in level of introversion, but in teaching philosophy/outside interests/intelligence/whatever).  The tricky part as an introvert is finding those people, because the preliminary socializing with people you don't yet know well is the truly exhausting part. I got very lucky in that my mentor teacher has been at the school ten years, knows and gets along great with just about everyone, and has a magnetic personality that's easy to socialize with, even for me. She took me under her wing not just professionally but socially, and introduced me to all the people she knew I'd gel with. She basically did the work for me, and I am eternally grateful. Now, whenever we have large staff functions, I have my ""group"" with whom socializing isn't as taxing.  As far as day to day, though, it's true I am exhausted when I get home, but I think almost every teacher would say the same. But the nice thing is that when I'm at school, rarely am I trying to idly socialize with people. There's tons of human interaction, of course, but it usually comes with a goal/task/defined roles that make the interaction easier. If I ever am in a situation where I need to socialize, I find my group if I can. If not, I smile and fake it, then go hide in my room afterwards with the door locked and recharge for 20 minutes.  And if I really need to, I have zero problem kicking kids out of my room at lunch or before/after school. They know they can come hang out in my room most any time and many of them like to, but they also know I might say, ""Nope, not today, I have a lot of work to do so y'all can't be in here."" They'll whine jokingly, but I remain kind-but-firm and they leave, no hard feelings. Also, for morning tutorials, if I have kids waiting outside my door when I first show up, I literally don't let them in until my official tutorial time (so, if they're there at 7:50 when I get there, I will smile and say good morning and go in my room, leaving them in the hall until 8:15). My quiet morning time is precious to me.  I also adopted a habit of one of my coworkers. She has her desk positioned such that you can't see it from the door windows, and she'll lock her room from the outside and be in there working, but as far as kids/admin know, she's not in there. That way she gets some alone time to be productive and recharge.  Hope some of this rambling was helpful. TL;DR Find an extroverted buddy who will shepherd you into the social fold until you're comfortable with a group, then stick with that group when you need to be seen as social. Realize that most social interaction at school isn't idle socializing and therefore doesn't require as much energy. Try to recharge at home as much as you can, but hide in your room at school when you really need to. And don't be afraid to kick kiddos out (kindly). Other than that, smile and fake it. Good luck!"

Teachers,3dntrk,MordorFires,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:49:23 2015 UTC,"I have much the same problem. When I was on my final internship I suffered a lot from the high expectations and just being around people I didn't know all the time.   See if you can be assigned to a small office with only a couple other teachers in it. If not, buy noise cancelling headphones and use them when you're marking or doing other admin work.   Avoid the staffroom at lunch times, especially if you're having a tough day. Make a couple of good friends you can offload onto, or who can help distract you. Getting to know a couple of people really well will help, rather than trying to get to know everyone just a little bit.   Find a space where you can be alone during breaks. I stay in my classroom during lunch times sometimes, especially after a particularly tough lesson where the kids have been particularly boisterous or whatever. I open YouTube and listen to music for a while to relax.   If you can afford it, I also recommend living alone and having a cat or a dog. This way you're not lonely when you're home, but you're not socialising either.   Get plenty of exercise. If I don't go to the gym for a couple weeks I find I get socially overwhelmed much easier.   Finally, fake it till you make it. I'm sure you managed ok when you were a student attending school every day, so you cope with this too."
Teachers,3dntrk,JRoch,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:54:48 2015 UTC,"I agree with pretty much all posts. You have to fake it to a certain extent, as total isolation is likely to cause more issues than it'll solve through friction with staff. Especially if you work at a school where teachers gossip to students about other teachers. I'm not sure how many other schools are like this, but there were a couple like that at my school.  Find one or two others you can connect with, try and touch base with your dept lead relatively often, be on a committee. Those three are big. Eating lunch in the lounge can help but it could cause a lot of stress compared to some of the other things you can do. And as long as you're doing some of those things, don't be afraid to turn others away if you really need a few moments alone. Do some grading or lesson planning.  Having a good relationship with students can actually help a lot with this too. They'll generally come to understand and get along with your personality. And they'll call you on it if you go too far."

Teachers,3dntua,Darth_Sensitive,-2,Sat Jul 18 00:16:34 2015 UTC,"I also expected titles and dates on all our notes, so some questions were simply ""what was the title on January 22?""   This is one of those things that I think is a dick move.  It doesn't matter, in the course of the subject material knowledge, what the teacher decided to title something on a particular day.  It isn't useful and can only serve to discourage critical thinking or academic responsibility in the note-taking part of the educational process without any gains.  I think it's fine if you want to just title it x and then students can take the onus upon them as to how to structure their notes - in all likelihood, they do one of three things:   Copy you (either by choice, convenience, or blindly) Not copy at all (pretty much either no effect or only a positive effect on these students - I cannot imagine a scenario where this is a negative). Critically understand a topic, digesting it to the point to generate their own title (if they so care)."

If we're learning about light energy, then I expect their notes to be titled ""Light Energy"" - not because I'm a nazi who demands it to be that way, but because I'm teaching elementary students how to organize their notes not only so they know what to study for the upcoming test, but also so they are slightly more prepared for junior high, high school, and beyond when lessons are less structured."

Punishing them doesn't seem right, I had a terribly disorganized binder in middle school, but I was sill able to find my materials quickly. Disorganization works for some people, and doesn't for others. Give the kids a chance to find which system works best for them."
Teachers,3dntua,dean84921,9,Fri Jul 17 20:54:25 2015 UTC,"I upvoted the idea of positive rewards, with frequent checks.    The issue is that this is a skill that may need to be taught.  Some students may have no frame of reference or know what to do.  The AVID program for Title I schools stresses organization.  They may have some good information for you to use.    Good luck with this; what you're trying to do is very important.  It's a life skill that can have life-long benefits, so any progress you make is worthwhile!"

Teachers,3dntua,Aremihc,5,Fri Jul 17 22:36:44 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if this is something you're looking for, but I thought I would say it.   My history teacher in high school required binders. She was incredibly clear about her expectations, and we had no grades for them. Her system is what sold it. Each piece of paper she gave us had a number and a letter: 1A, 1B, 1C. Handouts had letters assigned to them, as well as in class assignments. If we wrote things on our own paper (lined, etc) we would write the number/letter she told us to.   This also helped if you were out. You knew exactly what page was missing. Also would let her assign pages to study for tests (Numbers 44-78 for test #3)   Have everything 3 hole punched, or require them to have their own. Stick to the plan with letters/numbers."

I also work in early elementary so I spend more time with glue sticks than binders.   Good luck!!!"
Teachers,3dntua,AwesomeLandia,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:34:50 2015 UTC,"I use a similar system, and it works so well with kids.  We also keep a list of assignments for each unit, and we update it together.  When students finish early, one of their optional tasks is to organize their binder.  They can borrow mine and/or another student's to compare.    I give them lots of time to organize in class, and I use mine as an example.  We do a lot of planned study activities using our binders.  My students write out their grades for each assignment on the assignments page, and they can better keep track of their grades.    Parents love this!  They get to look at their student's work (or lack of) when they come to visit.  During SSTs, I have the student show his/her binder and explain how it is organized. The student can explain what assignments he/she is missing, and what assignments received high or low marks.    The best part is now I am way more organized!  I have previous years' binders to show students as examples, and now I have copies of all my past assignments to modify, keep, or trash as needed."
Teachers,3dntua,Ryde22,3,Sat Jul 18 16:09:35 2015 UTC,"I, too, teach 9th grade English, and I feel your pain! I often see a correlation between organization and success (although not always). I do want to say that I really don't like forcing all students to use a single organizational style; I always would get so annoyed when teachers required that I use a binder organized a specific way because I've always been more of a folder girl. Plus, giving students choice helps with engagement! And, at the 9th-grade level, students should be starting to understand which organizational system(s) work best for them. Some ideas: - Discuss different organizational strategies as a class at the beginning of the year. As you conduct organization checks, have students provide you with a reflection of what strategies they've used in the past week/month/quarter to stay organized. Hooray for getting all meta! - I like gathering feedback from my 9th graders in May to share with the incoming freshmen next year. Ask them what advice they can give, specifically in terms of organization. I find that many of my 9th graders come in thinking they can get by with just stuffing everything into the bottom of their backpacks like they did in middle school. Having actual students point out the value in organization will help your cause!  - Kind of tying into that last point, I've found that my students FREAK OUT about the short passing periods. When that bell rings, they're stuffing any papers or notes wherever they can and leaving. I haven't tried this (although I might), but it might be valuable to put our money where our mouths are and give students a couple minutes every now and then (particularly at the end of class and/or when we distribute a lot of papers or they take a lot of notes) to organize.  - Does Texas have any sort of SEL (social/emotional learning) standards? Our state's SEL standards cover organizational strategies. If not, I wonder if you could use some sort of writing process strand; it's kind of a stretch, but might work? Otherwise, I like the idea of creating a column in the grade book for an ""assignment"" worth zero points to assess organization.   Hope that helps! Do share your results!"
Teachers,3dntua,gimmefantastic,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:42:13 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your detailed feedback.  I like your suggestion for giving them options for organization that might work best for them.  I may try that!  Also, no, Texas doesn't have any SEL standards that I'm aware of.  It'd certainly be nice!"
Teachers,3dntua,JamesonRH,2,Sat Jul 18 14:07:15 2015 UTC,"I am at a school that has mastery based grading as well, so I hold students accountable for organization in other ways (checking their stuff, making them organize and giving detentions if they don't keep organized).  A lot of work, but it works."
Teachers,3dntua,phiwings,2,Fri Jul 17 20:32:44 2015 UTC,"My solution: only grade research papers and projects that are turned in as an organized portfolio of work, including documentation of research, notes, etc. Require students to include a cover sheet that self-assesses their achievement of each standard included in their work."
Teachers,3dntua,TeacherladyKim2007,2,Fri Jul 17 23:01:34 2015 UTC,"What about checkpoints?  As they write, they need to show you certain things (notes, prewriting, rough drafts, whatever you're looking for).  Would something like that work?"

Teachers,3dntua,MiightyMouse,2,Sun Jul 19 02:48:19 2015 UTC,"We all can agree that better organized students are better prepared, but why do you feel like personal organization beyond that related to learning standards is something that you need to include your curriculum?  Just playing devil's advocate: A number of problems we teachers have today have come about by us voluntarily taking on what I would term ""parental responsibilities"", and I feel like to a degree personal organization is one of them. Many schools today provide personal organizers. I think this is great. I require all my students (SLD, CD, ED) to fill their's out, I check it, and all my parents know that this happens daily. I created a opportunity for parents to be responsible for their student's education, while also avoiding the student ""hand holding"" many parents and students experienced in EL-ED and middle school or teaching/grading for organization.  Aside: I was diagnosed ADD in the early 90's and used personal organizer throughout my public school career. This was started, checked, and enforced by my mother who was/is also a SP-ED teacher. I hope this helps frame opinion."

It shouldn't be my responsibility, but I want to help them somehow."

Teachers,3dntua,driveonacid,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:55:47 2015 UTC,"In my limited experience, there are plenty of students that would go along with non-graded lessons.  For example, I don't believe I'd need such a grade in a Pre-AP or AP class.  However, I teach a lot of at-risk and inclusion students (specifically quite a few with emotional disturbances).  In my experience, these are the students that will least likely comply without accountability and who need organization skills the most."
Teachers,3dntua,lemondrop86,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:55:57 2015 UTC,"If I didn't have a CCR (College and Career Readiness) grade attached to every single assignment, then far too many of my 6th grade students would turn in their work late, not put their name on their paper, or make no effort to use correct grammar or spelling.  It is one point attached to each assignment usually, with CCR making up a very small percentage of their final grade.  However, it helps a ton.  Otherwise, the lack of caring on their part helps put them in a downward spiral with the rest of their learning.  I look forward to the day that about 1/5 of my students don't require a grade attached to these things to do them (and for the ones who still can't do these simple tasks to somehow grasp the importance of their own name on their paper)."
Teachers,3dntua,driveonacid,2,Sun Jul 19 02:45:30 2015 UTC,"All of these ideas that I've seen are great. Also, make it a game. Hold a bonus point up in the air and say, ""This goes to the first person who can give me (insert assignment name here)."" Make it an assignment from a few days before, one that you know you have given back, one that you told them to put in their binder.   Do that occasionally and they'll get the idea that they need to be super organized."

With 9th graders the junk box might not be as exciting, but you can order books off there with points too, any they want. Give them tickets for organization once a week and do a drawing once a month or something and let the winners pick a book.   I've only done orders one full year and after the first month the points were high enough to start using them. (Also pro tip I give them one bonus point on a quiz for getting their book order signed by their parents to make sure their parents saw it... gets a lot more orders that way, no one is ""punished"" for no order, and it's only one bonus point.

For example, ""If everyone in class has a complete binder check, the whole class gets a homework-free weekend"" (or whatever).  You could start small with a percentage of the class or a percentage of the binder being organized/complete and then increase it each week/month (along with a corresponding reward/prize). I like ""prizes"" that don't require anything from me (such as the homework-free weekend, especially when I already planned no homework for that part of the unit, haha), but you could go bigger with snacks or other non-food treats. Usually, the older grades are more motivated by non-tangible items, like the ability to have their phones/earbuds out and on, getting free time, or being relieved of homework."

For example, I have an Academic category, and then a Preparation category.    I see that there are different categories on the back end, but from the parent/student side of the interface, they just see the ""grades"".    So, using that, I can give Binder Check grades, and assign the grade into the Preparation category, and never affect their academic grades...but the kids and parents never see that.

I've been punched, I've had fingers broken because the kids twist away trying to get at each other some more.  I look at it this way: If I don't break them up, one of them is going to get seriously hurt and then I'll be up shit's creek.  Then I'll get questions asking why I didn't break them up.  When I got a finger broken breaking up a fight my administrators first said that I shouldn't be breaking up fights because that's why I got hurt, then they told me good job breaking up the fight because the kids would have hurt each other.

I've also always been in a tested subject (8th grade U.S. History in Texas). Though I have gotten better at making it work, for 15-16 I will not be doing them. I hope to add more reading and a component of PBL instead of interactive notebooks. Not sure how it'll go this school year but I know the notebooks can be both time consuming and amazingly rewarding."

Teachers,3dmitc,Chevey0,4,Fri Jul 17 14:02:05 2015 UTC,Have you ever heard of Class Craft? I'm hoping to use it this year. It is a management system that incorporates gamification: http://www.classcraft.com/

Teachers,3dmitc,CallawayOmega,3,Fri Jul 17 16:33:12 2015 UTC,I played class craft last year with 9th and 11th graders. They HATED it. I spent countless hours setting it up and they hated the game so much. I even tried changing some rules to what they like. Doesn't matter. They couldn't stand the game.
Teachers,3dmitc,TheDudeAbides31,2,Fri Jul 17 18:03:27 2015 UTC,What exactly did they hate about ClassCraft? I'm considering using it and would love to hear from someone with experience. Did they not buy in to the rules? Did they simply not like the consequences? Not think it was fair? Not like the rewards?
Teachers,3dmitc,CallawayOmega,2,Fri Jul 17 21:34:26 2015 UTC,The consequences were wat to harsh and the random event is almost always either irrelevant or negative. Took me hours to tweak the rules to a more positive spin and they still hated it.
Teachers,3dmitc,TheDudeAbides31,2,Fri Jul 17 21:55:09 2015 UTC,"Yea, when I was messing around I noticed that the consequences weren't really in step with my district policy so I tweaked them. I also didn't like the randomness of the rules. For instance, if a player ""fell in battle"" and was not helped by their teammates, they could get an after school detention. I have always followed a progressive consequence system in which the consequences get progressively harsher."

Teachers,3dmitc,TheDudeAbides31,4,Sat Jul 18 00:15:13 2015 UTC,"ClassCraft misses the point of gamification in my opinion. It's primarily marketed as a classroom management system and it is and does it well.  Really, all it's doing is providing an incentive to either behave or complete an assignment. If that's all you want, then it's a great product.  I was inspired years ago from that Extra Credit video to look into gamification. Really, the purpose should be to take qualities that make a game authentically engaging (such as a risk-free environment that allows people to try as many times as they want) and apply them to education. True gamification should impact the way we design lessons, not the way we manage our classes."
Teachers,3dmitc,dsinkular,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:22:53 2015 UTC,"That seems to be the problem with gamification as a whole. Despite all the buzz surrounding it, it seems that many people can't even come up with a basic definition (sort of like the whole PBL movement). It sounds like you would be really interested in standard based learning. This allows students to keep trying until they master the standard."
Teachers,3dmitc,DigitalCitizen0912,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:38:40 2015 UTC,"Gamification is what you make of it.  You are right in that Classcraft could be used as a management system and do it well, but we used the game for competitions, and getting the extra powers that students wanted.  I really didn't punish the students all that much within the game as that is not what I wanted it to be.  I even set up side projects that would give them the opportunity to move up if they completed them.  Much like anything, it is what you make of it."
Teachers,3dmitc,ericineducation,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:16:19 2015 UTC,"The Extra Credits video on it is so fantastic! The concept of Gamification inspired my thesis, looking at digital citizenship in MMORPGs. I applied knowledge that I discovered in analyzing people's interactions to how I see education could apply concepts of digital citizenship. I think it is really about the motivation that people have to play games in their free time that can be helpful when trying to make a classroom an open and inviting place."
Teachers,3dmitc,nwgnr,3,Sat Jul 18 01:38:13 2015 UTC,games have a lot of the answers we're looking for when it comes to soft skills and motivation. when we're designing experiences for students we just have to beware that we're not giving them chocolate covered broccoli.

Teachers,3dmitc,TheDudeAbides31,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:35:34 2015 UTC,"It was definitely more than 5 minutes.  It really depends on how serious you want to take it.  I would say that a chunk of it could be done in 5 minutes at the start of class, maybe a little more.  But I would actual input the xp that students get after class just as to not eat up class time.  Unless they are working and you are floating around, then it is a piece of cake, especially if you have a tablet or something smaller that you can take with you.  It was very customizable."

Teachers,3dmku2,Duke_Sucks,4,Fri Jul 17 14:19:23 2015 UTC,"There's this online government game/simulation that I used at www.nationstates.net  Essentially users create their own country with custom name, currency, national animal, flag design etc. Then users answer several questions and depending how they answer, their nationstate will land in a corresponding spot on the political spectrum . Each day the population of your country increases and you get sent a maximum of 3 telegrams per day presenting you with different social, economic, and political issues. How you choose to respond as the nations leader will determine different outcomes for your country.   I used it as a way to end every class. I just made one class country and we would discuss the issues as a class and have debate on which options to choose. Obviously I also encouraged them to make their own accounts and many of them did."

Teachers,3dmku2,renegadecause,3,Fri Jul 17 16:13:24 2015 UTC,"First of all- UNC or NC State?  Second, I'm going to plug something that my school uses as a textbook- it was developed by a person who taught Civics (our Gov class) there for about 20+ years or so.  When I asked the current civics teacher what was special about them, he said that Kitchens did a good job of putting in relevant case law and summarizing and quoting judiciously from decisions, which few other textbooks do well.  They are currently using older editions until they wear out and do not know what they'll do to replace them.  However, this was used in a California school, so your mileage may vary, but it appears his page lists the court cases he covers, and you could easily email him and get more details.  Government is all about opening people's minds to think critically about how we as a country have shifted our positions and the way we rule.  I would say that teaching by court cases is a good idea- and that very recent ones can give you very good material to work with which should still be in people's minds.  Don't forget that SCOTUS has pdf's of their decisions on their website for free.    Besides talking about the structure of government federally, it would be wise to do so at the state, county, and municipal level as well.  Discussions on gerrymandering, redistricting, and disputes between the different levels of government over jurisdiction would be very good things to cover."

Teachers,3dmku2,bcal16,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:04:51 2015 UTC,"I've taught Gov't four semesters now, and last semester did a bit of a trial run for two different aspects of the class that I found to be great successes.   First, students had to submit Gov't /politics related current event assignments once per unit (for a total of seven). The assignment required them to read an article from a recognized news source (I provided them with links to about 15 different websites), provide a summary, point out potential biases, and give a personal opinion on the topic at hand. They submitted the responses through email. I plan to expand this assignment in the future, having each student at some point during the semester's  present their article and have a class discussion on the content.  The second thing I did was a presidential campaign simulation. Classes were divided into teams of five (ish) and had to select a fictional character to run for president. They wrote and delivered speeches, ""published"" their stances on major issues, completed financial disclosure documents, participated in a debate, created printed advertisements (both positive and negative against another candidate) and created a television ad.  It was an absolute blast and the kids loved it, but it tool a lot of prep work.   I can go into more detail about these assignments later if you'd like. I'm on mobile now so sorry if this reads like it's stream of consciousness."

Also another good idea (if it's not an election year), is to do mock trials (depending on the class size) debating a court case that takes on a current event or issue.  It can lead to discussions and also if you give the time for judges to consult/discuss together.  Also, make the kids dress up for it.  It will get them in the mood and set the tone."

The FAST sight word list is used again at the beginning of first grade to refresh the children's memories. They learn 100 new words, on top of the 50 refresher words from kindergarten, in first grade."

Midway through my student teaching, we dumped the old sight word list and switched to a new one. The curriculum and textbook only had ~40 sight words, which my mentor teacher thought was insufficient. Midway through the year, she dumped the list and switched to a new list of 100 words. Not the straight Dolch or Fry list, but a mix of Dolch words and words from the curriculum. 100 words breaks down to roughly 3ish words per week, which was hard for us for the last half of the year. Next year she's planning to start with the list of 100 right from the getgo and get as many of them done as she can."
Teachers,3dn16b,Collin_1000,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:43:42 2015 UTC,"Well I'm going into my second year teaching so I'm by far no expert. I'm in a title 1 school full day as well, 1/3 of my  Kindergarten class last year were ELLs. Most of my students couldn't even write their name at the beginning of the year and had never been in a classroom before so I couldn't make sight words as much as a priority as I'd like since I spent so much time just on behavior and management. I wanted my kids to know at least 30 (our curriculum only taught around 35 for the year) but my class probably averaged 20-25.  I think 2 a week is doable at a certain point (like by November or December) but it might be harder to do that at the beginning of the year. I also liked to have review weeks where I wouldn't teach anything new and would just reinforce (they were sort of worked into our curriculum anyway).  The way I taught sight words was kind of my own ideas + our guided curriculum (CA Treasures).  Monday: Introduce the 1-2 new sight words for the week. I would write them on the board and have students practice writing them in the air and writing them on their hand. We'd spell them as a group, then we'd practice verbally using them in a sentence (I'd give a few examples, then get volunteers, then have everyone share with a partner). During writing time I would provide a sentence frame for them to use for each sight word.  Tuesday: I'd go over the sight words again during rug time and have us construct a sentence on the board using the sight words and some of our cvc words, during writing they'd practice with the same sentence frames from Monday or they'd go back and edit what they wrote on Monday.  Wednesday: I'd use our sight word cards/ sentence strips to build sentences in a pocket chart on the board with student helpers during rug time. In writing, the students would pick one of the sight words and try to write a sentence with it.  Thursday: As a class, we would chorally read our decodable sight word reader for that week (usually the curriculum would have one for whichever word I was teaching). After we read it chorally, students would practice reading it with a partner. During writing, students would have their readers at their desk and could either copy a sentence from their reader or write their own using the sight words.  Friday: Review sight words at rug, spell, trace, etc. Build a few sentences, sometimes we would make a story as a class with some of the sight words we'd learned so far with my prompts. Friday journal writing was always free write but I would encourage students to work their weekly sight words into whatever they wrote.  During the week in centers I would also work with small groups to read through their sight word readers and also practice writing the sight words/sentence frames."
Teachers,3dmman,hey_you0,8,Fri Jul 17 14:31:20 2015 UTC,"Definitely watch your tone, the way you speak to k's is different than gr 6's. I usually talk to my 6's like mini adults, but they are still like kids needing frequent reminders and step by step instructions. Definitely don't become their friend though, you need to be strict especially in the beginning.  As for subject specific stuff can't really help you too much as I teach k-8 in a one room schoolhouse so the way I run my classroom will be vastly different than yours"
Teachers,3dmman,Maudesquad,6,Fri Jul 17 15:27:26 2015 UTC,"You are well-prepared, oddly. Kindergartners and 6th graders both require a lot of structure (K and middle school are similar in this manner). Do not assume that because they are older that they will be able to rapidly meet expectations. Rather, consider that they are transitioning from childhood to adulthood.   Even though they may have been a very well behaved 5th grade class, as they begin to define their own identities they will begin to push against the rules. This is a normal behavior. Having a firm structure in place will allow you to engage in fun activities when they are children, reinforce or correct them as needed when they are pushing into adulthood, and overall meet their needs as they begin their transition out of childhood."

Teachers,3dmman,passionatereds,4,Sat Jul 18 01:39:26 2015 UTC,"Will the school be K-6, 6-8, or K-8?  The reason I ask is because many 6th graders are terrified to go to middle school when it's 6-8 mainly because they are the babies of the building. In my experience, many of the kids didn't have regular lockers and they are scared about little things like that - like, will they be able to open it? Will they remember their combo?   I have found that 6th graders are sort of oblivious to a lot of things and tend to be in elementary school mode until about Christmas Break time when they get more comfortable. Some start to get crushes on others, but a lot of them are still too young. Towards the end of the year, this will change. Think back to being in middle school. Everyone was so awkward, scared, and insecure, but no one knew that everyone else felt the same way! They will worry about making friends and if others like them.   When teaching 6th grade, you have to start to wean them off of needing the teacher so much and incorporate some lessons on responsibility- for their work, actions, and words to others. They will definitely need clear and consistent boundaries. Take a few days, yes days, to go over your rules and procedures. It may seem like a lot of time, but those days will save you many more down the line. I have found that kids at that age generally will listen to teachers regarding discipline and rules, though you will definitely have some pickles along the way. Competition is good! You might look into using Classdojo as a rewards system. They will do anything to earn points, and you can have them cash in their points on things like homework passes, eating lunch with you, and maybe some small school supplies or prizes.   Lastly, remember that these kids have tons of energy (ours didn't have recess anymore, yikes!) Try to plan things in 10-20 minute chunks to keep their attention."

Teachers,3dmman,Clawless,3,Sat Jul 18 01:37:15 2015 UTC,"I agree with the other post's advice about one, if the kids sense that you're too nice (a problem I deal with) they may not take you 100% seriously when you want to be taken seriously.  Also keep track of how much you do for them. 6th grade, as I teach it, is one of the first years that their teacher is starting to prepare them for high school. While many content skills will be learned on 7th and 8th grade... by the end of 6th they need to know how to get through school without the teacher holding their hand."
Teachers,3dmman,passionatereds,2,Fri Jul 17 15:45:37 2015 UTC,"In middle school, the 6th graders are the last chance you have at all the fun kittle elementary things (games, prizes, stickers, that stuff). But they are also getting exposed to adolescence, so talking to them with an adult tone goes a long way.    As with all teaching: consistency! Figure out what you expect from them, and have that in place from day 1."
Teachers,3dmman,Clawless,3,Fri Jul 17 16:28:44 2015 UTC,"I respectfully disagree on prizes/games/stickers, and perhaps this is just a situational thing, but I teach 8th grade and they will do anything for prizes and stickers. Either way, it will definitely work for 6th grade, that's true."

Also, think about maybe making a reading area a simple replica of Forbidden city kinda (I'm thinking like hanging a sheet or paper from the ceiling to make the roof look like Chinese architecture above the reading nook) if possible and maybe have a Great Wall of Words or something where you can put English sight words with the Chinese character underneath or something (Maybe even allow them to look up the Chinese character and create the sight word cards). It's the year of the sheep (2015) so maybe you could include something about that and maybe you can do an activity for the students about the zodiac for the year they were born.

First two I think of off the top of my head are tapping the table with your index and middle knuckles means ""thank you"" (generally used after someone pours your tea for you but you could use it whenever) and children never take or give anything to an adult with one hand, you have to use both hands as a sign of respect. Also when you get a compliment, you don't say ""thank you"", you say ""no, that's not true"" (very rough translation) so you don't look conceited.  I'm sure you could find more on a travel website. You could do one lesson about different cultures having different ""unspoken rules"" and then just encourage the students to use them as classroom norms for the rest of the summer. Depending on your kids they might have a lot of fun with it, and it could be a great introduction into understanding cultural relativism!"

If you're the type of teacher who likes to project a chart on the board and fill it in real time with students (sequence of events, compare and contrast) this is a great app. 3) Gmail offline Not exactly education related, but the ability to check your email without an internet connection is something typical PCs and Macs can do with Outlook or Mail.app - this is how you do it with a Chromebook. 4) Mindmeister I've never tried this app but I know a few people who have used it in the classroom and loved it.

Meeting with him small group and modeling will probably help too. I would also try to get parents involved as much as possible. Give them some ideas of questions to ask during reading at home.

I use post-it notes and ""pre-sticky"" the books my reading groups are going to read with comprehension questions. You can also color code the post-its to have kids work on other comprehension skills (ex- blue sticky = make a predication, pink sticky = check for understanding, etc.). I highly recommend teaching the student how to ""stop, think, paraphrase"" and then showing them how to ""go back and reread"" when they can't accurately paraphrase. Self-monitoring is key and I model the heck out of this skill and guide them through the process.  One other suggestion, chose a book that is high interest to the student, on the easy side of their instructional reading level, and has a simple plot so they can master basic comprehension skills. Once they get the hang of that, start adding in more complex plots and other genres. Basically, teach them how to self-monitor with an easier book, then work your way up. It builds their confidence too and gives you an easy way to give specific praise (Oooo... I really like how you asked a question about this character. Good readers are always asking questions about the text they're reading). You know the drill....   I recommend taking notes and dating them to have additional documentation of your student's progress along with all the usual tests. I notice a lot of patterns in my students' reading that way and it helps me be more effective (and it's good for SST meetings if necessary).   If you're middle/high school this is probably not as helpful although a reader not comprehending is a reader not comprehending. Let me know if you have any questions and best of luck!"

How is war different for the active soldiers vs. veterans years later vs. prisoners of war vs. people safe on the home front vs. refugees displaced by war vs. government officials vs. etc. etc. etc.  One thing you might also consider doing, depending on where you are teaching, is comparing life in, say, wartorn Afghanistand to American cities with high rates of violence. I remember listening to an NPR episode that discussed the similarities of kids in inner city Chicago schools experiencing the same symptoms of PTSD as soldiers in Iraq. I think it was this episode: http://www.npr.org/2013/02/21/172593743/chicago-kids-say-theyre-assigned-to-gangs  A great activity could be finding someone who was significantly impacted by war and interviewing him/her. Could be a veteran or an army wife or someone whose brother died in battle or someone who protested against Vietnam, etc.  To break up the monotony you might also incorporate some fiction into this. How do books and TV shows and comics and movies and video games represent war? Is that representation accurate? What is the inspiration for that representation? This would require the kids to do a lot of research on something that interests them (I would have loved an assignment on this with Lord of the Rings, Game of Thrones, or Fallout).  You could do a weekly weapon spotlight, which would require one kid every Thursday (or whatever) to present on a specific weapon. Take the sword. When was it invented, how widespread was its use, how has it developed over time, how is it viewed today, what impact has it had on the world, etc. You could do this for spears, the bow and arrow, crossbow, catapult, mounted combat, the musket, the rifle, the pistol, automatic weapons, napalm, the atomic bomb, etc.  On the topic of the atomic bomb, this website will amaze your students: http://nuclearsecrecy.com/nukemap/ When I showed it to my students, I dropped atom bombs of different sizes on our school.  I want to teach war literature now. :|"
Teachers,3dn795,verdandi,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:20:20 2015 UTC,"Since most war stories have a military component, I would think you could do team-building or problem-solving activities to liven it up between reading/writing.   For example, one I used with freshmen had each person in a small group with a specific task/role. In a closet in the room, I had built a Lego structure with probably about 10-20 pieces. Each group had the exact same pieces (plus some extras). The catch was only one person in each group could see the Lego structure in the secret closet, but this person couldn't talk. Another person in the group could talk, but couldn't access the secret structure. One person was allowed to touch the Legos. There was also something in there about who could see what was being made in the group; it sticks in my mind only certain people could see the group's structure. Anyway, it was a low-key team-building and problem-solving activity. (And very quiet with only certain group members allowed to speak!) You could relate having the specific roles to being in the military. There's a lot of frustration involved if the people with communicative roles aren't doing their best, so maybe that aspect could come into play as well.   Another element of war is obviously survival. It is tangentially related, but there is a ""what do you keep?"" type of activity floating around out there (most commonly used with Lord of the Flies). It comes from the standpoint of being stranded on an island and only being able to have/save certain supplies. Each group has to decide on the supplies and then provide a rationale for their decisions. There's no one right/wrong answer, but it's great for discussion and can lead into a less-stressful writing assignment (since it's opinion-based and most kids get fired up about it).   Since it's an ELA class, you don't want to forget grammar, punctuation, capitalization, etc.  A teacher in my building plays a ""Grammar Bowl"" game styled after college football. The kids practice some concept each week and then go head-to-head on a certain day for running points. The winning team gets extra treats at the end of the semester (though I'm pretty sure he gave all of the teams a small treat on the day of the final).  You could create similar contests but in a military style. You could be a drill sergeant and have squadrons (or, uhm, another military term that means groups?) compete against one another once a week with a running tally of their points, wins/losses, etc. Grammar Battles in a great Grammar War, perhaps. Bonus points for letting them design battle flags, choose uniform colors/mascots/etc.   Just a final thought, since I had a similar kind of class where we looked at war all semester.  It can be overwhelming to only focus on the cruelty, casualties, and destruction of it all (and by that, I mean, my class turned into a serious nightmare-inducing downer where all of us eventually admitted to the professor we were not handling/processing the info very well -- it was a 6-week course on the Holocaust and surrounding war, so obviously quite intense and different from the course you're describing here, but worth noting nonetheless).  If you can find a way to look for, like, moments in war that make us human and emphasize these, I think it would go a long way toward providing balance in the class. Especially with so many boys, there can be this tendency to runaway with all the macho (no offense!) stuff about the guns and the bloody deaths and what kind of tanks and airplanes were there, even when the author is not intending to highlight that information!  If your syllabus is even a little bit flexible, I would add in short stories (or even poetry) that highlight ""personal battles"" to make connections to the war literature and emphasize these kind of human aspects. It would also give you an opportunity to include work from/about more females and minorities."
Teachers,3dl9qv,circledot,3,Fri Jul 17 04:38:22 2015 UTC,My mom- she taught various high school subjects. It was always fun to see her teach. I know we are closer ever since I've started teaching.

She was in school for a really long time (graduated HS when she was 16), so she was qualified to teach a ton of subjects. Really made it easier when I got to the tough parts in math- she's so good at math. I'm hoping when I get back home to get qualified for bio/science as well."

Teachers,3dl9qv,panfriedmayo,2,Fri Jul 17 12:59:04 2015 UTC,"My story is somewhat different -- I decided to teach because I had an absolutely terrible teacher one year in middle school. I was so frustrated by their class because it was full of arbitrary rules and intensive yet pointless projects. I distinctly remember being frustrated by the given lesson on the electoral college that I sat there and brainstormed other, better lesson plans... and I decided that yes, I could do a better job than that teacher and I was going to prove it. The next year I had an amazing teacher in that same subject who blew my mind every day, and the juxtaposition was enough to make me commit to it.   In retrospect, I was a terrible student to that first teacher, who was just a few years away from retirement and was probably deserving of more compassion than I gave them. And the other teacher, who so blew my mind and showed me the impact a great teacher could have, didn't even remember me when I ran into them several years later and tried to explain what an impact they'd had. I try to remember that students' perceptions of their teachers are often way off, and that every student with an attitude is my karmic payback for being such a brat when I was growing up."

I've just never loved it,  it's something I fell in to when I was younger and inertia  kept me moving forward.  Well three years ago I got married to a wonderful woman, 1 year ago I had my daughter, and 6 months ago my company started going through layoffs so I had to find a new job.  It was right at that time, an old HS facebook friend posted the retirement video of Mr. Nettles.  Mr. Nettles was my HS world geography teacher and amazing.  He loved his job, was always smiling and happy, maintained a disciplined classroom where I learned and even asked me to represent the school at a state competition. He was a good teacher.  I wanted to be a good teacher.  Well I am now taking online courses to get my teaching degree. My boss asked me back to my old job and has even been supportive about me doing classwork in my downtime, so hopefully within 2 years I'll be able to start a job I love.  And who knows,  maybe after 25 years of doing something I love  a former student of mine will post my retirement video to Facebook 5.0."

Teachers,3dl9qv,agentfantabulous,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:51:43 2015 UTC,"I think I always wanted to be a teacher on some level. But my fourth-grade teacher was really special.   He was a black man who had just graduated, and this was his first teaching post. We hated him. We thought he was way too strict. He wouldn't let us sharpen our pencils unless they were super dull or broken, so we thought he was just the worst. If we asked for help, he'd make us try on our own instead of just giving us the answer. How horrendous.   Fourth grade was a terrible year for me. Had a pretty rough situation at home with an addict step father, and I was the victim of some pretty vicious girl-bullying from my ""best friend"" who was also in the class. Come to think of it, I'm pretty sure she was the one who ""decided"" that we hated the teacher.   Looking back, I see that Mr. Walter was the only teacher who ever kept me after class to ask if I was OK (of course I told him I was FINE just FINE, but inside, I realized he really cared and that he noticed that I was definitely not fine). In his class, I did math on the board in front of everyone and GOT THE ANSWER RIGHT when no one else did. (I had no confidence in math at all.) He recommended me for assessment to be classified as ""gifted"", (fifth grade was so much better for me because of that!) and really pushed my parents on it (I found out later that my kindergarten teacher had also recommended it, but my dad refused. My elementary school life could have been so different and so much better).  He moved out of state the following year. I sincerely hope that we weren't horrible to him, and that he continued teaching.   Mr. Walter, if you're out there somewhere, thank you."

I never was a big fan of science, but he made the subject come alive and made it very engaging.  On top of that, we could always tell that he actually cared about his students. He was always making sure we were getting the helped we needed and would check with us often. He cared about us academically and as people. He also liked to joke around, be a little goofy, and pick on us. Because of all of this, I feel like I have been modeling myself as that kind of teacher."

He wasn't the most wild and crazy teacher ever, he didn't try too hard to get us to like him or play favorites, he just did his job in a patient and helpful way. I really respected him for that!"

My grandma was a biology teacher and from an early age taught my siblings and I to love and appreciate nature. She would take us on walks around our neighborhood and point out all the plants around us. She had held onto most of her old books and some classroom supplies which we were allowed to play with in her home library.  My dad currently teaches health and biology at a continuation high school. The passion and dedication he shows in his everyday teaching is amazing. He teaches his students not only the standards they are required to learn but also things like urban gardening, beekeeping, and plant based eating. He brings in a juicer and has his students try and make different juices.  Since he lives in a semi-small town its always exciting to see him run into a former student. Their faces light up immediately and they begin to catch up on life since graduation.  I started my own teaching career three years ago. Even though I have yet to teach the main subject I was made for (health) I feel like having my dad and grandma as role models has really showed me what type of teacher I would like to ultimately become."

One of my last conversations with my mom, I told her about what I was doing with my students. She told me, ""get your teAching certificate, you enjoy teaching!""

To my understanding, the pay schedule doesn't really have wiggle-room legally/contractually to allow jumps like that. Again to my knowledge as told to me by my HR department  As a first year public HS teacher, I am starting at an accelerated(higher than 0,1) pay level (I negotiated up a few steps) because i was able to leverage my experience as a TA + other teaching experiences. Also-- I teach a high needs subject area. Everyone here at r/teachers told me it was rude to ask & impossible to begin at a different step, but I was advised to do this in my credential program and it was successful for me and a few of my classmates.

The board tried to keep it quiet, but we get salary information every year, so it didn't take long for someone to notice. The teachers associations bargaining team considered this a bad faith move and it really caused problems when it came time to renegotiate the contract. That and even though it wasn't really his fault, it caused a lot of hard feelings and he was sort of ostracized by a lot of the other teachers."
Teachers,3dkidu,monkeydave,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:56:11 2015 UTC,"Steps are designed to represent your experience. If you had experience at other jobs that translates into teaching experience, some credit should be given for that experience. But you can't jump steps after starting. Where you are placed when you start is based on experience, and sometimes other factors besides years teaching gives you experience."
Teachers,3dkidu,Mirabellae,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:54:45 2015 UTC,"True. It depends on exactly what your contract says and what your board decides initially. I just looked mine up because I wasn't sure of the exact wording. It says ""no teacher may be granted degree credit or experience beyond that actually earned."" So the ""experience"" part might be up for interpretation if you have a good case.   I misinterpreted the part where OP is wanting to move up two steps instead of one in his current job. In our contract, that is expressly forbidden. Once you are on the scale, you can only move one up and one over per year."
Teachers,3dkidu,SignorJC,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:47:59 2015 UTC,Why would you bargain for steps when you can just take the better job? Everything about the new job sounds better than your current position.   It is probably POSSIBLE to jump a step but very unlikely that any HR director or school board will go for that. Negotiating before you sign a contract for an extra step based on experience is completely different.
Teachers,3dk273,SoraSono,3,Thu Jul 16 22:15:38 2015 UTC,"It boils down to, ""if you are not in it for the students then you shouldn't be a teacher""  I enjoy working with the most interesting and amazing young people and helping them develop their talents and frankly, that is what makes it worth it. If you don't like working with children, then you will find no respite from the stresses of the profession.   The problems vary from state to state, district to district, school to school. But ultimately, teachers are over burdened and under supported. During the school year, you take on a wide variety of roles and tasks and you never feel like you are done with work. (hence the long summer vacations to recouperate). During the year it is always rush - rush - rush and newer teachers end up being exhausted by the days end. Depending on your admin, you can really feel like you are alone on an island trying to fight off deadlines and managing students while your admins peek in to look a few times throughout the year.    Sometimes as a teacher you are also expected to follow policies clearly geared towards test preparation (because that's all that matters to schools these days) and not the long term benefit of the student.   Of course, I am speaking in comparison to other professions for college educated individuals. Anyone with a college degree will typically earn more for less effort than a teacher so in that sense, teaching is not ""worth it""."

Teachers,3dk273,H_Floyd,2,Fri Jul 17 21:33:21 2015 UTC,"This is a complicated question that probably won't be adequately answered by anything less than a complicated answer. I don't feel like I can do that right now. Instead I will address something else, and hope someone comes along that articulates a real answer better than I could.  What current teachers are telling you is, indeed, very true. Except for that last bit of advice--about wasting your time. Teaching is never wasting time: neither yours, nor your future students'. That's important to keep in mind. It will seem like it at times, but when you consider the long term, that's hundreds of lives you'll have personally influenced (substantially) when you're finally retired. Few professions can claim the same. A fragment of you will be embedded in those brains forever, consciously or otherwise.  That said, if we're to be practical, much of the dissuasion you are facing might have a lot to do with the state you live in and (I assume) intend to teach in. You might consider relocation. Speaking frankly, different states offer very different environments for teachers. In some instances, it's like night and day. Location will, inevitably, contribute heavily to your feelings of self-worth and job satisfaction over the course of your career.  FL, I suppose, has the benefit of already having an ill reputation for support of its public schools. In my home state, and where I teach, I am watching my public schools being actively destroyed with the intention of resurrecting those same schools as charters staffed with non-certified teachers with no public accountability. In the meantime, my neighbor state remains a bastion of public education that has only continued to increase its support for teachers and students. I wish I worked there.  My point is, it's wise to not be tied down geographically. I understand your desire to provide a great education to immigrant children. Working with ELLs (especially Spanish-speaking) has been the bold highlight of my career so far. The enthusiasm you possess will serve you well. Immigrant children are enrolled across the country, perhaps even in places you might not expect. Almost wherever you go, they will be there waiting for you.  I hope you found something helpful there. I sort of feel like your intentions are already very clear--that you're going to teach no matter what. I realize you're feeling uncertain, but it seems like it would take a lot to truly turn you back now. I think you're on the right path."
Teachers,3dk273,salvagestuff,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:07:55 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your detailed insight. As for relocation, that would be an option to consider when I am financially stable. I am still dependent on my parents since I have completed college two months ago. This is great advice.  What are some trustful sources that reveal the benefits and disadvantages provided in each state? After reading posts here, I am discovering how Florida is known for this reputation. The influx of Hispanic and Haitian immigrants is dominant in the area that I live in Florida. In addition, I can speak Haitian Creole...so I believe what would bolster my advantages in finding a job? I feel like I have no choice, but to push forward with teaching. I need to give education a chance, especially for those who need it. BTW, sorry if I am going somewhat off topic, but is it possible to pursue in other areas outside teaching? I know, this is silly question, but I wonder if the time given into a teaching career can allow me to venture and grow in other skills.  I am an avid fan of animation and drawing is my hobby (filled up to 20 sketchbooks of character designs)."
Teachers,3dk273,trexygurl,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:25:12 2015 UTC,"Specializations will typically help make your education career more interesting/rewarding. I can definitely see teaching ELL's to be a very rewarding career and a field that is in demand.   If you want to develop your passion and skills, try looking into some sort of CTE(Career and technical education) certification. Some states will have an Arts A/V Technology & Communication stream which may include animation and graphics design. Being a non-core teacher can be quite rewarding and you can give kids exposure to opportunities that they otherwise would not have.   You can also have your own after school programs."

Even though the political environment is increasingly hostile towards public education, the students NEED passionate and devoted teachers.

Perhaps the OP is nervous about the classroom environment that they will be going in as it something that they aren't used to?    I think that there is a definite need to be flexible in primary school, but there is no need to lessen your expectations because you will be changing the grade.  I think this is a great time to make the transition from what you believe is 'cutesy' to putting more emphasis on the children caring about their education, as they will be moving on to middle school next year."

Teachers,3dij4m,fatt_guy,6,Thu Jul 16 15:33:18 2015 UTC,"I (personally) think the flaw in both of these is they only punish negative behavior.  There is no reward for positive behavior.   Whatever system you chose to use, try to have 7-10 positive comments for every negative.  These can be directed towards the whole class or individual students.  They should be comments on choices made or attainable traits (i.e. ""Thank you for working so hard to get that answer!"" Versus ""you're so smart!""  I'm sure you already do this properly :) )  I like the idea of restarting each day, along with an explanation to the students on why you're doing it that way.  Explain that your class will focus on learning and each day is a new opportunity to learn.  I would also explain, though, that repetitive behavior that takes away from learning will have consequences.  Maybe keep track of the more serious offenses and refer to ISS if the same behavior is done by the same student 5 times in a quarter.  I would pull the student aside after the second time and explain this. The whole class probably won't need to know.  For discussing behavior with a student, I like to use the method outlined by Glenn Latham in his book ""Keys to Classroom Management"".  Basically, you start with a positive. Then outline what behavior happened, what should have happened instead and why.  Then have the student repeat back what they should have done and why.  Finally you have them practice the behavior and compliment them on it.  This usually takes 30 seconds to a minute and should be done away from other students.  This was the only ""consequence"" I used for almost all of my behaviors this year, though I'm sure older students may need a more concrete consequence.  Sorry for this long winded response! I love discussing classroom management. I hope this was helpful."
Teachers,3dij4m,TeacherTish,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:56:59 2015 UTC,"I agree with you that positive behavior should be rewarded, I just didn't include it in the post because what I'm really having trouble with is the negative consequences.  I want to be fair, but I also don't want to give a student 15 chances before they get a referral, you know?    I really like the idea of restarting everyday, but I hate that it allows the possibility for a student to act out every single day and only receive a verbal warning.    I thought about having the students start from the lowest consequence each day, but still record each time they actually receive a consequence.  For example, a student misbehaves twice today and receives the consequence for two infractions.  The next day, the same student misbehaves once, but since we restart each day the student only receives a verbal warning.  However, I've recorded that the student has been served consequences on two separate occasions.   After being served consequences on five separate occasions, the students becomes a repeat offender and receives the corresponding consequence.  So even if you don't actually commit all five infractions in one day, you still get the referral for accumulation. Does that make sense?  The problem I see with this idea is that a student can technically commit 15 infractions before they get a referral while another can commit 5 a get the same thing.    Student A commits three infractions in one day and gets the corresponding consequence, the next day he does the same thing, and he does it for three more days until he finally get written up after receiving consequences on five separate occasions.  He was written up after committing three infractions on five separate occasions.   Student B commits one infraction today and gets the corresponding consequence, she does the same thing the next day, and does it for 3 more days until she get written up after receiving consequences on five separate occasions. She was written up after committing one infraction on five separate occasions."
Teachers,3dij4m,TeacherTish,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:29:42 2015 UTC,"What grade level do you work with?  That changes a lot how you approach this type of stuff.  In my experience, there's usually only 1-2 students per class who really have serious behavioral issues.  With proper positive reinforcement, most of the students will comply or only have minor behavioral issues.    As for your example with student A and B, I would refer student A on day 2, after the fifth infraction has occurred.    I used a chart along the lines of this when I worked with 3rd and 4th graders.  The behaviors can be edited to fit the needs of your grade level.  It allowed me to see patterns for the semester.  When teaching Kindergarten, I used to use the same chart but would have one for each day and I would put the periods across the top.  This allowed me to keep track of behavior as the day went on.  Certain behaviors fell in two or more sections.  For example, you ask a student to finish their work and instead they stand up and say, ""Fuck this shit, I'm not doing it."" then they would get a mark in ""refusal to comply"", ""inappropriate language"" and ""disrespect to teacher"".  If they end up with five tallies in any one row, then it becomes a referral.  Keep notes on the page so you know what to report.  Also, record the date/time of any referral on the page for more data.  Regardless of your system, write down EVERY TIME A BEHAVIOR HAPPENS! You WILL  need this data if it becomes a continuing problem.  Record date, time and possibly location.  My personal policy is to speak with the student each time a behavior happens.  I then record what happened and that I spoke with them in a journal.  Each student (if more than one) gets their own page in the journal in case it needs to be copied for the administration.    If the behavior happens a second time within a short period of time (this can be each week or each semester, depending upon your age group) I speak with them and explain that if this behavior happens again, they will be missing an activity.  I try to make the activity something soon and relevant.  They NEVER miss recess unless the problems are happening at recess.  If it's a lunchroom problem, they sit alone.  If it's a center problem, they miss that center.  etc.    If it happens a third time, I talk to them and remind them they will be missing X.  I also inform them that if it happens again, I will be notifying the principal and their parent.    At that point, if this behavior is happening again each time I inform the parent and principal and usually come up with an intervention plan to stop the behavior.  This plan is discussed with the principal and parent, and then shared with the student.  In the meantime of all of this, I look REALLY carefully for the positive behavior from this student and make extra sure to praise him/her.  If the negative behavior is incomplete work (intentional) then when I see them working on something, I'll praise them in front of the class.  ""I love how (Student) is working really hard in math today!  What a great example for the rest of the class."" along with a nice smile or hand on their shoulder.  Most behavior is attention seeking so you really have to look for those little positive nuggets and praise the shit out of them.  Eventually, they learn that they'll get the attention from positive behavior.  Again, sorry for the wall of text."

Teachers,3dij4m,MrsWhovian,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:16:45 2015 UTC,"My plan is something I came up with, with help from my husband who works with students with behavioral issues.  I had a horrible time my first year with classroom management (partially me being a new teacher, but also partially a crazy situation at my school that doubled our enrollment within a month and led to a lot of high-needs students).  I've used many different systems throughout the five years I've taught, but I really found this to work the best over the last two years (I've only had to refer students to the office twice).  I do defer to school policy, as everyone should.  For example, the student I referred two years ago was a 4th grader.  I found notes of a bullying/self-harm nature and that obviously needed to be reported immediately.  If your school has a bullying policy (which I'm sure they do) make sure to familiarize yourself with it.  Ours is actually a state law, so as teachers we MUST follow it.  Using a chart (like I posted) helps you to really see if there is a repetitive nature to any behaviors which would warrant a bullying report.  It also gives you all the dates and times you will need to fill out your school's form.  Going in with a solid plan is a great way to start your year.  The fact that you're reaching out to the community here and already thinking about situations that could come up shows that you want to help your students succeed and that you're a strong, reflective teacher.  Remember that even the best plans can fail, though, and make sure to leave some ""wiggle room"".  Coming down too hard can sometimes backfire, but you definitely want to be consistent and firm.    If you get part way through the year and realize your plan isn't working, you can rethink things!  Just make sure to come up with a new plan and inform all students (and parents, if necessary) of what the new policy will be.  It doesn't hurt to have a personal ""Class policy"" handbook that all students/parents sign.  This can be a couple pages that just outline your grading policy, classroom expectations, and contact information.  It saves yourself a lot of headaches later, when a student wants to hand something in two weeks late for credit and you their parent is mad at you.  Just pull out the paper they signed and say, ""Sorry, but that's my policy.""    Good luck in the upcoming year!  I'm sure it will be fabulous for you and your students :)"

Teachers,3dij4m,T_esakii,3,Fri Jul 17 16:31:17 2015 UTC,"We have a PBIS system. Each teacher is given 50 individual tickets and 10 class tickets per month. We give them out to students we see being safe, respectful, responsible, or ready to learn. Students put their names on the tickets and are entered in a drawing for a pizza lunch with their friends. Kids do work hard for them, but after awhile it loses its novelty.   In my classroom I've used ClassDojo for the past 3 years and I have it connected to parents' email accounts.

This way I also have a record of most of my parent communications, plus a record of what was said in the chat feature. They get a weekly email and can see every point that their child has gotten and lost and why. It's an immediate way of reinforcing behavior. I only end up taking away maybe 1-2 points per class, so it's a very positive thing in the room. It's also quick. Very rarely do I need to sit and chat with the student about why what they did was disrespectful (for minor class disturbances). I just take away a point, it goes to their parents, and I move on. For major things I have a different procedure, but for things like socializing too much, it's a quick reminder for the student and they usually correct their behavior in a few minutes."

Teachers,3dij4m,a_junebug,2,Thu Jul 16 19:20:18 2015 UTC,"We also use PBIS and it's pretty awesome. in the past few years, we've seen negative behaviors decrease and positive ones increase.  For negative behaviors (as someone else mentioned) you might want to ask the school first. Our entire school has a specific system in place to attempt consistency across the board. This is especially important at the high school level, since the kids are constantly rotating from teacher to teacher.  As a quick overview, here's how ours works:  For minor problems (not working, cursing profusely, etc), we first give a warning. If the student continues negative behaviors, we pull the kid into the hallway to have a quick conference with them. This takes them away from their peers and lets them tell you if there is actually a problem. It's good to use questions for this, not just tell them what's wrong. For a third time, they get sent down to ISS for the rest of the class and you need to call home and make a quick report.   For major problems (slurs, harassment, fights), the student is sent to the office immediately and/or an administrator is called if needed. These students are written up and the punishment is determined by the office.  A system like this is supposed to only really punish really bad behaviors while mitigating other factors. Sometimes, kids just have bad days and literally have no way to escape for a while, so sending them to ISS for only one class lets them cool off and re-orient themselves.   There are some issues that don't exactly fall into the above. Dress code, for example, is supposed to be enforced. A student in violation is sent to the office. However, we only really enforce it the first couple of hours because of pushback later in the day (from students and parents).  Tardies are another matter. We have a specific rule for them, which again includes steps (call home, ISS, detention).  Additionally, most teachers also use their own judgement for things. A lot of us will send a kid to the hallway if they are being pissy or distracting, as long as they continue to work.   Sorry this was so long.   Edit: All of our logs are kept online, so that administrators can easily look them up if needed. Also, if the student didn't make it far enough to get a report (ISS/office/call home), then it's not recorded in the logs."
Teachers,3dij4m,T_esakii,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:41:42 2015 UTC,"Some of the high schools in my district use PBIS, but not the one I'm going to. I wonder if they use a similar model.  I tried looking through their website to get an idea of what it was in case my school decides to start it this year, but it was hard to follow to be honest.  I felt like I needed to be ""trained"" to use it.  Is that how it is or is it something that I can teach myself? How would it work if I'm doing it but nobody else at the school is doing it?"
Teachers,3dij4m,anonoman925,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:00:03 2015 UTC,"PBIS is supposed to give a set of conditions for positive reinforcement while still addressing negative consequences. You can totally use it in your own classroom.  I'll try to break down the different parts.  First, the rules.  Basically, it takes the ""classic rules"" (safety, responsibility, respect, etc) and gives a reward for behavior that lines up with those rules. There's generally a matrix that goes along with it, but the matrix is just a those classic rules expounded for specific settings. For example, the classic rule to be responsible in the classroom would be to be prepared, but in the lunchroom it would be to clean up. You can probably ignore the matrix part, since you will only be working on PBIS in your classroom. You will need to come up with rules. Keep them simple and positively worded. (Example: Instead of saying ""Do not talk"" say ""Be quiet"")  Second, the rewards.   PBIS normally has a ticket system in place. When a student exhibits a positive behavior, you can give them a ticket. These tickets can then be turned in for something. Some places do raffles every week. Some have a ""store."" I would highly suggest not allowing it to affect their grades in any discernible way, since behavior and academic achievement should not be tied to each other.   Third, the feedback.  It's really important that the feedback is immediate. You give them a ticket or positive statement as they are exhibiting the behavior and tell them why they deserve it. Also, it's important to make sure the moment a ""bad kid"" is exhibiting it, that you acknowledge it. They, unfortunately, need the reinforcement more than a typically good kid does. The feedback should be positive and specific, and only focused on their behavior, not their traits. Don't just say, ""Good job!"" or ""That was so smart!"" Instead, say, ""You have been working hard on your conjugating all hour. Thank you."" or ""I appreciate that you have come to class prepared today and ready to work.""   Fourth, the frequency.  As someone else mentioned, you need to acknowledge the positive behavior way more than the negative. We are told to aim for 4-5 positives for every 1 negative. As an exercise, we will sometimes be asked to keep track in some way (tally marks, moving paperclips from one place to another, etc). There are some studies that back up this attitude showing that a higher ratio leads to a better environment. This doesn't have to be all in one class period. But just overall, make sure the positive outweighs the negative by a whole lot.  Fifth, the consequences.  You still need to have negative consequences in place. However, make sure you are addressing the behavior and not the student. Also, you need to frame it within your rules. A student refuses to work? Tell them they are not showing respectful behavior  instead of saying they are being lazy.  Again, sorry this was so long. Even if you don't implement a ticket system, I would HIGHLY suggest the positive behavior reinforcement and framing everything in context of a set of positive rules."

Teachers,3dij4m,anonoman925,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:38:14 2015 UTC,"https://www.pbis.org/  They have a TON of resources available, including a whole beginner section with powerpoints, interactive tutorials, self-assessments, etc. There's also a section for High School PBIS. You'll want to ignore a lot of the school/district wide stuff and focus on the classroom or self-assessment categories.  Here are a few that might be good to start with:  Classroom checklist, management, etc It will give you a good idea of what to focus on for the upcoming year.  This is school-wide, but it gives an overview of the steps taken for PBIS schools. Again, ignore most of the stuff about school-wide and focus on what to use in the classroom. You'll want to skip all of the beginning crap (maybe start around slide 41 or so)."

Hi, I'm not OP, but I'm curious how your school keeps the files online. Is it a program or do you use something like Google docs?    My school uses carbon copy paper for referrals and there is no process, beyond teachers keeping they're own notes, for documenting interventions and parent contact."
Teachers,3dij4m,smylemaster,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:20:28 2015 UTC,"Both!  Our online gradebook/attendance/everything system has portions for referrals and parent contact logs.   The school also has both a google form and a doc set up. We fill out the form to give a quick log of sending students to ISS. This goes into a spreadsheet that the admins have. That way, they can get data on problems and for conferences with parents. It has basic info, such as the student's name and checkboxes to ensure we follow the steps before sending them to ISS. It's really nice to identify problem times and groups.  There is also a doc that we make a copy of and fill out with more details if we want. I only use the doc if I notice it becoming a problem. That way, there is more to reference in the future it needed."
Teachers,3dij4m,T_esakii,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:46:47 2015 UTC,That sounds like such an improvement over our system.  Our district just started using Google tools for education last year so I'll have to mention it to my principal.  Thanks!
Teachers,3dij4m,anonoman925,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:02:37 2015 UTC,"You're welcome! I'm a bit of a Google fangirl when it comes to schools. We have all of our curriculum uploaded and shared between department members (at least in my department). The admins also send out newsletters to the staff that any of the staff can add to/comment on, so we know what's going on in the school for the next couple of weeks.  Additionally, we use Google calendar for all of our events, including faculty meetings, sports, banquets, etc. It helps to schedule parent conferences and IEP meetings as well, since you can easily accept or decline invites right away.   Since all of our students have email accounts, I send all of my notes and assignments out (several times) to the students, parents, case managers, and tutors. It keeps some students from slipping through the cracks and lets parents know what's up and what's expected in the class.   I personally use Google forms to poll my classes for anything from assessing me as a teacher to what kind of music should we listen to."

From what I understand the school wanted me but HR had to officially put me into their system which was why I was getting emails like the one you got AFTER I got the job.

I'll take a shot at parsing it out:   Since it was the ""final round of interviews"", it does seem like, at that time, they had narrowed down the candidates to you and x others. That's why they asked for references to be available, because they're probably going to call each candidate's references to help them make a final decision. Meaning it was close competition.  You probably already guessed as much. So, about that frustratingly brief email. Normally, HR would NOT email ""potential"" candidates regarding a background check. If I had to guess, it sounds like you came out as the frontrunner. Most districts would not spend resources background-checking ALL candidates, just the one they intend to offer the job.

Teachers,3djztx,SonOfApeman,3,Thu Jul 16 21:57:47 2015 UTC,"Walker won't get the nomination because he would be unelectable in 2016.   He's vehemently opposed to all minority groups you could possibly name. Republicans know they've lost their little war on equality for LGBT citizens, and they also know they're completely screwed if they can't appeal to Latinos aside from being the ""party of God(lessness)"", which only takes you so far when you've vowed to stigmatize immigrants from basically anywhere. He has gutted public education from multiple angles. There's the mandatory budget slashing, naturally, but don't forget about giving vouchers to private RELIGIOUS institutions, eliminating the voucher cap, trying to enact legislation to not require certification to be a teacher (somehow that legislation was defeated), and, of course, eliminating most collective bargaining. So much to dig up from his past. College dropout. Was prank called and admitted to considering inciting violence during a peaceful protest. Many of his staff were illegally coordinating funds used for his campaign (obviously, he knew). Sons publicly denounced his hatred of marriage equality. Says he would do a great job fighting terrorists because he survived a recall election. And the list goes on.   In fact, the Republican party may actually have to actively torpedo his campaign if they're to get a candidate that will stand a chance against another Clinton ticket (which would be Bush, and it's not like he'd win anyway).

The M.Ed is its own program that focuses more on data, school culture, and will make you more prepared for admin work if you continue on in that direction.  If I were you, I would go for the M.Ed. Knowing your content is awesome, but there is enough literature and support from other teachers to hone your methods, and even with an MAT, it will be trial and error until you find your own style. An M.Ed will teach you how to streamline your data about student achievement INTO your methods.

It's like she was dealing with the situation instead of me (not in addition to, which is what happened in your case), but she dealt with it in a way I never would, and a way that I don't think was effective. (Yeah, he'll never hurt her kid again, but he'll also never go near her kid again because he's so terrified of her.)  When I found him on the floor crying, I sat down with him and pulled him into my lap and hugged him while I told him I was sorry that happened and sorry he was so scared.

I suspect she'll give me the same input, and I'll be better prepared if anything like this ever happens again.  (The frustrating thing is the parent works in childcare and has worked at a preschool.

Teachers,3dgsci,punkrocksnoopy23,6,Thu Jul 16 15:29:21 2015 UTC,I think you did fine. You focused on the student. Providing comfort and helping them process what happened was all you really could have done.  Don't tear yourself up over what you should have done because you made the best decision in that (heated) moment with the information you had at the time.  If you experience something like this again just know that you would not be out of line to ask a parent to calm down and to allow you to handle a situation. You're a pro!

I was dumbfounded that she didn't realize that maybe she was being over the top once an adult got involved. I ended up having to remove the student and the parent's child from the gym to get away from her. The next year we had to ban her from the school property after she did the same thing MULTIPLE TIMES.  Insanity."
Teachers,3dgsci,bookchaser,0,Thu Jul 16 14:17:29 2015 UTC,"The parent did the right thing. As a pre K teacher and a parent, if a kid walked up and stabbed my kid with a pencil, especially right in front of me, I too would raise my voice to that child (or anyone) who would hurt my kid. Just to be clear, if I saw this kid stabbing ANYONE with a pencil I would raise my voice to him.Even if he was ""just playing""."
Teachers,3dgsci,punkrocksnoopy23,3,Thu Jul 16 14:58:13 2015 UTC,"Well then we very different classroom management styles. Mine works for me, and I'm sure yours works for you. But I'm not okay with a parent coming in and deciding she should be the one who manages my classroom because her child got hurt. Children get hurt. It was not an emergency. I can see now that I should have interrupted her, said I would talk with Jack, and asked him to wait for me in another part of the room while I made sure Caleb was okay/finished up with her. I didn't and that was a mistake that I feel very badly about.  However she disciplines her child at home, she does not have the right to bring that into a classroom with a specific way of dealing with things and disciplining other people's children. She has every right to remove her son from the situation, to ask the other boy to find something else to do and to express any anger, fear or frustration to me, the adult in charge of him, but she did not have a right to express that to a four-year-old."
Teachers,3dgsci,bookchaser,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:41:20 2015 UTC,"I agree. However, asking a kid ""What are you doing?!"" in a loud voice and drawing attention to his actions are not disciplining, and this is where the teacher steps in and intervenes."
Teachers,3dgsci,punkrocksnoopy23,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:39:03 2015 UTC,I think you just did a great job at addressing a hostile parent in this thread.
Teachers,3dgsci,bookchaser,3,Thu Jul 16 16:13:02 2015 UTC,"Parents should never discipline other children who are not their own in a school environment. Never.   Edit: At worst, a parent might pull two fighting students apart and get the attention of a staff member. Anything more than that is dangerous."
Teachers,3dgzi7,Frivilous_Hashtags,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:57:25 2015 UTC,I am a high school journalism teacher and we get our state paper everyday during the school year.  I believe it costs but I think it's at a discounted rate.  Just contact your local or state paper and see if they would be willing to work with you.
Teachers,3dgzi7,sjburg77,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:21:10 2015 UTC,"There typically is a program where you can get the newspaper daily or weekly but it will cost you money.  It is a discounted education rate, though.  My school used to get a copy of the newspaper for all social studies teachers AND the librarian, but the newspaper we got (a major MA paper) took away the education discount so my school ended up stopping the paper."

Teachers,3di4yi,Collegeen,26,Thu Jul 16 13:39:04 2015 UTC,"Public education is supposed to be free. Schools should provide teachers the supplies they need. Half of all Americans are low income or living in poverty. There's a war being waged nationwide against public education. Middle class families and above increasingly avoid public education as their local public schools are being dismantled, which increases the percentage of impoverished families at the remaining consolidated schools.   In my state, it's illegal to require parents to pay for, or provide resources essential for, a child's core education. No crayons, pencils, paper, course books, etc. They can be made to pay for 'extra' materials, such as those needed for a music or art class.   However, my local schools have typically asked parents for supplies. My local Target store prints out these lists from school websites and provides them in a kiosk next to the school supplies they sell. My elementary school began providing teachers with basic supplies last year, after a decade of budget cuts."
Teachers,3di4yi,bookchaser,3,Thu Jul 16 13:55:11 2015 UTC,"The problem is that the schools don't have the money to actually provide all of this stuff either, so it ends up falling on the teacher to get them.  I spent hundreds of dollars a year on basic supplies like paper and pencils."
Teachers,3di4yi,ogrezilla,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:04:49 2015 UTC,Excellent and thorough answer!
Teachers,3di4yi,growling_puppy,6,Thu Jul 16 14:46:35 2015 UTC,"When I was in school, our teacher always sent out a list of things to buy for the school year in August. It included a ruler, pencil case, pencils, crayons, pencil crayons, etc. Many times the parents just assume these things will be provided, so if you just communicate with them you might get a better turn out of supplies!"
Teachers,3di4yi,CanadiaE,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:49:08 2015 UTC,Isn't that normal? The Walmarts around me have displays of school supply lists from most of the teachers in the surrounding school districts and a list gets sent home to students. We always bought my school supplies prior to school starting.
Teachers,3di4yi,11709,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:09:31 2015 UTC,"its common, yeah.  But its also not a list of things the parents HAVE to buy, just things the child will need.  If the parent doesn't buy them, then the school or teacher will have to."
Teachers,3di4yi,ogrezilla,6,Thu Jul 16 17:06:04 2015 UTC,"You answered your own question, I think: urban schools cannot ask this of parents, as most parents are uninvolved, absent, unable, or simply do not care.  In the urban district where I teach, kids barely have clean clothes and food, let alone the stability at home to expect reasonable return on supplies.    The rural school my kids attend ask parents to send in classroom supplies for the class at the beginning of the year - to the tune of about 75 bucks per kid.  As a member of the school board and a parent, I hate this - but I recognize that without it, teachers would have to pay out of pocket, or we'd have to cut programs from an already bastardized system, thanks to local refusal to pay more taxes than the state minimum.     The private and suburban schools I've taught at all pay for this out of the ample community funds going into schools, and/or have parents that would gladly pay for their kid's supplies.    Welcome to the real world of NCLB."

Teachers,3di4yi,gimmefantastic,3,Thu Jul 16 17:12:19 2015 UTC,"The answer is: parents do pay, through taxation. And the government usually insures there will be no further expense.   The crime is your district doesn't reimburse you."
Teachers,3di4yi,anonoman925,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:52:48 2015 UTC,I find it incredibly sad and surprising that your school/school board doesn't provide you supplies or even a cash allowance to buy supplies. wow.
Teachers,3di4yi,hellokrissi,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:35:22 2015 UTC,"Depending on your state, it may be against the law to require supplies. For example, in California, it is against state laws to require students to purchase almost anything.     ""With few exceptions, state law now prohibits schools from charging fees for classroom items and activities and from requiring students to bring materials needed for school. It covers everything from 25-cent pencils and $5 binders to $350 field trips and $500 football uniforms. Resulting from the settlement of a lawsuit against the state, the law reinforces what the California Constitution has guaranteed for nearly 140 years: a free public education."""

We can request things but we have to fill out so much documentation months in advance. However, we can't request anything over summer. The only things we are reimbursed on are non consumable items that become the schools property...but most of us would rather keep the stuff we bought."
Teachers,3di4yi,undependent_1,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:29:17 2015 UTC,As a teacher I understand your frustration. As a parent I wish I didn't have to buy so much for school supplies.  Many of my parents are struggling to get by or have multiple children. Public education is supposed to be free. Requiring parents to buy supplies makes it no longer free. I spent over $100 dollars on school supplies for my daughter (charter school). And I had to buy more as things ran out. That gets really expensive with multiple children. The real issue is that school districts are extremely under funded and can't afford these supplies. Teachers by nature tend to just suck it up and buy things themselves.

Teachers,3dfb01,whatthewhatwhat,5,Wed Jul 15 20:39:18 2015 UTC,I worked 20-35 hours a week throughout grad school and it was very easy. (It helped that I had an on campus job that provides a lot of down time.) The only semester I didn't work was during student teaching and that was because my program kicked out any students caught working (even part time) while student teaching.
Teachers,3dfb01,f1ourish,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:18:11 2015 UTC,Why would they kick out students who had an outside job?  That's a bit crazy for people who really need the money.
Teachers,3dfb01,f1ourish,3,Wed Jul 15 21:27:55 2015 UTC,"I think they didn't want grades to suffer and negatively impact their retention rates. When I complained to some of the admin in the college they just said ""that's why you get married"" (I guess that was an acceptable financial strategy to them?)   It was really idiotic."
Teachers,3dfb01,f1ourish,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:32:51 2015 UTC,Wow.  Well I am currently living with my boyfriend.  I want to be able to let him know what we are in for before I approach him.

And I am currently repaying my student loans under IBR so they are affordable payments. I plan to use PSLF in 8 years when I hit the 10 year mark (hopefully it will be around then lol).   Overall the program was a decent investment since I got a job offer within 2 weeks of graduation and I have good job security.   If you do end up at a program that doesn't allow working while student teaching just set money aside before that and you should be fine."
Teachers,3dfb01,monkeydave,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:45:05 2015 UTC,"Ooooh this would make my blood boil and even though I'm usually very even-tempered, I probably wouldn't have been able to bite my tongue. Are you kidding me? ""Don't work, get married"" is their answer?! Will they be providing the spouse with the amazing job, then? Not everyone has a money tree growing in their back yard- and if I did, I wouldn't have even bothered with college in the first place. Good grief!"
Teachers,3dfb01,monkeydave,3,Thu Jul 16 20:49:38 2015 UTC,"I was not able to do so. I quit my full-time job when I started my M.S. program to get certified to teach. I probably could have held out a semester or two if I wanted to but I hated my job at that point. I got a part-time job to supplement though.  But once student teaching starts, there was no working any full time job. Part-time maybe.  As for length, that completely depends on the state and program. Every state is different. I am in NY. I managed to get my M.S. and get certified in about a year and a half. I started in May and finished in December of the next year."

Teachers,3dfb01,DigitalCitizen0912,3,Wed Jul 15 20:47:31 2015 UTC,"Student teaching doesn't pay. We had to live on loans, part time jobs and my fiance's meager income.  Look into the Direct Grad Plus loan. it's a federal loan. I was able to take out a lot of money over my tuition costs. It was very tight, but we managed it. And under the Public Service Student Loan forgiveness program, I work and pay my loans for 10 years (8 more), under the income based repayment plan, and then the remaining balance disappears."

The most famous (or infamous) is Teach for America. but there may be other local ones. In NYC we have NYC Teacher Fellows.  Basically, these programs are for people with Bachelors already. You get a temporary certification and a job, usually in a high needs school, and get your Masters and certification as you go."

Teachers,3dfb01,Iustinus,2,Wed Jul 15 21:26:33 2015 UTC,"Read through comments and noticed you're in CA. Depending on the school you apply to will depend on what their pre reqs are, how many hours of volunteer work they want from you, etc. etc. I tried working, but it wasn't worth it. Lived off loans. I have a hell of a lot of debt, thanks to BA, Credential, and Masters, but it was all fantastic. I'm still on the hunt after two years of teaching, but hoping to land a job soon with interviews coming up.  Bottom line, you will be killing yourself if you student teach and have another job. If you don't have a family or friends you care to hang out with consistently, do it! You just can't expect to do a credential program, work a job, and have a thriving social life."

I worked as a special education paraprofessional at a school full time while I got my masters at night. Managing the workload was no problem at all (and I'm lazy). My boss was really supportive and helped me do my student teaching at work, so I kept my job and student taught with a teacher I already knew well. Once I finished, I already had my foot in the door and wound up getting a teaching job at the school.  Look for para/teaching assistant jobs and ask them about their  protocol for people getting masters/student teaching at the interview. Good luck!"

Teachers,3dfb01,gimmefantastic,2,Wed Jul 15 23:35:30 2015 UTC,"I worked mostly full time through my bachelors until the last semester where I had to do full-time teaching.

Depending on the amount of work expected on a conputer, which a student may not even have at home, creates a disadvantage for those without at best and possibly unrealistic expectations if they cant find the time to work on it while on campus (what if theyre sick, other teachers also require online activity so it restricts what time they can do your classwork, it could potentially overstress the student especially if they lack time management skills and feel overwhelmed.)"
Teachers,3deiu0,preciousjewel128,2,Wed Jul 15 21:28:42 2015 UTC,"I would make them go to the library, but see how viable that is first."
Teachers,3deiu0,PhantomandaRose,2,Wed Jul 15 17:33:15 2015 UTC,"Yep, this. Talk to your school librarian (if you have one) and see what his/her daily hours are, and share that with your students. Personally, I always tell teachers to advertise that I'll happily let students use the library beyond regular hours if they make plans with me in advance. I think expecting students to go to the public library  can be tricky because of transportation/supervision issues, depending on your student population."
Teachers,3deiu0,heybookworm,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:22:10 2015 UTC,"You might ask students without internet to arrange with you to get hard copies of assignments and to hand in work on paper. I've generally had few students a year take me up on it and, as I asked them to arrange it ahead of time, it prevented the ""I forgot so I'll do it on the bus and hand it in now"" routine."

I am for sticking to the online assignment though it might be tough work. Because exposure to technology is important.   I get 17-18yos and when some of them tells me they have never used a word processor before but I was not that ready to go through it in class. （In the end I had to pair them up to help each other with tech difficulties) but I think the expectation for them to be at a certain level of proficiency is there as they grow older."

I've found it really helpful.  I've also found one thing that works is to print different handouts in different colors if they are going to be used all at the same class period.  It makes sorting a lot easier at the end of class.  (ex. handout one in yellow, hand out two in blue.)  This also makes it easy to see who is working on what and how much time they have spent on it."
Teachers,3dc4by,freelantzer,24,Thu Jul 16 00:27:39 2015 UTC,"Best idea I've ever gotten for organizing hand outs--use a file organizer pocket chart. If you Google exactly that, you'll see a picture of what I mean. I have one for each course I teach. They're all stapled to the wall and labeled with the course at the top and days of the week on each pocket. Any extra handouts from that day get put in the corresponding pocket. When an absent student asks me what he missed, I just point to the wall. No more messy stacks of extra hand outs and puts the responsibility on the student to go get their missed work. Then they can bring it to me and ask any questions, but I don't have to hunt down the work for them."
Teachers,3dc4by,livetolearnandlove,7,Wed Jul 15 10:35:55 2015 UTC,Bonus: if you label the file folder with the standard or topic each week is easy to store your master copy and/or exanple for the next year.

Each student on Fridays gets a sticky note and they write what they remember most from my class (or whatever the question is, but it's fairly general).  I've gotten some hilarious notes and some sad ones and some motivating ones.  Most kids put what they think I want to hear, but after a few months of me randomly reading (anonymously) my favorites they get the idea and start to open up.

Teachers,3dc4by,ARayofLight,19,Sun Jul 19 07:16:54 2015 UTC,"The solution I have for bathroom passes is that students have to leave their cell phone up at the board before they go.  No parties, and no texting and gaming while they are out.  Also, all they need to see is that the phone is up there to know that another cannot go out.  Credit to my old Civics teacher.  My English teacher in high school was fantastic, and he did something for us when we read Invisible Man by Ellison that was genius.  He compiled the music referenced throughout the book or things that were similar to what was mentioned, and gave us all CDs to listen to them so we could understand what Ellison was referencing.  I will probably play music from the time period I'm covering when the students are still filing in.  I also had a Math teacher that would play jazz if we were well behaved and we had silent work time.  On those days where they have research to do or have a class project I may do the same, but try to connect it to the period we're studying.  My beloved Chemistry teacher, who sadly passed away only 3 years after I left high school due to cancer she was fighting, would tap students with a yard stick on the shoulder if they somehow found a way to drift off in class.  That, or a spray bottle of water.  It won the class over on her side, and made sure they didn't want to miss out on the next person who would fall asleep (which were next to none after that)."
Teachers,3dc4by,Gangreless,14,Wed Jul 15 07:50:36 2015 UTC,The yardstick I'm okay with but I can see that spray bottle thing seriously backfiring. I know if a teacher had done that to me in school I would have lost my shit. I got good grades and kept to myself but at that age I was W pretty rebellious and looked for any chance to argue or act out if provoked.
Teachers,3dc4by,mell87,2,Wed Jul 15 09:09:57 2015 UTC,I do the same with cell phones. It really is fantastic. They come back much quicker and I know they weren't just texting in the hallways.

What happens if a student claims to NOT have a phone? Even if you KNOW he/she has one, how can you prove it?"
Teachers,3dc4by,mell87,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:21:35 2015 UTC,"hmm. Thankfully most kids don't have an issue with this. I put it in my syllabus at the beginning of the year and start from Day 1.  If a student did say this, I would probably let him/her go anyway. It's not worth the fight, unless it became a daily issue.   But if I let them go once and knew they had a phone then I would try to see if I could ever catch him/her texting or using it in the hallway. If I see him/her texting then I'd probably try to be funny and be like ""Oh wow! Did you find that phone in the bathroom last time you went?!? Cause you said you didn't have one"". I wouldn't really be angry - just light and kidding around with them so they know I saw it. If I see it in the hallway just call them out on it and they lie to you:  ""but I just saw you texting with your gorgeous bright blue case!"".  Sometimes my students will tell me ""I forgot it at home today"". And I just give them an annoyed face and let them go. But that is rare, and to be honest maybe they really need to make call or text at that moment. You get to know your students though and if one kid is being an asshole, call home or tell him to use the bathroom in other classes."
Teachers,3dc4by,fatt_guy,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:17:56 2015 UTC,During student teaching I probably would have argued with the student and made a huge deal about it.  After reading a lot of material I would definitely do something like what you just mentioned instead though.

If it's not in their pockets after they've done that, it's in their backpack, and it still isn't going to be on them when they go to the restroom.  It helps that these days jeans are getting tighter at the hip and phones are getting bigger so it's getting very easy to tell one way or another.  The next thing on the list would be an iPod/MP3 player or a wallet (depending on what I know of the student)."

I decorate my room like a cafe: black table cloths, battery tea lights, low lighting, seating arranged like a restaurant around a stage area. A fee students in each class are assigned jobs. There are 4 different jobs: hosts seat students at their tables and it's free seating, servers take their orders, baristas make the plates and drinks, and the emcee announces who comes up next to read 3 of their poems.

Then I switch back into teacher mode for about 3 minutes and we talk about the rules of a cocktail party (soft voices, circulating to talk to many people instead of bunching in the corner with friends, etc), and they each carry an index card and a pen to write down little bits of information if they like. Then I turn the lights off, project a crackling fireplace onto the board, and send them on their way as I become their hostess again. They love it! The kiddos enjoy being ""fancy"" and watching me wait on them, and I love getting a full hour of review in without having to lead anything.

They get a detention if back work is due. They then have to fill in a segment of their Goal Packet for that particular interval. They record the date, their grade, their thoughts on that grade and their goals for the next couple of weeks.   I started doing this with my students a couple of years ago. Yes, I still have students who fail my class, who don't turn in their homework, who won't stay after to get their work done. But, that number is a lot lower than all of the other teachers on my team.

I'm sure your students will appreciate it, especially if they come from a low-income area and don't get much in the way of personal celebration.   One idea though - As a July birthday kid, I would have been so jealous of my other classmates... Perhaps you could do half-birthdays for those summer kids?

If kiddos return the pen unharmed at the end of class, they get their dollar back. If they forget, I'll hold it for usually 48 hours. Students who have neither a pen nor a dollar are encouraged to make friends with someone who does."

We have lots of fun talking about what kind of emergencies they can interrupt me for e.g. ""Yes if you are on fire you may talk to me"" ""no being unable to find a pencil doesn't count"". It works really well for me and them because it's a great visual."
Teachers,3dc4by,Bear_Mustache,11,Wed Jul 15 13:07:00 2015 UTC,"I have 4th graders and I got this idea from another 4th grade teacher when I was a day to day sub. We do ""Friday Friendly Letters"" home, each student has a letter notebook and every friday they write a paragraph about what they learned and a second paragraph with anything fun, an improvement for next week and something they're proud of. Parents then read and sign and have the option of writing back in the journal. Its a great tool to keep parents up to date on what's happening in class!"
Teachers,3dc4by,TheJewishCowgirl,5,Wed Jul 15 12:34:56 2015 UTC,"I do something else I stole from someone called a school to home journal. Each day, when we pack up, the kids write a few sentences about their day. I teach third and start out with a minimum of three sentences. I model it for them the first day and we talk about making it interesting, etc. Parents read it nightly and lots of them tell me how much they love it because they learn something about our day that they wouldn't normally hear from the kids."

Although the downside is they're stuck doing the ""bad jobs (I.e. sweeping in the cafeteria), they also get the awesome ones like feeding our class pet!

I have them organized in a folder by subject, then unit, then all the files are numbered in order of lesson and associated files.  For example, if I have a PowerPoint, instructions, and a handout, the files are   2.a PowerPoint   2.b Instructions  2.c Handout  This way everything stays right with what it's supposed to be, and you can quickly stay organized!"
Teachers,3dc4by,bodangren2,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:21:15 2015 UTC,"I do something similar, but since I use Drive a lot, and depend on search instead of file organization, file names are especially important.

One side said BATHROOM PASS in huge letters and the other side said I AM MISSING AN IMPORTANT EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCE BECAUSE I HAD TO GO POTTY with yellow puddles drawn all over the bottom. And I signed it because that makes it official. I never made them use it, they had a choice- and the boys loved that thing. They would request it and drape it around their necks (lanyard) and strut the halls to the one working boys bathroom (boys are gross). It was awesome."

Oh my gosh, I had a couple of teachers who allowed this and it was fantastic. I have ADHD (inattentive type) and math is not my thing, at all. Being in a quiet room with only the sounds of other peoples pencils scratching and papers shuffling and math in front of me was rough. Every time someone got up to sharpen their pencil or go to the bathroom or unzipped their backpack it cut through, and the part of my brain that wasn't trying to focus on the math was constantly bouncing around with other thoughts - What time is it? I'm hungry. This chair is hard. I wonder if I can get on the computer tonight? It smells funny in here.  Having headphones in was like a protective barrier, if that makes sense at all. The music kept the other distracting sounds from getting in, and the part of my brain that wasn't doing the work had something else it was paying attention to so I could focus on the math."

It makes it super easy to record work, see who is missing something, and keep on top of all the work that kids do and turn in.    I have jobs that change three times a year.  They are all posted on library pockets on the wall, with the number of students for each job.  To pick jobs, student numbers are put on sticks and then drawn randomly - and then students put their stick in their choice of library pocket -"

Makes it easy to see who is missing at firedrills, field trips etc. And passing out things too. They line up in roll order and then come get materials in order."

Teachers,3dc4by,BrerChicken,2,Thu Jul 16 03:07:45 2015 UTC,"We had a terrible issue with cell phone abuse in the classroom. Whenever a student was caught using their phones during class, we would write their name on a brown lunch bag, place their phone in it, staple the bag, and return it to the student. This allowed the student to keep their property but not escalate the situation that would cause for an office referral. It was a pretty decent set up.

I then use these numbers to file papers, label the class mailbox, do checklists, take attendance, line ups, etc. It is super helpful and don't have to relabel everything every year."
Teachers,3dc4by,TheNewHumanism,2,Thu Jul 16 00:05:41 2015 UTC,"Want to succeed at parent teacher interviews?  Easy!    Just before parent-teacher night, give kids 15 minutes to write a letter from YOU (as the teacher) to their parent.  Give them a couple of points to discuss, such as work quality, participation, homework completion, behavior, what the kid needs to work on, and attendance.  When parents arrive, don't talk.  Just hand them the letter.  Kids are honest.    In Brooklyn, where I teach, kids often come with parents to conferences.  The looks on their faces when I hand mom and dad the letter they wrote that morning are priceless."

Teachers,3dey14,Fillimilli,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:10:55 2015 UTC,"I was a para and loved it. You don't have the planning or take home work of a teacher, and because your role is completely about service delivery/being hands on with students, you develop really great relationships with the kiddos.   I think one of the most important things is to develop a good working relationship with the teacher(s) you report to. It's their classroom, and you're helping them accomplish what they want to do. Be consistent, listen well, ask how you can help, etc. Don't overstep boundaries and don't go against the rules of their room (I've seen it happen). If you have a problem with them, talk to them civilly or maybe go to their boss.   You also will need to be comfortable working with students with learning or other disabilities. Do you know what your role will be or what type of classroom you'll be in? Some  paraprofessionals are one to one supports for a kid with a severe disability. Others support more generally in a general ed or substantially separate classroom.  Finally, I'd suggest being familiar with IEPs; accommodations, modifications, goals, etc. You probably already are anyways since you taught for a year.   Hope you have a blast in your new role. Kudos to you for making a change and finding the right environment!"

If you have a problem with them, talk to them civilly or maybe go to their boss.    That's really excellent advice. When I was a para, I reported to classroom teachers, specials teachers, the principal (and vice if applicable)--it's important to be flexible, both in scheduling and in philosophy. All those different people don't teach in the same way, but that exposes you to different styles that you'll eventually sort through and sustain or discard depending on what fits you. Be courteous to all, even the ones that don't seem particularly receptive to you in the first place.  Also note that while some teachers love and appreciate the extra help, others may be stressed by it. They may feel an extra responsibility to prep you on daily lessons; or they may be completely hands-off in a ""just follow my lead"" sort of way. Some will want you to work with particular children (if you're not already assigned to do so), while some will insist that you work with all children (even if you're already assigned to a particular kid!)  Truth be told, it's the most under-appreciated job in a school. And if you're a special-ed paraprofessional, it's also the toughest.  On the bright side--and this is also from experience--it's absolutely the best preparation for becoming a full-time teacher. Of course coursework pales in comparison, but even my student teaching had nothing on the experience gained from being an actual employee."

Have a clear starting and finishing routine that gets the class in order. Mine was roughly starting - hello/how are you/register/what day is it/sing the same damn alphabet phonics song, every class. Ending was putting on the same damn goodbye song every class, hand out stickers, put on coats and put stuff away, line up and be quiet before I open the door and say goodbye.  Have a good routine for the class - books/colouring in/songs/video/game/storytime, whatever your routine is keep it the same every class. They'll know what to do, there'll be less chaos.  Stickers were my discipline saviour. Be clear and consistent with rules and unacceptable behaviour - if any shouting is unacceptable, it all is. I would tell them at the time, no sticker because X, and at the end remind them again."

Teachers,3df5x6,katrionatronica,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:19:51 2015 UTC,"Procedures, these seem a very American thing, I teach in Spain... I'm not exactly sure what you mean...  Entrance procedure? Hang up your coat, choose a seat, put your bag under your chair... And exit procedure too.  Procedure for getting the teacher's attention? Some will come and poke you for attention, shout at you, run up and interrupt you, push other students out of the way... You want something like 'come to my desk and wait' or 'put your hand up and say Teacher'.  Procedure for getting their attention? Kinders will chat during class, but at times you need quiet. So a procedure to get them to shut up and listen will be handy, like clapping your hands, or shushing and getting all the students to shhhhh until everyone is shushing instead of talking.   I guess you'd want to get those ones straight pretty fast. And go over good and bad behaviour in the first class especially - some of these kids may never have been in a classroom before and they won't know stuff like running in class is bad or you can't take things without asking. You need to keep this stuff reinforced - maybe stick two lists on the wall, good and bad behaviour, and write your key examples on it.

My only advice is procedure, procedure, procedure.  Practice it with the kids.  Beat it to death.  When you think they finally got it, review it a few more times.    Also you should have a waiting chair.  At first during guided reading kids would interrupt all. the. time.  A waiting chair is where students go when they need the teacher.  They have to sit in the chair and wait.  Not follow the teacher, not call out, not climb under the table.  If someone is in the waiting chair, too bad, you have to wait for them to get out.    You will VERY QUICKLY realize 99.999999999999999999999% of the reasons they need to talk to you are completely NOT valid reasons and they have little to no ability to filter them. The waiting chair will usually be filled, but at least they aren't interrupting you AND it filters out some of the less pertinent interruptions because they forget."
Teachers,3df5x6,donanobis,3,Thu Jul 16 00:32:36 2015 UTC,I love the idea of a waiting chair. I've never heard of anything like that. I'm totally going to try that this year.

Teachers,3df5x6,Thewhitneygirl,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:36:06 2015 UTC,"The biggest thing is procedures and rules. Make the rules WITH your students and review them EVERYDAY. Model the right way to do them and the wrong way. Have a procedure for everything. And I mean everything. I teach my kids how to sit in a chair, push in a chair, walk to the carpet, how to use a pencil. If you expect them to do something teach them how to do it. Correct them the very first time they do it wrong. Let the kids know up front who is in charge. Have a behavior system in place and explain it to them. Make it specific and concrete. If you do a clip chart then tell students exactly what happens at each level (I.e. If you get on yellow it is a warning. Orange is five minutes of recess etc.) I know this sounds harsh but its very important to set the tone for your whole year. I am never mean about my rules or making a bad choice I just am matter of fact. My first year I was too lax and I had the worst year of my life. My second year I drilled procedures daily and my class ran like a well oiled machine. Other teachers in my building thought I was too hard on my students but I had a great year and my students knew exactly what to expect and knew what I expected of them. I got compliments on my kids all the time and compliments on my kids knowing our routine. Eventually you will be able to ease up and drill routines and procedures less but don't let students get away with breaking your rules. You can give them a warning but just one. Never say you are going to do something and then not follow through with it or they will pick up on it. Like I said you will eventually ease up but you will be so thankful that you have drilled those routines :) It makes your year much easier!"
Teachers,3devtp,markashworth,2,Wed Jul 15 18:55:25 2015 UTC,How is it different from Socrative?
Teachers,3devtp,vnlqdflo,2,Wed Jul 15 22:16:39 2015 UTC,"Thanks for viewing my post and asking. Spiral Quickfire is VERY similar to Socrative. The major difference is that Spiral Quickfire has a 'teacher mobile' interface where the teacher can filter and send back answers to students for review/improvement before the teacher chooses to display it to the whiteboard. (It's been a while since I tested out Socrative - so I'm not 100% sure if they do that too)  The other Spiral app, 'Discuss' is a different app entirely to what Socrative does. It has features that are geared more towards preparing and managing class discussions (such as 'shuffling' where the teacher can shuffle students' answers and deal them back to other students in the class for their input).  These are very 'UK' based classroom activities. It would be good for us to learn more about whether Socrative meets the needs of teachers in the US and what we could do in Spiral's apps to help in US based classrooms."

Teachers,3de6g5,wyrwtb,5,Wed Jul 15 15:57:40 2015 UTC,"My biggest problem with the activity is that no one cares.  I remember a teacher who would require every student to comment on two other students' posts once a week, and it was such a waste of time. Clearly, no one read any of the posts. They were all «Good! I like (random first sentence of a paragraph)!»  At best, it encourages reading and writing among the technologically proficient (who are probably already doing such), and alienates those who are not."
Teachers,3de6g5,kuury,5,Wed Jul 15 16:02:01 2015 UTC,"Totally agree.  I think this speaks to the HUGE social disconnect between educators and teenagers. The vast majority of teenagers don't care about blogging. Most teenagers seem to be more technologically illiterate than the teenagers from ten years ago. I think this is a side effect of computers and the Internet becoming simpler. So when you put blogging software in front of a student, his reaction is almost certainly going to be ""what the fuck is this shit? Why don't we use Instagram?""  Liking a picture is a hell of a lot easier than making a thought out comment on a blog."
Teachers,3de6g5,PhantomandaRose,2,Wed Jul 15 16:29:56 2015 UTC,"I've experienced the same thing in some of my online grad courses, and I've seen students experience the same thing at the community college.  One of my education books -- I forget which since I'm up to my eyeballs in so many -- mentioned that teachers should model strong discussion post responses and actually use a brief rubric for grading for quality rather than just post count. I thought that might improve things a bit at the college level.  Another problem is the prompt itself and whether students acknowledge it. For example, in one of my courses last semester, the discussion asked us to comment on the chapter assigned, but most students summarized. WTF would I need to see 15 summaries of the chapter for when I already read the chapter myself? The point was to comment on it, e.g. point out insights, questions, and so on, but I was one of only two who did that. The professor never intervened, and thus it was a waste.   Currently I have an online course in measurement/testing, and the ""discussion"" prompts are seriously such things as, ""Calculate the standard deviation of..."" and ""Define validity.""  There is no room for discussion with such prompts. You either know your shit or you don't, and if you're a freeloader, you wait until others post first and copy from them."
Teachers,3de6g5,jimmymckinney,3,Wed Jul 15 16:32:05 2015 UTC,"While my students didn't blog, I had my 4th grade guided reading groups work through Moodle to edit wiki pages, add glossary entries, and submit online writing assignments. We also had an online chat at one point where we essentially held a silent discussion using our computers. The kids were obsessed with the website and kids who had previously told me how much they hated writing in their journal, would now rush to the computer to add more entries to the wiki page or to the glossary.  I think the age group as well as the content of the blogs can really affect the motivation of your students. Older students probably already have a good idea of how to make a blog and are already involved with a number of social media sites where blogging is not something new and exciting for them. However, younger children from my experience have loved working on the computer even if they are doing similar tasks to what they had previously considered mundane.  I do believe blogs are more authentic and the interactivity is exciting because students can show off their work. But if everyone has their own blog, they aren't likely to want to spend loads of time reading everyone else's entries because they care more about their own work and the work of close peers than they do the whole class' work. Having some kind of communal blog might help increase desire to work because now a single entry becomes a team effort. Students can edit other people's posts or add on to them based on their own interests or ideas rather than just simply being forced to comment on posts for the sake of interaction. Having the class wiki where everyone could add information and opinion on a single character or event rather than everyone having their own posts on their own blog, really helped motivate all students to collaborate and produce something better."

I didn't require students to read or comment on one another's blogs, but it made it much easier for me to help guide and evaluate their research. It also made it much easier to utilize the computer classrooms and make class time productive for all of us. A lot of my colleagues assigned research journals rather than blogs, and I think the difference was negligible either way. Honestly, I preferred blogs because it made my life easier, but it would have been a nightmare having to grade comments, etc. Just my two cents!"
Teachers,3de6g5,NoButMaybe,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:44:36 2015 UTC,"This context makes more sense. The blog becomes a dialogue between professor and student in the research process. That's a cool concept. The students who care would take advantage of it and go all out, I'm guessing."

The responses sucked. And they whined about it... A LOT. So I got sick of fighting it and did away with the blog assignment and really haven't looked back.  I now have them do weekly reading responses. I still have them post online, but it is submitted via Moodle, and there is no requirement for students to engage with one another's responses--instead we do that in class through discussion, which we were doing before anyways. I have gotten no push back with this assignment, and have been very pleased with the quality of their work. I will continue this in the future, and feel that this is a much more effective assignment.   So, I am on team no blog, on behalf of my students. :D  Edit: words"

Teachers,3de6g5,Dire88,2,Thu Jul 16 02:23:31 2015 UTC,I think teachers requiring blogs have to be very careful to make sure the focus is finely tuned.

I would much rather write papers or reading responses for only the professor to see.

No surprise here...the ones that are good students meet/exceed expectations.  The ones that are not good dedicated students...don't.  I started out having students read an article on a topic connected with our current chapter.  All they had to do is comment on the article (I provided questions to guide them).  Then by a certain deadline comment on someone's comment.  The ones that did it got a lot out of the dialogue with their fellow students.
Teachers,3df0rq,gangstead,10,Wed Jul 15 19:29:26 2015 UTC,"They may ask why you want to work there or something similar.  You can frame it as ""This school and neighborhood have such a great reputation. I have young children, and we have actually been considering moving to this neighborhood because this is a school I would like my children to attend.""  Honestly, unless they ask about how you might improve community involvement or something similar, I wouldn't mention that you want to start a program. It may come off as too 'uppity'.

Teachers,3df0rq,gimmefantastic,2,Thu Jul 16 04:48:00 2015 UTC,"It's not a bad idea, especially if it's true. They want somebody who is committed to the school, and not just using it as a stepping stone until a better job comes along. In fact, some school districts (Philadelphia, for one) require their teachers to live in the city limits. The community-building idea is also good, but not something to shoehorn in - if the question comes up, you can say it just like you said it here - a program you saw that makes the school a more important part of community life."

Teachers,3dbhsn,Mennalus,2,Wed Jul 15 02:14:53 2015 UTC,"I don't agree with your interpretation of the graph in that article. It could be argued, on the basis of that graph, that were it not for the Great Recession, the percentage of teachers leaving the profession would have doubled in the last 25 years.   I don't mean to be argumentative. I just think that, based on the graph, we can not say that the percentage of teachers leaving the profession is not increasing significantly."

Teachers,3dbhsn,alienus,2,Wed Jul 15 15:54:45 2015 UTC,"I worked at a software company that is oft regarded as one of the best in the Netherlands.  One of their best instructors in the programming courses they gave to their own employees used to be a school teacher (at a high school, before applying at said software company)  He eventually stopped giving courses, because he wanted to be out in the field again, as a consultant/programmer. In a sense, he still basically was a teacher that way, since consultants often are specialists that tutor and assist other programmers to find better solutions to problems.  Teachers can leverage their skill considerably when they have a roll as a teacher, in a  different function, conveying skills and best practices onto others. - Perhaps though, this is more uniquely suited to the IT field."

I was actually surprised because I did better than I thought. Of course I'll probably bomb the actual test... My worst section was surprisingly government and best was behavioral science."
Teachers,3ddid4,jdavij2003,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:09:49 2015 UTC,"My best advice is: if you don't know the answer to a question, flag it and move on to the next.  Once you've answered all of the questions that you definitely know, go back and attempt to answer the more difficult ones.  This way you don't waste a lot of time agonizing over hard questions and potentially run out of time to answer the questions that you do know."

Teachers,3da096,hoopyfroood,2,Wed Jul 15 01:18:33 2015 UTC,"I'll never understand a system that prevents transfers to other boards. The idea of starting over makes me want to vomit. I sucked up my 5 years as an occasional teacher because I'm very passionate about what I do, but I don't know if I'd have the strength to go through that again.     Best wishes getting on the list! They'd be foolish not to take someone with all your experience!  I'll second your ""Fuck you Kathleen Wynne."" I'm really tired of feeling like her scapegoat. She was instrumental in the introduction of full day kindergarten, which is not a bad idea, but Ontario couldn't afford it. But they needed it to win the election, her and McGuinty, so they went ahead and made it their platform. Then they kept their promise and implemented the program despite not having the money. And now they need their money back. Now she has the audacity to say that teachers are the ones refusing to bargain when in actuality they are the ones with impossible demands. We didn't make any demands!   For 90 minutes a day they want to remove the ECEs from the brand new program they just created that is reliant upon a 2(staff):30+(4-5 year old student) ratio and let the principal decide where they are needed (so... EA positions...) A 1:30+ ratio of four and five year olds is unsafe and children will get hurt. If I had children I would not put them in that situation.   EAs are trained specifically to work with children who have special needs, ECEs are trained specifically to work with young children. There are going to be behaviour/safety problems with this too. Ugh. No one is saying it yet, but they are coming for EA jobs. If they get their way, there will be EA job cuts. EAs get paid more than ECEs.   Remove classroom cap language from all agreements?!?!! What?!?!!?   Principals can direct prep time?!?!? Again, what?!?! Why?  All of this is set up for some major cuts. I did not vote for them and I'm furious that we're being thrown under the bus for their financial mismanagement.  Mic drop.  Sorry, I kind of went off the rails there. I hope there are some better options in our next provincial election."

All will depend on who wins the next election though, so keep your eyes/ears on the news.   I'm very mad right now, but I love my job. Some government nonsense isn't going to change that. If you really want to teach here, you can do it. It takes time (5-10 years) of day-to-day/long term occasional work to get a permanent position unless you are French (in the elementary panel). If you're willing to put up with that, every province has times when politics interfere with education to it's detriment."

Teachers,3da096,k6richar,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:03:31 2015 UTC,"I'm really hoping you're right about my experience helping - but it didn't when I applied to the Waterloo board in the fall. They were looking for both Computer Science and Physics teachers (2 of my 4 teachables) but I still didn't get on their Occasional list. I don't know if I royally screwed up the interview or it was just because I didn't have any experience or references from within the board, but it was pretty discouraging."
Teachers,3da096,MilgramHarlow,2,Wed Jul 15 12:24:56 2015 UTC,Waterloo is known to get a huge number of applicants even for the rare teachables.
Teachers,3da096,MilgramHarlow,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:46:10 2015 UTC,"So is Upper Grand, unfortunately. When I started teaching the high application areas were those that had a Fac of Ed in them (eg. Ottawa, London), UGDSB and Waterloo. And it's just gotten worse since. I'm pretty sure I was just a casualty of cronyism unfortunately - hopefully the amount of time I've spent in UGDSB doing various piece work is enough to beat that."
Teachers,3da096,MilgramHarlow,2,Wed Jul 15 13:12:01 2015 UTC,"Not sure if I understood some of your terms. Is there an actual rule that teachers must work as substitutes in a school division before being hired to teach full time?  There's nothing like that here in Saskatchewan. Although it seems that you need to either know someone, substitute for 1-4 years or teach in a rural school before you'll be hired in a city."
Teachers,3da096,MilgramHarlow,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:16:07 2015 UTC,"Government imposed as of last year. In order to be hired as a fulltime teacher you need to be on the LTO roster which is a list of teachers who can cover things like maternity leaves, extended sick leaves, year sabbatical, etc. In order to get hired on to the LTO roster, you need to be on the Occasional teacher's (substitute teacher's) roster for the board (I'm not 100% that part is government imposed, but all boards are doing it anyway). The only way around it is if they're hiring for qualifications that nobody has - generally French.  So basically to get a fulltime job you have to go Occasional Teacher's roster --> LTO roster --> fulltime.  And hiring from the LTO roster is seniority based, so experience is irrelevant - my 15 years of teaching means jack shit if someone fresh out of teacher's college with the same qualifications as me gets on the LTO roster first.  Not even administration agrees with this format, everyone from teachers up to school board Superintendents hate it. But some asshole in Parliament who doesn't know the first thing about education thought it was a good idea, so here we are."

Teachers,3dc5o0,brioche74,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:52:26 2015 UTC,"In my district you are only allowed to take 2 weeks for paternity leave unless there is a doctor's note saying you need to take longer. Check your contact and talk to someone in HR who deals with insurance/medical leave to be sure of your time.  You have up to 12 weeks of FMLA time,  but you have to have the note from the doctor.  You will also have a lot of paper work to fill out so make that contact in HR no matter what. As far as planning,  you are on family leave and you don't have to do anything for your sub  (but that would be a bad idea). When I was on leave in may for my baby I left pretty detailed plans because my sub had never taught my subject before. When I was out for my first child I left an outline.  Legally you are not required to do anything during your leave (the school isn't even allowed to email or call you, they can only send you correspondence via USPS). If it helps think of it this way,  if you were in a car accident and ended up in the hospital, you wouldn't have to make sub plans before you got in the ambulance."

I was in a lucky situation in that I had just finished student teaching with the teacher across the hall (and by just, I mean she went out a day earlier than expected and I actually subbed for her on my last student teaching day), so I got to talk to her a lot about what she wanted done. She gave me the unit with materials such as the book, study guide, quizzes, handouts, etc., but as far as daily planning and grading that was up to me. She also gave me some leeway; if I found additional day to day resources that I preferred over hers, that was fine as long as I covered the material on the quizzes, unit essay, and unit test."
Teachers,3db3gd,heartx3jess,5,Tue Jul 14 22:09:15 2015 UTC,"Have you looked into alternative certification? ESL/Bilingual are usually high-needs subject areas. In most programs, you teach full-time while working towards your Master's Degree and permanent certification.  If you like working with elementary students, I'd suggest also looking into Bilingual Education, where you teach content in two languages."

Teachers,3db3gd,benmets22092,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:39:37 2015 UTC,"I would look at Teaching Fellows programs - they're in pretty much every major city now - I did NYC Teaching Fellows, and overall it was good - Plus, NYC always needs ESL and Bilingual Teachers.   I'd only take this route if you're comfortable working with K-12 students, feel somewhat confident in your teaching ability and ability to relate to students, and have a good work ethic. Alt. Cert. programs are a lot of work, and it can get overwhelming since you're teaching without really having learned how to teach, adapt curriculum, etc.   I also agree with the commenter who suggested subbing first - it's a good way to get your feet wet and see a variety of grade levels/class situations, especially if you're in grad school at the same time."
Teachers,3db3gd,gimmefantastic,5,Thu Jul 16 01:35:10 2015 UTC,"If you enroll in a master's program, be aware that it might just be a masters and not also be a concurrent licensing program, so check on that."
Teachers,3db3gd,TayMin,3,Tue Jul 14 23:40:05 2015 UTC,"I can't speak to the different certifications but I have a little bit of insight into getting a license in a different state. I am certified in the elementary grade levels and it might be different for teaching specific subjects so be sure to check with an adviser or a licensing department for the particular state you really do want to teach in.  Reciprocity for teaching credentials can vary between states. Some have more requirements and may be difficult to move into. On the flip side, you can usually take those credentials anywhere. I have my multiple subject credential in CA and recently moved to WY and I did not have to take the Praxis tests or any additional coursework because CA had their own tests that met the same standard. The one thing I did need to do was a Wyoming State Constitution test. This might be different for different states but all I had to do to meet this requirement was have my master teacher act as a proctor and watch me take a 20 question multiple choice quiz. Be prepared for lots of fees and hoops to jump through like finger printing, background checks, institutional recommendations from your program, and school transcripts. All in all I think it has cost me a little over $300 to get my new license. The best resource has been the licencing board. Their job is to address all of the nagging little questions that get stuck in your head and in my experience in Wyoming they have been incredibly helpful!  This is a chart I used when looking into reciprocity of teaching licenses. Some of the links may be broken but it gives you a general idea of what transfers where: http://ase.tufts.edu/education/student/documents/stateByStateReciprocityChart.pdf"
Teachers,3db3gd,Lulahula01,2,Wed Jul 15 01:54:38 2015 UTC,"Since you are not certified, you would need to enroll in a licensure program. (3 or 4). Some states require a masters, so it may be easiest to get you masters alongside your license (3). You can work in another state, just make sure you satisfy their course requirements wherever you go."
Teachers,3db3gd,Lulahula01,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:24:34 2015 UTC,"Thanks! So it's pretty easy to switch to different states? I assume you just need to like, take that state's test or something"
Teachers,3db3gd,coreyshep,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:50:22 2015 UTC,"Yes, you'll probably have to take their test. Some states have reciprocity which makes things easier."
Teachers,3db3gd,coreyshep,2,Wed Jul 15 17:56:06 2015 UTC,"Call the university you intend to enroll in and ask to speak with a licensing specialist in the teacher education department. Most schools with a teacher prep program will have at least one staff member whose job it is to coordinate licensure, and they can usually answer questions regarding the various paths.    I second the commenter that stated looking into alternative licensure. This is an option for people with a degree in a high demand field where you are fast tracked into a teaching position. The only problem with this is that you lack the pedagogy experience that helps you connect your content knowledge with the students. Content knowledge is important, but so is knowing how to best connect with your students. If you are interested in getting some of that pedagogy experience by enrolling in a program, you should consider one that would allow you to concurrently pursue licensure (a post-bacc, non-degree program) with a master's program. I completed a post-bacc elementary education licensure program simultaneously with my Master of Arts in Curriculum & Instruction. Doing this makes the best use of your time and allows you to often start at a slightly higher pay grade. If you can, sign on to be a substitute teacher in your local area. This will allow you to quickly orient yourself with a wide variety of teaching scenarios. You'll face dilemmas common to full time teachers and you'll become familiar with classroom management and some of the record keeping systems used by teachers.    Buena suerte en tus esfuerzos!"
Teachers,3dcjbh,MicroLovesMacro,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:08:27 2015 UTC,"The NTE no longer exists. There are exams like the Praxis that allow teachers to prove subject-area proficiency, the results of which can be submitted to one's state credentialing board for addition to one's teaching credential.  Also, you're MIL might be confused about what the NTE actually did. It was a test that many (not all) states accepted as part of a teacher's preparation/coursework to apply for a credential in a specific state. It was not a de facto credential in all states--she likely had to submit her test results and other paperwork to the state/county credentialing offices for processing and approval. If she taught on-base, rather than in a local public school, then other rules may have applied. Most states do not have full reciprocity."
Teachers,3dbsen,youtastelikeaburger,3,Wed Jul 15 01:20:18 2015 UTC,"There's always that risk of angering everyone when you involve CPS.  When students talk to me, if I get even a sense of the conversation leading to mandated reporting, I stop the student and inform her that I am a mandated reporter and I explain everything the student needs to know in order to make a decision about confiding in me.  Obviously this could cause the student to decide against confiding in me, but I think that's unlikely. Besides, I don't want to trick students into giving me information. Giving them the choice of confiding in a mandated reporter will at least ensure they don't ever feel betrayed by me. I think giving them some sense of power helps as well.  A lot of kids don't seem to realize that there is an entire system set up to help them. For many kids, that system is vilified as an untrustworthy entity that will make the kid's life even worse."
Teachers,3dbsen,PhantomandaRose,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:57:43 2015 UTC,"/u/PhantomandaRose makes a very good point. If you tell the student that you are a mandated reporter as soon as you think the conversation might go to a place where you are required to report, you haven't betrayed their trust. You have just informed them of your responsibilities. If they choose to continue to talk to you and do divulge something you need to report, then you know they wanted you to report it. If they say, ""Well, never mind,"" and walk away, just remind them that you are always there for them.  In NYS, the teachers are not required to go to administration first. In fact, we are expected to make the call of administration or guidance won't. If we don't make the call and it is shown that we knew about a bad situation and did nothing, we can be charged criminally. If the parents are worried that CPS will break up their family, well, too bad for them. They need to make sure that their children are safe, first and foremost. CPS doesn't always take the child away from the parents. Sometimes CPS should and doesn't. Other times, they realize that the parents had nothing to do with the incident.   You did the right thing."
Teachers,3dbsen,driveonacid,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:56:09 2015 UTC,"Social Worker here. (I was checking out this sub because I just got a job as a school social worker!). I've had to call CPS many, many times over the course of my career. It always sucks. It almost always feels like a grey area. You always worry about the consequences-the kid/family not trusting you, families being broken up unnecessarily, etc. But its a risk you have to take to ensure that kid and all kids are safe from abuse and neglect. And remember-the goal of CPS is always to keep the family together. They always try to help the families without breaking them up. They only take children from the home that are in serious immediate danger.   You did the right thing. I hear stories all the time from the children I work with about how they disclosed their abuse to someone and that person did nothing. As someone who has dealt with the aftermath of children being abused-Thank you for trying to protect this kid. There's some research that shows that when children disclose their abuse once and no one does anything-the chances of them disclosing again are miniscule."

When I took the English Praxis, I bought the practice book, took the two pretests in it, saw what I did wrong and memorized it.  Then, taking what I knew of theory and a lot of what I've read/know, head up my ass, managed a 197 out of 200.  A lot of the questions they asked were about African American lit, which I simply had no idea about and guessed on name recognition.  These tests are bullshit.  We don't know everything, but we know how to teach at the end of the day.  My advice is to kill 20 bucks on a review book, take the tests, see what they're asking, and examine areas of weakness.  Once that's done, say fuck it and simply go for it.  The tests are really not that big of a deal and because of the fact that you're asking for advice, I know you'll pass this thing first try because you're stuck up on it.  Believe in yourself!

I feel pretty confident about the science, but the PLT 7-12 is what I'm worried about. I was never really taught anything useful. The classes I took were all tailored to what the professors wanted to hear.  I never learned much about Bloom or the others, though the practice materials I've been looking through ask much about them.  Thanks again! I'll bite the bullet and pay ETS for their practice book.

The training itself is great, but I think it's more big picture than just what kind of specific training you receive. I have my M.Ed in Early Childhood Education and Development from an IB school. During my training I worked in the child development center which followed Reggio Emilia approach. All of our training was top-down, play based, and community oriented. In terms of professional development it's the way to go. IB views are embedded throughout the courses and it shapes you as a person and a teacher.  Has it helped me with employment? No. There is an IB school in my district. It seems like it's being used as a buzzword for districts to say they are doing something different and worldly. Similar to having a random Montessori school in the district. The kids are doing no better socially or academically in my opinion. The teachers are trained as hired and that's where this all breaks down. These schools should be set up to attract people who go through M.Ed IB programs and have a certain teaching style. Instead, they hire teachers with generic teacher training and then try to change their views. It doesn't work from what I can see.  TL;DR GREAT for your own development, if a college program has gone through the effort to be IB then it's probably quality. MEH for employment at this point in time."

I'm a fan of a few youtube series like  minute physics, veritasium, sixty symbols, smarter every day, and crash course. Tom Scott and VSauce sometimes have good physics stuff too. I don't always show the videos in class: instead I've designed a few lessons to show the same thing.  There's a few demonstrations that I find work better than the typical textbooks ones. I find Barton's pendulums works better for showing resonance than tuning forks and those boxes. Alternatively a bass guitar hitting the right note is bound to make something in the room vibrate! Smartphones have good apps that often work better for me than lab equipment. I only have android, which has apps like Physics Toolbox, and Sensor Box Plugin for all-in-one toolbox which replace accelerometers, sound meters, magnetometers etc."

Teachers,3dae1u,Lulahula01,7,Tue Jul 14 19:55:52 2015 UTC,"Teaching is fun. I don't think a lot of people remember that. You get to hang out with great kids and share with them something you are passionate about. It's also hard, cognitively and emotionally challenging, and under appreciated. But really, it's a blast.  I love going to work (almost) every day. I enjoy getting to know my students and finding creative ways to get them to learn. You are doing something that builds the foundation for someone's life.  Hopefully you will do it well and they will have a strong foundation and go on to do good things. Sometimes, despite your efforts, it doesn't go the way you hoped. But you tried, and next year here are more kids for you to try and help! And as I said, it's fun."

It could be reading a student's first and last essay and realizing how far they've come. It could be a student turning in their first homework assignment halfway through the year. It could be seeing your student's test scores rise dramatically.   That's really what makes me deal with all the other stuff in education. I make a daily impact on people's lives.   My job matters.

I'm in Las Vegas, NV right now and when I graduate I'd like to move up to Portland, OR. I want to go into Elementary School Teaching. I think it'd be fun to work with younger kids and see that enjoyment of them learning. I would like the high school aspect as well of being able to help kids/young adults prepare for life after high school too.

Teachers,3dae1u,RockMyWrld,3,Tue Jul 14 20:18:39 2015 UTC,"So I had a similar issue. When I was in high school, I had decided that I wanted to become a teacher, and even participated in ""future teacher"" programs at my school. I graduated high school and when I began telling others that I wanted to go into teaching, I got a lot of negative comments. Including: the pay isn't good, kids suck and are really bad, administration is terrible, etc. And I was getting this from people who were already teachers. And so I listened to them. I pursued a different path in college, but teaching was always on the back of my mind. After I graduated college, I went on TWO (seriously, just two) interviews for what I had wanted to pursue, and I was bored the entire time I wanted to cry. I knew at that point that I was going to pursue alternative certification. Once I started that, I was instantly excited and worked everyday to complete whatever requirements I needed.  Honestly, I think that the positives are different for everyone, and since I haven't yet started teaching, I can't tell you what they are for me. But I can tell you that pursuing teaching so far has made a huge difference in that it allowed me to finally be passionate about something."
Teachers,3dae1u,coreyshep,3,Tue Jul 14 22:17:46 2015 UTC,"Honestly, there are SO many teachers who nag, bitch, and complain (NBC teachers). But I friggin love my job. The amount of curiosity that children have (I teach 6-7) and the reward I get each day makes it all worth it. I do have days where I question my career choice, but who doesn't? The next day it's all forgotten when the child who made you scream the day before makes you say ""FUCK YEAH he learned something from MEEEE"" the next. And then at a national convention a student recognizes you for all that you did for them (seriously bawled my eyes out at AVID summer institute).  I work in a school where the older teachers (within 5 years of retirement) are SO negative. Seriously, everyday at lunch is ridiculous. They complain about everything. But I HAVE to tune it out, look at the bright side, and understand that they are burnt out and don't appreciate the job anymore. I am constantly looking for ways to improve (here I am on vacation, a little tipsy, and researching Ebinders). There are two outcomes for you, you back out of teaching before you start, you try it and quit after a few years, or you try it and it becomes the most rewarding experience of your life.  I am a firm believer that teachers are teachers before they know it. You'll either make it, or will quit, and there's nothing wrong with trying. I say if it's calling you, GO FOR IT!!"

Teachers,3dae1u,coreyshep,2,Wed Jul 15 06:43:13 2015 UTC,"I teach in Florida, so it has a rep for being the worst state for teachers. But I ignore the politics and focus on the job in front of me.  I will add that it does take a few years to get the hang of things (at least for me - I started really young). I felt like i had no clue what I was doing until about year 3. I questioned whether I made a mistake the first 2 years, until I felt like I was doing a good job.  Don't be afraid to ask colleagues for help - you will depend on them, and they will depend on you. And use the Internet! Beg, borrow, and steal is my practice. You don't have to invent lessons out of thin air ALL the time, not even most of the time. Find lessons, handouts, etc online, and find ways to make them your own. Some are so good you can follow them to the letter! Don't reinvent the wheel!!"

Students usually come to you with at least some experience in literacy and numeracy, and, like you said, they are beginning to develop their own interests and formulate aspirations.   I initially wanted to teach high school math, but once I started substitute teaching, I got to work with early elementary students and realized that that was where I fit best. If you can substitute teach in your area, it is a great opportunity to experience a variety of grade levels and subject areas. It'll also give you a preview of the ""edge of chaos"" where classrooms tend to exist."

I agree that that's unfair. It's also unfair for your class when they do lie.

She would raise her hand for a question and would say something just absurd - but funny - and the class would eat it up.  So I stopped calling on her.  I stopped LOOKING at her.  For six weeks she basically didn't exist in my classroom.  She stopped raising her hand and saying absurd things.  At the end of that six weeks I took her to the side and talked to her.  I told her that it was hard for me to ignore her and that I wanted her participation in class but I can't have her distracting the entire class.  I had to choose one student or the rest of the students.  And I think I'm not doing my job if I let one student ruin the entire class.  So my suggestion is to not call on that student for a very long time.  If the parents get involved and ask why little Johnny isn't being called on I would simply say that the child disrupts the entire class every time.  Again, you're picking the education of all of the other students over this student - if it's truly that disruptive.  My bet is that the child will come around and start contributing positively when he/she sees that the class can go on without him.  It's a tough thing to do and goes against what you are normally taught in school (every child is important) but sometimes a ""how to behave in class"" lesson will do that child more help than harm.  Remember, you're not just teaching these kids curriculum; you are also preparing them for future success in school with their behavior.  You are the front line to my success."
Teachers,3d8x1b,yourlocalwerecat,3,Tue Jul 14 15:04:34 2015 UTC,I second this.  They're looking for attention and taking away from everyone else.
Teachers,3d8x1b,missbartleby,4,Tue Jul 14 15:34:26 2015 UTC,"These children would benefit from learning better strategies to get attention.  Also, lies can be dangerous.  Contact parents.  Document lies.  Refer to school counselor."
Teachers,3d8x1b,yourlocalwerecat,7,Tue Jul 14 15:29:10 2015 UTC,"Refer to school counselor.   I hadn't thought about this, but I agree: if this is both of them and consistent, it may be part of a bigger problem.  Definitely begin documenting what and when the stories are and share this information with your counselor."
Teachers,3d8x1b,monkeydave,2,Tue Jul 14 15:35:49 2015 UTC,"I would immediately answer with ""Interesting. Okay, who has an answer to my question?"""
Teachers,3d8x1b,shittyBOXER,2,Tue Jul 14 15:27:02 2015 UTC,"Lots of things going on here. First, You need management. The kids think it's okay to be off topic/disrespectful (minor disrespect, but it is intentional) because they can be off topic/disrespectful as evidenced by their regular comments. Not saying your class is out of control, but these kids are out of line.  They don't think you mean business. Tell them that it is not related and expect them to answer the damn questions by not passing them up. But before you do that, are they able to answer the question correctly eventually?  If they don't answer correctly, it could be because (most likely) they're not reading the story either because don't want to and can, obviously, get away with it or they can't read/comprehend the story.   Try a lower level story with the class and see how their participation goes and see how accurate their answers are, even if they still embellish their own stories within their answer."
Teachers,3d8x1b,KittyCatherine11,2,Tue Jul 14 15:37:00 2015 UTC,"I like the idea of going along with it and elaborating. You could also do a white board for students to write questions/comments on that aren't relevant at that moment.   Whenever they do it, just say you can't address it right now but they should go write it on the whiteboard.   Kids hate getting out of their seats (depending on the age), and while at first maybe they'll find it funny, it'll get old fast."
Teachers,3d8x1b,yourlocalwerecat,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:08:40 2015 UTC,"I know it doesn't feel fair, but just don't call on them.  They are not helping their understanding of the material nor their peers' understanding.  If there is less than a five percent chance that that they are asking a real question or making a real contribution, it's really better for the whole class.  It also tells them that you're serious about them actually attending to the lesson."
Teachers,3d8x1b,gimmefantastic,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:32:34 2015 UTC,I agree with people saying this.  Don't reward them with attention for their lies & stories and they'll be far more likely to stop.
Teachers,3d8x1b,Chuchoter,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:44:28 2015 UTC,"I had a kid that would make stories like that. Usually I'd ignore but at one point I stopped the entire lesson, turned to the kid, and said, ""Listen, I'm really tired of hearing these fake stories you're telling us. They're not funny, and you're distracting other people. So stop. Do you understand?""   Then move on with the lesson. When it's quiet work time, I'd check up on him. If he's still fidgety, I'd take him outside to talk. If he's quiet, I'd ask if he's alright, and if he is, then I let him work.  The kid was in grade 5. Tough love can help."

Teachers,3d8x1b,Hassan_Amir,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:07:46 2015 UTC,"After a student gives me two of those answers, I say something like, ""I have called on you twice and you've given me two silly answers. I want you to think about your answer next time. If you give me another silly answer, I won't be calling on you again."" I say it in front of the class then call on a few other students before coming back. If they give a silly answer, I follow through and don't call on them for the rest of the week. In a week or so, I'll ask if they are ready to give me a serious answer. Usually they are.  Unless you don't think they are actually able to separate truth from fantasy, in which case I would seek help from a counselor."
Teachers,3d8x1b,Art_Rat,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:21:34 2015 UTC,"I like a lot of the ideas posted here.  Depending on the situation and students you have a few options to pick from.  You may want to see how pervasive this is and ask previous teachers that these students have had if this is a continuing issue. If it is; definitely get the counselor and parents involved. In our school pervasive behaviors or issues students have are documented in the students file. The next teacher can see what measures were taken and how effective those measures were. That way we don't use measures that aren't effective and if some of the measures do work we can continue to use them or ask the specific teacher advice on the best ways to handle or curb that specific behavior in a particular student.  My issue with my student who lies (high school) is that they are always excuses for why they can't do work. Their mom goes in on these lies also. How do I know? Ex. Student told music teacher they did not have their instrument for class because it was in the shop.  Three weeks later when music teacher says, ""There is no way your instrument is still in the shop!"" The student then said it was stolen. Mom corroborated both the shop and stolen stories. After a month and a half of this B.S the music teacher brought the students into the office and pointed to  her instrument. ""You left your instrument in the lunchroom almost two months ago. Still think it was in the shop? Let's try this again.""  He leaves any instrument that is left around the school in his office. That way students have to come to him and come clean that they left their instrument somewhere they shouldn't have and are checking to see if it made its way back to his room. So he knows how long it has been there. Still Mom says she did have it and that it was in the shop and that it hadn't been 7 weeks since it was ""lost"" and that they truly thought it was stolen.   Those same weak stupid excuses on the day of due dates were used on me all last year. Granted I knew Dad was going through some drug rehab. That's fine. Things a rough. Doesn't mean you help your student lie to get out of work they need to do. The student is dumb as rocks and thinks they are so smart and know what they are doing, but they can't even track due dates that they are given four months in advanced and reminded about EVERY WEEK until the due date!  What do you do in THESE situations? Where parents lie right along with students to back their student's up?  P.S I believe a lot of the lies the student tells me in class they relay via text message to their parent so that when I call or e-mail they back up these stupid claims."
Teachers,3d8x1b,scigeek1701,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:22:59 2015 UTC,"When you call on them ask them straight out if their answer relates to the question being asked. If they say no, then tell them that they can tell you their story after class. If they say yes, but continue to be off topic then you can either 1) stop calling on them or 2) repeat the question and ask that they stay focused. I had a student who would do stuff like this. He would answer honestly that his answer was off topic. Or if he asked it anyway I would tell him that he and I could discuss his thoughts after class. Unsurprisingly he never came to talk to me about his off-topic question. He knew what he was doing and so did the other students. There is no need to ignore that everyone knows the students motivations."

Does your boyfriend have his statement of eligibility for the temporary certification? If he has that, everything is fine. He will be issued a temporary teaching certificate as soon as he starts teaching and then be given time to pass these tests to earn his professional certification. I don't think the school will react poorly if he has a temporary certification and is working to complete all requirements."

He will then have 3 years to take 6 classes, pass the general knowledge exam, and pass the professional test."

I would let John Green handle the lectures and use class time for Socratic seminar and supplemental reading/reading strategy instruction. It would be easier for you to find lessons on close reading, for which you can use any text you want, than to find World History specific lessons.  Similarly look for some engaging writing projects (in general) and then adapt them so students are writing about World History. The Literacy Design Collaborative is a place to start."

Syracuse University's tough to get into and expensive but has a good program.  If you really want the big city I'd check out City University of New York or CUNY.  Queens College is in Flushing which is Queens and not Manhattan but has a good rep albeit a bit tough to get into.  CUNY Hunter has about a 20% acceptance rate but is right on Park Avenue in Manhattan.  State University of New York, or SUNY, has good schools.  I went to SUNY Geneseo which has a GREAT program but is a small rural town like you said but there's a ton going on since it's a college town.  Try Buffalo State College.  It's a part of the SUNY system, tuition is $16,000 for out of state but is right in the middle of a nice part of the city of Buffalo.  My Mom went there for her elementary ed degree and has taught for 39 years.  The school used to be called State Teachers College actually.  It's a smaller school and a bit older.  If you want a big university than University of Buffalo is your best chance although their out of state tuition is about $20,000 a year which is asinine."

My dad told me to go to a trade school and give up my dream of college.   What you're looking for in a college depends on you as a person:   Do you want a small school (most of the SUNYS are between 5,000-7,000 enrollment, which is considered a smaller school)? Or would you like a big school (UB is pushing 20,000 students - it's the biggest SUNY)?  Do you want to be in a city or somewhere more rural? That will make a huge impact on your student teaching placements as well. Do you want to live where you go to school? Meaning, do you want to move there to the town?  What kind of environment do you want to be in? Some schools have a party school reputation, some schools have a serious reputation. Check out social media platforms administered by the schools or hashtags (#fredonia, etc.). That will give you a starting idea of what schools are like. What level of education do you want to study? I've heard nothing but good things about SUNY ED programs, but there are some specialties. For example, Fredonia is top dog for Childhood/Early Childhood (grades 1-6/birth-6). Buff State is well-known for adolescent education (grades 7-12). How intensive do you want your program? I can't say this is 100% true, maybe someone else can weigh in, but I heard that SUNY Brockport doesn't start in-classroom placements until junior year. Fredonia puts you in a classroom 2x/week with a teaching partner in your first semester.    If you're serious about going into teaching, start researching the various school's websites and their Ed programs. Their websites will give you a comparative view of the programs and they usually have quotes from alumni or professors. They'll also tell you the path to certification and how their program prepares you. For what it's worth, I felt very prepared to take my certification exams after completing a four year degree at Fredonia.

Two clarifying questions for A though:    How long will the position last? (I've completed maternity leaves that were only two months, but I've seen teachers take year-long LoA's as well) Did they give you a deadline for putting your name on the dotted line?   If you can hold them off for a bit, you can at least see if B will bring you around for a second interview.

Teachers,3d4tsr,bruceleeroy109,43,Mon Jul 13 15:10:12 2015 UTC,"Get your classroom set up in an organized manner:  Have a place where homework is turned in and have a place for each class period so papers are organized. I use white plastic drawers with each drawer labeled with the class period. All students turn in papers, tests, quizzes, etc to the drawers. It gets pulled out and graded so if there's the ""but I turned it in argument"" I can reply ""it wasn't in the box."" (Also tell them to look for it in their binder - chances are they didn't turn in the assignment).  Have a place where extra papers or handouts are placed (I always make extra copies of handout or assignments because teenagers lose stuff) - I do this by having a crate with folders with the date written on the folder tab. When students are absent they know to look in the folder for the work they missed. I also added a clipboard to it that summed up what we did that day and any announcements that were made (test/quiz dates). It's a little extra work you do at the end of the school day that will save you time. And when a student asks for another copy you just point to the crate and you don't have to dig up another copy. I've also shared it with my ESL and SPED teachers so if they need to get another copy without having to interrupt my class or bug me.  Another teacher I knew would laminate a large calendar (like one would use in an elementary school classroom) and wrote with a wipe-off marker what they did that day and students were expected to check that rather than asking ""did we do anything yesterday? I was gone.""  Document anything that may come back to bite you. I do this with email. I rarely call parents - although there are times when a quick phone call clears up the situation faster. A quick email to mom and dad, a case manager, or another teacher is a great way to have things on record. It also shows that you are proactive and communicate well. Don't be scared of the parents - I use to be terrified of contacting parents, but I use the approach of ""I want to work as a team to help your child get the best education possible"" and they respond to that really well.  Keep written attendance (and a written grade book) and take attendance using seating charts - and you get to decide where they sit. This helps your socially anxious students the first day and all creates a built-in privilege: In reality I don't care where my students sit and I don't care if my ADHD kid sits on the floor, but if I give the illusion I do then when they need a motivator I can throw out a ""sit anywhere in class pass."" A seating chart will help you learn their names which takes me about six weeks. Even then I still suck with names.  Simple classroom procedures like these will make things smooth. I have a few more but some of it depends on your department set up and policies.  Realize that you may be assigned a mentor teacher who may not be a good mentor. Mine had only been teaching for a few years. Find someone who you can go to with questions that you trust - a teacher who has not lost their passion for teaching and has experience. This person may not come apparent to you for a month or so, but they will be your life saver.  Also realize that your first year is always the worst. You don't know how to use the gradebook, take attendance, or even where the bathroom is in the school! It's very overwhelming and you'll have a billion questions. You also will not know what HAS to be done right away and what can be blown off - just realize it takes time to figure that out and every teacher has been where you are. It's all easier after the first year, but make your second year easy by documenting your lessons plans (make notes that afternoon of what worked and what didn't so you don't repeat the same crummy lessons).   Treat your support staff like they walk on water that way when you forget to turn in paperwork for an ARD meeting that day they are forgiving. They are also more likely to make sure their students do well in your class or help you when you have a problem with one of their students. These teachers are some of the most important because they often have the ear of admin, they know pretty much everyone in the school, and they are some of the most passionate people I know in education.  Other teachers will tell you not to eat lunch in the teacher's lounge because it'll jade you quicker because of all the bitching. I disagree to a degree. I eat lunch in the teacher's lounge to listen and ask a few questions. Listen and get a feel for the social dynamics. Be nice to everyone because you never know when you'll need a favor (""Mr. Smith, I see you are watching a movie in English today, can I borrow Jimmy during your class to get him caught up on material he missed?"" they're more likely to see you a friend and say yes). I always sympathize with the bitching to gain trust, but I do not bitch. It doesn't solve any of my problems and exposes weaknesses. Instead of complaining about a student I may tell a funny story about them or if I'm having a problem with the student I may ask the other students ""how is so-and-so in your class?"" but I don't offer up detail. Sometimes you'll get insider info about the students that brings a greater understanding to the situation. Also, go to happy hours if you are invited. You'll get to know the people you work with better. You don't have to be friends with them, but be friendly.  Having taught freshman they usually and good first semester and then cocky second semester. Juniors will be stressed out and seniors will be checked out.  The first day have a getting to know you activity. I have them write down info about them on an index card. The questions vary from ""where were you born"" to ""what's something no one else knows about you that you can share with the class and is school appropriate."" Then I read them aloud to the class (pending their approval) the last few minutes of class each day that week. It allows you to get to know them and their peers to get to know them as well. I often times will only read funny or interesting things off of them or if I see they have something in common with me/another student. In turn tell the students about yourself, but keep it to stuff you only want them to know - they don't need your life story or personal secrets. They just want to know you are human and relate to you. Show a picture of yourself when you were their age! They get a kick out of that. I actually found my old report card and posted it - they loved it.  I also recommend getting a copy of ""The First Days of School"" by Dr. Harry Wong. Good stuff for all grade levels there.  Feel free to ask questions. I could probably come up with a few more things, but they'll come to me later. Best of luck and welcome to the profession!"

Teachers,3d4tsr,LovePugs,3,Mon Jul 13 23:57:55 2015 UTC,Please do! I believe teachers should share their ideas with each other all the time.

Teachers,3d4tsr,LadyFoxbriar,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:27:05 2015 UTC,"seriously, mods: this needs to be stickied.  what do I have to add? Sheesh, what else is there? However:   Take care of yourself. If you can have a fridge in your room, stock it with stuff that will keep you healthy. Cold-packs on your neck or back can be great at the end of the day. No, kids cannot store their lunch in it. I am famous for giving string cheese or other goodies to kids who need it to get through a tough day. Buy good shoes! Buy good insoles, I like the Softsoles that you bake in the oven to fit to your feet. I have two sofas in the back of my room, mostly for me and my back at the end of the day. They also make great 'reward seating' for kids who are doing well. Store some big premoistened wipes and a full change of clothing. Stuff happens, kids get sick, pants rip, coffee spills. Also a good idea to keep around: dollar bills, extra extra glasses or contacts, a flashlight, a simple first aid kit (don't try to take care of anything too serious, send the kid to the nurse) and a camera for when funny or weird things happen. Yeah, it's illegal to take pictures of the kids, sure- but if there's an accident or fight, just holding the camera seems to focus attention. Bathroom tickets! Each kid gets 4 tickets for the semester. They can earn more and they count for extra credit at the end if they don't use them, but the main benefit is that I don't have to keep track of how often the kid goes to the bathroom. I get them at Walmart and I note the brand and starting ticket number; other teachers are doing this now and kids will try to use their tickets (or the ones they bought on their own!) in my class.   And now, the thing i'm most serious about for new teachers...   Eliminate sarcasm in your classroom. I've said this many times and other teachers will say 'but it's fun' or 'it's harmless'...Really? You think saying the opposite of what you mean is fun? Understatement, exaggeration, irony = all great, have at it. But using sarcasm to belittle and insult while hiding behind a veneer of politesse? No. Never. My rules say ""Sarcasm is the coward's road."" If I am the one person in a student's life who says what he means and means what he says, so be it."

Teachers,3d4tsr,brade123,23,Mon Jul 13 22:32:20 2015 UTC,"Personal Recommendation: Learn to take at least one night completely off from the job. No grading, no stressing about the next day's lessons, just do something fun for yourself. Also, try to get out of school right after the last bell rings once a week."
Teachers,3d4tsr,aereuske,5,Mon Jul 13 17:49:38 2015 UTC,"I heavily second this. Mentally, it is so important to take breaks. I remember feeling sometimes after spending too much time with the students that I was beginning to think and feel a little too much like them, haha."
Teachers,3d4tsr,MordorFires,4,Mon Jul 13 22:51:15 2015 UTC,"Adding onto this, give yourself a weekend. Every other weekend, I would spend a day putting together the basics for my lesson plans for that two week period. When I first started, it would take all day. I had three preps to cover. One prep had zero curriculum provided (it was an elective writing class) and the only other teacher for it was less than helpful with sharing. So, I spent a full day on Saturday or Sunday (once every two weeks) researching and planning. It helps.  As the year progressed, you'll find yourself needing less time devoted to this. Finding the info you need becomes easier and faster. Best thing you can do right now is really look at the State Standards. Some states (thanks to Common Core) even break down what the expectation/focus will be for each quarter."
Teachers,3d4tsr,whistlar,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:46:53 2015 UTC,"Oh, and get a firm understanding from your peers on what the expectation is for PARCC or FSA. It sneaks up on you.

You can become less strict later in the year, but it's fucking hard for the kids to take you seriously if you start easy then try to become strict( I am speaking from my mistakes).You are there to be their teacher, not their friend. That doesn't mean you can't be friendly and have fun in the class. When the class is doing group work  I often will be talking with a group of students and joking, then suddenly turn to another group who is messing around and go all Jekl and Hyde on their asses scolding them and then go back to the other group with a smile like it never happened."
Teachers,3d4tsr,tabinsur,10,Mon Jul 13 18:08:48 2015 UTC,"One thing that worked for me is to get most/all of your prep/paperwork/etc done in the morning, BEFORE school starts.  Yes, this means you'll have to wake up early, and then get to school an hour or two before classes start, but when you do stuff before school,  1)  You'll be fresher for the most part, instead of waiting after school when you might be tired/frazzled/etc.  2)  It's dark, quiet, and just overall easier to get work done.  3)  It'll enable you on most days to leave pretty much right after the bell rings.  I'm not even a morning person, and I've found that I'm a lot more productive before school than after."
Teachers,3d4tsr,mathteacher123,6,Mon Jul 13 20:15:59 2015 UTC,"Yes this is long. But I promise, it is stuff I wished I knew my first year teaching. No, there is no tl;dr. You can read quicker than I spent typing this.   I actually just finished my first year teaching! I taught 9th and 11th grade so I feel I can give plenty of advice on this. First of all, I absolutely love my school and am grateful to be part of it.  Ladyfoxbriar has already made a lot of good points but I'll try to add to it.  1) I'm putting this first because I believe it was the most important thing I did that made me stand out as a teacher. Notice the positives in a student and let parents/guardians know!! They absolutely love it. Seriously, parents are so used to only being contacted about mistakes their child makes, they are ecstatic to hear good news. I especially made sure to do this with students that don't generally perform well, but try hard. Or if I have a troublesome student, giving their parents positive feedback about them can have a huge impact on their behavior in your class. It seriously will take you ~2 minutes/email and can make a huge difference. I usually try to send 5-10 of these a week. Please, if you take any advice from me, it's this.  Also, one thing to add to this. If you can't do personalized emails due to time constraints, I send a mass email at the end of every unit with a progress report. Just explain the upcoming unit, attached a progress report showing project/exam grades, and what the class is doing. Even this I have probably 10 percent of parents email me, thanking me for the updates. Takes about 5 minutes and reaches every parent.  Oh, and by the way, I had multiple parents email either my principal or the superintendent because of this. If you want to get rehired, I can guarantee this helps.  2) Have fun with students. Now, I'm lucky that my students are already pretty well behaved, but I will say that keeps students ebgaged/entertained has been my go to for classroom management. If they're bored, that's when they are more likely to act out or play games. Keep them involved in the learning. Use different strategies. Give them silent work time, then partner discussion, then lecture, then an activity, then a break then lecture, etc. Careful of transition time though. Half the battle with 9th graders is maintaining engagement.  One thing my students commended me for is recognizing that they need mental breaks. Hell, picture when you were in college or attend meetings. Can you sit and listen intently for 30+ minutes? Probably not. Depending on the length of your classes (mine are 90 minute blocks) give them 3-4 minutes to take a break/text and encourage them to stand up and move. I know you feel you have so much to cover and so little time, but there is no point powering through the material if students aren't focused and learning.  3) You'll be stressed. For sure. I was working 55+ hour weeks, and I'm at a great school with a solid curriculum. Even with the curriculum built, I was reviewing materials, figuring out what we did what did, remembering what to do when, taking attendance, grading, emailing, staff meetings, new teacher meetings, plc stuff, modifying material to my teaching style, and trying to remember all the little things that apply to each student, etc. It's a lot. By March I was down to 45-50 hours. But this upcoming year, I bet I'll be down to 45 hours pretty easily. Do what the others say. I know it seems hard, and I didn't do this enough, but take time for yourself. It's crucial.  4) EACH STUDENT IS DIFFERENT. Please remember this. It is too easy to start seeing students as just part of the class. That should never be the case.  See that quiet student? Talk to them when they come in. Actually ask how their weekend was. Carry on the conversation. Then, and most importantly to show you care, follow up another day. Show you remember them. The students with ADHD/IEP? Ask parents what helps the student. Ask the para/case manager what works best for the student. Most important, ask the student what they prefer. They are probably tired of everyone telling them what to do. If you ask them what they want, they will respect you and this can really benefit their education. If they have trouble reading, make sure to read slides out loud to the class. If they are hearing impaired, they may want to sit up front. If they have trouble focusing for extended periods of time, allow them to get up and get a drink of water to regain focus. But seriously, ask them. If the student is on an IEP, be prepared to give them modified assignments. In my experience, their learning disability is not that they are dumb! Seriously, don't assume that. Often times, their biggest struggle is understanding the question. Make the questions concise. Draw pictures to help them understand. But the biggest thing is, guide them. Don't give answers. Guide them to it, they're still there to learn.  You are impacting every student. No. Matter. What. If a student comes in, says nothing, and leaves, every day. You are still impacting them. I had students that wouldn't talk to me no matter how much I tried. Maybe they're shy, embarrassed, or just don't like talking. Who cares, it's their choice. Guess what, I had two students like that they came up and gave me cards saying I was their favorite teacher. Even if they can't accept that you are outgoing to them, they may still appreciate it. Always try to reach every student.  If you hear a student being bullied, you better fucking intervene. Don't play stupid and let the bully off the hook. They know what they did and so do you. Every bullying situation I've encountered they try playing the innocent card. Bullshit. Call them out. Call parents. I tell my class I have a zero tolerance policy on day one. They know better by this age, and it's more common than you think. I guarantee it. Think back to your 9th grade class. You know bullying is there and that hasn't changed. Remember, I'm in what's considered one of the best high school in my state and believe me, bullying is still common here. Be aware of it. If you witness it, stop it immediately. Ask the 'victim' (in private to prevent further social embarrassment) what they would like you to do. Student really value you asking their input.   ** Some students come from bad families!! I have typed numerous papers in my masters program about this topic so this is very summarized and is more just giving examples. You need to accept this. I am in a predominantly white, privileged public school and guess what, we have students come from low income or just bad families. You have to accept this. They will always exist. Reach out to these students. Get to know them and if they'll open up, know their home lives. Don't get mad because they didn't do their homework. Guess what, their parents may have to work night shifts just to get by. If it's always been the way, how many kids would choose homework over video games? It's hard for the parent and the student. Or it may help to realise that that student social life is impacted from being low income. They can't afford to do what they're classmates can. I bet over 50 percent of my school left our community over spring break. Guess who is left behind, the low income students. How does this impact the way you teach? Don't ask where everyone went for spring break. Some students can afford to go anywhere. It also makes you a better teacher by simply being aware of all situations that students are in. Being well-rounded is huge.   5) You're young (assuming because of your first year) . Everyone will tell you that students may not respect you because of this. While this may be true, it didn't affect my teaching. In fact, I think it made it better. I can relate to my students video games, music, books, movies, and hobbies. Use that to your advantage. Tie it into the class. Take a few minutes every day to learn about student personally. They will have a better attitude toward you. Use this to make the class entertaining.  6) Conferences? Oh boy conferences. Don't be afraid. You'll survive and they go surprisingly quick. A couple of things with conference night.  A. My conferences are scheduled in 10 minute blocks. This allows me to know which parents are coming. Make sure to have personal anecdotes about their student ready to go. Examples of them in class as a student, and as a person. Parents will love it. If you have scheduled conferences, have something else prepared to give to them because even if the conference takes 3 minutes, they will stay for all 10. Talk about school plays, or extra curricular the student could take part in.  B. The parents you want to come (low performing student and students with behavior problems) are the ones that will more than likely NOT come. I would say that 75 percent of parents that do come are the ones whose child has straight A's. Guess what, there is a reason. Involved parents = good students. Not always, but often. This doesn't mean that bad parents = bad students. But there is a definite correlation.  C. Dress professionally. You look young. Parents are okay with this. Don't be afraid to show them why you're a good teacher. You have fresh ideas and a lot of energy. That's what is needed for 9th graders. Smile, be polite, and you can be personal with them. Talks sports, ask what they do. You know they are judging you. It's okay. You're a teacher. You're getting judged all day, every day. Which brings me to my next point."
Teachers,3d4tsr,eggowaffles,5,Mon Jul 13 23:52:51 2015 UTC,"7) You're getting judged, all day, every day. Students will make fun of you. They will say mean things. You'll make mistakes and they will laugh. Guess what, you'll laugh too. It's funny. If you get mad, it's funnier to them. If you join in and laugh, it's funnier to both of you. They know everyone makes mistakes, don't take it personally.  You're also being judged in a good way. Students will like you. They'll make jokes. They'll show you how care, compassionate, and important your job is. Embrace it. Give back to them. Tell them how much you appreciate them acknowledging you and you make sure to acknowledge them. They are what makes this job amazing. Focus on the positives. If you dwell on the negatives they will eat you alive. I don't remember most the embarrassing things that I did because I turned them into funny moments that we laughed about in my class. They are just mixed in with all of the other good times we had."

Lots of times new teachers are asked to help with lots of things, and it's ok to say no (politely). I learned that very quickly my first year because they asked me to basically stay til 5:30 every night without pay to watch students, complete paperwork for the entire English department, and chaperone tons of events. While I was glad to help occasionally, it's important to have a life and make sure you're able to recharge."

Calendar to embed in the website. So easy to set up! Saves so much time on giving make up work. Add assignments for each day, you can even add or modify it using your smart phone. Upload assignments to drive for students who are absent and put link on calendar. No more ""can I get make up work.."" They can even access it on their phones.   1st week- have all students make a folder with their name. Organize folders alphabetically in crates separated by class period using hanging folders. File back graded work rather then pass it back. Saves so much time especially if you have student aides to file for you."

Teachers,3d70vu,PeanutButterOwl,14,Tue Jul 14 00:45:58 2015 UTC,"I get how you feel; I used to think the same way. But! Being titled gives you the professional distinction you need to set you apart from the students. You are not their friend, hence they should call you by a professional name. Unfortunately, there aren't many options. I opted for ""Ms"" as it doesn't exactly give away my age; to me, ""Miss"" feels girlish and young.  It took me a couple months to become used to going by ""Ms last name"", but I warmed up to it by giving the kids the option of calling me ""Ms First letter of last name"". You could go by Ms Nickname as well; something that you like being called that is still professional.   I would really hesitate at giving the kids the option of only calling you by your first name as for many it might open the door to a more relaxed (I.e. No consequences) classroom, in their mind. Again, they would start to see you as their friend instead of their teacher. It can be a fine line.   In a way, it gives the kids structure as it is something they are used to doing. They thrive off of structure, too. You will find many parents will even call you Ms. Last Name. It's respect for your position of authority, and a reminder of all the effort you put into your career and just how important your job is."
Teachers,3d70vu,Damon_Gant,6,Tue Jul 14 01:14:46 2015 UTC,"I agree with this.  My first year teaching a bunch of new teachers were going by Mr. or Ms. First Name, and I did that and I really, really regret it.  After I started working at a different school I've always gone by my last name now and tbh it is much better.  Like someone down there said, you'll get used to it."
Teachers,3d70vu,gimmefantastic,3,Tue Jul 14 03:20:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I understand the authority part of the title. I just am not crazy on Miss as it does sound girly, but Ms sounds too old to me.

Even if you have an easy to pronounce name, like ""Miss Green,"" it might give you the more casual feel you might be looking for to go by ""Miss G.""

But kids will still holler ""Miss!"" and you'll have to train yourself and them if you don't want to respond to that.  On a side note, a good way to keep yourself from being frazzled is to set up a non-verbal protocol that is the preferred way to ask for the teacher's attention, including an alternative to raising one's hand. (Some teachers use colored flags or stacks of cups on the desks.)  I had a classroom that had ""call lights"" at students' group-work stations and I loved it.

They put themselves on a pedestal and everyone else is just there to serve them. Sadly, support staff (classified) are usually looked down upon. This can include aids, secretaries, custodians, etc. Some teachers THINK they're actually above the support staff in terms of a traditional hierarchy of positions. But the reality is that the ONLY boss that exists in a school setting is the principal. Everyone else works under him/her.  This teacher sounds like a piece of shit as I've described. I've ran into people like that when I was support. Now that I'm a teacher, I try to remember not to act like that. I'd just avoid him at all cost, document everything, and if it becomes that unbearable, talk to your principal. I don't see how your position and his position would make you cross paths on regular occasions anyways.   Are  you unionized? Typically certificated (teachers) and classified (support) have their own separate unions. You can go that route and complain to a union rep."

Know that the transition from being a student to becoming a teacher (master) is not a magical, overnight occurrence.   My best lectures are about things I feel like I own because I've read about them and discussed them before. Maybe 20% of my research and scholarship makes its way into my lecture, but the confidence of the other 80% being in my mind makes it richer. All questions I ask, I've answered myself, in-depth. And I wouldn't stop researching and developing until I felt I had discovered something fascinating about the topic of research.  Also, I gained a lot of confidence by reading out loud, with author's intent and variety of voice as my focus points. The more I was able to read with passion and quote things from other sources, the more material I had to connect to other material, the better I was at speaking. The better I was at speaking, the more risks I took, and I became lively and interesting (at times) in front of students. (I believe the closest way to get to where a preacher is would be this route: read aloud a lot and speak from your heart, show vulnerability, show thought...)"

I taught ELD last year and their EDGE series is pretty fantastic. Not sure if there is any way for you to get a hold of it, but that had great grammar exercises.  In my day to day, I take student writing and work from there. If my students are having paragraph trouble, we work on that. Transition issues? We work on that. Comma crazy? Let's bust it out! If you search online for grammar lessons, you should find a ton.  I've found in interviews, if they do ask about grammar, they are more interested in how you approach it day to day. I suggest focusing on a skill like commas, parenthetical phrases, pronoun/antecedent agreement, and saying that you'll work in a few days a week where students correct a sentence or paragraph as a ""Do Now"" when they walk in the door. You can also put the grammar issues on a peer review of work, and ask students to find where and how a student uses a specific device."

I also agree with the Kohls recommendation, but be sure to shop with a coupon, as they are pretty overpriced otherwise.  Definitely look at TJ Maxx/Marshalls for shoes!  I'm not small by any means (wear an 18/2x), so I stick with what works for me, black pants and loose top.

My favorite work pants are from target; they are Merona modern fit ankle pants.  They look great with flats, are slimming, and have a bit of stretch. I have them in black, grey, khaki, and a bright hunter green. I also recently found some Worthington slim fit ankle pants that look great. For tops, I look for blouses that are loose but still structured. I have the best luck finding blouses  at Target, Loft, and Gap. (I only go in the pricier stores when they are having a sale and I have a coupon). And, of course, I pair everything with cardigans in solid colors from the same stores. I've found that buying a lot of black, grey, white, etc. tops and pants, and then colorful cardigans and scarves (Walmart and old Navy) allow for a lot of mixing and matching which stretches my wardrobe.   I think dresses work well because they are comfortable, but look like you put in effort. I'm short, but I don't buy petite just to be a little extra modest. I've found great dresses on sale at Loft and Banana Republic. Gap dresses can be too casual. Most Target dresses are on the younger/too trendy side, and some of them don't wash well. Sometimes I find dresses at department store clearance sales, but it's a lot of work to dig through. I have a black wrap dress from Kmart that I get tons of compliments on.   tldr: Target, LOFT, GAP, Banana Republic. Get on email lists so you will know about sales and get coupons.

Teachers,3d5nm8,Kiwikid14,2,Mon Jul 13 22:27:47 2015 UTC,"I am larger too, and love to be fashionable. You do not need to buy everything at once so go through your wardrobe and see what could be adapted for classroom use. You only need 5/6 outfits per season for work. For example, I had a denim skirt I pair with a simple shirt for work. I also have decent summer dresses I put leggings under for classroom modesty.  I have cotton tanks I wear under things and got a couple of very cheap shrugs which I wear as cardigans which make them look more formal. This will save you some money. Ask friends and family for their old clothes (if they will fit) and vouchers for a shop you like  for Christmases and your birthday. Might be a good place to get a decent work handbag etc as well. I used my mums very old leather one for years.   I would go for slightly more formal than dickies for trousers, but comfy nice trousers or generously cut skirt with a non t-shirt top and blazer/cardigan with sneaker look but slightly dressier shoes (very comfy) works for almost all levels and classrooms.  Get the fit and cut right as the wrong size or cut makes us look sloppy and bigger. Worse- too big gapes when you are active with students.  cover  your bits and do the bend test- pretend you are bending over a desk and check for cleavage. We all have that top we loved for work and can't wear without a top underneath....   I am now losing weight so am keen on a minimal work uniform idea, but it must have a bit of my personality in it so I feel comfortable. Wish I could just buy it all at one shop but I cant. I quite like ASOS online  as it ships and their sales stuff is nicely cut and wears well. When I started, lane Bryant was good but the quality and sales don't appear to be any more. I think you just have to shop around and don't forget online sales and consignment stores, as well as seconds and factory outlets. Amazing what you can find for very little if you are a bit creative.   Edit- also find one tidy PE/trip/active outfit. You will need it."

Teachers,3d511y,rtl_995,5,Mon Jul 13 16:04:35 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry, but that sounds like a pretty boring first day. And I'm sure the students will be getting that from all of their teachers. How about doing a fun activity the first day to get to know the students? Your priority should be getting to know them. You could also have an activity where you can demonstrate expectations while doing the activity without it being boring. Maybe give them the syllabus to bring home and review on their own and come back with questions."

Teachers,3d511y,TooMuchButtHair,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:58:53 2015 UTC,"Perhaps, but they're in high school and should be learning to do things on their own. Plus they are probably going to zone out when lecturing to them about it too. However, you could: 1. Make it a game the next day and give prizes (candy, etc.) for correct answers. 2. Go over specific information in the syllabus as they come up in class and are relevant. I also suggest sending the syllabus in a welcome email to parents if you have access to email addresses."
Teachers,3d511y,wish_upon_a_star,4,Tue Jul 14 17:07:42 2015 UTC,"Because you have 90 minutes and a older age group maybe have students come up with rules and procedures and then discuss and vote on them as a group? Maybe talk about rules of how to conduct class discussions or what students are expected to do while others are talking. Frame it as a ""What do you want this class to look like"" sort of thing. I'm sure that would eat a good about of time and give the students a little ownership of the rules."
Teachers,3d511y,I_Am_A_Teacher,3,Mon Jul 13 16:38:15 2015 UTC,"I did this last year with my 8th graders and they really engaged in it. I had them work in small groups to write down a great classroom sounds like (words of encouragement, no blaming, quiet but not silent) and looks like (people helping each other, everyone brought supplies, etc) and then turn those perceptions into positively-phrased rules.   After each group had created some rules, I posted them on the wall and gave each student 3 stickers. Students then put stickers on the rules that resonated the most with them. By the time they had completed this whole activity, the period was over. I took down all the rules and discarded ones that had few stickers, combined ones with similar meanings, and re-posted the winners at the beginning of the next class. They had come up with three over-arching themes that we boiled down into specific expectations and we discussed how to demonstrate each one. Afterward, I made posters and posted them in the classroom. Throughout the rest of the year, students referred back to the expectations to give feedback to their classmates. Super successful and a great intro to the sort of problem-solving and teamwork that I expect in my class discussions."
Teachers,3d511y,psuklinkie,2,Mon Jul 13 20:51:44 2015 UTC,"Great things said here already. A few things in addition to rules and procedures: Have a seating chart and written activity ready for them when they walk in the door. It'll kill some time having them find their seats. Then while you are taking attendance they are working on a written activity. I'd choose a getting to know you activity. It can be bingo type game (""find someone who likes the same food you do"" and they sign the line), or fill out a survey about themselves -- there's tons of ideas out there.  For high schoolers I would have a hand out that outlines all the policies and procedures and then post a copy of it to your website. If they should ever have questions about the course direct them to your website or their handout.  While I think getting the students involved in policy making may sound like a good idea I find that this age group may see that as them getting power rather than ownership. You are the teacher, you make the rules. They need clear expectations and they want structure. 10th graders can get really cocky and go on power trips. It might be a better idea with younger kiddos.  I tend to cover procedures a little more heavily than rules because I find a well run classroom takes care of some of the behavioral issues. The first few days I am a harsher teacher because I find it's easier to lighten up than it is to come down hard on them later on.  I think you will find your students better behaved where you are now. Do you need ideas of rules? You can always check with your department chair or we can give you specific ideas."
Teachers,3d511y,LadyFoxbriar,2,Mon Jul 13 16:58:38 2015 UTC,"My plan (teaching high school) for this year is to give out my syllabus and lab safety information [Chemistry]. I will spend 10-15 minutes covering both of those and talking about the procedures in general (website, textbooks, etc).  I DO NOT read directly from anything. That is incredibly boring. I really only explicitly talk about the rules and the grading. Since I am in a lab room I cannot let them create their own rules--I have to take the dangers into account and they may not know how to do that.  Afterwards, I answer any questions that they have (this is usually only 2-3 minutes because they don't really have any or want to speak up on the first day).  At that point I'm going to give them a personality test (the four temperaments). There will be butcher paper on the wall labeled with one of the four temperaments and they write their name on the correct one. We'll talk about this a little bit--what each one means and so on, but I want to keep it around 30-40 minutes.  The rest of the time I'll have them get into groups (size depending on the class size) and ask them to build the tallest structure using soft jellybeans and spaghetti. They can do whatever they want to with the materials...just build the tallest. And they will have 8 minutes to do it.  This is fun for everyone and it allows me to observe the group dynamics. Who will lead and who will follow? If it's all followers then how will that work out?  The extra time (90 minute block) is there for ""just-in-casies"". I get the feeling that the first day blocks are going to be cut about 10 minutes short and I can always fill-in with another activity. I'll have index cards ready for them to create with their information (name, clubs/sports, music interests, etc).  I try to fill up the day completely, but also to change it up. I know a lot of teachers are probably doing the same because they think everyone else is just reading from the syllabus with a blank stare. In my experience, that doesn't happen often at all anymore."
Teachers,3d511y,leeshis0019,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:06:37 2015 UTC,I like your spaghetti and jellybean idea. I am also a fan of giving personality tests. Do you use a specific test or just explain the temperaments and have them choose where they fall?
Teachers,3d511y,wish_upon_a_star,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:10:54 2015 UTC,"Sorry...havent been paying attention to reddit.  I have a specific test that I give them, but for whatever reason I can't find it anymore. It must be in a binder at school.  I really only use the results as a starting off point to get a discussion going. I don't want the students to get the impression that I find the test scientifically valid, but it's a good way to start relating to the students.  Also, it really does hit the nail on the proverbial head sometimes. It can be a fun way to create groups. Get all the phlegmatics together, etc. When I have my students create an index card for themselves this is one thing they have to put on it.   When they do the spaghetti and jellybeans activity I try to determine who the ""Leaders"", ""Engineers"", ""Manufacturers"" and ""Loners"" are and I put that on index card as well. Except I don't call them ""Loners""...I use a word that has completely slipped my mind as I type this. The ones that don't really do any work or care for the competition."

The next day, I'll  cover more rules and procedures, and then do another small activity (the activities are going to center around getting their interactive binders started.)

I also have them write what each of my rules look like in the classroom. It takes me about 50 minutes to get through.  As students enter the room on the first day, I hand them a 3x5 index card and ask them to come in and find their seat on the seating chart (which is projected onto a screen). I say, ""welcome to my class. You're going to learn a lot about the class, the rules, the procedures, and me today, but first I want to learn something about you. Please put your name on the middle of this index card, and tell me three things about yourself socially, 3 things about yourself academically (I give examples for these things), and what after school programs or sports you participate in. I give them 5 minutes to work on that and then we practice handing things in.  After that, I pass out the rules and procedures paper and we go through the power point. I read some, and I call on students (pulling the cards at random) to read other portions. All-in-all, it's a good first day activity."

I work in a small school, so I'm on at least 2 committees, sponsoring a student publication, department head, serving as an advisor, AND teaching a full load. Each year I choose to focus on a specific aspect of my load, rather than try to overhaul everything every year. Last year I focused on sophomore Language Arts.   By ""focus on,"" I mean really dig in and try to improve actively. I'm a perfectionist. I don't half ass things, but if I tried to completely full-ass everything, I'd be burnt out."

Make sure you convey that you're interested in working with students. It's amazing how many people won't mention their interest in working with kids at all in an interview."

What are other opportunities for faculty, etc...)  2) Answer questions with specific examples-- anecdotes are preferable (especially if you have experience with students).  3) Send a thank-you letter after the interview. Make it personal and relevant to the topics/questions discussed.  Best of luck."

Teachers,3d23vj,beetsbattlestar,19,Sun Jul 12 23:59:38 2015 UTC,"Sure. Try as I might, I cannot find the original post, so I'll summarize:  I do not have a teaching degree. I finished 30 hours of Early Childhood Education credits and with about a year and a half to go, I switched majors to graduate earlier.   I had a year of part-time teaching experience at a small Christian school and I liked it so much, I thought I would apply for a teaching job at a local charter school. It was billed as a part-time teaching job. Three classes per day. It didn't seem like it would be so bad, right? :)  I had almost zero experience with teenagers and my students ranged from ages 14-18. About 20 students per class.   The school had never had a music program before. And my classroom had no electrical outlets. Or books. Or sheet music. Or piano. They used to have a nice piano, but the kids broke it the year before.  The dean wanted me to produce an award-winning choir and he wanted our first performance to be 4 weeks after the school year started.  So, here's the formula:  An inexperienced teacher + high expectations - resources = the perfect shitstorm  All I can say is I tried really, really hard, but it wasn't enough. I met with our dean several times a week to discuss strategies for classroom management, but I was not doing well. I cried a lot. Probably 3 days per week I was crying in the teacher's lounge. My students fell into 2 camps: The ones who openly disrespected me and the ones who felt sorry for me.   Every waking moment was spent lesson planning. From early in the morning til late at night. It took me forever to put together 50 minutes of activities per class every day. I had to teach an instrumental music class with 20 students with one battery-operated keyboard. No curriculum. Nothing.   The only thing I was proud of through this whole ordeal was my creativity in making something out of nothing. As a class, we made our own tuned Boomwhackers out of fluorescent lighting tubing from Home Depot. The kids did all the work. I tested them against the store-bought ones and they sounded exactly the same. And my students learned to play them as a group. It was my crowning achievement.   I was hemorrhaging money from the part-time pay and buying my own supplies. I worked in the lunch room as a cashier and subbed in the afternoons, but even with no debt or kids of my own, I was still draining my savings to pay my bills. One day I was driving down the road and I realized that I would be completely broke by Christmas and I had to pull over because I was crying so hard.  I met with my principal and told her I was approaching burnout and I needed a curriculum. I also told her I needed more money. I didn't get either, although she did offer me an additional job that would net me about $200/mo.   I don't like to talk about this next part, because it's dark and frightening, but it happened, and it's part of the story. Mentally, I was breaking down. I was forgetting a lot more than I used to. I was spacing out more. I was fantasizing about beating a certain student in the face with a pipe and hearing her bones break. I was so, so angry. Sometimes by the end of 3rd period, my heart would be racing and my hands would be shaking. I was in ""emergency mode"" all the time.  My superintendent and principal told me that if I quit, they would ""take legal action"" against me for breaking contract. I asked several times to see my contract, but both HR and my principal kept saying they didn't know where it was.   So, on Halloween, when I was supposed to be doing Parent-teacher conferences, I was at the doctor crying, telling him my mental health was in the shitter, and he wrote my school a letter recommending that I find another line of work.  When I went back to school Monday, I had a panic attack before classes started and the school counselors recommended I just go home and never come back. So, after cleaning out my room and getting my grade book updated, that's what I did.  It was a dark time in my life, but it's over now and I'm mostly recovered."
Teachers,3d23vj,03290329,15,Mon Jul 13 01:48:24 2015 UTC,"Sigh. Not everyone's cut out to be a teacher. I studies FOUR years to be  teacher, and I had two degrees beforehand. I spent eight months under the direct supervision of a cooperating teacher before graduating.  Even with this preparation, many in the profession do not succeed. You were set up to fail. Your employers should be criminally culpable for your health conditions.  I'm guessing you just want to move on with your life.  Happy trails."
Teachers,3d23vj,TeacherTotodile,6,Mon Jul 13 03:17:26 2015 UTC,"Thanks for not judging me. :)   Customer service is easier than teaching because when I have an irate customer, our interaction lasts maybe 10 minutes and I never see them again. With teaching, your irate student will be right in front of you for an hour every day for most of a year."
Teachers,3d23vj,TeacherTotodile,12,Mon Jul 13 04:09:07 2015 UTC,"I see quite a few people commenting 'You just weren't cut out to be a teacher' but to be fair to you, the school gave you a hard time. Like you said, you had to create something out of nothing and the school failed to support you and your teaching. I feel if you were in a more supportive school you would have been able to stay there. You didn't fail, you were failed by the school. A lot of people who are teachers now wouldn't be able to do what you do. You did well so don't be so hard on yourself!"
Teachers,3d23vj,baby_trex,6,Mon Jul 13 11:48:29 2015 UTC,"This, a thousand times. I don't think even the best, most experienced teachers could have handled what was thrown at you. You should be so proud of the boomwhackers- I looked them up to see what they are! Very cool!"

My coworkers kept telling me I was doing a great job, but they were never in my classroom, so I don't know what they were basing that on.  Even in a supportive environment, I don't know if I could deal with teenagers. We have some teenage interns at my workplace for the summer and I can't wait for them to leave!"
Teachers,3d23vj,grimya,6,Mon Jul 13 12:41:50 2015 UTC,"Exactly! Unfortunately, OP was pretty much set up to fail by their school. That would be a tough situation for an experienced teacher to navigate."
Teachers,3d569p,Praetorian314,2,Mon Jul 13 16:42:38 2015 UTC,"I am not exactly what you are looking for, but  I am a 7th-8th grade social studies teacher in Louisiana.  Nailing down sixth grade can be a bit of a rough one, some schools place them with the elementary kids and some place them with the middle school.  Sixth graders are a bit of a limbo grade.  Depending on your school it could change a bit of the mindset (elementary they are the big kids on school so you have to be ready for a cockier bunch; middle school they are scared lil bunnies starting off in big kid school).    A few things I could think to mention to you:   I am not 100% sure what test 6th grade has because I never taught it, but I want to say it is iLeap (as of right now).  There is always a chance of it changing up until we hand the test papers out!  Your benefit is that as a the redheaded step child (a social studies teacher) there isn't as much stress placed on your subject for testing. A lot of first time teachers get afraid of students knowing something they don't and looking foolish, especially in Social Studies.  I have been teaching for 9 years and will get questions all the time that I can't remember off the top of my head.  I suggest being totally honest about it.  I try to always turn it into a learning moment for us all.  I let them know I don't know the answer and we will look it up together or that I don't know, but it is something they should look up for tomorrow (and I sometimes offer bonus points for those who bring in the answer). Enjoy yourself!!  Your students will pick up on the fact that you are enjoying yourself and that you are enjoying the material.  This will make your year so much easier.   If you have any specific questions or anything, please feel free to PM me.  Good luck, have fun, and enjoy the rest of your summer!"
Teachers,3d569p,dsmit22,2,Mon Jul 13 18:04:34 2015 UTC,"I would reach out to your principal or dept head, check the school's or district's website for curriculum document sand also look at the state Ed department for their standards.

Teachers,3d569p,Lulahula01,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:46:31 2015 UTC,"Some things to decide on before you begin (in no particular order):   Social Studies is a content heavy curriculum. Are you going to dredge through every word in the book, show and teach main points on a Slide Show, or assign the students to read and be prepared before coming to class discussions (and how will you hold them responsible). Research some unique ways for students to gain content. Inquiry through reading, observing art work, artifacts, and  comparing first person accounts is one way that I'm trying to work in.   I've had my best assessment success when I provide students with note outlines to fill in, study guides, or Quizlets to review. Most 6th graders haven't grasped onto study skills yet. You may need to teach them some. They are often still not sure how to pick out the most important details and concepts.   I start each unit with vocabulary to define and support the upcoming content.   Decide how you are going to assess the students along the way. Will it be through periodic questions about the content, deeper thinking questions, activities that show understanding, notes, research, etc.   Make sure to have some sort of consistent bell work for each day: geography work, journal writing, news article/picture to analyze, or questions of the day. It can be the same style each day, or different. What ever works for you and sends a message that work begins when they arrive.   Good luck with your new position!"

Teachers,3d36kx,barticusmaximus,4,Mon Jul 13 03:54:47 2015 UTC,"July seems to be the slowest part of summer for applications. May and June are good because schools fill positions for people who put in notice of resignation.  August is good because schools scramble to fill positions for people who waited until the last minute to quit (e.g., maternity leave, looking for a better job, pulling the trigger on moving).  During July, schools have hired and teachers haven't decided they're going to quit."
Teachers,3d36kx,PhantomandaRose,3,Mon Jul 13 04:38:57 2015 UTC,Also come August schools have a better idea of their student numbers (or finally realize that they shouldn't put 40 kids in a class) and will know if they need to hire another teacher...

If you don't get anything, apply for subbing positions and leave replacements. Apply further away than you'd like and in school districts you didn't previously consider.  My current district likes people with experience, no matter where you got that experience."

That's why so many philosophy statements are so vanilla (I believe every child can learn...).  Some (maybe most) want good soldiers who aren't going to be so idealistic that they ignore the minutiae that makes a classroom run.  So I think it's possible that a principal that reads this is going to think that this teacher is going to be a problem somehow down-the-line.  But it's also possible some might think it's brilliant.  Like a politician, it's often best to go to the center to try to get the most votes.  This is just my 2 cents.  I'm not in admin.  I think there is a way to make yourself sound more pragmatic without comprising your ideals."

Try looking at the philosophy statements of school districts to get some verbage. Check out some books from the library on education to get some more terms and phrases.

Am I totally overreacting?   No, no, no, and no.  You need and deserve to feel safe and able to let down in your own home. That goes without question. It sounds like you feel like your privacy is being impinged upon, and I don't blame you. So you need to make it stop.  Unlike the other commenters, however, I don't think you should go to the administration--yet. I'm thinking about the fact that (a) these are middle-schoolers and (b) talking to a parent/neighbor escalated it. These make it tougher. I would try addressing the students directly. Wait by the door and open it when it rings, and make it clear that you are there to talk to him/her, but only when you're at school. Do this only if you can be nice, firm, and not overbearing (this latter is my weakness). The hope is to startle them into both respecting and liking you.  Or, think of something else to try, if you can. Then if it keeps up yes, by all means, go to the administration.  Sorry you're going through this. Good luck!"
Teachers,3d34np,blankenstaff,2,Mon Jul 13 05:23:16 2015 UTC,"I agree with most of your points, and think that your way of addressing the students is great, but I disagree about bringing this up with admin.

I had one small issue with one of the neighbours - in Year 6 (I teach 9-12 in a P-12 school), decided it would be appropriate to call me by my first name and talk about my car etc. to show off to his friends.   I asked him nicely to stop on about four occasions, and had his classroom teacher talk to him several times as well. After none of this worked I took it to admin. Firstly, because I wasn't confident in my ability to stop it on my own without escalating the situation, given the failed attempts. Secondly, because I wanted my butt covered in case anything did happen where things got worse. Thirdly, to make sure admin was aware of a potential problem for future years - I don't really want my neighbour's kid in my class, so I figured if I brought up the issue now it would be on record for when he enters high school.  A member of admin had a chat with him and the issues stopped completely. Now he's nothing but respectful both at school and over the fence.  None of the other kids has ever caused an issue. I had one Year 9 girl say, jokingly, ""I know where you live!"" once but I made a joke back and it never happened again.   Kids knowing where you live is a potential issue when you live within the community. But having kids knocking on your door is totally not OK, especially late at night. I'd talk to the kids individually about appropriate behaviour and boundaries. After that, I'd escalate as far as you need to. But I'd also inform admin just to cover yourself in case anything does go wrong - or maybe ask them for advice, in case they've dealt with something similar before and know how to nip it in the bud."
Teachers,3d34np,itskaylan,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:24:22 2015 UTC,I live too far away from my school for this to happen. I think you should notify your administrator immediately and ask that parents be called. Maybe put up a no trespassing sign as a warning. If you've told them not to come onto your property and they do that would be trespassing. It really depends on if they are continuing after being told to stop. Do you answer the door when they come by? I have one family from my school down the street from me but I'm pretty sure they'd be too scared to come to my door as an annoyance. I've never heard of a teacher having this issue. I think I'll ask my principal about this when I meet with her tomorrow just out of curiosity.

Teachers,3d1jyr,thisisultimate,12,Sun Jul 12 19:37:38 2015 UTC,"I am not a teacher, I emphasize that first, but if you do choose to separate them into two groups, you should be careful on how its communicated and perceived.  Apparently, if you arbitrarily separate kids into two groups of equal 'aptitude' for learning/academic achievements and call one group ""A"" and the other group ""B"" that alone is enough to cause the kids of group ""B"" to start performing worse, relatively. (I can't quote a source on it,.. never mind; I can: page 18 of this PDF ) Here is the complete text of that chapter:   Many years ago, an experiment in education was carried out in secrecy at a school in England. The school had two classes for the same age of children. At the end of the school year an examination was held, in order to select the children for the classes of next year. However, the results of the exam were never revealed. In secrecy, with only the principal and the psychologists knowing the truth, the child who came first in the exam was placed in the same class with the children who came fourth and fifth, eighth and ninth, twelfth and thirteenth, and so on. While the children who came second and third in the exam were placed in the other class, with the children who came sixth and seventh, tenth and eleventh, and so on. In other words, based on their performance in the exam, the higher-performing and lower-performing children were split evenly between the two classes. Teachers for the next year were carefully selected for equal ability and experience. Even the classrooms were chosen with similar facilities. Everything was made as equal as possible, except for one thing: one was called “Class A,” the other, “Class B.” Whereas in fact the classes had children of equal ability, in everyone’s minds the children in Class A were the clever ones, and the kids of Class B were not so clever. Some of the parents of the Class A children were pleasantly surprised that their child had done so well and rewarded them with presents and praise, whereas the 18 parents of some of the Class B kids berated their children for not working hard enough and took away some of their privileges. Even the teachers taught the Class B kids in a different manner, not expecting so much from them. For a whole year the illusion was maintained. Then there was another end-of-year exam. The results were chilling, but not surprising. The children of Class A performed so much better than those of Class B. In fact, the results were just as if they had been the top half chosen from last year’s exam. They had become “Class A” children. And those in the other group, though equal the year before, had now become “Class B” kids. That was what they were told for a whole year, that was how they were treated, and that was what they believed—so that was what they became.   So whatever you do, it's important to be satisfied that this effect is counteracted- or at least small enough to not really matter."
Teachers,3d1jyr,alienus,7,Sun Jul 12 20:10:15 2015 UTC,"Ok (beware this is long), one pair of teachers tried this last year at my school and this is the just my experience with this. However, if you’re looking for an alternative then you can skip to the last paragraph.   I was working at a school last year where this was done. This kids figured it out after the first month. Everything went downhill from there. The parents were pissed, the education of the students suffered, and behavior issues with that entire grade skyrocketed! After enough paras, teachers, and parents complained (in April) the two teachers were threatened with multiple lawsuits. Actually several parents are still suing the school.  Separating students based on the abilities in such a socially crucial year is, in my opinion, detrimental. At least in my school, the low kids also had more behavior problems and when they all were shoved together tempers flared.  This division really hurt the kids (emotionally) who were perceived as the low students. By the end of the year they had 30/46 students in the grade on the late list, and most (~20) students on that list has 30+ assignments overdue. They never caught up either, and so they moved on to the next grade level without 1/3 of the knowledge they should have learned.    In addition, the high kids felt that the extra work they had to do was unfair because the low kids wouldn't do any work at all. So before spring break they quit doing most of their work as well. Half the high kids became depressed, and the others became giant bullies. They would taunt the kids in the low group both in/out of school.   After seeing a real world example of this in action, and how hurtful it was to the learning/social environment in both classrooms I wouldn't suggest this method. It does more harm than good, but that is just my own experience.   I understand that their are pros to splitting the kids by ability levels. It makes it easier to reach all your students, and provide them with the instruction on their level. The kids may excel if they don't manage to figure it out, and if you are very careful with what you say/how you do it. However, I think that they are so many things that can go wrong, and so many things that can hurt your impact as a teacher in the long run. Also, parents really like to talk, if it will spread around, and someone will be unhappy enough to call your principal/superintendent. After seeing what happened to the students at my school last year, and all the backlash (from district, parents, and students) I couldn't do it. (again, this is just my experience/opinion)  Another teacher I worked with before had students that were split between high and below level students without any students on level. Instead of splitting her class she gave a very short whole class lesson, and then she used stations to reach each group individually. She had two high groups, and two low groups. She met with them all or had them all practice skills on iPads. It is pretty much the Station Based Rotation Model, with her own spin on it."
Teachers,3d1jyr,throwaway889338383,5,Sun Jul 12 21:16:35 2015 UTC,"Everyone is making some valid points.  The way we get around the ""perception"" of it is every quarter we switch up who is teaching the class.  That means if you do high math first quarter/semester/term then do the low math the next one.  This allows the kids to have both teachers and it seems to have less of an effect that they were in a lower or higher class.  We also make the groups fluid.  Meaning each new topic we pretest and move kids around.  We have done it for 2 years and this year will be our 3rd in a 4th grade setting.  We have 3 teachers and the students know at some point of the year they will have each of us.  We have seen such amazing growth.  You can cover more even in the lower class."
Teachers,3d1jyr,teacher1415,4,Sun Jul 12 22:09:27 2015 UTC,"Have you read Po Bronson & Ashley Merryman's Top Dog: The Science of Winning and Losing?  It isn't about school alone, but some of the studies look at research around student performance.  The section I'm reading at the moment looks at how students perform in competitive environments and the influence of gender.  (The chapter title is: Even Odds: Why Women Need Them and Men Don't) What I'm getting from it is that when boys are surrounded by students who out-perform them, their performance goes down.  Fascinating and perhaps applicable to your question.  It certainly has me looking at the heterogenous/homogenous question differently."
Teachers,3d1jyr,runningstitch,2,Sun Jul 12 20:15:44 2015 UTC,"That's really interesting, I'd like to learn more. Are you saying that boys do better with divided levels and girls do better as a single group?"
Teachers,3d1jyr,misunderstoof,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:35:32 2015 UTC,"That might be over-simplifying it.  From what I'm understanding, a lot comes down to when males and females are willing to enter into competition. In general, females weigh their chances of ""winning"" and only enter into competitions if they have a good chance of winning; males focus on what they could win (rather than the odds of that happening) and enter into competitions if the ""prize"" is worth it.  What this means is that males enter into competition at a much higher rate than females.  The way this appears to relate to the classroom is that female students are less adversely affected when they are grouped with stronger students.  A average or weaker female student looks at the stronger student, realizes they won't ""win"" with higher scores, and therefore doesn't view that student as competition.  An average or weaker male student looks at the stronger student, sees the glory if they beat that student grade-wise and starts competing.  Every assessment, every teacher question becomes a competition that they lose.  They tend to stop competing, or give up, because they can't win.    The chapter (and book!) are definitely worth the read.  Not prescriptive, but thought-provoking.  Another idea on grouping (and I'm stealing this from my mother who taught 4th grade) is to have you and the other teacher switch students by subject.  Let's say that you are incredibly comfortable and strong teaching math and your colleague is incredibly comfortable strong and comfortable teaching history.  You decided that you will teach math to all of the students in both of your classes while your colleague will teach history.  Your math classes are a mix of students from both classes as are your colleague's history lessons.  You could re-group students by unit which prevents students from being permanently trapped in any one level.    An added benefit would be that you and your colleague now have one less subject to prep:)"
Teachers,3d1jyr,runningstitch,3,Mon Jul 13 11:10:47 2015 UTC,"There's a mixture of plusses and minuses in doing so. Of course there's the obvious concern about creating a self-fulfilling prophecy by lowering expectations on students in the lower group (although the effect of that in recent studies has generally found to be lower than what was previously thought). You also lose the ability to use higher functioning students to explain concepts to peers in group situations. On the plus side, being able to go over fundamental concepts and loop the curriculum more would obviously be beneficial to lower level students.    One thing I would caution against is thinking that students in the lower section only need extra time and repetition. They're going to need more explicit instruction on things higher level students may find intuitive, but just giving a few extra lessons on the same topic in the same way or allowing more time for independent work won't necessarily improve outcomes. In fact, acceleration of pace has been found to be correlated with improvement for ALL students, not just higher level ones. The lower level class should be as engaging, innovative, and dynamic with different approaches as the higher level one. Whoever ends up with the lower level class should also be prepared to deal with students who have some type of learning obstacle, whether it's academic, emotional, or social difficulties since trouble in any one of these realms can lead to lower performance."
Teachers,3d1jyr,Krugly,3,Sun Jul 12 20:22:47 2015 UTC,"Speaking as a High School teacher, I absolutely see the benefits from splitting up the class. Speaking as a person who has been leveled in two very different class settings, you have to be very careful with how you set it up.   In 3rd grade I switched schools in November and my new school did leveled math between several teachers. I was initially placed in the ""highest"" level group and after a week was unceremoniously dumped into the ""lowest"" level group. There was no secret about it, my parents were informed as to the why of the decision- but I hated every moment of it. I begrudged the teacher for the decision and the only thing that saved me that year was the fact that neither of those math teachers was my regular teacher (she taught an ELA class that period to a different class). To the teachers' and students' credit, nobody ever made fun of anybody else for being in any math class- all of my rage was for my own perceived stupidity. For the record, this was a British private school and it was VERY strict.   In 5th grade at another new school, there was also leveled Math and leveled ELA; to this day I don't know which level I was in. In 5th grade the teachers simply rotated everybody and occasionally would switch teachers for the Math and ELA course anyway. It was billed to the parents as teachers teaching to their strengths in order to reach the widest group of students."
Teachers,3d1jyr,RenegadeSongbird,2,Sun Jul 12 22:17:39 2015 UTC,"From a parent perspective, my children's school starts this in fifth grade and I am fine with it. They switch groups for ELA/Math, but everything else is done with their regular class. However, the teachers do not make public to the students or even the parents what level the students are in. I'm sure the kids figure it out, but my kids never thought much of it. In 4th grade, the students rotate through teachers for each subject, but stay as a class and it was a very positive experience as well since the kids like having the different teachers and moving classrooms during the day. Another option could be doing something like a regular ""mix-up"" day on Fridays, where you meet with your level kids on that one day, but it is done is a manner that is fun and interactive but level appropriate. I would just make sure you have strong backing from the administration and make the plan clear to parents from the start."
Teachers,3d1jyr,lleclair,2,Sun Jul 12 19:59:12 2015 UTC,"My situation this coming year sounds very similar to yours! I teach 4th grade ELA. We scheduled all the kids in May, focusing on math. Each kid has their own individual schedule. The math teacher for our grade needed a class for the gifted kids and a class for the iep kids. Theirs schedules then went from there. My morning class has more lower kids and behavior problems. My afternoon class has higher kids and gifted kids. My third class has kids who can work better independently (because I share the class with the other ELA teacher). Now that being said, it's not like my morning class is just all the low students. There a more lower ones, but there are also on-level on higher students. Same idea for my afternoon class. We do our scheduling this way mainly for math. But also for ELA. Sorry if this isn't super helpful. You can pm me of you have other questions. I'm happy to help!"
Teachers,3d1jyr,scienceteacher91,2,Sun Jul 12 20:56:25 2015 UTC,"It's already been mentioned to be cautious, or at least cognizant of the perception of grouping students homogeneously. Another point I'd like to stress is the matter of pacing. The idea of separating lower students to slow down in order to help them catch up seems pretty backwards to me. From what I've observed, particularly in elementary math, often the lower group skims the basic concepts in order to keep pace, or gets so far behind, the content is poorly scaffolded for the next grade level.   It's a complex problem, so, of course, it's a complex solution. Direct instruction is rarely the solution, though. Often times, students who are characterized as ""low"" are really disengaged, unmotivated, or have marked gaps in understanding. They've lost control of their own learning. No matter what you do, include the students in the goal setting and encourage them to track their progress. Give them agency in their own learning. Find opportunities for them to take what they've learned and create something new out of it.   [EDIT: werds]"
Teachers,3d1jyr,MrJ414,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:03:57 2015 UTC,"The class that I did my student teaching in did this! I thought it was awful when I first learned about it, but seeing how it worked and then taking over and teaching in a situation where students were grouped by ability made me realize how efficient it is as a teacher. I was teaching students and guiding them to practice skills that were actually relevant to their ability level, and there were way less behavioral issues because students were more matched to the content.   However, I think the only reason that it worked was because the classroom had a crazy accepting environment. It was fabulous how much the students supported each other. It was definitely created by how the teacher explained the situation and monitored how students perceived it. A student once moved up a math group for a certain topic (we re-arranged them every unit), and I overheard other students congratulating him throughout the day. At the same time, one of the other teachers in the hallway did the same thing and it completely backfired and it was a source of a lot of bullying throughout the year."

I would look into the workshop model for teaching, this would address the high/low aspect within your classroom.

Teachers,3d0er8,bvncmx,12,Sun Jul 12 13:14:32 2015 UTC,"I worked as a classroom teacher with push-in inclusion teachers for several years (fifth and sixth grade).  Making it work takes a lot of time, and a lot of communication.  The reason for this is that the whole point of push-in is that the work that the Special Ed students are doing is related to the work that the whole class is doing, even if their goals are different.    (If the work they're doing is not related to the rest of the class' work, then it might as well be pull-out.  It is exceedingly difficult for most Special Ed students to concentrate on their separate task while something completely unrelated is going on around them.  That model sets the kids up for failure - avoid it if at all possible.)  So in Language Arts, for example, I'd set up a lesson on use of descriptive language in writing and do a short intro with the entire class.  The inclusion teacher's goal might be something like combining short sentences into longer sentences.  Because she and I talked in advance, she'd prepared examples that have to do with description (e.g., There is a chair in the room.  The chair is blue. to There is a blue chair in the room. as a highly simplified example).  So it can be tough to make it all connected, and sometimes the connections are very tangential.  But it usually worked by the time we got to Year 2 and the inclusion teacher knew more about what we were going to be doing day-by-day.  Don't expect everything to work seamlessly throughout Year 1.  Some specific things that you can do:   Understand that (if your school is like my old school was), there are huge numbers of demands on classroom teachers' time.  I had fully 22 other specialists that I had to communicate with on a weekly basis.  (You will be just as overloaded, too, and hopefully your classroom teachers will understand that, in turn.) Because your students are still part of the class, there are occasionally times when your classroom teacher will need to talk to the whole class.  There are times when we've got to drop everything and talk about That Thing That Happened on the Playground.  It may mean having to delay something with one of your groups of students when this happens - be understanding of that. Give the classroom teacher a heads up on ways he/she can praise your students.  Nothing greased the wheels of making it work so wonderfully as me being able to say, ""Ms. Lieberman told me how good a job you did combining those sentences to make them more descriptive - nice work!""  Special education students are often desperate for someone to recognize they made a step forward, even as they are humiliated by the idea that their classmates made that step forward two years ago.  The praise often means more coming from the classroom teacher - don't take this personally. Likewise, getting info from the classroom teacher about great things the student did while you weren't there can cement your role as someone who is interested in how they're doing even when you're not there.  ""Mr. Connor told me about your home run in kickball the other day - that must have been awesome!""   Two things to avoid:   Undermining the classroom teacher.  Your students will test for daylight between you and the classroom teacher.  Resist the urge to win their support or affection by playing the 'nicer teacher' or the teacher who lets them get away with things.  This is particularly poisonous if that gets connected with the students' goals.  (The only bad special education teacher I ever worked with is the one who framed her work with the kids like ""Mr. Chanther said this - that sounds stupid and complicated.  Let's do this other thing instead."") Avoid blame.  Special ed students have that quality of succeeding one day and then failing at the same task the next day.  When failure happens, it can be tempting for either you or the classroom teacher to get into a blame game.  Avoid starting it (""You really should have spent more time on X"").  And when classroom teachers start it with you, it'll be hard as a new teacher to call them on it or avoid getting defensive (""I only see them 45 minutes a week ..."").  When you're more established it'll be easier to redirect them towards more productive discussions.  Before you get to that point, at the very least, let comments like that roll off of you.  The constant refrain with special needs students is frustration - kids frustrated that they can't do what everyone else seems to be able to do, teachers frustrated that progress one day seems to evaporate the next, and so on.  Don't let it get to you, and don't give in to the tendency to blame yourself, either.     Okay, so this turned into a magnum opus.  Sorry about that.  Good luck with Year One!"

Not all, but many SpEd teachers have a tendency to modify the assignments to help students score better, but completely miss out on the overall learning target. Students may walk away with a better grade, but with no better understanding of what they did. It's harder to do it the correct way, but always ask ""what are their learning goals""."

I like to prepare the IEP beforehand and then go over my intentions for updated goals and find any concerns they might want to bring up to the parents so we can discuss options together and be prepared for the meeting.  That said, communication and team activities with the other therapists will help you tremendously. I love team teaching with my OT and speech therapists.

Teachers,3d30yz,abullen22,2,Mon Jul 13 03:04:34 2015 UTC,"I'm fresh out of a 4 year college education program, so like you I have yet to start my first real teaching program.... but I will say that everything I have heard about the lower-end of tracking (which is what we call it here) has been negative. Other teachers, university professors, and so on all seem to have a bad view of it. Within the classroom itself it isn't such a problem, as you can target students for intervention, but on a school wide level, it's an issue because once you're on the ""lower"" track, it's almost impossible to get out. For example, in high school, we had four tracks: ""Standard"", ""College Prep"", Honors, and AP. If you tested into the Standard track as a freshman, it was almost impossible to leave that track for the next 4 years, as you were never learning the material needed to test into any of the other tracks. And the Standard level classes did not meet CSU A-G entry requirements, making getting into a 4 year state school after high school near impossible - it was off to community college for you.    If I recall correctly, as one example, this was how the Standard and College Prep math tracks were set up: College Prep: Algebra 1 -> Geometry -> Algebra 2 -> Math Analysis/Pre-calculus Standard: Algebra 1A -> Algebra 1B -> Geometry -> Discrete Math    I saw the same thing with English Learners during my student teaching. EL students who were tracked into a slower group or slower classroom did not get sufficient opportunities to ""leave"" their track. In theory, it was possible once per year during the CELDT test to get a higher EL level, or to become RFEP, but this was ineffective. Ideally, things like reading level groups should be fluid - students move between groups fluidly based on weekly reading comprehension scores, or the difficulty of the text being read in class. (I've seen this done as well - we regrouped reading groups frequently).    So, I guess to me, yes, I do think there's a stigma attached from a student perspective - you know you're in the ""dumb"" group - and as the person who forms the groups, in the back of my mind I have seen how hard it is to climb out of the lower level track once you're placed in it. The standards are lower and the pacing is slower and as such, you're not learning what you need to in order to test out.    Edit: There is a long conversation about the stigma of it over here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/3d1jyr/splitting_classes_based_on_ability_into_highlow/"

Teachers,3d30yz,Lulahula01,2,Thu Jul 16 01:09:28 2015 UTC,"Look at carol burris and/or Jo Boaler's work on de-tracking, great research by both. In my experience kids are also ashamed when their in the lowest class and will do anything to either avoid being out there, or hiding it from their peers so they aren't made fun of. I had one kid that came late every day because he didn't want people to see him walking into the class of ""those kids"" (some had multiple severe disabilities). It works great for the upper eschelon, assuming you made it into that class. However, the tools we use to identify kids are fallible, and kids change over time. Flexible grouping strategies are much more work, but allow for students to get the targeted instruction they need with the flexibility to move ""up"" or ""down"" as they progress."

Try to limit your survey to 1 page and/or something that would take less than 15 minutes to complete.  Make sure you are clear that this is anonymous, will not impact their grades in any way, and will help you to improve your practice.    Short answer questions (suggestions): * What was the most meaningful assignment you had during this course?  Explain. * What was the least meaningful assignment you had during this course?  Explain. * What skills (if any) did you learn in this class that you think will be helpful in your future career? * What do you want Professor LMAO_HAHA_WOW to know about your experiences in this class?

Aboriginal communities don't think much of white people because so many go in and then leave soon after arriving.   Actually, regardless of which rural town you're in, you'll likely be teaching a fair amount of Aboriginal students. They've got their own unique cultures and viewpoints, so I recommend reading and watching stuff made by Aboriginal people - it's naidoc week at the moment, so it should be easy to find stuff that's balanced. ABC has some great shows, if you can get a VPN up and running to get to ABC iview (it's like the BBC one I believe).   As for how we're treated...it depends on the school and the state. We're fairly well respected by the general public, but some states have higher pay than others.   I teach in a high school in rural WA, teaching a broad range of student backgrounds and abilities. I love my school and my kids are great for the most part. The lack of traffic is an added bonus too! Do you have any specific questions about it?   My other tip, no matter where you end up, is to get fully involved in the local community. A lot of non locals don't last more than a term because they become homesick and lonely. Country people are very friendly as a rule, so becoming part of the community just takes a bit of time and effort."

Teachers,3d20bw,kateyrose,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:51:24 2015 UTC,"I landed my first teaching job (still there) right out of college four years ago.  It was the 3rd school I interviewed at.  I did my student teaching in 6th and 7th grade, and the first two interviews were for high school positions.  I'm technically qualified for that, but didn't have experience beyond a once-a-week for 3 months practicum.  I think what landed me the job mostly was my personality just melding so well with the vibe of the three people who interviewed me.  At my first two interviews, the room was physically arranged and questions read as though I were on trial.  At the interview that landed me a job we all sat on couches in a circle and basically talked about why middle schoolers are awesome and how I saw myself being successful as a teacher of middle schoolers.  I walked back out to the car and said to my wife that if I didn't get this job, I wouldn't ever get one.  Got the call about two hours later."

He didn't say this outright, but he included it in the reasons of why he was excited to work with me.  I started applying beginning of March and I didn't get the offer until end of June/Beginning of July.  Don't give up!"

It was my 3rd serious interview when I got the job BUT I had been to countless job fairs, mailed my resume to everyone ever, and it was the end of July... The reason I got the job is that I knew a principal who knew a principal.  I also got hired at a very high needs Title I campus where many people would not have been happy to be hired.  My advice is to network and be willing to take a job anywhere.  I was in your shoes.  Just give it time!

Before I even got to demo there were several stages of applications, essays, and pre-interviews for most jobs.  I also applied to wayyyy more positions than I got interviewed for, and sent out countless emails with my resume to principals.  at the end, it was a personal referral that helped me get my job.  good luck to you!"

But I got no other calls from any of the other schools, so if it weren't for that last one I would have ended up substituting.   Long term subbing could help you get your foot in the door at a district, and there's always next school year if a full time offer doesn't pop up. I hope you get an offer though! Good luck!"
Teachers,3d20bw,Foxcat,1 point,Mon Jul 13 08:03:12 2015 UTC,"If you can see yourself teaching long term at the school that offered you the sub spot, I'd think twice about turning it down. I picked up a LTS job last year that wasn't in my cert area but was at my ""dream school"" just so that I could get my foot in the door. I networked my butt off and made sure that everyone knew I wanted a permanent position if and when one opened up.  Despite being an alt cert and a relatively new teacher, I was able to secure a spot for next year because of the LTS experience and exposure.  Prior to that offer though, I put in at least ten apps and only had one interview, so I really have little doubt that had I not done the LTS, I'd still be looking."
Teachers,3d20bw,mngirlintexas,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:22:54 2015 UTC,"I got job offers after my 4th interview , 5th interview, and later my 1st interview (which I guess is a lot of job offers?).  In total I had applied to over 100 schools, and was called to interview at 17 of them.  I think that the interviewing committees liked that I brought in samples of student work from my internship to explain my assessment style, as well as graphs of student achievement (my internship required us to do a unit plan with pre/post test comparisons, so I had data handy).   I also made sure to ask questions about the school & its community, as well as send personal thank-you emails to each interviewer.   I think a lot of it is about meshing with the interviewers. Make it a conversation more than an interrogation. If you can't do that, that school's probably not a good fit anyway.   Keep in mind that some teachers don't send in their resignations until just before the school year starts and schools do a lot of last-minute hiring at that time."

Should people be picking candidates that they might be able to influence later, or should they pick someone who will actually start off on the same page?  Endorsements are meant to give strength and opportunity to candidates who follow their ideals, not to curry favor with powerful contenders who don't.  There is no guarantee that this endorsement will increase AFT's influence.  And I think that doing this so early on makes it even harder to imagine that she will."

If they were worried their choice wouldn't win, they just should have waited... it's so early, there was no rush to choose.  If they endorsed Bernie in the primary and then he lost, what damage would that do?  Hillary would still be the Dems choice at that point.

I ask if they have any friends in the class.  I let them chose their own lab groups so it's good to know who might struggle to find people they want to work with.  My final two questions are 'Anything else I should know about you?' and 'Any questions you want to ask me?'.  For the first, most kids don't write anything but if they do it's usually a DOOZY and I'm glad I knew that up front.  Things like 'I have a job so I never do homework' or 'I can't control myself around Jane so don't sit me next to her'.  I collect the surveys the next day and answer all the questions they asked me.  It's usually procedural stuff, but sometimes they want to know if you're married, what kind of music you like, what you did over the summer, etc.  I like fostering personal connections with my students so I always answer them honestly.

Teachers pay teachers has tons of free rescues for the broke 1st year teacher. You tube is great because you can watch videos of different classroom management strategies as well has how some teachers conduct centers and other workshops.

My classroom is Red, Blue, and Green. Don't forget you'll want procedures for everything like getting inline, entering the classroom, eating in the cafeteria, asking questions, how to act when visitors come...I know I just spewed a lot of stuff, I don't mind going into detail if you want, or private messaging pics of my classroom. :D"

They love to feel like you are letting them in on your super secret at home life. Have assigned jobs- rotate them every couple of week. A token economy works WONDERS for management - i use 'tickets' they kids earn them AND LOSE them. They save them up for varying rewards: from cheat toys to 'write in pen for a day' (I buy fun pens ) to choose your lunch buddy to a homework pass. Different items have different costs. Have some ""high ticket"" items for the over achievers and savers, and some low tickets items for the kids who need immediate gratification. You can really reinforce positive behaviors with them ((like dogs with treats)) I do a lot of ""talk with a partner "" before we share out loud. It really increase the quality of what they say. Buy dry erase boards. If you can't- go to Home Depot and have them cut 12""x12"" squares of shower board- it works the same. Then EVERY kid can 'pop up' their answer."

Here are some books for Literacy Stations, if you are using them, that I found helpful:  Spaces & Places by Debbie Diller The Daily Five by Gail Boushey Word Ladders by Tim Rasinski  Teachers Pay Teachers has great classroom resources! For classroom management I used a dot chart, kids moved up or down based on their behavior. When they filled up their chart they received a reward ticket, this method was well-received. I also had monthly classroom jobs which kept each student accountable for something. This is a great age to teach, they are very sweet and typically eager to learn!"
Teachers,3cwxcm,starlight347,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:07:17 2015 UTC,"Excellent LA stations:  Florida Center for Reading Recovery.  The station/games are sorted by grade/strand.  They're fantastic. I went from 4th to 2nd ... remember that, even though these students can ""read,"" they are not near as independent as 4th graders.  2nd grade is tons of fun!!!"
Teachers,3cwxcm,adorablebutdangerous,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:17:02 2015 UTC,"A very tiny, but useful trick.  If you have a student that is just not working, meaning that you know they can do it, they're just daydreaming or fidgeting.  Challenge them to race a timer.  Get a little dramatic, and ask them ""So and So, do you think you can do these 4 problems in 3 minutes?  So and so, do you accept my challenge?!?! Here, press the start button on this timer when you're ready. Good luck!""  I sub and tutor, and this usually works ... especially with boys!!  I had one 2nd grader see me in the hall and say, ""Remember when you challenged me?""  BTW - Whatever they do in this time is great.  When the timer's up, check quickly.  Change the challenge, if needed, and start over.  Always ask first, though, if they think they can do it.  Most kids are pretty honest and like the challenge and attention.  Good luck!"

Teachers,3cwxcm,pillowmagic,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:25:24 2015 UTC,"One of the things I really enjoyed last year was implementing Whole Brain Teaching in my 2nd grade classroom.  I would recommend Googling it and seeing if it fits your management style.  It was so fun and uses a classroom scoreboard to reward good behavior.  I didn't give out one piece of candy or a sticker all year.  That is just MY opinion, though.  You will have to figure out what works for you.  As for any other component, I would recommend getting with your grade level team and asking for their advice about your district curriculum among other things.  One of the best things you can do during your first year is get very familiar with curriculum and state standards so that you can focus on those amongst the chaos. I would also recommend Daily 5 Language Arts and Daily 3 Math, that way you have few centers to create. I hope some of this helps!  I LOVE 2nd grade and I hope you will too. :-)"

Like someone else's mentioned the Debbie Diller 'Spaces and Places' book is great. I really enjoy getting to know each child and really believe that just building safe positive relationships with the students makes a difference when it comes to classroom management. Also, teaching mindfulness to the students is helpful. You can google mindfulness lessons. I just got a book called 'Mindful Learning' that seems to be a good resource. Good luck!"

Teachers,3cx0qp,TheGreatHyde,3,Sat Jul 11 18:26:20 2015 UTC,"HS Science Teacher here, going into my 5th year. I have 5, going on 6, different classes to prep for because it's a small district. What I usually end up doing is one of two things:   Pick a day, usually a Sunday, and spend the entire day getting everything ready for the week. Sometimes I use a utility like chalk.com or Microsoft OneNote, sometimes I write everything out meticulously in a notebook, depending on what I'm feeling like. Usually I try to avoid technology because I end up checking websites (LIKE REDDIT) more often than I should. I plan out roughly what we're going to do for the week on Sunday, then carve out the necessary time consistently each night. Sometimes I can use my plan period for actual planning, but usually I end up setting up for labs, attending meetings, or watching other teachers' classes because we can't usually get enough subs.   In addition, I find that spending the summer mapping out all of my curriculum for all of my classes and coming up with learning objectives and focusing on skills I want students to have (knowing how to write a lab report, knowing how to differentiate between biased and quality research sources, etc). Usually over the summer I can muster more clarity and creativity, then modify the 'big plans' as I go on a weekly basis depending on assemblies, events, etc. Hope this helps!"
Teachers,3cx0qp,missalaneous,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:22:13 2015 UTC,"This is exactly how I'm doing it right now - I spent the holidays building units, then spend Sunday's working out the week, then I'm spending each night working out daily lessons and resources. It's good to know ""real"" teachers do this as my mentor teacher is amazing and just plans fortnightly somehow. I think the fact I'm doing it at home and staying up late at night is what's getting me down so I'm going to try staying back until 5 and not take stuff home."

Teachers,3cy029,anothermochaplz,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:59:53 2015 UTC,"I'll preface this by saying I teach 10 year olds who are very emotional, many with serious home issues or who have experienced war/dark stuff before moving to the UK.  They're often triggered by things that I wouldn't even think twice about.  We often have conversations about how to deal with emotions when we hear about something that upsets us in the news, in our family, or in the classroom.  If the kid starts crying in the lesson, they usually don't want to be seen crying by their peers, so I'll have my LSA take them out discreetly so they can have cool-down time in the corridor and an opportunity to talk if they'd like - however we don't push them for details.  My LSA takes them to get a drink and walks out whatever was upsetting them most of the time.  I have a feeling box in my room that children often use to talk about things that are upsetting them or have upset them in a lesson (an old shoebox, decorated, with slips of paper for them to write on)-  They know that I check the box each day at break in the mornings and at the end of the day.  Through this box I found out about a bullying situation, a domestic abuse situation, why a student suddenly transferred into my room and a divorce (however it also garners comments about so-and-so called so-and-so a poop face, etc.)  If I've done something that has triggered the thing upsetting them (in some instances, this was as simple as putting on a YouTube playlist in the background where they worked, or mentioned the word ""parents"" instead of ""someone at home""), I'll briefly apologize, try to reassure them (if I know what the trigger was), and give them some time out to cool-down and compose themselves.  The kid is usually fine by the end of the day, I document whatever I did that triggered it (if I know--if not, what could have been the trigger?) and try to avoid that in the future.  Example: I have a child in foster care in my class.  Child's parents were supposed to take the child to a concert.  Child's parents didn't follow rules from courts, were not allowed to take child.  Child misses concert. Child crys every time song from that artist played. ---- Trigger discovered by mentioning out-of-character behaviour to foster carer after school.  Solution: remove songs by that artist from playlist."

Teachers,3cwrlr,inriri,1 point,Sat Jul 11 13:15:49 2015 UTC,"If it's laid back and about encouraging reading, then have them pick out their own reading material. Only limit their choice if it's too advanced. If it is well below them, so what, the point is to foster a love of reading.  You, of course, need access to a school or classroom library. Hold the class in the library if possible. In an ideal world, you'd have bean bag chairs for each student. Tell the kids at the outset that they'll need to tell the class why they chose the book they did, why they're excited about it. Then, later, what happened in the story, what they enjoyed about it.   Hold a literacy poster contest. Draw a favorite book character or book cover and incorporate the word READ into the poster. Show them samples of American Library Association posters for a frame of reference.   Offer a prize for the top three posters, then give the prize to all ten students. Each person has different tastes. Who are you to pass judgement on art? Likewise, it is OK to not like a book that someone else likes. There are millions of books in the world and you just have to discover what you like.  Maybe have the kids be the judges, casting secret votes for their favorite poster, then tear up their votes without looking at them. 'You know which poster you liked most. What anyone else thinks isn't important as long as you enjoyed it... just like with books. What you enjoy reading is probably different from most everyone else in this room, and that's what makes books cool. There is something for everyone no matter what you like.'  Find a book that all of the kids are familiar with. Maybe a book that was made into a movie all of the kids have seen. Break into two groups, to pick out a scene to reenact. Have them read the book version of the scene first, then perform it for the other half of the class."
Teachers,3cvsdp,what-a-doric,8,Sat Jul 11 04:45:12 2015 UTC,"When that behaviour pops up, how can teachers work with you to help you learn the best you can? I guess like.. how do they de-escalate that behaviour? What do you find is the most effective for you?"
Teachers,3cvsdp,Chuchoter,7,Sat Jul 11 04:50:36 2015 UTC,"Honestly, it really does depend on the behaviour itself. If it is something like throwing a pen or a book- harmlessly, ignore it. Seriously, if you are in a position where a kid does something stupid but doesn't cause any major ruckus, totally act like it's normal. Sometime's I'll throw a pen behind my shoulder completely impulsively and not realise what I've done until I've gone and picked it up, my teacher's learnt not to say anything and my friends usually don't react. If it's something a bit more disruptive, find something to distract them, start talking about an interesting part of the lesson, bring up a fact, make the whole class laugh, or get them to do something. Depending on the age, asking them to go get something for you, or get them to put in earphones and listen to music. Don't draw attention to the person directly, sometimes they don't want it and sometimes they do- if you give it to them either way you're in for a bad time.  If the kid is willing, talk to them about their behaviour, ask what they do to distract themselves. Look out for things that they do in class when they aren't doing anything disruptive- everyone, even you has little ticks that helps their brain go ""Oh shit, bad idea"" or ""you know I actually need to do some work.""  Basically, try not to be too shitty with them- kids like it when adults talk to them in a way that's not degrading. Obviously, if real shit is going down then, by all means get involved immediately."
Teachers,3cvsdp,topgirlaurora,4,Sat Jul 11 05:03:21 2015 UTC,"This is really helpful. We read advice like, ""don't draw attention to the behavior"" all the time in our education books, but to have it confirmed by a young person is very encouraging. I wonder what advice you could offer some of the first year teachers from time to time? If you didn't mind chiming in, of course!"
Teachers,3cvsdp,InsaneLordChaos,1 point,Sat Jul 11 06:24:04 2015 UTC,"Many teachers take these behaviors personally, and feel students ""like you"" are directing your dark energies toward them in particular.  Lots of us don't, but many do.    Many also, unfortunately, feel that these types of behaviors are controllable, ""if you really wanted to"" or if ""you really tried.""  I think this potentially varies by the school and community, and I would hope this doesn't happen often.    I have also taught with some, very unfortunately, who have kind of made it a mission to ""reign in"" these situations, and to ""break"" the behavior, as if there was an award waiting for them or something.  Can you offer some insight here?  Since there seem to be many young and prospective teachers, be they fresh out of school, transitioning from other careers, whatever...I think it would be helpful, and I agree with you...I don't think we get the opportunity to speak to students with learning and/or other mental issues this candidly.  I teach in the USA, and I was educated more than 20 years ago.  I would hope (dare I say assume?) that effective teacher training programs address this much better than in the past, but there are things we can learn, and in my own career I can tell you honestly I've learned more from interacting with my students than any teacher preparation program could ever teach me.  Thanks for the chance to speak with you."
Teachers,3cxyq0,Joskilatrix,7,Sat Jul 11 19:59:18 2015 UTC,"You might email the instructor ahead of time describing what you're looking for so they know how to prepare to help you best, but this is what their office hours are FOR. Also, unless it's a very large class, it's very likely your instructor is sitting there bored with no one to talk with for the duration of office hours. This is my habitual experience when I teach. I WISH my struggling students would come to office hours to review material thy don't understand - I would view it as a mark that you're serious about the subject and about succeeding that you're taking initiative in this. Finally, even though the instructor is a busy graduate student, they are being paid to teach, which includes holding office hours. This service is part of what you pay for with your tuition dollars. If the instructor is putting to many hours into teaching this class, that's an issue they have with their department, not an issue you have to deal with.  All this to say, yes you should definitely seek out the help you want from the instructor, and no by all means you should not pay extra for it."

Teachers,3cut60,Robkmil,21,Sat Jul 11 12:00:00 2015 UTC,"What kind of other educational experience would you bring to the table as an applicant other than your 1 year as a para? I'm asking because it's been 5 years since you graduated. It looks a bit strange to only have 1 year of experience as a para. Most people sub for at least a year before they're hired as a full time teacher. So what have you done to ""stand out"" from the crowd? If you can't think of anything really impressive, I would get busy researching how to get the job you want. Your student teaching (I'm assuming you went traditional route) was over 5 years ago, which does not look good to a potential employer.   I went back to school at 26 and graduated with my cert and master's at 32. Not being hired was simply not an option so I spent hundred of hours working on my resume, creating an online portfolio to highlight lesson plans, teaching resources, ed tech tools, and anything else that might have set me apart from the crowd. I also created an education blog that was focused on ed tech tools.  I even had my own business cards printed with my twitter handle, portfolio, and blog.   My point is, if you really want a career in teaching, YOU need to make it happen. I would start researching other teachers in your content (elementary right?) and incorporating some of their ideas into your portfolio (whether hard copy or web). It doesn't even matter if you have done these activities. You can throw them out in interviews.   Do you bring a portfolio to your interviews to showcase your best lessons and student products?  Do you know all the education jargon (eg. differentiation, formative assessments, equitable practices etc.)? This can set you apart from other potential candidates even if it's useless in the classroom.  Do you have twitter? If so, do you use it to network? You should be connecting with admin and teachers from districts that you are interested in working in. Also, keep connected by going to ""twitter chats"" for your content specialty. You will learn tons of new ideas and can even list them on your resume.   What does your professional development look like? Even though you were not teaching for 4 out of the 5 years since you graduated, it would still look bad if you have not attended any type of professional development in the meantime. There are tons of opportunities out there. Also, join any professional organizations that relate to your content specialty. I'm in the National Council for the Social Studies. Not only do I get great resources from them, but it's something I can put on my resume.  What does your integration of ed tech look like? That is what many districts are looking for in this day and age. 21st century skills are a big catch phrase in the field. Make sure you can answer the above question above and beyond simply saying ""I know how to use google.""  And finally, what does your resume look like? Take a long hard look at it (or get someone else, perhaps a teaching mentor). So many people have not mastered how to write a resume that stands out. You have very little time to stand out from the crowd so your more worthy accomplishments should be right at the top. Don't go right into your babysitting experience from high school! Highlight your BEST accomplishments right off the bat.  Hope this helps. BTW, I'm from NJ originally as well. I currently work in another state but I know how hard it can be to find a job in the state, which is why you have to do everything in your power to stand out from the pack. Good luck!!"
Teachers,3cut60,flowerofhighrank,2,Sat Jul 11 01:09:43 2015 UTC,Thank you so much for all of your advice. I taught developmental gymnastics for the past 3 years and the 2 years before that I was teaching pre-k. I have a lot of really great communication and classroom management skills. I don't have a professional Twitter. I started a Twitter YEARS ago and haven't really accessed it recently.   I'll do some professional development.  I really need to.  Thank you again for all of your advice. I really appreciate it.    I got super discouraged after a HORRENDOUS student teaching experience. That really set me back and made me move on to other jobs rather than really pursue my teaching career. It was teaching gymnastics that helped me refine my classroom management and communication skills.
Teachers,3cut60,DrDarkness,3,Sat Jul 11 01:36:00 2015 UTC,"Ok, so you have some pretty solid experience working with children. That's a great start. In interviews, one of the biggest things that they are looking for (from what I've heard) is a love of children. Make sure you emphasize that before all else! Def. start a professional twitter profile. Post interesting things relating to education and your content area on it. You never know if a potential employer will look at it after interviewing you.  On another note, you may be asked why you haven't found a full time teaching job in the 5 years since you graduated. Whatever you do, DON'T tell them what you just wrote about your bad teaching experience. Make up something if you have to. You don't ever want them to doubt your committment to becoming the best teacher possible. The last thing an admin wants is to hire a person, train them for a year, and then have to start all over again when that person burns out (not saying you will but that is how it might appear to them)."
Teachers,3cut60,nobodytrickedme,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:44:01 2015 UTC,"I totally agree with you.  In my interview I emphasized what I've learned from my professional experience and how I would vary over what I've learned into the classroom. I thought I nailed the interview and I'm super frustrated because I thought I did so well.   I had my principal observe a lesson that I did for my friend's kindergarten class and he LOVED it. He also really likes me and told me to put him down as a reference when I apply for jobs.  I know that I would be an amazing teacher.  Hell, I AM an amazing teacher .  Working in an ABA classroom means that I'm spending ALL DAY teaching very specific skills to kids on the autistic spectrum. Wouldn't that make me seem way more qualified than the typical teacher? I can roll with the punches (trust me, I have rolled with literal punches), I work well in a team, km great with kids, and communicate really well with parents on difficult subject matter.  Shit, I had a kid spit at me and didn't lose my cool. I'm just so beyond ready to have by own classroom.  5 years ago, definitely not. But now I am.   Edit: I have a pretty decent portfolio.  Lots of different lessons and I even came prepared with personalized packets for the different interviewers.  They seemed impressed but it obviously wasn't enough."

I was looking for a job in Michigan in the epicenter of 5 or so respected teaching colleges. It's very competitive here. One of the nicer schools had 800 applications for 30 positions. Some areas can be very competitive and subbing in the district can get you known and get you an in when you apply."

Your resume will get you an interview, but to get the job, you have to fit into the interviewers expectations. It could be something social, a personality trait, looking for people with a certain kind of energy, or maybe they only hire people that announce that they plan all their lessons after school on a Tuesday.  Getting a teaching job is a lot like dating. It doesn't matter that you are a great person. You have to be a certain kind of person that they are looking for, and they won't tell you what all they are looking for.  Keep trying. You just haven't gone to the right place yet."

The prices are not cheap initially, but I found two pair of the same style that were on sale so it was as if I bought two for the price of one.  They are outstanding from a person who normally hates formal wear of any kind.  If I had any choice I'd wear shorts and sandals all over the place.  I wouldn't suggest skimping on shoes if you're going to have to spend your entire day on your feet."
Teachers,3cvp36,ARayofLight,2,Sat Jul 11 04:47:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've got a pair of clarks that I use for teaching and they have been great. Mine took a fair bit of breaking in, and at first I was a little concerned that they were a bad purchase, but after finally reaching the tipping point, I don't really have any complaints. The one thing I did do is get some Dr Scholls insoles, but not even the fancier gel kind. I can't really say what they'd be like without them so I figured I'd mention that. But especially in terms of wear and tear, they've held up better than I'd ever ask. The soles have a nice durable no slip grip thing going on, which is surprisingly nice after having them for a while."

I've got myself 2 identical pairs of black Clark's loafers that I wear on alternate days (let's the shoes dry out so you don't end up with stinky feet) that I swear by. Also, invest in some good inserts (think Dr. Scholl's). I've got some that run about $30-35 with some hard plastic arches that you can heat up and reshape to fit the contours of your feet better (the name eludes me right now and I can't check).  One final comment: You stand and walk around on your feet all day. Invest in something that's a bit higher quality so you won't have foot/back problems later on down the road. One of the best pieces of advice that was given to me by a long-time teacher."
Teachers,3cvp36,howlinmad,2,Sat Jul 11 06:15:44 2015 UTC,"CLARKS!! I swear by these shoes. They aren't cheap, but they last a long time. If you shop smart you can catch a good deal there. It's absolutely worth the money. As a teacher you're on your feet all day, don't skimp on footwear.     I recommend clerks because they're comfortable, durable, and look good. Also the Clarke staff is super helpful. I got a pair about a year ago that must've been defective because a little tear appeared at a seam. I brought it in and they swapped the pair, no questions asked, no receipt.     Tl;dr I would be a shill for Clarks, they are that good."

Right now I'm using an Aussie brand that I can't think of right now and it made a huge difference. If you tend to stand in the same spot consider getting an anti-fatigue mat. If you're not concerned about comfort, then check out Kohls or a similar department store for your typical black dress shoe, but in my experience, comfort makes the job so much easier."

A couple of years ago, I switched to Dansko shoes, but I'm female and some male colleagues don't feel comfortable wearing Danskos.  Others do, so it's an individual choice.

Teachers,3cx3k6,mstob,3,Sat Jul 11 16:08:03 2015 UTC,"Look into the history of Claudette Colvin. She was a teenager arrested for not giving up her seat on a Montgomery bus before Rosa Parks. She was personally close with Parks and inspired the eventual protest, but her name is forgotten in history. This is largely because she was seen as an impetuous teen and then she got pregnant shortly after. There's a whole book on her called Twice Toward Justice. Lots of great lessons for kids, including how carefully planned movements were. Rosa Parks getting arrested was not an accident. Also, kids love seeing how young people were involved and they learn lessons about how to use their own voices.   A 45 min lesson is short, but you could handle it two ways. First, you could just try to teach her whole story. Hard to give good life lessons in that amount of time but still an interesting story. Second, you could give some historical context but treat the lesson more as a pre-reading or introducing the book lesson. There's tons of great resources online for ways to get students excited about a book. Maybe it's a bit strange to do that sort of lesson out of context, but if you can walk out of there with some kids saying how much they want to read the book I bet the interviewing team would love that.   I've taught the book a few times so if you want any advice about teaching the book in general let me know."

Teachers,3cx3k6,longtoddcopper,2,Sun Jul 12 01:27:21 2015 UTC,"How tolerant is this community/parents of dealing with the reality of what happened, or does it seem the kind of town that demands everything be sugar coated?  Something I would stress (this is something I would do regardless of the age level) is make them understand how truly brutal and risky it was to be a protester during the 1950s and '60s.  The modern calls by many about police brutality during protests is a very watered down comparison to what went on during that time.  People need to realize the commitment of these individuals to their cause and their willingness not only to stand up to this violence, but their resilience and ability to not raise a hand in their own defense and allow themselves to not only take it, but be incarcerated by a system that was wholly unjust, to help illustrate the injustice and wrongness of their position that government had allowed them to be put into.  Perhaps it is because of the school I went to for college, but protesters (and it was a campus past time) often would antagonize and get into altercations with police that would have seen them beaten bloody or killed 50 years ago and instead they would get dispersed by batons, and call it police brutality.  Then if any of their more militant comrades got arrested, they would go out and protest over that arrest (a justified and warranted one) because they claimed the right to raise hell.  Point is, there is a difference between civil disobedience and taking part in a riot, and I think it's important to explain the difference, especially to young people (they're more likely to be in the protesting mood sooner than you are), and to recognize the sacrifices and challenges that were overcome by all manner of people during those decades, not just black people, but all the people who rallied together with them, and to realize the huge strides we have seen taken by police with how they respond to protests in many parts of the country, and the distances we still have to go.  I would definitely tie it in to what has taken over the news circuit in the past year about the brutality and inhumanity shown to minorities by some police departments.  These kids need to realize that things are not all roses because of what happened half a century ago, but that they have gotten much better in some places as well."

When she finally introduced me she just said, ""This is Mr. Fatt_guy and he will be helping us out this semester.""  When I finally took over the class my mentor teacher lectured the class on how they were supposed to treat me like they would treat her and that I was now in charge.  She walked out of the class and I proceeded to attempt to teach.  At first they were ok, but once they realized I was completely unprepared to manage them they started taking advantage.  My ""plan"" was to be their friend and it didn't work.  Do you take over the class from day one or will you observe for a couple of weeks and slowly take on classes? It was two weeks before I took over my first class and I sat in the back the entire two weeks.  If you won't take over any classes immediately I suggest you still find some way to be involved in the lessons everyday.  Do something other than just passing out papers though otherwise they'll see you as just the ""helper"".    Right now I'm trying to get ready for my first week of school, so if you PM me I wouldn't mind shooting some ideas back and forth.  Helping you might help me prepare too."
Teachers,3ct7k4,titations,6,Mon Jul 13 15:28:35 2015 UTC,Yes x10000. The first few weeks of school are definitely the most important as to planning because it is what sets the tone for the rest of the year.
Teachers,3ct7k4,buzzkillichuck,7,Fri Jul 10 22:05:51 2015 UTC,Yes! I keep telling new teachers that you need to start with a strong foundation and expectations that very first day.  Many teachers want students to like them instead. Huge mistake

Teachers,3ct7k4,AlJoelson,3,Sat Jul 11 11:31:45 2015 UTC,"The first thing I do is set the expectation for how I want them to come into class.

So my first day starts with me standing at the door, greeting students, telling them where to sit if they can't find their seat (labeled with name tags) and to start the work on their desk.  If they don't come in the way I want (slow to their seat or noisy), I'll call them back to the door, redirect their behavior, and have them try again.  That way everyone gets in quiet and working to start the school year.  Then I'll start with the attention getting signal and proceed from their.  What to do if you need a pencil, what to do if you have a question, etc.  I have a power point set up so I don't forget anything."

Then I go over how the class works, what they'll learn, what they're accountable for, rules, procedures, etc.  My end-of-year questionnaire asks ""What would you tell future students about this class?"" and I pull a few quotes from there and print them out.  From there I do a ""tell me about yourself"" sheet or something like that.  Long story short, tell them what the expectations are and what the rules are.

(move waves up and down).   I don't know his real name.  And I don't know yours, either.      There are two ways that I can learn Bob's real name by the end of the first term.  See, right now, Bob is at ""sea level"", just like you.  (Draw the letter C above Bob).     But if Bob keeps sinking, I need to keep reaching in and grabbing Bob.  (drop Bob below the waves, and then rescue him).  And because I'm a polite guy, every time I save him, I'll call him by name.   If you keep ending up underwater this early in the game, I'm likely to remember your name, too.   But it's probably because I keep having to look it up to call home, or because I have to keep redirecting you.    The other way that I can learn your name is that I'm impressed.  See, look, bob is building a boat...to sail off to college.  (Draw boat)  Hey, Bob, what name are you going to put on that boat?  Oh, I see.  Success.  I'm quite impressed.  Nice to see you thriving, Bob.  I'll remember you, for sure.    Of course, if Bob just sits there, like a lump, he stays at C level - barely making it.  And just like him, if I can't figure out who the hell you are at term's end when I'm sitting there grading, you'll get Bob's grade, too.  C level.     So...are there any questions?  (wait until a hand goes up) Yes, Bob?  (Kids correct me, and we've established an important norm - that we are polite, and use proper names to refer to each other in this room, and introduce ourselves...)    From there, I do my standard demo for my intro media class - I hold up a bunch of branches from all the trees in the parking lot, and ask the kids to identify them.  The kids can't identify even the most obvious - maple, oak, usually - this is the inner city.  I then show them some single letters from product logos, and do the same thing - and now they can identify them.  We start our discussion - why is it that you can identify logos but not trees?  because of urgency - and thus the promise of this course, and of me - what we study in this course is urgent.  If at any time you are not sure WHY something is urgent, you have the right - I GIVE it to you, here and now - to politely and respectfully raise your hand, and ask me to defend the choice of example, curricular component, skill, etc.  as relevant to THEM.  If I can't, we'll move on.  And now the rest of the norms are being established...and the kids are getting a sense of what we're in for."

Teachers,3ct7k4,palopa,9,Sat Jul 11 12:12:39 2015 UTC,"I have a script and follow it fairly religiously. As procedures are learned and followed, I start to loosen up a bit and become a little more go with the flow. Those first few days are critical though. I have everything planned out in 10-30 minute segments.  I happen to have my first day schedule handy from last year, so I'll just share it, because why not. Our first day is always a half day, and I teach 4th grade.   8:00 - 8:20 Morning Work. School Day technically starts at 8:15, so this is mostly for students coming in early. I put something fun and super easy on desks so students can work on it with no help while I have time to greet students. 8:20 - 8:50 Teacher Intro/Procedures I have a powerpoint we go through, and this also has some ice breakers sprinkled in to keep students engaged and paying attention. 8:50 - 9:10 Sticky Note Activity. Basically an Expectations/Goals activity 9:10 - 9:25 Practice Lining Up, go for a quick walk around campus before it is actually recess time and before other classes are out. 9:25 - 9:40 Icebreaker/Community Building Activity 9:40 - 9:50 Practice Going Home Routine. Class leaves the classroom for recess as if they were leaving for the day, and leave their backpacks outside the classroom. 9:50 - 10:10 Recess 10:10 - 10:20 Practice Morning Routine. Class enters the classroom from recess as if they were arriving for the day. Practice signing in, coming inside without talking and immediately getting to work etc. 10:20 - 10:45 Writing Sample. Good first assessment for me, and also gives me an opportunity to introduce writing notebooks and writing expectations 10:45 - 10:55 Introduce Class Jobs 10:55 - 11:20 Folders and Supplies. Basically get everything organized. Classwork Folder, Homework Folder, where to put everything. This part is critical for me and starts the year off right. 11:20 - 11:50 Art. A ""Who Am I?"" fun project to end the day and give students a chance to chat a bit. 11:50 - 12 Planners/Clean up.   Basically, most of the day is spent on procedures, but I sprinkle activities in between them so that it is not just procedure after procedure. Usually, I format it as teach a procedure, do something, teach a procedure, and so on. I'd say the most important part of the day for me is setting expectations, introducing and practicing the morning routine, and getting organized. The next day, I want kids to come in and get to work perfectly, because it only gets more challenging from there for the rest of the year.  In the next few days of the first week, I then do some initial assessments and start sprinkling in core subject lessons. I introduce procedures anew for every single new subject that we start. ""This is where we keep our science journals. This is how we get out our science journals. This is where we keep our reading folders. This is how we get out our reading folders"" and so on and so on. Especially for the younger grades, you can't just expect them to transfer the knowledge. If you don't say it, they won't do it."

I also love social stories, so throughout  the day, we'll read ""How to be  a Super friend""  and one about what we do during naptime. During center time, I like to have only a few centers with a few toys open so we can focus on how to play with them and where the toys go when we clean up. Lather, rinse, repeat throughout the week."

Teachers,3ct7k4,__pizza__,4,Mon Jul 13 17:01:52 2015 UTC,"Script.  I'm a reading teacher and every group gets the same thing.  I introduce myself, have the students share info, I read Molly Lou Melon, and we set the expectations from there.  For the first two or three months I do not bend on rules, not even a little.   I'm nice, I'm empathetic, but the rules are law.  Once the environment is set and the kids get it, I loosen up a lot.  Any time I need to drop the law, it's so much easier because they understand what's happening and they know it's not the end of the world."
Teachers,3ct7k4,panthera213,2,Fri Jul 10 17:33:47 2015 UTC,How many rules do you have?
Teachers,3ct7k4,johnbmason,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:03:41 2015 UTC,"Not many. 1) First and foremost expectation is we are a team. Every person in reading lab needs help reading. It's our job to work as a team to do that. 2) if we are a team with a goal, how should we behave towards one another to achieve that goal. We talk about how we say things mattering just as much as what we say.  I do both good and bad examples with lots of discussion all of which links back to the book I read. 3) Then the last rule which I really really do not bend for the first couple of months is thumb up if you have something to say. In small group raising hands is silly, so my students put their thumbs up. Every single time a student days anything that violates any of these rules I stop the lesson and we talk about it. I don't get mad, I don't yell, but I also don't let the group move on until everyone understands what happened, and we discuss why it prevented the group from learning. Everything cycles back to being a team."
Teachers,3ct7k4,johnbmason,4,Fri Jul 10 18:41:06 2015 UTC,"I am a freshmen English teacher. I had minimal discipline problems last year.  Last year, I purchased the Wong's Classroom Management and adapted it for my needs; all levels can make use of that text. I implemented it from day one.  http://imgur.com/2cWE9OI The procedures that stuck were the procedures I put the most time in. The BEST one by far was this: http://imgur.com/TRqCv3R  All procedures were represented with images on my PowerPoint: http://imgur.com/B0B6ANH http://imgur.com/anlEwF2  This year, I'm going to kick it up a notch! Here's my go-to:  I seat people (in an alphabetical seating chart) as they walk in, then I ask them to grab a copy of a student survey that asks them about their previous experiences in my subject, what their priorities are, how they perform, etc. While they fill out the survey, I walk around and individually introduce myself to each student: I shake their hand, I say welcome to my class, I ask for their name (seating chart in hand, making pronunciation corrections and name preferences) and simultaneously take attendance.   When the survey is complete, I start to use the seating chart and teach them our first class-wide procedure: passing in papers. Then I hand out the syllabi by practicing the same procedure in reverse: passing back papers. Then, we read through the documents traditionally.   This year, however, I'm going to tweak the script because Jim Burke @englishcomp, my idol teacher, also gives students a painting to reflect on:  http://imgur.com/bHyMdwR  Example: Why would this be an iconic or relevant painting to think about on day one?  Side note: I'm also been really invested in higher order thinking skills over this summer and stumbled across Harvard's Project Zero's Artful Thinking  http://www.pz.gse.harvard.edu/artful_thinking.php which has a ton of interesting (and purposeful) formative assessment ideas for higher order thinking about ANY subject, not just art. However, because I will use that Burke painting, I'm totally going to introduce Artful Thinking to complement the painting either day one, day two, or day three. But those are just tentative plans...  I'm still looking for a better way to have late work ready to go... Any ideas?"
Teachers,3ct7k4,ILoveCuteKitties,3,Fri Jul 10 18:42:39 2015 UTC,"I teach high school band, AP music theory, a few other music-based classes.  Hi! I'm <blah>. Welcome to this class. If you are in the wrong class, sucks to be you. Wait out this class period and then go to your counselor between class periods. Or change your mind! I like new people.  I'll probably screw up half your names or forget nicknames if I try to read off the roster, so how about everybody says who they are? Name, first and last, let me know if you have a preferred nickname, and what's your favourite ice cream?  Awesome. Let's go through the syllabus. I know you all know how to read but I also know half of these are going to wind up in the bottom of your locker for an entire semester, so we're going over the whole thing anyways.   Then we read the syllabus. I ask about questions and go 'everything make sense?' every now and then, because I like to have a bit of their input. Doesn't mean I'll always follow it, but I at least listen to it.  Then we go over the year. With some classes -- particularly my music appreciation -- I give them a little survey to see what they want to get out of my classes. With band, the first three days we won't even be playing because we need to do instrument and locker assignments, then dive straight into pep band so we can get to the football games.  If there's any time after all that -- and most of the time there isn't -- then I let them sit and hang out and I talk with them on a more individual level, ask questions about the sports or other activities they're in, find out what they've done over the summer, stuff like that. Establish connections ASAP. The first day should be simple and clear-cut."
Teachers,3ct7k4,AUTeach,2,Fri Jul 10 21:24:08 2015 UTC,"Establishing connections is something I'm really going to try get right.  It'll be tricky because while student teaching I confused this with ""being liked"" and ended up trying too hard at times."

Teachers,3ct7k4,kerrz,3,Sat Jul 11 02:23:13 2015 UTC,"2nd grade teacher here. My first day has been the same for me for the past two years, and headed into my third year of teaching, it's going to remain the same until I find a better idea.  I have my kids throw fits. Literally. My wife's grandmother is really into knitting, and she makes these fun little knit balls of fluff that she calls ""Fits"". They're simply yarn balls stuffed with fluffy light cotton, and you can actually throw these things across the room without having to worry about breaking stuff.  Anyways, my wife's grandmother knitted me up like 50 of these Fits and gave them to me as a gift before my first year of teaching and told me to ""Incorporate these somehow."" Well, all of the Fits are a multitude of different colors, so when my kids walk into my classroom, I am standing at the door greeting them as the walk in, and each of them reaches into my big Fit Bucket and takes a Fit. I then have them line up and I stand directly in front of them.  Then, I instruct my students that today is the ONLY day that they are allowed to ever throw something at the teacher. I then tell them to take their best shot. We then proceed to have a small Fit Throwing Frenzy where they pelt me with these yarn balls. Each year, my kids have LOVED this exercise.   When we are done, I have them each find a Fit and line back up. The Fits are then used in a bunch of different Get to Know You exercises. I'll call a color and have kids find someone with a matching color and tell them a bit about themselves. I'll play games involving the Fit colors. I even seat them by calling Fit colors and picking students who have that color to sit in their seats accordingly.  Throughout the rest of the day, we are reviewing procedures, going over classroom rules, and discussing our ""Classroom Contract"" which we write out our own guidelines and rules. (That takes a few days to finish, then we all sign.)  Day one should DEFINITELY be planned out. NEVER wing it. :D"

I make it apparent that I don't want to go through it, but have to. This really sets a tone with the kids about how I feel about the administration's bs policies. They see I am there to teach, but have to deal with the bs of others, and causes them to be more apt to help whit getting administration requirements out of the way. I then move into talking about the actual class. I show the PowerPoint and talk about why I have the rules I do. Then I normally do a q and a get to know you game."

One of my courses focused entirely on the first and last week of school. In a short amount of time, you need to set expectations, provide information about the upcoming semester, learn about your students, instill at least a murmur of enthusiasm for your subject, etc.  Students need to know what the rules are rather than discovering them after they break them. They should also understand the scripts of the classroom so that you don't spend a bunch of wasted time on logistics in later classes."

I teach Computer Programming of various types, so it's easy for me to show the students something like, ""After 15 weeks, you'll be able to build this.""  If I were in a high school, I would do the exact same thing.  But if I were in an elementary school, where courses don't have such concrete objectives (more unit-based work) I would just start by introducing a few of the cool things my class from last year did, and why they did them.

Teachers,3ct7k4,kayteearr,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:31:21 2015 UTC,"Use butcher paper or sentence strips with the following questions on them:  -What should everyone in our class do to make sure things run as smooth as possible?  -What do you hope to learn in [insert content area/grade level here]?  -What will you need to do in order to be successful this year?  -What will [insert teacher name here] need to do to help you be successful this year?  -Our classroom should be ________ every day.  -[Insert content area here] is important because _________.  -How should kids in our class treat each other (including [insert teacher name here])?  -How do I want [insert teacher name here] to treat me?  Give each student 8 post-its (or the number of questions asked) and let them walk around and answer the questions genuinely.   Use the information on the post-its to write a classroom constitution or social contract that will be posted in the classroom for the entire year (add essential stuff if necessary). Base your expectations and discipline policy on the classroom contract and be fair and consistent the rest of the year.   From there...don't just talk about the classroom/school rules and expectations, have the students act them out. rules need to be taught, not broadcast to the masses.   Then...syllabus, how you operate as a teacher (discuss your teaching pedagogy with students so they know what to expect from you), who you are as a person, then the first content lessons of the year.   If you teach what you expect from the students well, then teaching the content becomes a snap...just remember to cultivate and maintain strong relationships with your students.

They are worried about their relationships. They are worried about whether your course will be too hard. And so on.  Keep the boilerplate to a minimum, but give them some work to do right out of the gate that will take their mind off all the things they're worried about. Let them work together, and make sure it's something that everyone should be able to complete (I teach math and science). Give them a day or two to finish."

There's nothing wrong with that, but it's probably important that you find people who are willing to contribute, too. Your site won't work without them!  Lesson plans are intellectual property and there is nothing wrong with making a profit off of good ideas, especially when they save other people labor. Sharing for free is a generous act."

Most people visiting the site will likely be new teachers. My approach would depend on helping new and newish teachers with the hope that they would pay it forward when they start making their own stuff. It would be amazing if some veteran teachers agreed with my philosophy of freely sharing and uploaded their files for the betterment of fresh teachers everywhere, though.  I agree with you that it's not wrong to sell original lesson plans. It's just shitty when you go looking for materials and all of sudden everyone wants two bucks for every lesson."

So I want to make sure I do this right and separate what needs separating.  I'm in the process of making the website right now, and I'm trying to figure out how to organize everything. Can you explain the needs of an elementary school English teacher versus a middle or high school English teacher?  I have a ""grammar"" section. Should I just have a separate ""Grammar for Elementary"" section? Same with vocab, writing, and poetry.  I would also appreciate a list of common fiction titles that are taught at the k-6 level so I can make Google Drive folders for them.  Thanks!"
Teachers,3ct4pr,Linguist208,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:33:56 2015 UTC,"I would suggest separating them into different sections. Younger grades are so different than older ones and it's important to differentiate. As for the needs of an elementary school English teacher, we (at least where I teach) focus on teaching basic parts of speech...nouns, verbs, adjectives, direct objects, prepositions, etc., as well as diagramming short sentences. I haven't taught higher than fifth grade English so I'm not sure what the needs of a high school English teacher are.   I have taught a few novels since I started teaching. The Whipping Boy (4th Grade), Sign of the Beaver (5th), The Giver (6th), Dragonwings and Call of the Wild (7th). I love the idea of making Google Drive folders for different novels. I hated searching for resources and finding out I had to pay $20 on average for a unit. I ended up making my own...  How are you going to set up the writing section? Into different types of writing (narrative, persuasive, business letters, etc.), or some other way?"
