Go to Host > Chest > Cards > Custom  5) Copy/Paste the ""Card back"" link from Magic Exporter into the correct slot in TT simulator.  6) Open the Exporter imgur link in a new tab. Check to make sure there are no black spots except for the last row.  7) If there are black spots go back and check your deck in the EXporter for cards without images (hover over), re-add or replace them. Save, refresh page, Load, Export.  8) Copy/Paste the Imgur link of your exported deck into the ""Face"" slot in TT simulator.  9) Set the card count to the appropriate amount (60-69).  10) Check to make sure your cards have loaded properly. Right-click the deck, enter a name, then save to chest.   11) You can load your deck anytime from Host > Saved Objects > Deck name."

tabletopsimulator,3dpv7t,Shuckeru,3,Sat Jul 18 09:59:58 2015 UTC,There is a big community for this game.        There are plenty of public rooms and groups on Steam looking for new people. I've been playing for four days myself and have found several people who enjoy hosting games and who are chill players.         You don't need a group of close friends to make this game worthwhile. Get in there and maybe make some new ones.        The other people in this thread are off their rocker if they think any of those negatives is all that TTS is about.
tabletopsimulator,3dpv7t,Magicbison,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:03:31 2015 UTC,Not saying that the negatives is all that tts is about. But also try to fairly/honestly warn people about the possible pit falls. As I stated I think the game is worth buying and is a lot of fun. I have played more games and with random people than I have in a long time.

If you don't know already, DDoS stands for Distributed Denial of Service.  It's a hacker tactic and is somewhat common on twitch when there's a very popular stream.  From https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack :     A distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) is where incoming traffic comes from more than one - and often thousands - of unique IP's, either from botnets or via various types of reflection attack.  A successful attack may take advantage of some property of the operating system or applications on the victim system which enables an attack to consuming vastly more of the victim's resources than the attacker's. More usually the attacker has to either control a computer with greater computation power or network bandwidth than the target - or control a larger number of computers, use them to attack as a group."

Highlights of the night include: Making an unexpected Goblin friend, and plotting out a little goblin coup to place him in power.  A fighter named BAMF nailing some crucially epic moves against the lowest level enemies possible, and completely waffling in the face of true danger. But seriously, let's talk about how cool that jumping-dive off the ice bridge into the furious grasp of a raging reefclaw was.   Making friends with the Goblin King, but not without remembering to rob him blind.   Reuniting with our little goblin friend!  Watching out little goblin friend get crushed to death by a giant black dragon about 3 seconds later.  The dragon was a turn or two from wiping the party when it happened. In a fit of desperation, our wizard tried lighting a fire on a bunch of barrels to create a fiery barrier against the dragon, and certain death.   Instead he ignited the gunpowder inside, pretty much goo-er-izing the entire party.  GG"

About me:  I'm a 21 year old girl living in the eastern time zone.  I'm civilized and enjoy role-playing my characters, and I don't interrupt peoples turns/moves. Unfortunately sometimes I roll an elf (depends on the game we're playing of course) but I tend to lean towards races that are well suited to being rangers or healers I prefer to play with people who enjoy the strategy/role-play aspect of the game as opposed to the people who just charge in and roll the dice (literally lol) Don't get me wrong I understand sometimes it makes sense flavour-wise for maybe one or two people in the party to be like that, but I'd rather it not be everyone.  I've GMed similar games before but never DnD in fact I haven't even played much DnD at all though I'm happy to learn.   I'm pretty pumped for Titan's Grave after all the Geek and Sundry vids. It looks awesome/simpler than DnD and as such maybe better suited to Tabletop Simulator? But I'm up for pretty much anything :3  (sorry about the elfing)"

I've been watching the YouTube videos of previous campaigns, and the game looks deceptively simple.  Just about everything was decided by the roll of a D20.  And that's it.  A D20. No ""My guy's gunna hit with this weapon and it does 1d8+2 and I have this skill so it's +3 more..."" or anything complicated.  So once I learn more about it in terms of any other rules, I'll probably post again about starting a campaign with it."

tabletopsimulator,3d61ju,The_Raven81,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:54:32 2015 UTC,"Well from what I see of it so far, it's been about having fun at it, and not having to worry about all the mechanics, rolling so many dice for so many different things.  You just roll the D20, and you either make your action or you don't, and the DM plays out how it went.  If you watch the show on Youtube, or on twitch on Saturdays at 3pm EST: http://www.twitch.tv/coestar and you can see how it plays.  It's a hilarious show, too."
tabletopsimulator,3d61ju,Stablamm,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:53:50 2015 UTC,"If you need a dynamic thing to use for Character Creation, then probably the best thing to do, would be create a specialized set of Notecards based on the base classes.  Because the Character Sheets are Universal, and have a place for everything depending on what class you are, and not everything is needed.  So like, A rogue. there's skills in the list that the Rogue would ""specialize"" in, so you can set those on that particular set of cards, or a Sorcerer/Wizard/any magic user - make a card or 2 for spells.  It's not EXTREMELY difficult to do in TTS, the thing is that people don't have the patience to get it set up so that it IS easy.  It's a lot of work to set up but once it is, it's a piece of cake to use."

The king cannot move down since his own rook is blocking him. He can't take the rook since the Queen is covering it.

tabletopsimulator,3d0tfi,TTSModdler,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:58:21 2015 UTC,"What do you mean ""manually save"" every tile?  You'll need to save the ones you want to use in another mod, but after that you can just copy-paste them.  If you're just trying to save a bunch of pieces from one mod into another, stick them all in a bag, save the bag, then load the bag in your other mod."
tabletopsimulator,3d0tfi,DMJason,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:46:17 2015 UTC,"To expand on this:  You can save and spawn in any piece/object to your chest (or selection of pieces) through the right click menu. Collections of pieces can be put in a bag, which can be saved the same way.  For instance, I have both Modular Dungeon and Modular Town pieces. I have an ""object"" saved in my chest that is a collection of either the dungeon or town pieces. When I spawn this object, it places about 10 bags containing all pieces of a type. I can spawn these into any table, copy/paste/place whatever I want, then delete the bags back out."

tabletopsimulator,3cysxj,orb360,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:24:46 2015 UTC,I continue to be astonished by the sheer amount of posts on this /r related to Munchkin. Either people wanting to play with someone or (most of the time) people refusing to use the search bar and instead creating a brand new post asking where they can find and download Munchkin. Is this the most popular card game in the world?
tabletopsimulator,3cysxj,mason202,1 point,Sun Jul 12 09:15:06 2015 UTC,"It's amazingly popular. At conventions, there is always a table or two playing munchkin. It's also stocked in every game store I've ever seen.  It has the advantage of being extremely portable (deck of cards sized for the base game), and quick, while still not being overly simplistic. You can also teach it to a new player in ~5 minutes."
tabletopsimulator,3cysxj,Terkala,0,Sun Jul 12 17:40:48 2015 UTC,Last time I checked (about a month ago) there was no available version of Munchkin in the Steam Workshop. How is everyone here playing it?
tabletopsimulator,3cysxj,kharlos,4,Sun Jul 12 04:58:12 2015 UTC,"Mods come and go on the Workshop due to DMCA takedowns. There have been a handful of Munchkin mods added back to the Workshop since you last checked. It's also likely that they got taken back down again. However, once you've downloaded a mod it stays saved in TTS even if it's taken down.  Since no one is really helping you out here in regards to getting mods from third-party sources - /u/JimmyDabomb is right, there are more ways to find games than via the workshop.   Check NexusMods Check the Tabletop Simulator mod pack post Inquire if the people you're playing a game can provide you with a copy of the mod. (They may have a Private Workshop, or may be able to provide you with a save. Find a Steam Group that plays the game you want, and see if they provide a copy of the save to play with. Make a copy of the mod yourself. All of the images, models TTS loads are stored in a cache file - you can use that to recreate the mod. I'm sure there are a few more ways that I cannot think of at the moment"

I can work around that (I'll assume it is http), but yuck.  As for why all the different pages - well it's my first tinker app and currently it is mapping each page to a cli option.

tabletopsimulator,3csz1m,chimpwithalimp,2,Wed Jul 15 08:43:31 2015 UTC,"Two things.  One, I found a couple mods that have urls inside their ""rules"" which TTS Manager tries to download and fails.  One was a pdf to a rulebook, for example.  So it counts it as a missing file, which it probably shouldn't.  It might be nice if it could download those files (pdfs certainly) but that might be outside the scope of the program (I mean, where would you store it and how would someone know it had been downloaded?)  On the UI side, I played around (pretty clumsily, I'm sure) in the code and I have suggestion.  Rather than having the user check each mod manually for missing files, when you initially populate the list, check at that time if there are missing files and highlight those items in the list with  self.file_list.itemconfig(i,{'bg':'pink'})   I basically copied the relevant code from file_list_has_changed to list_command which probably isn't most efficient way, but it works.  What it doesn't do is update if you subsequently download the missing files."
tabletopsimulator,3csz1m,chimpwithalimp,2,Wed Jul 15 15:58:21 2015 UTC,"Hmmm. Have you an example of one that is like that? I can take a look / have a think on how it could be handled.  Yeah, the UI is, well frankly terrible. The tinting is an interesting idea, although I have sketched out a rewrite which will replace the multi-pane layout; I plan on attacking that once I have finished with the code to handle the 'save mods in gamedata' config option (surprisingly complex)"

I only wish there was something that could be done about making the horizontal cards zoom in (with the alt key).  Could the purely horizontal cards be imported as say a second deck and then mixed in with the other cards so the zoom in view is correct for each card?  When I played your mod, I had to do a couple things to make the game feel a little better.  I used a smaller table for one, the hands were just too far away from the board you had made.  Maybe you could make the board an image you use on the custom table, which might make that easier?  The second thing I did was replace the Authority table you put in and just give each player one of the free bags and fill it with the authority tokens.  Then you could just mouse over it and see ""oh that player is at 38 authority right now"" at a glance.  It also made it easier to add and subtract authority during a turn.  This really is easy to accomplish using the white or black go tokens that are included with the TTS game.  All told I really had fun with this, playing it for the first time last night.  Thank you very much for the upload."
tabletopsimulator,3cq09a,KageKaze,3,Sat Jul 11 04:54:00 2015 UTC,"Thanks,  After playing about 20 games with some friends I have made some major changes and will update it soon.  I moved the game onto the custom table and made the authority board horizontal at the bottom.  This helps in a lot of ways.   Much easier to put cards into your hidden hand and pull onto the table still plenty of room for lots of cards and bases I tinkered with using bags for Authority, but it's just so much easier to have higher point values such as 5's 10's etc to remove instead of having to drag out so many points.   Here is what the board looks like now on a single table in my test buildi will add the Text for both sides (draw/scarp/etc)  I could also just add a bag on the left of the custom table next to the authority so people could play that way if desired.  I'm happy with the look of what I have done but now I'm just trying to make it play well since the entire purpose of this is to offer a better experience than the digital version as I love the card version IRL.  thanks for all your input"
tabletopsimulator,3cpvmw,greyhawke115,2,Thu Jul 9 20:38:01 2015 UTC,"It's a complicated process, but you could easily just scan cards in a scanner and crop each one individually in paint and then glue them together in deck builder.

tabletopsimulator,3cpvmw,simonc95,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:17:48 2015 UTC,"I appreciate the replies. I have tried the flatbed scanner route, and it is, as noted, super tedious. I spend more time cleaning up the cards from being unaligned then cropping them out individually than I would spend scanning the cards one at a time.  I was hoping something existed out there that was less tedious.   And, looking art bulk business card scanners, it does look like there is a solution http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ATZ9QMO/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00ATZ9QMO&linkCode=as2&tag=noflaming . Hopefully someone will come along that may have had experience with these bulk business card scanners for gaming cards (I am concerned with damaging the cards) or to suggest something less expensive. There is also this model that is cheaper, but again, concerned with bending the cards http://www.amazon.com/Fujitsu-ScanSnap-S1300i-Document-Scanner/dp/B008HBFADQ/ref=pd_sim_229_5?ie=UTF8&refRID=1HDJK9AJSTYGV5QBBJZ8"
tabletopsimulator,3cpvmw,Nerd_By_Design,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:15:34 2015 UTC,Even with an auto feeding scanner you would have issues with the cropping cutting off some of the card. The only way to do it and keep the quality of the cards intact is to do it by hand. To make it less tedious simply set up photoshop to have the correct dimensions  with some guide lines to get the edges perfect. I can do about 3 cards a minute with this method. I usually scan groups of 9 cards at a time depending on their size. I know that's not what you want to hear but unfortunately there is no easy way to convert game board for online play without the original files.
