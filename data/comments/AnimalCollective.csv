The last time Essplode was brought out, it was great as a part of fireworks, but lost a lot of its token rawness due to the Panda's percussion being pretty much replaced by the Fireworks loop and Avey not primal screaming."

AnimalCollective,3e4xbr,TylerAM,3,Wed Jul 22 01:42:28 2015 UTC,"I like your rankings, however I'd like to know why you ranked Someday so low. It's my favorite song off the album and whenever anybody ranks songs off Spirit it's always one of the lowest ranking songs."
AnimalCollective,3e4xbr,samster120,2,Wed Jul 22 03:07:03 2015 UTC,"It's hard to answer because Spirit is my favorite album of all time, and as such, I love all the tracks; it's not really that there's anything wrong with Someday (I tend to call it Giant); I just like the other tracks more.  Giant and Everyone's Whistling serve as like transition tracks to me, meant to give more atmosphere to their respective parts of the album, so when it comes to which tracks I prefer, they just rank low to me because they don't really stick out as stand alone tracks to me; Everyone's Whistling ranks higher to me than Giant because I fucking adore how it bridges Chocolate Girl and La Rapet.  There's nothing wrong with it; it's a great track; it just registers in my mind as the preamble to Alvin Row, so it doesn't get really high praise as a result.  It's all very subjective, but I hope I got my point across."
AnimalCollective,3e4xbr,TylerAM,3,Wed Jul 22 03:19:05 2015 UTC,Ah yes I see what you mean. I don't usually listen to Spirit track by track. I normally listen to one song and I guess that's why I think Giant is the best off the album.

AnimalCollective,3e1mhc,RockoBOOM,12,Tue Jul 21 06:57:07 2015 UTC,im a musician that makes my own songs and what not. i will say that the sounds on MPP are crisp and probably not too easy to recreate. These dudes have a lot of equipment at their disposal as well as a wide variety of samples and what not. Im enamored with the bass sounds on most of the tracks myself. I think you should keep at it and keep making original music.
AnimalCollective,3e1mhc,PRYHMZ,4,Tue Jul 21 10:19:15 2015 UTC,"Not sure about MPP but I've heard Dave say he likes the old SH-101 for bass sounds.   Don't forget that they also had a great producer on that album.   A lot of the sound has to do with the fact that they played their electronic sounds over a pa, miked it, and then ran it through killer gear in a sweet studio."

I am gonna get some instruments for birthday/Christmas though, so I don't have to wait too terribly long. Looking to make a mixture of HCTI and Person Pitch for my first project."
AnimalCollective,3e1mhc,HatofulThread,3,Tue Jul 21 08:29:45 2015 UTC,"If you're gonna make music that's kinda close to Person Pitch, stop what you're doing and just get a DAW (FL Studio, Ableton, and Logic being examples). These kinds of programs are into opinion great for people packed to the brim with ideas, but sadly no devoted band members. We live in an age where thousands of dollars worth of studio equipment can be somewhat replicated by internet programs ready when you are. If you can and want to compose music now, what are you waiting for?"
AnimalCollective,3e1mhc,HatofulThread,3,Tue Jul 21 09:10:45 2015 UTC,"Oh, I'm aware of DAWs and already have Abelton. I'm not a complete newbie. I just want to have some real instruments in my hands as I make it. But I will of course use Abelton to edit and add samples. I also plan to teach myself every instrument needed as a one man band sort of thing. Thanks for the tips though, if you've got any more I could definitely use them."
AnimalCollective,3e1mhc,bengr35,2,Tue Jul 21 09:21:12 2015 UTC,Real intstruments help me when I get stuck with ableton
AnimalCollective,3e1mhc,stasz92,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:57:52 2015 UTC,"If you're willing to use your DAW more, just go out and get some free VSTS. The quality will be different from Massive to a free synth, but most people don't even know how to use Massive to their advantage, that they just use the same goddamn presets over and over again. This brings me to my next point on how sound design should be a top priority for anyone. Too many musicians just disregard it and down vote whoever has some truth to tell them their track sucks major dog dick. Anyways, the reason I recommended the DAWS was because Person Pitch is a very computer friendly album for me, and so is HCTI somewhat. Keep doing what you do, and have fun too."
AnimalCollective,3e1mhc,theredwoodcurtain,2,Tue Jul 21 09:30:32 2015 UTC,If he wants to sound like Person Pitch he should use hardware samplers like the sp-404
AnimalCollective,3e1mhc,argylerings,3,Tue Jul 21 14:48:17 2015 UTC,"I'm a musician and teacher, mostly with folk and acoustic music, but in my free time i work on original stuff that's heavily AnCo influenced.  I've made a few albums in the studio, and I'm working up a live Ableton set that's very Panda inspired: live remixes of tracks with vocal processing.  I'm always inspired by AnCo sound design: truly some of the most interesting sounds and textures."
AnimalCollective,3e1mhc,vintage_drgonzo,3,Tue Jul 21 13:27:07 2015 UTC,"Same way man.  But I think thats the beauty of AnCo.

AnimalCollective,3e1mhc,CrimeBeat,2,Tue Jul 21 07:00:22 2015 UTC,"It was because today when I was trying to make beats, I was fucking around on my synths, and I got this sorta wub like synth. At first, it was a normal synth, but when I screwed around with it some more and added some reverb and phaser to that shit, it got me this sorta wave like bass that made me feel like I was a degree closer to the shit they made on MPP. Don't worry about how you think your tracks are shit though, we're all fighting this battle of recognition and dope sounds on an upstream river, and we'll make progress."

A good tip to improve creativity is that you should fuck up your voice some more with vocal effects (vocoders, autotune, reverb, iunfuckingknow), which I find although hard to do, very rewarding. Keep this up.   EDIT: I was also listening to your other tunes, and I was sorta liking some of the electronic work on it. If you're willing to collab by singing on some tracks, just hit me up."

I don't think it's a good idea to say to yourself ""THIS ISN'T EXPERIMENTAL MUSIC"", because what's the point if you're replicating our favorite bands. Instead, try to make music that sounds more like ""you"" by taking aspects of the sounds you like from all of your favorite bands while putting aside the things you don't like, you know what I mean. I guess it's more like a music blender at that point, but just make music that doesn't sound like the same number of producers and musicians who use the same goddamn presets over and over again.

AnimalCollective,3dzwe4,swagyolotaco,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:54:56 2015 UTC,I would most definitely listen to the leak. I don't see the point in not listening tbh. I just wouldn't listen to the singles over and over before the album was released (that is if there even are singles released before the leak) like I did with Currents 'cause I feel like that ruined the album for me.

Even then, you gotta warm them up to some friendly weird stuff, like BMSR and the Flaming Lips before I'd delve into AnCo with them. With that said, I'm not really one to force my music tastes on others, everyone has their own taste and they're allowed to like and dislike whatever they want."
AnimalCollective,3dyfec,UncleHuggedMeFunny,4,Mon Jul 20 15:45:23 2015 UTC,"If they don't, they won't like the band   This is pretty harsh. I hated Summertime Clothes when I first heard it and now AC is my favorite band. That track still isn't one of my faves!"
AnimalCollective,3dyfec,mia-pharaoh,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:25:13 2015 UTC,"I mean, it's more or less their most accessible track, and if you've been trying to get people into AnCo and they aren't feeling it, it's safe to say they won't like AnCo after that.

AnimalCollective,3dyfec,noraamitt,8,Mon Jul 20 23:51:49 2015 UTC,"Don't worry about it so much. If they don't get ""it"" then that's fine. Personally, I get really turned off when I tell someone ""Sorry, not really into this"" and they keep pushing. It may grow on them, it may not. It's always worth an honest shot with most people, though. Put yourself in their shoes, do you like having something pushed on you? I'm always down to give things an honest effort, and some things don't come quickly, but if I don't like something I don't like something.   Was driving around with one of my best friends and I put Feels on. He said he wasn't too into it, as he likes music with established rhythms. More rooted in funk/blues/R&B typically. He told me he does enjoy Fireworks, likely for the driving rhythm/direction of the song. I kinda left it at that. I could have tried out a few other songs off different albums, but I let Banshee Beat play out and changed the artist. He's no stranger to weird music, just isn't all that into Animal Collective. He prefers a little more typical structure in music.   On the flip side, one of my other best friends who I never would have pegged as a guy who'd be into Animal Collective really loves them. We've had many a drunken Derek singalong."
AnimalCollective,3dyfec,noraamitt,3,Mon Jul 20 16:26:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I don't keep pushing the same friends who aren't into something. I usually just show them 1/2 songs and if they don't like it, I don't push the matter anymore.

AnimalCollective,3dyfec,ThePancakey,3,Mon Jul 20 17:01:13 2015 UTC,"Brother Sport is what worked for me. That and My Girls/Guys Eyes.  Honestly it took a period of months to really get into everything that I like by them at this point. There's just so much variety in their sound that I think it takes time to really analyze and appreciate the art of everything, and you're always thrown a curveball when you move on to the next record. I completely hated Centipede Hz until a year after discovering AC and now it's my favorite album by them. Especially on that LP, there's a lot going on sonically and a lot of layers that can take a while to really hear. For me, and for a lot of other people I'm sure, acquiring that Animal Collective ear was a process.  You definitely need an open mind to start with; if your friends don't possess that quality, then it's probably just not gonna work out."

I listened to it once and it made me feel weird. Months later, I searched for the song adamantly and I was super happy to find it. I ended up falling in love with them a few days after. They've really helped me stay open-minded with different types of music. A few of my friends say AnCo's alright, but I'm skeptical."

I showed MPP to another friend who listened to it whilst high and came back the next day and said 'i can't remember anything except that it was great'. Another I showed Sung Tongs as he doesn't really like electronic music, and he liked it.  So just think about what they like and play the more normal stuff. Or drug them."
AnimalCollective,3dyfec,candyfloose,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:38:28 2015 UTC,"Play them the more accessible, shorter stuff first.  I usually introduce people with Summertime Clothes or Fireworks.  I think Daily Routine is a good song to determine whether or not its a lost cause."

It'll showcase Animal Collective's variety to your friend group. Go anywhere from there, I guess.  (This is how I got my Dad into Animal Collective.)

AnimalCollective,3dyfec,uixuix,1 point,Wed Jul 22 06:52:46 2015 UTC,"I would say start with playing various tracks from Merriweather for them, then gradually mix in tracks from Centipede Hz, then from Strawberry Jam go backwards in there LP discography doing the same thing; if they like what they hear clear to the end or you're well into their discography and so far so good, then you can either let them lose or you can show them their EPs and singles, Avey and Panda's solo stuff, ODDSAC, and any side projects such as Terrestrial Tones or Berserker.  I would say if you get to Sung Tongs and they're still hungry, then you've successfully brought them over.  If they're really passive about MPP and/or Centipede, then there's not a whole lot of hope in pushing further."

There I heard a variety of sounds . . . I heard the possible futures of the new album. They are as follows: a concept album about a journey through a forest that blends raw acoustic guitars and squelching synthesizers; a minimalist electronic album that sounds like a burst of color in a black and white room; the opera of a Frankenstein monster."

Absolutely love it, it's the final word on the Person Pitch sampled 60s loops. God, I miss those days, though. Actually, the true final word is arguably Atlas Sound - Walkabout. God, I miss those days, too. So much joy and carefree imagination in those songs. Greaper is fun and groovy but a little one-paced, it doesn't have the unbridled ecstatic highs, it's more of a cumulative effect. Tomboy is bittersweet, meanwhile, always undercutting the euphoria.

AnimalCollective,3dnlr4,gregphipps37,14,Fri Jul 17 19:00:52 2015 UTC,"As I have mentioned before, ""Reverend Green"" is almost certainly referring to Brad Truax, Animal Collective's road manager for a number of years, a recording assistant for Centipede Hz, and a close personal friend of the band.  Brad Truax released some music on Paw Tracks under the name ""Reverend Green.""  Avey has mentioned For Reverend Green is one of his most vocally demanding songs, which is probably why it tapered off in live performances. Even when it was performed live, the later screaming section was left out - I don't know if that was ever performed live."

AnimalCollective,3dnlr4,wumbology-101,2,Fri Jul 17 21:11:52 2015 UTC,"Im not a huge fan of Strawberry Jam, but fucking damn reverend green, fireworks and #1 is the best progression AnCo has done"
AnimalCollective,3dnlr4,Plutonium-Lore,2,Fri Jul 17 22:23:36 2015 UTC,still the one that gets me the most emotional of all their songs
AnimalCollective,3dnlr4,yesthismessismine,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:20:50 2015 UTC,"Great song, amazing album.  Not a bad song on Strawberry Jam IMO."
AnimalCollective,3dnlr4,thechariot83,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:17:59 2015 UTC,In my top five anco songs for sure. The Rev. Green/ Fireworks back-to-back is by far their best.
AnimalCollective,3dnlr4,nfw22,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:49:28 2015 UTC,Second favorite song by them. Energetic and youthful.
AnimalCollective,3do6ni,AlvinRowDontBlowYp,5,Fri Jul 17 21:40:16 2015 UTC,I'm curious too.  It appears in a few primal scream songs.  Pls send help
AnimalCollective,3do6ni,MyNinthRedditAccount,3,Sat Jul 18 00:19:33 2015 UTC,You mean the high pitched noise? that's a feedback loop. they plugged an amp into itself or something.
AnimalCollective,3do6ni,MrBarryThor12,3,Fri Jul 17 22:00:01 2015 UTC,"Nah I know that I mean the thing in the back ground, like a shimmering sound."
AnimalCollective,3do6ni,stasz92,2,Fri Jul 17 22:00:55 2015 UTC,"It's hard to know exactly what you're talking about, but I'm guessing it's probably a synth. most of the sounds on that track aside from the vocals and the feedback loops were created using synths.  Do you mean the shimmery sound that kinda sounds like a choir and moves from the left channel to the right? I think that's a synth"
AnimalCollective,3dk8ae,logarithmyk,4,Thu Jul 16 23:02:51 2015 UTC,On my visit to NYC I stopped in Other Music where Panda and I think Avey used to work and I got Tomboy! it warped a little but you only hear it on Drone and it makes the song better actually. Also got Pavement's Terror Twilight.
AnimalCollective,3dk8ae,satanicpanic789,2,Fri Jul 17 10:48:56 2015 UTC,"Right on. I've been looking for Tomboy myself I just haven't been lucky yet, good for you with those pick ups, I hope you're enjoying them"

AnimalCollective,3dk8ae,HatofulThread,3,Thu Jul 16 23:46:55 2015 UTC,"Hell yeah dude! Congrats on completing the discog! I think the next AnCo record I want to get is Water Curses. The funny thing is is that I went to the store today to get a different album that I ordered a few weeks ago (Gold Panda's Lucky Shiner) and I decided to look around before I left and I saw Prospect Hummer and I was like, well fuck, now I have to buy this."

AnimalCollective,3di5fw,hiplink,13,Thu Jul 16 17:29:55 2015 UTC,"Actually, I heard Deak was working with Dr. Dre on their new album together, ""Deaktox"".   We're not seeing them again."
AnimalCollective,3di5fw,RockoBOOM,9,Fri Jul 17 06:46:09 2015 UTC,Guys no Deak means no Deak hopping around shredding on the guitar when they perform :((
AnimalCollective,3di5fw,logarithmyk,4,Thu Jul 16 21:23:17 2015 UTC,He may be there still! He played mpp songs during the chz tour
AnimalCollective,3di5fw,Coachpatato,3,Thu Jul 16 21:34:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah but that wouldn't make sense for them to tour this new record with someone who hasn't contributed to it? But then again, I hope I'm dead wrong and am just talking out of my ass"
AnimalCollective,3di5fw,logarithmyk,2,Thu Jul 16 21:40:58 2015 UTC,Yeah you're right. I'd just miss his jumpsuit. Did he tour after mpp?
AnimalCollective,3di5fw,Coachpatato,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:45:05 2015 UTC,"Nah I don't think he did tour with them when/during the MPP tour, if I'm not mistaken."
AnimalCollective,3di5fw,logarithmyk,8,Thu Jul 16 23:20:27 2015 UTC,When did they announce Dickin was back after MPP? would we know at this point  And anyway whatever I'm hoping for the third installment of Avey/Panda playtime
AnimalCollective,3di5fw,kirkom,12,Thu Jul 16 13:57:06 2015 UTC,YES another Avey/Panda album would be awesome (as much as I love Geologist and all his magic). Spirit and Sung Tongs just have this looseness/playfulness/childlike-wonder that the other albums don't quite exactly have (though they have other wonderful qualities)
AnimalCollective,3di5fw,whatwhywhoami,6,Thu Jul 16 14:28:34 2015 UTC,"Geologist is basically confirmed anyway, he has been in a lot of photos recently"
AnimalCollective,3di5fw,hiplink,3,Thu Jul 16 17:29:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he was in one of the photos the studio shared."
AnimalCollective,3di5fw,argylerings,4,Sat Jul 18 17:40:43 2015 UTC,The Deak is a man of sluggish mystique. Maybe he sat this album out to autograph all those pics from his kickstarter Africa trip? Or maybe that solo album? Hopefully it's both.
AnimalCollective,3di5fw,mittromneyshaircut,5,Thu Jul 16 21:56:08 2015 UTC,"Someone commented on the Ancopics instagram that they had talked to Noah at a show last night and he confirmed that it was him, Avey, and Geo on the record. No Deak."
AnimalCollective,3di5fw,HOLYSHITBEARS,6,Sat Jul 18 02:13:41 2015 UTC,no deak means no campfire songs II :(
AnimalCollective,3di5fw,Plutonium-Lore,3,Thu Jul 16 15:10:22 2015 UTC,"As much as I love Deak, it's not like their work has suffered without him. Sung Tongs and MPP are pretty much universally hailed as classics. I won't be too upset either way, and if Deak finally releases his solo album, it's a win-win."
AnimalCollective,3di5fw,JZobel,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:54:39 2015 UTC,According to someone that talked to Noah last night (in the comments of this post) Deak won't be on it #nodeakconfirmed   That means his album will come out soon (maybe)!!!
AnimalCollective,3di5fw,princesa-real,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:03:45 2015 UTC,"I'm hoping no Deak.  Honestly never liked him. I know I'm probably the odd man out here, but I've always gotten this bad vibe from him.  Animal Collective's always seemed to produce their best work without him.  This makes me more excited for the album tbh."
AnimalCollective,3di5fw,argylerings,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:39:40 2015 UTC,"Agreed - probably an unpopular opinion judging by his legendary status on this sub but genuinely never thought very much of him, especially judging by my favourite AnCo albums."

AnimalCollective,3de927,romietomatoes,38,Thu Jul 16 03:23:52 2015 UTC,Isn't this a bit out of the ordinary for AnCo? Don't they usually tour and tinker with the new songs and then go into the studio?   I wonder if we'll get a tour before the album comes out.
AnimalCollective,3de927,dojodawg,24,Wed Jul 15 17:16:21 2015 UTC,"It's pretty much unprecedented actually.  The only full LP that was ever released without extensive touring behind it was Spirit and that was moreso because Avey wrote it all by himself and had planned on releasing it by himself more than not feeling a need to tour.  Every main LP after Spirit had about 80% of the songs played live before the album was released, and most of the EPs as well.  So for the first time, NO ONE, save for people in the band's inner circle, know what is going to be on this album or even what it sounds like."
AnimalCollective,3de927,Superspookyghost,19,Wed Jul 15 19:13:50 2015 UTC,"Another logical statement.  Anco changes shit up constantly, their sound, their tour schedule, their band members, their insturments.  The only constant in change.  AnCo's creative process will not be questioned by me, I trust them."

AnimalCollective,3de927,GewtNingrich,13,Wed Jul 15 16:32:13 2015 UTC,Me too! I was so amazed! Just browsing through the animal collective tag on Instagram and this pops up!
AnimalCollective,3de927,Oldaccountlost,47,Wed Jul 15 16:46:25 2015 UTC,"I only became a fan after Centipede Hz had dropped, so I'm really looking forward to being around for the release of new material"
AnimalCollective,3de927,throwmeout06,6,Wed Jul 15 16:45:20 2015 UTC,"wow that's awesome, how much of their catalog have you checked out since you got into em?"
AnimalCollective,3de927,Oldaccountlost,16,Wed Jul 15 17:52:48 2015 UTC,"All of it haha. I've been a fan for over a year now so I've had the time to delve into it all, I just haven't been around for any new studio releases from the band (I've been around for a couple of the solo project releases, just nothing from the band itself yet).  Edit: all of it with the excepetion of Transverse Temporal Gyrus (as far as I'm aware); I went on the website for that album and just didn't get what I was meant to do"
AnimalCollective,3de927,throwmeout06,11,Wed Jul 15 18:23:36 2015 UTC,"Ah awesome! I got into them around when MPP came out I believe, i was a junior in high school and i was OBSESSED with them for around 2 years straight. Strangely enough Centipede Hz isn't really one of my favorite records by them at all. I haven't been able to totally get into it yet but love a couple individual songs from it so far (Rosie Oh followed by Applesauce is a great combo)"
AnimalCollective,3de927,broff,4,Wed Jul 15 18:41:30 2015 UTC,What's your favorite anco album? As opposed to solo / side projects
AnimalCollective,3de927,Oldaccountlost,5,Wed Jul 15 19:55:57 2015 UTC,"My favorite album of theirs is either Sung Tongs or Spirit They're Gone, Spirit They've Vanished, although I really do enjoy all of their albums (some just a bit more than others)."
AnimalCollective,3de927,broff,3,Wed Jul 15 20:45:57 2015 UTC,Nice sung tongs is probably my favorite but they definitely are all good!

AnimalCollective,3de927,romietomatoes,3,Wed Jul 15 20:20:34 2015 UTC,Same here! I actually got really into them after I saw them live after Centipede Hz in 2012. Three years later and now they're my favorite band

Dunno if it's payola or just pitchfork trying to drum up hits and controversy. Either way, it's working.  I do enjoy some of their reviews though, even some of the more condesending ones. Hell, most of my favorite critics are harsh and condescending as hell (see: Robert christgau, Mark Prindle). But I feel like some people get way too wrapped up in the numbers. And a lot of people probably take it as gospel. Not accusing you of that, by the way."

When I first listened to it I listened to the whole spotify album twice because I liked to much! If you're just looking to test the waters try the song God Only Knows.

AnimalCollective,3dbysk,HatofulThread,10,Wed Jul 15 09:56:39 2015 UTC,"It's a lake/reservoir, too, which supplies water to much of Baltimore. (hence the name ""Loch"")"
AnimalCollective,3dbysk,CitizenOfSmash,10,Wed Jul 15 13:28:24 2015 UTC,"As coasts mentioned, Loch Raven is a neighborhood on the outskirts of Baltimore, named after the Loch Raven Reservoir/Dam that supplies Baltimore's drinking water. All four members of AnCo are from Baltimore, but Panda Bear in particular was only one or two suburbs over in Roland Park.  As to what the song is about, I always interpreted it as being about the unrequited crushes people have in their teens during middle/high school years, and the longing and desperation for ""love"" as you view it at the age of 16.  Loch Raven was probably just a familiar name from their coming of age. I don't know enough about the demographics of Baltimore (nothing, actually) so I can't say if it's some complex metaphor."

AnimalCollective,3d6a30,sblme03,3,Mon Jul 13 21:20:44 2015 UTC,I first saw them at the 2009 ATP in NY which was perfect because it was right after I had heavily gotten into them. I missed Panda's set the night before so I could goto the comedy stage which was sad because it was still Person Pitch era but I think it was probably worth it.   Then I went to a screening and Q&A for ODDSAC  Then I missed an Avey Tare solo show due to my car dying which I've always been pissed about.  Then I saw AC in Prospect Park in 2011 when they started their CHZ stuff.  Then I drove to NYC to see them again in... early 2012 I think? Which was the first show they cancelled in the long run of them where Avey was sick. I found out right when I got to the city (I live 4 hours away).  Then I saw Slasher Flicks second show in NYC in 2013.  Then I saw Panda Bear finally and Slasher Flicks again last year.  So I'm pretty happy with that amount but will always be bummed that I didn't get to see them when they did their big CHZ tour after the album came out and didn't get to that solo Avey show. Anyways this was fun haha. How about you OP?

We used a drum machine though. We were also very inspired by the soundtrack to the shining which has the brilliant ""music for strings percussion and celeste"" on it by bela bartok and well as pieces by ligtei and pendereki and the texas chainsaw massacre movie and soundtrack inspired us alot too. This was all in highschool though these things remain an inspiration."

Attracting new listeners or ANCONAUTS (I just made that up...so cheesy)"

Dave really has a smooth pop sound to the melody and delivery of the verses, it's one of the few tunes of theirs in recent years that you can understand almost all the words on first listen.  The mix is relatively uncluttered and the vocals are pretty clean sounding, compared to CHz or MPP.  If it wasn't in 7/4 with a crazy long intro it might've made a good radio single."

I remember for a long time I had been looking for a psychedelic album that was related to Fall or sounded like Fall (I love the season). I had already listened to MPP before and loved it, but was certainly not obsessed with the band like I was about to become. I remember I was driving home from San Diego with my then girlfriend when it came on the radio and I fell in love with the song immediately. I had my gf look up what album the song came from, and when she said FALL be Kind and showed me the album art I knew that this band was special. From there I branched out into each of their albums reverse chronologically, and it's been one hell of a ride. Ill never forget that memory."

On the post-ChZ tour, they played Peacebone and Cobwebs (a Strawberry Jam era song that was on Water Curses). But that was it, though they started playing Purple Bottle again on that tour.

AnimalCollective,3cuzh4,HereForAliens886,2,Sat Jul 11 03:01:58 2015 UTC,"One of my favorite songs by them, and IMO one of their best. It's such a fun song to sing. I love the creepiness of the opening with the children's voices. The ending to this song really captivated me when I was just getting into AnCo. Those piano lines at the end remind me of stars shooting across the sky. Additionally, those vocals in tandem with the beautiful starry piano notes make for one sweet ending."

Too early to be dropping hints, methinks  I'd be happy to be proven wrong though. So psyched for new AC"

AnimalCollective,3cq6ga,whiteveinthai,3,Thu Jul 9 23:00:45 2015 UTC,Do you mean the very beginning or the slower first part of the song?
AnimalCollective,3cq6ga,Seahoss,3,Thu Jul 9 23:02:20 2015 UTC,The song 'Swimming Field' by Memory Tapes seems very derivative/evocative of that side of Panda Bear. Weary harmonies.

AnimalCollective,3cq6ga,noraamitt,2,Fri Jul 10 12:22:01 2015 UTC,"You might want to pick up some early Scott Walker albums, since Panda Bear sampled from ""Always Coming Back to You"" from Scott for the intro to ""Take Pills"". All of the 'Scott' (Scott 2, Scott 3) albums of his are in that loungey, baroque kind of style. Panda also samples the last line of a Scott Walker song in ""Laughed for a World Filled with Fantasy,"" which sadly never made it onto Person Pitch."

Aside from the fact it creates an awesome transition into Monkey Riches, I have nothing much good to say about this song. It just goes on way too long and even if it were shorter it wouldn't be very interesting. Answer to this used to be Whaddit I Done but I've warmed up to that song bigtime."
AnimalCollective,3cnr7p,DisgruntledPorcupine,6,Fri Jul 10 05:31:57 2015 UTC,"New Town Burnout is one of my favourites. Noah coming home from work, his body aching ""No more at the wrong time, No more at the wrong place"" Those massive chords sound so heavy, almost wet, they sound like weight on someones shoulders. The whole thing has this exhausted, desperate sound to it. The childrens choir in the middle? Forget it. Their little hooting relieves the tension of those massive chords, and the cymbal crashes shimmer and wash over you...your exhausted body and mind. Listen to it loud."

AnimalCollective,3cnr7p,travel__time,18,Thu Jul 9 15:41:16 2015 UTC,"I agree, and I'm not stopping others from being critical. That's just my take. There are Animal Collective songs I enjoy far less than others, and will skip under most circumstances. But every once in a while, depending on the set and setting, one of these songs will be perfect.   I never gave Visiting Friends much thought and usually skipped it until I was in a weird emotional state visiting friends in New Hampshire after a recent breakup and coming down off 2 straight days on LSD. Didn't sleep, went for a walk at 6 in the morning in the freezing cold, put on shuffle and Visiting Friends was the first song to come on. I kept it on, and it ended up being one of the more cathartic moments of my life. I had been drinking far too much following my breakup, and that moment in time helped me take the first and most important step towards moving on with my life and compartmentalizing my emotions and heartbreak. Visiting Friends happened to be the soundtrack, and it's one of my favorite songs ever at this point.   Similarly, Two Sails On A Sound got me through driving through an ice storm in what ended up being the worst driving conditions I've ever experienced. I was on the brink of a freak out, and that song centered me and calmed me down quite a bit.   So that's kind of a roundabout way of explaining what I mean when I say ""Each song has its place."" Who knows, I might be in a rough spot somewhere down the road and Penguin Penguin could help me turn my shit around."
AnimalCollective,3cnr7p,noraamitt,4,Thu Jul 9 15:52:03 2015 UTC,"Amazing post man. Those are 2 of my favorite Animal Collective tracks. In fact, I just listened to ""Visiting Friends"". Both are powerful songs, both are very immersive. They definitely make you reflex and think, or just relax. I love that quality about their music.  I sort of agree with you about their music regarding ""worst songs"". Some songs completely grow on you out of nowhere or become appropriate to a certain setting. Can never predict when one day your least favorite song will all the sudden be something significant, or simply pop in your head and click with you out of the blue."
AnimalCollective,3cnr7p,whiteveinthai,1 point,Fri Jul 10 08:42:04 2015 UTC,"Very true, I can turn to Animal Collective's music for introspection and intense analysis (often times, over analysis) and dig into all the textures and blips on the radar. Or I can lay back, turn my mind off, and let it wash over me with equally resounding results."
AnimalCollective,3cnr7p,noraamitt,4,Fri Jul 10 14:58:47 2015 UTC,"Ahhh, I completely agree. My bad for making false assumptions."
AnimalCollective,3cnr7p,travel__time,3,Thu Jul 9 16:05:54 2015 UTC,"No worries bud! I definitely didn't take it the wrong way to begin with, figured it'd probably be better if I expanded on my original thought."
AnimalCollective,3cnr7p,noraamitt,2,Thu Jul 9 16:07:25 2015 UTC,"Ha, that's cool that Two Sails on a Sound of all things helped calm you down. I can imagine its subtle beauty cloaked in all the noise and discord sort of mirroring the snowstorm in a way. For 99.9999% of other people that song would probably make the situation worse."
AnimalCollective,3cnr7p,Seahoss,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:46:59 2015 UTC,"Haha exactly, I have no idea how/why it calmed me down. Was probably able to get lost in the subtitles/soundscape. But I totally agree that most other people would turn into balls of anxiety even more so while listening to Two Sails on a Sound.   But then again, I can relax and take a load off while listening to Black Dice, so maybe I'm just insane."
AnimalCollective,3cnr7p,noraamitt,2,Fri Jul 10 14:53:23 2015 UTC,I know what you mean.  Its hard to say which songs are good and bad because they don't have alot of singles.  Alot of their songs make more sense in relation to the songs that comes before and after it.
AnimalCollective,3cnr7p,doctordonydoctor,4,Sun Jul 12 20:28:20 2015 UTC,Moo Rah Rah Rain and Daffy Duck are two songs that i feel like just go on and on and don't add anything to the atmosphere of the album's they're in. I never skip them but i find myself waiting intently for them to be over lol  edit: Originally wrote Queen In My Pictures instead of Moo Rah Rah Rain. oops! I confused the two
AnimalCollective,3cnr7p,babycanteen,4,Fri Jul 10 04:49:34 2015 UTC,another daffy duck mention? you guys are breaking my heart

AnimalCollective,3cnr7p,DisgruntledPorcupine,2,Sat Jul 11 01:13:25 2015 UTC,I find Queen In My Pictures' intro is a bit long but after the first 4 or so minutes it's one of the prettiest things ever.

AnimalCollective,3cnr7p,DisgruntledPorcupine,2,Fri Jul 10 05:35:55 2015 UTC,IMO Daffy Duck is just as emotional as Banshee Beat.
AnimalCollective,3cnr7p,zilgen,4,Sun Jul 12 07:43:19 2015 UTC,"Not to sound all hipster-y, but I think AnCo is an ""album"" group, and that's the way their music is meant to be listened to - as a whole.

They've taught me about melody, sound design, experimentation, the importance of simplicity, never getting comfortable, the list goes on and on. If I erase their music from my mind, I erase so much knowledge. And it took me so much time listening (SO MUCH TIME) and then trying to do what they do to get to where I am, and even still I often ask myself ""Fuck...how are they SO GOOD? how the HELL do they do it?""  That's probably the only thing about them that frustrates me...Just, how are they so damn good at EVERYTHING?"

But whenever I was listening to AnCo then, discovering what would become my favorite band, my those small moments have become nostalgic. And that's weird to happen in just two years. But it's the same nostalgic feeling of other more distant and typical triggers of nostalgia. Something about the sound and childish nature of some of AnCo's stuff has an effect on this I think."

AnimalCollective,3ch1vo,billybigboobs,10,Tue Jul 7 21:21:31 2015 UTC,"If you're going to make music, you ought to make your own stuff and draw influence from artists like AnCo, not try to emulate them. It's fun to find your own unique sound.  But to answer your question, the first step is getting a synthesizer and a digital audio workstation (DAW). Lots of DAWs come with digital synthesizers already packaged, but analogs are also fun. If you get an analog synth make sure it's MIDI compatible so you can plug it straight into a computer or other hardware. Once you get a DAW, tinkering with it until you have a decent understanding of all the features is the way to go. Tutorials are all over the internet and are very helpful!  For technique, many of their songs revolve around arpeggios, loops, and samples. A lot of it is distorted. I've also gotten the impression that they have a unique songwriting process, though it's a mystery because of how they keep stuff under wraps. So you'll have to figure that out yourself I suppose.  If it's the originality of AnCo you're after, then welcome to the club. I think the best way to sound as unique as AnCo is to just fuck around with what you have at your disposal. The other day I was putting together an ambient track and achieved a realistic thunder sound by pitching down the sound of a door slamming and layering it on top of itself at different speeds. Another time I got this really cool melody by typing ""hello world"" on a keyboard, where every key correlates to a note. The creative drive behind AnCo is what makes them so great, the way they think outside the box about certain things. If you ever get stuck, try something stupid because it might work!  Good luck friend. Music is fun to make."

AnimalCollective,3ch1vo,Stanshant,12,Wed Jul 8 13:58:02 2015 UTC,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMPJY0-wAqQ  Thats a video of a dude making fun of Animal Collective by hitting one note to make an AC song but its pretty accurate.  A lot of their songs are based around a simple arpeggio played quickly and then adding a lot of depth to it through minor tweaks and adding other crazy sounds. Triplets tend to give a pretty AnCo feel to a song in my opinion  I would say one of the most important aspects of AnCo is that each song has a really unique soundscape, you have to use a lot of similar but not same elements to create a noise bigger than its parts. And they are reallllly good at finding sounds that aren't similar at all but still have like one tiny connecting element that allows it to fit in the song. All of that isn't really something you can learn, its more just a feeling you get from the sounds  As for instrumentation you'd be surprised at how many of the crazy sounds are just guitars or synths using an array of pedals. Though geologist exclusively plays a sampler and they've said that a lot of sounds on jam and mwpp come from sampling their guitars/pianos and playing it back  Another important element is their beats/rhythms, though I can't say much about that. Just that they do unique beats, not just basic up/down beats like 80% of popular music.  And lastly the song structure itself. They almost entirely ignore the standard verse-chorus-verse-chorus shit and even when they have repeating sections they can't really be referred to as a chorus or refrain."
AnimalCollective,3ch1vo,MrBarryThor12,9,Wed Jul 8 00:08:30 2015 UTC,"""A lot of their songs are based around a simple arpeggio played quickly and then adding a lot of depth to it through minor tweaks and adding other crazy sounds.""  Hmm, not sure about this at all. #1 prominently features arpeggios, My Girls prominently features arpeggios. I may have forgotten one more. Perhaps you're not sure what arpeggio means but you've got an idea about how their music is often very repetitive. Nevertheless, that's a very reductive statement.   Also, a good 95% of their music features very standard time signatures and drum patterns. Yes, there's often some delay trickery and a certain fidgety triplet approach to give it a different energy, as well as lots of tom and rim work in place of kick/snare but they're not rhythmically challenging. I would say that they're creative, not unique.   The vast majority of their songs, especially from Sung Tongs onwards, are structured according to trad. arr. tropes. Again, they play with these conventions, e.g. Noah is fond of drawn out outro sections, like Chores and Daily Routine among others, extending into what almost appears to be a different song, and which sometimes just becomes a different song! Dave uses bridges in an unusual way, taking the song in different directions before finding a circuitous route back to the verse or chorus, such as in Today's Supernatural or Applesauce, but these uniquely AC elements only work because they are bedded in received songwriting conventions.   In response to the OP, I find the question absurd, basically. If you want to dissect the tropes of Animal Collective to try to reproduce something similar, you're not going to create anything except a very pale imitation. The quality of their music comes from an ever changing combination of members, approaches and instrumentation. It's that spirit of individual expression and urge to explore new possibilities which defines their sound. Listen and be inspired but don't try to imitate."

AnimalCollective,3cd6bf,Rossegut,2,Wed Jul 8 05:06:37 2015 UTC,This is exactly what my friend said about In The Flowers :(
AnimalCollective,3cdv05,SoBrokeISmell,10,Tue Jul 7 03:35:25 2015 UTC,They got high in the woods once.
AnimalCollective,3cdv05,flashbohemia,2,Tue Jul 7 03:59:42 2015 UTC,What are you gonna do go into the foreesssttttt
AnimalCollective,3cdv05,Tom_Anks,7,Wed Jul 8 16:34:28 2015 UTC,"Animal Collective's music is universal, anyone who is open enough to listen to it unbiasedly will enjoy it. You can put on any of their albums and forget it's playing then tune into it and admire how true it feels."
AnimalCollective,3cdv05,imfromtheshelter,9,Tue Jul 7 13:16:41 2015 UTC,"Simply put for me, they're fucking weird. Never have I found a group of humans do something so close to how I feel, or didn't know I felt until I listened to ""hey light."" Also, you either are a diehard fan or you dont listen to them. There doesn't seem to be a middleground with them like a lot of ""alternative"" bands. I'm just really happy that they're alive & I can be alive to witness what they do."
AnimalCollective,3cdv05,prisonforkids,4,Tue Jul 7 18:26:07 2015 UTC,"Because, more than almost any other band, their music makes me think: how the hell did they come up with this?"
AnimalCollective,3cdv05,LustreForce,5,Tue Jul 7 20:40:36 2015 UTC,They make me feel such an intense euphoria. It's incredible and almost impossible to understand that I can get a dopamine fuelled rush from just music.
AnimalCollective,3cdv05,EcstasyAndMerlot,5,Tue Jul 7 21:02:58 2015 UTC,"Something about the way they craft and manipulate their sounds really hits me emotionally like little else can. It's like the synths and stuff establish the basic feeling really well and the lyrics are there to tell the story of how the brain found itself in such a place.  A lot of the themes connect to me really well, too. Nostalgia, pining for youth and ignorant bliss, realizing that it'll never be the same again, and anxiety about not being prepared (I'm Not, certainly!) when everything seems to be flying at you. Other bands cover it, but abstract things like emotions need really unique ways to be expressed. Their noisier songs reach right down into my occasional need to scream which life's circumstances and society's bullshit necessitate, but which politeness denies us. It just all comes off very genuine and inspired."
AnimalCollective,3cdv05,HatofulThread,4,Wed Jul 8 05:25:31 2015 UTC,"They're P good  Honestly I don't know why I love them so much, their music just gets to my soul."
AnimalCollective,3cdv05,candyfloose,3,Tue Jul 7 04:48:35 2015 UTC,Each album has its own personality which sounds completely unique. AnCo spins a special kind of magic that hasn't been replicated by anyone.
AnimalCollective,3cdv05,TylerAM,3,Wed Jul 8 00:50:08 2015 UTC,"Better to overjoy some and piss off others than to moderately amuse everyone.  Most music, radio music today espeicially, seems very confined and restricted to what most who listen to the radio expect to here, and the average person really doesn't like to be caught off guard by something so radically different in taste, so most music stays in its own restraints.  AnCo seems to have eradicated this border entirely and insist on diving deep into what territories of music have yet to be explored.  Some people will simply never be able to get into AnCo, but those that can are usually quite loyal to what they've found."
AnimalCollective,3cdv05,BurstingFlares,2,Thu Jul 9 07:28:36 2015 UTC,"Only certain albums make me feel the way AnCo does. I honestly do believe that I just love how experimental and unafriad they are to go anywhere with anything. Even if it is just noise on certain parts of their discography, it's organized in a way that I get weirdly attracted to it."
AnimalCollective,3cdv05,mrwillster,2,Wed Jul 8 00:32:18 2015 UTC,"For me, AnCo represents what it really means to make music for music's sake. In all of my listenings of hundreds of other bands, I have yet to find a sound so pure to the meaning of music and art as AnCo. In other music, I can hear the money, the production solely for profit. With AnCo, I have never heard money, all I've ever heard is pure music and thought, emotion and rhythm. To me, their music embodies everything I want in music, and so I remain collected.  Oh, and they're pretty dope to smoke dope to."
AnimalCollective,3cdv05,MightyGabe,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:14:48 2015 UTC,"Because of how they create their music in so many unique ways, and it always sounds fantastic. I've grown tired of the incessant auto-tunes and shallow 'country' love songs everywhere, so Animal Collective was a great discovery. When I first heard them, I was amazed. I had never heard anything like it. I love the sounds that they can create, and some of their lyrics are very touching, as well. It comes as no surprise that not very many people like AnCo; because they do things that are considered unusual with their music and unfortunately, not many people are open-minded enough to try new things. It's a shame."

AnimalCollective,3c2fxn,wilandhugs,4,Tue Jul 7 07:03:52 2015 UTC,He was in a picture on Avey's instagram not too long ago (kind of long ago but still relatively recent).
AnimalCollective,3c2fxn,Oldaccountlost,2,Sat Jul 4 15:49:51 2015 UTC,That fills me with more hope
AnimalCollective,3c1gnh,gregphipps37,15,Fri Jul 3 21:58:45 2015 UTC,"""Your mom and I will help you dance through your bad weather"" has always been one of my favorite AnCo lines.   Such a fantastic song."
AnimalCollective,3c1gnh,cmcb21,15,Fri Jul 3 22:10:33 2015 UTC,"This song is one of the reasons I love this band. They could've stacked Strawberry Jam with another chugging experimental-pop banger (like Fireworks, Reverend Green, Peacebone, etc) but instead they offer up this weird, sorta Steve Reich-y piece of atmosphere. Then, they decide to play it on mainstream TV?: BALLS OF STEEL."
AnimalCollective,3c1gnh,prisonforkids,7,Sat Jul 4 00:28:42 2015 UTC,"I always the thought the line was ""Please respect, the candles and Aladdin""  But anyways, I think this track is amazing how the arpeggiation in the beginning seems to bounce around and then when the tambourine comes in its just like ""Ohhhhhh my Godddddd.... it's so gooooood"". Definitely one of my favourites off of SJ which in itself is filled with some of the most amazing AnCo songs in history (Cuckoo Cuckoo, Fireworks etc)"
AnimalCollective,3c1gnh,cocopuffschan,7,Fri Jul 3 23:17:28 2015 UTC,"Looking at the lyrics and the dialogue between Avey and Noah, the song is clearly written from the perspective of a father; I wonder if this is Dave's way of writing another song for Noah. (first song being Flesh Canoe)  "" Avey - Young love is fine, just please respect the candles as they line""  "" Noah - I won't waste time, I won't waste mine.""  It's almost like Avey is trying to help his friend through a rough time (on their next album, noah is trying to help Matt, so its an abstract show of maturity).  And avey changing his voice could almost be seen as a shadowy, ghost figure... in this case, the father of Noah?  I'm prolly wrong."
AnimalCollective,3c1gnh,LastPachyderm,7,Sat Jul 4 15:18:10 2015 UTC,"best song on strawberry jam, what a magical journey it is"
AnimalCollective,3c1gnh,roopn,3,Sat Jul 4 04:54:30 2015 UTC,"Really great song, one of my favorites off Strawberry Jam. The fact that they preformed this song live on Conan is also still incredible to me."
AnimalCollective,3c1gnh,Oldaccountlost,3,Sat Jul 4 14:45:58 2015 UTC,"one of my favorites. this song really helped me get thru two winters ago. it has some kind of haunted christmas sound for me, which definitely is a good thing. its also the perfect comedown to fireworks' manic ass energy-- its not a bummer, but what it lacks in energy it makes for with its goofiness. out of all the songs on the album i feel like it sticks out like a sore thumb but its a good thumb"
AnimalCollective,3c1gnh,cuttlefishin,2,Mon Jul 6 22:31:06 2015 UTC,"One of my favorite songs off of Strawberry Jam. I really love the whole father and son scenario in the song. From Avey's creepy vocals to Panda's awesome crooning in the background, the song just works so beautifully. And who can't love that synthesizer. When I first started listening to Strawberry Jam, #1 reminded me so much of Pink Floyd's On the Run. But once I got past that, the song really started to click for me and I love it so much."
AnimalCollective,3c1gnh,sco703,2,Sat Jul 4 20:29:23 2015 UTC,I've never been able to understand any of the lyrics but its still my favorite song off of SJ. So dreamy and ethereal hnnnnnggg
AnimalCollective,3c1ylp,good-country,9,Sat Jul 4 00:36:59 2015 UTC,"I wish people loved untitled the way I did. Such an emotional song, deserves higher than 8."
AnimalCollective,3c1ylp,IsAnyoneHungry,9,Sat Jul 4 03:16:25 2015 UTC,"Agreed, Untitled and Spirit They're Vanished are too low. I'd put them at 3-4 at least."
AnimalCollective,3c1ylp,Glankler,4,Sat Jul 4 08:56:06 2015 UTC,"It got the highest rating of all the instrumental interlude-ish tracks. I mean it's awesome, but the actual songs are so flawless that I think it has to place lower."
AnimalCollective,3c1ylp,DisgruntledPorcupine,2,Sun Jul 5 02:59:11 2015 UTC,"yes! always loved Untitled, such a haunting and beautiful song. But I've just accepted that the distorted screaming is going to turn most people off of it. I would have loved to see it ranked higher but i didn't expect it to get any higher than 6 at best."
AnimalCollective,3c1ylp,Seahoss,3,Tue Jul 7 03:35:42 2015 UTC,Two people put Bat You'll Fly last? What the eff?
AnimalCollective,3c1ylp,Seahoss,1 point,Sat Jul 4 13:53:50 2015 UTC,what's even crazier is that two people also ranked Alvin Row last.

AnimalCollective,3c1ylp,Superspookyghost,2,Tue Jul 7 14:31:47 2015 UTC,La Rapet and STV are too low. Otherwise not too bad.
AnimalCollective,3c1ylp,DisgruntledPorcupine,2,Sun Jul 5 02:57:49 2015 UTC,"Honestly, any combination of 1-7 wouldn't shock me."

My favorite tracks are Meet The Light Child and Throwin' The Round Ball. Meet The Child Light always lets me catch energy (how I refer to goosebumps).

AnimalCollective,3bwitb,Seahoss,3,Fri Jul 3 14:23:58 2015 UTC,"My gut tells me this is just them screwing around in the studio. But it could just as easily be an intro or interlude in a song. Think about BONEFISH in Peacebone... it doesn't seem like it could be a musical thing, but AnCo made it work in the context of a song. I don't know what to expect with them.

Basically it just goes from Eb maj to G min then back to Eb maj. Then it goes Eb maj to G min and then to Bb maj.

AnimalCollective,3b7zvq,WoofWoofKats,1 point,Fri Jun 26 23:34:54 2015 UTC,"Fairly new to guitar, I understand the back and forth from Bb to Gm. But for the other part (the very first few chords played in the song) I'm not sure what the chords are. The website says a 'descending arpeggio' in Eb. Not sure what chords that is or what that means haha."
AnimalCollective,3b7zvq,capnrafiki,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:28:54 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately there's not an easy translation on the guitar. The descending arpeggio comes from plucking the strings backward from the highest to lowest on the autoharp, which has a lot more strings than a guitar. That's what gives it that type of sound, and it makes the chords sound a lot more complex."

AnimalCollective,3ajet8,cmcb21,1 point,Sun Jun 21 11:29:43 2015 UTC,"Agreed, I think the best songs on that album are actually the ones that were already released. Actually, I think all his older work is better. His early singles and the Gil Scott Heron are godly imo. The new album is good but not godly."

I heard this song for the first time while I was wearing headphones, and was blown away when the synth kicked in around the halfway point.

AnimalCollective,3ag1a6,Rekk_Les,11,Fri Jun 19 21:13:01 2015 UTC,Summertime Clothes!  Gotta thank the game Skate 3 for that. Started looking up their other singles after that and I got hooked.
AnimalCollective,3ag1a6,BornAgainZombie,4,Fri Jun 19 23:43:29 2015 UTC,Summertime Clothes for me as well when I was 16 or 17. I can't remember how I found the song but soon after I went through their entire discography and they instantly became my favorite non hip-hop band.
AnimalCollective,3ag1a6,ditchmysocks,2,Sat Jun 20 12:05:41 2015 UTC,"Summertime Clothes here too. Honestly (obviously) heard My Girls first, then started listening to the rest of MPP and quickly starting throwing Summertime Clothes on repeat. MPP was the gateway album for me."

It was a long while ago, but my brother was listening to it on his laptop without headphones during a car ride in Hawaii. I loved how ambient yet active it was, and how it fit with the surroundings. I was slightly disappointed when I found that most of their music was not like LR, but after some listening it quickly grew on me and after a while, they became my favorite band / collective of all time."

Many, many, many, many weeks were spent playing MPP constantly. Then I dove into the rest of their discography and found heaven."

I was a sophomore in high school, driving home from soccer practice -- a beautiful day, and I was listening through the whole album Feels. This song comes on, and I was just cruising along at 45 in a 55.  ""I take my..... time.""  I instantly had chills down my spine. I never felt more connected to a group of musicians than at that moment, up to that point in my life. My lifestyle and outlook on life changed after that. AnCo, and that song in particular, helped me look at my goals in life as things that are intrinsic to my nature, as opposed to external and outside of myself. Every step I take towards these goals is something I can take in and relish. My reward system went from ""carrot and stick"" to  a constant source of inspiration that I derive from the people and the environment that surrounds me.  And that's why I take my time."

I'd listen to a couple songs off feels and Strawberry Jam every now and again and be amazed, but never bothered getting into them properly. Then MPP happened and Animal Collective were everywhere, and I was like ""waiiiit a minute, I know those guys..."" And that was that for me. I've seen them four times since then, and solo Panda once, and they're unquestionably my favorite band. Kinda can't believe it's been this long."

AnimalCollective,3a0cr8,doctordonydoctor,26,Tue Jun 16 06:07:56 2015 UTC,"Avey's total influence on pretty much every Animal Collective song cannot be understated, particularly up until MPP.  I'd say that the three best examples of Avey's thematic style are:  Grass - Reflection of Avey's most prominent theme (growing up, finding happiness as an adult, losing childhood innocence) fanciful imagery that doesn't make a lot of physical sense (""pretty little femur sitting in my cherry dream boat""), twinges of lost innocence and sadness intertwined with love and moving forward (""It's like the apple eating people that we once were aren't there Did they empty out their pockets and debase their younger faces And you must make sure you're happy when you leave your summer places""), as well as a powerful shouting chorus. See also: Unsolved Mysteries, Peacebone, Turn Into Something, For Reverend Green, Winter Wonder Land, Did You See the Words  Good Lovin' Outside - Avey's early ""pure"" love songs are pretty matter-of-fact. They are full of action (""I've kissed your face twice"";""We can roll in moss all night"") as well as kind of featuring a kind of private actions between the narrator and the subject of his song - kind of a glimpse deep into the personal life of the narrator. ""I’m wearing your shirt So act like a kid, don't pretend to hit me 'Cause we act in the funniest ways"" See also: Essplode, Flesh Canoe, and for a shitty, watery version, Bluish  Kids on Holiday - While Avey has somewhat gained a reputation for writing super fanciful imagery, even to the point of being almost nonsense (""Tennyson tubs, Avey?!""), he is also able to invoke powerful emotions through ""observational"" songs. Kids on Holiday comes from the strain of an intense travel/touring schedule in the early days of Animal Collective - and it is nothing but essentially people watching at an airport. It blends into this big list of details - but whether or not it is supposed to be sad, hopeful, longing, or some combination of it all is left entirely up to the listener's interpretation. While Avey doesn't do a lot of ""pure observation"" or ""pure experience"" songs, (Moonjock, On a Highway), he springboards mundane events coupled with fanciful imagery combined into one, playing off of and contrasting one another. For example; Fireworks, Lion in a Coma (a walk through Chinatown), What Would I Want Sky? (""give me some money, stop daydreamin' dude"").  There are a lot of songs I would say are also very reflective of Avey's style (Purple Bottle, Banshee Beat, We Tigers, Cuckoo Cuckoo, a lot of stuff pre-Sung Tongs) thematically, but is pretty sonically unique and he's rather distant from his days of Spirit and Danse."
AnimalCollective,3a0cr8,Superspookyghost,12,Tue Jun 16 10:03:12 2015 UTC,"I think this is a pretty great analysis, but you failed to highlight another important aspect of Avey: His more somber/reflective/depressed/darker theme. Obviously Down There most notably, but songs like Street Flash, Cuckoo Cuckoo, and safer fall into this category as well."
AnimalCollective,3a0cr8,Gr33nhouse,6,Tue Jun 16 17:38:37 2015 UTC,"Great analysis.   On an unrelated note, I think the line from Grass: ""Pretty little femur sitting in my cherry dream boat, I'd be sad if your rejected from my hip bone and my knee"", is literally just about his girl sitting on his lap in a boat."
AnimalCollective,3a0cr8,Seahoss,3,Tue Jun 16 21:04:22 2015 UTC,"I think he started out obsessed with highly conceptual noise music but as he got older, became interested with the challenge of turning noises into constructed pieces. I'd say the best representation of New Avey is Moonjock-into-Todays Supernatural.  Rockn out while keeping it intense, layered, and above all, interesting"
AnimalCollective,3a0cr8,stasz92,6,Tue Jun 16 21:55:05 2015 UTC,The new track he dropped a few months ago is A1 Avey imo
AnimalCollective,3a0cr8,simplypeaches,3,Tue Jun 16 14:27:46 2015 UTC,"I'd say 'Peacebone' is definitely one of Avey's shining moments, even though it's mostly just seen in the way he sings. I feel like the chaos of that song really shows off what he's ""all about""."

I just love how the songs build into this complex soundscape, with strange noises and staccato drumming, it's all very hypnotic. The songs just sound full, like every available second is brimming with sound."
AnimalCollective,39vzaq,kelajes,12,Mon Jun 15 07:10:10 2015 UTC,"It is a bit of a grower album, I concur but the exciting, frequently tribal and terrifying mood and crazy distortion makes it such a gem in their discography. Infant Dressing Table into Panic is one of the best transitions they have ever done and I love how there are echoes of the album in some of their later work; Loch Raven, We Tigers and even #1 to some extent all share themes and ideas with the album. Irrelevant, but it also sounds badass on vinyl!"
AnimalCollective,39vzaq,ancoletsgo,5,Mon Jun 15 10:14:09 2015 UTC,"Very true about the connection to their other albums. Even though hcti as a whole sounds different, the band's approach to music has in many ways been very consistent across albums"

AnimalCollective,39vzaq,mendozr,2,Tue Jun 16 23:57:50 2015 UTC,I think it's a really creepy record. I feel like I'm watching a horror movie when I listen to this record.
AnimalCollective,39w11l,ohnastyrobo,9,Mon Jun 15 06:48:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Avey's background vocals are definitely different than Panda's part during that verse.  Panda's verse is something along the lines of  ""You've got to weigh what he say/said/says to help you shape the way you play  You've got to get rid of the more conservative habits of your mind""  During the ""...You've got to get rid"" part Avey says something along the lines of ""Get rid of the mourning and have a real good time"" which lines up almost exactly with Panda's verse. (Avey saying time as Panda is saying mind).  Now, Avey definitely says something else during the first part of that verse too, but after poring over many live versions, early and later, we were never able to isolate it. I'm pretty sure the backing vocal on the album version is the same as the song as it existed in 2007, but it's just impossible to hear over Panda's, as Avey almost mumbles it as compared to the very distinctive ""get rid of the mourning and have a real good time.""  https://youtu.be/NncmILE_7mQ?t=197  https://youtu.be/wEIhXPK0TSM?t=108  If any of you are able to crack the case, be my guest!"
AnimalCollective,39w11l,Superspookyghost,3,Mon Jun 15 09:37:18 2015 UTC,"Isn't Avey just singing the same lines as Panda in the first part, stressing every odd word?   Also, I thought for the longest time that it was ""You've got to weigh what he said"" but am fairly certain now that it's ""You've got his ways and what he said"".   It's also probably not accurate to say the album version is consistent with how they were playing it in '07 seeing as the coda is different."
AnimalCollective,39w11l,Seahoss,3,Tue Jun 16 20:57:02 2015 UTC,"I am totally the opposite, I thought for forever it was ""you've got his ways and what he said"" and shifted toward ""you've got to weigh what he said"" - that being said there is no way to know for sure.   https://youtu.be/z9wj919aWpQ?t=163 it's pretty clear Avey is saying something else entirely. That verse is the same as 2007, and the same as the album version, although it isn't so faded and drowned out in live performances so it's a little easier to pinpoint.  Throughout most of the song, Avey echoes something that Panda says or something very similar (""Support your brother, open up your, keep it real keep it real shout out, you've got a real good shot, etc""  You're right, they did change the last verse from 2007 to the album version.  The original version was something like ""Until you're fully grown, you've got a real good shot, you've got so much inside, ??????????????""  The album version changes the last two lines to ""won't help to hold inside or no help to hold inside, keep it real keep it real shout out.""  There's still a lot of little question marks - people insist the line is ""You're halfway to fully grown"" but I have never heard that in any version of the song, I still maintain it's until or till. Nothing really changes the meaning of the song however, but for people who like lyrics like I do, the little things matter. But I have heard this song in so many forms over the past 7 years that it's hard for me to try to interpret lyrics without personal clout."
AnimalCollective,39w11l,Superspookyghost,1 point,Tue Jun 16 21:26:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Avey is singing something there for sure but it's impossible to make out. I still think best bet is that he's basically mumbling Panda's lines at that part. Basically singing ""weigh/ways... said... shape... play"". Something like that.   Original version is ""Until fully grown, you've got a real good shot, you've got so much inside, let it come, let it come right out"".    I've seen so many different takes on the album version over the years. Keep it real/give a real/give me real. I think I've settled on ""Keep it real, give a real shout out"".    I pretty much use the CA lyrics wiki as a rule of thumb.    Now that you mention it, I don't think I've heard a ""halfway to fully grown"" version before either. That's absolutely not what they're saying on the album though so that line had to have come from somewhere, right?    I'm the same as you. In fact, it's one thing I love about this band: the constantly shifting lyrics. Older versions of songs have different personalities. It's a lot of fun unearthing them."
AnimalCollective,39w11l,Seahoss,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:14:17 2015 UTC,Hey thanks! I honestly never even heard Avey's part until about a week ago when I finally listened to it on some nice headphones.

AnimalCollective,39l3t3,Snowy_crack,14,Fri Jun 12 14:12:00 2015 UTC,"First of all, it is kidney stone. Don't let other people tell you otherwise.  Now, as to what it means, it's pretty complex like the rest of the song.  I think it has two meanings. The verse featuring this line (and pretty much the entire point of Banshee Beat) is the narrator coming to grips with the end of a relationship. This verse features the narrator kind of saying - ""though I'm going through this whirlwind of negative emotions, having such strong feelings makes me feel human and alive.""   Confusion's not a kidney stone in my brain probably has two meanings. The first, in line with the rest of the verse, is the fact that though the narrator is confused, it isn't causing him any mental anguish. A kidney stone is known as being a condition very high on the physical pain scale. So the fact that the narrator is confused (going through a breakup, moving on in life, etc) is not a source of a ""mental kidney stone"" for him.  The second meaning, in tandem with the next line, is probably more like ""maybe it was never meant to be at all."" While in the relationship, there were feelings of doubt or confusion. But they weren't prominent like a kidney stone. Which lead to the narrator in the next line ""If we're miscommunicating, do we feel the same"" kind of saying ""maybe this relationship wasn't as good as I thought, or wasn't mean to be in the way that I thought"" which makes it easier for him to accept the end of, and is kind of a hindsight moment. ""I should have seen this coming."""
AnimalCollective,39l3t3,Superspookyghost,4,Fri Jun 12 22:48:12 2015 UTC,"to add on to your first point: what does a person do when they have a kidney stone? they pass it, get it out of their system. but this confusion the narrator is feeling isn't a kidney stone, it's not a temporary problem, he'll never be able to pass it out of his system. he'll never make sense of this shit, it's going to be with him forever now. not in a painful way, but still present."
AnimalCollective,39l3t3,good-country,5,Sat Jun 13 00:53:28 2015 UTC,"Very astute observation. Feels is, to put it simply, about growing up and treading the line between child and adult.  This experience that is mentioned in Banshee Beat, as well as all others, are what makes up a person. You are a sum of your experiences, and carry the experience forever, even if it doesn't hurt you anymore."
AnimalCollective,39l3t3,Superspookyghost,1 point,Sat Jun 13 18:07:00 2015 UTC,"i feel like he means that it isn't a physical thing in your brain. like it just comes from a circumstantial thing. because after that he says, ""if we're miscommunicating do we feel the same?"" you aren't never guna get over it because it's not something wrong with your brain. it's just a momentary case of people having a lack of connection and will be remedied once everyone is on the same page"

AnimalCollective,39l3t3,anti-chief,5,Fri Jun 12 15:41:23 2015 UTC,"That's a good point, but he says confusion is NOT a kidney stone, so would it be making his thoughts clearer? Who knows?   See my reply to snowy_crack for what I think about candy store"
AnimalCollective,39l3t3,roopn,4,Fri Jun 12 15:59:10 2015 UTC,"So confusion is cloudy mystery, the unknown. Kidney stones are painful and limit flow. So if mystery of the unknown is not a painful limited flow then knowledge and truth IS painful and limiting. While confusion flows like a river into every crevice of your brain.  Followed by, ""are we miscommunicating, do we feel the same?"" Perhaps, with the romantic view of the song, this confusion that is being felt isn't because they're miscommunicating; Rather, the situation is, in fact, confusing. Like the woman is telling him that he's not getting it or not listening. Whereas, he actually is listening and it actually is confusing.  Just thinking out loud."
AnimalCollective,39l3t3,stasz92,2,Fri Jun 12 16:08:21 2015 UTC,"I thought it was, ""but if we're mis-communicating, do we feel the same?"""
AnimalCollective,39l3t3,anti-chief,2,Fri Jun 12 18:58:56 2015 UTC,"i think that kidney stone fits better in that part of the song because the way that i interpret it is that he is trying to make the situation clear to who ever he is speaking to. I think he is trying to say that confusion no longer clouds his mind or blocks his flow of thoughts. Idk though really, i guess either interpretation is correct. This is one of the simple beauties of song writing and AnCo."

The ending to Chores, where the drums kick in and you get that catchy ""eh eh eh eheowehey!"", is charged with inspiration and booming with conviction (dancing and singing along to a pounding beat ""when there's no one watching"").  Daily Routine is literally what ""wake n' bake"" sounds like if expressed in song. Lazy, dreading the rest of the day, stretched out and broken down.

AnimalCollective,39j66m,Oldaccountlost,6,Fri Jun 12 11:04:36 2015 UTC,"I see ""My Girls"" and ""Bleed"" as two sides of a spectrum when it comes to having a family. In ""My Girls"" the mood is optimistic and blood is used as a metaphor for personal integrity (a solid soul and the blood I bleed). I think of ""Bleed"" as a song that portrays the pessimism and self-doubt every parent has to face at some point, where things aren't going so well and blood is invoked as a sort of punishment, a loss of that personal integrity (I've been shameful, that I must bleed)."

AnimalCollective,39awr5,stasz92,1 point,Wed Jun 10 17:58:46 2015 UTC,I haven't heard Blasted yet but I love Dead Drunk. To me it sounds like a 50/50 mix of Black Dice and AC (unsurprisingly) which is a great musical recipe

There was also an article in the Fader back in 2009 that mentioned Animal Collective's circle of friends, and Brad Truax was mentioned as an important friend of the band and their tour manager.

AnimalCollective,3940cm,mendozr,7,Tue Jun 9 05:04:11 2015 UTC,"While none of Centipede's tunes are among my all time AC favorites, I think it's their most listenable album to date. On casual listens I'll usually let it play through entirely with no urges to skip any songs in particular. All the songs just exist along this baseline so that none get super mellow or abstract, whereas if I were driving around on a sunny day listening to any of their other albums I'd probably skip a few here or there. Which makes sense giving the premise was skipping around the radio between pop hits."
AnimalCollective,3940cm,brightshinies,4,Tue Jun 9 06:40:11 2015 UTC,"This is Animal Collective's best driving album for sure. Something about it just makes it really conducive to driving around in the sunny PNW, I'm excited for my hour commute later."

AnimalCollective,3940cm,mustbetreeman_,3,Wed Jun 10 00:58:58 2015 UTC,"centipede hz is definitely a good album. the songs are very catchy, it's richly textured, and i love the atmosphere it creates. but i do think it falls short compared to other animal collective albums.   i haven't figured out exactly how to explain what i mean, but CHz just seems to be missing something. when i listen to other anco records, they are filled with things that just absolutely floor me. moments that make me feel indescribable emotion. an unexpected explosion of noise, an impossibly emotional vocal performance by avey, a single chord change at the perfect moment. you could tell those songs were inspired, something special was going on in the studio during their recording.  like i said, CHz is a good album. it's fun, it's catchy, i can dance and sing along to it and have a good time. but that's all i get from it."
AnimalCollective,3940cm,good-country,3,Thu Jun 11 01:56:19 2015 UTC,"You mentioned ""Cuckoo Cuckoo"", which I love because of its contrasts. In the same song, there's this ominous and brooding piano, heartfelt (but calm, at first) singing, and then the tension builds to a breaking point (the shouted ""DAYS"" in the last line of both verses) before everything comes crashing down over and over again, then abruptly silenced to reveal that same little piano murmuring away. CHz doesn't have that kind of intra-song dynamism, it usually ratchets everything up to crazy right at the beginning.  Also, much of the time on CHz I think Avey's voice is actually a little annoying. There's this bubbling tremolo effect that seems to be used a lot, and generally he comes across as very midrangey, nasal and shrill. Could be the way it's mixed. The screaming in ""Today's Supernatural"" has all this weird echo and delay on it, but it somehow is less intense and cathartic than the ending of ""For Reverend Green"", where he's just gradually coming unhinged and feeding off the pulse of the tune.  I still like CHz, but I hope AnCo's next album is more spacious and atmospheric like Fall Be Kind (my personal fave release of theirs). And maybe a few more Panda Bear tracks would be nice too."
AnimalCollective,3940cm,CrumbledFingers,2,Thu Jun 11 20:47:39 2015 UTC,"I repost this a lot...   Centepede Hz was the first Animal Collective album I've ever listened to. I heard a bit of a mix from their discography from my friend once or twice but it didn't really catch me I guess. I remember being cool with it though, but I guess I forgot about it.  Then Centipede Hz came out and we all went on a really cool road trip adventure. The same friend and another I was with agreed we'd blast the new AnCo album. I remember obviously enjoying it enough to download it when I got back home. And it took me on an incredible music journey. And I mean the album alone. Like, fuck. Such an incredible album. No problems with the production in my opinion. I feel like it was the way it was for a reason. So dense. I love every second and bit."

Aside from the production flaws, which Avey conceded when he was starting Slasher Flicks, it's arguably the weakest, most derivative, retread collection of songs in their discography. I'm glad you like it but statements like ""this album is like a drug"" mean absolutely nothing, particularly when you're trying to show its value relative to their previous releases."

Hence, his second crack at it with Slasher Flicks. He mentioned it in a few interviews around that time. No, I can't link you to any. It doesn't matter whether you agree or disagree with my description, I'm simply referring to Avey's comments that they did not achieve what he'd planned. Live, however, I think the songs do work as intended in a more spacious and stripped down form. They seemed to forget that less is more, once they got in the studio. MPP arguably suffers from the same trait, when you compare with the looseness and breathing space of the superior live jams. Ergo, Ben H. Allen III."

They've done so much with it already...I dunno i feel like it would be more redundant than anything. BUT your idea of a house-ish record, that would be awesome. I think Panda Bear could certainly do that on a solo album (PBMTGR was pretty similar with the repetitive beats).   Anyway, I'd love some more ambient stuff like HCTI or the end of Feels...then again they did get back to that with ODDSAC. Damn they've done so much already, how can they make new, different music? Well one thing's for sure, I'd love to hear less electronics and more actual instrumentation for this next one. It would be a radical change from CHz that I really think they need. They've gone so far with electronics, taking it to the absolute limit with CHz. And if Slasher Flicks is any influence on the band, then I think it could happen. Avey said in his AMA that he's been listening to Jazz lately so maybe that can come out. Imagine Slasher Flicks/Jazz/PBMTGR. That would be crazy."

We know Panda loves that kind of stuff, but it seems  like all the guys are open to it having done dj sets over the years. That plus them checking out the modular synths and Elektron machines, those are often used for that kind of stuff."

Those are all more or less equally my favorites of theirs, alone with the HCTI-Sung Tongs era. I do think there's a line between them being ""pop"" and accessible in a good way and then in a not so good way. Like Panda Bear's new album was great, but not on the level of a classic AnCo release that will stand the test of time imo.  I also really like when they combine elements of noise and ambient/drone stuff along with pop elements. I think combining the two is what I like in ""experiemental"" pop."

I think there are a couple tracks on the new PB record that stay minimal, and the new AC tracks on sound cloud show some return to form"
AnimalCollective,390jhg,Kbiscu1t,2,Tue Jun 9 03:31:14 2015 UTC,i don't see how Strawberry Jam was minimal. The first three songs are very layered and busy and full of samples
AnimalCollective,390jhg,mustbetreeman_,3,Mon Jun 8 19:22:20 2015 UTC,Dub-influenced psych electronic beats and acoustic guitars. I think the juxtaposition between classic 60's sounding dub and future sounding beats would be really cool. I think acoustic guitars would bridge the gap between then and now and make the two styles blend very well.
AnimalCollective,390jhg,sadlittleduckling,2,Tue Jun 30 09:27:34 2015 UTC,My prediction is more sonic exploration but less effects. Probably synthy/sampley but dry. It will feel minimal that way even if there's a lot going on.

AnimalCollective,38htdw,woodensails,11,Thu Jun 4 08:44:48 2015 UTC,"The first time I ever watched ODDSAC, I was literally scared by how weird it was. It was like a horror film almost, but rather than jump scares, it just kept building up. It was probably the first movie I ever watched that gave me that type of physical reaction. ODDSAC is a really special thing to me.   It really speaks a lot about how good the band is at creating atmospheres with their sound, and of course how good Danny Perez  is at making trippy looking I-don't-know-what-the-fucks-going-on visuals"
AnimalCollective,38htdw,koreafair,11,Thu Jun 4 12:47:06 2015 UTC,"Cool idea, not a great execution. IMO anyway. The songs/ visuals don't really blow me away.  Having said that it starts and ends incredibly strongly"
AnimalCollective,38htdw,StupidSam,1 point,Thu Jun 4 14:01:44 2015 UTC,"whaaaaaaaa  I've always thought the songs from ODDSAC were pretty great, especially Screens and Tantrum Barb, I mean, the songs aren't really comparable to their others but they're pretty great nonetheless in my opinion."
AnimalCollective,38htdw,DiscipleOfBasedGod,7,Sat Jun 6 05:48:26 2015 UTC,"Oddsac is brilliant.  I would urge anyone who wasn't arsed about it to at least listen to it through a couple of times. Probably, in my opinion, as close as we'll get to any AnCo ambient material."
AnimalCollective,38htdw,Seahoss,2,Thu Jun 4 15:55:12 2015 UTC,"Two Sails on a Sound is pretty ambient. And, Visiting Friends kinda"
AnimalCollective,38htdw,Seahoss,3,Thu Jun 4 17:24:00 2015 UTC,"Definitely. Two Sails on a Sound is one my favourites of theirs. A good bit of HCTI and Holinndagain is ambient music. I believe Visiting Friends is their take on a Gas song. And I'd imagine the songs on Oddsac were inspired by that era.   What I really meant was 'an AnCo ambient album' seeing as a substantial amount of Oddsac is about building atmosphere, and the songs which contain lyrics are sparse. Didn't mean to word it the way I did. I guess what I mean is that I would class Oddsac overall as an ambient album or that it may very well be the closest we get to an ambient AnCo LP."
AnimalCollective,38htdw,potholderz525,4,Thu Jun 4 17:32:21 2015 UTC,"Absolutely love it. Such a rollercoaster of high and low emotions. A group of friends of mine all dropped acid and we're watching it one day. My friend who had never seen it says to me during the Tantrum Barb scene ""those look like a shit ton of people all in body bags"", referring to the stones panda was hopping around on. I could not unsee them as body bags for that entire scene."
AnimalCollective,38htdw,DidDrugsWithPax,3,Thu Jun 4 16:17:24 2015 UTC,It's vivid and unsettling. I don't really like it because it makes me feel all squirmy and uneasy. I should try it again though
AnimalCollective,38htdw,maxoreilly,3,Thu Jun 4 16:33:59 2015 UTC,"It's weird to me that people find it inaccessible because most of the songs are soo catchy to me vs their early work. I also find that the first few movements were too strong to put first, and the order of the dark/light vibes is kinda weird, but overall I love it so much. The first time I saw the black ooze girl slithering on the ground, the deepest fear crept up my spine. That acid-y fear. Danny P is the best kind of crazy.   Edit: I remember being so into the style of Lady On The Lake, the synthy horror thing. I wanted so much to hear more of that from Avey. Little did I know that was a precursor to DOWN THERE, possibly my favorite release from any of them."
AnimalCollective,38htdw,mendozr,3,Thu Jun 4 19:03:44 2015 UTC,"I'm a huge fan of ODDSAC. I've had a hard time finding other people who've seen and enjoyed it, so the fact that this thread exists is awesome.  One interpretation I've heard is that it's almost like a loose autobiography of Animal Collective. Each member plays a part in the film that represents a bit of their personality, influences, and individual approach to making music. The last scene shows a food fight between friends which could represent their collaborative process for making music. Admittedly, the film is very much up for interpretation but considering the fact that ODDSAC was originally planned to be more of a tour documentary I don't think it's too big of a stretch.  Also, here's an interview with the guys talking about ODDSAC that I stumbled upon recently: http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Exclusive-Interview-Animal-Collective-And-ODDSAC-Director-Danny-Perez-16856.html"
AnimalCollective,38htdw,kelajes,2,Sun Jun 7 03:17:08 2015 UTC,I legitimately love it. It may be pretty scary but I think it perfectly reflects their music and is absolutely beautiful in some sections. Tantrum Barb and Mr Fingers are pure visual bliss imo

AnimalCollective,38htdw,solidsnake2085,2,Thu Jun 4 22:36:31 2015 UTC,"I preordered it as soon as I heard about it. My roommate ordered 3 copies of it. One for himself, one for his GF at the time and one for his brother. So at one time I had 4 copies of it in my apartment. We decided to watch it completely sober at first just so we could get an understanding of it and it blew our minds. It later went on to become a standard watch while we were tripping. I really love the music in the and the visuals in it. My favorite visuals are during  Urban Creme because I have always seen something different when I have watched it.   My favorite tracks off the album are ""Mess Your House"" and ""What happened?"". Usually when I hear them I spend the rest of the day singing ""What Happened?"" I remember back in 2010 at the Hopscotch music festival they premiered ODDSAC at the movie theater and Panda Bear was supposed to do a meet and greet after the showing. We waited about 45 minutes afterwards but he wasn't there, so we left so we could see the festival. Come to find out he showed up about 5 minutes after we left and I missed my chance to meet Noah :("
AnimalCollective,38htdw,TylerAM,1 point,Fri Jun 5 15:34:50 2015 UTC,"It's not my favorite, BUT it was the first anything of Animal Collective I'd seen/listened to, and I've been hooked ever since.  I definetly think it's a format that fit the band really well and that it's a format that should really be explored more (visual albums I mean).  As for the record itself, the audio and visuals are all one thing, so I judge it based on that.  Mr. Fingers and Working/Tantrum Barb are probably the best representations of what kind of crazy feels this record is all about; even the lack of concept but presence of strange recurring characters seems reminiscent of AC's prior albums (with characters like Pan or Alvin beyond the characters that are the band members), so it was interesting to see that represented visually.  Of course Danny Perez would do the visuals; he's really the only person that could possibly be qualified to do the visuals.  It was also all and all refreshing to see AC do something a little more to their roots in the way of some of the noise pieces, especially after all the crowds that Merriweather probably brought in."

AnimalCollective,38de6g,whatwhywhoami,11,Wed Jun 3 14:17:52 2015 UTC,"It's material things. He's saying that he wants a house for his family to live in, but he prefaces that by saying, I don't want this to seem like I only care about material things. Because a house is a material thing, but it's important to him because he wants his family to be happy and safe.  That being said, I think PB and the rest of the band have said in interviews that they like to leave songs open to interpretation by the fans, so you can hear what you want to hear."
AnimalCollective,38de6g,stasz92,5,Wed Jun 3 15:53:39 2015 UTC,"On one hand, I clearly hear him say 'material things' and that phrase usually makes sense in context. On the other hand, Panda has a tendency to pronounce words strangely when he sings.  In the end, the meaning is the same"
AnimalCollective,38de6g,bengr35,2,Wed Jun 3 15:03:57 2015 UTC,"They both make sense, y'know? Maybe we can chalk this up to being a cleverly ambiguous lyric.  My question is: is it adobe slats or adobe slabs? I mean, a slat is a thin, narrow piece of wood often used in shades, which would make adobe a weird construction material... And describing an adobe wall as a slab is kinda a weird way to describe it...  But you know what? I don't mean to seem like I care about immaterial things, like AnCo lyrics. I just want to listen to M-double-P with friends on the weekends."
AnimalCollective,38de6g,Blinky-the-Doormat,1 point,Wed Jun 3 15:49:16 2015 UTC,"Listen to the original boots, it's just his typical delivery. He inserts these extra 'swallowed' syllables all over the place, e.g. 'like-uh social status'. As I say, this kind of thing is even more pronounced in live versions but it's found throughout their discography."
AnimalCollective,38de6g,Stanshant,1 point,Wed Jun 3 19:16:02 2015 UTC,"It would actually make 1000% more sense if it was immaterial things.   I don't mean, to seem like I care about IMMATERIAL things... LIKE A SOCIAL STATUS.  Everyone else is seemingly forgetting that he says ""LIKE A SOCIAL STATUS,"" not simply ""I don't mean to seem like I care about material things.""  Material, other than ""physically existing"" can also mean ""important, essential, or relevant.""  So this would work two ways.  First, he's saying that he doesn't care about ""immaterial"" things, which are things that are not important. SUCH AS a social status. ""Immaterial"" as in unimportant. If it is ""material things"" he's saying that he doesn't care about something that is important, but then acknowledging that a social status is important. Which kind of negatively cuts that ""4 walls and adobe slabs for my girls"" are NOT material so they're not important?  Secondly, a social status is not a ""tangible"" thing in the other definition of the word. If it's immaterial, he's saying he doesn't care about something unimportant, like a social status, but he's also saying that he doesn't care about things that aren't ""tangible"" something outside of his control and influence. Four walls and adobe slabs are material things in the fact that they are both tangible and important.  I would actually like the song one iota more if it was immaterial things, though that's not saying much because I loathe that song.  That being said, I am 100% sure it's material things."
AnimalCollective,38de6g,Superspookyghost,1 point,Thu Jun 4 11:05:24 2015 UTC,"So many people are hung up on this lyric.    Material can also mean significant or important. He elevates the idea of a social status to something that is paramount, but insists he does not care for such a thing, and is only interested in providing his family with a house."
AnimalCollective,38de6g,Seahoss,1 point,Thu Jun 4 15:48:37 2015 UTC,"I think it's 100% material. My interpretation is panda is pointing to the irony that social status is treated in society as something material. Think of all the useless things people buy to reach the status quo or how different classes in our society are treated. Then compare that to the simplicity of a home. It's only 4 walls, but all of our feelings, memories, emotions to our homes make it more than just that. Regardless on deeper inspection a lot of anco lyrics are really layered and amazing, and I think a way underrated aspect of their music.   TLDR: Social status is an immaterial thing that we actually treat as material, a home is material but we treat as immaterial."
AnimalCollective,3868ig,Tomphilly,8,Tue Jun 2 03:36:44 2015 UTC,"Now that Prospect Hummer finally came in, my collection looks a little fuller.

AnimalCollective,384794,noraamitt,11,Mon Jun 1 19:01:29 2015 UTC,"Avey's quote from the article:   When I was in fourth or fifth grade, I had a close friend who let me borrow Aoxomoxoa, and that's the first Grateful Dead record that really pulled me in. It wasn't how I imagined them sounding, based on the skeletons in the artwork. It was the Eighties, and that stuff was more associated with metal. But I was fascinated with what I heard. I made a tape from the CD that my friend lent me, and when my family used to drive down to Florida, I remember I'd put [it] in my Walkman and walk up and down the beach, listening to that album with the water coming onto the shore.  I liked ""Doin' That Rag"" because it's so catchy, but also so weird. It's written in a way that showcases Jerry Garcia's wandering guitar style, and it's hard to put your finger on at first, because it's moving all over the place. It's a song about dancing, so it has this groove to it. Or maybe you just imagine that it's about dancing — the lyrics are really absurd and confusing. ""Hipsters, flipsters. . ."" I could never really understand what he was saying. It felt like what the psychedelic experience should be: like being confused, but overly ecstatic at the same time.  A few years later, in sixth or seventh grade, I started to go see the Dead. It was the most amazing experience I'd ever had, being at a show like that with so many people tuned in to the same thing. ""Doin' That Rag"" takes me back to my youth, and experimenting with psychedelics and smoking weed and all that. I got into that stuff with a crowd — we were all into the Dead, and we'd go see them together. Those were easygoing times. It didn't feel rebellious. It just felt like we were kids discovering something crazy about the world."
AnimalCollective,384794,Tom_Anks,10,Mon Jun 1 19:01:50 2015 UTC,"As far as ""studio"" Dead tracks go, Doin' That Rag very well may be my favorite as well. Until I was ~17, I only knew the Dead for Casey Jones, Truckin', and a couple others off American Beauty. ""How could anyone devote their lives to following this band around?"" I asked myself at the time. ""What could you possibly get from hearing Friend of the Devil 37 times?""   Aoxomoxoa was my Grateful Dead stepping stone. It was the first album of theirs I listened to completely through and digested as ""an album"" and the first time the band floored me. Doin' That Rag was the song that ht me upside the head and really opened my eyes. I listened to that album constantly, over and over and over. As I went off to college, I met more and more people who were into the Dead and exposed me to live shows. I was hesitant at first; the cheering and crowd noise from bootlegs turned me off. If I wanted to hear something, why wouldn't I want it in the best quality possible? Of course, this was before I realized the improvisational aspects of their live performances, and the jam-heavy vehicle songs they used as conduits into wild and manic musical explorations. From there, until present day, I'm hooked. I'm glad I stuck around to realize the difference between their studio folk tracks, and a ~30 minute Playin' in the Band that holds up to be more of a psychedelic jazz odyssey than a regular ""song."" And Aoxomoxoa and Doin' That Rag were the first steps in getting me there.   I know this is an Animal Collective subreddit, so sorry for the lengthy Dead rant, but I feel like most who are into Animal Collective are more open minded in the realm of musical exploration and experimentalism. The Dead and Animal Collective are both on my extremely short personal list of groups that can take me to wonderful places."
AnimalCollective,384794,BobPlager,4,Mon Jun 1 19:30:03 2015 UTC,"What an odd choice.    ""it's so catchy, but also so weird.""   That sums up most of the tracks on Aoxomoxoa for me.  I first got into the Dead through Phish, who became one of my favourite bands years ago due to their ability to jam but also the whole scene surrounding them. Being over in the UK I've never had the chance to see them but I still feel like I'm part of this awesome, positive community by listening to them. And I feel the exact same with the Dead - only their jamming is a lot more impressive and I can listen to it from a musical standpoint rather than relying their back catalogue before actually becoming a die-hard fan."

AnimalCollective,382ucl,rolltribe,7,Mon Jun 1 13:26:28 2015 UTC,"Here's what i think of the ones I have   Spirit is easily the worst. Distorted in several places Danse sounds really really good.  HCTI isn't mind blowing but nicer than a cd Feels is nothing special CHz is very clean. brothersport and summertime clothes singles are delicious Tomboy 7 inches are really nice PBVSGR and Mr noah are super duper clear, like glass Tomboy box set is a little quiet but still good Honeycomb/Gotham is again very clear person pitch nice and warm. It's not the clearest but that's the reverb not the pressing   All in all spirit is the only stand out poor pressing, and Danse is the only one that I feel is truly enhanced by the vinyl pressing"
AnimalCollective,382ucl,roopn,5,Tue Jun 2 01:36:28 2015 UTC,"All I have is Strawberry Jam, Feels, MPP, Fall be Kind and Centipede Hz,  and MPP sounds best to me"
AnimalCollective,382ucl,Crimsonxyu,5,Mon Jun 1 14:11:04 2015 UTC,I have all the studio albums and eps on vinyl and I wouldn't say there are any really bad pressings but my favorite may be Sung Tongs.
AnimalCollective,382ucl,calfman,2,Mon Jun 1 18:52:44 2015 UTC,"yeah, I'd say they're all pretty similar in pressing, but I did enjoy that of sung tongs the most"
AnimalCollective,382ucl,dylantaylor97,2,Mon Jun 1 19:09:01 2015 UTC,Ide say Spirit or HCTI
AnimalCollective,382ucl,HereForAliens886,4,Mon Jun 1 15:25:24 2015 UTC,I'd have to disagree on spirit. I love the record but I think the CD is mixed better or something cause it just doesn't sound as crisp not to say I don't love how it sounds on vinyl I just don't think they did a good job pressing it. That also could be my turn table too
AnimalCollective,382ucl,AgginYknats,2,Mon Jun 1 16:03:20 2015 UTC,"The FatCat pressings sound better to me but only so slightly. None of them are bad but none are particularly incredible either. The very early and late albums can be hard to track if one doesn't have a great table. Otherwise AnCo has pretty good pressings as far as most indie bands go.   My favorite is Sung Tongs though, I feel the music is the most vinyl friendly. And I feel Water Curses is decidedly the worst sounding."

The only thing I'd say is that Feels doesn't really stand out all that much, though I would chalk that up to the fact that I don't exactly agree on how all of that album's songs were mixed.."

AnimalCollective,380cme,Pigman08,1 point,Sun May 31 22:33:57 2015 UTC,"Buy a Roland SP-303 or SP-404, that's what he used to record Person Pitch. He also still occasionally uses the reverb effects on them."
AnimalCollective,37z64y,Gr33nhouse,11,Sun May 31 17:17:50 2015 UTC,My top 100. Suggestions are welcome.
AnimalCollective,37z64y,bryter-layter,8,Sun May 31 17:37:55 2015 UTC,"You have Odelay by Beck listened twice, you must really like that album.  I would recommend the album The Softest Glow by Monogold.  Solid list, great balance of classic, older material and great, modern 'classics.'"
AnimalCollective,37z64y,bryter-layter,3,Sun May 31 17:43:01 2015 UTC,"Oops. I intended to put Sea Change Mutations on one of those, I'll fix it.   I'll check out Monogold, thanks."

AnimalCollective,37z64y,bryter-layter,1 point,Sun May 31 22:30:42 2015 UTC,Funnily enough I've never done drugs.
AnimalCollective,37z64y,Tom_Anks,1 point,Sun May 31 23:50:26 2015 UTC,"I'm amazed, just seemed like a very psychedelic music taste"
AnimalCollective,37z64y,bryter-layter,2,Mon Jun 1 00:04:03 2015 UTC,Yeah I know. Kinda like how Frank Zappa is assumed by some to have been a psych drugs user due to his music even though he never used them.
AnimalCollective,37z64y,Tom_Anks,1 point,Mon Jun 1 00:20:57 2015 UTC,Oh very true. Absolutely love Zappa - do you like Phish or the Dead?
AnimalCollective,37z64y,bryter-layter,2,Mon Jun 1 00:35:04 2015 UTC,"I haven't heard much of the Dead and nothing by Phish, probably because I've been told that their studio albums aren't that good compared to their live shows. Any suggestions?"
AnimalCollective,37z64y,Tom_Anks,2,Mon Jun 1 00:48:03 2015 UTC,I'd highly recommend A Live One by Phish and Live/Dead by the Dead
AnimalCollective,37z64y,noraamitt,1 point,Mon Jun 1 09:36:17 2015 UTC,"A Live One is a great jumping off point for Phish. And I'd suggest Europe 72 for the Dead, as well as Live/Dead."
AnimalCollective,37z64y,Tom_Anks,2,Mon Jun 1 12:09:41 2015 UTC,"Oh definitely Europe 72 as well, some great jams in there plus there's loads of tracks"

AnimalCollective,37z64y,AllocatedData,5,Sun May 31 21:44:33 2015 UTC,You have a pretty diverse list. You must be a pretty dynamic character.  To appeal to your acoustic sensibilities you might want to try the album Visiter by the Dodos and to satisfy your hiphop needs the album Under Pressure by Logic.
AnimalCollective,37z64y,calfman,6,Sun May 31 19:23:35 2015 UTC,My List Any reccomendations are much appreciated  Cool website!  edit: Also Clark's self-titled should be 2nd tier but i cant find it on the site
AnimalCollective,37z64y,calfman,3,Sun May 31 18:44:42 2015 UTC,Seems like you enjoy a good amount of beat orientated chill music. You're probably a really laid back person but can be the life of the party on occasion.  I think you might enjoy the band Brothertiger. Also the album Mezzanine from Massive Attack.
AnimalCollective,37z64y,hoodpharmacist,3,Sun May 31 19:08:26 2015 UTC,"just listened to a track off mezzanine, definitely seems like my style. i will definitely give the whole album a go when i get the chance, thanks!"

AnimalCollective,37s33v,erratastigmata,12,Fri May 29 22:58:42 2015 UTC,One time I transposed College into four trumpet parts and recorded each one. It took forever. When I finally finished my computer blue screened and I lost it forever. I was so pissed that I didn't do it again. It sounded pretty cool tho. Maybe I'll try it again some day.
AnimalCollective,37s33v,MrBarryThor12,3,Sat May 30 00:42:23 2015 UTC,You should!!! Or at least some other project. Post it here when ya do!
AnimalCollective,37s33v,maxoreilly,10,Sat May 30 01:00:33 2015 UTC,"I love playing Winter's love, such a satisfying progression...obviously Sung Tongs songs work with just guitar but I haven't tried their open tunings out yet.  For Reverend Green/The Purple Bottle/Did You See The Words/Chores are great to manically strum and yelp!  Same with Laughing Hieroglyphic (which does sound a bit more folky or something, but still beautiful)  Recently figured out Taste (the bass notes anyways) with standard chords (first chord is C7, WHO KNEW?)  The one I play the most on guitar is No More Runnin. If I've got a bro to sing harmo with/ play piano, its always real sweet :)  Been saying I'd record at least one of their songs for a while...maybe I will  Edit: Oh man I forgot In The Flowers...learning all of that picking at the start took a bit of playback but its such a cool phrase! I never really noticed the movement of it as much as when I really listened. Amazing stuff. And Also Frightened is soooo pretty and dances around only a few chords...master tension and release stuff.  Sorry I wrote a novel. Basically they are subtle geniuses with their progressions...will always be one of if not the biggest influence on my writing"
AnimalCollective,37s33v,mstout7,2,Sat May 30 00:56:22 2015 UTC,That all sounds awesome!! I'll have to see if I can figure out any of the Sung Tongs songs on uke haha. I'm kinda limited in that I still can't do some finger shapes so some chords are no bueno for me. Somedayyy
AnimalCollective,37s33v,macarthurpark431,2,Sat May 30 01:00:07 2015 UTC,"Keep up the work and you'll get it! Some simple AnCo / Panda songs I've played on the uke are Bros (D Major for the first half, D Major then A Major alternating for the second), Banshee Beat (E major for the beginning then E major and A Major for the rest), Comfy In Nautica is Bb Major the whole time, and finally Loch Raven is Dm7 - G7 - for one bar each, C major for two bars then repeat. Hope this helps and jam on!"
AnimalCollective,37s33v,maxoreilly,2,Sun May 31 16:04:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah I really dig the progression to Winters Love. Earlier this year I composed and performed a jazz tune based off of it. I've tried to do it with the open tunings, and while its really fun to jam on it it didn't jive with me as much when trying to sing along for whatever reason"
AnimalCollective,37s33v,macarthurpark431,2,Fri Jun 5 01:42:43 2015 UTC,Do you have a video or audio of that jazz version. Would love to hear that!
AnimalCollective,37s33v,StinkyLog,2,Sat Jun 6 03:36:40 2015 UTC,I think I might have a video somewhere. If I find it I'll post it.
AnimalCollective,37s33v,StinkyLog,3,Sat Jun 6 03:39:27 2015 UTC,"I play guitar. Most of their songs that I know are just some chord progressions. I really like playing the chords to applesauce with the song as backing, it has a great progression. As for other songs I've learned, yeah they really aren't great for single instrument adaption but I still like to sing along and just make up your own way of playing it. My Girls and The Purple Bottle are two I have a lot of fun with. Hope this helped."
AnimalCollective,37s33v,stasz92,1 point,Fri May 29 23:43:49 2015 UTC,Ahh I've tried Purple Bottle but I feel like it ends up sounding so repetitive! The actual song works it but I sound like a dumbass hahaha.   Thank you though :)

AnimalCollective,37s33v,HereForAliens886,2,Sat May 30 02:11:43 2015 UTC,"I have a loop of Taste (BBC) recorded on guitar that I like to sing to whilst hitting random objects or even drums with drumsticks.  I also have a loop of Essplode that I like playing drums and singing too but I am an amateur drummer. Essplode is super easy to play on guitar so I usually jam that if I have a guitar and am bored.  Nothing beats Winter's Love. I transcribed the vocals to Piano with my brother but we don't play it often. I should probably get a recording of us sometime.  I got most of Moonjock figured out on Guitar.  I have a chord that I strum while singing Covered in Frogs but it probably isn't right.  I do an acoustic cover of Grass but I can't get the scream right.  I mashed Who Could Win A Rabbit with Modest Mouse's 3rd Planet because I didn't know the chords to the other parts of Who Could Win A Rabbit.  I know a pretty piss poor acoustic version of Flesh Canoe.  Will definitely try to learn Banshee Beat sometime.  I can do some of Turn Into Something but my vocals are weak there.  I've got I Remember Learning How To Dive down pretty well.  I also learned a bit of Avey Tare and Kria Brekkan's songs.  I've got Sis Around The Sandmill down pretty well but it needs works still.  When I have the guitar with the proper tuning I can play Lay Lay Off, Faselam.  I think I know the chords to Polly but haven't gotten the lyrics or beat down.  I messed around with Alvin Row on the piano but it's pretty hard and I play guitar with only dabbling in piano.    So what I want to learn are: Sleeper Factory / Doggy, Banshee Beat, Applesauce, Water Curses and Cuckoo Cuckoo."
AnimalCollective,37s33v,anti-chief,1 point,Sun May 31 02:37:41 2015 UTC,Doggy is super easy! I can play it no problem and I've just started teaching myself guitar. If you ever get around to recording some of your covers in the future I'd be super interested in hearing them!
AnimalCollective,37s33v,Peacebone22,2,Tue Jun 2 02:56:00 2015 UTC,"Never really thought to cover ac as I feel it would take something away from the alien-ness of it all. But I started playing synth  few months ago and have some jams I've made that accidentally sounded similar to #1, my girls, and something hollinndagian-ish.

Edit: Also, any of panda's stuff off of Tomboy is a nice crowd pleaser. You Can Count On Me and Last Night at the Jetty are beautiful songs."

AnimalCollective,37j6x9,MrBarryThor12,1 point,Fri May 29 02:19:27 2015 UTC,"To be fair, I originally wrote the House of Leaves interpretation about the last line (""There's no one to say meow, kitties"") and other people subsequently edited the other lines to fit the House of Leaves interpretation, which was never my intent.  I didn't ""invent"" the House of Leaves interpretation, I just merely mentioned that it was a relatively popular interpretation.   Someone also mentioned that Sung Tongs was recorded in Green Leaf House (a recording studio) so it might be a reference to that as well."

AnimalCollective,37epsh,wanderjahr,3,Wed May 27 15:18:18 2015 UTC,"Well it might selectively. I grabbed what ever I could to make this album, and often the tracks weren't in crystal clear audio quality. The things like the transitions, intro and a couple select tracks might sound better.
