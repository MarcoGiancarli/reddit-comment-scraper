How ""dark"" subreddits are getting is going to vary subreddit-to-subreddit.

CorgiGifs,3bfo41,Aladayle,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:37:35 2015 UTC,I've never even heard of cardigan corgis. Is that a reference to the coat color or a specific kind of corgi?
CorgiGifs,3bfo41,Aladayle,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:40:33 2015 UTC,"It's a separate breed. Corgis were domesticated in two breeds for similar purposes. Cardigans are much larger and robust, and generally have a temperament closer to a shepherd dog as opposed to the more terrier like Pembrokes (which are the fluffy little creamsicle ones).  My dog Panda comes from an older line of Cardigans too, making him a little more unusual looking. You can see this body type in both Cardigans and Pembrokes though, they have very distinctive long serious faces and wide barrel chests. There's a gif on this subreddit actually showing a Pembroke with these features.  I'm a history nerd so I spent a lot of time researching this and it's the reason I bought a corgi from a breeder as opposed to adopting like I have every other time in my life. It's just kinda cool to see. Anyway, I could talk your ear off about this."
CorgiGifs,3bfo41,Aladayle,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:13:05 2015 UTC,"What do you think of a corgi as a dog for someone with high levels of anxiety? I can't afford a dog just yet but I figured this would be a good time to do the research regardless.  When my husband and I move I'll be alone for like 70%+ of the day so I thought of getting a sort of ""therapy"" animal. What do you think of the corgi for this purpose?"
CorgiGifs,3bfo41,Aladayle,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:26:25 2015 UTC,"It depends on the dog. My dog is actually therapy trained, so when he senses me having an anxiety attack he is trained to move closer and do cute tricks. His siblings from the exact same father, however, are totally different. There's no way they would be good with someone with anxiety let alone learn a trick beyond sitting.   Cardigans tend to be much calmer and are on the Border Collie end of dog intelligence (shepherd dogs are very smart, which is why it's good to think of Cardigans as shepherds and pemmies as terriers) so they have a lot of room to be good therapy dogs but just as much room to develop a different personality.   We chose Panda by going to the breeder every weekend since the dogs were born and watching the dogs. Panda never played rough, or really at all with the other dogs, but he wasn't isolated and unfriendly like his other sister was. He didn't bark unless he was happy and he only growled when his siblings were mean.   So I guess Id recommend spending a lot of time with a dog before getting it and Id recommend intelligent breeds over dumber breeds because their reactions and personality are more predictable and consistent. Watching a puppy personality doesn't always dictate adult personality, but in my experience with smarter dogs it does. This may have to do with the fact that dogs credited with higher intelligence grow up more quickly, where for example a Golden Retriever technically doesn't stop being malleable and puppy like until it is over 2 years old. A lot can change in that personality in 2 years.   But Pembrokes and golden retrievers also can make wonderful therapy dogs. If you hear about the therapy process you know a substantial amount of puppies raised to be therapy dogs don't graduate because of the temperament changing and low intelligence, but I'm sure have met well behaved golden retriever therapy dogs.  So the answer is it just depends. You can go to a breeder and watch a litter and not find a good personality, you can go and find every dog behaves well. You can get a dog who turns out to be a nightmare despite all the love and affection you give. You can adopt a 12 year old dog who is the sweetest or the worst. With dogs it's an odds game.   Odds get better if you know their personality, better still if their breed is smart, and best of their breed is known for being social.   But you could still get a dog whose mean as a puppy, is a chihuahua chow mix (famous for being dumb and aggressive) and it could be great.   I do recommend cardigans (ONLY from an AKC breeder, I can tell you why in another comment if you want) because they have great odds, I have only had positive experiences with them, and they are low energy low maintenance dogs who wouldn't mind doing nothing all day."
