With Convenient Horses I do often put it on Remote instead of Local as too often I zone into town walk the the merchant only to realize I left some junk on the horse I wanted to sell.  Fuu...  At least with Remote I still can't access the horse when in dungeons & other 'hostile' zones.  I still do walk up to my horse to open the saddle bags 99% of the time just for immersion.  I keep off the auto-loot.    Quick Saves:  I wouldn't say I'm a junkie, but my game is unstable enough that not QSing every 30ish mins is a recipe for a lot of replaying stuff I just did.  I don't QS in combat or anything cheesy like that, but I'm sure to tap F5 every once in a while juuust in case a CTD is around the corner.    Reduced Bandoliers:  Sometimes I do use it, sometimes not.  I've found when I do use the reduced CW version I end up just adding more pouches :-(  And they don't 'fit' well on my girls (even with the UNP version) so they look terrible.  Now I often use the default CW version and just limit myself to 1 maybe 2 pouches and a backpack.    I leave on the paralysis and visuals for poisons.  Poisons need to remain truly nasty.  Spiders, Charrus, etc are very terrifying for a long time.  And with SIC & other spawning mods, I'm always running into (and away from) spiders.  They are freakin everywhere!

Thought about it for a bit, thought about consoling it, but instead I just decided that my character would be able to pick some basic locks.  Turned off the perk requirement and gave myself a few lockpicks by console (I had passed up way more than I gave myself, no guilt there), and picked that lock.  I doubt I'll pick any other locks except for in situations like this, where I have no choice.  But tbh, that coffin shouldn't require lockpicking."

skyrimrequiem,3e0s68,jathoma9,2,Tue Jul 21 02:02:00 2015 UTC,I used SXP a few times and there was an occasional bug where a skill got stuck at 99% but it would then refund the cost.  Just try it a few times it generally works quickly.  If you did it 10 times you have a separate bug or just an older version.  Other than that put SXP it at the bottom of your load order.  PS: IMO try just getting SXP + Req to work first.  You can even play this way just set Req exp to 50% in the MCM and SXP to 50% so you get a mix of skill gains.  I like doing this as otherwise youâ€™re more tempted to grind EXP or skills. Now you can just play and every few days bump any skill that's lagging.

skyrimrequiem,3dzd3i,cazinnova,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:52:46 2015 UTC,"Well, if this guy is to be believed, all saves do.  Quick/Auto/New, if a lot of 'stuff' is going on when you save (scripts firing, etc) then one may CTD when saving and/or loading that save.  At least that's been my experience.    I pretty much never CTD'd when doing a new save , but would occasionally CTD when doing a QS.  I typically do a new save once, maybe twice a night, but would QS like a dozen or more times a night (old rig and too many heavy mods).  So I tried disabling QS & AS for a while.  Well, turns out when I would do a new save in place of a QS, my CTD rate didn't change, they weren't any easier to load, etc.  I think most people (myself included) tend to do a QS when the scene is 'busier' than when they do a hard save so those saves are more... problematic.  Again, at least that's my experience :-)    I've been checking the papyrus log when I CTD on save to see what was firing off when it happens and my 2 biggest offenders have been Aroused and Bathing in Skyrim, and to some extent Frostfall.  I think if I'm unlucky enough to hit save when they are firing off there is a very good chance I'll CTD and have a hard time loading that save."

My most recent playthough uses a little bit of alchemy, but it's kind of a pain in the ass. It has benefits (stronger, night-eye, increased health/stamina/magica etc) but it requires some min-maxing in a way I dont like.  Instead of naturally leveling up by making potions I need (And are varied), I have to make all of one potion, whichever one is the highest cost. Then procede to make f*cking thousands of them, level up really fast, sell them for tons of money, and move on.  That's boring, to me at least. It's powerful, sure, but not really fun in my book.

If you decide to go with archery, I'd go with the steed stone and I'd pick up alchemy as well, unless your character is apposed to poisons.  Poison will take care of every dragon in the game except Alduin, but without the steed stone and no ring of namiria your stamina will be hurting mid-game. If you go destruction I'd go with the mage stone, maybe even the Atronach (and then either use potions, food, or a separate weapon with magicka drain for regen).  A sword will be fine for killing dragons because the weapon speed combined with either the marked for death shout or poisons will make up for the lack of armor pen.   Between the two choices I'd say that restoration/destruction will become ez mode late game regardless of whatever extra difficulty mods your run, while resto/archery(poisons?) will be more challenging all the way through."

skyrimrequiem,3dp2cj,CpntBrryCrnch,2,Mon Jul 20 14:28:04 2015 UTC,"The problem is stats(as I see it). If you go Destruction you will need more points in magica. Which would mean that 2 of your primary things are then magica-based as opposed to Stamina based. Your sword and blocking use Stamina as their Utility. Moreover, Destruction will take up at least 3 perks. (many people cap at the Adept spells, lest you become bored). Using Destruction makes it a Pelial build as well, though he used a mace and sword interchangeably.   A crossbow can poison dragons as well as provide aerial support. It would use Stamina, which you would already be using for your HA and primary sword and board. Bolts also have excellent arpen. Plus, there is a perk for additional pen.  I would think that a paladin would never use the ring of namira or necessarily engage in soul trapping. Perhaps animal souls only. I could see a paladin doing enchanting certainly.   As far as stones go, you may well approach it as to what you want your character to be able to do. If you go mage stone, you can switch to Atronoch later. You cannot, however, switch between Lord and Mage. You probably already knew that. One path leads to more physical prowess, the other enhances your ability for spells or extreme magika with the Atronoch. The mage can help with the whole HA spell use issue.   Paladins provide excellent material for RP in skyrim. There are so many mods, armor, weapons, quests or otherwise that lend to this. You can even start the game as a Vigilant of Stendaar with Alternate Start.   best of luck! I hope it turns out super fun for you"
skyrimrequiem,3dp2cj,phyriel,2,Sat Jul 18 08:33:41 2015 UTC,"I recently made a paladin build for requiem but I made my goal to equip him in dawnbreaker + spellbreaker + enchanted armor from Lost Paladins of the Divines mod. I started as Vigilant of Stendarr, using shield + sword // robe + hood and heavy boots gloves. Once I got to somewhat higher heavy armor skill I switched to full heavy which slowed down my restoration progress. At this point most of magic users were totally raping me because I was still very slow. Dragons would still one shot me if I didn't block, if I blocked they would eat like 50% of my stamina so I couldn't stand toe to toe with them still. But once I got this armor from mod, spellbreaker + dawnbreaker and resto to 50+ I turned into nearly invulnerable with 70%+ mres, around 1000 armor rating, dawnbreaker doing like 190 dmg per swing and 2 shoting most undead, dragon priests also easy as pie with slow time + power attacks. So yea at around lvl 35 I stopped playing, got way too op and easy."

Take the mage stone for the 100 magicka and put every point into health, since you can find massive stamina items like Namira's ring and Rahgot's mask.  Once you have Dawnbreaker and Spellbreaker, you can go toe to toe with just about anything, except some of Requiem's most OP creations. Add Ebony Mail's poison mist and you can actually melt enemies while blocking!  Archery is a nice added skill, and if you have smithing you can make explosive arrows for those dragons and mages."

If you're going to weasel your way into using Dawnbreaker, you may as well get Spellbreaker since both quests involve eradicating an evil mage that is better off dead. Otherwise, it might be tough taking a dragon head face to face.  I think Wuuthrad (Companion questline axe) might have Daedric armor penetration, so that might be an option.

To get your current situation working: look at all those mods you currently have loaded after Requiem.esp. If a mod is not a patch, you must have a good reason to put it behind Requiem, otherwise load it before.   You also use REQMOD.esp. If I'm not mistaken, that mod is about a year old, so chances are it's made for Requiem 1.7. In that case it will definitely not work with Requiem v1.8 / v1.9.

skyrimrequiem,3dl77w,paradcx,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:09:17 2015 UTC,"Reqmod for me only had one issue: the option to make vulnerable npcs that are flagged sneak attack immune. Even with the option of having the original Requiem value (npcs retain their immunity), it didn't work completely. For example, draug were receiving the standard backstab multiplier of the weapon (e.g., bow=2x) with the 1st Adv. Anatomy Knowledge, and full backstab multiplier with the 2nd perk. In addition, sleeping draug were receiving the damage multiplier that Requiem applies to sleeping npcs. This was fixed by removing Reqmod from the load order and starting a new game. Without Reqmod draug or any other sneak-immune npc are not subjected to any sneak attack, period. Reqmod other features worked without any problem. Since I like Requiem's feature of making certain npcs immune to sneak attacks (reminds me of DnD 3rd edition play sessions), I'm dealing with the grind of leveling crafting skills and the pain of fighting invisible entities."

You don't have the elegant feeling that comes with using faster 1H weapons, but to me there's a certain appeal in weaving away from an enemy's incoming attack and smacking him to the ground with a single power attack.  Also, end-game, 2H absolutely surpasses the offensive capabilities of 1H (see Volendrung or the Ebony Blade).  My biggest issue with it is that 1H weapons actually outrange 2H weapons (I first noticed this in 1.8 and haven't tested it in 1.9, but it makes no sense that a longer weapon hits at a shorter range)."

Also, maximizing your unarmed damage means stacking health and using Transmute Muscles, which just turns you into a meaty tank, which means you are a lot harder to kill... which gets boring.  Late game Unarmed just means running up to most enemies and spamming one mouse button with little regard for what they are doing to you.  I tried to to work in bull rushes and Wards, but neither were more than situationally useful, which did little to make the gameplay any more interesting.

skyrimrequiem,3dizp3,XxBoom,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:41:47 2015 UTC,"I'm aware.  Firstly, using a shield breaks any roleplaying of an empty-handed, monk-style character; secondly, it breaks Improved Mage Armor, which is far superior late game to light armor (especially since dual-cast Transmute Muscles basically forces you to play a character with at least a decent reliance on magic); thirdly, shield + unarmed is vastly inferior to shield + weapon, so again, there's no reason to go the former route unless it is for roleplay reasons.  And if you are roleplaying fighting unarmed, a shield just doesn't fit imo.  Dual Wield Parry might be the answer, but I'm loathe to use unsupported mods that are known to have existing bugs."
skyrimrequiem,3dizp3,saltyshanty,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:17:35 2015 UTC,"I said use a shield so you won't relay on magic. You said you became a tank becuase of that.   What wrong in fighting unarmed with shield when it comes to RP? It doesn't have to be a monk to fight unarmed.   Maybe a brawler broke his knuckles somehow and has to use one instead to guard his torso. He is clunky with weapons and has no skills with them, but knows how to break a jaw.    Or a khajit/argonian fighter who finds fighting with a sword as an insult to his claws (they fight open fisted.) For some RP reason.    Or just fight with a shield only. It kind of do-able. Shield bash all the way."
skyrimrequiem,3dizp3,XxBoom,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:10:33 2015 UTC,"Those are good suggestions, and I'm not saying you're wrong, because RP is purely subjective.  You might not mind using a shield for RP reasons, but for me, it breaks the feel of an ""unarmed"" character.  Also, when I made my unarmed characters in the past, I made them as mages with Improved Mage Armor, as they were relying on dual-cast Transmute Muscles for damage, which takes a ton of magicka (and casting spells was a mildly interesting way of using the empty offhand).  Using a shield cancels Improved Mage Armor (which is much stronger than light armor end-game).  Also, you can't not use Transmute Muscles, as that's where more than half of your potential damage output comes from.  Again, I'm not saying you can't have fun with a shield -- I just feel that the unarmed experience in Requiem is less enjoyable than using a weapon, and it's not as well implemented as in some other RPGs.  It's more of a novelty or secondary skill, and if that's Ogerboss's intention, that's fine.  I'm just not going to build another character around it."

skyrimrequiem,3dizp3,saltyshanty,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:10:01 2015 UTC,"I'm no modded so I don't know how feasible this is, but maybe if someone created a shield with no weight, no armor value, and an invisible model so you could have shield gameplay but still ostensibly remain unarmed.  A block would look like deflecting a blow with your forearm, a bash would be a quick jab to open up the enemy's defenses, and the default raised arm with shield stance would take on a defensive unarmed posture.  It wouldn't benefit from any of the unarmed damage bonuses, but since the intention isn't damage-focused it shouldn't matter."

Without these perks, the spells use double magicka and only have half the effect.   If you only take the first perk with Mage Armor rank 1, you'll get an armor rating of about 40, which is next to nothing. However, taking all perks and the better armor spells will give you a higher armor rating then tempered glass."

skyrimrequiem,3df5w4,pamposzek,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:09:53 2015 UTC,"Try using Enhanced Mage Experience mod, but disable skill based perks.esp, since it's not compatibile. This mod changes alchemy so value depends on rarity of the ingredients. Also, frenzy potions are more useful, stamina regeneration potions are much more useful. And you can't get super expensive potions from rather cheap materials, so it's balanced.  About garlic. You can buy it in some inns, but try making quest for Carlotta in Whiterun. After you do it, you will be able to harvest garlic from her shop stand without stealing. Another way is to start main quest (talk to Jarl of Whiterun, then to a wizard). After their talk you can stop by kitchen in Dragonsreach and harvest about 10-15 garlic, depending on your luck. Also, alchemy vendors might sell it sometimes."
skyrimrequiem,3df5w4,Turija,2,Wed Jul 15 20:29:11 2015 UTC,"That's normal for Requiem.  Healing potions are not worth much and therefore do not contribute towards leveling alchemy much.

Any high value potion will increase the skill pretty rapidly, but most of the high value potions tend to be poisons with effects like damage magicka regen and frenzy."

It's worth 790 Septims and will give you 1 complete level in alchemy if you have alchemy level 5.    In Requiem, the amount of experience you get for making potions is based on the potion amount. You can see the potion worth before making it so try to only make potions worth 100 Septims or more. The top valued potions are in these categories.  Damage Magicka  Damage Stamina  Frenzy  Invisibility  Poison Resistance  Spiritedness  Note: Magicka and Healing potions are worth some of the lowest possible so I wouldn't create any if you're trying to sell them or level up your Alchemy. I generally spend a day gathering ingredients from nature until it gets dark, then sleep and get the well rested perk, then wake up and spend a few hours at the alchemy lab. I generally get 5-10 levels every time I do this and it's a quick and easy/safe way to make money and level up your character."

Neutral Traits:  Practical: -50% experience gain for crafting skills; +50% for practical skills.  Mind over Matter: Magicka bonus, Stamina malus.

skyrimrequiem,3ddytc,CpntBrryCrnch,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:33:39 2015 UTC,"Race-specific bonuses and penalties would be fun. Things more relevant to the race to replace the usual bonuses.  Khajiit as example, because khajiit are awesome:  Khajiit:    Positive:   Sharp Claws: Unarmed attacks deal X bonus damage and apply a small bleeding effect. Multiple, rapid hits increase bleed damage and duration. ""Your claws are so small and blunt and round. Come see - this one's are much much better, yes?"" Lunging Attacks: You can lunge toward your opponents - your forward movement speed increases significantly while performing power attacks/bashes. ""Oho, you think you are safe beyond arm's reach? This one begs to differ."" Longstride: Your movement speed is increased by x%. This bonus is increased to z% when your weapon is sheathed, for you are able to manipulate your center of balance more effectively. ""Cathay does not run on four legs, but he will still run faster than you."" Apex Predator: You are the top of the food chain - the apex predator, the consumer, the devourer. Killing enemies with unarmed power attacks restores x% of your total health. Otherwise, dead bodies drop meat which can be consumed to heal for a lesser amount of health. ""You think the Bosmer are scary, yes? Bah, they are but scavengers. Let this one show you what a real hunter will do ...""     Neutral:   Long Claws: Your claws are longer than that of the usual khajiit. While this makes them excellent for slashing and clawing, they make tightly gripping equipment more difficult. Increases unarmed damage by x, but decreases one-handed and two handed attack speed by y%. Additionally, blocking attacks with weapon or shield drains z% more stamina and lockpicking is more difficult. ""Long ... pretty ... very excellent for cutting and slashing. Less good for other things. Things like opening locked doors or holding a knife ... or a fork. This one ... has trouble with meals."" Lithe: You are small of frame and lightweight. Jumping, sprinting and running all use x% less stamina, and you perform one-handed regular attacks y% more quickly - but you are more prone to staggering, and power attacks take z% longer to perform. ""All that fat must weight you down, yes?"" Silent hunter: You've never been one for loud noises. Being quiet comes naturally to you. When sneaking, you are x% more difficult to detect - however, your aversion to noise means you are poor at shouting at things (if you had to guess, y% less effective). But why would one need to be skilled at shouting, anyway? What a silly talent. "" ... ""     Negative:   Aquaphobia: You don't like water. You really don't like water. When standing in or under water your magicka regenerates x% slower (would be a significant amount). ""It is *not** irrational! Have you ever drowned? No? Go drown yourself, then this one will listen to your experience.*"" Scrawny: You just can't get the force you need behind a swing. Blocking enemies take x% less damage from your swings. ""Scrawny is such a cruel, cruel word ... this one prefers ""sizedly challenged""."" These are not warm sands: You're a native elsweyrian and you really aren't taking a liking to the cold. You take x% more damage from frost attacks. ""Th-this one is not shivering, he is ... purring ... very strongly ...""     ... will probably add more if I think of them. This is fun. :3"

skyrimrequiem,3dcz48,astuertz,1 point,Wed Jul 15 08:21:22 2015 UTC,"A hearty welcome to Falkreath Reddit, traveller!  First of all - YMMV with all the advice, it boils down to individual player skill and knowledge. Now, I am not that proficient with warrior-types but I am proficient with battlemages.  For a start - take an investment in stamina. HA users need it. Bring it up to 150-200 base depending on race (Imperials need the least). At second: here is something to understand: mages>warriors>thieves>mages. That's the combat balance. To counter mages you are either need stamina for bull rush, elemental/magic resists or invest a bit in Archery (3-5 perks) and grab a crossbow to kill the mages/LA archers. It should kill them decently fast. Secondly - familiarize yourself with crafting skills. You gonna need Smithing and Enchanting, Alchemy is less important, but it is not big investment (2-4 perks, basic, benefactor and poisoner is enough, mage catalysis if you have perks to spare). Alchemy is also good money maker. For smithing and enchanting - if you going daedric - you going to need it. Don't go overboard with enchanting - enough to craft 40% elemental resist and later supplement with potions to get to resistance cap. Oh, and grab Shield of Solitude or Spellbraker as your shield - they are awesome. For weapons - Dawnbreaker or Mace of Molag Bal is everything in one package, if your RP allows for daedric quests. If no - craft, temper and enchant as you see fit. Fire or force enchant is probably the best bang for your buck.  Save travels!"
skyrimrequiem,3dcz48,Quawis,1 point,Wed Jul 15 09:06:33 2015 UTC,"That's definitely some good advice! Other than Azura's Star, I never got through too many of the Daerdic Quests in vanilla Skyrim. Before Requiem I was always bored half way through the game (because I could destroy dragons on legendary difficulty.... with very little difficulty).  So it'll be fun to give them a try in requiem where they could make a huge difference.  I enjoy how difficult it is to pick your perks in requiem. Each perk seems very important, and it really tempers how you end up approaching your character based off of your play style.  That shield should work wonders though, especially since I'm playing as a dunmer and have natural resistance to fire already.  I also have the resist magic enchant, but so far, the best I can muster (at least without the Black Star) is like 1% magic resist per item. Definitely not enough to protect me from those brutal spells."
skyrimrequiem,3dcz48,Quawis,1 point,Wed Jul 15 09:31:53 2015 UTC,"No problem ;)  And that 1% sounds reasonable if you have no enchanting perks. If you are a Dunmer - you can try to snitch Ebony Mail, which will give you fire resist cap on a Dunmer, along with some combat health drain from enemies. Get one 50% piece of frost and shock resist and you are set. Grab magic resist of one-handed boost in the rest of enchantment slots and supplement with resist potions. Voila - you are ready for dragons. Tempered ebony mail + rest of ebony armor set is enough to tank a dragon (with shield) even on 400% incoming damage."

I run ASIS after the Requificator (the end of my load order goes RftI, ASIS, FNIS, DSR), no bash.  I should add that I just managed to kill Alduin at level 45 with my archer (light armor, marksmanship, one-handed, alchemy, smithing, enchanting) and it was a tough fight.  I had to climb the nearby mountain/hill/rock and shoot him from a distance with my dragonbone arrows, and dragonrend him to the ground whenever I could, because his mistmen spawns just destroyed me if I let them get close enough."

And props on killing Alduin. I've never fought him yet on a Requiem playthrough (I had no idea he could spawn Mistmen). Sounds like it should be fun, though.  Well, anyways, what I'm getting from here is no OBIS, and I can use Scarcity with all of my mods.

skyrimrequiem,3d76j6,TheJanks,5,Tue Jul 14 01:30:40 2015 UTC,"Requiem - Resources.esp  Requiem - Hard Time.esp  Are both out of date.  I know Hard Times has, in the past, resulted in heavily inflated armor values, and is most likely the source of your ridiculously powerful Imperial Armor.  If the Dragonborn and Hearthfires patches are also from Azirok, they are also obsolete.  You should be using the patches in Another Requiem Patch Central by thetrader as they are updated for the current release of Requiem."
skyrimrequiem,3d76j6,HungryHungryHorkers,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:08:03 2015 UTC,Thank you! That seemed to fix up everything.

Depending on your build, it's possible to take on BFB at lower levels. But the problem is, you will not be able to kill dragons later :)  Could be also some weird save glitch. I had once glitch and Irlieth was dealing 4 thousand damage by her arrows, and everything in Tes5Edit was correct. Starting new game fixed it. But 90 seconds is maybe too fast for the first dragon.."
skyrimrequiem,3d76j6,noxcrab,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:32:28 2015 UTC,The first dragon is at it's weakened state. And Irelith uses her ebony bow and ebony arrows of lightening storm. Few shots and it's dead.

The first time it took me 3 solid hours of play, riding around and past on my horse and swinging at it. The second time I used arrows, then werewolf form, and even that took almost an hour ...  That said - I do like the challenge. :D"
skyrimrequiem,3d76j6,Winsaucerer,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:02:01 2015 UTC,"Interesting.  The first dragon took a while to go down for me, but maybe that was helped by having deadly dragons installed as well.  Not sure."

skyrimrequiem,3d6l63,offendedc,0,Mon Jul 13 22:46:28 2015 UTC,"This is the most recent patcher for Requiem 1.9 (to my knowledge.)  If you have mods that do not fit in the patched mods listed, check out the outdated one that you talked about.  It still works, but doesn't cover recent features, so use it as a last resort.  Otherwise, check out Requiem compatibility to determine if any mods you have will conflict with Requiem.  P.S. not sure if you meant this but Requiem should always be at the bottom of you load order."
skyrimrequiem,3d6l63,Burnspot,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:27:36 2015 UTC,Azirok's patches are way outdated and meant for Requiem 1.7 and perhaps a bit of 1.8 for the most part. Pamposzek listed the right ones.
skyrimrequiem,3d6l63,offendedc,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:17:04 2015 UTC,whoops sorry guys updating it now
skyrimrequiem,3d5q1p,Turija,3,Mon Jul 13 19:01:07 2015 UTC,"The changes I make:  Death timer to 10 seconds - I like to watch my character fall off mountains. Animal poisons don't paralyze - I like the idea conceptually, but I hate completely losing control of my character when spiders ambush me.  The visuals are punishment enough. Cell respawns - I lower this as low as it will go.  The first time I played Requiem, well-traveled roads felt very empty and it drove me nuts.  I want monsters! Vampires raid randomly - I like to live dangerously. Stamina adds Carry Weight +1 - I view Health as strength and Stamina as conditioning, and both aid in hauling heavy things over long distances.  +1 makes a noticeable but not overpowered difference.  I think that's it.  Other than that, I just use the default settings."
skyrimrequiem,3d5q1p,HungryHungryHorkers,2,Mon Jul 13 19:50:16 2015 UTC,Add 25% more received damage anytime I get a little more powerful. Mine is at 150% now and i havent even gotten to the MQ or DLC. The endgame is going to be brutal...
skyrimrequiem,3d5q1p,EloquentGoose,2,Mon Jul 13 21:08:59 2015 UTC,I've added 40 more points to carry weight. I think it's a better balance between realism and comfort now.
skyrimrequiem,3d5q1p,reddxue,2,Mon Jul 13 21:15:33 2015 UTC,"Respawn timers to 10 days, gold and arrow weight to none, and sometimes lockpicking without perks.  I like to go back when stronger and stomp bandits and stuff when I'm stronger  and weight n lockpicking because I just find them annoying to work around nowadays."
skyrimrequiem,3d5q1p,paradcx,2,Mon Jul 13 22:03:32 2015 UTC,"Changes I made so far:  Fearless and steadfast enemies - them annyoing wolves no more. Also it's harder, because near death bandits can still kill you, instead of running.  No visual effect for poisons  Not Requiem MCM, but it has impact: Violens mod - disabling killmoves on player - no more bullshit insta kills from 2 handers mostly."
skyrimrequiem,3d5q1p,pamposzek,2,Tue Jul 14 01:23:22 2015 UTC,"I tend to add lots of difficulty from other angles (actions take time, needs, darkness, prices, roleplaying, etc) so I generally lower the damage received to about 75%. I also use death alternative (and NEVER load) so I have to increase onDeathReloadTime to 10 seconds. I disable visual effects on poisons because I love the idea but hate the implementation (effects are way too strong). I also disable paralysis from animal poison (too strong). As someone else mentioned, I also disable killmoves on player with the mod Violence. I diaable the disharm on low stamina because I find it not vrry attractive or satysfying. Finally I increase the jump height to 125%. An option I'd like to have that's not there is about the stamina drain fron running: I'd like to increase slthe severity of the drain."

skyrimrequiem,3d1xen,Javahooch,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:27:31 2015 UTC,"It's entirely possible, if you invest enough levels into Stamina, to counteract the stamina drain from movement with your own natural stamina regen.  I find this is particularly true of Imperials who become werewolves.  Bandits don't always seem to be affected as much by mass as the player is, presumably because if the game gives them heavy armor then the game also provides them the perks to make them effective in said armor.  In my experience it's not unusual for bandits in heavy armor to be relatively mobile."
skyrimrequiem,3d1xen,HungryHungryHorkers,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:44:20 2015 UTC,"It's entirely possible, if you invest enough levels into Stamina, to counteract the stamina drain from movement with your own natural stamina regen. I find this is particularly true of Imperials who become werewolves.   Not true, the running stamina drain temporarily suppresses your stamina regeneration, so it does not matter how much stamina you could regenerate. The fact is simply that werewolves are not affected by the running stamina due to their supernatural constitution. (This is tied to the werewolf state, not to specific health/stamina thresholds.)   Bandits don't always seem to be affected as much by mass as the player is, presumably because if the game gives them heavy armor then the game also provides them the perks to make them effective in said armor. In my experience it's not unusual for bandits in heavy armor to be relatively mobile.   Depending on their level, bandits have different heavy armor perks. While the higher ranking ones will have a decent set of perks, which prevents them from moving at snail's pace, they should still be noticeably slower than a character in light or no armor."
skyrimrequiem,3d1xen,ogerboss,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:13:11 2015 UTC,Thanks for the replies. I am a werewolf and I was completely wrong about no stamina drain or slowdown with heavy armor. Oops.  Thanks again for the replies.
skyrimrequiem,3d1xen,HungryHungryHorkers,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:57:37 2015 UTC,"Are there other things in the game that override the regen suppression?  In my game, investing in Stamina reduces the drain, and when you reach a certain point, negates it completely.  Though I do have a rather extensive list of plugins and there could very easily be a conflict somewhere that allows for regen despite the suppression effect."
skyrimrequiem,3d1xen,ogerboss,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:44:32 2015 UTC,"The drain is a fixed base value, multiplied by your effective mass penalty from the Mass Effect (use the skills MCM to see it). So it will seem as if the drain becomes lower over time, because your stamina pool increases and you will acquire more perks that reduce the effective mass.  Besides becoming a werewolf, the Windrunner perk in the evasion perk tree also will negate the running stamina drain."
skyrimrequiem,3d0obg,noxcrab,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:04:57 2015 UTC,"Interesting. But if invisiblity doesn't wear off after killmove, it makes it certainly easier - since recasting it makes noise, unless you use potions/dampening rune.  I'm not sure if it's a bug or something. If every dagger kill is silent and still wears off invis."

But having two perks and around 20-30 sneaking, you should be able to sneak with walk speed behind enemies.  In East Empire Company, last section is the hardest. But you can hide behind a boat, wait till enemy is close and backstab him. I would't bother if you can't one shot them. I'd really get two more perks from sneak tree (lvl 25 required).  But, as others said: stick to the shadows. There is one nasty bandit on a ship, who will detect you from far away. Pay attention, and it shouldn't be hard."
