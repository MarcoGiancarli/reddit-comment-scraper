I'm struggling with the thoughts and feelings towards someone in my past, but there's also another from my past who I used to struggle with my feelings for, but not anymore.  I don't always believe in never, but sometimes it really is true; there can be someone you never get over."

We were never meant to meet, to love, to seek solace in each other's arms.   And I suppose, we managed to defy those odds for a while. Those first few months of our relationship was really, really nice. I've been reading through my old journals lately. August 23rd was our first kiss, do you remember? It's so strange seeing my feelings progress. From ""he cradles me the way I wish to be"" to ""you always scare me so.""  I have done you so much wrong. I have put others over you many times. But you know, you won. For the first 5 months you won over everyone else.   When I am in your arms, it's so nice. I wish we can sleep together forever because that makes everything okay. Our fights vanish when you hug me.   But it's scary knowing how easily you can hurt me, and how easily I can hurt you. When you're upset I feel so fucking useless, trying to make things okay but it's never enough, because I'm the one making you sad.   I miss going to your house for the weekends. I liked spending all day on your soft, springy bed and stuffing teddy into cracks. Time whirling around us as you carry league game after league game despite your 400 ping. Hugging you to sleep while wearing one of your nice over-sized shirts and something extra.  I miss korean bbq and overpriced hotpot. Eating with other people always gets me a bit jittery because I'm afraid they won't like the food but with you it's always a breeze. You eat everything. You have a big appetite. I've always liked guys who have big stomachs.   I miss lying on you and watching you play Terraria. I miss Annie Sona botlane. I miss making fun of ""t-t-time!"" together. I miss when we were us.   I loved you too. Maybe I still do. But I think there's no starting over. We are past the point of no return. I have lost nearly every friend I had when I first came to California, and I guess now I'm losing my closest one.   We were never meant to last, but I really wish we did."

UnsentLetters,3dysr0,8pacman,12,Mon Jul 20 17:10:44 2015 UTC,"I read something a while back that has really stuck with me and this post reminded me of it.  I'm going to paraphrase (badly) so I hope anyone who reads this will forgive me.  Essentially most of our actions come down to choosing between comfort and happiness, of the two comfort is easier, it is the ""safe"" choice. It's also the one most people choose.  Happiness on the other hand is the harder road, it requires us to risk ourselves, to let go of comfort and attempt to fly. Most of us spend our lives wanting happiness while clinging to comfort.   Essentially we all want to be happy but seldom actually go for it because it isn't easy, hell sometimes you end up with a broken heart, shattered dreams etc. but with time you often find yourself somewhere far better. Sometimes the chasing what we think is our happiness leads us to something else entirely but is far more worthwhile in the end.  I'm glad you're choosing happiness, be brave, be bold, seize the moment and fight for what you want. We only get one shot at this crazy life so you might as well go for it. Godspeed."
