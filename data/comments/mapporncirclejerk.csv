mapporncirclejerk,3cbgi7,dolan313,2,Tue Jul 7 16:06:20 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong, it's a nice place to visit and it is certainly free from ongoing conflicts that plague the surrounding countries. However, it has A LOT of problems. Jordan has no oil, coastline, rivers, or any natural resources for that matter. It relies entirely on imports and foreign aid (mostly from Saudia Arabia and US) to sustain itself. Because of this, everything is very expensive, relative to the region. There is a 16% sales tax on almost everything, and most restaurants have a 10% cover charge on top of that.  Also, 80% of Jordanians are ex-Palestinians that were displaced after the creation of Israel in 1948. When you ask Jordanians where they are from, they will probably answer ""Palestine"" even if they have never been there. On their Jordanian passports, their nationality is written as ""Palestinian"" which prevents them from going back to the Palestinian territories. Very few Jordanians really want to stay in Jordan. They would all move back to Palestine if they had the chance.  From Western standards, the city of Amman is quite a few steps below what we are used to.  People throw bottles and wrappers on the ground when they are finished using them, there are many lots between buildings covered in unkempt construction material, and almost all the infrastructure is in pretty bad shape. The best example of this is the failed project of the trolley going from Jordan University to the city center. There is space in the median of a street for it, but the project had to be called off because it would not fit under a wrought-iron pedestrian overpass that was probably constructed in two weeks. Likewise, all the skyscrapers visible in the skyline are unfinished and mostly unused.  Overall, it's a beautiful country, but a lot of these problems probably won't ever find a solution."

The film was written and produced by British comedian Sacha Baron Cohen who also plays the title character, Borat Sagdiyev, a fictitious Kazakh journalist travelling through the United States recording real-life interactions with Americans. The film was directed by Larry Charles and distributed by 20th Century Fox. Much of the film features unscripted vignettes of Borat interviewing and interacting with Americans, who believe he is a foreigner with little or no understanding of American customs.  It is the second of three films built around Baron Cohen's characters from Da Ali G Show (2000–04). The first being Ali G Indahouse (2002) (which featured a cameo by Borat), and the third film, Brüno, was released in 2009. The film is produced by Baron Cohen's production company, Four By Two Productions. ""Four By Two"" is Cockney rhyming slang for ""Jew"".

mapporncirclejerk,36tvcw,holybejeebus,12,Fri May 22 07:32:06 2015 UTC,"That's my point. It makes sense to say that Russia is part of both Asia and Europe, because culturally and geographically it is. The same can probably be said of Turkey. Egypt however is African by basically any description, except for a very small peninsula on the Arabian plate, which in and of itself has nothing to do with Asia."
mapporncirclejerk,36tvcw,bethlehemwasweeping,3,Fri May 22 07:37:35 2015 UTC,"Asia isn't a single thing in any physical, political, or cultural sense. It's just the parts of Eurasia that aren't Europe."
mapporncirclejerk,36tvcw,notatallexpected,0,Fri May 22 20:18:40 2015 UTC,"Well there is quite clearly the Eurasian plate, which ends well before Egypt. When you're talking about geopolitical continents, it makes sense to divide Europe and the rest of Eurasia, because they're entirely different civilizations. Really I think if we're dividing things politically or culturally, Arabia and the rest of Arabic civilization (North Africa, Iran, Iraq, Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, etc.) should be their own continent, as they are as different from Asia as Asia is from Europe.  If however you want to divide things based on continental plates, Egypt still isn't part of Asia, it would be split between the African plate and the Arabian one. There is really no logical definition wherein Egypt is at all a part of Asia. This is because our current geopolitical definitions of continents make no sense, as they're not based on culture, civilization, plates, or landmass. It's just a senseless mishmash."

Unlike the hemoglobin in red blood cells found in vertebrates, hemocyanins are not bound to blood cells but are instead suspended directly in the hemolymph.

mapporncirclejerk,336bd1,Cubano07,2,Wed Apr 22 13:30:12 2015 UTC,"1890 British Ultimatum:       The 1890 British Ultimatum was an ultimatum by the British government delivered on 11 January 1890 to Portugal. The ultimatum forced the retreat of Portuguese military forces from areas which had been claimed by Portugal on the basis of historical discovery and recent exploration, but which Britain claimed on the basis of effective occupation. Portugal had attempted to claim a large area of land between its colonies of Mozambique and Angola including most of present-day Zimbabwe and Zambia and a large part of Malawi, which had been and included in Portugal's ""Rose-coloured Map"". It has sometimes been claimed that the British government's objections arose because the Portuguese claims clashed with its aspirations to create a Cape to Cairo Railway linking its colonies from the very south of Africa to those in the north. This seems unlikely, firstly as in 1890 Germany already controlled German East Africa, now Tanzania and Sudan was independent under the Mahdi and secondly the British government was pressed into taking action by Cecil Rhodes, whose British South Africa Company was founded in 1888 south of the Zambezi and the African Lakes Company and British missionaries to the north.

mapporncirclejerk,30kydu,Marcopolo325,4,Sun Mar 29 08:45:27 2015 UTC,"The first came long ago:   An ignorant American cartography professor and apple-maps developer was teaching a class on Gerardus Mercator, known DST advocate.  “Before the class begins, you must get on your knees and worship Mercator and accept that he was the most highly-evolved cartographer the world has ever known, even greater than James Gall and Arno Peters!”  At this moment, a brave, logical European Redditor who was a long-time contributor to sporcle.com and understood the superiority of cylindrical equal-area projections stood up and held up a globe.  “What is the largest continent, pinhead?”  The arrogant professor smirked quite Euro-centrically and smugly replied “Greenland, you stupid pleb! Can't you see how much larger it is than Africa?”  “Wrong,” said the student, and drew a perfect circle encompassing Greenland (which isn't even green smh), “if Greenland is so big, how come there are more people outside this circle than inside?”  The professor was visibly shaken, and dropped his chalk and copy of Nova et Aucta Orbis Terrae Descriptio ad Usum Navigantium Emendate Accommodata. He stormed out of the room crying those distorted conformal Mercator tears, his world collapsing around him. There is no doubt that at this point our professor, Alphons J. Van der Grinten, wished he had received a European education and become more than yet another distributer of lies in our flawed education system, and was kicking himself for never noticing that India has a greater north-south extent than Finland.  The students applauded and all subscribed to /r/mapporn that day and accepted the Peirce Quincuncial projection as the coolest projection ever. There was a school-wide renouncement of outdated colonialist maps and south-up maps (like the ones they definitely 100% use in Australia) were hung up across the northern hemisphere. God himself showed up and enforced geography as a mandatory subject in schools nationwide.  The professor lost his tenure and was fired the next day. He committed suicide and his body was tossed into the Mariana trench.  And that student's name? Harry Beck, creator of the London Tube map."

mapporncirclejerk,2o4u7f,an_enigma,3,Wed Dec 3 12:24:31 2014 UTC,"Onyx River:       The Onyx River is an Antarctic meltwater stream which flows westward through the Wright Valley from Wright Lower Glacier and Lake Brownworth at the foot of the glacier to Lake Vanda, during the few months of the Antarctic summer. Despite being only 32 kilometres (20 mi) in length it is the longest river in Antarctica.   The river flow is away from the ocean, an example of endorheic drainage, as the Wright Glacier blocks the entrance to the valley. It has several tributaries, and there are multiple meteorological stations along the length of the river. Flow levels are highly variable, both during the day and between summers, with the river failing to reach the lake some years. In contrast, it can cause significant erosion in flood years, and was rafted in 1984 by New Zealand researchers. While there are no fish in Onyx River, it does support microscopic life, and the algal blooms can be quite extensive.  The Onyx River is one of the many sites studied by the United States Antarctic Program of the National Science Foundation. The Antarctica New Zealand program once maintained a semi-permanent camp at Lake Vanda which has since been removed. Currently there is a small research shelter at Lake Vanda at its eastern end. Nearby is the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Seismic station at Bull Pass.

The aim of the project was to detonate a nuclear bomb on the Moon which would help in answering some of the mysteries in planetary astronomy and astrogeology, and had the explosive device not entered into a lunar crater, the flash of explosive light would have been faintly visible to people on earth with their naked eye, a show of force resulting in a possible boosting of domestic morale in the capabilities of the United States, a boost that was needed after the Soviet Union took an early lead in the Space Race and who were also working on a similar project.  Neither the Soviet project E-4 nor the US Project A119 were ever carried out, being cancelled primarily out of a fear of a negative public reaction, with the potential militarization of space that it would also have signified, and because a moon landing would undoubtedly be a more popular achievement in the eyes of the American and international public alike.

We already have a great way to transport passengers across the Pacific in a fast, cheap and efficient way (airplanes) and a great and cost-effective way of transporting freight across the ocean (ships).   Assuming the link is somehow built, who are these masses of people who will pay very large sums of money to travel in a very slow manner between Asia and North America on a train instead of on a plane?

It is part of the City of Gosford local government area.  The Aboriginal inhabitants of the Wyoming area before European settlement were the Kuringgai people.  In 1824 Frederick Augustus Hely (1794–1836) purchased 1,340 acres (5.42 km2) of land adjacent to Narara Reserve. Hely named the land after the Wyoming Valley of Pennsylvania, made famous by the 1809 poem Gertrude of Wyoming by Thomas Campbell. The state of Wyoming in the western United States of America, named many years later than the Central Coast town, is also named after the poem.

One of my best friends growing up was living in Brazil but had been born in France, so he was a French citizen.  I don't know today, but at the time France required that all citizens enlisted for mandatory military service at the age of 18. Citizens living out of France were excused, so my friend thought he was OK. Then he got a letter from the French government, letting him know that the exception didn't apply to countries that share a border with France.  We learned that day that, because of the Guyana, Brasil and France share a border! So he was being ordered to present himself to the closest French army base and enlist. The closest French army base was in the Guyana, of course. So he was looking at the prospect of, not only serving in the French military for a year, derailing all his plans, but to do it in FREAKING GUYANA, in the middle of the Amazon rainforest, 2,000 miles from where we lived!  He spent a lot of time and money and finally, I don't know how, obtained a dispensation. But there, Brazil and France share a border man!"

mapporncirclejerk,25g3vu,soffredo,4,Tue May 13 15:53:55 2014 UTC,"Long story short, there was always a member of the United Nations named ""China"" which claimed control over all of China + Taiwan, it's just that in 1945-1971, the seat was held by ROC and from 1971 on it's held by PRC.  The joke is that since PRC claims Taiwan as part of its territory, on maps like this (which aim for political correctness from the UN's perspective, rather than political neutrality) it's marked as if it was part of PRC, and therefore part of the UN."
