I was thinking they were some kind of directional flash taking pictures of everyone's license plate to make some kind of inventory of vehicles in Tucson, or like an amber alert type of deal. Emergency vehicle makes sense though!"
Tucson,3e4d8m,NiceTryKemosabe,6,Tue Jul 21 21:33:41 2015 UTC,"Welcome to Tucson! Did you move here for work or school?  Regardless, now you're here. Here's my 2 cents on your questions:   Bug Bites - It's the worst during monsoon season and you learn to deal with them. If you have a yard, make sure you don't have any standing water to attract mosquitoes. A fire pit is a fun way to hang out at night without being worried about bites. Also bug spray. Blinking white lights at intersections - As previously mentioned this is to signal that an emergency vehicle will be coming through shortly. Monsoon - It's been happening for the past month off and on. The rains come in waves and not all of town gets hit. They typically reside quickly but the big ones will cause flash flooding that can block off access to certain streets. Don't worry, you'll get to experience one soon enough. Heat + Electricity bills - It's really not too bad. I live in a 1,500 sq ft house built in the 40's and my peak bill during the summer hasn't topped $200. It's recommended you keep your thermostat set to 79 but I rock mine at 74. Good vet recommendations - I've got 2 dogs, so not sure on the best cat vet. We currently use Speedway Animal Hospital and they have been solid. Their price point is a bit high but our pets deserve the best. Mexican hanging star lamps - Seriously where can you buy these things?!? Let me know if you find them.   Best of luck settling in. How do you like Tucson so far?"
Tucson,3e4d8m,sunburn_on_the_brain,5,Tue Jul 21 21:54:58 2015 UTC,You can get the star lamps at Borderlands Trading :)

Tucson,3e4d8m,iamelizabethbennet,6,Wed Jul 22 04:10:42 2015 UTC,"Those lamps can be found at Borderlands Trading Company.  There's one on Wrightstown Rd. just after it forks off Tanque Verde, and another at Orange Grove & Oracle.    Mosquitos... they're bastards.  I end up just putting on bug repellent if I'm going to be outside without long pants and sleeves.     As mentioned, the blinking white lights mean there's an emergency vehicle in the area.  They have sensors that pick up the strobe lights on them and they will often hold the green for the ambulance/fire truck.     Monsoon is amazing in how hit-or-miss it can be.  Give it long enough and you'll see places where it hits one side of a street and leaves the other dry.  When they hit, though, they really hit hard.  Some years you get rained on almost every day during monsoon season, other years you don't get much at all.    Electricity bills are likely a product of insulation/inefficient AC unit.  The newer units are much more efficient, although anything will have trouble overcoming poor insulation if your home wasn't built with good insulation.    Central Animal Hospital at Speedway & Alvernon.  Or Valley Animal Hospital on 22nd between Swan & Craycroft.  Valley also does emergency service and I very highly recommend them over anyone else if you have an after-hours emergency."

Tucson,3e4d8m,shugastow,2,Tue Jul 21 21:40:02 2015 UTC,The only real way to deal with Mosquitos is to make sure you have no stagnant water laying around. And after that you just pray they don't bug you.

For vets I'd recommend either Pet Doctor (a little out of your way, but very inexpensive and everyone is friendly and knowledgeable) or University Pet Clinic (a little more of your way).   Also, my electric for a 3bd house runs about $200 in the summer months when we have it set to 78 most of the time. Hope that gives you some perspective. :)"
Tucson,3e4d8m,midwinter-az,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:50:47 2015 UTC,Thanks for the recommendations. Yeah we've got a 3br house also so hopefully I don't get owned when the bill comes. $200 seems ok for summer comfort.
Tucson,3e4d8m,RunningNumbers,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:01:45 2015 UTC,"One thing that might help ease the pain of the high electric bills in the summer: TEP does budget billing. It means that you'll have somewhat higher bills during the low season, but they'll be pretty stable. I just left Tucson (sadly) - when I lived by myself, I was on budget billing and my budget billing for a 2bd/ba was sub-$100."
Tucson,3e4d8m,kmstoner,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:52:31 2015 UTC,"I mean, I wouldn't say it was comfortable living keeping the house at 78 degrees (just a personal preference) but I don't think it would cost too much more to keep it cooler."
Tucson,3e4d8m,TheJewishCowgirl,2,Wed Jul 22 03:34:03 2015 UTC,"Mosquitos - we use citronella oil in our tiki lamps and light them when we sit outside at night. Haven't been bit in three weeks!   Monsoons - Stay the hell out of the washes when they are running! The water will look passable in your car and the next thing you know you're getting pulled out by an emergency crew or worse yet, dead. The rains come and go through June to August, you'll get hit eventually.  Electricity bills - we have evaporative cooling and AC in our house. We use AC during monsoon season and switch over to evaporative when it dries out. It's hard to escape the high rates in the summer months, but you'll appreciate the lows come fall and ""winter""  Edit: Welcome to Tucson! It's a great city with lots to do, just make sure to take water with you everywhere you go!"
Tucson,3e4d8m,Jackafied,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:34:01 2015 UTC,"Best cat vet is Dr. Amanda Maus (yes, her real name) at Catalina Pet Hospital - corner of Ft Lowell & Alvernon. I do a lot of petsitting and most of my people drive in from all parts of town just to go to Catalina - they have a great reputation, and I take both my cats there, too.   I wish I had a fix for the mosquito problem, but I've been here most of my life and just have to resort to wearing thin pajama pants when I'm outside. I'm one of those people who's irresistible to mosquitoes  :(  No spray, candle, or trap has ever worked for me."
Tucson,3e4d8m,Cardiomyopathy,0,Tue Jul 21 22:56:37 2015 UTC,Bugs might be kissing bugs. Buy some insect repellent or candles from the hardware store.  Blinking lights are for emergency vehicles.  Monsoon is a typical scattered T-Storm in the Midwest.  I play $50 for AC. Either you are cooling too much square footage or have bad insulation. Maybe you can leave windows open at night and use fans.
Tucson,3e4d8m,braelynjane,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:52:35 2015 UTC,"As for window tinting, contact the Specialists. Pay a bit more for the higher grade tint as it keeps it a bit cooler. You can also get windows on your home done if interested, which helps lower cooling costs. I generally keep my thermostat at about 80-82. But I have acclimated over the years of living here.  Others have already answered your questions regarding other items. Welcome to Tucson.  PS Make sure to keep your place sprayed for pests, depending on where you live you can get a slew of creepy and painful spiders/scorpions/etc. (Just a bit of advice)"

My husband is a corporate executive, so we need a home where we can entertain the board members a few times annually.  I want the same things we currently have - over 5000 sq ft, more than 1 acre, about 30 minutes away from downtown amenities, low crime.    Javelina nd Coyotes are no issue.  Most new construction bores me.  I don't want to be too close to traffic - bad for your health."
Tucson,3e09le,betucsonan,2,Tue Jul 21 15:19:39 2015 UTC,"You likely want to look at the Catalina Foothills, then, or a few select neighborhoods to the West of town. Look along Camino De Oeste on the far West area of town (actually you've left town and are in the county at that point) and you'll find a number of large square footage homes with land. The Catalina Foothills will have those as well.  The difference would be that the Catalina Foothills is a more mature neighborhood, more dense (though, not ""dense"" by any city standard), and offering many more amenities. It has been the city's default ""wealthy"" neighborhood for as long as anybody alive can remember. There are a number of new homes but also a good inventory of older, though very nice, homes (some architectural gems as well).  Both areas will get you into town very quickly, offer low crime and don't have a lot of traffic (though the Foothills has more, as Sunrise/Skyline/Ina is a major thoroughfare).

Also check out Tanque Verde. I'd say the former is more suburbs and the latter more ranch, though both are way up there price-wise in comparison to the rest of Tucson.

Tucson,3e09le,phorkor,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:27:35 2015 UTC,"My wife and I just leased a house and we're relocating in two weeks. If you're looking for an apartment, this might not apply.   To be completely honest, what you see in an area or what you see online can look 100% different in person especially depending on your budget. The top of our budget was $1400 and we looked at 6 houses in various parts of Tucson. I don't really know all the areas by name but we looked at places in Sam Hughes, Poets Square, Alvernon and 3rd area, just North of the University, just West of the University, 4th Avenue area and a place off Sweetwater a bit to the North West. Some houses that looked great in pictures, looked not so great in person. Many that were close to the University were meant for college students. They were older homes that were kept up enough to keep college students happy, yet not kept up enough for my wife and I. We ended up getting the place off Sweetwater because it was the only nice house we saw, it is away from students yet not too far from the University so our commute won't be too bad.   All that said, I wouldn't recommend picking a place from a distance unless your budget starts at $1400 and goes up from there. If your budget is $1400 and below, you will want to see the place first."

Tucson,3e09le,FUCK_ANAL_POTATOES,2,Tue Jul 21 15:20:34 2015 UTC,"In that case, I'd look north and north west. North seemed to have nicer, but more expensive houses. The place we got is in a small gated neighborhood off sweetwater and silverbell. Looking at zillow, there are some houses ranging from the $200k's to $400k's. It's a little remote I guess you'd say, but we're coming from Houston so we wanted something a bit outside the city since we've always lived right in the center of 6 million people. My wife will be working at the University and we clocked it at about 17 minutes with no traffic and no freeway driving so it's not too far from the actual city parts. Well, I guess ""17 minutes"" and ""not too far"" depend on where you're coming from. In Houston 15-20 minutes is pretty close when it takes an hour to get from one side of the city to the other on the freeway without traffic. Add traffic in and you get a 2.5 hour commute."

Tucson,3e09le,PunksPrettyMuchDead,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:14:02 2015 UTC,"You're married, so you're probably not the young college drinker. You're from a rural area with no crime and bears. Now location might depend on the husbands new job.   In northwest part, Marana is better than Tucson. Lots of areas away from other people but still close to the interstate so you can get around. Lots of good things happening in the Marana area.  In northeast, older developed neighborhoods and more money and less crime. Long commute across town because the interstate does not go there. Lots of restaurants, shopping and things to do.  In southeast, you're close to the Davis Monthan AFB and depending on the area there might be a little more crime and you might drive a little farther for amenities. Still a nice area.   In the southwest, older part of town, less things to do, a lot more crime. This is where a lot of immigrants from Mexico, both legal and illegal, are. You'll see a lot of vehicles with Mexican license plates. There are a lot of bars and great Mexican restaurants, but very little other shopping centers or things to do, so you end up driving into other parts of Tucson a lot.   In the City of South Tucson, lots of crime and nothing to do.  In central Tucson, overpriced older areas because of the U of A. More crime, some things to do, mostly related to drinking and dancing. It's geared for the college kids. Downtown Tucson is very small and some money has been spent ""revitalizing"" the area, but it's mostly bars and nightclubs and little eclectic restaurants.   There is some development to the southwest of Tucson, near Kinney and Ano and on west Valencia Road, but currently no shopping centers although Wal-Mart is supposed to build out there. More rural setting but just a few minutes back to town and to the interstate. Less crime.   South of Tucson is the master planned development of Sahuarita. Houses all look similar and you're constantly driving back into Tucson, but it's popular and has some amenities nearby.   Personally, we've been in the Kinney and Ajo area for decades and would stay, but our daughter is going to a charter school that is in east Tucson, so we're looking to relocate. The area east of Swan and west of Kolb and south of Grant and north of 22nd is a really nice area for the most part. Each neighborhood is different, of course, but that might narrow it down for you.  Speaking of schools, TUSD sucks. The Sunnyside school district is not very good. Amphi and Flowing Wells districts are better. Some charter schools are really good.   Good luck in Tucson!"

Tucson,3dzlue,iirvington,2,Tue Jul 21 02:06:32 2015 UTC,Well what you said about red lights without protected lanes you can pass on the right as long as you don't go off road to do so (bike lane fine as long as no bikes) I ride motorcycles and had to attend traffic school for a citation and had this specific question the instructor was an ex cop as well and she gave this answer hope it helps!  PS. I do it all the time and have never had a problem hope they legalize all splitting here eventually

Tucson,3dzlue,johnkiniston,2,Tue Jul 21 19:48:03 2015 UTC,"So, I just moved to Tucson from California a month or two ago for school. I used to lane split there all of the time, on the freeway in traffic, and at long traffic lights. It really bugs me that lane splitting is not legal in most states, often when there are asinine things like no helmet laws, as is the case in Arizona. It's even more bothersome that I have almost been rear ended three times in a month and a half while stopped here at traffic lights because I didn't want to get a ticket for splitting. I do hope more states legalize filtering as it's my opinion that it is safer for motorcyclists than not having the option to do so. Here is a recent report from the California Office of Traffic Safety that gives many statistics about lane splitting, where others can make their own opinion about lane splitting if they like.  But to answer your actual questions, OP, I do lane split from time to time, usually at super long traffic lights when it's 100+ degrees outside. It speeds up traffic for everybody, not just me. I have not been ticketed for it either, most likely because no police officers have seen me do it. YMMV."

They said they'd call me in a few hours. 7 hours later I call after class and they're installing a whole bunch of stuff in my car. I'm a poor college student too! Felt pressured into it, told them not to do oil change because I couldn't afford it, they got annoyed that I called and extended it to the next day when they said they'd finish it that day. Next day they added a $50 dollar piece because it ""needed a new one"". I didn't even want the $30 oil change because I'm breaking the bank.   All in all, wanted to see what was wrong and get a price, hoping for maybe $200 and if more, hold off until I could comfortably afford it. Ended up paying them $500 because they kept installing stuff without asking me and didn't want them to throw my old stuff back all annoyed and have my car worse then before.  They didn't even fix the problem, but I don't ever want to go back because I fear for my bank account. Also, found a fake 5 star review with my same car model on the same day I took it home."

Tucson,3domwt,throwawaytucsonjob,5,Fri Jul 17 23:57:57 2015 UTC,"26 and lesbian, moved here kind of recently. IBTs has more women than most gay bars, but it's still very much dominated by men. La Co the last Friday of the month is nice. Last fall there was actually an LGBTQ+ young professional mixer at La Co, it was hosted by the university I think. You'll meet a lot of lesbian and/or queer women around town though. Antigone Books is a feminist bookstore that's definitely worth checking out. Fluxx Studio is queer as well (performance art center; they do a fundraiser at La Co some Saturdays,) and Casa Libre is a poetry/arts center that's mostly queer. Surly Wench (a bar, kind of hipster-grunge) also has a pretty gay feel though I've definitely had negative interactions with men who don't recognize when two women are out together. Cafe Passe is a coffee shop that is or at least feels gayer than most. There's a comedy group called Female Storytellers that is a little bit gay. Also Tucson has a big burlesque scene, I don't know a lot about it because it's not my thing but it is pretty queer. There's a facebook group for 'Lesbians of Arizona' that is also totally not my thing so I haven't engaged with it, but people post a lot (a lot) of looking-to-date-an-xyz type inquiries.  One thing I was not expecting when I moved here but may be good to know -- people here tend to adhere to a butch/femme dichotomy a little more than up north.   It's typical to see two women walking down the streets who are obviously a couple, and Tucson feels actually safer than most of the larger urban areas I've lived. I've never been to Minneapolis but did live in other midwest cities; feel free to message me if you want more info!"
Tucson,3domwt,Cardiomyopathy,3,Sat Jul 18 12:59:38 2015 UTC,"I just moved here from new jersey suburbs and it doesn't feel too different from that.  Definitely feels smaller than expected for its population.  The city is pretty spread out and the buildings are short, that probably has something to do with it.  Sorry I can't offer you much insight on the dating front, but if it means anything, so far Tucson seems more liberal than I expected considering how red Arizona is overall.  And the university here is a big deal so I'm sure you can find grad students around your age."
Tucson,3domwt,JZBreeze,2,Sat Jul 18 00:30:27 2015 UTC,"To add onto this, the University has a great LGBTQ community and support system. So I would say down by the University would be your best bet for finding a well educated LGBTQ dating scene."
Tucson,3domwt,BEEDOOBEDOO,3,Sat Jul 18 09:55:50 2015 UTC,"I'm not too sure about the dating scene (straight female here), but we do have at least one gay bar (IBTs) and probably more that I don't know about. Definitely a small-city feel. We have everything except IKEA (closest one is in Phoenix), but it doesn't feel like a bazillion people live here. There's a lot of fun stuff to do, particularly a lot of outdoorsy things. Hiking, Sabino Canyon, the Desert Museum, etc. Plenty of shopping/bars/entertainment in general. Hope that helps a bit!"
Tucson,3domwt,jtherion,3,Sat Jul 18 03:03:47 2015 UTC,"I spent a decade in Pittsburgh and the community was very strong there, so when I moved back to Tucson last year I noticed a drop-off in ""outwardness."" But lately I've noticed a lot of public same-sex hand holding. That sounds silly, but to me it's a big deal to be able to express affection openly and it's been very nice to see it. Don't know if it's coincidence, the recent Courty ruling, or what, but it seems to be picking up. I am straight, full disclosure, so I can't comment on the state of the dating scene.   Tucson has a meh-size feeling. There is a section of town, focused severely on the intersection of 4th Avenue and Congress Street, that is quite active, fun and awesome and would make a very very nice neighborhood scene in a large city. And then there's basically not much else. So I treat Tucson as a small town and I ignore the urban sprawl that gives the population numbers (1 million in the metro area now) but adds little to the culture of the city (unless by culture you mean SUV's and pre-fab houses, that is). So, ""smaller,"" certainly, to answer your question more directly, but as a 20-something you will have plenty of fun here ... it's a fun town if you have the right attitude. When I tell people from Pittsburgh about I say this: you will have to make it fun, it won't provide the fun on a platter like you're used to. But if you make it fun, you will find no shortage of willing partners and you will end up loving it."
Tucson,3domwt,betucsonan,2,Sat Jul 18 03:04:11 2015 UTC,"Dunno about the lesbian dating scene as a married guy, but I know lots of girls who are in relationships with other girls. Definitely a smaller city vibe than Minneapolis. JZBreeze is right, the UofA is a big deal, so you'd probably want to live near there. Tucson is nice, I'm visiting San Francisco right now, and I actually miss home. You can have some space to yourself and still go out and be around people if/when you want to."
Tucson,3domwt,worldwidewoot,2,Sat Jul 18 02:40:38 2015 UTC,"Hey, 28/f, single, lesbian.  Honestly the the LGBT scene here isn't the best. Tucson has a very small town feel & there isn't much to do as far as queer events.  The main gay bar here is called IBT's. The times I've gone have been jam packed with gay men with a few gay women here & there, mostly on the patio.  La Cocina hosts a queer dance party once a month. It's pretty small but there's a few gay women who show up.  You may want to checkout meetup.com, there's a few lesbian groups on there. One of the bigger ones is the most active, however in my experience it's mostly older women attending the events."
Tucson,3domwt,Demands_pizza,0,Sat Jul 18 02:58:13 2015 UTC,"Arizona is pretty libertarian, so no-one will give a shit if you're gay or not, hence not many lgbtqftrrxyz events.

I've only lived here a year, so take my information with a grain of salt, but the night life scene has 3 main areas. University is dominated by students. Downtown has a blend of everyone and much more life recently according to the locals I know. 4th Ave seems to be filled with more culture and locals.  Of course you have your random bars outside of these areas too, but I usually decide what scene I'm looking for then head to one of the 3 areas mentioned. I'd be happy to suggest specific places if you can provide more details on the scene you like."
Tucson,3dnxmu,NiceTryKemosabe,3,Fri Jul 17 20:51:00 2015 UTC,"You should check out The Shelter on Grant and Alvernon.

Tucson,3dnxmu,AZ_CowboyJones,2,Fri Jul 17 21:33:14 2015 UTC,"Agreed - the Shelter is awesome. I've made a mini bar crawl from my house to a friends out of Dante's, the Bay Horse, The Mint, and finally The Shelter. Good times are had by all (and by all, I mean me)."
Tucson,3dnxmu,betucsonan,2,Sat Jul 18 02:46:35 2015 UTC,"Lot of variables in the apartment question. What do you like and how much can you, or are you willing to, spend on it? As you may remember, Tucson apartments range from the ultra-lux to roach-infested crapholes and a bit of everything in between.  I have lived at various times all over this city and I'll say the most fun I ever had living in an apartment was at the Legends at La Paloma back in 2000 or so. Why? It was relatively easy to get into town for shenanigans, and if I wanted to chill out I had pools and jacuzzis at my disposal. My apartment had a huge picture-window view of the Catalinas and sometimes I'd just put some music on, indulge myself, and stare at the friggin' mountains.  In town is more of a crapshoot, but probably worth it if you want to hang out near things to do. I can't give apartment recs, but houses for rent are aplenty. I just moved out of one near Grant/Campbell and it was great fun - the stretch of Campbell from Grant to Ft. Lowell is pretty top-notch for food and what-not, and it was close enough to walk down to the Western-most stop of the street car and take that downtown.  Insofar as going out - Congress and 4th remain the primary options. Everything else will be one cool bar isolated from others, so if you want to bar-hop you are SOL, but not everybody barhops. The Shelter has already been mentioned. I'll throw in my vote for the Golden Nugget as well, and also Danny's Baboquivari Lounge. Kon Tiki goes without saying. I recently moved West and have only been there once, but the crowd at Rusty's on Grant and Silverbell seemed pretty cool ... more ""sports bar"" than I usually like, but on this side of town I guess we take what we can get.

Tucson,3dl9yc,nathanboykiw,3,Fri Jul 17 04:40:45 2015 UTC,"Had my card for nearly a year now. Here is a review of some places I have been.   Purple Med Healing Center: Not sure if still open, but this is where you go for $25 1/8s on Tuesdays. Good thing is that the bud is decent. Not bad. Not great. Just good enough. It will have some seeds in it, which is nice if you're looking to start a side project but not nice if you want all bud. But hey, its $25 an eighth. It is located in what I feel is a somewhat sketchy location that has somewhat sketchy clientele. First and only time I went there was what looked to be a homeless girl sitting in the hallway wailing in ""pain"" until a kind patient let her go ahead of him. There were like 5 people ahead of her. Suddenly, she gets her weed and its like she's never felt pain before and is skipping around the lobby. The atmosphere really turned me off so I never went back. They might have an ATM. I don't remember. On a scale of 1 - 10 I give it a 4.   Downtown Dispensary: Pretty good. Bud is high quality and they offer a lot of good products. Budtenders tend to be good and know what they are doing  Prices are average but if you go with the deals they help. They have a good balance of casual yet professional. Safe area. No sketchy people hanging about. Everything is weighed out at checkout. I only had one bad experience where a budtender completely ignored what I was wanting (wanted to try an o pen) and sold me a vial of tincture and said I could use it in a vape pen. Yes, you can use it, but no, it isn't the same in potency or effect. He seemed to be new and I don't think he lasted long because those folks are trying to be useful and he was not helping. They sometimes have a dog running around. He's neat. I think they have an ATM but dunno. I give it an 8 out of 10.   SAINTS: I have mixed feelings about this place. Hands down, the widest variety of bud in town. I don't mean that they have a lot of strains, I mean they have DOZENS of strains. Stuff no one else has. Stuff they grow themselves, too. Prices are not great. You can pay $60 for 1/8 of top shelf (they have top/mid/lower tiered prices). The good thing is they will have specials that can dramatically reduce your costs if you're interested in the strains their deals apply to. They have a variety of other things too, like edibles and concentrates. Only place I have been to that has a legit security guard on duty all the time. Atmosphere is OK. Wait time is pretty low. Budtenders are...odd. I like them, but they seem pretty introverted for budtenders. That's not a totally bad thing, just don't go on expecting a lively conversation. The good thing is they don't take tips, so any attitude you get - mostly good attitude - is genuine and not for tips. Bud quality is good. These aren't frosty High Time nugs, but they're good. They are more potent than they appear and maybe could have used more curing, but good. ATM on sight and taxes are included in the price. I give it 7 out of 10 stars for price.   Prime Leaf: the only thing I don't like about this place is the parking! Parking situation is claustrophobic but the restaurant next-door is yummy. Budtenders are all really nice and personable. They always have movies playing in the lobby. Prices are average. Expect $40-$55 and eighth. Bud is good quality. Most of the stuff looks pretty frosty and is true to the strain. They have about a dozen strains to choose from. Lots of concentrates and edibles. I had one negative experience. Wanted to buy some shatter and it wasn't in the computer yet so I had to wait 20 minutes but had to go to work and could not wait. They said if I came back they'd give me 20% off my next order for the inconvenience. Went back this Friday and they were true to their word. They give you your stuff in a disposable plastic take out container thing, which is really weird, but hey free dishes. ATM in the lobby. 9/10.  Bloom: This is my favourite but it gets mixed reaction for understandable reasons. The staff are friendly and professional. Prices are the best in Tucson at $35 an eighth for all strains. They typically have a good mix of popular strains and some from left field. Buds look like the stuff you see in High Times and are usually very frosty. The downside is that they pre-package the bud. I don't mind, but this means there is a potential for your bud to be too moist or even too dry depending on which part of the curing process it happened to be bagged. It can mean getting more stem than you want. I've never had an issue, but the potential is there. They have a variety of edibles and concentrates too. ATM on site. Lots of seating in the main lobby. Tends to be kinda busy on Fridays.  10/10 for me.   Download the Leafly app. It will show you the dispensaries in your area and prices (at least they show prices on Android). Also has great info/reviews for strains.   TL;DR: Purple Med - nope. Downtown - pretty good. SAINTS - Yes if it's payday or you're up for something new. Prime Leaf - Great. Bloom - Great."

Tucson,3dl9yc,CustosClavium,2,Sat Jul 18 20:31:54 2015 UTC,"Crad holder from the start of prop 203 here. IMO Green halo is hands down the best consistent prices and quality. Along with 10$ gram tuesdays. Desert bloom releaf center has good top shelf bud but is way to expensive and the stuff at green halo is cheaper and same if not better quality.  Stay away from prime leaf, bloom dispensary (don't confuse with bloom releaf center)  and purple med healing center.  Those places are horrible . Earths healing and downtown dispensary are also decent.  But if you want the best. Go to green halo. Ill give you specific strain rerecommendations if you reply with what Your preference"

Bloom is one of the cheapest out of them all, and they have some decent bud. In fact, they have some of the same strains as Green Halo (agent orange, blue dream, etc.) for cheaper prices. $260 for an O is their normal price, but they have $200 O specials all the time. Plus first time patients get half off an eighth. However, Green Halo has Shatterday, so there's $40/g for some nice concentrates. That's nice."
Tucson,3dl9yc,DfizzleShizzle,2,Sat Jul 18 14:00:38 2015 UTC,"I just got my card two days ago and have only been to the Prime Leaf so far, but that place was really nice. Before moving to Tucson I visited Colorado a bit and went to dispensaries there and they were usually crowded, small, and only had like four or five strains. The prime leaf had a nice sized retail room and like fifteen or twenty strains to chose from. And I got $30 off an eighth because I was a new customer. Definitely a nice place. Their weed is really good too.   I also have a friend that swears by the downtown dispensary, so when I run out of this stuff I'll probably go there. They also have a really great deal for first time customers to, so I feel like it make sense to do that next time"

Green halo is pretty damn good but I've been disappointed in some of their strains, you have to get the right ones. The Larry OG and agent orange are the bombdiggity. The other strains IMO are a gamble or at least didn't stick out in my mind like the other 2 did (or I just didn't try them). They do however make their own dank edibles they sell for pretty good prices cause they're made there. $10 Tuesdays are dope If you're first in the door, otherwise make sure your phone is nice and charged cause you're gonna be waiting a while"

Tucson Gadgets and Games is my favorite by the way. It has the best vibe and is more board game focused than the others.   I just fell in love with a place called Cafe Mox/Card Kingdom in Seattle.

We're not quite up their with some of the super-friendly cities that people talk about in like Europe, but I know plenty of people in school who had no problems riding to school (even from many miles away if your fine with waking up a little bit earlier).   The campus is also very bike friendly, although it can get hectic with the amount of people and bikes interacting together.

I'm living just south of campus in the neighborhood between 6th and Broadway.

The reason I thought an apartment would be better was because I was under the impression you get maintenance and facilities in some, so I thought maybe that would be helpful in case something goes wrong since it's a new place and I'd be living alone. Bad idea you think? I guess stand alone places would certainly reduce my cost by quite a bit and that will be very helpful!"
Tucson,3dee8h,ConvertsToMetric,2,Wed Jul 15 21:51:25 2015 UTC,"Usually when you rent a place, they have a property manager who will handle everything in regards to maintenance. But, an apartment does make sense since you are living alone and they also usually have a gym/pool/laundry room. The problem is that there aren't really any that are great around the U of A. If you go a little further away from campus, apartments will become an good option."
Tucson,3dee8h,RunningNumbers,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:39:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's the issue. Most that I've found are at least 2 miles away and the further I go, the cheaper and better they get, so I look at all these nice houses which I can't stay in even though they are cheap because they're just too far away! :/"

Tucson,3dee8h,Ayers14,3,Wed Jul 15 22:47:17 2015 UTC,"So I am a new grad student as well, and I have a place at the Casa Club Condominiums. It's a nice and safe complex right off of Campbell with plenty of food places and things to do close by. It's exactly 2 miles north of campus and is very easy to bike to. Most people rent, I believe, and it's fairly cheap, ~$500/month give or take."
Tucson,3degah,YAMSSN,2,Wed Jul 15 17:07:57 2015 UTC,I park in the University and 6th avenue area. It's free parking on the side of the road and it's maybe a 10-15 minute walk to campus.
Tucson,3degah,breadpackwasyes,2,Wed Jul 15 18:00:39 2015 UTC,"You can also park for free on 9th and 10th street (South of campus) between Campbell and First Ave. It's approximately 10-15 minute walk onto campus depending on the time of day you park. If you get there early enough (~8am), you have your pick of spots. If you come later than 9am, you'll be driving up and down the streets looking for an open spot, so you need to give yourself time to find one."
Tucson,3degah,LASER_IN_USE,2,Wed Jul 15 18:05:19 2015 UTC,Take a look at Tucson's non-resident parking program. Some spots are significantly cheaper than UA's parking.
Tucson,3degah,eddiereds,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:02:45 2015 UTC,"Depends on how close-far you want to be.  South of six is the cheapest parking on campus (I think is like 400 a year).  North of Speedway there might be some residential areas with no parking restriction, but AFAIK if you want to be in a walkable distance, you might have to pay."
Tucson,3degah,leonoel,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:51:44 2015 UTC,"I used to park on Linden, about 4 blocks North of Speedway. It s, at least at the time, the closest street that does not require a parking permit. I also spent most my time on the North end of campus, witch helped."
Tucson,3degah,mercyandgrace,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:11:31 2015 UTC,"If you don't mind the limited CatTram bus hours, look into getting a CatTram pass. They are cheaper than the parking passes. My first semester I would park at Ft. Lowell and Mountain and take the CatTram bus to campus. You could also look into any parking that is near the lightrail (I forget what it's called)."
Tucson,3degah,ultimentra,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:30:58 2015 UTC,I have a class that ends at 6:15 and I read that the lot on Ft. Lowell and Mountain is only open until 6:30. Are they strict on that? That was my first choice. I will have a look around and see if there is anything around the light rail or whatever. Thanks.
Tucson,3degah,ultimentra,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:52:35 2015 UTC,"Yea that last bus is gonna leave whether you are there or not. I think the last stop is at 1st street near the LSB. Might want to look into that, not sure if its changed."
Tucson,3degah,RunningNumbers,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:56:44 2015 UTC,"Ok, if you get in before 7AM you can get a free spot on Vine south of 9th Street. I know, because employees would always park outside my window."
Tucson,3degah,C3PO1Fan,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:33:55 2015 UTC,"If you're a person who manages your time well, and you're a morning person or only have evening classes you can disregard this comment.  You'll be able to make it to one of the free spots or parking meters with time to spare.    If you're like me, though, and you're going to end up maybe five minutes early to class (if that) instead of an hour early to class, get a garage or lot pass.  It's expensive, it's excessive, I totally agree.  But it is such a stress easer that for me, it was worth it to have a couple of ramen weeks every semester to have a garage/lot pass.  For three semesters I tried to exploit all the free and cheap parking and in the end often was parking in one of the garages in desperation and ultimately spending MORE than a year parking pass for a single semester worth of parking.  Once I got a garage pass it majorly reduced my stress level and gave me a predictable travel time every day and let me put energy I was wasting on worry about parking into school."

There is no gas on it so start with a full tank.   I did it with some friends on scooters earlier this year and it took about 4 hours to go the 100 some odd miles from Alpine to Morenci."

Tucson,3dcu42,PunksPrettyMuchDead,5,Sat Jul 18 05:44:08 2015 UTC,"Oh dude, this one I can answer!!!  For road cars, take the highway from Morenci to Alpine. 90 miles of switchbacks, and trucks aren't allowed! Also, the road to Show Low goes through a pretty nice canyon, and you can come back through Morenci to get both the canyon and Devil's Highway. Globe to Phoenix is nice, but then you're in Phoenix. :(  Sonoita is nice, and a bit scenic, but it's not very twisty. If you go through Sonoita to Huachuca City, and then From Sierra Vista to Bisbee, it's quite nice driving east of the San Pedro River, and then Bisbee is an awesome place to hang out for a day.  If you've got some ground clearance, Box Canyon near Florence is great for jeeps, SUV's, and my Subaru. There is a dirt road from Oracle to the top of Mt. Lemmon, or a great highway from Globe to Young that comes out on Hwy 260 west of Heber, up north. Redington pass is also a nice drive, and there are some more difficult trails if your vehicle is up for it."
Tucson,3dcu42,johnkiniston,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:30:15 2015 UTC,"The Morenci to Alpine road is Route 191 that I mentioned earlier :) Old 666.  It is pretty great, I enjoyed driving through an active copper mine and seeing the HUGE trucks look tiny because they were so far down in the pit."

Tucson,3dcu42,betucsonan,3,Wed Jul 15 16:04:10 2015 UTC,You can take the 77 to Globe and then the 60 to Show Low if you have time. One the way to Globe there are some chances to stop along the Gila River which can be fun. Then once you leave Globe and start to get into the White Mountains the road gets really interesting ...

Tucson,3dcu42,C3PO1Fan,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:31:16 2015 UTC,"Most of my favorites have been mentioned.      Some other good ones:    77 to 79 Takes about a half hour longer to get to the Phoenix area than the freeway but it's really quiet, lots of desert plants to look at in the day, great star gazing at night. Hunter Canyon Road to 83 to the 10: Go almost to Mexico via Sierra Vista, and turn into Coronado Forest and work your way back north through it.  A lot of this is dirt road but I've handled it in a PT Cruiser so a decent vehicle probably will be O.K.  You're not going to go very fast through the forest/mountain but you'll get lots of curves Ajo Road (86) to Buenos Aries National Wildlife Refuge:  The drive is fairly simple, but I recommend because there are some great birdspotting opportunities without even leaving the road.  Very little traffic (the border patrol might be the only people you see). N Mescal Road: Not super challenging and you probably won't go too fast since it's mostly dirt road, but there are interesting things to look at.  People live out here but it's mostly isolated.  Mt. Graham (366) has some amazing views, and it has seasons, so if you want to see fall when it's fall, head here and watch all trees change color.  Lots of curves, not a lot of speed (although you'll feel like you're flying once you get to the bottom of the mountain and can go 50).   There's some really cool drives in Northern AZ too but we start to leave what most people consider reasonable for a day trip if I get into that."

Tucson,3dc0t6,iamamawg,3,Wed Jul 15 02:26:35 2015 UTC,"Humidity and moisture help our noses pick up ALL smells. So it could be anything that's been collecting on the street or in the dirt that suddenly starts to smell when it gets wet--garbage, urine, particulate auto pollution, wildfire soot. It could very well be cat piss, since there's a lot of stray cats around.  Creosote has a particular ""tar"" or ""pitch"" smell that comes out when the plants draw in moisture. To me, it always smells like railroad tracks, because they treat the timbers with creosote tar."
Tucson,3dc0t6,Eskaban,2,Wed Jul 15 15:49:02 2015 UTC,"Depending on what part of town you are in, it might be the sewage treatment plant. I'm guessing the moisture in the air might pick up the odor and carry it downwind. I notice it often when I'm on the west side of town.   Or maybe it is just the creosote. Next time you see one, grab some leaves, rub them between your finger, and smell them. You should be able to tell then if that is what you were smelling, but everyone I know loives that smell."
Tucson,3dc0t6,ipauljr44,7,Wed Jul 15 20:21:18 2015 UTC,It is the creosote bush (larrea tridentata). Tucsonans like to pretend that it doesn't smell like gym socks.

Tucson,3dc0t6,NeauxDu,2,Thu Jul 16 01:13:47 2015 UTC,"I live in midtown, and I attribute the piss smell to actual piss. We have coyotes and javelinas in the neighborhood [Speedway/Craycroft], and people walking their dogs. I'm just guessing, but it seems likely that the rain would bring out the smells, at least until there is enough rain to wash them away."
Tucson,3dc0t6,ilovemygreyhound,2,Wed Jul 15 04:37:35 2015 UTC,In my neighborhood it is stray cats. There are a couple houses that just walking down the street it smells like a giant dirty litterbox. There will never be enough rain to wash it away.
Tucson,3dc0t6,darknessforever,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:04:46 2015 UTC,"I'll chalk this up to either people like myself having grown up with the smell and loving it (some people like Vegemite for gods sake!) or perhaps much like cilantro being a polarizing taste (some people with a certain gene taste it like toothepaste), it smells different to some folk.
