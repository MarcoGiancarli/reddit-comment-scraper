But I tried to apply for a short amount of time to my local store, where I knew the manager, and she even said she would hire me, if she knew she was gonna keep me.  Look at it this way, a manager is going to want to hire you thinking that they have somebody who will stay. They don't want to put the amount of time, energy, and money required into training you, only to have you leave not long after.  If you do want/need the job, go with B, and stick with B.  Not to say that you can't ever move to A, but at least have the intentions to stick it out, obviously, if things happen that make working at B unmanageable, then you can try to transfer, but don't try to get on just to leave the manager at B high and dry.  All of that being said, I don't know if there is a minimum time period at one store before you can transfer, or anything like that."

Unless you have a weird dynamic with those managers, a transfer should be easy, but you have to work at a location six months before you can transfer."

We have customers that come in and do that, they will order an iced doppio and then fill the cup with the half and half we have out on the bar and refuse to pay for an iced late. It pisses me off and I do consider it stealing, no matter who does it.  But the food is different. If it is going to be thrown out anyway I have no concerns over eating it or letting another partner take it home. It doesn't matter from an inventory or revenue perspective since you can't sell the expired food anymore."

I'm an opener now, but since over had the experience of working mid and close, I try to be a bit more understanding about closes. As long as I can come in and open the store, I'm happy.

Other than that you just stand around and ring people up, while being fully staffed. I'll give you that it can be busy, but again, you always have double the coverage than closers.   As a closer, imagine having to do all the stocking, cleaning, counts, pastry case, cash handling, all with usually only 2 people. There's a huge disparity between the duties and labor you have available.     But regardless, we're all on the same team. There's no reason to do the morning vs night shift thing. We should be helping each other out and if things aren't perfect, try to be a little understanding."
starbucks,3e0g22,DViddy,19,Tue Jul 21 12:00:50 2015 UTC,"As realistic as possible, at the very least, all SSs should be required to work several of each day part, even if they end up settled into one day part eventually. I used to open five days a week, for five months, but because I'd closed and been the mid several times before that, I knew what to expect, and what could and should be done. I always tell my baristas when they start complaining in the morning about something a closer didn't do that maybe they should try closing a few times on a busy night and see what they get done before they complain.

starbucks,3e0g22,Svegnar,2,Tue Jul 21 09:23:35 2015 UTC,Exactly! We're all on the same team; don't be an asshole and high-five your fellow barista.
starbucks,3e0g22,eastcoastbarista,13,Tue Jul 21 05:12:41 2015 UTC,"I was trained as an opener and a couple of times I would get annoyed about closing tasks not being done, because I thought ""how hard could it be? Just STOCK THINGS PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD."" And now I've transferred from a cafe mall store to a drive thru standalone and am only closing. It is the hardest thing I've ever done. We are completely understaffed for closing. There's 8 people working in the morning taking care of everything. But at night we're lucky to have 4 or 5 (and they start leaving 2 hrs before we actually close so there's only ever two of us left when we are completely closed). And we have to do more than one job, DT works alone and often helps on bar. Shift is usually only doing tills. And cashiers and people on bar are doing those jobs and also making sure drains are done, sweeping and mopping, taking apart the mastrenas, washing dishes, cleaning the syrup holders, taking apart and cleaning blenders, taking out garbages, all while also dealing with the occasional rush. It's terrible and if I ever become an opener again I will NEVER EVER EVER take closers for granted again. Thank you for everything you guys do."
starbucks,3e0g22,JellyBean1023,3,Tue Jul 21 03:45:14 2015 UTC,"It's generally just me and the supervisor when our precloser goes home an hour before the doors are locked. Since my supervisor had sandwiches, the pull and money stuff to do, I'm ringing for front and DT while barring for myself and trying to make the store ready to close as much as I can so we can leave on time. All of this for the last hour of my 8.5 hour shift is exhausting"

Consistently closed near the whole damn store before the night handover when I typically walk in to a bomb site every night.  Turns out I've been busting my ass so the openers can do coffee tastings.

I think openers believe that we don't have customers at night and we are basically Starbucks janitors. However, they don't see that we have to serve customers pretty steadily (not to mention, my store serves 90% frappuccinos after 1 PM)  and have to clean/stock every part of the store with three partners scheduled if we are lucky. I don't know if it is because it's 4 AM that makes the openers so grumpy, but I wish there was some appreciation for what the closers do at my store."

starbucks,3e0g22,tbucket94,5,Tue Jul 21 01:56:40 2015 UTC,"Tl;dr: Never.   Sorry to rant, but My store manager is shit. She never pushes any of the shift supervisors during the morning/day time to do shit. So I come in for my shift (typically 430-1030) and the mid shift leaves like ""oops. Sorry didn't get much done. Lol bye""  So our little closing group of 3 have to bust our asses to get literally everything done. All dishes, prep, stocking, bars, floors, bathrooms, etc. And if we have the excuse that we ran out of time, we all get in trouble. But no one during the day gets in trouble.   I also have a 2nd job that's 1 block away from my store and sometimes I come in on my breaks with my coworkers from my other job and baristas will be standing around doing nothing and I'm like ""wtf guys? You could be cleaning something, doing prep, breaking down a bar, something, anything""  And during the night time, I'm typically on DT which means I make my own drinks and usually ring up front too while the other barista closer works on mopping lobby and locking up patio and washing dishes and such. All after working a full shift at my other job and being up since 6am. But the openers/mids complain about having to do literally anything.  But no. Every fucking day we come in to the same shit and I'm honestly at the end of my rope.  //rant"
starbucks,3e0g22,Weeksozpanda509,2,Tue Jul 21 07:01:06 2015 UTC,"I feel your pain buddy! I also have a second permanent job, Starbucks was just a part time gig I started a few months ago. My store has an SM that gives little to no fucks about her job, we're constantly out of the most basic items in our inventory, and we get left with NO help given from the morning staff. And I've worked in the am on weekends so I know what they do. The SS in the am busts her ass even staying late upwards of 2 hours I saw once and still it's not enough. Sunday's are the absolute most horrible day to close at our store and the am folks just come in do their stuff and leave the store a disaster area! So you're not alone my friend!"
starbucks,3e0g22,hawkm,5,Tue Jul 21 12:27:33 2015 UTC,"It's funny, because my two closers and I were just discussing this.  If you don't do mornings tasks, you're instantly a shit worker. If you forget something once, you're a horrible person and your close sucked.   The fact is that many openers don't appreciate the night people and it's fine. But once you tell me that I didn't do one of your tasks and you have an issue with it, don't ever think I'll do that shit for you again, because it's not worth the ""stern talking to"" I'll get from your lazy ass!"
starbucks,3e0g22,psychowidow,5,Tue Jul 21 07:56:18 2015 UTC,"Preach, fellow closer. I worked a mid a few days back and all of the remaining openers would do absolutely nothing. Once peak ends, they all clock out mentally. At least at my store.   It's all cyclical - your openers don't do anything, the mid tries to catch up, closers can't be expected to do everything. Whateva. I do what I can and clock out. Have fun at peak."

And it's always stupid shit, like forgetting to pull the thaw rack into the front or forgetting to put out iced coffee. In the time it takes them to complain to me about this, they could've had it done. 99% of the time I leave a fantastic close. I've been a precloser/closer/shift closer for the better part of 4 years. I know what I'm doing. Some times it gets busy and we don't leave a perfect close but I always let them know so cut me some slack! Meanwhile I was the closing shift the other day and I started at 4:30PM, 3 SS's had already been in but no one did the AM pastry pull...third time that week it happened!"
starbucks,3e0g22,jawapride,6,Tue Jul 21 04:27:34 2015 UTC,It's very unfortunate. The most powerful tool you have is the duty roster. Closing tasks have cleaning as first priority. Stocking and prepping is secondary to cleaning. But you should still have time for all of it. All the opening tasks are centered around making sure everything is stocked in case the closers missed anything.   At the end of the day a turnover should just be a turnover regardless of it going from open to mid to closing to open.
starbucks,3e0g22,YellowMelon,3,Tue Jul 21 00:57:11 2015 UTC,"This.  I don't usually restock cold brew at night once it's sold out and usually the mid day shift is supposed to make the cold brew.  Woke up one day to an angry call asking if I used up the cold brew the night before. When I came into work, they found out one of the openers didn't know how to brew cold brew.  They asked the mid day shift how to do it, they didn't instruct clearly.  facepalm"

Sorry that we clean up ever speck of filth from your shift and set you up for the most success possible, and yet we hear nothing but negativity. Honestly it's one of the main reasons I'm probably going to quit soon. I say thank you as often as I can but it seems like no one gets the hint."

I look at it as paying your dues, because closers will always be stronger shifts, in terms of time management, delegation and tasks. If it weren't for closing a lot, I wouldn't be able to make sure that every shift hand off at 1pm has an empty sink of dishes, trashes empty, breaks caught up, pourovers prepped and a mid day pull done. It's the least I can do to make the close easier."

I kid you not, I was so excited for one of my closes last week because everything went great and was so clean and I even got QASA stuff time. We got out like ten minutes early and I was like ""ooooh yeah. Morning crew is going to be so happy.""   I came in the next day and the only thing my store manager had said about my close the night before was that ""whoever was doing dishes needs to put the iced coffee and tea lids in the right container from now on! And make sure they aren't put up there messy.""  We literally have too many tea lids to fit in the containers. SORRY FOR RUINING YOUR MORNING!"

When we show up in the morning for openings and the bar is still filthy, the floors weren't mopped, and all the garbage from the closing partners meal breaks is still downstairs, it's hella frustrating. Yes I realize we can do this ourselves BUT it's also not the morning peoples jobs to clean up after the closers. But maybe my store just has bad closers."
starbucks,3e0g22,BearHoldingAshark,2,Tue Jul 21 12:02:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah it sounds like you have some bad closers, all of that stuff that you described, we (closers at my store) are the ones who do that because openers are lazy, pampered, whiny little bitches about every single little detail.   E.g. we put out and prep tea/iced coffee for the openers, we always put out four bags of iced coffee (busy store) but just recently we learned that they actually need five and damn near every day would complain and bash the closers for this (among other things) just because they were too lazy to walk 10ft to go grab another bag.   The lack of communication between the two shifts as well as the contempt they have for one another is really astounding, and I am noticing (but am not surprised) that it is actually a common theme among other stores."
starbucks,3e0g22,Idontknowflycasual,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:15:49 2015 UTC,"The closers at my store also show up for their shifts and nitpick every little thing that is wrong with the store when they show up. Like, if there is a grain of sugar on the condiment stand or a drop of milk on the bar they squawk about it. All the things that closers talk about in this sub about the openers being lazy, entitled, etc...the opposite is true where I work. I'm beginning to think my store is in the twilight zone."

Because they were easy as fuck at my store.  Get Ice from BOH, stock pastry, start brewing coffee.  That's basically all things we had to think about, everything else was always done. That took us like 10 minutes, so we had 20 minutes of doing nothing before opening which always included some coffee and a cigarette to get your eyes to open after being up so fuckng early.  (We opened at 3.30 AM, Airport Sbux).  Now when I look back I wish I would've appreciated the closers more.  Usually I just told them to not stress at night, if I was the one opening the day after they could skip some of the things, I could do it in the morning and I offered them to not clean the floors bc I could do that bla bla and they always did all those things anyways.  I had the best closers, props to them.  The only shitty thing about opening is to get up at 1 in the morning, but it's still kinda cozy to be at an airport all alone that time :)"

Peak is busy, but nothing ridiculous, and we don't get busy until about 9:00. You'd think the opener would have plenty of time to make some whips or mocha, right?

Night and day crew never get along at any store. Both jobs are hard, just in different ways. Nights are a ton of cleaning and running around, just trying to fit in as much as possible before you lock the doors. Days, though, require you to wake up at 3am and still be perky, bright-eyed, and ready to run around saying ""Yes, sir...right away, sir"" for 8 hours. I can't speak for other stores, but day crew does a ton of cleaning and stocking and weekly cleaning tasks, but we're never acknowledged for it because they often get done at 5ish before the rush starts, so night crew doesn't see the work we've done.   I've watched so many baristas (day and night) clean an area, just to destroy it again through carelessness. Then they say they never have time to clean. Why don't they ""clean-as-you-go"" and try a little harder to not make a mess in the first place? Like letting ice cubes fall over the counter and not wiping them up, resulting in a huge puddle. Or opening messy pastries haphazardly so all of the crumbs fall everywhere instead of carefully so they stay mostly in the bag. Again, I've been on both sides of it, so this opinion is coming straight from experience."

Shoot, who has a pro bono lawyer boyfriend/girlfriend/mom/dad/anyone that we can borrow for a consultation?! :P  Edit::  Starbucks also cares a TON about their image, if it were to be released that this user does not actually have contact with a corporate representative who has approved this, it won't look good for Starbucks or the user.

If they are hot and have a great personality I love it but if they are gross, fugly and awkward, suddenly I hate it.  Since you have a rapport with the other baristas too, ask one of them to make sure the manager is single and of compatible sexual orientation, and you can also ask their opinion on what your chances are.  Just be careful because when I was a barista, I was super-friendly to everyone in the same way, whether I thought they were hot or disgusting (down to the same jokes and phrases, I was like an automaton!) Gaging the romantic interest of someone who is paid to be nice to you can be tough because some of us change our voice, tone, energy-level, facial expression and body language completely and get into the role with everything we've got. Like a clown putting his mask on. Even if you think we like you, we might think you're an idiot who orders dumb things and holds up the line, but you would never know.  Anyway, good luck, just be super-careful. Imagine how you would feel if someone did whatever you plan on doing, to you at your job."

starbucks,3dz71e,iwrestledasharkonce,-6,Mon Jul 20 21:44:18 2015 UTC,"Watching someone eat at the bar might not be the ideal brainwashed worker that Starbucks wants but it won't have any effect of customers (as long as the store is at a lull.) Your slippery slope arguments don't buttress any truth. Technically if a barista ate a sandwich at the bar, an alien could fly down and invade the store just to try some yummy Dijon. But is that necessarily going to happen? Bad logic is bad logic."
starbucks,3dz71e,goodadvice2,0,Tue Jul 21 01:29:52 2015 UTC,"Believe it or not, passing on a disease or triggering an allergy/intolerance is INCREDIBLY easy. Some of the stuff we do may seem like overkill, but it's just layers upon layers of protection against contaminants and allergens.   Ever culture bacteria? One microbiology lab in college, we were instructed to not wash our hands and press our thumbs into agar (nutrient rich jelly stuff). A werk later, there were fungal communities and bacterial colonies galore. We heated a plain metal loop to glowing orange, gave it juuuuuust enough time to cool, and swiped it against our phones. Again, colonies everywhere. (PLEASE tell me you don't use your phone behind the counter.)   You should not serve a person with celiac disease a flourless chocolate chip cookie. It might be gluten free but it's been partying with the wheat stuff. A speck of wheat can have dire consequences for someone with severe celiac disease.   Same with milk or soy. Someone who is allergic to dairy or soy can get very sick from just a few drops. So don't munch on edamame hummus or cheese or you run higher risk of contaminating someone's food or drink.   So no, this isn't a crazy slippery slope. I have a degree in biology, I've studied and witnessed the spread of disease and the mechanisms of allergies and intolerances. Pathogenic bacteria and viruses have evolved over millions of years to spread easily. (How else would they survive?) Allergies are serious fucking business.   Don't eat behind the counter. It's not about the company wanting you to be a perfect little robot. It's about keeping our food and drinks as contaminant free and allergy friendly as possible.   I hope I never go to your Starbucks. Eww."
starbucks,3dz71e,iwrestledasharkonce,-2,Tue Jul 21 02:52:57 2015 UTC,"I'm familiar with rudimentary, menial microbiology labs. If washed my hands and then immediately pressed my thumb into agar gel a menagerie of bacteria would grow. There is bacteria everywhere, however they're not necessarily harmful. We have immune systems for a reason. Otherwise, there is always living in a bubble.   And I think that anyone eating a harmless snack behind the counter would wash their hands after eating something that left a residue on their hands. Otherwise the 0.01% of people who are hyper-allergic dying from a barista poisoning them because of the munchies is a sick fantasy.

starbucks,3dz71e,Treeofwoe,3,Mon Jul 20 20:01:07 2015 UTC,"A lot of this depends on how a person views authority.  Take one of my fellow supervisors, for instance. He's a guy with a deep respect for authority. It makes him suck up to our manager, and when he's on shift, he expects to be treated as infallible. He is the only person he credits with anything. A stereotypical ""Boss.""  The baristas hate him. Management loves him.  Then take me. I've always had a healthy disregard for authority. I'll question our manager when he makes dodgy decisions, defend our baristas to him and defend him to our baristas. I also don't expect anyone to do anything I ask because I say so. I want them to understand why things need to be done. I want them to make smart independent decisions and have the confidence to follow through with them.  Many of the baristas have told me they love working with me. Management... they're less enthused. I need to produce double the results for half the credit. But such is life."
starbucks,3dz71e,NanoNarse,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:28:41 2015 UTC,"I very honestly disagree. I have a deep respect for authority, but I also have a very team-based attitude. My boss is my boss, and she does all of the things that are in the OP infographic. At the same time, she does everything on time, notices when cleaning tasks aren't done, works over 70 hours a week, and brings attention to easier ways to do things and neglected tasks. She's honestly the most on-top-of-it manager I've ever had.  That said, her customer service and general interpersonal contact is terrible. I love my boss as my boss, and she does everything a boss should. I think that managers are fine being overly harsh. It not only unites us as a team, but as a shift, I feel that it has given me a lot of political experience. I am more united with my baristas, and I get to be a leader because of it. Not only does she do her job, but she lets me be the ""good guy."" She is the most effective manager in the state, and even though she is abrasive and stressful, I love working for her. I've worked other food service jobs in the past, and many other managers are lazy and make shifts do their job, or don't take an interest in coaching their employees, or simply do no work.   Most of the baristas (and shifts) are scared of her. But when she makes a genuine mistake, it's reported to one of the two shifts that can talk to her honestly. You make it work, or you change locations. It's sad that ambitious but talentless people can make it into management positions, though, and that is definitely something that needs to be fixed."

I really think that the ""boss"" intrinsically has to be the bad guy to promote working harder. They have a whole bunch of numbers to meet that we just can't even imagine (stupid ratios of customers/buying food or coffee, labor that is impossible to staff with, etc.). At the same time, I feel that it's their responsibility to hire charismatic, leader-type shifts that they trust to get the job done. If they only promote toadies, things won't go well. It's interesting to see where things go wrong; it's not always ""the boss,"" but sometimes their boss, or the fact that they're promoting people that don't complement them, or nobody with the right personality is applying, etc."

Don't be overwhelmed by the information. There is more to know, yes, but a lot of it makes a lot of sense when you see it in action. The DCR will become your best friendsie evvvvvaaaar. I check that thing easily every hour. Get familiar with the layout and what all the numbers mean. Breathe. Relax. The 'mood' of the shift greatly depends on your own mood that day.

starbucks,3e0t0r,alysurr,2,Tue Jul 21 15:35:42 2015 UTC,"Aces in their places. This is something my manager swears by. There are some people who just aren't great at bar, or who are too reserved for being great at register, or are too easily distracted/not able to prioritize enough for customer support.  As a shift, you should only ever be customer support or order support (taking care of the store or supporting reg/bar). This is only for Playbook, but it definitely works well if you have enough people. This way you can take care of brewing and the condiment bar, take care of emergencies, stock things, and then count in/out, close tills, pull breakfast or pastries, inventory, temps, do cold brew, make sure you're on top of breaks, etc.  Prioritize properly. That's what's made me the star shift, even as the newest one.  In Order Of Priority:   Breaks on time (or, changing scheduled breaks to a more efficient, but still reasonable time). Prioritize your shift stuff. I have a couple shifts who prioritize order support, even when there's only two or three customers. Let your baristas do their jobs. If you're not getting killed, get the stuff you need to get done. A barista can take an order and make a drink, but they can't do the deposit, or make a drop, or place an order, or do a pull. You'll need to find the correct timeframe and stick to it as much as business allows. Before their break, have each barista do a daily task. They'll make it happen as fast as they can, because they want their break. Take a look before they go, though. One redo, and they'll never skimp again. Don't be afraid to coach. Ringing, barring, customer/store support, customer service, etc. It's your job to be observant of what your baristas are doing, and if it's not correct, to coach them. My focus is on customer service, then beverage quality. There's more than enough literature on beverage quality, but customer service is an art. Make sure to move people around at least every 2 hours. People get seriously burned out on bar or register (less so on customer support), so people need to be moved around. Keep in mind the Aces in Their Places motto. When it's less busy, put people on something that they're less strong in to give them a break. When it gets busy again, move them so that the strongest people are where they should be. Alternately, try not to move people TOO often. 30 minutes is often too short a time to really ""get in the groove,"" so keep in mind how your partners work. I've made a list of stuff to stock when it's not busy. I try to get my shift stuff out of the way as soon as possible, then get breaks out of the way while I'm on the floor, then have my baristas on reg/bar/support while I stock things, do trash runs, and do dishes. I have this on a list I keep in my cubby, and do as much as I can, especially when I close.   Stuff to Stock:   Coffee (cubes, hoppers, retail wall, 5-lb bags underneath) Cups and Lids Underneath the Condiment Bar (sugars and sugar substitutes, trash, straws, napkins, toilet paper, utensils, bathroom cleaning materials) Bathrooms (toilet paper, seat covers, soap) Fridges (milks, nondairy milks, refreshers, apple juice, smoothie juice, carafes, whipped creams) Iced coffee and iced tea backups (if necessary) Inclusions (freeze-dried blackberries, strawberries, limes; protein; chips; vanilla bean; matcha; bananas/greek yogurt) Pastry/Sandwich bags, teas, oatmeal and toppings Ice Pastry case (if applicable) and RTD&E case. Also RTD&E backups, if non-refrigerated items have a place near the case itself."

I opened the window and cheerily greeted her- She had no response other than to hold her debit out to me silently without even looking at me. I passed her the machine, she wiped her nose with her fingers, and smeared the snot on the debit machine. She snatched the drink without acknowledging me at all and started to leave.

Focus on making quality beverages for customers first, address spills after. It'll take her time to become familiar with the process and routine that is churning out drinks, so be patient with her and tell her to be patient with herself. Speed and efficiency will come naturally once she's familiar and more comfortable with the process."

starbucks,3e1piz,ViolentBarbie,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:32:45 2015 UTC,"I'm a fan of throwing them on bar alone during a rush. Trial by fire or some other such euphemism. If they really need help, I will step in and help them, but usually I just let them be. It really seems to drive home the point that they already know how to make the drinks, they are just overthinking everything and need to learn to let that go. They will make mistakes, and they need to learn to accept that"
starbucks,3e1piz,BobHogan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:20:28 2015 UTC,"Keep having her practice when it's slow, but also try just talking to her, both when she's actively training on bar and away from it.  Asking her what she feels good/timid about is important, since it may not be what it seems from your perspective (eg, maybe it's less that she's timid than that she's really internalized working clean and is trying to get faster without ever making a mess) It also lets you both focus on where she's strong and think about ways to let that support her learning in other areas.  And being available in the moment is important, since if you're shadowing/supporting her on bar, it's easier to catch that maybe she's slower because she's counting out the measures for each drink's recipe (Okay, Grande SKVL, how many pumps is that? Wait! need to queue the shots...) or she just needs someone to quietly be there in case she has a question. I know I had some trainees who moved faster just having someone they felt comfortable with supporting them, because they were scared of going too fast and then interrupting the register partner with a clarifying question."

There has to be a 10 hour gap between shifts and when there isn't we get overtime.  A few years ago I read that Starbucks got rid of clopening. Hopefully you don't have to settle for that kind of treatment.   To clarify we get overtime for the time worked until 10 hours. In other words if the gap between shifts is only 8 hours we get 2 hours of overtime.

starbucks,3e0acl,TheFulcrum,9,Tue Jul 21 04:57:18 2015 UTC,"Depending on where you are, only 7 hours between shifts is a problem. In my neck of the woods, it's illegal.   The way I understand it, the scheduling software will put a red flag on clopens during the week, but not from week-to-week (i.e. a clopen from Sunday night to Monday morning). SM's have to specifically seek out these clopens. In any event, they have a worksheet they can use to design a schedule.  Smells like your SM's strength is not her scheduling if she ""forgets"" that partners need sleep and have lives o_O   It seems that PCC is already on the case with this, so yeah. See what the specialist says, and in the meantime, trading shifts is the fix I can see."
starbucks,3e0acl,SharkyTendencies,2,Tue Jul 21 00:25:18 2015 UTC,Clopening isn't inherently illegal. You just need an 8 hour gap (in California). Other states are different. I clopen my store all the time because we close at 6pm.

I always just listened to heresay from other co workers say you need an eight hour gap.   Here is the closest law to that.   ""(10) Provided further that no employee shall be required to work more than 16 hours in a 24-hour period unless by voluntary mutual agreement of the employee and the employer, and no employee shall work more than 24 consecutive hours until said employee receives not less than eight (8) consecutive hours off duty immediately following the 24 consecutive hours of work.""

The ice serves to dilute the coffee, not to make it cold.   Then stores have the option of storing it at room temperature for four hours, or in the fridge for eight hours. Adding ice to the cup is what makes the coffee cold.   IMO keeping at room temp is optimal for flavor, but it isn't wrong for stores to keep it in the fridge."

starbucks,3dz1a9,LassoLTD,4,Mon Jul 20 22:55:05 2015 UTC,"Iced coffee is always brewed fresh and put over ice. If it's in the fridge, it could've just been made or a few hours old. Do you add cream and sugar? It could just be less or more cream that could be throwing off the flavour..."
starbucks,3dz1a9,ynkeefan,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:12:45 2015 UTC,"My usual order is a trenta vanilla iced coffee, no milk."
starbucks,3dz1a9,adamrobertt,5,Mon Jul 20 18:29:05 2015 UTC,"Some baristas might be adding Classic and Vanilla syrups, making it almost twice as sweet.  Some older, higher volume stores have an iced coffee dispenser(think fast food tea/coffee) that I think is kind of gross, since you can'y guarantee the freshness of the coffee."
starbucks,3dz1a9,LassoLTD,5,Mon Jul 20 19:46:28 2015 UTC,When you work in a high volume store and you go through a case (all 27 bags) a day you can guarantee the freshness.
starbucks,3dz1a9,adamrobertt,5,Mon Jul 20 21:17:40 2015 UTC,Yep. I worked in a somewhat higher than normal volume store and we used a big steel Curtis dispenser. It held 8 batches of iced coffee. We filled it 3 or 4 times a day during the summer. The coffee isn't old - the big container was because we went through it quickly. Any leftovers got dumped at the end of the night.
starbucks,3dz1a9,lonelycupcake,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:10:21 2015 UTC,"But iced coffee is only good for 8 hours after being brewed refrigerated, and only a few hours at room temp.  So when you only empty it once a day, you have been serving a mix of expired coffee for the majority of the day.  That's why they(the large containers) are being phased out.  edit: clarification"
starbucks,3dz1a9,alysurr,5,Tue Jul 21 00:12:50 2015 UTC,But not if you wait for it to be empty to refill it... Not too complicated.

starbucks,3dz1a9,annapie,2,Mon Jul 20 20:49:13 2015 UTC,I feel like I never noticed my baristas using anything but fresh brew until cold brew was introduced. Can you tell me if it has always been this way or if this is a recent change?

They couldn't just get in the car and visit another location? Nope, they instead chose to be angry at you and had no sympathy for you as you tried to open up a store by yourself. People man.   My store closes at 9 PM, and people always complain that we close so early. I always tell them that there are three other Starbucks within 10 minutes of my store that close at 12 AM.

I was opening at the fashion show mall on the strip in Vegas for black Friday and I had about 6 other baristas opening with me. We had an electrical gate that would open from the bottom and every time I opened it to let an employee in (before opening) I had to yell at a hoarde of about 40 people not to come running in. It was seriously some dawn of the dead shit.

You'll be assigned to a Barista Trainer who'll show you the ropes. However, some managers kinda suck at assigning time to train, so you may have more of a ""trial by fire"" experience, which is more traditional.  My advice for training is to ask lots and lots of questions and take some notes. They'll tell you not to take notes. Take some notes on your own, but use the resources they give you too. Don't freak about about it - it's not bad once you know what you're doing. It's just a steep-ish learning curve.  Good luck, and welcome!"

starbucks,3e06rk,meowqueen,3,Tue Jul 21 00:11:32 2015 UTC,"Absolutely not. Background checks are fast and cheap -- this is 2015. There's no reason to lie about questions on a job interview that might threaten your position.  It was simply discouraging being interviewed by such fresh blood, who came off like felons are the last thing she'd have in her store. Certainly didn't make me feel happy at the end.   I read through hundreds of different online posts regarding Starbucks' hiring policy in the time from my first call to my first interview. I've also gone over guidelines, hour requirements for health benefits, stock options, mixed info about 401k, differences between freestanding stores and those inside a grocery store. The interwebz seems such a mixed bag of possible answers."

starbucks,3e06rk,whiskeytobacco,3,Tue Jul 21 00:34:20 2015 UTC,"Theft by deception roughly 10-12 years ago. Served probation, completed with early termination (I was a good boy). I was still a teenager at the time and just moved out of my parents' house. Made mistakes, rolled with the wrong people, will probably pay for it till I die or stumble upon a large sum of money to have my record sealed or whatever."

Unfortunately, I cannot sustain advertising costs to continue to run my own business -- this is only the 2nd hourly position I've ever applied for in my entire life, and the first that was a large corporation.  I've been a business owner since I was emancipated at 13. Rode the highs and lows of the dot-com, own everything I have paid in full. I don't need much to survive on, but making $2,500 one month and $250 the next isn't cutting it now. She keeps saying I'll secure more recurring contracts with SMBs and SMEs, but I hate the unpredictability since the market went south some years back (I'm an IT person since Windows 98/Red Hat 5.1).  To my dear mother, I should be making $100/hour and running a team of 30+ programmers creating the next big SaaS. I'd be happy making a guaranteed $150/week after taxes doing anything but sexual favors. She's from a different time when they barely checked anything, before computers and the net.

If you checked ""no"" and it comes back that you are a felon, you won't get it.  My interview was pretty short and brief.

starbucks,3dw8fk,rhino_bunny,9,Mon Jul 20 03:19:12 2015 UTC,"No, but the stores themselves have widely variable standards and many of the standards are set by the franchises that they're located within.    Company owned stores are usually held to a higher standard and must adhere to all of Starbucks' standards.  Licensed stores can pretty much do whatever they want.  Honestly I don't understand why Starbucks allows this as it sort of dilutes the brand a bit, but I suppose they've decided that it's worth it for the extra exposure and revenue."

They've never heard of the lady before. She only comes in every three to five months and only stresses on us displaying at least fifteen different pastries, four to five of each- despite us only selling 1-10 pastries a day. I wish we had someone more involved, but that's not the case. We as barista's just can't contact our district manager. Our manager of the Starbucks kiosk isn't too fond of our district manager for some reason.   There are a lot of Starbucks licensed stores that have their shit together. The Target right across the street from us has a Tarbucks. We have one of their former employees as a barista at our location. She says our location is totally different than her old store. The management at Target wouldn't let this stuff happen at their location.  Their district manager is also different from my district manager, so that's a bit weird considering we're both licensed locations within 0.2 miles of each other."

So this lady, really short, maybe weighs 90-100lbs tries to use the locked door. Enters the other door and shouts ""WHY IS THE DOOR LOCKED!!?!"". My SM calmly tells her for security reasons. Lady runs to the bathroom. Our ""ladies bathroom"" has more than one stall so customers never lock the door even though you can technically do so. So she goes in, locked the door, and my SM tells her to unlock it. I'm not exactly sure what they said to each other but the lady was screaming at my SM and my SM then threatened to call the police if she didn't unlock the door. Lady continued to swear and yell, got hostile. Lady kept yelling over and over asking for the Store manager, DM, full names of all the employees and phone numbers.

starbucks,3dw6rr,kakasensei,14,Mon Jul 20 02:03:46 2015 UTC,"I have a huge problem with people saying ""oh gas station coffee is just as good and it's cheaper!"" Or something similar about McDonald's.   1) when we talk about simply black coffee, they're all fairly similar. Is Starbucks drip coffee higher quality? From what I know yes, but since we serve that shitty bean called Pike all day long people don't know just how good our black coffee can be, so other more convienient places seem to have a better deal on similar shit.   2) Do I think our prices are expensive? Hell yeah. But there's reasons. We make everything by hand. We make sure the coffee we're using is fresh, ground properly, and attended to at least every 30 minutes. Now if by this point you still like McDonald's coffee, fine, we all have opinions. But know that the prices come from all the effort that goes into your cup.   3) You can't get specialty drinks at gas stations and McDonald's. I spend a decent amount of time around money conscious older people, and whenever I go to Starbucks and get a flat white or something they never fail to say something like ""I don't understand why you would pay that much for a cup of coffee."" Well it's not just a cup of regular joe, it's a handcrafted beverage where whole milk is poured over ristretto style shots. Paying 5 dollars for a specialty beverage isnt a big deal. Now I know gas stations have ""cappuccinos"" (cringe) and McDonald's has lattes and frappes, but let's just not talk about these monstrosities of drinks. Gross.   In conclusion to this mini rant, Starbucks has some good ass shit and the prices are high for reasons."

The specialty coffee business is still up for grabs, although Starbucks has most definitely opened the market up considerably, and profited.   In fact, it may be that you must be a powerhouse pre-launch to take on Starbucks' brand.  Also, it's the morning for most buying this beverage and they are sober. Honestly, mixed drinks at many other places are comparable...."

Usually we catch them before they go back there and inform them that the bathrooms are on the other side of the store. There was one time when I was in the back doing dishes and I looked up to find a customer just roaming around looking for the bathrooms and didn't even bother to ask me if she was in the right place. That was a little infuriating.

starbucks,3dwiml,godlesscitizen,3,Mon Jul 20 04:28:46 2015 UTC,Is that accounting for one of my drawers being off too?
starbucks,3dwiml,godlesscitizen,2,Mon Jul 20 04:38:40 2015 UTC,"So if one of the drawers is off, then the deposit will be off.   I don't know how you switched the bags, but most of it will be easy to look at and say...  ""Drawer 1 was supposed to have 56.81, but it has 20.21. Drawer 2 was supposed to have 20.21, but it has 56.81. Drawer 1 and Drawer 2 were probably just switched.""  It should be pretty easy to sort out which drawers were switched.

She then got transferred back to her hometown a few hours away.  You know what I liked? This chick was silly about her job, and in a way, it was like having an extra barista on my team. It was really endearing. Like, we did the freaking cinnamon challenge one day just for kicks. She had a penchant for parading around wearing a garbage bag and waving a straw around like a wizard.   One time, she had a set-up to do and was having difficulty opening the huge box without the contents spilling all over. The team tried to help, but she refused, so we just stood around and laughed at her hahaha. It sounds cruel, but it was really funny in the moment when she realized she needed our help.   And the one thing I'll take away from her, is this little sentence that she told me when I was having a rough day: ""Nothing is more important to me than my partners.""

starbucks,3dwfgg,yamakacoffee,9,Mon Jul 20 02:31:41 2015 UTC,"You can do it! I worked 20+ hours at SBux, then worked another 8+ at the university I was going to, then had a full course load. Of course, make sure you are sleeping when you can, eating and drinking properly, and taking care of your needs. If you feel yourself cracking, see the school counsellor (like, the psychologist on campus) once bi-weekly AND ask for your manager for help when it comes to scheduling (only working short shifts, limiting shifts to mornings/nights, etc)."
starbucks,3dwfgg,velogirl,5,Mon Jul 20 02:43:29 2015 UTC,"It's doable. Depends on your courses, your schedule, and yourself. I work two jobs (50 hours total) and 12 units.   If I know I'm taking a tough class, I balance it out with easy-A classes. I go into the semester knowing I want 12 units, but sign up for 18. Then drop the two classes I know won't work out after the first week.   After I know my schedule, I go into the request binder and make sure I request exam days/midterm studying days off if need to. My manager is amazing and will work with me. If you don't have one of those, put reminders on your phone/planner/calendar to remind you. It sucks when you can't request a day off to study when everyone beats you to it.   The rest is what everyone else will say: be organized, stay on top of things, etc. I heard a saying once:    There's school, family/friends, work, and fun. You can only choose three    While I don't completely agree, it's true to a certain extent. I don't go out much, I make sure I have fun at work and get along with my coworkers. Good luck.

Time management is key! Try to keep yourself on a schedule (which is difficult if your shifts change every week, I know). Know what you're capable of and when you need to take a step back and breathe. Do not overwhelm yourself. Bring your homework to work and do it on your break (I haven't had to do this at Starbucks, but I did this at a job I had last year - I did a lot of statistics problems in the back kitchen).

starbucks,3dwfgg,sssssteph,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:37:16 2015 UTC,"It's definitely doable! I worked as a receptionist at a spa before working at Starbucks and Starbucks is WAY more easier. I'm a full-time student and working part-time. It will get hard, you just have to learn how to balance it all and how to say no. If you have an exam coming up and someone asks you to pick up a shift, prioritize. Yes, having a big paycheck is nice but getting a diploma is even better - in my opinion at least. You're working with a big group of people so if you ever need to ask for a day off or switch shifts last minute, then you can.  The best thing for you to do is schedule work around school, not the other way around. Also, if you're professor gives you a syllabus with exam dates then try to schedule yourself off maybe the day before the test or limit or availability that week just to give yourself more time.   I've noticed that being a student and working at Starbucks is extremely easier than working a front desk position, especially if you're a barista and not a shift. Even though working here is extremely exhausting, mentally and physically, you just have to find that balance. If it's your first time working and going to school then limit your availability to maybe 3 or so  days a week just to get a feel for how it's going and slowly increase your hours. For example, Fall I'm planning on taking TuTh classes from around 2pm-7pm so I can work mornings those days for a few hours then head straight to school and make myself unavailable MW so I can study and have some time to relax and then work the other days. It's definitely just about having that balance and keeping school your main focus."
starbucks,3dwfgg,hells_flower,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:51:00 2015 UTC,"It's possible. I got my bachelor's while working at the bux. Just tell your manager your school schedule and be realistic on how many hours you can work. I was over-enthusiastic when I first started working and was working 40 hr/week while taking 15 credit hours a semester. It fell apart after the third semester doing it. I aimed for no more than 32 hours a week after that, but I wished I had done perhaps only 24. It's really up to you. Be realistic and communicate to your SM."
starbucks,3dwfgg,RevoDS,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:52:45 2015 UTC,"It's possible but not easy. I did it all last year and will do it again in the fall.  Tips:  -Keep your availability as open as possible for most of the semester  -Make sure you have a good relationship with your manager; he's the one who's going to choose whether you can have that day off to study or not  -Once you have your work schedule, build yourself a study schedule around it. You need to be organized if you want to make it work.  -If possible, take a lot of days off or even vacation during midterms/finals. Those 2-3 weeks are the most important of the semester, THAT is your priority at this point.   -Don't be afraid to ask for replacements. There will be some weeks where you can do 30 hours, but there will be weeks when you can barely work one shift and need some covered. If you feel a shift is too much, get rid of it.  Good luck!"

It was very difficult, but looking back, I'm glad I didn't give up on school/sbux.  Edit: OH! And make sure to ask off for finals week or even a week before. This is critical."

We have a massive shelf of them and we typically end up needing to wash a bunch by the middle of the day because they are all dirty. Not that we're even a super busy store, but we are a store that is known for having a nice sitting atmosphere and a large cafe so we get a lot of people staying. Plates are also used a ton. We have a stack of about 40 plates that we also use up and need to wash a few times a day."

Not sure what's going on with this but all of a sudden no one is telling us that very important fact needed for us to complete the order and then when we ask you it's like pulling teeth. Size should be the first thing you tell us, if not first then it needs to be said somewhere in your order.   This. So much this. It's been happening a lot at our store lately too, and then when you ask them they stare at you like a deer in fucking headlights, like you've just asked them the most mind-bending question of all time.   I think so many people get lost in the idea of their ""OH SO COMPLICATED"" drinks that they then forget to add the size in. And then they just look stupid lol   Literally, a ""grande nonfat 7 pump extra hot no water chai tea latte"" isn't so hard, is it? (even if I didn't type it in the right order, don't hurt me, I don't have work for another 2 hours ...) Tell us how complicated you think it is, if it makes you feel special enough, but we can't ring it up completely until you tell us the size.

It's like every other person refuses to tell us the size and then if they have a second drink they just go directly into that order and then we have to interrupt them for the first drink's size.

starbucks,3dynch,cowardlyvigilante,5,Mon Jul 20 16:33:06 2015 UTC,"First off, you don't necessarily have a real complaint. Basically what you sent to the corporate office was that people were speaking about a customer negatively and you didn't like it. There is no cause for a response based off of that. Secondly, did you hear or witness the interaction between the customer and employees? Could you go into specific details? Do you really, objectively, even understand what happened? You are vague in your description of your complaint. Again no real reason to reply from a corporate standpoint.   Thirdly, I must always ask this, have you ever worked in the service industry? If so then shame on you. If not we'll let me explain some things to you.   The average customer reacts instead of thinking if something goes wrong with their order. That could be said with life in general as well. We react rather than taking a step back and trying to calmly try to understand. We want things in a instant. If not we throw a hissy fit or let that annoyance fester inside our sad little souls.  It doesn't always work that way though.   Sometimes things outside of our control can mess up the system. Mistakes can be made. I'm sure you have made mistakes that have fucked things up in some way or another. No one is perfect.   So when it comes to people who work in the service industry we deal with a lot ,maybe even more, minute grievances than quite possibly any other job/profession. Being entrenched in that sort of environment is not the ideal place for anyone to hold their sanity  for very long. Like any way of letting off steam to help us cope with the psychological beat we get on a daily basis we must speak to each other. I know right! Fuck us for being social creatures. I don't know the situation because you are terrible at your description of your said moment in time that slightly upset you to the point that you go onto the fucking Internet to try to find out why you didn't get a response to a insignificant complaint. ( please imagine that in that long sentence with no punctuation I was speaking to you like a child.)    Anyways, were you wearing headphones at the time that you ""heard baristas loudly talking about their personal lives"" or did you not have headphones in your ears? If you didn't you are in fact a uptight, probably complains about people who breathe because you have ""sensitive hearing"", bloody asshole. If you did and you could still hear them talking ignore what I just said. You are kinda right that is unprofessional but they could have loud voices and I still believe you are not pleasant to be around. Who gives a rattlesnake sized, curly-q shit anyways. You know you could've have left and gone to so many other places in your town/city/place of residence. That's the beauty of doing work remotely. You can go where ever. You could've left but chose to stay and get agitated. That's on you.   Regardless, I apologize for this. For being a said reactionary person. But I cannot take the countless small minded miscreants who like to shit on people who have a ""simple"" job to do like pour coffee. There is more to that and their spineless bodies don't know what they are talking about. The daily constant abuse by strangers and people seeing that we are a lower life forms because we just needed a job. Still we hand you your coffee with a smile. A fake and broken down pseudo cheeriness that you don't have the time or want to notice.   Not all baristas/service workers share my views. And I know not all customers are the scum of the earth. But maybe get some perspective. See those employees as people. Analyze your own situation as to why you decided to do what you did. Think as to why it REALLY bothered you. Btw I r drunk.   P.S. Oh and still, go fuck ya self"

Firstly, it's incredibly unprofessional to speak negatively about your customers within earshot of other customers.  Secondly, I could go into specific details. I chose not to on reddit. Oh no!  Thirdly, I absolutely have worked in a service industry. People are assholes. I get that. However I, and my coworkers, have always known better than to bitch about customers in front of other customers. So did our manager.  I don't give a shit if they were talking about their personal lives. But when the whiney ""barista"" stands in front of the register after her shift and all but yells about her personal life to the entire store, I absolutely have right as a patron to be annoyed. Have that conversation quietly or at a normal level. Jesus. It's called volume.  ""Anyways"", I wasn't wearing headphones at all. Didn't even have any with me. Which would have absolutely made that visit better. Call me uptight, but I shouldn't have to listen to anyone yell inside, let alone an employee or the manager. Fuck man, I'm deaf in one ear and the bitch was still loud.  You called it a ""simple"" job, not me. I know, HAVING BEEN IN THE SERVICE INDUSTRY, that you have a zillion tasks to do at any given moment. You're friends with your coworkers and fuck around. That's like the best part of the job. I am not ""shitting"" on people. I am allowed to go somewhere where I give my patronage expecting a level of professionalism from its employees. Golly. What an asshole I am.

She gave some damn identifying information, too. So what happens when she does that and the wife/partner/kid of this ""asshole"" customer is already in store? I think she'll have a lot more than a random complaint from lil 'ol me. And no, I didn't ""threaten"" to not come back... empty threats that affect no one are no fun. I'm not about that life."

starbucks,3dynch,Jalabaster,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:33:36 2015 UTC,"Because your complaint was essentially ""they were talking shit about customers"". You even mentioned that those customers weren't in the store, so what's wrong with that? We're still providing excellent customer service. Anyone in the service industry can tell you its an act. We can fake that shit all day, and if you seriously think that it's genuine, you're either naive or have not been in the industry long enough."

That's so damn unprofessional to bitch about customers in front of other customers. We all do it, but shit... do it quietly. Chit chat about who you're fucking, but quietly. The entire store doesn't need to know that shit.  Ew. I shudder at the thought of this barista naked. Took myself down that hole, now I regret it."
starbucks,3dtt1a,pennywhistle78,4,Sun Jul 19 11:49:43 2015 UTC,If you have a high temperature washer you can't put anything with an adhesive that can melt. Like the plastic things that hold your syrup bottles as well at the ice scoop holder.   The espresso puck tray from the mastrena can be dented and damaged in the washer. The hoppers however are completely safe to put in there contrary to popular belief. The cleanliness manual actually has a picture of the thing in the machine.   I've heard tea pitchers can become cracked from being put in the dishwasher but I've always theorized people were using bleach on them secretly to get rid of stains.
starbucks,3dtt1a,jawapride,2,Sun Jul 19 16:53:35 2015 UTC,"I'd like to know this as well because it seems that almost everything goes in our Hobart. The only thing I was specifically told not to was our plastic syrup holders. Also, our resident Coffee Master told us NONE of the bar parts (except for the shot glasses) go in the Hobart. Everyone knew about the puck tray but as for the metal grate, holder and milk wand cover they got put in.     Other than the puck tray and syrup holders, it seems everything goes in the Hobart. I've also never seen anyone use the three sink method but we also have the LXi Model which uses detergent so perhaps we don't have to. I'm not there 24/7 so this is just as far as I know."
starbucks,3dtt1a,alexeye,2,Sun Jul 19 14:21:04 2015 UTC,It depends of its low temp or not. If you use sanitizer strips to test it instead of verifying the temperature then you've got a low temp and you can put everything in it. Yes everything. It's been confirmed by my bar techs and the Hobart tech because I had the same questions switching over to the new machine.   If it isn't then the lists mentioned are pretty accurate as far as I've been told.
starbucks,3dtt1a,Barc0dedfur,2,Sun Jul 19 15:34:10 2015 UTC,"I was trained that thin plastic and anything with adhesive cannot go in the hobart. Normally my green beans follow that rule, but I've caught some old partners putting caramel bottles in the hobart and I just about lose it because they know better.  edit: obviously things that cannot be submerged or say hand wash only can't go in the hobart."
starbucks,3dtt1a,hells_flower,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:57:19 2015 UTC,"Depends if it's high temp or a low temp chemical based sanitizer. First store had the low temp, so everything but the puck drawer went in. New store has high temp, nothing plastic goes in. Almost everything is 3 sink method."
starbucks,3dtt1a,fueledbyink,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:48:03 2015 UTC,I had been trained that no plastic in there. My manager told me that it costs her less to replace pitchers than the labor it costs to wash them by hand so we put everything in there :/
starbucks,3dtt1a,potterhead360,2,Mon Jul 20 00:58:13 2015 UTC,"Things that can go in the Hobart = whatever you feel like putting in the Hobart.  That's my motto, anyway."
starbucks,3dtt1a,adamrobertt,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:03:48 2015 UTC,"Caramel bottles can warp and the threads no longer fit properly (leads to lids falling into caramel macchiatos and frappuccinos). Syrup risers and cold bar scoop plexis start to fall apart (heat weakens the glue). Mastrena puck trays can warp. Syrup pumps warp (they shouldn't even be washed, but three compartment is better than hobart). That is about all I don't put through."
starbucks,3dtt1a,bulowski,3,Sun Jul 19 14:26:58 2015 UTC,You can now put and should put the newly released caramel bottles in the Hobart. There's an action item.

From what I know or have noticed, Caramel bottles both old and new cannot go in there, Anything related to the blender shields can become damaged (I've noticed our shields have begun to have its color strip and the rubber shrinks and warps), annnnnnnndddddd that is all I can think of for some reason.  I also don't recommend any metal objects because they can be better cleaned by hand and won't try to melt off you fingertips M.I.B. style when you take them out"
starbucks,3dtt1a,jacethegreat,8,Sun Jul 19 13:36:28 2015 UTC,No plastic objects and no metal objects basically would mean just don't put anything at all in the Hobart.

What annoys me, and what I think the earlier comment meant, is teens and tweens who are either two young to work or act so entitled to us as service workers that they obviously do not work themselves. That means that their parents are giving them over $100 to spend at Starbucks, so to people making barely above minimum wage, you can see how that is INCREDIBLY frustrating to see what amounts to what some of us have in our savings account just casually loaded on their Starbucks app to spend on a completely unnecessary luxury. Imagine seeing your coworker not be able to go to the chiropractor that they desperately need because of a high copay, and then see a tween come in and have that amount loaded onto their Starbucks card.  Do you treat baristas with respect? You don't have to go above and beyond, you just have to listen to them when they ask questions and respond, maybe smile and say thank you. I think you probably do because you said you reload so as not to inconvenience baristas, so  already, you are awesome. Keep doing what you do! Some of my favorite regulars reload with $50-$100 each time, I don't care. Some of them are even early twenties. In fact, like you mentioned, I appreciate it because I don't have to reload so much!  Sorry for making you feel worried! Just the fact that you worried about this tells me that you are most likely one of those people baristas love :)"

I do try to be respectful though, so maybe I'm not the biggest problem customer. I don't really like frappuccinos either so there's hope for me yet. I can see why age 15 me having $100 on my card would seem gross and irritating, but age 15 me was just as likely to spend it as age 21 me. Even writing this comment I feel like an asshole, and I hope all baristas who put up with me back then know I am sincerely apologetic for me and all other similar youngins"

The one customer that REALLY irritates me went on and on about what a good customer service person I was for being so patient with her the first time she came in. She apparently was a manager of her own company or something and said she wished her staff was half as nice as I was. At first I was flattered....until I realized she KEEPS coming in and being difficult on purpose to ""test"" us. .   I'm like....come on. It's borderline harassment or something. I don't want to lose my patience but EVERY time I ask her a clarifying question she's vague on purpose with the MOST sadistic smile I've ever seen on person. ugh  I need coffee."

She even said, ""I WON'T BE ABLE TO STAY HERE IF YOU DON'T TURN IT DOWN"". Not wanting to step on toes, we did, even though it wasn't that loud to begin with (bitch you've already bought your drink, we couldn't care less if you stay or not). Then she rushed the front POS green bean for her coffee (we were in the middle of peak, so he was swamped with customers and dealing with it a little harder because, again, green bean), all while being a little snob about it. Just a very entitled, snobbish, ""I'LL SPEAK TO YOUR MANAGER IF YOU DON'T GIVE ME WHAT I WANT RIGHT NOW"" attitude about everything.   So that kind of customer is my least favorite. You're in a Starbucks, not a 5 star cuisine restaurant. If you're only paying $2 for your coffee and then leaving, then don't complain about stupid stuff like music volume and slow service at peak, because at that point it's not even complaining, you're just on a bitchy power trip to assert your dominance over unsuspecting retail workers who are only getting paid minimum wage to put up with your BS."

As you can imagine eating at Starbucks is difficult but I've managed to figure out what things are safe and what things aren't. You pretty much take your health in your own hands anyways when eating out so I just stick to what I know is safe most of the time.   Your sugar free syrups have gluten in them. Your regular syrups do not. I know for a fact that are other people with gluten issues that come in and order things specifically assuming they are gluten free. If you put SF Vanilla in the whip cream you probably won't kill anybody but you will seriously ruin their day/week and possibly turn them off of Starbucks.

starbucks,3dsdt3,jdayvault,9,Sun Jul 19 14:00:23 2015 UTC,"Let me tell you the story of John, a barista who was instantly fired from a Starbucks not to far from yours.  It was a crisp autumn morning, and John was getting ready for his last day of work. He hadn't put in his two weeks or anything, but he knew that this was his last day.   The bus ride there was pretty uneventful. John put on his headphones and listened to some country song about a guy getting into a rough break up with his girlfriend. He got off the bus just as the song ended and shut off his phone.   Normally, John would enter through the front door and say hello to the other baristas that were already there, but today was different. John stood out front of the store and stripped naked. He tied his khaki pants around his waist and put his underwear on his head like some kind of deranged superhero. He ran at full speed and crashed through the window head first with his arms outstretched superman-style.  Partners and customers were screaming, both at and in fear of the naked man that just burst through the window. One customer even spilled her venti 194 degree 6 shot 12 pump skinny vanilla latte on Amanda, the partner at the bar. John got up and ran to the back, knocking over an man that was on his way to the bathroom and causing him to soil himself right there on the floor.  Once in the back room, John punched in and ran back out to the floor. He went over to the milk bar and poured half-and-half all over his head. He jumped up on a table and did a quick jig, jumped back off, and ran behind the bar. He grabbed two handfuls of steaming pitchers and threw them straight up in the air, proudly exclaiming that he made it snow when they hit customers and his partners in the head.   John made a dash for the till when he heard the sirens outside. He opened it up and made it rain on Amanda, who was still in a daze from John's snowstorm earlier. A policeman busted in through the door and told John to put his hands up. John disregarded this and threw a handful of dimes at him. The policeman drew his gun and said he will shoot if John doesn't comply. John ducked behind the counter to avoid injury, grabbed a bottle of raspberry syrup, took a swig, and threw the rest at the cop as a distraction while he ran to the back room.   When the cop got into the back, John was standing on the Hobart with an open gallon of whole milk in each hand. He dumped one on the officer's head and simultaneously drank the other. He jumped down and kicked the cop in the chest, WWE style, and ran to where the coffee beans are kept. He ripped open bag after bag, dumping them all over the floor. The cop tried to run over and restrain him, but he slipped on the beans. John ran back over to the front, stepping on the cop's back as he ran by, and made himself a trenta mocha frappuccino without ringing it out. He then took a two sips and left it a couple of inches away from the trash. After that, John jump back out the window he came in from. He went across the street to Dunkin Donuts and asked for a job application, thus breaking the non compete rule and got fired immediately.  TL;DR- Don't be like John. Stay with the Siren and don't get fired."

starbucks,3dsw92,NoHoursWithSiren,5,Sun Jul 19 03:29:05 2015 UTC,"It's doable, but you have to be good with time management.  Stick to your guns with availability. Give them your schedule, and build in time to study and have fun. Don't feel bad about saying 'no' to picking up a shift. If you're asked to work when you're not available, you're under no obligation to work; you're allowed to have a life.  Good luck!"

Any tips that you've learned along the way as far as time management?"
starbucks,3dsw92,SharkyTendencies,3,Sun Jul 19 05:00:50 2015 UTC,"My biggest, hugest, most important tip for time management is to write it down in a real physical agenda.  Shameless plug time. This is my agenda: https://polestarcalendars.com/calendars/original-student-calendar-2015/ This is my fifth year buying this damn agenda. I love it.  Seriously. There's a difference between putting in something in your phone and grabbing an honest-to-god pen and writing it down in a book. It takes you, perhaps, a few seconds longer to write something down, but that extra time is worth it. It makes you remember. Again, write it down and carry it with you. Check it every single day. Make it your one true love haha.  And yes. Schedule in study time and ""free time"". I know that it seems counterintuitive to schedule free time to play video games or watch TV, but it's important to do that to maintain work-school-life balance. Then, when you're on 'free time', you know that everything you need to do is taken care of, and you can actually enjoy what you're doing."
starbucks,3dsw92,dart51984,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:16:13 2015 UTC,I couldn't have said it better myself. Organization is key when it comes to time management. And being good with your timing is what will lead you to success in Sbux and literally everything else in life.

As a shift I am always at 40 hours (I absolutely have to be full time; I pay for everything including car/housing/tuition/etc, so part time is out of the question) and during the fall and spring semesters I am a full time student. I have to take Xanax to relieve my anxiety or else I cry my eyes out in the middle of class. I have 18 hours left til I receive my bachelors though so it's almost over!

starbucks,3dsw92,dart51984,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:40:42 2015 UTC,"It's possible to do both, however flexibility in scheduling will become a problem. Stick to your guns and don't get bullied into changing your schedule for the store needs. If you're hired to do the job with a certain availability, don't feel bad about saying no if they ""need"" you to change it. I'm not accusing your store of any shady dealings or anything, I've just been with the company for a long time and have seen some shit. And good luck! It's not rocket science, it's just coffee, I'm sure you'll do great!"
starbucks,3dsw92,ThirdEyeCentre,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:46:59 2015 UTC,Not OP but need some advice. I have had completely open availability for the entire time I've been a partner (5 months). I recently told my boss I'm not available on Sundays anymore for personal reasons and she said no. Is that even allowed?
starbucks,3dsw92,obsessioncalled,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:50:09 2015 UTC,"I believe the availability sheet is a contract for 6 months. It is shitty for her to say no but allowed, I think. Maybe you can compromise?"
starbucks,3dsw92,dart51984,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:42:13 2015 UTC,"Depending on what was agreed upon when you were hired, there's some wiggle room here but I believe for most partners the policy is one change in availability per six months. So once you hit six months, just print out an availability request form from the portal, fill it out, and give it to your SM and it's their job to work around that. Now if you're in a store where everyone and their friggen mother has decided they don't want to work Sundays anymore (like in my store) you're going to get some push back from your manager. They're just trying to save themselves the headache that is retooling the schedule to accommodate yet another change in their schedule which is probably pretty in flux anyways as most stores tend to be. That previous sentence hurt my brain and I can't think of a better way to say it because I'm incredibly tired, but I hope you get the point of what I'm trying to say. Good luck and don't get discouraged if things don't go your way, it's just coffee after all!"
starbucks,3dsw92,dart51984,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:48:51 2015 UTC,"Even though you weren't intentionally hitting at my store, you're right. I've seen it done, but I'll be sure to make sure that they stick with my availability. It's a contract and technically I don't have to work if its not in my availability (as what old Starbucks policy was, at least that's what some of the older partners tell me) .

I turned to a co-worker and I ask her, ""Is that really what I think it is?"" and she just walked away, shaking her head.  This is the big trash can next to the door on your way in and out, too. So, you know, someone came in with a bra in hand, and decided to stuff it in our trash, completely in view of the whole store. Why?..."

He's super easy, and stays for a few hours doing work a few days a week. Like I said, he's shy, but every now and then he surprises me and will start little conversations. I have such a soft spot for him, and always do extra little things if I can.   -This middle aged dude who has fought a lot of demons in his life. He orders his drink, has a little anecdote for us baristas while we're making it, then reads for a bit at a table. I like him because he talks to us beyond ""how are you"", but never lingers.   another middle aged dude who I just vibed with right off the bat. Comes in with his wife a lot. We'll joke around and it's just very organic with them, never forced.   -a husband and wife combo who never come in at the same time. She'll come in and get her usual and is super sweet. He'll come in and order his coffee and usually is a little grumpy and has something to complain about. it's funny because it's usually about his wife or the weather, and it's never mean spirited. Just ""ah, it's so hot and my wife wants to go sit in the sun all day. I don't understand it!"" And he gets very excited if you ask him about his son."

We found out that if your oven ""dings"" (which is a message that's sent or stored in its memory, not a sound) that means that you are using the oven more than it can handle and after that you get put on the list for one of the new ovens. This happened to us so now we're on the list but there's no timeframe.    We ran out of ice several times during Frappy Hour but nothing really outside of that, we've been low but never out."
starbucks,3drowr,alexeye,3,Sun Jul 19 14:13:26 2015 UTC,"For ice, I can't help ya. Ration your ice, as you've been doing - or failing that, a short scoop of ice MAX in ice waters.  Washroom lines out the door? Don't worry about it. If you're Playbook, your CS person should be able to flex to check and stock the washrooms. They have the ability to 'jump' the line, and if someone complains, then get the SS over to explain why it's necessary. (Because otherwise you won't have anything to wipe with, fool.) One huge reason for stress in high-volume stores is that the store is either understaffed or deployed incorrectly. Is EVERY position in the store filled? Is deployment where it should be? Are ALL your tills open? How many bar people do you have? Who is doing what? Is everyone sticking to their routines? If the store is as busy as you say it is, and your customer count is always over (my assumption), it brings up the question of why your SM isn't scheduling in another person to begin with. This is your SM simply not ordering correctly. The idea is that you order more than you think you'll need - and if you end up using more, hey, presto, you have enough. If you don't, the stuff will last and you can order down the following week. If you're running out of VB, Coffee Base, SFV... these are ingredients that are required, so perhaps your SM should consider ordering up.  Unfortunately, there's nothing you can do if someone decides to be a baby and throw a fit. Over ice. Hashtag FirstWorldProblems. Seriously, let them. And direct them to your SM, if s/he's there. That ought to light a fire under their butt to get on the ice machine being too slow. Do you guys do the ""bus-n-break"" thing? Before someone goes on their break, get them to do one side task. In my neck of the woods, these are a two-minute bus, stocking RTD, or a spot sweep. It keeps the store looking semi-tidy throughout the day.   Hope this helps!"
starbucks,3drowr,SharkyTendencies,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:52:36 2015 UTC,"My store would run out of ice every weekday if not for that we prepare iced coffee with a combination of ice and cold filtered water. When you're brewing a case+ of iced coffee a day, it makes a huge difference. As long as you're keeping true to the 1:1 ratio of coffee to ice/water, we've taste tested and found no difference - it fact it prevents the problem of unmelted ice filling up the dispenser. Add enough ice to cool it down, top the rest off with water."

starbucks,3dp9fi,XacTactX,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:52:41 2015 UTC,"Splenda is not sucralose it contains sucralose, it also has dextrose and maltodextrin to give it volume, most of the sweetness and calories comes from those two and they affect blood sugar more than sucralose. The irony is that those ladies might not have known that."
starbucks,3dp9fi,adamrobertt,3,Sat Jul 18 06:27:00 2015 UTC,"You're just arguing semantics, here, though.  Dextrose and maltodextrin are inert ingredients - they're simply a vehicle to deliver the primary ingredient which is the entire point of the product and which does all of the sweetening - which is called sucralose."
starbucks,3dp9fi,XacTactX,2,Sat Jul 18 15:04:11 2015 UTC,"They're not inert they're different forms of sugar, thats why splenda tastes similar to sugar and has 3.4 calories / gram"

They literally just removed the only ingredient with any nutritional value AND it has less sugar than non-fat. The milk fat isn't going to hurt your body the way white mocha and whipped cream sugar is. This shit just blows my mind every time it's ordered- even moreso when they talk about being on a diet.

That way if he calls corporate or does this again, there is a history about him on file and it will be easier to ban him. And of course if you personally don't feel comfortable serving him you should be able to go into the back or whatever and have someone else cover so you can avoid (we have a few partners at my store that have had to do this and it's worked okay until the situation blew over or the person was banned)."

I wasn't too sure if I got that one since my SM seemed less enthusiastic, but turns it it's just her personality. Store B knew that I had interviewed with store A the day before (SMs communicate a lot in my area), and wanted to steal me from store A. Since the background check was processed at A, me and my SM at store B had to go there to fill out social security forms and such.

As I sit her on my lunch break, the woman next to me and her three kids are making me nuts. All three of her children are running at top speed, screaming and have wandered into our back room and behind the bar several times. The mom reprimanded them ONCE and then turned back to her coffee and her equally oblivious friend. They have gone behind the bar and into the back room at least three more times. None of my coworkers have said anything because they are literally trying to just stay calm. Oh and even better. The annoying couple who brings in their brat kid just walked in and lo and behold---she's screaming at the top of her lungs. Awesome."

One of the ugliest temper I've ever seen in a kid. He even proceeded to punch the father in the chest. It wasn't a light hit either. His father or mother didn't really do much.....  Kids with no discipline.....
starbucks,3dn5n3,Maghion,2,Sat Jul 18 12:14:14 2015 UTC,"Aw man, we had the opposite last night. This couple came in with 5 kids under the age of 5 for what looked like a business meeting. As they were going over papers and signing them with a business woman the oldest was hitting the twins and the two others were playing tag in our tiny lobby and knocking beans off the wall. This went on for 45 minutes and the parents ignored them the entire time. I mean I get it, I come from a bigger family and sometimes my siblings and I got too rowdy. But my parents always took us outside to talk one on one about how inappropriate out behavior was and how we needed to improve or insert consequence here. And I know I only saw a tiny part of these people's lives but I really wished they would do something :P"

starbucks,3dn5n3,meowqueen,5,Fri Jul 17 18:57:35 2015 UTC,"Crudely phrased, but mostly true.  If my baby is making noise, happy or sad, I take him out to the car to calm down.  There are places I don't take him at all, like movie theatres or fancy restaurants.  That said, kids aren't perfect.  If someone has a 4 year old who has a complete meltdown while the parent is waiting for their coffee, I expect random bystanders to react kindly since the chances are that they were once 4 years old and a pain in the ass at least once in their lives.  I don't expect them to be happy about it.  I've never had fun listening to anyone throw a tantrum.  I do expect them to be civil and understanding."

And because of that choice I am free to go anywhere I want at any time I want without having to worry about someone other than myself!   It's cool if you have kids, a very selfless and awesome decision. But if you are going somewhere, don't let them annoy other people ESPECIALLY if those other people are paying to be somewhere- nobody should have to hear your kid screaming and crying while watching a movie at night or trying to have a dinner."

So if it inconveniences you for 15 minutes, then maybe just try to remember you were a kid once and chances are you weren't perfect every time you mom or dad to you in public.But you're right, there is a level of noise that is appropriate."

OP's store is different since I assume they're licensed but for us in corporate stores there was a memo a while ago when matcha water was a fad that we're not supposed to sell inclusions as a standalone drink. Things like matcha water, strawberry water, etc are supposed to be rang in as custom iced teas, and drinks that are well, already drinks are supposed to be charged properly too."

starbucks,3dnb61,AitherInfinity,4,Fri Jul 17 20:48:55 2015 UTC,"Custom iced tea. Like brewing Pineapple Kona Pop and pouring over ice.  You probably don't have to add matcha, that's what makes it ""tea""."
starbucks,3dnb61,harleyxj,2,Fri Jul 17 20:55:01 2015 UTC,You sub in the matcha through the custom menu - not for the extra charge (subbing it under the standard scoops per size won't cost extra) but so you can track it in inventory.
starbucks,3dnb61,AitherInfinity,3,Fri Jul 17 21:12:47 2015 UTC,"Our store doesn't allow multiple transactions, so I guess I'm lucky. Though I'm not stressing, I'm just laughing about how far a person will go to get something cheaper. We have one customer who complained about one of my partners not ringing her drink the way she said it. She said she wanted her Lemonade & Strawberry Puree juice to be rang as a Custom Iced Tea ($2.65 venti) instead of Lemonade + Strawberry inclusion ($4.05 venti). Said partner was written up for ""insubordination"".   So, I'll ring whatever you want to call it- but Im mentally judging the HELL outta you."

Giving as much time as possible is always super professional and appreciated. Two weeks is acceptable but often not enough time to hire and train.

I think that people will always wonder and ask questions, but as long as he's not telling people what you're taking a leave for?   For sure, it's in bad taste if you have not agreed on what the message to the team will be, he should let you be the one to tell people. Though seeing as people might start making assumptions, if you're not on the schedule and people see that, he would have to tell them that you're taking a leave of absence from work (and not a long vacation or something.)"
starbucks,3dpd3l,foreveralog,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:39:04 2015 UTC,The thing is it's about a parent dying of cancer which will be within the year but of course not an exact thing. It's pretty awkward when people are coming up and asking you why you are taking a leave of absence.
starbucks,3dpd3l,Shallow-Believer,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:59:08 2015 UTC,"For sure. That's why as long as the details aren't being spread around, just let them know that you have a family thing, or a personal thing to take care of. And I'm sure people are just genuinely concerned about you, that's why they're are asking!   It must have been difficult when you were surprised that people knew you were going to be away. It does happen though, where maybe partners see that you're not on the schedule anymore or something, and they will wonder what's happened.  I'm sorry to hear that though :("
starbucks,3dpd3l,phoebe9,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:21:46 2015 UTC,"I suddenly had to take a week off when my boyfriend died. My manager just told everyone I had a personal life event and to respect my privacy, and wouldn't discuss it until I was comfortable telling my coworkers what happened. I would just confirm with your manager that you want it to be a private matter and to let your coworkers know that you are okay but need time for a personal matter. And if anyone tries to push you to tell why before you're ready tell them that it's not something you're comfortable discussing. If they don't like that they can fuck off cuz you have no obligation to tell them about your family or your personal life and you shouldn't have drama or gossip at work distracting you from what's really important, which is your family."
starbucks,3dpd3l,phoebe9,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:27:00 2015 UTC,"Well,  obviously the partners know that you're not there.   And it's good for them to know that you didn't quit or get fired, so it makes sense for your manager to say you won't be around for personal reasons for a bit.   But the details of the leave should not be discussed."

starbucks,3doo0r,thegreatbarista,6,Sat Jul 18 00:07:50 2015 UTC,"I've seen 1 store with their Hobart set up with dish washing detergent, making it an actual dishwasher.    I think most stores just have it rinse the items, add the sanitize and then rinse the sanitize off the dishes so there is no chemical residue.    You need to wash and rinse the items using the detergent in the sink and then load washed items without any food particles into the Hobart.  The Hobart is just a replacement for sanitizing in the third section of the sink (using the quat sanitizer)."
starbucks,3doo0r,zappy312,4,Sat Jul 18 00:26:34 2015 UTC,"There are 5 steps in the dish washing routine. Pre rinse for visual debris, wash, rinse, sanitize and air dry.

Pre rinse for some includes scrubbing and bubbles, but good luck with labor."

starbucks,3doo0r,RequiemforaBean,2,Sat Jul 18 10:03:04 2015 UTC,Nope. Read the cleaning/equipment manuals. The Hobart is a dishwasher. Hence the detergent and the wash cycle.  edit: I have brought great shame upon the Great Siren. My store uses an LXi series machine which both washes and sanitizes. I suppose we lucked out.
starbucks,3doo0r,crazybarista,2,Sat Jul 18 04:49:33 2015 UTC,Maybe it depends on the specific machine/chemicals used because at my store it is most definitely just a sanitizer as well and does not eliminate the wash and rinse steps.

starbucks,3doo0r,jesthere,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:18:49 2015 UTC,"Hi-temp hobart is a dish washing machine that uses the detergent to wash, then heat to sanitize (it has to reach pass 180° in the rinse cycle.)  Low temp machines are the same, using detergent to clean, but instead of using heat, it uses chemical to sanitize, thus there would be two chemicals attached to the machine instead of one. (It should smell a little bit like the pool,  though if it smells too chlorine-y, it might be using too much.)  Any organic debris like food crumbs and such can go in fine, as they will dissolve. Things to watch out for is coffee beans, as they can clog up the drain pipe in the machine.   That being said, the water doesn't drain between each cycle, so if you were to pour a whole thing of mocha , or coffee grinds into it, your dishes will come out kinda dirty for a while.

starbucks,3doj0o,moshtilldeath,8,Fri Jul 17 23:23:49 2015 UTC,"I've actually taken 2 semesters at ASU online before I started working at Starbucks this summer, so I can give you some info about the academic program itself (I'm new to the Starbucks benefits side, just like you!). Anyway anyone that hasn't taken online classes will probably tell you that it's going to be super easy, a breeze compared to ""physical in-class schooling"". This is not true and I can say that because I've been in traditional college classes as well as ASU online classes. Some of the online classes I took were super easy. Others were incredibly hard. It just depends on the subject and the teacher. I made the mistake of taking geology for my science/lab credit. I don't remember the teacher I had off hand but I highly highly highly recommend that you DONT take geology. The subject itself was really easy and even interesting and I aced the lecture part of the class BUT, the lab part of the class is literal hell. I spent many nights crying over my computer over it and barely passed the class. I think the only reason I passed the class is because everyone else did horrible as well and she ended up grading us on a curve to not look like a shitty instructor. I don't mean to scare you off though, other than that specific class I've had an awesome experience with ASU online. Feel free to ask me any other questions!"
starbucks,3doj0o,Mandaaa5,3,Sat Jul 18 04:34:30 2015 UTC,"Go on about how the labs were hell! Need more details on why! In general, an area of studies such as Geology would be a pain in the ass to take online because most of the work is done physically!

starbucks,3doj0o,crazybarista,6,Sun Jul 19 06:14:08 2015 UTC,"I've been enrolled for the previous two semesters. I love it. The advisers are actually helpful, the classes are usually relatively hands-on, and all but one of my professors had live video study sessions. If you can stay motivated and actually complete your work, you'll love it.   The quick classes were an absolute godsend for me. I found it hard to stay focused in the 15 week classes at my old university. The 7.5 week classes at ASU make it feel as if I'm working through my degree faster, even if I'm actually earning credits at the same speed.  The reimbursement hits your paycheck really quickly, especially after the recent changes. The last one was in my bank account 10 days after the end of the semester.  Be prepared for the exams. Some classes require live video proctoring during the final exam (they verify your identity, watch your screen, and can see your face the entire time). It's a bit unnerving, but in essence it's not much different than a regular on-campus exam.  Best of luck!"

starbucks,3dnidd,prglenurgle,7,Fri Jul 17 18:35:34 2015 UTC,"You make a rough calculation. For this drink, I'd do it this way:    base VBF (assuming grande) is 400kcal 1 pump of any syrup is 20kcal whipped cream topping varies, but it is around 120kcal. caramel drizzle also varies, but I'd say a ballpark of 150kcal.   That brings this total to 710. Now sub whole milk with heavy cream, and I'd guesstimate that 1/3 of the cup is milk+frap roast, but obviously no frap roast - so 5 oz is milk (really 5.33, but don't need to be exact and makes calculation easy), and each oz replaced by heavy cream is an extra 85kcal. So your rough total comes to ~1150 kcal for your drink assuming it's grande. As someone who watches calories all the time to the point where I can't not think about it anymore, I do these calculations in my head all the time especially when I make custom partner beverages for myself.  Edit: just realized that I double-counted whipped cream, so the drink total is actually ~1000 kcal."

Honestly, there are occasionally delays in the interview/hiring process. It kinda sucks for the candidate, but that's the way it works, unfortunately.

starbucks,3dkum8,tetsuo9000,13,Fri Jul 17 07:17:36 2015 UTC,"I do the same thing as you. For the bananas how I've been getting around that is opening it down one length, and just squeezing it out like that. You're only touching the peel.

At my old store, one of my old partners had a habit of keeping the parchment paper from Veggie Fontiago sandwiches and eating the melted cheese. She did (does?) the same thing with Santa Fe's.   Before I was hired, in the name of science, some partners at my store blended a sausage breakfast sandwich and drank it. I only heard the story after I was hired and learned you can't blend food :(   I've heard of one partner who decided to toss banana peels on top of the shelving behind the counter that holds AHC specifically to piss off an SM. The flies got so bad at one point the SM had a small breakdown and spent an evening deep-cleaning the bar. The flies were back the next day.  In my pre-partner days, I, too, have had to clean up other people's poop. Unfortunately, there was no facilities number to call.

One time I had a frappuccino on my break and thought the whipped cream tasted off. I found out from someone at another store in the district that all of their heavy cream was rancid upon delivery. I let my SS know that we might be in the same situation, so she tasted some WC, giggled, and said, ""It DOES taste like cream cheese, tee hee!"" We continued to serve it, depsite having already had a customer complaint. I texted my SM about it and he ended up throwing all of it out when he came in the next morning.

A medium double double! You don't know what a double double is?! Double sugar double cream!!  Me: OHGODSHEJUSTWANTSDRIPI'MSOSORRY  Then I had to show her that there were no little creamer packets and she had to add everything herself.

starbucks,3dl9v7,PaulMcGannsShoes,6,Fri Jul 17 04:39:44 2015 UTC,"Ristretto shots have a stronger taste, but less bitter than regular espresso. The reason for this is that the more time (and more water) meets the espresso grounds, the ""late"" compounds get extracted and the more bitter the shots get. I'm sure you've heard from your fellow baristas or training videos that you do not want to over-extract normal espresso shots for this reason (keep it between 18-23 seconds). Ristretto shots use less water. Long shots are the opposite - they use more water (and therefore more time) and get ""over-extracted"", they have a weaker taste due to using more water, but more bitter too."

starbucks,3djcmp,jasminehulse,12,Fri Jul 17 00:40:31 2015 UTC,"I used to work at a busy downtown store in Chicago, we would get this drunk homeless man in all the time, he was such a mess and it was such a struggle to get him out every time. Once he came in 30 minutes before closing, completely wasted. He sat down in one of our comfy chairs and I couldn't stay on him to get out because were super busy, so he fell asleep. As we were closing i kept waking him up and telling him to leave, finally it was 15 minutes after we had closed, we swept and mopped around him, I kept nudging him, telling him I was gonna call the cops, he kept say 'im going...' finally he stood up and then passed right out on the floor. So I called an ambulance, it took them another 20 minutes to get there, meanwhile, people outside kept peering in the windows and trying to get my attention because they didnt think I realized there was a man passed out in my lobby... Ugh... I got home like an hour and a half late that night."

Then he retreated with his cart, as he could see we were calling the police.  The police arrived, the man was gone, and as we opened the door to survey the magazine shreds literally everywhere, we realised they were porn. Boobs, butts, and vaginas adorned our walkway...

Both times I think the culprit was the angry lady who informs me my bathroom smells horrible.  At my old store we had a homeless guy who would hang out sometimes and push his cart around our area. Smelled really bad talked to himself. A lot of our regulars would but him coffee, food or gift cards. He stopped coming around and didn't think much of it. One of me fellow partners helped with the homeless community and found out he had to be transported downtown and lived there now because his leg was amputated from severe Gangrene.... :(  Um other freak out stories? 1. Having a barista (I'm a shift) break my key off in the door. 2. Having a barista show up 45 minutes late to open because her phone changed an hour for daylight savings (was in AZ at the time with no daylight savings.) 3. First time opening as a shift ever, that's at a different store, that's a drive thru, safe is off 200-ish, and the water isn't working. 4. Ecosure coming while you and another barista are covering another store for their holiday meeting.  That's all I can think of right now.. Haha."

I am glad I haven't found any drug related stuff, but bagging a trash bag that has poop in it is gross... I think I ended up double bagging the double bag. I have no idea about the safe. The store that I was helping was in a management transition I think and it was chaos. The Ecosure visit was crazy too! My store had been hit like the week before and we got I think a 94? So the barista that was there with me was from my store too had been at my store for Ecosure. Then they walk in to this other store, and its just the two of us. Haha. We ended up getting a 96. Panicked a little bit because we had to have someone from our original store send up pictures of our food handlers cards and stuff. Poor barista had to deal with two Ecosure visits in less than a week... Haha."
starbucks,3djcmp,BAERamsdell,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:48:05 2015 UTC,yea the needles in the bathroom are scary because if you aren't paying attention to where you are grabbing the trash bag you could get stabbed! i just read on here that that is actually grounds to close the bathroom and call facilities though (Same with blood or feces) so i will probably just do that next time.
starbucks,3djcmp,danamul,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:44:20 2015 UTC,"1) I try to never give anyone else my key.  2) When I was still a barista, my shift was late. I didn't have her number. I called the SM, and he called her. However, she lives like 30 minutes away and was already 20 minutes late when my SM finally answered. We normally go in at 4:30. She rolled up about 5:25. The 3rd partner was already there along with a handful of angry customers."
starbucks,3djcmp,double-shot-on-ice,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:12:34 2015 UTC,"1.That's true. I was lucky because it happened in like the middle of the day. We had this one door that had a push handle and a twist handle to leave, it was really convenient at night because the door could be locked but you didn't have to unlock it to leave. Anyways, we were having issues with it locking itself during the day. So like 9am happens and its locked during our rush and I send my barista to go unlock it..  2. That was basically what happened. I call her at 4am she answers thinking its 3 am, but lives 30-45 minutes away. That day was a lot of fun. My store had a lot of regulars that would show up right at open, normally 4:30, so standing outside telling them we can open yet was really fun."

One business man who ordered an iced coffee with soy said he wanted a refund, i was still new and our bux doesnt do refunds you would have to go to the service desk which would take longer. His drink was litterly the next one in line and so frustrated, myself, i slopped together his drink and slid it to him.  Another guest: right now we are doing the grande on us cards. A guest orfers venti teas and grande CM and they wanted a sticker for there cards. I told them which it also reads on the back of their card. That you can only get a card or sticker if you get a GRANDE iced COFFEE or TEA and they said the famous ""other starbucks has given us the stickers"" and i told them i could get in trouble for doing that. After they left fine and happy, the girls went up to the upfront manager of the store i work in and they offered to give them 2 free Venti drinks, i got yelled at cause i didnt talk to a manager and now our rule for those stupid cards. Ia to tell them the rules once and if they use that famous line, just give them the sticker. I now hate those cards."

starbucks,3djmxj,Vladgren,3,Thu Jul 16 20:22:44 2015 UTC,"Some of your sequencing is wrong based on the beverage repeatable routine. For example: you have PTL first and then a latte: you're supposed to pour tea and lemonade into the shaker then STOP, then get pour your milk to steam and queue shots then STOP. Then back to your PTL with ice, shake, pour, finish and connect, and prep your third drink before finishing the latte."
starbucks,3djmxj,SaltyBarista,2,Thu Jul 16 21:35:59 2015 UTC,"Any other improvements that could be made? I'd love to hear more of your ideas. I love being able to do things a little more efficient and a little faster. For me, starting up the latte first makes more sense so I could finish the PTL and the latte at the same time, going to my PTL, back to my latte, back to PTL, ice, shaking, and going back to my bar seems a little inefficient."
starbucks,3djmxj,SaltyBarista,2,Thu Jul 16 21:45:11 2015 UTC,"I'd argue that it's not faster. Instead, now there's a larger gap of time between calling your first two drinks and your third drink. You may have more idle time, as you're now just standing there waiting for the shots to pull and the milk to finish steaming if you don't have a 4th drink in line, but no it's probably not faster. More importantly, it's not standard and depending on how the customer sees it, it's probably unfair because customer #1's PTL was first, and could've been made, finished, and called out first, but instead that customer #1 had to wait a little extra longer so both drinks can be called out at the same time when this routine isn't actually faster.  Same point I'd like to make for the frappuccino. Instead, it's just all wrong because frappuccinos take much longer to make (did you forget to account for blend time?), but you advise to get the milk and shots going first, despite being the second drink. By the time you gather your ingredients for the frappuccino, the latte will be finished right as you start blending, and now customer #2 gets their drink before customer #1 who still needs to wait for you to pour the blended contents into a cup, top with whipped cream and toppings, and then finish and connect. The correct way should've been: gather your ingredients for frappuccino, start blending, and then prep your latte. By the time the latte prep is done, you can get your frappuccino and top it. After that your latte should be done and you can serve both drinks at the same time, if that is what you really want to go for, even though you should've finished and connected with customer #1 before finishing the latte.  At the end of the day, these minor things are not a big deal, but as a guide it's not a very good one and doesn't come close to increasing speed and efficiency, sorry to say."
starbucks,3djmxj,bigfudge2013,2,Thu Jul 16 22:13:27 2015 UTC,"Agree! If you are finishing two drinks at the same time, your sequencing is off somehow and your times are going down. We should aim to hand out drinks in a continuous rhythm, not by pairs. (Of course some things like simple iced bevs or waters throw this rhythm off, but that shouldn't be out goal)"
starbucks,3djmxj,velogirl,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:53:30 2015 UTC,"Will definitely start incorporating this into my bar routine now. My logic was I'm getting two drinks done at the same time with just a small sacrifice. Maybe doesn't help to increase bar speed to someone such as yourself but to someone knew I could see it. I'll edit the into the way you two are suggesting it. This is great, we're talking about bar efficiency!"

starbucks,3di894,Bean_Queen,5,Thu Jul 16 22:50:00 2015 UTC,"There are lots of recipes online, but I make mine in a french press.  I grind my coffee coarsely.  I use equal parts coffee grounds to water, and let it sit in the french press at room temperature for at least 12 hours.  The starbucks version steeps for 20 hours.  I plunge the french press to get any grounds out.  Sometimes I will also strain it through a coffee filter.  I just use a funnel over a jar with a paper filter.  You can get a pack of them for like $1 at the grocery store.  Straining it through the filter gets rid of some of the excess oil and sediment left in the coffee.  What you end up with is a thick concentrate that you can dilute with water or milk.  Like I said, there are lots of recipes online that will give you more precise measurements.  Since you end up with a concentrate, it's easy to travel with.  You can take it in a small water bottle, and then add it to ice water when you want to drink it.  Much tastier than the instant coffees we sell.  I like our Gold Coast, Komodo Dragon, or Kenya coffees as cold brew."

starbucks,3dk9vs,sorcerer165,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:01:09 2015 UTC,"A couple notes..  First, stores don't grind opened bags of regular coffee. For two reasons, safety and quality - if we grind just anything then just anything gets brewed at the store. Over time it would affect the taste of the drinks. And clearly safety, as an opened bag of whatever coffee could have whatever in it, and a malicious person could make use of this to cause hysteria.  Next, no, I would not recommend using any old grinder. The ones at grocery stores have to be calibrated by the company that sold them to the chain, which is usually too much hassle. As a result, the grind is typically completely wrong, to the point of it adversely affecting your experience. You paid good money for that coffee, respect it and treat it nicely.  My solution is go to a Starbucks. Explain that you're a new customer and didn't realize you bought whole bean coffee. You may have to suffer a chortle or an eye roll, but so long as it's Starbucks coffee the Barista should oblige. Promise to be more vigilant and carry on with life. In the event this doesn't work, return to the store you purchased it and explain, again, that you didn't know it was whole bean and stores are refusing to grind it for you because you opened it. Swap it out with an unopened bag (which should work, methinks) and get it ground on the spot.  Edit: if you have questions about grinding ask them here abd I will answer them."
starbucks,3dk9vs,jesthere,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:35:47 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the tips, I'll keep them in mind. Also, a quick question: What's a good at home grinder I could buy for my future coffee?"
starbucks,3dme1v,datest9,12,Fri Jul 17 13:18:49 2015 UTC,"It's not a speed thing, they actually do taste awful if you left them just sit there. Granted if you have a 10 pump white mocha you probably wouldn't notice but it's just good practice to not let them turn bitter for anyone's drinks."
starbucks,3dme1v,sbuxreddit,22,Fri Jul 17 13:30:37 2015 UTC,Pull two shots. Enjoy the first one within 7-10 seconds. Wait 30 seconds and try the second shot then get back to us. (Source: Barista Trainer. They make you do this during training for a reason.)
starbucks,3dme1v,DinosaurDreams,6,Fri Jul 17 13:28:56 2015 UTC,"If a person orders straight espresso or maybe in a cappuccino they'd taste a difference. Unless they order a doppio and immediately chug it they won't get the fresh shot anyway. That said your goal is to deliver the best and fastest handcrafted drinks but sometimes when you're busy and making drinks on both hot and cold bar, you might miss a shot by a few seconds. Just gotta gauge it."
starbucks,3dme1v,Orgrath,5,Fri Jul 17 13:42:43 2015 UTC,"Valid point. However, just because folks might not notice it does not mean we shouldn't hold all beverages to that standard.  I would rather repull shots than hand someone a less than standard beverage. That being said, why would they give us sandwiches that take 1.5 minutes to heat and want window times of 30s... I will never know."
starbucks,3dme1v,DinosaurDreams,2,Fri Jul 17 14:03:24 2015 UTC,"It's not about numbers for me. I really try to connect with my customers. Drive thru as well. The way I see it is a balance. You need to make patrons happy (speed, accuracy, quality, connection) and you need to be try to follow standards. To pull from will take some of the other. Would you repull a shot if it extracts outside the ideal pull time by only a second or two? Same kind of answer... it depends on the situation. Because one 12-pump mocha isn't going to be able to taste a difference. But if someone orders a doppio, you should make sure that they get the shots first. In an ideal situation you'd be able to follow 100% policy, but at the end of the day if a customers experience is ruined it can be a deal breaker."
starbucks,3dme1v,Orgrath,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:50:09 2015 UTC,"I'm in a cafe store, so I've never really thought of this aspect. Our goal is 30 or less as well, but once I ring you through my part of the transaction as done. In other words, that 1.5 minutes will not be a part of it. When does the ""wait time"" technically begin and end when a customer is in the drive-thru?"
starbucks,3dme1v,itsjustcoffeebro,2,Fri Jul 17 15:13:34 2015 UTC,There's actually three goal times.  1) When the car hits the plate an starts two timers. The first is how long you have to take the order (30s or less). The second is how long the car has been in the dt que. 2) At the window another timer starts for the order to be out and tendered in under 50s (during peak). So over all the total should ideally be under 1min and 20s  total.
starbucks,3dme1v,DinosaurDreams,5,Fri Jul 17 15:54:32 2015 UTC,"Oh hey what's up I'm an Italian who has enjoyed espresso every single morning for decades and I always...ALWAYS drink the espresso shots as fast as I can, Because if not they will DIE.        not."
starbucks,3dme1v,marklovesapple,7,Fri Jul 17 14:03:15 2015 UTC,I let a shot sit around for over an hour and then tried it. -10/10 wouldn't do it again.
starbucks,3dme1v,VUILGEBOOSTED,2,Fri Jul 17 14:37:58 2015 UTC,"I had a friend who worked in a little mom and pop coffee shop. For ices drinks they would ""prep"" a tray of shots and keep them in the fridge for the day pulling them out when an iced espresso beverage was ordered. Even she said it was a pretty foul method and they would constantly get customers who commented on the difference in their hot/iced espresso beverage quality."
starbucks,3dme1v,itsjustcoffeebro,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:16:27 2015 UTC,That's so strange. I wonder why they did that.
starbucks,3dme1v,VUILGEBOOSTED,3,Fri Jul 17 15:42:44 2015 UTC,"In a plain latte, macchiato, or cappuccino you most certainly CAN taste the difference."
starbucks,3dme1v,aliceinconverse,2,Fri Jul 17 16:13:15 2015 UTC,"Except that there is most certainly a difference.  If people are paying for a drink, it's our job to serve it properly.  You were hired to make drinks, not sit around letting shots die.  It's your job.  If you don't like it quit and work somewhere else"
starbucks,3dme1v,glitchmaster4000,2,Fri Jul 17 14:32:45 2015 UTC,Clearly you have not tried a dead espresso shot. It's nearly on par with eating one of the pucks out of the tray.
starbucks,3dme1v,Leadpumper,2,Fri Jul 17 17:23:34 2015 UTC,"Espresso flavor changes depending on the temperature of the shot. Shots pulled and enjoyed within 10 seconds taste great, but that's not how we typically serve our drinks.   I call bs on the importance of repulling ""dead"" shots. Adding milk or ice, or anything for that matter technically kills the shot. Even handing off a dopio, the customer probably isn't downing it within the desired time range."

starbucks,3dh4lu,823049283490,4,Thu Jul 16 06:54:22 2015 UTC,Good for you. I don't typically see people get fired for this. Usually they let the manager know and it is worked out discreetly and to the satisfaction of everyone. That or just nobody ever finds out and you eventually die with that fun little secret.
starbucks,3dh4lu,softfern,10,Thu Jul 16 15:46:28 2015 UTC,Super bad idea unless you're okay with one of you getting fired.
starbucks,3dh4lu,Atlas_Fortis,12,Thu Jul 16 07:20:28 2015 UTC,Meh if even one person finds out I'll let my SM know before anyone else does and get transferred. Also pretty hard to fire someone without any proof and we're pretty careful so I'm not extremely worried about it.

starbucks,3dh4lu,bean-juice,10,Thu Jul 16 06:44:35 2015 UTC,"Throwaway. I did this. Last October or so through the beginning of December. Short fling. New transfer comes in. We worked in a college town. I was a shift, she was a barista.  I came in one day, she sees me, starts asking other baristas about me. I had come off of a long term, rough relationship a few months prior, so I'm not really paying much attention to anyone. I was a grad student in my late 20s, she was 19. We ended up hitting it off. I was at her dorm A LOT. It was so awkward working with her because she was that lazy barista that didn't want to do anything and I needed to get shit done. One night, we were closing with another barista who was cool with what we were doing, and actually worked to set it all up. We made out in the back a couple times that night. Even got out in time.  Still went back to her dorm afterward. I transferred out, but that was already in the works before she came in. Long story short, she went home for the holidays and never heard from her again. Wrecked me a bit because I thought we had something. Oh well. Moved on to better things and better women.    From a business standpoint. Very wrong, but damn was it hot."

The manager at the time really liked him and we were on friendly terms since I quickly became a regular, so when he mentioned to her I was looking for a job she told me to apply at the store knowing we were in a stable long-term relationship and unlikely to cause drama.

starbucks,3djlmt,haydenj96,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:27:29 2015 UTC,A couple people at my store had their birthdays put in wrong initially so they've got a bux birthday and their actual birthday.

starbucks,3diq65,dangusface,9,Thu Jul 16 16:24:51 2015 UTC,"I dont think its an expiry issue. They come looking like that too sometimes, especially when the delivery arrives during cold weather. The airlock on the bag is supposed to let air escape but not get in, when a cold delivery comes into the warm store the higher pressure warm air causes the bags to compress and they cant undonwithout being opened"
starbucks,3diq65,kiwi_goalie,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:01:38 2015 UTC,"Thanks! For some reason, a few people at my store were under the impression that this indicated expiration, but this makes a lot of sense.."
starbucks,3diq65,crazed_cyclopath,2,Fri Jul 17 01:58:36 2015 UTC,"Fresh coffee lets out gas, which is why we have one-way valves on the bags. They would pop otherwise. I would say it gets compressed (in a box or squeezed between other things) and lets everything out, giving it the vacuum sealed look."
starbucks,3diq65,kakasensei,0,Thu Jul 16 16:56:21 2015 UTC,they actually explained this in a semi recent faq/action item thingy. it was explained as due to the difference of sea level during transport from the warehouse to store it creates a compressed look. the faq also said that it is not expired if the coffee is not compressed.

starbucks,3dgnxr,spivnv,2,Thu Jul 16 17:54:27 2015 UTC,Daily orders are foods/drinks that go in the case. Not sure from where.
starbucks,3dgnxr,Wonderground,2,Thu Jul 16 20:25:39 2015 UTC,"Not just coffee, but at least coffee. Most of the non-perishables come through the RP order."

starbucks,3djil2,AmazingZebra,2,Thu Jul 16 20:10:35 2015 UTC,That's a good idea. It might help the person on bar to ask what the customer wants instead of the banana.

starbucks,3djil2,skimbleshanks2,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:05:37 2015 UTC,"I usually ask if they'd prefer more of a certain ingredient..the nicest consistency for me involves a tall scoop of ice, and a splash more juice and milk..no change in protein. It fills the cup nicely."

starbucks,3de6sz,lacivilokra,16,Wed Jul 15 16:00:13 2015 UTC,"I have felt the exact same way.  Back when I was a green bean, I made two caramel Frappuccinos that got returned.  I asked what was wrong, but they couldn't describe what was wrong.  They just said it tasted off.  I remade them, but I was always curious about what I did wrong when making them.  Did I forget the syrup, the base?  I'll never know."
starbucks,3de6sz,zappy312,5,Wed Jul 15 16:54:51 2015 UTC,"I find that my green beans (myself included when I was) tend to forget to put frap roast in first before pouring the milk in, and that tends to make it taste ""not right.""

starbucks,3de6sz,stephshalyn,7,Wed Jul 15 17:09:43 2015 UTC,"You'd love to see the state of some of the stores I've worked at in the past.  For some reason many baristas seem to feel that it's fine to add every ingredient bar the ice in whatever order they want - all into the cup before throwing it into the pitcher.  Take a grande mocha frapp...they'll put 3 pumps of the base into the cup, then milk to whatever line they fancy, add the frap roast, add mocha, throw it in the pitcher, add ice and blend.  As I've pointed out to them to no avail - trying to speed the process up by doing that will only slow it down when customers come back complaining about their drink."

starbucks,3de6sz,zappy312,8,Wed Jul 15 18:02:49 2015 UTC,I'm a non-employee lurker on this sub. I rotate drinks often and get java chips frequently. I'll say that the handful of times I've had drinks remade it always seems to be the java chip frap. No idea why but maybe the chips are inconsistent. Usually it's not the same level of sweetness as a normal one.

He thought I was accusing him and got kind of defensive, saying ""the other starbucks I go to always does it right"". I apologized again, remade it and he still didn't like it, he said it was too sweet (finally something to go off of!) so I made him a third latte, this time adding one pump less syrup and bam, its how he always got it. He thanked me left. Okay, we weren't busy, some milk wasted but whatever. Few days later he comes in, asks for me and apologies. He tells me he complained to a barista at this other starbucks that he is a regular at, and apparently years ago his partner got him the two pump vanilla grande caramel macchiato which he never remembered so they remembered for him and he thought that what he was getting was a standard drink while actually they just remembered his modifiers. Anyway, I thanked him for coming back and he called my manager to 'praise me' or whatever (helped me out during my review)."

starbucks,3ddvms,rnarkus,4,Thu Jul 16 01:06:26 2015 UTC,"Hah! Exactly, they give us enough labor to do basically the bare minimum to get by, day to day. Pre-closing is a rushed through mess, with a lot of things left dirty or not up to par. (Lobby for example?) And closing is ""Hopefully we get everything we are supposed to get done, and pray for anytime to do anything else nice for morning crew."" But god forbid you are there past when you are supposed to be, regardless if you are slammed all day, and the time where no customers are there is the only real time you can do anything of value.  Then they want weekly and monthly cleaning tasks assigned to everyone, which no one has time for. I'd love to run a spotless store, but it just doesn't work that way with the labor provided. And my store has the blessing of being incredibly clean compared to others. I'd hate to imagine what it's like at a truly busy and dirty store."
starbucks,3ddvms,MrKlowb,8,Thu Jul 16 01:55:02 2015 UTC,"~16 months ago they realized GLS was overstaffing and took that labor. ~2-3 months ago a labor test ended (they had been giving slightly more labor) also ended for certain test stores.   If you were in that test group, then you should have seen a message on the Portal. If that was the case, your feelings are correct and you are indeed being given less labor."
starbucks,3ddvms,Solidhandshake,5,Wed Jul 15 14:47:33 2015 UTC,"The DCR should be your Main tool.

starbucks,3ddvms,kakasensei,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:05:25 2015 UTC,"They are breaking records - but the expectation is some unreasonably high amount of growth like 8%.

starbucks,3ddvms,sbuxreddit,3,Wed Jul 15 19:16:53 2015 UTC,"Another issue is that Starbucks on a whole may make a profit but certain regions aren't hitting their targets or even comping over last year.

starbucks,3ddvms,obsessioncalled,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:34:47 2015 UTC,"It's better, it's not anything to complain about.  The company acknowledges that being under it's JUST AS BAD as being over. No one is cutting labor--being under 2 hours Monday and over 2 hours Tuesday used to be a wash, but now that's a 4 hour variance.  So rather than cut labor later to make up earlier mistakes, you shoot for zero every day."
starbucks,3ddvms,daeryon,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:52:19 2015 UTC,But technically we should've been shooting for zero all along. So what happens now at the end of the week when we have not been at zero everyday?
starbucks,3ddvms,obsessioncalled,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:44:15 2015 UTC,"So I'm going to explain the old way, and the new way.  Up until now, labor was calculated on a running tally.  Monday +1, Tuesday -2, Wednesday +5, Thursday -4, Friday +1, Saturday -4, Sunday +2.  That yields -2 hours for the week; at a store with 450 labor hours a week that's literally nothing and is considered ""successful.""  In fact, under the old system that week is more successful than being +.33 hour over each day (twenty minutes), or 2.31 hours.    In reality, the first week was awful.  We had the wrong partners at the wrong times, so some day were ""easy"" and we were overstaffing and wasting labor, while other days we were struggling.    Under the new system, using ""absolute value,"" we see there was a total labor variance of 19 hours on the first week, or a 4.2% variance.  Under the second week, there was a total labor variance of 2.31, or .51%.  Now, we're correctly acknowledging that the latter scenario is WAY BETTER for the business than the former, even though we were ""slightly over"" each day.  ""Slightly over"" is now out of the equation.  In short, you simply want to be under a 3% variance EACH DAY.  There is no more ""cut labor on Thursday because we ran over on Wednesday,"" each day starts fresh with ""Have the right number of people.""  The reporting enforces this--not only does it give the weekly total variance, it color-codes each day as green, yellow, orange, red (+7%).  Perfect world is green each day, and it lets us see if we're consistently over/under scheduling a particular day."
starbucks,3ddvms,daeryon,0,Fri Jul 17 01:31:02 2015 UTC,Yeah I'm perplexed. We were told to cut hours today but we had barely enough staff for a normal day. Who am I going to send home when there's just three of us and I'm trying to close the store with a never-ending line.  I just don't understand how labor works.

starbucks,3dexle,Cynicbats,2,Wed Jul 15 20:48:03 2015 UTC,"Nope, unfortunately. Cold brew is a completely different process. As a customer I think you'd have a hard time with getting a custom iced coffee, but I could be wrong about that. The partners at my store just let me go behind the line on my day off so that I could brew my own coffee since I didn't have to disturb them.  I don't know if there's actually an official recipe but as far as I know we may be able to do iced pourovers, but Kati Kati is a medium roast so unless the store you frequent doesn't mind taking beans that you bought or will open a bag just for you, you're probably out of luck unless you brewed at home.  Thankfully though, it really isn't that difficult. Easiest recipe for that is to brew a pot with double the amount of coffee grounds you'd usually use for the amount of water you're brewing with. Starbucks generally recommends 2 Tbsp of coffee for every 3 oz of water when brewing iced coffee, and 2 Tbsp for every 6 oz when brewing hot.  Once you brew, you'll want to put the coffee you brewed into a measuring container or pitcher and cut it with half ice, followed by a good stir. For example, if you brewed 16oz of hot coffee, you'll want the total volume after adding ice to be 32oz. This should keep in the fridge for a couple days.  Let me know if you have any questions. Enjoy! :)"

If my manager scheduled me, I'd kindly say, ""hey, so I told you months ago that I wouldn't be here this weekend. Just a heads up that you should fix this or you'll be short staffed.""  My life does not revolve around Starbucks. Exams, family time, etc are more important to me.   If it was requests, your manager should then deny the request at an appropriate time (weeks before) so you can make arrangements. That's how real jobs work; they don't just tell you a week in advance that your request was denied, when you're already planning travel time etc."

starbucks,3dg728,ventidgaf,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:09:49 2015 UTC,I agree with the frappuccino suggestion.

She was mean to everybody and bossed everyone around. Turns out, she was a drug addict and was stealing tips and money out of the drawers. Only then did she get fired. I'm sorry to say she only got verbal warnings for her behavior and attitude.   When everybody complained to our SM about her, he acted like there was nothing he could do about it. But at least he kept a close eye on her. That's when we found out she was stealing.   Maybe if everybody in your store complains about this jerkoff of a SS you're dealing with, your SM will have to investigate. Then maybe this person will slip up and get caught doing something idiotic that will get them fired on the spot. Wishful thinking?????? ;)"

I couldn't imagine anyone being promoted who couldn't be composed or friendly (you just wouldn't even make it to the DM approval). My only advice is to attempt to get a series of people to launch complaints to your DM. Failing that, go to partner resources. In many cases, head office operates with far more power than people realize and they are all about maintaining image.   As a note, it is very difficult to get fired but after at least 5 written warnings, you can be fired. Before that, it is very hard. Soon as you're at five, you'd need extreme circumstances to stay."

starbucks,3ddqm4,thatonebaristathere,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:45:42 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the replies folks. The issue I have with talking to the SM is that pretty much everybody at some point has said something, and you would think that over the years and through all of the complaints, something would have been done, but it isn't. I feel like the SM is unwilling to do what's necessary at the risk of hurting the SSV's feelings, and my view on this might be quite cutthroat and cold but personally I think as a manager it's your job to manage your staff in whatever capacity is required, which means getting rid of people who are distressing every other partner there, and causing numerous complaints from customers.  I understand that it's difficult to just fire someone, and as far as I'm aware steps are being taken to try and improve her, but you can't fundamentally change a fully grown adult, and when the personality is the problem, then it's a doomed marriage, and the SM needs to say enough is enough, something has to change.  I don't want everyone at the store to feel like they have to be careful around me, or feel like I've 'betrayed' this SSV by going to PCC, but it seems like someone needs to do it or nothing will change.  Would you say it's worth telling the manager that I plan to do this so that he has a heads up?"
starbucks,3ddqm4,lacivilokra,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:52:14 2015 UTC,You don't have to say anything. Your SM already had the chance to rectify the situation and they didn't. Time to call someone else.

starbucks,3ddjec,cspruce89,2,Wed Jul 15 15:55:03 2015 UTC,This is not true at all in my area. College town where most of the managers ignore those calls or make them as short as possible because most of the applicants want to work ridiculously few hours. They call the people that fit the needs of the store.  We have anywhere from 5-10 calls a day from people looking to follow up on their applications.

You should think about messaging your DM too. :D Im happy for you though"
starbucks,3delq2,Deliciousconcha,5,Wed Jul 15 17:46:30 2015 UTC,"You'll love it, I promise! Be sure to check out the coffee (of course), as they have reserves that haven't been sent out to stores yet along with a blend exclusive to the roastery; right now it's Gravitas. There's also special drinks they make there too; I highly recommend the Americano Con Crema. You can watch them roast the beans and the roasters are extremely nice and willing to tell you all about what they're doing. Also, eat the food! It's all super delicious (I have a berry tart from there in my fridge right now, haha) and Serious Pie is also fantastic. They have a lot of merchandise that's available only at the Roastery and you get your discount!   Also, check out the bathroom. I know that sounds weird, but there's a cool wall with the coffee journey from bean to cup on it (and they have nice bathrooms).  Have an awesome time!"

At my store we have 2 blenders and 2 blender pitchers, and if you get in the right groove it can be fun, but our store is also set up weird with the ice being in the middle of the frap area next to the blenders, so people are constantly trying to inch by you for teas.  I would definitely make hot drinks then fraps over making teas or doing oven stuff ANY day.  Plus, whipped cream is pretty fun. And man, I agree about the Fizzio. I loathe anyone who wants fizzed, especially since they're promoting it now. What a waste of customer money."

However, I've noticed that I get an allergic reaction when I have a creme based Frappuccino (not strawberries and creme for some reason).  Now it could be something other than HFCS, but I don't know. I haven't had the time to check ingredients while on shift and I'm still a green bean. I'll check for you next time I work!"

The strawberry juice might have some, or the creme base might have some. Also, try checking the Classic syrup -- I doubt it, but it's another component that might have HFCS. Please let me know! I'm highly allergic to practically the whole world outside of Sbux (damn you, coconut milk and banana nut loaf), but it's the least allergenic food service job I've worked so far.

starbucks,3dcpy7,SuperVintendo64,6,Wed Jul 15 06:21:21 2015 UTC,"No. If you answer yes to that question, they'll expect to find you in the corporate database along with a partner number and a recommendation about whether you're rehireable or not.  Since you haven't worked for the company before and therefore have none of these, you should say no. You should still mention you worked at a licensed store before if there's another space where you can add comments, but I'm pretty sure that's not the purpose of the ""Have you worked for Starbucks corp before"" field."

I've had many perfectly made Flat Whites, but a few times the foam seemed too airy and bubbly, not silky and smooth. How can I mention this to the barista without sounding like a clown shoe asshat?"

starbucks,3dbcxy,skimbleshanks2,4,Wed Jul 15 14:39:32 2015 UTC,Unfortunately there's no good way to tell someone they've messed up. If the drink isn't enjoyable I'd still encourage you to mention it to the barista and hopefully feelings won't be hurt and they'll be happy to make you a better one (as we should).
starbucks,3dbcxy,austinontheinternet,3,Wed Jul 15 02:03:44 2015 UTC,"If it's easier for you to handle you can go back to the register and tell them why you want your drink remade, instead of asking the person on bar directly."
starbucks,3dbcxy,BionicBeans,3,Wed Jul 15 17:49:43 2015 UTC,"A cappuccino is on the other end of the latte spectrum from a flat white. A flat white is about more espresso, creamy milk and minimal dense foam. A Starbucks cappuccino is airier, with half foam, half milk, and some espresso (though traditionally   It should be equal amounts foam, milk, and espresso)."
starbucks,3dbcxy,OwlAssassin,2,Wed Jul 15 07:09:28 2015 UTC,"The flat white has a thin layer of micro foam on top. This gives it the velvet texture.   A cappuccino is about a third to half foam,  but stiff foam rather than micro."

The hazelnut, coconut milk, and whip are all included in the iced coffee price. You should be paying $1.20 more than usual for the size.  Make sure they charge you for ""with coconut milk"" and not ""coconut milk,"" which is another charge. It will show up on the register and receipt. The iced coffee with milk means that the charge is with coconut milk.  The whip will be no charge either way, nor will ""light ice."" Also, the milk chocolate (which can be substituted with our normal mocha, but you'll want to do extra coconut milk, one less pump to make it more similar to the milk chocolate. Same price) and caramel crunchies will be going really soon! Get this while you want it.  It looks like you're trying a Salted Caramel Iced Coffee. Not really a thing, but I have a bunch of people looking for it.   Iced Coffee Mocha Toffee Nut (Some people half the amount of mocha and toffee nut. For example, each would get 4 pumps for a grande; some do 2 and 2. I find that makes for a sufficiently sweet beverage.) X Milk (Whatever you like) Whipped cream Caramel drizzle, and caramel crunchies.   Personally, I would do 2/2 for the mocha and toffee nut, then add one pump of caramel. It's free as well, and I actually get to taste it through the drink instead of trying to drink it through the whip at the end. It will significantly lessen your weekly cost as well."

starbucks,3dc3mi,cosmicpizza,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:30:31 2015 UTC,"I've actually had it in an iced coffee. It does not blend well but I still like it. It's more like a fudge than a sauce so you'll suck up small bits of solid-ish chocolate fudge, which I like. But if you're looking for a really chocolatey flavor in the overall drink it won't work well. And I stir the crap out of it.   Maybe if you added a shot of espresso and had them use that to ""melt"" the milk chocolate sauce before adding the iced coffee. But I've never tried that"

starbucks,3db0o8,ASCII_Man,3,Tue Jul 14 21:48:47 2015 UTC,A) yes but you have to be paid for that time. What my SM does is you clock out for your shift and then you write in the book for the time you do tips so she can put it in as Ops 2  B) it's based on hours worked over 40. Also in my state hours worked over 8 in a day.
starbucks,3db0o8,haydenj96,5,Tue Jul 14 21:53:51 2015 UTC,"Counting tips and receiving orders is certainly considered work, and you should be scheduled to receive time to do it on the clock. It's called ""non-coverage time""; basically it means you are on the clock, just not actively serving customers. It show up on the schedule separately from your normal shift.   If your SM is asking you to punch out then stay behind... that is a problem. Never work for free. Contact your DM or PCC/Business Ethics if this is the case, and keep a record of ALL time you worked.   If it's just asking you to be the tips person/put away an order and you're given non-cov... then sure, go for it!"
starbucks,3d97kp,iwrestledasharkonce,5,Tue Jul 14 14:13:09 2015 UTC,"I'm a 2 month old green bean too, and only from a batch of 2 new hires, myself included. Starbucks is my first real job and the other new hire has made amazing progress, much more than I can say for myself. I can definitely feel the experience gap between us because my fellow green bean is amazing at bar while I'm still lacking. I want to believe that this feeling of being inadequate will dissolve over time with more experience and time.  I just have a concern, I don't know if all Starbucks stores does this, but I heard that after you get off training, you have a 3 month grace period where you allot time and experience, then after the 3 months your SM will assess whether or not they'll keep you? I'm feeling an impending doom each time I leave after my shift. I don't feel like I'm good at bar, being on reg most of the time, and even then, I ring up averagely. ((I realize I sound very unconfident, but)) I just don't want to get fired."
starbucks,3d97kp,bluebunge,3,Tue Jul 14 14:59:31 2015 UTC,"When steaming milk try pulling the pitcher down very slowly.  It should help reduce the bubble bath effect.  Flat white's should get aerated far less than a cap.  I believe the card said 4-5 seconds.  Give the milk a swirl in the pitcher after steaming but before pouring.  Ask for bar time.  As a shift it often easy to play to the strengths of partners and put the most experienced baristas on bar, but it's not fair.  When a barista asks to be on bar I will find an appropriate time and offer either myself or another partner as a back up for help or questions.  Milk foam is an art, it takes practice.      As for certification, it should have taken place shortly after your training.  It's pretty easy.  They will ask you questions and watch you on bar.  Just a basic ""I retained my training"" test.  Hope I helped a bit."
starbucks,3d97kp,AthenaP,4,Tue Jul 14 16:23:27 2015 UTC,Okay so this better explains the flat white procedure! Swirling the milk is what makes it so you're not getting the dot until the end?
starbucks,3d97kp,grandypeakspalace,3,Tue Jul 14 20:07:41 2015 UTC,"It's cool that you want to get better! (BTW from another thread: I tried a chai with espresso today. It was alright.) I think I can help with a couple of things you mentioned that other posts haven't addressed yet.  Soy and nonfat bubble baths: sometimes it's just inevitable when you're whipping them out from necessity of DT times or whatever, but something that helps is aerating the milk so that it has a small, gentle paper ripply sound rather than a full-on tearing sound. If you have time to spare, try moving the wand around to where the bubbles are forming. That should help. Thumping the pitcher on the counter then swirling it before you pour should help too.  Flat whites: the thing that gets you the dot is in the pour. Start the pour further away -- this will get the milk to dive under the crema of the espresso rather than breaking it through (which gives it the nice brown colour) -- then when you have a quarter of an inch (? I am bad with non-metric so I'm not actually sure that this is right) bring the pitcher in closer, which will get the white foam to stay on top.  Certified barista: it's a short little bar quiz you're supposed to do that is the 'official' end of training. Supposedly you get a pin, and supposedly it is in the system whether or not baristas have done it. Also for the trainer to get his/her trainer bonus that has to be completed. You might have seen in the other thread though, many many veteran baristas who are excellent at their jobs have never been certified. But if you'd like the pin there's no harm asking your SM about it.  Whipped cream: start from the outside edge of the cup then swirl inwards until you make a cute little mountain.  Tall in a venti: If you have time you can just pour some hot water into a tall cup then into a venti cup to see exactly where it comes up to, but since a tall is 12 oz and a venti is 20 oz, it should look like half an inch (again, don't trust me on the non-metric system but it sounds about right to me) more than half of the cup.  If you have any other questions I'm sure this sub is happy to answer them. A lot of this stuff is easier to figure out if you can watch someone else do it right, but it seems like from what you've said that the conditions at your store aren't ideal for that kind of thing. But also I'm sure that you are doing awesome. People who give a shit almost always do great."
starbucks,3d97kp,skimcortado,2,Tue Jul 14 20:58:16 2015 UTC,"I was hired at my Starbucks at the beginning of March. I, thankfully, am just naturally good at bar. There are quite a few fellow baristas who are not as good. I completely understand the idea that being on reg for a month is not helpful since you're losing all of that knowledge. If your store uses playbook, you should be able to slide over to bar from register. If it's very slow, ask the barista on duty if you can jump in while they restock. If they're not cool with that (or your shift doesn't allow it), ask them to coach you from the bar. If they get a drink (say, a grande white chocolate mocha) ask them to ask you how to make it. So as they're making it, you can call out ""grande hot cup, 2% to the grande line- steam for 3-4 seconds, queue your shots (2), pump four pumps of white chocolate, add shots to cup, pour steamed milk and a dollop of foam but leave a 1/4 inch for whip cream, top and hand off. Doing this will help make sure you are actually aware of the ingredients and the sequencing. Then, after you feel comfortable doing this, hop on bar! You got this!  This is a method that I'm using with my fellow partners. A lot of them are stuck on reg and they are very eager to learn, and I have the tools to help them, so why not? Just talk to whoever is on bar during your shifts and ask if they're willing to help you out. At home, study the recipe cards and quiz yourself on pumps and shots for each drink size, and hot or cold. Barring is a great skill to learn and will help you in all of your future jobs as well. Let me know if you have any more questions!"
starbucks,3d97kp,sophia_jpeg,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:21:44 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty comfortable with bar as far as X pumps of Y syrup in a drink, it's more of ""feel"" stuff (like proper milk steaming) that's a bit harder to get right by just looking at a recipe card."
starbucks,3d97kp,grandypeakspalace,5,Tue Jul 14 16:10:25 2015 UTC,"The way I learned was by making 10 practice drinks. It was wasteful, yes, but I learned very quickly. I start with the wand inside of the pitcher, pull the lever down, and very slowly, pull the pitcher down (the wand will be at an angle) until you don't hear that screeching sound) put it back in and up right, that's for a latte. The screeching will stop when the milk is around 80 degrees and it usually makes for the perfect amount of foam.   With a cappuccino, I fill the pitcher to the line below the size I'm making (i.e. Grande cappuccino gets milk to the tall line) and while pulling slowly, watch the temperature, at around 100 degrees, you should have made foam going up to the max line, and then put it back sitting upright until it's finished.   I'm on a ten so this may not make the best sense but ask further and I'll be back in a bit!"

I'm in a corporate store and I've never heard of refusing someone water if they haven't paid, so I'd assume as long as it's not a trenta, it's no big deal.

starbucks,3d8b8t,just_moira,5,Tue Jul 14 19:06:28 2015 UTC,"It's a cup. It barely costs anything in labour or materials. Also whenever you get annoyed about giving someone free water think about how much excess coffee you dump down the sink daily.   As far as water pizza combo, you can ask them to leave. You can tell anyone to get out of your store if you want. Even paying customers and you don't have to have any reason besides it's our store. That being said, telling people to leave for no reason typically doesn't work in your favour. So when you go to tell pizza boy to leave just think about if it is worth the complaint to home office. If it bothers you that much and it's worth them making a formal complaint (not that they will for certain but it's always how I like to think about it) then kick em out!"

I also think that non-paying customers only getting free water should have to wait for the drinks ahead of them to be passed out and it drives me crazy when the POS barista will break away to immediately make a tall iced water for someone (unless they're a nice regular then yeah- but those people usually pay and tip).

You have to remember that both companies are ebay owned. Ebay only cares about VERO members ans buyers. Sellers are the scum to them."

starbucks,3d6zj5,Catlore,9,Tue Jul 14 00:35:16 2015 UTC,Too bad everyone at my store aerates their fucking flat whites for too long and I end up being handed a cup of bubbly shit everytime I'm on DT. But hey what the fuck do I know.   I stopped trying to coach a long time ago. Try a triple short flat white with one raw sugar if you ever get the chance. The ideal espresso to milk ratio. Creamy heaven that might make you cream your pants. Shit will change your life.
starbucks,3d6zj5,DxC17,2,Tue Jul 14 03:58:26 2015 UTC,"That seems to be the most common problem with flat whites, people aerating it too long. Drives me insane. There's maybe three people (myself included) at my store that can make it right."
starbucks,3d6zj5,austinbucco,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:10:14 2015 UTC,I heard my shift describe the flat white as having more foam than a latte and slightly less than a cappuccino the other day. This is of course the same shift who pulls shots directly into caramel macchiattos and thinks that espresso macchiattos are  short cups filled with steamed milk with shots pulled over top. how can I recommend drinks to customers when my coworkers don't make them consistent or correct?
starbucks,3d6zj5,PaleIsTheNewBlack,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:00:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah when I describe the foam on flat whites, the words ""more"" and ""less"" aren't included in the description.

starbucks,3d6zj5,austinbucco,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:08:44 2015 UTC,"Honestly my store isn't even high volume, its just got some people who don't know recipes and yet for some reason are in charge. How can you work here for so long and be so wrong? My store manager asks everyone who orders an espresso macchiatto what size cup they would like it in. Wtf? I just don't understand."
starbucks,3d6zj5,PaleIsTheNewBlack,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:12:27 2015 UTC,"Partners at my store seem to be doing a pretty solid job but, being a green bean, I must say that there is very little information given on just how a flat white is supposed to be and how it is supposed to be made.   If I hadn't already been getting into them before starting I'd probably be making them just like my lattes. I'm not quite upset but it's just a bit disappointing to know how many people (customers and partners) are likely being mislead and confused by the inaccuracy or inconsistency of Starbucks flat whites."
starbucks,3d6zj5,Kelsomatic,4,Sun Jul 19 09:08:21 2015 UTC,"I love making flat whites when they aren't modified beyond maybe a few sugar in the raw.  I always take extra care when I make them, do latte art on top...whole milk is just a pleasure to work with :)"

starbucks,3d6avz,bean-juice,6,Mon Jul 13 23:08:38 2015 UTC,"What an odd woman.   The storing of the till bags in her purse is definitely a big no-no. She could be accused of stealing money as a result of that (if that's not already happening, hopefully not).   As for doing closes alone, that's happened in some very extreme emergency situations (based on stories I've heard in the past), but if she's purposely doing them alone on a regular basis and bragging about it . . . I'll repeat my earlier statement, what an odd woman."
starbucks,3d6avz,UzukiCheverie,3,Mon Jul 13 22:30:03 2015 UTC,Best one I've seen is the mid shift dropped a till bag into the tip bag And proceeded to blame every shift from the day before.

starbucks,3d6avz,circaz454,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:34:35 2015 UTC,"There is no reason for till drop bags to be in someone's purse. That is a MAJOR cash handling violation.

starbucks,3d3zzb,aznninjaa,28,Mon Jul 13 09:58:03 2015 UTC,"So I'm 4 months in to being a part of Starbucks and I can see the morale problems immediately and they're everything you listed. As a Green Bean how can I see it and corporate can't?    I can't take the DT expectations, I just can't. That's the most maddening thing to me. Second to unrealistic DT expectations is bending over backwards to asshole customers. Starbucks is breeding these people by this ""Just Say Yes"" garbage. Listen, I am a Customer Service veteran, I know how to keep customers happy and I know how the game works. People need to be told NO when they're being unreasonable and straight up crazy. If you lose the crazy's business, guess what? The regulars and the loyal customers who are not crazy will make up for the loss of the nut jobs. You know what WON'T make up for the loss of the nut jobs? This concept of becoming the McDonald's of coffee with getting people in and out as fast as possible and having customer connections fall by the wayside. Sure, you're still telling us to connect with customers but the pressure of fast DT times, making no mistakes and placating the crazy people who will call corporate over a missed espresso shot make it impossible. We're too frightened with not making numbers or getting berated by jerks to truly connect anymore.    C'mon Starbucks, you gotta turn this ship around."
starbucks,3d3zzb,alexeye,11,Mon Jul 13 13:00:36 2015 UTC,"The reason you can see it and corporate can't is because corporate doesn't have to put up with the bullshit that green beans - as well as veteran workers - have to put up with every single day. It's easy to bark orders at others, come up with new ideas that on paper, you think work, and essentially tell others how to do their jobs the way you think it's easy to do.   But it's all easier said than done; actually doing the things they're telling us to do can be near impossible, and when you've got the labor cutbacks on top of that, leading to stores being constantly understaffed, even during peak, you're basically asking a dog to do a horse's work (I dunno lol I wanted to come up with some kind of clever metaphor). It's trying to satisfy a company that just can't stop asking for more and aren't willing to properly compensate us in return for all the work we do for them and all the money we pull in for them (yet they think that free drinks on our shifts and a bag of coffee a week pays for our rent and living expenses).   As any big business goes, Starbucks needs its employees to actually make money, money that we pull in by the thousands every day. They mistreat the employees, eventually a fire will be lit, and the company will go down. Hopefully they figure this out before it actually happens, but that's if some competent people who have actually worked the bar in modern day Starbucks world - with Playbook, pressure from DT times, and all the bullshit in between - will step into command."
starbucks,3d3zzb,UzukiCheverie,10,Mon Jul 13 17:44:34 2015 UTC,"Yep I totally agree 100%. I came from a company that seemed to employ people solely to come up with initiatives and reports for us to do on top of our regular jobs. They had no concept of what it was actually like to work in the field and deal with our clients; they lived in this fantasy land of clients just opening their wallets to us without any question or second thought.    I think RMs and all other higher-ups need to visit a store in plain clothes, unannounced and hang out to see what the stores really look like instead of the facade the SMs put on for them. See who are customers really are and who you're catering to instead of your actual workers. They may even be surprised that our stores aren't fully staffed nor does every job have a person like they're led to believe on their visits. They won't like it and perhaps then some changes will be made. But then again, if they truly believe the dog and pony show (hehe) that we put on during their visit there will be no meaningful change, ever."
starbucks,3d3zzb,alexeye,6,Mon Jul 13 19:03:15 2015 UTC,I don't put on a facade for anyone. The stress and the pressure are not just for baristas to feel. We all feel it.
starbucks,3d3zzb,badgebunny219,6,Mon Jul 13 19:13:00 2015 UTC,"If you're an SM, I'm not implying you don't feel pressure. I commented that way because we recently had a visit from the higher-ups and our store was fully staffed, everyone covered their jobs with no issue, in fact we were looking for stuff to do so we could stay busy. That's not how our store usually runs so perhaps they don't see a problem because we make sure they don't see a problem."
starbucks,3d3zzb,alexeye,6,Mon Jul 13 19:25:52 2015 UTC,"I am an SM but I didn't take any implications personally. I was more or less trying to say that I refuse to participate in the dog and pony show. It only leads to more unrealistic expectations and I personally am tired of the bullshit nasty-gram emails I get because a neighboring DM visited during peak on our highest volume day, where we performed 13% over last year, and was shocked that the store wasn't in perfect condition. With (3%) in labor being the new zero. Every store visit or district meeting I get thrown some new remedial ""2 min"" task by someone who has never done my job or your job and is completely out-of-touch with what it truly looks and feels like to be in a retail store. Also my store is a mallbux so I'm in my own personal kind of hell anyway lol."
starbucks,3d3zzb,badgebunny219,3,Mon Jul 13 21:11:58 2015 UTC,Good on you for taking a stand and refusing to participate in the dog-and-pony show. That's the only way that change will ever happen.

They're trying so hard to regulate and almost automate a job that's done by actual human beings that will make innocent mistakes from time to time, like forgetting that extra shot or accidentally steaming 2% instead of soy. They're forcing us to be ashamed for our mistakes instead of embracing said mistakes and actually teaching us to do better.  We're not perfect little robots, Starbucks. The sooner you all realize that, the sooner we can start taking actual strides in bettering the work environment - that doesn't involve showering our unsuspecting and almost naive green beans in free stuff to win them over - and get this company back on track that's for the people and about the people."

Honestly, I'm not gonna deny the fact that barista work won't be completely automated in the near or far future. Starbucks is trying so hard to automate us though, while still keeping our human side in there by trying to get us to connect in 30 seconds or less, that I sometimes ask myself, ""What's the point?"" They have human workers right now. If they want robots, they can surely phase in robots over the next several years. But expecting the humans to do work so accurate to satisfy their insane expectations that we may as well be robots . . . just not cool, and some of those crazy expectations still can't be met with a robot (like their unrealistic expectations of selling more and more food each week, despite it having a reasonable average cap; robots probably won't even ever be good enough for Starbucks lol).   I'd rather lose my minimum wage job to a robot than be treated like a robot for a job that's no longer worth the minimum wage because of it, TBH. /fuck yeah fight the machine lol"

Yeah, I'm still pissed about that and I have more or less given up on our bullshit corporate culture since then. The benefits are nice, but I don't qualify for one of the best opportunities (ASU) and giving us free Spotify and a fattening pastry isn't going to make up for the fact that I can't afford the cost of living. Plus they cut our 401(k) match despite increased profits and a stock split. Tell me again how you care so much about your ""partners"" Uncle Howie."
starbucks,3d3zzb,isaidnofoam,15,Mon Jul 13 13:26:20 2015 UTC,I agree with you about the wage. I would gladly give up my free drinks and food and I'd even give up my weekly coffee mark-out for a living wage. I want to and I like putting in a solid day's work but I am soon finding out that $8.40/hr isn't covering it compared to what we employees make the company. I guess since it's .90 above local minimum wage I should be thankful for their generosity.
starbucks,3d3zzb,alexeye,6,Mon Jul 13 14:48:48 2015 UTC,"Raise?  What raise?  I started in November and got my ""raise"" like everyone else - to the new starting wage at my store.

I am going to be the voice of my old family and go to the regional office. They are unable to speak up for fear of losing their job, the worst they can do is  put me on the Do Not Hire list.   I worked hard for two solid years into this company. I put blood, sweat and tears to make the customer experience the best I could. When I started the company was doing pretty good, everyone was stressed but we were focused. Then the DT timer came in, then the ridiculous time standard was enforced. We adapted and overcame, we rocked it. Next was to push the verismo machine, and I crushed it, we sold 8 between November and December. Corporate wanted more and more, they didn't want the customer connection to exist, they wanted higher numbers and more customers in and out. It led to my burn out, and I left the company. In one year the company has gotten a lot worse, it's no longer the company I remember.   Sorry for the rant guys."

I worked full time so I received the benefits, we only had one part time partner there. The job I am at now has better benefits, that start on day 1.

starbucks,3d3zzb,mrcaptncrunch,6,Tue Jul 14 01:40:03 2015 UTC,"I worked at Starbucks 9 years ago for less than a year, but my girlfriend at the time worked there for two and a half.  We both went to work at Starbucks because we liked the company and the people. My girlfriend started before me. When I decided, I want to do it, I called the DM and talked to him on the phone. He told me to go in the next day to another store where he was going to be and the next day I was in training.  Now a days, it's different. We still go to Starbucks, but I think it's more because of what we remember the company being.   We've moved since then. We now have 5 Starbucks near us (not counting licensed stores because I don't know how many there are). I have to drive a bit but there are about 5 local coffee shops. EVERY TIME we go to Starbucks, we end up disappointed.    Order a french press? They don't know how to do it and keep pouring it on a venti cup. I hate it. Give me the french press like you're supposed to and cups. ಠ_ಠ Casually mentioned it to the manager to see if something's changed since I was there. No. So I mentioned what was happening. Nothing happened.  Anything that's not a Frappucino or a standard beverage? A lot don't know how to do it. Apparently a Doppio Espresso Macchiato is a short latte. Food? The oven just keeps beeping and beeping... so it usually ends up burnt.   I've brought all of this with each of the stores managers... Nothing's changed. I once decided to reach customer service because I was pissed. They confirmed what I knew. She said she would contact the store and pass on the notes.  NOTHING HAS CHANGED  Every time my wife and I go we end up disappointed. We know Starbucks, we know the company values and we agree with them. But it all seems to be going down the drain.  We now simply go out of our way to go to the local coffee shops in the area...        Kind of a rant huh... sorry"

I get to travel a bit during the year (mostly Puerto Rico, Maryland, DC, NY, Massachusetts, California, Florida) and I usually end up going to Starbucks because it is usually ;) consistent. If I happen to be there for a couple of days, I start exploring local coffee shops (or if I know the area).  But there has been a decline in quality also over time. Either the training don't seem to be as good or something's changed.  I can see them moving from making giving everyone the Starbucks experience, and connecting with customers, to simply moving quantity of drinks.     We knew all the regulars and their drinks. If they only had one, usually by the time they where done in the POS, the drink was done.   We used to have events, get people from other stores, and everyone from the store and the regulars where taken out to different activities.  I remember going bowling, pool parties, BBQ's, beach with all the partners from the store, supervisor, manager and a couple of times the district manager came (he had a newborn at the time).  I was back there a couple weeks ago and asked them if they did anything as a store... No one had a clue of what I was talking...   *shrug* different times..."

I haven't had a company  budget for a party in years. And anytime I get communication  about putting together an event for partner morale it's clearly stated that there will not be a budget or an approved use of the p-card to support it.

So the barista just fills it up and makes a latte so they don't get yelled at again because the only thing worse than being a coffee robot for minimum wage is being told you're stupid by a stranger in front of a cafe full of people.... for minimum wage.

I've only been at this company for a year and already their expectations have grown only higher with no reward and if anything more punishment for not reaching their completely unrealistic expectations. The people from corporate just have no idea how much work it actually requires to run a successful store and that forcing sales down customer's throats while trying to cut our interaction time with them to 20 seconds is not viable to making genuine connections. The higher ups just have completely lost sight of what Starbucks is about but always preach to us about genuine connections and stuff but we're also somehow expected to do all this other shit while constantly being understaffed and overworked.

starbucks,3d7373,Ihatefrappuccinos,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:21:47 2015 UTC,"Thanks... That's what I thought, it seems like the SM is never in the store. He is always at another store or just gone..."
starbucks,3d7373,SnowWhiteinReality,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:36:40 2015 UTC,Is he at another store because your store is without an SM and he's dual-managing?
starbucks,3d7373,EspressoYoFeelingz,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:05:14 2015 UTC,As far as I know he is not dual managing.
starbucks,3d7373,Bean_Queen,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:07:06 2015 UTC,"Is it required for an SM to be IN-STORE 40 hours a week? My SM schedules himself 43+ a week, and only shows for maybe 10-15 hours a week. Doesn't want to speak one on one with any Baristas or his supervisory team and then leaves.  We haven't had a shift meeting since he started, as and no reviews have been given.   Reports have also gone ignored, was starting to think this was normal. Lol"
starbucks,3d7373,fueledbyink,3,Wed Jul 15 12:17:56 2015 UTC,"That's not really normal....  You might not get full shifts at the beginning, but they need to be 4-6 hours at least so you have the proper time to train.  8 hours can be a bit long and a lot of information to absorb."
starbucks,3d7373,tetsuo9000,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:07:26 2015 UTC,Yea... Thats what I thought. I guess I'll just try and talk to him calmly about it as I like him otherwise and he seems very reasonable.
starbucks,3d7373,badgebunny219,2,Tue Jul 14 04:37:29 2015 UTC,He might be the only barista trainer at the moment.  My spew went several months where the store manager was the only barista trainer.
starbucks,3d7373,SnowWhiteinReality,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:24:06 2015 UTC,"Ugh that is a nightmare scenario. In general though, there should be other barista trainers at the store. The computer training takes a little over an hour. Being limited to just a SM makes zero sense. If he's not at the store more than a few days a week he probably isn't going to last very long."
starbucks,3d7373,badgebunny219,2,Tue Jul 14 14:51:13 2015 UTC,If the SM has only been there for 3 weeks the store was probably needing to hire and also without any certified trainers.

starbucks,3d6p4i,BobHogan,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:47:24 2015 UTC,Nope. You are supposed to continue ordering milk chocolate until you run out of marshmallow syrup. Then once you run out of your last milk chocolate (and the last marshmallow) you can be done with smores
starbucks,3d6p4i,potterhead360,1 point,Tue Jul 14 08:05:40 2015 UTC,Yea I thought you stopped when out of milk chocolate. We ran out of graham ages ago and milk chocolate last week. We still have bottles and bottles of marshmallow tho

And learn to coach in a way that won't step on any toes.

starbucks,3d4blo,mrcaptncrunch,2,Tue Jul 14 04:42:01 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying they won't handle it correctly, but the motivation for a company to handle issues like these is not just solely for the purpose of helping out nor complying with the law. They also have the incentive of keeping the company safe.  edit  I've dealt with HR and have had a good outcome. My wife has dealt with HR (at another company) and has also had good results. They definitely help, I'm just trying to point out their incentives.  /edit     They're there to protect you, you being an asset to the company. So HR is there to serve the company. In order to follow the law, they need to comply with certain things. But when it's you or the company, they will side with the company.     OP wants what's right. She wants the person who assaulted her to be dealt with (how is not important right now).  Since the law sides with OP, she has a good reason for HR to work with her. If the person who assaulted her went to HR, HR should not side with him. Why? Because OP would have a case against the company not providing a safe place to work.   So HR should side with her to protect the company. It so happens that it's also the outcome we all want.     We've also seen and hears how cases like these have ended up with the company paying off someone in return for them signing a document that states that they won't talk about it, sue the company nor the people involved, etc. In this case, HR took the wrong side. But they did so because it's what's best for the company."

Same thing with HR. HR will try to prevent it going to court because it will cost the company money and it can be bad press. How they do this? Usually by keeping you happy... But it's because it is beneficial for them, not just because it's the right thing.  :/  Go talk to a lawyer and see what they say. Based on that you can make an informed decision. :)     A good lawyer won't force you. They'll explain to you what's happening and your options.  One that's desperate for money will just push you to do it.     Get good advice and proceed from there. It will be okay. :)"
starbucks,3d4blo,mrcaptncrunch,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:43:05 2015 UTC,"Sorry, because you made a great point, but it's ""scape goat""  not ""escape goat"". Although escape goat provides very adorable imagery."

It can take a week or more to get back to you though. If you truly feel like you are being ignored, have you called the business and ethics hotline? The phone number can be found in the front of your cash management log."
starbucks,3d4blo,UzukiCheverie,8,Wed Jul 15 01:19:12 2015 UTC,"Get a fucking lawyer. The company will tell you otherwise, do NOT listen. PM me if you'd like more info, I may be able to help out here but don't want to risk a couple things."
starbucks,3d4blo,UzukiCheverie,2,Mon Jul 13 13:42:32 2015 UTC,I'm going to shoot you over a PM!
starbucks,3d4blo,EspressoYoFeelingz,5,Mon Jul 13 22:29:48 2015 UTC,"As everyone has said already, get a lawyer. It's clear the company has realized that this is an issue they can't solve with free $50 giftcards, and they've decided to make it worse by ignoring you and not responding properly to this. They're gonna try and stop you with all the reasons they can think of, but believe me, it's in their own interest, not yours (even if they try and get you to believe that it's yours). Get a lawyer to present your case and hit them where it hurts."
starbucks,3d4blo,danamul,2,Mon Jul 13 17:28:56 2015 UTC,"I just didn't think they would ignore me. The original incident has happened over 3 months ago, after they finally transferred me, they stopped responding to my calls (I called daily for two months. I'm not even exaggerating) entirely."
starbucks,3d4blo,adamrobertt,3,Mon Jul 13 22:31:57 2015 UTC,"Well, three months was more than enough time for them to respond, and way too much time you were forced to wait. Now's as good a time as any to start getting things in motion and start reminding the company why you waited 3 months on them in the first place. You played nice, they did not. Start trying to find a lawyer who will represent you and will help you build a solid, airtight case. If you don't start going through this process now, but really want to make your voice heard, eventually it's going to be too late. Don't put it off until tomorrow, don't convince yourself that they're going to get back into contact with you, because even if they do, they'll have already tarnished themselves as a company in your eyes from not being so responsive in the first place, especially with a case as serious as sexual harassment.   The longer you wait to do this, the more you'll regret you didn't do it earlier.   Good luck."
starbucks,3d4blo,Bean_Queen,2,Mon Jul 13 22:42:35 2015 UTC,"I don't know WHY this comment was down voted, but this statement is very true.

starbucks,3d4blo,Bean_Queen,2,Tue Jul 14 00:05:05 2015 UTC,"No, I was originally told he would be fired. Two days later, they tell me, ""We are keeping him, but we're going to transfer you out."" Two and a half weeks later of NO working at ALL, I call my DM. He said, ""Oh, sorry, SM must have forgot the paperwork. It'll go through today."" I get transferred. I go another week without pay because my first SM didn't transfer any of my paperwork for an additional week to my new SM."
starbucks,3d4blo,Ihatefrappuccinos,6,Mon Jul 13 23:01:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, there are federal laws about this stuff.  If PCC doesn't want to help, then you might have to play hardball."

starbucks,3d4blo,bitterbrew,6,Mon Jul 13 14:49:26 2015 UTC,"Absolutely get a lawyer.  If you had to miss work, they should be paying you for that time.  And frankly, your SM and DM should both be fired."
starbucks,3d4blo,danamul,2,Mon Jul 13 22:31:12 2015 UTC,My former SM/ current Dm are constantly doing stupid shit. I just didn't think something of this magnitude would be ignored.
starbucks,3d4blo,XOEVA,2,Mon Jul 13 21:16:25 2015 UTC,"I used to work for another major company for many years as an assistant manager, and have reported several instances of harassment/discrimination.  You better believe when I reported these things to HR, our consultant was in the restaurant within 24 hours, if not the same day.  I'm completely appalled at the way they've responded to you.  I think you should get a lawyer and let them communicate with starbucks on your behalf.  Its already traumatic enough experiencing assault, much less spending all your energy trying to get ahold of people in the company to do something about it."
starbucks,3d4blo,the1trueNyaZ,2,Mon Jul 13 22:32:33 2015 UTC,"I haven't even seen anyone from HR or Starbucks ever come into the store. It leads me to believe that an actual file was never even put into place. I was told by my SM that they ""contacted starbucks legal team"" and that they ""determined it wasn't grounds for termination on the male employee's behalf, so you're getting transferred instead."""
starbucks,3d4blo,brorista,2,Mon Jul 13 23:11:39 2015 UTC,"Yes, it sounds like neither your SM nor DM properly reported.  What you described is absolutely grounds for termination.  Instead they punished you.    Not sure how starbucks HR does things, but in my previous experience if an employee claims they were sexually harassed, HR comes in and takes statements... not just from the two people involved, but also from many others in the store.  There is a very thorough investigation process.    And we have cameras in the store, so its not even your word against theirs, we have PROOF.  And you have PROOF of text messages.  I'm so disgusted.  I really hope the reason they aren't handling this appropriately is because it wasn't reported.  But you contacted PCC...."
starbucks,3d4blo,SnowWhiteinReality,2,Tue Jul 14 00:07:13 2015 UTC,"I contacted PCC after both DM/SM failed to do, well, anything. And PCC was responsive for like, a week or two. Then they just started ignoring me entirely."
starbucks,3d4blo,brorista,2,Tue Jul 14 00:13:13 2015 UTC,"Im just floored...  I know someone suggested that the company is using the time to build a case against you.  I don't think that's the case.  If they handled the case appropriately...fired the partner who assaulted you, gave you paid time off during the investigation, etc, they wouldn't need to build a case.   Its even worse for them that on top of everything that happened, they punished YOU for it.  Definitely get that lawyer."
starbucks,3d4blo,the1trueNyaZ,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:19:27 2015 UTC,"I just don't know what they're doing or what. If they would contact me back and help me out, none of this would be as big as an issue as it is now. The fact that they're blowing me off is making it difficult and I feel like I got punished for doing the right thing (reporting it appropriately) and I got screwed over in the end."
starbucks,3d4e03,SPEAKERNiGHT,19,Mon Jul 13 12:50:13 2015 UTC,It's for pour-overs! We've only used the lines for the hot beverages but it measures out the amount of hot water to be used when using the pour-over coffee drip system.

Over the summer we never brew decaf, and usually cut our blonde roast, so we have to do a lot of pour overs.. it annoyed me at first but now it's just routine."
starbucks,3d4e03,Nahalawon,2,Mon Jul 13 16:53:24 2015 UTC,"Lol I got down voted for bad mouthing pour overs, I suppose a particular customer who only orders them saw my post XD"
starbucks,3d4e03,spudwinkle,4,Mon Jul 13 17:46:31 2015 UTC,"I have one of those regulars, he always asks for a pour over even if we have it on brew and insists that he's got all the time in the world to wait for them and that we should take our time and then we call his drink out he never comes and half the time returns it because it's cold or doesn't taste right. When he forgets his personal mug he insists on getting the discount on our for here mugs."
starbucks,3d4e03,alysurr,2,Mon Jul 13 18:05:13 2015 UTC,We had a customer like that at my old store. He would have us open a new bag of coffee for a pour over everyday and then eyeball you as you made it. One day he reached over to stir it and I just about lost my shit. He also used to complain about me because I stuck to the refill policy. Such a dick.
starbucks,3d4e03,obsessioncalled,2,Mon Jul 13 23:16:25 2015 UTC,at least you don't have people specifically ask for you to do it....
starbucks,3d4e03,tenachiasaca,14,Tue Jul 14 04:04:32 2015 UTC,"It's called a gooseneck. They're used for pour overs (used instead of the plexiglass, measuring cup with ""S"", ""T"",""G"", and ""V"" marked on the side). The reason this is superior to the plexiglass cup is because the water is poured at a constant controlled rate from the bottom of the pitcher. This causes the grounds to be more evenly saturated when doing the pour over. Also, this has the measurements for not only the hot pour overs, but also the iced ones. I've made some great iced coffee pour overs for customers and myself using this. :) Source: I'm a coffee master. Pro tip- When you start a pour over, make sure to wet the filter before adding coffee. It (1) helps the filter not break and (2) removes the papery taste that can be in a pourover."
starbucks,3d4e03,JoshuaMaly,6,Mon Jul 13 16:41:04 2015 UTC,"When you start a pour over, make sure to wet the filter before adding coffee.

starbucks,3d4e03,UzukiCheverie,4,Mon Jul 13 17:31:09 2015 UTC,It's for pour overs! And it has the lines for making custom iced teas and coffees
starbucks,3d4e03,fitness_lover,3,Mon Jul 13 13:14:45 2015 UTC,"On the inside with the closer together lines we use them for making iced teas (from tea bags). you concentrate the tea in a hot cup and pour it over ice and add water!  Otherwise its used for pour over coffee!  Add water to the line and a little bit more:   Set up your pour over station (I set mine with 2 filters) Grind the coffee on paper (3, 4, 5 scoops for sizing respectively) Wet the filters and let it just drip into the pan, after filter is wet put in coffee, and cup under the drip Wet all the coffee grounds and let it bloom (stand) for 30 seconds. Slowly pour the rest of the water wetting all of the grounds being careful to not stop the water flow!   We use this a lot in my store since we only brew pike and we have a clover. Hope this was helpful!"
starbucks,3d4e03,jasminehulse,3,Mon Jul 13 18:58:07 2015 UTC,"One thing the coffee masters in my district have determined, is that even though all the communications say to grind it for paper cone, that was too fine and caused many pour-overs to go into the 5 minute range. Instead we grind it for flat bottom, and the pourovers are done closer to 3-4 minutes, which is ideal. Taste them side by side, the paper ground ones are super astringent and bitter from being over extracted, and dont taste good at all."
starbucks,3d4e03,slippery_when_wet,2,Tue Jul 14 00:44:59 2015 UTC,I thought they were going a little slow! Personally I thought it was because I used 2 filters but I'll try that instead! We get a lot of people asking for blonde pour overs and I wouldn't want that coming out astringent at all.

Plus, it's better in the long run to start a paper trail and keep Seattle aware of issues like this"
starbucks,3d4iue,signalizing,9,Mon Jul 13 17:00:25 2015 UTC,"Get some self-defense training, carry pepper spray and a retractable titanium baton. He starts going for you, let him have it.  Barring that, not leaving the store alone after close, and carrying a full sized carabiner to use as a knuckleduster is the simplest option.  Not to sound too pro-violence... I'm really not. I just know a lady who didn't take these sorts of things seriously enough and it ended poorly for her. My best advice is to make precautions for the worst case scenario, and to be vigilant.  Also, if you have the individual's information (from the incident report that banned him from your store) you can tell the police that he threatened you with bodily harm, he can get arrested in the best case scenario."
starbucks,3d4iue,nekoshonenbutler,5,Mon Jul 13 14:12:55 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the advice, I do need to start carrying some self defense, regardless of this situation.   Luckily I'm 6'1"" so I'm not exactly  tiny."
starbucks,3d4iue,adamrobertt,5,Mon Jul 13 14:32:05 2015 UTC,"You also don't have to have any compelling reason to ask him to leave, nor to call the cops.  Simply him being banned and ignoring it is enough.    Contrary to popular belief, Starbucks is not a public place.  It is a privately owned establishment that happens to be open to the public, under their conditions.  We reserve the right to ask anyone to leave at any time for any reason, unless that reason is discriminatory, of course."
starbucks,3d4iue,bean-juice,3,Mon Jul 13 14:53:14 2015 UTC,This^ We had to call the cops on this homeless woman who had been banned because she smelled like pee (like to the point that you could be in the back and know she had come into the store bc suddenly you smelled it and wanted to puke; almost threw up a couple times serving her.) but she kept trying to come in our store even after knowing she was banned.     Which also sucked because she was always polite and bought a lot of things and always paid. A lot of people have tried helping her but something just isn't all there =/
starbucks,3d4iue,nekoshonenbutler,2,Mon Jul 13 17:31:13 2015 UTC,"That does help, and will make most punks think twice, but if someone is serious, it wont change their minds."

starbucks,3d4iue,nekoshonenbutler,4,Mon Jul 13 19:27:44 2015 UTC,"As a person with minimal self-defense training, a ""weapon"" is anything I can pick up and use to hurt someone. The store itself has six or seven objects in it that qualify as a good ""weapon"", and I carry a Carabiner with a Lanyard that has my keys attached. I can use the Carabiner as a knuckle-duster, or with the Lanyard as a kind of flail. Either way, neither thing is a ""weapon"" but they would be effective as one in a self-defense scenario."

I'd look into pepperspray (but make sure your state allows it) or look on Amazon for the Safety Cat (again, check to make sure your state allows it!)"
starbucks,3d4iue,SaltyBarista,3,Mon Jul 13 14:52:23 2015 UTC,"Call the cops, have it documented by them. You also have witnesses. You can also take it a step further and press charges against him for assault. Petty and too 'Murica? Maybe, but I draw the line when you can be potentially harmed for simply doing a job like this. No one deserves shit like this, and anyone who violates that deserves the worst of what's coming to them."
starbucks,3d4iue,velogirl,3,Mon Jul 13 17:48:15 2015 UTC,"You've done the right thing with calling the cops. Beyond that, the best option is staying vigilant. Use the buddy system with your open/close partners, and carry your keys like a weapon."
starbucks,3d4iue,adamrobertt,2,Mon Jul 13 14:53:45 2015 UTC,"All you can really do is stand up to him.  Ask him to leave, reminding him that he's banned.  Don't fall for his taunts, he's probably just trying to piss you off.  Then call the cops.  Don't be afraid to call the cops, you won't get in trouble, trust me.   If you don't feel comfortable talking to him at all, then you should just call the cops every time you see him.  He'll get sick of it pretty quick, most likely, and stop showing up."

I was the only trainer at my old store and for some reason my brain dead manager said I wasn't entitled to tips (which was wrong). Now both the trainer and trainee get tips. It's nice for them. I dreaded training simply because it was a financial hardship. Training someone for 2 weeks means I missed out on nearly $100 per trainee. Over $800 I could have used when my car broke down....twice.

Plus our store sucks at finishing MyLearning (I've been here since April '14 and was FINALLY certified a few months ago) so we have very few ""certified"" baristas.

I used to work night shift at a place that catered to the drunk and stoned college crowd, open till 2am. We would play The Band's Last Waltz album every day. One night, I played Tenacious D (not the first time). Well, it was 1:30 in the morning. I was working with another guy and a girl, and we had a massive rush. The place is packed with frat boys and sorority girls. And, the entire place is singing along at the top of their lungs to ""Fuck her gently.""   Normal tips were between $10 and $20 a night. That night we all walked away with ninety-something dollars. But, the next day we got a complaint from the owner, and he took over the playlist.  TL;DR You have a good thing going. Don't mess it up by playing the wrong music."

Classic, but it just doesn't suit the typical Starbucks image if you play P.Y.T.  Also changes depending on time of day. During peak and afternoon, it's more upbeat to keep you going, but later on when it slows down, I'll switch to Jazz or folk."

I had a lady who claimed to have worked at Starbucks come in with SEVENTEEN MODIFIERS. It's been long enough that my brain finally was able to block most of them out but insert your  ""1/2 pump sugarfee vanilla, 1/4 pump hazelnut, put whipped cream on the bottom of the cup"" bullshit as you like.  As the barista began making it she STARED at him through every step, shouted intructions at him and overall acted like a nightmare. Even other, seated customers were staring at her because she was so loud.   Finally He hands her the drink, she takes a sip so small, possible three molecules of drink entered her mouth and goes ""No! This is all wrong! I need it remade! - insert diatribe about how stupid me and the other barista are here -""  At this point my barista takes off his apron, does the good 'ol Hollywood ""I QUIT!"" and runs out of the building to find a cigarette and I'm just waiting for the camera crew to pop out and tell me I'm being punked. But then the lady started coming at me with her verbal abuse.  I had to threathen to call the cops to make her leave. Even giving her back her refund was an ordeal because she didn't want to take it, she just wanted to continue verbally abusing me. Finally a group of people came in and she tried to get them involved in berating me somehow and the guy was just like ""Um...I'm here to get coffee, are you done?"" And thank goodness THAT made her leave!  And wouldn't you know it, the very next day, we both had complaints from her. (Thankfully my coworker un-quit. I know customer-service jobs might not be ideal for people with anxiety but NO ONE should be making a barista feel so bad to the point where they're almost having an anxiety attack! So long as human beings behave decently, he's fine.)  Sorry this got so long!  Oh, neither of us got written up and that lady got banned because I guess she made some physical threats about us like 'punching our ugly faces the next time??' We were told to call the shopping center security if she showed up but she never came back (at least not while I was there.)  I really wonder though... Somewhere out there... Is there a barista who is actually getting her 17-mod drink right??"

I work at a drive thru only store.  some old cow came in and ordered a hot tea with steamed coconut milk. I asked her what kind of tea she wanted because she didn't specify. When I told her we were out of the tea she wanted she starts screaming ""IF YOU DON'T HAVE WHAT I WANT WHY DID YOU EVEN ASK!!!"" them she settles for a tea I had. When I ring it up ad a tea latte she freaks out again. Telling me I'm ripping her off, that she has never been charged that much. Then she asked to speak to the manager it was a Sunday evening, in fact it was father's day so manager was home with his family. But I'm a shift so I told her I was the acting manager. When came to the window She said I was inexperienced, that her son works for Starbucks and she has never been treated like that at his store. That killed me I told her ""I don't know how you act at his store but  I do t appreciate your attitude and the way you've been speaking to my partners. I will give the drink for free, like I've been trying to the past ten minutes. Here is my manager's personal phone number you can call him with your complaint. Now if don't leave I will have no other choice but to call the police"" that finally got rid of her but her antics backed up everything and caused the line and the wait time to become ridiculously long."

starbucks,3d1evq,VAPossum,-7,Mon Jul 13 00:55:04 2015 UTC,"First of all, '89, I'm older than you, kid.  Secondly, you're making a straw man argument here so no you shouldn't do that. You should be telling OP to defend themselves as a consumer and demand their free drink - a refill. If the Barista is ringing up $1.50 charges on the register but the till is short their store manager is going to see that on the sales reports.   Instead, you're telling OP to be OK with being possibly ripped off by simply reporting it. This is tantamount to telling the store manager they don't know how to do their job. I bet you enjoy people doing that to you... Not! OP has no proof anything shady is happening, other than perception."
starbucks,3d1evq,stoopidyoshi,-9,Mon Jul 13 01:30:46 2015 UTC,"So, you're not a barista? Do you even have a connection to Starbucks other than as a consumer? I'm guessing not (and I hope I'm wrong) because then your opinion isn't as relevant as it should be in this argument.  For all the OP knows the barista could've been refilling the tip jar from being short on the till from last count. Hell, their manager could've even told them to do it. Meanwhile, you're telling this person to report their suspicion. Which is fine except if OP is wrong they're going to look like a paranoid ass clown and gets nothing out of it.  Let's say I'm wrong and you're right. The store manager looks at sale reports - or should, as per protocol - on a daily basis. If this wasn't a condoned practice and they aren't noticing a jump in sales from perhaps a shady practice then they're the negligent ones. They're obviously not watching this employee closely, so the worst that would happen is a slap on the wrist. The store manager isn't going to officially report it up, because then they'll look completely negligent to their boss, the DM.   Whereas the consumer could take matters into their own hands. Say OP outsmarts the shady practitioner by demanding a free refill because it's the right thing to do. Then says they should report the barista to their manager. Thus OP gets a free refill out of it (the right thing), barista looks dumb and will likely stop the behavior because of the fear of being reported. But instead the OP did nothing and the possibly shady practice continues...   Tl;dr: Outsmart a possible consumer offense by being smarter than the offender at their own game. It's not ""extortion"" if the $1.50 isn't supposed to be charged if asking for a free refill."
starbucks,3d1evq,VAPossum,7,Mon Jul 13 01:03:57 2015 UTC,"I don't need to be a barista to know that extorting a thief for your own gain (and possibly at expense of others, since they do nothing to make the practice stop), in lieu of turning them in, is the wrong thing to do.   It's better that he say nothing than that."

Who's taking orders from the RM, and so forth. A lot of times these sort of weird oxymoronic demands come from higher ups who don't understand the struggles of producing quality in an unrealistic amount of time."

I'd be fine if it was just the SM being unreasonable because then some kind of action could be taken, but the fact that it's coming from higher and higher-up just goes to show that the company probably needs to reevaluate their goals and methods to achieving said goals that don't involve torturing their partners over things like DT times that are only a few seconds off. And get some less delusional people in office who have actually worked as baristas and know the pain they're putting us through."

starbucks,3d2k4p,jazzlikescats,5,Mon Jul 13 02:23:44 2015 UTC,"I actually got into a screaming match with my manager once over DT times. She wanted them all to be under 45 seconds. Well this one transaction was almost 6 minutes.   This customer ordered over $150 worth of stuff. 20 lattes, 10 fraps, and a metric fuck ton of food. Like a ridiculous amount of stuff. It took us 5 minutes to even take her order, let alone prep all that crap. I asked the lady to pull up but she said no because ""she didn't want us to forget about her, and wanted her drinks to be made first"". So she sat at the window, ruining the hell out of our time.   And of course we all got in trouble for having such bad DT times. I told the SM too bad, there was literally nothing we could do faster. Every barista was helping, it would've been inhumanly to prep all that in under two minutes even! But no, she said we should've done it somehow.   Fuck these DT times. ""Make a personal connection! But get them out of here in under 30 seconds!""  Pick one! You can't have a personal connection in 30 seconds!!   /rant"
starbucks,3d2k4p,UzukiCheverie,2,Mon Jul 13 04:19:27 2015 UTC,"Oh my fuck don't even lol I've never had it THAT bad (bless your soul) but it definitely annoys me when those big orders just throw your DT times for a through-the-roof loop, and then management blames you for just not trying hard enough. Like, fuck right off, you weren't the one who had to deal with that shit (this especially goes for upper management).  I don't know why a company like Starbucks - which serves specialty, handcrafted drinks - expects us to always be making DT times equivalent with that of Tim Horton's. I mean, yeah, Tim's has the whole issue of having to actually make the sandwiches by hand, but at least for the most part they're adequately staffed and don't have to worry so much about labor cutbacks (although this is just from the stores I've seen and are accustomed to).   They work to be very fast drive-thru stores; Starbucks works as a DT store, but upper management has to understand that 30 seconds or less is not a good bar to set and is driving all our partners batty from the abuse. It has different standards, different method, so it shouldn't be trying to achieve the same goals, and should be adjusting those goals accordingly to our menu and prep and clientelle. That's why it pisses me off so much when managers get mouthy with us when our times happen to go over a minute (the customer isn't going to explode). Sometimes it really isn't our fault and we just have to move on to get those times back down, instead of sitting around blaming each other for it."
starbucks,3d2k4p,alexeye,2,Mon Jul 13 12:37:13 2015 UTC,"Sometimes it's the customer's ""fault"", or in this case, the order they made that clogged up the system. There is literally nothing you could have done about that. That sucks."
starbucks,3d2k4p,Bellacide,3,Mon Jul 13 13:05:17 2015 UTC,"You hit the nail on the head - sometimes it is the customer's fault. For example: Uh, I said ICED. What if it's innocent like someone asking about the MSR program? Or other drink questions? I had a gold card holder that wasn't earning her rewards and so I explained how she needed to call Sbux to get that fixed and she had some questions so her window time was extended - what are you going to punish me for? Speaking to a customer about your rewards program? You cannot have lightning drive times AND a genuine customer experience, you get one, not both."
starbucks,3d2k4p,potterhead360,2,Mon Jul 13 15:09:07 2015 UTC,"Drive-thru times have made me break down in the BOH plenty of times, and question my abilities as a shift often.

starbucks,3d2k4p,mstrandquist8,1 point,Mon Jul 13 10:07:48 2015 UTC,"DT times are completely unrealistic, seeing as how it should take 17-23 seconds for your shots to pour. So it should only take 7 more seconds for you to assemble the drink, get it to handoff, and for DTW to get it out the window. That's a joke corporate. The people who make these rules have probably never stepped foot behind the line, so they have no idea how a store actually operates"

We don't have someone written in to the schedule to do tips. It gets done when it gets done. We do have a designated person(s) who do them though. Both are shifts, and the latest we get them is Wednesday. And usually, that's bc one or both of them gets sick and can't do it. Or we just don't get the time while they're here to do it.   But if one of them does them in a day off or after a shift, they are definitely paid for that time."
starbucks,3d2piw,DaBucks,2,Mon Jul 13 01:42:06 2015 UTC,"Take it to your DM. While not scheduling is more or less an annoyance, forcing the tip person to not clock in is against Sbux policy.

I don't personally recall any mention of restrictions on ice ... I could be wrong though. I know I wouldn't care if someone ordered no ice. We ordered a second Toddy system so availability wouldn't be as much of an issue. If you got no ice at my store I wouldn't give you any trouble.

Thus, we have specific water to concentrate proportions that we use to make it taste so good (and preserve our stock to make sure we don't run out super fast). In which case I ask them if they would just like room at the top or extra water.   You can either say you're okay with extra water or having extra room to get your no ice. That barista was in the wrong for saying you couldn't get extra water. So long as you're good with it, it's kosher since it's not using extra concentrate to ""abuse"" the system. Ice coffee is super fast to make and not a limited thing, thus no ice isn't so much of an issue."

starbucks,3d2ad1,dark_moose09,3,Sun Jul 12 23:12:49 2015 UTC,"In my experience, your references (including your current employer) won't be contacted until AFTER your interview. The point of references is to corroborate or confirm the information you give in the interview, and give a different perspective on your performance. It would be WAY too much work for your potential employer to call up the references of every candidate they want to interview-- so instead they only call for people who've already shown promise in an interview situation.  Therefore, it's not bad form (or even that uncommon) to list your current employer and also specify that you prefer they not be contacted. During the interview, you can explain your reasoning for making both choices (as you've done above), and the interviewer should let you know if that will be a problem, at which point you can reconsider your choice if necessary."

All of the Starbucks locations in the town where my university is located are NOT okay with allowing people to go home for Thanksgiving/Christmas/spring break as well as summer.

You are still supposed to go frap roast and then milk to the first line, along with the ice and the coffee/creme base, but two mocha pumps adds quite a lot to the frap. There will be leftover unless you don't fill the milk to the first line, in which case you are not making the frap correctly according to the recipe card. Fraps without syrup are the only ones that will not have leftover if you make them correctly, every other frap will have the leftover due to the syrup adding volume to the liquid."

So, first thing in the morning, two-day items get a sticker for the NEXT day (i.e. Monday morning, sticker for Tuesday EOD if pastries pulled the night before).  Recent changes mean we can use a 24-hour clock for midday pulls, so if you grab an extra out of the freezer, you can date it for (24 or 48, depending on shelf life) hours + thaw time. So, a two-day item with a 4 hour thaw time pulled at 10 am on Monday is good until 2 pm on Wednesday.  For longer-lasting items (7, 14, 30 etc. days), also remember that today counts as a day-- so a 7 day item opened on a Monday gets a sticker for Sunday, NOT Monday and DEFINITELY NOT Tuesday; the date you need to write in is today's date + 6 (So on the 2nd, date for the 8th, NOT the 9th)."

starbucks,3czuca,Sylaz,4,Mon Jul 13 10:06:35 2015 UTC,"At my store I date the pastries as a closer. The ones that I pull are marked for EOD two days from that day. So if I pulled on a Monday, I would date all the 2 days pastries for EOD Wednesday, to be thrown out/donated after close that night.  It gets a little trickier for things pulled mid day, and to be honest I'm not entirely sure how that's supposed to work lol."
starbucks,3czuca,Shallow-Believer,3,Sun Jul 12 09:44:55 2015 UTC,"Before 4pm if it's a one day it gets thrown out at the end of the night, if it's a two day it gets dated for the next day. So if you did a mid day pull of bnb on Monday it would get a Tuesday date dot, but if you pulled it after 4 it would get a Wednesday."
starbucks,3czuca,Galiphile,3,Sun Jul 12 15:46:26 2015 UTC,"Date, time, and label on EVERYTHING*.  Period.  Pastries that expire same day don't need to be date dotted in the case. This is a fairly recent change.   Generally speaking, if you pull pastries at night, they will expire 2 days latter. I.e. if you pull them Monday night, they expire Wednesday night.   In your example, if you mark a 2 day pastry July 1st in the morning, it will expire July 2nd at night (assuming it was pulled the night before as we do).   *If the container is labeled, you don't need the label, just the date and time."

starbucks,3czq4d,loudandproudfag,4,Sun Jul 12 06:36:16 2015 UTC,"As long as there isn't a long line of drinks, or a long line behind you, feel free to ask us questions. (And even if there is a line, we probably have a quick explanation that we've used before with other customers.)   The Cold Brew is similar to an iced coffee. The difference is in how we make it. With an iced coffee, we brew it on our regular coffee brewers double strength, and then cut it with ice when we serve it to you. I would describe it as tasting bright, and slightly acidic. Cold Brew coffee is steeped for 20 hours in cold water. It produces a much smoother taste. Another difference (that I just learned today. Whoops.) is that iced coffee has a standard recipe that is sweetned, while Cold Brew does not come automatically sweetned.   My store doesn't have a pour over bar, but most stores are equiped with at least the ability to do so. It's a really basic form: there's a plastic basket, and this metal contraption that holds it over the cup. The Barista pours hot water over freshly ground beans. Four minutes later and you've got a individually brewed cup of joe.   You can put mango and peach in other teas.   If your individual store still has the refereshers in stock, you can still purchase them (until they run out/expire.)"

starbucks,3czq4d,SaltyBarista,3,Sun Jul 12 15:10:07 2015 UTC,"Cold brew is brewed coffee using cold or room temperature water only. The process takes a lot longer (our standard is 20 hours), but because the process is done cold rather than hot, you don't extract the compounds that you would only get doing conventional (hot) brewing methods, which get you a relatively smooth and sweet coffee. It is different from iced coffee in that iced coffee is brewed hot and then cooled down with ice.   You can think of pour over and ""manual brewing"". Rather than having a machine automatically distribute a predetermined amount of hot water over coffee grounds, you're using a kettle and pouring hot water over a filter and coffee grounds. Taste-wise, there is no meaningful difference. Pour-overs are usually for customers who want a specific roast of coffee that we have stopped brewing for the day.  Mango/peach can be added to anything you want so you can have mango in passion tea or green tea if you'd like. Though in my opinion, the ones on the menu are the best.  For the refreshers, technically no. Corporate has explicitly told us to get rid of whatever we have left so we should not be serving it anymore or even have it in our stores. Some stores still like to keep them (mine included) for whatever reason - whether partners still want to have some over time or reserved for special customers, but you can think of those refreshers as ""contraband"" now."

starbucks,3czq4d,Blipblipbloop,2,Sun Jul 12 15:10:12 2015 UTC,"Cold Brew:  Cold Brew is a new type of Iced Coffee that uses a different brewing method than traditional iced coffee.  Cold Brew Iced Coffee is slow-steeped for 20 hours in cool water before being served to customers (traditional Starbucks Iced Coffee is brewed hot and diluted with ice).  Time replaces heat in this brewing method.  The difference?  It is very smooth to drink, and super refreshing.  During a taste testing we did in my store, we all agreed the traditional iced coffee was super bitter tasting, compared to smooth, naturally sweet, tasting Cold Brew.  The Cold Brew iced coffee also has a higher caffeine content, and because of this, baristas will add water to your beverage, rather than just pouring your cup full (this is for health regulation reasons). The Cold Brew is served unsweeted (unlike the traditional iced coffee), but sweeteners can be requested for no additional charge.    You are able to request Peach and Mango flavor syrups to be added to any other tea beverage as a substitute at no additional charge.   I'm not familiar with a Pour-Over Bar as my store does not have one. A Pour Over is a single-cup brewing method where coffee grounds are placed in a cone and filter, similar to traditional drip brew, but is for a single-cup.   As for the refreshers, I'm not quite sure either.  The options are still on the POS, however my store is already out of the refreshers (as well as the Spiced Root Beer Fizzio beverage)..... Someone else will advise.   Please advise if any of this information is incorrect. :D  Thanks! Hope this cleared up some of your questions."

I'm a fairly new barista too and what I was taught to check if my cappuccino is done right is to make the cappuccino and then directly pour it into a cold tall cup.

starbucks,3cy412,unicorntimelord,19,Sat Jul 11 20:46:47 2015 UTC,"I don't understand the barista animosity to iced flat whites.   Yes it is a real drink. It is simply an iced latte with an extra shot, ristretto shots and whole milk.   It's an easier way to order an iced latte with all those modifiers and it is quite tasty as well. If I want an iced latte as my partner bev I'll usually order an iced flat white as well. Because I usually get extra shot, whole milk and ristretto anyway.  It doesn't defeat the purpose of anything at all, because the purpose of all of our drinks is to make the customer happy."
starbucks,3cy412,haydenj96,10,Sat Jul 11 21:28:29 2015 UTC,"Iced flat whites are stupid because the entire point of the flat white is the dense, velvety microfoam. Since there is no foam on the iced version, it's just an iced latte with whole milk and extra ristretto shots, which is already a thing. It's called an iced latte.   I think Starbucks just added the iced flat white recipe cards for consistency and continuity."
starbucks,3cy412,adamrobertt,-4,Sun Jul 12 00:10:31 2015 UTC,"the entire point of the flat white is the dense, velvety microfoam   That sounds more like a nice cappuccino to me. Flat whites should have little to no foam.  Edit in response to the downvotes: The problem I take with the statement is that other drinks should have microfoam too, and a cappuccino is more about the foam. A flat white should have less foam than a latte, hence ""flat"" with little to no foam. I guess you've been told otherwise..."
starbucks,3cy412,tifucomments,-5,Sun Jul 12 06:41:24 2015 UTC,"Wait, it does get foam. Less than an iced cappuccino though I think.

starbucks,3cy412,sovexing,8,Sat Jul 11 20:57:21 2015 UTC,The milk to espresso ratio is different. Making it more espresso forward compared to an iced latte. When Starbucks introduced their version of the flat white there was a card for iced flat whites.

starbucks,3cypqb,JellyBean1023,16,Sun Jul 12 00:03:33 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure the reason people think it's a QASA violation is because when QASA comes you always makes sure the sinks are drained. The reason though is so that the inspector will not test the solution and therefore it's one less thing to fail on. This is what my SM told me when I was made QASA lead so I could be wrong.
starbucks,3cypqb,ThirdEyeCentre,2,Sun Jul 12 01:14:42 2015 UTC,This is what I've always done. If QASA comes in that sanitize sink will be tested. If it's empty we're kosher.
starbucks,3cypqb,lil_bit,11,Sun Jul 12 06:16:10 2015 UTC,"I don't understand why else you'd have a three-compartment sink, if you aren't meant to do a detergent/rinse/sanitizer routine. My store was trained to use a three-compartment routine, it's how nearly every fast food service operates."
starbucks,3cypqb,Leadpumper,6,Sun Jul 12 00:55:32 2015 UTC,"Definitely not a QASA violation.  Some stores don't have sanitizing machines and this is the way that they do dishes.  Also, company protocol is to use the three compartment sink method when the sanitizer is not working.  There's nothing wrong with it.  It actually works better in my opinion, the dishes seem to come out cleaner.  Just gotta keep the solution within standard.  Drain and change the solution every 30 minutes or so and you'll be fine."
starbucks,3cypqb,adamrobertt,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:49:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah 75 degree sanitizer should last 30 minutes. We used the same stuff at a fast food place I worked, and we swapped it every 30. Does anyone know how long the soap solution lasts? At my old job it was 4 hours (and this was washing burger and bacon grease in it). I'm not sure if Starbucks uses the same solution or something else."
starbucks,3cypqb,ventidgaf,0,Sun Jul 12 16:51:05 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure about the soap, but usually you'll have to change it long before it goes bad due to all the gross stuff floating in it.  I usually change it once it isn't clear anymore, which sometimes doesn't take very long."
starbucks,3cypqb,adamrobertt,3,Sun Jul 12 17:01:00 2015 UTC,"Directly from a store (kiosk) with no Hobart.. It is NOT a violation. We have our sink filled with sanitizer all day. When we have our audit, we drain it, and refill it to ensure it is at the correct strength- the person does test this, but it's allowed (and expected) that the sink is full in our case."
starbucks,3cypqb,j0ska,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:43:09 2015 UTC,"We have dishwashing diagrams for the three-compartment sink message showing a sink full of sanitizer, so my instinct is to say that it's okay. Immersion in full sink would be the only way to guarantee every part of a dish gets sanitized-- it's possible to miss spots by simply rinsing with the running hose.  The problem (and potential QASA violation) would be leaving the sink unattended (standing lukewarm solution = bad, also somebody could add water/another chemical to the sanitizer and compromise its effectiveness) continuing to use the sanitizer after it was visibly dirty or fell out of the acceptable concentration range or using sanitizer that is too cold/hot.  Basically, if you're actively standing there using the three compartment sink method, it shouldn't be a problem. If for any reason you have to walk away-- drain the sink. Since we rarely get a chance to do dishes UNinterrupted, you would have to drain and refill the sink frequently, which is wasteful, so I can understand why managers might discourage it.  ed: uninterrupted ≠ interrupted"
starbucks,3cypqb,westboundgirl,2,Sun Jul 12 00:31:56 2015 UTC,I guess I should have mentioned that I only do this when I'm closing and planted on dishes. It's a lot faster since the dishes don't get as hot and I can put them away faster. I can also do more at a time since I can fill 2 drying racks and have a 3rd sink full before I need to start putting things away. During the day I definitely wouldn't leave a sink full of water for the reasons you mentioned. Thanks for the answer

starbucks,3cypqb,Leadpumper,2,Sun Jul 12 00:06:18 2015 UTC,Any idea why it's a qasa? Especially since the only time I fill a sanitizer sink is when I'm planted on dishes so it's not like there's a sink full of water just chillin in the back
starbucks,3cypqb,adamrobertt,4,Sun Jul 12 00:44:57 2015 UTC,"As sanitizer sits in the sink, the acid content gradually decreases. Eventually, it will reach a point where the concentration is too low to adequately remove bacteria from your dishes. In training, I was told to keep the sanitizer on a two-hour timer for draining & replacing it. If an inspector comes in and sees you have sanitizer in the sink, they can (and will) test the acidity to make sure it's conforming to health & safety standards.  Thus, it is a QASA violation if your sanitizer has been sitting out for  ~2 hours or more. Easiest way to avoid it (besides just following the rules in the first place) is to drain the sink so there's nothing to test."
starbucks,3cypqb,spudwinkle,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:11:48 2015 UTC,It isn't.  There is nothing on the QASA long form that says anything about the 3 compartment sink method being an inherent violation - just that the sanitizing solution must be within 200-400ppm.

starbucks,3cya98,heigh_ho,6,Sat Jul 11 21:41:37 2015 UTC,SM here. My guess is that they didn't dilute it as you said. I've done a side by side with them and the cold brew is soooo smooth. I'd give it another go and maybe try to see them making it if that's possible. They may have thought that it doesn't get diluted when milk is added which is incorrect but I've caught a few partners forgetting that step.

starbucks,3cya98,BobHogan,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:22:04 2015 UTC,I may have phrased that weird. I was meaning it's incorrect to not dilute it even when you order it with milk. Sounds like you got it down :)
starbucks,3cya98,GoreGoth,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:33:41 2015 UTC,I would guess that too. I've been to other stores and I watched them not even dilute it with water. Understandable since people are assuming it's made like iced coffee but why would someone not be trained on how to make it?
starbucks,3cya98,AbsoluteMadman,2,Sat Jul 11 22:56:59 2015 UTC,"While it could be training related, it may also just be muscle memory. ""Oh, it's a pitcher of cold coffee, fill the cup all the way to the top/middle line!"" without a second thought."
starbucks,3cya98,SaltyBarista,2,Sat Jul 11 23:16:37 2015 UTC,"Well everyone is trained on new drinks a few weeks before launch. Usually, for most new drinks, it's just a different syrup on an already existing drink. Peach green tea for example. Cold brew, on the other hand, is a completely new thing in every way. Most of us that have been here a while are hard wired with how we our drinks are made. So adding water to what looks like iced coffee is super weird. I still feel weird when I dilute it with water. Just my thoughts. I think it's just going take a while for everyone to get their muscle memory hard wired for this one."

starbucks,3cya98,stitchbomb,2,Sun Jul 12 13:37:14 2015 UTC,"Hmm... I would go inside next time. Maybe tell them your thoughts about your last visit and your interest in cold brew. Perhaps even ask how it's prepared. They'll most likely say the recipe, including the added water. If anything, this conversation will spark their memory and, any barista in the immediate area, of the recipe. You might just get it on the house. I know most baristas would give it to you based on your experience and interest in giving it another chance. When made properly, you should have an incredibly smooth yet full bodied flavor. Hope this helped a little, good luck!"

It doesn't have to be calorie-free because of the fruit juice, but it doesn't have to have all the extra sugar either. I love the mango black tea lemonade, and many other custom tea drinks I've experimented with using mango, but I'm always reluctant to make it for myself because of the calories."

starbucks,3cvzxc,youwhoyouhoo,2,Sat Jul 11 21:39:42 2015 UTC,"I've sampled at a few different cafes and my best advice is not to ask if they want a sample. Because they will say no. Instead of  ""Would you like to try a sample of the new blah-blah?"" try ""I've got an AMAAAAZING sample of the new blah-blah for you."" If it has any allergens, obviously mention them like, ""Hi, I've got a delicious sample of our coconut soy latte for you! It does contain soy and coconut, if you're allergic?"" And then be super excited about the product while they're drinking/eating it.   But also, treat it like a video game, think of the people who say yes/take a sample as +1, people who go into the store with their sample as +2 and the people who say no, or ignore you don't even count.   If you have to talk up a product you don't like, talk to someone who does like it and ask why. Then you can say, ""This is my friend's favourite! She can not get over how refreshing it is and that minty kick!!"" That way, you're not lying or pretending to like something you don't.

Used to be the same with the actual when I worked as a server in a restaurant. If they think you're fixing it, more often than not that's all its going to take."

starbucks,3cu6z2,sn7v,3,Fri Jul 10 20:27:24 2015 UTC,"Very nice.  Quite a bit better than most.  I'm assuming you use the normal Starbucks pitcher?    To critique it a little bit (because that's how we get better; I gladly accept critiques, and am lucky to have a buddy who is way better than myself and loves to dissect pours):    The foam is great The rosetta is quite good; you have a fair amount of leaves and most of them are hollow leaves. It could be a bit more symmetrical, but you're never going to get a totally symmetrical rosetta. The final cut is a little wavy, but I personally like a bit of flex in the cut.  If it were a latte art competition, judges would prefer a straight line cut.  The base layer that wraps around the rosetta is beiged out and could be better.    I'm no better than you; I don't want to come off sounding that way.  I'm probably a step behind you.  95% of my pours are hands down worse than this.  The other 5% are 'roughly' the same quality as your pour.  The last three weeks I've been trying to improve my base layer, as I also have been getting washed out bases that wrap around my art.  Here's one of mine from a couple weeks back.  The rosetta itself is pretty crummy, but the base layer looks better than my usual beiged out bases I pour.  edit: Do you post any of your stuff to Instagram?  I'd love to follow your progress.  I post a little to Instagram, about 60% latte art / 40% other crap.  IG name is Jalarang if you're interested."

The only place with any space in the cafe is our big ""communal table"" which is often in use by one or two students with all their work spread across the whole thing even though it's designed to seat 6-8 people.    None of these changes made sense as we were not a busy store. We have no parking, and we are the only store in our area that can accommodate wheelchair/scooter customers.

starbucks,3cuix5,adamrobertt,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:10:49 2015 UTC,Former tech here. Call it in. The seals for the piston are worn out and the grind is off most likely. Powder quantity too high is when there is too much espresso being ground for any reason.   From the looks of the symptoms you could try making your grind a couple of clicks coarser and pulling about 5 shots. If no improvement click more and pull 5 more. You never want to click a lot and you always want to pull a couple shots as the calibration isn't immediate.

starbucks,3cv3g7,lapideminteriora,10,Sat Jul 11 00:46:57 2015 UTC,"So, it's not standard so I'm not recommending that you do it, but when I have a customer who get a drink like that and says it's too soupy, when I scoop my ice into the blender I put a few cubes of it into the cup with the milk in it. Essentially, if you cool the shots down a bit, it doesn't melt the ice when you blend it. Never had a customer complain after that."
starbucks,3cv3g7,Savvycattt,3,Sat Jul 11 01:33:38 2015 UTC,Yeah I sometimes use a new steam pitcher and chill it with ice. I toss the ice and swirl the shots in the pitcher a little to cool them off. I also go a little shy on the milk and the drink comes almost out with the same consistency of a normal frappuccino.  There isn't much for the lady that comes in asking for a 7 shot mocha frappuccino though
starbucks,3cv3g7,TheFabulousNeo,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:22:23 2015 UTC,"I'm going to have to try this out. But, I'm still worried about the amount of milk to espresso and roast. Do you still only measure to the line when you do it that way?"
starbucks,3cv3g7,Savvycattt,2,Sat Jul 11 05:14:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you'll still measure it the same way. The drink still always has the same amount of liquid, it just turns soupy because the temperature is melting the ice."
starbucks,3cv3g7,grandypeakspalace,1 point,Sat Jul 11 11:17:06 2015 UTC,"Alright, well thanks. I'm going to be trying this later today, and if I'm lucky the customer may come by."
starbucks,3cv3g7,Bean_Queen,6,Sat Jul 11 15:32:45 2015 UTC,"Ask if they'd like it affogato style maybe? It'll still melt but they're getting all of their shots, at least."
starbucks,3cv3g7,jnicholass,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:50:31 2015 UTC,"Thank you. One of my coworkers suggested this as well, and I'm going to keep it as an option."
starbucks,3cv3g7,spudwinkle,15,Sat Jul 11 04:56:36 2015 UTC,"Put the shots in the cup, frap roast, milk to the line.  It's still the same amount of liquid."
starbucks,3cv3g7,redadidasjumpsuit,3,Sat Jul 11 00:51:16 2015 UTC,"Thank you, but I've tried that already and It's the same liquid but it's barely any milk so it tastes... unpleasant. It's quite soupy still also."
starbucks,3cv3g7,Damn_Nature_,5,Sat Jul 11 04:59:21 2015 UTC,"It might be how the customer wants it. You could, if you needed to, not add the roast. Would allow for a little bit more milk."
starbucks,3cv3g7,adamrobertt,-2,Sat Jul 11 09:07:22 2015 UTC,If he already has 3 shots of espresso he doesn't really need the 3 pumps of frap roast for the grande anyway so that can be cut for more milk.
starbucks,3cv3g7,scaryterrrordactyl,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:06:26 2015 UTC,That's just what happens. I warn customers who want to add 1000 shots to their fraps about this. You can also recommend extra ice if they want it thicker and you can pour it into a larger cup if it's a tall or grande.
starbucks,3cv3g7,adamrobertt,2,Sat Jul 11 20:24:59 2015 UTC,DING! DING! We have a winner!
starbucks,3cv3g7,Prophoto2,2,Sat Jul 11 02:52:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah the key is to make sure you don't just put the shots into the pitcher. You still have to measure everything out in the cup. Frap roast, three shots, milk, then pour and finish. It'll taste stronger and be less watery."
starbucks,3cv3g7,JanaDarren,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:03:31 2015 UTC,"When you do that it's almost all espresso and roast that there's barely any milk. It doesn't taste very pleasant either, and it's very watery from the espresso. Thank you, though, but mostly my customer just didn't like it the first time when I did that which is why I'm looking for an alternative."
starbucks,3cv3g7,MaidenLocks,11,Sat Jul 11 05:05:13 2015 UTC,It's almost all espresso because that's what they're ordering. These people are unpleasable.
starbucks,3cu5ct,HelloMyNameIsCat,14,Fri Jul 10 20:15:25 2015 UTC,"I don't have experience with Starbucks in these types of deals, but in general make sure that paperwork exists for you to sign before making a final decision and read through it carefully before doing so. That way you cannot be screwed after making a huge change."
starbucks,3cu5ct,SaltyBarista,5,Fri Jul 10 20:22:28 2015 UTC,Can't agree enough. You MUST have a signed document outlining their agreement to compensate you on this level before a move of this sort. Don't assume they'll cover you and don't assume they won't  screw you over.
starbucks,3cu5ct,aratcliffe,3,Fri Jul 10 21:14:37 2015 UTC,"id say go with the guy SM, there is nothing worse than an SM who doesnt work on the floor. especially if you are going for shift. also as everyone has said, make sure everything is on paper. like pay and your current position, dont take a run around about getting paperwork later. if they are serious about wanting you they shouldnt try to scam you."
starbucks,3cu5ct,kakasensei,2,Sat Jul 11 03:20:58 2015 UTC,"I don't have a whole lot of experience with this kind of thing, but it sounds to me like the SM and DM both really like you and really want to promote you, even beyond shift. I'd say if you don't go for it, then wherever you do end up, at least take advantage of this and get them to advise a promotion for wherever you go."
starbucks,3cu5ct,mickeymau5music,2,Fri Jul 10 20:59:55 2015 UTC,"Just some friendly advice from one partner to another:  I moved to Chicago from my hometown and I legitimately regret it. My pay went further back home since the cost of living was much lower. I've met some nice people here, but mostly people are self-serving. My store has been through so many changes, it feels like I come into a new job every day. The neighborhood I live in is rough. There have been several killings in the area over the last few months, all gang related, but this is the cheapest north side neighborhood I can afford. The taxes are really high. Even with a working husband, we still struggle to pay rent and bills. I'd like to leave, but I'm wrapped up in school at the moment, so i'm just dealing.   I'm not trying to dissuade you, as it seems like you might have a good SM at bat for you, and that really makes all the difference, but I was very naive before moving here. Your SM is being honest with you by letting you know it's a big adjustment, and yes, you need to keep your eyes open for scams. Everybody is out to get theirs.   The other stuff, you'll just need to go with your gut. I'm just offering up my experience to a fellow partner. Good luck!"
starbucks,3crihr,baristalife,16,Fri Jul 10 04:49:05 2015 UTC,"Today a customer was like ""huh. prices went up?"" and i was like, yep, just by a little. ""so do you guys get paid any more?""  How do I put this nicely...?  Nope!"
starbucks,3crihr,LadyEru,20,Fri Jul 10 05:40:22 2015 UTC,I actually heard NPR reporting about how even though coffee prices have gone down Starbucks is increasing prices. NPR stated that Starbucks was upping prices because of increased partner wages and competitive marketing prices. I would like to know who exactly is getting this increase in wages because my partners are making shit and I have a few who can barley get by.

starbucks,3ctauj,brorista,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:45:14 2015 UTC,"Tenure is great, but like he said they will use tangible results. An ASM leads in many ways, but particularly coaching. Are you involved in developing your partners? Do you have a 100 percent cash management compliance? Do you ensure (friendly reminder, mainly) that this is followed entirely by everyone? Have you helped manage labour effectively? What about managing your food waste?   Find things that you have done and make you look good. When you do have your interview with the DM, bring these up.   Beyond that, you have to also consider bonuses and experience. In most cases, an external hire will be paid more than you just because they've already been trained (having a freshly hired external being paid more than a 10+ year store manager with numerous accolades, is not uncommon).   All that being said, even with the leadership changes of late, the company is still great to work for. My best advice is for you to analyze your strengths and then areas of opportunity. Try turning those onto strengths.   If you come out well rounded and confident, you'll fare much better."

starbucks,3cte2w,aoloya,12,Fri Jul 10 16:56:11 2015 UTC,"Don't make more than 2 drinks at once. It causes you to break sequence and actually slows you down when you're trying to make a frappuccino in the blender, two lattes on bar and a shaken iced tea somewhere else. Not to mention your drink quality will suffer.   Also you don't have to ""run"". There's a girl at my store who literally runs the two steps from cold bar to hot bar. It's hilarious but inefficient. You can walk."
starbucks,3cte2w,sneeze_trigger,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:23:31 2015 UTC,"I (at least) am efficient making 3 drinks at once when it comes to the moment I have to make a hot drink, a frapuccino and another hot one. I steam milk, syrups and queue shots for the first drink, then go to the CBS and pour milk and syrups into the blender AND LEAVE IT BEFORE POURING ICE & ACTUAL BLENDING, then back to steaming, syrups and queuing shots for the third drink while finishing the first I told you. When I finish it I go back to the CBS, pour the ice and blend, go back to the espresso bar to continue with the hot drink, steam milk & queue shots for a new one and then go back to finish the frappucino. It might sound like you're wasting a lot of time but you are not. I believe it's the best way to go with the sequence."
starbucks,3cte2w,sbuxmc,2,Fri Jul 10 19:30:40 2015 UTC,"When I first became a partner, this was the official sequencing routine for hot beverage - frappucino - hot beverage-- at some point last year, it changed to go all the way to blend. Not a good idea, this way of doing things is much faster, plus if you don't have a good cold bar setup, getting everything in the blender before the shots for your first drink die is nearly impossible."
starbucks,3cte2w,westboundgirl,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:40:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah it actually is the official routine, I tried it the other way but it's just too overwhelming to do it all at once"
starbucks,3cte2w,sbuxmc,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:50:20 2015 UTC,Agreed. I try to get all the way to blend when I can to save motion-- our layout is terrible--but I will revert to this when there's too much back and forth going on and my hot drink quality is at risk of dropping.
starbucks,3cte2w,westboundgirl,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:54:43 2015 UTC,But for a newbie I think it's best to learn the routine before modifying
starbucks,3cte2w,sneeze_trigger,10,Sat Jul 11 23:42:36 2015 UTC,"8 years of experience here. Just stay clean, organized, and in routine. Too often I see baristas using like, 12 pitchers and refusing to rinse them because they think pouring the milk for the next million drinks is going to be faster. This is just plain wrong. Humans are terrible at multi-tasking. I don't care who you are or how good you think you are at multi-tasking, you're wrong and there's plenty of science to back that up, I'm just too lazy to post it from my phone. Instead, focus on doing one thing at a time as quickly and efficiently as you can. Then work on reducing your downtime between tasks and boom, you're in a sequence. What separates the good baristas from the truly great is the ability to minimize the amount of time it takes to refocus and move from one task to another; whether it be from one beverage to the next, or from mopping a floor to stocking a condiment bar, or from washing dishes to writing a schedule. Focus and concentration will seriously pay dividends and bonus, your coworkers will think you're the shit and will love working with you. Good luck!"
starbucks,3cte2w,dart51984,10,Fri Jul 10 23:17:45 2015 UTC,Always be steaming milk! Steam milk like your life depends on it.  Unless it's an iced drink. Then that'd just be gross.

starbucks,3cte2w,Dakeyrus,2,Fri Jul 10 18:49:45 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure an iced capp is with cold milk, just with a scoop of foam on top before the lid goes on.  But still... pretty gross, IMO."
starbucks,3cte2w,pastar1ngs,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:19:44 2015 UTC,"It is. The official recipe is to make an iced late with about 1/4""-1/2"" of foam on top of the ice. So you still have to steam milk, but its pretty much a late"
starbucks,3cte2w,BobHogan,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:22:41 2015 UTC,"Indeed!  The foam kinda sinks into the ice though, and ends up looking quite strange.  I cringe a little at the sight of them."
starbucks,3cte2w,Dakeyrus,8,Sun Jul 12 18:42:32 2015 UTC,"Number one most important rule: FOLLOW BR2.  Other helpful tips:    Keep your bar clean, organized and stocked. Use signals/ communicate with your CS/floater/support to make this happen. It will make your life SO much easier, nothing backs you up more than accidentally spilling an open milk all over a crowded bar, or having to make a mad dash to the back room for matcha. If you have a gap between drinks, or a run of stuff that doesn't need shots, hit the rinse button. Never wait for a rinse to finish again when you really need to get a long Americano started. Also, if you have an even longer pause, empty your grounds drawer-- you don't need to wait until it's full! If you're not already, make sure you're using the second bar for additional (third or higher) shots for the current beverage. One of my biggest pet peeves is to see a partner with only a grande Americano in front of them hit the 3-shot button. You could finish that drink in half the time using all your resources properly! Keep cups facing you so you can see what's coming next-- it's okay to ask people to make sure they set them down this way too! Practice, practice, practice! Take every chance you get to be on bar, ask questions if you're still having some trouble with recipes-- and ask for support when you need it! I appreciate a barista who knows their limits and what help they need/when they need it far more than one who stubbornly insists they're fine--and learning to work with and as a support is an important skill to have if you're ever going to bar during peak.   Good luck!"
starbucks,3cte2w,westboundgirl,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:35:14 2015 UTC,WHAT IS BR2??? O_O
starbucks,3cte2w,westboundgirl,2,Sat Jul 11 05:03:27 2015 UTC,"Common acronym for ""Beverage Repeatable Routine"""
starbucks,3cte2w,westboundgirl,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:19:41 2015 UTC,Never heard of it. Please enlighten.
starbucks,3cte2w,minccino,6,Sat Jul 11 22:16:06 2015 UTC,"You might have heard it called ""sequencing"", but it should be a major, major part of your training. If what I say below doesn't trigger some memories of that, you need to talk to your trainer, shift, manager or the most competent barista you know and ask them about it. If you're in a corporate store, you can also use the store laptop to look up some videos that demonstrate it on the portal (under Videos -> Routines -> Beverage Production).  The major principles of BR2 are:   Replace like with like (milk for milk, shots for shots) Keep the machine busy Keep yourself busy   The STEPS of BR2 for one beverage are:   Steam milk (i.e. the milk steaming routine: pour, aerate, autosteam) Queue shots (hit the button for the number/type of shots you need) Pump syrup (into the cup, WHILE the shots shots are grinding-- this way the machine doesn't sit idle, you're using the grind time productively) Finish and connect (fill the cup with syrup, milk, top and hand off)   When you have two beverages, the steps look like this:   Steam milk for Drink #1 Queue shots for Drink #1 Pump syrup for Drink # 1, put the cup down under the pour spout. Pour milk for Drink #2.  By the time you're done, the milk for Drink # 1 should be finished-- remove it, wipe and blow out the steam wand, start steaming the milk for Drink #2. Queue shots for Drink #2. Pump syrup for Drink #2, switch the cups under the pour spout. Finish and connect Drink #1 Finish and connect Drink #2   When you have three or more drinks, you're still only working on two drinks at a time, there's just a transition point when you switch from working on Drinks #1 and #2 to #2 and #3 etc.  So, if you have a vanilla latte, a cappucino and a mocha on your bar, in that order:   Steam milk for the vanilla latte. Queue shots for the vanilla latte Pump syrup for the vanilla latte, put the cup under the pour spout. Pour milk for the cappucino, switch it for the finished latte milk. Queue shots for the cappucino (Pump syrup for the cappucino-- here you don't need any), switch the cups under the pour spout Finish and connect the vanilla latte (pour and hand out) Pour and steam milk for the mocha, switching it with the completed cappuccino milk Queue shots for the mocha Pump syrup for the mocha, switch the cups under the pour spout Finish and connect the cappuccino (pour and hand out) Finish and connect the mocha (pour, whip, hand out)   I italicized the transition point, this is the tricky part because it's a lot to do in the time you're waiting for the cappuccino shots, but when you've had more practice, it's totally doable.  Another important part of BRR is that if you get interrupted (a customer distracts you with a question, you have to empty your grounds drawer, etc),finish the drink you're working on WITHOUT trying to play catch-up with your second drink -- confusion and being rushed will just slow you down. Start a new cycle of BRR with the next cup in your queue as Drink #1."

starbucks,3cte2w,Wonderground,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:47:14 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much (to both of you!).  I'm a trainer myself, so I've had a lot of practice explaining this, and I'm a visual learner, so seeing it written out REALLY helped me when I was learning it. There's also a training card in Block 2 for beverage sequencing that gives a more visual representation of this (It confused the heck out of me, but for someone who likes pictures, it might be useful), as well as one that shows the equivalent stopping points for CBS drinks/routines.   Talking through this using marked cups is a great way to practice without using lots of product up-- it's an exercise that we made all baristas go through during Summer 1/ Holiday rallies in my old district. (Bonus points for sound effects, I had a barista who hissed every time she was ""steaming milk"", made a ""pew-pew"" sound for queuing shots and a ""ch-ch"" sound for pumping syrup, it made my day because COMMITMENT.)"
starbucks,3cte2w,JohnFinnsWife,5,Sun Jul 12 19:14:08 2015 UTC,"Do you already know how to sequence drinks correctly? Do you already have recipes memorized and can recall them without hesitation?

starbucks,3cte2w,Vladgren,3,Fri Jul 10 20:25:01 2015 UTC,Utilize both bars! More than 2 shots? Pull the third/fourth on the other bar at the same time. It depends on what you have in queue but can help speed up americanos/venti iced espresso drinks

starbucks,3cte2w,Anaturalminor,3,Fri Jul 10 18:01:52 2015 UTC,"Always steam milk first. Unless its some triple or quad hot drink that you know is going to take a sec.  Try to focus on not getting too far ahead of yourself and sticking to 2 drinks at time until you get comfortable and develope the muscle memory, but also don't be afraid to look ahead a cup or 2 for shot combos. Like if you're about to pull 3 for an iced venti latte, but conveniently you see that the next cafe drink is a simple red eye or something. Then knock them out with a quad.   Things like that are what will pull you into 30s and 40s if you are a drive thru.  And lastly as an approaching 3 year partner the most important thing I can tell you with this job is TAKE CARE OF YOUR WRISTS/JOINTS. develope good technique with pitchers and gallons. After thousands and thousands of drinks you will see what I mean. :P  Have fun and welcome! :)"

starbucks,3cqzx5,DViddy,4,Sat Jul 11 04:30:53 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I preferred working at a super-fast, high-volume, 60+transactions DT store to the slow, low-volume ""talk to every customer every time"" lobby store.  Pushing for faster DT times was fun, our entire store was involved in it, we were always posting our new records and it was a big deal, and it was way more fun to work at. Hell, even as a customer, I want to get in, and get out, and I get irritated when so many stores I go to lack any sense of urgency with a line.  And sure, we make every single drink by hand. But I feel way better about my day when I can serve nearly 60 cars on bar by myself in half an hour than I do when I only have 30 customers an hour to make personalized connections with. That's boring to me, and a lot of our customers are... weird when given too much time to linger.  Customers frequenting high-volume, super-quick stores are looking for a different type of connection, and catering to different types of customer connections is still living up to the brand and the mission statement."
starbucks,3cqzx5,psychowidow,10,Fri Jul 10 04:44:14 2015 UTC,"""when I can serve nearly 60 cars on bar by myself in half an hour""  lmao"
starbucks,3cqzx5,DViddy,2,Fri Jul 10 06:01:15 2015 UTC,"Eh. I guess it's okay to laugh at, but it's a true statement. My first PDX store was a DT-only store, and during peak we generally ran two baristas on bar in tandem. But sometimes someone would call in for the day, and you'd have to run just one, and the pressure was on to keep our usual 60ish cars per half hour going. My highest ever on bar by myself was a 58, though in the times this happened and I was the bar partner I generally fell somewhere around 55. We had one partner who would always land at 59, until he finally barred a 63 on his own. It was pretty impressive. My second PDX store was a DT/Lobby combo, and we'd run just a single bar partner dedicated to the DT, and they generally kept things hovering at 50 per half.   It's definitely possible, though I've discovered a world of difference between high volume baristas and low volume baristas and their experiences. I've also seen lobby-only baristas bus out 60+ transactions in half an hour, and it's just as impressive."
starbucks,3cqzx5,Vladgren,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:03:53 2015 UTC,"Even during peek we get nowhere near 60. The record at my store is 50 per half our and 40 tops. Mostly sit at 30, but I imagine if we had a better team we could do a whole lot better"

Check your cash management log for that record before you make any phone calls. If you find that one of your punches has been changed and is not correct, speak to your manager directly- it may have been a mistake.

starbucks,3ctmmx,MaidenLocks,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:00:11 2015 UTC,yes but my SM always lets us know if and why a punch was edited. it's usually because we forgot to clock in/out.

starbucks,3cozhe,grandypeakspalace,5,Fri Jul 10 01:06:51 2015 UTC,"Alright so here's a tip from a barista who used to work at Starbucks and now works in a specialty coffeeshop where we do pour overs and siphons.  The system we have set up is that during rush we have a 3 or 4 person setup   pos (coffee and pastries, barely has to move)  coffee bar (focused on pourovers tea bulb  and siphons when in queue or runs order support.)  bar 1 ( prepping cup steaming milk, your best bar person as he/she needs to be the most skilled in milk mechanics which is the hardest part)  Bar 2 (spro prep cleaning pitchers and portafilters as well as plating. The more bar 2 can do the better and faster things will go if the rush breaks he goes to store support.)   We also go lean sometimes running two people when we get hit. We work in between the bloom we pass each other things we are all listening to the customer ordering and prepping POS for their next pour over.   When I worked at Starbucks we had our pourover far away from POS near the grinder. If you need to do a pourover start grabbing materials while transaction is in place, offer upsales and if able move your pour over stand closer to POS.   Be honest with your customer tell them it will take about 5 minutes for your pourover.  Don't rush it. Iirc we aren't taught to bloom at the bux(because sometimes it just ain't necessary when talking about 3-4 week old beans.) But if its for here wet that paper filter.  If slow pourovers are an up sell opportunity invite the customer over to the pour over bar. Give them some TLC and learn a bit about where it was made how it started who makes your pourover equipment for retail. The benefits: single cup of coffee incredibly efficient (little to no waste of coffee when making for yourself in the morning doesn't take long and  makes a fairly clean (no grinds or sludge) cup while being easy to clean and do while waking up.   Talk a bit about the coffee what to look for.   That morning you woke up and said that you should be a barista is the day you accepted that this will occur. We had a similar situation with coffee cocktails and now I don't mind at all even if it was a bit more taxing.   Then again our ""batch brew"" is set at 3.30 our pourover is between 4-5 depending on the origin and siphons are 1.50 upsell on pourovers.   Hope this helps a bit."
starbucks,3cozhe,Tartra,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:30:15 2015 UTC,"I'm completely lost :( I don't know what a siphon is, or what blooming is. So I can really only follow about half of what you are saying, and that was basically to move all of the pourover supplies closer to the register"
starbucks,3cozhe,my_stacking_username,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:09:19 2015 UTC,Bloom is wetting the grinds in a pourover. You have 30 seconds to do something useful before you begin pouring for real.  Basically work between pours.

Corporate needs to start to learn  that they need to be more careful. They need to start thinking of their baristas and what the fuck they are doing instead of blind profits. Go ask any barista that has been working for 3+ months and they all can tell you something that Corporate could do to make our lives better (and usually increase profits at the same time). Yet Corporate doesn't listen to us, they never listen to the people that know what they are talking about, they listen to shareholders. I want them to be fucked by this.

starbucks,3cozhe,Galiphile,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:45:11 2015 UTC,"How does it work with roast choices? Can I get anything on a pour over? They always try and suggest a clover instead, isn't the clover much more expensive, they always seem like $4 on the board or can I get a standard roast on the clover for the Drip price?"
starbucks,3cozhe,lifesbrink,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:11:24 2015 UTC,"Typically, you can get whatever drip we have going on a pour over because its already ground and ready for that specific filter. If you ask for a roast that isn't brewing that day, then we don't have it ground already, so we'll have to go grab a bag and grind it for the pour over setting, then go start the pour over. The reason a clover would be suggested instead would be because there may already be beans of that roast prepared in a clover bin and it's easier to measure out the correct amount of beans, grind them, and let the clover do the rest of the work. As for the price, that depends on which type of roast you get. Reserve beans will be more expensive based on where they're grown typically. For instance, Kona is grown in Hawaii. Since land there is ridiculously expensive, a tall kona clover costs $4 something. I think that's our most expensive one though. Regular roasts like pike, Verona, Veranda, etc. don't cost much more (if any) on the clover."
starbucks,3cozhe,Marie_2,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:04:27 2015 UTC,"Pour overs you can get any roast or specific coffee you want. The coffee's of the day will already be prepped, but you can have them open a bag of anything.   My store has a clover and any of our core coffees (komodo dragon, verona, veranda, kenya, etc.) are 50 cents more then a drip. The $4 ones on the board are the reserves, which you can also get. They are made in smaller batches and usually roasted more recently.   I personally prefer the clover, it is more flavorful and full bodied and gets rid of some of the acidity. It is also quicker and easier as a barista. But totally keep getting pour-overs if you prefer!"

Makes it more fun for us, because then we might have a new favorite drink.  But I understand your concern. I'm in a licensed store, so we don't have some of the fancy stuff. I've recently been going to a corporate store just down the street because they just got a fizzio machine. I want to try all the new ideas for great drinks with that thing, but I'm hesitant because I don't want to annoy them."
starbucks,3cpjor,afyvarra,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:16:45 2015 UTC,"The last coffee job I had was not bux, and our set menu on the board was incredibly simple. I mean laughably so, but being the only place in thirty miles to get actual espresso, it didn't matter. Small eyeblink and you miss it town on the only highway to a tourist destination fifty miles up the mountain, we got a LOT of people stopping in from civilised country for a break and gas. I got more off menu orders than anything else, (locals too.)   No matter how complicated the drink was I never minded. I was happy to do it because I had fun with it.   There is a difference with special orders when a kitchen runs a set menu and 75% of the work is already done before they even start, and when every item is made from scratch. Proper espresso drinks are always made from scratch, so customising them is never really a hassle. We have to do each one individually anyway, we have to add all the syrup and steam the milk for every drink regardless. Doing it off standard menu isn't really anything extra."

starbucks,3cq3oi,dvorak_lover,5,Fri Jul 10 00:25:26 2015 UTC,"We wash ours in the Hobart every time, properly disassembled with the gaskets on the bottom rack and other dishes on top. No problems with them yet.  ¯_(ツ)_/¯"
starbucks,3cq3oi,annimf,2,Fri Jul 10 00:38:27 2015 UTC,You have two racks in your sanitizer? O.O
starbucks,3cq3oi,zappy312,2,Fri Jul 10 01:51:51 2015 UTC,"I don't think any Hobart machines have two racks.  You can cheat by filling your flat rack with small items (caps, carafe lids, grates, spoons, mats, etc.) and then placing your peg rack on top with the taller items (carafes, whip containers, plates, etc.).  This prevents the small items from flying around during washing and allows you to wash way more items.  You should be careful because if you put too much in, the sanitizer won't reach all the sides of the dishes.  At least that's what I do when doing dishes.    Edit: I don't think this is completely QASA approved, but it's not the worst thing to do (in the grand scheme of things).  You could always leave the top rack empty to be more QASA approved."
starbucks,3cq3oi,annimf,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:10:16 2015 UTC,"Interesting. We tend to use our flat rack for drying, and transfer the dishes from the peg rack to the flat rack. I remember my old store we would switch the trays; but then again, the sink was slightly smaller, so that you could set the rack on the ledge of the sink and it wouldn't fall in."
starbucks,3cq3oi,nyoomachine,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:18:57 2015 UTC,"I always switched them out - Hobart one, load the other, switch them, put away freshly sanitized dishes while the other one is going, repeat."
starbucks,3cq3oi,DViddy,4,Fri Jul 10 18:01:05 2015 UTC,"To be fair, the top of the espresso machine heat problem is for the caramel sauce itself- melting it and then cooling it back down changes the flavor and consistency and makes it weird."
starbucks,3cq3oi,amandar00lz,2,Fri Jul 10 00:53:49 2015 UTC,"The gravity bottle care instructions do specify how to Hobart them (underneath a large pitcher or container so they don't float all around inside the hobart) but it couldn't hurt to NOT hobart them I guess. I haven't had this issue but a bottle or two at my store are starting to lose their air-tightness. The seals or something get messed up here or there and we hobart them religiously, but that's the only issue we've had. Never had to replace a single part.

In a customer service environment, you're encouraged to just apologize and ""fix"" your ""mistake"", even if it isn't your fault. (Again, this is very general. Obviously women are perfectly capable of being rude or abrasive, and there are plenty of men with strong customer service skills, but it is culturally ingrained in many women to be congenial and apologize even when they're not wrong - I even have female customers apologizing to me when the mistake was ours in the first place.)"

starbucks,3cpmsd,alatikatikati,11,Thu Jul 9 19:39:17 2015 UTC,"First thing you should do, take yourself off of bar. I know how painful it is, because I am a shift as well. I'm fortunate to have many strong baristas that are fast as fuqqq (I am fast but my bar looks like a war zone) just OS and get as many cups marked as possible! Give the green beans their time to learn, but which is the strongest? Give them a shot in bar! I was an outside hire, I could not for the life of me get bar down until I got stuck there during holiday peak for a week straight. This may not be of much help, I apologize if that's the case, but the green beans will eventually learn and the crabby partners will have eager replacements :)"
starbucks,3cpmsd,grandypeakspalace,8,Thu Jul 9 20:15:21 2015 UTC,"I hear ya. Being a barista can be a really fun job, being a shift.... not so much. My biggest recommendation for a smooth peak though, is to not put yourself on bar. I know it's super hard, especially with so many green beans, but it's really REALLY hard to keep a rush under control while you're focused on bar. However, if it's just you and a bunch of green beans, sometimes you have to be the one on bar, I get it, I've been there recently. If that's the case, you should probably talk to your SM about his/her scheduling, because you really cant have a good peak with you and a bunch of people still learning how to do everything"
starbucks,3cpmsd,danamul,2,Thu Jul 9 19:55:14 2015 UTC,"So if you don't mind me asking, where do you put yourself? I usually stick myself as B2 for all the cold bev stuff because it's easier for me to talk to the green beans, and just people in general. I've stuck myself on Order Support which seemed to work best, but at our store that's known as the savior ""easy"" job, so to them it looks like I'm assigning myself the easy position, even if I'm visibly constantly working hard."
starbucks,3cpmsd,ThirdEyeCentre,5,Thu Jul 9 20:48:34 2015 UTC,Maybe my store runs OS differently but that's definitely the toughest position here. We don't run SS/CS so OS absorbs those tasks.
starbucks,3cpmsd,danamul,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:57:03 2015 UTC,"oh really?? at my store OS is the spot no one wants to do because you have to be constantly moving. but maybe thats because we dont have a warming person or a label maker, so we're expediting, marking cups and running back and forth from the oven. So thats where I put myself because it allows you to keep an eye on the line as well as run to the bar for back up if they need it. I used to put myself on customer support because its the most flexible and allows you to pretty much go where you need to, but I was told by two different managers that I cant do that for some reason.  I guess the main thing in my mind though, is that bar and reg positions are (or are supposed to be) planted positions."
starbucks,3cpmsd,mully1121,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:18:01 2015 UTC,"During peak, as someone else said, I try to put my self in a floating position. Depending on staffing I'll either R2 (when I have 5-6 people) or DTO/float (during summer when we're down to 4). The biggest thing is you want to be in a position where you can see everything. Bar is a bad idea, you get too focused on drinks and won't see where problems are occurring."
starbucks,3cpmsd,alloftheworld,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:38:00 2015 UTC,"My current store doesn't run full playbook because we're not that staffed, but my last store did. Isn't OS sort of the designated floater? That's where you would want to be ideally, especially if you have a warmer. Hopefully someone in a busy store running full playbook can help you out more, but if you have questions about a medium volume cafe store with a 4 partner peak let me know ;)"
starbucks,3cpmsd,Laeryken,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:22:02 2015 UTC,"B2/OS is a fine spot UNTIL that bar-2 person is needed constantly (helping prep B1).  I will often be B2 when I'm not running the shift because I'm good at bouncing back and forth between line, cold bar and prepping hot bar, plus restocking quickly if CS is flexed into play.  The thing is, you have to be able to pick your head up and make decisions on the fly, especially when it comes to breaks and stuff.  Don't worry about what others think.  Praise them for holding down bar and kicking ass, in front of the whole team, and at least they are being appreciated.    Celebrate the #s that you do hit through those periods.  ""Woo, 50+ for 2 hours straight with a peak of 68, nice guys!"" etc.  And, if it's seen as the EASY job, then they aren't doing enough most likely anyways!  But you can pause to peak about the play, flex where needed, swap with someone for a break, etc.  I believe Playbook specifically says that the playcaller should be Order Support or Customer Support.  If I'm at a 5+ play I'm Order Support (usually leaning towards warming), if I'm in a 4 person play I'll often be CS so that I can flex in and out of the play as necessary (keeping the floor stocked, coffee brewed, lobby slides etc, THEN flexing into play).  Place those green beans where they need to be.  Hopefully someone is ready for bar -- if you have 3, one probably is!  Put your best tasker on CS and just accept that you will need to call them into play as you see fit.  ""Hey, help make a couple of cold bar drinks then go back to your routine!""  Okay, sorry, way too much advice probably.  I love running a morning shift and haven't gotten to do it as often as I'd like in recent months.  Wahhh."
starbucks,3cpmsd,SharkyTendencies,5,Fri Jul 10 10:54:28 2015 UTC,"I think everyone has covered the ""don't put yourself on bar"" rule, so I won't repeat it... but yeah. Don't put yourself on bar. If you're doing Playbook, put yourself on OS.   If people aren't staying planted, grab a sheet of newspaper and lay it right down where their feet are supposed to be. Tell them, in no uncertain terms, that they have a choice: either stand on the damn newspaper and call what they need to you, OR, go home and forfeit the day's wages. The choice is theirs. I have a partner like this, and money is the only language that people understand sometimes.   As far as partner morale goes, it's a tricky thing. When I got to my current store, people were literally snapping at each other on the floor in front of customers. Twas not a pretty picture.   I'll tell you the secret that worked wonders: Structure, Routines, and Consistency. People crave rules and routines. Make a game plan.  Sit down with a piece of paper and run through all the major tasks that need to be done over the course of the business day. Then, figure out what shifts look like on an average day. Assign certain tasks to certain ""shifts"", and regardless of who the partner is, the tasks assigned to the ""shift"" belong to that partner for the day. At some point, people will just 'know' that whoever's 12-6 is responsible for all the afternoon sanitizing (or whatever). But you have to stick with it.   In time, you'll notice that people automatically go where you need them to be. Your shift will go more smoothly because expectations are there. Don't hesitate to reinforce the game plan, and coach (nicely!) in the moment. People will be happier because they know where they're going and what they're doing.  I agree with the ""Aces in their Places"" philosophy. It's gotten me through many tough days where I know that the rockstars in each role will carry the shift if there's other stuff going on. Don't get too fancy with deployment until a firm routine is established when you're running the show.  For training Green Beans, it works better if you specifically request training time from your SM. I'm not sure how many hours of training time SM's can give out, but it should be uninterrupted time for you to work with your newbies. Ask your SM about this. Trial by fire is the 'traditional' method, true, but at some point there does need to be a sit-down to talk about how things happen.  Good luck, and let us know how it goes!"

starbucks,3cpmsd,SharkyTendencies,1 point,Fri Jul 10 08:44:30 2015 UTC,"No worries!   This is just the strategy that works for me in my store. Some stores have very well-established routines that work great, and other stores have no strategy at all.  The good thing about this strategy is that, after some time, people will get used to the various tasks associated with various shifts. The more you stick with it, the more like clockwork the store becomes. There's no guessing.   Bonus points if all shifts agree to the structure! :P"
starbucks,3cpmsd,Ihatefrappuccinos,4,Fri Jul 10 14:42:52 2015 UTC,Never deploy yourself to bar. You need to be where you can see the whole picture to call the plays. Make yourself the food and brew or support person. Always wear a headset. Put greenbeans on registers during peak.

Tuesday was my last shift as a shift, and I'm just... SO RELIEVED.  Talk to your SM or the previous opener if you can about deployment. Talk to your SM about the baristas not listening to you -- look into write-ups.   Definitely get a green bean into primary bar position with a strong support (if it's busy enough for 2 bar partners), and you should be OS for sure. You need to be able to see the entire store; you can't do that or change the play from bar."
starbucks,3cpmsd,alloftheworld,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:06:28 2015 UTC,"Gotta repeat and stress- shifts off bar. You have to be able to flex, and if you're not able to then you better be ready for your baristas to do it. Get those cups marked, move your line, and figure out a way to clear your bar after the fact. Customer Support until you can't Customer Support anymore! Then do it more."
starbucks,3cpmsd,Monkeygirlcooks,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:18:54 2015 UTC,Green bean here. I worked as a barista a decade ago and came back. I have other green beans that were hired about a week after me. I am put on customer support most mornings and told to flex on if there's three or more drinks and flex off once I get it under control. Then I flex off. You need one of your green beans who gets it. My SM and SS often are working the bar but stay off every hour or so for about five minutes to assess the situation and prepare for the next wave. It seems pretty successful at my store. Good luck!
starbucks,3cpmsd,trapdoordoll,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:56:11 2015 UTC,"If your store is really busy playbook is awesome. I know the Barista don't like it but as a shift it'll make your job so much easier. I try to rotate my partners every two hours jobwise. You should never be on bar during peak unless it's absolutely necessary. You need to be running the play and stay front facing. You need to pull people off things and put them on others. Show some authority, you are the acting shift and their boss. They'll hate you at first until they realize that your shifts are super smooth. Then they'll get to know you as you ease off a little because they understand the job and your expectations. Then they respect and like you. It takes about 6-12 months in my opinion to get really good at the job and win over your partners. Then your shifts will be easy, you'll have a peak routine, and they'll run like clockwork. Just follow playbook and take some chances. You sound like you're having trouble anyway so throw the dice and find out what works for you within the parameters of the expectations placed on you."

I didn't have the heart to correct him, and when I was calling it out, I accidentally said flappuccino because I was still thinking about it.  S'all cool. He got his flappuccino, he liked it, and now flappuccinos are much more pleasant to make. Sometimes, I call it out as a flappuccino to people I know aren't paying attention, and it makes me feel good about myself.   Edit: I hope he comes back and orders another while I'm working.

starbucks,3cmwfa,Erick_James,5,Thu Jul 9 04:20:33 2015 UTC,"Alright! Bump everything you know about free pouring and watch this amazing video.  My tips would be when you aerate your milk is have that steaming wand barely sickout of the milk. If you are generating big bubbles then you went too far! Have the milk continuously flowing. If you have bubbles in your foam then give that steaming pitcher a good tap against the counter top.   Then free pour a decent height into the cup to get under the espresso! When it gets about 3/4 of the way up the cup then get close and tilt the steaming pitcher closer to the cup to get the micro-foam to come out and you can create that dot!   Also, the paper cups and how it is shaped makes making the fancy latte art incredibly challenging and almost impossible with our espresso, steaming pitcher, cup shape dynamic.    Keep on practicing! Eventually you will get the hang of it!"

starbucks,3cq7uh,annapie,2,Thu Jul 9 22:24:24 2015 UTC,"It's typically a local leadership decision, but most any manager in their right mind will put a candidate through two in-person interviews. There's too much at stake to risk missing something in an interview.   Perfect example: We recently had a partner quit that should have never been hired in the first place. They were constantly complaining about being required to complete physical tasks such as taking the trash out and moving floor mats so we can sweep. The problem: every partner must be able to lift 40 lbs. This person could not. But, the question was never asked by the one manager that interviewed them. Had there been a second, maybe two months of heartache could have been avoided."

At some point, a partner approached my acquaintance and asked if her mother was being properly attended. The partner said the mother had, over the last six months, been disorientated and short tempered, completely in contrast with the woman they had known for 3 years.

This location made many mistakes on our order... worst Starbucks I visited   I don't think we're that bad to mess up one order really badly, unless we misheard you (really bad speaker).  Does that really qualify us for the worst Starbucks award?   The coffee here is awful.   Should be consistent with all the other SBUX locations.    They always mix their frothing pots. If you have dairy or soy allergy, be careful.   Very true, although I suspect most stores are guilty of the same thing   The WORST Starbucks EVER!...Their customer service is extremely horrible....The drive thru is extremely slow and it takes them about 20-30 minutes just to serve 1 car.  This location is also very dirty...Worst experience we ever had at a Starbucks...I suggest they hire new management and new employees if they wish to keep their customers happy and have re-peat business...They have a really bad name and have lost a lot of business.   Ummmm, ok.  I don't think our DT times are that bad.  I mean, we are slow when it's not peak time (due to Frappuccino volumes) but not that slow.  I think our store is decent in terms of cleanliness, we scored 93% on our last inspection, I guess you come inside to avoid our realllllly slow DT.

starbucks,3clrlk,CoffeeMakingGirl,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:15:59 2015 UTC,"Sounds about right. And then they order extra of their drinks, just to be sure they won't run out during the blizzard if they absolutely positively can't get out of their driveway.   And they order beans, super just in case. And they want them ground. They buy their wife's favorite syrup, in our bottles. They also buy a French press, have you grind it for French, and then have you explain how to make French presses.  Can't be without your decaf coffee.  (Real story. Five venti decaf pourovers. Had to tear apart the back room for a pump. This transaction took over 20 minutes. There was 3 inches of snow, and he was back next morning at 6:30am.)"

starbucks,3clrlk,paigenotcasey,2,Thu Jul 9 12:12:58 2015 UTC,"Essentially, it's the score that indicates how clean your store is. The score is generated once a quarter. If you're not getting over a 95, you're probably not cleaning enough."
starbucks,3clrlk,arquebus_x,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:35:44 2015 UTC,It looks pretty clean from my perspective at least. We keep up on the café and the bars very well so our cleanliness certainly doesn't detour customers if that's what you're getting at
starbucks,3clrlk,paigenotcasey,2,Thu Jul 9 12:40:06 2015 UTC,"Inside the drains, inside the grinder, under the counters, inside the trash bins, inside the cabinets, inside the ovens, under the fridges, behind the fridges, inside the fridges, under the dish sinks, every wall surface, every ceiling vent, every window and door, every retail cubby... and so on. There's a lot more to clean than just what the customers see.  If you're not yet familiar with it, check out the Duty Roster book to see what tasks have to be completed daily, weekly and monthly. Managers should be assigning those tasks on a regular basis."
starbucks,3clrlk,arquebus_x,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:46:16 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, I've seen that book! Most of the items are routinely completed and checked off by shift from what the book says"

starbucks,3clrlk,arquebus_x,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:22:34 2015 UTC,"Well, when I was trained on Customer Support we actually did the things we could, and made the shift sign it, so I'm assuming that's always how it runs but you never do know"

starbucks,3clrlk,SweetDee123,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:45:23 2015 UTC,"This is why my manager doesn't hire summer people, and I seriously appreciate that. I personally make a list of things, and the precloser can't leave until they're all done. Stock RTD&E, condense pastry case, wipe down x counters, stock fridges, stock tea bags, stock 5lb coffee bags and cubes, stock restrooms, deep clean bar and handwashing sinks, make x backups, etc. If the precloser can't leave till they're done, then there's a huge incentive for the closer to not fuck around. I have a master list that I copy from real quick when the dinner rush is done, and put it out for them. You only need to keep people late twice before gossip takes care of it for you."
starbucks,3clrlk,alexeye,3,Thu Jul 9 04:52:14 2015 UTC,I understand joking around with partners or customers if you have a minute or two of downtime.   More than that to create a box suit of armor? Cut hours or deep clean! Time to lean? Time to clean!
starbucks,3clrlk,Oliver1307,2,Thu Jul 9 06:38:15 2015 UTC,"There's no such thing as ""down time"" at my store either, I wish there was down time to practice or experiment with drinks. Are you a cafe/DT? That's what we are. If we get a breather between waves it's seriously just long enough to restock and resupply everything we ran out of or do a trash run."
starbucks,3clrlk,Doctor_Twinkletits,2,Wed Jul 8 22:32:25 2015 UTC,"We are just a cafe. We were one of the test stores for the evenings programs. I believe we were 1 of the first 5 or so that opened 3ish years ago.  We get just enough down time to restock and start deep cleaning tasks, but that doesn't last very long.  It's good to know that are others like us. We end the day sweating and tired."
starbucks,3clrlk,daijoubudayo,2,Wed Jul 8 22:39:28 2015 UTC,My new store has so much down time that supervisors send people home early even when we reach our daily objectives. I now work 20 hours/week at most and I lose 1 or 2 hours here and there. I'd rather work at a busy store. I used to be enthusiastic about going to work; now I just don't give a fuck.
starbucks,3clrlk,gummybear47,3,Thu Jul 9 02:32:43 2015 UTC,I just finished closing my store a little while ago. We had maybe 20 transactions in the last 2 hours due to weather. We sat around doing nothing for most of that time. Bring the hate. :)

starbucks,3clrlk,wrabbit-s,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:30:16 2015 UTC,"So today was my first day at a new starbucks. And boy, was it world's different from my previous starbucks. My previous starbucks we barely even got waves... it was more like a constant tsunami, so yeah kinda waves, but never enough of a break to breathe. The store I'm at now, today it felt like forever between customers with little tiny rushes of 5 or 6 people. However, I will also say that at my previous stores, there were some shenanigans, not boxes and stuff, but dancing and singing and slight pranking."
starbucks,3clrlk,nyoomachine,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:05:19 2015 UTC,"My store is like a constant warzone. We're constantly understaffed, do more than DT/cafe transactions as only a cafe, and have a super OCD manager who constantly yells at us for the most minute things, then tries to send everyone home.  Especially on 8 hour shifts, a little orchestrated chaos needs to happen to keep sane. Personally, I draw dicks in the sink with the mocha drizzle bottle, and leave it as long as physically possible before cleaning it up. We have movable containers for our sugars/sugarless sweeteners on the condiment bar, so I switch two of them into different places. I move a chair from one table to the head of another. I'll put a receipt paper in upside-down at the end of the night. I'll turn the backup chocolate milk case for RTD upside-down, so when you go to fill it, you pick the milks up upside-down. It's the little things, but it gives me great satisfaction and doesn't hurt customer or partner. Just a tiny bit of orchestrated chaos does a soul good.  These elaborate, clearly time-consuming things, though? Their shift clearly isn't keeping close enough tabs on them, or their store is the fabled actual over labor."

starbucks,3cmchl,MaidenLocks,4,Thu Jul 9 01:17:39 2015 UTC,That sounds like a terrible system bound to create headaches for everyone involved honestly.. My SM has a binder with a few months in advance that you can schedule time off.

starbucks,3cmchl,MrBlanch,2,Thu Jul 9 01:03:28 2015 UTC,That's ridiculous. I wonder why he thinks that is a good idea. I actually took away the binder for partners to write in their own requests because there were way too many surprises. There is always the partner that will fill out dates way in advance - just in case which hurts everyone else. Now partners have to talk to me about it and then I write it in my planner. I rarely say no- I will do all that I can to give them their time off. But those that knwo their time off way in advance are way more guaranteed.
starbucks,3cmchl,brokenelk,2,Thu Jul 9 12:57:13 2015 UTC,"Every weekend through October is filled up in our book. Partners just take random weekends off because they don't feel like working; the people who really need off for actual events (read: me), end up not getting off which sucks."
starbucks,3cmchl,Colerd1,3,Thu Jul 9 15:41:55 2015 UTC,Totally. I agree. That's why I took away the book and they need to talk to me for time off. It has reduced the number of requests by about half. And guaranteed those who need the time off get it.

starbucks,3cmchl,mikesxrs,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:50:48 2015 UTC,My manager is pretty organized about stuff like that. He plunks it into a time table on his computer so we can pretty much request any day off for the current year. It's nice.

starbucks,3ck6ya,Bellacide,8,Wed Jul 8 16:20:09 2015 UTC,"There is actually a point to steaming cold brew. When cold brew is brewed using a long steep time, it actually allows the flavors to come out of the coffee without as much bitterness or acidity. When coffee is brewed with hot water, this naturally comes out of the bean. When cold press is steamed, the neutral flavor remains, but is now a deliciously hot cup of coffee."

Maybe it's supposed to be part of training, but that doesn't mean it is in practice.   I'm extremely hesitant to believe that   One instance of this from /u/sn7v:   BRM (EMEA) says rosettas only, if I make a flat white without a rosetta I make it again!

This is more or less my entire point, and is a totally different animal from what you'd initially said. As I said, it is part of the training. It's on barista trainers to make it happen, just because they don't doesn't magically make it not a part of the training proper. Again, it's up to the trainer to make it happen, not corporate; they've done their part.   I'm not sure what your point is here:   Pretty simple; if in fact they are required to make them that way (and I'm still hesitant to take the word of one random redditor over another), then obviously they will be trained on doing so, they'd have to be, so it's not really worth bringing them up."

I believe I've read here that in some countries or stores, rosettas are required.   That was an argument for requiring rosettas; it ensures quality microfoam, and stores in other countries supposedly do it already. My point was that a rosetta requires a certain quality of microfoam, and if you make rosettas a requirement, you're pretty much guaranteed to have good microfoam."
starbucks,3ciizw,tifucomments,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:21:53 2015 UTC,"This is affected by the same issue. Proper microfoam is, once again, part of the training. Whether you try and teach it with a Rosetta or any other method, it's still up to the trainer to make it happen."

So, would you say they are required to make proper microfoam? Then doesn't that mean...   if in fact they are required to make them that way... then obviously they will be trained on doing so, they'd have to be   While I agree training compliance is one of the issues, I think it's a separate issue. The issue I was focusing on is that some people think their foam is good just because they can make a dot. If you use dots as a quality check, you're using a lousy standard. They might think they're complying to the milk steaming standard when they're actually not. If you use rosettas as a quality check, you have a better shot, as it implies that you know what to look for in good microfoam. Obviously, it's best if you just know what good microfoam is, but a rosetta seems like a good way of achieving that.  From the very start, I said I had trouble finding baristas who even know what good microfoam is. Requiring rosettas just seems like a good way to ensure proper microfoam training; it mitigates the problem of baristas not even knowing what good microfoam is."
starbucks,3ciizw,tifucomments,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:08:24 2015 UTC,"So, would you say they are required to make proper microfoam? Then doesn't that mean...   No... I would say what's been said all along, that it's a mandatory part of training. And just like it's a mandatory part of training, but still doesn't happen consistently, making Rosettas a mandatory part of training won't make it happen consistently either.  Having it be a part of training, and having it be the standard for presentation are, as I said before, two different animals. So, if you're changing your premise, then yes, having Rosetta's as the standard for presentation would likely increase foam quality across the board."

starbucks,3ci53a,SaltyBarista,9,Wed Jul 8 03:38:59 2015 UTC,"I went to Anime Expo in LA this past weekend, and made the Starbucks next to the LA Convention Center (LA Live) my breakfast, lunch, and dinner for most days. Now LA isn't very hot, but it is warmer than usual around this time (~75°F) so they had a lot of frappuccinos to make. With three partners on POS, their line still almost went out the door sometimes.. I felt for them.  PS: anyone know if that particular Starbucks is a licensed or corporate location? My discounts worked, but I never got my stars."

starbucks,3ci53a,Pellantana,2,Wed Jul 8 04:40:25 2015 UTC,"So I'm a regular at a Sbux here in San Diego. I got chatting today with one of the partners and he mentioned that this weekend was gonna be super shitty because of the convention, and while he was happy to have hours, they were gonna be rough ones. I got the feeling that he was asking some of us regulars to think about hitting up a store further away from downtown (this store is pretty close to the Con), and I can't fault him for wanting that. He never asked outright, but I've been going to this store enough to know the folks serving my tea pretty well for a customer/seller relationship. It was pretty easy to read that if we could turn down the sheer volume they'll be dealing with even slightly, it'd be a relief. You guys get shitty customers during regular hours; I can't imagine what kind of flack you might get because of huge events like SDCC."

The time the person came in, what happened, their name if possible. File this in an incident report and call it in. And I mean everything. Any time you have to wake someone, ask someone to leave, kick someone out of the bathroom. All of it!! Keep calling the police. Never cancel the call. The more you call, the more they will see a need in your area. It might seem pointless, but if your police deparment notices 20 to 30 calls from your location daily, they will increase patrols.   Talk to your DM. Talk to your RD. Get them to rally the officers and bring the issue to your police deparments Chief. Get the media involved if you have to. Speaking from experience, I for too long let these people dictate how my day went with their horrible, inexcusable behavior. Take a stand and don't allow them to take over your store.

Within 5-10 minutes of arriving we would inform them that the lobby is for customer use and they would either need to purchase something or we would ask them to leave. If they refused then a call to the police would be the next step. Maybe a call to PCC or RM. Let them know you don't feel safe at work. Or transfer for safety reasons.

Luckily for us, we have a lot of cops come into the store and we give them free drinks. We tried handling the homeless problem ourselves, but similar to your situation, we got threats and other things that made it a very uncomfortable place. We decided to do final warnings for all of the transients, where we'd tell them that they are disrupting the experience of paying customers, that they are no longer welcome on the property, and that we will call the police immediately if they step foot on even our patio. The police have been very supportive, especially because these transients are issues at almost all of the surrounding businesses, and it's helped a lot. We still have issues occasionally, but they are very rare now. Could you do something similar?"
starbucks,3ck8ex,kakasensei,3,Wed Jul 8 16:18:18 2015 UTC,"If Police response times are a problem, perhaps make friends with some of the responding officers and the dispatch.

starbucks,3ck8ex,meowqueen,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:13:23 2015 UTC,"This is actually a great answer.   Our store is in a crazy tourist area with tons of transients.   Now most of them just come in quietly to use the bathroom, get some water and were not only ok with that, but supportive and we want to help.   We have ZERO tolerance for being abused, used, or taken advantage of.   Our store is designed for in and out purchases with some light seating. The store literally at the other end of the block is the "" relaxed hang out store "" as we've all come to agree.   We've taken these steps:   The transients we know and that are frequent in our store usually look out for us. A few keep eyes on stealing and our DM said refills are ok even if they left and came back.   They're family and can stay as long as they need. They know the rules and what's up and most attempt to purchase something, banana, refill, just because they know they're hanging out.   The transients who are up to bad things, attempt to steal or just don't make a purchase but make a scene   Are asked to leave immediately.  Well get them a water and let them use the bathroom if they're calm but after ten minutes we encourage a purchase or to leave.   We're a private company . Why people feel that quoting rights inside of our store is beyond me.   We turned off all the outlets. Our DM approved and after watching the numbers only go up compared to the previous month and previous year, it's now a permanent decision .  We do have the power mats so that usually qwells Any concern from actual patrons . This is also very rare to hear a complaint about....  Actually let me fix that statement. It's rare to hear it from paying customers.   The people who come in with no intention of buying and Soley want to charge a device  complain. We explain that a four minute walk to the next block will yield a Starbucks with tons of outlets.   The police at least for us, come in all the time. We've been approved to right now recovery their basic coffees and lattes. In turn, they hang out for a while and I'm telling you, the amount of people who clear out when they show up is surprising.   We're assertive but fair. We talk with our DM regularly and he has an open mind and approves fair actions that still fit into the Starbucks mission statement.   Our store is super small yet super busy , outdoing most store in the area and sometimes the district.   Talk with your DM, your SM, Your ASM and come up with ways everyone can agree on and standardize these policies with all the shifts and baristas.   We've had a huge problem with transients cashing out gift cards and in the state of California it's technically legal.   Again, we reviewed the law and adhere to it while also using the policies within that law to protect our store and honestly, to show them that were not a bank nor can they assume that walking in with 10 ""ten dollar"" cards is ok to do , especially during a rush.   Find ways that adhere to the plan. Be assertive and take action. Call non emergency and try to set up with local law enforcement a random drive by to check in on the store. It can definitely help as a deterrent and what cop is going to turn down a chance at a free cup of joe ?  Hope this helps."
starbucks,3ck8ex,TerryYockey,2,Thu Jul 9 11:02:40 2015 UTC,"I had a similar situation at a store that I previously worked at. Honestly from my experience there is no way to get rid of them completely, but the best you can do is make it more of an inconvenience for the people causing the problems than it is worth it for them to be there.   I was the ASM at this location and I did this by constantly enforcing the no sleeping in the lobby policy (wake them but don't touch them), and if they refused to stay awake and wouldn't leave, I would call the police. Sometimes several times a day. I also enforced no smoking on the patio, and forced anyone trying to get free water at the end of the bar to wait in line.   My biggest issues at my store were the people that were either disruptive or were loitering and sleeping. These wandering types DEFINITELY talk amongst themselves, I saw a drastic reduction in the number of them that would come to my store within about a month.   I'm not at the store anymore but my next steps were going to be to enforce the ""lobby for customers only"". This takes more SM backup than anything, but if you have someone who is hanging around your store for hours on end, you can go let them know that your seating area is for patrons of your location. This gets a little difficult because I know we have customers that also camp out.   Basically just take advantage of local law enforcement, call them as often as you have reason, even if it's just someone asleep in your lobby. Don't allow someone to come in your store with bags on bags of luggage, etc etc.   I felt like a crazy person going after them with all of this, but I started to see results and my store was a safer place to be. Good luck!"

A pastry 2 hours past its expiration date would still be edible, but I'm still not going to sell it. Syrup opened for 32 days would still be fine, but I'm gonna toss it at its 30 day expiration date.

And also, customers will always find a reason to complain--and how you said about ""from a corporate point of view"" I believe it makes better business sense to sell that cold brew rather then dump it. If I worked at that store I'd much rather deal with a customer complaining with, ""This CBIC is not exactly the same as that other Starbucks."" rather then. ""Why don't you have Cold Brew, every store should have it? Oh you dumped it?!! I'm calling corporate!"" And that's if they actually go to other Starbucks and try their Cold Brew which is a bit unlikely."
starbucks,3clzaz,xrotfuchs,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:40:58 2015 UTC,We can agree to disagree. I just know that my DM would instruct me to dump it out if it went over the 20 hour time.

starbucks,3cj6vu,baristamuffin,3,Wed Jul 8 09:28:03 2015 UTC,"To my understanding, when brewing coffee measured by weight the caffeine content is the same. Although coffee roasted darker does lose some of the caffeine, it's not enough to to make a dark roast have less caffeine than, say, a blonde roast. Our drip coffee has 20mg of caffeine per ounce for all our coffees brewed in the bunn digital brewer. I'm not sure how much caffeine our coffees have when done in the French press, however. I would assume it would be the same.   Also, a few years ago corporate send out a barista-need-to-know dispelling certain ""myths"" about our coffees and whatnot. Among them was the common misconception that lighter roasts have  more caffeine than darker ones and also that ""French Vanilla"" (vanilla/hazelnut) wasn't really ""French Vanilla"".  I did a little googling on the side and apparently it's true that lighter roasts don't have more or less caffeine than darker ones. The important thing to note is that that only applies when you measure the coffee by weight. Blonde roast is roasted lighter, meaning the beans themselves contain more moisture than a darker roast because the more you roast the more moisture is lost as a result of the actual roasting. So, basically, a blonde roast would require less beans to meet 20 grams than a darker roast (think of a pound of blonde roast and a pound of Italian roast, the Italian seems to be bigger because it requires more beans to equal the same weight)   I hope I was able to explain that well enough to understand."
starbucks,3cj6vu,_broske,2,Wed Jul 8 09:52:17 2015 UTC,"Basically this. All I would add is that your caffeine content depends on which method you use to measure out your coffee for your French press. If you use the scale method (by weight) then it'll be the same caffeine. If you use the Starbucks scoopie, then it'll be more caffeine the blonder it is."
starbucks,3cj6vu,haydenj96,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:36:22 2015 UTC,"Wait, which Starbucks scoopie? The teal-handled spoodle is smaller; are you talking about the little plastic one that comes with the French press?"
starbucks,3cj6vu,monkeyeighty8,2,Wed Jul 8 15:35:01 2015 UTC,"That teal spoodle is smaller for just this reason. By using the smaller one, you end up with the same weight of beans as the big one. If you're making a press and using the 2 tbsp scoop, there is a difference, but it's negligible."

Short of them stealing money or time they won't care. If your store makes enough money they won't care. I tried to at the very least get my manager looked at more closely with a lot of documentation. They didn't care, and it ruined my reputation. And I wasn't just a Barista with a complaint. I was a high performing shift that was at the tail end of development to ASM after three years. Guess what I am now? A so so shift bec I don't give a shit with no hope for promotion straight out of the mouth of my dm. Remember, if your manager sucks it makes your dm look really bad. They aren't going to hang themselves for you, or for 20 partners. My advice to you would be to transfer and try your luck elsewhere.

starbucks,3cjieo,Ihatefrappuccinos,5,Wed Jul 8 15:56:34 2015 UTC,"I agree with u/trapdoordoll. We had an SM who was caught on video walking out of the store with register drawers, turning off all the back room lights and disappearing for about 30 minutes with another partner (they were both married), favoring said partner while basically harassing the other SSs verbally and giving them clopens all the time, she would write people up for really minor stuff - like having your shirt come untucked, she never gave partners their reviews so when I got to the store everyone was still at minimum pay, and she would take partners off the schedule  for several weeks as a form of discipline for things like being 2 minutes late one time, etc. A shift brought it up and he was given the option of transferring to a different store but he would need to step down.  They don't fire SM's - I've only seen it happen once and it was after several months of an SM engaging in serious behavior that included stalking a partner who had a restraining order against them. So basically unless you have an open/close lawsuit with the company on your hands I would spend your time looking for a different store to work at."
starbucks,3cjieo,sbuxreddit,2,Wed Jul 8 14:45:55 2015 UTC,"If the store profits then your SM will stay no matter how awful they are, and let me tell you there are plenty of stores that are so self sufficient that even a bad team or bad manager or mix of the two cannot kill their business. Around January we had an espresso machine go down permanently for a week. We are talking a 60-70k a week store, busiest/second busiest in my district. The next week the other one went down. 20 minute DT times, had to close the DT during peak every day for a week, lost a few thousand dollars those days from peak. Whatever. As soon as the machines were finally back up our business went right back to normal, making 40k easily during off season. Manager at this store doesn't seem to care about her staffs wellbeing, doesn't respond to our feedback or ideas, has left the store on her lunch break with no shift around to go to her house.   My current store is slower but profited heavily off of the Clover for a long time, the Clover broke for a couple of weeks... it has been a month or so since it has been back up and we still have not recovered even a portion of that business. The closest reserve store is a 20 minute drive and toll bridge away. This manager just had a dang baby and our DM is having her run this store and the store that rivals my old store as the busiest in the district, and she is still a great manager.   Guess which manager is the DM fave and which one is catching all kinds of shit from the DM for the tiniest stuff?  I've seen it with this company and with the last company I worked for. Same kind of situation at the old company and myself and a few coworkers DID call our version of PCC on her for serious stuff.

starbucks,3ciuel,afyvarra,2,Tue Jul 14 03:00:21 2015 UTC,"We also free pour for Flat Whites. As far as I know, we're still allowed to use the spoons. I think we only free pour for other drinks if we want to try our hand at latte art. I could be wrong though. I'm in a licensed store, so we kind of get no notice about the outside world..."
starbucks,3ciuel,gummybear47,2,Wed Jul 8 19:04:29 2015 UTC,"What it is, is just free pour in general or standard is for cappuccinos and flat whites, but they are becoming more loose with the standards (not all stores, in fact some get angry)."
starbucks,3ciuel,xrotfuchs,4,Thu Jul 9 01:46:25 2015 UTC,"The training materials for the flat white stated that all handcrafted hot milk beverages could be free poured now, as long as you are not giving people cappuccinos when they ask for lattes or putting too much foam on your mochas. If you steam your milk correctly, you can free pour every beverage with the exception of bone dry cappuccinos and no foam drinks."

starbucks,3ciuel,Wanderlust2828,4,Thu Jul 9 18:48:47 2015 UTC,"1+2 Yup 3. Classic should have a black pump on it and yes they get full pumps. 4. Just learned that the TOCF and CHCF actually have different recipes. But it is pumps of chai, milk to first line, ice, creme base, blend, cin on top. The pump amounts are on the POS. I think its 1,2,2 for CHCF and 2,3,4 for TOCF?? 5. My store has a great training cup to practice cappuccinos, it is clear and shows you how much  milk vs foam you are getting when you free pour. It really helps if you can order one. 6. We have this argument ALL THE TIME. They need to clarify this for partners.   We have been trying to figure out if a customer adds protein to the new EF smoothies, is it one scoop or two as standard? Anyone know?"
starbucks,3ciuel,calicotrinket,3,Wed Jul 8 07:25:30 2015 UTC,Can I clarify about 1)? So we're supposed to steam milk extra hot for mocha and WM?
starbucks,3ciuel,Dopetruffles,3,Wed Jul 8 18:21:00 2015 UTC,"Just saying, in the mastrena training video in my learning it specifically says DO NOT STEAM TO EXTRA HOT UNLESS THE CUSTOMER REQUESTS SO.

starbucks,3ciuel,teenagerOz,0,Wed Jul 8 10:20:11 2015 UTC,"Wait, you measure the chai in the cup with the milk?!?!!"
starbucks,3ciuel,Shallow-Believer,5,Wed Jul 8 11:43:14 2015 UTC,No. This was debated at my store and we checked and the recipe card says milk to the bottom line pour it in blender and then add chai.
starbucks,3ciuel,austinbucco,2,Wed Jul 8 13:22:12 2015 UTC,Another question: in an upside down CM does the caramel sauce go on top or on the bottom?
starbucks,3ciuel,Dopetruffles,2,Fri Jul 10 02:44:44 2015 UTC,Great question! I'm not really sure. I've always just done it on top unless requested otherwise.
starbucks,3ciuel,DViddy,-1,Fri Jul 10 05:39:05 2015 UTC,"1 - I don't believe we warm any milk to XH unless it's specifically requested.   2 - Sounds about right. WM, M, CB, etc. Shots get poured straight into cup and usually not shot glasses to maximize syrup mixing. Giving it a good swirl helps that, too.   3 - I believe the 1/2/2 still applies to CL for these when using regular bar pumps, and 2/3/4 for CBS pumps.   4 - 1/2/2 for chai/TOC frappuccinos. Also, measure it like a syrup, not like FR.   5 - Depends on the customer. If they want bone dry, often scooping is your best bet. I prefer to start shots before I start my milk for most standard cappuccinos and aerate for most of the time the milk is steaming. Keeping the steam wand in the perfect spot in the milk pitcher creates denser foam by popping those big bubbles, which is good on any drink.   6 - Yes, typically a small amount of foam is acceptable under WC. For no foam, always steam the size up from the drink ordered and hold the foam back.  This is what I've found to work best for me and I honestly haven't had a drink returned for ""not tasting right"" in years. Most of these specifics are more for inventory purposes than taste purposes anyway, but in training they do specify the 1/2/2 for any non-CBS pump syrups. Otherwise frappuccinos get way too sweet. If you make it with the 1/2/2 recipe and the customer mentions it doesn't taste as sweet as it normally does, mention you're following the recipe closer and from now on they may like it better ordering ""an extra pump of syrup,"" and go from there. Consistency is key, across all stores! Good luck with training :)"
starbucks,3ciuel,j4ck1e,7,Wed Jul 8 07:28:58 2015 UTC,"The STCF and the GTF get full pumps of classic, they and the TOC are the only drinks that break the 1/2/2 bar pumps rule.   Chai and TOC frappuccinos have different recipes- the Chai is 1/2/2, the TOC is 2/3/4 to create a ""spicier"" taste."
starbucks,3ciuel,gummybear47,9,Wed Jul 8 07:35:56 2015 UTC,"sauces are ""steamed to the higher end of the steam range 150-170"" so yes, HIT EXTRA HOT"
starbucks,3ciuel,xrotfuchs,4,Wed Jul 8 14:01:36 2015 UTC,"My manager said it was because the sauce consistency when paired with the whip cream lowers the over all drink temperature below standard, so to keep it at standard we steam higher for drink with both sauce and whipped cream."
starbucks,3ciuel,Dopetruffles,2,Thu Jul 9 01:48:21 2015 UTC,"You should also be steaming extra hot for no whip mochas.    If you have a free moment, make a mocha at regular temp with no whip and throw a thermometer in it. You'll see that the drink cools down to about 145 because of the heat it takes to melt the sauce."
starbucks,3ciuel,DaBucks,5,Thu Jul 9 06:19:40 2015 UTC,"Also, pour cappuccinos from the side of the pitcher, which allows more foam into the cup. Can't remember if that's covered as much in training."
starbucks,3ciuel,NipplesConPanna,3,Wed Jul 8 07:30:57 2015 UTC,Yes. I always do this and show partners and their minds are blown. Makes much better capps this way.

I can tell you that during winter promo when we use the red cups, they (corporate) specifically say to put away the extra stock of white cups on the day of the launch and start using the red cups immediately.

It was actually one of our veteran partner's fault in that she didn't know how to make it before.  She only added 7 liters in the bag. . . talk about a gigantic tea bag disaster.
starbucks,3chio4,SweetDee123,1 point,Wed Jul 8 06:47:09 2015 UTC,"Someone ripped the filter bag on our second brewing, so we lost everything. Then, when it was dumped in the sink, it backed up the floor drain and we ended up with a lovely, coffee-scented mudslide that is not yet fully cleaned up."
starbucks,3ci163,SilverFloo10088,5,Wed Jul 8 01:49:54 2015 UTC,"The back of the card just says you get a sticker for buying a 16 oz. iced coffee or iced tea. My SM said we give out stickers based on # of drinks, not transactions, and that we will give them out for grande or larger! Doesn't include iced lattes, americanos,... that sort of thing. I think it's a little unclear though myself."

Iced teas/tea lemonades (I really don't know about iced tea lattes), iced coffee (including cold brew). I'm pretty sure it's not for refreshers but my SM said to do it anyways. We're also doing grande or bigger, but when they're redeemed it'll just be for grande size."
starbucks,3ci163,boredatwork87,3,Wed Jul 8 03:19:01 2015 UTC,"That seems reasonable, makes no sense to discourage people from getting a bigger size than grande. I also gave them for iced teas lattes today, mainly chai since it doesn't say anything about lattes specifically."

starbucks,3ci163,cpo5d,2,Wed Jul 8 02:54:00 2015 UTC,"It's part of the Summer 2 promotion, to increase iced drink sales I think. Every time you get an iced tea/coffee (maybe refresher?) you get a sticker, collect 5 and the 6th one is free."
starbucks,3ci163,josborn94,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:52:54 2015 UTC,Neat! Thanks for the info. Follow up question: I grew up in a country where we ate mangoes straight from trees. Am I going to like the mango syrup or should I pass on it and stick to 2 pumps of peach in my trenta BTL?
starbucks,3ci163,cpo5d,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:36:10 2015 UTC,"As someone who also grew up eating fresh mangos, I find that the mango syrup is sweeter, and not as full bodied compared to a fresh mango. Since you only get two pumps of peach in a trenta, I would try the same amount of mango pumps. If you don't like it, I'm sure the barista who made it would be more than willing to make your usual."

starbucks,3cgiix,purplenightsky,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:43:09 2015 UTC,You can order cold brew with milk just like you can order iced coffee with milk. You just have to specify.

starbucks,3cgiix,MadameCurry,3,Wed Jul 8 00:28:02 2015 UTC,"The Toddy makes 4 pitchers, diluting it would make 8 pitchers. Don't know about your store, but we have neither the pitchers nor the room for that."

starbucks,3cgiix,Wonderground,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:23:58 2015 UTC,"I'm more frustrated with the baristas (a shift, no less) who does not care about the ""No CBIC without Water"" rule.

Corporate can give that customer $10 for the ""trouble."" Corporate can tell your SMs or DMs or whatever, but if you are following the policy that you were given to follow explicitly, then you will not get in trouble.  If you say yes because you also want to avoid trouble is one thing. If you say yes because fuck the rules, then you're actively making things difficult for your partners."

They're not going to fire you for saying ""I'm sorry, but I don't feel comfortable bringing the milk to such a dangerous temperature, especially since it's against corporate standards.""  Also, if you steam it to 185 and tell the customer it's at 190, they're not going to fucking know.  Trust me."
starbucks,3cfp1j,adamrobertt,6,Tue Jul 7 15:43:38 2015 UTC,"There was actually one troublesome customer who had a sixth sense about when the milk was less than 200 degrees. She must have had a mouth made of leather. Every time I'd make it to 185, she would send it back. We weren't allowed to tell her to kindly fuck off when she had a hissy fit (when I was there, I told her over the speaker that 185 was the maximum temp and was quickly shut down by the shift on duty). People who refused her were ""coached"" to allow it.   What happened with my friend is that another barista was using her bar to stream it and knocked the pitcher over on her. These kinds of things make me glad I got out, but it sure as hell isn't fair to the partners still in the fray."

If ANYONE tells you to break that policy starbucks is liable, they must do a new audit, a new saftey sheet, new training plan, and sooooo much more to change that policy.   So yeah if they are risking your safety they can all be fired.  Your customer can find a new spot.  SOURCE: Dad does safety audits for starbucks."

starbucks,3cfp1j,velogirl,3,Tue Jul 7 15:46:19 2015 UTC,"I mean, when we had the old Verismo machines they still had an automatic shutoff at the same temperature, they just didn't have a readout on the screen so we had to use thermometers in the pitchers.

Nope.  I'll make their drinks tho. You want me to take trash out the back door at 9pm? You can do it your damn self.  When I hear customers asking for temps over 185 I usually intervene & tell the customer we can't.  One time I even showed a woman how the milk explodes when it gets too hot and she still insisted that the other starbucks can do it.  I told her they just say they can do it and steam to like 170.

starbucks,3cglbs,5Rupees,2,Wed Jul 8 01:20:07 2015 UTC,Shut. Up.   Really? I can get one thing (let's say for the sake of argument it's a cold brew because I'm not a bad person trying to steal pennies) and after that I can get an iced tea instead of more coffee?
starbucks,3cglbs,sovexing,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:04:44 2015 UTC,"Correct me if I'm wrong, as long as you're a gold card memeber, you can get a free refill on hot tea, iced tea no lemonade, hot brewed coffee and brewed iced coffee. I'm assuming cold brew is included because technically it's brewed. Also, it does not matter what your previous drink was. I'm not sure if you're a customer or partner, but I would just be polite about it with any baristas. The reason I say that is because the newer ones might not know about this policy. Some of my shift supervisors didn't even know. When all else fails, Starbucks website can answer it."
starbucks,3cglbs,5Rupees,2,Sun Jul 12 00:58:16 2015 UTC,"I'm a customer with a gold card, and I often avail myself of my free refills. I have a regular starbucks where the partners are awesome as fuck and I tell them that all the time. I'm the honest customer that comes with her travel cup and coffee from home and tells them it's not a refill for my first cup. The idea that I can get a refill of something other than what I originally paid for feels like stealing because of the price difference and it never occurred to me that it's something that's allowed, rather than a cheat people do to save pennies."
starbucks,3cglbs,sovexing,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:40:38 2015 UTC,"You seem like a loyal, honest customer.. you shouldn't feel like a thief, after all.. it is Starbucks policy/benefit of being a gold member."

starbucks,3cglbs,Galiphile,1 point,Wed Jul 8 06:01:33 2015 UTC,The refills are supposed to be the same size as the original drink if im not mistaken. So you couldn't get a refill if you just got espresso then right? I've never been asked. I suppose you could get a short hot coffee refill?

starbucks,3chnf5,sassybri,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:07:32 2015 UTC,I can't speak to specifics because pricing does vary a bit by region. I believe any items affected by the price increase have gone up 5-15¢.

This website is accessible anywhere, but some actions can only be changed at the store on their BOH computer! Your pay statements are in there and you can print them off and keep them for your records, and make sure you're keeping track of your hours! If something gets messed up its always great that you can say 'no, I worked these days and hours, why am I not getting paid for such!'  As for breaks it is dependent on where you live and the labour laws. Where I live, any shift that is 2-5 hours in length gets a 15 minute break, 5-6.75 hours gets a 15 and a full meal break (half hour, unpaid) and between 6.75 and 8 you tack on an extra 15 minute break to those."

As far as bodily fluids go, they can't make you clean that as a regular barista since it's a biohazard. If the manager doesn't want to clean it, they'd better call somebody in.

It was then when it finally dawned on her that's why they go straight to the bathroom.

starbucks,3ce2qk,clynch96,14,Tue Jul 7 04:48:30 2015 UTC,"I can ring/write faster then stickers. There's a lot of nonsense orders at my store that you just can't ring up in general and therefore wouldn't get printed with specificity. With writing, you could order whatever and I'd jot it down. My partner on bar never as to come to me for explanations for anything, ever. I can just focus on the customer ordering and not have to deal with two conversations at once. Not having to type in long names helps too.  Beyond that, I help organize the drinks on bar and if there's something fast like ice coffee, iced chai, Americano, etc. I'll just keep the cup and make it in ten seconds. When I work at neighboring stores that use stickers, I don't have as much freedom. There's definite pluses to stickers but handwriting makes more sense to me."
starbucks,3ce2qk,tetsuo9000,12,Tue Jul 7 05:32:47 2015 UTC,"Not sure why they would backtrack like that, maybe their machine broke, but writing cups helps to keep the customer experience more personal."

starbucks,3ce2qk,stewedyeti,3,Tue Jul 7 05:14:47 2015 UTC,"It's not less efficient because using the stickers creates a huge bottleneck at the sticker printer. At my store, the printer handles both DT and cafe orders, meaning that the only way the constant deluge of stickers could be efficient is if there was someone who only had the task of pulling the stickers and placing them on cups (and refilling the rolls several times a day). There's also the annoying thing where front register partner doesn't type names in, so the stickers look like they're intended for DT and thus get grabbed by the barista handling DTO and sit by the window while the cafe customer waits an extra 10-15 minutes for a drink that's been finished that whole time."
starbucks,3ce2qk,totally_jawsome,2,Tue Jul 7 11:01:28 2015 UTC,They go back and forth. When I started it was all stickers. Then for like 6 months we wrote on cafe cups. Now we're back to stickers. I liked writing on cups :(

starbucks,3ce2qk,nickmc1,3,Tue Jul 7 05:09:36 2015 UTC,"A lot of people won't ask for names unless there's a large amount of customers all waiting for drinks.   Generally if you'd be the only person there or there was maybe two others, I can keep the drink connected to who it's going to mentally while I make it and the two other's drinks. When there gets to be a line, names come hugely in handy for not confusing customers who order slightly different drinks. We (as baristas) don't get scolded for not using names, though it does create a more personal connection with our customers.   Sorry that got kinda long."

starbucks,3ce2qk,velogirl,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:47:31 2015 UTC,"We just went back to doing this. My SM says its 1) to make things more personal, and 2) to make your drink orders more exact. Also, it helps to have the distinction so we don't hand off drinks to cafe when they're meant for DT, and vice versa."

What he is doing is completely unfair and honestly from the story you are telling me it seems like he does not even know how to manage a store. If you do not do anything about it, then there's always going to be a new issue and he will take advantage of everyone in the store because he know he can get away with it. You need to stand up for whats right. Bring up every issue you have with the SM to your DM.

starbucks,3cdsok,velogirl,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:47:12 2015 UTC,What do you do when you're running around grabbing food and what not? Are you required to talk in front of the camera?
starbucks,3cdsok,KBewts,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:10:28 2015 UTC,"I turn the camera off, personally. When I have the time, I stand in front of it."
starbucks,3cdsok,velogirl,2,Tue Jul 7 18:16:09 2015 UTC,We have a camera that looks right into their car at the box lol.
starbucks,3cdsok,ghettobruja,2,Tue Jul 7 23:49:09 2015 UTC,"Mine does! I honestly don't know what we'd do without it. When a car approaches the box, all partners wearing a headset get a ding. The person taking the calls does their speech ""welcome to starbucks blah blah"" but sometimes a person has driven past the box, or its the back of the truck that just ordered, or a person walked too close to it or- more often than you'd think a person will sit their with their window up and then when they roll it down expect you to know they're ready ""HELLO? I NEED SERVICE HERE"" OR they spend 5+ minutes getting the order from everyone in the car without even replying to the person that greeted them. Basically, if we didn't have a camera, we'd spend half our time talking to air, and then other time talking to people who are too rude to acknowledge that you're trying to talk to them.  BUT, since we have the camera, we can see if it was a drive by, if someone is turned away, if their window is up, if they aren't close enough to the box, etc. In addition to the listed above, customers use a lot of hand motions to indicate what they want. They also do a lot of nodding and taking to us with their face in their lap. Reading lips is also really helpful when it comes to taking orders. As for two way cameras, they are only used in rush, when the DTO is planted.  End Rant.  TL;DR: A camera may seem intrusive, but it's got a super low quality picture and without it taking people's orders would be over 100x more difficult."

starbucks,3ccizu,YouthD,7,Mon Jul 6 21:52:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's fine.  They can get unlimited refills on hot water anyway, so it's not any different really.   Tea is way overpriced compared to the price of the bag."
starbucks,3ccizu,Bean_Queen,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:38:07 2015 UTC,"Don't have too much hate, but I was told during training to always charge for a grande tea in a venti cup.  It makes sense because a venti cup is free and extra hot water is free.  IDK bit that's what we were told."
starbucks,3ccizu,zappy312,11,Mon Jul 6 21:57:24 2015 UTC,"When we switched to Teavana we were explicitly told (possibly just in my district but I thought it was company wide) that we charge for the size of the drink. Venti's cost more than grande's even though they're the exact same ingredients, and if someone wants a grande or a venti with one bag that we charged for the correct size and give the second bag on the side.  We usually just explain 'oh that size comes with two tea bags, so feel free to bring this one back and we can make you another yes free of charge or you can try it at home!'"
starbucks,3ccizu,boredatwork87,3,Mon Jul 6 23:30:26 2015 UTC,That was the policy when grande got one tea bag and venti got two but now they both get two so it doesn't really make too much of a difference.

starbucks,3cc083,Blipblipbloop,3,Mon Jul 6 20:05:28 2015 UTC,So at my store I've seen it as just a hot tea or as hot tea add dairy. I usually do the latter. I should start ringing them as tea lattes even if they don't want syrup?

starbucks,3cc083,Bean_Queen,2,Mon Jul 6 19:37:13 2015 UTC,"A hot tea with steamed milk is a misto and should be rang as a hot tea with add dairy.   Why would you be charged for a syrup you don't want? They removed the misto button about six years ago when they introduced the London Fog Latte, etc. and this was also the direction they gave."

starbucks,3cc083,Blipblipbloop,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:04:46 2015 UTC,If I wanted a caramel macchiato without vanilla - I would order a latte with caramel sauce.  Just like if I didn't want a Starbucks Tea Latte with classic - I would order a hot tea with added dairy.

Not only is it wrong, it's explicitly against company policy to harrass a person for their gender expression (which typically covers gender identity as well).  Might want to remind your fellow partners about the harassment clause, and bring it to the attention of your manager. Even if you do end up transferring out, they should know why... And hopefully they'll treat trans* individuals more kindly in the future!"

It's just how it works at our store. They also didn't leave a note about it in the duty roster. We found out on our own. And the half hours for close were very slow.

DT is for fast service. If you don't know what you want go in the store, we can help you with questions and recommendations there, not in DT when there are 8 cars behind you. Why you ask? Because we are timed for your entire transaction and those times are recorded and judged. The timer starts as soon as you pull up so your extended UMMMMMSS or HANG ONS are wrecking our scores. Also: Don't order pour-overs/retail coffee and get it ground. Don't go to DT with large orders or if you have 5 separate orders, come in the store so we can properly help you and give you great customer service.   2) If you are foreign and have a thick accent please forgive us if we can't understand you. I'm embarrassed when I have to ask someone to repeat themselves because I can't understand them, I feel terrible. I am not judging you or making fun of your accent AT ALL. This is especially difficult in Drive-Thru.    3) If we're sold out of your favorite food for that day, we're sorry but it's not a conspiracy against you so the attitude is unnecessary. Your food item happened to be popular that day and we're all out - there's no way of us knowing what is going to be popular outside of our regular items (cheese danish!) or if there's been a trend.  4) This may just be me as a green bean but I find it very unhelpful when you tell me all your drink alterations before the actual drink. Like ""I want a soy, no foam, 2 pump, 1 raw sugar, triple, extra hot, vanilla latte, grande"" I find the order of Size, Drink, Alterations to be much easier and I don't have to ask you again for all those special things, instead I just repeat it to confirm it.   Lastly 5) if you're watching us like a hawk at the bar and we start your drink then stop and go to the next drink, that's on purpose and a Starbucks rule. It's for efficiency and no, we did not skip your drink.    FYI: Mini Frappuccinos are only 2oz less than the Talls. Just get the tall."
starbucks,3c8byq,alexeye,8,Sun Jul 5 23:19:46 2015 UTC,"In reference to number 4, remember that you can punch in the modifiers and then go back to the drink.

It takes some getting used to, but it's really helped me at DTO to get those times down."
starbucks,3c8byq,myhighschoolnickname,2,Mon Jul 6 01:12:29 2015 UTC,I do need to get used to doing that and am working on it. I don't understand saying all the alterations before what the drink actually is.
starbucks,3c8byq,alexeye,5,Mon Jul 6 02:49:59 2015 UTC,"Remember that the proper method of ""calling"" a beverage is to read down the boxes from top to bottom. For instance, iced decaf triple grande 3 pump hazelnut whole milk light ice latte. At our store, we train our partners to call beverages properly when communicating with each other and with customers. This makes things consistent and ensures order accuracy when taking an order and handing off a beverage. So, the customers you're encountering are likely just reciting their drink in the order they've been taught."

If they don't say something like ""extra hot"" I always asked ""Is that hot or iced?"" now because I'm sick of taking the blame for their own mistake.    But one time, in the store, not DT, a girl totally admitted to not saying iced and was apologetic and called herself a dummy, etc. We had no issues remaking her drink because she acknowledged her mistake instead of blaming it on us."

And no, you don't get a refund. You know what you can get? The fuck out.  I can't think of any other place of business I've been to where a customer reaching behind the counter is tolerated. And yet there I am at work with customers reaching for stuff behind the bar and my shifts telling me not to say anything about it."
starbucks,3c8byq,SynysterSaint,8,Mon Jul 6 06:42:57 2015 UTC,Dear Starbucks customers.... please treat us like humans. I had the worst day and for the first time actually cried and considered stepping down from shift or quitting. I can't even comprehend the way I was treated today by multiple people its sickening I have never in my life treated another human the way I get treated everyday at work :-(
starbucks,3c8byq,CoffeeMakingGirl,2,Mon Jul 6 04:40:07 2015 UTC,"Fellow shift, also had my first cry day yesterday. All I can say, coming from someone with anxiety, is that it helps to laugh. Bitchy lady comes through and needs her drink NOW NOW NOW and gives you the stink eye the whole time? Gotta just smile and laugh it off. She's probably miserable in life, and you hopefully have some good partners.   I find that if you can take the time, sampling increases everyone's mood. Heat up two, and have a bite. People like that momentary rest, and my motto is we have to be familiar with our food. Customers get a sample, partners get a quick breather.   Depending on your humor, I like to keep it light at work with silly things. Last night me and the (male) closing crew, during frappy hell, calmly discussed the pros and cons of the Magic Mike movie. Building that easy atmosphere behind the bar and keeping it light when stupid customers come through has saved my hide a few stressful shifts."

There aren't really any accommodation requests for pregnancy unless you are having a complication.

starbucks,3cbd2h,mstrandquist8,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:10:45 2015 UTC,"You call and give them your due date and that way you can have all the paperwork sent up for your tentative leave but you have 2 weeks after the baby is born to get everything in. And honestly, the dr office does most of it. You just have to drop the final paperwork in the mail. Call partner contact center and they will connect you with sedgewick, our leave company. They walk you through everything."
starbucks,3cbd2h,mstrandquist8,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:59:35 2015 UTC,Hm okay. I guess I just need to call PCC. I have a midwife so no doctor to help with paperwork from what I know... :/
starbucks,3cbd2h,EspressoCat,3,Tue Jul 7 02:01:52 2015 UTC,"Well as a midwife they should still be able to fill out all of the required paperwork. It's just saying whether you had a natural birth or c section and if any other extenuating circumstances will need to extend your leave. You get 6 weeks disability for natural and 8 weeks for c section.  (This is in IL, it's a state by state basis.) You have to have your care providers signature and information either way."
starbucks,3cbd2h,mstrandquist8,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:05:45 2015 UTC,Wow I still can not believe how little time off you get when you have a baby in the states. In Canada everyone is entitled to 1 year off.

starbucks,3cbd2h,Ohdannie,2,Tue Jul 7 13:46:39 2015 UTC,You are allowed to wear some stretch clothing. See the partner handbook for specifics. You could ask your manager or PCC to have an extra break during your shift. Make sure you are aware of the FMLA and whether you are eligible.
starbucks,3cbd2h,wittyknitter,2,Mon Jul 6 16:56:49 2015 UTC,I worked up until the day I gave birth. I asked my store manager to not schedule me for to many 8 hour days and all of my partners were very helpful and my shift almost never asked me to run the trash. No one really let me lift anything to heavy. As for your leave call sedwick and get are very helpful.

I don't remember any particular coping methods other than just trudging through my day, I did black Friday at  7.5 months along. I wore a larger Polo shirt than usual and a maternity compression tank (from target) under. When I was pregnant with my second I invested in a support belt that had pockets in the back that I put ice packs in so I didn't collapse from heat stroke. I didn't go in leave until my due date with my first (she was a week late anyways and I had no real risks in my pregnancy) and I left one week before my due date with my second and used up some vacation pay (he was also a week late)"

So if we wanted to be jerks we could tell people that the new promo stuff wasn't available until 4am. Usually we would start serving it once we changed the menu boards over and that would happen around 10pm or 11pm."

starbucks,3cb466,Soldus,3,Mon Jul 6 15:54:17 2015 UTC,Congrats! Frappuccinos really aren't that bad on their own. In my experience they're only extra annoying because people order them in large amounts (usually in the drive thru too). What really bugs me about them though is how it can mess with my flow on bar. But don't go in with that mentality! Frappuccinos are our most expensive drinks and customers deserve us making them well and with care.
starbucks,3cb466,chunkbaby,3,Mon Jul 6 15:44:51 2015 UTC,Frappuccinos are the most labor intensive drinks that we have to make. That is why partners dont like making them.
starbucks,3cb466,antonb111,2,Mon Jul 6 15:26:37 2015 UTC,"I dislike making frappuccinos because I'm a nerd and reeeeeally like steaming milk. Like, I get super excited when someone gets a flat white and they tell me I did a good job. It feels more gratifying than scooping ingredients into a blender and pressing a button. As far as getting started, don't feel bad about asking questions! Partners at my store have made comments about how I'm always so interested in learning new things. It might sound silly now, and become tedious later, but always try to follow standards! Besides the sense of knowing you're doing the right thing, you'll be more likely to come out on top when a customer tries to tell you how to do your job, or when you get a visit from QASA. Regarding customers...that can be tough. You'll get people you look forward to seeing, and then there will be the ones who live solely to plague your existence. You'll learn it in training, but always assume positive intent. Sometimes, explaining a drink to an unpleasant customer to help them get what they want can be a really positive for both of you. Other times they'll continue to treat you like garbage, but hey, we do what we can. Take note of what other partners at your store do to be efficient while still upholding quality. Study the POS when you have down time. Learn the locations of the buttons, which are grouped by type of drink and in alphabetical order. Have someone explain to you how to use the quantity button for multiple gift cards, and how to reload a Starbucks card and pay for drinks in one transaction. The rest will fall into place, and there's always this sub for help! Good luck, and have fun!"
starbucks,3cb466,LyraVega02,2,Tue Jul 7 03:32:22 2015 UTC,"I don't mind making frappuccinos. During those hot days when people are ordering thirty cold drinks straight, I fall into a zen and just keep pumping em out."

starbucks,3c7hxp,kakasensei,1 point,Mon Jul 6 06:29:59 2015 UTC,"Whips, dishes, at least one trash run, basic lobby maintenance (I often come in and the lobby is trashed), sandwiches brought to front of house fridge, backup mocha, caramel bottles, or frap roast. stuff that's easy for them to prep while they have more people. the morning crew never bothers to prep even the most basic of things for the closing crew. When I open I usually have a lot of prep done, the brewing station sanitized (with pregrounds for the night!) already done, and pumps (mocha/SKM, WM, CH, TOC) cleaned if possible."
starbucks,3c7hxp,baaarista,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:19:05 2015 UTC,do you guys have midshift?
starbucks,3c7hxp,kakasensei,29,Sat Jul 11 04:28:43 2015 UTC,"That's rough, the morning crew at my store is the same way. Just try to keep your chin up and keep giving them awesome closes. If the worst they can complain about is whips I'd say you're already doing a great job.  Perhaps try to explain, nicely, to them that whips settle when they sit for six hours and that they really need to shake them before using them. If they still insist you're doing it wrong ask if they would prefer to make the whips in the morning?"
starbucks,3c7hxp,Tactive,6,Sun Jul 5 17:27:11 2015 UTC,I told my openers that if they though they could do a better close then I would schedule them some closing shifts.   The shifts are there to lead the store and act as coaches for the team in consultation with the manager.  Not to not pick each other apart.  I will step in to correct any major issue like cash handling or pour delegation of cleaning tasks customer complaints. Everything else the shifts can discuss among themselves.
starbucks,3c7hxp,EspressoCat,21,Sun Jul 5 21:49:14 2015 UTC,This is the exact reason I schedule crazy hours from time to time.  Every couple of months (when I get tired of listening to the bitching) I put the closers on open and openers on close for one week. The bitching goes away for a while.
starbucks,3c7hxp,firecrotchriot,6,Sun Jul 5 20:31:07 2015 UTC,"This is genius, but if I tried it I'd have a mutiny."
starbucks,3c7hxp,51n,14,Sun Jul 5 21:42:08 2015 UTC,"I bitch out any partner who decides to complain about a close. I'm mostly an opening shift supervisor and for the most part I've gotten the opening baristas to stop nit picking and start seeing themselves up. It drives me up the damn wall. So now, I just look at them and say, ""So, in the time it took for you to complain about how whips/ice/backups/whatever wasn't done, you could have just done it. We don't get slammed busy for an hour or so, stop being a princess and do your job."" I get that that seems super harsh, but in my store it works for us to be sarcastic douchebags to one another. Love it. :)"
starbucks,3c7hxp,WeHaveGuns,8,Sun Jul 5 20:25:24 2015 UTC,"This is basically what I say to my openers. I don't put up with the bullshit as I generally close two days and open three days as an SS, and any time the openers start complaining stuff isn't done I just say ""well if you have time to stand around crying, you have time to do it""."
starbucks,3c7hxp,yungliloghomie,22,Sun Jul 5 21:39:57 2015 UTC,"I typically shake the whips almost regularly before I use them. Not only do they settle, but it gets the heavy cream to the nozzle much faster with a little shake."
starbucks,3c7hxp,j0ykid,14,Sun Jul 5 18:44:30 2015 UTC,pun intended
starbucks,3c7hxp,j0ykid,18,Sun Jul 5 18:44:38 2015 UTC,I feel you as a regular closer. Morning shifts have a super entitled mindset. You can set them up as much as you like but they'll complain. What a lot of them don't understand is that there are lots of closing tasks that need to get done and we do as much as we can considering especially at my store there are lots of customers who will come at the last minute and delay us getting things done for close and maybe just maybe we don't want to be there at 11pm because you complain about small things.
starbucks,3c7hxp,teethpuller,17,Sun Jul 5 18:50:02 2015 UTC,Exactly! We literally clean THE WHOLE store whilst making 5 frappuccinos per customer. Is it slower than mornings? Absolutely! But do we have 7 or 8 people? No! It's just so annoying. My closes are damn near perfect and I don't leave the store until the store looks that way every single night. And they want to complain about stupid shit like the whips are flat and the tea/iced coffee pitchers are set up at the prep station and not by the brewing machine. Like are you so lazy that you can't shake the canister or walk 5 steps to the prep station?! I literally do not understand.
starbucks,3c7hxp,Echoscurvydog,5,Sun Jul 5 19:01:56 2015 UTC,"Hang on there.   I am an opener, and I don't allow the mindset that the closers are incompetent.   Sometimes I get a crappy open, but I know I have left a crappy hand off in the past.  I'm sorry you are getting crapped on by the openers,  but I appreciate you cleaning the store and setting every thing up for me in the am!"
starbucks,3c7hxp,teethpuller,2,Sun Jul 5 21:59:47 2015 UTC,"And I'm not saying every opener is like this. It's mostly people who work varying shifts that know how it is. Sometimes we even get busier at dinner than we did in the morning on weekends. Shit happens in the evening, man. Not everyone understands that."
starbucks,3c7hxp,brittney3255,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:41:49 2015 UTC,"I think it goes both ways honestly. As an opener, I do get frustrated when things don't get done but that's because I was a closer for 2 years. I got bitched at all the time in that position but that also means I know what can and should be getting done at night. Of course I don't nitpick and I completely understand a difficult/busy close but I also know our closers have a tendency to screw around a lot. So its frustrating when I try to set them up for success before I'm off by breaking down bars and leaving them with an empty sink only to hear them bitch that I forgot to pre-grind decaf for pour-overs."
starbucks,3c7hxp,QASA_VIOLATION,7,Thu Jul 9 04:17:54 2015 UTC,"Out of all the managers at my store I am pretty much the only person who ever closes, 5 nights a week, and then the other two shifts each take 1 night each for the days I'm off. Now since for the past year and a half all I have done is close close close close like its fucking Groundhog Day, I'm understandably more experienced in closing than the two of them. To compensate for this our SM always gives them either an entire extra closing partner, or extends the precloser's hours to actual door lock as opposed to having them leave about an hour before.   So the other two shifts get to work an overstaffed closed once a week each, usually on slower week days as opposed to Friday or Saturday and then have the balls to use that to justify them complaining about every. single. little. thing. that gets missed on a busy Friday evening while we were one person down.  Forgot to stock the soy? They'll write you a goddamn essay about it in the cash management log. If I stand at hot bar and stretch out my arm behind me I can touch the cabinet we keep soy in. It's literally less than 3 feet away. Yes I forgot to stock it, but I'm sorry I was prioritizing make making sure paper products were stocked and double checking to make sure the bathrooms were clean and stocked. All you had to do was reach out, and grab some. You could have stocked the fridge 5 times over in the time it took you to write the note, but no, you just HAVE to bitch about it. It's the same every night, no matter how well I think everything is done. Chai is empty? That's another essay, even though it's about 6 inches further away than the soy is.  I have iced teas bagged and tagged and ready to to brew for the morning, I have backup mocha and FR prepped and ready to go, sani-trays have rags folded in them and are ready to go. Iced coffee cubes are by the brewer and ready to go with the necessary bags of iced coffee next to them to save the opener a trip to the paper room. But I forgot to make sure the WM tub was full and they had to refill it at open so I'm clearly not trying hard enough so that's another essay written for me where all the partners can see. Really makes me feel appreciated.  God forbid that I come in to close in the afternoon and the store is in anyway prepped for me. No backups at all, trash cans all full, no carafes filled, almost out of whips, all the tills need change but some fuckwit dropped all the 20s so I have no way to make change without taking it on credit from the safe, the partner who got in at 9a still needs their first 10 even though it's now 1:15p. Then I ask ""hey [opening shift] how's it been today?"" And I'll get a ""it's been so busy"" or ""it's been pretty dead"" but either way the store is still the same shit show it is every day.  Sigh."
starbucks,3c7hxp,liljazzbird,4,Mon Jul 6 02:27:13 2015 UTC,"Twins!  I'm the perma-closer too.   I got a note about forgetting to stock coconut milk in the front fridge. We chill our coconut milk in the CBS fridge and keep 3 in the front fridge. All they had to do was turn around and grab one.  Meanwhile I get there and the order isn't put away; my bar partner is on their last whip, but there isn't one single clean canister; RTD&E is thrashed; we're on our last two sleeves of iced venti cups which I will not discover for another hour or so, usually right after I go down to 3 partners for the night; I have to make a mocha on the fly; the bathroom is out of everything; there's at least 3 trash runs to do; and there's always a till issue.   I've also on occasion had to do the deposit.  But God forbid I don't make every single whip and carafe in the store."

starbucks,3c7hxp,liljazzbird,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:14:59 2015 UTC,"I know. And I'm understanding stuff goes awry sometimes.  But out of all the stores I've worked at and covered at this is the only one I've had it this consistently bad at. It's every single day.  Today it was so bad when I got there I don't think they had done any dishes /trash runs and so busy that we didn't get to start closing tasks until 4 hours before close because we had to spend so much time just recovering. . And I'm sure I'll get lectured on how there wasn't a backup mocha (there's a full one), that they had to make one whip, the Boh floors weren't spotless or something else insignificant.  Meanwhile I have an expanded department count, two baby baristas who can't close from memory yet or keep up on bar during a rush, four tills that had to be completely stocked and two other tills that had been unassigned but not dropped/written in the book and the only reason I knew they even existed was because the sales receipts in the tills were a mix of our 213xxxx partners and our 104xxxx partners...."
starbucks,3c7hxp,zshadowhunter,5,Wed Jul 15 05:56:57 2015 UTC,I find this to be true no matter the team or the store. It's kind of one of the unwritten comandments of SBUX almost. But that doesn't stop me from rallying my team to give the openers the best close I can.  Because in a perfect world if I set the openers up for success they will set mid up who will then set me up for close. You just have to let the little things go take it on the chin and keep rocking it.

It's irritating, but both climates being so different lends itself so well to divides within stores and lots of trash-talk; what you're doing here is complaining as well and would probably infuriate your openers just as much as their nitpicking does to you.  Just talk it out and try to hear their grievances too, not everything is a personal attack. If you want to get stuff worked out between you guys, a bit of give-and-take is going to be required.

starbucks,3c7hxp,germdisco,2,Mon Jul 6 04:08:28 2015 UTC,"I started out as a closer, then moved to openings for a year, and now I'm a closer again because I got promoted to SS. Morning is always going to have something to complain about. As a green bean, my closing SS would stress to me to make sure whips were done. She made sure all the cleaning was done ahead of time so all we had to do was stocking and cleaning those last minute dishes. When I went to mornings, I would bitch and moan if stocking wasn't done (cups, lids, milks, etc), whips and caramel bottles weren't made, and the floors look like crap. Even now as a closing SS, I will make sure my team stays behind just to make sure at least stocking and spot cleaning is done.  I think the reason why morning crew gets mad about whips is because it's not part of their routine. At my store, we have 30 minutes to get everything prepped before we open. This includes brewing coffee and tea, setting up the pastry case and RTD&E, and putting away the order. There's no time for whips. That is something that can be done ahead of time. Whips can sit in the fridge overnight. Just shake it before you use it and it'll be firm again.  tldr; just make the whips. That's at least one thing they'll stop complaining about. Won't guarantee they'll stop bitching though."

Most of the time my single barista is by themselves for a good 15-30 min while I'm running around putting the order away and ordering what we need. Nothing makes our lives harder  the day than getting a sudden rush as soon as the door opens and you find out that nothing was stocked or that you have one whip.   The best way to think about it is that you aren't closing the store, you are prepping for the busiest, most money making time of the day.   They shouldn't be speaking down to you in that manner, however, if you feel this way you need to talk to your manager about it instead of spitefully not prepping the store. I don't intentionally hand over a bad shift from morning to night, things just happen sometimes.  Tldr: The morning is crazy and so is the night.

Conversely when you arrive at 4 and the floor is a mess then you realize that maybe that stuff doesn't get done because you spend too much time doing dishes that wernt done, stocking RTD, redating everything.. Etc.  It always feels to me like everyone can do better. It's a team effort. If anyone slacks everyone suffers"
