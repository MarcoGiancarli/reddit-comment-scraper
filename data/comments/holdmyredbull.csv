holdmyredbull,3c899q,Mantraz,9,Sun Jul 5 20:48:43 2015 UTC,Gif ended too soon. Wanted to see him hit the mat and roll off the roof.
holdmyredbull,3c899q,RandyOfTheRedwoods,3,Sun Jul 5 23:15:07 2015 UTC,"The landing probably wasn't as graceful as the flip over the peak, so they cut it short.  Still amazing though."

holdmyredbull,3byaux,texsurfin,4,Fri Jul 3 03:57:12 2015 UTC,Not a bad edit. Good drone control. Dragged out a couple of the shots a bit long and obviously subject matter is a bit quiet but good testament to how even some fun can be captured really well.

holdmyredbull,350lf3,serendipitybot,9,Wed May 6 02:45:05 2015 UTC,This is crazy. Even the camera man has some massive balls. A bike and a guy flying by on either side of you. No thank you.

Fuck that. Its bad enough walking up or down it, in the low temps they get down there.  However the jaffa race is usually quite intense."

I saw the gif a little while ago, and though it was awesome, but just noticed the breaks and pegs. So Im guessing they do it regularly."

holdmyredbull,32o77h,zoso135,3,Wed Apr 15 17:14:05 2015 UTC,I was hoping for the shot of what it looks like from the viewers after POV for some reason. I used to watch the video before going to the gym to get my blood pumping.

holdmyredbull,2z8std,Dead_Mans_Pudding,5,Mon Mar 16 19:02:30 2015 UTC,Shit when I saw it yesterday as a GIF I was sure that was fake. Insane.
holdmyredbull,2z8std,_northernlights_,6,Tue Mar 17 14:40:46 2015 UTC,Makes me think of a suburban version of Mirror's Edge.

holdmyredbull,2xtuk0,tmandell,2,Tue Mar 3 20:59:26 2015 UTC,Every time I see one of these lil super moto bastards it makes me want one even more. I never go very far in my city and it looks like it could be fun provided you are safe about it. Can anybody tell me what exactly a super moto is? It looks like a enduro with street tires to me.
holdmyredbull,2xtuk0,DevilDucky95,3,Tue Mar 3 23:04:54 2015 UTC,It is a Suzuki DR-Z400SM  I have always wanted one but I figure it would take me a week or two to loose my licence if I bought one.
