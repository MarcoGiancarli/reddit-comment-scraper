LeagueOfMeta,3drhb9,PuppiesbyPound,2,Sat Jul 18 19:19:44 2015 UTC,So say two journalists wrote an investigate piece about a player leaving X team. The first one would stay up and the second removed for being a repost?
LeagueOfMeta,3drhb9,Soulaez,4,Sun Jul 19 00:52:40 2015 UTC,If they only contained duplicate data? Probably. There have definitely been different reports of the same event that have both reached front page at the same time but there isn't a lot of reason to have two front page submissions that say the same things or with one only paraphrasing what another or the original report stated.

LeagueOfMeta,3dsi6e,Trolokr,0,Sun Jul 19 17:32:56 2015 UTC,Doesn't this video fall under the same category as the funny Fnatic video compilation you removed? The Fnatic video featured mostly scenes where players were making jokes with a short clip where they discussed their games. This video here is exactly the same - clips of TSM making fun of Wildturtle's flashes with a short clip of Wildturtle flashing.
LeagueOfMeta,3dsi6e,Trolokr,2,Sun Jul 19 01:04:19 2015 UTC,The Fnatic video (FWIW) was a compilation of moments in the Fnatic Series of the players speaking with each other.  This video had taken a clip from the TSM Legends Video and compared it to WildTurtles ingame performance.
LeagueOfMeta,3dsi6e,VoiceOfRaeson,-1,Sun Jul 19 01:07:46 2015 UTC,"This video had taken a clip from the TSM Legends Video   The Fnatic video has taken several clips of the Fnatic Legends videos.   and compared it to WildTurtles ingame performance.   In a joking manner. Just like the Fnatic video had some analysis scenes in it, that were followed by a funny response.  Point is that the main aspect of both videos is not analysis, but rather jokes/funny moments. If the TSM one is allowed to stay up while the Fnatic one gets deleted, it would show pretty clear bias in my opinion. You have to enforce the rules the same for all videos, not just say ""oh the main aspect of the Fnatic video was just jokes, while the main aspect of the TSM video was analysis"", when 80% of that video was TSM joking around."
LeagueOfMeta,3dsi6e,maurosQQ,2,Sun Jul 19 01:23:51 2015 UTC,"I was luckily quick enough to see the TSM video and it instantly reminded me of the Fnatic video too. The huge majority of it was just Locodoco or other members telling Wildturtle ""And what do we do with flash?"" and Wildturtle responding ""not flash aggressively hahaha"". Like holy moly... how can this not be understood as a joke?  The only difference is that the TSM video had a few seconds of gameplay in it, but that would be a ridiculous reason to let it stay up. Otherwise, I will just edit a few seconds of Huni rooting people as Ryze in the Fnatic video and upload it as a ""comparison"" to Huni's ingame performance, then those videos will be pretty much the same."

I never wanted to straight up complain, but rather encourage discussion whether anyone else was feeling the same as I, where we would prefer to see less restrictions on content, particularly shorter style content, like plays."
LeagueOfMeta,3dpcn3,picflute,2,Sat Jul 18 05:14:01 2015 UTC,Cool plays can only hit the front page if the knights of /r/new like it. If they don't then it is donezod

I agree it was vastly too much and drowned out a lot of other content, but there must be a way to encourage more content like that without making it free farm karma?"
LeagueOfMeta,3dpcn3,picflute,2,Sat Jul 18 05:22:08 2015 UTC,during mod free week   You're using data during a time period that was heavily influenced by our actions when we lifted and removed every handicap we have on low-effort content and our myriad of handicaps we put on eSports content. Coupled that it was done during the off-season where eSports content was at its lowest.   I don't see how we can encourage more content when we've given so much power to ingame content compared to eSports. Currently this is the best we can do when we add hard limits to eSports content on the main subreddit. Karma is irrelevant to this discussion in regards to people farming for it. The main issue is how fast it gets consumed and voted on which is why we've put restrictions on it. Screenshots as direct submissions will absolutely never come back. And unless WebM content starts providing durations for their content we won't be letting it as direct submissions or else 5s game play gifs.  There was a great Lee Sin video that hit the front page twice (first for short duration content rule..)  Really I'd prefer if we just shut down all direct submissions to the subreddit and make it an even playing ground for everyone involved.

If people actually browsed new queue and see the # of big plays being posted daily you may notice that those in New control the front page,"
LeagueOfMeta,3dfiie,picflute,6,Wed Jul 15 21:38:57 2015 UTC,"As an avid New browser, I really enjoyed the two weeks where imgur/gfycat links could be posted directly. It's amazing how much an image preview and saving a click (so it's not click on thread -> click on link) do to make me more willing to view images/gifs while going through. It's also very easy to recall that when gfycats were allowed, Esports stuff still flooded the front page over the weekend. Post-Match Discussion threads and S@20 posts about PBE updates/new things always make the front page. They're not going away, no matter what other content you allow. The diversity and difference comes in because you can get a bunch of ""Rito pls"" and whining posts about how we don't have new features and a bunch of senseless drama, or you can have imgur links and gfycats of cool shit happening. I'll take the latter."
LeagueOfMeta,3dfiie,Zephaerus,7,Thu Jul 16 00:02:29 2015 UTC,"The opposite is also true. And last time, during the no mods week, esport content were drowned by hordes of ingur/gfycat links.   And most of it are rather... Bad.   I'd argue that currently, it seems to be quite good.

LeagueOfMeta,3dfiie,maurosQQ,5,Thu Jul 16 11:54:39 2015 UTC,"Most of our rules governing content came about because of esports.   One line joke posts were becoming increasingly about not the game, but players, and LCS performance and pro teams. Spoilers in titles is directly an esports thing. Short duration content was directly an esports thing, as that rule came from the old rule we had about twitter posts. People were taking anything and everything a pro player would say on twitter and posting it to the sub, drowning out content about the game. Reposts - A lot of reposts are LCS related. People keep trying to repost videos  of plays made during LCS games, days and even weeks after the game in question to get the views. Relevance needed to be redefined because there were a lot of grey areas within esports content. Esports has given us every single thread dispute we have ever had, except for a couple of pasted head videos about climbing the ladder.   Honestly, without esports content, I don't think there would be a need for as many specific rules as we have."

Bug posts just spam the Frontpage. Especially when there are like 2+ threads about exactly the same thing but with slightly different facts so it doesn't qualify as repost.   Over all we really have to add a rule regarding megathreads. Right now there isn't a clear guideline which causes this inconsistency. Some of us don't want to take away posts... At least not in that case. Others prefer to strictly keep everything in the megapost (which we agree is the best scenario).   We'll have to talk through this.   Thanks for bringing this up!

If you comment on this thread I'll do my best to approve the comments so long as it pertains to discussion, however I do want you to keep in mind that if the goal of this is to find a way to have the words ""rape"" not be filtered then I'm afraid that's something we won't be looking to change."

This thread contains one of the filtered words and was posted 8 days ago, unless it was specifically greenlighted by a moderator, it shows that it isn't always filtered. In which case, I'm not sure why it would be when it's being used in the context you want to ban it for?   If you search those three words this year in the searchbar, you can find plenty of examples of them being used in threads. There was also a thread involving 54 usages of just the base word a month ago on /r/leagueofmeta.   Do you have a problem with not being able to say [word]?   That's correct. That would be why I made this thread. I had to say ""assfucked"" instead after figuring out that one of my comments was getting automodded and I prefer more variety in words to use someone or a team being demolished. Given how popular the term/references to it is when discussing esports, a lot of people don't like it being censored either."
LeagueOfMeta,3dgvhx,picflute,-1,Thu Jul 16 04:31:32 2015 UTC,"It was green lighted by a moderator (probably because the OP in question Modmail'd us about it I don't remember) but that term is AutoMod'd. The code itself is something several subreddits across the site use and ours is tailored towards the more vitriol terms /r/lol uses. And we added that basic behavior filter to /r/leagueofmeta because someone kept calling other users ""cunts"" and wouldn't stop doing it and so we imported that rule from /r/leagueoflegends.  As for allowing the term raped in /r/leagueoflegends I honestly don't see us removing this behavior rule because it's not really appropriate.  Our first rule in the subreddit rule is   Don't attack people on a personal level -- don’t call them names, imply derogatory things about them, or tell them to hurt themselves or others. Feel free to disagree with each other, but be civil about it and don't resort to personal attacks.   I don't see a scenario where saying ""get raped"" is appropriate in any context without it being a personal attack towards someone. ""Safe Space"" bullshit aside this is something we've had in /r/lol for quite a long time and if there needs to be an announcement in /r/leagueofmeta that you can't say racist shit or tell others to get raped then so be it and I'll make it immediately.

LeagueOfMeta,3dgvhx,thainebednar,0,Thu Jul 16 04:44:05 2015 UTC,"Missed the second one! (re-approved for visibility)   ""Viktor raped Varus"" when talking about the laning phase in mid lane of a match.   I understand that example and it is a valid way of describing how that match up goes however that doesn't make it appropriate in the suberddit. And with our current number of moderators if we changed the action from ""removal"" to ""filter"" we'd be in for 50+ modqueue's every 10 minutes."
LeagueOfMeta,3dgvhx,adagiosummoner,2,Thu Jul 16 04:49:54 2015 UTC,"But saying Viktor murdered Varus is ok? I can understand removing something like you stated earlier where it's used to attack an individual, just as telling someone to kill themselves should be removed, but I don't see why it can't be used in a description of what happened. In law/society murder is considered a worse crime so it can't be the severity of the action that is the reason you removed it, as any mention of murder should be removed if that is the logic behind it (wouldn't be very practical in a game that has killing each other as a main component). Also it's worth stating that while I don't approve of the use of the word in most cases, it's just lazy vocabulary similar to why there is so much profanity, whether or not we like a word and it's connotations is not a suitable reason to remove content containing it (just to say it again, unless it is used in a personal attack). I hope I made it clear where I (and I'm assuming OP) find the problem/rift in reason with banning a certain word when used in a nonaggressive manor to describe events, even if there are better words to use."
LeagueOfMeta,3dgvhx,adagiosummoner,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:25:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's okay to say murdered. You know why? Because it's a videogame based around killing other characters.  It is not a video game based around sexual assault.   You want to compare the two, but when you download the game, you're already aware that one of the goals of the game is to kill. aka - murder.  Not rape."
LeagueOfMeta,3dgvhx,gahaith,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:43:11 2015 UTC,"Nobody in League of Legends is murdered. The point of the Rift is that nobody dies, they just disappear for a short bit and then reappear to fight again. Nobody is League of Legends is stolen from either, and yet people still use terminology related to that to describe things like taking blue buff. Being stolen from, depending on the circumstances, can easily be as traumatizing as being sexually assaulted or even more so."
LeagueOfMeta,3dgvhx,ily112,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:26:06 2015 UTC,"You're being purposefully obtuse. When you ""disappear for a short time and reappear to fight again"" that is counted as a kill. In game terminology."
LeagueOfMeta,3dgvhx,adagiosummoner,2,Thu Jul 16 18:44:07 2015 UTC,"Okay, but I can also say a champion got fucked, asspounded, bootyblasted, etc.  None of that is game terminology.  I don't necessarily think its wrong to ban the term, but this argument doesn't make sense if you allow other similar terms."
LeagueOfMeta,3dgvhx,ily112,2,Thu Jul 16 21:26:30 2015 UTC,"I have to agree with the other guy here, at least when your reasoning is ""I don't see any context it would be appropriate."" If that'd the only reason, it is a very poor one.  The r-word itself doesn't mean it's being used to insult somebody, and I'm sure you understand that. You can use it in several contexts, like explaining what somebody said to you, a past experience you had, or maybe even, at worst-case, in a discussion about a pro player/Rioter.   I don't think putting it on a modqueue is a viable option also, because, as you said, it would probably be too much work.   Now, if you had said ""we understand that there are plenty of contexts where it would be appropriate, the ones where it wouldn't be take precedent, and we're willing to accept that incorrect removals will happen, in an effort to make the subreddit a better experience. Issues where the word is absolutely necessary to be used, in a discussion that directly relates to league for example, will be dealt with independently "", then I think you would have no issue with the filter.  Saying there aren't any contexts where it would be appropriate, however, is very shortsighted."
LeagueOfMeta,3dgvhx,adagiosummoner,0,Thu Jul 16 16:28:21 2015 UTC,The only context in which it would be appropriate is when you're actually talking about rape itself. Not using it as a metaphor for winning over another character.
LeagueOfMeta,3dgvhx,ily112,2,Thu Jul 16 17:41:36 2015 UTC,"I agree, although I'm not sure what the popular opinion would be on the subreddit. Regardless, since there is a pretty clear, and commonly used, context where it would be okay to use the word, are you saying it's perfectly okay that posts that use that context are also being removed?"
LeagueOfMeta,3dgvhx,adagiosummoner,0,Thu Jul 16 17:50:58 2015 UTC,"From what I've observed, there are very few comments that actually discuss that way. Why would anyone need to have a discussion on rape in a subreddit for videogames?  That said, if it were a serious discussion on the subject, and we were contacted about it, we'd probably approve it, depending on context.  Auto-removing the word catches way more people using it improperly than it removes those who do. And for the benefit it provides? I'd say it's an acceptable false flag margin."
LeagueOfMeta,3dgvhx,picflute,2,Thu Jul 16 17:59:49 2015 UTC,"I'm sure of all people know that comment threads can go in all sorts of directions. And as long as you acknowledge that there is a false flag margin, then I have no issue on the matter."
LeagueOfMeta,3dgvhx,ForeverVulcun,0,Thu Jul 16 18:20:12 2015 UTC,"No. No, it isn't a valid way at all.  There is absolutely no way that being beaten in lane at a videogame is the same feeling as being raped.  And it's disrespectful to anyone how has been sexually assaulted to even compare the two. That's why it's not appropriate for the sub, and that's why it's been an automod rule for over a year now, except for mod free weeks."
LeagueOfMeta,3dgvhx,picflute,3,Thu Jul 16 13:05:23 2015 UTC,Its common usage doesn't make it appropriate. And there are other terms that can describe the situation occurring in a way that doesn't involve a term most commonly used in the attack of others (yea safe space talk.) I know that term is being spread like wildfire on reddit but we (as a mod team) collectively agree that using it as a way of describing shit isn't appropriate nor should it be allowed in a subreddit that is catering towards people ages 13+.  As for sending AutoMated Messages we'd like to have users not proactively try to bypass the filter or else it means we'd have to begin policing every comment thread in post match threads (and my fucking god that's a nightmare as it is)
LeagueOfMeta,3dgvhx,ForeverVulcun,-2,Thu Jul 16 04:46:21 2015 UTC,"Hey picflute,  I noticed that you used the reprehensible word ""fucking"" in your post.  I would just like to say that this is not okay as it can trigger emotional trauma for people who have been violated through the act of ""being fucked"".  This is 2015.  Just as you have banned the use of the words that this thread is inquiring about, I would expect the same level of care be taken with the word ""fuck"" and its derivatives.  I must say that your use of the word is extremely offensive and brought up emotions from a past attack that I have been trying to suppress.  This is a forum discussing the way a forum about a video game should be run, not a place where people are reminded of their abuse.  I know your use of the word was not in context to the act itself, just as the r word can be used out of context, but I think we can collectively agree that the very usage of the word to describe shit is NOT OK in a subreddit that caters to people ages 13+.  Watch your language."

LeagueOfMeta,3dgvhx,adagiosummoner,2,Thu Jul 16 16:37:05 2015 UTC,"Your joke is also pretty incorrect. While ""fucking"" and ""rape"" are both terms people can get ""offended"" by, the two are not similar. ""Fucking"", colloquially, is merely the act of having sex. Usually used to describe consensual encounters. ""Hey, baby, wanna fuck?"" Crude, but still leaves it open for consent.   ""Rape"" however, is already a nonconsensual act. It is traumatic and violating. And should be taken way more seriously than it already is.  Try to find a better metaphor, please."

And we don't want that. We want people to talk about league.   Besides, and this is my personal opinion, if it takes Reddit to get a case noticed, they should be looking at how to improve support instead of looking for front page posts on Reddit about support.   Also, rioters are community members too. They should not have to come here to see someone's fuss about accounts."

LeagueOfMeta,3dcas5,TheEnigmaBlade,3,Wed Jul 15 03:51:00 2015 UTC,"To go a bit more in depth as to what enigma said:  We don't know yet if and how we want to use it. There are quite a few options.   We could sticky one rule post forever which explains how to hide it so it only appears for logged out users and the once who didn't read it and don't know how to hide posts. We could also hide it via CSS for not logged in users.  Right now there's always issues with bug megathreads and our normal sticky schedule (fandom friday, etc.) so we could just keep the spot empty and fill it up as needed (like those bug threads, announcements, etc).   There are a few more options but those are the most important once imo and we will have to decide what we end up with and then make it so. For now it'll just be used for double stickies until we figured that out so probably within the next week or two we will have the permanent setup ready."

Long discussions were just horrible for us because it takes over like two screens after half a day.  It is a way better spot to do this.

We chose to cater to the community by being more strict with the wording of rules and our actions.   Your argument is literally   ""We dont have to do anything for you, we can remove anything we want and not take you into account at all. You should feel priviliged we as lenient as we are""  Yet at the same time mods will be the first to scream that you do it for free, as volunteer work to help the community, that is more of a hassle than anything. It seems pretty arrogant to me to expect the community to be grateful for a job you choose to do, and at the same time expect the community to give a free pass whenever there is a disagreement.  The local neighborhood watch is something I appreciate it, and the memebers of it are volunteers. If one of them started trespassing through my yard or harassing my kids asking if they've seen any ""suspicious"" activity or something similar and I complained I would be furious if the reason was: ""We do it for free, you have no right to complain about the neighborhood watch. If you don't like our methods then you can just leave"", as if leaving the largest discussion hub for league of legends in the world is a viable alternative. Maybe I'm reading into it too much but that seems like a common theme present within moderation communities throughout all of reddit, or any volunteer position that gives the volunteer extra power."

Numerous rules were implimented without discussion here, such as the 30 second rule clip or the ""Address the community"" rule. Not only that but has a single rule been removed because of this subreddit? I'm having trouble of thinking of any, maybe one or two have been. But at best for every rule modified/removed there are 5 created  This subreddit doesn't seem like its about using feedback to strive towards a better rule set, it seems like all it does is create new rules. Any way we can get some stats mods? How many new rules or strictier interpertations of rules are there because of this sub, any how many rules were removed? I mean look at the rule page, it looks like Link should be credited as an author at the bottom of it."

If you still feel the same way after reading those three things, I'd love to hear why, and how the new rules and especially the processes leading there have been unreasonable/lacking."
LeagueOfMeta,3d81jd,hansjens47,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:55:57 2015 UTC,"So Buckeye thinks democratic vote systems don't work, yet he used that system to conduct the no mod week? He then points to that very vote as an example to why a democratic vote system wouldn't work, saying only 1% of people voted for it, so the solution is to make even less people participate and vote? I sincerly doubt 1% of /r/leagueoflegends is coming to this subreddit to vote and voice their opinions, over 80% of the comments here are by moderators. A small fraction of participation that goes on in this subreddit are actual users, which as I said seem to be outnumbered. It can be blamed on people being lazy and not wanting to participate in the subreddit or anything else - either way it isn't exactly a fair platform the way it is being handled now.  The tone of this subreddit is very apparent, I get the feeling people only dip into this sub when they want to propose a new rule then leave after its done. I think that creates an atmosphere where this sub is designed to add new rules, not to improve or remove unnecessary ones. Even the moderation team admitted no-mod week went better than expected, we went from a decent amount of rules, to no rules for a week (In which things were ok, but not ideal some rules are clearly needed - especially witchhunting), to now we have more rules than ever before. I thought if anything the no-mod week would be a good demonstration that the community can work ok without 15 pages of rules, now we have twice as many. What did the moderation team learn at all from the no mod week?  I feel like the community realized that some rules need to be in place, you can't have a subreddit run on purely upvotes and downvotes. It doesn't seem like the moderation team took anything from that experiment whatsoever     Side rant on the follow-up reply by /u/dresdenologist (I realize this was only part of his response, but I feel like this is something a lot of people run with and abuse).   When it comes down to brass tacks, any privately owned and operated space is basically: their house, their rules. That's not to be rude, that is simple fact. Subreddits are run at the discretion of moderators and admins rarely get involved unless there is a Reddit-wide rule violation.   That is a very lazy way to dismiss criticism. Does Buckeye own the league subreddit so he can do whatever he wants with it? Sure, but don't confuse that ability as a barrier against criticism. Warner-Brothers has control of the new Batman game, people shouldn't complain if they don't like it they can just refund the game. Don't complain about it, WB can do whatever it wants with its own game. Oldschool example, Runescape is F2P so you shouldn't complain we removed the wildy. It is our game we can do whatever we want with it!  Yes you can, as in the sense you technically have control over it, but people who use the service have the right to complain all the same. Buckeye is literally just the person who registed /r/LeagueOfLegends first, it could have been Riot, it could have been me, it doesn't really matter. Winning a race shouldn't give the way you run the subreddit such a lazy blanket statement ""Dont criticize cause I own it"". If I was in charge of the subreddit I guarantee many poeple, perhaps yourself I'm not sure, would complain that I don't have enough rules. You'd get pissed if I said ""If you don't like it theres the door, its my subreddit I can do whatever I want!"""

I want to make that clear since the follow-up paragraphs I wrote after that quote clearly talk about how you have to operate with a two way street of taking and being open to changing based on community feedback despite the factual reality that subreddits operate at the discretion of the moderators.   The first paragraph was meant to state a fact, one that people frequently forget on Reddit because they are more laissez faire with their policies. You may not like it but its reality. It was not meant to basically say you can't criticize or complain, and responding to me as if it did in order to try to support your argument is grossly misrepresentative of my position."

Side rant on the idea that just because somebody owns something that they immune to criticism   My post wasnt about you at all. Your reply was linked to me in the comment I responded to, I agreed with the vast majority of what you wrote, I addressed the part I didn't agree with. If you were the only one to ever say something like that then sure, maybe it could been seen as a personal attack.

""Reddit can fire whorever it wants, if you don't like it leave, you have no right to complain"", ""Free speech only applies to the government, not to reddit"".

Certainly he was a great, influential guy for the gaming industry but he doesn't belong in the title of /r/leagueoflegends any more than he belongs in any posts on our sub."
LeagueOfMeta,3d40s8,mdchemey,9,Tue Jul 14 01:53:38 2015 UTC,Exceptions should be made and someone like iwata who helped change the gaming industry its worth ignoring the rule to pay respects to someone who did someone great.

I was fine with my front page being all Iwata because I subscribe to several general gaming subs, each of which had every reason to have a separate post about him, but this is ridiculous and really it's causing me to lose more respect for the mods than any events which have previously transpired might have because it is so blatantly and openly hypocritical."

Honestly though, how does this make you lose respect for the mods?  It's not blatant hypocrisy, it's them making header edits that are typically humorous, current, and topical.  In this case, it just showed a bit of respect for the passing of a legend in the gaming community.  The rules disallow posts that are simply one-word comments, or dank memes, but those rules don't apply to header edits either.  Please, let's not make this place too stiff, huh?  Did you get this upset when the sub header read ""League of Viktoria"" over the AMAgeddon debacle?    Seriously, instead of relying on the header, just click the tab to look, find that huge League of Legends emblem at the top and rest easy that you found your way to the right subreddit.  I know it takes an addition 2 seconds to do so, and in this world of instant gratification that's asking a lot, but it's 2 seconds tops.

LeagueOfMeta,3d7jgf,bw13187,2,Tue Jul 14 04:24:44 2015 UTC,"So in your opinion, the only way someone should be allowed to discuss what voice lines would be cool, is if they write an essay about it? Either that, or they're not allowed to discuss it at all?  Do you realize how absurd that is?  the LoL sub has a ton of rules that just don't make any sense, like the one about not editing your post about making the front page. Who cares? Seriously, who does that harm? Why does it require moderation?  Or the rule about no video posts that are short or images except in self posts. What the hell? A video has to be 30 seconds or more or else it has to go in a self post? Why? Who cares? What difference does it make? No appreciable difference.  Every time mods trot out the ""we work really hard"" speech, I laugh, because they work really hard doing pointless moderation like that.   I just don't understand what prompts people to not only make rules like this, but make an entire other subreddit to discuss policing the subreddit in the first place. Man, it really matters a whole hell of a lot whether this particular post about Gnar, which was highly upvoted and generated lots of discussion, was arbitrarily long enough to warrant evading deletion. Jesus.  Meanwhile, like 75% of /r/leagueoflegends on a given day is post after post after post about the LCS or LCS players, crowding out all other content (that doesn't get removed outright for not being arbitrarily long enough).   The rules in the LoL sub are absurd. The sub is hilariously over-moderated. Seriously, if you were to run the rules by any random person they would be like, what's the big deal?  I had to wait 8 minutes to post that since this subreddit doesn't exist so much for discussion about posts on the other sub, but rather to witch hunt posts people obviously like and downvote anyone that thinks they're fine"

Two words that should have very little impact to the post make mods automatically regard it as a post that doesn't address the community. But if you look at the front page at any time you will find posts very similar in content format and style to this post, asking about an idea or change that should happen. The only difference between the ones that stay and the ones that don't is a mentioning of riot. But really, riot is implied in both cases. A theoretical post titled ""Shen's ult should scale with AD"" is going to be discussed based on the idea and how good it would be for the game. But the community itself can't make that change. And that's why I don't think a post should be removed for having ""riot pls"" in it. It's simply acknowledging that Riot is the one that can make the change. But the typical mod response I've seen is that people will be offended and upset at seeing riot pls and it will change the nature of the discussion. I want to test that though. Maybe the mods can stop removing these posts for a week and see what happens."
LeagueOfMeta,3d30l3,8litzcrank,-3,Mon Jul 13 03:43:20 2015 UTC,"I report ""riot pls""' threads, and I'm going to have to respectfully disagree. Sure, both threads might generate some level of discussion around a core issue, but that's generally where the similarities end. Riot please threads come across as demanding. They're less about discussion, and more about airing grievances, big or small. A lot of the time they just re-hash common complaints or suggestions and you end up with the same stale discussions over and over and over again. The subreddit isn't suppose to be an official line of communication to Riot, that's what the forums are for. The rule to ""address the community"" is a small, but important distinction to make because it cuts down on the low effort crap and encourages more debate on the actual topic instead of Riot's ability / inability to address the issue.  On a final note, IIRC, the community actually requested that mods implement a stricter 'riot pls' rule when things started to get out of hand and the front page was dominated by them."

Because it had ""rito pls"" at the end. Sure this is an idea that has been brought up before, but that's not the reason for removal. It's not fair to throw every post that has ""riot please or ""hey riot can you"" in it into one category. Because from my observsations, plenty of ""riot pls"" posts removed are fine in content; they are very similar to the posts that are allowed to stay. You say this isn't an official line of communication with Riot, and I completely agree. But having ""riot pls"" in the title or body is not by itself trying to achieve that. Like I said, it's acknowleding that Riot is the company that made this game, is linked the the idea, and is the only one that could possibly change it, not redditors. Haven't you noticed posts everywhere like ""Fizz should have this change for his ult"" or ""This skin needs to have better effects"". These posts are the exact same as ""riot pls"" posts, but without the Riot in title or body. And they are allowed to stay, to which I agree with. I understand that you and many other people will report a thread like the original one automatically, but I wonder if it really would change the nature of the discussion. I think it's worth a try."

LeagueOfMeta,3d30l3,8litzcrank,2,Mon Jul 13 13:32:02 2015 UTC,"Am I right in assuming you take issue with the fact that some innocuous threads and ""good"" discussion may get caught in the crossfire? In that case, allow me to address a couple of your points...   It's not fair to throw every post that has ""riot please or ""hey riot can you"" in it into one category.   Maybe so, but that opens up the rules to interpretation and grey areas. People will inevitably nit pick and complain about why x thread is allowed and y thread got deleted. The rules used to be more flexible, but the immense backlash from any mistake on behalf of the mod team lead to them creating a more, lets say, defensive rule set. It's unfortunate that a few good discussions might be preemptively cut off, but if the OP takes a minute to properly phrase their thread all of this can be avoided.   You say this isn't an official line of communication with Riot, and I completely agree. But having ""riot pls"" in the title or body is not by itself trying to achieve that. It's acknowleding that Riot is the company that made this game, is linked the the idea, and is the only one that could possibly change it, not redditors.   ""Riot please"" threads come with all sorts of baggage and the (correct) assumption that Rioters are actively monitoring the subreddit. Often times they're worded to bait a response instead of create genuine discussion within the community. This is why the distinction the ""Address the community"" rule creates is incredibly important. If, as we agree, redditors don't have the power to actively implement changes to the game, then why do we have to make pseudo demands to the developers in the form of passive aggressive Riot please threads? Wouldn't it be better to just address the community with your ideals and have a discussion without any expectations looming over the thread? Honestly I feel that would encourage more engagement from Rioters than a ""Riot pls"" thread... So yes, I do think having this rule steers the community towards more fruitful discussion and removing it would be a step backwards.  Ex: Using the removed thread as an example, I think it would be better off if the title was more ""Wouldn't it be cool if we could have player reaction cams after big plays?!"" instead of ""This LCS game proves why we need player reaction cams, RIOT PLEASE"". Can you see how one of those titles comes off as more demanding than the other?   Haven't you noticed posts everywhere like [...]    Yes, I have. And yes, I would probably nuke the more irrelevant and insipid ones if I had any sort of moderating power. But then again I'm a jaded old fuck relative to the rest of the player base. I tolerate those threads because I realize not every one has been playing league of legends for 5+ years like I have. New players are always coming in and don't realize their 'fresh, innovative ideals' aren't as unique as they think they are. It's not a bad thing to revisit discussions about balance, game mechanics, features, or ideals from time to time, but problems arise when you see the same shit reposted frequently.  I hope my response is a little more insightful for you this time. I think a lot of these issues stem from gamer culture + reddit's inherent weaknesses as a platform, but that's a discussion for another time lol!"

LeagueOfMeta,3d4zvk,MackleDoge,3,Mon Jul 13 17:12:59 2015 UTC,IIRC the admins are in the process of implementing a spoiler feature similar to the NSFW flag you can place on posts. When that happens we might tweak our spoiler rules.

You're basically teaching them 1 person at a time to not do it. That's extremely inefficient.  If we could somehow raise awareness about this rule on a bigger scale, you might not have to remove so many good threads just for silly edits.

It gets to the front page and is deleted for violating the ""content shorter than 30 seconds must be a self post"" rule. Then someone comments on the meta post saying    I totally agree with the removal, and the rule itself, but...   By posting in the subreddit, they acknowledge that they have read the clearly stated rules posted in the side bar. They assume that responsibility and If content is removed, its up to them to make the corrections.   If you have a better method for enforcing rules, please say so."

LeagueOfMeta,3cwvqc,McDrewbs,6,Sat Jul 11 14:26:42 2015 UTC,"It was basically the OP mocking a level 19 user for thinking the scoreboard listed users in order of how well they were doing, with OP at the bottom of his team."
LeagueOfMeta,3cwvqc,I_PLAY_LEAGUE_AMA,2,Sat Jul 11 14:46:27 2015 UTC,I'm not linking to it as it has personal information in it.
LeagueOfMeta,3cwvqc,quicktails,8,Sat Jul 11 14:39:34 2015 UTC,"I didn't know summoner names are considered ""personal information"". how is it personal information when people have summoner names as their flairs in the /r/lol sub?"
LeagueOfMeta,3cwvqc,McDrewbs,5,Sat Jul 11 17:13:13 2015 UTC,Its different when a user gives out his own info personally. Its kind of like asking why phone numbers are considered personal information if people hand them out all the time- its not the same when its tossed out into the masses without you knowing.
LeagueOfMeta,3cwvqc,VoiceOfRaeson,4,Sat Jul 11 17:33:22 2015 UTC,"Because it relates to permission for use? For example (thank you history lol, although I did accidentally open the gif of the bike dildo, it's not what it sounds like, well it is, but I saw it on /r/bestof, I didn't go looking for it, I swear! Leave me alone you meanies!), there's this 0/15 Yasuo who probably wouldn't want to be known for sucking this badly against bots.. Or the Rammus for being an idiot and thinking that the scoreboard is in order of who is doing best.   It's not exactly hard to search their name in the client and mock them for it, if one was so inclined, and people have done that. So while naming them isn't directly bad in itself, it is facilitating other's to be able to bad to them. And for this level of user protection, it really takes very little effort to remove the names and it's not like it ruins the image."
LeagueOfMeta,3cwvqc,picflute,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:41:56 2015 UTC,"I didn't know summoner names are considered ""personal information"".   They are not, this mod is clearly wrong thinking that this post was  a) a personal sob story (How the heck can you even think that this was a sob story?)  b) personal information.

LeagueOfMeta,3cwvqc,VoiceOfRaeson,2,Sun Jul 12 07:12:33 2015 UTC,No. Summoners name do count as personal infos in certain case.  This isn't mod invention but admins order.
LeagueOfMeta,3cwvqc,Davixxa,0,Sun Jul 12 10:59:40 2015 UTC,"Personal Sob Story   That was definitely not a sob story. Did the OP ever complain about anything? How the rules define a sob story: ""Do not whine about how everything is unfair without a good argument to back it up. “I lost the game because other people suck” is not a good enough reason.""  OP never whined about anything.   Posting only a screenshot   That is not against the rules. The rule states ""No screenshot submissions (even when self-posted), unless it has context that would be allowed as a post on its own. If your post is just a lolnexus or in-game screenshot, tell us why it's worth discussing. If your post is about ""i have 0 ip and rp! I won the game!"" or some person's funny in-game name then it's going to be removed"". But fine, you could argue that it didn't have context that would be allowed to be posted on its own.   Failing to censor personal information   Let me quote what your rules state is personal information:   Full names (first and/or last name); not the case in this screenshot Private contact information such as addresses, phone numbers, e-mails etc; not the case in this screenshot Bank or credit information; not the case in this screenshot Chat accounts such as Skype accounts; not the case in this screenshot Social Media accounts (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn etc) that are not publicly available; not the case in this screenshot Private photographs or pictures without consent of the subjects; not the case in this screenshot Images of social media accounts where the name is still legible; not the case in this screenshot   Given that the post can be removed under the ""no screenshots without context"" rule, 2 of the 3 reasons you stated are completely wrong according to the /r/LeagueOfLegends rules.

LeagueOfMeta,3cv4wm,Saad888,2,Sat Jul 11 01:00:15 2015 UTC,I want to discuss [Spoilers] Pawn Slick 1v3 Outplay (EDG vs Snake) again as the mod that removed it didnt awnser the complaints.  What excactly is the spoiler in the title? That Pawn made an outplay? Since when are spoilers so specific? Even another said in the comment section that he wouldnt have removed the post.  So what now? How is the spoiler rule enforced? What is considered a spoiler?
LeagueOfMeta,3cv4wm,maurosQQ,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:27:57 2015 UTC,"Since when are spoilers so specific?   Because that's what spoilers are? Too specific a title tells too much, thus spoiling the match.  Anyway, in a pro match, games can be decided by small things, hell getting the first dragon in a pro game has been shown to more often than not snowball into a victory, so the rule generally needs to err on the side of caution as to what is in the title. So knowing Pawn did a 1v3 outplay, and that he is a midlaner can easily lead to knowing EDG ended up winning (because lets face it, if a player gets a 1v3, their team is either doing well or the enemy team fucked up, leading to the easy assumption that the player that come out on top of the play is probably on the winning team, and if we go look at the play we can see that is how it played out, EDG ended up winning). And I bet if you were to go back over any of the [spoiler] plays that are ""outplays"" and see who it contained and then check and see which team won, that more often than not the named person would be on the winning team.   I suppose I should preface this with I think the spoiler rule is silly anyway and it shouldn't really be on the sub (I think people looking to not be spoiled should just avoid the sub, there's no other time sensitive posts that can't wait till after they have seen the match), but if we're going to have it, it should be effective for what it is suppose to do, and to do that named players should not be allowed in the titles. For example, a safe spoiler free title would have been ""[Spoiler] Snake vs EDG, slick 1v3 outplay""."
LeagueOfMeta,3cv4wm,McDrewbs,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:21:21 2015 UTC,I disagree that this spoils the match. A tripple kill doesnt mean that the match is over at all.
LeagueOfMeta,3cv4wm,maurosQQ,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:24:24 2015 UTC,"It's more the fact that it's a 1v3 than just a triple kill. It's not a 100% spoiler, but more often than not the result is the 1v3 will be in favour of the winning team. So putting 1v3 and names in the title does lead the reader to believe who won and I'm sure if you were to go back over the spoiler posts which include a named pro and a title along the lines of ""outplays/1vX"", that the match result will be in favour of the named player far more often than not."
LeagueOfMeta,3cv4wm,McDrewbs,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:39:24 2015 UTC,"But this is not certainty. The person dont know they are spoiled, they only may assume so."
LeagueOfMeta,3cv4wm,maurosQQ,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:08:21 2015 UTC,But you now know that Pawn gets a triple kill somewhere 1v3. Part of the match is ruined.

If someone spoiled that for me, I'd be pissed, I don't know how it ends, but because part of the show has been revealed overall the experience is worth less.  EDIT: I just realized I don't actually know he got a triple, so the post isn't a spoiler in that regard, but over all my point stays."
LeagueOfMeta,3cv4wm,riven,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:44:02 2015 UTC,"But I dont think comparing sports to shows works that way. Plotpoints are core facts in narratives as are results in sports.  If you really dont want to know any spoiler, then no title will be enough. Even if the title would be ""slick outplay 1v3 Snake vs EDG"" you will get spoiled the fact that the outplay happened.  If we continue to go down this rabbit hole, there wont be anymore titles you can use."
LeagueOfMeta,3cv4wm,maurosQQ,2,Sat Jul 11 16:51:23 2015 UTC,"I don't know if the mods are still talking about the Spoiler rule, but from all the discussion in the thread that was made a week or so ago, the only titles that would fully prevent any type of spoiler would be [Spoiler] TeamA vs TeamB and just leave at that.

However, after more people posted, the person in question (The Teemo) had nothing to do with the actual incident, so all that's doing is leading towards the Teemo player in question getting harassment (As anyone can easily look this up from a VOD or an op.gg link) when in fact the game was ""ruined"" by the Jungler Tahm.

The nice one was posted a few hours after the other.  So, which one stays?  The first to show up, or the one that is more usable.  I would imagine that the only reason the second post gained that much traction was because it looked so much better than the first.  At the same time, no reposts is a pretty well known rule."
LeagueOfMeta,3csye9,danmart1,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:32:15 2015 UTC,"Just for some clarity (second runes page poster here). I checked the New page to see if someone else had already submitted a post summarizing runes and didn't see any. The first one was submitted while I was working on mine, which takes a while. Otherwise I would've been satisfied with the former and wouldn't have bothered to post my summary."

LeagueOfMeta,3csye9,VoiceOfRaeson,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:52:54 2015 UTC,"Hey, referenced user here. I'm a bit late to the party, and I'm here to clarify some things. Each post was dedicated to a different section of Phreak's video. Since the video in question was nearly an hour long, having one post to summarize the entire thing would've been just a giant wall of text, which no user wants to read. Therefore, one post was for masteries while the other was for rune pages (runes post was removed due to someone beating to the punch). I was working on the runes post while the other one was submitted, so I didn't even see it on the New tab, otherwise I wouldn't have bothered.  The other posts were X-posted to /r/summonerschool, since it's the educational League subreddit."

LeagueOfMeta,3cw5aa,BennyXYZ,4,Sat Jul 11 07:25:38 2015 UTC,"We've been trying to find 'off time' mods for quite a while.  As most of the users are in North America somewhere, so too are most of the mods. There are some late night users, there are some early morning users, there are some other users, but as far as what I see, we're lacking a few more very active EU/OCE moderators - This is common knowledge.  It's hard to have a ""schedule"" to ""work"" timezones, because this isn't a job. The sub isn't a factory where you have a night shift, if there isn't enough people who live in Europe  / OCE timezones who are moderating, then the only way to change that is to get some more moderators in that time zone.  You can't really point at someone and say ""Ok Snorlax, you're working the 3am-7am EST shift! Good luck!"" because during that time I'm going to be asleep, I have work to go to and sleep to get to, I'm not going to adjust my sleep schedule to work an unpaid volunteer job because I wouldn't do that to work my PAID job.  There are hundreds of modding man hours put it per day on the sub - From what I've seen in the short time I've been here the team is actually incredibly well organized and dedicated to making sure the sub runs smoothly. Most actual jobs don't have the dedication these guys put into working a volunteer position.  You might see a few shitposts in different timezones - And that's fine, when I get on in the morning there are dozens of reported threads I dig my hands into. Always more mods being looked for. The key is finding people who care ad people who fit the bill.  You're browsing at a time where not many people are browsing (3AM est) - And therefore not a lot of moderation is going on either. That's just how timezones work - There's a ""night shift"" and there's a ""day shift"" on anything that runs 24 hours. The ""night shift"" is always lightly staffed in any business."

LeagueOfMeta,3cw5aa,Makiavelzx,2,Sat Jul 11 08:49:17 2015 UTC,"Having a schedule isn't manageable, it then becomes more of a chore than something you do to help out when you can, not to mention that since it's a volunteer position, if it comes to a time where someone might have to go due to an urgency, you'll go back to the point where there isn't any active moderation. Ignore that point, we go back to the point where we volunteer, some mods like me just like popping up, cleaning the queue and then going off whenever they feel like it, after a game of League or whatever while some other mods are able to focus more on moderating and allocate more time in a row solely for the subreddit.  Yeah, we need constant moderation and we have some timezones that are rather poorly covered however we have it difficult to recruit new mods at the moment, we're still constantly trying though and are looking into how we're going to progress with it.  But to keep it short, the lack of mods for different timezones (OCE mods would be great, we don't really have that many) aswell as burning out and doing it during the free time leads to periods where a big subreddit such as this one is getting a bit out of control - we realize it, we know we need more mods and we'll try to fill the team to cover those periods as best as we can however we actually need to spot candidates that we all agree on or open applications, we'll see which one we go for in the near future. Most of us don't really mind increasing the team but it has to be candidates we agree on."

Out of the rules right now, in their B&W state, which one would you say is bad for the community if applied consistently? The only one that really seems to cause a lot of debate is the relevancy rule (e.g. Hai Retirement Video).   I think the Edits rule is extremely easy to follow and it's very forgiving since you can just take off the edit and your post will be fine. Adding those type of Edits, sarcastic or not, bring absolutely nothing to the discussion at hand. It's also honestly just annoying. The application of the rule isn't really ""strict"". It's a very clear rule. It's an easy to follow rule. There's no need to add those type of Edits."
LeagueOfMeta,3cosji,hurtnandez,0,Thu Jul 9 20:05:07 2015 UTC,"The edits that bring nothing to the discussion and are neutral is the issue for me. I don't see a good reason for removing posts because of them. It being annoying to you (and I'm sure a lot of other people) is still subjective. What harm is ""wow I can't believe I hit front page"" causing? Is it derailing the discussion by it's irrelevancy? Is it advertising or promoting something? Is it calling for action? Is it changing the topic? No, it's just a neutral, overused statement that people hate seeing. As such, I really think it's silly to remove a post based on that. I fully support removing posts with edits that do one of the things I mentioned. But anyway, yes the rule is extremely easy to follow, but does that make it a good rule? The two aren't fully correlated with each other. When posts get removed like that and the OP doesn't see it's removal for a while, then a good amount of potential discussion is lost. And this happens ALL the time on this subreddit."
LeagueOfMeta,3cosji,8litzcrank,5,Thu Jul 9 20:46:28 2015 UTC,"I get where you're coming from and I agree that it's not necessarily causing any harm.    No, it's just a neutral, overused statement that people hate seeing.   This is the problem, in my opinion. The overused part particularly. If allowed, you start seeing the ""hi mom"" type edits in almost every post that reaches front page. It becomes excessive. And while right now people don't really care because, for the most part, the rule is followed and those front-page edits are rare, the minute they start appearing everywhere people will start complaining. Discussions will be derailed because people will be so annoyed they'll start commenting about the edit. This is the post when the original rule was instated, with a comment that describes what I just said. This is also why I consider that yes, it is a good rule.   Maybe some of the discussion will be lost, but then again, it's the fault of the OP for not having read the rules before posting. I haven't really seen posts get removed ALL the time because of this and in most cases are resolved pretty quickly because, as I said initially, it's such a forgiving rule."
LeagueOfMeta,3cosji,hurtnandez,2,Thu Jul 9 21:52:31 2015 UTC,Rules can be changed but once a rule is added/removed it should be clear what was changed. Black and white is good for rules as the community can better debate the purpose of rules when its that clear

LeagueOfMeta,3clw1j,maurosQQ,2,Thu Jul 9 11:22:18 2015 UTC,"I doubt anyone here is familiar with Halocharts, but that site had a few community members that did it weekly and would have guests each week and just talk about random things pertaining to the site and would have an agenda with the guest.  However, with league, the site does not offer much to talk about, and even with guests I don't know how this would vary much from anything else."
LeagueOfMeta,3clw1j,Moncster,2,Thu Jul 9 03:00:12 2015 UTC,"I'm the other half of the Towerdive podcast team aka Pan the Man. If there is ever anything you guys want to talk about or want to see, please tweet at us  @TowerDivePC We're also making more youtube content at our youtube page  thanks /u/Merich for the plug"
LeagueOfMeta,3clw1j,rwadams87,2,Thu Jul 9 17:45:16 2015 UTC,Now I know the other half of who to ban if you talk bad about me on your podcast ;P

LeagueOfMeta,3clw1j,rwadams87,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:42:08 2015 UTC,I would much rather have a stream of you guys playing ranked 5s
LeagueOfMeta,3clw1j,rpnightsend,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:57:47 2015 UTC,"as /u/Merich said, I am 1/2 of the hosts of Tower Dive, a League of Legends podcast.  We've done 15 episodes thus far.  It's a very chill, very relaxed atmosphere.  We have fun and aren't very formal, but we have a good time and we care about our community.  We try to get guests on as much as possible, we've had Richard Lewis, Rachel ""SeltzerPlease"" Quirico (eSports host/Former FragDoll), Merich (reddit mod), and we're working on some other high profile guests that I can't say, until we hammer down the details, but it's pretty big.  We're still sort of figuring this all out, so to say we've perfected the podcast would be a lie, but we listen to the community, we stream, invite them to play games with us, you guys are the reason we do this.  So if you haven't come check us out, listen to a few episodes (the first 3 or 4 aren't great, i won't lie), and let us know what you think, what you like, what you don't like, what you want more of, etc...we're VERY reachable.  Tower Dive Podcast Tower Dive Twitter  cheers, and thanks for listening and/or giving us a chance!"
LeagueOfMeta,3clw1j,KNGootch,5,Thu Jul 9 15:05:54 2015 UTC,ayyy chipapa been wondering where you've been
LeagueOfMeta,3cmrqc,picflute,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:58:48 2015 UTC,Now we have this video on the front page: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrEOSegLqLc  I mean... the only thing this rule does is increase the amount of useless filler that people put in their videos. I think it needs to reworked somehow.
LeagueOfMeta,3cmrqc,VoiceOfRaeson,2,Thu Jul 9 14:53:35 2015 UTC,"I understand the reasoning of the rule (Short videos vs gifs), but I never really like it. It adds fluff like you said and makes more work for the mods. That said, it was passed regardless of my dissenting vote and I will enforce it until such time as it is removed (if it is ever removed)."
LeagueOfMeta,3cmrqc,Merich,0,Thu Jul 9 15:05:18 2015 UTC,"Im so glad we have this awesome 30 second rule, now I can watch the same video twice but with an additional 15 seconds of farming /s  What a horrible rule, either you guys didn't think it through properly before passing it or want just another reason to remove something."
