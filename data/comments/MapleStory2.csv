MapleStory2,3e711t,Macro_Polo,1 point,Wed Jul 22 13:18:40 2015 UTC,Aren't they called PvP coins? Just wondering so I don't mind the two up :)
MapleStory2,3e711t,TheInactiveWall,4,Wed Jul 22 13:26:36 2015 UTC,"They're officially called Tokens of Bravery, but they're mostly referred to as pvp coins. The best way to spend 500 assuming you aren't going to do any further guild pvp is to buy the gloves, boots, and hat for your class (total 450) and spend the rest of 25% potions. However, one assassin star is only 600 coins, so you could try and form a group for PvP to purchase a BiS weapon.  Due to a large number of smurfing guilds, you must be in a guild for 48 hours before doing PvP events will let you earn more coins, so make sure you find a group that will be consistent with being online. If you only want to earn 100 more, it shouldn't take long at all."
MapleStory2,3e711t,Grayscail,1 point,Wed Jul 22 13:35:21 2015 UTC,so the only way to get them is through guild pvp activity..? =/
MapleStory2,3e711t,ghauiohoae,1 point,Wed Jul 22 13:36:21 2015 UTC,Correct
MapleStory2,3e711t,Grayscail,1 point,Wed Jul 22 13:44:32 2015 UTC,ok ty
MapleStory2,3e711t,ghauiohoae,1 point,Wed Jul 22 13:47:56 2015 UTC,and how much is 500 coins? Can you get that in a few matches or something or do you really need to play a lot of Guild PvP. Tryna put it in perspective here before ima spend mine :p
MapleStory2,3e711t,TheInactiveWall,3,Wed Jul 22 13:36:51 2015 UTC,"It's quite a bit, actually. I'm at 1663 rating (#47), and I spent the past 5 hours doing PvP and only earned about 400. If you start a new guild, you'll be in bronze until you get 5 wins. In bronze, you only get 12 coins per win, 14 in silver, 21 in gold, and 28 in platnium.  PvP matches start every 10 minutes (on the hour, ten minutes after, etc. etc.) and only are available at certain times (6 PM - 10 PM KST on Monday-Friday and 1 PM - 10 PM KST on Satu/Sun. This means you can only do 30 matches on weekdays and 54 on weekends. Since you have to wait 48 hours, that means you'll miss Thursday and Friday events, and the season ends on Sunday. If you find a guild before 1 PM KST today, and you play for all 9 hours on Saturday and all 9 on Sunday, you will have 108 matches. Since you're new to PvP and you're probably not in a coordinated guild, you'll probably be around silver MMR (1150-1300) and get 14 coins per game. Assuming a 50% winrate, that's 756 coins total (42 per hour) which, in addition to the 500 you got from compensation, is just enough to afford a PvP weapon (or two if it's dual wielded like throwing stars).  tl;dr 500 is a lot. If you aren't completely confident that your group (that you have to find today) will be playing for the PvP events this weekend, spend them."

MapleStory2,3e711t,TheInactiveWall,3,Wed Jul 22 14:09:54 2015 UTC,"Tria.tv and Maplestory2.tv seem to be the most active places for guild recruitment with Tria (in my opinion) having the more dedicated guilds whereas the ones on MS2.tv seem to be more social.  While guild PvP is the most structured form of PvP and is the only way to get PvP rewards, there are 2 PvP events in the map southeast of Perion every hour which reward mesos and Onyx Crystals. I forget the times, but every 30 minutes one of the doors will open and you can go in and join the PvP event. One is a 1v1 arena and the other is FFA battle."

PvP coins are only obtainable from Guild Championship. Also, I believe that not everyone obtains the PvP coins compensation. It's for those who belonged to a guild. Also if you just joined a guild yesterday, you probably didn't get the coins. Correct me if I'm wrong! And shadow world is open 24/7. You just have to go to Ludibrium Meteor and there's a portal to the shadow world in which you can PvP after 10 minutes of Lapenta's spell (or you can rid of it yourself).

MapleStory2,3dxzcu,Daikoden,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:56:02 2015 UTC,Join a guild. I'm sure some others will help you translate important messages.
MapleStory2,3dxzcu,tsmitty14,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:28:31 2015 UTC,"If you need help with just the early stages, I have a guide that I made for levels 1-10. https://www.reddit.com/r/MapleStory2/comments/3cw92a/beginners_level_110_guide  I tried to walk people through far enough that you can manage after the guide is done"
MapleStory2,3dxzcu,ShadeJay,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:05:22 2015 UTC,You could join a guild. Or I am willing to help if I am online at the same time as you are. Tell me your IGN and I will add you to my friend list.
MapleStory2,3dxcx0,F4cetious,5,Mon Jul 20 09:00:38 2015 UTC,"The cheapest house possible is probably what you're referring to as an apartment. You can get some pretty cheap apartments near kerning city for 15k. I'm not sure if the price changed, but I got my house near henesys for 28k. It was 1 map above the town. Every month, you have to pay 80% of the original price so it would only cost me 22.4k each month. (I actually haven't checked what the case is with apartments, so this may or may not hold true and may be even cheaper) I think the contract prices could vary on the houses, but it should be, at most, 80%. I am not aware of any place to store items in your house; however, you can teleport there and sell stuff in your house. You use the house recall button which summons a 10 min portal from your original location to your home. The recall button has a 10 minute cooldown. Houses/apartments are also account shared."
MapleStory2,3dxcx0,Hydrolac,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:14:15 2015 UTC,"Do you have any insight on the status of maids, and  there ability to craft items?"
MapleStory2,3dxcx0,tsmitty14,3,Mon Jul 20 15:31:52 2015 UTC,"Yes, you can buy different types of maids to craft different types of items. There is an alchemist maid (a tiger?) that you can buy for under 100k mesos. You need to craft the basic stuff and work your way up the ladder. Each time you craft something, you gain intimacy with the maid, and it enables you to craft higher and more useful items. For example, you start off crafting red potions, and you work your way up to craft the special attack and function potions. You can also work your way up to crafting 10 white potions at a time. You need 2-3 materials usually to craft items. There is also one that enables you to craft accessories which are hefty/expensive to craft. The same thing applies to the potion. I don't have all the maids, so there are a few more with different functions such as a sailor that makes foods which give you certain buffs. I don't use it at all, but I think it should take 30 minutes for all of the potions (not sure about accessories).  Also, there are ones that you can buy with merit. I believe they perform the same  functions, but they do not require as much crafting material as the meso ones."
MapleStory2,3dxcx0,Hydrolac,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:58:16 2015 UTC,thanks for the info!
MapleStory2,3dxcx0,Macro_Polo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:13:27 2015 UTC,"28k for henesys house is still there.  Looking for kerning one right now, 15k is a steal. edit: Here it is: http://puu.sh/j6Xw6.png"
MapleStory2,3dxcx0,kirbyfreako,2,Tue Jul 21 04:52:01 2015 UTC,"idk about chests in your house but there's a vault in one of the towns that I think is for storing items? (at least I hope, since I stored a bunch of my items there!) I forget which town though.."
MapleStory2,3dxcx0,Iychee,2,Mon Jul 20 12:59:25 2015 UTC,"There should be one in every major town, I haven't actually checked for one in kerning, but it should be there."
MapleStory2,3dxcx0,Hydrolac,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:00:04 2015 UTC,yup there is one there

MapleStory2,3dwehg,chabonki,3,Mon Jul 20 02:23:00 2015 UTC,how do you check ping ingame? Is it the number next to your FPS?
MapleStory2,3dwehg,imashoplifter,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:28:56 2015 UTC,u have to turn it on in the setting
MapleStory2,3dwehg,Hydrolac,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:52:32 2015 UTC,"Btw, 250 ping is pretty good on the west coast (sometimes you can get 200). I get 400 ping in the midwest, and it's doable- so don't feel pressured to get better ping."
MapleStory2,3dwehg,TheInactiveWall,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:27:43 2015 UTC,Which option is the ping one? :P
MapleStory2,3dwehg,sliferx,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:46:50 2015 UTC,I don't see an option to turn on ping
MapleStory2,3dwehg,sliferx,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:42:35 2015 UTC,it's the option tat say FPS
MapleStory2,3dwehg,sliferx,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:06:16 2015 UTC,Oh i see it but you sure thats ping next to fps ?
MapleStory2,3dwehg,djurbadjurb,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:10:09 2015 UTC,"yup it is, once it get to 500 it's becomes really laggy. Also is maple working for you as of right now, because i cant play it. Or are they in server check because i keep getting this thingy."
MapleStory2,3dwehg,KevinSquirtle,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:14:06 2015 UTC,"They have server maint, should be over by now (its 2 hours)"
MapleStory2,3dwehg,mlgsnickers,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:01:05 2015 UTC,Id like to know this aswell..
MapleStory2,3dwehg,godiego,3,Mon Jul 20 13:03:22 2015 UTC,you cannot reduce the ping. there just isnt a way to do it.
MapleStory2,3dwehg,ghauiohoae,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:30:18 2015 UTC,i heard of people using vpn's to reduce ping but i think it is bannable so go on your own risk.
MapleStory2,3dwehg,dagro15,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:22:03 2015 UTC,"it's not bannable, but you do run the risk of having to reverify your account"
MapleStory2,3dwehg,cadesert,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:10:21 2015 UTC,Download more internet speed.
MapleStory2,3dvmob,xFudgeMuffinx,3,Sun Jul 19 22:18:22 2015 UTC,The only real way I've gotten to do 1v1's with friends is going to a shadow world map that's empty and near a healing station.
MapleStory2,3dvmob,mebranflakes,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:56:10 2015 UTC,would be great if there was open world pvp somehow without ganking
MapleStory2,3dvmob,ghauiohoae,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:57:45 2015 UTC,uhhhh yea thats probably not gonna happen
MapleStory2,3dvmob,KevinSquirtle,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:23:27 2015 UTC,"i know it wont, just thought it would be nice"
MapleStory2,3dvmob,ghauiohoae,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:08:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think it could work if someone could click on the other person and select a pvp option, and the other person has to accept for it to happen -sort of like party invites."
MapleStory2,3dvmob,Iychee,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:56:07 2015 UTC,"Just go in shadow world in an empty map, pretty easy."
MapleStory2,3du78i,senyrin,4,Sun Jul 19 14:48:08 2015 UTC,We will be trying our best to finish Shadow Shaman! :D

MapleStory2,3du78i,meloveg,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:34:24 2015 UTC,IIRC Ambition is currently full & Woah is just a randomly made guild lol
MapleStory2,3du78i,aikawakazu,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:31:18 2015 UTC,woah

MapleStory2,3dtllv,Thatzombii,2,Sun Jul 19 09:32:34 2015 UTC,"I think the top option is WA, bottom is MA. Hence bottom one for staff"
MapleStory2,3dtllv,dthx2710,1 point,Sun Jul 19 10:06:01 2015 UTC,Sorry for such a late response but that should answer all questions
