weezer,3e4r7z,DOMAN127,2,Tue Jul 21 23:11:58 2015 UTC,How much did you pay for yours? I'm looking to buy a copy.
weezer,3e4r7z,monte003,3,Tue Jul 21 23:40:23 2015 UTC,"I got mine from a user on Vinyl Collective for $35 shipped. This copy is only $35 also, and it's the cheapest I've ever seen it."
weezer,3e4r7z,ElCrowing,2,Tue Jul 21 23:51:44 2015 UTC,"Damn, I'm jealous. It's my second favorite Weezer album. I'd love to have it on vinyl."
weezer,3e4r7z,helperoni,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:45:43 2015 UTC,"If you're looking to buy, it isn't that expensive :)"
weezer,3e4r7z,Mr_Mann55,2,Wed Jul 22 00:51:58 2015 UTC,"I have one too! Got it from Japan, and the guy included a Japanese lollipop in the package that I will probably never eat."
weezer,3e4r7z,teenagevictory,2,Wed Jul 22 02:54:22 2015 UTC,It just snowballed. I didn't open Maladroit right away and then acquired Green. At that point I made the decision that I was going to get every studio album in vinyl sealed. I'm 29 and don't care about how they sound on vinyl. My first experiences with Weezer is on CD so vinyl holds no nostalgic value for me.
weezer,3e4r7z,Mr_Mann55,3,Wed Jul 22 03:51:45 2015 UTC,Then what's the point of owning it on vinyl at all?
weezer,3e4r7z,Mr_Mann55,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:04:32 2015 UTC,Nice!
weezer,3e4r7z,Mr_Mann55,0,Wed Jul 22 02:18:12 2015 UTC,Same reason people buy a collectors edition of their favorite t.v. show.
weezer,3e2z8k,plorry,4,Tue Jul 21 15:44:37 2015 UTC,"Cool! I like the idea of synth, but I kinda wish they used a dirtier synth sound like the one on Buddy Holly or Tired of Sex.  Also, why isn't Rivers playing guitar? He gave it to this fifth Weezer instead?"
weezer,3e2z8k,kobun04,3,Tue Jul 21 16:03:57 2015 UTC,"On the Green Album, this track never stood out to me, but this version makes it into something a lot more enjoyable! The added synth intro (synthtro?), and raising the vocals an octave (in certain places) really breathes some energy into it.  Posting in case anyone hasn't already seen it. I really think it's the way this song should be heard."
weezer,3e360t,cut_paper,2,Tue Jul 21 16:32:51 2015 UTC,"2000 Weezer had some of their best [Lupos, Warped Tour, SummerSonic] live shows, this one is pretty solid."
weezer,3e360t,TheWrongButton,2,Tue Jul 21 20:09:05 2015 UTC,"yeah, for sure! and the anticipation for their first album since their post-pinkerton hiatus was ridiculous at the time"
weezer,3dvvmd,kobun04,2,Sun Jul 19 23:35:18 2015 UTC,"After combing Youtube, 2010 seems like a weird year for Weezer..."
weezer,3dvvmd,epicwhale1,7,Sun Jul 19 23:38:42 2015 UTC,"I think it's them trying to relate to the internet crowd. They weren't that relevant, and tried to be. But, with EWBAITE, they just said ""Who cares about being relevant? Let's just make good music!"""
weezer,3drtt7,stickytreason,6,Sat Jul 18 21:09:51 2015 UTC,"This does not at all feel like Weezer if I'm being honest. I definitely prefer the album version.  EDIT: Actually, it reminds me of what we have of songs from the black hole."
weezer,3drtt7,ajdj99,5,Sat Jul 18 21:45:34 2015 UTC,I like it. Sounds like a little bit of Pinkerton/SFTBH spilled on to the track.

weezer,3drtt7,crakker78,2,Mon Jul 20 16:46:37 2015 UTC,"Is there really anything about it that screams ""fake?""  We know that the press was given an early look at this album and that they were sent tracks that were still work-in-progress. It seems inevitable that a few of those would leak at some point.  I think creating something as convincing as this would be either impossible or take too much effort to be worth it."
weezer,3drtt7,TheStreetAlwaysWins,2,Mon Jul 20 17:52:12 2015 UTC,You serious?  That was most definitely Weezer...
weezer,3drtt7,elPedroGrande,3,Tue Jul 21 14:42:52 2015 UTC,"Hey its a full version of the one used in the teaser!!! This means theres probably a ""My Mystery"" out there"

weezer,3drtt7,burndtjamb2000,2,Sun Jul 19 02:40:08 2015 UTC,"My exact thoughts. While I like the album version more, I feel like this has a more realistic and something more true to what I'd hear at a concert though."

weezer,3drdh7,CS2603isHard,2,Sun Jul 19 15:59:20 2015 UTC,I'm sorry. I thought that it was a common enough symbol that it would've been understood.
weezer,3drdh7,kobun04,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:22:47 2015 UTC,I googled and the closest I could find was maybe something from the EWBAITE booklet?
weezer,3drdh7,BlackQuartz,3,Sun Jul 19 06:06:21 2015 UTC,"This 3 word post has set pushed me down a rabbit hole of trying to figure out the narrative of EWBAITE. I really didn't know it was concept album.  In the credits there are people listed: Claire, Cleo, George Blotkin, Joe Lafolley, Sebastian, Bella, Research Fellows, RFJT DJ...  And a story editor, Meredith Stiehm who writes for crime dramas.  I feel like there's this HUGE store behind this album...  Here's a theory I found on g33k-e.com   As I briefly mentioned earlier, the album does have a story to it. Through out the album, you’ll hear various voices. These are the voices of the characters from the webisodes Weezer has been making on their Youtube channel. Nobody’s cracked the code on just what the exact story is just yet, but here are my thoughts: Joe Laffoley has made a deal that allows him to see into his son’s future. He sees his son, Sebastian, rise to fame as the front man of the Astronauts with their first hit single (Ain’t Got Nobody). Along the way, he meets a girl (Lonely Girl), falls for her (Da Vinci), cheats on the girl until she finds out (Go Away), breaks off his ties with the older woman he was cheating with (Cleopatra), and returns to the original girl who finally forgives him (Return to Ithaka). These songs form the “Bella Donna” section of the album. His band has similar troubles; They realize the errors of their ways (I’ve Had it Up to Here), vow to return to their roots (Back to the Shack), and finally escape the waste land (The Waste Land). These songs form “The Panopticon Aritst” section. The final section is “Patriachia” which deals with father figures. Sebastian looks back at his literal (The British are Coming) and musical (Eulogoy for a Rock Band) forefathers, giving him the inspiration to break away from the record company and the controlling hand of the woman whom Cleopatra is about. The last two songs are a little trickier: “Foolish Father” could be coming from Sebastian’s point of view towards his own daughter, his father’s point of view towards his son, or both. “Anonymous” similarly refers to the birth of a child or Sebastian or Sebastian’s child. Either way, in the webisodes, the story ends with Joe seeing his song overcoming all these obstacles and thanking his late father as his band wins an award. And with that, Joe is hauled away and Sebastian will never see him again.   I'm guessing the symbol of Joe Lafolley's laboratory?"
weezer,3drdh7,kobun04,2,Sun Jul 19 16:15:15 2015 UTC,i've also heard that the thing he uses to see his son's future is the futurescope (as in the trilogy)

weezer,3d2lmy,RJB6,2,Mon Jul 13 12:12:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it can get kinda rough. There are definitely gems here and there, but there are sometimes strings of episodes where I'm just left bored or confused. I just watched the episode with Katy Perry and puppet Simpsons. That episode broke my brain. I don't even know how that got made...  I do think the show has gotten better in the past few years. Nowhere near the quality and consistency of the 90s episodes, but I just get the feeling like they've found new writers who know the characters and care about trying to put out an enjoyable show. Seems like no one really cared for most of the 2000s...  Like I replied to another user, Weezer and The Simpsons share similar parallels in quality over time. The strongest material was from the 90s. They kinda lost their way in the late 2000s. And have been trying to comeback in recent years. Though I have to say, Weezer more successfully than The Simpsons.  Edit - After thinking about it. EWBAITE rivals Blue and Pinkerton in my mind. But I didn't grow up with those albums. So my opinion about the strongest material being from the 90s might not be right..."
weezer,3d2lmy,plorry,6,Mon Jul 13 22:30:49 2015 UTC,"I always saw a lot of parallels between Weezer and the Simpsons - both produced their highest quality work in the 90s, and dropped off dramatically thereafter, with only the odd hit here and there.  Also both take me to my adolescent happy place."
weezer,3d2lmy,CaptainNeedleMouse,3,Mon Jul 13 20:35:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I actually made the comment the other day, ""My two favorite things right now are The Simpsons and Weezer. What is this, 1994?!""  Anyway, I also think that both Weezer and The Simpsons' newest material have been the strongest they have been in a while. EWBAITE and Everyone Needs Salvation display a promising return to form and the most recent seasons of The Simpsons have been better than the 2000s.  I mean, I think the BEST MOST MEMORABLE work is probably behind them both, but I do think things are getting better for both Weezer and The Simpsons.

My friend once described this song, and the whole of make believe with the phrase ""It sucks you in, then it punches you in the face over and over again"" and it applies very well for this song."
weezer,3d22rx,ajdj99,5,Sun Jul 12 22:52:40 2015 UTC,I just wish there WAS a proper chorus. This could've been one of the greats for me if it had an awesome lyrical accompaniment that lived up to the hook.
weezer,3d22rx,filmingej,2,Mon Jul 13 01:57:14 2015 UTC,"It was so painful to write the last chorus but I enjoyed singing along like 20 times haha. I think the song was created to be one of those anthems that bands want people to sing along with them, besides, a proper chorus with lyrics would ruin the song IMO because you have to change the rythm and all of that.  It would been cool if the last chrous was the only time they sing ""Oh-woah"", so people could sing while Rivers play the solo."
weezer,3d22rx,BlackQuartz,3,Mon Jul 13 03:44:07 2015 UTC,"obligatory ""forgot to write a chorus"" joke. it's a shame too, cause i do like the rest of the lyrics, even if they do come off as really whiny. great intro too. the chorus really ruins it for me though, if there was actually something there i would love this song.  EDIT: nice music video too :)"
weezer,3d22rx,kobun04,3,Sun Jul 12 23:57:58 2015 UTC,"I really wish the fake pre-Weezer band in the music video was Weerez. I always find that name funny.  I like the song. I didn't immediately, but it's really grown on me. I think the chorus was the initial turn off."
weezer,3d22rx,Powerstars,5,Mon Jul 13 03:56:18 2015 UTC,"I love this song. Experienced it live the other day, and it was amazing. I think the chorus was actually sung louder than Bev Hills."
weezer,3d22rx,teenagevictory,2,Sun Jul 12 23:18:53 2015 UTC,I really like those solos and the lyrics aren't bad either. I think that this one is my favorite live version.
weezer,3d22rx,jdinger29,2,Mon Jul 13 00:45:53 2015 UTC,I was going to pick that one but I forgot when I posted it haha.
weezer,3d0sly,Merrell21,8,Sun Jul 12 15:46:00 2015 UTC,Not a single song off pinkerton :(
weezer,3d0sly,HolyMingus,4,Sun Jul 12 17:04:09 2015 UTC,"I was there and this was the only thing that disappointed me. They played El Scorcho and Tired Of Sex at the next gig, so I was unlucky enough to go to the one gig where my favorite album wasn't represented."
weezer,3d0sly,Powerstars,3,Sun Jul 12 17:46:17 2015 UTC,"Here's the breakdown   Blue - 5 Pink - 0 Green - 2 Mala - 2 Make - 2 Red - 2 Rad - 1 Hurley - 1 EWBAITE - 3    I'll never understand their obsession with Dope Nose or Perfect Situation, you'd think they could drop either of those and add El Scorcho or even Cleopatra. Or even replace Troublemaker with ""The Good Life"", they have very similar beats after all. Rivers seems to have so much fun performing ""Troublemaker"" though."
weezer,3d0sly,MustBeNice,8,Sun Jul 12 20:45:58 2015 UTC,"Perfect Situation got a good crowd reaction, and it's a good song, I feel it should be kept. I'd say Memories is the one they have an odd fascination with."
weezer,3d0sly,Powerstars,2,Sun Jul 12 20:58:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've seen Weezer 4 times, and whenever the opening chords to Perfect Situation start playing, you can hear the loud high pitch screams of Weezer's female fan base going crazy haha. They usually stop playing after the solo and just let the crowd sing the ""ooohhh OOOOH""s and River's joins in with that high note. It seriously gives off chills.  But yeah, not only do they play Memories a lot, but it's always an encore song, which makes even less sense."
weezer,3d0sly,TheStreetAlwaysWins,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:49:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they did the breakdown after the solo at the Block Party too."
weezer,3d0sly,Powerstars,3,Tue Jul 14 21:05:10 2015 UTC,I know!! That was a little disappointing!
weezer,3d0sly,BoomTownGary,5,Sun Jul 12 22:27:07 2015 UTC,Awesome! Why are some green???!!!
weezer,3d0sly,Flambolt,3,Sun Jul 12 16:12:17 2015 UTC,"Might have some extended solos, alternate intros/outros. Basically they're noticeably different from the studio version."
weezer,3d0sly,BoomTownGary,2,Sun Jul 12 18:35:18 2015 UTC,"Guess so, you'd figure the band would know that though as they rehearse them that way... ? Maybe change of guitar or tuning...?"
weezer,3d0sly,Flambolt,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:07:22 2015 UTC,"I guess the same could be argued for change of guitar/tuning, since the band would probably know when to do that. Someone else mentioned that the band setlist was different, and that this might be for the lighting/sound crew which would explain why some of them are highlighted green."
weezer,3d0sly,igottapeeonher,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:22:07 2015 UTC,"I have no idea, I was trying to figure that out!"
weezer,3d0sly,DannoSpeaks,3,Sun Jul 12 22:26:39 2015 UTC,"I went to the Block Party and ended up being slightly disappointed. The whole band just looked really bored and there was no interaction with the crowd. I wish they would have played some different songs than they did, but overall it was pretty alright."
weezer,3d0sly,Powerstars,3,Sun Jul 12 17:20:51 2015 UTC,"I agree, we were right on stage and it looked like Rivers was pissed off. Although I thought the show was great, but short (festival set, so as expected). Highlight was watching Rivers kid dance around and strum his fake guitar."
weezer,3d0sly,DannoSpeaks,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:55:04 2015 UTC,"Ah yes!! I have a video of his son dancing, it was so cute. I was also right in the front."
weezer,3d0sly,Powerstars,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:28:51 2015 UTC,"Oh, was that Rivers's son?"
weezer,3d0sly,gbuck97,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:16:52 2015 UTC,"Yes, his son, daughter and wife were on the side of the stage."
weezer,3d0sly,Powerstars,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:40:21 2015 UTC,"Aw, that's cute. Would've been cool to see one of them come out and play an instrument like they've done a bit lately. Well I mean, his son did. xD"
weezer,3d0sly,angelfromthecoast,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:09:32 2015 UTC,I totally agree. A couple years ago at the Block Party they were so much more interactive with the audience. It was still amazing but I was also a little disappointed about that.
weezer,3d0sly,Powerstars,3,Sun Jul 12 22:26:06 2015 UTC,Awe no Futurescope Trilogy?
weezer,3d0sly,Powerstars,3,Sun Jul 12 20:44:08 2015 UTC,"They, unfortunately haven't played that in quite a while."
weezer,3d0sly,Powerstars,2,Sun Jul 12 20:57:51 2015 UTC,God I wish they'd go on another EWBAITE tour and come to Dallas.
weezer,3d0sly,jdinger29,2,Sun Jul 12 23:27:05 2015 UTC,"You and me, both, though I wish they'd bring it back on over to MN so I can see some more new songs, but this show wasn't bad."
weezer,3d0sly,ThreeDeep1998,2,Sun Jul 12 23:31:35 2015 UTC,"Whoa, hold up, did you get that from the stage or from the people in charge of the lighting? Cause I know a dude who picked it up from there, and it looked a little different."
weezer,3d0sly,ThreeDeep1998,3,Sun Jul 12 17:47:37 2015 UTC,This one was taped to the stage for Rivers! The lighting guy went back and got some more copies that were not taped the stage and handed them out to people!
weezer,3d0sly,Powerstars,3,Sun Jul 12 22:24:55 2015 UTC,"Ah, I see. Congrats on getting the ""true"" setlist!"
weezer,3d0sly,ThreeDeep1998,2,Sun Jul 12 23:15:51 2015 UTC,I was there!  I brought my 11 and 13 year old boys for their first concert.  It was a fun show but even my 13 year old commented that the set list was probably put together for a crowd that was not necessarily the biggest Weezer fans.
weezer,3d0sly,Powerstars,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:28:02 2015 UTC,Bingo.
weezer,3d0sly,ThreeDeep1998,2,Tue Jul 14 17:46:46 2015 UTC,"My band got to play this show and therefore got to see Weezer up real close.  Scott was awesome to meet and truly a humble guy.  The set list was catered to the festival crowd and the casual fan.  Lots of morons with selfie sticks, and group photos during the set.  Silent during ""Surf Wax"" but eruption for things like ""Beverly Hills"".  I've been lucky and have seen =w= many times over the last 16 years.  It was hot and miserable outside and I could see how any musician on stage would be a little miserable."
weezer,3d0sly,Powerstars,2,Tue Jul 14 17:50:10 2015 UTC,"That's what I was thinking with the whole set list thing that it was meant for the crowd. Which band were you in? Overall I thought it was a fun show. Everyone looked like they were still enjoying themselves on stage even in the heat!,"
weezer,3d0sly,ThreeDeep1998,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:46:38 2015 UTC,That's super cool. Which band were you in? The only other band I got to see was a little of Zoo Animal's set.
weezer,3d0sly,Powerstars,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:01:57 2015 UTC,^ that's the one.
weezer,3d0sly,ThreeDeep1998,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:06:34 2015 UTC,"Mad props! My brother and I were late, so I only got to catch the last 3 or so songs, but I really enjoyed what I heard. Which member were you?"
weezer,3d0sly,Powerstars,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:27:29 2015 UTC,thanks! i play the low end guitar. aka bass
weezer,3d0sly,pascha,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:52:19 2015 UTC,"Ah, cool, I'm a bassist myself. Liked the bass line on Heavy Lifting (Didn't get to see it live, but I heard it on Bandcamp)."
weezer,3d0sly,pascha,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:44:57 2015 UTC,ah that's a cool tune!  That was played before my time in the band.
weezer,3d3gdg,pruettcc,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:30:45 2015 UTC,Reading your list makes me realize that I don't know the names of many songs. It's not just Weezer either. I just know songs by the words in the chorus.
weezer,3cunm3,JustSmileAndWaveBoys,13,Fri Jul 10 22:34:06 2015 UTC,"Aww... And we'll never get to see the pilot. Yeah, the TV industry seems weird. Wasting all that money.  I would totally watch unaired pilots if they were available. Just put ads in front like Hulu and you have your business model. I don't really get why studios sit on them if they're rejected..."
weezer,3cunm3,kobun04,4,Fri Jul 10 22:52:03 2015 UTC,I assume it's not worth the studio's time to make that work out.
weezer,3cunm3,zck,7,Sat Jul 11 16:07:51 2015 UTC,"It would have been cool, but honestly, I'm not too broken up about it."
weezer,3cunm3,Oilerman14,4,Fri Jul 10 22:53:15 2015 UTC,"Dammit, I was actually looking forward to that."
weezer,3cunm3,angelfromthecoast,4,Sat Jul 11 04:10:01 2015 UTC,I read an article about it... the description of the show seemed too vaguely based on Rivers's experience to accurately portray the real weezer tale.
weezer,3cunm3,dergenschmags,4,Sun Jul 12 03:11:16 2015 UTC,It's time for Netflix to come save the day!
weezer,3cunm3,puffdragon,3,Sat Jul 11 21:00:38 2015 UTC,"Rivers is right, the TV industry seems to be devoid of logic. They sometimes pay up to a million dollars for these pilots, then some suits decide it's not worth airing and it will never get a chance.  You read all these stories where Stephen King got rejected 25x before he finally got his first book published or whatever.  You'd think at the very least they'd allow for the scrapped pilots to be thrown up on YouTube and recover SOME of their investment back through ad revenue, but nope, they shelve it and hide it from the public like an ugly red headed stepchild that lives in the attic."
weezer,3cv1ga,danohart,8,Sat Jul 11 00:29:15 2015 UTC,"My hope is that they'll eventually do some more small club shows like the EWBAITE shows last fall and play some deeper cuts in those. But yeah, just going off of their habits for the past 15 years it's likely that many of those songs will never be played live again. There were plans for a larger EWBAITE-focused tour this summer but those fell through. Apparently they're planning a big tour for next year, but I would be surprised if it turns out to be EWBAITE-focused.  I do think they'll swap out ""Eulogy"" for another EWBAITE cut before the end of this year though."
weezer,3cv1ga,burndtjamb2000,3,Sat Jul 11 02:44:40 2015 UTC,"crosses fingers here's hoping...  Also would like a legit venue too. Seeing them in Chicago was great, but it was at a food festival so just had a different energy than a full-on Weezer good time."
weezer,3cv1ga,reeforward,5,Sat Jul 11 15:56:57 2015 UTC,"I recently checked a lot of their recent setlists and I'm pretty sure the tracks from EWBAITE that came up often were Eulogy, Back to the Shack, Go Away, and Cleopatra, with Da Vinci and Ain't Got Nobody coming up a few times. I might have actually seen Foolish Father come up once but I'm not sure.   Weezer does miss out on playing a lot of great tracks from their lesser albums though, like The Angel and the One, Ruling Me, Unspoken, etc. But like you said, Tired of Sex has popped up again, and Foolish Father is such a great track from their most well received album in years, its gotta at least show up once in a while. They definitely seem proud of this album so I don't think they are gonna forget about any part of it soon."
weezer,3cv1ga,wolffpack8808,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:19:18 2015 UTC,"That's true about them swapping around some EWBAITE songs...would love to hear Da Vinci live again. And Ain't Got Nobody is a super fun way to start off a concert with everyone starting off low and then getting louder and louder! Gahh, such a good time."
weezer,3cstj4,mm020296,8,Fri Jul 10 14:16:20 2015 UTC,"Haha happened to me too, also in 2014."
weezer,3cstj4,angelfromthecoast,3,Fri Jul 10 16:10:42 2015 UTC,"You would think that this would be an unrelatable song, but it really is for many guys out there (maybe even women if you reverse the roles). Even I can relate to it, but it was a few years ago, before I even heard this track specifically."
weezer,3cstj4,TheWrongButton,3,Fri Jul 10 16:12:24 2015 UTC,You should tweet him! I hear he likes to go on Twitter a lot!
weezer,3cvx42,pruettcc,3,Sat Jul 11 05:38:17 2015 UTC,Maladroit is a gargley Green album. I totally see it. I think that's why I love it. I really like the songs on Green but I dislike is production.
weezer,3cvx42,kobun04,3,Sat Jul 11 13:29:15 2015 UTC,I get that you have many unpopular opinions but you don't have to constantly remind us of that. Music is a different experience for everyone so post your list and be proud you could be brave enough to throw yourself out there.
weezer,3cvx42,Veymex,2,Sat Jul 11 22:49:13 2015 UTC,"I don't really agree with most of this, but it doesn't bother me. People can like what they like. That being said, I had to comment that the bridge of Everybody Get Dangerous is great and is the best part of the song, haha."
weezer,3cvx42,bubdrools,0,Sun Jul 12 01:07:05 2015 UTC,I guess on Everybody Get Dangerous I thought the part about ninja swords was too much for me.
weezer,3cvx42,plorry,2,Sun Jul 12 05:21:26 2015 UTC,"My thoughts: I don't care how you rank the songs. We'll all probably disagree with your list, but that's no big deal. But your explanations all read like apologies: ""Sorry, I know you won't like this.""  Really, it's fine, give your list, and give your explanations for why; no need to apologize every time :P"
weezer,3cvx42,CS2603isHard,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:32:51 2015 UTC,I guess we just have vastly different tastes in music. Good for you for posting your list though.

weezer,3cocqw,danohart,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:23:06 2015 UTC,"Personally, I had a good time as well. But those chairs really put a damper on things. They totally took away from the show atmosphere.

weezer,3ci9jt,ibelieveyoubutmy,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:44:41 2015 UTC,So great! Best show of my life.  Kind of upset they switched out El Scorcho for Perfect Situation but given the crowd I can see them wanting to play more popular songs. So shocked they played tired of sex honestly.   Had a PERFECT view too. Front of the lawn dead center. Nothing can top tonight.

weezer,3cicuz,kobun04,3,Wed Jul 8 03:29:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, pretty sure it's just a one off side project. The whole album is super J-Poppy compared to most of weezer's stuff, but the melodies are solid. Lyrics are pretty simple too,  standard pop stuff. It's neat for what it is but not something I think he'll pursue much further."
weezer,3cicuz,tophmcmasterson,2,Wed Jul 8 04:42:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I listened to the album and its very much Jpop. But the live videos on YouTube are Jrock / nerd rock sounding. I think Weezer fans would probably enjoy that stuff."

weezer,3ch9qo,isaacandcompany,16,Tue Jul 7 22:11:45 2015 UTC,"I don't ""hate"" it, but it's definitely my least favorite. The way I see it is not as a Weezer album, but as a rivers pop album. The guitars that Weezer are known for aren't present. It feels like it was made for pop radio, but wasn't good enough for pop radio."
weezer,3ch9qo,duneschreibar,6,Tue Jul 7 22:19:20 2015 UTC,"I like the song ""Let it all Hang out"""
weezer,3ch9qo,ConnorFin22,2,Wed Jul 8 02:24:54 2015 UTC,"To me this song perfectly encapsulates the thesis of the album. Is the song or the album deep or thoughtful? No. Is it sad or reflective? Of course not. It is by and large fun, upbeat and just well letting it all hang out.   This album was released in 2009 at the height of the financial crisis. People were down and sad and their lives were in ruins. Times were tough and Weezer put out a feel good album that just wanted to cheer themselves and the rest of the world up. I can appreciate it from that angle.   It probably is my least favorite album but I still enjoy it."
weezer,3ch9qo,maxpenny42,5,Wed Jul 8 02:41:34 2015 UTC,"I think it has some great melodies and fun tracks. But there are also lame production elements and lyrics that bring it down for many. It's hard to take seriously. I like most of it, just not as much as I like the rest of Weezer's material. Aside from ""I Want You To"" and maybe ""I Don't Want To Let You Go,"" I'd be too embarrassed to listen to it with someone else."
weezer,3ch9qo,burndtjamb2000,8,Wed Jul 8 00:29:43 2015 UTC,This album is a complete sell out attempt. For gods sake Dr. Luke helped write a track.  You just can't compare this album to any decent/good Weezer release.
weezer,3ch9qo,Gsharpflat,4,Wed Jul 8 00:18:45 2015 UTC,"yeah, i think if you look at it objectively it's not awful. but compare it to any of their good albums and you can definitely see why people dont like it. specifically, lyrically, the blue album had ""in the garage,"" rivers' anthem for being lonely and dorky and accepting that. and in ""raditude"" we have ""cant stop partying"" where he's mumbling about how awesome he lives and how great his life is with (just as the icing on the cake) lil wayne backing him up. people also had the same problem with red album.  alternatively, with pinkerton, the personal and creative lyrics are replaced by the braindead / cookie cutter mush that is ""in the mall"" and ""let it all hang out."" i also hate that those are the only two albums i can think of comparisons to, but most of the other albums also had these issues, but not nearly as severe / common as raditude."
weezer,3ch9qo,BlackQuartz,3,Wed Jul 8 01:00:17 2015 UTC,"Just to play Devil's advocate here, those two songs were written mostly by Pat and Jermaine Dupree."
weezer,3ch9qo,Michaeljayfoxy,2,Wed Jul 8 01:23:40 2015 UTC,"I don't hear ""Can't Stop Partyin'"" as a bragging song at all. Maybe because I heard the Alone acoustic version first but I think it is a very sad and melancholy song. It's not about a guy getting drunk and having fun partying. It is about an addict who leads a hollow life but literally cannot stop. It is all he has."
weezer,3ch9qo,maxpenny42,2,Wed Jul 8 02:37:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that, or it's just a tongue in cheek ironic song parodying generic pop music. That's how I've always heard it and I actually like it..."
weezer,3ch9qo,hperron01,12,Thu Jul 9 00:21:04 2015 UTC,I can't sugarcoat it: it sucks. There's absolutely no quality material on the album. It gives off the feeling that they just wrote stuff to put an album out.
weezer,3ch9qo,bjisba41,3,Wed Jul 8 00:10:12 2015 UTC,"Compare it to their earlier stuff. Songs of pain, loneliness, dealing with personal flaws with a lot of depth, replaced by super overproduced pop songs. You have just straight garbage like in the mall, the ruining of can't stop partying by trying to make it a party song and shoehorning lil Wayne in, the train wreck that was love is the answer, mixed message awkwardness of I'm your daddy (along with some total nonsensical lyrics)... I'd say above all else, it just sounds so far away from being a ""weezer"" album. Especially at the time, coming after Red. Like, red had some missteps that were a bit worrying to people, but still had heart in a lot of songs. And then it was like he embraced all the things people didn't like and went with it. It was the only weezer album where I was just immediately disappointed hearing the samples to the tracks. There are a few decent pop songs on it, like if you're wondering is fine, put me back together is a decent all American rejects song.... But it just didn't really sound like weezer. And that's why people hate it."
weezer,3ch9qo,tophmcmasterson,2,Wed Jul 8 04:48:14 2015 UTC,"Put me back together, trippin down the freeway, and I want you to are all fun and decently written. Everything else just blew."

weezer,3ch9qo,droninglocust,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:21:20 2015 UTC,I actually kinda like Raditude. I prefer it to Make Believe and it's probably tied with Hurley which are both just below Maladroit.  Can't Stop Partying is one of the better songs on the album imo. But no song really stands out.

weezer,3c995f,duneschreibar,5,Mon Jul 6 02:19:23 2015 UTC,"Ah okay. So I guess they successfully cut ties since they're no longer on the Republic website.  I kinda wish they stuck with Epitaph. I know Hurley was still pretty much a pop album, but Epitaph if known for its rock and punk acts. I feel like that label would have been a great place for the guys to start getting rocking again. I feel Blue, Pinkerton, Maladroit, and maybe Make Believe would have fit well as Epitaph releases."

weezer,3c9656,wolffpack8808,2,Fri Jul 10 13:14:28 2015 UTC,"Even though it is a tree, I think that there is a strong connection between these albums. I thought about it while I was watching some old interviews of Rivers'. He had described Pinkerton as the struggle with his inner Pinkerton (womanizing, rock star side of him) and said that he recognized this part of himself, but the album has no solution in the end. I feel that EWBAITE is an album that focuses around self acceptance and forgiveness, as well as coming to terms with one's own past and looking forward to the future with hope that everything will be alright. It seems to me that EWBAITE is Rivers way of coming to terms with his inner Pinkerton and accepting and forgive his own mistakes, as well has the shortcomings of others in his life. This is why EWBAITE is my favorite album since Pinkerton. It just really fits into the bands progression through life very well."
weezer,3c8e34,acavaelusuario,8,Sun Jul 5 21:29:49 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure how to describe how I feel about this song, it just seems like Rivers is just listing musicians and I feel that there could probably be more to it. Honestly, I feel it's quite boring.  EDIT: I've got it. I feel that this song is Rivers listing musicians he considers to be great, and who inspired him and who he wants to be like, and it feels like he wrote this song because he does not believe he is a great musician, maybe due to the failure of Pinkerton (Although that was almost 10 years before this album and the success of Beverly Hills may have restored some hope in himself) and I think that I do not like this song because it seems he does not consider himself a great musician when actually Pinkerton is arguably one of the greatest albums ever written, and i think this song is Rivers feeling sorry for himself when there is no reason to.  TL;DR Rivers is feeling unnecessarily sorry for himself."
weezer,3c8e34,ajdj99,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:10:17 2015 UTC,"Hey I know this is a week old but I've been listening to Red a lot lately & I think there's something you missed about this song.   The beginning of the song Rivers is just listing all his favorite artists and musicians he listened to growing up. But then the bridge, he explains how when he heard Nevermind by Nirvana, it broke some proverbial chains for him and allowed him to start a band and get his own music out there.  Then at the very end he comes to the slow realization that now there are others who consider his (Rivers') music to be a ""heart song"" of their own. This is evidenced by the line ""a song comes on the radio and now people go 'this is the song' ""."
weezer,3c8e34,MustBeNice,3,Mon Jul 13 22:01:15 2015 UTC,"as with a lot of the red album (and kinda raditude for that matter) the lyrics are bad but has a great melody. in this case, it's just a bit boring rather than stupid. it's got some interesting rhymes but otherwise there's just not a lot going on here. the instrumentation is really the same thing all throughout. one of the worst songs on the album, definitely.   it's weird to think that this and pig were on the same album."

I like to stream of consciousness sing and they kind of end up like this song. There are either too many syllables or too little syllables in certain lines.  I also really don't like when the tiny electric drum flourish in the background.  I do like the build up and last half of the song though! 2:27 through the end sounds great to me!

The melody is unmistakably Weezer, the lyrics have a great playfulness, the solo is crunchy and killer and it was recorded during the red album era and then used for Rad.   From the Weezerpedia: This song was confirmed to be on Raditude by Rivers Cuomo on August 21, 2009 in an interview with Billboard magazine. Patrick Wilson, the band's drummer and sometimes guitarist, plays the guitar solo on this song. The song is notable for featuring something closer to the classic Weezer sound on the otherwise more pop-oriented Raditude. Wilson has named the song as a recent favorite in the band's catalog, and was known to have, along with Karl Koch, pushed for the song to be a single. Band Commentary Rivers: ""Tripping Down the Freeway"" I wrote like right after I wrote ""Pork and Beans"". It just sounds like a classic Weezer song. Actually it may sound similar to ""Pork and Beans"" 'cause it was written right at the same time. I don't know. [1]"

weezer,3bzsm2,UWbadgers16,4,Fri Jul 3 16:56:49 2015 UTC,"After your first post I had to go back and listen to Pinkerton.  A lot of their songs have a weirdness to it, but Pinkerton especially.    Completely unrelated, sometimes when I don't listen to Pinkerton for a while I forget how well the album flows.  Tired of Sex might not be my favorite Weezer song, but it's one of the best opening songs on any album. I'd argue that it's a better song to open an album than My Name is Jonas. After that first verse in Tired of Sex when they really kick it into gear...fuck man still gives me chills after all this time."

But it just was so far removed from being a Weezer song to me, I think I've listened to it maybe twice while other albums I've listened to hundreds of times.   Can't stop partying is bad, with Lil Wayne and the club vibe, but if you listen to the acoustic version from Alone II it's actually a good song. Has a totally different feel/meaning when it's played more somber."

It may not be as well known just for the fact that it wasn't a single, but it's anything but underrated."
weezer,3bwgox,SigmaQ,5,Fri Jul 3 04:49:54 2015 UTC,"Rivers isn't really a perfect narrator, especially on Pinkerton. In this song, Rivers displays his infatuation with a mysterious person who claims to be a 16 y/o girl. However, Rivers did have a painkiller problem while writing 3/4ths of these songs, so I could see why his head might not be in the right place."
weezer,3bwgox,BlackQuartz,7,Thu Jul 2 21:59:27 2015 UTC,"On the lyrics he said ""18 year old"" and at the moment he thought that she was probably a 14 y/o that probably didn't even spoke english (I think he said this on an interview).  Pinkerton is a weird album, I don't see it as a ""conceptual"" album but more as a letter to how he was feeling at the time. It's amazing how Rivers changed his mind from ""Pinkerton is our worst album and I don't even want to play it live anymore"" to ""Hey, it was a cool album, we should really play it from top to bottom"", but I bet it was probably criticism what caused that."
weezer,3bwgox,martyng18,6,Thu Jul 2 22:04:36 2015 UTC,"Used to be one of my least favorites on the album, although it's definitely grown on me.

weezer,3bwgox,Kododon,3,Thu Jul 2 23:51:02 2015 UTC,"This is probably my most favorite Weezer song. It does get borderline strange if you consider the addressee of the song, but I find that it's overshadowed by the way that Rivers fleshes out the feelings that come about from the incident (of receiving a letter from the 18-year-old): longing and desperation   why are you so far away from me   I need help, and you're way across the sea    alienation    this business is really lame   I've got to live on an island to find the juice   so you send all your love from all around the world   as if I could live on words and dreams and a million screams   oh, how I need a hand in mine to feel    and constant reassurance:   I've got your letter   you've got my song"
weezer,3bwgox,VenomWolf,3,Fri Jul 3 02:42:23 2015 UTC,"The way he sings from ""As if I..."" until ""to feel"" is just beautiful, I really feel like he was in pain when those lines where sung(I'm not sure if it's spelled right). The delivery of that line made the song more powerful and it really gives a great ""pre final chorus"" vibe."
weezer,3bwgox,elmariachi304,2,Fri Jul 3 04:16:40 2015 UTC,"It's pure brilliance. The way he switches from falsetto on the word ""screams"", giving it full force, it's songwriting perfection."

weezer,3bwgox,kobun04,2,Thu Jul 2 19:52:44 2015 UTC,"More than the lyrical construction, musically this song just goes to so many different places. It employs similar extended bridges like in The Good Life (my favorite on the album) and utilizes a variety of chords. In a way it reminds me of Jim Steinman's melodramatic operatic rock tunes, in that it uses harmonic slight of hand to tug the emotional strings. The piano plays a key role in setting up the overall theme of the song, establishing a main melodic hook from the chorus and coming back to fill out the harmonies in the quiet break. There's more to say, but I absolutely love this song and spent a great deal of time listening to it, learning it, and still enjoying it. There's a lot to chew on with this song."
weezer,3bwgox,BlackQuartz,2,Fri Jul 3 01:56:26 2015 UTC,"Probably the third best song on the album, surpassed only by Tragic Girl and Tired of sex, in that order."

To me, it's a lot like John Lennon's Imagine in that it's a song I have to be ""ready"" for.    Another one of my favorite lyrics comes from Unspoken:    ""Every chance that I get I am placin' a bet on the sun in the sky as it sets out of sight And I hate what you do when your poison seeps through and you're laughing at me""    IMHO, Unspoken stands on the same level as anything Cuomo did in the Blue/Pinkerton era."

I guess they got lucky that Green Day stayed successful, but if they picked another band that was only big for a few years in the 90s like Blind Melon or something then the song would sound really dated. I guess he does use the names of old wrestlers in the same song (https://youtu.be/1Q2DCV7DL-Y?t=338), but the lyrics sound so absurd that it kinda doesn't matter anyway."

EWBAITE is definitely second for me, there are a lot of really great songs (Ain't Got Nobody, I've Had It Up To Here...) the production on the album is just less than stellar in my opinion. It can get really sludgey at times or there will be some really terrible guitar tones (Cleopatra). It also has some songs that embrace the whole ""let's rock!"" thing a bit too much and just really leave a bad taste in my mouth (Shack and the second half of Anonymous)  Green is third, okay songs and really sterile boring performances and production. There are some really great melodies on Smile, Photograph, and Island but the whole album just lacks balls, for lack of a better term.   Fourth I'd say Red. There are some interesting choices made on it that make it a pretty refreshing album but there are some pretty awful lows that also result from this. A lot of songs that don't follow the typical Weezer formula and still manage to be awesome, like Cold Dark World or any of the bonus tracks. If we got some of the deluxe bonus tracks on the regular album I'd definitely say it has this spot or higher but the regular track list just had some really bad songs (Cold Dark World).   Here is where my interest starts to drop. Maladroit has a lot of songs at aren't good but not necessarily bad. I feel like I come to the album just for Burndt Jamb, everything else kinda just meshes together and becomes a blur with the occasional cool guitar lick standing out.  Make Believe is just really uninteresting. I enjoy This Is Such a Pity, but the rest of it is just really boring. I feel like this album is an attempt to be really mature and serious in some ways and I just can't sit through it and be interested the whole time.   And the bottom is sort of the same as the top for me. Hurley has better songs and better highs than Raditude but the production is just awful. Hurley just sonically sounds bad to my ears and while Raditude isn't that much better in that regard it still is more listenable than Hurley. Hurley though, has a few songs that are pretty great (Ruling Me and Unspoken)   All just my opinion, and sorry for any bad sentences or anything I'm on mobile"

My next favorite album is Maladroit. I know that Maladroit is a bit of a departure from their normal sound, but I really like some of these songs that are unique, but distinctly Weezer.  Make Believe is next on my list. This is, in my opinion, one of the most emotional albums since Pinkerton if not the most, and I think that it's too frequently overlooked.  Green, Red, and EWBAITE are all fun albums, and I really like some of the songs on each of them.  Hurley and Raditude... I don't hate them, or even dislike them. Hurley has many redeeming qualities, and from time to time I listen to Raditude. But they are different from the other albums, and I just prefer the other albums.

weezer,3ax3w1,brownstones19,2,Wed Jun 24 06:20:52 2015 UTC,I love his solo work. A lot of the songs that are on Alone and Alone 2 are actually derived from Songs from the black hole (some of my favorite Weezer material) and the mere fact that it gives me an idea of what it would've sounded like makes me love his solo work.
weezer,3ax3w1,plorry,1 point,Wed Jun 24 11:58:35 2015 UTC,"You could probably collect the best from those three releases and put it into a pretty solid album (apart from the Black Hole tracks).  Wanda, Crazy One, I was Made for You from 1.  My Brain is Working Overtime and I'll Think About You from 2 are super catchy.  3's gems aren't as polished, but Lisa, Let Me Wash at Your Sink are solid, and I'm on Fire, You're a Liar has something to it.  I really dig these albums."

Being such a sucker for harmony though, I remade it in Craig's style with Weezer harmonies. Tough to discern the notes at parts, but I feel comfortable enough to share it.  ......"
weezer,3ajz1u,countchocula535,4,Sat Jun 20 23:07:04 2015 UTC,"Hope you don't mind a bit of constructive criticism!  Before even checking the comments, I could tell right away this rendition owed a lot to Craig's version.  Now, that's not a bad thing!  He did a really impressive arrangement of this track, and his voice suited it really well.  However, it feels like at certain times you're sort of taking on his accent with some of the vocal deliveries.  I can tell from most of the singing that you don't have a Scottish accent, and it makes some of the delivery here come off as kind of forced.  For an example of what I mean, look at your pronunciation at the beginning of ""spinning 'round and 'round,"" it just sounds kind of off.  That said, this is still a really solid take and you have a nice voice!  Your harmonies are pretty solid, and it works to add a certain level of depth to this track without losing any of the simplicity that this arrangement is based off of.  I'd really like to hear a version with your singing coming off as a bit more natural, is all!"
weezer,3ajz1u,thezeus_,2,Sun Jun 21 06:08:55 2015 UTC,"I hear ya loud and clear. I did kinda pronounce a few things in an accent--I notice most heavily on ""I'll make it 'appen"". You're spot on in assuming I don't speak with an accent, but there was something about the smoothness of Craig's delivery that added something to this song, in my opinion.  Thank you for the criticism though--that's why I threw this to the wolves. I need to redo some harmonies since I was having to pick them out--as the recording progresses they become more solid as I get more comfortable with the chords.   But yes, thank you for the listen and the kind words."

weezer,3afmch,donut77,13,Fri Jun 19 19:08:53 2015 UTC,I do hate how Maladroit seems to get overlooked. It's arguably my #3 behind Pinkerton and Blue.
weezer,3afmch,Rezurrect,5,Fri Jun 19 21:49:52 2015 UTC,"Exactly! I recognize how pinkerton is lightyears better on a critical/technical standpoint, but personally i enjoy listening to Maladroit more"
weezer,3afmch,kupovi,4,Sat Jun 20 05:04:37 2015 UTC,"Maladroit today is sublime.  Maladroit when it came out was competing against Blue, Pink and Green. It was no wonder why it wasn't well received.  I did like it alot back in the day in 2002 but I thought it was weakest.   Today, it is even better. It aged well and is outstanding. Heck, I'd love a Maladroit 2.  Its all about context."
weezer,3afmch,TheGayAliensAreHere,2,Sat Jun 20 07:30:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, not only this, but there was quite a bit of dispute between Weezer and the fans at the time of the release of this album, mostly due to the whole demo situation and people being disappointed that certain songs were left off."
weezer,3afmch,brownstones19,4,Wed Jun 24 19:57:01 2015 UTC,"Well I suppose since Blue and Pinkerton (and you could probably add Green in too) get all the positive attention, while Make Believe, Red get the more divided criticisms, and finally of course f--king Raditude.  So basically Maladroit get's overlooked, but I think amongst fans it lies somewhere between praise and division, it has good riffs, hooks and melodies, but the lyrics are a bit undercooked or under-thought; and what you think about Maladroit depends on where you lie on the music vs lyrics spectrum."
weezer,3afmch,tophmcmasterson,4,Fri Jun 19 22:11:49 2015 UTC,"I see your point. I guess the lyrics are kind of 'middle of the road' to the majority of fans, but some of these songs really hit a sweet spot for me. specifically Slob, Slave, American Gigolo, Burnt Jamb, and  Death and Destruction"
weezer,3afmch,theangelandtheone,2,Sat Jun 20 05:01:28 2015 UTC,"I don't ever really think it got overlooked, it's just kind of a middling album in the same way that green is. It's got some great songs, and some meh ones. After Pinkerton, it is kind of lumped in with Green I feel as being competent but not really personal in the lyrics department. It also kind of has that ""designed by committee"" aspect to it given how much fan input it got. and as a result doesn't feel as cohesive as their best albums. It's by no means a bad album, it just isn't top tier like Blue/Pinkerton, and for me EWBAITE."

I have no clue, maybe some will think it's very good, while others will think it's a creepy and/or misogynistic album; I remember back in high school I mentioned something about Weezer and/or Pinkerton and someone said that Across the Sea was a really creepy perverted song, and they're not wrong.  :P"

weezer,3accmc,Powerstars,2,Fri Jun 19 00:44:15 2015 UTC,Absolutely great album. I first discovered it this year and was surprised people used to dislike it. It & Maladroit are my favorite Weezer albums.
weezer,3accmc,valkyrie249,3,Fri Jun 19 01:02:50 2015 UTC,"The initial dislike I think was a backlash as it was a follow up to blue. People were expecting more power pop, like the green album for example, and they got this brutally honest, at times uncomfortable, abrasive sounding album. It took a while for a lot of people to really ""get"" it, and look at it as it's own piece of work and not the blue album #2."
weezer,3accmc,tophmcmasterson,2,Fri Jun 19 03:25:40 2015 UTC,"I think most fans consider it their best album, some #2 compared to blue. It's by far their most raw, emotional album, and many of their best songs are on it. It's pretty abrasive to a lot of people on first listen, but despite that it's incredibly melodic. For me personally I think it's easily their best."
weezer,3accmc,tophmcmasterson,2,Fri Jun 19 03:23:13 2015 UTC,"My favorite album, hands down. I've never gotten sick of it, and the emotions are just there dude. I wasn't around for the old guard, but when I ran into around 2011 it was love at first sight."
weezer,3accmc,Protostorm216,2,Fri Jun 19 21:14:58 2015 UTC,"I don't have a lot to say that others haven't already said, just that Pinkerton is a masterpiece and easily my #1 among Weezer albums. Just wanted to mention OP that your flair is killing me. It's ""could not"" translate you."
weezer,3accmc,Rezurrect,2,Fri Jun 19 21:55:47 2015 UTC,"Blue was fantastic and one of the best albums I had ever heard for many reasons, there was just something about Weezer.  Pinkerton dropped and HOLY SHIT, it was so raw, full of emotion and different.  It immediately became one of my favorite albums of all time and has stayed there for all these years.  The only complaint I ever had was that it always felt so short.  The deluxe edition fixed this spectacularly."
weezer,3accmc,crakker78,1 point,Sat Jun 20 03:26:19 2015 UTC,It's easily weezers best album in my opinion. It's just one of those cases where everyone expected one thing and got another. Many people didn't like it when it came out just because it wasn't anything like the blue album.
weezer,3adm10,OmniscientRogue,13,Fri Jun 19 06:48:15 2015 UTC,"This might be insensitive, but 90's slang usage of fag had more to do with being a pansy than it being homophobic."

weezer,3abnjp,Miki_Sayaka,11,Thu Jun 18 20:04:03 2015 UTC,"Overall it comes off as half baked and fairly forgettable. It has some fun tracks, but it also had songs like where's my sex and smart girls. I personally like unspoken the most, but also have a soft spot for run away and ruling me too. As a follow up to Raditude it's certainly better, and it showed them getting a little more back to their roots, but it didn't really have the cohesive feel of most of their other albums."

weezer,3abnjp,ultimatetodd,3,Thu Jun 18 23:05:36 2015 UTC,"I like the first 5 tracks, the rest of the album is forgettable imo. It's a pretty fast-paced, upbeat and fun album if that's your thing. Unspoken is brilliant, Ruling Me is probably one of their most underrated songs ever, and Where's My Sex is fucking awesome and horribly misunderstood. If people still don't know, the song is about socks. Replace ""sex"" with ""socks"" and suddenly it makes sense."
weezer,3abnjp,Rezurrect,3,Fri Jun 19 21:53:45 2015 UTC,"My favorite songs on Hurley are Memories, Ruling me, and Where's my sex. Heheh it's not really my favorite album but it doesn't suck either. Ranking wise I'd put it below raditude but that's albums not very high in my rankings either"

So just to outline the train of thought that got me here:    I was listening to Pinkerton after a long hiatus and I vaguely recalled reading an interview in which Rivers humble brags about his sexual conquests in groupie Japan. This would have been linked from the older Weezer boards when originally published. I try to find this article pulling phrases I recalled and find this blog post which mentions it was from a Playboy interview Googling combinations of ""weezer, playboy, interview"" just finds a whole lot of ""Beverly Hills"" and these references to Rivers Playboy interview from Karl's Corner #1  #2  So theoretically there is a Playboy interview out there in either an October or November 2002 Playboy  But as it turns out I was thinking about the ""Peepshow"" interview, which I discovered via a reference in this blog   TL;DR - Got my ""P"" publications confused."

But the jist of the video was that Rivers and Matt were being interviewed, and Rivers basically sat there giving one word answers while Matt did all the talking. The interviewer asked Matt what it was like working with Ric Okasek, and he told her that he never met him and that it was all done over the phone. Then he asked her to ask him what it was like working with Spike Jonze, and he told her he never met him either and the whole video was done over the computer (both lies of course). I got this totally backwards from my memory, check out the link below  Edit: aquí https://youtu.be/K3NLwSVfSzw"

weezer,39980p,CS2603isHard,3,Wed Jun 10 21:30:52 2015 UTC,"I think the first drum beat is different between the two if I remember correctly. FT's first beat seems more hollow. But I don't know, that seems silly."

weezer,38lu6g,frankypea,13,Sat Jun 6 07:50:42 2015 UTC,"Hm... I think your idea with Butterfly seems slightly contrived and is just a little too ""look at me, I'm sad"" for Rivers and Weezer. Also, I don't consider Butterfly to be a song of resignation, but a song of reflection in which he ultimately states that he's sorry for what he's done but had to do it.  I dunno, I'm just an internet guy with no better clue than you."
weezer,38lu6g,Nickamajig,7,Fri Jun 5 19:26:43 2015 UTC,"I really like the song, but the random interjection of distortion chords in the middle of the second half of Dreamin' throws the song off for me."

weezer,38lu6g,melithium,2,Mon Jun 8 18:44:23 2015 UTC,I would make Burndt Jamb and Photograph longer. I really enjoy those 2 songs and I think that if they were longer they would've been more popular.

weezer,38lu6g,HakiBlast,3,Mon Jun 8 01:45:50 2015 UTC,"I would add a solo to The Angel and the one with a similar style to ""Across the Sea, Falling for you, Say it aint so"". The solo itself would keep going from the build up at the end and soar. I really love that song and would have loved to hear a solo similar to the ones found on EWBAITE, Pinkerton & Blue."
weezer,38lu6g,prodigy_lover,1 point,Sat Jun 6 20:38:35 2015 UTC,"I would change El Scorcho so the ""how stupid is it"" part goes on longer, and eventually overlaps with the other members repeating ""I think I'd be good"" and then ends the song with a scream and a burst of guitar and cymbal."
weezer,38lu6g,epicwhale1,-2,Wed Jun 17 01:57:12 2015 UTC,"I'd change all of Pinkerton back into the Space Opera it was originally meant to be. A lot of the songs would be the same, but it would be a concept album with more abstract expressions of his feelings rather than the painfully direct expression we have on Pinkerton now. Either is phenomenal"
weezer,38lu6g,broad_h2o,6,Fri Jun 5 23:12:22 2015 UTC,"Pinkerton is a concept album though. It's very direct to be sure, but there's definitely a kind of narrative to it, dealing with his inner demons and accepting some responsibility for things he's done and the problems he faces. Songs from the black hole is an interesting idea but it wasn't nearly as developed as I think people have built it up to be."
weezer,38itt4,They-drew-firstblood,5,Thu Jun 4 14:33:41 2015 UTC,"I mean, it's no big secret that Rivers was a better song writer in the '90s than he has been in the '00s, right?

weezer,38itt4,teenagelabotomy,1 point,Thu Jun 4 18:15:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah I listened to that one and I still prefer the Raditude version. I like how the rhythm is more cadenced, it makes the chorus punch more for me. I dig the Alone version too though, Weezer is definitely best in a more lo-fi setting in general."
weezer,38itt4,chellemic,1 point,Thu Jun 4 20:45:20 2015 UTC,"Back in early 2009 (between Red and Rad's releases) a fan-made album came out called HOMiE!  It was an attempt to cover the best material that was written and performed but never officially released between 1997 and 1999.  The collection of tracks is fantastic and you should give it a listen.  BUT, the version of Prettiest Girl that came out of those sessions is my all-time favorite version of the song:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dk8EeJhEB4c"

weezer,38itt4,Rezurrect,5,Wed Jun 10 00:23:37 2015 UTC,"If You're Wondering... is a great song along with a couple others.  Turn Me Round is my fave and it's also a bonus track.  I disagree on ""Lame."" though.  Several of the best songs on Red are also bonus tracks IMHO.  Big whoop.  Who knows, maybe there are better songs from EWBAITE that we haven't heard, yet!"
weezer,38itt4,Jo3bot,2,Thu Jun 4 18:17:41 2015 UTC,"I'm not crazy about Turn Me Round. If You're Wondering is a good song but it's not very Weezer-y in my opinion. It's definitely a solid pop song though.  I really only dig 3 songs on Red, Pork and Beans, Greatest Man, and Dreamin. Troublemaker is okay. I really can't listen to the rest of it.  But yeah I really hope we get some EWBAITE bonus tracks."

They were encouraged by the host to converse with and comment on the stripper guests, and they gave it an attempt. This episode was unfortunately included on the 'Colins Sleazy Friends' DVD collection.""  https://web.archive.org/web/20140519062701/http://daveandnikolai.com/wzr/classic/03_Recording_History/WeezRecHist10.html  And a longer version of the clip: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9MGDp9YOtM"

weezer,375w5b,bokkasrealm,4,Mon May 25 12:39:08 2015 UTC,"This is what Karl said about it in the AMA he did a while back:  ""not much - there were 2 takes of the song that were combined but after that there was still a line of lyrics that was missing, so Rivers had to find the old lyric sheet (we didnt know what the words were) and re-sing that one line. Plus there was a guitar part that needed doubling, it was only on one side of the stereo image.""  http://www.reddit.com/r/weezer/comments/1n2fbe/ama/ccesmlf"
weezer,375w5b,burndtjamb2000,2,Mon May 25 23:46:00 2015 UTC,"I read the whole AMA, but had not seen this question yet. interesting, it looks like they changed all the vocals to sound like the same recording"
weezer,375w5b,burndtjamb2000,2,Tue May 26 02:11:03 2015 UTC,"That's possible, but I don't know if they went that far. If they only recorded one line for the Deluxe then why not just adjust that instead of the rest of the vocals? Plus the two vocal takes from 1996 probably didn't sound all that different from each other, it seems like there were just parts in one take that weren't in the other.  The song was recorded in a different session from the rest of Pinkerton and wasn't even mixed down until ~2010 so different sound engineers were involved. I don't know much about sound recording but those seem like more plausible explanations to me for perceived differences in Rivers' voice. I don't think it sounds like his voice on Hurley/Rad."
weezer,375w5b,columnatedruins,6,Tue May 26 03:06:28 2015 UTC,a lot of the vocals are from 96. the first chorus is obviously the newer vocals but I don't know besides that

weezer,36wq7r,dude-O-rama,6,Fri May 22 19:58:32 2015 UTC,For me they've always been the same. Every album is different than the last yet somehow the same. I love the fact that they have songs I hate because it shows me that they are willing to try new things. Every album of theirs has been the kind of album that eventually grows on me. I've been a fan of theirs since the blue album but Pinkerton really grabbed me; It came out right around my 16th birthday and I could relate to the lyrics. I was big Green Day fan but I can't tell when I could not count on them to keep me interested with their content. I guess I feel like Weezer makes songs that no matter your age you can relate to them somehow.
weezer,36wq7r,doucheandturd,6,Fri May 22 20:18:55 2015 UTC,"The Good side  Weezer had probably for that time the best website around. Postings of demos, videos and Karl was really active, always a good source for weezer.  websites like weerez.com weezer.ws and so on was also all kickass sites and excellent sources for b-sides, live performances and such. Remember when I downloaded the Lupos gig from 00. I was fucking over the static. Still remember when Pat misses the intro to Why Bother 'cause of Rivers rushing into it.  And ofcourse the best thing was that Weezer returned from a long hiatus. I honestly thought the band was dead but then one day all of a sudden Green Album was mentioned and my obsession with Weezer was back.  The main ""bad"" thing about being a weezer fan during this time was not the albums or anything like that. It was the dysfunctional relationship between mainly Rivers and the fans.  When Maladroit came out I bought a magazine (prob. Kerrang) and there was an interview Rivers where he said something in the likes of that he hated the ""old fans"" and that they were annoying.   As being a loyal fan for years (Weezer is my first favorite band) and never even questioned what Weezer had been doing this made me... Well Not mad but it got to me. I felt to some extent betrayed. This was a guy that I thought was a genius and I was a big fan of and he hated me. If I read something like that today I wouldnt give a fuck but you know, teenagers man!  The late 2000's I don't really care about. M.B. was okay when it was released but today I find it ""meh"". Red Album was decent i thought but nothing special. At the release of this album I was at the University so I was not that interested to be honest.  When raditude came out I couldnt listen to it. What a complete turd of an album. I actually thought at that point that Weezer was lost forever. The red album was bland but atleast it had it shining moments. Raditude had nothing of that.  Hurley was okay but felt rushed. What was the deal with one album per year thing???  EWBAITE was a blast to listen to when it came out and made weezer fun again. The futurescope is probably one of weezers best efforts... According to me that is. Return to Ithaka is a fucking beast!"
weezer,36wq7r,megasnorkel,1 point,Tue May 26 15:15:06 2015 UTC,"Ha! Weerez.com! I love those weirdly misspelled signs in that video.  But about Rivers hating the old fans though... Wow. I mean, maybe he was fed up with people always saying they'll never bee as good as the younger version of themselves. I feel creative people need to keep some distance between their fans and critics just to stay sane."
weezer,36wq7r,RiversBromo,5,Wed May 27 01:36:36 2015 UTC,"STORY TIME  I got into Weezer around the time that Blue Deluxe came out [early 2004]. My fandom didn't really start becoming serious until the final days of Weezernation/early days of albumsix.com (mid-late 2007). I loved EVERYTHING that had been released up to that point. Even Make Believe. (Because everyone will defend the Weezer album that came out when they were in high school.)   Soon after, the first clips of Pork and Beans went up on .com, and I absolutely could not wait for Red to come out. I vividly remember the day that the first six or seven tracks leaked - one by one. I spent the whole day refreshing A6, downloading and falling in love with each of them as they went up. When June rolled around, I drove 30 miles to Best Buy to buy the album as soon as the doors opened. (At the time Red was one of my favorite Weezer albums. With the benefit of seven years of hindsight, I can see that the record was just a little bit flawed...)   The summer of 2008 was probably the height of my fandom. I started Weezerpedia with my internet buddy Martin. It was just a really great time.   Fast forward to July 2009. The Jisan Valley Rock Festival in South Korea. Videos of The Girl Got Hot, I'm Your Daddy, and the new ""OHHHH YEAHHH"" version of Can't Stop Partying are released. I am absolutely devastated.   I simply couldn't fathom how Rivers could go from writing something adventurous and different like TAATO to writing terrible butt rock like The Girl Got Hot. It didn't make any sense. Still, I held out hope until the album was released.   Then...things just got really stupid and I got more and more angry. First came the stupid album name. Then came the awful album cover. By the time Rad dropped, I was pretty much done with Weezer. Five years of fandom down the drain. I stopped working on Weezerpedia. I sold my collection. I deleted my account on A6.   Maybe I was just young and dumb and passionate. I couldn't accept that my favorite band would write and release music that was so...bad. I was embarrassed for Weezer/Rivers when I saw how they were promoting the album and presenting themselves. I just found the whole situation majorly cringeworthy, and I wanted to distance myself as much as possible from Weezer.   When Hurley came out, I bought it out of curiosity. Unlike Raditude, listening to Hurley didn't make me feel like Rivers was pissing all over my face and in my mouth. It was an improvement, but it was majorly underwhelming. It wasn't as offensively bad as Raditude. It wasn't offensive at all. It was boring and I didn't care about it. When I found out that every song was a cowrite and it was as close to a Rivers Cuomo solo album as we've had so far, I cared about it even less.   Fast forward to 2014 - hearing Back to the Shack for the first time was like watching the Girl Got Hot video from Korea all over again. I lost most of my hope for EWBAITE then and there. I still can't believe how good EWBAITE turned out being given the fact that THAT song was the one they chose to play/release first.  I'm nowhere near the fan that I once was. Maybe that just comes from leaving my teens and entering my mid-twenties. Maybe I'm still recovering from Raditude.

And Weezer was just the vehicle used to deliver that product.  I'm wondering why you had such a negative reaction to Back To The Shack. I feel like it's pretty inline with what Weezer is best known for: Chunky mid-tempo guitar heavy rock. Is it the lyrics? Perhaps too on the nose?"
weezer,36wq7r,bubdrools,1 point,Sat May 23 15:16:35 2015 UTC,"Part of my problem with it was that it struck me as pandering/disingenuous. And it's just not good. At all. It's all the BOOM BOOM CHOP of Beverly Hills with few redeeming qualities outside of the solo. Add to that the fact that it was cowritten by J-Kash (to what extent, who knows), and it was just like - Varz can't even write a song this bad on his own anymore?   I've made my peace with it. (I just deleted it from my iTunes. Ain't Got Nobody ---> Eulogy for a Rock Band is much better.)"
weezer,36wq7r,tophmcmasterson,2,Sat May 23 21:55:05 2015 UTC,"Aparently, all J-Kash did was come up with the name of the song. Apparently coming from Karl Koch: http://www.reddit.com/r/weezer/comments/2bdtmd/picture_of_back_to_the_shack_cowriter_its_the_guy/cj8reth  But yeah, I'm not sure why they use cowriters now. They had so many great songs without them.  What do you think about I've Had It Up To Here? The song shares a very similar tone. Do you get the same pandering quality from it?"
weezer,36wq7r,youriqis20pointslow,3,Sun May 24 02:16:50 2015 UTC,"Re: J-Kash - true. The cowrite factor wasn't what initially ruined the song for me, anyways. It was just kind of the cherry on top of the shit sundae. Ultimately, I don't really care if Rivers writes songs with other people or not. The super personal Rivers that wrote Pinkerton is gone, and I've come to terms with that. At this point, I just want the band to release songs that are good - even if they're cowrites.  I never really took issue with ""I've Had It Up to Here"". Even though it's sort of in the same vein as ""Back to the Shack"", it succeeds in a million ways that BTTS fails. Whereas the first verse of Shack is essentially Rivers begging the band/fans to take him back (""Wink wink, nudge nudge, Pat should play the drums again, I know what the fans want""), IHIUTH strikes me more as a mission statement by a guy who's genuinely realized that he wants to make music for himself. It's sort of a ""Pork and Beans [Pt. 2]"".  Perceived sincerity aside, I just think IHIUTH is a better song overall. Lyrically, musically, etc."
weezer,36wq7r,RiversBromo,2,Wed May 27 23:27:43 2015 UTC,"As someone who became a fan in 2001 with the Green Album, who then fell in love with Blue and Pinkeron, 02-03 was probably my favorite time as a fan, and 09-10 was my least favorite, but maybe not for the same reasons as others. I very rarely ever posted on .com or A6 boards back in the day, but I was always lurking. My impression was always that many original fans bailed with Maladroit or Make Believe, long before any of the Red/Raditude shenanigans.  I loved the .com era online, especially around summer of 02 when the early album 5 demos were being posted. It was the 02-04ish period where I feel like a lot of the best hidden gems were released online (Walt Disney, Longtime Sunshine, etc.) and the discussions were the most vibrant. I enjoyed Maladroit for what it was, but knew it wasn't in the same league as Blue or Pinkerton. I remember Maladroit being absolutely eviscerated on the .com boards at the time by many (particularly in the musical discussion forums where some pretty smart people made a lot of good points). Back then, I could understand and tolerate the criticism because it was mostly intelligent and based on the music, and Maladroit really was a big departure from the earlier albums. I do find it kind of funny that in the current fandom Maladroit is raised up to top 3 or 4 level by many, which I disagree with strongly (maybe influenced by that criticism back in the day), but I enjoy all of the albums so I don’t look down on people for liking it.  Having experienced all that, I was a fan of the band through all of the next albums, and when the online backlash came to a head with Raditude, it felt really unearned to me. Many of the people whose complaints I'd read became fans with Make Believe, an album I admittedly really like, but contains songs like Beverly Hills and We Are All on Drugs. Feeling betrayed by going from an album with WAAOD to an album with The Girl Got Hot felt totally unearned and disingenuous compared to the rage people had from going from The Good Life to Love Explosion. It was around this time that I felt like the online community was toxic and home to less intelligent and entertaining discussions than earlier in the decade. I kept listening to Weezer, but didn't spend nearly as much time on the forums. I had misgivings about Red and Raditude, but those albums also contained some of my favorite Weezer songs (The Angel and the One, Miss Sweeney, The Greatest Man That Ever Lived, I Don't Wanna Let You Go, Run Over By a Truck, The Prettiest Girl in The Whole Wide World). I could see not liking the album because of songs like Can't Stop Partying and Put Me Back Together, but the reactions for the most part felt really over the top for what the album was on the whole.  At this point the online ""fandom"" was far more embarrassing to me than the band or the music. The cries of sellout rang hollow when Rivers had already explicitly written Beverly Hills to be a hit single, publicly professed his love for pop music on many occasions, and was clearly just putting out music he enjoyed making (and had already bundled the most famous song in their catalogue into the main product of one of the world’s biggest corporations long ago).  Hurley might actually have been my least favorite Weezer album. It had their worst lead single, and their most bland and forgettable songs (many of which didn't sound like Weezer at all to me). The lows weren't that low compared to the last couple albums, but there wasn't much there to keep me interested for long. Thankfully, EWBAITE is easily my 3rd favorite Weezer album and I’m excited for whatever they put out next."

I'm not a Blue/Pink purist who only thinks their old music is good, and I've been a big fan of a lot of post-Pinkerton album cuts, B-sides, Alone tracks, and such.  EWBAITE to me is just okay. A couple of good tracks, some catchy lines and riffs here and there. But I don't really see it as worth celebrating. I do like it, but it just hasn't really grabbed me yet. I keep expecting it to, like Red did (even though Red had a few small groaners), it's just a big ""okay.""  I'm not trying to shit on your opinion—I promise, I do understand that bands change and that's for the good. But it doesn't seem like much of a return to anything—just a more coherent Hurley, in a way. Maybe I'll be proven wrong someday soon."
weezer,369vpb,shoegraze,4,Sun May 17 23:02:50 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, I think if they didn't hype it as if it was a return to their roots, it wouldn't be so well received.

weezer,369vpb,zck,8,Mon May 18 01:56:35 2015 UTC,"I'm wondering what you find cringey about EWBAITE. Some of the parts that might be awkward aren't held long enough to be irritating (e.g., the chanted intro to Ain't Got Nobody might be bad repated, but it's only said once, which isn't enough to grate), and there aren't awkwardly-titled songs that are repeated over and over, like ""Where's My Sex"" or ""The Girl Got Hot"".  And there also seem to be more personal songs -- many people don't like the Weezer songs full of bragadoccio. Compare Can't Stop Partying to Foolish Father or Back to the Shack -- songs that have an opinion that you can relate to without requiring to think about how much you love going to the club."
weezer,369vpb,shoegraze,4,Mon May 18 04:23:19 2015 UTC,"I feel like more of the cringey moments of this album come from a few different aspects.    Lyrics. It seems like a really botched attempt, at least to me, to be another Pinkerton and get on a real emotional level. I don't want to hear my favorite band playing a song straight up apologizing for their last handful of albums. I don't want to hear a 40-something year old married man with kids singing about how he ""ain't got nobody to kiss and hug me"". I don't see the sort of maturity that everyone else does when he's singing about girl problems for the ninth album in a row. And everyone seems to commend them for their ""newfound maturity"", apparently choosing to forget the red album (and its b sides specifically) all together. I think I physically wince every time I listen to the lyrics of ""Da Vinci"", too, as catchy as it is.  Falsetto. I'm all about trying new things in their music, but this is another example of how they're not ""going back to their roots"" so to speak, he's never sung like this before, and he does it in like, every song. Just me personally, I find this style of singing a little grating after a while from Rivers, and some of the melodies (""I've Had It Up To Here"" specifically) also get a little frustrating to these ears. Hurley, Red, Green, and Maladroit I'd say all had better melodies all around. There's just a lot of vocal inflections that just don't settle well with me (ie ""the brii-hee-tish are cuuuh-uhhh-meeng"").    Also,    there aren't awkwardly-titled songs that are repeated over and over, like ""Where's My Sex"" or ""The Girl Got Hot""   Note ""Go Away"", ""Lonely Girl"", ""The British are Coming""  By the way, I think ""Can't Stop Partying"" is brilliantly ironic and the acoustic version is even more brilliantly somber. Even if raditude isn't my favorite weezer album, I feel like a lot of their creativity was lost to the general demand for blue album part two when this new album came around."
weezer,369vpb,zck,2,Mon May 18 10:54:27 2015 UTC,"That's a deep response. Thanks.    Lyrics. It seems like a really botched attempt, at least to me, to be another Pinkerton and get on a real emotional level. I don't want to hear my favorite band playing a song straight up apologizing for their last handful of albums.    I can see why this bothers you. It doesn't me, possibly because after the first verse, it's less specific and more thematic -- not ""we were playing disco"", but ""back to the strat with the lightning strap"". Not ""Maybe I should play the lead guitar"", but ""I'm letting all of these feelings out even if it means I fail"".   I don't want to hear a 40-something year old married man with kids singing about how he ""ain't got nobody to kiss and hug me"". I don't see the sort of maturity that everyone else does when he's singing about girl problems for the ninth album in a row.   I understand that this line could be viewed as cringey. Do you see anything deeper in Ain't Got Nobody? It seems to me that it's an actual exploration of why he feels lonely (father issues), and deeper things (""That's human nature"").   And everyone seems to commend them for their ""newfound maturity"", apparently choosing to forget the red album (and its b sides specifically) all together. I think I physically wince every time I listen to the lyrics of ""Da Vinci"", too, as catchy as it is.   I do love the Red Album B-sides (at least, Miss Sweeny and Pig. I like The Spider, but don't get much out of King). I think it might suffer from Pork and Beans being overplayed. The rest of the Red Album I find fine, but it doesn't resonate. Was that the album that was hyped a bit as ""return to form"" before EWBAITE? As a side note, I just found out that the UK version had a cover of The Band's The Weight -- damn, that's an amazing song.    there aren't awkwardly-titled songs that are repeated over and over, like ""Where's My Sex"" or ""The Girl Got Hot""    Note ""Go Away"", ""Lonely Girl"", ""The British are Coming""   I don't find those awkward to hear repeated. It's not the specific repetition of a phrase that I find annoying; these are ok to me.   By the way, I think ""Can't Stop Partying"" is brilliantly ironic and the acoustic version is even more brilliantly somber. Even if raditude isn't my favorite weezer album, I feel like a lot of their creativity was lost to the general demand for blue album part two when this new album came around.   I love the version on Alone II, but not really the one on the album. I think the major chords, drum machine, and semi-buried vocals on the Raditude version make the song a lot worse. It doesn't sound somber. I'm not sure what my opinion would be, however, if I heard the Raditude version first.  Although it is a good question why EWBAITE was received better than some of the other albums. I wonder if some of it was the marketing, bringing the album as ""this is for fans"" without being empty promises. This last part I don't explain well. I'll think about it to see if I can explain what I mean better."
weezer,369vpb,shoegraze,-2,Mon May 18 15:15:41 2015 UTC,"As for Ain't Got Nobody, I feel like it tries to run deeper, but in that it comes off as cringey and unnecessary to me. Oh boo hoo Rivers. I like the guitar tone a lot though, and the song structure.   And come to think of it, I don't really like the album version of Can't Stop Partying, but I do in concept. I always find myself listening to the alone version, but that's mostly because of the production on the raditude one for me. I've still always thought of it as like Troublemaker or The Greatest Man - as an obviously silly joke song that everyone seems to take to heart and get offended by."

weezer,35uyrp,austindriver13,8,Wed May 13 22:50:21 2015 UTC,"Man...I'm sorry!  I'd try to circumvent. In fact I believe I remember reading about someone who wanted to go to an age-limited show. Subsequently the owner/manager/Idon'thonestlyremember read his post online and reached out to offer like a VIP exception or something along those lines.  Truthfully, if I were in your position I'd try and contact the venue (management if possible!) and see if they can't make an exception.  Weezer is an amazing act that puts on a safe show for all ages--this restriction is malarkey."

I've somehow failed to ever see them live despite them being my favorite band for over a decade (two missed opportunities). It's on my bucket list now to see them and the closest date to me right now is Cinci which won't work.
weezer,35rzyd,maxpenny42,2,Wed May 13 01:22:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've only seen them once at a music fest in December and they were fucking incredible, I'd love to be able to see them at a show where it's just them."
weezer,35rzyd,maxpenny42,4,Wed May 13 01:25:24 2015 UTC,I had two incredibly opportunities slip through my fingers. The first was FooZer up in Cleveland. I was in high school and my brother just got his license but the parents didn't want him driving an hour into the city yet. We went to homecoming instead. Worst decision of my life.   The second was the Blue/Pinkerton tour. A two night event in Chicago where you get to hear both albums performed beginning to end. It was sold out by the time I found out about it. There may have been tickets left but they were outrageously priced.

weezer,35rzyd,scottheisel,2,Thu May 14 16:00:55 2015 UTC,I'm curious where you're from if you went to the same shows. Also how much does the cruise cost?
weezer,35rzyd,scottheisel,2,Thu May 14 16:04:36 2015 UTC,"I live in Cleveland. The last cruise I wanna say was close to $1000 a person (plus airfare!), but we only had two people in our room and we had a window (whereas if you put more people in your room and/or have an interior room with no window, it's cheaper)."

weezer,35m6ll,DannoSpeaks,10,Mon May 11 17:24:21 2015 UTC,"This review, and other similar ones, I think suffer from ""industry group think"". Make Believe is not good, it's just ok, maybe even bad in areas. However it isn't some cataclysmic moment in music history that many reviewers gleefully tried to pin on it. In the pantheon of bad music and songs, this doesnt even start to scratch the surface of bad rock music. There are a few really good songs on this album that elevate the album a bit, such as Perfect Situation. The idea of Weezer tarnishing their past with this album is a blatant attempt at drumming up interest in his very strong opinion, the classic one upper strategy."

weezer,34wlwc,AnticitizenPrime,12,Tue May 5 03:58:06 2015 UTC,I disagree here. We will never get an album as good as Blue or Pinkerton. EWBAITE is dope though. Red has some great tracks but some aren't so great. Hurley is underrated. Make Believe is bad. Raditude is just garbage. Green is good. Maladroit is good.

There are a few duds on the album and the production is a bit too squeaky clean, but I think it's got more heart than people give it credit for.

weezer,34wlwc,felipenerdcore,4,Tue May 5 08:26:56 2015 UTC,Unfortunately I don't know the names of the tracks yet. I took a long road trip this last weekend and played the entire discography in my car (via my android head unit) on random.
weezer,34wlwc,zombietaz,7,Tue May 5 15:08:25 2015 UTC,"Hey, glad you found more music to listen to and that you enjoy it all! A lot of people don't share your opinion on most of Weezer's newer works, unfortunately.   Personally, I think there are songs of value on every album, and EWBAITE is certainly one of their best albums IMO! But many disliked the direction the band took on certain albums, Raditude in particular. With EWBAITE, they seem to be moving back in the right direction, and the future seems pretty positive :)"
weezer,34wlwc,coltonnashville,5,Tue May 5 13:19:35 2015 UTC,"I can relate! I actually only listened to the Blue and Green album and saw them on their Green album tour. I then started to listen to them again around Hurley and started backlogging everything and it is great. I saw them again on their Pinkerton tour in Vail CO.   Just watch out - Everyone here on reddit is grumpy Blue/Pinkerton only fans, so ignore their negative comments.  They can enjoy the 20 tracks while you and I listen to their discography and enjoy all of it :)"
weezer,34wlwc,ManateeHill,3,Thu May 7 22:02:54 2015 UTC,Agreed.   Post-Pinkerton albums were different but that shouldn't mean that they are bad songs. I can be in the mood for some Only in Dreams one day and Ruling Me the next. Apples and oranges.
weezer,34wlwc,Powerstars,2,Fri May 8 02:38:13 2015 UTC,"Pinkerton IS my favorite, and I believe the first two to be the best, but (aside from Pinkerton), I listen to Green and Red probably more than any other Weezer albums.

I'm glad you gave them an open ear and didn't shut it off when you heard a track like ""Can't Stop Partying""  Being in a similar boat, It's really nice that I can appreciate the band's works from a far and see how they progressed. Honestly, if I was a fan between 2005 - 2010 when they tried to find a new sound, I'm not sure if I would have stuck with them. Hindsight is everything."

weezer,34wlwc,toksinmafs,1 point,Wed May 6 04:09:12 2015 UTC,Best is a huuuuge stretch. It's an interesting concept and has some solid tracks but there's a reason it was unreleased. It was never finished. Most of what was there has been released now and while it's cool to listen to it's nowhere near their strongest albums.

While I like the complexity, you've got a lot of stuff in there and it might actually sound better or more palatable if you were to follow a more traditional song structure. The vocal part at the end could be reworked as the verse while the part after the intro could be used as the basis for a bridge."

weezer,34pslt,GoldenJalapeno,3,Sun May 3 14:04:04 2015 UTC,I did think about this. I feel like it does count because it's still a Weezer song on a Weezer album.
weezer,34pslt,GoldenJalapeno,7,Sun May 3 14:07:16 2015 UTC,Well... Maybe since it's rap it seemed suitable? The song isn't really typical Weezer anyways
weezer,34pslt,TenderPeaches,3,Sun May 3 14:09:15 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry but I disagree, the points you made in your post stated that Weezer hadn't swore in any of their songs and they could've used it to bring out emotions at the peak of an intense song. Yes it was wasted but I feel that it didn't really count because River didn't really use it himself, with his own emotions. Y'know?"
weezer,34pslt,Nickamajig,2,Sun May 3 22:18:45 2015 UTC,"I think I get what you're saying.  If I remember correctly, this song was kinda made from the perspective of a nightlife addicted kind of person. So yeah, It's really the words of a person facing their partying addiction. Not River's own emotions.  Whether it be Lil' Wayne or Rivers, neither of them are the actual character in the song. I do think that the singing part and the rapping part are both coming from the same character though. it's not a duet with two characters singing to each other like in Lonely Girl. All these lyrics are coming from the same character.  Man, of all Weezer songs, I didn't expect to think so hard about this one!"

The reference to female dogs is only him trying to justify what he said."
weezer,34pslt,zck,3,Sun May 3 15:40:56 2015 UTC,totally agree with you man...
weezer,34pslt,okaychalet,7,Sun May 3 22:29:53 2015 UTC,The original lyrics for Crab had many uses of the word bitch but the label made them change them all to crab.
weezer,34pslt,0x8086,5,Sun May 3 14:52:51 2015 UTC,"I had a similar reaction. Raditude featured a lot of experimentation away from Weezer's usual style, so I justify the f-bomb as part of that."
weezer,34pslt,okaychalet,6,Sun May 3 14:18:26 2015 UTC,"From a 2008 Rolling Stone interview:   I don't like to use real swear words. Weezer came up at a time when Jane's Addiction released ""Nothing's Shocking"" — everyone was trying to be controversial. We looked back to rock & roll's pre-drug days — to the clean im­ages of the Beach Boys — that felt, ironically, rebellious."
weezer,34pslt,neilxzagada,3,Sun May 3 18:24:03 2015 UTC,"Ah thanks!  Also, what's up with Rolling Stone calling out River's pauses. That's kinda a jerk thing to do.  I think there was an article calling out how many seconds the pauses were between his statements...."

Not (as much) around my kids but I've been seeing them weezer songs since they were still in their mother.    Maybe the best part is Rivers never came out and said ""we don't swear because....""  Or maybe he did?"
weezer,34pslt,Zushi,6,Sun May 3 14:24:53 2015 UTC,"If I recall correctly, Rivers stated that he doesn't like to swear that often in his music because at the time Weezer was starting to get traction, shock value and lots of swearing were present in a lot of Rivers' peer's music and saw the lack of swearing as a counter or rebellious to current trends."

weezer,34m8e1,kobun04,15,Sat May 2 12:33:18 2015 UTC,"What constitutes Nerd and Geek aren't really set in stone. I am from sort of the same generation as Rivers and while things like comic books, D & D and computers aren't really considered nerdy these days, they certainly were when we were kids.  I think the Nerd Rock label is more cause they are socially awkward, goofy guys who are intelligent but sort of slackerish. Most of their music is about feeling isolated, lonely, unrequited love and being uncomfortable with yourself - those feelings are sort of universal, but they do it in a way that nerds appreciate it and relate to more, plus their stylistic choices in terms of fashion, album art and music videos reflect a sort of nerd cool aesthetic. I dunno, not sure if I am making sense.  I am still not sure what constitutes a ""nerd band"" though... I mean, the ones people frequently mention as being in that category, like Devo, Weezer, Rush, Radiohead, Tool, The Descendents, They Might Be Giants, Primus, etc., don't really have that much in common besides having a large nerd fanbase. This is in contrast with Nerdcore (a genre I am not horribly familiar with as hip hop isn't really my thing), that deliberately goes out of it's way to reference ""nerdy"" things and look like stereotypical geeks."
weezer,34m8e1,TRexSparringPartner,4,Sat May 2 13:10:04 2015 UTC,"No! You are totally making sense. I see how those bands are grouped together.  There are a lot of newer bands that just name check every comic book/video game/tv show/movie.  The awkward, goofy, intelligent, slackery people making music, is very different than pop culture superfan making music.  What you are saying makes sense."
weezer,34m8e1,Gort25,2,Sat May 2 13:39:45 2015 UTC,"I can't say I'm an expert on geek rock or weezer's true intentions, but a lot of their lyrics are very tongue in cheek and make me feel like they are geeky."

weezer,34m8e1,ManateeHill,1 point,Sun May 3 01:45:35 2015 UTC,"I would say so, especially in their earlier years. The Blue Album definitely had the nerdy image connected to their songs. Only in Dreams, In the Garage, The World Has Turned and Left Me Here, Buddy Holly, and the music video for Say it Ain't So all have this.   You can tell they grew out of the nerdy image by a little bit either on purpose (by Rivers' writing and by including Scott) or consequently after all the years of performing. Hash Pipe, Cleopatra, Pork and Beans, Greatest Man that Ever Lived, and Troublemaker are some examples that have this slightly different image from their nerdy early years.   That said, something about Rivers' delivery still has a nerdy vibe and I love that. That's why I'd still call them nerd rock, among other things, despite their changed image."
weezer,34m8e1,ManateeHill,1 point,Sat May 2 14:08:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah. When I look at photos of the band's earlier days I say it's a bunch of geeks playing rock and roll.

""Brace for the awaken one"" probably referring to jesus.  ""He truly saved my life"" okay so probably Christian.  ""But after all his truth is small. And I love the lie.""  hmmm, a skeptical christian perhaps?   I think this song may be about him trying really hard to be a believer, despite the flaws of the religion. Simply because he needs to in order to feel like he has worth.  The next verse is about him giving into the worldly salvation of being in love, but eventually he turns it back to religion in the last section ""I'm ready to trust you""."

weezer,33jenc,neilxzagada,7,Thu Apr 23 00:15:25 2015 UTC,I love this song. One of my favorite Rivers songs. It basically encapsulates everything I like about Rivers' songwriting.
weezer,33jenc,musicnothing,2,Thu Apr 23 03:55:53 2015 UTC,"It's got a bit of a Beatles vibe, IMO. It's a very fun song!"
weezer,33jenc,oussan,2,Thu Apr 23 07:39:10 2015 UTC,"I agree. It's too catchy, I've caught myself humming it numerous times since I first heard it"
weezer,33jenc,ButchCheddar,2,Thu Apr 23 09:08:24 2015 UTC,"I also love ""Let Me Wash At Your Sink."" Both are so much fun."
weezer,33hl37,eightbic,7,Wed Apr 22 16:10:29 2015 UTC,"I don't really have a problem with it. Do you think someone has to keep it forever?  Also, you think of it as a gift given for being in the fan club. It's not unreasonable to think of it instead as purchasing a bundle of t-shirt, card, and the record. If someone just buys a record, it's not ethically wrong to sell it, so if you think of the fan club as just buying some stuff, it's fine."
weezer,33hl37,zck,1 point,Wed Apr 22 16:34:22 2015 UTC,And you don't think it's douchey to put it on ebay for 10x the amount of the fan club?
weezer,33hl37,pascha,5,Thu Apr 23 14:28:47 2015 UTC,"I don't really want to argue over whether it's ""douchey"" or not, as that's largely just ""I feel it's douchey"" responded to with ""well I don't"". I don't have a big problem with putting it on Ebay. I'm not putting mine up there."
weezer,33hl37,zck,-7,Thu Apr 23 18:45:26 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say keep it forever but capitalizing on a bonus for membership?   We are a pretty tight-knit family and when something like that happens it feels like a slap in the face.   If you didn't want it, you should give it to someone who does, not sell it to them for $400 dollars. I think it really goes against what the community means."
weezer,33hl37,zck,12,Wed Apr 22 16:55:12 2015 UTC,It's not a family. It's a fan club for the band.
weezer,33hl37,angelfromthecoast,5,Wed Apr 22 19:34:09 2015 UTC,Nah bro it's a family you should have seen the turnout for Thanksgiving /s
weezer,33hl37,zck,-6,Wed Apr 22 20:13:47 2015 UTC,You must not be a member.
weezer,33hl37,danfiction,8,Wed Apr 22 20:15:47 2015 UTC,"I am, in fact, although I had the fan club mail my stuff to a different address than mine (as I can't receive packages at my apartment), so I haven't picked it up yet. Maybe there's half a ""best friends"" necklace in it from Scott.  So what makes it a family? The semi-monthly emails? I guess I'm also in a family with a dude trying to sell me V1AGR4 and a nigerian prince.  Don't get me wrong; I'm a big fan of the band, and I think the fan club is cool, but I don't think me paying $40 gets Rivers to come over tomorrow for game night."
weezer,33hl37,zck,-1,Wed Apr 22 20:42:25 2015 UTC,"I didn't mean family with the band but with the community. Any event the fan club tries to get together and stay together. In Atlanta, we had the Atlanta house.   Hell, we even took a trip to Tennessee just to hang out together.   I think that makes us a family because we care about each other's lives and I know of one member who was having a rough time and we all reached out to them.  We send each other gifts and what not. I think that constitutes a family or at least a close-knit community."
weezer,33hl37,zck,8,Wed Apr 22 20:50:28 2015 UTC,"You're describing a group inside the Fan Club, not the Fan Club itself. It's cool that that group exists, and I love their enthusiasm, but a really tight-knit group is necessarily exclusionary, and it turns out your group has excluded me. No hard feelings, but I do resent your totally unwarranted policing of the larger group, which I am in fact as much a part of as you.   I didn't sign up for the Fan Club to be a part of the community; I'm totally happy with A6/ATW. I wanted the record, and that was how I could get the record."
weezer,33hl37,danfiction,4,Thu Apr 23 08:18:31 2015 UTC,I've heard of none of these events. You might have a closer connection to the fan club than everyone else -- and that's great -- but just paying $40 doesn't get one there.
weezer,33hl37,TyrannosaurusHives,0,Wed Apr 22 21:06:24 2015 UTC,Do you participate in the fb group?
weezer,33hl37,flea_nut_lance,2,Thu Apr 23 01:27:29 2015 UTC,Nope; I won't use facebook.
weezer,33hl37,wherewuz,10,Thu Apr 23 01:57:42 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of people (correctly) do not see it as a gift—it's what they paid the $40 for.   The record's great! I love the song. I'll keep the patch, too. And EWBAITE's a wonderful album, so I'm glad I preordered it. But I really didn't like the shirt design—I'm not going to wear it, so my options are to sell it to someone who will want to wear it or leave it in my closet until I'm dead.   Basically, I joined the Fan Club before it existed, and I did it for the cool stuff they advertised. I got the cool stuff, they got my $40, and I'm completely satisfied with the transaction.   I've never really commented much in the Facebook group, and now that a really tight-knit group has formed I don't think I ever will. Which is fine—it's just a little too relentlessly positive for me, so I don't spend much time there. I like being able to say ""A lot of songs on Raditude are terrible, but I still love Weezer"" without getting shouted down by people who seem to think I am personally insulting their kids who sing ""I'm Your Daddy"" every morning on the way to school.   It's cool that a lot of people ended up finding really close friends in the fan club, and I'm genuinely happy for them (and you.) But I'm not a part of it, and you don't get to dictate the terms of my purchase for me just because you're a part of that thing and I'm not, especially since it didn't even exist when I made that purchase."
weezer,33f5z5,Ripty,3,Wed Apr 22 00:49:23 2015 UTC,Makes sense. The production on the new song sounds straight outta Hurley. But the actual song itself doesn't sound like Hurley.
weezer,33f5z5,neilxzagada,3,Wed Apr 22 03:26:05 2015 UTC,Shawn is relatively cheap.  Same reason they used him for the Radiohead cover and the State Farm jingle.

weezer,33f5z5,RiversBromo,2,Tue Apr 28 15:21:24 2015 UTC,"Rivers said that he wrote this song around the EWBAITE release, and Shawn is probably just their go-to guy whenever they need something done but can't afford/don't feel the need for a more well-known producer. I wouldn't get your hopes up for a ""sea opera"" revival anytime soon."
weezer,33f5z5,burndtjamb2000,2,Wed Apr 22 15:25:15 2015 UTC,Nope. Just a new song for the fan club as they promised at the start of the ewbaite promo

weezer,33b2uj,trianglemap,4,Tue Apr 21 05:19:16 2015 UTC,I like it! Easily showcases Rivers' singing talent.  Killer chorus and I'm a big fan of the energetic piano complimented by the melancholy acoustic guitar. Overall a great song and there's good reason to believe Weezer is on the right track.

Or have I won the game we're playing?  That's all I really care about  It's kind of wonderful  Kiss me while we both are still intangible  CHORUS  Everybody needs salvation  And if it doesn't come we make some  Some people can get by on nothing  But I still need to know I'm something  Cause I still know I'm something  BRIDGE  I'm ready to love you  I'm ready to give my heart  I'm ready to trust you  Cause I ain't afraid of the dark  I'm ready to love you  I'm ready to give my heart  I'm ready to trust you  Cause I ain't afraid I ain't afraid  Of the dark  CHORUS  Everybody needs salvation  And if it doesn't come we make some  Some people can get by on nothing  But I still need to know I'm something"

weezer,33b2uj,GodIsTheSun,2,Tue Apr 21 06:24:35 2015 UTC,"What ambiguity? It's definitely Jesus, for all the reasons ManateeHill already said. Plus, the song is called ""Everybody needs Salvation"". What other historical figure (who wore a crown of thorns, is typically associated with sacrifice (the Om symbol), has a prayer rope, is commonly portrayed as seen on the cover, and is known for salvation) is there besides Jesus?

It's Jesus, of course, but you can bet one reason they didn't use a more stereotypical depiction, as well as adding an Om to his delt, was to add an edge of ambiguity.

weezer,32rsgn,kobun04,14,Thu Apr 16 04:46:43 2015 UTC,"Straight from the Varz's mouth (from the Alone II liner notes):     On September 10, 2007, Jermaine Dupri sent me a demo of a song he had started writing, ""Can't Stop Partying"". He also sent me his number to discuss where we could take the song. I gave him a  call. He told me that he had noticed that the rock world and the hip-hop world were both all about partying. He wanted to write a song -- and to find an artist to cover that song -- to show the unity between these two apparently disparate worlds. He thought Weezer was the perfect artist.   I thought about it long and hard. I had been a great admirer of Jermaine's songs, especially Mariah Carey's ""We Belong Together"", which had been a big influence on my recent composition, ""Heart Songs"". And I loved the demo he sent me of ""Can't Stop Partyin'"". It was so fun and catchy.   But the music sounded a little cheesy to me, like generic punk rock. And worst of all, the lyrics were clearly a celebration of drinking and drug-taking, which I could not sing without qualms. I tried to expand the lyrics to make them more in line with my values. That's when I realized what a true genius Jermaine is. His lyrics had seemed so simple to me, as if any seventh-grader could have written them, but when I tried to write a second verse, I couldn't manage to write anything one-tenth as good as his first verse! His lyrics were all about celebration. They were totally inclusive. My lyrics couldn't indicate confidence or joy without being at the expense of someone else. Every line of Jermaine's was so strong, so iconic, like a song title. My lyrics were awkward and strained. I set the song aside. In October, in another Vipassana course, it suddenly occurred to me that I could change the meaning of the song, not by changing the lyrics, but by changing the music under the lyrics. When I got to my wife's family's house in Japan after the course, I picked up a guitar and strummed the four chords that you hear on my demo of the song. These chords suggested sadness and resignation in the face of something ineluctable, something fated, a drug-habit, a drinking addiction. Suddenly, ""I Can't Stop Partying"" might be a sad thing to say, and this was the undertone which, I believed, allowed me to sing the song with conviction. Was it a celebration? Or an elegy for one lost? I didn't know. But I thought it was beautiful. And that's all I've ever really cared about as a writer. The happiness of the creative moment. It has always been mine.     TLDR; the original demo by Jermaine Dupri was a straight-up celebration of the party life, Varz switched up the instrumentation to add depth/make the song a little more in line with his own beliefs for the version on Alone II. I guess the evolution of the song would probably look something like:   Club/party song --> Cheeky subversive song --> Club/party song  I think what probably happened is that the song shifted more toward Dupri's original version during the recording sessions for Raditude. Rad was supposed to be a ""fun"" album (or something...), and the clubbed up version was more inline with that. Varz was definitely in a totally different mindset by the time the Raditude sessions rolled around. I really doubt that the Rad version is intended to be ironic or subversive."
weezer,32rsgn,megasnorkel,7,Thu Apr 16 07:04:11 2015 UTC,"Wow! So informative! Thanks.  I was wondering who this ""Varz"" persons is. But then I figured it's short for Riv""Varz"". Had no idea that was a nick name.  Anyway, I've noticed that his meditation (Vipassana) really helped him expand his mind. He's said that it helped him with stage fright and anxiety. It's cool that it helped him be more creative too, such in a case like this. I kinda want to try out meditation some time. I guess it was his LSD, or something."

weezer,32rsgn,DeathDieDeath,2,Thu Apr 16 16:33:03 2015 UTC,"It is meant to be a laid back song about partying. Rivers wrote it with a partying type of guy, but his name escapes me.

weezer,328u1v,Michaeljayfoxy,4,Sat Apr 11 18:52:46 2015 UTC,"IIRC, people had been polled on the lyrics, but they were written down rather than played. When this subreddit eventually heard the album version most people were disappointed in the change.  If that was the case, my personal theory is that My Mystery was originally supposed to be a much deeper, more personal song, along the lines of the Angel and the One, but Cuomo rewrote it to be an anthem instead so that it would fit in better with the Futurescope Trilogy."
weezer,328u1v,N0rmak,3,Sun Apr 12 00:10:54 2015 UTC,"Fans at the sessions where they played the two clips said that most people there seemed to prefer ""My Mystery."" They were played two clips (the section of the song from the teaser) and the only difference was the anonymous/my mystery line. A journalist who was played early versions of the album said that the song was originally ""Anonymous"" before being changed to ""My Mystery"" and then it was changed back. My guess is that Rivers decided to go with his gut and stuck with ""Anonymous"" in spite of the feedback. It might've suited his intended meaning of the song more, or he might've thought that it sounded better in the parts of the song that fans hadn't heard at that point. I haven't come across any mixes. It wouldn't be easy to make a good mix since the instruments sound different in the album and the clip, but the instrumental of the album version is out there which might be of some help if you wanted to give it a try."
weezer,31t98h,CySU,13,Wed Apr 8 00:00:29 2015 UTC,"I feel like weezer is at a perfect balance with their live shows now.   From 94 to 05ish Rivers has always been looking bored, standing awkwardly, absolutley no energy and we know it was because of his stage fright. I remember how people would say that they liked weezer, but were boring live.   After Rivers started meditating, he overcame his stage fright with the Red album, and their shows got kinda ...over the top. From 08-11ish River's stopped playing the guitar and instead would dance crazily, jump on trampolines, crack jokes and banter, interact with the audience etc. Although I thought that era was pretty fun, I can see how people would think its juvenile and unnecessary.   I saw them in 2010, 2011 and Rivers was really crazy. But then when I saw them in 2013 it was different. From 2012-now, Rivers is more relaxed, plays the guitar, and has enough energy to get the crowd going, less banter but theres still banter. Pretty much dropped the whole ""hyperactive on stage"" thing. I think its a perfect balance of the two different eras for River's. He's not too crazy but not too boring. Just right."

They opened with a short, acoustic set of the big songs, disappeared from the stage, and came back and played straight through the new album, with their usual setup.  So, fairly long show but I remember thinking it was so consistent! They didn't get sloppy or tired, the pace of the show didn't lag.  Such a great night.  Only bummer was some chick in front of me complaining that ""they didn't play the sweater song and [she] had even worn [her] sweater.""  Can't please 'em all.  Edit: sorry, I realized I went off on a topic you weren't really asking about. Saw them at Music Midtown '13 playing a set that covered tons of the more popular, older stuff (and a few that I'd only heard a couple of times, too) and it was also an amazing performance, despite the rain pouring down."

Anyways, that particular set up was for the EWBAITE tour but that same kind of energy has been the norm lately based on what I've personally seen or heard."

weezer,31t98h,eightbic,2,Wed Apr 22 16:17:34 2015 UTC,I saw Wilco is playing Friday and Weezer is Saturday - that's quite the lineup.  I may have to make the drive from Omaha.
weezer,31t98h,shmeckmo,2,Wed Apr 8 04:10:09 2015 UTC,"Ive seen them 7 times in my life, and I can say with confidence they are the most fun live band you can see. Check them out, you will not regret it. :)"
weezer,31t98h,littleold3chordme,2,Thu Apr 9 05:11:41 2015 UTC,I've seen them 8 times since 2008. The last time was in the summer of 2014. It was at Firefly Festival and it was the most out-of-hand concert that I've ever been to. They made that crowd theirs. So many crowd surfers and people singing along.
weezer,31t98h,UWbadgers16,1 point,Fri Apr 10 17:50:08 2015 UTC,"I saw the, in August 2014 and October 2014. The August show was a greatest hits and it was good, but nothing to write home about, the October show was the first of the EWBAITE shows and it was absolutely phenomenal. They were firing on all cylinders and really out some showmanship into it"
weezer,31t98h,Thmcdonald1,1 point,Wed Apr 8 02:02:28 2015 UTC,I saw them live recently and was completely underwhelmed. They played nothing off Pinkerton. They need to get over this because Pinkerton is their best album.
weezer,31t98h,GoTeamJosh,1 point,Sat Apr 11 13:22:34 2015 UTC,I saw them 5 times last year and every show was wonderful. Definitely recommended.
weezer,31t98h,fresnel-lens,1 point,Wed Apr 15 20:31:39 2015 UTC,"Because I live in Aus, I've only ever seen them play once live (Memories tour in Syd), and they were fucking awesome!  It was seriously the best concert I've ever been to."
weezer,31t98h,RJB6,0,Tue Apr 21 05:28:47 2015 UTC,"I saw them play their Blue album show in Brisbane and while the show itself was really cool, Rivers coming out before the show to kick around a soccer ball on stage really took some of the magic out of the whole concert experience."
weezer,31t2xp,ohdannyboy99,9,Tue Apr 7 23:12:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, and in the recent one about questions you should ask a doctor, Blue vs. Pinkerton was on the list haha.  Such a great site"
weezer,31rn40,el_sweeny,4,Tue Apr 7 17:04:46 2015 UTC,He's got a killer voice. Love it in thought I knew from red too
weezer,31rn40,gillogs,2,Tue Apr 7 22:32:54 2015 UTC,I really cannot get into Brian Bell's voice.
weezer,31rn40,frankypea,1 point,Thu Apr 9 05:17:03 2015 UTC,Great! I was never too into The Relationship stuff I heard a few years ago (including their version of Thought I Knew) but this is a huge track. Almost feels like they're re-launching themselves.

weezer,31k2ml,2Gex,27,Sun Apr 5 21:15:34 2015 UTC,"I want a Purple album, goddammit. Or an Orange one. Edit - or white...."
weezer,31k2ml,angelfromthecoast,16,Sun Apr 5 21:58:25 2015 UTC,"I always thought black or white would make more sense. I don't know if its coincidence, but to me, each color happens  to give off the vibe of the album. Blue is a relaxing mellow color, green is power poppy, and red is kind of rebellious and in your face, all matching each album's tone.  And if they continue in the direction EWBITE set up for them, the tone for their next album would likely be a more serious (but not that serious because its still Weezer) type of vibe, and black or white would suit that well.  However, Make Believe was kinda already the ""black album"" and if people started calling it the ""white album"" I hope The Beatles' one wouldn't be an issue."
weezer,31k2ml,neilxzagada,1 point,Sun Apr 5 22:12:12 2015 UTC,"Its gotta be Yellow. Then they can have a ""Primary Colours Trilogy"""
weezer,31k2ml,brianstorm33,9,Fri Apr 10 17:11:20 2015 UTC,"If it came out in 2015, there would be 7 years between each one."

weezer,31k2ml,kobun04,10,Mon Apr 6 00:47:14 2015 UTC,Except... Frontman Rivers Cuomo considers Death to False Metal to be Weezer's ninth studio album
weezer,31k2ml,autowikibot,4,Mon Apr 6 01:28:36 2015 UTC,"Death to False Metal:       Death to False Metal is a compilation album by the American alternative rock band Weezer, released on November 2, 2010 by Geffen Records. The album comprises several previously unreleased tracks from throughout Weezer's career, with vocalist and guitarist Rivers Cuomo stating ""Together, [these songs] are the album that should logically follow Hurley."" The album debuted at number 48 on the US Billboard 200.   The album was released simultaneously with the deluxe edition of the band's second studio album, Pinkerton. The title comes from a phrase that Cuomo and his younger brother used when they were children.

weezer,31k2ml,lilyisreallycool,1 point,Mon Apr 6 14:10:00 2015 UTC,Thank you! I guessed I skipped over it somehow when looing at the page :S
weezer,31k2ml,frankypea,3,Mon Apr 6 21:31:52 2015 UTC,Hurley was supposed to be a self titled album. So I'm gonna say no. That would be nice though.
weezer,31kvkn,kobun04,7,Mon Apr 6 01:24:53 2015 UTC,Love how prominent the bass is - that guitar tone is great too.
weezer,31kvkn,Tom_Anks,2,Mon Apr 6 09:16:31 2015 UTC,Yeah! I think the album version sounds like elevator music. There's no quiet vs loud dynamic.  I also like the four on the floor drum beat at the end on this live version.
weezer,31kvkn,Pizza_Saucy,6,Mon Apr 6 16:02:02 2015 UTC,One of my gripes about the Green album is that it plays a bit too safe for my tastes. The songs from Green always sound better live like when Pat does the guitar solo for Photograph!
weezer,31kvkn,theoccasional,3,Mon Apr 6 17:30:38 2015 UTC,They were doing a version circa 2002 that had a more dramatic/melodic guitar solo that was pretty rad as well
weezer,31kvkn,slappystick,3,Tue Apr 7 04:07:25 2015 UTC,Weezer songs usually age well. They always seem to be tinkering with them (usually for the better) even after the album has been released.
weezer,31kvkn,Red_menace56,1 point,Tue Apr 7 13:01:59 2015 UTC,That's cool. I've yet to see then in concert.  I wonder if they'll ever put out a live album.
weezer,31kvkn,Red_menace56,1 point,Tue Apr 7 18:03:38 2015 UTC,"They have a live album, check out The Lion and the Witch!"
weezer,31kvkn,angelfromthecoast,1 point,Wed May 6 16:34:22 2015 UTC,"Oh wait! The Japanese one, right? I saw that on vinyl at a record shop. This was before I was a fan. Is it a rare release? Maybe I should see if it's still there."
weezer,31kvkn,livinlaut,1 point,Thu May 7 00:45:30 2015 UTC,"I think it might be somewhat rare, I only have a cd copy. I've been thinking about getting into vinyl.  It's not a bad album"
weezer,31kvkn,youriqis20pointslow,2,Thu May 7 02:49:51 2015 UTC,"Nah, I love the album version as well as hearing it live."

weezer,31k5e0,mrfoeman,1 point,Sun Apr 5 23:01:33 2015 UTC,Yea blink sucks now. Toms voice is Shit and Mark gets tired. It sucks that I'll never see them in the 1999-2002 era.
weezer,31k5e0,my_worst_fear_is,1 point,Wed Apr 15 03:07:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah I saw them live a couple years ago and they sounded pretty shitty, but I recently saw them with Skiba and they actually sounded pretty great! He sounded more like Tom than Tom if that makes any sense."
weezer,31hfwo,Shadesta9,3,Sun Apr 5 02:49:15 2015 UTC,"I've always thought this. I mean, even for a concept record, the style and pacing of the songs were really weird because River's wrote it like a literal ""opera"" as opposed to just a ""rock opera"" which is why the lyrics are from different POVs and the songs are really short and kinda just flow into each other. The public definately would not of understood it at all, especially after the Blue Album. I feel like now because of the cult following, and how everyone already knows how weird of a band Weezer is, and how well EWBAITE turned out, they could totally rerecord and release an updated version of SFTBH on like an ep or something hahaha"
weezer,31hfwo,neilxzagada,4,Sun Apr 5 08:34:26 2015 UTC,"Re-records are, to me, the same as another band covering the songs. Songs have to be recorded as part of the same creative spark that inspired the lyrics and songwriting to be authentic. Do we really want to hear this dad pushing 45 singing about sexual frustration and a teen sex fantasy? If they could master the current recordings or somehow use the initial vocal takes, I'd be up for that but otherwise the demo recordings are just fine."
weezer,31hfwo,neilxzagada,1 point,Sun Apr 5 09:10:05 2015 UTC,"Thats true haha what was I thinking, when Bad Brains and Suicidal Tendencies re recorded their classic stuff it didn't really sound that authentic. And yeah the subject matter would be totally wack with River's right now. So yeah scratch that, maybe some more unreleased demoes for it instead? If they exist haha."
weezer,31hfwo,pinkerton_96,2,Sun Apr 5 10:11:59 2015 UTC,"Interesting, I never thought of that."

weezer,30xju6,JustSmileAndWaveBoys,3,Tue Mar 31 16:06:44 2015 UTC,"If you search Google for ""Weezer members"", it shows Rivers on drums and Patrick on guitar."
weezer,30xju6,teenagevictory,1 point,Tue Mar 31 16:20:21 2015 UTC,I think that Rivers did play the drums on some of the songs on The Red Album.
weezer,30xju6,pompeiisneaks,-4,Thu Apr 16 04:02:11 2015 UTC,I think this is in reference to the fact that for a while there they were swapping out a lot on the last few albums before EWBAITE.  I even saw a video with them covering someone else and Pat is playing guitar and someone I don't recognize is playing drums etc.  I think a lot of people were complaining that they should just go back to that old line up of Pat on drums and Rivers on Guitar so they did it and put it in the song too :)
weezer,31061l,eightbic,1 point,Wed Apr 1 02:17:35 2015 UTC,Yeah! There's great material after Pinkerton.
