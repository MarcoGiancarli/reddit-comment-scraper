On one side, it's cool to see older systems being restored and seeing some popularity again.  On the other hand, i'm worried about Gamestop swooping up every old system they can get their greedy hands on just so they can resell them for $50-$100 in a ""retro-vintage"" section when they roll this program out nation wide. What do they do with the machines that they cant get to work? Plus I can't imagine someone working there putting much love and care into a system when they pull it apart."

As a console gamer I wasn't exposed to too many fps' until the ps3, when pc ports really became common. I made many purchases I immediately regretted in that last gen. The orange box, bioshock, bordelands, dishonoured, CoD, far cry and many others would produce motion sickness within minutes. I now know to try before I buy ANY fps game. I'm glad that in recent years the mainstream appeal of videogames has forced some developers to look at the issue and address it. More and more I read discussions from devs about their game's field of view(FoV) and how they try to get it right or make it adjustable(though this is very rarely the case on console). TL;DR: the smaller the game's FoV, the more it will make me sick."

Newer FPS games aren't as bad, Doom 3 on Xbox wasn't too awful.   I hear those bracelets for sea sickness help this, but I haven't tried one. Personally, I've found playing in a well lit room with a fan blowing directly on me helps me last longer before I start feeling ill - like blowing to the point it makes me cold.  I also refuse to watch anyone else play a FPS. That's just asking for it, since you're not even controlling it. I'll even point my chair to the opposite wall so I don't accidentally watch.  Just thought I'd give my insight, I've had this problem my whole life.  TL;DR First person shooters suck, newer ones are a little better.

It doesn't have the anime graphics or level grinding or anything like that, it's closer to an action title in a lot of ways. The game is realistically stylized with a European feel and has an intriguing political plus sword and sorcery kind of story that feels very wRPG while playing like nothing else I've ever seen.   It's worth a look, even if you don't like jRPGs in general. I don't think there's another game like it in existence, it's such a weird, but excellent, hybrid kind of game."

retrogaming,3dz6x2,ChipOTron,4,Wed Jul 22 00:36:58 2015 UTC,"I bought a Sears Tele-Games Super Video Arcade from Goodwill about a year ago. It's a Sears-branded Intellivision that looks like this. It was untested but cheap enough to be worth tinkering with.   When I took it home I discovered that almost all of the switches and buttons stuck or wouldn't move, the underside (which I didn't think to check in the store) was covered in what looked like mold stains, and it was completely nonfunctional. When I opened it it had so much dust and hair on the board that it looked like someone had shaved a sheepdog inside of it.  I had to disassemble the console and controllers completely to clean them, but there was no rust on the board or damage to the electronics at all. The dust and hair came right off with compressed air and a toothbrush, the gunk that had the buttons sticking came off very easily, even the moldy spots were just patches of dirt that washed right off. In fact, I've had to spend a lot more time cleaning consoles that looked fine on the outside than I spent on this guy. It looks great now and works pretty well for a worn out, well-loved old machine.  Gaming machines are (typically) tough little computers and are made to last. I always encourage friends to take a chance on cheap, dirty stuff. While you can't save every console or game, most of them only need a little cleaning to work like new again.  EDIT: found some pictures. I didn't take pictures of the exterior funk pre-cleaning, but...  I took this picture about halfway through cleaning the inside, to remember his beautiful beard.    I took this one shortly before putting everything back together. As you can see, it's in great shape other than a tiny bit of rust on the (totally unnecessary) shielding. I may end up just removing the shields at some point, but they're fine for now.  This is the back half of a controller shell after a bath in soapy water and a scrub with a towel. The large dark gouges you see were all over the system and needed lots of attention with a toothbrush to remove. The gashes are all very shallow, the dirt was just really crammed in there over the last three decades.   Here he is back together."

I would have just returned it, but it wasn't very expensive and I was interested in seeing the insides of the infamously bad 5200 controllers. Long story short, I managed to cobble together two fully-functional controllers using bits from all four, plus some foil and glue... but it took all afternoon and I'm not sure I can say it was worth the effort!

At the time, I did not have the right security screwdriver so I just cleaned the contacts as best as I could with a q-tip and some rubbing alcohol.   A few months later, I purchased the needed security screwdriver and I opened up the cart to clean it further. I noticed that there was rust on the metal parts that hold the chips onto the board. I decided to soak the whole board in white wine vinegar for 24 hours to break apart the rust. After the 24 hours, I used an old toothbrush to remove nearly all of the rust. I let the board air out for a little bit and then I reassembled the cart. I then put it into my SNES and fired it up. To my amazement, the game worked when before I couldn't even get a flicker out of it.

retrogaming,3e03tz,CameronDemortez,2,Mon Jul 20 23:07:23 2015 UTC,"Open it up. Much to my chagrin, when I opened up my NES I noticed someone spilled soda on it some time ago. I don't know who, it wasn't me, but it was definitely during my ownership of it. It still worked fine with no issues, but after the cleaning it plays games immediately with no fidgeting anymore.  Those systems are very simply designed and can take a ton of abuse. You did everything right with the rice and whatnot, but now you have to open it up and clean it.  Try completely dismantling your NES. Take off all of the shielding and clean the board front and back with alcohol. Remove the pin connector and clean where it joins and clean your pin connector as well. If that doesn't work, buy a replacement connector. I doubt you really shorted anything. Despite what TV tells you, unless a device is powered on and pretty submerged in water, it can still function for a bit. I have my doubts that you did any real permanent damage to your NES. Just give it a thorough cleaning."

After 3 days, all the water (and salt, and ammonia) has already done the maximum amount of damage, and dried out the normal way. The only way it could be worse is if the thing was powered on when it happened. And since it presumably was plugged in, that's almost as bad.  Unless you peed only on the 72 pin connector, the entire thing is a write-off."

The player is tasked to attack factories which operate continuously building weapons that attack the player. The city is designed with an infrastruture that the player can see as it operates. Boats and various vehicles move between factories although I can't recall if blowing them up actually slowed the factories down at all.   Anyway that's notable because the cities in Bungeling Bay were essentially the prototypes for the city editor in SimCity. Will Wright worked on both games.

My brother in law took the box  home, and some days later, bought a Famicom on a local game store (according to Wikipedia, the ""Top-Loader"" HVC-101 was produced until 2003).

retrogaming,3duhc2,helswake,5,Sun Jul 19 18:04:55 2015 UTC,"The video converter box he's using is available for $53 on Amazon, as opposed to the $400 Framemeister. I personally think the marginal return in terms of picture quality on a framemeister over this guy's setup is not as high as some people make it out to be.  This is a great economy setup and even composite isn't that bad depending on your TV's built-in upscaler."
retrogaming,3duhc2,stoutcarrot,5,Sun Jul 19 21:11:00 2015 UTC,"The framemeister has other advantages though. Lag free (in the right modes), optional scanlines, and supreme compatibility. You can even plug a dreamcast VGA connection into it through the SCART RGB, if you wire it correctly.  In my experience (and reading), the $50 adaptors sometimes work great, and sometimes don't. They're a gamble."
retrogaming,3duhc2,JoshuaPearce,4,Sun Jul 19 22:07:28 2015 UTC,"I was recommending the video because it describes in depth with excellent examples of composite vs s-video vs RGB.   Framemeister aside, though it is an awesome piece of hardware, you don't need it for great looking RGB on your HDTV. It costs $300 now, still a hefty investment, but worth it if you're serious about your setup."
retrogaming,3duhc2,helswake,2,Sun Jul 19 22:46:12 2015 UTC,Any idea whether I would need a similar setup if I bought a RetroPi or does RetroPi/emulation produce great HD video quality anyway?
retrogaming,3duhc2,stoutcarrot,3,Mon Jul 20 00:00:14 2015 UTC,"You don't need it for a RetroPi/emulator because the emulator usually upscales the image. I prefer to play on original hardware, but I think the picture you get from an emulator is generally going to be much better. If you have a high end upscaler like the Framemeister you may get slightly better picture on original hardware vs emulation."
retrogaming,3duhc2,xanbo,2,Mon Jul 20 02:30:55 2015 UTC,"I play mame, nes, snes, n64, genesis, psx etc. via RetroPie on my RPi 2 model B. It outputs an HDMI signal that looks fantastic on HDTVs with very little lag, and if you want to use an old standard def TV you can send composite video out the 3.5mm headphone jack with a $5 cable you can buy on Amazon believe it or not. It's pretty easy to set up (relative to older versions of RetroPie that still required a lot of setup). I have literally thousands of games at my fingertips and I'm having a blast discovering old games I never played before as well as the classics I can't get enough of. I also love the ability to save my game at any time. RetroPie is by far my favorite way to play retro games, and I've tried a number of other setups over the years. Unless you're a purist who wants to play on original hardware, there's no better way to go. Join us at /r/retropie if you need any help."

retrogaming,3dwe1n,Manny_rat,2,Mon Jul 20 05:05:50 2015 UTC,"If you use that it will, yes.  Fusion will output the image with each pixel doubled, then the emotia cuts out every other pixel to make it 240 again.  The Extron RGB is used to shift the image down by exactly one pixel so the emotia cuts off the right lines, you can actually do this in most emulators though.  My image looks absolutely perfect using this setup from a PC to VGA to Component (well I'm actually using RGB on a Sony PVM but Component looks correct as well)"
retrogaming,3dwe1n,Funriz,2,Mon Jul 20 05:42:38 2015 UTC,Why not just use scart to rgb if you have a pvm? It's the best image/performance you can get and you are one if the lucky ones that can do it.

Get an old radeon card and there is a modification that allow it to output a YPbPr signal.

Those jacks double to take the SNES style RCA jacks, you just need to figure out which one of the 3 colors will be your yellow for video.  If they really did dump the entire setup just for HDMI on it, you're screwed most likely.  Maybe there's a coax cable?  You could run a Nintendo RF cable through that.

Many of them are very heavy and difficult to move and given their age they can be unreliable.  It's a niche that is probably too small to be profitable, but I think it would be cool if a retro crt was released specifically for retro gamers. If that existed and had lots of composite, component, VGA (dreamcast!), and even SCart ports I'd be all over it."

retrogaming,3dma2h,pop361,2,Fri Jul 17 14:18:26 2015 UTC,"Well... the verbs conjugation in portuguese are terribly difficult even to us, born speakers. Foreigners tend to mess up a lot with the verbal times. An example: ""Eles falaram"" (They spoke) / ""Eles falarão"" (They will speak).   Another source of confusion: in portuguese, as on spanish, we use genre-based articles. The masculine article is ""o"", and the feminine is ""a"". Example: ""O homem"" (the man) / ""A mulher"" (the woman). The genre articles are flexed when you are using plurals, so: ""Os homens"" (the men) / ""As mulheres"" (the women).  The funny thing: in portuguese, the inanimated objects are ""gender defined""! Well, ""beer"" (a cerveja) is a feminine substantive, ""milk"" (o leite) is a masculine thing. I live on the Parana state, at the south. We have a lot of germans here (I myself have german ascendents). German born speakers also have this genre dependant articles (der/die/das), but they tend to mess a lot with them, speaking funny things like ""A homem""."

retrogaming,3dqerh,mossi93,4,Sat Jul 18 13:07:26 2015 UTC,"I don't own a Mini, but from what I know, you need a special cable to hook up RGB Scart cables to the system. I know the mini comes with a cable, but it uses the Japanese version of scart. So for the cables I'm going to list, you're going to need a different adapter like this one  For the original NES, the best you're going to get is composite, unless you mod the console. So those are the red, white, and yellow cables.  If you're using a PAL super nintendo, get yourself one of these. The cost may seen a bit high from this seller, but the cables are all very high quality. I don't get my cables from any other seller, unless they don't sell them. Retrogamingcables.co.uk is also apparently good, but I've never bought anything from them. This will require the adapter.  For N64, the best you'll get is s-video. You can mod it, and then use a cable like the SNES. I actually just did a mod myself on my N64. I've never modded anything, and it was really easy. I just followed these instructions.  For Gamecube, the PAL version uses RGB. I don't know for sure, but I think the SNES Scart cable should work, but only if the Gamecube is PAL. If you can get an early NTSC model, you can get component cables (they are really expensive, but the Gamecube community has found a solution. Keep a lookout on badassconsoles.com).  So since you have component for the Wii, you want to hook it up to the Mini. You'll need one of these. There's a slot with some stereo inputs on the front of the mini, just hook that up and you can using component video with the mini.  I hope this helps."

retrogaming,3dqerh,MairusuPawa,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:40:25 2015 UTC,"Watch out, the XRGB doesn't use SCART but JP21 (which is not ""SCART"" because it does not follow the Syndicat des Constructeurs d'Appareils Radiorécepteurs et Téléviseurs guidelines, but is still RGB). Plugin SCART on JP21 hardware can potentially damage it, as one pin can send +12v for blanking (the other way around isn't a great idea either).  You can find a converter cable if you don't want to mod the XRGB (tedious); I've yet to see a compact one, though."

retrogaming,3ddyev,kappuru,2,Wed Jul 15 17:52:12 2015 UTC,I can't fault them. The only annoying one is the Super Everdrive because while it supports the common DSP1/2/3/4 chips - you can't run SuperFX based titles on it but it's entirely forthcoming about that. The SNES is a bit of a pain in general because of how common various enhancement chips inside the cartridge are. Load times are also a little slow for larger games when changing (re-playing the same game twice has no delay)  The ED64 you really need the newer v3 version or you have to keep pressing the reset button to save games which can be a pain in the ass. But it's probably the best of them all.

retrogaming,3dduzq,JimmyNaNa,5,Wed Jul 15 14:30:47 2015 UTC,I just replace the analog stick with one from a GameCube and it's good to go. Original and GameCube replacement analog stick can be bought for only a few dollars.

retrogaming,3dduzq,race_in,6,Wed Jul 15 14:40:38 2015 UTC,"whatever you do, don't get a 3rd party replacement stick, ""gamecube style"" or otherwise.  every single one of them has broken deadzones and inconsistent diagonals.  they are terribly designed and borderline fraudulent.  this also applies to nearly all 3rd party n64 controllers, with one exception.  it boggles my mind that people who frequently play n64 games would ever recommend them.  your best bet is to find a used 1st party controller in good condition.  they are not rare, and seldom cost over $40.  the original joysticks are fine and will last a long time if you avoid abusing them with Mario Party-esque gameplay.  some people use a method of lubrication to extend their life even further.  you could also opt for a hori mini pad, which are more expensive and not as good as the official controller for most games, but will last you a very long time, and are still quite a bit better than replacement joysticks."

retrogaming,3dduzq,speet01,3,Wed Jul 15 14:52:21 2015 UTC,It is really easy. I have modded 2 controllers like this. The gamecube stick is much better and doesn't wear out as fast as the original stick.
retrogaming,3dduzq,futtigue,2,Wed Jul 15 15:07:07 2015 UTC,"Honestly, a lot of those replacement sticks are going to feel very different from the originals, and not always in a good way. often these sticks can be finicky with a few games where you need to make your character walk as opposed to run. I actually have started repairing the original sticks after watching this tutorial. I've now done it twice with good results. either way, if you choose to replace your stick, be sure to save the original in case you run into the issues I was talking about before. In regards to 3rd party controllers, CIRKA and Tomee both are pretty shit but surprisingly, Yobo controllers are pretty good."

My cousin and I admittedly used a lot of continues but I don't apologize because that game is very hard.  Right now I'm working on practicing on Bayou Billy. This game is honestly top 10 hardest games imo. Not because of the difficulty of the game but because you get RIPPED by enemies very quickly. You have almost no post hit invincibility and just two hits costs you one life bar! I feel like it's such a great game with just one fatal flaw that makes me super frustrated.
