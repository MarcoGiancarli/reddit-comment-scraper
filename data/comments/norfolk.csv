norfolk,3e539s,spdaff,11,Wed Jul 22 00:49:51 2015 UTC,"So here is a rundown of most of the thrift stores in Virginia Beach with my color commentary:  JCOC Community Thrift on South Plaza Trail is a decent one. It's small but tends to get a lot of the higher end donations.  When it comes to Goodwills, the one on Rosemont tends to have a better selection than the one in Lynnhaven. General Booth is decent and so is the one on Princess Anne.  Family Thrift on Wesleyan Drive can be pricy but they have a good selection of pretty much anything. I got a working KitchenAid stand mixer from there for $65.  The Salvation Army on Virginia Beach Blvd is right over the Norfolk/Virginia Beach line and it is huge. It has a good selection of housewares, furniture, and clothes.  The DAV Thrift Store across the street from the Salvation Army is okay. It's cramped and always busy.  Second Chance Thrift is on Shore Drive and is another decent thrift store. Not a lot of furniture, but they tend to have a lot of glassware/homewares. Also you can bring your dog in!  The Salvation Army on Lynnhaven Parkway looks like a castle. It has decent selection of stuff, but sometimes feels bare in the housewares section.  Habitat for Humanity ReStores are very interesting in the fact that they have building supplies like bathtubs, stoves, windows, and doors and a little bit of the normal thrift store wares. The one on Holland Road is pretty decent. The one on Providence Road is very good. They often have sales. My boyfriend picked up a new in box Kwikset front door handle for 35 bucks.  CKHD Thrift Stores are really hit or miss and I don't bother with them anymore."

I have a small library of Go books, two small beginner Go boards (not a full 19 x 19 board), and a nice set of stones.  I'd be very interested in seeing a Go club or Meetup started in Norfolk. I'm already the organizer for two Meetups, otherwise I'd offer to do it myself. But the bottom line is, if you were to start something, I'd definitely be a part of it.  For those of you who are unfamiliar with Go, it's an Asian strategy game that's often compared and contrasted to chess. Each game has very different approaches to strategy, though. I have a book about the communist takeover of China in the '40s, and the premise of the book is that Mao Zedong was playing Go, while Chang Kai-shek (having been trained in the west) was playing chess.

norfolk,3dxvr8,flaxom,3,Mon Jul 20 20:19:30 2015 UTC,"That's not the reason the scaffolding is there. The developers were supposed to start construction on the building but are either lacking funding or code/permit approval to start the work.   If we can find a developer to fix the American Cigar Co. building, which is unarguably in much worse shape, I think it would more than easy enough to find a developer for a downtown building, especially during the downtown residential boom.  The city needs to ditch the deadbeat developer and find someone else that's willing to actually do the work.  It may not be a unique structure, but it is over a century old and is better than the cookie cutter midrise alternative that has popped up all over Downtown Norfolk and Town Center."
norfolk,3dxvr8,Diabeticus,3,Mon Jul 20 20:26:45 2015 UTC,"At the end of the day though, refitting a 100 year old building is only ever going to be a luxury endeavor. Yes it's nice to think of our city as historic, or to look at it like we're ""recycling"" structures and keeping classy architecture around, but this is such a wasted effort of time and money that it's becoming ridiculous. Not only has it been boarded up for a decade or whatever, but now it's become a staple eyesore and there's still no plan in place.  Think of it like this: you could restore a classy 1950s cadillac or you could buy an efficient modern vehicle. When money or time are factors, or when considering future use and longevity, it's an obvious choice. I just don't think we're a vintage cadillac kind of town, to be honest. We want to be, sure, but we need realistic residential options downtown and not $2000/m apartments. If that housing takes the form of a boring contemporary building, I'd prefer that over a boring ""historic"" building that cost twice as much to prepare and maintain.  Tear it down."
norfolk,3dxvr8,flaxom,2,Mon Jul 20 20:39:02 2015 UTC,"Like you said, the building hasn't been open in decades which means the majority of the inside isn't going to be able to be restored. The historic preservation society of Norfolk will most likely review the building and determine which elements need to be retained to ensure historic preservation. You can go to the Wainwright, The Governor's School, or Slover Library to see what that means in context. The contractor will do selective demolition and create a shell which will consist of structural items and the exterior.   They'll then completely modernize the building on the interior. There will be central AC, running water, toilets, electricity, etc. Basically they get a building exterior, that does need a bit of work to fix the main structural issue, and they get exterior architectural finishes that will probably never be made again. And they get to completely modernize the interior since I doubt much, if anything is left. You can see into the first floor of the building, and the interior is pretty bleak. They'll also receive historic tax credits for preserving a building.  So if we use your Cadillac analogy they'll basically be taking a Cadillac frame with some decent rust damage and putting a completely new car modern inside of the frame along with some steel plates where the rust occured. And the government will pay them to preserve the historic aspects of the car.   Whether you think we're a vintage kind of place is your own opinion, I enjoy the history our area still has and would personally like to see it preserved."

norfolk,3dxvr8,flaxom,2,Tue Jul 21 02:02:32 2015 UTC,I never said it was easy. Easy would be tearing down a historic building and putting up a generic culturally insignificant building that is going to look like a cliche style choice in 20 years when the modern style changes.Just like most people think buildings from the 70's and 80's look like crap they'll be saying the same thing about 10's architectural styles in twenty years.  Some developers are just too lazy to put forward any additional effort and would prefer to let the building crumble so the can build a new one that looks just like every other generic and sanitary Town Center.
norfolk,3dxvr8,Diabeticus,0,Tue Jul 21 02:31:32 2015 UTC,"So maybe by 2025 we'll have some more expensive apartments downtown. Can't wait, sounds like any day now, things have really picked up momentum once they stopped the building from falling over."

norfolk,3dn2m5,Ramblingmac,7,Fri Jul 17 17:32:31 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure the thoughts are going to be complicated since the Norfolk area is pretty diverse.  I know mine are.  I think the flag has morphed for a lot of people to be about Southern pride.  But its roots are firmly based in slavery and racism.  The majority of the Confederate states secceded due to slavery.  Point blank.  You can find transcripts of official notices of seccession and all had to due with preserving slavery or (worse IMO) wanting to keep the status quo of blacks doing all the undesirable labor and being the low class while whites remained dominant.  And any talk of states rights during the Civil War boils down to their right to own slaves.    The idea of being proud of your ancestors fighting against ""oppression"" breaks down for a few reasons.  I think there were two classes of Confederates who fought during the Civil War.  First, the ones who know what it was actually about (slavery).  There's no defense for them.  The second are people who did it to ""defend"" their homeland.  But those people were just being used by the upper class to protect slavery.  And the analogy could be stretched to other conflicts as well.  Were the rank and file Nazi soldiers right to fight against America during WWII?  Were the Afghanis after 9/11?  Or the Iraqis when we invaded?  They were all defending their homeland against an invading force, but they aren't thought of as heroes.  And there's also the fact that the Confederate flag only gained its modern meaning during the civil rights movement when states all over the South were putting it up over their state houses to thumb their noise at segregation being dismantled and to say that the Federal government wasn't going to force them to treat blacks as equal.  So while I agree that it now stands for Southern pride in the minds of a lot of people I think that is only due to people not knowing the history.  There are tons of other Southern symbols that could be used that aren't steeped in the oppression of a race."
norfolk,3dn2m5,Diabeticus,2,Fri Jul 17 21:33:45 2015 UTC,"Virginia's governor was pretty clear on his reasoning:  ""In reply to this communication, I have only to say that the militia of Virginia will not be furnished to the powers at Washington for any such use or purpose as they have in view. Your object is to subjugate the Southern States, and a requisition made upon me for such an object -- an object, in my judgment, not within the purview of the Constitution or the act of 1795 -- will not be complied with. You have chosen to inaugurate civil war, and having done so, we will meet it in a spirit as determined as the Administration has exhibited towards the South. Respectfully,  JOHN LETCHER.""  To blame the South as wholly evil in their cause is to suggest that the North was wholly right in using force to subjugate them. It's a great deal more nuanced than that.  The north had a noble goal (Maintain the union first, and end slavery second) and to accomplish it they ignored and broke core rules of our system of government. What's worse, history has judged them right in doing so, because they won and because they ultimately had goals we agree with.  Overall, the north's actions were wholly unconstitutional and the South legitimate in their grievances. Of course, on the flip side there's the inherent hypocrisy that the South was for self-determination except for anyone not a white land-owner.  In short - neither had the moral high ground, and that's something that shouldn't be overlooked.  Similarly, the battle flag is both a symbol of racism and a proud epitome of Virginia's, ""Don't Tread on Me"" heritage. Being forced to take it down is exactly why it flies.  For those reasons, the battleflag is a magnet for idiots. One side will never see anything but proud heritage, the other evil racism, and neither side is likely to have a decent knowledge behind it.  Fly the Stars and Bars instead. Hardly anyone recognizes it, and if they do, they probably know a thing or two about history.  edit Nevermind, right sub-thread!"

norfolk,3dn2m5,NotDescriptive,5,Fri Jul 17 18:40:24 2015 UTC,Just because the south seceded from the United States for various reasons and eventually lost the war. So it seems sort of ignorant (IMO) to fly two opposing flags side by side.

norfolk,3dn2m5,cantthinkofausernam,5,Fri Jul 17 19:17:56 2015 UTC,"While I understand the distinction between the types of flags, what does the aforementioned flag represent to you? The south, in a broad sense isn't necessarily a great representation of America. They represent 5 out of 10 worst K-12 programs, some of the highest poverty rates in the country as well as dealing with decades of blatant racism that has been so common that people barely discuss it anymore. I'm not saying there aren't great things about these states, I've lived and loved a few of them myself, but what about this flag or the perceived ""south"" is a matter of pride for these people? I don't wish to start an argument, I just want some intelligent opinions that can give some greater insight into perhaps something I'm not seeing."
norfolk,3dn2m5,Schneiderman,-1,Fri Jul 17 20:22:28 2015 UTC,"I can give you my opinion =)  States rights were the central reason for the war, in my opinion. This article shows a breakdown of Declarations of Causes from 4 states. Even though slavery does represent a majority, if you read the documents, they are arguing about the power of the federal government vs the power of the states. I believe that if it wasn't slavery, the war would have happened anyways. Look at the economic disparity between the south and the north at the time and revolution is about the only outcome for it.  To be proud of ones relatives for standing up for what they perceived was an injustice on their rights might be a good reason for someone to display this flag. Displaying it because you wish your grandaddy didn't have to free his slaves is stupid."

""Our new Government is founded upon exactly the opposite ideas; its foundations are laid, its cornerstone rests, upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery, subordination to the superior race, is his natural and normal condition.""  Edit: and a little more...   ""But not to be tedious in enumerating the numerous changes for the better, allow me to allude to one other -- though last, not least. The new constitution has put at rest, forever, all the agitating questions relating to our peculiar institution -- African slavery as it exists amongst us -- the proper status of the negro in our form of civilization.

norfolk,3dn2m5,_machinelf_,2,Sat Jul 18 11:04:33 2015 UTC,"I feel the same way about it as I feel about the swastika.  The swastika has been used by many cultures over the centuries to represent many different things, almost all of them with no negative connotation. (See Wikipedia article.)  But the fact is that since the early 20th century, the swastika has -- in the West -- come to represent Hitler and Nazi Germany and events related to the Holocaust.   Many brave and good Germans fought and died without necessarily supporting the Holocaust (or even knowing about it). And in fact, Nazi Germany could conceivably be lauded for it efforts to fight communism via its attack on Stalin's Russia.  But it would be inappropriate to fly the Nazi flag anywhere at this point. And in fact, it's restricted in a number of European countries.   It would be completely inappropriate and total horseshit to say, ""Well, we want to fly it to commemorate the heritage of all those good and brave Germans who fought and died fighting for something they believed in. All those good and brave German who fought and died fighting communism.""  Because although that certainly might have some truth to it, that's really not what Nazi Germany was about. And to the extent that groups do embrace the swastika, they often tend to be skinheads and other hate groups. In short, the negative associations with the swastika far outweigh any positive connotations.  Just so with the confederate battle flag.  It is undoubtedly true that -- from a legal point of view -- the confederate states had a right to secede from the Union. And it is undoubtedly true that many good and brave men died fighting for what they believed to be the cause of states rights.  But the fact is that, just like Nazi Germany, the confederacy rested on an absolute abomination: the notion that one group of humans was inherently inferior to another group and less deserving of the so-called inalienable rights...that their lives were worth less and that they could be treated as animals.  And just as the skinheads and their ilk have often adopted the swastika as their symbol, we too often see the confederate flag in company with white-hooded Klansmen and burning crosses.  To me the confederate flag -- like the swastika -- represents a black mark on human history. If it were up to me, it would not fly anywhere (nor would there be monuments to Robert E. Lee, Stonewall Jackson, and the rest of the confederate political and military leaders).  But it's not up to me, and I live with the fact that far too many of my fellow Americans seem to think there's something positive to say about it.   I do pay attention, however, when and where I see it displayed. And if it's on display at any kind of commercial enterprise -- gas station, for example -- I take my business elsewhere."

norfolk,3d9bqp,Tidewater_Southside,-3,Wed Jul 15 00:56:46 2015 UTC,I would say it's a symbol of rebellion.  The south rebelled against the union over many issue (slavery being one) and all Abraham Lincoln wanted to do was preserve the union (freeing the slaves was a bonus).  Also... HOLY FUCK!!! IT'S A FUCKING FLAG! I have yet to see that flag used in a racist manner in modern society(there probably has I have just not seen it).  It's like the national symbol for rednecks now.

norfolk,3csmcs,WhenItGotCold,0,Fri Jul 10 22:03:50 2015 UTC,"How is mass transit going to work? I don't think it really makes sense for this area...we are too large and spread out. It's not a large, centralized metropolis like NYC."
norfolk,3csmcs,evilrobert,2,Fri Jul 10 22:24:41 2015 UTC,"Because only in NYC one should ride mass transit for 20 miles (going from Yonkers-ish to Battery Park)?   Of course, I personally don't see the appeal of spending an hour plus sometimes driving your car 20 miles. Our issue here is there's so many people coming up with excuses as to why it shouldn't be done, that there's a gross lack of people who see that it's needed. The fact we're so ""spread out"" (even though it's 16 miles from the broceanfront to downtown Norfolk. 6 miles from Greenbrier to DTN. 9 from Chesapeake Square to DTN. 7 from Harborview. 12 from DTN Hampton. 21 from Patrick Henry in NN.) would only support it. Note, that all those distances are shorter than those of the reaches of NYC's mass transit trains (since that was pointed at).   This is a bunch of small town mentality being thrown about in an area that isn't small town at all. 1.7 million people living in Hampton Roads, and we think we're too good to give people alternatives to riding in cars, causing traffic, and blowing finances on gas."
norfolk,3csmcs,WhenItGotCold,0,Fri Jul 10 23:54:47 2015 UTC,"I've lived in a small town (LaRue Ohio) and drive from Norfolk to Hampton every day in the summer months. Don't imply I am out of touch.  My point was that our area does not have high enough concentrations of business nor residences for mass transit to be economical or otherwise feasible. If you compare the population density of NYC with Norfolk the numbers don't look so bad.   But factor in Virginia Beach, Chesapeake, Hampton, etc.. and the numbers don't look so promising anymore. In NYC, I can live in an apartment, walk a couple blocks to a subway station, ride to another station, get off, and walk a couple blocks to work.   People aren't going to be willing to get off at one of ten stops in Hampton and walk 2 miles to get to work from there. Let alone getting to the mass transit from a house to begin with. We simply don't have the same density that a big metropolis has.  And then look at the enormous risk (expense wise) of constructing a water crossing for mass transit across the James.   Mass transit might work from Virginia Beach to the base or ODU, or from ODU to downtown, or for other edge cases, but I don't think it will be feasible for a long time.  The fact is that gas isn't expensive and traffic sucks, and our governments are going to build another water crossing before they sink billions into a half ass mass transit system that won't benefit a large majority of area residents."
norfolk,3csmcs,EatMoreFiber,3,Sat Jul 11 00:36:17 2015 UTC,"It's not a question of if it's feasible for this area because we already have mass transit in the region: HRT runs buses, ferries and, yes, light rail. There's also trolleys at the Oceanfront but doubt that's HRT.  So the question is more about what's necessary and efficient to serve the population. And while I agree that expecting NYC or Chicago-level service of walking out your door and onto a train is unlikely, connecting population centers in meaningful, useful and dependable way (even if that means across multiple methods of transpiration) is something this area needs.   In DC, I don't mind using a bus to get to the train, or leaving a car in Park N Ride, or even walking 20 mins to a stop because am confident I won't be stranded at the end or delayed too much along the way. And right now riding HRT I don't feel confident at all.  Downtown Norfolk ORF/NFK International VB Town Center VB Oceanfront/Oceania Naval Station Norfolk Ocean View ODU/Ghent Greenbrier Great Bridge    Connect those by rail, with bus service to surrounding areas.

Incidentally, those are the same people who block light rail expansion to the oceanfront because it's going to ""bring in Norfolk's thugs"" (ignoring it also means we're going to get VB's undesirables coming into Norfolk, which doesn't seem to be that much of an issue).   That list right there, would be the ideal for the south side. There's another issue hindering it too. I know from people who were involved with the light rail on the engineering side, and they explained to me why the hours of operation are so useless to most people. Since the line only exists in Norfolk, Norfolk is bearing the brunt of the billing (contrary to the whining of every anti-rail advocate in VB). Norfolk refuses to pay overtime or hire more drivers to run the train late, which means if you're at a show at the NorVa, it's a deal breaker. Out doing something social downtown on the weekend? Better wrap it up by midnight or you can't take the train back. This is also a scam being operated by the agencies who are making coin on charging for parking garage use, because it chips into their profits when people start parking it and taking mass transit (which ties into the road contractors being against it, since it takes away their profits for doing substandard jobs that need constant repairs).   (Incidentally, I was never saying we needed near doorstop level of stops, WhenIt.. But making it functional for people to use doesn't mean it has to have a stop every half mile.)"

However, I don't believe it to be CO poisoning. The taste you're noticing are likely due to the air impurities, such as aerosolized dirt and dust caught in water vapor. It tastes nasty, but the fact that you can taste it means that's not going to be the cause of any CO concerns.   CO is an odorless, and therefore tasteless, gas. Symptoms of CO poisoning would be lightheadedness, feeling drowsy, slurred speech, and trouble concentrating on basic tasks (IIRC). It also takes time for symptoms to show, and you'll need industrial levels of CO to notice it in a few seconds. Cars just don't kick that much out, and for the most part, traffic moves fast enough even during rush hour, to where this generally isn't a concern."

I don't really get much turbulence in the cabin, but I imagine it's much better designed in that regard than a Jeep.  The Midtown tunnel is actually newer than the older of the two Downtown tubes.  It's likely worse in the Midtown because of the two-way traffic. When they removed the ceiling in one of the downtown tubes, they elected not to replace it because the ventilation space was no longer needed since the tunnel had since been changed to one-way traffic. Then they added those blowers in the ceiling anyway.  My guess is that two way traffic just stirs the nasty air, and one way traffic drafts it out of the tube to some extent."

Parking fee is like $10 bucks. There will be a good amount of people there on the weekend as it is the most popular hike in the state (but still a must do).  If you haven't come across it yet, www.hikingupward.com is a great resource for hiking in Virginia. There's a few hiking groups in the area that may be worth checking into. Not sure of their names but just look on www.meetup.com  Never been to Greenlife, but sounds like a homegrown sporting goods store. Blue Ridge Mountain Sports is the only other store in the area that I can think of that is similar (Besides the big chain stores).  Your home state is beautiful by the way. Did Mt. Mansfield and Mt.

While in VT last summer we also checked out Bingham Falls. Such a beautiful area.   There are some waterfalls in VA, but not huge ones. If you find yourself wanting to do some waterfall hikes, you can search hikingupward. If you click the map at the top left of the site it will bring up a full page map and a neat feature that allows you to adjust the sliders at the bottom of the page which filters the hikes based on what you want. You make make it show only the hikes with the best waterfalls/camping etc.   Also Great Falls on the VA/MD border is a great place to check out. Kinda like a mini Niagara Falls"

Durham is nice depending on where you live. They've redone the whole downtown area that it now attracts a bunch of 20 somethings. Raleigh is the same way, they're always building something new. You can easily work in Raleigh and live in Durham or their neighboring suburbs. Wake Forest is a nice suburb of Raleigh but a bit more expensive than Durham. My parents can drive up on a weekend and drive back and not be exhausted and the same for myself. Cons of that area: Distance to some things. I can't just up and go spend the week on the beach without thinking that I'd have to spend money for a hotel and food, but if you parents still stay in VB that might not be a worry for you. Gas was a bit higher than here in Virginia, but with VA taxes going up anyway they're about the same.   Cons about VB: The traffic. You've got people from different parts of the country who all drive their own way and it reflects seriously. The prices on food (there are two taxes on restaurants).   Pros about VB: Sushi and seafood are always fresh.   In the end, I'd definitely go back to the Raleigh/Durham area if I could. Jobs were easier to find there because of the developing tech market there."

The cornbread was great but service was slow and our entrees (fish sandwich, chicken & waffles) had issues - lots of bones in the fish, and seemed like they weren't prepared to serve the chicken & waffles - syrup came in three little cups, no butter provided, etc. Each issue wasn't enough to ruin the meal individually, but added together it made me less than eager to go back anytime soon."

There are plenty of way to show southern pride that don't involve a symbol that for many people represents slavery and racial oppression. I can't say many Jewish people or others that were killed because of their race or cultural beliefs would be thrilled to see swastikas flying.  I'm all for people's rights to express their own opinions, but I honestly think flying the confederate flag is in poor taste and there are plenty of ways to show southern pride.

Now people who are not part of your family, home, or culture are telling you it represents something offensive to them and so now you're the scum of the earth and we're going to twist your words to reinforce that belief, and do everything we can to make you appear backwards and stupid. Derp dey crashed dere trux!! those idjits lawl.   I have family in Mississippi and Alabama who are pretty proud that they live in the south but I've never seen a confederate flag raised to show it. Family visits always consisted of fishing, hunting, a deep fryer, beer, pecans, and fireworks. While this in anecdotal I think the lifestyle and food of the south is something that people should take pride in.  I can't imagine many people in the south being too ignorant to know that the confederate flag that everyone talks about didn't represent an army who's sole purpose was the continued oppression of other humans. I don't think it should serve as a symbol to represent a culture that is so much more than the Civil War."
norfolk,3bqyv9,yoda133113,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:10:27 2015 UTC,"the continued oppression of other humans   Can you show me any flag that doesn't represent this, for someone? Are you unaware of the countless atrocities committed in the name of the American flag?   I don't think it should serve as a symbol to represent a culture that is so much more than the Civil War.   And yet for the people who support it, that's exactly what it represents. Abandoning beliefs or values because their symbols have been co-opted is a pathetic, defeatist attitude. If the confederate flag truly represented slavery and the will to subjugate black people, that's what would be happening in this country and not fucking cookouts, shitty rusted trucks or fishing boats where the flag is actually used in reality.  I'll listen to the people who fly the flag when it comes to determining what that flag means, and not the people who stomp on that flag when it's politically safe to do so.  Some racist assholes use the flag, you say? What brand of trucks do they drive? I want to make sure I don't drive the KKK truck. How about rifles, or soda? Let's just give up things we share to the worst among us because we're cowards and it's easier to scatter and run than to stand up for your beliefs when you're in the minority. (Edit: Come to think of it, this concept is maybe what the flag actually represents to a lot of the people flying it. So trying to shame them into abandoning that flag is likely to have the opposite effect.)  I'll just be over here continuing to think everyone is an embarrassment. DAE Donald Trump sucks? omg beyonce rite yall."

Are you unaware of the countless atrocities committed in the name of the American flag?   Except that the US flag dates from 1776 to 2015. The confederate flag was used officially from 1861-1865. One flag represents a whole nation, the other represents a hand full of states that rebelled against the US government and only lasted 5 years whose sole purpose was the continued use of slavery. There is much more meaning behind one of those.   If the confederate flag truly represented slavery and the will to subjugate black people, that's what would be happening in this country and not fucking cookouts, shitty rusted trucks or fishing boats where the flag is actually used in reality.

Yes, the meaning of it has been debated in that time and various people have used it for various purposes. But you can't deny that the flag has existed much longer as a form of regional cultural alignment than as a battle flag for one army of one side of one war.

Its like telling mexican people they cant fly their flag in the US because we fought against them in 1840's.  And by the way, the Civil War was not ""over slavery"" it was over state's rights. The less populated south was being shafted by the north on almost every vote, including slavery I will not say slavery was not a factor. That is why the Confederacy is called the confederacy, it was a loose union of states. They formed a totally different type of government, people like to think they made a carbon copy of the US constitution, which is not true."

I saw something kind of similar I guess one day maybe 6 years ago. I used to ride my bike from the apartment I was in at ODU to my job downtown. I ended up staying pretty late one day at work because of some deadlines, it was probably around 8pm when I left to go home.  So I was riding up Hampton Blvd on my way home and had just gone down into that small underpass right after 21st when I saw someone in a grey hoody staring at me from the path on the other side of the underpass. The lights down there are terrible so I couldn't see his face and he was sitting on the ground so I initially assumed he was a bum, and still kind of do to this day. Anyways, I get past him a little bit but I still have that itching feeling like I'm being watched. I turned my head around to look and see if he was still staring at me but I didn't see him.  That definitely weirded me out a little bit, I swear I was looking at where he would have been. There are some pretty large concrete supports that might have blocked my view a bit so I finished riding through the underpass and then crossed over the street to get a better view of where he was at.  Nothing was there. Maybe he just got up and walked off but he would have had to do that pretty fast for me not to see him leaving."

However this is a completely different animal...this monument is in no way honoring slavery but instead the lives lost during the civil war. If someone feels something needs to be done to the monument erect a union solider monument as well.
norfolk,3aydly,Icutyourbrakes,4,Wed Jun 24 15:11:32 2015 UTC,"There are actually, not one, but TWO historic Union sites just down the street!  They are less prominent, but they exist.    The Pass House  -  Where Union authorities demanded that Portsmouth residents pledge oaths of allegiance to the Union, and where passes to visit nearby Norfolk and Suffolk were issued.  The Peters House (315 Court St) - was headquarters for Union Gen. Benjamin ""Beast"" Butler.  You can also see Trinity Church from the Confederate Monument, which is the final resting place for many Quasi, Revolutionary War and War of 1812 casualties.  The North Wall of the church was actually built using granite from a wall raised by Benedict Arnold!  Point being, its history.  Slavery happened.  Wars happened.  We can't just scrub it away and pretend it never occured."

Its not a confederate flag just to shove it in someones face, its for those who lost their lives under that flag."

However. Taking down a monument to confederate dead is the same as trying to erase history. It's a WAR MEMORIAL not a slavery memorial. You can't erase the history. You can't erase the dead.

This area is littered with similar memorials and markers to war casualties, although the particular conflicts differ.  Here's a little further reading on the history of the monument itself:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_Monument_(Portsmouth,_Virginia)"
norfolk,3aydly,cruceno,1 point,Thu Jun 25 06:28:54 2015 UTC,"Confederate Monument (Portsmouth, Virginia):       The Confederate Monument in Portsmouth, Virginia, also known as 124-183, was built in 1876. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) in 1997.   The monument is a 35 foot obelisk of North Carolina granite. It is located at the town square of Portsmouth, at the corner of High and Court Streets. Also facing on the town square are the Trinity Episcopal Church dating from 1828 and the Portsmouth Courthouse dating from 1846, which are both also NRHP-listed.    It was erected by the Ladies Memorial Aid Association of Portsmouth, Virginia, which was founded in 1886 with one purpose ""being the erection of a monument to the Confederate dead of Portsmouth and Norfolk County."" The design was by Charles E. Cassell, ""an ex-Confederate topographical engineer"".  :8  The cornerstone was laid in 1876. Within the cornerstone several artifacts were placed, including:   a Confederate flag Confederate bonds, currency, and postage stamps a payroll and other lists of officers and men in a company and an artillery battery a photograph of the late Col. James G. Hodges, commander of the Fourteenth Virginia Infantry, and ""silver currency of various nationalities"".   The monument's capstone was not placed until 1881, and the monument as a whole was not completed until 1893.  :9–10  The city of Portsmouth ""gave 1,242 men to the Confedercay of whom 199 were killed or died; Norfolk County gave 1,018 men to the cause of whom 280 were killed or died; and the City of Norfolk gave 1,119 of whom 176 were killed or died.""  :10    Image i     Relevant: List of monuments and memorials of the Confederate States of America | National Register of Historic Places listings in Portsmouth, Virginia | Confederate States of America | Archibald C.

norfolk,3az486,Qtip533,10,Wed Jun 24 17:41:16 2015 UTC,"Welcome to the area!  You'll find that pretty much all crime is opportunistic in Norfolk. Lock your doors (both apartment and car), don't leave high value items visible from windows, don't leave empty boxes for high value items near the trash can (tear them up), don't run into stores and leave your car unlocked or running no matter how quick the visit, don't walk around alone at night until you're familiar with the area. Basically just don't make yourself a target. Some areas like downtown and Ghent are perfectly safe at night whereas some areas around ODU are not.  Both my wife and myself went to ODU and had a good time there. There is plenty to do around campus and within a short distance. I've lived in Norfolk near the ODU campus and many other places so when you are looking at places feel free to PM me an address and I can tell you whether or not its worth looking into. Here is Norfolk's crime map , you can use that to help with decisions on where to live. Let me know if you're up for a beer once you're in town and I'd be glad to introduce you to the area."
norfolk,3az486,Diabeticus,2,Wed Jun 24 18:24:58 2015 UTC,"Ditto on what @Diabeticus said. I've lived in almost every part of Norfolk (next to ODU in a semi-fancy neighborhood called Larchmont), in West Ghent (also very close to ODU), in Colonial Place (a more family oriented neighborhood within biking/walking distance of ODU), and I've lived in Norview near the airport.  Never had any serious issues but yes, you do need to lock your car. Other than that, normal cautionary measures are a good idea, but often not necessary. (Don't let your girlfriend walk or run alone at night with earphones on, stay alert.) but, frankly, in Ghent you could probably walk naked down the street and nobody would notice or care, or bother you.  Good luck."

There is absolutely no sense in putting the pedal to the metal and urging that last half-mile to slam on your brakes at the end of the line waiting to go through the Midtown Tunnel.

It's an amazing local park, and a straight shot from downtown Norfolk. The carnival is still there for a teeny while longer (it's pretty much our version of a county fair), but of course after you pay for the games and the rides it adds up financially. And if you wanna stay cool we have some amazing museums here in Hampton Roads. There's a Children's Museum in Portsmouth, and of course our VA Marine Science Museum//Aquarium at the oceanfront. And for Norfolk in particular we have the Nauticus museum! It's a Naval Museum that's fun for the whole family. Everyone from the 10 year old, to yourself, and even grandma and grandpa would have a fun time. Trust me, I know nothing about the Navy and even I found it to be very interesting- especially the tour of the Naval Ship USS Wisconsin. And if I'm correct they have special children's pricing. Lastly, although it's not as popular as the Boardwalk we do have Oceanview! I've never had a problem or a bad time there. It's free, and so is the parking. And if you all choose to eat supper over that way (particularly seafood) the prices aren't as inflated as they are one city over in the super touristy area. They even have one of those neat giant blow up slides there, and it's conveniently located near one of the free parking areas. I'm not sure if the prices have changed from last year, but to use it then was $3 (there's also all day pricing, as well)."

I see guys doing car washes in a parking lot near where I live just using the same rags and water all day, the cars might get ""clean"" but they are definitely damaging the finish.   I've been considering starting a paint correction and detailing service as a side job, I figure that just to make it worth my time and factoring in expenses I would need to charge at least $50 for a basic exterior wash and wax on a normal size car. And I mean, that's the bare minimum, anything less and I might as well apply at McDonald's.

Ghent village is nice. I have never had issues with people hanging around out front. And the parking lot/community has a gate that goes all the way around it. The only issue I see with it is that it is very close to the edge of Ghent along Granby/Monticello and close to the seedy neighborhoods. Pelham apartments at 521 Boissevain are a nicer location IMO but overall aren't as nice. Sometimes the people standing out in the courtyard there are kinda sketchy. I am not sure if they live there or are just hanging out. I have never felt unsafe at either locations though, I just mean like homeless people or somewhat mentally unstable people.

Be aware of your surroundings. I haven't had any problems in Ghent but I did have problems when I was going to ODU. Accidentally left an iPod in a car overnight and the window was smashed out and it was taken. They search through car windows every single night. I also had my house broken into when all of my roommates and I were gone for Christmas break. Someone sat on my front porch and got a window open and then sat there and unscrewed the bars that were made to keep them out. So that sucked. Walking around at night can be sketchy. A general rule of thumb is the higher the street numbers go, the safer it gets. Their is a shitty neighborhood between Ghent and ODU called Park Place. If you look at a map, the hood starts at the train tracks by 22nd street and goes to around 38th street. So the farther away from there you are the better. You shouldn't have any issues in Ghent though. Pelham apartments are far enough away from all that riff raff. Mostly just keep your shit locked up and watch your back."

The text isn't at its face obscene or vulgar and is a great starting off point for conversations about what damage intolerance and poor reading comprehension can cause. Most of the people I know who are religious are embarrassed by this sort of thing - perhaps it will encourage reflection on what associations people make and what their values really are.

norfolk,3aa7qz,SupineAfternoons,6,Thu Jun 18 13:31:11 2015 UTC,"Hey there. Lots of info to be had in a quick search of the subreddit.   This area will definitely be a change of pace coming from NYC. Rule #1 of living here is to make your commute as short as possible and avoid having to cross water on the way. Public transportation isn't really an option here and we've got bad drivers and plenty of chokepoints.  The most urban areas here are the downtown/Freemason and Ghent areas of Norfolk. Ocean View is near the base and provides easy access to the beach but has a reputation of being a bit seedy.  This crime map tool can help you get a sense of good vs bad areas, although when you're in one type you're still never too far from the other."

norfolk,3aa7qz,taiji_lou,6,Thu Jun 18 23:21:06 2015 UTC,"Since your husband is going to be stationed at NOB I would try and stay on the south side when you look for a place to live. The south side consists of Suffolk, VA Beach, Norfolk, Portsmouth, Chesapeake. IF you're looking for something more urban I would check out Norfolk or even the downtown portions of Portsmouth. If you like beaches, VA Beach and Ocean View are good places to check out. If you're into suburbs you can find a lot of those throughout all of the southside but primarily VA Beach, Suffolk, and Chesapeake. If you have kids Chesapeake and VA Beach have great school. If you're a big foodie Norfolk has the best restaurant scene in the area (imo anyways).  If you're interested in any areas of Norfolk let me know and I can give you a run down on the general area. While the crime map may seem bad, Norfolk is a great place to live with a lot of ways to keep an active lifestyle."
norfolk,3aa7qz,Diabeticus,4,Thu Jun 18 14:47:28 2015 UTC,"The neighborhood around the base is sketchy.  Bayview, parts of Ocean View, and Ghent are the best places to live.

A lot of Navy end up living there because it costs about as much to live in Virginia Beach as anywhere else in hampton roads, but there isn't quiiiite as much crime."
norfolk,3aa7qz,taiji_lou,4,Thu Jun 18 15:02:24 2015 UTC,"Colonial Place, Lafayette, Larchmont, Chelsea, Downtown, and quite a few other neighborhoods are also pretty nice places to live but I agree about definitely staying away from the areas directly around the base. The houses are a little run down due to a lot of renters being out to sea occasionally and the rents are inflated due to convenience to the base and housing allowance for military."

Just get off on mercury, head south, and make a right on s mallory st and get on 64 from there. Thats what all the cool kids do."
norfolk,3a3zam,banzaiburrito,2,Wed Jun 17 04:13:36 2015 UTC,"Ok, I work in NN and live in VB.  The commute sucks, it is not as bad as the other direction, but it still has issues.   The morning is ok, but the afternoon sucks.  I try and get to work by 6 am everyday just so I can leave by 3.  And sometimes I still get stuck in at least a 10-15 min backup heading up to the HRBT.  If there is already traffic I take the Monitor-Merimac, but that really isn't an option unless you don't mine paying a toll.  Somedays they like to close the tunnel for like 15 minutes and if its close enough to rushhour, the tunnel never really recovers and you'll have a backup all the way to the 664-64 interchange.  And sometimes both tunnels get backed up so a 35 min commute turns into 75 min plus.  tldr: if you work in NN, live in NN, its cheaper and not worth the commute"

Restaurants:   Best local restaurants thread  I would suggest making Handsome Biscuit and The Ten Top priorities but there's a ton of amazing food in our area. Bay Local Eatery, Citrus, Shorebreak, The Back Deck, Chick's Oyster Bar, HK on the Bay, CP Shucker's... all those are just down the road from your camp site and are pretty well regarded, let alone all the options at the Oceanfront or in Norfolk."

norfolk,39d8nk,Diabeticus,2,Wed Jun 10 23:59:31 2015 UTC,Definitely a cool idea but as other comments make clear still very much pie-in-the-sky without a lot of work in the meantime.  What would be really cool IMO would be to have it in the VB Oceanfront area. Probably too much of a grid pattern to the roads (among the millions of other reasons why it wouldn't work) but the thought of seeing these cars blast down a straightaway on Atlantic Ave (or even the boardwalk itself?) is exciting to me.
norfolk,39d8nk,EatMoreFiber,2,Thu Jun 11 12:24:36 2015 UTC,I mean the circuit that /u/gramcraka92 posted isn't bad. I would just remove 2 and 3 and instead go up Tidewater to Brambleton and then back down Boush St. I think a route similar to that route would cut out some of the really odd turns and give plenty of straight away. I think the views of Towne Point Park would be great plus all the midrise and highrise buildings would have some decent views of the track. Traffic would still be meh but at least it can be somewhat alleviated by taking the Ferry from P-Town or the Tide/Bus.   Oceanfront would be a gorgeous route no doubt (good views from the hotels too) but all I can think about are the traffic issues going to/from the race. I can't see 264 and Shore drive being enough to relieve congestion.
norfolk,39d8nk,EatMoreFiber,3,Thu Jun 11 12:33:30 2015 UTC,Wouldn't traffic into and out of downtown be just as bad? I would assume most of the tourists in town for the race in VB would be staying at hotels in the Oceanfront area.
norfolk,39d8nk,EatMoreFiber,1 point,Thu Jun 11 12:55:34 2015 UTC,"Well you have people going down 264E, 264W and Brambletone from downtown Norfolk versus just 264 W and Shore Dr (maybe I'm missing a exit road?). And the public transit out of Norfolk is a little better with the Tide/Bus and Portsmouth Ferry versus just the buses.  There are hotels in Downtown Norfolk though I doubt they could support crowds as well as the VB oceanfront ones. I don't know what percentage of people would be tourists or just interested locals.   The article states that the B-More race had 150k people which could easily be mostly locals who won't be using hotels.  All in all both locations would probably do well."
norfolk,39d8nk,No-Coast-Punk,1 point,Thu Jun 11 13:21:11 2015 UTC,"(maybe I'm missing a exit road?)   I'd add VB Blvd/Birdneck and General Booth to Dam Neck as viable corridors for such a large special event, but we're splitting hairs - congestion out of both VB and downtown Norfolk on normal days are pretty awful... an Indy race would be ungodly without major steps being taken.   the B-More race had 150k people which could easily be mostly locals   Can't say I agree with you there. My only experience in an IndyCar town was living in Indianapolis (which obviously isn't a typical race), but flights, rental cars & hotels there were booked solid for the week before and after the 500.   Same for Detroit when they hosted their F1 Grand Prix downtown, although F1 again may not be a fair 1:1 comparison."

The way the VA SI laws are written if it is not original equipment, it does not comply with VA law. It also leaves a grey area for the inspecting agent to determine if the aftermarket exhaust system is compliant in design and operation.  Car enthusiast don't like the way it leaves this loop hole due to experiences just like yours.  READ AND UNDERSTAND THE LAW  § 46.2-1049  No person shall drive and no owner of a vehicle shall permit or allow the operation of any such vehicle on a highway unless it is equipped with an exhaust system in good working order and in constant operation to prevent excessive or unusual levels of noise; provided however, that for motor vehicles, such exhaust system shall be of a type installed as standard factory equipment, or comparable to that designed for use on the particular vehicle as standard factory equipment. An exhaust system shall not be deemed to prevent excessive or unusual noise if it permits the escape of noise in excess of that permitted by the standard factory equipment exhaust system of private passenger motor vehicles or trucks of standard make.   Perhaps their technicians need to take a look at the Subaru Impreza sitting in the parking lot driven by one of their techs. It clearly has a modified exhaust system too.   Perk of the job. You seriously think a SI is going to fail their or their coworkers vehicle?  So no they didn't shaft you over that. The Oil stuff sounds shitty enough to not return though."

Rotaries have substantially higher exhaust temps than normal cars. Plenty of melted stock cats out there from track days). Granted, the aftermarket stuff is a larger diameter, but still works as intended.  The feds require a check engine light to be set if any emissions parameters are beyond 10% of design.  There is no CEL, or pending codes, and all drive cycle monitors have passed. In my eyes, this stuff is a compatible design to factory. Stock mufflers means it's exactly as loud as factory.  If I had received a call first, it would be one thing. Instead I showed up with my old (but current) inspection sticker scraped off, and a demand for $748 to pass my car.  This just makes them opportunistic dickbags, as well as incompetent."

That being said, I took my car (lowered with 3"" turboback) to the location on Monticello for inspection and the manager was very cool and I was out of there quickly. They don't even do emissions inspections down here so I'm not sure why they made a fuss about the exhaust, is that supposed to be part of safety too?"
norfolk,38tx4r,soapsuds43,1 point,Sun Jun 7 03:00:33 2015 UTC,"The factory mufflers are in place. The car has a header and a metallic cat   This does not matter. Any vehicle subjected to VA law must retain original equipment BY LAW. This can be nit picked down to minor items such as replacing the tie-rods with Moog brand instead of Mazda.   The feds   Vehicle inspection is state law, emission regs are federal territory. You are correct to say a CEL will fail a vehicle.   Instead I showed up with my old (but current) inspection sticker scraped off   It is REQUIRED by VA law to remove the sticker before they even  begin inspection. Now if you went there and said something along the lines of, ""i'd like my vehicle inspected to determine if it will pass a state inspection."" Then there would have been no requirement to remove the sticker.  You modify your vehicle; you take the risk of failure. I'm no stranger to this - I own a highly modified Nissan car and lightly modified truck, but due to having a friend i consider my brother who is a SI my inspection stickers usually arrive outside of a shop for free."

On a train in Chicago this week I spoke with a woman who lives in the Phoenix area who said that region is having the same issue: a ""nicer"" suburb is resisting expansion of the citywide rail system for fears of allowing homeless and other unwanted populations easy access to their ""elite"" area.

When the Norwegian Tall Ship Christian Radich came for its first visit to the Norfolk area, which at the time was a waterfront community that had no city-owned property on which to dock a ship, the ship was forced to dock three blocks from Town Point. In less than two days, 13,000 people crossed her gangway leaving city planners and leaders with a new goal to create accommodations for more ships to visit as well as a waterfront public park.

Comparing costs/benefit for him though is like doing the same for a family member, you kind of just can't.  He was a rescue from the Heritage Humane Society in Williamsburg, he was born in there. It's easier to find puppies if you go outside of Norfolk/VB into the smaller cities and towns in the area, and please do support a rescue operation if you're able to.

I was just looking at some of their listings here and I'm about to have a breakdown, they really do a good job of caring for the animals so they're in good mental condition when you adopt. That's so important, and something you'll have a hard time finding at a PetCo in VB or some crap. It's worth every penny not just to adopt a best friend, but to support the work they do for those animals.  They aren't the only shelter in the area that's worth your business though, maybe try searching around in google maps for pet adoption and see what's within an hour's drive. Read reviews. Plan to drive out one day and meet some of their dogs, the staff are likely to be really helpful in finding a good match for you."

If you buy tickets early enough they're like 12 bucks and I haven't had a bad experience. I mean it's not fun, but it's cheap, reliable, and depending on where you're going, can be reasonably quick.  I've actually met several really interesting people on my travels! I've never felt threatened at all, but I'm a big dude with a shaved head a facial hair so that may have something to do with it...  I've taken the bus to NOVA and back probably 10 or 12 times by now and I've only had trouble getting a seat once.  And that was on a midnight bus out of Richmond oddly enough.  Bottom line, I like it.  Megabus is another option but their station is all the way up in Hampton so you have to take the 961 up there to catch it."
norfolk,384uu0,sabianaax99,2,Tue Jun 2 02:09:04 2015 UTC,What's the boarding process like?  Are people usually lined up ahead of time to get on the buses?  I'm only staying in DC for two nights so i'm just bringing two outfits and some general hygiene stuff..  it'll all fit in a backpack that I hope I can just carry on the bus with me instead of having to check it in and out.
norfolk,384uu0,_bugz,1 point,Tue Jun 2 02:40:16 2015 UTC,"I definitely recommend packing as light as you can so you don't have to check a bag under the bus (they can be rough with your stuff).  Your ticket will have a boarding number which is supposed to be your place in line (which nobody respects).  All you'll do is go into a line designated as ""1-10"" or ""11-20"" etc. based on your boarding number (and again, people are in the wrong lines all the time, for some reason the whole concept is hard to understand) around 20 minutes or so before you are scheduled to depart. So just be sure to ask whoever is at the ticket counter which gate you are leaving out of if it doesn't say on your ticket and be aware of announcements and when others start to line up and you'll be fine.  Don't be afraid to ask the ticket taker (who is usually the driver) or others in line to confirm you're getting on the right bus if you ever feel unsure.  Happy travels bud! I'll be driving up to the DC area the same day so we may pass each other along the way!"

For some reason family events tend to bring in the riff raff and it's unlikely it's coming from the rich old people on the ocean front.

There are plenty of criminal all over Hampton Roads. Most crime is opportunistic in nature, criminals don't go out of their way to travel to other areas to commit crimes.

Not saying that bums are the ones going to carnivals shooting at people, but mount trashmore isn't exactly oceanfront now is it? It's close enough to Norfolk and Portsmouth for people to travel and carnivals bring all sorts of different people. I'm neither right or wrong about the crimes in the area being mostly from those who reside in Norfolk or Portsmouth but those who live in low class areas have a much higher crime rate than those who live in a high class area.

Nor is your comment valid about the crime in VB being from upstanding citizens. Unless you believe that upstanding citizens are those with lengthy criminal records.

norfolk,37z9a1,EatMoreFiber,1 point,Sun May 31 21:37:33 2015 UTC,"Hey! This is my idea so I appreciate the question. I feel like there's still so much waste going on in our region, that we could use 20 more stores to try to capture and promote architectural salvage and materials reuse. I support their mission and want to bolster what they're doing not competing. So I have to try to figure that out with their help. I've reached out to a couple of folks and will continue to do so.  I do want to make the store different, but not more fancy. Just useful in different ways; a place that fills demand for materials, unique or eclectic items that people can use for their own projects. Whether that's renovations, art or something else.   We're also going to be a place for artists and craftspeople to sell the work they create using reclaimed, salvaged and repurposed materials as well as services they offer.  It's hard to address many of the underlying issues in a couple of paragraphs and I didn't want to ramble. But I'd like to hear what you have to think about what I've laid out. Thanks, -George"

Potentially competing with non-profit organizations like Habitat is an important issue that I wanted to be sure you knew I took to heart. And I can't make this the community resource I want it to be without honest (and hopefully constructive) feedback.  The NEON Arts District is going to be an amazing place (already kind of is!!). That's due to the hard work of people more talented than me. But I do think I can contribute and hopefully I'll get that chance. -George"

According to the website it includes:   Our Waterfront VIP area is located along the edge of the Elizabeth River in Town Point Park and directly alongside the Main Stage. This exclusive destination features enhanced views of the main stage, a large hospitality tent with complimentary beverages, food and snacks, stand up tables, limited seating, an air-conditioned restroom trailer, and more. Ticket options include single day admission as well as weekend passes. Ticket and proof of identification is required. Alcohol is consumption is restricted to guests 21+ with proper identification.   The festival has music and food. A bunch of ships from around the country visit. This year they're having mermaids, shows, the worlds largest potato, fireworks, beer and wine tasting, flyboarding demonstration, and a bunch of other stuff. It's going to be really fun.

norfolk,37wntz,time2getout,3,Sun May 31 00:46:07 2015 UTC,I personally like cox. Never had their TV service just Internet. They've been pretty reliable. Also if you remember the Netflix throttling and the whole net neutrality issue cox was never an issue as far as throttling went. There was some chart posted a while ago showing no discrimination to Netflix when just about every other isp did. That made me very happy with them.

All other video sites streamed A-Ok and torrents were running around 6Mb/sec.  Switched back to Cox and am even happier with them for not throttling content providers.  Currently getting 66mb down on their 2nd cheapest plan."
norfolk,37wntz,Riash,1 point,Sun May 31 04:54:50 2015 UTC,"I moved to a place that has FIOS and I picked it up. Been very happy with FIOS for the 4 years I've had it. Having 50/50 kicks ass, and makes backups to the cloud much easier. 50/50 for FIOS actually means 70/70. They give you much more bandwidth than you pay for. Customer service isn't as good as Cox in my opinion, but I can count the number of times I've had to call FIOS in four years on one hand.  Before that I had Cox, and to be honest they weren't bad at all. Their upload speed sucked though. Customer service was average. I had better customer service with a small cable company down south a decade ago. The downside being Cox service was less reliable, with my internet crapping out an average of every 3 months. I ended up calling them so often I learned a trick, tell them my TV service was down instead of my internet and I'd get faster service from a tech.  My parents have Charter and seem happy with it, they seem to have few problems despite living in the boonies.  My sister and her family came to visit a couple weeks ago. Tney rented a house that had satellite internet. It was unusable from 8am until midnight. They came to my place to use internet.  In conclusion, cox/charter aren't bad compared to some. If you have the option of FIOS definitely check it out."

norfolk,37vkg7,Embarrassinghuman,2,Sat May 30 20:19:52 2015 UTC,Do NOT go with Sprint. They are the worst carrier I have ever experienced.
norfolk,37vkg7,dontblink123,1 point,Sun May 31 17:38:30 2015 UTC,"Verizon is the best and most expensive, then Sprint, followed by AT&T, and finally T-Mobile. Verizon's network is also sometimes overcrowded in certain areas so while you'll have service you'll be beaten in speed by Sprint and T-Mobile. Sprint historically has not had the greatest service but recently they have been making large infrastructure investments. I dont have much experience with AT&T in this area so I can't say how their service is.  T-Mobile is by far the spottiest, especially in more rural and even suburban areas, but generally in any city will be as good or better than Verizon or Sprint. My suggestion is to look at the coverage maps for each and figure out where you'll be spending most of your time. Personally I have T-Mobile and I get great signal and speeds most of the time, but there are areas with pretty poor coverage I just deal with; a fair price to pay for $30/mo unlimited data."
norfolk,37vkg7,tyzbit,1 point,Sat May 30 22:15:31 2015 UTC,Thanks for the thorough response! What I didn't mention in the post was that my wife will be staying in NYC and we will both be driving between the two regularly. T-Mobile had literally no service through most of Delaware (I took 13 and 113 just to check) so I have to switch.
norfolk,37vkg7,NewNavySpouse,1 point,Sun May 31 02:43:33 2015 UTC,I also have at&t because my husband and I are from central illinios and at&t is the best coverage there and we will visit soon. You should check coverage and pick based on that if you need coverage in multiple areas.
norfolk,37vkg7,Riash,1 point,Mon Jun 1 16:22:40 2015 UTC,"No local experience with ATT and Sprint.  If you stay in the urban areas Tmo works fine. Out in rural areas it drops out really fast. It's pretty cheap though.  VZW has coverage virtually everywhere. My parents live out in the boonies, and I get LTE service out there inside their house. It's more expensive.  In others words, you will get what you pay for, provided you need/want rural coverage."

norfolk,37pgu5,Rice_cake17,2,Fri May 29 18:20:14 2015 UTC,"Hey, anybody know anything about darts? I picked up a decent board at a yard sale last weekend but no darts came with it. I'd like to get a set sooner rather than later but haven't really looked into anything yet - what makes a good set good, what a decent set is worth, etc. Shout if you know something. Thanks!"
norfolk,37pgu5,Diabeticus,2,Fri May 29 13:50:19 2015 UTC,"Hah, I found a decent set of darts and a crappy board near ODU after spring classes ended."
norfolk,37pgu5,Diabeticus,2,Fri May 29 13:53:00 2015 UTC,"Nice. This was up in Hampton, got the board for $3 and it looks to be in pretty great shape, just nothing to throw at it yet. There's also the issue of where I can put it that won't allow too much damage to the surrounding area & stuff..."
norfolk,37pgu5,Diabeticus,1 point,Fri May 29 13:55:15 2015 UTC,"The one I found near ODU came with a case (so I lucked out on the safe place to throw). I installed some hanger mounts outside so I can play darts while I grill or sit near the campfire. I just put the board in the shed when I'm not using it. It came with brass dart heads, plastic shafts, and beer and playing card themed flags."
norfolk,37pgu5,Diabeticus,1 point,Fri May 29 13:59:25 2015 UTC,"Based on the few times I've watched my girlfriend throw darts, I don't think a case is enough to keep the walls safe. Might need to get some corkboard backing if it stays inside but I like the outdoors angle."

I'm responsible for ""N.W.A."" in the men's bathroom and was an accomplice on the cat face/""you suck"" on the bar window. I was drinking Pimm's cups, had a French dog, and was over joyed at the tab.

Blacked out all the windows, walls, the bar, simplified their menu (I love it personally. Looks like a 4th grader did it in Word), and have a bucket of spray paint cans for friends/well-tipping customers.

That's the authentic one. Local Heroes comic book store and Cafe Stella for coffee right next door. Both worth checking out. Skinnie's Records is not too far if you're into that. I always tell people to go visit the USS Wisconsin. It's free. Chrysler Museum is pretty cool, that's free too.  I literally could write a book about all of the other recommendations.

Be sure to check out the sidebar and do some searches in this subreddit, there's plenty of info about what you're after.  The Ghent area of Norfolk is what you're after: north-south along Colley Ave between Princess Anne and 21st St, also east along 21st St.  Downtown Norfolk from the water up Granby St into the Arts District is a good walkable stretch of restaurants, too.   The Shore Dr/Chic's Beach area of Virginia Beach (Shore Dr west from Great Neck Rd) has some nice locals-only places, including the Lynnhaven Pub which is my go-to dive bar recommendation.  Town Center in Virginia Beach (Independence & Virginia Beach Blvd area) is nice but feels pretty manufactured and is mostly chains."

Criminals will be criminals but they are more likely to try cars that are in a darker area vs a well lit one. Always lock your doors even if you will be right back. If you see suspicious behavior report it maybe some lead will uncover the reason behind the recent spike in auto theft.

I lucked out by not being in norfolk or ptown. Truth is, teaching there is very hard for new teachers. Middle school science almost made me rethink being a teacher.   As for if  CS status is an asset or even viewed as one, it isn't necessarily yes or no. Some admins like it, some don't. In some classes, a purely pedagogical approach may be better than a ""well this is how and why things work in the real world"".   Prepare for a grind.

I agree with u/vilealgebraist and u/doryfishie.   STEM middle first, elementary second.    The key is if you love what you do, you'll be great. Listen, listen, listen.   Career switchers often think that they know the drill.   You don't.   Observe quality teachers from day one, ask questions.   Forget the noise.  Norfolk isn't a bad district.   Just like anywhere, you have good schools and bad schools.   My school is amazing.   My department is amazing.   My kids are awesome.     I've been doing this for almost 8 years now.    I love it.

I'm usually stuck inside turning press releases and bits of information from police or dispatchers or court cases into articles. That being said, that gives me the opportunity to have a hand in pretty much every controversial or interesting story that happens around here. Personally though, just out of my own interests, I love military stories and long drawn out court cases the best."

norfolk,36su0a,Diabeticus,2,Fri May 22 22:02:45 2015 UTC,"While Reddit isn't really a news site, I've posted a fair amount of articles and made a ton of typos. What kind of review process is there edit (for actual journalism)?   How much of a journalists work is done from home or remotely?  What is an average day in your life?"
norfolk,36su0a,EatMoreFiber,2,Thu May 21 21:30:28 2015 UTC,"The ""review process"" varies depending on what you do I suppose. For me, I write news stories that go out online. A lot of people tend to think we have proofreaders or editors whose sole jobs are to look over what we write before it goes out. Unfortunately, that's never been the case for anywhere I've worked. My proofreaders are basically the public. I write 10+ news articles every day for our website and it's hard NOT to make typos when you're moving fast. Typos happen to everyone and people will point them out immediately and they're never nice about it... Most of the time it's downright insulting. I do try very hard to not make mistakes and I'm happy to change the ones I do make. It's just hard to always see the mistakes myself before anyone else catches them.  As far as the shows or what you see on air goes, the show producers have a lot more eyes on their scripts so the mistakes SHOULD be fewer... but again, they happen. And again, people will point them out QUICKLY and HARSHLY! We see them too, though.   Here in local news, we don't necessarily do a lot of working from home. But most people are always on the lookout for stories, even when they're off the clock. Since my job consists primarily of online content, I can access all functions of my job from home, but there are a lot of things done in the newsroom that are necessary to be there for in order to do the job correctly.   Every morning we have a meeting where we discuss what is to be covered that day. Reporters, producers, news managers all attend the meeting and are all expected to come with ideas to pitch. I work with a team of several others and we spend our days posting all the local content that we are sent, reporter stories, and other news content to our websites. We also choose what is posted to our social media sites. I would say outside of a breaking news situation, the busiest time of day for me would be between 3pm and 530pm."
norfolk,36su0a,Diabeticus,2,Thu May 21 21:54:50 2015 UTC,"How much of a rivalry exists between stations, or employees of stations? How often do employees jump ship between local stations, or do you have to change markets to advance your career usually?"
norfolk,36su0a,Diabeticus,3,Thu May 21 21:49:18 2015 UTC,"A lot of the reporters from all three stations are actually friends and hang out together. Aside from the newsmaking decisions at each station, everyone is essentially doing the same thing, just maybe in a different way. There is rivalry to an extent, but there's also a bit of camaraderie. In some situations, yeah, we don't want another station's reporter butting in on what we're trying to get. But in other situations, reporters will share information out in the field. It really depends. I guess it's best to compare news stations to sports teams... Everyone does the same jobs but you're on different teams. And sometimes you can go have a beer together and no one cares.   Reporters and producers sign contracts. If they leave one station in the market, they likely have a clause that says they can't go work at another station in the same market for a period of time. If you're familiar with this area, you may remember seeing some of the anchors work for different stations at one time or another. It's not likely you'd see that occur as easily now.   A lot of people tend to just move to a different market unless there's something tying them here. We're market #42, which isn't bad... but a reporter would likely make more money in a bigger market."
norfolk,36su0a,TotesMessenger,2,Thu May 21 22:03:58 2015 UTC,"Worst and best story you've covered (either just a terrible topic or something tragic)?  Do you often use information or subjects that we cover here to assist in the stories you write?  A lot of people like to complain that investigative journalism is dead, what is your opinion? Do you think there has been a lapse in investigative journalism?"
norfolk,36su0a,mjr5245,2,Fri May 22 00:25:40 2015 UTC,"Gosh, I've had to write (and see) some crazy stuff. Surveillance videos that show people being killed... Probably the worst. Children being molested or abused....also really horrible. Best stories... Hmm, I'm just glad to write things that are happy and positive when I get the chance. It's hard to have to literally be the bearer of bad news all the time so anything that's remotely good, I enjoy. I love deployment homecomings because they're just full of genuine joy. If it can make me smile, it falls in the ""best"" category.   I am one of few Redditors on the newsroom, so I do use that to my advantage. If I see something mentioned here or someone has commented that brings up a good point about something or that might be a good story, I do bring it up at work. Like most info, ideas or tips or anything, everything I've ever seen shared here that I've brought up has been checked on and detailed out before it becomes something useable in a story.   I think investigative journalism is evolving, but it isn't dead. It's hard to keep up with how fast the world can find out anything and everything. You don't necessarily need a journalist to investigate things for you anymore. So the topics of what we can investigate need to shift to things that perhaps only we have the resources to look into. Unfortunately, those topics are often singular and don't really appeal to many people. So sadly, what's left to do? Grasp at whatever you can. If you're familiar with Serial podcast... That's an exceptional example of true investigative journalism.. And not only was it just investigative journalism, it was long-form (which is notoriously fading away) and in an underused and fairly new medium (podcasting). So yeah, not dead. I guess maybe off-track? At least as far as local news is concerned."

norfolk,36m3xm,EatMoreFiber,5,Wed May 20 11:49:50 2015 UTC,"This is a pretty long one, so hang in there with me.  When I was a teenager I used to spend summers just walking or biking around midtown Newport News, looking for new places to skate or things to do. I knew all the hidden passages, a path through the woods here or a broken fence there, ways to get from one place to another quickly where a vehicle would need to back out to larger roads. It came in handy as a non-driver at the time, but also for the occasional running from cops my friends and I would have to do. We weren't exactly troublemakers, but we were definitely trespassers.  A few of our hangout spots were ""shared"" and we knew that at night, older kids or homeless folks might occupy those places. There was this big storm drain in particular that was always peppered with graffiti and trash, even a busted up couch in there for a while. We'd usually bring our bikes through to avoid crossing the main road above it, and maybe take a breather and a piss on those hot days. It was a sort of gateway between a neighborhood and a big nebulous area of woods and railroads, so we went through there a lot.  So this one day I was hanging out with two friends, we'll call them Dan and Don, because those were their names. We make it to the storm drain and are doing our usual thing, being loud obnoxious teenagers and smashing glass and whatnot, and after a little while Dan just freezes, looking at the couch. I looked over at the couch and there was some ratty looking guy laying on it and just staring at us wide-eyed, apparently the whole time. He blended right in to the filthy torn up trashcouch so we didn't even notice him being only a few feet from us. The instant I saw him I could suddenly smell him as well, just an awful mix of feces and sweat and rot. He smelled like a long dead animal.  We all just stood there blinking at each other in silence for a few seconds, then like a shot the guy flies up off the couch and takes off into the wooded ravine side of the tunnel. He bounded like a deer, I've never seen anyone run like that before, he looked like a puppet. The three of us started laughing about it when Don picks up the guy's pack that he left behind the couch, and of course we immediately start going through it. This pack looked hand-made, more like a sack of burlap that the guy had sewn straps to, and inside was a bunch of old dried out bones. No skull, just a pile of grey bones.  We started making jokes about them being human bones, and I think we all got a little freaked out at that point and just left the bag on the couch. We decided to back out of the tunnel and head a different way instead of possibly running into that guy again. Running into homeless people in these places wasn't totally uncommon, but usually they were drunks that wanted to fight or rob us, so we always just kept our distance.  So about a week goes by, summer is drawing to a close and we're in those last few days of freedom that always seem just a little too short. Don called me up one morning and we made plans to meet in a specific neighborhood because he wanted to head over to this girl's house, Michelle. Michelle was a huge slut, especially for middle school, so I knew what we were about to spend the day at her pool exchanging clumsy gropes. Good times, you remember?  I pack up my bag with a towel and some other junk and hit the road on my bike. Now at this point I'm moving in a completely different direction from the storm tunnel, this is miles away from that whole area. I'm passing behind our school through this small patch of woods where BMX/trials kids had some ramps and stuff set up, and I hear this buzzing whistle, like someone trying to get my attention. A lot of times this passage had older kids hanging out, since it connected to the corner of an apartment complex at one point, and I'm not usually in the mood to get fucked with so I just ignored it. I got further away and I heard it again, so I turned back to look down the trail and see who it was, maybe a friend of mine after all. The path was totally clear and quiet so I knew someone was screwing with me now, when I hear the weird whistle again and notice it's coming from up in the trees somewhere. And of course, there he was. Suddenly that smell again.  The ratty guy from the tunnel was perched at the top of this tall, skinny tree. One of those trees that shoots up about 100 feet on a branchless 6 inch trunk, then breaks into a nest of branches once it reaches the canopy. And this crazy looking guy is just sitting in it swaying back and forth as comfortable as can be, cradling his bag, whistling at me. I mean, impossible.  So I just turned and bolted at that point, kind of freaked out that this guy not only recognized me, but that he was apparently all over town. We'd see transients near the railroads, but anyone this deep in town was a regular. And he knows me. Fuck.  I haul ass through the apartment complex and make it to the meetup spot in record time, drenched in sweat even though the morning was still pretty cool. Don was already there, drenched as well and freaking out about something, he dropped his bike and came running over to me when I rounded the corner. I'll never forget what he told me and I have no doubt that he firmly believed it himself, I knew the guy pretty well and we still keep in touch to this day, he's not the type to spin yarns and definitely not the type of freak out about anything. I never told him but I could tell he had been crying.  He told me that after he called me and left his house, he saw that guy following him through his neighborhood. He said he knew who he was right away and so he tried to keep his distance, but that he couldn't. He said as fast as he rode, every time he looked back the guy was crouching or hiding behind something, closer and closer every time. Impossible.  He said that he could hear the guy whispering stuff really fast, and he noticed as the guy got closer that he was whispering into his fist. He got closer still and he could see the guy was whispering into a ring. Closer still and Don could see the ring was a big fat fly, tied to his finger, buzzing around in place. Don is having a fully qualified episode as he recalls this to me, and somehow we ended up on the ground like both our knees buckled. I didn't even know how to tell him that I had just seen the creep as well, I'm not sure that I ever actually mentioned it to him.  Neither of us were religious at all, but I could tell Don meant every word when he told me ""That man was the fucking devil."" He said in the whispering he heard names, and they were all names that he knew. Brianjessicaandrewmartinbriannepauldanryanerikabillyalextrish. His family, his friends, even me. Fuck.  We walked the bikes over to Michelle's house and when we got there, that rising heat of noon in August had steeled us for the inept sexuality we were about to exhibit. By the time we were exposing ourselves on the diving board it was like we had forgotten all about the creep. As time went on over the years we discussed it less and less, and eventually we stopped bringing it up at all. I never saw the guy again, but a part of me knows that he's seen me. He's sat and watched me pass right under his feet, and it's always up to him to whistle or not.  TLDR: If you remember something that's impossible, you're probably remembering it wrong. Right?"

norfolk,36m3xm,bkcm4,2,Wed May 20 23:09:45 2015 UTC,"There's another story from a few years earlier that's less terrifying, this would have been maybe 90 or 91, the spring after a particularly icy winter. I remember that because we had an ice storm that took out a couple really tall pines behind my house, and we had to rebuild a section of the fence in the back.  I was out there with my Dad trying to help him dig holes and cement in posts, but I was only in maybe first grade so I'm not sure how much help I was being. Anyway, I remember my sister running into the backyard screaming like crazy, swatting all over. She ran over to us trailing a few bees and crying, and my Dad ran over to help her.  He picked her up and started swatting away the bees, but there were more and more in the air until we all went inside. I remember he said we probably kicked up a nest while digging post holes. So we're sitting there in the living room looking at all the bees through the front window, and we see this guy walking slowly down the street, just completely covered in bees.  It looked like he was wearing a dress of bees, that went up his back and around his chest, and swirled off his arms and head like tornadoes of fucking bees. Just strolling down the middle of my street on a spring Saturday morning. I looked up at my Dad and his jaw was on the floor, confirming my suspicion that this wasn't normal. My sister started screaming again and that's about all I remember, the king bee just walked off somewhere and out of our lives forever."

Another time I asked for new tires, and they installed used ones with less tread than the used tired I got rid of... A flat 3 months later just out of warranty...  Tried the Norfolk Used Tire Shop. Good prices on new tires from non name brand tire manufacturers but they wouldn't honor their warranty when I got a flat from road debris..

norfolk,360uru,BlindThievery,10,Fri May 15 13:43:27 2015 UTC,"In all honesty, I haven't seen anything in Portsmouth that is any worse than some sections of Norfolk. Especially due to the gentrification process that has been going on in p-town for the last decade.  They closed down several huge sprawling ghetto's and went broke building a college town around the new TCC.  Yes their leadership is in shambles, but at least they have something to show for it,  15 years ago ambulances wouldn't go into some neighborhoods without police back-up, now old ladies are walking poodles down the street and people drive around in golf carts.    I've actually witnessed a fatal stabbing in Norfolk near ODU.  My friend had his car stolen during broad daylight in Ghent.  People pretty regularly get raped under that overpass on hampton blvd, blocks from the highest rent district in the city.  That said, the historic district of old town is a beautiful place, lined with history, marinas, and mom&pop shops and restaurants.  Childrens museum, Virginia sports hall of fame, the Ntellos pavilion,  there are many reasons to go to Portsmouth.  Of course if you are looking for trouble, or crack, I'm sure you can still find it."

There aren't a ton of them, and it's a goddamned sausage party otherwise. Don't limit your exposure to people with other interests, because you're missing out on a myriad of experiences that you might actually enjoy if you don't at least try them. Don't define yourself as a geek, but be a person that likes geeky things. This area is very eclectic, and limiting your circle to only similar interests to begin with is going to hamper your ability to find people/special somebody to socialize with.

Most groups (at least for rpg's) are very accommodating to new players.  I've played a lot of rpg's like pathfinder, Star Wards, Dungeons and Dragons. All you need to do is ask if they have any sets nights or know of a group with openings. Figure out what system they play and roll a character.

norfolk,35vh9x,Justinjaw,1 point,Fri May 15 02:23:41 2015 UTC,"That's what I'm thinking, especially since it also said there where no signs warning against it. But it was the description on a YouTube video, so I guess you gotta take it with a grain of salt. We couldn't actually hear what was going on with the guy and the dog. I have to wonder though, if that's all it really was, would either of them actually been arrested if she hadn't acted that way?"

norfolk,35vh9x,SMRFETT,0,Thu May 14 12:20:56 2015 UTC,"Her questions weren't necessarily mundane, if she only asked them once. But the way she went about it was antagonizing and clearly just showing off for the camera.   Edit - added a word so sentence made sense."
norfolk,35vh9x,RaunchyFeet,1 point,Fri May 15 01:02:39 2015 UTC,"They weren't necessary if only asked once?  That doesn't make sense.  Showing off for the camera is something that happens spontaneously.  Her husband was being held against his will by police.  Regardless of the crime, the wife is clearly someone who is annoyed with the detention in general.  ""Showing off"" is just poor word choice."
norfolk,35vh9x,SMRFETT,1 point,Fri May 15 03:45:11 2015 UTC,"I just watched the video again. She didn't know him at all. She says to the officer after she's in cuffs that she's been watching from elsewhere with her friends and something about ""the poor guy"" referring to the guy with the dog. Neither of them acknowledge each other as if they know each other. I would hope if she was his wife he'd put up more of a protest when they cuffed her, or told her to STFU when she started running her mouth in the first place.   Also at the end of the video she asked the cops to give her belongings to her husband, who is off camera, because why would she ask them to give her belongings to someone else who got arrested?"
norfolk,35vh9x,RaunchyFeet,3,Fri May 15 10:41:53 2015 UTC,"It was diffiult to hear because of all of the wind.  I'm normally a lot more willing to listen to detail, but I was getting intermittently volume blasted by it.  I looked up the laws in Virginia, and they apparently still have vague failure to obey peace officer laws on the books.  What she did was against the law, but statements like these don't really mean much to me anymore.  After all, it's against the law to ""curse"" in areas like virginia beach despite the obvious first amendment protection we have that permits it; it's just that nobody has legally contested it.  Yes, I'm implying that this woman is 100% in her right to walk up to a casual police encounter like this one and ask questions - regardless of her tone being appreciated or not."
norfolk,35vh9x,SMRFETT,1 point,Sat May 16 01:51:16 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying the cops weren't out of line at all, they seemed a bit short tempered and quick to jump on arresting someone. But we don't know how much was going on before the camera was rolling on this girl either. Seems like the woman officer was a douche no matter the situation though. I never said I condoned the cops actions, I just said she was asking for what she got and was playing it up for the camera.  As far as the ""no cursing at the oceanfront"" rule, I think that's the stupidest 'law' and I have never understood how they get away with it. Just one of the reasons I never go down there. :)"
norfolk,35vh9x,RaunchyFeet,2,Sat May 16 02:43:11 2015 UTC,I think we've found general agreement here. Cheers.
norfolk,35vh9x,SMRFETT,0,Sat May 16 02:59:31 2015 UTC,"Her husband, if that's what he was, wasn't being ""detained"" when she first went up to them and started being a loud mouth. They were just talking to him from what I saw. SHE was the first person arrested because instead of coming up and listening patiently to what was happening, or just asking once in a non-threatening way, she had to show off for the camera, interrupt their conversation, and act like an ass. She could have gone up and said ""this is my husband and my dog, can you explain to me what's going on?"" Instead of standing closer to the camera and yelling ""EXCUSE ME IS HE BEING DETAINED?? AM I BEING DETAINED??"" across the beach, and then continuing to antagonize. She went about it the wrong way from the start, the cops knew what she was doing. SHE didn't say anything about it being her husband or their dog. She didn't make herself relevant to the situation.   What I'm saying is, if she had asked them in a better way she might have received an answer the first time she asked, and maybe neither of them would have gotten arrested, perhaps just a ""stern talking to.""  You can't actually think her actions where completely justified."

norfolk,35vh9x,vertexvortex,5,Fri May 15 00:24:52 2015 UTC,"I don't think I like cops saying that she's getting arrested for ""running her mouth"".    Also, an officer later threatened to charge an onlooker with obstruction for asking her name in a polite manner (around 11:15 or so).    Don't get me wrong, the woman seems a bit ridiculous, but the police response seems unreasonable as well."
norfolk,35vh9x,undetachablepenis,3,Thu May 14 07:34:05 2015 UTC,"Agreed. And everyone does have the right to know why they are being detained or arrested. Of course in the heat of the moment I don't expect the police to be 100% professional all the time, but to make a comment like that and not correct it is kind of a problem.  But yes, this woman was clearly guilty of both obstruction and resisting. She should have been arrested."
norfolk,35vh9x,Xarddrax,8,Thu May 14 11:50:54 2015 UTC,Ugggh somebody's watched too many youtube videos. Dumbass was just antagonizing police...great idea.

norfolk,35vh9x,evilrobert,6,Thu May 14 11:00:50 2015 UTC,Chick was being a bitch. I'm glad she was arrested.
norfolk,35vh9x,SMRFETT,4,Wed May 13 23:49:05 2015 UTC,"First, the video doesn't state if there's a relationship between her and the guy with the dog, which may be why she stepped in. Since the claim is that it's about the dog, OV beaches are open to the public and dogs on/off leash are allowed between Labor Day and Memorial Day. So whatever sign claim there is, is bollocks. Not to mention calling out Animal Control for a simple citation offense (no seizure there).   Second, the cops in shorts are beach cops. The short lady in her patrol uniform shouldn't even be there. This goes downhill against the police from the get go, when the detainee-to-be says ""can I ask a question"" and they point at her like an animal and tell her to back off. What if her question was ""there's a guy over here bleeding, can you help us""? They became hostile from the get go without provocation.   Lady cop also threatens the person taking the video with obstruction, for asking her name, which doesn't constitute as obstruction.   So, I guess a lot of people have no issue of having someone they know be detained and then being arrested just for asking if they're free to go.   The real dick move comes in where Officer McPissedoff refuses to give her stuff to her husband (who is likely the dude on the ground in the beginning), which includes the BOAT KEY that they needed so they could at least return to the dock and go downtown to retrieve the lady (which proves that they were all a group)."
norfolk,35vh9x,evilrobert,0,Fri May 15 01:14:14 2015 UTC,"Couple things:  1) She didn't know the guy with the dog at all. She says to the officer after she's in cuffs that she's been watching from elsewhere with her friends and something about ""the poor guy"" referring to the guy with the dog like she didn't know him. Neither of them acknowledge each other as if they know each other. I would hope if she was his wife he'd put up more of a protest when they cuffed her, or told her to STFU when she started running her mouth in the first place.   They took the guy's dog, which leads me to believe they arrested the guy with the dog, too. At the end of the video she asked the cops to give her belongings to her husband, who is off camera and not the guy with the dog, because why would she ask them to give her belongings to someone else who was being arrested? I agree it's bullshit they didn't at the very minimum give her husband the boat keys.   2) The female officer was most definitely a rude bitch, and on a power trip for sure. There's no need for that. But we also don't know what happened previous to the camera being turned on. It kinda seemed like there was more that happened than what we saw. They said something about ""we already told you"" close to the beginning of the video. Not condoning any of the police actions, I'm just saying.   Everyone has a right to question police or anyone in authority. But she wasn't doing it for the right reasons, or at least went about it the wrong way. We can be civil, just like the police should be. No need to put on a big dramatic show.   Bottom line, no one should have been arrested there. I don't even know why they were talking to the guy with the dog. Shouldn't have been an issue. I hope they let the girl off after they got back to the station. I can tell you I won't be taking my dog to any beaches in Norfolk after watching this."
norfolk,35vh9x,iliketowatchfootball,2,Sat May 16 03:16:02 2015 UTC,"Issue of civility comes into that they weren't from the get go. This entire situation would have been avoided if they'd have said ""No ma'am, he's not free to go at this moment. Thank you for your concern."" and continued on. Instead, they wanted to come of as badge toting pricks (which is the worst thing that can be done while being filmed), and pretty much bullied anyone who tried to speak during the situation.   Apparently the only place pets aren't allowed are on the rocks / jetties, which still isn't an arrestable / imprisonable offense though."
norfolk,35vh9x,drkev10,5,Sun May 17 18:04:59 2015 UTC,Chick should've just chilled. Probably would've been a non-issue had she just let the cops ask their bs questions. It felt like she was trying to bait them for the camera.

Your best bet would be to call up the pier and ask what they're getting a lot of around there. I've fished there before, caught a few small ones but nothing huge.   They also have a head boat that goes out from that pier. I think its 35$ for a four hour trip.  If I wasn't so busy this weekend I'd probably be down there fishing too."

One day I came to work and there was a dead body laying in the street in front of the bar. I called the police and it took about 30 minutes for them to show up. Big black transvestites would catch the tunnel bus from Portsmouth to Norfolk on Friday and Saturday nights. The tunnel bus would stop in front of Hawkins, so they would come into the store to look at fashion magazines. It was a strange and scary place...but damn it was interesting growing up there."

Closest Supercharging stations: Richmond, South Hill, Rocky Mount (NC), and Plymouth (NC).  While they do seem like great innovative vehicles - and if I were rich enough, I'd probably buy one myself - I don't really see the point of... well, maybe I do. It's a decent location - near the interchange of two major highways - and it could be a draw for more owners to come visit the area. Yay tourism!   I hope the City of Norfolk will work hard to streamline the entire process for Tesla Motors. This could be a really good thing for the area!"
norfolk,35lxz9,need_my_amphetamines,6,Mon May 11 19:58:55 2015 UTC,A tesla dealership near the supercharger station would be great.
norfolk,35lxz9,Diabeticus,4,Mon May 11 21:13:11 2015 UTC,"It's more of a selling point to the people not in Norfolk to have a place to charge in Norfolk. They're probably trying to dot the US map with stations all over.  That location is fairly central. It's a selling point used to buyers all over the country.  They probably should put one on the Peninsula as well.    I can't imagine the property and electric bill is all that high.  What's the authorization mechanism to prevent people with other brand cars from charging at the Tesla brand stations? Can other brand owners pay to use the Tesla brand stations?  I live in Northern VA now and I see Tesla's from time to time. A friend had a roadster but it was recently totaled in an accident and he said insurance is being a pain with it (considering it an exotic.)   I mostly see Model S cars around here, have not been to dealership would not drop $80K on a car. But cheers to those that do and make that industry a reality!"
norfolk,35lxz9,telmnstr,2,Mon May 11 22:53:47 2015 UTC,"The auth mechanism is, I believe, a patented plug - very simple, and effective.  Superchargers are only useful to Tesla's at the moment, as Tesla's are the only cars with battery/charging mechanisms that can handle the super high charge load (it's not a standard 110/220 outlet - the 'super' charge works in like 30-45 minutes instead of overnight).  I'm seriously considering buying one now...I wouldn't have to ever pay to charge it up, a charge would last 2-3 weeks or so, and I can get to DC and back now.  So tempting."

I don't think it makes much sense for them to put a dealership in this area. Their dealerships are more showrooms, and I bought my car after having done a good amount of research from my phone. It's being fulfilled by their Raleigh showroom, and they're actually delivering to my house this weekend. Based on the demographics of the area, I don't think it really makes financial sense for them to invest in a showroom here.  They're making a mistake putting the supercharger at JANAF. Local owners charge at their house, and it's really only for out of towners. In my mind, these are going to be people going to the outer banks (there's a charger down there also) or to VA Beach. I think they should put the supercharger at the I-64/168 interchange."
