Everything was simpler (scifi tv show had simple sets and models, not like hypertechnical hyperrealistic things of today), so as kids we'd be satisfied with simple things. I saw someone's kid playing with old legos, he was satisfied with old models. No way to read his brain, but for young ones, it seems that any legos is wonderfully amazing.  The complex HD sets of today are aimed at adult who grew with LEGOs."

AFOL,33h4r1,Snake1052,2,Wed Apr 22 14:46:20 2015 UTC,Why did you go by color instead of row by row? Wouldn't it take forever to locate each pixel individually?
AFOL,33h4r1,chewitt,1 point,Thu Apr 23 01:39:12 2015 UTC,"That's a great question. As a beginner, it would be more efficient, certainly. But there are a few answers I'd suggest:   if you use larger sizes than 1x1 for some colors, you've already broken into the next row, which can throw things off a bit. (or at the very least, you've had to stop to peek at the next row to be sure your Lego element will fit.) and; it breaks up the monotony. I'm very comfortable with the tedious nature of assembling mosaics - it relaxes me. But even I can't act like a dot-matrix printer for 144 rows. It would make the process feel a lot more sterile, and even though I'm following a guide I pre-designed, a lot less ""organic."" **EDIT: forgot to list my 3rd reason: It looks better on video to have things come together in blotches of color. Early video tests made the process look way too mechanical. I like having my hands fly around all crazy - it shows that a human made this.   tl;dr: Great question - some do it that way, but my way is more fun."

AFOL,32thzz,HONEST2BRICKNESS,-2,Fri Apr 17 00:29:00 2015 UTC,"It seems that it's very easy for those without imagination to look at a build and say ""Well of course that's how you do it! How could you do it any other way?"" You want to copy that - that's fine, just give credit. Don't say 'this guy also built what I've done and any any similarities are entirely coincidental because this is the only way it can be built.'  I spent a LOT of time working on my buildings, and about half the work spent on each building was done before a single brick was even placed. My buildings were designed to be a very specific size. The whole town was planned out on paper first - each building was given a specific amount of real estate based on baseplate sizes. I do this because I take my display to many shows and I need the display to be easy to set up and take down. This modular method (which I've been developing for over 6 years) dictates just how much space I can devote to the individual landmarks. After space is figured out, I then go through each and every building and draw out just how it will fit in the space allotted. I use multiple visual sources - and for a 20+ year old show, many shots of the exact same building are wildly at odds with each other, so I had to figure out what was the best way, in my opinion, to depict each structure.   I draw out the footprint for each and every building. I figure out where to put doors and windows, how many of each I should put in (because often my limited space means that using the 'correct' number of windows just won't work well), and how much space between each, as well as leaving enough space around the buildings so they don't look too crowded when placed together. Choosing the right colors is also important - many of the colors I wanted to use were very limited in their piece selection, so that greatly influenced many of the builds.  And then kyubi comes along and replicates my exact building footprints, my spacing and sizing, even my roofs. Why does he need to build to the exact same size and same way as mine? Yes there are differences, but those are mostly in the details while the overall construction remains the same.  You want to know what happens when you build these buildings based on your own skill and designs? Check this out: https://www.flickr.com/photos/legosambo/sets/72157644328428693 Bunch of builders in Sydney got together and made their own Springfield in their own way, for better or worse. Flander's house is designed to fit with the Simpson House set (which I belatedly realized I couldn't use, as I'd made the lot allowance in my layout too small!). They have their original versions of the kwik-e-mart, moes, and krusty burger. I particularly like the Burns mansion, something I was considering but discarded because my vision for it was ending up looking too similar in style to my Town Hall (also, lots of pieces!).  And since this is the relevant post for it, check out their church: https://www.flickr.com/photos/legosambo/14000158715/in/set-72157644328428693  I like their version better then mine. Their larger scale allowed them to be more accurate - then were even able to include the narthex at the back, which I chose to omit due to my spacing requirements (32x48). Guess what kyubi also didn't build, even though he gave himself a full 48 x 48 to work with?  So, in review:  The church:  Mine: https://www.flickr.com/photos/pepa_quin/14488879082/  Kyubi: https://www.flickr.com/photos/7kyubi7/17142669326/  Town Hall:  Mine: https://www.flickr.com/photos/pepa_quin/14305549048/  Kyubi: https://www.flickr.com/photos/7kyubi7/17097640092/  Moe's:  Mine: https://www.flickr.com/photos/pepa_quin/14519852323/  Kyubi: https://www.flickr.com/photos/7kyubi7/16793128839/  (Dark Tan is very limited in piece selection, and it took me some time to figure how how to build the roof so I could place in the purple trim and facade. Yes, he used a different purple but tell me this isn't a direct copy).  His Krusty Burger borrows the roof, but not much else:  Mine: https://www.flickr.com/photos/pepa_quin/14496410744/  Kyubi: https://www.flickr.com/photos/7kyubi7/17052168066/  And lastly the Kwik-e-Mart:  Mine: https://www.flickr.com/photos/pepa_quin/14507322225/  Kyubi: https://www.flickr.com/photos/7kyubi7/15880232943/  Totally original design, and very well built. Even resembles the new set in many ways, although as I recall this was built this before we even saw leaked pictures of the set. Nice take on the Flander's car, too.  So, why can't you do your own thing? And if you truly can't, why can't you admit that your designs are based on my own? Simply saying 'this guy also built Springfield!' really doesn't cut it.  You're an Iron Builder, man. Act like it."
AFOL,32pwjw,JamesonG42,1 point,Wed Apr 15 19:32:51 2015 UTC,The one thing I wanted answered wasn't. How are the buildings attached to the 45Â° baseplates?
AFOL,32pwjw,negot8or,3,Thu Apr 16 10:59:47 2015 UTC,"Due to the 45 degree angles, there is no attachment to the baseplates, though everything is ""trapped"" by the edging. The square root of 2 is a cruel mistress - any section would only be able to attach with a single stud to the base anyway."
AFOL,32pwjw,ComicDebris,1 point,Thu Apr 16 11:23:44 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing the nice part is that, when it comes time to tile grass, there are plenty of 45 degree pieces that match up to the building edges."
AFOL,32pwjw,ComicDebris,1 point,Thu Apr 16 16:40:39 2015 UTC,"Actually, the grass is all parallel to the walls, and mostly 45 degrees off from the edging... But yeah the 45 degree green plates are very useful for this."

AFOL,2q3jd8,BrickBuddy,-2,Mon Dec 22 20:28:14 2014 UTC,Can someone's work be so amazing that it takes the gleam off my own amazing work? Not sure. But this guy comes very close.
AFOL,2q344g,6kyubi6,5,Mon Dec 22 17:41:46 2014 UTC,Would make a neat set.  Too bad it's not a real one:  http://www.eurobricks.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=103659
AFOL,2q344g,letgomylego,1 point,Mon Dec 22 18:35:28 2014 UTC,I think they know that - since they made it.
AFOL,2q344g,th_squirrel,1 point,Wed Jan 7 19:51:13 2015 UTC,"Wow. That is amazing and looks like something LEGO would make. You definitely have a vote from me on Eurobrick contest.   LEGO, if you are reading this pay this person for the rights to this and make it for next year."
AFOL,2q344g,PenguinoMF,1 point,Mon Dec 22 19:23:27 2014 UTC,I love it. Absolutely love it. It looks entirely official in brick usage and design. Your eye for detail and creativity is astounding. Well done.
AFOL,2q344g,silverence,1 point,Mon Dec 22 20:49:29 2014 UTC,"Those snowmen are awesome, but is that a rubberband holding the broom to one of them?"
AFOL,2q344g,SnapHook,1 point,Mon Dec 22 20:59:24 2014 UTC,Yes it is (an official Lego one :D)
AFOL,2q344g,TiberiusKrasus,1 point,Mon Dec 22 21:02:06 2014 UTC,Would putting part 4547649 on the base work?
AFOL,2q344g,Tooie,1 point,Sat Jan 3 17:54:58 2015 UTC,I would buy this if it was real!
AFOL,2q344g,Lostmygooch,1 point,Wed Dec 31 01:33:14 2014 UTC,ZOMG !!! Is this real lol ? Where can I buy one ?
AFOL,2pz80w,par016,4,Sun Dec 21 15:39:36 2014 UTC,I've put the whole set up on LEGO ideas if anybody is interested in supporting it. Thanks.
AFOL,2pz80w,fotolabman,2,Sun Dec 21 17:11:01 2014 UTC,Cool I've wanted to add to my mini modulars
AFOL,2pz80w,letgomylego,2,Sun Dec 21 17:40:15 2014 UTC,"Thanks, I've got LDD files for anybody interested."
AFOL,2pz80w,mrpatrikstar1337,2,Sun Dec 21 18:06:29 2014 UTC,"Yes, please!"
AFOL,2pz80w,HobbitFoot,2,Sun Dec 21 18:39:37 2014 UTC,What's the best way to send it to you?
AFOL,2pz80w,Firocket1690,1 point,Sun Dec 21 19:48:32 2014 UTC,I'm also interested! You could use http://www.file-upload.net or any other free file hoster
AFOL,2pz80w,Finkarelli,1 point,Mon Dec 22 12:56:28 2014 UTC,Can I get a copy of your LDD files for your models too? They look great.
AFOL,2pqaov,malydilnar,4,Thu Dec 18 22:50:04 2014 UTC,"My first Ship I built over this past summer. I uploaded a shitty edited picture a while ago to this sub, but forgot this one Hope you guys like it!"
AFOL,2pqaov,Nostromosexual,3,Thu Dec 18 22:51:48 2014 UTC,"Dude, your stuff is mindblowing. Seriously revitalized my interest in Lego. Just started following you on flickr... Keep building!"
AFOL,2pqaov,KnowledgeSeeker94,3,Fri Dec 19 05:21:38 2014 UTC,"Thanks, will do!"
AFOL,2pqaov,infinitetheory,3,Fri Dec 19 05:36:05 2014 UTC,Dang that thing is way bigger than I thought at first! I looked through some of the other photos on Flickr it's big!
AFOL,2pqaov,oxideseven,3,Fri Dec 19 05:32:58 2014 UTC,"Thanks man, when you build with studs facing the front or back it makes the build look smaller"
AFOL,2podc0,6kyubi6,1 point,Thu Dec 18 12:05:25 2014 UTC,Nice!  Those tan ladders are everywhere lately -- what's up with that?
AFOL,2podc0,fastlindyrick,1 point,Thu Dec 18 13:57:03 2014 UTC,"this is the ladder-tree, this is where they harvest them to use in the city"
AFOL,2podc0,Electric_unicorn,1 point,Thu Dec 18 15:11:15 2014 UTC,That made me think of this music. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AphxyjrH4SE
AFOL,2pqmfw,Ochre_Jelly,2,Fri Dec 19 00:37:40 2014 UTC,"Dammit Iain, you're nuts."
AFOL,2pkaeo,6kyubi6,3,Wed Dec 17 09:33:50 2014 UTC,This must have been frustrating to build... I can imagine all those little parts making up the mudguards snapping off if you just look at them wrong!
AFOL,2pkaeo,100011101011,3,Wed Dec 17 15:42:56 2014 UTC,That is really nice.  I feel kind of inadequate.
AFOL,2pkaeo,I_am_anonymous,1 point,Wed Dec 17 16:38:57 2014 UTC,"Beautiful!  and delicate looking, oh my!"
AFOL,2pkaeo,firsthour,1 point,Wed Dec 17 21:40:43 2014 UTC,I wish LEGO made sets like this; something an adult could build (difficult) and still put up on their desk/window/shelf
AFOL,2piuac,BartDeDobbelaer,6,Wed Dec 17 00:01:51 2014 UTC,This is so fucking intense and well done my mind has no idea what to take in first.  That funky metal space structure thingy?  The badass robot?  The awesome background/dunes/building?  The trippy flora?  The radical spaceship?  This is all so awesome!
AFOL,2piuac,Admiral_crackbar,5,Wed Dec 17 01:36:43 2014 UTC,"Every time I find some big somewhat specific piece, like those cockpit bottoms, I get annoyed at how I couldn't do anything else with them besides what they were intended for. Then I see this and realize that I need more imagination, lol."
AFOL,2piuac,CalvinDehaze,2,Wed Dec 17 01:46:04 2014 UTC,That's beatifull...
AFOL,2piuac,ChillyWords,2,Wed Dec 17 05:17:51 2014 UTC,Jesus this is the coolest thing I've ever seen.
AFOL,2piuac,inVizi0n,2,Wed Dec 17 19:10:03 2014 UTC,I seriously looked at this for almost a minute and thought it was a painting in the art subreddit. Been looking at art all morning and I had to zoom in to notice the lego. Great work on everything.
AFOL,2piuac,mostNONheinous,1 point,Wed Dec 17 21:42:10 2014 UTC,Amazing!  How do you do your lighting?  There's also a sort of low-level fog going on; how did you manage that?
AFOL,2piuac,fastlindyrick,2,Wed Dec 17 13:21:02 2014 UTC,"Lightning is done using a LivingColor Led light (from Philips), fog by a smoke machine (normally used in a reptile terrarium)."

AFOL,2pe9lu,getting_serious,5,Mon Dec 15 21:34:45 2014 UTC,Haha I just printed it out off the web. No one at my work gets it!
AFOL,2pe9lu,tbonesocrul,3,Mon Dec 15 21:37:56 2014 UTC,"Yeah dude, thats a great poster"
AFOL,2pe9lu,BlackSquirrelBoy,10,Tue Dec 16 00:45:43 2014 UTC,"""Well isn't that a pretty picture. Santa rollin' down the block in a PANZER!"""
