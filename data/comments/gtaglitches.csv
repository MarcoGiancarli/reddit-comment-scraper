gtaglitches,3dz22a,TheDarwinChronicles,7,Tue Jul 21 08:03:36 2015 UTC,Because you're using your phone to video it instead of recording it straight from the console

gtaglitches,3dqcj8,ChrisJones93,-1,Tue Jul 21 03:58:20 2015 UTC,I ran into none of them in the three times I beat the game... Maybe you got the bug DLC. Or maybe you should try reinstalling the game.
gtaglitches,3dqcj8,153Skyline,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:25:45 2015 UTC,You probably didn't run into any of them because you didn't look for them.
gtaglitches,3dnrtg,Helpmeplez333,14,Fri Jul 17 19:45:38 2015 UTC,What system are you on? Also... What do you mean by sign out? Of psn? Or just exit online mode? Id like to try this out.
gtaglitches,3dnrtg,Paper_chasers,3,Fri Jul 17 19:54:23 2015 UTC,"I haven't tried it, but I imagine you'd sign out of your account (PSN or XBL) before finishing the race and it causes you to be kicked back to Single Player. Sign back in and rejoin online"
gtaglitches,3dnrtg,MrSpanky1193,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:19:02 2015 UTC,I'm on Xbox 360. It doesn't work if you exit online mode.
gtaglitches,3dnrtg,Leeroy1982,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:27:52 2015 UTC,you need to sign out of your account
gtaglitches,3dnrtg,prokill3r,5,Sun Jul 19 20:57:27 2015 UTC,Loose Canyon is my favorite air race to complete that objective. What's yours?
gtaglitches,3dnrtg,GTAthrowawayaccount,2,Fri Jul 17 21:17:57 2015 UTC,Burn Your Bridges is good cause there's bridges everywhere.
gtaglitches,3dnrtg,Bieberkinz,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:57:27 2015 UTC,Flying Low because you can do the knife flight early in the race and it counts as flying under a bridge.    And if you miss it there's still a lot of bridges along the rest of the course.
gtaglitches,3dnrtg,DrunkenRobot7,9,Sat Jul 18 22:22:41 2015 UTC,Got it to work with last daily objective as survival. Got killed then signed out of psn then logged back in. Spawned in got $25k and rp and still had that as objective. Thanks!  Edit:  not sure I'm getting cash.  Did it twice and don't think it saves. Confirmed it does not save
gtaglitches,3dnrtg,MisterSmith123,2,Sat Jul 18 07:24:07 2015 UTC,This needs to be up voted for visibility.   So you are looking at your money total and it's not saving? Or what dot it mean by that?
gtaglitches,3dnrtg,GTA_Stuff,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:33:03 2015 UTC,No change in money or rp from before starting last objective. It gives you the message that you hot $25k and 6000 rp but you don't get it and the objective is still unchecked as incomplete. Tried it 5 times to be sure
gtaglitches,3dnrtg,MisterSmith123,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:37:56 2015 UTC,Thanks
gtaglitches,3dnrtg,GTA_Stuff,2,Sat Jul 18 15:42:37 2015 UTC,Will you get the RP too?
gtaglitches,3dnrtg,kj515011,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:06:36 2015 UTC,"would i sign out or quit the game by press home button, start and quit, would that work"
gtaglitches,3dnrtg,forgottenshock,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:42:43 2015 UTC,does this also work with other objectives

gtaglitches,3dnrtg,SkyKing1776,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:45:05 2015 UTC,nice to find other working glitches
gtaglitches,3dnrtg,prokill3r,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:45:21 2015 UTC,If you had seen my previous comment... forget about it!  THIS IS WORKING. (On PS4 for sure)  Important Notes:   Should work with any daily objective (D.O.) you can complete in a race or mission. After completing the final D.O. you need to wait for the cash to save... go through some checkpoints if you're in a race or change your clothing if in a mission.
gtaglitches,3dnrtg,SkyKing1776,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:43:21 2015 UTC,"Ok so I complete the final D.O. in the middle of a race/mission and wait a bit then log out of ps4 and log back in, that's all I have to do? Do I have to wait a bit to log back in?"
gtaglitches,3dnrtg,TheArmenianThor,2,Mon Jul 20 16:17:53 2015 UTC,"That's it...  I usually log out, go back to the game, accept message and start to load into SP, then log back in and as soon as SP loads start up another online session."
gtaglitches,3dnrtg,SkyKing1776,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:17:48 2015 UTC,It works for me also! Today is my 7th day in a row so I'm getting 100k each time!
gtaglitches,3dnrtg,HRMisHere,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:35:02 2015 UTC,Anyone else confirm R* nuked the RP payout from 6K to 3K?
gtaglitches,3dnrtg,SkyKing1776,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:30:00 2015 UTC,"So my objectives today are:  Play a Deathmatch  Mod a vehicle at LS Customs  Steal a vehicle from the military base  I'm guessing I won't be able to do this glitch with any of those because the objectives are only complete when the job is finished and not during, but can anyone prove me wrong?"
gtaglitches,3dnrtg,T-BoneCapone,2,Tue Jul 21 14:20:00 2015 UTC,You should be able to steal a vehicle while on the military base during a mission.  Then change your outfit and wait a minute or two so the game can save the cash to your bank... I usually blow some shit up with sticky bombs :-)  Then proceed with the rest of the glitch.
gtaglitches,3dnrtg,SkyKing1776,2,Tue Jul 21 14:52:25 2015 UTC,"That's great advice, I'll give it a try. Thanks mate!"

gtaglitches,3dowi5,SirMarshmellow,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:44:20 2015 UTC,So if i biy them at that price can i aell the at profit?
gtaglitches,3dowi5,pr_pirates,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:28:25 2015 UTC,I sold my Karuma and then bought another one made about 150k profit.
gtaglitches,3dowi5,bosstroller69,3,Sat Jul 18 22:43:21 2015 UTC,Profit? Unless your first karuma was duped you still paid for that one and lost money bud
gtaglitches,3dowi5,I_eat_my_own_boogers,-3,Sun Jul 19 01:01:31 2015 UTC,What I paid for my first kuruma doesn't factor into this equation. What I sold it for and then how much I paid for the discounted one is the profit I'm talking about minus upgrades.
gtaglitches,3dowi5,bosstroller69,2,Sun Jul 19 07:52:51 2015 UTC,Math isn't your best subject is it
gtaglitches,3dowi5,I_eat_my_own_boogers,-1,Sun Jul 19 14:13:36 2015 UTC,Ok in going to explain this to you one more time ready? Say I start with $1 million and then I sell my kuruma for 400k I now have $1.4 million. If I then buy the discounted Kuruma for 260k I now have made a profit of about 140k without upgrades. I know I don't make profit off of what I spent on the original kuruma because it's a given that you can't sell cars in this game for more than what you buy them for. I hope I made the numbers easy enough for you. Booger eater.
gtaglitches,3dowi5,bosstroller69,3,Sun Jul 19 17:24:38 2015 UTC,"So you buy a kuruma for 500k before it's half off and put 500k in upgrades on it and then sell it for 400k and then buy your new kuruma for 260k. Where is your ""profit""? You only have 140k out of your million and a kuruma with no upgrades."
gtaglitches,3dowi5,ginganinja1003,-1,Sun Jul 19 19:38:29 2015 UTC,500k in upgrades? What do you think I'm buying solid gold seats?
gtaglitches,3dowi5,bosstroller69,2,Sun Jul 19 20:18:19 2015 UTC,"It's around 500k to put all engine, transmission, turbo, ect. upgrades on any sports car."
gtaglitches,3dowi5,ProwlerCaboose,-1,Sun Jul 19 20:27:21 2015 UTC,No it's not it's like 300k.
gtaglitches,3dowi5,bosstroller69,2,Sun Jul 19 22:53:31 2015 UTC,What difference does it make? You're still losing money even if you did get a 140k profit from buying the discounted one.
gtaglitches,3dowi5,TheBSGamer,0,Mon Jul 20 00:41:11 2015 UTC,"just bought and fully upgraded a Karin Kuruma sense it was on sale, was 500k for the top upgrades to make the car sell for the most."
gtaglitches,3dowi5,ProwlerCaboose,-1,Mon Jul 20 01:36:59 2015 UTC,was the kuruma not upgraded? if so i can see how you made a profit but if it was upgraded i cant...
gtaglitches,3dowi5,T3STI,-1,Mon Jul 20 06:32:43 2015 UTC,Don't they send you a refund at a later time? It's what they are doing for the 25% rebate on the other cars(which the deal has ended).
gtaglitches,3dowi5,LogIN87,4,Sat Jul 18 02:08:11 2015 UTC,That was a different deal
gtaglitches,3dowi5,xwhocares3x,-1,Sat Jul 18 02:10:48 2015 UTC,"I know it was a different deal, but don't you think they would do the same thing for this deal as the last?"
gtaglitches,3dowi5,LogIN87,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:12:37 2015 UTC,No because its part of the heist special event. Discounting crs through verified emails and such I felt was geared towards a discount for honest players.
gtaglitches,3dowi5,xwhocares3x,3,Sat Jul 18 02:16:47 2015 UTC,Does this mean we can buy the vehicles for half off and sell them back for more after the sale?
gtaglitches,3dowi5,Blackice200,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:07:13 2015 UTC,"ummm no, not exactly. before = buy for 700,000              upgrade for 300,000              total = 1,000,000             sell price = 500,000 or 400,000.  50% off = buy for 350,000                upgrade for 300,000                  total = 650,000                  sell for 500,000 or 400,000. you're still losing money, but not as much"
gtaglitches,3dowi5,T3DDY173,1 point,Sat Jul 18 10:10:23 2015 UTC,If you don't upgrade it? What's the resale price? 50% of discount price? Or 50% or normal retail?
gtaglitches,3dowi5,GTA_Stuff,2,Sat Jul 18 13:35:56 2015 UTC,"well if u dont upgrade it im guessing its like 100k or 200k less. depends on car, either way ur not making profit unless u dupe it."
gtaglitches,3dowi5,T3DDY173,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:12:28 2015 UTC,That was my guess too. Just wondering if you had any hard numbers. Thx
gtaglitches,3dowi5,GTA_Stuff,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:24:05 2015 UTC,It's only like 550k normally it was 225k today.
gtaglitches,3dowi5,StartsControversy,0,Sun Jul 19 09:06:54 2015 UTC,i just used random numbers to show.

gtaglitches,3dowi5,LogIN87,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:18:48 2015 UTC,It was clearly a promotion to build up R*'s email list.

gtaglitches,3dowi5,TheDarwinChronicles,-1,Sat Jul 18 01:48:38 2015 UTC,It will probably give a rebate
gtaglitches,3dplq8,gtavisyo,3,Sat Jul 18 05:38:02 2015 UTC,I think you meant to say skip to step 3? (If playing on console)

gtaglitches,3dmdaf,GTAthrowawayaccount,3,Fri Jul 17 13:10:56 2015 UTC,Yeah a tried this on PC a while back and never worked. Thinks its only Console.
gtaglitches,3dmdaf,toffytastic,0,Fri Jul 17 13:48:37 2015 UTC,Yup seems right the textures may be thicker on PC making it harder to travel through them. Edit: Clip brushes not textures.
gtaglitches,3dmdaf,Bryguy1717,3,Fri Jul 17 21:42:43 2015 UTC,"Textures don't have thickness. They're just graphical textured mapped to vertices/coordinates. And graphics are not a ""thing"" -- they're just coordinates of a texture map that the game is calling up and mapping to the geometry."
gtaglitches,3dmdaf,GTA_Stuff,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:47:16 2015 UTC,"He might have meant the clip brushes in front of the wall textures. They might be thicker. I wouldn't have thought so though. That would be needlessly complicated when porting the maps over. I'm gonna try this next time i'm on regardless.  Edit: Tried on PC against a few walls, and couldn't get it to work, the closest I can get is consistently killing myself underneath the tank. It seems to want to just push you out as if you're entering illegal co-ordinates."

There is 4 double doors and one of them is cracked open, and if you look inside you can see a snowman and some crates.

gtaglitches,3djmg3,d1g1t4lp3n3tr8r,6,Thu Jul 16 22:09:43 2015 UTC,I could see this as a money glitch. Let's say someone has 400 million and they withdraw it all. The mugger steals 10k maximum and the glitch can make like 20+ muggers . kill them all and you can get 200k
gtaglitches,3djmg3,Lollistic_Biscuit,3,Fri Jul 17 02:14:43 2015 UTC,"It's a longshot, it would be awesome to watch tho"
gtaglitches,3djmg3,Nuguns21,3,Fri Jul 17 04:46:36 2015 UTC,"I think if one mugger succeeds, they'd all quit.  Plus, if you kill the mugger you only get your own money back. So if they steal 10k of your 400,000,000, you would have 399,990,000. Then you kill them and steal it back. 4,000,000,000 again.   And if you mean call a mugger on someone else who has 400,000,000 and kill the mugger, then sure I suppose you would get the 10k. But isn't that the same as calling muggers on players throughout LS?"
gtaglitches,3djmg3,GTA_Stuff,2,Sat Jul 18 13:54:02 2015 UTC,"So if they steal 10k of your 400,000,000, you would have >399,990,000. Then you kill them and steal it back. 4,000,000,000 > again.    Sounds like an easy $3.6billion"

Certain places you can take cover where your character cannot step around a corner, but you can see around the corner (IE an elevated high cover spot with no platform on the side). If you press the aim button, your character will try to step out to aim, but instead be near the cover anyway. Your character will shoot through the cover to hit the target."
gtaglitches,3cz7u7,bassEnt,3,Sun Jul 12 05:47:47 2015 UTC,Iv noticed similar to this At the clothing stores like binco where they have a small room behind the cashier desk. If you go into the back room you can shoot a rocket through the wall and out the front door.  I was pleasantly surprised when I learnt that when I didn't blow myself up.
gtaglitches,3cz7u7,bassEnt,1 point,Sun Jul 12 08:16:59 2015 UTC,I definitely works on PS3. If it doesn't work for any others shops I know for sure it worked at The Binco near the strip club.
gtaglitches,3cw3yk,Sgt_Barrel,15,Sat Jul 11 07:07:01 2015 UTC,Happened to me too. The spoiler simply gets stuck if damaged. I've had it stuck in both up and down positions.  However on this pic it does indeed look more raised than usual.
gtaglitches,3cw3yk,nevuial,5,Sat Jul 11 07:19:59 2015 UTC,so if i have the spoiler up i could drift into a wall to damage it and manage to get it stuck in the up position?
gtaglitches,3cw3yk,nevuial,6,Sat Jul 11 10:06:15 2015 UTC,"Yup, but it seems quite hard to do on purpose"
gtaglitches,3cw3yk,ALPB11,1 point,Sat Jul 11 10:16:35 2015 UTC,It's quite tricky to do if you have armor upgrades on your car because then the metal doesn't bend as easy to get it stuck.
gtaglitches,3cw3yk,skaerlo,5,Mon Jul 13 13:45:39 2015 UTC,I manage to damage mine into being stuck down pretty much every time I take it out. Never managed to get it stuck up though
gtaglitches,3cw3yk,ForTheMotherLAN,7,Sat Jul 11 13:22:18 2015 UTC,When the spoiler is damaged it affects both traction and braking severely. The spoiler is actually what makes this car top of the class.
gtaglitches,3cw3yk,nevuial,3,Sat Jul 11 15:01:58 2015 UTC,"Really? Wow, everyday I'm amazed by the amount of nice details in this game !"

gtaglitches,3cw3yk,picodroid,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:34:37 2015 UTC,"I saw that being stuck down will cause it to drive worse, I wonder if being stuck up would make it drive differently than normal as well.   Could be that the damage occurred near the spoiler so the spoiler motion and its effects (better driving style) are disabled, though."
gtaglitches,3cw3yk,StarKiller0012,-1,Sat Jul 11 20:59:34 2015 UTC,Are we talking the blue or red car?
gtaglitches,3cw3yk,SPR3ZZATURA,4,Mon Jul 13 01:33:41 2015 UTC,"Red because he was stationary with the spoiler up high, higher than usual"
gtaglitches,3cusft,Agento420,23,Fri Jul 10 23:12:16 2015 UTC,this is part of the event...
gtaglitches,3cusft,T3DDY173,6,Fri Jul 10 23:24:07 2015 UTC,I'm guessing it only works when you are lvl 100 or above?
gtaglitches,3cusft,greenday1304,-1,Fri Jul 10 23:25:07 2015 UTC,"I think it is only the metallic gold paint which is free, not metal gold/pure gold. I saw it earlier but didn't check the metal paint. I assume that you still need to pay and be level 100 for it."
gtaglitches,3cusft,nikor62,12,Fri Jul 10 23:51:24 2015 UTC,"No, pure gold and brushed gold are free right now but you do have to be level 100"

gtaglitches,3cusft,thelegendblue,7,Sat Jul 11 03:48:38 2015 UTC,Paint doesn't affect sell value
gtaglitches,3cusft,WhatsThisButton,7,Sat Jul 11 05:48:11 2015 UTC,Paint doesn't affect the value if I remember correctly.
gtaglitches,3cusft,MC_NAHUATL,-3,Sat Jul 11 05:49:04 2015 UTC,"Maybe once the event is over and the value goes back up.  But if you just go and paint a car gold and try and sell it, the value won't change because the gold paint is free so it adds no value."
gtaglitches,3cusft,nevuial,6,Sat Jul 11 17:56:03 2015 UTC,Nope. Paint never affected resale value and never will.

gtaglitches,3cusft,Pwilson44,8,Sat Jul 11 18:25:17 2015 UTC,Well I'm afraid you just wasted your money and time on this. Paint never affected resale value.

There are some in the eastern industrial part of the city  And I'm pretty sure near where the survival is on the hillside nearby.  Also, I'm fairly certain this requires that two players be present as it seems to be a prop-render-cohesion glitch.  No matter how much I shot it with a hydra and tank alone, it would not budge... as soon as my friends show up it moves."

gtaglitches,3cszk3,SkyKing1776,6,Fri Jul 10 15:39:24 2015 UTC,I'd say this was 99.99% discovered while attempting to get a variation of a dupe glitch working.
gtaglitches,3cszk3,UrisLuckyPainting,2,Fri Jul 10 18:55:54 2015 UTC,Think it's just based on randomness. Looking for a certain glitch can lead to others :)
gtaglitches,3cszk3,nevuial,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:48:14 2015 UTC,This happened to me by mistake a while ago. Had a guy with a rocket launcher shoot me and nothing happened. Once I realized my car wouldn't explode I just parked in front of him. I could tell he was confused

Edit: Alright, so the way I did it was, you get a friend, head to Eclipse Towers, open the impromptu race menu, set destination to Vinewood sign, and try to drive into your garage at the same time you set the location. You'll know you did it right if the menu is still up as you're in the cutscene. While you're in the cutscene, quickly invite your friend/players in range to the race, and they accept it, and you start it. Once you spawn outside of the garage, DON'T MOVE until it finishes counting down. After that, car should be indestructible. This was tested on the 360, yesterday afternoon"

gtaglitches,3cnfyp,SkyKing1776,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:38:28 2015 UTC,"Thanks, that's probably it. I'm trying every now and then while doing some missions and stuff anyway but not going to lose too much sleep over it if I can't get them!  (Will certainly come back and post here if it works though.)"

gtaglitches,3cnfyp,tank5239,8,Thu Jul 9 22:35:04 2015 UTC,"from Wiki; There are two additional beer hats that were available by either glitching, using modding tools, or if proceeded by an unusual combination of circumstances. A red one for ""J's Lager"" (the ""'s"" is not included in the logo) and a lime-colored one for ""Blarney's"". These are considered among the most rare of wearable items in Online."

gtaglitches,3cnfyp,MoHashAli,2,Thu Jul 9 12:06:16 2015 UTC,"I've collected quite a bit of crates too, most of them drop t-shirts, but I've only ever received 1 hat, no masks or other clothing items yet. If you bought a independence day outfit that included a hat (I think they all come with a hat) then you should have unlocked the special hats option."

gtaglitches,3cnfyp,kayzerzoze,1 point,Thu Jul 9 10:31:44 2015 UTC,I think most people are saying you need to do a mission first. Pier pressure and titan of a job have been mentioned but I doubt it makes a difference. I personally just happened to be looking at hats and I noticed a star next to special hats and sure enough I had 3 beer hats available that I didn't already have.

But my secondary character which is a female doesn't have the option to buy them. My male is rank 123 and my female is 78. They both have the special hats section and have both gotten a special crate before, none of which have been beer hats. Is there a rank difference here or something else? I want both characters to have them  EDIT: Doing a mission unlocked them for me :)"
gtaglitches,3cnfyp,HardHandle,1 point,Thu Jul 9 10:57:08 2015 UTC,What mission you did and did you bought them while in the mission or after? Edit: I started A titan Of the Job and after 2 minutes i came out from the job and beer hats was unlocked to me.
gtaglitches,3cnfyp,SlyCooper1324,2,Thu Jul 9 11:49:02 2015 UTC,Did you quit the job straight into a session? Was it Public? Thanks
gtaglitches,3cnfyp,1130ec,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:11:48 2015 UTC,Yea i think any job works. I played deathmatches earlier that day as my guy character which unlocked them. No idea if Rockstar purposely put these in...

gtaglitches,3co5j1,Snake_____86,6,Thu Jul 9 14:15:55 2015 UTC,"Here's a video of my method, on PS4, which has nearly a 100% success rate. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi_T9jWNy7Q  Two notes:   Some cars give me trouble. The Penumbra, Futo and the Issi are the ones I can recall off the top of my head. As you can see in the video at one point I avoid one car and go out of my way to get a Dominator once I spot it, I've never failed an attempt with that car (around 5 times). The thing which seems to have the most effect on whether my attempt passes/fails is how I approach the garage door. I do so gently and slowly, softly pulling up to it until I'm touching it. Then, I hold R2 to spin wheels, let that happen for a few seconds, then accept the charge from Mors. I hold R2 until I'm in the garage.   I think this method works perfectly. I destroy the street car to make room, then since I'm in the garage when I get a star the cops spawn on foot at the station across the bridge and I have plenty of time to take the car I want to dupe, find a street car, blow up the dupe car, and be in the LS Customs before a police vehicle even spawns. I can fill an entire garage in no time at all with no worry of police getting on my tail and minimal driving (even when horrible driving slows me down)."
gtaglitches,3co5j1,dennisisspiderman,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:21:01 2015 UTC,Confirming that this method method is the only one that worked for me. PS4.
gtaglitches,3co5j1,SEEENRULEZ,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:16:15 2015 UTC,"I would assume so (well actually, you need one empty space so you can drive your street car into it).  You shouldn't have issues filling empty garage spaces though. Either grab a bunch of street cars from around the garage or just buy the rusty Karin Rebel multiple times ($3,000 from San Andreas Super Autos). I imagine most just buy the Rebels because the price doesn't mean much when you factor in how much your duplicated cars sell for. Even just shooting down a plane for Trevor makes up the cost of the 8 Rebels."
gtaglitches,3co5j1,dennisisspiderman,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:34:39 2015 UTC,Im doing it as you do in the video. But Im not getting the option to replace a car.
gtaglitches,3co5j1,ferrarimad01,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:49:39 2015 UTC,"It appears to have been hotfixed, though some are reporting it still working for them."
gtaglitches,3co5j1,dennisisspiderman,1 point,Fri Jul 10 08:39:21 2015 UTC,"No. As you may have seen already though, the dupe method appears fixed for most."
gtaglitches,3co5j1,dennisisspiderman,2,Fri Jul 10 20:42:45 2015 UTC,I think i'm 1/20. Did it once with a panto but then never again. I don't even know what i'm doing wrong. Will try it again in another session after work.
gtaglitches,3co5j1,xTris_Tan,2,Fri Jul 10 13:15:00 2015 UTC,"It is a timing thing, so it depends heavily on the amount of lag you have (the less the better). That's why it works better into an invite only session or in a private mission (you should be by yourself in both cases to get the minimum lag).  Basically you want to enter the garage exactly when your PV icon shows up on the minimap.  Try and make a regular claim without entering garage, and see how long it takes for the icon to show up. Then try and time your entry accordingly."
gtaglitches,3co5j1,nevuial,2,Fri Jul 10 20:43:20 2015 UTC,That sounds like a really good advice. Will try it later and give you some feedback. Thanks man!
gtaglitches,3co5j1,xTris_Tan,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:21:27 2015 UTC,"You're welcome, always happy to help if I can :)"

gtaglitches,3co5j1,DickSuckingGoat,0,Thu Jul 9 14:46:52 2015 UTC,"I'm done with these Panto type glitches, I've never gotten them to work."
gtaglitches,3co5j1,Snake_____86,2,Thu Jul 9 14:56:32 2015 UTC,It's because it has been hotfixed. I did it last night with all the success but now I also tried it again a while ago and it's not working anymore. It's patched. Sorry.
gtaglitches,3co5j1,swrklo,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:51:51 2015 UTC,"I tried it last night myself, and couldn't do it."
gtaglitches,3co5j1,Snake_____86,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:59:35 2015 UTC,"Yes, looks hotfixed. Fun while it lasted."
gtaglitches,3co5j1,staaaaaal,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:38:13 2015 UTC,I had trouble with this too because of the bullshit instructions that were around when I started doing it.  The things that helped me were using a garage with no entrance animation (unit 2 poplar) blowing up the panto by cooking a gernade inside it.  Making sure I see the blue circle at the garage before call MMI and then waiting for the circle to disappear before positioning my car near the door.  Position the street car with about enough space that a character could walk between your character and the door.  Start doing a burnout and let go of the brake (keep holding the gas) at the same time you click the button to claim your car.  Also make sure the street car isn't an suv or truck.  Works 9 out of 10 times for me now.
gtaglitches,3co5j1,hammerandfickle,6,Fri Jul 10 10:18:25 2015 UTC,they patched it
gtaglitches,3co5j1,whomedesi,3,Fri Jul 10 10:19:47 2015 UTC,Another tip is that for some reason if you have a wanted level it will completely cancel out the glitch and you'll end up just driving in the panto rather than replacing the street vehicle. Nice find by he way op ;).  Edit : you can call Lester if you get the cops  Edit2 : can anyone get it working right now can't seem to get it
gtaglitches,3co5j1,MrDerpinson,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:37:08 2015 UTC,"Well, that explains why it's been so hard. I've always been getting cops."
gtaglitches,3co5j1,Ragequitr2,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:11:36 2015 UTC,"No problems with being wanted here, 20/20 succes so far. Hitting the gas and accepting Mors works here every time (XB1)."
gtaglitches,3co5j1,staaaaaal,4,Fri Jul 10 13:31:36 2015 UTC,"I posted this as well as several other people in the comments of the post for the dupe the night it was posted. People wonder why they can't do the dupe correctly or find easier way to do things but never bother to read all the detailed TIPS and ADVICE posted in the comments. There's quite a few things that make this fail safe. And they're all in just a few comments in the original dupe thread. (Someone posted another one saying it was improved, but it wasn't. I also posted this in that one as well saying how you can go into the lobby of a mission and back out before you would even steal the car to go to MMI. The op said ""MMI really isn't that far."" But I guess he doesn't realize how quick going into a mission lobby and backing out is. One more thing: to avoid getting cops at all, just hold a grenade in your vehicle at any step in the dupe when you have to destroy a vehicle. No need to waste time calling Lester. Even if you didn't want to do that use the kill yourself option. Still faster than calling Lester. All this is posted in the ORIGINAL dupe thread by several people. Please folks, read. The less clutter of comments and threads on here the better. The whole reason no one noticed the advice and tips is because most people didn't bother to read them and it gets lost amongst all the same questions being asked over and over and over and over. Thanks folks."

gtaglitches,3co5j1,epikk_hunter,2,Thu Jul 9 17:27:13 2015 UTC,"Does it work on ps3?, I have been trying but the vehicle does not appear on the map after exiting the garage"
gtaglitches,3co5j1,NineduceXII,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:03:14 2015 UTC,Same. At this point I think it only works on PS4 and X1.
gtaglitches,3co5j1,d1g1t4lp3n3tr8r,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:39:27 2015 UTC,"Works on 360 like a boss, works 9/10 times. It's all about the timing.... Try Alta apartment... couldn't get it to work consistently anywhere else."
gtaglitches,3co5j1,TheLupus,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:45:04 2015 UTC,It does work on PS3. It's just very damn difficult to get the timing. But I can confirm it does work.
gtaglitches,3co5j1,DeathDiggerSWE,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:07:15 2015 UTC,"In my experience that's if I claim it slightly too late. If I drive in without getting the ""full garage"" message I've usually claimed it too soon. The timing is very difficult indeed."
gtaglitches,3co5j1,MaxMartello,2,Thu Jul 9 16:18:50 2015 UTC,"Its been fixed yeah, tried it a good few times and nothing, 2 other friends tried it and they are getting nothing either :/"
gtaglitches,3co5j1,i5score,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:46:24 2015 UTC,So are you saying we don't have to drive all the way to MMI?
gtaglitches,3co5j1,nevuial,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:17:13 2015 UTC,"Exactly. While requesting vehicle won't work, loading up a contact mission lobby and backing out does. You can also use this when you can't get your car delivered to you because of the mechanic cooldown timer."
gtaglitches,3co5j1,i5score,0,Thu Jul 9 20:09:00 2015 UTC,"Hmm, depending on your Internet connection it may just be easier to drive there or maybe to do what you previously said.  I also heard in a tutorial video that you could do the glitch in a mission so the Cops, 5-0's, dirty pigs, aka police don't come after you. Can you confirm this o.o (PettyTrolls)"
gtaglitches,3co5j1,nevuial,1 point,Fri Jul 10 09:57:19 2015 UTC,"I can confirm it works in a mission. Make sure to set the matchmaking to private and to be by yourself though (for lowest lag). BUT if you do that, you will have to go get your car at MMI (you obviously can't load a mission while already into one).  I personally find the loading contact mission and backing out to be easier 100% of the time. It saves time for actual playing instead of glitching IMO.  As for the cops, I don't mind them since I use my silenced heavy shotgun and they very rarely come after me (don't blow the car up, set it on fire and try to enter the garage, it will get destroyed, not blow up, and (bonus) you won't have to pay the insurance fee). Another option would simply be to blow yourself up with the car."
gtaglitches,3co5j1,i5score,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:52:25 2015 UTC,"You set it on fire with the gas tank correct?  I think I'll just stick without a mission, cops aren't that big of a deal. Where is your duping garage? (I'm on popular st)"
gtaglitches,3co5j1,nevuial,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:31:47 2015 UTC,"I set the car on fire by shooting at the hood with the silenced heavy shotgun. Gas has a too high chance of blowing the car up. EDIT : For the Panto shoot at the back, where the engine is.  I'm also at popular street but I read it can be done in any garage. Didn't test this."
gtaglitches,3co5j1,BrewWhy,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:38:20 2015 UTC,Does it work for motorcycles?
gtaglitches,3co5j1,SkyKing1776,2,Thu Jul 9 14:55:00 2015 UTC,Yes.   I just did it with the newest motorcycle  @ Unit 2 Popular street.   Pour gas around the bike Ignite the gas  Watch for the motorcycle to begin to smoke Quickly step through the flames and stand up the bike Hop off the bike and run away before for it explodes   After that proceed with the rest of the glitch.
gtaglitches,3co5j1,CrinklyFries,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:59:20 2015 UTC,You don't need to pour gas on the vehicle and set it on fire.  You can just toss a grenade and then drive close to it to blow up your vehicle and yourself.  Killing yourself also eliminates the potential of getting a wanted level.
gtaglitches,3co5j1,cmp2005,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:11:39 2015 UTC,what i found out is when ur about an inch or 2 from the garage door u hit that a button
gtaglitches,3co5j1,smacktalkymb,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:11:13 2015 UTC,"Another tip if this hasn't been posted. After you light the car on fire, get in it and get the message its destroyed. Run right into the garage after and that will keep you from dealing with the cops. Works most of the time. I run right in after and right back out of gargage. Hope this helps. Or just start the mission methd up and do it that way."
gtaglitches,3co5j1,HumanKumquat,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:40:37 2015 UTC,"If you're on a PS3, try doing it at an Alta St apartment. I had terrible luck (~5% at Popular St.) Bought an Alta apartment, and hit it nearly every time."
gtaglitches,3co5j1,J50GT,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:13:56 2015 UTC,even though alta has a garage animation?

gtaglitches,3co5j1,count_dynamo,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:48:59 2015 UTC,Apparently it was just patched :(

gtaglitches,3co5j1,count_dynamo,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:46:22 2015 UTC,"Nope, they catch on pretty quick now. Im a little pissed though, I found out about it last night but said to myself fuck-it I'm tired I'll figure it out tomorrow. Did it twice this morning with a Panto to practice then went to the gym, came back to do it properly and make some real cash only to find out its patched.  haha fuck"

gtaglitches,3c8auy,Kite_sunday,8,Sun Jul 5 21:21:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah I know it's pretty crazy how it can demolish any car. Just a little secret, the glitch also works with Furore GT with it still beating every car by a big distance :)"
gtaglitches,3c8auy,Kite_sunday,2,Sun Jul 5 21:27:48 2015 UTC,Furore GT eh? might need to upgrade. are these the only 2 cars that do this?
gtaglitches,3c8auy,Kite_sunday,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:33:16 2015 UTC,Yeah the Rapid GT & Furore GT work the best!!
gtaglitches,3c8auy,freeloader11,3,Sun Jul 5 21:36:00 2015 UTC,"Also, I only lowered the back."
gtaglitches,3c8auy,penisinthepeanutbttr,4,Mon Jul 6 00:25:59 2015 UTC,You lowered the back only and it worked fine.. Nice!!
gtaglitches,3c8auy,Kite_sunday,3,Mon Jul 6 13:02:13 2015 UTC,"That's funny, I did it last night and a friend of mine used the rapid gt and only had the second engine and a lower transmission and may not have even had the turbo. He destroyed my adder, osiris , zentorno and entity. The sad part is, he even started behind me about 5-8 car lengths the second time on each race and still beat my cars."
gtaglitches,3c8auy,jetbreaker,3,Mon Jul 6 19:41:32 2015 UTC,One of my favorite parts of GTA is lowering cars for aesthetics and for drifting. If rockstar patches lowering cars I'm going to blame you guys for ruining an awesome part of the game.
gtaglitches,3c8auy,LucidFlare,4,Sun Jul 5 23:56:22 2015 UTC,"I hear ya, one of the only things i like doing anymore.  car shows and what not."
gtaglitches,3c8auy,Kite_sunday,4,Mon Jul 6 00:16:30 2015 UTC,"So once you jump into a race and quit, the mod is permanent? Or do I have to do this everytime?  Also, if it is permanent, can I put on bullet proof wheels after?  I'm assuming the car is already fully modded from the customs shop."
gtaglitches,3c8auy,LucidFlare,2,Mon Jul 6 11:01:05 2015 UTC,"No the trick/glitch is not permanent, you have to lower the car every time but its no worries it only takes 30 seconds or so :)"
gtaglitches,3c8auy,ace559one,2,Mon Jul 6 12:58:11 2015 UTC,Mine has so far remained active. I've repaired mine and restarted my game. Does it only deactivate once in a race? I've even destroyed my Rapid and it still stayed on for me.
gtaglitches,3c8auy,LucidFlare,3,Mon Jul 6 14:26:00 2015 UTC,"no way.  Everytime your mechanic delivers it, he repairs it.  the GT is fast as is.  I have to do it everytime I get it."
gtaglitches,3c8auy,Kite_sunday,2,Mon Jul 6 15:17:13 2015 UTC,It has been staying for me. I tried racing my friends Adder after I destroyed it without touching it and it stayed for me. I still destroyed him in a race with it. I have no reason to lie. It has stayed on my Rapid for some reason then. I didn't know if it was permanent or not that's why I destroyed it to see if I'd need to do it again and I did not. I even repaired it at LS and changed to tires. Still active on mine.
gtaglitches,3c8auy,LucidFlare,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:25:39 2015 UTC,what console?

gtaglitches,3c8auy,Kite_sunday,-1,Mon Jul 6 15:35:08 2015 UTC,"XD I hope that's sarcasm, the nice kind I mean. I don't know why mine is still on my Rapid. The way I did it though if you're curious is I bought the Rapid GT (not the topless one). Then I did the glitch/mod. Afterwords I took it into LS and customized it. Bulletproof tires etc. That's it. Nothing more and it just stuck for me. :)"
gtaglitches,3c8auy,LucidFlare,-1,Mon Jul 6 18:59:51 2015 UTC,lowered it? then put BP tires on it? is the handling all wonky still? If this is true I will be excited.  You're a god because I always have to waste ammunition to lower my cars.  Also does the car look lowered at all after you have put bulletproof tires on it?
gtaglitches,3c8auy,jetbreaker,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:07:00 2015 UTC,"After I bought it I shot the rims where you need to in order to cause the bug to occur. Then I went to LS and I always start at the top and work my way down. So windows are last and tires usually right before them. So I know I lowered the suspension before putting BP tired on it. After I left LS though it still had the bug/mod on it and working. Then I went to race my friends Adder to test if it still had it and it destroyed it. It couldn't even keep up. Then I had him blow it up because me finding a new mod, I wanted to try it on other vehicles.   My Osiris did not work though. So I called MMI and recovered my Rapid GT. When I called it again it still beat my friends Adder. That's the events that happened the other night really. I hope I'm not forgetting anything though. I will message him to get on GTA with me real quick and we can try and confirm that it stays on. If it even does. I may have just gotten lucky or something. :)  :::EDIT:::  I am on PC by the way."

gtaglitches,3c8auy,FuckTheKarmaCops,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:14:32 2015 UTC,Just tried it. My friend did it and I did it with a second Rapid. Both times we destroyed them and they were still lowered/cambered. They both are still fast and the mod stayed on. We also did it with RV's. XD  It looks cool but no real difference. :P
gtaglitches,3c8auy,Kite_sunday,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:48:00 2015 UTC,Sounds good dude. Thanks.   So it's better not to put bullet proof tires? Since it has to be done each time.   What about in terms of customizing the car? That shouldn't be a problem right?
gtaglitches,3c8auy,FuckTheKarmaCops,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:38:43 2015 UTC,Yeah YOU MUST NOT add bulletproof tires but in terms of customizing there should be no problems :)

gtaglitches,3c8auy,GLichen,2,Mon Jul 6 06:19:50 2015 UTC,Unfortunately the slammed suspension will not keep and you will need to re-slam the vehicle everytime.

gtaglitches,3c8uzb,nevuial,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:12:30 2015 UTC,"Do a variation of the current solo dupe glitch.  Make sure your garage is full (instead of 9 cars) and that you have at least one free slot on the bike rack.  Instead of driving a street car while making the claim, ride a street bike (easier to do backwards).  If done correctly, when you ride your freshly claimed vehicle back inside, it will ask you to replace a car. The car you choose to replace at this point won't be lost, but will go to your bike rack and your street bike will be in its previous car slot. (use a car you don't care too much about to be on the safe side)  Note that nothing is duped, nothing is lost, you just switch a car with a bike  Now you have a mechanic-deliverable bicycle but its not insured (because it's a street bike).  Last step is to ride that street bike to another garage and switch it with a bought BMX (make sure the rack in that second garage is full).  All done, now your bought BMX is in a car slot so you can call for it and it's insured as well. (Sorry, no way to solo insure a colored street BMX AFAIK)  EDIT : Hotfixed as of now :("

However, they are not known to take away items purchased with the funds.   Buy every Pegasus vehicle that looks like it might be fun.  Buy three properties on both your primary and secondary characters.  Buy all the clothes and cars you want.  Then when you've bought everything you currently desire, buy as many high end cars as you can to store in your garage to sell later when you need cash...  The newest super car costs $2.2M and then sells unmodified for about  $1.3M.  Then watch R* take your leftover change :-)  Hope this helps."

Going to creator then invite only works but you need to move the cursor off invite only then back on before selecting. Always been like this. Putting a parachute on then removing is an alternative to changing glasses etc. Always saves afterwards!    I'll be trying this myself when I'm next in GTAO."

I had pretty much gave up on the smuggler planes as the first time I saw one I raced half way across the map and took it down with a homing launcher and thought that the 3k reward wasn't worth the effort. The second one I saw spawned fairly close so I though I might as well try again, but this time it crashed after I shot it with a homing rocket and I got no reward at all, so I haven't bothered with them since.  I didn't realise that the rewards stack or that you had to kill them mid air. I will probably make more of an effort to get them now."

I believe this is related to the fact that when ill gotten gains came out, everyones secondary character had their garages (including bike racks) shuffled around.   Basically, the cars that were on the bike rack are now in actual storage (where cars go when you downsize garages) and so whenever I free up space on the floor, one of them (at random) will return from storage.  All of the cars that I've gotten back are from the 2 bike racks that show empty in the vehicle management menu. Those same bike racks belong to the garages that got shuffled around (2 and 3), garage 1 still shows itself as being full of cars and I doubt I will get those back.   Again, this is on my secondary character; they are all ten car garages."
gtaglitches,3bq38p,SkyKing1776,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:25:01 2015 UTC,To pull a car off the bike rack:   Dupe a bicycle from a friend into a car spot. Ride the bike to your other garage (with the car on the rack) When you ride inside it will prompt you to swap the bike with a spot on the rack.   Whatever car you swap the bike with will be in the bikes car spot in the other garage.

gtaglitches,3b6ff7,divide_amuze,2,Sun Jun 28 10:38:49 2015 UTC,Probably. You get refunded the money when you back out of the mission and your stars return.  -$800 + $800 = $0 lost

I don't know what the hell is the major malfunction with rockstar and they don't either so they're trying to reimburse everything lost with in game cash value.

gtaglitches,3b66au,LongestNamePosible,2,Fri Jun 26 08:31:00 2015 UTC,I bougth the cargobob long ago using an already patched old glitch  where you just changed URL. May be you accidently accessed website where Roosevelt was thru some pattern of links.

gtaglitches,3b66au,Budborne,2,Sat Jun 27 11:36:18 2015 UTC,"It appears to have happened to  one of my friends as well. I mentioned that it happened and he asked where the Roosevelt is purchased from.

I asked him to check Legendary again for the listing and he said it was gone."
gtaglitches,3b66au,Budborne,2,Sun Jun 28 18:25:04 2015 UTC,Sometimes the jobs can affect some parts of GTA V online. Maybe only available on PC since its newer therefor containing more bugs.
gtaglitches,3b66au,SuperComputrix,-1,Mon Jun 29 01:10:20 2015 UTC,does your friend care to provide proof?
gtaglitches,3b66au,ChildishFears,2,Sun Jun 28 21:12:50 2015 UTC,Did you happen to save the URL of the page where you actually bought the Roosevelt? This is speculation and i already have this and the cargobob but with the cargobob glitch all you had to do was put in the right URL iirc. If someone is able to get on that page and tell others the URL i think its likely thats all you need to get a roosevelt at this time.
gtaglitches,3b66au,SandyJ8,2,Wed Jul 1 09:48:58 2015 UTC,Also just noticed yours is the spareless trunkless one. Im really interested because this looks better imo. Plus then ill have both so i can show off to nerds online :)
gtaglitches,3b66au,zeeeeera,4,Wed Jul 1 09:54:25 2015 UTC,Sadly it appears it didn't spawn with any of its extras (the two spare wheels & trunk). Though that may be due to the bug in general right now where cars ordered from sites lack all extras. (thus why the Casco currently only comes without a top when bought)
gtaglitches,3b66au,SandyJ8,5,Fri Jun 26 10:01:32 2015 UTC,"The one without the extras was kind of a big deal back on the Old gen Consoles, because you could only get it via Savegame Modding and then Sp/Mp glitch it."

Save just one for further glitches like this. That way you won't have to spend about $300k or more for all the upgrades again and you can still use that car for the glitches. I saved mine from the last cargoboob/tracker glitch and I was still able to use it for this one. Just saying... You might save some money and it's only one garage space ; )"
gtaglitches,3b52ou,DramDemon,9,Mon Jun 29 09:10:32 2015 UTC,This is an incredibly simple glitch once you get it down. I'm at a point where I can store a car a minute. Far more efficient than any previous panto glitch.
gtaglitches,3b52ou,SupaDawg,2,Fri Jun 26 08:08:07 2015 UTC,A car a minute? How? After duping and quitting the mission I always spawn at the alien weed plaza (in SP where Michael shoots aliens) and have to drive back to my apartment.
gtaglitches,3b52ou,DramDemon,7,Sat Jun 27 03:04:20 2015 UTC,"Very strange. My process after getting into MP with the SP phonewas as follows (filled 2.5 garages on each character so I'm  done).    pull fully modded car into garage and back out don't move car from the spot it exited the garage from pull up any mission (or call for one first)  quickly launch into the mission mission begins pull car a bit forward back into the garage. Dupe is now stored.  exit the garage pull up phone and quit mission you should spawn on the street outside your garage near your car pull that car into the garage, immediately driving it back out start again    Even calling for missions each time as I pull the car in, I can still do it quicker than 1/min"
gtaglitches,3b52ou,freeloader11,2,Sat Jun 27 04:54:44 2015 UTC,"Interesting, maybe it was because I was quitting the mission while inside my garage instead of walking out. Thanks for the help!"

gtaglitches,3b52ou,bluemtndew,3,Fri Jun 26 06:49:16 2015 UTC,"I've noticed that if you do this and replace a car in your garage with a dupe, you won't spawn into the solo session with your original car. It teleports back to the garage.   This isn't a big issue but if you've duped the car a few times and can't figure out which car is the original one in your garage just press the button that shows the player list. It'll show the car stats and if it's insured or not. The car that is insured is the original. The dupes won't be."

gtaglitches,3b52ou,SupaDawg,3,Fri Jun 26 23:45:33 2015 UTC,Works like a charm on PS4.  Anyone else notice that none of the duplicates are insured?
gtaglitches,3b52ou,jamesjwalking,4,Sat Jun 27 12:31:16 2015 UTC,Dupes are uninsured as the game considers them street cars.

gtaglitches,3b52ou,Thatcrazylemur,3,Sat Jun 27 20:59:24 2015 UTC,"Can confirm it works on PC as well. One big thing to keep in mind. This glitch gets weird if you are in first person. The phone animation breaks when you get online and everything is invisible, and eventually it just stops working, and even stuff like your menu and weapon wheel don't work. So stay in 3rd person while doing this glitch"
gtaglitches,3b52ou,amvdsande,1 point,Sun Jun 28 16:56:26 2015 UTC,That'd be because in SP your phone shows up in the character's hand and not as part of the HUD. It must be trying to load all the SP animations and they're blocked in online.

I sold one more car and thought I'd give this glitch a shot despite seeing reports about the hotfix. I exited a public server I just connected to and left Online. Spawned as Trevor and immediately went to Creator, loaded my saved TDM, tested it,  saved it, and joined a Solo Session. And now my 6 empty spots are filled with 6 shiny gold Schwartzers worth $182,655. FYI, the GTA V Application was never closed.  I'm going to try something with my ethernet and closing the application and report back after I sell and replace one more car.  EDIT: Attempt failed. I put my PS4 in Rest Mode, disconnected the ethernet, closed and reopened GTA V, and loaded into Story Mode, plugged ethernet back in.

gtaglitches,3b52ou,Actor117,1 point,Sat Jun 27 17:31:45 2015 UTC,You have to use the current dupe method to get one in the spot then you can use this glitch to get more into spots... you can use them to get cars off your bike rack from the previous glitch if you have any stuck there.

gtaglitches,3b52ou,Thatcrazylemur,1 point,Sun Jun 28 00:36:23 2015 UTC,"My Ubermacht Zion Cabrio fully modded sells for $175K  You can just buy one off the internet and mod it, it doesn't have to be found on the street."
gtaglitches,3b52ou,boblo1121,2,Sun Jun 28 01:51:23 2015 UTC,"Right, I was confused but this has cleared it up for me (I think).  So it doesn't actually need to be a street car, it just has to be one that you could find on the street?  If so, the Truffade Felon would be just about the best to use because that costs 90k."
gtaglitches,3b52ou,SkyKing1776,2,Mon Jun 29 11:53:49 2015 UTC,You got it.
gtaglitches,3b52ou,boblo1121,1 point,Mon Jun 29 12:06:41 2015 UTC,Oh fuck yeah. I already have a Felon on my main character. I needed to make space for my Osiris anyway.

gtaglitches,3b52ou,SkyKing1776,1 point,Sun Jun 28 22:29:01 2015 UTC,"Yes,  you can use one you bought online to duplicate.  It does not bypass the 48 minute wait though...  As the title of the glitch says... we are ""fooling the star""  We are fooling Rockstar into believing the duplicates are just normal modded street cars we found while playing rather than a car you already own."

Sadly, my character with lots of garage space is only level 30ish so I can't fully upgrade a street car but mine still sell for about $135k.  Filled up every spot she had in her garages that werent already filled with Pantos from the last easy glitch, and the Armoured Kuruma that I glitched from my character 1."
gtaglitches,3b52ou,amvdsande,1 point,Sun Jun 28 09:29:12 2015 UTC,I can't upgrade engine and other things because I need to win 50 LTS races? Is there a car that doesn't need this? I'm level 105 and won the races needed for normal upgrades.

gtaglitches,3b52ou,DramDemon,2,Fri Jun 26 01:49:36 2015 UTC,For me at least it says I have $0 when I go to websites and won't let me buy vehicles. Interestingly enough though it let me buy a stock.

gtaglitches,3b52ou,bluemtndew,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:41:32 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, I hadn't actually seen that until you said. I tried it about 2 hours ago and couldn't sell in solo sessions. But it would be irrelevant anyway as the entire of the game knows you have your actual online cash except for the internet and ATMs. The internet and ATMs think you are Michael, and have however much money he has, except for the vehicle dealers which think you have $0.   It's frustrating but I guess it's part of when Rockstar fixed it last time - they just made sure you couldn't buy anything even if you could get onto the 'wrong' internet.  (I have no idea why the Cargobob isn't buyable now anyway - FFS, if anything is going to break the game, it's not going to be a helicopter which can only be used to make some missions a tiny bit easier at most and can't troll anyone with any more than you can with explosives. But it's too much fun for GTA Online I suppose, and people having fun outside of the controlled confines set by Rockstar is considered a Bad Thing.)"
gtaglitches,3b52ou,SEEENRULEZ,2,Fri Jun 26 15:50:48 2015 UTC,"Damn, I was actually looking forward to getting the cargobob too since I missed out on it way long ago when it was available. It definitely won't break the game, but then Rockstar wouldn't be controlling the situation and they must be scared about that."
gtaglitches,3b52ou,Black_Sunshin1e,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:57:17 2015 UTC,Have you tried making money with the stock?

gtaglitches,3b52ou,bluemtndew,1 point,Fri Jun 26 08:41:16 2015 UTC,"This is the strangest glitch I have ever seen.  Also, if you dont have all of the upgrades unlocked yet, but you have iFruit, you can use this to buy some of them (you still have to pay for the upgrades)  When you drive the dupe in the garage, in order to stay in a solo session I kill myself and then vote for freemode. Sometimes when I choose new session it puts me in a public session and I lose the SP phone. EDIT: Or I suppose you could just quit the mission...  Hope I could I help."
gtaglitches,3b52ou,SupaDawg,3,Fri Jun 26 06:05:13 2015 UTC,You shouldn't have to find a new session. Just quit out of the mission using the phone and you're good to go.
gtaglitches,3b52ou,uberduger,1 point,Fri Jun 26 14:41:41 2015 UTC,You can do that? I feel so... Dumb.
gtaglitches,3b52ou,SEEENRULEZ,2,Fri Jun 26 18:01:25 2015 UTC,No worries. I was trying everything I could to make the glitch as quick as possible. If you use the mission quit and leave the original car outside the garage you can get down to less than 1 min per car.
gtaglitches,3b52ou,uberduger,2,Fri Jun 26 18:24:14 2015 UTC,"Alright, thanks for telling me.  EDIT: Wait, you DELETE THE JOB? How are you supposed to figure that out?!"
gtaglitches,3b52ou,T3STI,3,Fri Jun 26 18:53:18 2015 UTC,haha. I've used the same technique to quit jobs in the past. It's definitely not at all intuitive to go into the jobs icon on the phone.  Not sure how I first found it to be honest.
gtaglitches,3b52ou,bluemtndew,1 point,Fri Jun 26 22:48:39 2015 UTC,"Have now tried a number of times to buy Pegasus vehicles using this (namely the Cargobob). Not working so far.  When I try to buy it, it says I have insufficient funds, and shows $0. However, it still shows me as having >$2.2m on the pause menu. And Michael has well over $2.2m as well. When I go to the online banking app, it welcomes me as Michael and shows my transactions. I then went and tried to sell some stocks but I still have $0, even though the banking app then shows me the record of the sale!   Anyone got any bright ideas?   EDIT: Really, really weirdly, the selling and buying of shares has affected my single player game. Changed to Michael and the purchases actually went thru for him! How odd."

If someone can figure out how to maintain the existence of the dupe I will post this new method. As of right now the vehicle duplicates but disappears when anything is altered.

Why not tell us your method so more people can try to figure out how to keep the duped car... OP doesn't know what caused it so you are on your own till then.

Also they told you on their official support page about the double tapping way which you have mentioned.  https://support.rockstargames.com/hc/en-us/articles/205707048-Inability-to-Stack-Props-in-the-GTAV-Creator-after-Title-Update-1-27

gtaglitches,3awtxd,GTAthrowawayaccount,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:49:48 2015 UTC,why stack props when u can build in air ?  press the LEFT or RIGHT stick to move the object INTO the air.
gtaglitches,3awtxd,T3DDY173,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:05:23 2015 UTC,To build large protective barriers... like to give a protective area for teams to get vehicles in a LTS... amongst other things I'm sure... like super ramp building.

gtaglitches,3awtxd,GTAthrowawayaccount,1 point,Fri Jun 26 22:09:30 2015 UTC,Rockstar fully intended the switch glitch in creator mode. It wasn't an accident. Not the dlc breakage one but when released. If that switch glitch didn't exist. There would be no possible way to do loops or wallride or tornados or any of that crazy stunt stuff. Also GTA would be dead by now too. So the switch glitch wasn't an accident. It was fully intended by rockstar. As only a few.no.the ago it was figured out how to.create vertical spirals. So 2 years on from the release of GTA we creators are still finding new ways to. Create. Which was fully intended by Rockstar
gtaglitches,3awtxd,DavidJamesMathie2013,0,Wed Jul 1 12:06:17 2015 UTC,Yeah but they should put it back as the new one is a complete pain in the ... I'm with ccc. Nothing new for me until they fix it.  And they better do it soon or people will leave this game

gtaglitches,3au12c,SkyKing1776,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:50:42 2015 UTC,I can go to a mask shop with my cop hat and get a tshirt mask and other but it wont let me get a bandanna with the cop hat. Is there a way?
gtaglitches,3au12c,nile1212,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:19:26 2015 UTC,Assuming you already have the cop hat...   Use the above glitch to put the cop hat onto a second outfit and save the outfit. Apply the bandana mask to the outfit you want to combine with the cop hat and save that outfit. Finally do the glitch again to put the cop hat back onto the original outfit with the bandana.
gtaglitches,3au12c,SkyKing1776,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:56:03 2015 UTC,Thanks I will try this.

Just because they 'work'? Or have you actually done some analysis of your own? If you tested in a VM, be aware that it queries the VirtualBox host adapter IP to determine if it's being executed inside a virtual environment and probably disables itself at that point to avoid detection.  Programs can 'work' but still steal your data just FYI. This program does a lot of things that are not normal behavior for this type of program and it is very, very suspicious. Some of those behaviors include various methods to circumvent anti-virus detection software. Other behaviors are just blatantly malware-esque such as stealing info from web browsers, modifying registry keys, scanning all network connections, tampering with windows system libraries, modifying windows folders, starting up the Remote Access service, and quite a bit more which has yet to be fully analysed."

When GTA V was originally released on consoles (last gen) I remember seeing videos of this gate glitch and it would do the same thing as the swingset glitch from gta IV, except it would throw your car much further, sometimes across the entire map.  What you are seeing in the current version is the patched version of it that no longer does this, but just damages your car instead."

gtaglitches,3ab18n,TheFucknards,3,Thu Jun 18 18:48:41 2015 UTC,Was there really any need to post this link? He used the word in a correct manner.
gtaglitches,3ab18n,produktr,-5,Fri Jun 19 03:07:41 2015 UTC,Did I ever say he didn't? I've never heard the word (not my native language) and perhaps just helped people googeling the word by placing a link.  Not that big of a deal is it?
gtaglitches,3ab18n,iLL3R,3,Fri Jun 19 09:27:01 2015 UTC,"I brought it to the LSC and it had no paint job but the maximum performance upgrades.   Did the Adder it replaced have full upgrades? How about your original Mesa?   The osiris duping after you bought it is a 1.27 bug. Happened to me as well. Don't try selling either of them otherwise you'll lose both. You need to close and restart the game a few times for it to return back to normal.  Rockstar claimed they patched the issue with a hotfix a few days ago, but maybe their 'fix' screwed things up even more which is why this happened to your Mesa."

I had a car replace another car in my garage, like what happened with your Adder, and the performance mods + xenon were transferred over just the same. When I switched sessions, everything was still the same but when I got off for a few hours then started the game back up again, everything had returned to normal.  I'd be interested to know whether or not you keep that Merryweather Mesa since it's not a normal model."

gtaglitches,3a1bcz,Glasweg1an,1 point,Tue Jun 16 14:01:40 2015 UTC,Work on chrome?
gtaglitches,3a1bcz,mr1jon2,2,Tue Jun 16 16:45:43 2015 UTC,"No. You can do crew color + chrome though.  Just buy chrome paint then buy crew paint. No need to buy license plate or any of that.  Make your own crew and you can change the crew color to whatever you like and as often as you like. Once you paint a car, you can change the crew color and your existing paintjobs won't change/update to the new color."

gtaglitches,3a1bcz,iLL3R,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:39:03 2015 UTC,Can you do crew color in matte paint? The selection of matte paints is really limited and I want to make a crew with a nice color to have as matte!

gtaglitches,3a1bcz,iLL3R,5,Tue Jun 16 13:49:54 2015 UTC,You don't have to wait 2-3 seconds once you go into metallic.

gtaglitches,3a1bcz,Erdo4,2,Tue Jun 16 14:56:12 2015 UTC,"Betters question is, can we combine pearls with crew colors again, and have the same type of paint (not color) applied? Basically I mean applying a pearl to a metal such as gold or brushed black steel, and end up with hot pink brushed black steel, then put on a crew color like a blue and end up with a hot pink pearl with blue and the same shine as brushed black steel."
gtaglitches,3a1bcz,LettersTheFalse,2,Tue Jun 16 22:05:38 2015 UTC,That has been patched shortly before the next gen release. Source: I still have cars with brushed solid gold + pitch black crew color + ice white pearlescent which results in a dark matte chrome of sorts. They carried over from PS3 to PS4. Looks like this: http://imgur.com/a/FKITh  Don't get me started on how much it sucks that they removed it. Screwing around with the color combinations was my favourite thing to do back then.

gtaglitches,39xf0x,Countdown216,1 point,Sat Jun 27 11:57:44 2015 UTC,How do they all figure out how to cheat so fast?
gtaglitches,39xf0x,vesko18,3,Tue Jun 16 20:05:40 2015 UTC,"It is not about cheating, it is about that rockstar allows them to. First of all - the engine is the same as GTA4/Max Payne 3 - with a little work all of their cheats worked in GTA 5 in about 2 weeks after release.   Second - they use the same shitty p2p system from x360/ps3 (not to talk that even those systems are hacked to shit and their cheats are already converted to PC) which means that whatever you do on your PC is what is sent to the server.  And third - there is a program called Cheat Engine, which is a memory scanning tool. It is an awesome software and an invaluable tool for modding all kinds of games(very important - in singleplayer!), but due to rockstar's lack of care - it is possible to use it online. In any other game you would be straight banned if you even tried to launch it during multiplayer."
gtaglitches,39xf0x,Valcorb,5,Sun Jun 28 19:16:56 2015 UTC,So I'm lucky then? I've never encountered a modded lobby yet on PC.

gtaglitches,39xf0x,atomsk404,10,Mon Jun 15 20:10:58 2015 UTC,"i fail to see the point in highlighting that bit of information.   is it to mean that because you are a mod of this sub, you are correct? I disagree. It's one thing to exploit the game in order to make yourself look cooler when playing the game...a totally different one to use cheats that prevent you from dying, when that affects other peoples gameplay. I'm not one to complain about getting huge stacks of cash dropped on me...whatever, I'll go spend it. But if I am in a lobby and some dude comes up on me and starts getting owned, then goes god mode in order to put my KD in the dirt, you bet your ass I'll go passive and report them. I also think thats the lowest form of players - worse than bitches who go passive and follow you around waiting for a chance to get out and get a quick kill.   is it a threat of a ban for ""talking back""? go ahead, i can still read the content all i want. It will be somewhat annoying that I can't comment on a thread that piques my interest but I wont loose sleep over it.  Edit: And I'm banned"
gtaglitches,39xf0x,boogieidm,-22,Mon Jun 15 20:12:59 2015 UTC,"It's not a threat of a ban, it's a ban for reporting players in any form. Check out the rules."
gtaglitches,39xf0x,jamesjwalking,2,Mon Jun 15 20:27:14 2015 UTC,"Actually Mr. Moderator Sir, the rules state ""users"" not ""players"", implying that it's only against the rules to report users of this specific sub when they admit to glitching and post their GT's here. Why would we get ban from here if we report a hacker in game?"
gtaglitches,39xf0x,boogieidm,-13,Mon Jun 15 21:03:11 2015 UTC,"The rule states to not even discuss reporting here. It doesn't matter what terminology the sidebar uses, it's not a contract. We don't tolerate reporting of any kind. You do things that others would report for just like god moders do things that people here don't like. We don't discriminate. This is a sub for glitchers that don't need to worry about being reported. If you report one person, you may report another. No tolerance."

gtaglitches,39xf0x,Sbarrtacus,24,Mon Jun 15 23:11:14 2015 UTC,"This doesn't really mention glitches. It only talks about modifying game files, mods, and using cheating programs. We're not tampering with the game in any way, we're just using how the game works to our advantage."
gtaglitches,39xf0x,bigdwb1024,14,Mon Jun 15 21:07:23 2015 UTC,"Sure, but rockstar also said that they would only remove 'harmful glitches' and removed The Lost slamvan and the Monkey Blista, and changed the Sovereign's color (for those who changed it) none of these seem harmful in any way, they still did it, it's hard to believe what rockstar says anymore since they have such a way to twist words."

gtaglitches,39xf0x,Daerados,2,Mon Jun 15 16:31:00 2015 UTC,I think it would increase the flow if they just offered these things for sale.

gtaglitches,39xf0x,soultare,1 point,Tue Jun 16 15:39:47 2015 UTC,"And for as far as I'm concerned ""glitching"" typically is safe depending who your around and what you doing. Money glitches can be safe if done with caution. But a ""glitch"" in the game probably won't do anything with this new system unless you keep doing right after another."
gtaglitches,39xf0x,gnorty,1 point,Mon Jun 15 18:41:27 2015 UTC,Okay so this means its potential for them to try and track people who use Charles webproxy so might wanna keep a thought about that before doing it
gtaglitches,39xf0x,soultare,2,Mon Jun 15 22:36:48 2015 UTC,yes. charles is exactly the sort of thing they are looking for.
gtaglitches,39xf0x,iLL3R,2,Mon Jun 15 16:36:23 2015 UTC,Yup so everybody trying to do patriot tire smoke you might wanna watch out especially if your trying to modify special vehicles. Just in general people should be aware what might happen
gtaglitches,39xf0x,GTAthrowawayaccount,1 point,Mon Jun 15 17:36:22 2015 UTC,"While you're technically correct, they would still probably classify some forms of glitching as 'cheating' since you would be exploiting bugs in the game to gain an unfair advantage.  In the latest patch, Rockstar added new stats to track glitchers/exploiters, including a stat to monitor how many cars you're selling, your 'exploit level' history(?) and a stat to classify repeat offenders (high/low grades)."
gtaglitches,39xf0x,GTAthrowawayaccount,1 point,Mon Jun 15 21:58:39 2015 UTC,"My guess is that they'll be spectating the highest offenders to find glitches before they reach the public. That way, if a glitch is released to the public, they might be already prepared to track the users, and give them one of these exploit offenses on their log... right before they implement the fix. tinfoil. over and outer space."
gtaglitches,39xf0x,EB_Creations,9,Mon Jun 15 21:54:15 2015 UTC,"I think that if the modders were just put in a specialized cheater's pool and allowed to mod all they wanted, that they might actually enjoy it if it became populated enough. Let them play how they want to play, but keep them from the clean players that want to play clean. Of course reserve some actions to be automatic console bans like the jerk that messed up my internet connection when I spoke my mind, but if they just had a safe outlet for those that wanted to mod online, they might just have more sales. They could even sponsor mods. Have an outlet to submit mods and if they make the cut, sell them for (insert reasonable price here) each and give the creators a percentage of each sale. win win. Modders will persist. Rockstar might as well find a way to turn a profit from it. Obviously there's a large enough percentage of their clients that want mods bad enough to go about it the wrong way. If a right way was created and sold, it would likely draw in quite a crowd and significant revenue if it were done in an organized manner. That's just my 2 cents in 3 minutes on a game that made 1 billion dollars in 3 days."

gtaglitches,39xf0x,DyLaNzZpRo,0,Mon Jun 15 23:30:07 2015 UTC,I don't think this is gonna stop people. When I move to PC I'm probably still gonna mod the game. It actually kinda makes me want to not buy it on PC. I know how much of a pain it is to grind money in the bloody game and not being able to mod that because they are too focused on their shark cards rather than the players experience makes me not want to buy it again. People will say but they are focusing on the players. That's just a cover up IMO. Their main focus is to milk all of the money they can out of the game.

gtaglitches,39xf0x,BL4CKBOi,1 point,Tue Jun 16 05:59:51 2015 UTC,No I'm talking about the money side only. Fucking around with other players is complete crap. That is shit. But it's PC so you've got to expect some sort of thing like that with a game that is so popular. As long as there is ways to mod the game and a demand for it there are gonna be people modding the game. In this instance there is a demand and a way. The money shouldn't be done the way rockstar have done it. It's a game for God sakes it is meant to be enjoyable but the game is utter crap without money. Now just for extra clarification (because I wasn't very clear the first time) I am only talking about the money side. I agree that rockstar should get rid of people fucking others shit but they money glitches and mods are the only way to have an enjoyable time in the game. I guess that's why people mod. They have no money so they want to ruin others experiences because theirs is ruined too. It is a dick of a thing to do.

gtaglitches,39z432,153Skyline,1 point,Tue Jun 16 21:10:38 2015 UTC,I don't think they did... I can still do the full first person glitch at the pier but now when you leave you are no longer in passive.

No cars were there. Changed spawn to last location and made sure I was outside. Will continue to test, did actually work on PS3"
gtaglitches,39unv8,Gmz78,3,Mon Jun 15 01:36:11 2015 UTC,Got it to work on ps3 after a few attempts.  Wont work on a wireless connection for me had to hook an Ethernet into the console. Only did 1 -10 car garage on main and 1-10 car on lvl 6. Make sure to change your spawn location to last point instead of garage.
gtaglitches,39unv8,TF34,2,Mon Jun 15 16:14:51 2015 UTC,Also confirming for PS3. Unfortunately I got network errored into story mode after doing the drive in/out of garage on only one of my garages (sadly it was my bike garage not my high-end one) and it had only saved the vehicles from that garage once I managed to get back into online. Still made a little over a mil.

gtaglitches,39unv8,GeneralJustice,2,Mon Jun 15 18:36:04 2015 UTC,It's a constant repeat I believe. It's difficult.
gtaglitches,39unv8,GeneralJustice,2,Mon Jun 15 18:51:42 2015 UTC,"Can you clarify? Are you saying it's not possible to replicate the glitch immediately after selling the cars (like the previous duplicate garage glitch)?

gtaglitches,39unv8,Gmz78,2,Mon Jun 15 19:14:04 2015 UTC,You need a new one every time I believe.
gtaglitches,39unv8,Gmz78,3,Mon Jun 15 19:56:44 2015 UTC,You do need a new character every time. All up about 1-1.5 hours worth of work. But you get anywhere between 4-10 mil per hour including sell time

This way you only need to purchase 1 garage. It'll dupe the cars in your first garage. Only cars bought online (no street cars) - Steps 10 to 12 are not needed, just sell all the cars at step 9  Repeating glitch   Once all your cars for your 2nd character have been sold. Ensure you haven't done step 10-12    Choose swap character > select your main character. It should still ask you to ""alter apperance"". At this point unplug/disconnect internet. This should send you back to single player Reconnect internet/modem, sign back in From single player, select choose character Select your main character > answer ""Yes"" to alter apperance > Back out without saving Select your 2nd character   Presto, all your cars have been respawned"

gtaglitches,39unv8,_Trilobite_,2,Mon Jun 15 04:41:29 2015 UTC,Turn it off. Wait until the game figures out you're not online. Then it'll kick you back into gtaV single player. Then you reconnect your modem/internet

gtaglitches,39unv8,UnlimitedEra,1 point,Mon Jun 15 07:16:13 2015 UTC,You need to buy 3 garages with the 2nd character. I bought the 3 garages near unit 2 popular. 10 car garages. About $350k

Suppose you just need to match whatever your original character has. Same amount of cars to the same slot. So if your second apartment/garage has 10 cars, don't put a 6 car garage as the second one. Probably will work, but only 6 cars will dupe. Maybe even the empty stops. For the sake of an extra 100k. Just buy 10 car garages. First time around I made 4 mil with just a couple super cars, insurgent, kumura & a few other mid range cars. Second time around after using that 4 mil to purchase more top end, I made about 6 mil Cars off the street have a 48 min wait. Cars bought don't have a wait to sell.  It also dupes your pegasses vehicles"

I bought 3 apartments and suddenly that cars appeared.  I've always wondered what I exactly did to make this happen and I think I probably done something like this without even knowing.

You can up the chances of it spawning by having someone else who owns one to drive around in it but it still takes a long time to get it to spawn. If you desperately want one, play a mission that takes place between those times and just go driving around LSC instead of doing the mission until time runs out, then let the mission fail and quick restart to try again. One of my friends who transferred from 360 to PC got both a chrome and a gold dubsta2 to spawn on PC 2 weeks ago.    The Sentinel XS isn't the most valuable, but it is definitely the most consistent spawning rare/modded car."

I can fill my whole garage up with them in 2-3 mins. Once you get the first yellow sentinel, drive it into your garage and back out to spawn a blue one.  The yellow one is better at spawning other rare modded cars than the blue one I've found so try driving one of those around instead of the blue. Also, do it in an invite only session, they spawn more consistently than in an open lobby."

I got to the point of being able to remove the forward cap with the motorcycle helmet glitch and now i'm left with the sunglasses and bandana, i just can't put on the fedora   Anybody know how?"
gtaglitches,39uvcq,SkyKing1776,3,Mon Jun 15 12:01:49 2015 UTC,Not too hard... just did it on a new character to confirm.  Setup:    In the interaction menu set a default helmet and turn auto show bike helmet to on. (Inventory> accessories> helmets> select any helmet and press square then at the bottom of that menu turn auto show on) Have access to a motorcycle (owned or street either will work)   Steps:   Save an outfit with the bandana you want Put on the hat you want to glitch to the saved outfit Sit on the bike and wait for your character to put on the default helmet Open the interaction menu and go to the saved outfit Press down to hover over glasses Get off the bike Press up to the outfit and select it   You will then see your character take off the helmet and the new hat will appear on the saved outfit.  Hope this helps.

It requires you to have unlocked the chrome rims for free award (50 heist setups)   The VIP chrome suv rims adds 7K to the sell value of the car.  - Buy rebel for 3K - add free SUV VIP Chrome rims  - sell car for 10K  Bypasses the 45min wait time.

gtaglitches,39otsk,J57F,5,Sat Jun 13 09:06:13 2015 UTC,This works on consoles too if players lag themselves out of lobbies. I'm using a neighbors really slow net so all I have to do is pretty much load a couple YouTube videos and it'll drop me from the lobby and I don't have to worry about other players. Players with much faster connections have been using programs like xlag and other net spamming methods to drop themselves into their own lobby when the special crate is announced. I know your method is different but I wanted people to know they can do something similar with lagging themselves out of sessions for console users. I've only done it once and got the shirt I wanted. (Fake dix)

I'd keep trying but I've got to go to work.  I've noticed some things that might help...  It really seems to be about timing once again.   I believe you need to accept the first message screen the moment before the garage door sound.  If you accept it too early and you'll see yourself exit the rebel in the garage and spawn back inside.  If you accept it after the sound has started, it's too late and you'll spawn outside in the rebel. (sometimes invisible for a time, sometimes not)   Tips:   To get the pause/gas timing right, Hold down the pause button and then press the gas when you release it. If you take a car from your garage outside then go back inside to the rebel, the car you have outside will reappear in the garage when you get the pause/gas timing right. (This gives you a visual cue rather than having to check the game store)   I hope this helps someone to get this working on PS4, I would love to see a confirmation before I get back home to try again.  Good luck everyone!"

Anyone found a reliable work around or solution?  UPDATE: I was able to clear the error by attempting to join my friend's invite only session without an invite... it gave me the error message and then put me back into a different session. I was then able to send and receive invites on both characters.   Don't ask me why it worked but it did and if you have this issue it might work for you too.

Once you get inside the Rebel and wait for it to start, hurry and hit options then immediately hit R2. You will hear the engine rev for a second then the pause menu will appear.  The playstation store will be unavailable. The next step is to join a friend's private mission. After you accept it, and wait three seconds, you'll hear the garage door open.  And once you hit X past the screens, you'll just spawn inside your Rebel. I then tried it again hitting X right before I heard the garage door open... It still spawned me outside, without the Rebel, but I wasn't close enough to spawn inside my friends Osiris.  Every method I have tried for an hour straight. Nothing works. PS4 is busted.   PS4 here, I can't seem to get it to work.  I have the Unit 2 garage. Do I need my friend to park at the garage do, or the building across from the garage door?

gtaglitches,39lfdz,Nevera_,3,Sun Jun 14 09:30:16 2015 UTC,You can do it intentionally by force quitting the game just after purchasing it. I would guess that when R* tried to add the ability to add or remove it last patch they just made it really glitchy. If you want to test that quitting works you can do it with a dune buggy and it should be just the metal frame.

This cannot remove spoilers from cars that ALWAYS have them, such as the Comet and Kuruma.   Also, as an alternative, some people want spoilers on their Infernus or Elegy. If you bought an Infernus, and it didn't come with a spoiler, don't sell it. I bought one last night and it didn't come with a spoiler. To experiment, since I was also experiencing what i call the ""linked clones"" glitch (when you buy a car and it appears in a different garage as a duplicate and takes on all changes you do to one) so I did the glitch that's used to remove the spoiler, and lo and behold the spoiler appeared when I selected ""Stock"" after buying the second option."

gtaglitches,39hg8w,Paradoxs,1 point,Thu Jun 11 22:53:16 2015 UTC,"I did this glitch on PS3, so if you're on PC or Next Gen it may not work. Another reason it may not work is because you are doing the glitch with a saved outfit that already has a graphic. The last reason I can think of is that you are using a male character and I'm not sure if it works with male characters. If it still doesn't work then try watching the video and see if you did something wrong."

gtaglitches,39enrv,iLL3R,1 point,Fri Jun 12 17:35:33 2015 UTC,"Same thing happened to me with the Osiris but in the same garage. I just sold 2 cars from my garage to make room for 2 new DLC cars then I bought 1 Osiris. When I went into my garage I had 2 Orisis's parked inside. Called the mechanic and 2 Osiris's were listed.  I was planning to sell one and see what happens but a hacker joined the lobby and was exploding everything then my sounds glitched out and the game crashed. When I rebooted the game, I only had 1 Osiris in my garage.   I think it might have to do with a dupe glitch I did a few weeks back. The 2nd Osiris was parked in a spot that I had a duped Panto in that I never sold. The Panto changed back into a Rusty Rebel (but with same modded panto sale value). I ended up selling the Rusty Rebel then I put a street car Felon GT in it's place. When I sold the Felon GT today to make room, I only got $1800 for it (Rusty Rebel LSC sell price) rather then $9500. I think that garage slot might've been glitched in some way but now it's back to normal :("

The crazy part is the first space on the right in my Murietta garage is glitched as I sold a dupe panto and came back and the same car was there. I had to wait 48 min and sold it again. This time a zentornio that had disappeared showed up in this space. So I sold the panto next to it. Sure enough can back to the garage in a new session and the garage was full again with a panto in the second spot again. I also have all the money but I think my glitced garage dupe is still working over and over."

gtaglitches,39amu4,oncetorave,9,Wed Jun 10 14:29:05 2015 UTC,I bought it and fully modded on PS4...  Tested against the Zentorno and it is extremely close in speed (forward and backward) and just slightly faster off the mark...  In an impromptu race my friend in the Zen hit the Go boost and myself in the Osiris did not... he even then only had a slight lead.  In my opinion the Osiris is just the Turismo with a better engine and slightly different curves.

I'd say it's only really worth it if you want that edge over the Zentorno in racing.   As for freeroam I still think the Zentorno is best since it is protected from shots from behind.

If my BMX is gone when I turn on GTA in a couple of days when I'm next home, its gonna make me significantly less interested in GTA Online.  I'm a bit bored of Rockstar trying to close any loopholes that allow you to have fun outside of the completely arbitrary rules. I'd happily buy stuff like an insured BMX if they allowed me to, but why should Rockstar patch my ability to call one, or to ring for my mountain bike when I'm near Chiliad?   I can see no way that my being able to order a bike to be delivered to me is harming the game for anyone at all, Rockstar included. Can't they just fuck off and patch the god mode glitches and stuff like that? And hell, just put a new bike mod shop with colors and insurance. Charge me millions of GTA$ for it, I just want the functionality in the goddamn game.  EDIT: Removed derp."

I know what you mean about deliveries though.  I guess in that tiny aspect fo the game they are trying to keep it realistic, but they could let you lock the bike up somewhere instead, so that the next session the bike is where you left it.  That way you could always have a bike near the mountain if you want."

You can still call them if you own them normally, but only if you take it out as your personal vehicle and then request it via the interaction menu!   I'm gonna miss it if its gone - it is great.

gtaglitches,39a6ea,WishboneOffense,7,Wed Jun 10 12:53:35 2015 UTC,You can't make a million in an hour from this glitch though. You can only sell one car every 48 minutes and the most it will sell for is about $150k. You can easily make that in an hour of playing.

gtaglitches,39a6ea,TheCMaxGuy,5,Wed Jun 10 18:32:02 2015 UTC,Fun fact: To buy the new gold jet would require around 60 upgraded duped vehicles and selling one every 48 minutes would take 48 hours. Buying shark cards to purchase the jet would cost around £85/$130

gtaglitches,390a0k,chevyuk,-1,Mon Jun 8 12:48:51 2015 UTC,"Quite frankly, the ""restore"" is only a safety precaution, I've reset my PC many times before even while playing games and it's done absolutely nothing, it would only fuck up if you're copying/moving files etc, and I don't think that works, the first time I done the glitch I took way too long (about 2 seconds after the saving circle showed) and it didn't work, yet next time I done it around half a second after it showed and it worked fine, so I don't think  disconnecting would be quick enough."

As your character goes to put on the helmet, put on the saved outfit with the mask (might take a few tries to get the timing down the first time you do this). Save the outfit at a clothes store."

Get off bike/ATV, when your character is removing the helmet (precisely when the animation is going), equip the rebreather outfit. The hat wil pop up on top of your outfit when the animation is over. Go save that new outfit."

If you are on next gen/PC you can use the soda machine glitch. Just go to a soda machine and buy a drink while wearing the rebreather. Equip the flight cap (or an outfit with the flight cap) during the drinking animation, and the rebreather should pop back on when animation's over.

gtaglitches,38yrxx,seriouslulz,1 point,Tue Jun 9 04:21:13 2015 UTC,"Yes but depositing a ton of money at once automatically raises a flag on their end. A lot of people earn a lot of money and if someone deposits a ton of money at once into their bank, they will most likely keep an eye on your account to make sure there's not too much funny business. It's pretty much just something R* set up to make it easier for them to catch glitchers because they can't monitor every user's balance all the time."

See, the reason why they do this involves the old practice of duping cars on a second character to save up money for the future. When one needs money, they would go to this second character, sell all the Adders, and then deposit it all to their bank. This could range between $10-20 million in lost sales to Rockstar, so they set this up to monitor transactions between cash in the bank and cash on hand and check on people depositing millions at a time to make sure the player isn't obtaining the money illegitimately. Also, chill out."

gtaglitches,38tisn,christophopher,2,Tue Jun 9 13:17:34 2015 UTC,"PS4... Confirmed to work.  The player is only 100% bulletproof when he is unarmed.  While armed, damage can actually be received through the weapon itself. Also, the flare gun will still catch you on fire, and you cannot shoot while in a vehicle.   The knife does not damage you, but any other form of melee will.    Vehicles cannot run you over. However, players can still use a grenade and ride with you and suicidal bomb everyone to death."
gtaglitches,38tisn,SupaDawg,2,Mon Jun 8 06:51:36 2015 UTC,"I've noticed that since trying this out (Working on PS4) I lose the ability to shoot from the car after using it. That's an easy fix - Start a race and select point to point GTA, start the race and as soon as ""Weapons Enabled"" comes up, Options menu, select a new session and it works."

gtaglitches,38tisn,Kram37,1 point,Thu Jun 11 06:04:23 2015 UTC,I encountered someone using a different godmode glitch just now. Explosives did nothing and he didn't appear to be in passive. He had a bounty on him.  Also I've noticed during this passive glitch I can be killed with melee and some bullets do actually hit
gtaglitches,38tisn,The_right_mind,2,Sun Jun 7 01:39:22 2015 UTC,There's a well known bug that allows some instances of players in passive to recieve a bounty while staying in passive. Entirely possible it was just that.
gtaglitches,38tisn,abbthemad,1 point,Sun Jun 7 04:49:54 2015 UTC,All you have to do for that is have someone put a bounty on you while you're in passive. You'll appear to have a bounty to other players. My friend and I use this to lure players.

gtaglitches,38tisn,THESALTEDPEANUT,0,Sun Jun 7 14:31:24 2015 UTC,This glitch is on the same level as god mode.  Just straight up cheating.
gtaglitches,38tisn,Kram37,1 point,Thu Jun 11 05:47:34 2015 UTC,I'd say it's worse...   I only used god mode to do crazy stunts on my bike without dying...  I don't really see any legit use of this beyond abusing other players.

gtaglitches,38q2yr,DrFullFrech,2,Mon Jun 8 17:32:06 2015 UTC,Is the plate text you're setting a new plate or one you've already purchased? It will still charge you if the text is new and not from an old plate you have.

I'll add whitelisting the site to my weekend todo list. The plate is a bug with my server, it's trimming one char too early. I've opened issues on github for both to track them, thanks for the report!  Edit: I don't believe anyone's been banned due to this, at least I haven't seen anyone posting saying they have.

gtaglitches,38eslp,MisterSmith123,2,Fri Jun 5 02:39:07 2015 UTC,On PS4 I definitely drive up to the garage door very soon before it blows up yet as soon as I approach the door the map will flicker as usual but I can't exit the vehicle until the map stops flashing and then it's too late. Anyone else experiencing this? Anyone from PS4 have any tips if they've done this?
gtaglitches,38eslp,Zepol_,2,Wed Jun 3 21:36:36 2015 UTC,On ps4 with 35Mbps cable connection --- I posted below and finally got the garage teleport without the car and realized I needed some lag inside the mission to have any chance.  I used 13 xlag at insane setting inside of time to get away and got more flashes on the drive up and got really close to blowing up the car before I hit the garage and voila 1 dupe after about 2 hrs. I counted 1-1000 to ten then hit the door. At about 11 or 12 the car stops or blows up. I start counting from when the back wheel starts burning. On some cars it never burns. Did not have time to try again but that is my system so far.  I also shoot the hood of the car for a couple of seconds beyond seeing flames too so that the fire spreads faster. Another small tip is to aim at the driver while the car is coming at you. They usually stop or backup and then exit the car on their own so you don't have to do anything except shoot the hood when they leave the car running.  I think this is easier than trying to pull them out of the car and trying to stop the animation of you getting in the car...good luck

gtaglitches,38eslp,bossalinni13,1 point,Wed Jun 3 19:49:10 2015 UTC,Does the duped car end up with insurance? I want to do this on a BMX but won't bother trying if it wouldn't get insured. Thanks.
gtaglitches,38eslp,uberduger,3,Wed Jun 3 19:59:40 2015 UTC,"Any car you dupe in will have insurance, If you bought your BMX from the internet/phone store, then it will have insurance once you do the dupe, If its a random one you found, this glitch will not insure it.  You must use a dupe without the 45 minute wait to sell(there are none at the moment), in order to insure that kind of BMX. Because then you are duping your BMX over a rebel or a vehicle you bought from the store, so it will give it insurance"
gtaglitches,38eslp,nevuial,1 point,Wed Jun 3 23:28:15 2015 UTC,"Ahh, makes sense. I was thinking of trying this glitch using a PV instead of a street car, but closer reading tells me that is not possible.  Thanks for the info dude!"
gtaglitches,38eslp,WafflePieGuy,1 point,Thu Jun 4 00:14:04 2015 UTC,"I did not try this particular revision of the fire glitch, but I can tell you for sure that it won't insure the BMX since OP said that it only works with street cars."

gtaglitches,38eslp,nevuial,1 point,Wed Jun 3 20:17:45 2015 UTC,"when all entrances to your personal vehicle, or another players are blocked, if you have access it  when you try to enter itwill teleport you in."
gtaglitches,38eslp,WafflePieGuy,1 point,Wed Jun 3 23:53:07 2015 UTC,"So basically there's 2 ""new"" things on the to-do list right?   The engine has to be running when you set the car on fire. The back wheel has to be on fire.   BTW there are other methods to have the engine still running when setting the car on fire :   Your friend could set it on fire when you are already inside it. You can exit the car, fire a couple bullets or punch the air, then quickly go back inside the car and back out again (turn on headlights to have a visual confirmation). You can also block off the front doors so that you're able to teleport out of the car. The engine is left running.   OP, if you're able to hit the glitch, could you tell us if it works with these or on the contrary if it's required to set the car on fire before entering it for the first time?"

gtaglitches,38eslp,MisterSmith123,1 point,Fri Jun 5 01:59:47 2015 UTC,"Some things I noticed:    The first 2 times I duped the car the back wheel itself was not actually on fire. Just the engine and the gas tank/above the wheel well. If the tire being on fire does help, the Canis Seminole and possibly other large wheel vehicles (trucks/SUVs) tend to let the back tire catch fire much easier because the tire touches the gas tank fire regardless. The third time I hit the dupe was with the Canis Seminole (jeep grand Cherokee looking SUV).  The faster you get out the better. If you character is closing the door on the vehicle on fire, you're probably not going to hit it. The times I have hit the dupe was with tapping the run button as my character was getting out. Even better though: knock the door off the car you're using."

Just as you close the the door you accepted the job, giving you a few sec to drive towards your garage, when you got the option to choose which garage, you would just let it hoover over the garage you have atleast one free spot, When the mission loaded up,  you would as SOON you had the option, quickly quit out the mission. for PS that was O,X.X. - you would then spawn next to the blocked car. - press triangle once,teleport inside the car, wait. and then you went into the garage..'dupped - You could do iyt with any of your cars."

Text tutorial :) :  Setup:   Two garages in the same building In one garage is the car (A) you'd like to dupe and in the other an empty car slot You'll need a random street car (R1) (which can be stored in the garage) Block both doors of car A, so you can teleport in car A (for example with another street car R2)   Glitch:   Place R1 in front of your garage and get out of the car Start a ""Random Job (on call)"" Pull out your phone and choose a job from Martin (but don't accept it) Get in the car. As soon as the door is closed accept the Job from Martin. Drive towards your garage and hover over the garage with the empty car slot. When the mission loaded up, get out of it as fast as you can (B,A,A / O,X,X) You spawn next to your car, press Y/triangle and teleport in. Wait. Duped.

gtaglitches,380oal,DangerousCommercials,1 point,Mon Jun 1 13:24:17 2015 UTC,not sure but if you go to the rockstar support site you can request a 'token' which will let you change. You just have to ask for it and theyll give it to you
gtaglitches,380oal,RockyCat21,1 point,Wed Jun 3 08:44:34 2015 UTC,I don't if thats safest for me (Actually hacked account.)
gtaglitches,380oal,nevuial,2,Wed Jun 3 08:54:12 2015 UTC,"They're not going to go through your stats, inventory or whatever. It would be way too much time consuming for them. When I asked for an appearance change on my dirty throwaway account (not hacked but really glitched as fck and probably reported at least a couple times), I got a positive answer in about half an hour. There's just no way they're checking everything for every request they have in such a short time. If you're going down that road, you will be able to change appearance for both your characters if you want to.  The other way around is to create a new secondary character and level it up to 6, then go to ""Swap Character"", and select that secondary character again. At this point you should get the ""Do you want to change appearance?"" prompt. When you're staring at that prompt, unplug your ethernet cable (If using WiFi, sign off of XBL or PSN. On PC I guess you could alt+tab and turn off WiFi aswell).  Now just sign back in and go to ""Choose character"" again, but this this time, you'll be able to alter appearance for any character you choose. Select your main character, and edit it as you wish. You might want not to use your new secondary character so that next time you select it, it will ask you to change appearance and you can simply redo the ""sign off, back in"" part at will.  Keep in mind that altering appearance in any way will delete all of your saved outfits. Last thing : I read somewhere that you can't switch genders anymore (possibly not on every platform)"

I've tried so many times in the past 3 weeks but never had success.  All the videos and posts relating to modding it with Charles are 1.5-2 months old so I have a feeling it was patched..?
gtaglitches,380oal,uberduger,1 point,Mon Jun 1 18:24:43 2015 UTC,"They are definitely trying to patch it, I'm sure. Recently we lost the ability to mod LS Customs-less vehicles like the BMX with it, so I'm sure they are going to gradually break it. Not sure about Insurgent modding though, sorry."
gtaglitches,380oal,nevuial,1 point,Mon Jun 1 18:51:31 2015 UTC,"I really don't think it is patched. I did it a couple weeks ago. What you want to make sure of, is when you edit the iFruit ticket, you need to edit the ""multiplayer"" part because there's actually 2 orders compressed into one. One of them is relative to Story Mode and therefore, is irrelevant for what you want to do. Take a closer look, this got me confused a couple times."
gtaglitches,380oal,iLL3R,2,Tue Jun 2 07:40:54 2015 UTC,"I've had plenty of experience modding 30+ other cars with Charles+iFruit, but I'm still unsure as to what you mean by '2 orders compressed into one'. Every time I've made an order and intercepted the ticket, all the info relates only to my multiplayer characters car.  Were you editing story mode cars at the same time or something? (causing 2 orders to go through in the same ticket?) I'm genuinely curious as to what you might mean."
gtaglitches,380oal,nevuial,2,Tue Jun 2 16:51:42 2015 UTC,"Ok now I'm really confused. What happened exactly when I modded my 1st character's Insurgent is that I was changing the ""vehicle"" hash (0 to 9) in a part on the order that was labeled as ""sp1_order"" and it didn't work of course until I noticed it and I changed the hash that was in the ""mp0_order"" part.  Now, I just tried this for my 2nd character's Insurgent and it there's no ""sp_order"" part anymore (as expected, since the other time it was the first time I noticed it). I don't know why I had that 2in1 order in the first place (maybe I already had an order pending for single player? dunno).  Anyways, since it's not the problem you're running into, let's try and solve your issue. I just succesfully modded my 2nd character's insurgent (Full armor, green tint, empty plate…) without a problem. So it is definitely not patched. Here's exactly what I did :   Drive the Insurgent out and then back into the garage. Edit an iFruit order for ANY car belonging to the same character as the Insurgent you want to mod. Insurgent's hash is ""1"":""2071877360"", also set vehicle hash as 0 (""vehicle"":""0""). Do your modding as you wish. Disable breakpoints, execute, wait for 20seconds. If you don't receive any in-game notification, just +1 the values you have for both ""vehicle"" hash and ""0"" hash (which is the order number) then back to step 4. When you receive the in-game notification, just drive the Insurgent to LSC, and apply your order.   Where exactly are you stuck?"
gtaglitches,380oal,iLL3R,2,Wed Jun 3 08:08:48 2015 UTC,"Ok I have finally put through an order successfully.  What I did differently than I usually would was 3 things.   Stood in garage rather than waiting outside LSC in Insurgent or sitting in a street car with Insurgent in garage. Waited at least a whole minute for the order to come through after executing in Charles (previously I was waiting 20-30 secs max before submitting another because all my orders for other cars go through in 4-5 secs). I upgraded everything in a single order EXCEPT turbo. (I was thinking about what was causing all my orders to fail and all I could come up with was that 'maybe because turbo for the Insurgent isn't available in LSC, it messes the iFruit order up' - NOTE: Turbo is available for the insurgent in LSC, I was wrong - but there's a possibility that removing this from my order might have resolved my problem.) I then placed a 2nd order for Turbo only and that went through as well.   Thank you /u/nevuial and /u/moderndogs for taking the time to give detailed explanations, I appreciate it.    EDIT// I also just realised that I've recently won enough races and unlocked all the mods in LSC. This may have had an effect on my order going through successfully as well since I won 9-10 races today before attempting to mod the Insurgent."
gtaglitches,380oal,nevuial,2,Wed Jun 3 14:07:17 2015 UTC,Good to know you sorted it out :)  Enjoy your modded beast !
gtaglitches,380oal,moderndogs,2,Wed Jun 3 15:38:07 2015 UTC,woot woot!   I'm very happy for you!
gtaglitches,380oal,moderndogs,1 point,Wed Jun 3 17:03:48 2015 UTC,"I sure have.   I'm on 360, but not sure if that matters.   there are a couple tricks.  Make sure you're in gta online while you do this.  make sure you've exited and reentered your garage with the insurgent before starting.   Ifruit should show 9 cars and not 10. none of those listed cars are the insurgent so pick any car and order a new plate.   in Charles, make sure breakers are turned on right before you confirm the order of the plate.   once you can edit the order in Charles, set the vehicle ID to whatever it needs to be for the insurgent.   increase the order number by 1, TURN OFF BREAKERS, then execute.    wait 10 to 15 seconds.   if nothing happens, increase the order number by one, and increase the vehicle position number by one and execute.  wait 10 to 15s.  continue increasing the order number and position number by one between each execute.  you must also make sure that the 'cost'  is sufficiently high.   if you're making a custom plate you can expect to pay over 100k.  not that you asked, but my insurgent is red white and blue with patriot tire smoke and a star spangled banner horn with a Yankton plate that says MURICA.   I like to deliver democracy and freedom to people."
gtaglitches,380oal,iLL3R,1 point,Tue Jun 2 14:41:24 2015 UTC,Yeah tried this exact same method (including playing around with cost) but still no luck on PC.  Where is your character when you make the order? In garage? Sitting inside the Insurgent outside LSC? In another car? etc..
gtaglitches,380oal,moderndogs,2,Tue Jun 2 16:58:40 2015 UTC,"on foot, outside my garage, with insurgent parked inside."
gtaglitches,380oal,nevuial,2,Tue Jun 2 18:57:05 2015 UTC,I was in the garage (edit : on foot) when I did it. On 360 too. I did not bother about cost (this was an important step when in-garage modding was still a thing. not anymore)

gtaglitches,380oal,nevuial,3,Tue Jun 2 08:19:59 2015 UTC,"Short answer : no  Longer answer : these vehicles are blacklisted, meaning they would be automatically deleted from your garage if you ever managed to put them there in the first place."

gtaglitches,380oal,moderndogs,3,Tue Jun 2 10:42:49 2015 UTC,"it appears that you can bet in races with just 2 people now.  I did this 2 days ago with a friend, we were doing the race I made (shortest race possible for 360, made using a glitch in the creator) and I bet 10k and he bet 500 and when he won the race he got my 10k.  the race is only 7 or so seconds long so you can just replay over and over."
gtaglitches,380oal,nevuial,2,Tue Jun 2 14:45:17 2015 UTC,"This is a good technique too ! After a bit of testing, it appears that the best payout is achieved when betting 300$ against 10K$."
gtaglitches,380oal,nevuial,2,Wed Jun 3 08:53:21 2015 UTC,"You actually can't share money made in jobs. You can only share the money you earn in free roam activities (robbing stores, bounties, simeon cars, lester's targets...).  I'd suggest you to let your friends mug you (up to 10K$ every 10 minutes). You can also put a bounty on your friend's head, kill him, and then give him the bounty (9K$ every 48minutes). You can also check what cars does Simeon want. If he needs an F620 (or another expensive car), you can deliver it and give the 12K$ to your friend.  Keep in mind there's a daily limit on how much money one can get from this sharing. (No limit on how much one can share AFAIK)  R* won't ever let us give more money than that. Simply because some players have ridiculous amounts of glitched/modded money to the point where they do not know what to do with it at all. You need to understand that, if one were to get hundreds of thousands of $ from a friend, he wouldn't have the same interest in playing the game anymore. I honestly think this is also the reason why we haven't got the Casino DLC yet.  All that being said, the most effective way to help out a penniless friend is simply to host the Fleeca Job (on hard). Give him the max 70% cut. Your friend will make about 120K$ in about half an hour, some extra RP and what's more? You get about 30K aswell for being such a nice friend ;)"

gtaglitches,37t9kp,code3100,15,Sat May 30 05:17:04 2015 UTC,"So it seems R* didn't actually patch the original part of the most recent dupe glitch.   I think you could still make a Panto register as a street car by having a friend spam a random car, then drive it out, request personal vehicle and drive into LSC. I'll test it when I can, but it might be a while.  Edit: Nope! It didn't work. The vehicle gives you the message, ""This vehicle cannot be modified.""   But since I have top comment, I can give a word of warning: DO NOT STOP HALFWAY THROUGH FILLING GARAGES. If your friend stops spamming the car, it will disappear like with the other glitches. This means there's a good chance the vehicle you're in will register as your active personal vehicle, and you'll need to find another street car.  Oh, and this glitch is much easier to do with the Cargobob than the spamming method, due to the amount of time it can take. I gave my friend carpal tunnel syndrome filling two garages."

gtaglitches,37t9kp,69ingPutins,1 point,Sat May 30 19:25:19 2015 UTC,I tried this with my 2nd character but it didn't work. It would show the random street cars in my 2nd characters garage + an already fully modded car from my 1st characters garage (which happened to be the same model of car I was modding on my 2nd char so it could just be a problem for me).  Would love to know if anyone else has had any success with this. I'm planning on retrying it with my 1st character if I have time before it gets patched.

Maybe the Felon GT or the Sentinel will sell for more if you bump into them since they have the most sell value in LSC. I wonder about the custom Sentinel that spawns by Tinsel Towers at night...

Once you add the tracker on the first time and drive out of the mod shop, when you go back in the loss and theft prevention option is missing. You also can not drive the car into a garage after you add the tracker (there is already one in your garage so this would have allowed you to get at least 1 duplicate).

gtaglitches,37t9kp,ted3681,3,Sat May 30 05:40:50 2015 UTC,"I was a bit confused at first as well, but I understand now.  When you purchase a tracker for the street car, you have the option to replace a car in your garage. You select yes, and it replaces it. When you drive out of LSC and drive back in, you have the option to buy another tracker. When you purchase another, it will again ask you to replace a vehicle. You replace another vehicle in your garage.   By repeating this process, you're placing multiples of that fully modded street vehicle into your garages, at the cost of only modifying the first one."
gtaglitches,37t9kp,Fibroski,0,Sun May 31 03:17:16 2015 UTC,"I might not have been clear, you are not re upgrading the car, you just drive back into LSC with the already upgraded street car, rebuy the tracker & you select what car you want to replace in your garage."
gtaglitches,37t9kp,ted3681,1 point,Sat May 30 05:48:08 2015 UTC,Yeah but is it like replacing a car in the garage and not taking the one your in or where you n making money here?
gtaglitches,37t9kp,WafflePieGuy,1 point,Sat May 30 05:52:09 2015 UTC,"yes, since your friend is holding your other car with the cargobob it will not take the car you are in at LSC, so you can drive back in and do it again"

We initially ran into a bit of trouble with only mods duping over to the car in our garage (only tried xenon) but we think that was because the modded street car was one that Simeon wanted.

This ones annoying for the friend as he cant go AFK. But it's faster to set up.   Video  Have all 3 garages full, a random car in one. Set vehicle access to No-One.    Steps    Drive out random car from any garage, get friend to stand outside it and spam Y.  Get street car, take to LSC, fully upgrade.  Go to Loss/Theft Prevention, then place a tracker on it for $2000. It should say 'Replace a vehicle?' Choose the same garage that the random car came from (The vehicle your friend is spamming Y on).  Drive out LSC, then drive back in, and repeat step 3.     I recommend duping around 3-4 or above, so that you'll actually gain profit. This does not bypass 48min wait :("

gtaglitches,37t9kp,NotAMachopShop,1 point,Sat May 30 19:40:03 2015 UTC,So I just did a different dupe glitch while trying to do this one because I had spaces left in my garage. Exactly two to be specific.  I had my personal car held in the air by a cargobob and I modded a street car in LSC. When I added the tracker it didn't ask me to replace a vehicle (because I had the spots opopen in my garage). Once I drove the car out I noticed that the cargobob no longer showed my personal vehicle with it. I told the person flying it to release the car it had under it. Once they released it the car disappeared and I got a personal vehicle maker next to me. It was the exact same car that I had just modded. I drove the car that I was still in (the one I drove out of LSC) to the garage with a space in it. Once I entered I saw I stool had an empty car slot. I got out of the car and went to the blue circle and noticed that the empty spot had the cars model listed instead of saying empty. I drove a car out of the garage amd back in amd now I had a dupe of the street car I had just modded.
gtaglitches,37t9kp,SkyKing1776,1 point,Sun May 31 04:34:13 2015 UTC,"Seems a little confusing, I kinda get what you are saying but I would need to try it myself."

Or is there a way to keep one with no tracker? I'm just curious if you gotta spend money again for every time you do it.

gtaglitches,37mqt8,GTAthrowawayaccount,1 point,Fri May 29 21:00:56 2015 UTC,Personally do not know myself. My guess is it has to be vending machine as you can't open your quick menu until shortly after opening the can.

gtaglitches,37cubu,swrklo,-1,Wed May 27 10:41:08 2015 UTC,I just bought Panto to do this glitch and shit its patched!  Previously i did this and i duped over 5 carbonizer cars. When i wanted to sell them i was shocked ! Coz I cant sell them! FUCK! I AM HELL POOR! Moreover i spent all my money (made through completing missions and heist today) on that Pento (customizations). Ahhhh..!!!
gtaglitches,37cubu,crazymee,2,Wed May 27 15:52:42 2015 UTC,"Keep hold of the fully modded Panto, there will be another glitch in the future.  It sucks you duped cars which are unsellable.  If you're new to this, the directions did state the Panto & Elegy are the most profitable.  Don't complain about being out the money, instead just take this as a learning lesson.  I spent a decent amount buying Murietta Heights & Shuttle, but was never able to get that glitch to work.  Just a part of the game & learning process."

Also no need to spend any money, street cars and Elegies work exactly the same as a Rebel."
gtaglitches,37cubu,mattverso,4,Tue May 26 19:45:05 2015 UTC,"Couple more tips to save some time :   Car-to-be-duped can come from any garage, not just the full garage where you're going to store the dupes. This also means you can fill more than one garage at a time. You can simply dupe your dupes over and over again. It's exactly the same. There's really no need to keep track of your original car.

A friend Car you want to dupe in the garage. (Panto is best for most profit, Coquette works too, and Elegy) At least one other car to put dupe car over, e.g Rebel, Elegy or street car. Any other personal vehicle Steps:    Set your vehicle access to No-One, and pull out any random vehicle from the garage. Tell your friend to spam Y - it should tell him he isn't allowed in, but he needs to just keep spamming Y until you're finished. Go inside the garage, pull out a vehicle you wanna duplicate. Once you're outside, go to the interaction menu and request personal vehicle, then drive straight back into the garage. Accept garage full error, replace over any other car you wish like a Rebel. Car Duped!    Make sure your friend is still spamming Y the whole way through, so you can just repeat steps 3 & 4, without pulling out another vehicle.

gtaglitches,376tcg,uberduger,1 point,Mon May 25 18:55:03 2015 UTC,Can OP or any other kind soul please do me a massive favor? Try this with a street BMX stored on the bike rack and see if it ends up in a car slot with insurance. Managed to get one on a car slot with the other glitch but no insurance. You will officially qualify as a superhero if you are able to do so!
gtaglitches,376tcg,nevuial,2,Mon May 25 23:36:56 2015 UTC,"Doesn't work. Me and ma buddies have been trying different ways of this, wouldn't work at all with a BMX."
gtaglitches,376tcg,uberduger,1 point,Mon May 25 23:47:30 2015 UTC,Damnit! Thanks for letting me know. Think the other method allows it but it's incredibly hard to do. I managed to get one in a slot but no insurance... :(
gtaglitches,376tcg,nevuial,1 point,Wed May 27 10:57:31 2015 UTC,"How do you know that ? You would only know it if it was ever destroyed because it doesn't appear in the garage when pressing d-pad down.  Anyways, rule is :   If you managed to store a bike you bought in a car slot, it is insured. If it's a bike you stole from street in that car slot, then it's not insured.  If however you duped a street bike (or any vehicle for that matter) in a car slot using a glitch that would bypass the 48min wait, then it would be insured aswell because the game is tricked into thinking you bought that bike (hence the bypass).  I could add to this that vehicles stored on the rack can have insurance or not but even if they do you won't be able to ever make a claim on those. I however have been able to save a destroyed insured car that was on my rack by swapping it with a bike from a car slot and then I was able to make the claim. (But the car slot bike was back on the rack obviously)"
gtaglitches,376tcg,uberduger,1 point,Mon May 25 10:23:08 2015 UTC,"How do you know that ?    Because the other glitch allows you to dupe over a PV, as far as I can tell. I wasn't able to do it but think that's because I screwed up the timings. And I know that it wasn't insured because I took it out of the garage and tried - knew it wouldn't have worked, but a BMX in a car slot isn't useful to me unless insured so I had nothing to lose!  While trying the other night to dupe a BMX over a PV, I found it incredibly hard as the bike or corpse that I was using would disappear if I got too far from them. I tried it with a friend's BMX so it wouldn't vanish, but then the map blinking didn't really work :("
gtaglitches,376tcg,nevuial,1 point,Mon May 25 10:31:44 2015 UTC,"Did you try taking the bike out second? As if you were trying to dupe a car over it? When I did that with the previous method, I ended up with the dupe car on the rack and the bike in the car slot with insurance (since it was bought). Nothing duped, but the vehicles were swapped."
gtaglitches,376tcg,uberduger,1 point,Mon May 25 10:56:10 2015 UTC,"The last glitch to do this would have involved taking out BMX then another car and then putting BMX in. What about trying that but putting a 'request PV' step in there somewhere? I can't get to my PS4 to try it at the moment, but worth a shot, no?"
gtaglitches,376tcg,TehEpicSaudiGuy,2,Mon May 25 15:22:06 2015 UTC,"So I just read this more carefully and it seems there's no way to use this glitch for insured bicycles / cars on bike rack.  Problem is : ""request PV"" always gets your last PV back to you. So if you take a car out you can dupe it by requesting it when still driving it (the car you drive becomes the dupe; and it's now considered as a street car). So, you could dupe a bicycle (maybe) by taking it out and then requesting it but driving it back to the garage won't put it in a car slot and the dupe would lose its insurance (since treated as a street bike)."
gtaglitches,376tcg,swrklo,1 point,Mon May 25 16:03:10 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, that makes sense :( Thanks for that - I'm normally quite bad at spotting when a glitch can be used for insurance on a BMX, so I have to ask!  (Got an insured BMX already but it's only a boring one bought off the website, so I'm looking to get a colored one and a scorcher to go with it!)"

gtaglitches,37b2s0,JayBobGamerZz,3,Tue May 26 08:58:45 2015 UTC,"This is exactly the same method as the ""Modify street cars for free"" ""glitch"" that was around pre-Heists. Not really a glitch tho, really you're just hard quitting before the autosave. Also same goes for the ""Complete Criminal Mastermind even if someone dies"" method and the 48-min bypass method on PC. (edit : maybe this last one could work on console if you were to master the timing. Just a thought)  But doing this for 9K bounties is a complete waste of time IMO. You can earn like twice more $ and 5 times more RP in about the same amount of time by killing cops in a tank in a mission. Also you won't be harming your friend's K/D that way and it's actually way more fun than sitting in loading screens.  Anyways, thanks for sharing OP, I'll keep an eye out for other ways to make use of this."

gtaglitches,37582v,thsxftmdgt,3,Mon May 25 00:32:02 2015 UTC,There is actually but its so little money  Start methd up while your by a convinience store run in store   use a pistol to shoot cash register until it breaks and drops cash collect cash and run out of the store until you hear the cash register break again run back in and collect cash  Keep running in and out
gtaglitches,37582v,iLL3R,4,Mon May 25 03:27:26 2015 UTC,"You earn ~$70 on average from each register and it takes 15 secs to collect the money then run across the road and back. Say you're at a 2 register store. That's roughly $600/min which equates to $36k/hr.  You're better off playing missions/heists/races which pay much better for your time plus you get RP as well. I personally prefer playing missions solo since there's less chance of teammates dying or quitting (heists) and you're guaranteed the max payout (whereas with races, not so much)."
gtaglitches,37582v,nevuial,1 point,Mon May 25 10:26:40 2015 UTC,"Just saying : somebody dying or quitting in a mission won't make you lose except for rare ones (e.g. the one with the 2 Lazers where you have to shoot other planes and Buzzards) and there's just no way to play heists solo.  Also, ""max payout"" in a mission can only be achieved if you're playing it with at least one friend who is also in your crew. It also pays more if you complete it with somebody who hasn't completed it beforehand.  Edit: On topic :  You can do this in free roam too, just go to a clothing store (cheap ones have 3 registers !) and shove a vehicle in between the doors so that they won't close (bikes work best), then just do the same (you need to be aiming your gun while entering the store the first time to be able to shoot the registers). Call Lester in the process to get rid of the cops if you have to."

We tried to do all at once and started getting upset with each other, making things more difficult.   To answer your first question, if you do not die but you fail the mission, it does not reset the challenge. If one of you guys gets the notification that your challenge progress was reset, everyone would just have to exit the game completely.   For your second question, if you are on PS4, all you have to do is close the application. Not sure if there is something similar on Xbox or PC but pretty sure unplugging your internet should work. You just need to close the game completely. Sometimes you will get the message that your challenge progress was reset, but once you completely exit out of your game, your progress will still be there.  If you need anymore info, just ask.

Transferring affects both your characters slots."

gtaglitches,37582v,iLL3R,3,Tue May 26 15:04:42 2015 UTC,"Probably playing the Blow Up II mission (works for all platforms AFAIK). After you destroy the cars and have a wanted level, keep the cops on you for 10 mins and kill as many cops as possible. Best in combination with a wall breach that you can shoot out of or get a tank.  You consistently get 7,500-10,000rp depending on how many cops you kill and get paid around $20k."
gtaglitches,37582v,nevuial,2,Mon May 25 15:10:12 2015 UTC,I really think this works in any mission with cops and with something you have to deliver. No need to grind the same mission over and over again.

Accept the second message ASAP and then spam the heck out of Triangle / Y when you're going down from the clouds. Finally run as fast as you can to the slamvan and hop in. (Access on everyone is fine, leave a door open before doing the glitch)  You need to be inside the slamvan when everything is rendered for the glitch to work. No need to teleport in (I never did, since I was duping bicycles and a Lifeguard ATV). You should be able to walk/run as usual for a few seconds before your character glitches out and starts walking on the spot, right?

gtaglitches,37582v,qballmac,1 point,Sat May 30 08:04:33 2015 UTC,"Have an outfit with a rebreather saved and another free outfit slot. Equip NVG, and go on Passive Mode. Go to a hairdresser's salon and sit on the chair with the NVG. Manually go out of Passive mode (Pause -> Online -> Options -> Disable Passive) Have a friend kill you while still on the chair. You will respawn wearing the NVG without the balaclava. Go to a clothing store, save that NVG outfit. Now, whenever you'll browse through your outfits in the clothing stores' menu, not interaction, the NVG will glitch over any outfit you choose, providing you select the NVG one first.   Note : Your character will be totally bald when wearing this. If you want to hide this, you should add a helmet or a hat to your rebreather outfit before adding the NVG. You can do so with the ""Soda Machine Glitch"""

gtaglitches,370nw7,ErasableMark,2,Tue May 26 14:04:39 2015 UTC,"You're right that the panto is the most lucrative but you can sell duped elegies for 226k so it's a pretty close second.  I do the panto because that extra 2k adds up, but the elegy has the added benefit that there's less starting cost (since it's free) and that you will never have to worry about selling the original since you're unable to.  *edit: the 226 on the elegy probably depends on which car you're doing over.   when I did it with street cars it was 226, but with a rebel I'm getting 218k."

gtaglitches,371hqd,GTAthrowawayaccount,1 point,Sun May 24 01:51:49 2015 UTC,"Try this: Hold the left joystick up postion your spawn point close to the edge (with the right joystick) so that when you press down on the left joystick, the spawn point placement marker goes off the edge and onto the ground below. Once you have that camera angle, hold the left joystick up and zoom out at the same time. This will keep your spawn point on the prop you want but make it so that when you move the joystick down and up, it will move faster from the ground where it registers to the prop where you want it, and the camera angle will stop moving right where you want the spawn point. While moving the camera angle from the ground to the prop quickly, set the spawn point just before it clips onto the prop, and it should register as being placed on the ground, but actually be placed on the prop. That's the only way that I know of. It can be a pain, but if it works once then you can get it to work with all of the spawn points."

All you should have to do is drive the bike from the car spot to the garage with the bike you want in the spot on the rack and it will prompt you to swap a bike. Choose the one you want in the car spot and it should swap."

I have a grey one in a car slot and colored ones, both in that garage and in another garage, that I'd like to swap it for. So it sounds like I might be able to do it by taking the insured bike to a different garage and swapping it for one of the bikes there? I assumed that bikes didn't work the same way as cars, and that swapping one wouldn't make it move but rather erase it.  I might try that, thanks. But will do some serious googling and experimentation first, as I dont want to lose either of my insured bikes! Have a BMX and a MTB, so might practice on the MTB and see if it works before losing the BMX!  Thanks for the tip - will let you know if I ever pluck up the courage to try it and tell you how it went."

gtaglitches,36xpy1,iLL3R,1 point,Sun May 24 06:22:30 2015 UTC,Not sure but it might be due to the fact that it's much easier to abuse it on PC due to stereo mix input (can play music/sound as a mic recording input without anything even coming out of your speakers).

gtaglitches,36xpy1,SoullessRager,2,Sat May 23 20:03:05 2015 UTC,"If I remember the trick correctly, (on Xbox one at least) you could save the mask to the outfit, then get on a motorcycle/ATV, shoot your gun and quickly get off which leaves the motorcycle running, then press the button to get on the vehicle and as your character goes to put the desired helmet on you switch to the outfit quickly."

gtaglitches,36xpy1,gtaisforchildren,1 point,Sun May 24 02:36:54 2015 UTC,"Bad news first: I couldn't get any of these newer methods to work. The only result I can get is with the old school ATV glitch where you scroll through masks really fast while putting on your helmet.  Good news though, what I did by accident came out better than what I had originally intended. I was gonna use the grey wolf mask with my grey outfit but the special edition Manhunt mask works better. It's rare and stands out more than it would if the mask and outfit were the same color.  So yeah, got it saved to outfits and all that. Can even instant switch from civilian clothes to my superhero costume. I'm happy with how this turned out."

There is lots of advice around about limits etc, but seriously nobody knows. Some people get banned for small amounts, others get away with ridiculous amounts.  Other than that - common sense. There is always a chance R* might catch you by themselves, either by watching while you play, or by some software filter or something. The other way is if people see you and report you.  So, if nobody sees you, you cannot be reported, but that does not guarantee you are safe."
