I've never been in the US, but in Mexico (while my dad was working there and I visited him over the summer) after a mountain hike and horse riding day I rode on a track at the foot of the mountain which was pretty rad.

annakendrick,3d0sah,offermansmustache,9,Sun Jul 12 20:51:29 2015 UTC,I'm a straight female and I couldn't give a shit. I'm just here because I think she's fantastic.
annakendrick,3d0sah,deathcabforkatie_,7,Mon Jul 13 02:15:22 2015 UTC,Nice to see that there are not only guys here. Hope you don't get too put off by the one or two pervs that lurk about. Most people here are pretty cool.
annakendrick,3d0sah,hex1031,4,Mon Jul 13 05:51:57 2015 UTC,"Yup, always good to see other lesser recognized people in the sub (same goes for any sub with a stereotyped community like this); while I am a straight guy and do find her attractive I'm mainly here just because I'm a fan of hers in general and really like her as an actress, singer and personality."
annakendrick,3d0sah,spanieldaniel,13,Mon Jul 13 20:33:47 2015 UTC,She has  female fans who are just fans of her work or admire her in a non-sexual way.
annakendrick,3d0sah,pornbama,3,Sun Jul 12 21:45:40 2015 UTC,"True but there's not much stuff about her work here and when there is, it's still showcasing how hot she is"
annakendrick,3d0sah,offermansmustache,9,Sun Jul 12 21:58:40 2015 UTC,"Women's magazine's are full of pictures of hot models too.  Women look at those pictures as something to emulate rather than as a masturbatory aid.  They could come to this sub to see Anna's hair, clothes, and makeup."
annakendrick,3d0sah,pornbama,4,Sun Jul 12 22:16:04 2015 UTC,maybe but i doubt anywhere close to half of the subscribers are here for that reason
annakendrick,3d0sah,offermansmustache,5,Sun Jul 12 22:17:25 2015 UTC,most of Anna's fans are female. I'm not sure if there are many here though. they tend to stick more towards social media. plus I'm sure the ones that were here were probably scared off from creepy posters like redditiscensored/justforthiscrap.
annakendrick,3d0sah,hex1031,2,Sun Jul 12 22:28:02 2015 UTC,from creepy posters like redditiscensored/justforthiscrap.   probably creepy poster judging by the latter's current rep lol
annakendrick,3d0sah,spanieldaniel,5,Mon Jul 13 20:32:45 2015 UTC,"Me. I'm a straight dude and I find her to be very cute and charming and all, but I have no interest in seeing her nude. Jennifer Love Hewitt, on the other hand..."

annakendrick,3d0sah,JimmyHasFancyPlans,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:25:58 2015 UTC,God that would be amazing. I still think she wants to show them to us at some point.
annakendrick,3d0sah,jizzonherarms,4,Mon Jul 13 05:26:22 2015 UTC,Unlikely. She's said a few times that she'll never do nudity.
annakendrick,3d0sah,hex1031,0,Mon Jul 13 05:44:32 2015 UTC,Meh. Actresses change their mind on that all the time. She doesn't have to right now because she's so popular. Maybe in a couple years when her fame wanes a bit she will do so. I hope so anyway. She's such a cocktease all the time that I think deep down she really does want to show us fans her goods at some point.
annakendrick,3d0sah,jizzonherarms,3,Mon Jul 13 17:58:25 2015 UTC,"True, but Anna seemed to feel quite strongly about it when she was asked if she'd ever do it. I know she's quite shy in that regard, she feels uncomfortable even in just a bathing suit. But yeah, who knows what can happen in the future. I'm just not betting on it."

annakendrick,3d3iix,OnECenTX,11,Mon Jul 13 05:55:00 2015 UTC,"I watch Pitch Perfect every other week.. 50/50 is a MUST watch, imho.  Pitch Perfect 2 was ok.."
annakendrick,3d3iix,liamrunescape,2,Mon Jul 13 06:04:12 2015 UTC,"Pitch Perfect 2 was ok..   Haven't seen it, would you say it's still worth a watch if you really enjoyed the first film? My chill-watching movie standards aren't that high anyway, just don't want to go into it with really high expectations. (Also is the soundtrack good because at least that could make up for it. :V)"
annakendrick,3d3iix,spanieldaniel,3,Mon Jul 13 19:04:40 2015 UTC,"Well if you've heard the soundtrack, then you know theres a riff-off. I'd say the movie goes downhill from thereon."
annakendrick,3d3iix,liamrunescape,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:14:52 2015 UTC,"As long as the riff-off's good, I'll be good. I loved the first movie as a whole but that was one of the things that made the film. Obviously it was an original (enough, at least the way it was presented) concept the first time around, but yeah, hope they executed it well the second time. (Not gonna speculate anymore, I'll just watch the movie sometime. :P Didn't see it in theatres when it was out as I wasn't that interested, but hell, it's PP and it's got Anna in it, take my money.)"
annakendrick,3d3iix,spanieldaniel,3,Mon Jul 13 20:45:07 2015 UTC,With a nice google search you wouldn't need to wait till it comes out on BluRay or anything..
annakendrick,3d3iix,liamrunescape,2,Mon Jul 13 21:01:57 2015 UTC,"Indeed ;P (I admittedly torrented the original back in the day when it came out, hence my dad and I thought it was a baseball movie or something when we selected it and then suddenly saw amplifier bars bounce across the screen as a sick 212 vs. Bust a Move mashup played in the background... learned a new mix thanks to that lol) ...but I'm in no rush to watch it yo and whether I use nice ol' Google or not I'll probably buy the Blu-rays at some point anyway as I love me some PP."
annakendrick,3d3iix,spanieldaniel,7,Mon Jul 13 21:25:34 2015 UTC,"She's got a small role in it, but I absolutely love Scott Pilgrim vs the World"
annakendrick,3d3iix,jesus_fn_christ,8,Mon Jul 13 13:45:14 2015 UTC,50/50 I'd say. That movie is funny but so deep.
annakendrick,3d3iix,ChrisMorrison93,4,Mon Jul 13 18:29:08 2015 UTC,"Indeed, made me laugh hard but also emotionally hit me hard. Genuinely really good movie, and one of the lesser known ones."
annakendrick,3d3iix,spanieldaniel,3,Mon Jul 13 19:05:34 2015 UTC,"Such a shame its lessor known. I mean its known but like not SUPER known. The acting was fantastic, even from Seth Rogan. Might have to go re watch it at the moment."
annakendrick,3d3iix,ChrisMorrison93,3,Mon Jul 13 19:12:05 2015 UTC,"Agreed; I've seen it a couple of times but ought to rewatch it again also, it's one of those movies that can be great to watch a few times (if it's up your alley ofc). Yeah, I love Seth as a funny guy in general but he really played the part well in this movie."
annakendrick,3d3iix,spanieldaniel,3,Mon Jul 13 20:49:33 2015 UTC,"Really good rewatch, it never gets old. But I think Seth did so well cause he was just playing himself, im sure you know why/the story behind the screenplay."
annakendrick,3d3iix,ChrisMorrison93,2,Mon Jul 13 23:00:59 2015 UTC,"From what I remember (I can look things up again to verify but anyway) the screenplay's loosely based on an inspired by Seth's own experiences of a good friend battling cancer right? That itself is wonderful (not wonderful that his friend suffered from cancer of course!!) in the sense of the film-making, in that Seth could draw upon his own real experience and emotions and play himself as you say, makes the film that bit more down-to-earth and moving; I really respect Seth for making this move and for a Hollywood film 50/50's great in that way, more gritty and legit than your standard flick."
annakendrick,3d3iix,spanieldaniel,7,Tue Jul 14 19:47:56 2015 UTC,Up in The Air. Then I'd say it's a tie between 50/50 and Pitch Perfect.
annakendrick,3d3iix,KJM321,3,Mon Jul 13 23:02:05 2015 UTC,"I love how you kinda of hate her in the beginning, she was annoying, she was that uppity type of girl you knew in school but then that pivotal breakup scene happens and then you slowly start liking her and pulling for her and just like the letter at the end, she totally wins you over! And that's the freaking B-story of the movie!?"
annakendrick,3d3iix,23_stab_wounds,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:07:08 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure I've seen all her movies....except the end of the world one (and the Twilight franchise), but I remember being exposed to her for the first time in Up In The Air. I was watching it for George Clooney and by the end of the film I was googling Anna Kendrick.   She never even had any typical sexy/love interest role, I was just wowed by her performance and was a fan from then on."
annakendrick,3d3iix,jobiwonkinosi,6,Thu Jul 16 02:47:35 2015 UTC,"Saw her in Happy Christmas a few weeks ago, and she was tremendous in that. The improv style of film making used in the film really suited her acting style."
annakendrick,3d3iix,spanieldaniel,2,Mon Jul 13 16:35:42 2015 UTC,"Cheers for mentioning, interested in watching this one now."
annakendrick,3d3iix,jobiwonkinosi,3,Mon Jul 13 19:04:55 2015 UTC,"There's another film she did in the same style with the same director (Joe Swanberg) that's pretty cool too. It's called Drinking Buddies. I prefer Happy Christmas, but Drinking Buddies is worth a look!"
annakendrick,3d3iix,spanieldaniel,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:39:12 2015 UTC,"Ah, I've heard about Drinking Buddies also, I ought to give both a watch, cheers!"
annakendrick,3d3iix,KJM321,2,Tue Jul 14 18:43:20 2015 UTC,"Just so you're aware, the film is really anticlimactic. It ramps up all of these plot points, takes a long time to explain them, and then it just kind of ends. No resolution for anything that happened. Nobody changes. It's kind of just watching people talk. It's interesting talking, but it doesn't lead anywhere."
annakendrick,3d3iix,spanieldaniel,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:52:39 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the heads up, I won't set my expectations too high for that then (I don't generally for these kind of films anyway lol). I've been disappointed I suppose with many a film in that way before, though I can still have an entertaining time with the movie with what's actually there even if it does just amount to 'watching people talk' as you say, like a slice of life flick."
annakendrick,3d3iix,bergamot47,5,Tue Jul 14 18:47:28 2015 UTC,Rocket Science then 50/50
annakendrick,3d3iix,xPyromania,2,Mon Jul 13 13:09:12 2015 UTC,"Rocket Science feels like Anna just talks too fast too understand what's she talking about :D, don't know how many hours of rehearsal took to do that, it's just fkin amazing, btw Reece Thompson was amazingly good too, I just loved watching those two"

annakendrick,3d3iix,spanieldaniel,2,Mon Jul 13 06:18:06 2015 UTC,/r/watchitfortheKendrick needs to be a thing
annakendrick,3d3iix,hex1031,4,Mon Jul 13 21:25:56 2015 UTC,movie? probably Scott Pilgrim. performance? either The Last 5 Years or Happy Christmas.
annakendrick,3d3iix,spanieldaniel,2,Mon Jul 13 20:17:07 2015 UTC,"I haven't seen all of the movies she's in but I've seen a fair number, and 50/50's probably my personal favourite (as a film by the way, not in terms of Anna's role, though don't get me wrong she's fab in this), followed by Pitch Perfect, which was surprisingly enjoyable (my dad and I decided to watch 'Pitch Perfect' one night thinking we were going into a baseball movie... we both actually thought it was brill, I've seen it a couple times since). Up in the Air's also pretty great. I know she's not in it a great deal but nevertheless Scott Pilgrim vs. the World's one I need to watch (especially as I loved the graphic novels as a kid)."
annakendrick,3d3iix,hex1031,2,Mon Jul 13 19:00:19 2015 UTC,Scot Pilgrim is fantastic. it's got a cool cast too. so many great people in that.

annakendrick,3d3iix,marshmallowwisdom,2,Wed Jul 15 18:59:35 2015 UTC,50/50. That's where I really noticed her. She was also good in End of Watch.
annakendrick,3d3iix,Decssmith,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:37:22 2015 UTC,"Massive fan of her,seen everything she's done. For me it's either Pitch Perfect,Rapture Palooza or The Last Five Years."
annakendrick,3d3iix,PerryPilgrim,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:43:41 2015 UTC,"Althought her role is very small in it End of Watch is insane. Also Drinking Buddies is a good film. The voices is terrible but purely watched it because she is in it. Both Pitch Perfect's are incredible. 50/50 was okay. Rapture-Palooza was surprisingly funny and worth a watch. Into the woods is good as James Corden kills his roll and Anna in a princess dress is what we all want to see. Life After Beth is okay, worth the watch again purely because on Anna. That's all I can think of now. I've seen a lot more with her in but I've drawn a blank!"
annakendrick,3d0n7l,jobiwonkinosi,4,Sun Jul 12 14:54:15 2015 UTC,That's actually a regular sized sofa and she is just really tiny

annakendrick,3cxbnw,jobiwonkinosi,5,Sat Jul 11 16:39:04 2015 UTC,That reminds me!  The wife is finally out of town so I think I shall finally watch Rapture-Palooza.  Apparently it's hard to justify for legit cinematic reasons.
annakendrick,3cxbnw,JohnnyMnemo,8,Sat Jul 11 22:30:50 2015 UTC,It was difficult to get through. I recommend a strong adult beverage and getting out your AK-fanboy hat.
annakendrick,3cxbnw,pedantum,3,Sat Jul 11 22:37:46 2015 UTC,"See, I mentioned this a while back, and I got hit with a downvote brigade. Seems as though this sub will not make up its mind about this movie.   I thought it had a lot of potential, but the script was fucking awful, and they had pretty much no budget for the movie. It could have been a cool Zombieland-esque movie, but the script was just terribad."
annakendrick,3cxbnw,KJM321,3,Sun Jul 12 04:16:10 2015 UTC,"But that white dress!  Also free on Amazon Prime.  Nevertheless, both good policies.  Thanks!"
annakendrick,3cxbnw,JohnnyMnemo,4,Sat Jul 11 22:39:13 2015 UTC,"Oh, she's great in it, and there are some funny scenes, but it's very much a case of /r/WatchItForThePlot."
annakendrick,3cxbnw,pedantum,2,Sat Jul 11 23:05:33 2015 UTC,Rapture-Palooza is quite bad. Perhaps the worst movie AK has done. I think she's pretty embarrassed about it too.
annakendrick,3cxbnw,hex1031,4,Sat Jul 11 23:59:29 2015 UTC,You must not have seen The Mark Pease Experience or Elsewhere
annakendrick,3cxbnw,This_Is_The_Life,3,Sun Jul 12 01:12:58 2015 UTC,"Nope. Those are pre-Up in the Air right? I only really started following Anna's career since that came out. I'm not really familiar with her work before that, although I've seen snippets from camp and rocket science. I'll have to go back and check out some of her older films sometime.  I should say as well that I'm not including any of the Twilight films, because she has such a tiny role in them. Otherwise they'd be the worst."
annakendrick,3cxbnw,hex1031,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:40:05 2015 UTC,"Elsewhere I could understand being terrible, it was almost Lifetime bad  The Marc Pease Experience I was excited to see because she starred alongside Jason Schwartzman and Ben Stiller but GOOD LORD that movie was terrible."
annakendrick,3cxbnw,This_Is_The_Life,2,Sun Jul 12 03:03:00 2015 UTC,"Both of those films are easily worse than Rapture-Palooza. I would even wager that What To Expect When You're Expecting is worse. If you take it for what it is - a crass, low standards, terrible low budget comedy - it's not the worst way to spend 90 minutes."
annakendrick,3cxbnw,deathcabforkatie_,2,Sun Jul 12 06:26:48 2015 UTC,"fuck. I completely forgot about What To Expect When You're Expecting. what a shit film that was. Anna's scenes were good but the rest of the film was unwatchable. yeah, that one's worse than Rapture-Palooza. damn, Anna's been in some shit movies hasn't she? girl needs to get some better scripts!"
annakendrick,3cxbnw,hex1031,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:29:52 2015 UTC,"Ok, just got done.  It wasn't that bad.  But when your expectations were low going in, it helps.  Also I took your advice and prepared a couple of cocktails for the occasion (hellfires, in keeping with the theme:  spiced rum, ginger beer, tabasco, and pilsner beer).  And, fuck, that white dress.  Really, the sexual innuendo of the movie was about on par with the general tone of this sub."

Just seems to me like it wouldn't generate as much interest if its release was held back a few years; this flick's not life Half Life 3 where it's an IP that already has a large dedicated fan following, that likely won't die down over the coming years, that could anticipate and retain interest in something like this for a long time (the 'hype' potentially intensifying), for crying out loud haha. I'm sure they have their reasons, and yes they're a business but what's in their best interests is just screwing over the fans. Boo. Hiss.

I understand she is  attractive but not for me much like Angelina Jolie. So subs of r/annakendick what makes her atractive?
annakendrick,3bhqkt,cagneyhorn,8,Mon Jun 29 16:31:53 2015 UTC,"I'll speak up as someonewho didn't get the hype for awhile. For me it is her unique look coupled with her incredible personality.

annakendrick,3bhqkt,jred250,3,Mon Jun 29 18:49:27 2015 UTC,"She is really cute, and has a good body, not like other starlets, but very feminine and attractive, however like many have said, while she is cute, it's her personality that makes her shine above some others, then you watch more and more of her movies and interviews and really enjoy them, until one day you just realize that you have a big crush on her, as a matter of fact, my hollywood crush was Scarlet Johansson, since she is well really hot, but nowadays even if you could say that Scarlett is sexier than Anna, i have become a huge Anna fanboy because all i've said before.  But in the end, to each of its own of course."

I'm not one of those people. I think she's beautiful. I'm just saying we're in the minority. most of her fans are young teenage girls. i think most guys just don't go for her.

You keep saying how you're this artist and film maker, if that's true then you should be meeting lots of people all the time. Go out and socialize. Meet new people. Date real women instead of obsessing over some actress you'll never even meet. It'll be good for you."

I hope she doesn't get stuck in a rut doing the same types of characters/movies. I used to think she had such range. Anyway, obviously I realize that I'm making all kinds of early assumptions.

She seems like a genuinely fun person, but probably forced to make up stupid shit for media outlets who want their 30 second sound bites of ""oh look how quirky and clever Anna is."" But she seems very serious and focused about her acting, which she is very good at. The endless press releases and marketing are just something that go with the territory. I'm sure she likes the attention, but also sometimes wishes she could just sit on the couch and binge Netflix and snacks like the rest of us."
annakendrick,3957ws,bergamot47,5,Tue Jun 9 12:55:24 2015 UTC,Just realized how rambling that was. My bad.
annakendrick,3957ws,bergamot47,5,Tue Jun 9 12:55:56 2015 UTC,She does binge watch Netflix and eat snacks like the rest of us.
annakendrick,3957ws,MalenInsekt,7,Tue Jun 9 15:11:04 2015 UTC,She has realized that the magic bullet is authenticity. Therefore she simply is what she appears to be.  ( a very smart funny chick enjoying life ). It's refreshing. Plus she is pretty and precious in a particular way. You can almost smell the heather.
annakendrick,3957ws,AjBlue7,3,Tue Jun 9 20:53:11 2015 UTC,"Its one of those things that once you understand how the system works, you can't unthink it. There are plenty of actors who seem genuine in interviews and panels, as a fan, you really want that actor to be exactly like their roles. There are a couple people that come to mind, where it seems like they don't really try hard to become a character and instead put their personality into the character (which I would assume is only because its easier for them).   I really hate watching interviews of most of my favorite characters, there are a couple people that are great no matter what, but for the most part in interviews the actor side of the actor comes out and you can see that they are just really boring people that are two obsessed with the artform of acting.   I think similar thoughts when I'm watching a movie that has anything to do with a technical field like being a doctor, I just can't help breaking the illusion and thinking about how the actor doesn't understand anything of the jibberish they are spouting out. Its very conflicting, because they give such good preformances that half of my brain is telling me its real and wants to believe its real (for the sake of entertainment) and the other half won't stop reminding me that it isn't real. There is just something about the technicality that makes me hyper aware of the fact that they could never do what their character does, in real life.   But in reality, I think it is too harsh to assume that actors are just putting on a character for interviews, because, don't normal people do the same thing? I feel like everyone tries to manipulate the light other people see them in. Some people take it too far and try to be someone else entirely, but most people just alter their selves a little bit, which is exactly what I think most actors do."

After the battle of Agincourt and the horrible slaughter of their knights by English archers, the French made a practice of cutting off those two fingers of any Englishman they caught. No more longbow for you, mon ami. So when you saw a Frenchman you showed him those two fingers. Fuck you. Still got 'em."
annakendrick,37pe5c,averyvalidusername,8,Fri May 29 19:04:50 2015 UTC,"Actually, that's a myth."

annakendrick,37pe5c,averyvalidusername,3,Sat May 30 00:19:00 2015 UTC,Who cares what Winston Churchill believed if there's very little evidence of the gesture existing before the 20th century?
annakendrick,37pe5c,averyvalidusername,0,Sat May 30 02:40:37 2015 UTC,"There's very little evidence of anything at all from those ancient times.  But the English longbows did inflict something like murder upon the cream of the French aristocrats. The hatred and fear of them was very real. The gesture is exclusively English, originates far back in time, and the explanation is extremely convincing.  That is as good as any proverbial cultural history you are going to get. Sorry I cannot provide a photograph of king Harry flicking a V sign at the frogs. But in my heart I know he did."
annakendrick,37pe5c,jyhwei5070,1 point,Sat May 30 09:31:28 2015 UTC,"The battle of Agincourt was in 1415 not ""ancient times"" and the details of the battle are recorded by chroniclers. The only mention of cutting off of fingers and the likely cause of this myth is in Jean de Wavrin's chronicle of the battle. He viewed the battle from the french side and mentions some french soldiers bragging about cutting of 3 fingers on the right hand of longbow-men on page 203 of this document. He also doesn't mention any derogatory gesture relating to the fingers either. Add that to the fact that the gesture wasn't even mentioned or documented until the early 20th century and it seems quite obvious that the idea that the two finger salute originating at the battle of Agincourt is a myth."
annakendrick,37pe5c,annaleigh1113,0,Sun May 31 01:56:21 2015 UTC,"Dude, 1415 is pretty ancient. There wasn't a lot of writing going on except monks and kings. OK so you can't find documented proof. I agree. You also would be hard pressed to find written proof of the moon landings by examining the diaries of one person who lived in the 70s. That doesn't mean they didn't happen. Like I say, it's colloqiual history. You can believe it, not believe it. It's up to you."
annakendrick,37pe5c,JohnnyMnemo,1 point,Sun May 31 06:50:08 2015 UTC,"Except that we're not looking at one person's diary. For one we're looking at chronicles which, unlike a diary, are documents with the express purpose of recording important historical events, not personal ones, so if we weren't to find the moon landing in the 20th century version of those that would be worrying. Two, we're looking at all the chronicles of the event and only finding one instance of something remotely related to fingers in all of them. Three, if there was a finger cutting effort large enough to cause such a widespread response it probably would have been mentioned. And lastly, no it doesn't mean it absolutely didn't happen but it's so unlikely that believing it over the far more likely explanation of a cool sounding patriotic myth is a little ridiculous."
annakendrick,37pe5c,jyhwei5070,0,Sun May 31 15:21:33 2015 UTC,All I know is that it predates the WW2 usage and the popular myth is the best explanation I have heard. It's a strangely unique symbol for 'fuck you'. Why do you think it exists?
annakendrick,37pe5c,jizzonherarms,1 point,Sun May 31 15:58:03 2015 UTC,"I have no idea, it's quite unclear. I do know however that the symbol predates the agincourt story by quite a bit so it seems to me that someone came up with the story as a way to explain an unknown rather than as a result of any actual basis in fact."

annakendrick,37u9hs,Sarkilas,13,Sat May 30 13:10:17 2015 UTC,"There's no sources or any details, just blind accusations. Such gossip is just text without meaning, and should, unless stupid, be disregarded until solid proof is presenting itself, which they definitely do not have.  I hope people aren't taking posts like these seriously. Now I know of another site to avoid completely."
annakendrick,37u9hs,Pandafy,-13,Sat May 30 14:44:52 2015 UTC,It's coming up high on Google. It is getting read. Many people may not have enough background knowledge to see it for what it is. Why should they get away with it? I want to know who wrote it and who OKd it.
annakendrick,37u9hs,ehhhwutsupdoc,5,Sat May 30 15:01:04 2015 UTC,"Dude. Calm down. This literally doesn't matter. Some random person can just write anything online. The only reason it's high on Google is because it's riding the coattails of her piece with Peter Travers, where she likes to do a bit about how much of a diva she is."
annakendrick,37u9hs,ehhhwutsupdoc,-10,Sat May 30 16:35:32 2015 UTC,I don't care about gossip. But this is a fucking hit piece. It's a bunch of fucking lies being used to generate money for a commercial site. Why should they get away with it.
annakendrick,37u9hs,ehhhwutsupdoc,3,Sat May 30 16:42:07 2015 UTC,lol you claim you don't care about gossip yet you took this piece to heart so much so that you want someone to track down the person who made this accusation. What would even be a possible action if the person is identified?
annakendrick,37u9hs,EverybodyChakaKhan,-4,Sat May 30 17:20:08 2015 UTC,To simply identify them would be great. A real flip. I would love to do that. A piece on them. With paparazzi style photos. The full treatment. Ha ha I would pay for that. In fact I will pay for that.
annakendrick,37u9hs,EverybodyChakaKhan,3,Sat May 30 17:22:47 2015 UTC,"Seems over the top. Even if you identified this person, wrote some nonsense about them it would have no effect on their life just like how what this person said has no effect on Anna Kendrick."
annakendrick,37u9hs,EverybodyChakaKhan,-5,Sat May 30 17:28:27 2015 UTC,It has an effect on me. I have no idea what Anna Kendrick thinks and neither do you
annakendrick,37u9hs,EverybodyChakaKhan,2,Sat May 30 17:29:36 2015 UTC,"You're right I don't know what she's thinking, but what I do know is this ""article"" has no basis for what it's saying. And what effect does it have on you?"
annakendrick,37u9hs,SackOfHellNo,-3,Sat May 30 17:35:55 2015 UTC,"it makes me shout ""Wankers!"" at the top of my voice sudenly"
annakendrick,37u9hs,SackOfHellNo,9,Sat May 30 17:39:04 2015 UTC,"I think one of the comments on that story hit the nail on the head. Rebel Wilson posted pictures of herself in front of a private plane when she was doing press in Europe like Anna was. I hate to admit, but I read gossip sites & blind items. Lately there have been 3 or 4 about Hailee Steinfeld that paint her as this wild drunken whore, then news about Rebel Wilson lying about her age comes out, now this with Anna.   I know having a successful movie means the spotlight is on you.... but all these news items about cast members coming out sound like a person with a grudge is writing them."
annakendrick,37u9hs,Badmouth55,-2,Sat May 30 13:52:29 2015 UTC,That's exactly why I would like to know who is writing them. Why should they have the protection of privacy? They are making accusations. Let's see who they are. Any decent reporter could find out.
annakendrick,37u9hs,Badmouth55,4,Sat May 30 14:19:36 2015 UTC,"I think I read on ""Gossip Cop"" that this story originated with OK Magazine. It's a gossip magazine in the UK. Don't think there's a US OK Magazine, but I'm not sure."
annakendrick,37u9hs,iamshepard,3,Sat May 30 15:14:50 2015 UTC,"Gossip Cop is a site that calls out gossip as being untrue.   http://www.gossipcop.com/anna-kendrick-diva-private-jets-luxury-suites/  In the story they talked to her publicist who said OK magazine asked her about it and she told them it wasn't true. They ran with it anyway. Not damage control, the website copied the story from OK magazine."
annakendrick,37u9hs,iamshepard,-1,Sat May 30 15:23:53 2015 UTC,Thanks for pointing that out. It's actually a great site. Duh.
annakendrick,37u9hs,jeffraider,2,Sat May 30 15:28:37 2015 UTC,"I'm not understanding your point. Did you read Gossip Cop's story? It's saying Anna IS NOT a diva. They call out OK magazine for lying. They do that with gossip sites and gossip magazines. They rate everything on how true it is, this story about Anna is rated a zero, meaning there is no truth to it.  I'm not sure you're reading everything all the way through. The site you linked to is called Celebrity Dirty Laundry. They're taking the OK magazine story and posting it like it's their own. They're helping to spread the rumor, but they're not the originator of the rumor. That's OK magazine and their ""source."" The Gossip Cop site is saying the rumor is untrue, so I'm not sure why you're attacking the site that's on Anna and Anna's fans side."
annakendrick,37u9hs,jeffraider,5,Sat May 30 16:09:57 2015 UTC,"I remember Taylor Swift talking about how a lot of potential relationships didn't work because the press automatically said ""Taylor is now dating this person!"" and it put stress on the guy. She's actually only had a few real boyfriends (I think she said this in an interview with Vogue, or whichever magazine she recently guest-edited). Unless you see it for yourself, don't believe it. Watch Anna's behavior on interviews. She does like to talk a lot. But that's probably just how she is. Gossip columns LOVE making something out of nothing, and people EAT IT UP."
annakendrick,37u9hs,jeffraider,-13,Sat May 30 15:46:15 2015 UTC,Stop changing the subject. This has nothing to do with Taylor swift. Anna Kendrick 'talks a lot'? Really? Are you connected with these scumbags in some way?
annakendrick,37u9hs,dapperdabber1,7,Sat May 30 15:55:24 2015 UTC,"""Changing the subject""? Interesting. I provided the example of Taylor Swift in order to demonstrate that you must weigh actual words of the person against the lies the media tells. Yes, Anna talks a lot. It's adorable, and endearing. Not everybody agrees, especially the leaches in the media. Please don't take what I say out of context. It's no better than the media."
annakendrick,37u9hs,damnbish2,5,Sat May 30 15:19:28 2015 UTC,"Dude... white knight harder, maybe she will notice you."
annakendrick,37u9hs,dapperdabber1,-4,Sat May 30 15:26:32 2015 UTC,If I want her to notice me I'll send her a script. Now piss off.
annakendrick,37u9hs,dapperdabber1,3,Sat May 30 15:39:31 2015 UTC,Lmfao. This kid.
annakendrick,37u9hs,xxx1590,5,Sat May 30 17:15:01 2015 UTC,"Reading OPs responses is a bit absurd, I'm pretty sure Anna can cope with a bit of baseless slander. Relax. Its not for us to hunt down every asshole who wants to paint every popular celebrity as the next pretentious bitch.   You've stated that its rising on Google results, you posting it here is likely a good portion of its traffic. If you wanted to make this go away just ignore it."
annakendrick,37u9hs,EverybodyChakaKhan,-5,Sat May 30 17:18:23 2015 UTC,"Would you feel the same way if somebody was posting slanderous lies about your sister?  Why the fuck does Anna have to just 'put up with it'. Because she made a success out of herself?  NO. This shit is out of date. 21st century new flavor. Post LIES, expect consequences."
annakendrick,37u9hs,xxx1590,5,Sat May 30 17:19:27 2015 UTC,"Of course not but Anna Kendrick is neither of ours sister. She is a very popular celebrity I enjoy the work of.  Look, I understand this is angering you but you need to take a breath and gain some perspective. One article written by some random nobody on an irrelevant website is going to have no impact on her reputation or wellbeing. This shit happens every day to lots of popular people. She doesn't need a group of people running around on the internet hunting one asshole in the name of vigilante justice. We've seen reddit attempt that before and we all know how that goes"
annakendrick,37u9hs,EverybodyChakaKhan,-7,Sat May 30 16:19:23 2015 UTC,"I didn't suggest any kind of vigilante justice. I merely want to know who posted the 'story'.  You may say it doesn't matter, but you are wrong. They are like rats or cockroaches. When you see one, you kill it. You don't let them gain confidence.   It may be normal for other celebrities to be trashed and humiliated, but I think the line should be drawn somewhere.   I'll find out who the cunt is."
annakendrick,37u9hs,Mr_Pee_Pee,6,Sat May 30 16:37:31 2015 UTC,It's me. I'm the one that leaked that shit. Now you can relax.
annakendrick,37u9hs,Mr_Pee_Pee,-3,Sat May 30 16:44:52 2015 UTC,"A leak contains factual information. Leaks have a purpose, sometimes worth doing. Pissing all over my favorite actress serves no purpose except to annoy me."
annakendrick,37u9hs,britchesss,6,Sat May 30 17:06:19 2015 UTC,Yeah I did it to piss you off. You mad?
annakendrick,37u9hs,SackOfHellNo,-6,Sat May 30 17:23:36 2015 UTC,not mad. sick of. this is my internet. I live here. Those cunts are stinking up the place

annakendrick,37u9hs,GentlyWithAChainsaw_,3,Sat May 30 17:36:56 2015 UTC,"Man, I hate this kind of gossip.  This is an attempt to hurt Anna's brand. I get that this kind of stuff ""comes with the job"" but she seems to work really hard at staying grounded in a business that can be complete madness.  Not saying she's a saint, but this is some bullshit."

annakendrick,37loz2,BZJGTO,10,Thu May 28 23:04:42 2015 UTC,"However, she can look so damn good while trying to play beer pong!"
annakendrick,37loz2,nucky6,14,Fri May 29 03:24:16 2015 UTC,"To be fair, whatever I just witnessed was not any beer pong I've ever played."
annakendrick,37loz2,BZJGTO,5,Fri May 29 01:53:41 2015 UTC,you're not supposed to bounce the ball in beer pong she was the only one who knew that
annakendrick,37loz2,nucky6,7,Fri May 29 03:27:46 2015 UTC,"Bouncing is pretty common in beer pong.  Most games I've played a bounce counted for two cups, but once the ball touches anything, the other team is free to swat/block it.  Sometimes a bounce still just counted for one cup, really just depending on who/where we were playing."
annakendrick,37loz2,Chocolate_Milk_Hotel,4,Fri May 29 04:23:42 2015 UTC,I know bouncing is common...i play with bouncing but thats not the main way of scoring bouncing is a strategic move that gives you 2 cups if made but the opponent is allowed to swat on a bounce.

Other than that I don't see it happening and she might not be what she seems. I mean who is? Most of my friends think I am a nice guy even tho I think I am kind off a dick, and that's my friends, not fans watching me in movies or interviews. But I do wish her all the best and hopefully we get to see her in a good romantic movie soon, it was really cute in 50/50 with Joseph but Anna didn't get to appear there much. Something like that just more... relationshipy would be nice."

It feels less intimate or personal.  This definitely feels like a Hollywood movie, where the first one felt almost indie.  I also preferred the soundtrack to the first movie - the riff off is still the highlight of Pitch 2 for me, but it felt less natural and more ""Sing 8 bars of a song everyone knows"" - loved the one liners, though... And enjoy the film as a whole."

A spectacular successful experiment in advanced cuteness and likeability.  Her total effect is vastly greater than the mere sum of her parts.  It's called synergy.

annakendrick,34qke9,EverybodyChakaKhan,2,Tue May 5 12:30:42 2015 UTC,It probably happens occasionally if you do it that often.  He probably took a few before he noticed and then changed the battery.   Usually he probably just wouldn't submit them but I guess he thought these turned out good enough that someone might want to use them.

annakendrick,33wmhn,ShawTheatre,15,Sun Apr 26 10:30:56 2015 UTC,"I think I just commented on another post you made about this pic on a different thread, but... It's her. This was a part of ""The Fappening"" leak. Though it wasn't really a leak because she had uploaded most if not all of those pics to her Photobucket account. (I don't think she has it anymore.) Someone then hacked that account and uploaded the photos. I'm pretty sure I saw all, or at least most of the photos that were ""leaked"" years ago."
annakendrick,33wmhn,EverybodyChakaKhan,-22,Sun Apr 26 10:35:37 2015 UTC,That didn't happen during the Fappening. These pictures have been around long before that.
annakendrick,33wmhn,soren121,8,Sun Apr 26 10:40:05 2015 UTC,"That's why I wrote, ""I'm pretty sure I saw all, or at least most of the photos that were ""leaked"" years ago."""
annakendrick,33wmhn,EverybodyChakaKhan,-16,Sun Apr 26 11:00:33 2015 UTC,"And you also said it was a part of The Fappening leak. I'm saying it was not; Anna was not among those targeted. Some people dug up these photos again around the same time because some losers desperately wanted to see her naked. It was unrelated, though."
annakendrick,33wmhn,soren121,2,Sun Apr 26 14:58:59 2015 UTC,"I understand that. But it was timed at the same time as another leak from The Fappening and was included in every single story all around the world in every newspaper and website that reported on the third leak. Best of my knowledge none of those sites corrected those stories, nor do I recall anyone involved in hacking her Photobucket account coming forward to say, ""Hey guys this wasn't part of the Fappening."" All of the articles written about the 3rd leak include her on the list, she is forever connected to it and those pictures. (Even though the pics weren't really part of the original Fappening hacks, she and her pics are forever included in the list of celebs that were ""hacked"" during ""The Fappening."")  I'm not sure what's hard to understand about that. It doesn't matter where they came from, they were timed and uploaded to all sites that released Fappening leaks from the 3rd wave. They came out at the same time, she's listed as a victim in all articles about those leaks. ""The Fappening"" included a ton of victims that didn't actually have their phones or Icloud accounts hacked, but they too are forever considered a part of the event. Why? Because it was about more than one certain type of hack, it was about the privacy of celebs being invaded in a huge way. Doesn't matter how or where her pics came from... she had made those pics private at some point. She shared them years ago, but then decided to take them down. Someone hacked in to her photobucket account or saved all of them when they were originally posted and uploaded them even though she had clearly tried to take them down or block people from seeing them years ago. You could argue whether or not we can say her privacy was really invaded when she made all of the pics available publicly originally, but ""The Fappening"" while used originally for a particular type of hack and leak, became a catch all term for the debate about privacy and whether or not celebs can or will ever have any privacy.  That got too long. I do that a lot. Sorry."

She uploaded a bunch of pics there before she was anywhere near as famous as she is now. It's not really ""ripped from somebodies cellphone,"" it's originally from her cellphone then she uploaded them to Photobucket. When she got a bit more famous she locked the account if I remember correctly. Then someone hacked the account and uploaded all the photos as part of ""The Fappening."""

annakendrick,30xfyb,psyFungii,3,Tue Mar 31 23:49:34 2015 UTC,"So lovable.  But I'd like to see her do serious drama.  Her and Emma Watson bitchslap/scream at each other over EW's character's plans.  Then Emma Stone turns up and...  fuck, Hollywood writers got all this to work with and we get ""I am Groot"".  FFS!"
annakendrick,30xfyb,psnow85,3,Tue Mar 31 20:32:49 2015 UTC,Love this photo shoot she did. One of them is my desktop wallpaper :)

annakendrick,30tva5,ToastyMango,4,Mon Mar 30 17:50:32 2015 UTC,It's really annoying me that nobody shopped the top of her head back in yet.
annakendrick,30tva5,KJM321,4,Tue Mar 31 00:04:57 2015 UTC,5760 x 1080 for my triple screen friends. :)
annakendrick,30tva5,dantheman9283,4,Fri Apr 3 01:09:19 2015 UTC,Waiting for there to be a .gif of this where she looks up directly into the camera.
annakendrick,30tva5,DrewsephA,2,Tue Mar 31 14:35:30 2015 UTC,Awesome! Thanks for this!

annakendrick,30t0s0,soupislife,5,Tue Mar 31 03:09:38 2015 UTC,"But to me, a yellow smile wouldn't be as appealing. But it's Anna Kendrick so that's a win. Positive vibes everywhere!"
annakendrick,30t0s0,KendallBlakeCruse,4,Mon Mar 30 15:23:04 2015 UTC,I just melted.
annakendrick,30zrjy,GentlyWithAChainsaw_,3,Wed Apr 1 00:28:39 2015 UTC,Wrong Kendrick friend.
annakendrick,30zrjy,You_Hesitated,-3,Wed Apr 1 00:30:00 2015 UTC,"I think if you check your calendar you will find you are mistaken, and I'm not your friend, buddy."
annakendrick,30zrjy,You_Hesitated,1 point,Wed Apr 1 00:36:06 2015 UTC,"It's March 31st here. And I ain't your buddy, pal."
annakendrick,30zrjy,MrDrLemon,-2,Wed Apr 1 00:37:31 2015 UTC,"Not in most of the world.  Besides, I'm pretty sure Anna tweeted this to the rest of the cast of Pitch Perfect last week,  and I'm not your pal, guy."
annakendrick,30zrjy,MrDrLemon,3,Wed Apr 1 00:45:12 2015 UTC,Then why not mention it's a tweet of hers?
annakendrick,30zrjy,MrDrLemon,0,Wed Apr 1 01:07:44 2015 UTC,I did...
annakendrick,30zrjy,You_Hesitated,2,Wed Apr 1 01:11:28 2015 UTC,..I meant in the title?
