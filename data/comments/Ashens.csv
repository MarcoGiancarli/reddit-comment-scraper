Ashens,3drso9,applescanjump,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:15:10 2015 UTC,"I've seen something recently that has made me lose complete faith in humanity.  Coke are advertising a competition on the side of their drinks, in which you will potentially win a free Coke-branded selfie sticks.  Just let that sink in for a second.  This means two things:   Coke think that people will be enticed enough by an offer of free selfie sticks to show more brand loyalty than they normally would. Forget their previous offers of actual money, or at least something of monetary worth. People want coke-branded selfie sticks! Coke think that people are EVEN GOING TO WASTE THEIR TIME ENTERING A COMPETITION JUST TO WIN A FREE SELFIE STICK There are probably people walking around with Coke-branded selfie sticks ready to be obnoxious with them.   God I hate humanity.  EDIT: That Spanish Inquisition wasn't intentional, but I'm keeping it. Coke-branded selfie sticks have ruined my life so much that they have clearly broken my understanding of maths."

Ashens,3dokpv,Blackloch,14,Sat Jul 18 00:51:39 2015 UTC,YouTube encoding is terrible with higher quality video. It takes the brute force method of using a higher resolution to make any impact on quality(and it can screw with 4k quality too).

Ashens,3dokpv,Phlum,8,Fri Jul 17 23:59:33 2015 UTC,"http://imgur.com/hqxbc8Q is basically what I see.  Clears up after a couple of seconds.  Probably a combination of the crappy Android Twitter app (though you're the only one I follow who posts videos, so can't really tell if it's just yours or all videos) with a tablet that was $200 when it came out 2 and a half years ago. :P (1.5GHz dual-core, 1GB RAM, 1280x800 7"" screen with really nice viewing angles)  (EDIT: Annoyingly, when I try and view Vines in Firefox on the desktop via a vine.co direct link, all I get is the loading circle animation even with my blockers off. Going through your Twitter, though, it works perfectly in the browser and the video's crystal clear :/)"
