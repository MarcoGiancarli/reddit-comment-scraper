KitchenConfidential,3e46eo,mrtannerjones,2,Tue Jul 21 20:40:40 2015 UTC,"I don't work for a restaurant, but at a grocery store who uses these surveys. There are several reasons for it in my company. One, is they really want the customer feedback to help improve the shopping experience. In the last two years my company has been stressing the importance of customer satisfaction more than it ever has in the past.  The second reason is they want to be able to improve to a point where they can say they are best at customer service, and they need the ratings that people provide in order to do that. They also want to be able to look at each individual locations scores and notice any trends or ""opportunities"" in those stores.  I'm sure the reason that non-chain restaurants do not do this is because they do not need it. They do not need a survey to help them keep track of all the customers they serve because they do not have near the amount of customers that chains do. They can simply rely on customer feedback instead.   And, yes, if you leave a comment we do read them. In fact it is something that is passed out every day during team meetings. I hope that answers all your questions."

Well, this is why I love restaurants, because people are allowed to be 'people'.  What you need here is to assert your authority straight away. Be a leader. Why? Because those guys that don't respect you, they need a leader to be happy. Understand? Their mental well-being depends on you being a tough guy  I don't mean shout and scream. That's throwing a tantrum. What I mean is, as soon as you see a slight disrespect, say to that guy, firmly and calmly, 'in the office, now'.  Then, when you're alone, say 'do you have a problem taking orders from me?'  99% of the time, this lets them know straight away that you are their leader. You're not 'scaring' or 'abusing' them, or 'being a jerk'. You're being the leader that they, that your kitchen needs.  99% of the time, they'll say, 'no chef' and that's it.  You see, those guys aren't disrespecting you out of spite. They're testing their boundaries, just like a child testing boundaries by throwing tantrums. Parents who give the child whatever they want when they throw a tantrum will watch that child grow into an entitled, under-achieving loser. But parents who don't tolerate that behavior, instead lets the child have their tantrums, and only reward them with validation when they display good behavior, are raising a happy, mentally healthy, achieving person who works for life's rewards.  Same goes with you, sir. You let the disrespect slide, the workers will learn that you can be walked over. They will fail to learn discipline, respect, hard work, because you let it happen. But by asserting your authority, in a calm, controlled way, they know that they can RELY on you. That you will PROTECT them, REASSURE them, LEAD them. That gives workers a real sense of security and high morale that no bullshit start-up culture ever can.  You need to lead. At first, it will be uncomfortable. Confrontations are uncomfortable. But like I said, this is an opportunity for you to grow."

(she complained about not having a break after 3 hours work , and coming in and going to Timmy's for breakfast AFTER clocking in and then eating on the prep area)  I had to firmly tell her that ""that is not how kitchens work, you don't take a break when there are things to do, take a break when service is over and we are cleaned up."" She then started talking about employee rights and shit...   And the god damn eating thing! Luckily the Owner walked in and gave her quite the talking to.

If you want heat, add cayenne. Worchestershire and horseradish are great additions as noted above, as is yellow mustard.

KitchenConfidential,3dzftu,Jibaro123,2,Mon Jul 20 21:10:05 2015 UTC,See if you can whip up a vinegary-honey-mustard-ish type of sauce for fans of Carolina style...  I personally like a spicy-tangy sauce to compliment the sweet bark from the rub and melty-gooey pork fat. Mmmmmm....
KitchenConfidential,3dzftu,olov244,2,Mon Jul 20 21:22:28 2015 UTC,"I'd say go for the western style with little tomato (ketchup is usually what most people use), should have a nice sweet bite with the pork. The ingredients in Eastern style are Apple Cider Vinegar, Red Pepper Flakes, Black Pepper, Hot Sauce (texas pete is best), brown sugar, salt. The western style is very sweet and uses basically the same ingredients as Eastern style but add Ketchup, Molasses, and a little Worcestershire Sauce. Don't really have the exact measurements off the top of my head because I just eyeball it - the joys of working prep and line in a BBQ restaurant in Raleigh for 3+ years - but I think both sauces are pretty hard to mess-up, so just aim for somewhere in the middle. If you want to get really special with it then you can add liquid smoke (be very careful not to add too much) and dry mustard."

KitchenConfidential,3dzk1g,imuswa,5,Mon Jul 20 20:22:47 2015 UTC,"I agree with /u/Gavin499 , Don't buy a set, pick individual knives that you know you need that suit your personality in terms of utility and your personal preference on looks.   For example, I own a basic vicotiranox bread knife, two different sized Japanese Gyutos (chef knives- one is 170 mm, the other 240mm), a Global pairing knife, a Japanese Yanagi and (because it was free) a Dexter boning knife (which i'll prob replace with a better one when I have more disposable income)   I got my knives party from local kitchen stores and mostly online (Amazon, Chef Knives to Go)   I have the CKtG knife roll that seems to be the best bag for the $.   The key is to try different knives out, figure out if you like light to heavy knives, japanese or western style handles, figure out your budget, etc. Also, unless you have a lot of $ to drop now, be painter and save up and buy individually- good knives aren't cheap- but don't have to be absurd either.   Finally- Don't go for Shun- they're pretty and they are decent quality but very overpriced because of their brand. You can get better japanese knives that are just as pretty if you go looking at more specialty kitchen stores if you can find one around where you live, or otherwise online. CKtG is a great resource, but there are plenty of other sites with other knives out there."
KitchenConfidential,3dzk1g,inoeth,6,Mon Jul 20 21:19:16 2015 UTC,"Don't buy a set. Depending on where you're located, there may be a good knife shop nearby, but even if not, you're better off (quality v. value) to buy individual pieces and make your own set. Let's be honest, a full ""set"" of knives makes me think you either got it from culinary school, or are too well off for me to think much of your skills. The most talented chefs I've worked with have a pieced together set of killer knives that do their individual job like a champ."

What I'm saying (and I think there are others who would agree), is that if somebody shows up in my kitchen with a nice shiny set of new knives, it's far from a testament to the ability of the person holding them. There are always exceptions, just speaking from my experience on the whole."
KitchenConfidential,3dzk1g,Gavin499,4,Tue Jul 21 00:34:16 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. But that's not what you said. You said: ""Let's be honest, a full ""set"" of knives makes me think you either got it from culinary school, or are too well off for me to think much of your skills.""  Too well off for any sort of skill.... How else can that be interpreted?  Once you see their skills, the knives they have are irrelevant. If you're judging people based on their knives, you're being petty.   Advising someone not to get a nice set of knives if the have the means and desire because idiots will judge them for it is insane."
KitchenConfidential,3dzk1g,stevehobbes,0,Tue Jul 21 00:40:46 2015 UTC,"I think I'll still stand by what I said originally. In that if somebody shows up with a shiny set of knives, they are USUALLY (not always) financially supported, but rarely (again not always) have the skills to back that up.  I agree that once the skills are evident, the rest is irrelevant, but I would still advise against getting a nice ""set of knives"" even if they have the means and desire. The fact that idiots will judge them is a side note. The reality is/remains that you'll get better value for the money if you buy a knife that the particular knife maker is good at. The knife maker that makes the best gyuto is rarely the same maker that makes the best butcher knife.  All things being equal, get what you can afford, but I'd love to hear if you think getting a set is the best way to get knives of the sort OP seems to be looking for, or if you're just arguing for the sake of it (a position I can respect, just asking)."

All you really need to start is a good 240mm, (japanese) something smaller, 120mm or a pairing knife.  Id also drop most of my cash on the 240mm as that gets used the most, and buy some victorinox knives as everyday knives, ones you can abuse but decent performers and not cry if it gets chipped. Shuns are average at best, also they are tempered too high (hrc) to use all the time and chip easily.  Shun is like buying a lexus, it looks expensive but its just a Toyota with a different name."

KitchenConfidential,3dzk1g,stevehobbes,2,Tue Jul 21 00:30:33 2015 UTC,"What this guy said is mostly true. However, if you like Shuns, check out the Tojiro DP line. Same steel, 2/3rds the price. For the money, the 210"" Tojiro gyoto is $53 on Amazon. Of all my more expensive Japanese knives, I use this one the most. But then I've put several thousand hours of prep on it now. Also love my Missano x-10, but always go back to the Tojiro.

Take a fantastic edge, sharpen once a week, clean and precise cuts all the time. I played football all my life and have huge hands, Tojiro makes very big western handles that just fit mine perfectly. If you like smaller handles and/or have smaller hands, look at the Fujiwara FKM line. As mentioned before, their petty is unbeatable of the price. I also like the Richmond knives from cktg, but they're stamped and a bit on the cheap side fit and finish wise, but my 240"" artifex stays sharp and cranks out my heavy prep when I need it. The Richmond nikiri was my knife for years, but I don't do as much precise veg prep these days so my toji 210"" is right back in the mix now that I'm a diner cook."

Idk xians famous foods paid like 13 an hour back then, now they're already paying 15 an hour for fast food work.  The food is like 6-8 bucks from what I remember. If they can do it I'm sure other places can too."
KitchenConfidential,3e1jo3,launderbasket,2,Tue Jul 21 07:29:50 2015 UTC,"I know for a fact from having worked as a bookkeeper at very highly regarded bakery with a celebrity chef to boot that as successful as they were, it would have been very difficult, basically impossible to pay their cooks more and their starting wage was $10/hr.   I'm not taking a political stance, just the fact of the matter is restaurants are such a low margin business that the only way to make any money is to get bigger (kind of like airlines). And that kind of scale would require having thousands of locations and a business that is vertically integrated, something that even the most successful or restaurants in New York pales in comparison to the actual scale they would need (the likes of McDonalds, Taco bell, Subway, pizza hut, Burger king, etc. already have and places like In-and-out, Chipotle, and Shake Shack are trying to achieve).   The worst thing that would happen to McDonalds is that their profits (Revenue - Cost) would go down so maybe their dividends would go down and stock prices fall, investors pull out, some stores close blah blah, but basically it can take a hit. Many restaurants in NYC would close down trying to pay $15/hr. The sad thing being that some of these small players are doing some cool stuff that could grow into something big and maybe at that time they could afford to pay $15, but if they try to compete in wages they will close even before they get their shot.   The flip side being, well wtf, just some ppl who've really studied and put a lot of time to cooking will be getting paid less than a cook who only has to assemble pre-made burger components and work the fryer?   But at the same time are they working any less hard? For less prestige? Most nice restaurants only cater to rich ppl anyway, I mean fast food workers feed the people. Doesn't that count for something? Is fine dining ridiculous? Should restaurant philosophies only be about feeding more people?   really is kind of an existential crisis if it happens, lot of interesting things could be said about it"
KitchenConfidential,3e1jo3,launderbasket,2,Tue Jul 21 07:52:01 2015 UTC,"Perhaps they had a ridiculously high overhead as many restaurant owners tend to have? Many owners spend hundreds of thousands to millions before even opening the place even for casual places, so they cut back on paying labor, pass costs into customers, etc. when they could've opted for a more sensible and modest path.  Look up xians famous foods, they have like 13 locations. They pay their ""cooks"" 15 an hour, so 1000s of locations is not really necessary as long as the store is generating that kind of revenue.  Expansion and growth is the name of the game. Growth is important in any business right?  True it would devastate many stores. But that's the direction New York is headed in anyway, it's been hard on small businesses for years now. It's a city for the megarich.  The talented and innovating guys end up leaving and vitalizing other cities.  The system is fucked up for sure. should've unionized to get better rights and better pay like other trades. At least make the waiters tip you out like in other states, shiet.  Learn to delegate? Idk, the whole system needs to be revamped, tbh.  just another challenge to tackle, I don't see this as crushing to the food industry, it'll just shift it."
KitchenConfidential,3e1jo3,Pavswede,2,Tue Jul 21 10:08:31 2015 UTC,"I don't know what's going to happen, but I suspect our industry won't change much - I doubt that anyone who is a half-serious cook will move into fast food for the stigma attached. Yeah, $15 is a few dollars more an hour than I and most line cooks here make, but who wants to deal with the mind-numbing fast food production?  New York is already a ripe city for line cooks - it's exactly because we're so underpaid that you can basically get a job anywhere you want. The whole city is understaffed as cooks move to cheaper cities where they make the same salary. Have a friend moving at the end of the year because he can't afford to live here (he and his wife rent a room in an apartment with another couple and live on the cheap). Considering such a move myself. If anything, I think it will just cause more cooks to flee NYC and this will finally turn salaries around.  The other issue is that Americans love to go out to eat and they don't want to pay for it. They want cheap food, large portions, and great service. This model is starting to fail - restaurants need to raise prices and follow in the footsteps of Amanda Cohen at Dirt Candy. According to her, the dishwasher starts at $15. Granted, she had a huge following and offers a very niche product that people are willing to pay for, but if the higher end restaurants would start doing this, the system can change. It's gotta be grass roots, though - people react poorly when the government shoves stuff like huge min wage hikes down businesses' throats, regardless of political affiliation.  Anyways, maybe i'm full of shit, but those are my two cents."

Every single review, regardless of the restaurant, fast-casual or fine dining, ALWAYS bitches about price. If these kinds of people aren't getting insanely huge portions they are going to complain about the price, and that keeps a ton of other dimwitted fools from ever trying new food.   It's time people who can actually afford to eat out on a regular basis to accept the fact that, yes, they are paying for that luxury."
KitchenConfidential,3e1jo3,sheriff_woody_pride,0,Tue Jul 21 20:44:00 2015 UTC,"Former NYC cook reporting in.  I now work in Australia, where staff are paid ENORMOUS amounts of money. $20 an hour for weekdays, $26/hour on weekends, plus 9% extra paid into your superanuation (Aussie 401k).  Sounds dandy? Well, the result is this:  Australian restaurants, when compared to the rest of the world, sucks balls....  Don't get me wrong, there are talented cooks and waiters here. But, those cooks have to also wash dishes on weekdays, when there are less business, thus a dishwasher cannot be afforded. They also have to clean fridges, cool rooms, put away produce...  Same with waiters, who also bus and run (there are no bussers and runners). During the week, there is only a supervisor and a waiter for the front. That's it. They host, take order, bus, run and bartend.  The result is that when people go out to eat, they know they will wait at least 10 minutes for a drink, 15 if you order cocktail. 15 minute wait for appetizer, 25-30 minutes if you only order main course.  Service is just terrible compared to America. You know why? Because people are simply not motivated to provide good service. American waiters fight for their tips. Australian waiters are entitled to ridiculous amount of money and rights (each shift must be at least 3 hours, sick leave must be honored, dismissal must be preceded by prior verbal AND written warning etc.). When I was in New York, my waiters complain that it's quiet. Here, waiters complain when it's busy. That's the culture.  Most importantly, for me that is, is that no matter how talented and experienced the cooks are, they just can't be the best they can be. There's not enough money to pay someone to shell peas, stem beans or other such time consuming jobs that will result in better food. So, compromises have to be made. Farm fresh produce that will require washing/stemming/shelling or whatever can only be afforded by powerhouses. I'm talking restaurants that are famous around the nation. Others will have to do with pre-packaged, average stuff. And that is what kills me.  Restaurateurs don't make profit here. Profit is like 5% if they are lucky. Instead, they work as head chef or GM and take a salary out of the business. So, why open a restaurant in the first place and have all the headache, when you can earn the same, sometimes more, by working somewhere else. You know what this is? This is red tape is what it is.  So, while I'm not a expert on economics and such, I know the kind of culture this creates. A culture of mediocrity, which is an important issue for me personally."

Its already being experimented with in certain select franchises. I'm not saying that people don't deserve a salary that you can live on, but McDonalds is not a career. You should not be working at McDonalds when you are 40. Its a job meant for high school and college kids looking to get some extra cash. Its not a skilled labor.

Do not let a beer run dry. Run food when it's hot. If salads or something comes out before food, make sure it comes out quick, so there's time to eat it before the table gets crowded. Be friendly but not best friends--polite and concise with a smile will get you tips without taking too long. Talk to your runners, expo, cooks if anything comes up--fixing a problem before it's a problem is the quicker route. Don't piddle away time at your station. Clean, prep, refill, anything but standing around talking. Help bus when tables leave--higher turnover means more chances for tips.

The bar doesn't care about tickets coming in on their side and the customers automatically get waters when they are seated. I do take orders all at once for the most part though. However, I do not ring them in all at the same tune. So for instance, I'll take four separate orders. I ring one order in. I take ketchups/mustards/malt vinegar to the table I rang in. Do a quick check up then go back to the pos and ring another order in. Roughly three/five minutes pass between orders. If I am seated again, I take their drink order, put another table's food order in, run drinks, take the new table's food order. The kitchen is happy, the tables don't feel like they're waiting forever to put their order in with me, I stayed organized....everyone is happy.   tl;dr: taking orders in batches can be done correctly in such a way that doesn't fuck the kitchen or my part of service either."

If slamming the kitchen is going to be worse for your ticket times than holding and pacing them, fine. But a rush is a rush. If you're slammed with tables suddenly, the kitchen will be too.   Say I got triple sat and then some and ended up holding five tables worth of orders. Order apps, and that one table with a well-done burger, and that two top of assholes that are ""in a hurry"". Do a lap of refills and waters, get a drink order from a new table, then put the rest in.  There is some economy of movement to be said about knowing you've got ten burgers all day at once. The person on pantry might rather make 7 salads at once than 2 at a time. But I work in a big place where a rush is a rush and it doesn't matter who the server is, the printer is going to be barfing tickets regardless."

It is a very nice program and is working great for my restaurant. It can generate food costs per recipe, track usages, and a lot more.   Before that we tracked everything in excel workbooks. I divided up the menu into different books and linked them to a master cost sheet. It was not perfect but worked. Access would be much better, but you have the headache of going threw and building the tables, making the relations, and building the queries and forms. he amount of effort that was going into costing updates took way to long before.  If you have a lot of menu items I would definitely recommend some professional software. It saves headaches and won't tie you up so you can work on other things. There are a few options and they do not cost all that much. If you are on the smaller menu side it might be beneficial to use excel sheets instead. Also Excel seems to have better data handling results when you use macros instead of sheet code."

KitchenConfidential,3dst9n,organisms,7,Sun Jul 19 06:31:12 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the well wishes folks!  I think I'm going to go the gourmet burger route.  For the last three years I've been working at an upscale burger bar and me and my crew dragged it up from not on the lists to top three in the city, number eight in the state.  So I can speak cheese burger pretty well. I'll keep my core menu small and give people the option of building their own to help cross utilize every scrap of goods on the truck.  I'm looking at one man to cook, one to take orders and handle money.  I know I can bust out fifty an hour with sides if I keep the menu tight and the cashier hands out the drinks. Eventually I'd like my wife to be the money handler, she's got a decade of FOH and she's easy to get along with, I just don't want her quitting her GM job until the truck is paying the bills. Charlotte NC is where I will be operating.  It's cold enough here in winters that I'm anticipating some serious soup sales when the time comes.  Meanwhile, I want to go after the office park lunch crowd.  It's high density office parks with a three hour lunch window.  Should be good crowds of bored people in a tie, and some of the biggest ones already have a rotation for trucks.  They like giving the employees the option. Only one other dedicated burger truck in town amazingly enough.  I don't see that as over saturation of my niche. As for striking a vein with the community...  Well a few months ago I posted in here about raising my personal profile as a chef.  I've been doing vblog interviews about cooking, charity events with tv spots, that sort of thing.  I've been trying to link myself a tiny bit in the public eye to tasty food.  I'm going to do my best to keep on the good side with the place I'm leaving as part of my claimed cultural heritage. (Chef of popular local burger joint goes solo, keeps up with hospice and burgers for joe charity) kind thing.  Press is good right? Couple things I struggle with you guys might chime in on.  Name the damn truck.  Voodoo burger?  Bite: burgers and tasty things? Burger Jam? Cheeseburger Technology?  I suck at naming things. What dessert can I scratch with low cold storage and limited cook space?  1 three foot griddle, two hvy duty fryers and a hot box.  Commis has everything, so I prep there, but truck is going to be limited."
KitchenConfidential,3dst9n,hockeyrugby,5,Sun Jul 19 13:21:52 2015 UTC,The soup thing really gets me excited! I am wondering if you can find a nice small brick and mortar prep space near an office that you can fling soup/chowder/gazpacho and chili from at different times of year from a window and do your burger prep from? It would probably keep the truck clean but increase your overhead by an employee (soup slinger) and rent.   I would be reluctant to put burger in the name of your truck because you may want to do other things too and it would be a shame if you find yourself doing an awesome lobster role being pigeon holed into doing that. How about naming it Reich's after the NC anthropologist who wrote the book that inspired Bones. That is one person I found interesting from NC but maybe a different person tickle your fancy and you may find cool to pay homage to... your parents maybe...
KitchenConfidential,3dst9n,Neo6488,3,Sun Jul 19 15:55:43 2015 UTC,Honestly the first thing I thought of with Reich was Hitler and the whole third Reich. Maybe stay away from that one. I do agree a general name is better though.

I can pump out a lot of food my myself if the menu is only a couple of things.  I've watched a couple of trucks open with a dozen items on the menu, and I think they kill themselves with prep.  If you can strike a vein with the community and you know what they want, you can get on top of it.  I think it really takes 2 people in the truck, one to cook and one to take the money.  And suddenly, you have employees..."
KitchenConfidential,3dst9n,Megan_Pizza,4,Sun Jul 19 08:59:24 2015 UTC,"Craft breweries/bars are your best friend especially as a burger truck. In my experience burgers do more at night than during office lunches. Look for places you can plug in as generator fuel can kill you on a slow day.   Set a minimum for private events and stick to it. Depending on your costs, $700 for a four hour service might not be worth it. The last truck I was on didn't start the engine for less than 1k.   Find a mechanic you trust that can come to you when you break down.   Best of luck."

I'm killing myself to establish this business, working around the clock, but it just feels totally worth it, especially when I get positive reactions to my food.   Just a word of advice though, prepare to work your ass off. And I'm not just talking cooking - sweating your balls off and pushing out food when you're up and running will be your vacation - I'm talking about everything else. Not sure where you live, but here in New Jersey everything is extremely difficult for mobile food vendors. There's a mile of paperwork for every. single. event. And, the cost is outrageous. But, I'm learning as I go. I'm learning how to maximize profits, how to lower food costs, which events to attend, which ones to avoid.  Just this last week at an event called Burger Mania my truck won best burger in central New Jersey. It feels so fucking fantastic to work towards your vision and see it come to fruition.

To me, if you can't offer time and a half and be profitable on a holiday, you shouldn't be open for the holiday.  The best system I've ever experienced for working holidays was at a pizza place.  The GM put up a list of all the positions that would need to be filled and offered time and a half.  If not enough people signed their names, the shop wouldn't open.  We had people for every single holiday because they made the choice that the extra money was worth it to them, no one had the decision thrust upon them.  Plus nobody could bitch about it.  Everyone's happy, restaurant still makes a little cash."

Your best bet on keeping him around is to do a man to man with him and ask him whether he is going to be able to finish out his term, or does he ""need"" to wrap up sooner. Phrasing it this way will allow him to be more honest with you, and his reaction to this will give you a decent indicator of his intentions. People will generally stick with what they have said they will do, but it's not an absolute.  For the people you have left on your crew, when they see somebody getting the shit work after giving notice, they're less likely to give notice when they want to leave. Do good by your coworkers. Someday you may be running your own menu and need quality hard working people. If you're a dick to them just because they want something better, hope for something better, why would they ever come work for you again?   Don't work salary. You're going to get fucked in any job, but when you work salary you can't see the extra effort turn into extra money. If you are on salary, expect you are expected to work when work is expected. You know, always. When you are hourly, expect that you will work when there is actual work to do. Be there when you are needed. Fill in when shit occurs. You're getting paid extra for that shit."

Explain to him that you are letting him go, immediately, explain to him why, hand him his check & say goodbye. Then get back to work. If he doesn't want to be there, he's not going to put in his full effort; better to just cut him loose, and make sure things are going to get handled.

KitchenConfidential,3do1ru,Kabibbles,44,Sat Jul 18 06:24:05 2015 UTC,"If someone told me to ""Dump the kettle"" I would probably be throwing whatever is in the kettle away. If you want something put in a new container, cooled, stored, then dont tell me to ""Dump it"" tell me to ""put that away and clean the old container"" or ""Break down the kettle station"" or something. In my state, the health code allows an item to be cooked, cooled, then reheated once, after that its considered dangerous and is to be thrown out. We break that rule a lot with certain things, but its completely reasonable to be throwing away a bunch of stuff after service.   Also, if the guy has never broken down whatever ""The kettle"" is then he probably shouldnt have been doing it alone and you should have put off your cigarette break till it was done, or asked him to wait till your back to deal with it."

KitchenConfidential,3do1ru,Arrdef,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:31:56 2015 UTC,"The rule only covers the time the food is left in the buffet trays. Cook time is usually higher than 64°C and is therefore not hit by the same rules  nvm: found something:  ""Dans tous les cas, le délai entre +63°C et +10°C doit être inférieur ou égal à 2 heures sauf pour les produits pour lesquels un protocole spécifique est défini (exemple : grosses pièces de viandes).""  ""In all cases, the time between +63°C and +10°C must be inferior or equal to two hours, except for the products for which specific protocols are defined (for example, big pieces of meat.)""  As you can see, the time limit covers only the time between serving temp and pre-storage temp (required temp being between 0 and 3°C for delayed consumption and inferior to -18°C for storage.)  For heated trays (we have those) that allow food to remain at +63°C, the time limit is generally 2 hours after cooking, but varying limits apply (for some ground beef, limit is 30 minutes, also eggs, ect...) for different circumstances. I can detail them if you want, I just have to translate the sheet."
KitchenConfidential,3do1ru,Kabibbles,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:52:14 2015 UTC,"2 hour limit is still pretty hard to maintain I would imagine. Most dinner services I have worked have been anywhere from 3-5 hours, that would mean every hot item would have to be refreshed at least once if not twice. That is a lot of small kettles of soup. Do you guys just keep a lot of stuff chilled and warm it for each order?   Its strange to see the varying rules each governing body has. In the States each state has their own rules. Then each county will make up their own little rules. Ive seen hats required in one city then they be optional in the next city over, same with gloves."

Like, it makes me feel good that I have a job that I enjoy overall and pays me well enough to keep my family fiscally secure, but the flip side is that I'm often an absentee partner and parent.  So when I wake up in the morning, I'm the one making breakfast for the kid and coffee for my partner. Even if it only ends up being a half hour of time I get with them, it's half an hour more than I would have had laying in bed trying to plan out what my day is going to look like.  When I get home at night, if the kid is still awake, I take them to bed, and then I spend some time with my partner where I try to be as present and engaged as I can be, even if all I want to do is pass out on the couch with my hand in a bag of tortilla chips.  It doesn't always work out and it's still fucking rough, but all that I've learned from the past ten years is that it really isn't enough to say FUCK YOU MY JOB IS HARD I HAVE NOTHING LEFT FOR YOU COME BACK AND CHECK IN ON MONDAY NIGHT WHEN I FEEL RESTED.

That being said, I could never go right to bed when I got home from a long night shift - I'd be up to 1 or 2 in the morning (my kitchen closes at 11) playing video games or otherwise not interacting with people.  One of my good friends has cooked his entire career. He's been with his wife since they were in highschool. She still doesn't understand when he puts in 16+ hours a day (especially now that he's a sous chef and on salary). They still have fights about it.  Never had that problem with my wife. Just maybe some scrambled calls to my mom to see if they can grab the kid until I get home.  Sorry for the wall of text, so I'll tl;dr here: I agree with other commenters: communication is key. Explain that you're exhausted, and all you want is a beer and bed. If he still can't understand that, then (creeping into /r/relationship_advice territory here) maybe reevaulate the relationship?"

KitchenConfidential,3dnvkw,TxCookin,3,Fri Jul 17 20:13:52 2015 UTC,Guarantee this is not intentional.  I have given raises and had the same problem.    Just go to the chef and say you were supposed to get a raise on the last check and it didn't go through this check either.    If the chef is reasonable he will ask if the back pay should be on the next check or if you need a fresh check sooner.    If he doesn't acknowledge the fact that you are owed back pay then you are in the wrong place.

KitchenConfidential,3do247,heyyouyeahyou55,6,Fri Jul 17 21:04:49 2015 UTC,"So first I would suggest that you ACTUALLY HAVE the food you're hoping to surround yourself with in the coming months.  Its good to know the product you're expected to push, be it in FOH or BOH.  Working in a restaurant is not easy or glamorous (coming from a cook's perspective, that is,) but as you'll most likely be a host your responsibilities will be more limited.  My best advice to you is to know the menu, know everything on it, each item's ingredients and what they all taste like.  Taking phone orders, people will expect you to give opinions/recommendations, and you'll only make your restaurant and yourself look subpar if you can't.    Good luck man, also /r/talesfromyourserver may be best suited for you, as this sub tends to focus more on the kitchen staff"

KitchenConfidential,3dkuio,pandakahn,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:42:25 2015 UTC,If you do it on a plancha or in a pan you could sprinkle some caraway seeds into butter before you lay down the tortilla. They would stick to the outside and toast up giving it a rye flavor.

There is all together too much liquid in both and they tend to quickly make your weed too moist to smoke.

KitchenConfidential,3dmoo3,phillydude619,3,Fri Jul 17 14:51:12 2015 UTC,"I've done this a few times, and it's a really frustrating process.  So much of our industry is based around what you can physically do with your hands that it's almost impossible to convey it through a resume.    I agree that you should put down how many covers you did on average, but I would recommend staying away from the smaller acclaims your restaurant has won.  While they're valuable to the restaurant itself, it comes off as though you have nothing else to talk about.    Say what station you worked, and say any notable skills you picked up while working there (Sous Vide, meat butchery, came up with daily specials etc.) Keep it short and to the point.  Chefs aren't generally impressed with flowery resumes that take three pages.  Keep it at one page if at all possible.   If you have only worked in two restaurants, just say that.  Don't primp it up to sound like something it isn't.    As for cover letters, unless you've got some serious experience writing them and have had success with it before, they're not going to work.  That's just more stuff for the Chef to read that doesn't really tell him/her the nuts and bolts information that they're looking for, like how many covers your can do.    When you send in a resume, just add a few lines of script saying that you'd love to stage for a night to see if the restaurant is a good fit. That way, the chef gets a free cook to help with service, and you get to see if the shop is someplace you'd actually like to work at.  If it's not, then you walk away no harm done."

KitchenConfidential,3dmfxb,tmight,3,Fri Jul 17 13:36:46 2015 UTC,"I like Blodgett and Hobart for ovens. The most important thing on the oven, other than the heating element, is the quality of the door hinges. First thing to always fail. Especially for a convection oven, as the door opening deactivates the fan.   Viking for the stovetop.   Find an old, refurbished deli slicer. The new slicers are junk. Avoid Globe. The action on a globe slicer is terrible and they are hard to clean. The fewer parts on a slicer the better.   Finally, can't recommend a specific brand for the cold tables, but I can tell you what I look for. Make sure the vent/air intake/air filter is of the highest quality. Clogged air filters are what cause cold tables to break. Make sure the air intake is well protected and away from the line, because that's where the junk comes from that clogs them.   Bonus: when you get your equipment, as in, the day it arrives, make a special binder with all of the booklets and the model names and serial numbers for each piece of equipment. When something breaks, and it will, the model names and numbers are the first things that the repair service will ask for. Knowing these expedites service and will save you time and money. Also, it makes you look smart in the eyes of the repair service and they will be less likely to rip you off.   Cheers and best of luck with your new kitchen!"

On slow nights test once halfway through to get an idea about trends and where you need to make adjustments. Always have something close by to drink if you need it. Eat a consistent staff meal. Don't skimp one day and overdo it the next. Never hesitate to tap out for 10 minutes if you need to, having a low blood sugar is like cooking drunk - it's hugely dangerous and irresponsible."

KitchenConfidential,3dks7g,larson00,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:43:32 2015 UTC,Look for a used knife.The investment in a good brand  is worth it in the long run. I have found people on ebay or at a second hand store  that have no idea what they have for sale. I got two Mac knifes at a swap meet for $3 they were dull as shit but sharpened up nice. I also found some gently used global knives on ebay for a decent price.

KitchenConfidential,3dk302,ForeignPacksMoarLoot,15,Thu Jul 16 22:21:52 2015 UTC,"Fuck that.  As long as you give 2 weeks notice, that's all you really have to do.  Offering to train your replacement isn't necessary, by any means.  The whole point of giving notice is to allow the boss time to figure something out before you leave... if they want to hire someone else to replace you, they have 2 weeks to do it.  If they want to use that 2 weeks to take another current employee, and have you train them in your position, they have that option.     Beyond giving notice, any decision on training your replacement is up to your boss... not you."
KitchenConfidential,3dk302,ChefGuru,7,Fri Jul 17 00:43:57 2015 UTC,Two weeks is plenty.  It's standard and it's  professional.  Your situations is just one of those stupid expectations that only are in our industry.

KitchenConfidential,3dk302,anarchir,2,Thu Jul 16 22:49:31 2015 UTC,"two weeks is more than enough. usually there is a replacement within 2 days, and in my experience by the end of the week everyone has checked you off. several times i've experienced animosity from coworkers, like i'm better than them because i'm moving on. fuck off."
KitchenConfidential,3dk302,larson00,2,Fri Jul 17 05:46:30 2015 UTC,"It depends on your rank.  The average notice for a line cook is somewhere between ""fuck you"" and a week.   A 2 week notice will suffice for most hourly employees.   If youre a manager, you might consider giving them more notice.  30 days isnt always practical, but it would be nice if you let them know asap.   If you're in good standing it will only make you look good.   For anyone higher than a line cook, id never hire them without them giving notice at their last place."
KitchenConfidential,3dk302,chefandy,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:02:15 2015 UTC,It's up to management to find and train a replacement.  It sounds like this guy is mad that he'll most likely be working some extra hours to fill in the gap in the line until your replacement is trained.

If the owners think that they can run your kitchen better than you and your chef because they can watch cameras all day, then you're fucked if the executive cannot have trust in you to run your kitchen."
KitchenConfidential,3deaqr,YCYC,18,Wed Jul 15 18:09:59 2015 UTC,"That's the thing.  The kitchen in reality has no problems.  Strong staff, kitchen shines like diamonds, food safety is followed damn near perfectly and food is prepared and cooked really well.  I could see them needing the cameras if people were getting sick, food was being stolen or their were obvious signs of laziness or neglect.  The Chef and I run a tight ship back there, this is why these stupid things drive me nuts.  Of all the good we do, all we hear about is that pizza guy has glasses on his shirt collar...."

However, from what I'm reading, it seems to have turned into more of a ""just like Food Network©, but we're paying these people!""

I went from being watched to doing the watching when I took over. It'll drive you nuts. I'll be honest, it sounds like these owners don't have their shit together.  Cameras on the doors and walk ins are nice theft deterrents. Cameras on line are a liability. If they don't trust you then you aren't really in control and that's a rough place to be. I use my cameras to check volume while I'm out and figure out things if there's an incident. I don't think they should be used for much else."

I've known people who would really get off on something like this.  You can stay at home and drink beer naked, while correcting the staff's behavior.

KitchenConfidential,3deaqr,Spinolio,40,Thu Jul 16 02:39:15 2015 UTC,"I worked at a ""NY style"" deli/market as a butcher apprentice. Also helped deli with sandwiches, slicing, and prep when they were slammed, showed the deli grill guy how to cook a burger, helped floor employees restock, helped bakery when slammed, and ran a small showtime Sunday brunch (eggs anyway, pancakes, waffles, and sides with fucked up home kitchen equipment). Basically I did almost everything but touch a cash register.  Anyway, they had cameras everywhere that streamed to the office, owners' home, and the Internet for when they were on vacation. I would get several calls a day on the butcher dept phone, usually from the wife owner about:   me talking too long to the customers fraternizing with other employees, we're not allowed to talk to each other checking my phone for the time, I ended up propping it up under some butcher paper so I could have a secret clock stealing Pepsi from the soda fountain, we were expected to pay full price as there were no employee discounts at all ""that box of noodles on the third rack to the left is crooked"" not clocking out before using the restroom, the clock in machine was a palm scanner and I would have to summon other employees to the phone for them to be scolded   I'm sure there were more memories I've drunk away. They never cared about big things, only the micromanaging of non issues.  Examples:   My first week, I pulled all the proteins and scrubbed and bleached the 4 butcher cases; all the drains were clogged with inches of blood, fat, and mold from months of drippings from beef, pork, chicken, fish, and ice. The grates were caked with mold. I was told ""thanks"" and they didn't know it was a violation. FIFO was non-existent; I would continually pull and trash expired or rotten items in deli or produce displays despite it not being my job. And subsequently got scolded because it wasn't my job, it was the manager's. I complained to them about that manager using my butcher three sink to soak veggies for deli salads without cleaning and sanitizing it! There were chicken bits in it and I had just cleaned the fucking sausage machine! That manager would also steal my cutting boards and chop veggies on them, simply wiping them down with a paper towel. I confronted him and he said it's clean because ""there's no more chicken juice. edit: i just remembered, we ran out of soap for hand wash stations and detergent/sanitizer for the dish pits for over two weeks. Manager brought in a near empty Palmolive bottle and would refill it with water and shake it. I luckily found a half empty gallon of bleach for a spray bottle I used for cleaning. edit 2: manager would use butcher use only ice buckets to refill ice dispenser bins for soda fountain. After I saw him, I checked the buckets. Chicken scraps.   Nothing changed, I was called ""arrogant""  They started sending me to a sister bakery 30 minutes away to deliver goods and fill in for whichever high schooler no-call/no-showed. Without compensating me for fuel or a bump in wage.  Eventually, their ""master baker from NYC"" flipped out on me when I pointed out his months old biscotti in the display had fucking maggots in them and I suggested tossing all the product in that one case. ""You don't know what you're talking about"" and ""you'll never make it in this business"" kind of shit.  Fuck off, I walked. They eventually went under a year later.  You're in their playground; you gotta play by their rules or play elsewhere."

KitchenConfidential,3deaqr,BloodRelic,9,Wed Jul 15 20:52:31 2015 UTC,"Only places I'll ever want cameras in a kitchen are in the walk-in, backdoor and dry storage area. And if I had cameras, I would only check them if a problem came about, like constant missing product.  We had a security camera in the back of a previous restaurant that faced the freezer and seafood walk-in. One of our dishwashers was working the dayshift and his job was to scrub the floors of both. He asked the chef for the keys, and disappeared for an hour and a half (Deep cleaning for the seafood cooler since its product was used on a raw bar). Came back in clocked out and went home. Later we went to stock the raw bar and a case of blue points and a case of middle necks were missing. 4 cases of pretzel sticks, missing. And a sheet tray of key lime pies we had made that morning, were missing.  So we looked at the camera and saw the dishwasher pulled his car around to where the freezers were, loaded the trunk with our product, and when he finished his shift, just drove off with all of it. Fucker had the balls to say we were mistaken.  So yeah...if there's a problem, then check the cameras, if not leave it be. Ain't broke, don't fix.  EDIT: For those who are confused, the two walk-ins were outside because there was not enough room inside for all the product we needed. Poor planning during construction. Was a bitch in the winter, having to shovel pathways to each walk-in. Even more of a bitch when Sysco would deliver."

If I quit my job every time I disagreed with the manager or owner I'd never have a job again. Hell, I punched one of my coworkers in the face once (off the clock of course). You know what happened? We settled down and worked out our issues like adults. OP says they have a great staff and a great GM. Those things aren't easy to find, and I think we can find a more constructive solution than to quit every time you get your feathers ruffled. /rant  OP, I imagine you've already discussed this with your coworkers. It's a lot more difficult for management to dismiss your complaint if everyone feels the same way. Consider getting another person who is well-respected in the kitchen to come back you up when you talk to the GM, and make sure they know you're not the only one that feels that way. Consider solutions. Perhaps the cameras only need to be reviewed if there's some sort of complaint? None of this seems unreasonable, and I'd be willing to bet your GM agrees with you. No one likes to have people watching over their shoulder at all times. If none of that works, it's entirely possible that if you dot your P's and cross your Q's for long enough the owners will get bored with their new toy and find something else to do.

In some movie theaters, you can hold up your phone's camera and see the IR lights they shine on the crowd to watch them in the darkness.  If they are wireless, it's easy to disrupt their signal as well.  Interference is easier to explain, especially if you just bought a new microwave.  If they aren't wireless, your best bet is to introduce latency.  They are a lot less fun to watch at 2 fps.  If you can connect to the internet, just start downloading torrents.

In the Netherlands, where i live, the owner is only allowed to use cameras as a way of protection. So not allowed to remotely monitor his workers. This is seen as interfering with privacy law."

KitchenConfidential,3deaqr,Lerkylerker,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:57:16 2015 UTC,"We have a similar circumstance in my restaurant. The main owner is there everyday, trusts us, and never really makes a fuss because we have a solid kitchen staff....the co-owner however, who owns a couple other places as well, rarely leaves his house and apparently spends his day watching cameras. With the main owner having our backs, we have gotten to where we pretty much ignore the eye in the sky.  One option you could try (depending on your kitchen) is organize  shelves and what not to partially block the cameras. If they bitch about it you can claim it will make the kitchen run better. They then have to choose between being nib noses or slowing down their cooks."
KitchenConfidential,3deaqr,Popichan,2,Thu Jul 16 17:35:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that won't happen. They'll move the cameras, or call continually until the obstructions are moved.    For all the people in this thread suggesting sabotaging the cameras or unplugging them, you have to realize that doing so will turn making the cameras functional into everyone's number one, don't do anything else until it's done priority. It will also precipitate a witch hunt to pin the blame for the sabotage on somebody, and no matter how much you like and trust your coworkers, one of them needs their job badly enough to roll over on you."

KitchenConfidential,3dgq8p,Aktsugi,14,Thu Jul 16 03:28:38 2015 UTC,"Get there early, even if it means coming in off the clock, to get set up and get your mis en place ready (some will disagree with me on this - depends on the restaurant i suppose). My first week on the line, I came in 2 hours early off the clock to make sure my prep was done and I was ready for service (i still wasn't, go figure).  Write out each dish you'll have to make on a sheet of paper with each ingredient and how it gets plated so that you have a reference until you don't need it anymore.  Ask for help if you need it and don't be afraid to rely on your fellow line cooks. If you do, make sure to thank them after the shift. It's part of learning and the line is a team.  Don't forget to stay hydrated, level-headed, and stop and take a breath if you get too overwhelmed. At the end of the day, all we do is cook dinner for folks. You got this!"
KitchenConfidential,3dgq8p,Pavswede,7,Thu Jul 16 03:54:01 2015 UTC,"That sounds like the daily routine of a lot of cooks I know. Any chance you're in NYC? Going in a few hours early off the clock was basically the story of my life at some point.   I have this theory that a lot of high-end kitchens in NYC are designed so that their staff is always in the shits. If you're in the shits, you're scared. If you're scared, you won't take shortcuts, you won't have time to fuck around, and you'll work as quickly as you possibly can. It's like every station has just enough work to put you 30 minutes behind...  It's a bitch to get through but I feel like every 4 months or so, I level up."
KitchenConfidential,3dgq8p,eatsleepshit,4,Sat Jul 18 02:25:10 2015 UTC,"Yep, NYC all the way, haha. I read some of your other posts, especially about the ""michelin microcosm."" Can we make that a term, btw? Because it really is it's own other world.  Your theory makes a lot of sense - almost everyone I work with comes in an hour early. If I'm coming in after a day off, I come in even earlier, because whoever worked my station the night before probably fucked it all up. sigh... Reorganize my shit, rewrite the prep list, and finally get to work and pray to the culinary gods that the prep team did at least some of my shit, or else I'm going to be still setting up my station 45 minutes after service starts. And yeah, we're always behind until about 6 (open at 5:30). I'm on hot apps and I have a f-ton of stuff to set up - at least entrees isn't going to get slammed right when we open, no matter what.  I usually eventually find my stride a few months in (until they change the menu, haha), but I still have to come in early on the weekends because prep for 350 covers just cannot be physically get done in the 2.5 hours we're scheduled before service..."
KitchenConfidential,3dgq8p,Pavswede,3,Sat Jul 18 21:24:22 2015 UTC,"Ohgods. When I was working in NYC at a popular spot I'd always go in about an hour and a half early.

KitchenConfidential,3dgq8p,Sarival,2,Sat Jul 18 07:59:17 2015 UTC,"In my experience, shifts have always started well within the time constraints to get all of your mise finished before service begins.  Even when I was starting out as a line cook, my shift started at 7am for an 11:30am service start.    Totally agree with you on making a list of all of your pick-ups, its always helped me, even when starting a new station, making sure you don't forget any of your garnishes and the plating is correct is a good way to get noticed, especially early on.  And staying hydrated, well that just can't be repeated enough."

You may be more valuable to them as a non-shift leader simply because they know you're always available to cover everyone else's call offs.    On the other hand, that might make you more valuable to them because you're the guy who is always ready to help out, when needed, so they know you're loyal, and willing to work.

How can you effectively grab an order when it's bundles up on the floor. You're going to be looking which one to get for half an hour before you figure out which one came first. If you can't even organise your orders, that I don't want to see the disorganisation of your kitchen.    But that is something you never see in a kitchen because it always looks so damn clean.    And if you have that many orderes, indeed, no way you're going to think about, let alone have the time to grab your phone, unlock it and make a photo.

KitchenConfidential,3desbz,ChefGuru,2,Wed Jul 15 18:52:49 2015 UTC,"probably fairly difficult, but there's only way to find out - go ask. Just go at a good time (3-4pm) and ask to see the chef (most likely you won't talk to Brock). And of course, you could always go the old school method of hanging around for days on end, bothering the chef every time you see him for a stage."
KitchenConfidential,3desbz,Pavswede,2,Wed Jul 15 18:53:10 2015 UTC,"Getting stages really isn't that hard, just give em a call and ask if there's someone you can talk to or who to email and that should be that.

KitchenConfidential,3desbz,614-704,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:08:43 2015 UTC,Your best bet is to look through all your contacts and see if you can find someone who might know someone who knows someone that is related to the resturant.  And then start emailing.  Never underestimate the value of free labor.  Or at least that's what has worked for me.
KitchenConfidential,3desbz,noahsbutcher,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:27:28 2015 UTC,"Getting a stage shouldn't be that difficult. Honestly, husk is great, but it's past its prime. And don't expect to see Brock. He's never there. But just call and tell them you want to stage for the experience. They probably won't turn down free help. It may depend on the season though. It's the slow season in Charleston right now.   Edit: I'm assuming I'm being down voted because I gave my opinion on husk. I've eaten there; the food is good, but not worth the three week reservation. The burgers are killer though.  And the pimento. There are plenty of great places to stage in Charleston though if you want to work in the area, or want an excuse to come visit. I recommend: FIG, Edmunds Oast, McCradys (which yes, I know is also a Brock restaurant, but I still think you'll get more out of it. The food is great, and the staff rock.), And Charleston Place (old school fine dining, but they're good at what they do, and they offer the best service in town)."

You can buy Chilean that is MSC certified but the reality is that comes from on small breeding ground and other areas are getting poached to hell.   The best solution is to offer butterfish/Alaskan black cod which is nearly identical in texture and flavor.

KitchenConfidential,3d9j2x,joe_beef,15,Wed Jul 15 00:59:55 2015 UTC,Not all sea bass is over fished. Look at Websites like this: http://www.fishwatch.gov/seafood_profiles/species/sea_bass/species_pages/black_sea_bass.htm   This is much better info. I wouldn't quote facts about fish from some random website that isn't even about food or fish.

KitchenConfidential,3d9j2x,icaruscomplex,8,Tue Jul 14 16:03:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Chilean is very trendy, it's also not bass.   Striper stocks are good, in addition to Black Sea Bass, as quoted above. I don't think Branzino stocks are in bad shape at the moment, and that's a great fish - very versatile. Hrm, that article may be about Branzino, but fish nomenclature is a mess. Looking into it, Branzino stocks have been declining, but there is a healthy farming industry that would be sustainable.    EDIT: <Throws up hands.> Who the eff knows anymore. Montery Bay Aquarium counsels to eat farmed branzino, but doesn't list it as AVOID like they do for Bluefin Tuna (which, to be fair, isn't farmed). And take all this with a grain of salt, because I had atlantic bluefin sushi Sunday (which, to be fair, was caught locally either line and reel or maybe harpoon at this point in the season).   EDIT.

Peking duck and shark fin soup.  I'm all up for a challenge and although I've cooked Peking duck at home, we have some of the best duck in the U.S. raised right here in my adopted home,so I'd love to try it for a bunch of folks. I totally noped the fuck out on the shark fin soup. I pointed out to the other managers that I couldn't in good conscience do that for them. They backed me up on this before I showed them the video of fins being cut off and the rest of the carcass discarded. When they saw the quote for the fins (from a purveyor with which we had no prior relationship), they solidified that position. The clients were from a wealthy family so I'm pretty sure the price of the finished product wasn't an issue for my team."

KitchenConfidential,3d9xjb,King_Chochacho,5,Tue Jul 14 18:29:18 2015 UTC,"Deep fryers are pretty easy. Most of your food products let you know via a change in behavior/color/texture when they are done; i.e. most float, some darken, others firm up or burst their breading slightly.  Tips: Never let your bosses see you idle unless you are on a break. Clean when you aren't busy cooking.  Prep as you go, or whenever you have down time.  Study your kitchen's recipes.  Practice every skill you can, whenever you can. Can't flip eggs in a pan? Put a piece of bread in that bad boy and practice until you get the rhythm and technique down.  Never be afraid to admit you don't know something. If your kitchen is making various renditions of the same dishes, consistency is going to be nonexistent; know which method of preparation and presentation is desired by the boss, and adhere to it.  Most importantly: learn to love what you do and why you are doing it. This makes a world of difference. Like to be artistic? Express that in whatever creative ways you can through your food. Like to make people happy? Remember that your customers, while they can be overwhelming at times, are the reason you are doing what you are doing. Most are ""hangry"" by the time they decide to eat, so you, unfortunately, have to deal with the hunger-monster. Luckily, when their bellies are full and their moods restored, you also get to be a big part of the reason for that. There's little better than having a customer come to the pick up window to thank you for the delicious meal you just prepared for them. Just my observations from my own experiences. :)"

The people overreacted, and acted in a fashion that no kitchen manager should behave. I cannot count the number of times I've seen an employee catch their breath doing someone mostly useless for a minute or 2. Sometimes things are clean, they are stocked and its ok to just look busy. I run a tight ship when I'm running a kitchen, but I treat my employees with respect and don't call them names when I need to improve on a behavior. If that attitude deserves this level of negative response and downvotes, then so be it. I am a fantastic souschef, and kitchen manager. My employee's enjoy working for me, and in return when I need them the most I see them breaking their backs to get stuff done because they know I have their back. A kitchen is a unit, not a power fantasy for the hopelessly childish."
KitchenConfidential,3dcn1i,Albend,2,Thu Jul 16 07:14:43 2015 UTC,"Calling him a piece of shit is too much, yeah. Inwouldnt go that far. Its more on principle than anything.  He seemed like he was bragging about ""looking busy,"" as opposed to doing something meaningful. If someone needs a minute to catch their breath, i let them do just that. I will send them out for a smoke break or some fresh air more often than not before a rush. and you can just as easily catch your breath while doing small knife work.   If everything was done, nobody needs help and the kitchen is clean and ready, then just take a short break before the rush. Make sure your line mates are aware you are going offline, let the chef know thst you are set and catching a breath before the storm and go, dont be a douche by pretending to be busy. Thst just tells me that you have a shitty work ethic."

IF AND I MEAN IF for some stupid reason your measuring something that'll cross contaminate because your too stupid to eyeball raw fucking chicken. Then place plastic wrap inside the measuring device. If your separating spoons. ( which realistically only get used for baking) fuck off and go back home Martha Stuart my kitchen doesn't need a Nancy boy who still uses measuring spoons for a recipe that calls for half a table spoon of vinegar.
KitchenConfidential,3d7nfr,kitchbitch,-5,Tue Jul 14 05:38:30 2015 UTC,"So many things to respond to! First, no proper recipe would say 1/2 tablespoon of vinegar, it would say 1 1/2 teaspoons, since a 1/2 tablespoon measuring spoon isn't a standard thing. Second, I get what you're saying (except why did you mention raw chicken...), but you don't have to say it like a douchebag. And third, Martha Stewart's test kitchen team is legit and their recipes are great reference points, so don't you go talkin' 'bout my 'Stew Boo like dat!"
KitchenConfidential,3d7nfr,Pavswede,4,Tue Jul 14 05:52:39 2015 UTC,I mentioned raw chicken. Becuase how many things are going to cross contaminate.

KitchenConfidential,3d7b4v,kingswee,10,Tue Jul 14 02:07:19 2015 UTC,"""Fresh"" doesn't necessarily mean ""raw."" Personally, I would rather have fish that was properly frozen, shipped, and stored than something shipped raw and left in the walk in overnight."
KitchenConfidential,3d7b4v,securicorscares,8,Tue Jul 14 02:11:24 2015 UTC,"I didn't think this was news. This has been a law for some time, I thought.   Lots of boats have vacuum sealers and chill blasters right on their boat. The fish is frozen so quickly that the water inside of the cells only forms small crystals as it freezes. So the cells aren't ruptured or damaged.   As long as it's thawed properly you won't even notice that it's been frozen."
KitchenConfidential,3d7b4v,Oneusee,2,Tue Jul 14 02:39:39 2015 UTC,"Hell, very few people - even the ones who spend a lot of term with fish - can tell the difference between flash frozen fish and ""fresh"" fish. Even the ones that can, fuck them, the safety makes up for it."

KitchenConfidential,3d3jgj,wearekatet,6,Mon Jul 13 06:05:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I feel you. So I took a job at a large hotel chain that has an independent owner. I had been working in nice kitchens. I'd worked my way into some locally notable spots and into two Forbes Four Star properties over the last decade of my career but I figured I could use the responsibility. First, if you want to chat in depth, feel free to message me, I'd be glad to talk. I'm about a year and a half into this job. I went from sous to exec/f&b director and it's been an eye opener. The main thing I have to say is that you have to continually set goals. Not the corporate ones but personal ones. Things you are trying to learn and accomplish. Second, you have to find a balance with work and home. The bigger the corporate kitchen, the more demanding it can be on your time because of constant minor fires. I know this is true of all restaurants but the corporate world will chew you up without a second thought and move on to the next guy. It always sounds like a cake gig to the guys on the outside but it requires a lot of finesse, something I find many chefs tend to lack. Basically the professional polish to crunch numbers, be a leader and manage an actual business. I mean, if you've been cooking for ten years and you can bang out pretty food, congrats. But who, with experience, can't? Just clowns who are more concerned with their after work shiftie. I wanted to learn how to make some fucking money in this job and so I figured that learning some tried and true systems (basically business mis en place) would be the best way to do that. But yeah, sometimes staffing and all the little things will drive you insane. I can't just turn to some prick and tell him to fuck off. I have to coach him. Either get him better or get him out the door. But in the end it's made me a better chef. No yelling, no tantrums, just calm, calculated precision. Executing a plan and seeing results. I've become much less reactionary. I've also learned to listen to guest feedback and how to mine data from reviews rather than just bitch about stupid ""foodies"". Sure, some days I wish I was in a small kitchen cooking my dream menu. But I know that right now I'm learning the steps to get there. It's just patience and will. And coffee."
KitchenConfidential,3d3jgj,bluechef79,2,Mon Jul 13 11:45:20 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply.  I'm a supervisor currently, so I'm getting it from both ends. It's encouraging to see what you took the time to type out.   I'll just do what I know is best and try to keep my plan rolling.   How would you recommend dealing with a banquet chef who can't keep his BEOs straight, make proper prep lists, order things properly, or manage time well? Honestly this dude is my biggest gripe here."
KitchenConfidential,3d3jgj,bluechef79,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:40:19 2015 UTC,"So this is a huge problem as I assume a he is dealing with a lot of revenue. The first hing you have to do is ask yourself, is the job to hard? What I mean is...are the BEO's written properly, is there an organized method for ordering, are there are appropriate Standard Operating Procedures put in to place?  Make sure that the chef has all of the proper tools at his disposal to effectively perform his job. If yes, then you have to follow disciplinary measures. The first step is to sit him down and have a verbal coaching session to make him aware of what needs to change and give him a plan that you both agree on to change it. Type it up and put it in his file. Then follow a written warning system. Do not hesitate to write him up if he does not follow his agreed upon plan. He will either step up or you will remove him and you will replace him with a (hopefully ) more competent person. Do not yell or show frustration as this is all signs of weakness.

The chef in question is just clueless. The BEOs are well written, he has order guides, he's just inept.   I'll just suck it up and pull some extra weight for now. Hopefully I'll be noticed for it. If nothing else I can use my time at this property to score a Sous spot at another property or another outlet at my current one when we add more.   I will say that the one outlet under my control is doing well. Food cost is down, as is labor cost. Ticket times are better and the place is almost spotless now.

He and the kid's mom weren't together, but were effectively co-parenting.  She worked weekday mornings/early afternoons, he worked evenings and weekends.  So they managed to keep their son out of day care by coordinating schedules.  He had no experience when we hired him, but he caught on fast and worked his ass off.  Probably would have been promoted at some point, but his schedule wouldn't allow it."

Seriously, I grew up in the industry. Aunt and Uncle are chefs with a business and my pops operates a variety of restaurants. For as long as I can remember I was getting farmed out to different operations. Upon graduating from college, I gave myself the kiss of death by swearing I would never work in food service again in my life.  Fast forward five years- I have worked myself up in an overseas operation of a U.S.-based financial institution, managing multiple outlets and teams at a young age. I moved back to the states to get my Master's. Two weeks before the program started I felt sick to my stomach and asked myself, ""What would I do if money was no issue?""  Baking was the answer. So I 86ed the Master's plans and got enrolled in Pastry School with a bunch of snot-faced teenagers who were there because they wanted to be the next Cake Boss.  No regrets. While there are times I miss the money, schedule and less stress, I would not trade the absolute soul-quenching satisfaction life wearing a different white collar brings."

I hated my job - the pay was good but I didn't care about what I was doing and didn't really feel excited about my work. Combine that with ridiculous hours and stress, I ended up feeling really depressed and hopeless.   Eventually quit, ran away to Paris because I always wanted to learn French. Landed a job working at a baking business there and learned a lot on the job - I'd worked in many a kitchen during my student years and the feeling of taking pride in my work finally came back. Did that for about 8 months until my visa expired.  Moved to another country afterwards, and found that the food culture there was kinda crap and came across an opportunity for a cheap kitchen to rent... It's been six crazy months now but my own baking business is doing alright for itself, supplying a couple of cafes and recently just landed a large hotel.   I'm still learning lots and my lack of formal training definitely means I've got some huge gaps in my technical knowledge. What I've really loved though beyond just producing food that I'm proud of, is actually owning something that is mine, and growing it. Alot of people say to me that I must really enjoy baking but truthfully - I enjoyed cooking alot more. What I really love is making this idea a reality!   Also, waitresses."

I was working minimum 60 hours a week during this time, graduated with honors, etc., only to realize that a technical degree is not a magic wand and you actually need people skills and connections in order to be able to get a job. Historically, people are not something I'm great at dealing with. Finally, after months, got a decent job at a consulting firm and quickly mastered the ropes. But I was super bored...and since it was consulting, I had to talk to clients which is mostly boring. Plus I gained weight from sitting around all day...I enjoy being active but after working 9 hours going to work out in a gym just seems insane to me.  Decided I needed to go back to graduate school, got into a decent one, and went, only to work with an abusive advisor, who demanded I do hours of research every day on top of teaching classes and taking classes of my own. Being told my work was shit coupled with getting ~4 hours of sleep every night led to me drinking heavily and failing classes. Finally I got help, realized I needed to get the hell out of there, and went back into the businessy world with renewed energy.   Got a cool job at a young start up that I thought had a lot of potential. But eventually it became apparent that the people in charge were just looking for a quick buck and weren't really interested in or capable of creating a good company. They ignored the people they hired and blamed them for the problems that arose as a result. I started dating one of my coworkers and was called out by one of the co-owners, who told me that before he started dating me my boyfriend was a really hard worker, and that he should really be thinking about his career more (i.e. ditch me). Nobody ever spoke to him about our relationship. This was really one of the only times I ever felt discriminated against because of my gender, and ironically it came from a woman. Finally got of out that hell hole.   It came to the point where I decided I could hop around jobs for the rest of my life and be miserable, or I could turn my long-time hobby/passion into a career. I'm making less than I did as a college intern and yes, it's occasionally stressful not to have as much money, or to be working weird hours compared to friends, but I really love going into work and creating beautiful things every day.   TL/DR: Lots of jobs are stressful and have long hours. I decided I would take the paycut and similar stress levels at a job I love rather than deal with shitheads and bureaucrats at a job I hate."

As someone who went the other direction, I can testify that office work is soul crushing, while kitchen work is body crushing. I think it depends on what you have more of. Even the worst days in the office are fine, because I get sick days, lots of money, and I can take breaks and have 1 hour lunches. I'm done ruining my body.    But those who started out white collar.... I can't even imagine. I'm glad they sometime turn to cooking, because otherwise they might become mass murderers.

My fear is I might miss cooking. it comes very natural to me. I've been a sous chef for 4 years now, and will have the opportunity to take over the kitchen i'm working. I don't think I will though. i don't want to be a chef. the longer hours and demand to be there at all times will interfere with my classes. when I made this decision, I knew being in the kitchen forever was not for me. I always questioned getting old, being a 50 year old trying to cook on the line, and knew I didn't want that. I've seen too many chefs do it and barely be able to stand back up when they crouch down.   I also don't want to start at a new restaurant. I don't have a culinary degree, and at best in my area I would get 12 an hour, which is peanuts. plus, my place closes before the others, so more hours."

Unless there were extenuating circumstances such as chef was already getting canned, that's a bullshit move by mgmt.  They deserve NCNS when each current crew member leaves.  The management earned that respect.  Secondly, poaching talent is frowned upon.  It's a small world.  Be careful with this."

KitchenConfidential,3d3d9o,rhinowing,3,Mon Jul 13 08:29:17 2015 UTC,"While I agree that your job doesn't deserve it, I'd say remain professional even if they aren't. There are more people paying attention than you think, including new/prospective employers. Also, the odds of you being able to bring along a handful of guys to a new place is not great so don't make any promises yet. Best case if you are the exec? You can choose your sous and maybe another cook. But you probably don't want to start out your exec career at a place that is so desperate that they will clean house or need five new cooks. Sounds like an uphill climb at a poorly run place. If you need to cook with all of these guys, find a new spot and open it up. Also a terrible idea for a new exec but that's only if you have to have these cooks. Best bet, keep it quiet, find a home and bring your most trusted number 2 then help your friends find homes as they quit in quality places.

The only useful meaning for wrong that I can come up with is to say that certain people or groups don't like a given word or usage.  This is why modern dictionaries usually provide detailed usage notes such as indicating that a word is appropriate for a formal context.     I'd argue that while one would probably want to avoid using the word ""chill"" as an adjective in a formal or academic setting (in order to avoid putting the reader/listener ill at ease), there isn't any reason to avoid it in an informal setting such as Reddit, and certainly calling it wrong makes little sense.

KitchenConfidential,3d2n02,wtfwasthatdave,5,Mon Jul 13 01:16:20 2015 UTC,"What kind of oil are you using? Asking because it sounds like part of the problem is cheap oil. There's no reason to go through that much even if you're frying that much chicken.  I'd look into a blend like Mel fry or rice bran oil if you're going through that much chicken. They're gonna cost you a little more up front but you're gonna save some money on the lowered usage. Like, 40 a case every three days vs 20 a case daily. That'll add up quickly, and using better oil will also aid the quality of what's going out the window.  Also, boil the fryers nightly and filter twice a day. That'll go a long way to extending the life of the oil on its own.  ETA don't use those filtration chemicals or the green goo shit when you're cleaning the fryers. That shit is snake oil. Get a synthetic filter bag and boil with vinegar. Also the benefits of the machines are overstated."

If you want to know whether oil is broken and it isn't at the smoke point, drop a basket into the oil. If you can't see the bottom of the basket at four inches, it's time to dump. This should only happen daily if you're throwing +- 50 pounds of bacon and tempura snickers into the fryers along with the chicken."

Also we have a register in the kitchen to take orders, and usually we do most of the order taking because the aforementioned servers aren't doing their jobs. Like today we had two servers and they each had one half of the lanes (bowling alley) one was sending orders through and actively trying to get people to not crowd around the kitchen window to order. The other sent maybe two orders the entire night. The worst part of having to do their jobs too is that I rarely get tipped."

KitchenConfidential,3cvea8,onioning,4,Sat Jul 11 16:41:40 2015 UTC,"I believe in classical cuisine... but :  I had a chef who showed me in the 80's that if you put a fish fillet in fumet and white wine on a plate with a bit of butter on top, filmed it and then microwave it, it'll come out all right.  It has to do with the power setting, like don't go 2000 watts on it but go 500-700 watts.   I did this in a place not long ago where the boss was the cook and he asked me to do it. I did and didn't cringe. The cod was just cooked-still-glistening-in-the-centre and it was cooked with the proper ingredients.  A microwave oven is a tool, one has to know its working principles.  Some people find that sous vide low temperature cooking is silly. I say it's multiplying the handling of the merchandise to an unacceptable degree. Is it worth it? Not always, I can make improvised dishes to the minute that will taste much better."

But the switch up in plating can be creative and fun, at least in my opinion.   Honestly from a business point of view, you can put down a modest amount on ""custom and local"" plating (i.e. just wood and stone slabs) and end up charging more for it.   Guests seem to get a kick out of it. I could see how this wouldn't be fitting for a restaurant that does maybe more than 60 covers a night?"

I don't have a problem with plates of different shapes/sizes/colours, but I want to be able to cut/eat my food in a sanitary, sane, fashion.

KitchenConfidential,3czyo1,nickachu_,2,Sun Jul 12 12:34:51 2015 UTC,Salt water has a higher boiling point than unsalted water - the upswing is that things cook faster in salted water than they do in unsalted.
KitchenConfidential,3czyo1,artofsushi,7,Sun Jul 12 12:37:41 2015 UTC,Technically correct. In reality the difference is minimal enough that the real reason is it adds flavour. Boiling 1C hotter won't make things cook much quicker.

So one day maybe a month ago another coworker mentioned that she thought that the ghost was getting irate because she saw a lot of stuff go weird, stuff falling off shelves, things like that, so she started leaving leftover bits of milkshake around in our little disposable water cups because in her words, ""he's hungry!"" She left because she's a morning shift person and I take over. Later that day one of our regulars who is an actually crazy guy bought a coffee and told me that he was gonna leave the coffee on one of the outside tables because it was for his friend, not him, and that his friend was going to come and get it. He said that it was because his friend was lonely and hungry and that nobody takes care of him. So now I'm half convinced that this dude knows the ghost and that they're friends. It's a nice thought. He's been buying drinks and leaving them around the shop for his friend for a while now. Nobody ever comes to claim them."

After that it crashes the whole site (locally). I think it's something with the libraries I'm using and not my code so it's going to take me a little puzzling to figure it out.

I'm on my 2nd pair of pros after 5 years in them and I love them. I'll invest in one of the leather professional Birkenstocks after I wear through these. Good shit isn't cheap and cheap shit isn't good.

I doubted him, for a whole 60 seconds until he showed me his feet. Yes chef, birkis it is.   No problems with them so far, except my current chef and I have the exact same shoes.

KitchenConfidential,3cvcyx,bobstar,2,Sat Jul 11 16:58:47 2015 UTC,"I've been through just about every pair of slip resistant shoes.  I'm much harder on my shoes than most.   Im the chef, so I work 12 hrs minimum and I don't stand in the same place for long.    Constantly walking around a very big kitchen checking on prep, doing orders etc.   It's not unusual for me to walk 5-7 miles a day at work.  My shoes don't last nearly as long with this job as they did with my last (mostly stuck working a station for extended periods of time).    I wouldn't recommend any of the cheaper ones (shoes for crews, treadsafe etc) unless you had an emergency blowout and need a new pair before work tomorrow (which is significantly more likely if you're wearing a pair of these). They'll be good for a minute, but don't expect more than 60-90 days.    Mozo's were good shows, but the canvas doesn't look very professional for a manager after a few months.   Crocs are good and like wearing flip flops, but don't offer a lot of support for calves/Achilles/ankles.  I also had some issues with my hamstrings being sore after a long day.    Timberland pro series are good shoes.  They're around $100 but they're comfy and will last.   I bought mine online, and they're a little big, I wish they were a better fit.    Sketchers are a good value, but I have a hard time finding them in my size (most look like sneakers).  Ive recently switched to clogs at the advice of my orthopedic Dr.  I'd you're considering making this your career, you should look into them.  They're kinda gay looking but the raised heel puts your foot at the proper angle to support your weight and takes a ton of pressure off your back, hips and knees.   I've been in the business 15 years (in my 30s now) and before I switched, I walked around in the morning like a man twice my age.  I don't have nearly as much soreness in my legs, back or knees as I used to, and I feel a lot less fatigued after a long day.  Danskos are the best, but out of the price range of most line cooks.  Sanita made danskos for dansko before they took over their own production.  They still make VERY good quality clogs for a much cheaper price.  .  I haven't owned either of these long enough to review them lon term, but most reviews say they last YEARS not months."

KitchenConfidential,3cuj8w,TxCookin,3,Fri Jul 10 22:00:31 2015 UTC,Are the fans frozen over in the freezer? Is the intake on the outside blocked with dust? Is it set to reach a temp it'll never get to because its to hot outside to achieve? Problems from my experiance.
KitchenConfidential,3cuj8w,cgulin,2,Fri Jul 10 23:09:58 2015 UTC,"Honestly this was the coldest freezer we had. It was at -20 when I come in in the mornings. Just checked it and it's blowing air inside again, just not cooling off. Will check the coils and all that in a bit. Since it's empty I might as well try unplugging it as suggested. Should hopefully get us through the weekend untill we can have our guys check it out.  Thank yall for the suggestions.  Edit: probably time to write a eulogy for the old thing haha."
KitchenConfidential,3cuj8w,chefandy,2,Sat Jul 11 00:11:48 2015 UTC,"You probably just need some preventative maintenance.  They'll come out, charge the coolant, check for leaks or issues, clean the filters and coils etc.  If you're over stocking the freezer, you cold be blocking the intake which will freeze up your unit.   You could also try unplugging it at night to defrost and see if that helps."
KitchenConfidential,3cuj8w,ChefGuru,4,Sun Jul 12 03:06:29 2015 UTC,"Yes, I know exactly what the problem is.  Your extremely vague description of the problems with a piece of complicated machinery that usually requires the services of a trained specialist to repair has given me all the information I need to diagnose the problem.  I can't believe that you actually have a freezer in Texas, I thought it was too hot down there for any of those to actually work."

KitchenConfidential,3cuj8w,master_blast3r,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:04:07 2015 UTC,"I'd bet it's the defrost timer. Those always tend to break first. If it's malfunctioning, the coil fills up with ice, reducing efficiency. Sometimes it gets so iced up that it jams the evaporator fan and it stops cooling entirely. Unplug the unit and let it defrost overnight if possible. If it works the next day, it's the timer. It could also be a clogged condensate drain causing it to ice up.  If it was the compressor, it wouldn't be a slow process, it'd just stop working entirely."
KitchenConfidential,3cuj8w,Formaldehyd3,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:28:10 2015 UTC,"Well, it's shot. Tried unplugging it n checked everything. Hasn't gone above 40. I was also informed that this isn't the first time it's done this. Also that the temperature regulator is broken, so that's why it would get down to 20. My managers are some serious cheapskates so they will probably put off having someone come out to try to fix it. Thank god it's not a walk in freezer, I don't imagine they'd be any more concerned about a walk in going out.   Anyways, thanks for the suggestions yall"

KitchenConfidential,3crtiw,chefandy,3,Fri Jul 10 07:53:11 2015 UTC,"I started off waiting tables at a diner at 16.  At 18 I went to a fine dining place and they wouldn't hire me as a server even though I had exp, so I took a job food running, bussing and dishwashing.  From runner I learned expo (where the chef worked during rushes, I'd hop on when he had to leave the line or when it was slow and he was outside smoking ) and got pretty good.   They promoted me to server and I worked there for 5 yrs, but id still help out on expo quite a bit (3-4 shifts a month or so).   I left and went to culinary school and took a job on the line at a few other fine dining places for a few years.     Years later I ran into my old boss and asked what I had been doing and he remembered my work ethic and offered me a job as a manager.  Managers worked front and back of the house there and i ran the kitchen on the chefs days off and foh 3 days a week.  2 yrs later I got promoted to exec.    Versatility is very important.  You'd be a better chef/km for understanding how the foh works and a much better foh manager for understanding how the kitchen works."

Other than the crab cakes the food was really nothing special,  people mostly just came to see and be seen. The bar would get pretty crowded with cougars,  post-golfers, and all manner of douches but my favorite was definitely this one guy.  He was a big thick necked dude bro and was walking around drinking Stella Artois and when he was finished with one would take a bite out of the glass Stella goblet he was drinking from. On the second or third goblet one of the managers kicked him out,  but that dude has always stayed on in my mind ever since as kind of weird douchey role model. edit: typo"

During a company meeting we were told specifically that the other investors outside the owner and his family and the couple were to be treated as customers with the exception of their house account. Numerous times the other investors would start a scene, demand free drinks, free food but we were under strict orders not to cave into such demands. The most memorable event was when one of these guys got way too drunk and started yelling that he owned the restaurant, was tired of our lack of respect and started turning off the lights in the dining room during service declaring that the restaurant was closed due to his orders, so we promptly called the cops and the owner refunded his investment the next day and barred him from the restaurant."

KitchenConfidential,3corix,MylesMDT,9,Thu Jul 9 18:44:13 2015 UTC,"An owner I once worked for.  He was in his mid 50s, well off.  His dad had built the restaurant into a popular place, and he inherited it.  He was the ""chef""/owner, which meant he'd come on the line for an hour or two on Friday and Saturday to fuck things up.  He'd yell constantly during that time; it was the worst part of the week.  There was no chef, there was no kitchen manager, the menu was 20+ years old, the kitchen systems were a mess.  Anyway, every night, virtually 7 nights a week, he'd float into the bar around 8 p.m. from wherever, and look around like he was thinking about having a drink.  Oh, hmm, I don't know...maybe I'll a have a drink this evening...  Then he'd make his way to his stool at the end of the bar and order a shot of Grand Marnier.  Then he'd drink an entire bottle's worth of that sweet shit, sometimes more, shot by shot.  When he wasn't drunk, the barstaff were employees and he was brusque with them.  But after a bunch of shots, he'd alternate between leering and hitting on them (they were all women; he wouldn't hire men for the bar), and talking to them like they were his personal friends, telling stories and keeping them from doing their jobs.  He'd been stopped by cops numerous times driving home drunk, but they would let him off, because he was part of the good ol' boy network.  One night he missed a turn on a country road and rolled his Bronco down a hill, where it came to rest upside down.  He was there for an unknown amount of time before a cop saw his taillights.  He was banged up but otherwise okay.  After that he was contrite, like a changed man...for about two weeks, then he was right back on his stool, as if nothing had ever happened."

I bought up a tavern a bit over a year ago as a fallback/investment in a volatile oil market (ex oilman if you haven't guessed), and have spent all my time breathing new life into an older kinda run down but steady place.  The old owner wanted out and let the place run down on the IDGAF mentality.  Anyway, I was heading closing shift in the kitchen a few nights ago, shut the lights off and went out to the patio for a beer or three before heading home.  There were a few younger guys out there talking about all the new stuff going into the place and stuff being fixed up, etc...  when one of them, apparently the former owner's nephew, complete with his sunglasses on at night, affliction shirt, and tribal tattoos, sounds off to his buddies about how he had the chance to buy the place two years back for half of what it fetched and how it's not doing well (despite a 40% increase in sales despite a recession, including massive food sales increases) and how the new owners are fucking idiots.  I let him ramble on a few minutes, finished my beer, and stood up.  I got the kids attention, pulled out his uncle's old set of owners keys with distinctive hand made Harley tags on it, and asked if he had anything more to say.  The look of pure shock on his face was priceless.  Guess he didn't realize that sometimes owners will actually put in the hours to make a good place happen and to take care of their investment."

On a busy Friday or Saturday night, right in the middle of the rush a dude sits down at the bar and starts talking shit about all the cooks working the line, while he drank. He was saying he was so much better than everyone working and we all pretty much sucked. This goes on for awhile, with the bartenders just smiling and saying ""uh huh, sure, Ok"" to all his comments. Then an hour or two later he takes out his resume and tries to apply for a kitchen job... on Friday night... during the rush... While slightly drunk... After he left when the FOH manager had time (chef had left already) he looked over the resume, made fun of it for 30 seconds then tore it up and threw it into the garbage."

Up the stairs walks this homeless lady; a total schizo. She starts yelling about Jesus and telling us degenerate drunks about the hell-fire that awaits us. The guy at the bar tells her to STF up. Bad mistake. She gets up in his face, yelling louder. He jumps off the stool, puts her in a headlock, and drags her over to the rail, screaming he's going to kill her; she's screaming too: it's a 20 foot drop to the rocky beach. Me, the bartender, the waitress are screaming ""Let her go!"" while he tries to lift her over the rail.

He has asked pretty much every female in the building on a date and has been turned down. I have also been told that he will remove any article of clothing without hesitation (and occasionally without provocation) if you ask him to. One of our older male servers has ""adopted"" him as the son he never had.  That said, Chad busts his ass. He doesn't bitch about the work, he gets it done, and he runs food when I need him to.

""I know how to cut potatoes, I've been cutting potatoes since I was 9"" ""wow and at 52 you never got any better?"".

He was actually there a year before me, and I'm about 7 years older.  This guy went to culinary school. He was never taught how to judge a steaks doneness by poking it. In that place it was always a thermometer. I get using a thermo sometimes, but a steak is easy to tell once you get used to doing it. Practice by using them both at the same time if need be and you'll pick it up very quick.   I needed him to dice some onion for my station because I knew I was going to get swamped with the special of the week. I wonder why the fuck it's taking so long. Go to the back, and he's doing it in the most convoluted way. I show him how to dice onions FAST AS SHIT(aka the way you're supposed to), and he does it for the night.  Know what happens the next night? He was doing it his way. ""That's how I was taught"". ...Yeah, and I just taught you a better way dumb fuck. Just because you're for-profit culinary school taught you one thing, doesn't mean there isn't a better way.   I like the guy as a person, but he won't learn techniques from anyone because he's a culinary graduate. I've picked up things from multiple places/people that have sped up my speed and quality. Hell I'm still willing to learn. If you have a better way, show me! I'll try it, if it doesn't work for me so be it.  This dumb kid is going to kill his dream. Listen to the people who have been doing it for a long time. They know more real world experience than your teachers obviously did. You can always pick up new tricks.

KitchenConfidential,3cqq19,cuckname,4,Fri Jul 10 05:25:32 2015 UTC,"23, dishwasher in a fine place. I worked my ass everyday for a year. Never complained. Maybe about the gum on the plates but work was work. Left after one year and got a good reference. Used that to get a new job running a broken kitchen. Best employee they got and planning to leave in 2 months. I learned prep then line then inventory and open/closing. I run into my old coworkers and even old boss and he wants me back cooking at the fine place but it looks really hard and I'm not in school or did school for cooking.   My advice to other dishwashers,  stay organized, even if the pots, pans, inserts, mixing bowls, cutlery, glasses and the plate map are piled high.. don't ever let it get all mixed up.  Know what's going on, if people are ordering one item, make sure your coming loads are for that. There's no sense in scrubbing pans they are not going to use while they need plates for mains.  Don't ever stop moving, make sure those bins are empty and if you get to the bottom then just walk around and stock, clear bins and grab backups. Every shift you are going to be asked for that item that the cook needs. Know where they are and have a place for it so you can grab it on the fly and not be digging around for a shaker cup lid or a funnel.  If you want to move up then watch how they prep, prep everything they don't want to or out of and have bills. Honestly prep is the easiest position. If you don't want to cook then I would recommend prepping. You might be slow the first couple times but do it with care and once everyone knows you can filter viel stock and do seafood they will ask you to do it instead. The shifts I have seen for preparation are early and you get to enjoy the afternoon. The kitchen is not as hot and you don't get covered in grease and have wet socks and underwear. I'm almost done my degree and I'll be checking out of the F&B world. I got mad respect for the service hour grinders and a part of me is going to miss putting food out the window but I never saw it as a permenate thing.   My last piece of advice, don't do what I did at my first job in the kitchen, yes work your ass off but do it more than for the paycheck. Actually learn something and move up as much as you can before you leave. Trust me grinding it out in the pit teaches you nothing other than grinding it. Even if you know you are leaving, have some ambition!"

Love my staff and operating of the businees, hate having to juggle working the line and running the business while dealing with the owner's bullshit knowing he pulls 10% off the top and throws himself a pity party about how cash flow is bad during the slow months and we have to hold our check 2,3 days (I hold mine up to a week) and he doesn't make a dime. He's not a retard and hes got prime location in a college town, hes making money.  He always pays us back for the bounced checks plus bank fees but its pissing me off now because hes currently on vacation at the beach when my check bounced again as well as one of my cooks.  Im stuck doing this another few months because a) the moneys better than anywhere else in town when I get it and b) I need the owners letter of rec"
KitchenConfidential,3cr2hw,chefandy,5,Fri Jul 10 03:10:37 2015 UTC,"Bounced checks are probably the final sign that a business is on its last legs.   No offense, but hiring a gm with no management exp isn't a good sign either. edit  hiring a server fresh out of college with no management experience to be your gm so you don't have to work as much means you make bad business decisions and you're lazy.   Another huge red flag.    If you're managing the restaurant, you should know if there's money to pay employees.    If checks are bouncing, your vendors soon won't be getting paid and you'll have to pay COD or buy retail.  You'll get behind on taxes/permits etc.  These are all big red flags to gtfo.  Fuck a letter of recommendation, if he isn't going to pay you on time, you shouldn't be there.  If he doesn't have money to pay you but can go on vacation, he obviously just doesn't give a fuck.   If he wants to put an inexperienced manager in charge of his failing business so he can take time off, he doesn't have his business priorities in line and won't be able to  stay open long.    My advice would be to Put some money away. You know when this guy finally closes the doors the final check is going to bounce.  I've worked in failing restaurants before and saw way too many people who work too hard and live paycheck to paycheck get fucked over by asshole owners that don't give a fuck.

Better (and less hassle) than the stovetop IMHO.  Convection: Rinse & drain, bring cooking liquid (equal volume) to a boil, pour over the quinoa, quickly double-wrap the pan with foil and put in a 375(F) oven. White = 20 minutes, red = 30. Pull and let set (covered) for about 10 minutes and fluff with a fork.  Steamer: Rinse/Drain/ect then cook just like rice (uncovered) for the same amount of time as above. Wrap as soon as it comes out and fluff after 10 minutes or so. A few times there was a little liquid left in the pan after the 20 or 30 minutes and I've had to put it back in for an extra 5 minutes."

Issue a challenge, demand satisfaction, and agree to terms of combat. If negotiating the terms proves contentious, there is no harm in recruiting a third party to mediate or even arbitrate, to keep things fair. Remember that a true gentleman maintains a modicum of dignity and manners throughout the entire dueling process, but still makes clear his intentions, with all due candor, to kill his opponent. Be punctual! This is very important, arrive at the agreed upon location at or before the time the duel is scheduled. Once the fight has commenced, you should put your full effort into defeating your opponent. Failure to do so would bring you dishonor and shows a lack of due respect towards said opponent (no matter what manner of lowdown, cantankerous, disloyal, or reckless loser they may happen to be.) That being said, should you gain, at some point in the duel, full advantage over your opponent, and he recognizes your dominance and yields, you MUST spare his life. It is the gentlemanly thing to do.   Hope this helps! Good luck and happy dueling!"

I can put them less places than squares but mostly they'll work out anywhere.  Other shapes (triangles, heptagons, etc) take some work to schedule - they may have other jobs or can only comfortably work one or two stations. They fit in but there's some finessing to make it work for everyone in the bigger picture.

KitchenConfidential,3ckmpa,Forikorder,4,Wed Jul 8 18:00:46 2015 UTC,"Try to get a job at a small meat processing facility. They will probably start you off as a meat packer or a boner. Meat packer is good, because you can start to learn to recognize the different cuts. Boner is good, because you can start to hone your knife skills and probably learn to run the meat grinder.  Boning out the trim starts out being really hard. You will be hacking away like a numbskull while the guys beside you are effortlessly taking the meat off the bones. You will have to sharpen your knife a lot, while the other guys can keep their knives sharp all day. However, with practice you will be able to tell where the bones are and push your knife expertly alongside the bones, removing the meat without dulling the blade.  As your butchering skills improve, you will develop a kind of x-ray vision. You will be able to plunge your knife into a joint and pop it open. You learn hand movements like karate class. Slice, plunge, twist, pop, slice and you got a boston butt or a chuck eye or whatever.   You got to find the right sized place to work for. If the place is too small it will be hard to move up. You might get stuck boning out forever, because they don't need anyone on the cutting table. If a place is too big then you might as well be working at a factory, just doing the same stroke hour after hour, day after day for weeks. Find a place with like 15 people. Big enough for you to be able to work your way up to the cutting table, but small enough for you to be able to learn a variety of skills.  It's like any other profession. If you are serious about developing your skills, you will go right past the misfits who are just there for the paycheck. In a few years you will be a pretty good butcher.  As you work your way up, keep your eyes and ears out for a master butcher. A master can show you little tips and tricks to make your cuts better and faster. You really need a master to get to that next level."

KitchenConfidential,3cm202,3_STAR_CULINARY_GOD,2,Thu Jul 9 00:32:07 2015 UTC,Is the quality of the cheese that is pre sliced just generally lower than block cheese?
KitchenConfidential,3cm202,jg87iroc,3,Thu Jul 9 03:27:58 2015 UTC,"Yes. It exposes more surface area of the cheese. So while it might be otherwise stored and sealed properly, it definitely has a shorter shelflife."

KitchenConfidential,3ckfrf,bloodymonty,24,Wed Jul 8 16:37:06 2015 UTC,"I work for a restaurant group. My official title is Sous Chef but that's not really accurate beyond my paygrade. I am a good glue piece; when our culture gets a little unhinged I'm the guy they send to get it fixed and figured out. I'm the guy who makes other people better by figuring out what motivates them and where they need to improve. I'm not a perfect cook, but I'm a very empathetic understanding person, and line cooks are like probably the easiest people on earth to figure out. I also manipulate them into being better people to one another, this means different things at different times; sometimes you just keep killing an asshole with kindness until he comes around, sometimes you force a confrontation between two people who keep talking shit behind one another's back but won't hash it out, sometimes it means explaining other people's thought processes to other people.  I handle all the stupid bullshit problems and excuses people come up with every day as a reason to not do their job so Chef doesn't have to. I lead by example, practice what I preach, and try to make everyone follow suit.  It is suprisingly easy if you genuinely believe in the food and yourself, and you genuinely care about the guys in the restaurant working with you; even FOH.  It's pretty okay. I'm getting tired of the long hours and not seeing my family. Thinking about finding a catering gig or something."

I haven't worked in a kitchen for about 3 years so I'm just getting back up to speed.  It's great though, my chef is great and the sous really likes my knife skills, so it hasn't been tough getting back into things.  It's a pretty open kitchen, it isn't too hectic so the better cooks have time to show me things that I otherwise would have had to teach myself.  The other day I was trusted to cook a few steaks as well as some chicken breasts on the grill, which was nice since my experience has always been in bigger kitchens where I was put on fry/salads.  I was also given the opportunity to make an alfredo sauce from scratch beside the sous while he was doing his, which was awesome.  I've never had experience on saute in a commercial kitchen before so it was kind of a treat to get to do that.

KitchenConfidential,3cjt10,mideon2000,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:29:04 2015 UTC,This is a good one. Is golf a tough one to crack if your 26 and havn't played before?
KitchenConfidential,3cjt10,mideon2000,2,Thu Jul 9 08:44:44 2015 UTC,"I work at a golf course and while there are some rules and etiquette to follow, it is really easy to get into. There are plenty of city courses everywhere that have areas where you can practice chipping and putting for free. All you have to do is walk over there and practice. The range costs money, but 10 bucks for a giant bucket of balls is not much. Lots of people hang out and make it a day there. Once you get better you can try going on the course. Just look up the basics. Don't worry so much about how good you are. Most people are not that great, but merely adequate at best. The main thing is not going too slow and holding up people behind you.   So short answer is no it is pretty easy to get into. My suggestion would be to just buy a really cheap set. You can get a brand new set and bag from places like dicks for about 150. You can also find sets at craigslist, but you have to be careful. They sell shitty old clubs that are worthless from 30 years ago for prices that you can get a newer set for. Lemme know if you want some advice or have any questions."
KitchenConfidential,3cjt10,mideon2000,1 point,Thu Jul 9 11:55:59 2015 UTC,"This is great advice and will totally help me along, I was a bit afraid to even ask in there given golfing and what I thought it's clientele would be like.

I have met millionaires that are jerks and millionaires that are humble and polite. You will fit in just fine. As for getting clubs that are fitted, that is not important right now. Right now you want a few shitty clubs to practice with and hit some balls. If you like it,you would do yourself a world of good by taking lessons instead of getting custom fitted clubs that are really expensive. Fitted clubs are for people that are pretty hardcore about it and want to improve any way they can. Someone can could custom fit you a set and give you a shitty set right now and you would hit them the same because your form and swing mechanics are what really is important.  So basically you just want to dink around. Think of it as a relationship. You are dating right now, you don't want to put a finger on her yet. Lemme know if you got any other questions. Id be more than happy to help."

KitchenConfidential,3cjt10,zerostar_,1 point,Fri Jul 10 08:58:49 2015 UTC,"Something to keep in mind, lots of courses have daily green fees. That means you can play early in the morning and stay all day on the course (you can still practice all day for free in the practice area, you just have to purchase range balls to hit on the range. They usually cost about 10 bucks for 100 or so). Because of this it gets cheaper throughout the day to play. Also plenty of courses offer get golf ready classes and clinics. The get golf ready classes are 5 clinics you attend to learn the basics and rules of golf. I think it is about 100 bucks and is for beginners. Each course has different things they offer. Our course has a ladies clinic where ladies come out and practice together. This is also a great way to meet new people and playing partners. Golf is a great way to get some solitary therapy. The landscape is beautiful tranquil and when you hit a ball perfectly you can get hooked. There are also people that say screw that and get a blue tooth speaker, grab some friends, drink on the course and have a good time as well as endless ways to gamble. Depends on how you want to approach it. Either way get out there and have fun.   One last thing, don't put up with assholes working at the course. Some of the younger guys go to golfing school (kinda like culinary school) and think they are the greatest thing ever. They are a dime a dozen. They should provide EXCELLENT customer service. If they are condescending talk with the head pro or manager and let them know and try somewhere else. As with all things there are good and bad ones. Luckily the majority are good."

You could probably get their position (or maybe even a corporate audit position) just by presenting a write-up of things you find to be inexcusable to corporate management.  Document these things with timestamps and (if you can, picture evidence).  Keep all the documents you accumulate and in your off-time just organize it into something that a business professional would appreciate.  Send it out to corporate with your ideas with how to fix things.  If it's comprehensive enough, corporate will be impressed by a magnificent magnitude. Maybe they will contact you and have you do this for all their locations. Maybe you will get a job in corporate for this company.  Maybe you will be promoted to head chef for displaying competence in your field.   I can guarantee that you won't make any friends at this location this way, but fuck that, these are people you don't want to be friends with anyways.  I know it may sound like a lot of work, but it can also be viewed as a great outlet for your frustrations. Document everything and send it to corporate, and you will get your sweet revenge.  Not to suggest that you are out for revenge, but there is a certain justice that will come of this that I'm sure someone of your stature can appreciate.

Usually - at least in my mind - the generic term special is short for special item, something that is not on the regular menu.  It might be around for a day or two until it runs out.   Some places, like a pizza place, use the term special for their special deals.  Like on Tuesdays a large pepperoni is $2 off.   For something as you described, I would call a featured item.   It's the same as it always is on the regular menu, and it's still the same price, we are just pointing it out to you ""because it's really good"" (we want to sell more of it).  They could of course also just be shortening the word specialty, into special, but I don't really see that as correct usage.    Edit:  The word special has lost all meaning to me now.  It is no longer special."

(He is featured in the book Fast Food Nation.)  That job as a sous absolutely killed my passion.   I wasn't ready for it, and unfortunately neither were most of the people who worked there in higher positions.   I signed up for networking classes and quit my job the next day.

Working 14 hour days 6 days a week in a tiny hot kitchen is a bitch but what is awesome about it is the freedom. I can change the menu when I want and go where I want to go.

It's easier now than ever to start getting educated on food systems, and more importantly sustainability.  The most successful entrepreneur chefs in the next ten years will start pouring most of their resources into sourcing more locally and more sustainably.   You could be that source. Micro greens, sprouts, greenhouses. Specialty animals. Specialty poultry. Pick something.  Raise it with love. People are getting back to their local food system, because a globalization of our food wasn't as efficient.  That's my 2 cents.  Also not as fun but waste managements for restaurants will soon come under the gun. Expect regulations within 5-7 years."

I've thought about going back to school for nutrition and going that route - maybe cook for sick people who need special diets.

Usually they bar staff have experience, furthermore a fair few are managers (in my experience)  Odds are, no, they aren't hiring. But the fact you walked up and showed the initiative will give you a chance, even though they're full.   When they say they aren't, offer them a copy of your resume (note: Write the damn resume) to hold onto. I  There's a ton you could learn in the best nearby places. Even if you just prepped veggies for a month.. Or two.. You'd still be learning a lot.   I mean, if it's a 3 star restaurant, odds are no, you don't have a chance. Keep it slightly more reasonable - 1 star you've got a chance, but you can expect that to be similar to being thrown into the deep end.   If nothing comes from that, hey, at least you tried. Then move onto the local places that are hiring.. Or, do as I've always done, and just keep introducing yourself and handing in resumes. Look good, smell nice, be there before lunch service. Y'know, 10-11:30 for most restaurants. After lunch and before dinner is okay, but a little iffy."

I used to baby it and constantly agitate and break it apart, but it takes so much time and energy, especially considering it has to get broken down into chunks small enough to spread on a pizza. If they don't take the time to thaw it, break it into tiny chunks, THEN put it on the grill, it tends to be a burnt lump about the size of a ping pong ball with pink, cold insides, which I'm sure tastes amazing on pizza and in hoagies.   He doesn't do freezer pulls, pretty much ever, I don't know if it's a forgetful thing or if it's on purpose.

Some of us were, from the very start, figured out to just eat shit and just tell your sous you didn't prep enough early on. That way things get done right. You still feel like a douche for not doing your job properly, but at the end of the day the last sausage is exactly like the first.   ""Everybody does it"" was never a valid excuse anywhere, and is the lowest of standards. It might fly in some kitchens, but none that driven cooks want to work for."

I took a photo finally so that I could share it with some people who might understand my frustration, I am the best fucking kitchen worker they have and if I want to take 5 seconds to take a photo to make myself a little happier, I fucking will.

KitchenConfidential,3ccnov,Phil_Dakuchi,4,Tue Jul 7 12:17:47 2015 UTC,"before you sit down I'd let the manager know your situation   This.  If I know of an actual gluten allergy in the restaurant, I'm making damn sure that our kitchen isn't contaminating shit."
KitchenConfidential,3ccnov,lernington,5,Wed Jul 8 00:24:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but ""don't go out to eat ever"" kinda blows. Instead, she goes, she tells them it's an allergy (or she does when I'm around), and accepts the risk. Often she gets sick, but often she doesn't."
KitchenConfidential,3ccnov,iagox86,4,Tue Jul 7 05:23:29 2015 UTC,"Pro tip, don't call it an allergy. Celiacs is not an allergy, its an autoimmune disorder that is caused by the body not being able to process gluten. She has an intolerance, not an allergy, if you use the wrong terms, I assume you're full of shit. If I hear the word Celiac from a server I take crazy precautions, if I hear, 'gluten allergy' I get pretty pissed. A Celiac person also knows its a serious situation to go out to eat, and they have learned the ingredients that they need to avoid and read the damn menu carefully before ordering."
KitchenConfidential,3ccnov,nlamson,3,Tue Jul 7 19:20:25 2015 UTC,"I'm well aware of exactly what Celiac is. I use 'allergy' when people don't understand, because it's the same idea (eating it => shitty situation). But for what it's worth, allergies are also auto-immune disorders, technically, so they aren't terribly different at the core.  Anyway, I guess in the last couple years things have been changing (it's been a couple years since I've lived near them, so I haven't eaten out with them much). Back then, at least, when I said ""Celiac"" I got blank looks, but when I said ""allergy"" people understood.  She frequently orders off a gluten free menu and tells the server she has Celiac. I've found she gets sick from it more often than not. When I use the word 'allergy' and ordered off a GF menu, we've had reasonable success. Though none of that is statistically significant.  The problem is that even trace amounts can affect her a great deal. When I cook for them, I'm very careful to clean and wash every surface I use and to keep bread and flour away. But at restaurants, that's obviously not possible.  Short of going to a pure-GF restaurant - and it's pretty cool that they do exist! - there's not really much we can do other than hope. I just find the word 'allergy' tends to work."
KitchenConfidential,3ccnov,iagox86,7,Tue Jul 7 19:57:24 2015 UTC,"You may want to watch what you're ordering more than how you're ordering. For instance, if you order anything fried, they can't change the oil for one order, so your food is probably being fried in the same oil as breaded food. Many dressings are made with malt vinegars or soy sauce. Many meats have been marinaded, typically in something with soy or malt. If you are going to a pizza place that uses flour to toss dough, that flour becomes a fine particulate in the air and it is literally impossible to ensure no cross contamination. Most places don't have the ability to cook/toast/grill food on more than one surface, if soy was used on the meat on the grill before your food went down, even if we scrape the grill, or even if we wipe down the toaster, there is no way to guarantee. Starch is used to thicken a whole lot of things, wheat starch being super common. Processed deli meats can contain gluten, as many different ingredients are used to bond and preserve the meat. Chips of any kind can be made with starches or contaminated oil. Vegetarian substitute foods like the vegi-meat, imitation bacon, imitation seafood etc, can contain seitan, which is just wheat gluten. Imitation seafood is in a lot of items, especially super cheap sushi and Chinese food. Pretty much any cream sauce/creamy soup/gravy is thickened with flour or a starch. Even the awesome milkshake isn't safe, it was called a malted milk back in the day for a reason. Also, even items labeled gluten free are able to contain less than 20 ppm of gluten, for the average celiac that is a low enough threshold, however she may be more sensitive than the average person.  TL;DR: Most of the items making her sick are really hard for servers and kitchen staff to identify as having gluten. It is far less likely that she is getting sick from careless cross contamination, and more likely that they are simply unaware of how vast and varied gluten really is. The perception that it should be on the wait staff or kitchen staff to know these things is where all of the problems began, they make minimum wage, and they aren't scientists."
KitchenConfidential,3ccnov,nlamson,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:27:48 2015 UTC,"That's all great advice! She's asked servers about many of those things, though, so I suspect she knows all that. Marinades and soy sauce are the ones I never think of.   I feel bad for her, though.. I'm mostly vegan (I eat vegan at home, and at omnivore restaurants I just avoid anything that's obviously non-vegan). If I ask for a meal without cheese, average restaurants forget probably 10% of the time. That's fine for me, I usually just scrape it off, but for her she might not even know and it'll make her sick."

KitchenConfidential,3ccnov,L488,26,Tue Jul 7 03:41:33 2015 UTC,Absolutely. The restaurant shouldn't have to accommodate food allergies. If you're allergic to shellfish don't eat a seafood restaurant.
KitchenConfidential,3ccnov,SonVoltMMA,20,Tue Jul 7 03:46:06 2015 UTC,"why shouldn't they? they don't HAVE to accommodate allergies, but they should because it's the fucking hospitality industry and they need to stay competitive. if a restaurant is unable to serve a guest food that they can eat then they shouldn't serve the guest. if a restaurant is aware what food will make a guest sick and they still serve them that food then it is 100% on the restaurant."
KitchenConfidential,3ccnov,L488,26,Tue Jul 7 03:58:36 2015 UTC,its not really possible though to be 100% certain that 0 cross contanimation happened unless you deep clean the entire kitchen before making the food you just have to do as much as realistically possibl;e
KitchenConfidential,3ccnov,Forikorder,7,Tue Jul 7 04:59:02 2015 UTC,also things go volatile at high heat.
KitchenConfidential,3ccnov,Phil_Dakuchi,-3,Tue Jul 7 12:20:46 2015 UTC,"Even then, they could eat at your establishment and have a reaction to something to were exposed to somewhere else.

KitchenConfidential,3ccnov,JustinPA,8,Tue Jul 7 06:05:30 2015 UTC,"That's all well and good but if you have an illness that causes you severe distress or even possible death if your food is contaminated with another food that it is completely reasonable to assume the restaurant is handling (peanuts, shellfish, pasta, etc) it is pretty unreasonable to expect the restaurant to have CDC-level decontamination and quarantine capacities to 100% guarantee that no trace amounts of those ""poison foods"" end up on your plate.  If there's a vegan restaurant or a gluten-free restaurant or a peanut/shellfish-free restaurant that builds their kitchen around the absence of those substances I think it'd be reasonable enough for someone with the associated disease/allergy to eat there and hold the restaurant accountable but other than that it's just downright silly to put your health and safety in the hands of random cooks, dishwashers, and servers.  This really shouldn't be news to anyone."
KitchenConfidential,3ccnov,thepensivepoet,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:01:34 2015 UTC,Very true.  We straight up turn down any crazy allergies.  It's not worth it.

But the fact is that this kind of thing isn't like the old ""walken/walk-in"" sign or whatever, you're straight up insulting people and posting the evidence online where anyone, even those who don't work in kitchens can see.   There are also a lot of people out there working in kitchens right now that seriously have this attitude and seeing other people say what they're thinking (whether you're being humorous or not) then get this idea in their heads that it's alright to bitch and moan and cuss about dealing with requests from guests.  And it's not OK. Just throwing my opinion out there."
KitchenConfidential,3ccnov,Sulfate,23,Tue Jul 7 03:02:35 2015 UTC,"And it's not OK   Since you've pressed the issue: yes, it really is okay.    Every job has things that are annoying.  Every worker in every job bitches about these things.  (Perhaps you're the sole exception.)  This is not in any way counterproductive: it's about as ubiquitous as fucking gravity, and you'll have about as much success in fighting it.  Trying to crack down on this sort of thing is not only pointless, it's demoralizing.  People inherently need to complain, which is basic psychology, and finding common ground with your co-workers is one of the fundamental building blocks of creating a cohesive team.  In the service industry, commiserating about shitty customers is easily the fastest way to get there.  Calm the fuck down, man."
KitchenConfidential,3ccnov,AdventureArtist,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:11:32 2015 UTC,"I do agree with you. I also think about how I would feel if a caught a server in the back of a BBQ restaurant saying fuck meat eaters, they disgust me. Too much of the dining public at that restaurant is meat eaters, and I would think how could that not affect service.   I'm not saying it's the same here, the kitchen in a cosmos in itself, but we're approaching a place in the dining ecosystem where dietary preferences are becoming a larger part of the experience of eating out. The winners will be those of us who embrace the change, not feel like it's some one-off pain.  ""commiserating about shitty customers is easily the fastest way to get there."" There are shitty customers for sure, and they're fun to complain about. But when we classify this up and coming massive market of gluten free folks as shitty, we're doing ourselves and our establishments a disservice in the face of a changing paradigm."
KitchenConfidential,3ccnov,Sulfate,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:26:17 2015 UTC,"A professional doesn't let their personal feelings affect the way they perform their job.  To use your example, if a server with a distaste for omnivores allows her opinions to affect his or her job, you have a problem: her simply complaining about something is merely human nature.  If it wasn't that, it'd be something else: one of our most universal traits is whining.  We do it for the same reasons that some people yell, scream, and kick over equipment, and in a much more constructive way.  Without an outlet, you're running the very real risk of a guy in whites on top of a clock tower with a sniper rifle.  I get that that's not really what you're talking about, even though your first post really did come across as such.  You're concerned that this ""fuck special snowflake orders in the ass"" perspective is dangerous for business, and you're kinda right.  Again, only as right as the professionalism of the individual, but still kinda right.  There are different classes of shitty customers, in my opinion.  The guy screaming at the hostess in an attempt to get his meal comped is shitty in his way, but the page-long list of ""adjustments"" or the seafood-allergy that requires you to muck a deep fryer in the middle of a rush is shitty too.  I've merely put them in order of descending severity because while some things are reasonable and some aren't, they're all just shitty parts of a job.  tldr: Bitching, in and of itself, means very little."

Forget all the shit and remember the cool guy at the corner table who always buys a round for the kitchen, or the lady who always makes sure to smile when you look out the window, or the kid who asks to tour the kitchen to see where his mac 'n cheese gets made.   And I'm also always going to remember the regular who'd sit down at the grill side of the bar in 90 degree weather and chat with me and was genuinely interested in my career and also had a pork allergy that made things pretty damn complicated.

KitchenConfidential,3ccnov,hajsallad,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:39:17 2015 UTC,People seem to forget that the service industry isn't about letting the guests fucking you in the ass. Its about making the guests happy. If someone is gluten intolerant or muslim its shouldn't be about making a dish to fit their dietry choice but to make a dish they enjoy eating while fitting their dietry choice.  Gluten free substitutes taste ass or at the very least worse than the alternative. Picking a dish (which what a good waiter should help with) that is easier to not make half ass substitutes is a going to make it more fun for the cook and the result will be better for the guest.   And if the guest is dead set on fucking you in the ass you take it regardless of what you think.

Train a dishwasher and promote him/ her.  This will get a motivated person on your side plus show the line cooks that their employment isn't permanent.  If you know the menu and all the stations, start to gradually re-work an item's mise en place so that it can be fired a la minute and not microwaved. Do this for each item, as much as the menu will allow.  As for firing items, your whole outlook has to be ""little details, big minutes"". Watch what the line cooks are doing and how they approach completing tasks."

KitchenConfidential,3ce3u2,nlamson,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:50:38 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately its damn near impossible to change a kitchen that is so engrained in being shitty. Your best bet is to start demanding better work, let those people quit who don't want to do the job correctly, and hire in new people who give a fuck. If management wont allow you to do this, take your experience and your hard working self to another kitchen. Always know that there is another restaurant out there, people stay in shitty kitchens because they're afraid they wont be able to find another job, but guess what, every kitchen needs a good worker and decent management can recognize one when they see it.   As for calling tickets, I employ the scanning method. When my hands are occupied by something that doesn't require my eyes, I scan down the entire line of tickets looking for keywords, stuff that has to be fired or takes longer than the rest. Pretty much the worst thing ever is to see someone stopped, doing nothing, gaping at tickets like they're in Chinese. This, like most kitchen skills, comes with time and practice and learning how long each dish/item takes to cook."

Find someone who knows kitchens and hire them. Pay them decently but keep that secret from the rest of the staff (oh god that can be bad if that gets out).   You need a gun slinger of a chef/cook that can come in and put that kitchen in shape.   I've managed businesses, I've managed kitchens. The one thing I know is that if I am in over my head I absolutely need to find someone that is more of a bull than myself.   You said it yourself, you need help, so find it. Pirate it from other restaurants if you must, but be damned sure when you hire that person on that they are aware of what you expect of them and understand what they expect of you.   Those salty dogs are out there, respect and communication is everything when you find them, but they will save your ass in this situation.

I was constantly asking for just 6-10 more 1/9th pans, and every time that I did not have enough pans to use, I'd point it out to management.    It took over a year before they ordered those pans for me, and when the F&B tried to brag about how she finally got my pans, and make it sound like she did me a favor, I reminded her that I'd been asking, weekly, for over a year, and they just ignored me.

Multiple special diets that need to be prepared / packaged separately due to food allergies, size restrictions, item substitutions, or other nutritionist orders.  Each service includes a soup, 2 entrees (with sauces), 3 sides, and dessert.  The facility serves special diets the same menu (as much as possible) as everyone else, so serving people with chopped and ground diets involved making sure those portions of the entrees were cut to specific size requirements, which then had to be sent separately from the main hotel pan the normal entree was sent in.  There were people on various floors that had gluten-free diets, seafood allergies, shellfish allergies, low-acid diets, low-salt diets, nut allergies, renal diets, and various other things to deal with.    When you've got 6-8 items that each may possibly need as little as a single portion prepared / packaged separately, and sometimes more because of multiple special diets, for each of 6 floors, then it's easy to see how one person can easily use 45 1/9th pans in a single service."

I only took the job because I was moving in a few months and I didn't think it would last that long.  All their meat was smoked in a 2 foot by 4 foot electric smoker that was filled with 1/2 cup of pellets. What little flavor the meat had was killed by us refrigerating it and reheating in a skillet for service.  The ordering was a mess: the KM had never ordered and only cooked shitty bar his entire life and was in way over his head. GM was a typical head-up-his-ass know it all and was prone to flying into screaming fits. He couldn't drive (DUI) so it was my job to pick him up every morning.  In the three months I was there we went through five cooks. It was a fucking joke. Of course, pay was under the table and my hours went from 40/week to 15 once the opening hubbub died down.  I left once they got busted for posting fake yelp reviews (two glowing, 5 star reviews amidst dozens of one stars) and they put the building for sale in craigslist a few weeks later."

I work in a local BBQ joint, one of the biggest/busiest in the city, probably the state. This is so wrong on so many levels.  There are ways to refrigerate BBQ and reheat it and still have it taste good (but still not nearly as good as fresh) but throwing that shit in a skillet is probably the worst possible thing you can do besides nuking it in a microwave.  The other thing, trying to cook a restaurant's worth of food (even a small one) on a little pellet cooker like that is just plain old ass backwards stupid."

KitchenConfidential,3cb7vm,Texyone,2,Tue Jul 7 10:14:20 2015 UTC,"The first job I ever had was in a restaurant like this. First off this was in a very small town, and the health department would always give warning before coming as they were friends with the owners, and the restaurant would shut down for a month beforehand to clean up in order to pass. There was a hole in the ceiling in the kitchen, like you could see straight out. Flies everywhere! I am allergic to mold and it would mess me up so bad every time I worked! The equipment was constantly in a state of being broken and held together with duct tape and glue. I was a food runner and part of my responsibilities was that when the toaster caught on fire, grab a towel and put it out and then scrape the burnt part off the toast before the plate went out. This is just a few of the many shortcuts taken."
KitchenConfidential,3cb7vm,Chives_Bilini,2,Tue Jul 7 00:44:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah. Just left one.  It was a second job I had, a bar located in a rented space downtown amongst a farmer's market. The food there was decent, the GM knew how to cook very well but didn't train a lot, and there were times I had to flag him down to learn a menu item. Seeing as this was my first job on a line in 2 years, he had to come down often. The Bartenders and servers would tell me things weren't right after they gone out, and finally after 6 weeks I got the remainder of the menu down. More often than not I worked alone, so there wasn't a ton of training from other cooks.  So that's the good parts. The kitchen itself was a back room. Nothing special about it, a walk in was put for the bar and a lot of wires ran through there to a loft the owner built. There were no hood vents (too expensive, according to the owner) and the kitchen even lacked floor drains. Despite doing 400 plates in a night some nights, the dishpit was a very small 3CS and a wire rack with towels on it to dry. There was an ant mound growing under the oven, and despite sweeping it out every night I was there it always come back. No stove or fryer- there was only hot plates, a panini press, and a convection oven that had a fan that never seemed to turn off. The most things I could ever get going there was 5, and that was due to lack of space. Mind you there may be 400 people any given time too, being the only open restaurant on the river in town.  I switched my main job and had to take a little time off to adjust. I came back a few weeks later and there was a new KM, telling me how different things will be and how much improvement they will do. He changed the menu 4 times over my 3 shifts that week. Come to find out also, in my absence, the 4 untrained and unbloodied cooks they hired for the summer had incurred 12 majors from the health inspection that happened a week earlier. I didn't turn back from that walk away."

It was equivalent to the dissolution of marriage in everything including finances, getting thrown out of my home, revelations of cheating, whole 9 yards.

My grandfather owned a slaughterhouse right before the civil rights era. His main butchers were a father and  son african American duo. One day the son was getting out of his car at home and got attacked by a man wielding an ice pick. In the midst of this attack, the son was able to get his truck back open and reach into his knife kit. He managed to swing around and nearly beheaded the attacker with one cut. Anyway, being a black man at this time, the son was thrown into jail with no question. My grandfather then personally drove down to the jail, posted bail, and paid folks off so that his worker wouldn't get hassled.  Tl:dr my grandfather had to bribe a guy out of jail for using a butcher knife in lethal and badass self-defense."

KitchenConfidential,3c7xk4,drays,21,Mon Jul 6 00:15:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's fine when it's a douchebag like the guy featured above, but it's not so fine when someone has a legitimate reason for absence. I know a sous chef who was told if he left the line for the birth of his son, he could just not come back... That's not cool."
KitchenConfidential,3c7xk4,Oneusee,10,Mon Jul 6 01:09:50 2015 UTC,"I work on a 3 man line. My mum was in hospital for surgery. Okay, I can work while that's going on.  But after it was 3 hours late on the surgery, still in the operating theater, my head chef just sent me home. Saturday night or not, the restaurant will be around next week. And the week after that. But it was possible my mum wouldn't be.    Give me the choice between family or work, I've left. I don't care. My family always comes first; not for christmas, new years, any of that shit, but for when it matters, I'm out. If there's nobody else on staff who can run my section, nor anybody's friend who can fill in, that's really unfortunate, but I'm going regardless.  Can always get another job. Can't get another loved one. (Well, you can, but mail order brides aren't cheap)"
KitchenConfidential,3c7xk4,Timmytahtah,8,Mon Jul 6 04:07:35 2015 UTC,"If you have an actual unexpected reason to leave mid shift, i.e.: life changing event, then yes by all means. But your crew should be solid enough to pick up the slack in the event of an absence."

KitchenConfidential,3c7xk4,Timmytahtah,4,Mon Jul 6 02:07:58 2015 UTC,Being part of a team means you won't bitch out and leave everyone else who depends on you with their dick in their hand. You should never have to plan for a MISSING cook. You should have people ready to take their place.
KitchenConfidential,3c7xk4,2hardtry,3,Mon Jul 6 02:16:52 2015 UTC,"No, not at all.  If you're legitimately sick, you shouldn't be working in the kitchen.  But that's different from calling in because you're feeling an indefinable sense of ennui, or that you got a boo-boo = want to drink beer and smoke weed with your friends.  Burnt out?  Shit, we're all burnt out.  So schedule yourself off an extra day for some soul reinvigoration.  Tell chef to work it into next week's schedule.  Don't just wake up one day and decide to not go in; that fucks everyone else up, and it's irresponsible."

KitchenConfidential,3c7xk4,Mxlplx,3,Mon Jul 6 04:09:49 2015 UTC,That isn't exactly the case. Its a province by province basis.

I've never been a server, but I've eaten in plenty of restaurants and passed dirty plates to the server tons of times (though, I've probably done it voluntarily because why not help someone who's helping you?).  Do customers really prefer to have a server reach over them to pick up an inaccessible plate or glass or utensil?  Or is it that dirty plates, etc., should remain there until the customer leaves?

The alternative would be to place my hands on te table, lift my weight onto it an lean over the table and the guest at the aisle to reach it.

I don't think there's anything wrong with asking a guest to put something within your reach so you can properly clear the table. You're a human, not inspector gadget or Mr. Fantastic. Sometimes you can't reach things.  edit: We have cushy chairs at my place, and folks often push them back from the table and lounge, crossing their legs. If they do this I absolutely cannot reach the table. I often will ask them to pass me things (very politely, as mentioned above), I have no intention of climbing over their chairs to reach the table.

Whenever  I read a review or customer  that has everything seemingly wrong or the person is trying to hard to be a comedian I decide it's pretty much bs and dismiss it.

First of all, I was introduced to Chinese full time: open- close, 6 days/ week, 1 day off.  I was well payed for my time; I was doing deliveries and making better than minimum wage + overtime + tips once you broke it down hourly.  The rough part was babysitting my boss's kids between deliveries.  Two daughters and a newborn son.  It wasn't true babysitting, the boss, his wife, and their cousins, aunts, and uncles were all there, but more or less expected the daughters to entertain themselves, so I would teach them the ABC song, numbers, play games with them, whatnot.  It's cute and rewarding, but exhausting when you come back from getting stiffed and the kids want to play and sing.  On the plus side, I ate better than I have in any restaurant since.  Free meals (plural) ever full day worked.  Breakfast was rice porridge, a kind of sponge cake rolled pastry with fruit cream filling, and maybe some fresh fruit.  The main meal was between lunch and dinner, and was almost always fish, vegetables, and rice.  I'm not the biggest seafood guy, but this guy was a wizard with fish; the best I've ever tasted.  Now bear in mind, this place was a hole-in-the-wall, but did good business from their quality and service.  I can't count the number of American bosses I've worked for with larger profits that want to tell me 10% off a cheeseburger is a perk, not a way of milking your employees and taking their pay back.  All in all, I loved the job.  There were times it exhausted me, but hey, the boss was there before me in the morning, after me at night, seven days a week, with his kids to manage while cooking, so I couldn't really complain.  Also, once you prove yourself competent and trustworthy, you'll pick up all kinds of gossip about the local Chinese community (this sounds racist, but in cities smaller than NYC/ Philly/ San Fran, I can virtually guarantee they all know each other at least by name, if not personally), and you will be asked all sorts of strange questions about American culture, some of them wildly racist themselves.  Those tend to catch you completely out of nowhere.  Last thing, you will get used to a pidgin language of Cantonese, English, and Spanish, and it will fuck your English up.  You pick up the cadence and tone and catch yourself saying things like, ""I go outside and smoke nao?""  You will find yourself craving potatoes.  Who the hell craves potatoes?  You do after 60- 72 hours/ week of rice for a year."

KitchenConfidential,3c9o74,TxCookin,3,Mon Jul 6 04:58:48 2015 UTC,"The one I worked for wasn't as bad as the video, but it was also still one of the dirtier kitchens I've worked in not so much for actual dirt and grime but for just the way the food was prep/stored so on. They've leave bus bins of food out everywhere after par cooking say chicken balls or wings or what not. I'd get there for 4pm (dinner would start at 5) and ya most of my hour was just putting away this stuff that would be sitting out ""cooling"" at room temperature sometimes since the early morning depending on how early they had to start prepping. The buckets of lemon and red sauces were never refrigerated just sat right on the floor under a table at the end of the line. They'd in the same sink one after another they'd prep the raw wings mixing in the maranade they used on them then move those into bus bins and right after a quick rinse with only cold water would proceed to dump in the bean sprouts and do shit to them next. They'd par cook the chicken strips for some dishes and dump them in that sink to with cold water to cool them down no ice baths, roasts and whole turkeys would just sit out on counters for hours ""cooling"". They did change the fryer oil every day though I've never worked in a place with such clean fryers and the area for the woks was cleaned well at the end of every day but the hood was only done the couple times a year from a company, the floor once a week maybe if they had time, the walk ins almost never and holy shit for the way things got kept in those walk ins. Raw meat over cooked, veggies just on the floor no shelf space I guess,"

KitchenConfidential,3c9o74,LannyTarg,2,Tue Jul 7 03:27:51 2015 UTC,Asian cooking is particular dirty and messy. I manage a fast casual Chinese restaurant and we keep it clean. I showed our chef the video and was told he would kill us all if it ever got that dirty. We constantly clean and it's a constant battle. But hey you gotta do it if you want to stay in business...in other news our health inspector stopped by today and we earned a 94!

Hate on me if you want, but they just don't have the same standards of cleanliness.  It became obvious that the only things that ever got cleaned directly where pots/pans and dishes.  All the little nooks and crannies around burners/woks as well as any walls where inevitably caked with years of grease.  Deep cleanings were obviously something that rarely, if ever, did happen.  Floors were filthy, and I routinely saw bags of raw meat/vegetables just sitting on the ground waiting to be prepped.  To be honest, it was pretty disgusting  Again, no disrespect intended, just wanted to share my experience. And, of course, not every place I visited had a disgusting kitchen, but the overall vibe was definitely one of not taking too much pride in cleaning one's kitchen."
KitchenConfidential,3c9o74,inexchina,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:30:01 2015 UTC,"I work in a Chinese restaurant in the U.S. It's not nearly as bad as the one in the video, but I personally wish that things were cleaner and prep better executed. We clean everything at the end of the day. However, there is no deep cleaning, which is sad. Chinese restaurant cooks in the U.S. generally don't give two shits about the quality of food they put out. Most of them weren't even cooks before they moved to America, which means plenty of bad habits and corners cut.   I would also like to say that Asian is a terrible term to use when referring to food, and especially when referring to people. Within Asia, there is a diverse array of cuisines, communities and cultures and categorizing them all as Asian is really doing a disservice to the people you're talking about. Japanese kitchens for example are notorious for being super clean. Chinese kitchens on the other hand, not so much."

There are 120-130 people living where I work - it's independent living btw - and they are so disappointed by spicy foods, every one of them.   Also, old people have like no appetite, seriously some of these old ladies will order like half a hot dog and be happy.    Don't know about your place but we do have a menu that changes daily, it's just small. 5 options for lunch and dinner. Choice of alternating item for breakfast and/or eggs to order.

Based off of the video it looks like they stopped working in the middle of service. My guess would be that they did in fact get shut down and the owner called this company to come back in and clean the place. But the cleaner decided to say fuck it and just post their shit on youtube.   Here in Tx you get 2 inspections a year. One every 6 months. It's entirely probable that no one who has visited that place saw how filthy the kitchen was therefore no report given to the county inspector therefore no problem."

KitchenConfidential,3c6d2w,chefandy,2,Sun Jul 5 11:31:56 2015 UTC,"Hood vents mix 20% outside air.  The air goes through an HVAC unit but when its over 100 degrees outside, the units can't ever keep up.  The problem is compounded in small kitchens, the refrigeration units, ovens, grill, sautee, fryers and heat lamps give off too much heat for any ac unit to keep up.   When temps hit triple digits outside its not uncommon to have similar temps under the hood vents near the grill (especially a wood burning grill).  It's the same reason its always cold in the kitchen in the winter, though much worse in the summer.  I'm lucky, now I have a giant kitchen (5,000+ sq feet) and only a small portion is under hood vents.   It's hot as fuck by the grill, but not triple digits.  The other areas are warm (80+) but not unbearable. I worked in a kitchen years ago that was maybe 400-500 sq feet with a grill, 8 burners, convection oven and a double fryer.  It was basically only the line, a dish machine and a 8x8 ft prep area with a few shelves.   We'd go outside to cool off in the summer even when it was 100 degrees outside."

KitchenConfidential,3c64ww,death_hawk,2,Sun Jul 5 09:50:28 2015 UTC,How does it happen??
KitchenConfidential,3c64ww,pizzaslut69420,2,Mon Jul 6 09:02:15 2015 UTC,"When you vacuum seal any liquid with a lot of air in it, the drop in pressure to create the vacuum can cause air pockets to expand rapidly, which can cause it to bubble over. Another hazard is trying to cryovac a hot liquid, as the same drop in pressure can cause the boiling point to drop dramatically, meaning your stock at just above body temp can end up at a rolling boil as you cryovac it."

KitchenConfidential,3c62bw,umdwg,2,Sun Jul 5 04:16:43 2015 UTC,Not sure of the difference
KitchenConfidential,3c62bw,LeeBarbs,1 point,Sun Jul 5 06:55:24 2015 UTC,Depends on how wide of temperature range you want.  Manual or snap action will swing +/- 10 or 15 degrees.  Thermostatic should have shorter range +/- 5 degrees.  So in practice if you drop a frozen burger on the grill the manual will drop lower from the set temperature and then recover over the set further.  If you can afford thermostatic get it.

KitchenConfidential,3c65pb,samwisesunbear,2,Sun Jul 5 05:25:28 2015 UTC,"Piggy-backing off this.  Parm Reggiano is definitely the go-to for Italian cooking. There's a HUGE difference between it and Parmesan. However, Grana Padano is a really nice, slightly cheaper substitute. It won't have the same sharpness or depth of flavor, but it's still really good."

KitchenConfidential,3c65pb,sensi_sensei,5,Sun Jul 5 13:43:13 2015 UTC,"Jesus Christ...  Ignore anyone telling you that Locatelli is a type of Parm, or anyone telling you there's no difference between the two. Locatelli is a particular (and very old) brand of Roman-style aged sheeps' milk cheese (Pecorino Romano). The Italian word for sheep is ""Pecora.""  Parmigiano Reggiano (and Grana Padano) are somewhat similarly-produced cheeses made of cows' milk. Sheeps' milk cheeses tend to have a mild barnyardy sort of quality that intensifies as the cheese ages - which becomes pretty strong in the more aged versions like Locatelli or other Pecorino Romano type cheeses.   You can indeed get a similar salty-umami-complexity without the funkiness or borderline aggressiveness of Locatelli if you use something like Grana or Reggiano."
KitchenConfidential,3c65pb,Cutty_McStabby,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:28:20 2015 UTC,"I never knew that was ""Locatelli"" even though that is my favorite cheese.  It was always pecorino romano.

KitchenConfidential,3c65pb,jastermareel17,1 point,Sun Jul 5 05:22:46 2015 UTC,"Asiago is too cheddary imo. Grana padano is good, but expensive... I think pecorino Romano is the best of all worlds."
KitchenConfidential,3c65pb,Formaldehyd3,1 point,Sun Jul 5 07:58:08 2015 UTC,"From what my old KM told me, parmesan reggiano is the same as Parmesan - I was told permesan reggiano meant something to the effect of ""from the region of parme"" (well, that's a loose quote from a year ago, but whatever)   Basically that parmesan had requirements - made in that region, aged for a min of something months, etc. Grana Padano lacks those specific requirements.  On pasta, we use grated grana padano. If it involves melting (we made stuffed crust veggie tarts once), we use gruyere"
KitchenConfidential,3c65pb,Oneusee,1 point,Sun Jul 5 12:10:13 2015 UTC,Ive always favored pecorino
KitchenConfidential,3c65pb,Leihran,0,Sun Jul 5 18:17:09 2015 UTC,Locatelli is a really fantastic parmesan and the real deal parmigiano reggiano is usually kinds pricey. Maybe $14 a wedge for something good. If you find that to be too expensive or too overpowering a flavor profile you could always opt for Grana Padano which can get $$. OR Pecorino.

I havent posted on here in a few months but allow me to give you some advice after you've given it to me time and time again:  When in doubt, get out. I quit restaurants. I couldn't do it anymore for exactly the same reason you're apprehensive about it. There were asshole people that I worked with in my area where I resided and I had bounced around to most places in the small community.  Everyone seemed friends with one another and someone like me was considered an outsider.   The best decision I have ever made was going to college. I managed a 3.4 GPA upon my return to school. I'm doing great and I think you have the potential to do what it takes to return to school, whether you graduated high school, or are returning to college, or even already graduated from college.   Do something you enjoy doing. If cooking is what you enjoy, then so be it. But if you're unhappy, see this as opportunity knocking on your door. Opportunity is often passed up because it takes on the appearance of hard work. Kitchen cooks are some of the hardest working people I know, so take the opportunity now that it's been presented to you and make a decision on what you want to truly do with your life."

The fucking thing EXPLODED and one of the 500ish degree doors slammed into the back of my head, my exposed neck, and part of my back.   I was unconscious for about 15 seconds they said. When I woke up, the first thing I saw was the owner standing over me and I was on him like a rabid badger. I had to be pulled off of him before I killed him.   I went home, then on the advice of a friend, went to the hospital. Took the next 2-3 days off work, not because I didn't feel like I could do it - but because ""Fuck you, the fucking stove exploded because you didn't fix it when I told you to.""   I showed up the following Tuesday and just started to work as usual. I got a couple wierd looks and a couple ""I thought you quit"" comments from other staff.  I got my paycheck, and I was missing pay from the days I didn't come to work. I went to the office and simply said that they missed 3 days of pay on my paycheck. They gave me cash.

To be honest, cash out of a restaurant owners pocket is the only form of punishment they learn from. Medical bills, a few hundred dollars and a free pitcher of beer was more than a fair price for my ""trauma.""   I wasn't seriously hurt, I was seriously pissed off."

KitchenConfidential,3c2ls9,LegendaryPrimate,2,Sat Jul 4 12:24:35 2015 UTC,"If they pay out of worker's comp, what they pay in regularly has to increase.  It works much like insurance, where if you need it, you have to pay more into it.  So in this case, if he really wanted to screw over his boss, he should have claimed worker's comp because his boss would literally still be paying for it.   At least that's how it works in my state; could be different elsewhere."
KitchenConfidential,3c2ls9,spacemanspiff30,2,Sat Jul 4 13:32:08 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, workers comp is in every state as far as I know and it sucks because it favors the employer.

So when I moved in to turn on the oven again with my flaming stick... Boom fireball in the face. Luckily no lasting damage, and my glasses luckily protected my eyes. Just some seared armhairs, one less eyebrow and a little bit of hair missing.    Learned from it, always fix something properly immediately if it is malfunctioning. Don't just jury rig it.

So during service the door would pop open frequently with mini fireballs. They had the kitchen serviced so many times before they finally found someone capable of fixing it. That was always fun
KitchenConfidential,3c2ls9,bootes64,11,Sat Jul 4 18:12:58 2015 UTC,"That's how that oven is supposed to work.  You bathe the entree in gas at high temperature, then when you open the oven, the ensuing fireball sears and crisps the surface of the food.    Learn to step back from the oven when you open the door.  Honestly, if we repaired everything you kitchen guys cry about, we'd all end up on the street.  If we're going to put money into repairing something, I can tell you right now it's going to be in the front of the house.  You fuckers got an issue in the back of the house?  Put a nail in it.

They hired you knowing your lack of experience, and my stance with those in your position has always been ""attitude is more important than aptitude."" If you're willing to work hard, take criticism, and don't make the same mistakes you'll be fine so long as you still have the drive to keep coming back. However, if the chef expects you to know everything right out the gate and isn't willing or able  to give you the time to progress, then it might not be the best atmosphere to start out in. 'Cause I guarantee you he wasn't a ""pro"" when he started either. There are plenty of kitchens out there, if this is truly an endeavor you want to pursue then find a place where you're comfortable."

He also said he thinks I have potential, but if someone comes who is better than me he will have to do whats best for the restaurant. Thing is, he does not want to employ ""natives"" because they dont want to work so many hours and in such a small kitchen, so he has a little bit of a hard time finding people. Obviously he also prefers employing people who he will make into cooks, not actual cooks. Was there himself. He is the owner and main chef right now. Can anybody comment on this for me- he does the main courses, I help, we have around 300 guests on average daily. Is this realistically possible to do? Feed all this people by having one person cook for them?"
KitchenConfidential,3c20k8,TxCookin,3,Sat Jul 4 10:00:08 2015 UTC,"how many cooks are in your kitchen? Just you and chef? This industry isn't very rewarding, unless you love doing it. I've never been in a kitchen that didn't get hot, sooner or later you adjust to that. All the cuts (and burns if you don't already have any) are the most annoying thing and you will have at least one cut for the rest of the time in the kitchen. i suggest finding your first aid kit and putting on some band aids. Find any burn meds they have for whenever you burn yourself. Theres a certain mentality amongst cooks/chefs... Generally we will keep working even if we chop the top of a finger off ( obviously after getting stitches or whatever). I've almost done that once... Manager said something as I was cutting and like an idiot I looked at him and brought the knife down on my finger. Also splashed hot oil in my face being a dumbass... Kept working though.   I served upwards of 400 people last night alone, and ran a lot of food because my managers only had one cook and one server on a Friday. Point being, yes it is entirely possible to serve 300+ people. Find your rhythm man. it really will get easier once it becomes second nature. And when you have more than just your boss in the kitchen with you (read:a different job) it's alot easier to handle/learn things.  30 menu items for your first kitchen job I can see why you feel like that's alot, but it's really not too bad. I can actually remember how to prep, cook, and plate every single menu item from my last job and I still have a lot of recipes I can cook of the top of my head.   Just do the best you can, don't sweat the small shit, ask questions constantly, and study your menu. You can do it bro"

The kitchen is 16 square meters big, and can only have two people in it, so thats how its gonna stay for now. I am btw a woman too, and a very short one, so I dont know how to balance two plates on one hand. And thats one thing I dont know how I will manage, and I feel its like super necessary for the job.

I have to and at first I was a bit nervous of taking a full tray out but I got the hang of it. I did almost drop something on a guest once though, n it was super embarrassing even though I saved it. Just keep trying at the balancing n it will get easier. I do stupid little tricks to try to keep my hands nice n reactive. Favourite thing right now is flipping an empty tray and catching it with fingertips. Would make more sense if you saw.  And I totally get the small kitchen thing, mine is almost the size of a food truck. Longer though, more like a kitchen stuffed into an American RV (caravan you might call it) so I'm literally squeezing past people most of the time  Btw, being a woman makes you no different at the job than a man ;). neither does being short hehe.

There are so many places that allow lazy food safety practices to endure that I'm surprised this doesn't happen more often.  It's the responsibility of the chef to ensure stuff like this doesn't happen, and that takes constant vigilance, checking temperatures, checking cleanliness, and checking whether people have done their jobs.  Once a chef gets apathetic, everyone knows it, morale slides and people start cutting corners.  There are a lot of people in this business who shouldn't be in this business.  They should be working in jobs where their responsibilities don't affect other people's safety."

KitchenConfidential,3bzoin,itzepiic,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:24:28 2015 UTC,I live and work 10 minutes  from there.  My guess is cross contamination of raw and ready to eat.

KitchenConfidential,3by7au,234throw,2,Fri Jul 3 16:30:51 2015 UTC,"Exactly, there are thousands and thousands of restaurants out there, do you want them to physically check each one of them out themselves? They're a simple website, and are at least better than Yelp. It's like Facebook making everyone wait in line somewhere with photo ID to get a new account, of course it's easy to make new restaurants, they don't care about that, I think they do their best to remove fake reviews, sure they leave up the crazies, but they don't let you get spammed by one person with a vendetta."
KitchenConfidential,3by7au,kochier,5,Fri Jul 3 12:57:38 2015 UTC,As opposed to Yelp?  Who allows you to advertise to suppress bad reviews?  Neither is perfect.  But TA isn't in the business of vetting reviews.  Or blackmailing people. So there's that.
KitchenConfidential,3by7au,Pris257,-4,Fri Jul 3 10:38:31 2015 UTC,"What does Yelp have to do with anything? I don't care about Yelp. Why do you? Are you paid to manage TA online reputation by any chance?  TA should damn well be in the business of vetting all its users. It purports to offer information on the quality of third party services. This is their core mission. False advertising is unacceptable, slander is unacceptable."
KitchenConfidential,3by7au,234throw,3,Fri Jul 3 14:57:41 2015 UTC,They are both in the business of crowdsourcing reviews?

KitchenConfidential,3by7au,JilaX,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:21:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, if I had a restaurant I would probably wanna get some reviews up as soon as possible in order to help draw business. Making new businesses wait to get verification would only create more bitching throughout the industry."
KitchenConfidential,3by7au,Wastedyouthcrew,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:48:02 2015 UTC,"sure. so you post your new restaurant 10 days before launch. there aren't that many restaurants, really."
KitchenConfidential,3by7au,234throw,13,Fri Jul 3 20:50:29 2015 UTC,"My issue with TA is that it puts everybody on a pedestal as a 'reviewer'. TA users are not reviewers, they are customers sharing their experience. It is not an expert opinion. I would support the site as a feedback tool more if users had to supply real names; anonymity is a feature of the Internet that breeds a snarky attitude. I'd like guests to have to state when they came and what they ate. I'd also like to see scores aggregated with professional reviews, like rotten tomatoes rather than IMDB. I know this is against the whole point of the site, but I think TA is poisonous for small businesses (disclaimer: my place is rated 4.5/5 and wins the excellence award). We have had 1/5 reviews from people who were refused a table because we were fully booked - they even commented on how good the ambience is and how good the food looks! I have a real problem with giving value to non-expert opinions."
KitchenConfidential,3by7au,Litrebike,5,Fri Jul 3 06:50:04 2015 UTC,"I've said this before: the biggest issue with TA is not astro-turfing, it's that other people have very different wants and need than we do. We dropped by an eatery in Sidari, Corfu last year, and ate deep fried fish that had obviously been frozen, along with soggy fries. It happens, especially at sea-side resorts.  Decided to read up on it on TA a bit later. It was on of the top 5 restaurants in Sidari with comments like, ""We loved it so much we had our wedding reception there!"""

KitchenConfidential,3c02fb,BlueLineMenace,5,Fri Jul 3 16:42:45 2015 UTC,"There is no such thing as comfort when dancing in the fire, brother.  Your best chance at passable relief is in a cotton t-shirt one size larger than what you usually wear (mine are usually 2XL, so, 3XL). It will be soaked with sweat within the first hour, but rejoice, for sweat possesses magical properties that turns the chef coat and especially the apron into basically heatproof armor.  If the ice gods have blessed your line with a freezer and abundant towels, sacrifice some towels to holy water, roll them up, fold them into horseshoes, and store in a metal 4-inch half-pan. Withdraw one as needed, wrapping it around the back of your neck, and rejoice some more.   Pitchers of ice water are a great multipurpose tool for us grill guerrillas. Sometimes to drink, sometimes to pour down your coat, sometimes to pour down the back of another cook in the name of team building, so long as they don't have anything hot or sharp in their hands in the moment.  Stay cool back there. We're all counting on you."

Instead, look for a restaurant that you want to be a part of. My first job was prep/dish at a restaurant i really wanted to work at. Yes i went to culinary school, but most chefs wont hire someone strsight out of culinsry school with little to no experience. Injust showed up at their back door with my knife kit day after day volunteering to stage, even if that meant peeling potstoes or cleaning. After a week of working for free for them, they made a position open for me on their pay roll. Dont take no for an answer, be pationate and let them see that passion. I got another job by finding the chef on facebook and tslking to him there. I explained that he was a  role model for me and i alwats wanted to work with him. I got a call to stage and was offered the job.   Dontlose hope, keep your passion high and work hard. If he had a hard time not hiring you, reply and let him know that yo are available and would be interested in any open position, even dish."

Initial interview, then a trial shift, then they decide hires, then training begins. The first time I applied, they scheduled me for a trial shift, then cancelled it and denied me the job. Next two times I didn't get a trial shift. This time, I did well on the initial interview, and I guess I did well enough on the trial shift to warrant them giving me a job!"

Unless you want to live off cat food on your elder years with a broken body and likely a substance Abuse problem.  The only people benefiting from this industry are the owners. Everyone else is being exploited and overworked for insanely low wages. Its a fucking scam.  I left kitchens after 10 years and my finances, heath, and lifestyle improved immensely.

If i was younger and browsing this sub i would appreciate a full variety of opinions from everyone. I do not want a self serving circle jerk about how everything is unicorns and rainbows in the kitchen. I actually think thats part of the problem.  I worked in high end fine dining as well as high end catering in one of the wealthiest areas of the country. I helped open 3 restaurants and a catering company from the ground up. I was BEGGED to stay when I decided to leave. Not only could they pay me what i wanted, but they could not provide me with a lifestyle i found healthy. I realized as i aged that i had no future worth living if i stayed in kitchens. they would simply work me untill my body gave out then throw me away.  I think that if my opinion upsets you so much there might be some truth it what i am saying. If you were happy and content you would have just ignored me. No ""cook"" i ever knew made a decent living to retire comfortable. ""lifers"" usually end up broken physically/mentally with a substance abuse problem.

Make sure you tell yourself how much fun it was working in kitchens when you are eating cat food at the age of 70 and living off 500$ a month from Social security.  This industry is designed to abuse people,use them up, then throw them away like a used condom into the gutter. EVERYONE is replaceable, expendable, and will work for peanuts. Thousands of new culinary students (completely clueless) graduate each year and thousands of others are simply desperate for work and will work for next to nothing. The industry NORM is ridiculously high turnover and anyone that has worked in kitchens for a long time know this is a fact of operating in the service industry. Its a revolving door... so why treat anyone decent? There is no incentive!  So... have fun with that, if that suits you.

A change of venue almost always brings some of that creativity, and drive back.

It's great to have the freedom to create whatever you want, but the systems that exist in corporate restaurants like Joey's are so well developed that they can really develop solid production management skills.   Yeah focusing on ticket times is annoying at times, but it's the easiest way for places that have a bunch of green cooks to make sure the guests get their food in a timely manner. It emphasizes hustle in the culture of the line. In my experience,  no one can wants to be the guy who misses a ticket and be seen as letting the rest of the crew down...   It can be a huge adjustment for a long tenured corporate cook to mesh with a non-corporate kitchen of you don't have a well rounded knowledge of culinary basics. I've seen lots of 'brand x' cooks come in and brag about how great they are at their trade only to crumble the first time they are asked to make a mother sauce.   I think I have found the right balance between creativity and specs working in a corporate kitchen that provides the banquet food for an attached hotel.  Banquet clients often request items that aren't on the banquet menu which allows for creativity.   There is no right or wrong thing to do in your career.

You learn a lot about the systems that you need to have in place to run a successful restaurant later on - if that's what you want to do. You ever watch kitchen nightmares? Those places that never rotate stock, do inventory counts, manage labor or have prep systems? That's what you're learning from a really structured chain restaurant. Running a successful restaurant isn't always about the food, it's also knowing how to be business minded at the same time. With that said, what do you want to do with your life? Do you want to move up and be a sous or a chef? Sit down with them and ask them questions about their experience. Most head chefs don't close and have two set days off in these places so it does get better. The pay does too, if you negotiate for it...and work for it. And as far as I know, Joey isn't a bad chain either."

They offer some form of benefits after a year, not that a retirement savings account will do me much good making line cook money.   At my location FOH and BOH employees are encouraged to stick around and hang out when they finish their shift, discounted staff drinks, and affordable food.

It's definitely not all sunshine and rainbows, but the extreme cynicism that can be found in this thread is, IMO, as a result of not finding the right place or right type of job.  I worked in a place where there were different menus constantly, due to all the different functions - a la carte lunch was seasonal with specials, dinner was changed weekly, and parties/events were never the same.  The pay was fantastic.  I worked a lot, sure, but I made great money, so it's not like I wasn't compensated.  Catering is one of my favorites.  Decent enough pay during prep, and parties pay a ton. Plus, there's the chance for gratuities, which can be quite substantial.  During slower times, it can easily be 9-5 (I even worked somewhere that was 8-2) - it builds in the busy season, but at least the crazy hours aren't necessarily year round.  Plus there was paid time off, a decent amount of weekends off (maybe not always a full weekend, but usually at least one day and even a Friday night as well), and rushes only ever happened sometimes at a party.  And even then, the rushes were nothing like on a line.  Plus, creativity?  We'd have cooking competitions that we'd schedule during work, and the sales staff + owners would taste it to not only determine a winner (with a cash prize), but to get on the menu.  It's not all perfect, there are still crazy weeks, but it's far outweighed by the positives.  And sure, there are some shitty jobs out there with shitty pay.  But that's certainly not all there is.  Although sometimes, there are definitely some bitter people (clearly)."

However, there's always a breakdown, seasonings can contain grain filler that isn't listed... Items that don't contain nuts may be produced at a factory that has nuts. Cross contamination can happen even under the most watchful eye. ( seafood allergy? We can't scrub the oven down in the middle of service I'm sorry.)   I'm sorry for your daughter, I truly am, but food is not prepared in a vacuum. I won't even address the hundreds of fake allergies we see week in and week out, it's unfair to you that after hearing ""deathly allergic"" to insert your item here without it being so....

KitchenConfidential,3c0xdn,saltysebastian,3,Sat Jul 4 09:09:21 2015 UTC,agreed....it is never 100% guaranteed in the restaurant I work in that cross contamination could not occur. It's just not possible to be able to promise that in a restaurant period.
KitchenConfidential,3c0xdn,hockeyrugby,-11,Sat Jul 4 14:01:28 2015 UTC,"Oh come on, my point is this was not an accident caused by cross contamination.  This was someone rattling off information like she had checked when in fact she hadn't.  I always tell the server that we understand that there is always the possibility of cross contamination (reason why we won't eat in Chinese restaurants) but this was a case of someone who didn't bother to check with the kitchen.  If she didn't want to check she could have told us that and then we would have gone somewhere else to eat.  I guess if you got hepatitis from eating in a restaurant you would chalk it up to your irresponsibility.  And I guess victims of drunk drivers are at fault too.  Hell, there is always a possibility of getting hit by a drunk driver.  I would guess the risk increases with day and night so any medical professional who works a night shift has it coming to them, right?"

I have a severe nut allergy if I come into contact with nuts I get an instant reaction (I know I'm choosing a pretty fucking stupid career) but what I would recommend doing in the future is if you are eating out with your daughter don't let her start eating the food. Get a dab of the ingredients drag your nail across her skin and dab it on. With my allergy you can tell almost instantly. If it's not that severe that you will have to wait longer do it on her lip it's a thing that take 30 seconds to do yet will save you a trip to hospital and a 6 hour nervous wait.  It's not just the responsibility of the restaurant it's also a responsibility of you as a parent and teaching your daughter the proper practices in dealing with an allergy like this.  Also didn't you have any epipens or antihistamines with you if you don't no offence but you are an idiot.   You yourself need to take some responsibility. So many people do this and are quick to blame everyone but themselves.
KitchenConfidential,3c0xdn,manimal28,5,Sat Jul 4 13:32:22 2015 UTC,We both did everything we knew to do to keep her safe.  We had antihistamines and 2 eli-pens with us but when you administer an epi-pen you still have to go the ER.  Thus my rant.  We realize that anytime she eats out she is taking a chance but like you she needs to be able to live her life.  Thank you for the nail test. No one ever told us about the nail trick.

I don't know if that ever happened but we found out after the fact that one of the ingredients in the dressing was peanut butter.  She only ate 2 bites but that's all it took.  I understand cross contamination and I understand no guarantees and I even understand if someone says don't eat in our restaurant but when we are told point blank that there are no peanut products in a dish and are reassured that it is safe only to find out that's not the case, I think that the restaurant should be held accountable."

The cook wouldn't have used the dressing if he'd known - the server fucked up, big time.   The cook couldn't have known without the server informing them - and if I got a docket saying peanut allergy - anaphylactic I'd probably prepare it on a separate bench with fresh ingredients. Yes, I'd probably cut those damn salad ingredients to order, because I do the bulk of it on my bench - and my section has 3 containers of nuts.   As for management, actually, it is there problem. They're responsible for staff training; furthermore, they need to be in control of this shit. If I served raw chicken, whoever is in charge of the kitchen at that time is getting their ass kicked.

I'm from Canada, so I assume our foreign relations with Sweden is good enough to allow youth exchanges. But Americans might be a different story, I know when I was applying for bank services, they needed to know whether or not I was an American. This meaning Americans are allowed into the country with working holiday visas, I just don't know how quickly they can get them. However, you guys let anyone into your country, that being one of the biggest issues in politics now..."

KitchenConfidential,3btjh5,foedus,1 point,Fri Jul 3 07:26:44 2015 UTC,How was the visa process for you?  I'm Canadian too and was maybe thinking about heading to Scandinavia to work for a bit but I was a little concerned about the hopes I'd have to jump through for a work visa.
KitchenConfidential,3btjh5,H0agh,3,Fri Jul 3 05:27:38 2015 UTC,"Can't speak for every Nordic country, but Sweden has a slow bureaucracy. Everything is filed in paper, and case workers have cases upon cases upon cases. The application is simple enough, just have the prerequisites of age, money, citizenship, passport etc. Once the application is in, I'd do my best and quickest to track down your assigned case worker. I tried contacting mine multiple times, and she only replied twice. Once was to tell me the wait is two months, instead of one. Second time was to tell me I've been accepted, after almost four months of waiting.  My advice is, apply well in advance, for an entry date far away from your estimated  acceptance date (apply six months away from your entry date). Also, apply to enter the country during the summertime, nothing worse than a Swedish winter, even for a Canadian. Purchase a flight that has a layover in Iceland if you're close to the northern parts, London, then Copenhagen if you're more to the south. Those prices were the best for me. Trains run everywhere, so it's easy to get to smaller cities.  I applied to enter July 15th, and it was delayed until October 15th, meaning I had to reschedule flights, numerous times, to November 7th. That was the earliest I could get a reasonably priced flight to Sweden, meaning I had already lost three weeks. If your application gets through after your applied entry date, they'll automatically make your entry date the day you're accepted. That's why I advise to apply for an entry date probably six months away. Stay for the full year, Scandinavians are kind of weird at first, but after you get to know them, they become lifelong friends.  I suggest Copenhagen, it's a great city with a thriving culture. Stockholm is nice too, very easy city to get around, safe as well. Good luck, I'll answer any questions you have."

What I'm worried most about is the base level of money required (I don't have a lot of that and I can't really afford to live hand-to-mouth in a foreign country) and working in the country vis-a-vis taxes for Canada.

I know that Casa Blanca on Ftl beach is still going strong and is amazing. All the places I just mentioned are a bit pricey. Il Mulinos is great Italian in Ftl for a more reasonable price.

If you have the money, Palme D'Or in Coral Gables is fantastic. The head chef was a sous for Robuchon IIRC. Whisk was pretty good in Coral Gables Lokal in Coconut Grove has a really good burger  Umm...other than that I wasn't too pleased with the restaurant scene in South Florida. Despite the abundance of fish in the area, there are limited reputable places to get sushi or seafood that isn't absurdly expensive.

KitchenConfidential,3bofw0,nutsallover,13,Wed Jul 1 06:06:49 2015 UTC,Hour long waits are definitely a shitty deal. But hence why you informed the wait staff so the customer would be aware.

I was still pretty busy through an afternoon one day and this server came up telling me her super moded staff meal she was going to order.  I asked if she would like to make it.

Ingredients: Walnuts    9 cups Water       1 1/2 cups Brown Sugar        3 cups Butter              6 oz Pinch of Salt   Combine water, brown sugar, salt, and butter in sauce pan Bring to boil, whisking Boil 1 minute, add walnuts Toss in syrup, cook for 3 minutes Spread walnuts out on a parchment lined tray Bake 325 F 10-15 minutes Let cool completely   Any suggestions or changes would be great, thanks"
KitchenConfidential,3bs45h,SUBTLE_CUNTS,2,Thu Jul 2 02:53:35 2015 UTC,"Try roasting the nuts before you add the sugars/fats/seasoning.   Maybe try like nuts 3 min in over at 350, toss in candy syrup, toast on silpat for 5 min, mix around on the tray, toast another five.   You could also try subbing 1/2 a cup of b sug for Steen's syrup if you can get it. Candies beautifully."

KitchenConfidential,3bs45h,starryknight,2,Fri Jul 3 01:22:34 2015 UTC,Little cornstarch down the pants keeps my nuts from sticking.
KitchenConfidential,3bs45h,delabear,1 point,Thu Jul 2 06:05:20 2015 UTC,This is the way I learned how to candy nuts:   Blanch in boiling water for a minute or so. Toss hot nuts (haha) in icing sugar to coat. Deep fry those fuckers for a few minutes until they're done. Cool on sheet tray.
KitchenConfidential,3bs45h,Charmander249,1 point,Thu Jul 2 05:23:00 2015 UTC,"When we candy nuts, 20% of the nuts' weight equals the ratio of isomalt crystals. So, 100g of nuts gets 20 grams of isomalt. After they're evenly coated, I finish it with a bit of butter, and spread it over silpat, parchment whatever. Even when it's a goddamn inferno in the kitchen, they don't get sticky."

KitchenConfidential,3bs3cb,Papas_Bravas,3,Wed Jul 1 21:17:57 2015 UTC,I wish I could upvote this more.
KitchenConfidential,3bs3cb,justalicia,5,Wed Jul 1 21:52:40 2015 UTC,"I worked for a restaurant that was interviewing sous chefs and they had a speed rack full of ingredients.  They got the list of ingredients the night before and had to plan a 5 course meal.    The chef that everybody agreed made the best food didn't get the job because he changed one of his dishes on the fly ( he used all of his tomatoes for a side dish  on his main course and forgot about his salad) .   I guess the purpose was to not only test their chops, but to see if they could execute their plan.    My advice would be to come up with a plan and execute it.  If you get a bunch of normal ingredients, Stick with what you know will work, don't try to experiment or venture off and show every single technique or how you can force ingredients to go together that shouldn't.     If your mystery box looks like a chopped episode ( ostrich egg, candy corns, pork rinds and watermelon) then you don't really have a choice other than show your creativity."

After coming back to DC I continued to work at Citronelle through the holidays. After my two years were up I resigned. I was then going to embark for Chicago, However not enough cash in the bank to afford to move and find residence in the Windy City. So I apply for a position at a Chain Food Market in Northern Virginia. The Chef (CIA Grad) I interview with asks me how long I plan to work for the company. I tell him my deal, few months save cash and move to Chicago. He puts me under another CIA grad Chef and I am given the opportunity to balance the Food Cost, conduct all the ordering and inventories, write schedules manage people, etc. After a few months of being there I am told about a Culinary Management Trainee program where I would go through a fast track two year program that would give me the opportunity to learn how to manage a food service operation fiscally and improve on interpersonal communication and progressing my culinary knowledge and skills. The company was planning on opening 5 stores in Maryland and they wanted me to be apart of that process. I've now been with the company for six years and I am the Sous Chef of their newest location in Alexandria Virginia...... I mean yeah, I feel like I may have abandoned a dream of working for every renowned chef I could possibly encounter but I'm almost 30 I have a career position in a great company, I'm not certain what will be in store for me in the future but for right now I am fulfilled with aspects of my work."

I cant emphasize enough how important it is to take your learnings seriously while at that school. You'll seldom have the opportunity to focus on your own culinary progress. I always like to tell my cooks that their development is self driven. I will always supply you with the tools and resources to be successful but I can't perfect your abilities, that comes from within. Take it seriously, ask questions, become involved with as many culinary groups and like minded individuals on campus. There is so much around you that will steer you away from taking the fullest advantage of the program you are in. Remember you are paying top dollar for this experience."

I started working in kitchens at the age of 14 as a dishwasher / server. When it came time for me to decide on a career in the culinary field I thought to myself that at the end of my schooling there would be this big reward waiting for me (job, money, happiness). Day one at the CIA Tim Ryan is giving us a speech in which he ends by saying ""The Journey is the Reward"". I held on to that sentiment for years, throughout my schooling and into the fine dinning. Put my head down, bust my ass and fast forward a few years, I now have a new outlook on the my life. There is no reward, there is only the journey."

KitchenConfidential,3bq1xw,Neder-wiet,5,Wed Jul 1 05:55:31 2015 UTC,"Stay calm, collect your thoughts, and work with efficiancy. Dont let yourself get caught up and feel overwhelmed, this will only make it worse. Try and organize the best you can, and keep your stock up. If you have 3 orders in, prioritize, what has shortest bill time, what takes the longest to cook, use this to plan you statagy for war. Remember, even if a bill time is gone over, put out the best food you can, dont make some shitty ass dish just to make that 3 min bill time."
KitchenConfidential,3bq1xw,Heinz_marble,4,Wed Jul 1 07:09:29 2015 UTC,"Organization is a big key. Make sure that whatever you are working with as far as dishes, utensils, etc. are always in the same spot. This will develop a muscle memory of where everything is and you won't have to think twice about where something is.  Cleanliness. Not sure if you are like me, but I can't stand to work in a dirty station. The more clutter on my station, the more clutter on my mind. Keeping your station clean will also contribute to organization.  Learn. Don't be afraid to ask questions you don't know the answers to, just make sure you ask them at appropriate times. You don't want to be asking questions about prep in the middle of the rush unless you absolutely have to. Also, ask others with experience in your line of work about tips and tricks to simplify and quicken tasks. Information is valuable, and anyone who isn't a complete prick will be glad to share their knowledge."
KitchenConfidential,3bq1xw,MrBrink10,3,Wed Jul 1 08:06:08 2015 UTC,"Breathe. Have your station organised, have everything you need close to you so you don't need to run away to the walk in under service.   It takes practice, that's about all you can do, but in a clean, organised, well stocked station it'll be fine."
KitchenConfidential,3bq1xw,nickachu_,2,Wed Jul 1 09:47:13 2015 UTC,"Always ask questions, I also do whenever I go to a new place.  I just took over as the Exec. at two restaurants and I must have asked a 100 questions a day for the first two weeks.  The owner and employees might have been annoyed, but now four months in everyone is glad I did ask them all.  When it comes to staying on top of it all it takes time and practice.  Work hard, concentrate on everything going on around (even if its not your responsibility), and when you mess up own it and move on that's what chefs want out of line cooks."

KitchenConfidential,3bol0g,g4r4e0g,3,Tue Jun 30 23:24:23 2015 UTC,"As it should be. A business shouldn't be able to salary six people and have them work 60 hours. A kitchen needs two, maybe three salaried managers and one or two shift leaders.   This is exactly what I proposed to my last job when I was working 60 hours for $28k doing $40k days. Fucking cheap fucks."
KitchenConfidential,3bol0g,securicorscares,2,Wed Jul 1 02:11:06 2015 UTC,Still no federal overtime rules for seasonal work though 😪. Luckily I get overtime after 45 hours because of state laws where the company is based.  But that's great news for people who now qualify! $23k/year seems awfully low to not get any overtime.

KitchenConfidential,3bol0g,yeroldfatdad,3,Wed Jul 1 02:12:56 2015 UTC,Wouldn't be on salary any more. Back to hourly wages.
KitchenConfidential,3bol0g,Illumidark,7,Wed Jul 1 03:04:47 2015 UTC,"Look at it this way, they may be cutting your hours but they will have to hire others to fill the hours you were working.  There is no way this is a bad thing industry wide. Every employer taking the same tack as yours will have to hire new employees to fill the hours they are cutting from the existing ones. Every employer that wants to rely on single people to fill more then one person's job will have to pay the overtime their employees deserve.  Demand for labour is going to go up industry wide as employers can no longer rely on underpaying hard working people by calling them 'managers' and have to hire more people to cover the hours they need or pay overtime to those that work hard to keep the business open. Higher demand for labour will create upwards pressure on wages as businesses have to compete for skilled people. Unemployment will go down in the industry as it normalizes back towards a 40hr work week, and the ability to reliably find a new job because of lower unemployment will allow workers to exercise their rights and leave abusive or underpaid situations more readily.  Sorry to rant, this has been a personal belief of mine for a while that the lack of mandatory overtime is a major factor keeping the labour side of the income stream low. I'm really sorry that right now you're getting caught in the harmful short term effects of change, but I hope that I'm right and a few years from now you are happier, making more money working for employers with more respect for your time once the changes have had a chance to change the way the system works."
KitchenConfidential,3bol0g,securicorscares,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:24:02 2015 UTC,Last August labor cost was 8%. Didn't see a fucking dime for that. I've been hourly ever since.
KitchenConfidential,3bol0g,cubby13579,1 point,Wed Jul 1 05:49:57 2015 UTC,"Not to sound like a prick, but kitchen workers and blue collar workers in general are rightfully dubious of labor laws and ""the man"".  I too see this as only a good thing for laborers, but guys who have been working 60 hours for 32k a year might be too jaded to really see that before they experience the benefit for themselves."
KitchenConfidential,3bol0g,yeroldfatdad,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:07:07 2015 UTC,"If I made $32000 or less I might be for this but I make more. Yes I work 70 hours a week in the Summer but in the winter I only work 50 or so hours. My salary is satisfactory to me at this time. If this law passes I stand to loose money, overall. And, no, I don't think you are being a prick."
KitchenConfidential,3bol0g,cubby13579,2,Wed Jul 1 16:13:07 2015 UTC,"I see that scenario, but let's figure it out... Let's say you make 50k because it's an easy number.  25k/(70 hours * 26 weeks) = $13.70/hour  25k/(50 hours * 26 weeks) = $19.20/hour  So let's say they pull you back to 40 hours at $15/hour (is that reasonable?).. now you make 15 * 40 * 52 = $31,200, so you've taken quite a pay cut.  BUT, the restaurant was using you for 3120 hours a year, and now they only have you for 2080.  They're going to need to pay you your overtime, or hire someone else part-time, or both!  So If you want to keep your schedule, you can pick up hours at another restaurant (And they'll be hiring because they're in the same boat), or negotiate your position at your current restaurant with the argument that you at 1.5x is a better deal than training a newbie and you can keep your old hours for more pay.  I can understand if you don't want to start at a new restaurant to cover hours, and maybe there will be a contingent of people who really loved working 60 hours at their restaurant, but now the restaurant can't afford to do that.  Maybe in those cases, an under the table arrangement could be made.  But the overall trend is going to be a hiring boom and more protection for people in the kitchen.  Seems like a good move to me."

KitchenConfidential,3bol0g,MylesMDT,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:17:27 2015 UTC,"From the article:   Employers can now often get around the rules: Any salaried employee who's paid more than $455 a week - or $23,660 a year - can be called a ""manager,"" given limited supervisory duties and made ineligible for overtime.   The problem here is that they were already getting around the rules.  Legally, per the DOL, an employee is not a ""manager"" unless they have the ability to hire and fire.  Most salaried BOH don't fall under this anyway.  They were already entitled to overtime.  But they are still getting screwed.  I don't expect the new legislation to change anything for anyone at the ""already screwed"" level.  There are many reasons that I remain an hourly employee, by choice, guile, and tough negotiation.  I hire and fire, but I'll be damned if my paycheck has a limit when we are busy.  When it's slow, it's a good deal for everybody.  When it's busy, it's still a good deal for everybody."

You can buy most at a restaurant supply store.  Stay away from items in pretty colors or  endorsed by food network celebrity ""chefs"" those are not good quality and are meant for housewife ""cooking"".   Nonstick pans shouldn't come larger than 6-8 inches and should be used for eggs only (you can't sear in non stick)  And a big box of professional plastic wrap.  All of the plastic wrap you can buy at the grocery store SUCKS! 1 box of restaurant quality plastic wrap is $20ish and will last a home cook MONTHS.   Parchment paper since you have to do you're own dishes.    Gas burners are 10x better than any electric burner you can buy and natural gas is cheaper than electricity.     Extra fridge/freezer space is important if you have a family.  I never have room to cool sauces and stocks with the kids juice boxes and lunch ables in the way.  Butter, heavy cream and kosher salt.  I can't believe it's not butter? I sure as hell can.   Your sauces will come out so much nicer and margarine is worse for you than butter.  Spice grinder (cheap dedicated coffee grinder). Buy your spices whole and toast and grind as needed.   You'll be amazed at the flavor difference for something that takes maybe 30 seconds to a minute.    Shallots fresh garlic and fresh herbs.

Also, he wasn't particularly observant, and had a high-fade cut and a goatee.  However, seeing his name on a training sheet one day, I asked him ""Your last name is Singh? You got family outta Punjab?"" to which he responded, ""Yeah, you got a problem with that?""  ""No! I had heard your name before, but I just figured it was spelled different.

As for gm's, last place I worked ours was always there, usually opening, occasionally closing. There were three managers total so the open/close changed amongst them.

KitchenConfidential,3bocp2,MrBrink10,2,Wed Jul 1 04:25:35 2015 UTC,My place GM does a mid shift (12-10 usually) when there's the most action.

Rarely is there a scenario when the GM of the restaurant has to be the first one in or the last one out.
KitchenConfidential,3bocp2,qvindtar,2,Wed Jul 1 14:37:30 2015 UTC,"That's pretty much what our GM is implying, he doesn't want to close and doesn't seem to make it in time to open.  The problem is, how many managers is appropriate? With 3 FT managers that gives you 15 shifts per week, the GM has to cover some of the open shifts, at a minimum, or else we would need another FT manage which is just over-kill in my opinion."
KitchenConfidential,3bocp2,qvindtar,3,Wed Jul 1 14:55:52 2015 UTC,"We're a smallish restaurant so we don't have a huge employee pool, which means we also don't have a ton of managers. (Chef, sous, and a KM in back, GM, AM and PM Bar/FOH managers out front).   What works for us is sous opens 5 out of 6 days a week, KM opens the sixth (he's hourly). GM and Chef work mid shifts, FOH managers shut it down at night. Kitchen closes are supervised by the lead line cook (also hourly). FOH manager is usually the last one around to count the drawers so they're usually the ones to lock the door.  The reason this works for us is there's a system for everything, and a checklist for the system. The chef doesn't have to stick around to make sure all the boxes get marked off the checklist - we delegate it to someone who wants a promotion in the future and hold them accountable the next day if it doesn't get done."
KitchenConfidential,3bocp2,MylesMDT,3,Wed Jul 1 15:50:18 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the detailed info. It sounds like the FOH managers are the ones responsible for closing mostly.

Occasionally the Chef or Sous will unlock the doors but they don't get involved with anything for FOH."

KitchenConfidential,3bndam,milo_alexander,18,Tue Jun 30 16:40:11 2015 UTC,"Prep is straight forward. Just soak the bones in lightly salted water for a day, change the water, and repeat a few times. After that they're ready to cook.  Shelf life is at least a week. Ticket time is under 5 minutes.  Recommended flavour paring is whatever douchebag trend people are jacking off to in your part of the world."

KitchenConfidential,3bndam,King_Chochacho,8,Wed Jul 1 16:36:57 2015 UTC,"I mean it's basically meat butter.  You typically see it with some toast or something to spread it on, probably some mustard, greens, pickles to cut through the richness a bit.  I haven't personally had to prep it, but I've been told to get the bones pre-cut, get a bandsaw, or forget it."
KitchenConfidential,3bndam,Saltycook,5,Tue Jun 30 16:59:37 2015 UTC,"""Meat butter"" is exactly the perfect phrase. Something that balances the fattiness, like set it on a grilled crustini, some sort  of acidic pairing, like tomato jam, and whatever else fits your fancy, like braised endive (assuming you're in the northern hemisphere something summery).

Definitely worth it as some of their systems are off the walls insane. Had one with a friggen' belt on it (doing dish there was the bomb) driving the dishes through the machine. A high volume place will definitely want a counter top machine. A low volume place that doesn't need a dedicated dishwasher can get a way with an under the counter one, but keep in mind that chemicals can get expensive and I know some suppliers don't even carry the right stuff for certain machines. I would suggest having Ecolabs come out to your kitchen and give you an estimate, then place that next to the cost estimate of the under counter. Along with the cost, also evaluate use: will the counter top machine prove to be more useful? Or will it not be worth the (insanely cheap price) of $200/month?"

KitchenConfidential,3bhtns,CaniBeSerious,3,Mon Jun 29 13:34:45 2015 UTC,"Mind of a Chef is available on PBS' website for free.  No Netflix required.  http://www.pbs.org/food/features/the-mind-of-a-chef-episode-descriptions/  Not sure what's up with the intro though...   Narrated by Executive Producer and renowned chef Anthony Bourdain   Not sure when Tony became a renowned chef.  ""Executive Producer, former Chef, and renowned food and travel author"" is probably more accurate."

I'm only going to do so much for free, y'know."
KitchenConfidential,3bhz8x,anon72c,5,Sat Jul 4 18:48:01 2015 UTC,"If you really want to start doing this, and getting into metal working in general, invest in a bench grinder,buffer, and rouge. Maybe even something that can hollow grind. Just be sure it's decent quality, and that you can use industry standard wheels and pads. A lot of the cheaper import stuff uses strange, janky sizes.  That being said, I have a slightly more generic flex shaft grinder, and it's much better than my dremel tools."
KitchenConfidential,3bhz8x,anon72c,2,Mon Jun 29 14:25:22 2015 UTC,"I currently do everything by hand with files and stones and sandpaper. I don't have the space to buy machines at the moment, unfortunately!"

KitchenConfidential,3bhz8x,anon72c,2,Mon Jun 29 21:22:23 2015 UTC,"Try searching for a flex shaft grinder. I used one to make some lamps, and have largely abandoned my dremel since. Everyone works differently though, safety through comfort and ease of use.  Angle grinders are pretty good with large, thick, industrial stuff, and I have some that could probably disappear an entire knife in a second. Whether that's throwing it across the room or grinding it away is a coin toss. You don't really need the power and coarse grit for this kind of work.  There are plenty of grinding and cutoff attachments for small drill-type tools, and they should do rather well if you don't have the room for more equipment. Just remember to keep the metal cool (no color change) and use hearing protection."
KitchenConfidential,3bhz8x,mediocrecore,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:54:13 2015 UTC,"I've worked with angle grinders. Honestly, the small ones are the most dangerous because idiots (not saying you are, just in general) forget it's dangerous. The big 9"" ones people are rightly fucking scared of.   That said, I'd totally use some sort of grinder in your shoes; I'd probably go with an angle grinder, but I'm almost as confident with a grinder as I am with a knife.   Even a smaller dremel attachment will do you a lot of good."
KitchenConfidential,3bhz8x,Yourwtfismyftw,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:19:41 2015 UTC,"Won't doing a knife edge on a bench grinder get it too hot and ruin the tempering?  I've seen some pretty slick models with a stone on one side and a belt on the other, but I've been too worried about the heat to pull the trigger on one.  All the water cooled ones I've seen  targeted at knife sharpening are just stupid expensive."
KitchenConfidential,3bhz8x,lackrays,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:53:22 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't sharpen an edge on a bench grinder, but would use it to shape the blade (broken tip) as opposed to the hacksaw and hone method. You still have to watch the color of the metal, and dip the piece in water occasionally to keep it cool.  Bench grinders and sharpeners are very different, even though they look similar. This turns at sever thousand RPM, and has fairly coarse (but interchangeable) wheels to shape and remove bulk material. The combo styles follow the same idea. Some people use incredibly fine grits to sharpen blades with these tools, but the learning curve can be steep. Especially if it's not your knife.  This sharpener turns at very fine wheel and leather strop at maybe 100RPM with indexable holders to grind an accurate, repeatable angle. It also bathes the grinding wheel in water to cool and lubricate the blade. Sometimes you can find them used.  Any method still benefits from hand sharpening as a final step, and it's a valuable skill to practice. But, when a severely damaged blade needs a lot of work, power tools can quickly pay for themselves in time saved."

KitchenConfidential,3bgy6c,Scabrous403,10,Mon Jun 29 08:38:24 2015 UTC,"Tips for being a good expo.  - come up with new riffs of each dish every time you call it. Some examples include turning Jarret d'agneau into ""Garret and gnocci' so it sounds similar to when you call out a 'carrot gnocchi'. Which is also on the menu.  -a server will ring in a table by seat number, say 1 lamb, 1 duck, 1 lamb, 2 bass, another lamb. Etc. when calling these bills make sure you don't group up the items. Cooks love knowing who is eating what. Call the bill just as it's printed. Making sure to call out the temperature right after each piece of meat.   -when servers ring in tables, wait a bit before calling the bills, it's best if you can call three or four tables at once, so that instead of it being a steady stream it feels like tsunami after tsunami pounds the kitchen. Followed by droughts of cleaning and smoking.   most importantly you never want to stop talking. You want to sound like an auctioneer."

KitchenConfidential,3bftnt,Hongxiquan,6,Mon Jun 29 14:27:01 2015 UTC,"Yes, but it's not their fault.   The inexperienced cooks will take their tiny offset spatulas to clean the grill. And then lose/destroy them. Their tablespoons and cup measures also disappear. This is why they have locked toolboxes. Line cooks will demand their knives be respected but tend to have a serious blind spot about pastry utensils, also they will take the shiny sheet pans and burn stuff onto them because 'I needed one.'  Everyone loves cookies/croissants/pastries and hungry vultures circle incessantly. They have to fend off the FOH and also their supposed brothers-in-arms the BOH. Constant vigilance!  Baker's thoughts: Ah, finally my planned-to-the minute shift is almost over, I have all the correct amount of product, I successfully accounted for oven use scheduling, humidity, and cooling space. That was a long process and a hard road to success!  Cook thoughts: OMG free cookies!! Om-nom-nom!!!  f you had upwards of 15 people constantly haranguing you for cookies that you specifically made ONLY and EXACTLY the right number for the event, if nobody else understood how there's really not leftovers because you scaled your recipe just so, if your repeated and nicely-phrased pleas for non-interference were ignored... Then you might also start labeling your cookies like this.  It can be really frustrating."

KitchenConfidential,3bdwf3,Oneusee,1 point,Mon Jun 29 07:18:26 2015 UTC,Yeah seems like too small of a staff to really need a sous

KitchenConfidential,3bdwf3,Oneusee,24,Tue Jun 30 08:00:36 2015 UTC,"Honestly, what kind of a kitchen needs their chef to baby them? A sous' main responsibility is to take leading position when the head chef's not around. Also, you did the right thing, and they are all to selfish to sympathize."
KitchenConfidential,3bdwf3,lupowei,7,Sun Jun 28 13:36:01 2015 UTC,A kitchen full of new hires and a fry cook of two months on the job.
KitchenConfidential,3bdwf3,Bobshayd,2,Sun Jun 28 15:04:14 2015 UTC,"I worked in one, and the chef wasn't babying anyone.  Skeleton crew, all people who were INCREDIBLY talented, hardworking, and fast.  It was just an unbelievable amount of work for the amount of people working there. There were a few very qualified candidates for the sous chef position there that would turn down the job due to the workload - it was too much for them for the pay, even at $75-85k/yr.  The chef worked even more than the sous.  It happens."
KitchenConfidential,3bdwf3,MentalOverload,3,Sun Jun 28 15:53:38 2015 UTC,Why would a kitchen that can pay a sous 85k a year not just properly staff? Was it a tiny space or something?
KitchenConfidential,3bdwf3,Marquis_Del_Taco,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:27:36 2015 UTC,"Originally, everyone in the kitchen was compensated very well for the work that they did.  It wasn't always crazy like that.  The members (country club) kept asking for more and more, and the chef would not only give it to them, but he would push the envelope even further.  It evolved into what it is now - plus, the budget for labor in nearly every section of the club aside from the kitchen had major increases.  So while other areas were given what they needed to be able to handle the influx of members and increase in events, the budget for the kitchen remained fairly stagnant and they really had to fight tooth and nail for any increases.    As a result, the kitchen was spread super thin, and it kept nearing a point where it wouldn't be able to produce what was being asked.  I can't tell you how many people I saw not last very long because they couldn't handle the work load.  The funny thing is I've had to really convince chefs before to hire me in the past because of how long I spent there, and a lot of chefs think of clubs as a place to go when you're done working hard and want an easier job with decent pay.  That's the case in some places, but certainly not there - it was probably the most demanding job I've ever worked.  Anyway, I know it sounds super twisted and backward to want so much without compensating for it, but that's how it was.  They're paying dearly for it now, though, as shit really hit the fan there.  The sous is the only one that seems to be able to handle it.  The new chef sounds like he's having a hell of a time, and the pantry guy of nearly 20 years just gave his notice.  They even fired a dishwasher/prep cook only to hire him back a few days later.  It's nuts."

KitchenConfidential,3bdwf3,Oneusee,5,Sun Jun 28 14:22:58 2015 UTC,"I walked out on a saturday night, mum had been in surgery because of internal bleeding. Ambulance was there quickly, I was kept updated - okay, I'll work. But 3 hours past when the surgery was meant to be finished, I couldn't take it and got kicked out of the kitchen by the chef.   Family comes first. As somebody put it, we make pre-shit; in 24 hours, it'll all just be sewerage. It's not life or death.   If our head chef had to go because his SO was in the hospital, we'd understand. And get raped on the line, but family always comes first. If your ""team"" can't understand that, your team is pretty damn shitty. I don't care how skilled they are; even if they'd aced the night, nobody has the right to hold a grudge in this instance."

I left before he even got there.  Shit went sour.  So they had 3 newbies and a 2 month rookie running the show.  I showed back up in the middle of the rush and saved the sinking ship.    I was still called a piece of shit for both leaving them fucked and leaving my fiance in the hospital alone.  What the fuck?  I'm an asshole both ways.  Guess I should have waited til 11 (9 hours after he was rushed to Hamot) to go see him, so I could keep the kitchen afloat, and then not be a piece of shit for leaving him alone in the hospital overnight while he slept."

You made the right choice. Never question that again.

KitchenConfidential,3bdwf3,J_Cant_Box,4,Sun Jun 28 17:49:52 2015 UTC,"Okay, here's an argument for not having families work together.  :D  My old boss at a small yet intensely busy cafe liked hiring family members and friends.  I don't really know why, but out of the 25 or so employees we had, there were a couple husband/wife teams, one father/son team, and I won with both a husband and son.  My husband and I both waited tables and my son was a chef.  So cue busy Sunday morning, line out the door, sections coming on rapidly.  I was feeling okay, but had to go to bathroom.  I was trying to hurry and straining a bit, when all of a sudden I felt like something had gone horribly wrong.  (Found out later that I had a twisted bowel.)  I got up and was in so much pain I was hanging onto the sink.  One of the other waitresses came in bathroom and asked if I was okay - she said my face was gray with pain.  I said no.   I couldn't walk, I was carried to the last closed section and laid on the ground.  911 was called.    I started instinctively rolling back and forth on the ground, after about 15 minutes I felt something loosen up.  The paramedics got there about then, loaded me onto a gurney and rolled me out past a long, long line of waiting customers.  Okay then.  We only had 5 servers, and one of them was my husband.  We only had 2 cooks, and one of them was my son.  My husband insisted on going with me, but my son stayed behind to cook.  Boss didn't want either of them to go, but husband said he would quit on the spot if she didn't.  We were two of the best food servers, so she sucked it up and put on an apron herself.  I recovered quickly once I got to the hospital, but it was 3 hours before they let us go, and we didn't go back to restaurant.  Son said that day was shitstorm of major proportions but everyone sucked it up.  One of the strangest things that happened was that my greatest enemy on waitstaff overheard people making jokes about me and complaining about having to wait longer for their food as the paramedics wheeled me out.  She lost her shit, told them they had no humanity and didn't deserve breakfast, and kicked them out of the restaurant.  We were never best friends after that, but the tensions lightened up considerably between us."

KitchenConfidential,3bdwf3,lupowei,3,Sun Jun 28 15:48:25 2015 UTC,It is simple: it is always family first. Sometime you can have friends that are the same as family. Some rare times you can have co-workers who become friends and even the same as family. But still family first.  How is your fiance? If he is still in the hospital he needs an advocate there. My wife has been hospitalized several times and I've learned it really helps to have another person there for the patient.
KitchenConfidential,3bdwf3,olov244,7,Sun Jun 28 18:49:03 2015 UTC,"I kind of hope this is a troll post. There is a 0% chance I would have come back that day, and maybe even that week. If I did get back and caught shit for leaving, I would have turned that restaurant into a mother fucking Thunderdome, no one walks out alive except me.   Seriously, if they can't see that you didn't ""schedule"" your fiances' heart attack, that maybe the GM should get their stank ass over from the graduation to help out or if your crew is butt hurt because you left......

KitchenConfidential,3bdwf3,BlackMantecore,2,Mon Jun 29 05:26:18 2015 UTC,A Sous Chef that freaks out when things don't go according to plan in the kitchen is NOT a good Sous Chef.  He/she doesn't even deserve the rank bestowed to him.    Sous Chefs are supposed to be problem solvers.  He's the person the Exec. Chef relies upon to take charge of the kitchen when he's not around.    Sous Chefs are also expected to take over the line when there is a lack of manpower.

Is there a lot of sexism in most kitchens? Aside from myself, all 29 people that work in the kitchen where I am are either teenagers (of both genders) or women. So there's not really any of that. Are a lot of kitchens primarily male?"
KitchenConfidential,3bdzm4,Thisaintscary,3,Sun Jun 28 16:25:02 2015 UTC,It depends on the kitchen. I work in a kitchen similar to yours but in the past I've work in very male dominated kitchens. In my experience I would say that the less corporate and older the restaurant the more likely its the stereotypical testosterone fest. I've also worked in female dominant kitchens which are much less common and have a very different dynamic.  The misogynistic jokes and harassment and such aren't limited to the type of kitchen in my experience. I've been in majority male kitchens that don't tolerate it and corporate chains that I've left out of disgust. It's mostly management and who they choose to keep around and what they let slide.
KitchenConfidential,3bdzm4,Werthquake,5,Sun Jun 28 17:46:10 2015 UTC,"Yes, there is a lot of sexism.  Every kitchen that I have been in has had it in varying degrees, from the down right sexual assault to simple harmless jokes.  You learn to roll with the punches and the good kitchens will not tolerate men harassing the women.    I don't mind guys making light-hearted jokes about females or the jokes about me messing up because I am a dumb blonde.  I do mind when they try to tickle me or worse. Touching, for me, is crossing the line. You do have to have a thick skin to work in most kitchens but that goes for both genders."
KitchenConfidential,3bdzm4,yogurt21,3,Sun Jun 28 17:48:02 2015 UTC,"Yikes. If someone's touching me to move me out of the way that's fine but I can't imagine someone touching me to be ""playful"" or anything. That'd freak me out."

KitchenConfidential,3behtf,nicodemia,19,Sun Jun 28 14:03:07 2015 UTC,"Like /u/JaFFsTer says, this really depends on your quantities.  But, as a word of advice, here's my workplan/flow:   Get to work ~15 minutes early to get a view of how things will go for the day, count stock, etc. Intel gathering, basically.  Prepare a list based on my counts. I put a star next to anything that needs to be done right away (priorities) and I put an ""O"" beside stuff that is optional (or can be done later). This is important because you need to know what your next move is without having to think about it. Cuts -> Cooks -> Portions. Every time. I get all of my cuts done first, then I get all of my cooking done, then I portion everything (once cooled of course).  Exceptions:    Priorities always go first. No shit.  Stuff that takes time to cook should go on ASAP (duh). Ex. Potatoes for mashing, roasting, steaming, etc. should be done right away (and usually have minimal set up). Cook while you cut, cut while you cook.     Things to consider:   Start clean, stay clean. I can't emphasize this enough. Cleaning as you go = saved time = more stuff done = you can go home on time.  The less time you spend away from your station, the more work you'll get done. Don't waste time bringing individual items back and forth. Grab a big bin and grab all of the equipment you need to get your day done at the beginning of the day (and throughout when appropriate). When you have dirty dishes / equipment, pile them up neatly.  If you are working with sauces, you'd better be able to scrape every last drop. This cuts back on cleaning, decreases waste, and helps you hit your yields.  Stay focused. It's always good to stay lighthearted and cheerful and joke around with the rest of the goons, but remember: work and talk.  Set time goals. Work at a pace that you feel is ""you trying hard"", but not so fast that you are rushing. Be aware of how long it takes you to achieve a task each day. Then, aim to shorten that time by 5 minutes. Do this every day and you'll find yourself faster and faster every day. Big jumps in ability are rare - little steps is the way to go.  Speed comes with time. If you've done everything as above, you're already on your way to efficiency. At the very least, you will have less wasted time and more productivity. Don't worry about being fast - just make sure your shit is accurate."

Speed is something you develop over time and how accustomed you are to your project. You won't pick it up right away, God knows that I didn't. But keep at it and don't get discouraged. As you go along you can estimate about how long each task will take and which tasks you can merge with one another.   Someone else also said this but cook while you cut and cut while you cook. Get a timer and time whatever it is you're cooking while you cut.   Keep your work stations clean and mise (if applicable) when necessary.   More importantly, keep at it. Don't get discouraged and always know that you'll always fuck up, just like the rest of us, but what sets us apart is that we learn from our mistakes and move on."

I've outlived so many dish-hands and the main reason they get fired in my place is because they were slow when doing dishes, One guy we employed only because he was a friend of the owner.. he was slow at the start (thought he would improve) and he never sped up even when the head chef gave him a few talks about it.  Head chef eventually cracked the shits and fired him saying that even though he was a friend of the owner if did not mean he could slack the hell off during his dishie shift (He was keeping the chefs back a full 2 hours after they finished to help him finish all his dishes.)  The only other dishes we have had that failed were some guys who could not understand much english, One could do the job but only had his brother to translate if he got texted to come in early/come in and when he did a job he was generally confused unless you gave him visual instructions.    My advice?   -do it right or do it twice, -Always remember to say behind -Pay attention to what's going on in the kitchen, If there's a job you can do when there's no dishes or it's really slow just do it, Chefs love that shit from dishies/kitchenhand"

The thing is, most of the places I've worked this happens: wiped out from the night before-->frantic set-up-->mise into beginning of service-->bad service-->drink-->go home-->repeat step one. If all parties aren't triaging any disasters you had that night, talking about it, what went well, what didn't, who fucked up, then you aren't learning from it.   Do you serve a worthy product when you're in ""real fucking deep shit"" (now known as RFDS)? If you can confidently say that you served food that is as good as what you would normally serve your grandmother on a slow Tuesday, then enjoy immortality. Relishing or celebrating being in the RFDS is some stupid pirate shit. Rant fin."

Questions about menus a month from this moment. And do it all with a smile on your face, when all you want to do is slice their throats open and watch the blood spill over the floor.   Shit, sorry.

But seriously, being able to shift into that fourth gear and single-handedly save a rush just by working your fucking balls off feels incredible. Today was an example of that for me. Our prep guy called out, so our opener and mid had to pick up some of the prep slack during the day. They only got about half of it done between the two of them because they had a higher-than-average volume lunch. The shit I had left to do normally takes our prep guy around 2 and a half hours to do, and I had about an hour to do it before dinner started, and to cap it all off our EC is on vacation this week so I've been working fry AND cold side at the same time all week.  And our dinner rush went off without a hitch. Nothing was sent back, all the guests were happy, and I felt like a total fucking badass for essentially working three jobs at once all night. Fourth motherfucking gear.  Like I said, that Bud bottle tasted like heaven."

KitchenConfidential,3bdhgj,bluechef79,2,Sun Jun 28 05:31:24 2015 UTC,"I don't make work a penalty. Cleaning should be done out of pride, not punishment. Have a clear set of rules and standard operating procedures outlined for each position. Go over each of them. Then have a clear discipline system and explain how it will work. There's a reason corporate places adopt it. It's effective and covers your bases. For example, first offense is a verbal. Then you sit them down and develop a strategy one on one to prevent repeated behavior. Next offense is written with the notice that the next time will result in termination. Then you just execute it, cold and professional. Just serve them the paperwork. Don't argue or make it personal. It's way more intimidating when you never lose control. You just reward the good guys and slowly and surely move the garbage out the door."

The crust though reminded us of a corn tortilla flavor profile.  I now wonder how it was better on night two.  My two cents... Food was really good, but more lighting next time.  Doesn't need to be dark. You had such lovely China and presented  dishes, that in the end, the lighting would have been to your advantage.    When doing table side soup... Soup should always pour on the side of the bowl, and allows the bowl to fill up.  The presentation was ruined because he just pour straight over everything (that's why no picture was taken).  But, that was probably the 2nd best dish of the evening for me. Really delicious and vibrant."

There were also some proofing and timing issues, we could only use one oven and they were prepping in it as well. Definitely had more time to pay attention to the bread on day two. The difference was noticeable. Your comparison to tortillas was spot on, we used a bit of maseca corn flour in the sour dough.  It looks like you were a part of the second seating? Either way thanks for the lighting suggestion. Definitely one of those little things that one never fully accounts for until the doors open and you're flying around. The same with emphasizing points of service like pouring the soup on the side of the bowl and not on the garnish. The first service me and Chris poured all the soup, but it took too long. So the second service I portioned as our front of house poured. Definitely my fault for not emphasizing how to pour for them.   By the way, your pictures came out amazing!"

KitchenConfidential,3b76qn,halifaxdatageek,11,Fri Jun 26 19:24:38 2015 UTC,"Kind of like how on the East Coast, lobster is so plentiful and cheap that McDonald's sells it.   The deal with lobster (at least, with the kind of lobster caught from eastern Canada to Cape Cod, which is what most people mean by ""lobster""), is that they spoil rapidly after death so they have to be shipped and handled alive, and they don't freeze great. They also routinely shed their shells and grow new ones, and the hardness of the shell has a huge effect on ship-ability.    So the best lobsters for eating, with the sweetest meat, are new-shell or soft-shell lobsters, with flimsy shells that you can basically peel with your fingers. These are also typically the cheapest, but you can only get them close to where they were caught, because they can't realistically be shipped more than a day's drive or so. Southeastern New England, or occasionally NYC, is about as far from Maine as you can get these lobsters, which are the best eating. They also happen to be the cheapest, because they can only be sold locally, although they have the least amount of meat per pound. These are why you can get a better lobster dinner in Maine for $15 than you can get in LA for $150.  Old-shell lobsters, with thick, leathery shells, are the toughest and least tasty, with the most meat per pound. If you're eating a chain-restaurant lobster-roll in the midwest, or some kind of frozen or prepared-food lobster dish, you're usually eating old-shell lobster. It's not as cheap per pound as the soft/new-shell lobster, but it ships well and produces more meat per pound.  In between is so-called ""hard shell"" lobster, which is typically the most expensive. This is the best-tasting lobster that can be realistically shipped to LA or Vegas or Paris or whatever. These lobsters have a medium amount of meat per pound, a hard, brittle shell that is difficult to open without crackers, a flavor close to that of soft/new shell lobsters, and are sturdy enough to survive a quick air-freight trip to just about anywhere. This is the ""prime beef"" of the global lobster market. It's not as good as new/soft lobsters, but top-flight restaurants worldwide would much rather serve it than the tougher ""old shell"" lobsters, making it the most in-demand worldwide."
KitchenConfidential,3b76qn,PendingErection,2,Fri Jun 26 23:46:23 2015 UTC,"Great comment! Thanks.  This explains a lot of things:  - why there are so many people in my neighbourhood selling lobster out of the back of their trucks for $5/pound  - why Vegas lobster has always looked odd to me  - why I've never seen a pair of lobster crackers in my life, or understood their purpose, haha.  I often wonder what someone must think when they see someone in a beat-up pickup truck on the side of the highway with a handmade sign saying FRESH-CAUGHT TODAY LOBSTER - $5/LB. But hey, those guys make bank."

KitchenConfidential,3b93oe,Sniffygull,7,Fri Jun 26 23:46:57 2015 UTC,"I've worked as a baker and line cook, though i'm primarily a baker, so take my advice with a grain of salt and understand my bias:  I assume you mean ""bread"" baker?  a few distinct differences: first off, the energy in a bakery is usually a little different.  it's not as testosterone charged, there's not the same sort of line cook swearing, lingo, and general ball busting.  bakers are like anyone else in the industry who like to laugh, give each other shit and have a good time at work, but it's a lot more good natured and doesn't have the same snap and bite as a busy kitchen.  it's hard to explain, but you'll notice it if you pay attention.  secondly: cooking is done in pinches and dashes, baking is done in grams and 1/4 tsp's.  bread can be very intuative, judging the entire process from start to finish by how it looks, tastes, sounds, smells and feels is possible and a lot of bakers do it this way.  the latest trend has been towards a more precise and scientific approach- timers and thermometers for the entire process.  the industry has jumped in leaps and bounds because of this, and has managed to keep it's soul.  don't look at it as an, ""either/or"" choice, look at is as a ""both/and"" situation.  how does the dough sound after 5 minutes in the mixer?  how does it feel when it hits 76-78 degrees?    you'll still be multi-tasking like a machine, but it's not because you're working 4 tickets and listening to how often your new dishy is firing off loads of dishes, instead you're shaping baguettes out of the preshapes while your ciabatta finishes its bulk ferment.  you've got your pain rustique in the oven and it needs to come out in 12 minutes, which means you've got to get your baguettes done in time so you can pull your loaves from the oven and then get your ciabatta on the bench before it over proofs and deflates when you portion it.  it's a fuckin hustle, and it can start at 2 or 3 in the morning.    oh yeah, you're schedule may get flipped.  completely.  you may be calling to chat with your line cook buddies who are on their way home as you are on your way to work.  (the plus side is by the time those animals drag their asses out of bed at 11am-noon, you'll be off work and can still hang out or grab a bite to eat together)    some of the best bakers I've worked with have been reformed line cooks.  join us, brother."
KitchenConfidential,3b93oe,DoctorTacoMD,2,Sat Jun 27 00:54:30 2015 UTC,"Weigh everything. Imo, baking is more like practical chemistry, so precise measurement is essential. 2. It tends to be more physically demanding than you might expect. 3. A diversified skill set increases your value as a cook. If I had a nickel for every great cook I've ever known who couldn't/wouldn't/was hesitant or reluctant/was scared of trying/failed once and never went back (etc.) to throw a simple dough, I'd open a Nickel's Breads©! 4. Listen and learn; you were hired from the neck down! Good luck!"
KitchenConfidential,3b93oe,ElChangoFumando,2,Sat Jun 27 00:18:53 2015 UTC,"I work as a baker at the moment. Used to work the line as a pastry cook. Two different animals but still running around making sure shits not burnt or over proofed.   Depending on your position, if you are baking full time or doing a split of mixing, shaping, and baking, you'll have to be really precise on timing and temp on everything. You'll need to know how hot your ovens are, I find baking around 500 degrees is the norm everywhere i've worked. When you need to pull dough to be baked and wherther it's retarded over night or proofed for a couple hours and how they should feel when scoring and loading. You need to temp your dough when it comes off the mixer. If its 75 or 78, those 2 degrees can throw off your timing by and hour to 30 mins. Thats mostly dependent on what temp your water is, and how hot or cold or how humid or not it is outside / in your bakery.  I've trained cooks that wanted to work in bakeries, looking to for a change of pace. I say don't change your pace, work as fast as you would on a line, because when the holidays or extended weekend comes for the rest of the world, you will be busting ass. Like /u/DoctorTacoMD said, you will be a multi-tasking machine."
KitchenConfidential,3b93oe,J_Cobb,1 point,Sat Jun 27 02:41:23 2015 UTC,Baking is much more repetitive. It helps if you are good at basic math and can bang out stuff consistently and fast. A lot of places you will only make 3 or 4 things. Thousands of times each. It's almost more of a sport than an art.

KitchenConfidential,3bagtt,bloodymonty,8,Sat Jun 27 11:56:50 2015 UTC,"It's embarrassing to think that plenty of young cooks have probably read this and decided it was an acceptable way to behave.   So very misguided. If you're too tired to get out of bed on your day off, or eat a meal that your SO has prepared for you, get a new job pronto. Why would you ever bother to criticize the knife skills of someone who doesn't do this for a living? I used to date an architect and somehow she refrained from shitting on my technical drawing skills."

She kept urging me to pursue a new job somewhere I would be much happier and possibly make more. Working together and spending so much time together outside of work was taking a toll on our relationship. Eventually a new place in town was going to open up, they offered me a position with the same pay/hours I was already working. At first I decide to work both. Then a few months in, the head chef decided to step down and take a new job and offered me his position. Now working 65+ hours a week getting off at midnight or later, my bank account is actually starting to grow, I'm happier at my job then I've ever been, I recently got a downtown apartment and everything's starting to look up. Everything but our relationship.

He doesn't resent me because I don't let him sleep, and I don't feel guilty about working late because he's waiting up for me at home.

After tonight though, I'm going to be much more aware of it and figure out how best to take care of it nightly, then make sure every new trainee is well aware of that process."

We talk shop a lot and we like going to kitchen supply places together on our days off. Gotta get new spoons or a new angled spat!

Most nights we're too tired to hang out with each other and usually just go to bed or watch Netflix. Every now and again though, when one of us has a day off and enough money to get some dope ingredients, we'll make kick ass dinner for the other. On our anniversary, we went to a moderately swanky place in town for oysters, cocktails, lamb tongue salad, steak tartare, and some other delightful things.   So it's going fairly well."

He's lost 50 pounds or so, it worked for him; I tried that 30 day cleanse/diet thing and absolutely hated it and didn't finish.  Anyway, now he's mostly just selling it. The Spark stuff is great. I still order a tub of powder from him every so often. But it probably won't help your weight lost much, it's basically Red Bull/Monster but ""healthier"" because it's got all the vitamins that other energy drinks don't, and also sugar free. No crash, taste good, easy to make however much you want for however long your rush is. They make 'Rehydrate' which is their version of Gatorade, and it's awful. So that's why I got actual Gatorade and mixed it with the Spark.   If you're asking about diets, eh. It's hit or miss for each person. I would definitely ask her about some of the options. They do work, but it's one of the harder diets I've done. It's basically just protein overload while drinking all their products."

KitchenConfidential,3b4m71,igotitforfree,4,Fri Jun 26 00:47:57 2015 UTC,"Do you guys really throw out eggs after 5 minutes out of the walk-in? That seems a bit excessive in my opinion. If an egg is contaminated with salmonella, it's going to make someone sick if they eat it undercooked even if it was ice cold when you started cooking it. If the egg is free of dangerous bacteria, it can hang out at room temp for a while. I've worked a few too many breakfast gigs in my day and we would have a pitcher of beaten eggs for scrambled and a flat of whole eggs for everything else. We'd keep it next to the griddle until it was gone, which was usually never more than an hour anyway. Never had an issue that I know of."

We don't actually throw them out if left out usually as our food costs would be too high, but we try to keep them in a fridge.  I don't know the full reason that we have to keep them cold, but that is the rule. Pasturized eggs can be left out for up to 2 hours at room tempature (but then have to be thrown out, not put back in the fridge)."
KitchenConfidential,3b4m71,igotitforfree,5,Fri Jun 26 02:02:56 2015 UTC,Eggs can be stored at room temp just fine (and are in Europe).. but because American farms wash the egg (rather than raising chickens in decent conditions where they don't have to shit all over each other constantly) the natural coating that protects the egg has been washed away and it has a higher chance of food borne illness.

It's hard to pick a favorite dish as most things were amazing but something that I still think about is the oyster and pearl dish. Believe every rave about it.

Per Se approach is def more ""classic"" approach but still  creative  and modern dishes, I mean as you can see They didn't serve us Beef bourguignon or ratatouille haha. Honestly I was hesitant about Per Se for the same reason maybe a bit too classic  and that's why EMP was on top of my list as well, but it's  a whole different game once you taste the food at Per Se. At the end of the day food has to taste good and make an impact on you whether classic or modern, unfortunately EMP didn't do that for me this time."
KitchenConfidential,3b0b5x,Formaldehyd3,4,Thu Jun 25 15:06:49 2015 UTC,"EMP was on top of my list as well. Food was awesome but not Amazing Like Per Se or Atera. EMP did drop one spot from last year so i don't know if that's evidence but like I said I would Definitely have no problem going back. Honestly, I Would absolutely make Per Se top priority. I was willing to compromised Per Se for EMP and I'm glad I didn't oh man am I glad. After we Left Per Se I turn to my wife and Said ""We're going to The French Laundry next year"" She said Yes without hesitation. Keller is a fucking Legend and I felt Like a little girl meeting Minnie Mouse for the first time when I met him lol.   Le bernardin was Meh, I consider myself a decent cook and I felt like I could easily replicate every single dish I had there. I can't never say that about the other restaurants. the only great dish was the octopus, everything else just very good. Def not on the same level. My original plan for seafood restaurant was the Chef's table at Brooklyn Fare but good luck getting a reservation there, I called  early morning continuously for 30 mins, by the time someone picked up all reservations gone.

When I used to do a lot of ice sculpting and fruit carving, most of the best guys were hotel/country club chefs.

Yes, sometimes there are people that make the same mistake over and over again, and any place that has FOH management worth their salt will take the steps to deal with those that are so easily flustered that they make multiple mistakes.   That being said, I've had to face down a person staring daggers at me because I've called four times for a side or a correction and taken that hit in my income because the BOH made a mistake and was swamped.

KitchenConfidential,3ay1ev,Willlll,5,Wed Jun 24 16:45:32 2015 UTC,"This is the big problem with American service. We don't have agreed upon standards. What one person considers good service is horrendous to another. To a certain extent it's the server's job to figure out what customers want, but that's asking an awful lot, especially when we want to be able to turn around and hire idiots. Only point: is problem.   All that said, IMO and all, it is really wrong to clear plates before everyone is finished. It can make the remaining diners feel rushed. Rule #1 for service (for sit downs, at least): don't make the diner feel rush. Absolutely do what you can do to get them moving, but don't make them feel that you are. I know it's generally foolish to have a dissenting opinion in this sub, but I feel like this is a reasonable complaint. Is it the ""most annoying?"" Probably not, but I don't like it one bit."

KitchenConfidential,3ay1ev,onioning,19,Wed Jun 24 14:13:42 2015 UTC,"No, the point is that people are staying at the tables longer because now that everyone has smartphones, people spend less time just eating and having conversation while they do so, then leaving when they finish the meal.  Now, people spend half the meal checking things on their phones (and as a result, take longer to eat), and when they finish eating, they'll play on their phones, which is usually when people would be paying their bill and leaving.  The whole idea behind the possibility that waiters might be trying to send a message to leave, is that if they take the first person's plate when they're done, the others might feel like they should hurry up, as opposed to just taking their time.    If the waiters don't clear plates too early, then people playing on smart phones just take more time to eat, but if they possibly feel like they should hurry up, they might vacate the table a little sooner, allowing a restaurant to flip the table quicker.      It's not about clearing plates because people are on their phones, it's about clearing plates early because people are spending longer amounts of time at the tables, and not spending an equivalent amount of addition money... because they're more often on their phones.  (that's kind of explained in that article, which I'm assuming you didn't read?)"

KitchenConfidential,3ay1ev,onioning,-3,Wed Jun 24 16:12:13 2015 UTC,Or you could look at it this way-  Multiple people were referencing a 'common knowledge/common experience' opinion. You respond as the lone dissenting voice.  You could provide a source for the information and prove all of us wrong.  Or you can get offended that we don't trust your opinion as a fact... just as you are not buying ours.  Edit to add: I just searched for solid information on cell phone usage in restaurants. Everything that comes up is an opinion piece. If you have a source that could prove all these people wrong I would honestly love to see it. I like telling the older servers who spend all day complaining about 'people these days' that they are wrong. Go serve your table instead of standing around back here bitching to me about it.  I found this one 'study' that is only one restaurants opinion. http://m.jsonline.com/news/blogs/267013841.html

B) ""common knowledge"" is not a source. It's a bad claim. Doesn't matter how many people believe it.   C) this is an interesting subject, and definitely worth further investigation. I'm not objecting to asking for a source. I'm objecting to asking for a source as a means of discounting an argument. I have provided just as much evidence as those making the original claim (that is, none). Conventionally in argument it is the responsibility of the person making a claim to defend it (hence burden of proof) and one rarely sets out to prove a negative (""cell phone usage has not increased average table time"")."
KitchenConfidential,3ay1ev,onioning,2,Wed Jun 24 16:54:05 2015 UTC,"There is a correlation. Cell phones are part of an entirely new mindset of the public. There is a disconnect between personal wants, and public impact. People are preoccupied with everything going on outside that particular moment and that particular place. Furthermore, with social media and reality TV, everyone feels entitled to celebrity treatment. I can't tell you how many soccer moms in workout clothes have berated one of my servers for not clearing a plate while they're texting on their phones, unaware that the rest of their table is still eating.    It all ties in together, and the above poster's observation was an astute and poignant one."
KitchenConfidential,3ay1ev,pefyeah,0,Wed Jun 24 17:37:43 2015 UTC,"People are taking less time to dine than they used to. IMO there are many good reasons to object to cell phone use in a restaurant, but arguing that it's increased the time spent dining is awfully tough. It's true that we can only see a correlation. As cell phone usage goes up, time spent dining has gone down.   I don't remotely mean to imply that cell phone usage has caused dining time to go down. That's a false correlation if ever there was one, like the whole pirates and cancer thing (as the number of pirates in the world goes down, the number of people getting cancer goes up, ergo pirates are the cure for cancer (not)). It may well be that the cell phone usage itself actually does increase time, and there are just a lot more other factors that are decreasing time more. That's perfectly reasonable. It remains that average dining time has gone down, so blaming cell phone usage is not a reasonable explanation for why one would clear plates early.  I think you have a very good general point, I just don't think it's relevant to this topic. I do think that cell phones are very tied up with the whole growing sense of entitlement in our culture, and that that entitlement is often expressed through cell phone usage (as well as diners angry when their plates aren't cleared immediately as they finish)."

It takes longer to look at menus and order food, and longer to finish meals. Because they have their cellphones to preoccupy them."

When I started my first fancy place just did that and wrapped it in my apron instead of shelling out money for a knife bag when I started.  I got a 8"" Wusthof Chef Knife as my first.  I see on here Victorinox suggested a lot as a cheap, but good, knife.    Also, for me, it was worth it to get a peeler and some cooking shears.  You could probably borrow them from someone and they wouldn't mind but they are pretty handy to have around.  I just keep mine at work by my station.  So all in all, if you can spare $35 for that cheap Victorinox I'd suggest that.  It is just much less of a pain to have your own than to bum a knife all the time."

KitchenConfidential,3awctf,noideawhatmynameis,37,Wed Jun 24 01:47:43 2015 UTC,"Shit, my bad, man... here ya go, the full article:  A federal judge on Tuesday issued a preliminary injunction blocking Sysco Corp.’s planned acquisition of US Foods Inc., a ruling that could kill a deal to combine the nation’s two largest food distributors.  The decision handed a high-profile victory to the Federal Trade Commission, which filed a lawsuit in February challenging the transaction on antitrust grounds. The win is the latest in a string of merger-enforcement matters in which antitrust officials appointed to the FTC and the Justice Department by President Barack Obama have flexed their muscles to block or pare back mergers they believed would harm competition.  The Sysco-US Foods deal, announced in December 2013, sought to combine the food distributors that lead the pack in providing ingredients and a range of other supplies to restaurants, hotels, schools and other food-service operations. The FTC argued the merger would leave customers large and small vulnerable to higher prices and reduced levels of service. The companies argued their tie-up would help them improve service and become more efficient, while cutting hundreds of millions of dollars in costs.  U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta in Washington said the FTC had shown that putting the brakes on the merger was in the public interest.  “The FTC has shown that there is a reasonable probability that the proposed merger will substantially impair competition in the national customer and local broadline markets and that the equities weigh in favor of injunctive relief,” the judge wrote in a two-page order.  Details of the judge’s ruling weren’t immediately available. The opinion was released under seal because it contains confidential business information. A redacted public version of the ruling will be released on Friday.  Shares of Sysco dropped 1.9% to $36.87 in after-hours trading.  The judge’s announcement left some restaurants and other food service businesses breathing a sigh of relief.  “This is great news. There was some serious panic in the industry,” said the director of purchasing for a national Mexican restaurant chain. The Texas-based chain had switched to US Foods from Sysco several years ago because of Sysco’s pricing. If the merger had gone through, the director said he would have been left using a patchwork of different distributors and would have had to hire more people to reallocate the restaurant chain’s food purchasing. “It would have been brutal,” he said.  Others wished the companies would have prevailed. “It would have made the little guys step up their game, just like US Foods did,” said Phil Pace, the owner of San-Diego chain Phil’s BBQ. He added that he believed a merged company would have more buying power and been able to offer lower prices.  Judge Mehta, appointed to the bench by President Obama last year, held nearly two weeks of legal proceedings on the merger in May, which included testimony from top company executives and customers served by Sysco and US Foods. The proceedings didn’t appear a slam dunk for either side. During closing arguments, the judge asked tough questions of both the companies and the FTC.  The FTC had asked the judge to block the merger preliminarily while it holds a full trial on the deal in its own in-house administrative court, beginning in July. The companies, however, said Judge Mehta’s ruling would be crucial to whether the merger survived.  Sysco Chief Executive Bill DeLaney in a written statement said the company was “profoundly disappointed” in the outcome, but he didn’t lay out the company’s next steps.  “We will take a few days to closely review the court’s ruling and assess our legal and contractual obligations, including the merits of terminating the merger agreement,” Mr. DeLaney said.  Sysco has a lot to lose financially if the deal dies. It would have to pay US Foods $300 million and had already invested $355 million in integration planning, hiring top antitrust lawyers and other related costs, as of the end of March.  The decision also puts pressure on Sysco to come up with another way to improve its lagging profitability and fend off rising competition that is threatening Sysco’s traditional business model. More restaurant chains and other customers want to negotiate prices directly with manufacturers, have access to new technology that helps them run their kitchens more efficiently, and they are turning to alternatives like Costco Wholesale Corp., eating away at Sysco’s earnings.  In the nine months ended March 28, its operating profit fell to 3% from 3.4% the prior-year period.  A US Foods executive said during court proceedings that the company would walk away from the deal if Judge Mehta ruled for the FTC.  US Foods Chief Executive John Lederer, in a statement, said, “We are ready for whatever comes next. We have the talent, passion and financial foundation to take this company to the next level for our customers and for our employees.”  Debbie Feinstein, director of the FTC’s bureau of competition, said the ruling “will preserve competition in both local and national broadline foodservice distribution markets. We look forward to proving at trial that this deal would lead to higher prices and diminished service for customers.”  Tuesday’s ruling also was a blow to the industry’s third-largest company, Performance Food Group Inc., which stood to expand its business significantly by picking up 11 distribution centers that would have been divested from the merging companies. Those operations generated $4.6 billion in annual revenue.  Sysco and US Foods agreed to sell the assets to PFG in a bid to address the FTC’s antitrust concerns. The companies and the government, however, disagreed over whether PFG would be able to replace the competition provided previously by US Foods.  PFG declined to comment on the ruling.  The case was the FTC’s most notable merger challenge in eight years, since the agency sued to prevent Whole Foods Market Inc. from acquiring a competitor. After a series of up-and-down court proceedings, the two sides eventually settled that case.  Tuesday’s ruling is a win for Democratic appointees at the FTC. The lawsuit had split the commission 3-2 along partisan lines, with Democrats in the majority.  Antitrust officials at the FTC and the Justice Department continue to ride a wave of enforcement victories both in and out of the courtroom. The Justice Department has been more active, stopping several transactions in recent years, either through court victories or because merging parties abandoned their deal in the face of government opposition. In April Comcast Corp. walked away from its planned acquisition of Time Warner Cable Inc.  Other deals that have fallen at the hands of the department include AT&T Inc.’s 2011 deal for T-Mobile USA and Applied Materials Inc.’s 2013 deal to acquire Tokyo Electron Ltd.  The FTC has kept a somewhat lower profile on merger cases, but it has won a series of court rulings stopping hospital mergers the agency found anticompetitive."

Because PFG was going to pick up a bunch of distribution centers for cheap, and because many restaurants with US Foods contracts would have to renegotiate and possibly get new food reps, it would allow him and other PFG reps to possibly switch them over.   As much as I hate monopolies, this could have been a boon to Sysco's biggest competitor."

I personally still use the pairing knives I got from the Silverpoint series, and my 8"" cooks knife is still in my roll for utility work that I wouldn't want to use my Mac or Misono for.   Cheap, durable, easy to keep an edge on. Try one out if you can.   If you must have forged steel, look at the Chicago Cutlery Fusion Forged or the Made in China JA Henckles Forged set.

I find mercer makes the best starter/ beginners set there is. Yeah it might get beaten up a little going through meat fabrication but overall I feel that it's worth it. In the end you have to pick knives that feel great in your hand. I now strictly use shuns and miyabi because I found that the handles fit my hand better.

KitchenConfidential,3ay5lr,qualcosawitty,10,Wed Jun 24 13:11:55 2015 UTC,This is what I always thought.   Apparently it isn't true though. http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2008/10/29/2404364.htm  If you cook them enough they should be fine and any ones that are infected should be obviously smelly open or closed.  Obviously you don't want to mess around with food safety but apparently this one is a myth. Apparently it is the mussels that are already opened (i.e. They are already dead) before cooking you want to discard.
KitchenConfidential,3ay5lr,CupBeEmpty,8,Wed Jun 24 15:35:03 2015 UTC,"Yes, exactly this. A quick explanation for those who don't read the article and still want to know the ""why"":  Mussels are being kept close by a muscle. When the mussel is cooked, sometimes this muscle is still well attached to both sides of the shell and not elastic, which keeps it closed. This can be resolved by cooking it longer, but then you'd be over-cooking. So alternatively, just force it to open.  In dead mussels, the closing muscle will deteriorate over time (this will be sped-up by cooking) so the mussels isn't able to hold it's shells closed. So the mussels you do want to discard are the ones that won't close before cooking. If you tap on a mussel before cooking, or put any kind of stress on them, the mussel should close to protect itself. If it doesn't, it means it's dead or at least not in good health, and should therefore be discarded."

KitchenConfidential,3ay5lr,drays,6,Wed Jun 24 17:56:02 2015 UTC,"I was taught to give them a shake, and any that didn't close under their own power should be tossed...   An actual spoiled mussel is foul beyond imagining, I doubt you could accidentally cook one, but the ones that are slow to or refuse to close have been dead long enough for the quality to drop anyway, and better safe than sorry."
KitchenConfidential,3ay5lr,CupBeEmpty,3,Thu Jun 25 13:04:23 2015 UTC,That is a myth. The ones that are dead before being cooked are the ones that remain open before cooking. They are dead so they can no longer hold their shell closed.  Ones that don't open just had a strong muscle that stayed shut.  http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2008/10/29/2404364.htm here is an article about an Australian guy who studied it.

KitchenConfidential,3ay5lr,farang,-11,Wed Jun 24 16:33:21 2015 UTC,"If mussels don't open after being in boiling water, it means they were dead when they hit the water.

KitchenConfidential,3ay5lr,Oneusee,3,Wed Jun 24 14:39:25 2015 UTC,"They aren't rotten. They just have a strong adductor muscle. It is a myth that originated in the 1970s in a cookbook.  The ones you want to discard are the ones that won't close prior to cooking. Those are the ones that are dead or unwell.  A guy in Australia did a study to determine ways to reduce wast and found no problem with eating mussels that don't open after cooking. You can either google it or just look at my other link.  Now, it might be worthwhile to toss them in a restaurant setting because the myth is so widely believed and you don't want to freak out your customers. You aren't going to make anyone sick though."

KitchenConfidential,3aveml,Blade212145,13,Tue Jun 23 20:32:47 2015 UTC,"Keep your eyes up for the ""WALKING IN"" and when they call out something repeat it and say ""heard"". If you are ever unsure ask for an all day or what you have next. Its their job to keep you on track, so if you don't know you will save them time in the long run by asking now."
KitchenConfidential,3aveml,wilma316,3,Tue Jun 23 21:15:52 2015 UTC,"On the contrary, you can say ""heard"" and still not technically know what you're calling back.  I've only worked in verbal call-back kitchens and the best way to remember is to actually call back the dish.  ""Heard"" is a blanket.  If you want to remember, then actually say what it is out loud.    If you're working a station dealing with proteins, then stop what you are doing and immediately pull that protein."

Also I repeat the order, sometimes mimicking the expo to make it more easily memorable for me. Whatever works for you, just figure it out fast."
KitchenConfidential,3aveml,pernod,1 point,Tue Jun 23 23:58:10 2015 UTC,Absolutely this.  As soon as an order is called pull mise for the dish.  As long as there is an item of food physically there that needs process you can make it work.  Edit: don't be afraid to ask for all days when you actually need one.
KitchenConfidential,3aveml,billypootooweet,3,Fri Jun 26 08:20:52 2015 UTC,"I'm can't get past the part where you say ""without any on hand reference to what is needed"". What do you mean by that? You don't know what dishes or components that come off of your station, or you don't  understand how the ticket calling process works? Has this information been provided to you and you haven't memorized it, or have you been tossed into a situation where you are expected to perform without the basic tools being given to you?  It sounds like you have a few days under your belt so a lot of the confusion should be ironed out by now. Either it's a listening/comprehension thing or there's still confusion about what your job entails.  What are we missing here?  When I expo, the ticket machine is the first indicator that an order is coming in. I'll say ""Walking In"", call the order for each station, I'll make any special calls (allergies, weird things the cook needs to look out for, etc) and I'll listen for each station to acknowledge the call. I need to hear the cooks say something to know that they heard the order and I can count on them to prepare what they're responsible for. I know my cooks well enough that even in the way they respond will tell me if they actually heard the call, or they just heard me say something but it didn't really register (which might be my fault - if we're really slammed I'll have to babysit some stations more to help keep them mentally organized).   What I'm getting at I guess, is how is your system different than the one I described (which is pretty universal), and which area exactly are you not meeting your chefs and peers' expectations?"

KitchenConfidential,3aveml,ZachZims,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:02:31 2015 UTC,"I've gotta wonder, as somebody who has gotten a ticket since day one.. how do you remember what's on each order when you have 7 dockets going at once, some larder and some dessert?   And for tables with things on hold, I'm guessing expo calls ""going on table 63, I need 2 y, 3z and 1x""? Does expo say the time for the table, or does whoever will be longest say xminutes on that table?"
KitchenConfidential,3aveml,Oneusee,2,Wed Jun 24 02:30:00 2015 UTC,"pretty much, when the ticket first comes in he calls it out so people have an idea whats coming up and can try to get ahead then it calls fire when its actually time and either will call a target time or communicate with whoever would take the longest to set the target time"
KitchenConfidential,3aveml,Forikorder,1 point,Wed Jun 24 06:27:37 2015 UTC,"It gets tricky for Garde Manger but things like Entremets and I guess if you're a fry cook could make it a lot easier. We call them ""cheats"", say you're in the middle of the rush and you have to remember 5-6 orders. When a new order comes in and it has something with a bun on it or it goes on a specific plate, you can put that plate down and put the bun on it so that you won't forget that you have to make that in 5 minutes."
KitchenConfidential,3aveml,ZachZims,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:52:02 2015 UTC,"Well.. I don't know what garde manger or entremets are. We've got larder, grill and pans. Larder being salads, cold entrees and desserts. Well, and one or two specials involving pan frying things, which I think is the sous letting me have some fun.  Though that wouldn't work if I got busy - I can fit 5 plates, max. Would be interesting without tickets in a Saturday rush - I use the original call as a guide to start this and that, then use the dockets to keep myself in line - and to focus on when I'm being raped."
KitchenConfidential,3aveml,Oneusee,2,Thu Jun 25 16:16:53 2015 UTC,"for one thing, forget all the people on here who think this is how every real kitchen under the sun works because it isn't. As for actual real advice I would actually reach back to my days when I was in high school and needed a math tutor. I had this one guy who taught me how to visualize numbers in my head in a way that kind of mimics writing it down.   so order comes; in you hear x, y, z, but in your head you're always building a mental picture and filing information away into different compartments. you should be able to close your eyes and see and all day, a three minutes out count, a first course, whatever categories you need to create a mental map.   as for physically hearing your expo, that's partly on you to become more relaxed and tuned in to his or her voice, and that's partly on them to make sure they get your call back. if you aren't calling back they should automatically assumer you didn't hear.  any of that make any sense?"
KitchenConfidential,3aveml,beenjammin26,2,Tue Jun 23 23:02:55 2015 UTC,"Ask for all days. If you're unsure ask again. If you're still unsure, ask again. Expo is there to make sure you are all day. In my kitchen, I have the luxury of walking two feet to the window and checking the board for myself if expo is in the weeds, but nine times out of ten they're just happy I'm communicating.   Me: I have one duck medium, one grouper, one sea bass, two pork, two squash, one onion, right?  Expo: You're down one duck medium, two squash and a market catch!  Like every other position I've ever had in any kitchen, communicating, yo. Don't be scared to ask. Let them help you do your job."
KitchenConfidential,3aveml,morgue27,2,Wed Jun 24 07:41:48 2015 UTC,Always always repeat the ticket whether in your head or out loud. Say heard if your sure you got it. ASK for fucking All Days. Seriously any free moment ask.  Soon you will hear tickets in the cooler it'll just take some time. When I was a pantry/pizza tosser  I would repeat the ticket the chef would usually correct me if I was wrong or he would not reply signaling I got it all.
KitchenConfidential,3aveml,cjbhunter,1 point,Sat Jun 27 05:03:23 2015 UTC,"First, figure out what kind of memory you have. If you are really missing having tickets to look at, you might remember the way written words look. So, when you receive a verbal call, picture the words, as they would be written. Some people remember the sound of words better, and still others remember orders as a visual picture. See which of these works the best for you, and concentrate on it.   Listen to everybody's calls, so you have a general awareness of the whole line, and can better time your dishes.   Don't talk to anyone but your expo, unless you absolutely have to, the whole time you're on the line. And communicate to them what you are doing, as well. A verbal call system is all about communication and concentration."
KitchenConfidential,3aveml,ceemojenkins,0,Tue Jun 23 23:04:58 2015 UTC,"That's what happened to me a while back. My biggest trick was active meditation. Clear the mind, focus on what you're doing, but keep open and be aware of everything. Don't just focus on your station and what you're doing. Keep doing it, but you should be getting that down to muscle memory now. Listen, always listen. When your mind starts to wander, close your eyes, breathe in, breathe out, and get back to it. Changing habits like that is hard, and some people just take a little bit longer to change their habits. You got this."
KitchenConfidential,3au67z,hockeyrugby,9,Tue Jun 23 15:16:06 2015 UTC,What is to debate?  If you treat everyone in the kitchen with respect you'll never have to deal with this. Debate is over before it starts.
KitchenConfidential,3au67z,cool_hand_luke,4,Wed Jun 24 03:56:34 2015 UTC,"i'v taken a more laid back approach to talking in my kitchen. say what you want to whomever you want until they ask you to do otherwise. if you make a stupid joke about woman and someone says its not ok then yah don't do it again around that person.   but this road goes both ways. i actually had to fire someone because they were too sensitive. they would complain if someone was calling bills too gruffly. or if they felt that they were being yelled at and such. the kitchen is a stressful place. for many of us words are a way to release stress at a critical moment. it is almost never personally directed at a person only at the situation.  its going to take some serious understanding on both sides of the issue. you as a cook need to learn to adapt to your environments. if your a sensitive person going into a real pirate kitchen then maybe its not the best fit for you. and if your a 30 year old man child that thinks its ok to make holocaust jokes, and your going into a more conservative professional kitchen, then maybe keep your mouth shut or find another place.  the point i am trying to make is that we really need some middle ground here. both sides need to feel comfortable at work but also free to express themselves."

KitchenConfidential,3au67z,DonJulioTO,18,Tue Jun 23 15:43:12 2015 UTC,"pastry chef Kate Burnham’s male bosses groped her breasts and crotch and took turns smacking her rear whenever they passed her in the kitchen, in full view of their colleagues. They badgered her about her sex life, and one of the men stole her phone to search it for explicit pictures. One of the chefs repeatedly propositioned her, threatening her employment when she refused to play along.   I don't know about you but I don't consider this borderline. And regardless of how small you consider some of these things to be, if someone explicitly tell you it make them unconformable and ask you to stop, you stop. That ""deal with it or get out"" attitude that so many cooks have is ridiculous. If you accept harassment and shitty work conditions, it doesn't make you tougher and manlier than everyone else. It makes you a weak coward that let everybody else walk all over you."

KitchenConfidential,3atrxv,lernington,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:40:01 2015 UTC,"Agreed. At the last place I worked, our head chef did it perfectly. When someone on the line would start to fuck up a bunch on the line, he would just send them down to us in the banquet kitchen. They either learns that their job was much more rewarding , or they'd quit. Nine times out of ten they'd return to the line with se more respect for here they were put."
KitchenConfidential,3atrxv,Popichan,4,Wed Jun 24 19:55:39 2015 UTC,"You can't really expect someone who just got demoted to perform at their best. For the vast majority of people, it just doesn't happen. Give it time, be encouraging, and build personal rapport beyond just work communication. If they're invested in you as a person more than as a coworker, they're more likely to want to help you out. That can help bridge the gap between ""fuck this job"" and ""the better I do now, the easier it will for me to leave later."""

It's just really hard getting through to them since they think this position is too easy yet it's a station they have never worked at.
KitchenConfidential,3atrxv,dontworryimstupid,-1,Tue Jun 23 22:02:22 2015 UTC,"Well they probably think they got demoted and forgotten. That is probably untrue, but either way it's how they act now that will define them. If they want to keep working there, they can either choose to fight through it and prove they should never have been demoted, or act like a bitch and reaffirm the chefs intentions.  In the culinary world turnover is high enough that the position they once held may open again, in that case you need a replacement fast.  Do you promote the guy who rolled with the punches or the guy who acted like a bitch."

KitchenConfidential,3atkxw,Lian_Yu,20,Tue Jun 23 12:05:49 2015 UTC,"Heyo just a few things:   The menu seems confused, you are ranging from traditional british fare, to italian, turkish, greek and even french. Now I am not a smart man at the best of times but I do know that when people see such a menu they get a bit worried as they can't pinpoint the identity of the restaurant and wonder ""if they are cooking so many cuisines, maybe some of the food won't be that great"".  I would personally sit down and work out what cuisine the local market is in need of, what cuisine you are capable of making to an excellent standard and finally what cuisine will make you the most money. That will not only make your customers happy, but it will reduce your inventory costs, prep times and wastage.   Will straying from traditional british fare really get you any more customers or money? Why not just concentrate on making excellent british food and making the classics that people love to eat. Have you seen the Kitchen Nightmares episode set in the english pub where they start the ""campaign for real gravy""? If not watch it, that is your situation right now! Here is the link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s67FdBcDkT8  But if you decide to keep this same menu, here are some observations.  1) Don't include orange juice on the meals menu, have a separate drinks menu.  2) I would suggest getting rid of the 2 types of english breakfasts (unless that is a regional norm and people are used to it) and including a bit more variety in your offerings. It seems to be too heavily reliant on eggs and bacon. Perhaps try some other breakfast items like porridge with mixed berries or pancakes etc. This actually applies for the whole menu, there is bacon and eggs popping up every where!  3) prawn cocktail description: ""herb packed"" sounds weird, just say ""herb mayonnaise"".  4) You have 2 break offerings in your starter menu, that is good in the sense that it is easy money and easy for the kitchen to pump out, but not so good as it provides less choice for customers. Add something else interesting there like grilled Haloumi with tzatziki, or a single serve of the grilled chicken skewers.  5) Maybe add in a chicken burger? or a nice vegetarian portabello mushroom burger.  6) Make sure you list the weight of the steaks.  7) No roast?  8) Need a better description for the Scampi dish. What is it? Just a plain grilled tail with chips on the side? No accompaniments, no marinade or herbed butter?  It is late, but that is what I could come up with at a glance. Sorry If I sound harsh, but please know I am trying to be constructive!  Good luck!"

KitchenConfidential,3atkxw,Scamwau,10,Wed Jun 24 03:05:03 2015 UTC,"Absolutely no offence intended but this looks like a tremendously dated menu for a provincial Northern bistro circa 1993. Having orange juice as a starter choice tells me you're aged 50+? I'm not intending that as an insult but more to look at where you're coming from.   Mainly: way too much choice; I'd cut it back massively. You're trying to be all things to all people. This very rarely works; there will always be people prepared to microwave Brakes Bros produce for less of a profit than you. Do something to stand out. The breakfast section seems fine. For the style of place it appears to be, the starters look completely superfluous/half thought through. If you are mainly doing lunches then starters aren't going to sell. Lose the curry lose the pasta. You won't be able to do them properly. Why not scale it back to 6/7 main courses and do them really well? A great steak and chips, a great pie, faggots, fish & chips. Get a good fish pie on there. Even if you've got a small menu doing things from scratch will be hard work; customers do know the difference though."

To avoid waste, and as they retain more nutrients than tinned I use frozen.   they should never take longer than 8 minutes to make either!  100g frozen peas - cook in boiling water till tender (should take around 3 mins) Drain peas and transfer them to a blender add 1/3 tablespoon butter, tablespoon of cream and salt and pepper to taste.   Blend to your liking and serve."

KitchenConfidential,3atkxw,jay_emdee,6,Tue Jun 23 13:09:09 2015 UTC,"Dated, dated, dated I worked in a touristy pub in London in 1997 and we had almost the same menu, is this intended? I mean, you refer in your post to a large ammount of the clientele being ""older generation"" so... -Loose all the bacon and, sausage and egg, etc just serve the breakfast options all day. -Loose the pastas. They add nothing to your menu and they read as ""oh goody, pre-packaged stuff"". -Loose anything and everything that sounds like it will do the route ""from the freezer to the frier"" no mozzarella sticks, no chiken kiev. If you need some frier items, they do save time, make something people can be sure is made in house (aren't gourmet scotch eggs quite popular at the moment? venison and duck egg maybe?) -Chiken curry I would get rid of too, unless there are no indian restaurants five miles around you. Theirs will be cheaper and better. And even then I'd try to be a bit more original in that deparment. Maybe something with lamb, if I'm not mistaken you have great lamb around there and there's not a sign of it in your menu. -Nothing says outdated like gammon steak, except gammon steak and pneaple ring. Loose it. -Unless you have a roaring trade on it two different steaks sounds like too much for a cafe, get rid of one. So, all in all dated and too large, I would get rid of about half the menu, up the game in the rest of stuff (it's not lamb, it's ""local reared lamb from blah, blah, blah"" it's not cod, it's ""cod in our traditional beer batter made with real ale from our local brewery"") use the ""breakfast served all day"" card, make sure customers know you're working from scratch, and loose all the frozen pre-packed crap because with a strong competition (11 cafes in a small town IS strong competition) if you can't set yourself appart from them, you're dead in the water. Hope this helps, best of luck"""

KitchenConfidential,3aqjer,Getinthevandude,7,Mon Jun 22 19:33:26 2015 UTC,If your manager talks to you about you not serving kids and risking your career/ gross misdemeanor. I'd look for a new gig asap!
KitchenConfidential,3aqjer,Getinthevandude,5,Mon Jun 22 19:35:51 2015 UTC,"Nah, he always backs me up when it comes to ID checks and refusing to serve. But he answers to higher-up managers, who answer to owners, etc etc etc. To them it's all about public reputation, rather than taking whatever means necessary to serve properly. They'd be concerned about the rudeness...but sometimes it's impossible to get a drunk, underage kid out of your bar without a bit of a cold shoulder. Such is the life!"
KitchenConfidential,3aqjer,Getinthevandude,3,Mon Jun 22 19:38:16 2015 UTC,I couldn't do what you do. That's why I cook. Loud obnoxious drunks or squealing girls. People shouting at me all night. The level of disrespect female bartenders put up with. No thank you!
KitchenConfidential,3aqjer,TheRealLilSebastian,2,Mon Jun 22 20:11:00 2015 UTC,"Man, the drunks/fake IDs aren't even the worst of it. Harassment from customers happens daily, and none of my male co-workers ever get bad reviews when they decide to be rude to someone. At the same time, I couldn't do what you do -- making the same dish hundreds of times, dealing with re-fires and allergies, sweating all night in a hot kitchen? No, thank YOU :)"

It's not hot behind a bar? All that thinking and grabbing running plus drunk people?'
KitchenConfidential,3aqjer,mambouli,4,Mon Jun 22 20:43:01 2015 UTC,Any owner with half a brain would be concerned over losing their liquor and/or business license for serving minors.
KitchenConfidential,3aqjer,PAdogooder,2,Mon Jun 22 20:25:22 2015 UTC,"If somebody is killed by a drunk served liquor at your bar, the business could be sued into oblivion. If you ever need backup for why you didn't pour for a person you thought was too drunk, give them a link to the website of a local lawyer that specializes in suing bars that over served drunk drivers."
KitchenConfidential,3aqjer,PAdogooder,2,Tue Jun 23 14:50:45 2015 UTC,Yup.  The people who writes Yelp review are he last people whose opinion I'm interested to hear.

KitchenConfidential,3aqjer,DoctorTacoMD,3,Mon Jun 22 19:22:26 2015 UTC,"Seriously! Most people have been cool about it.

KitchenConfidential,3as3n0,zolack,4,Tue Jun 23 01:43:38 2015 UTC,"Knowing this sub, a couple of people are going to answer and try and temper your love of cooking with the reality of what it means it work in a kitchen, so I won't bother. They'll be half right, though: working in a kitchen is not glamorous. It can be fun, it can be rewarding, and you can learn a lot of things, but it's not glamorous. It's always at least a little bit stressful, dirty, and hot.  The first thing is to not be a shitbag. Don't show up high, drunk, late, filthy, sick. Don't try to lie, cheat, steal from, harass, or be a dick to coworkers. You'd be surprised at the number of people I've worked with, not for long mind you, who couldn't act like decent human beings.  Secondly, don't be a dumbass. I consider myself to be low in common sense, but I still have a moderately high position in a good, if casual and simple, restaurant. Do what I do/did: ask questions. Always ask questions, even for seemingly simple things. Never make the same mistake twice, either.  Finally, work hard. People notice good workers and bad workers fairly quickly. Your coworkers will pick up on it, your supervisor, your chef, they'll will quickly figure out if you give a shit or not.  You don't have to have a lot of cooking experience to get a job as a dishie or bus boy, but if you're a good, smart, clean worker who shows promise it won't be long before you'll get picked up and trained to do simple prep/line tasks. At least, that's how it works in my place.   You should submit your CV to restaurants. It won't be relevant, but it will show that you haven't spent the last several years of your life hiding under a rock and smoking pot all day. A lot of places will hire potential cooks as dishwashers to weed out the ones that won't cut it, and you'll have little to no issue getting a job as a dishwasher even with no experience."

I needed a job, last grasp attempt was restaurants. Got a job in the dish in a fancyish Italian joint. Worked my ass off there, people liked me. Some friends of guys I was working with were opening a new restaurant, wanted me there in the dish, went over, started doing some prep too, made it to the line.   Then once the summer ended went back to the Italian place for about a month before applying at a sports bar in town. Head chefs wife worked at the Italian place. Started cooking at the sports bar. Learnt lots on the job. People had a bit more patience with me as I was foreign and knew I was inexperienced.   Worked there for a year, relationship with my ex went to shit, decided to do a working holiday in Australia. Got cooking jobs there. Stayed for a year. Came back to Sweden, sports bar had a restaurant in the new city I'm in, been working there two years to put myself through studying now. Currently rocking the grill at the busiest summer restaurant in the area.   So now I've been in kitchens for about 4 and a half years or so. Learnt a lot. Trying to get out.   Just apply places, someone will take a chance on you, be honest with you experience. If you start in the dish ask the cooks what stuff is, what they're doing (if it's not too busy), show some interest and if you work hard there's a chance they'll bring you up to the line."

No matter what job they want to complain about doing, or what job they want to complain about you not doing, they don't have a leg to stand on. Its like an investment for later impunity.  It really isn't that hard   Despite the bad rep it has, if you have a meticulous game plan. You can move through very quickly. Plan in advance. Take note of the small things that sucked last time. Devise a way to prevent those things. Once you have a good system, you can be in and out of that trap in no time.  Shift beer  Many places will give their employees shift beers.

(Corn starch is crucial; our first few batches we dredged in flour and they always ended up exploding and/or sticking to the bottom of the basket. Chef has some sort of irrational hatred of corn starch but finally relented once he saw how much damaged product we weren't having to toss.) Egg wash Panko. Not fresh out of the bag, we put it through the robot-coupe for a few pulses along with some grated Parmesan cheese, approximately 1 cup Parmesan for every 2 cups panko.

KitchenConfidential,3apn93,Haro_Mr_Jakku,1 point,Tue Jun 23 07:39:59 2015 UTC,"For starters, the eggplant is prepped in much larger batches than the other toppings. For this reason, it is rarely made.   We begin by peeling the eggplants. They then go into a large bucket full of water and begin to soak while the rest of the eggplants are peeled. Once all of the eggplants are peeled, the water is poured out of the bucket. More water is poured in along with vinegar and a few other things (maybe some salt? I forget the recipe). The eggplants soak for a little while longer. They are then cubed and placed into another bucket. Oil and an elaborate blend of spices are portioned into the bucket with the eggplant. The mixture is stirred. We place the mixture onto baking sheets and send it into the oven.   What makes this recipe such a pain in the butt is the scale at which we make it. Additionally, the manager is rather picky about ensuring the exact amount of each spice is used. I don't enjoy cooking with somebody breathing down my neck.  It isn't the worst thing in the world by any means, it is just the worst job in our kitchen.  Working at a pizza restaraunt, the eggplant is used as a topping. I personally enjoy a pizza with roasted red peppers, eggplant, tomato, jalapeno, and parmasean flakes."

KitchenConfidential,3aq08p,Saltycook,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:44:46 2015 UTC,How hot does your water get out the tap? If it's not too hot to handle it won't tackle grease to well.
KitchenConfidential,3aq08p,starlightprincess,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:53:10 2015 UTC,"Good detergent, and lots of it, followed by a hearty scrub.   Next, sweep or squeegee. As you know, a mop will just spread it around. You could use a mop and change your water a thousand times, but that would be even suckier than what I'm suggesting. A wet vac and squeegee is an alternative.   With fresh good detergent, do it again. You may need to repeat the squeegee or broom. Once you get most of it up you can finish with fresh detergent and a normal mop.  Gonna suck, but the only way to get that floor clean will be through much more effort.   Accordingly, it is highly advisable to keep the floors from getting that greasy. Once you get the buildup off it shouldn't be that hard to keep it clean."
KitchenConfidential,3aq08p,JustinM75,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:23:12 2015 UTC,The few shops I've worked in without floor drains usually kept a wet/dry shop vac around; try vaccuuming up the first scrub solution after applied? Your results may vary. Remember to empty and rinse it out afterwards!

Don't substitute baking soda, not the same thing!, 2 gal hot water.  Mix until bubbly.  A little goes a long way.  Don't use on waxed floors, JS.

KitchenConfidential,3aq08p,EldritchInquisitor,1 point,Tue Jun 23 00:19:56 2015 UTC,You can actually make washing soda very simply from baking soda. All you need to do is bake baking soda at 200ºC for around half an hour. I followed this website's 'recipe' when I made it. She gives a basic rundown on the science and method involved. It's quite easy and baking soda tends to be cheaper then washing soda!  http://www.pennilessparenting.com/2011/01/homemade-washing-soda.html#

Nobody wants to cook for themselves at a time like that. Good food nurtures body and soul in times of heavy grief. Its important.  Be there for him, allow/cover him to take some time if he needs it. Listen. Be patient. Be caring. Give him projects and busy work if he asks for it, some people deal with pain easier when they have something else to focus on. Show him that you support him but don't suffocate him or treat him like he is broken or missing something because of his loss.   Give him room to grieve. Be there for him when he is ready to move on.  That's all you really can do, unless you think he needs a new set of knives as well.

One year, we had a server die and one critically injured in a motorcycle accident (they were friends out riding together, the one guy was lucky he didn't die too); they were also roommates/really good friends with two other servers. Our manager, who was a former server, waited tables for a night and donated his tips to the three surviving roommates. That was incredibly generous and inspirational to the whole store. I think some other servers donated their tips that night too (I was off that day, so I came in and stayed in the manager's section and left a tip/donation.) Felt good, man.   So yea.

KitchenConfidential,3amk1u,Saltycook,8,Sun Jun 21 19:50:04 2015 UTC,"Girl in the kitchen, weighing in!

""No, I cook there.""  ""Oh, like salads? Sometimes the dishes?""  ""...No, I'm one of the Chefs.""  ""Wow! Good for you! I never would have guessed.""   Really? Fucking really? If you're a sexist imbecile, shouldn't you EXPECT the woman to be in the kitchen?"
KitchenConfidential,3amk1u,wannabgourmande,1 point,Mon Jun 22 02:14:52 2015 UTC,"This gives an idea why:  It's difficult to determine the number of female chefs working in the industry, relative to the number of male chefs, early in the 21st century. Industry surveys provide an estimate, and they say women account for approximately 20 percent of respondents to the American Culinary Federation's 2011 salary survey. Surveys in 2010 and 2011 by StarChefs reported similarly low numbers, with 396 female respondents in 2011 compared to 1,325 men. The 2010 StarChefs survey broke out respondents by gender and job title, providing additional insight. Sixteen percent of female respondents were executive chefs and 14 percent were CEOs or chef/owners, compared to 38 percent and 11 percent of male respondents."
KitchenConfidential,3amk1u,Spartanfred104,4,Mon Jun 22 05:43:41 2015 UTC,"You know, I really shouldn't be that surprised at this. I can't speak for the world, but I can speak for America, and the way we raise our girls is to condition them to be soft and quit. If something is hard, they can just do something else. We're kind of expected to flip flop to many careers, and to find balance between work and home life. I really don't think guys have that same issue. It's a very subtle, small thing that goes unnoticed in the way that girls are raised.  And you know what? No WONDER there are so few female chefs/managers/Execs/owners with that kind of attitude. It takes a rare female to work as hard as the guys do.  My own kitchen is becoming more and more of a Boys' Club every day, and sure, it's annoying and sometimes frustrating, but if this vocation has taught me anything, it's to put my head down, ignore the bullshit, and work through it to prove what I can do. I know I can do just as well as those guys can, if given the opportunity, and that keeps me going.  In Culinary school, the girls outnumbered the boys, especially in the baking and pastry. I hate to say it, but the stereotype of girls not going into savory really is ""they hate touching raw meat and fish"". I swear to fucking God, it's the truth. But the girls dropped out the further and further they got in, and more and more every day I see them, around town, working at gas stations, retail stores, all because they thought ""cooking for work was supposed to be fun, not so hard"" and that was just okay. That shit is just expected of girls, for them to quit when things get hard, and let the men handle it. It's this weird, quiet, everyday sexism that happens in the real world.  I realize that I've gone on a bit of a rant here, but I haven't had my 3rd coffee, yet, so my filter hasn't yet turned on. Anyway. I can speak as to why a fraction of women might not be in the Kitchen professionally. I'm just in in because I'm fucking nuts."

When we correct them, they assume she makes salads... She runs ovens yo, and makes damn good pizzas. Stop assuming my lady is any less of a cook than I am!  And when we correct them, they act all, ""oh wow, Id have never guessed""  What the fuck does that even mean? You saying my lady is weak or some shit?  Its also really funny when new guys start, and don't know she's my gf. Theyll come up to me and say something like ""Man that chicks hot""  Ill generally respond, ""Yeah, I think I'll take her home tonight."" to which one of my coworkers overhearing the conversation will burst out laughing.

To be honest, I find cooks to be far less sexist than the average non-cook. They make sexist jokes, but most of the time its in parody. As in, theyre putting on a sexist facade in order to poke fun at actually sexist people.  In other words, most of the 'sexist' jokes are actually us saying ""jesus, sexists are fucking stupid""  I have certainly encountered actual sexists in the industry. And no one ever likes them. I had one guy who for some reason would always give knife lessons to the ladies who started. I remember one time we had this lady who came in, previous sous chef at another bigger place nearby that had closed, had her red seal, etc etc.  First thing he does is start 'teaching' her how to sharpen a knife, while showing off how fancy his knife was...

I generally make on par or more than most guys because I work my ass off.

I've also dealt with weird/creepy touching from other cooks, nothing harassing or inappropriate but enough for me to be respond with, ""Hey dude, I told you I'm not a fan of unnecessary physical contact, do that again and see what happens.""  All this could be chalked up to other issues that vary person to person though; I'm loud, direct and I don't fuck around at work...

Uh, dudes, there's nothing but a bit of glass between the expo kitchen and our customers; they can hear you! Also I'm uninterested in your sexual proclivities!

Personality does come into play when hiring someone, and sometimes you can't predict what employees will say and do.  I've seen sexism in the kitchens...I have been the only male employee at times (even the dishwashers), which got increasingly more complicated with my stay...Which is another story all together. But I have seen my fellow guy cooks get away with shit that shouldn't even be tolerated in a kitchen...Although, I have seen the female cooks do this as well...which should not be negated just because they pull the vagina card, which I've seen quite a few times as well.  I've seen just what they're capable of, and I gotta say...they tend to have a more professional approach to it; albeit they pack on way more stress than what they think they should carry and it shows in some areas (mostly during service, which I get but...a 200 cover night would very quickly feel like a 600 cover night if the sous is trying to prove shit to who the fuck cares.)  From my point of view, it seemed like they felt like every day was an audition...No flexibility, no prisoners taken, no jokes, and heaven help you if the entire kitchen has PMS; which has happened to me more than once. I still have the scars from on occasion when the female sous threw a hot cast iron skillet at me because I asked if she wanted a break off the line.  I honestly can't say, I don't know what they go through, but I couldn't see myself working like that forever and say I loved what I do with a straight face. I've also seen the other side of the spectrum...I've worked with some A1 douche nuggets, and that behavior in any kitchen with anyone shouldn't be rewarded...But then again that goes for both sexes (girls can be just as bad, if not, worse in some cases) I could go on and on about the differences between the two, but I don't feel like writing an even bigger wall of text today.

I just pull out my IR laser thermometer, and show them the read on it ""MAX""  The laser maxes out at 1k Fahrenheit... So, hotter than that."
KitchenConfidential,3al5vz,thundracleez,1 point,Sun Jun 21 20:54:26 2015 UTC,My wood oven has a thermometer on it. It hangs out around 650-700 unless I feel like a big fire then it creeps up on 850. The temp it shows isn't a good indication of how hot it is though because no one knows where the sensor is and the difference between fire and a pile of coals is huge.
KitchenConfidential,3al5vz,Formaldehyd3,1 point,Sun Jun 21 21:30:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's why I use the laser, I can check the deck, the hot wall, cold wall, back wall, and my dome instantly...

KitchenConfidential,3al5vz,veruus,1 point,Sun Jun 21 22:46:43 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but It more than likely uses IR, not a laser, for reading your temp. The laser is just for aiming."

KitchenConfidential,3al5vz,veruus,2,Tue Jun 23 03:11:54 2015 UTC,"Block only the laser, not the whole sensor. It's an IR thermometer.

The majority of the issue was expo trying to keep the orders in line when he can't bump them off his own screen, nor can he have tickets print, and servers were trying to grab whatever they could.

KitchenConfidential,3akcpu,cjdubs66,39,Sun Jun 21 01:25:07 2015 UTC,"The problem might be that you ""let the leash off"".  Pull back a little, compromise and see what happens. The most embarrassing menu you have ever put out is a financial success so run with it.  Come up with specials that explore your creativity.  Incorporate it slowly into your menu. Don't try to do too much too fast.  If you are good, then the servers will back you.  They are motivated by money, and dont care about your artistic side.  If your embarrassing menu sells, you are already ahead of the game.  Don't worry about the customers not getting your ideas, just keep plugging away slowly. Put the leash back on and slowly get it to where you feel it should be."
KitchenConfidential,3akcpu,yjacketcbr600,15,Sun Jun 21 02:46:38 2015 UTC,"This is a good comment.  It sucks that you put your heart into a menu that didn't really take off. But the way you're looking at the situation is a recipe for more frustration.  The fact is, you work for a business, and the restaurant needs to make money. You were spending too much time and money on dishes that weren't really selling. Just walking away from this experience with a bruised ego teaches you nothing. The new menu, if it's profitable and popular, is a better menu in some important and objective ways. There are lessons from that. Try to work within the context of the ""embarrassing"" menu - see if you can elevate the quality and ambition while still hitting your food costs and still satisfying the less adventurous diners."
KitchenConfidential,3akcpu,Snagsby,1 point,Sun Jun 21 04:27:52 2015 UTC,I have been slowly incorporating. That's been the goal since day one. When I said took the leash off I meant in a I was finally there type of way. I hear what you're saying for sure though. I have a few servers that are amazing and pushed it hard. We had a pretty large turnover though and a lot of the new people just aren't up to speed enough with savory menu to focus on a pastry one that needs selling. Maybe we will get there maybe we won't. Who knows. Just really disheartening to squash a menu that I felt was super strong and replace it with one that I wouldn't order anything from if given in a restaurant. We do have the price fixe menu though so I can at least supplement some creativity into that.
KitchenConfidential,3akcpu,BlackMantecore,3,Sun Jun 21 03:30:35 2015 UTC,Can you talk to management? I would be pissed if the servers couldn't get behind the kitchen. That seems like a bigger problem that needs to be addressed.
KitchenConfidential,3akcpu,nSquib,9,Sun Jun 21 05:51:14 2015 UTC,"Speaking from the other side and having been there for menu changes like this, sometimes servers really want to get behind the kitchen, but customers are too resistant, so servers need the kitchen to get just a little more in line with the customer base. I've worked at two museums now during a process of updating and ""modernizing"" the menu. First one, we had amazing new seasonal items, but older museum members outright rejected the changes and demanded old items be brought back. Chef refused, next thing you know, chef, the GM, and a few servers are out as collateral damage.  Another museum I worked at, chef outright refused to put any crowd pleasing items (not even dumbed down, just more accessible items) on the menu and then wondered why our business dropped precipitously a few months after open and why we were getting such poor reviews across the board (2.5 stars on Yelp after 200 reviews and similar on all other sites). Like kept a $19 beef/shrimp/lamb mini burger trio on the menu long after people were literally begging him to put on a $16 premium quality topping Wagyu burger or something similar the tourists could get behind. He refused to listen to any of the feedback FOH was getting from guests for over a year. I know it's frustrating when you're used to doing Beard Award winning food and now you have to pander to tourists, but that's what you take on when you do a restaurant in a museum. I had to leave because I couldn't take the negativity coming from both the guests and the kitchen. We were stuck in the middle and got it coming and going.   So sometimes there's a much bigger story there, and that's what I suspect happened here with OP."
KitchenConfidential,3akcpu,BlackMantecore,5,Sun Jun 21 10:05:35 2015 UTC,This is a really good point too. It's certainly possible to get too far up your own ass about your vision and such.
KitchenConfidential,3akcpu,vsanna,1 point,Sun Jun 21 16:59:52 2015 UTC,"I've had to do a similar thing recently, but the chef and I are friends and we are both frustrated at having to compromise. I decided to focus on perfecting techniques, and I still get to run specials, and the things we decided on as anchor items have a lot of room for seasonal changes. Is it what I want to be doing? Not really. But it's a secure position and having that little bit of wiggle room, and the desire to make every batch better than the last makes it bearable."
KitchenConfidential,3akcpu,UdownWitOPP,8,Sun Jun 21 19:31:24 2015 UTC,"Been there, friend. I had an incredible aroncini appetizer on 3 rotations of the dinner menu and it just never caught on.

I had a table of VIPs come in one night and I sent a complimentary order out to their table. They ordered 3 more to split amongst the table.

I busted my ass for him, so he treated me like the guy he wanted his daughter to marry. But the dude was otherwise an angry, bitter, motherfucker. His kitchen was on the third level, which required climbing two ladders to gain entrance. Off the back dock was a hatch with a port hole cover that allowed us to dump garbage into the dumpster, which was garaged, without having to climb down the two ladders. I'm out on the dock, having a smoke one afternoon and the Albert busts through the door to the dock with one of the food service salesmen gripped by the neck and belt. In almost a single motion he kicks off the garbage hatch cover and flings the dude down into the dumpster. Understand the dude sounds like Arnold Schwarzenegger, so when he says ""That will teach you to lie to me about the prices!"" it sounds like it's straight out of a movie. I gave him my best dumb face ever."

Having not worked in a kitchen before I engaged in my usual approach to interviewing; I went ahead and cleaned myself up, shaved my beard, and got almost a buzz cut.

I worked a shift as a prep cook last month (it was the only job I hadn't done in the restaurant) and had a horrible time.

""The prep cook just walked out, if you get up here in the next 15 minutes I think you'll have a job.""  I showed up in sandals and shorts, not knowing what to expect. The kitchen manager looked me over, looked at my buddy and said ""We'll give him a try. Get him started on the prep list."" At the end of the day the KM told me to show up at six the next morning and never wear sandals or shorts in his kitchen again.  It was a great place to get a start. The KM was the shit and they place did things the right way. I was processing and cooking four turkeys every other day, making stocks & sauces, prepping 100# potatoes daily and assisting the 75 year old baker with his more physical tasks.  A couple month later my roommate started letting me fuck around on the line when they were slow. When he left for another job the KM hired someone ""with experience"" from the outside but I beat the new guy out for the line job and he became the new prep bitch."

KitchenConfidential,3aitth,chadisacountry,7,Sat Jun 20 16:40:47 2015 UTC,If you can afford it take the one you want.
KitchenConfidential,3aitth,lordtyrian,3,Sat Jun 20 20:05:01 2015 UTC,"I'm not in the industry, I just like to lurk here and live vicariously through you guys.  I'm an accountant in a dead-end job and feel like I sold out years ago just to make a buck.  If I had it all to do over again, I'd go a different direction for sure.  The bottom line is if you really value your vegan ethics (I can't empathize as I'm a card-carrying carnivore), don't make the same mistake I did.  It would suck to find yourself regretting it down the road.  Just my two cents..."
KitchenConfidential,3aitth,erikivy,2,Sat Jun 20 17:02:52 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the insight. I completely understand about selling out. The corporate gig is more about making food that needs to be consistent throughout all the of restaurants (they're more like a healthy food kiosks all over the city), and my job would be to make sure everything if perfect on all levels.   The veg restaurant is what I am more into. I love service, I love plating and I love sending food out that people can experience right there in the moment.   Sigh, I have a tasting with the corporate gig on Tuesday, so I'll see how it goes and hopefully be able to make my decisions then."
KitchenConfidential,3aitth,Sinfoniaopera,2,Sat Jun 20 17:07:59 2015 UTC,"Do you mind disclosing what the non corporate gig would pay? If it's like 20K a year less and it would mean you'd have a hard time paying bills you might want to ""sell out"" for a few months till you can find something that pays like it and isn't soul sucking.   Just explain that you gave it a try things aren't working out with them.  If it's only a little less then take what makes you happy man.  You only got one life. Spend it enjoying what you do."
KitchenConfidential,3aitth,Combo_salamander,1 point,Sat Jun 20 17:20:54 2015 UTC,Honestly. as a head cook I only make 26K a year. Canada and the restaurant industry suck. The non corporate job would be close to 45K.   I also don't want to lose the opportunity with the non corporate too. We'll see. I guess I just need to get a feel of what it will be like.   The corporate gig obviously have deep pockets. They have opened 6 locations in less than 2 years and are aiming for 10 more by the end of 2016.
KitchenConfidential,3aitth,breezybee420,3,Sat Jun 20 17:24:15 2015 UTC,"Was that mainly one person you spoke to? You might get a different take from the general managers or franchise owners themselves. Those are the people who really put the blood sweat and tears into the business. Also, how old are you? Are you thinking of having kids in the next 10 years or so? Buying a house? Can you work mass hard for a year and then take off and eat your way across Europe or Asia for a month? It might be a better quality of life to have a 9-5ish job for a while. What do you want out of life? These kinds of restaurants will encourage more people to eat healthy, in a larger scale even if it is just substituting their big Mac of the day."

Here are a couple of things that I've done in the past:  Orange twist, and you can do something like slice a strawberry in half, and add that to the orange twist for some variety.  You can use two orange twists together for something like this.  Strawberry fans are an obvious easy one.  Cut open a strawberry and add some mint to it.  Tomato slice twists (the same as with the orange) is good for a savory dish.  Or even doing something like shingling a slice of orange, kiwi, and strawberry, so that you have some color variety, would be a simple one.    You could do an image search on Google for something like ""breakfast garnish"" or ""breakfast plate garnish"", and you'll get a ton of results."

Chef de partie are sous-chefs that manage a particular set of food. For example, you'll have a saucier who's the chef de partie for sauces and that guy will have line cooks working under him, helpers basically. You have the same thing for all types of ingredients. Chef de partie for veggies and fruits, for example, with helpers under him, and so on and so forth.   source: i'm from Québec, have been to culinary school (french cuisine obviously since its in Québec) and this is one of the first things our teachers taught us."

Being a chef is 10% making food for people and 90% fretting over other people's money and trying to get the people who make food for people to taste what you taste.   My kid (who I spend more time with than anyone else outside of my restaurant) tells anyone who will listen that I'm a cook. He thinks making food is about as cool as the singing cactus on ""Sesame Street"". If nothing else, I long for a day when people get with that idea instead of fetishizing the guy who pores over P+Ls and digs through your mise and yells about shit coming off of your station being too over/under seasoned."

Long version - your ROI would be terrible, you'd be learning skills that you won't put to use (eg, lamb for 250 people, menu design in a professional $$/plate to create profit context, et al). Being a good cook (or even food truck cook) isn't what you'll learn - you'd be learning how to make money and be efficient in a consistent repeatable fashion, while creating good food.  When I'm wearing the work apron, I'm aiming to make a profit, by creating good food that makes people happy. Say, 88th percentile food. When I'm wearing my funny ""hope you like unicorn"" apron at home for friends,  I'm aiming for 96th percentile food, I'm not in a massive rush (time=$$), more likely to use higher-end ingredients (not trying to turn a profit), and can faff about doing techniques that aren't consistently repeatable by a wide range of personnel in a kitchen (consistency across staff is key to making a menu turn out well)."

If you've got Ivy League College debt on a job that wages are so low starting, you're setting yourself up for default, homelessness, or even if you can manage to stay afloat on it debt for life.

So for me, I'd say culinary school was worth it for two reasons.  It was fully paid for by the GI Bill and I was completely new to cooking.  So I learned a lot starting from scratch as I did.  But looking at your pictures, you seem to have a pretty good grasp already.  So I'm not sure if you'd get as much out of it.  You could just find good books and videos online.  But on the other hand, one of the things I really liked about culinary school was getting instant feedback as I performed various cooking techniques which helped me learn how to do things properly.  ""That pork chop needs a little more color.  Continue searing it for another minute."" ""Your hollandaise is beginning to break.  Add a few drops of water.""  Etc."

I had a problem when I developed my first menu with the fact that I thought I had a decent amount of items but I had way too many options for the same items. For example. You lump Bar Wings as a single item but you have 10 different ways to order them. You have 5 Salads but 20 different options. Just by the time you get through the first page you're bombarded with well over 50 options. If you're gonna give them wings, either give them a wing menu or give them one type of wing with one size. Kill the sides and pick their side for them according to the dish. Kill half the sandwiches/burgers. Kill 2 salads and 4 Sharables. And definitely kill the extras/add ons."

And I'm not against any of the ideas for sure, but he's a very very difficult person to tell no.  It's to the point where I'm going to neuter things, and basically tell him that, especially for opening initially, this is what is reasonable, and doable given how much scratch cooking we're going to be doing.  That's mostly why I started throwing this out on reddit and a few forums, because I'm concerned the amount of prep work is just going to be astronomical, so any advice on where to trim the uh, ""fat"", is most useful.  So I appreciate the input."

Nicely remind him that he pays your salary for you to make these decisions. If you don't do it now you can end up six months down the road with huge labor costs from prep and high food costs with him scratching he's head wondering why he Is losing money when all the other places doing these things are doing just fine, while you sit in the alley mumbling to yourself about how you knew all of these extra items were unreasonable and he should have listened to you.

Even if it was half as large, there are a lot of complicated dishes. There are lots of sauces and items that guests will want removed, 'on the side', and substituted from dish to dish.    If you have a complicated menu FoH has to know it extremely well, strong order entry systems, and BoH that is willing to take constant mods. If any of those components aren't in place you will spend each day giving away food or losing customers.  In other words, you can do it, but not without careful training of people who aren't idiots.

He was just graduating high school, and his friends would constantly come to eat at the restaurant. If I couldn't find his ass, he would be out sitting with his friends. Usually on slow days, I wouldn't care so long as he was getting his shit done- but once or twice I had to go find him and drag him back in. He never saw anything wrong with the behavior either. One instance:   Me: Hey, Marsh- have you seen dishie? I'm fucking in the weeds, and running out of pans- I need his ass in here cleaning.  Marsh: Not sure, give me a second... oh, yea- sitting with his friends.  Me: WTF- tell him to get his ass in here, NOW.  Marsh: Nope, he's just giving me the bird.  Me: Fuckin... fine.   I walk out to the floor, and get his attention. Eyes go bigger than the pans his sorry ass should be cleaning. He stands up, and follows me to the kitchen where I fucking laid into him.   Me: You're here to fucking work, not hang out with your dickless friends. Do yourself a fucking favour, get a work ethic and clean my fucking dishes or so help me GOD I WILL TALK TO SHAWNA (owner).

At the end of the day it's all each person  can do to just to stay out of the weeds themselves. Ultimately when the breakfast & lunch rushes come, no one will be there to bail you out. Everyone is expected to own their station & get all the necessary prep & cleaning done in the allotted time. Even if I so desired, I wouldn't be allowed to work off the clock to help out, too much liability.  Then damn sure aren't going to pay a sous chef time & a half to wash dishes.

KitchenConfidential,3a8djd,ZachZims,2,Fri Jun 19 04:27:13 2015 UTC,"No most restaurants don't close at 8. Also I would suggest going corporate and getting into a chain to start. There will be older guys there that are just doing the gig as a ""retirement"" and are more than happy to take on a willing young trainee.   Also you will rarely get saturday sunday off in a row. ""Family reasons"" means you want to spend time with your family? Because you can kiss that goodbye in most restaurants. That's why I suggested going corporate, seeing as they will try and accommodate you as much as possible. Good luck!"
KitchenConfidential,3a8djd,ZachZims,2,Thu Jun 18 01:13:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I would not think any place but a deli would be closing that early being that our main focus is lunch, while I'll be expecting to move to a dinner focused place. I was kind of asking, though I realize that I wasn't very clear about it, what is being on the line usually like? What's the process for prep, and what not?"
KitchenConfidential,3a8djd,GAngelum,5,Thu Jun 18 01:43:05 2015 UTC,"Theres usually two shifts in a restaurant, the morning and night.  The morning guys come in very early (sometimes around 7am) and prep like mad, receive orders and put them away until the lunch crowd starts to happen. They do lunch and then clean up after, and stay and help prep with the dinner guys (who usually arrive at around 2-4pm).  As far as physically being on the line, it gets intense. You get hot and sweaty, dehydrated. Your body starts to hurt after a while but the real kicker is keeping your focus for sometimes 2-3 hours straight. Sure everyone can kick some ass for an hour, but how about 3 in a row with no time to even take a breath?  Before you get into this trade which can be extremely rewarding and fun you should know that it can also be very trying on one's emotions, body and mind. There's a lot of ups and downs to the industry. You have been warned."

Thanks for going out of your way to make me look bad because you're ignorant..it was carnaroli ya dumb butt!  I had another write a bad review 8 months after the fact - describing a menu from before I was hired and there was a major overhaul. Just..why? Who does that?
KitchenConfidential,3a24mc,grau_is_friddeshay,6,Tue Jun 16 18:14:34 2015 UTC,Wow carnaroli is so much better than aborio in my opinion
KitchenConfidential,3a24mc,Miltomix,19,Tue Jun 16 19:28:23 2015 UTC,"A while ago there was a ""critic"" running a blog reviewing local restaurants. He had seemingly reviewed every restaurant in town and every single review was negative. I'd call it nitpicking, but this went well beyond that. He was going out of his way to find anything and everything he could to complain about in order to give a negative review. Places he did in fact give a positive review to were always insanely cheap dumps, like 99cent pizza.   Anyways, I was working at this small brunch joint at the time it was reviewed by him. While he didn't bother to comment on the food or services, these were some of his complaints:     We had switched coffee suppliers since his last visit and did nothing to notify him of such (We hadn't switched suppliers, they'd just changed their name). We had reading material available in our bar section, and he felt some of it was too dated (It was all in good shape and regularly updated, but a magazine issue was from a previous month). Both he and his wife has used our washrooms and upon comparing notes it was found the artwork in each washrooms was from a different artist. They weren't allowed wine on the patio. This was a licensing issue and completely out of our control.  (They hadn't ordered alcoholic beverages nor were they sitting on the patio) Our cup of soup and bowl of soup were same volume and different prices. While it was very clear the bowl was bottomless.   Long story short his blog host didn't take kindly to how much he was spamming his site and turfed his account not too long after reviewing us. EDIT: I should mention these were the same kind of complaints he made for every single place he reviewed."

Most restaurants will have a large dishwasher in the kitchen and a small one in the bar, for glasses, coffee cups and such. Instead of buying two large bottles of the stuff they'll buy one and fill some sort of container (empty wine bottle, small water bottle, whatever is around) so they can use it at the bar. This bottle will be left by the bar dishwasher, after that all you need is two idiots: one that things it's a misplaced wine bottle and puts it in the fridge and one that doesn't notice that it's  not a regular wine bottle and serves it to a costumer.

I got dressed and walked all the way back down to the restaurant.  I stood in front of the door and gave it a push.  It opened.  I had fucking left it unlocked.  I went in and did a sweep to make sure there were no street people, etc. then this time I actually locked the door and went home.

""A few more"" turned out to be another 20 people. The owner was doing double duty as a busser and waiter, the waitress was overwhelmed, the chef was pissed, and I had to bounce between the fryers and the dishes as fast as I could, since when they walked in I was still clearing down from dinner service.

KitchenConfidential,39yip8,jimmysixtoes,1 point,Tue Jun 16 02:53:23 2015 UTC,"One of the sister pizzerias I worked at years ago that also sold hot hoagies almost blew up once. So every store has two high broiler ovens.  2 pilot lights per over, so you could use only 1/2 at a time if you wanted.  That was something most people did as a pre close step to be done sooner. The only ""problem"" with this method was remembering to turn off the main gas line at the end of the night.  How someone could forget is beyond me,  they were two very brightly colored handles and it was drilled into me to not forget. Not only that but the manager is supposed to go and check everything before leaving.   Anyway,  this dumbass at the sister store forgot and then the dumbass opener walks in and somehow doesn't smell the gas (that had been leaking at least 10 hours.) Went about her business starting prep, goes to light the broilers....doesn't work,  so she calls someone else who immediately smells the massive amount of gas and calls the authorities. The only reason that entire restaurant didn't turn into a bomb was because there was so much gas in the place there wasn't enough oxygen left to fuel a fire.  Tl; dr: Someone leaves gas on for 10 hours in a locked restaurant. Morning person has no idea, tries to light a broiler,  magically doesn't create bomb.   Oh as an added bonus,  there were probably 500-600 lbs of flour in the kitchen at any time.   Edit: I guess forgot some pretty major details. I made this sound like they were in the restaurant for a long period of time,  probably 2 minutes top, went outside to call coworker who was already scheduled to be there very shortly.  They both received oxygen from the EMTs and the one that was there first ended up being observed at the hospital.  Sorry I wrote from my phone before bed last night. The person that forgot to turn off the gas ended up being fired,  caused the restaurant to be closed for a day and apparently it wasn't the first major fuck up."

What I'm saying is that at the end of the day it's a kitchen and you're a cook.  Plenty of people psyche themselves out and never come back.  Don't worry about keeping up with the staff, do the best job you can do during prep, even if it's slower than you'd like.  During service, try too help where you can, sweep the line when it's dirty, and do whatever you're asked."

KitchenConfidential,39ydo2,nofferty,4,Mon Jun 15 20:47:46 2015 UTC,"Worked at a place where they sold seafood and a ton of it. I worked the position called pots. I had maybe 8 different pots and a steamer for lobster, blue crab, garlic crab, king crab, dungeness , snow crab , mussels , shrimp, etc... We sold all you can eat and by the pound. I would sell tons of this shit and constantly be running to the cooler grabbing cases of this shit. I remember they were like 50lb cases with 2 straps on them, I would slang those cases all night. One night when I was sleep and dreaming about work I jumped up out of bed and grabbed my close basket like a case of crabs and threw that shit.  -They bought in a Claw machine full of lobsters that cost $2 per play and was supposed to give out 1 lobster for every $50 played. It glitched out on a Friday night and gave out a lobster every play until it emptied.  -My KM at the time was talking shit to a homeless guy one night. Homeless guy beat the shit out of him, I mean curb stomped his ass. People were grabbing decorations off the wall and ran outside to fuck up the hobo.  -Some people were working as servers and cooks. They would work 20+ hours as a server and then work 10+ hours in the kitchen Fri/Sat/Sun getting OT on cooks pay."

KitchenConfidential,39ydo2,Salad_Nazi,2,Mon Jun 15 22:04:07 2015 UTC,"My dreams always start with me starting my first shift after some kind of extended absence; either a vacation or an illness. Once I get to work, it's inevitably swamped, and either the menu changed drastically while I was gone, or the set up in the kitchen is completely different than I was used to. I am always in a panic trying to figure everything out.   Once I had a dream that someone ordered an omelet we serve that is made with chicken breast strips. In my dream, I put down sirloin steak tips along with the chicken. Then for some reason, instead of a normal omelet with eggs, I pounded the chicken flat and used it as the ""omelet"" to wrap around the steak tips. I knew it was wrong and sent it out anyway. Of course it came back, and I owned up to the mistake, apologized, and offered to cover the bill. I was shocked to get a bill for over $60.00. I went to talk to my boss about it and had to walk down this long, seemingly endless hallway (nothing like anything I have at my real place of employment) to get to his office. That one was so odd it's stuck with me for years."

I have an old random brand paring knife that I've had since I was a teenager. The tip is broken off but its still handy..not just for opening boxes, plastic wrap or for surfaces that I wouldn't use a ""real"" knife on.. I've use it for peeling beet/tomato/peach skins and cracking oysters. I like it because its small and I can keep it in my sleeve.

The only reason she has that lucrative shift is she's friends with the owner. So she's there one day a week, 10-4.  She treats the entire kitchen as her own personal space; I've found her food in pretty much every cooler in the place (including bar cooler out front where guests can see). She'll wait until we're open, tickets will start coming in, and she'll come back to the grill and start making herself breakfast (it's a tight area, only one person or two REALLY close friends can fit). I've seen her use cook's knives to open packages. Scooping ice out the machine with glass tumblers. Washing out bar fruit in the dish sink where I've just sprayed down my chicken butchery kit. Pretty much all bullshit that doesn't fly in a professional kitchen and in some cases is downright dangerous.  I've patiently and politely called her out on everything I've seen (I'm the sous, it's completely within my job responsibilities to do so) and tried to offer solutions (you're hungry? let me cook something for you so you're not in our way). Need a place for your snacks (even though you're here for a few hours and I just made you a sandwich)? Here's the employee shelf in the walkin. Here is the ice scoop you can use (conveniently attached to the ice bin).   The biggest problem with all of this is she's not just clueless, she's a complete bitch. She's hostile to the guests (only negative Yelp reviews are thanks to her), she's an asshole to the cooks, and she takes up a great space on the schedule all because she and the owner go way back. There's gotta be some history there because on every other matter the owner is completely rational and never shies away from making tough decisions.   She's called off sick the last couple of weeks so she may be firing herself but goddamn. Just a baffling situation.  /endrant"

To be fair I did it sometimes but when the kitchens flying to make your order and your talking about weekend plans and standing around it's aggravating polish some silverware or check on your tables drinks.  Servers think you can just magically make food appear if something's missing or the customer changed there mind.  Fuck no!  It takes time and patience if you want it done properly.  I'm not serving chicken a la salmonella in this bitch, a well done steak is not a 2 min process.    This one goes for both:  people being ridiculous about the ""imaginary line"" kitchen can't go past here/servers can't cross the line.  As a server sometimes I needed something out of the back fridge or something got left back there from FOH. I hate killing time waiting for someone in the kitchen to get me something or asking a server to get pretty much anything.  Now two people are wasting time on the task I could have just done it myself and be done by now.  I know liquor laws, food safety kitchen shouldn't be seen in FOH etc.  but some people take it way to seriously!  Also I've seen it many times, BOH don't be dicks to the new wait staff had a huge asshole of a KM once and it makes it so much worse to learn the ropes.  Eventually I started ignoring him a bunch asked other kitchen staff for things when he was right there.  Didn't care not my boss had no reason to respect or listen to him eventually he either figured it out or my manager who was a good friend and had worked with for years at a different place might have said something cause it was pretty obvious I was going around him in the kitchen.  But also leads to another good point BOH and FOH COMMUNICATE!!!"

KitchenConfidential,39xf7v,Amazonmomma,0,Mon Jun 15 18:21:02 2015 UTC,"Foh here. My boyfriend is Boh. It makes for interesting conversations on the ride home from work! This might be a long read, but it's worth it.  I have more gripes about my co-servers than I do about Boh.  Keep in mind these gripes pertain mainly to newbies, not those of us who have been in this industry for the better part of our lives. They have been told numerous times NOT to do these things. Training is just lost on some people, I guess. In one ear and out the other.   The newbies can't get it through their thick skulls to organize and stack dishes for our dishwasher. Hopefully they'll learn after they've told a million times. Also, Foh- don't walk through the kitchen with your head buried in your cell phone swiping on tinder or playing candy crush. You will get burned or stabbed because you're not paying attention to the Boh guys yelling ""behind!!"" Don't put an order through and immediately run to the kitchen to see if your food has been plated. Yep. It's magic. A well done rib eye can be ready in mere seconds.  Feel free to congregate and yak about what you did the night before in front of the Queen Mary when we're serving a 200+ banquet. The expediter for that function won't mind waiting for you to finish your story. Especially when there's a 3,000 dollar wedding cake sitting in the walk-in that needs to go out at a specific time. As far as staff meals- Boh loves it when you send up a ticket off the kids menu with modifications to the moon and back. During dinner rush. Or at 9:30 at night after a 12 hour day when they're trying to clean up and go home. Suuuure.....  I really have only one gripe about Boh- one of the guys goes behind the bar during busy dinner service to get a pitcher of soda for himself. We've asked him not to do that, our exec chef has too, but he still does. All he has to do is ask a server and he shall receive! That's not a biggie compared to what Foh does to Boh.  Our Boh is fantastic and very patient. We couldn't ask for a better team! They do banquets, off site catering and al la carte. All in one day, all the time! Boh deserves more respect than they really get.  All of you Boh staff- keep up the good work!"
KitchenConfidential,39xf7v,franceinstein,-14,Tue Jun 23 15:04:37 2015 UTC,I hate it when BoH whine about servers making more money. You wanna make more money? Ask management to move you to the front and serve tables you fucking whiny pussies. That's what I did.
KitchenConfidential,39xf7v,ZachZims,8,Mon Jun 15 22:01:47 2015 UTC,"Back of house complain about this because we want to enjoy what we're doing and be passionate about work without having to be paid like someone's little cousin. While I'm not going to get into the argument of ""BoH does waaay more work then FoH"" bullshit mentality, I will say that the pay disparity between the two is a little ridiculous.   My S/O is a server and only has to work 3-4 days a week to clear as much money as I do working 5+. We aren't ""whining pussies"" we are just upset that we barely make livable wages when servers work way less hours and are paid more. And you of all people should have some compassion as you have worked in the BoH."
KitchenConfidential,39xf7v,justaskfrank,8,Tue Jun 16 03:38:45 2015 UTC,"Serving and cooking are both very hard jobs (I've done both), but I have one word for servers. Heat. I live in Arkansas, where a summer day feels like a humid sweltering kitchen anyway. My kitchen is at least 90 degrees F before service even starts. Standing over a fryer or a flattop in those conditions will instantly show you why BoH employees often feel jilted. Servers, no matter how hard they work, do not usually deal with the extreme discomfort that we do. Not to mention the burns. Oh, the burns."

KitchenConfidential,39t9qa,Pheadlessg,6,Sun Jun 14 15:40:59 2015 UTC,"Ran into some people teaching cooking classes for a company in the UK who were having this very issue.   The chefs hadn't been paid in two months They were expected to pay their expenses (ingredients, travel, accommodation, equipment) out of their own pocket, which would be reimbursed three months after submitting their expense claims. Late payment of wages by the company was a regular occurance, to the point that you would not get paid unless you actively refused to carry on working or threatened to leave - at which point your pay would get sent over immediately. Their contracts - though I never personally got to see them - apparently covered fuck all, so payment terms and issues regarding expenses weren't mentioned. The chefs were young and genuinely didn't know any better, even to the point that they didn't talk to each other about it because they thought they were the only ones not being paid.   The system here in the UK is slightly different, but there's a decent (though link free) article in the Guardian about it here. Citizens Advice is also a service which will cost you nothing to use and is set up specifically to help people in situations like this with advice and contacts.  Above all, a change of perspective is needed to avoid situations like this. A job is a two way street. When you sign a contract, you're telling your employer that you'll do a job for them under certain conditions for a certain amount of pay. You're also entering into an agreement with them that you'll sell them your time and skills for money. Just as in every transaction, if they don't keep up their end of the bargain you have legal options open to you to make sure they do pay."
KitchenConfidential,39t9qa,tsukinon,2,Sun Jun 14 18:29:18 2015 UTC,"That's really sad.

KitchenConfidential,39t9qa,matchy_blacks,5,Tue Jun 16 09:35:08 2015 UTC,"If you are in the US and do not have a contract that states otherwise, you can quit with no notice.  (You can also be terminated without notice unless you have a contract that states otherwise.) Because of this, you really can just walk away.  I walked out of a job where I was physically threatened by my cocaine-addled supervisor, for instance.  It remains the only job I've ever left without two weeks notice, but I think it was a solid choice."

The only answer you're going to get to this is to talk to both of your employers and tell them that you have a lot of emotional shit to deal with over this, and that you don't feel like you'll be able to deal with work very effectively until you work this stuff out.  Explain to them that your being at work might be a problem if you won't be able to make it through a shift, or might be screwing things up because your head isn't in the game.      Seriously, one of the biggest problems in our industry is that people don't take care of themselves first.  If you don't watch out for your own mental & emotional well-being, nobody else is going to.  Take care of yourself.    If your bosses want you at 100%, they'll understand.  If your bosses don't care about your emotional health, and only want to make sure that you'll be able to make your shifts, then you need to ask yourself if that's the job environment that you want to be in."

I got a call that my mom was in the hospital after having a stroke. I got off the phone and told chef that my mom was in the hospital and I had to go to Florida immediately. He simply nodded and said ""go."" I spent three days down there taking to doctors. She was stable and there wasn't really anything for me to do at the time so I came back to work. Fast  forward two years. My parents have moved back to our home state, my mom has recovered pretty well from her stroke, and I'm now FoH manager.  I get another call that my mom is in the hospital. This time I stick around for a half hour for the owner to come cover the bar and then drive to the hospital to find out my mom's had an aneurism and is brain dead. As per her wishes I took her off life support and spent the next three days with friends and family processing what just happened. After I felt like I could handle being in public again, I called work to tell them I could be back by the end of the week, and they told me to take more time if I needed.  Some things are more important than work. Take all the time you need. If your employer can't understand that, you need a new job anyway."

I  lost my dad the same day I got a new job months ago. I told my employer what happened when I went into train and he was super understanding and even offered to hold the job for me for a few weeks. So most chefs are pretty awsome when it comes to some serious shit.  For me personally I am grateful to have work during this time. Staying busy is super important and is especially helpful if you love what you do. I had been unemployed for a month and I don't think I would have had the energy to find a new job on my own. But it was hard the first few weeks especially. My job let me work only part time hours for a couple weeks and let me take a week vacation that I had already planned before it all happened.

It does not matter if someone is a man/woman, gay/straight/trans in the work place, they are a cook before anything else. They are there to do their job, so fuck anyone who says something negative. I realize that this is about a FOH, but fuck it, if you aren't there for the guy/girl, who will be?   Edit: so I was pretty drunk when I wrote this. Basically, what I meant was that shit shouldn't fly in a kitchen, let alone any work place. Either tell her to keep her mouth shut about it yourself, or let your chef/km/gm know that there could be problems in the future."

He wrote a good part of the menu, was the only person the chef would listen to - and downright obey - and was as gay as they come.   Lots of gay jokes around him, especially after we met his partner - never anything serious. Even if you had the balls, he was as nice as they come and knew his shit more than anybody else.

In the exact same way that disliking what she said/did is your right.  If you're going to try and say that she doesn't have the right to dislike gay people, then you also don't have the right to dislike the way she feels about gay people.  See how that works?  Not only is disliking anyone that she wants her right, but you actually have no right to tell her that she's not allowed to dislike anyone, because then you become the thought police, and that's even worse.        The thing that you seem to be ignorant of (again, how dare you feel that you have the right to dislike it) is that we live in a world full of different religions, cultures, societies, and beliefs.  Just because someone moves to your country, doesn't mean that they have to check their entire background/culture/religion/beliefs at the door and automatically change everything about what they think so that it comports with your way of thinking so as not to offend you."
KitchenConfidential,39s5rx,bluechef79,11,Sun Jun 14 07:56:58 2015 UTC,"While you are technically correct, it's not illegal to not like gay people, it is very likely that it breaks several laws and workplace policies to harass coworkers over your personal opinions. No HR director or labor board judge in the U.S. is going to side with this kind of behavior based on their first amendment rights. The company would just terminate the employee and settle with the harassed person. You have the right to think what you want, but this kind of stuff would easily be classified as harassment and probably hate speech and get you a one way ticket out the door."

That it is not protected speech in the workplace even if it's technically not illegal. Just because you aren't committing a crime doesn't mean your boss won't take a very dim view of your actions. It isn't illegal to show up late to work either. But do it three or four times next week. My point was, that while they may have the right to dislike gays, they don't have the right to harass them in the workplace. That isn't protected by any law or (I'm guessing) in house work policy."

Boil the fuck out of rice in stock until it looks like oatmeal, season with Asian shit, soy sauce, fish sauce, hoisin sauce, lime juice, garnish with boiled egg, cilantro, scallion, Sriracha, and grilled whatever meat bits you have available to you.  Potatoes, you got enough scrap to grind to make a cottage pie with some mash?  Potato pancakes also ain't a bad route, though they can be pretty time intensive, I'm used to bosses that are willing to pay you for some dick-around time as long as staff meal is bomb.  Curries were another one of my ""slim-pickin"" staple staff meals. A pack of thai green curry paste, some coconut milk, stock, and whatever the fuck else you have, throw it in a pot and simmer, serve over rice. Same could be said for madras or garam masala to make an Indian curry....  I've got a laundry list, I've been the staff meal guy at our place for two years now."

Anyway, basic shit; shepards/cottage (there's a difference, but we don't care down here) pie works. Fine, you're probably bored of mashed spud, but whatever.   Gnocchi isn't that bad to do, if you have a fair bit of potato to use up. Peel, boil, moulie, mix and cook. Then freeze it in batches, bring one or so out a week for staff meals. Granted it takes a little bit of time to make, but if you make a good sized batch, you won't have to do it too often. A slow wednesday sort of thing.   Anything curry related; spices are cheap. If need be, talk to the other cooks and have them throw in $5 to get a stockpile of spices and shit.   I'm guessing dried pasta is shit-cheap up in nyc, can always have some of that.

KitchenConfidential,39s9oq,lechef,1 point,Mon Jun 15 04:17:34 2015 UTC,"Honestly, it's a mix of french and british cuisine. Maybe it's in front of me and I can't see it, but we don't have a ton of things that scream AUSSIE at people.   Meat pies are ""our"" thing, but they're fuckin' british. Most things are. Australia is very multicultural, so our cuisine is a bastardization of everything. Shepards pie perhaps, but that's again from england. Sausages and mash; wait, no, that's english again.   Actually, I'll bring out a cookbook I have lying around; it's about australian cuisine. We'll see what she says.   Much as I was thinking. Definitely have a pavlova going (like, always. If you make fresh pasta (it's worth it!), you'll have spare eggwhites; pavlova and souffle time!.), but aside from that, we lack a definite cuisine.   I guess a beef pie - british, australian, whatever - would fit. Maybe serve some damper for an authentic touch, but be warned that... well, not everybody likes damper. It's something made around a campsite, great with butter and jam, shit on its own.   Maybe some pub food? We go nuts over a good chicken parma, but that lacks an authentic aussie vibe.. I think. Are parmas big overseas? This would be much easier if I'd ever left australia. And if I was sober, I guess.   We also have some decent seafood, plus our capital cities are around the coast; shrimp on the barbie is stupid, but some nice prawns, pan-fried in butter is always good. Bit of pan fried barramundi is popular as fuck down here, but no idea if it's local to aus or not.   Reading the question again (Fine, the alcohol has won).. Definitely go with a 4 course (of sorts) thing to surprise them; a good damper, followed by some sort of entree (just pick one), then a hearty shepards pie (use diced chuck, not mince; always better), finish with a pavlova. Bam, you've showed more aussie cuisine than cooking with 'roo ever will.   But yeah, the cookbook isn't that helpful. It's a bastardized cuisine, true dishes.. I couldn't tell them if I saw them. And yes, you really need to read every paragraph. I'm too drunk to have a reasonable tl;dr up, sorry."

Say you were running the kitchen at an independent place and a cook mouthed off? Send him out the door with his ears still ringing. Corporate requires coaching, verbals, write ups. And God help you if you ""verbally abuse"" or ""belittle"" the loser. Then you can't get rid of the sucker. Unless you want to pay compensation. But you just have to learn to make the processes work in your favor. They are literally designed so that you cannot fail if you follow them (theoretically).

I can not tell you how many times I've been infuriated in my life that they don't push the idea of weighing your ingredients (at least for baking) and for that matter, that every recipe book you can find on a normal shelf lists EVERYFUCKINGTHING by cups, regardless of whether it should be measured in volume or not. Alton Brown is the only saving grace."

KitchenConfidential,39p1w7,Lian_Yu,8,Sat Jun 13 11:05:20 2015 UTC,"@3x cost is a starting point. Some items you may make less on because you look at the item, look at what your cost is and then look at what people will actually pay  for it.  Example: My cookies cost between $.06 and $.11 per cookie to make. So if I take the higher amount, I get $.33 a cookie. McDonald's sells cookies the same size as what I make 3  for $1. I know I can get more for mine because I make mine with good ingredients.  I sell mine for$.80 per cookie ($.75 each if you buy more than one).   Cheesecake, on the other hand, my food cost is about 40% on it.   You just have to figure out what someone would reasonably pay for your items without losing money on them."
KitchenConfidential,39p1w7,Jadenlost,9,Sat Jun 13 12:49:21 2015 UTC,"Food Cost percentage of 33%.  Cost out the ingredients of a single menu item including its sides and sauce.  When these are totaled multiply by three or divide by .33.  This will give you an idea of how to price so that you break even.  The dish will not make any real profit but allows you to see what the price ""looks"" like.  From there, you have to factor in several considerations: what type of food service, quality of ingredients, target demographic of customers, and how much of a pricing increase will your customers be willing to pay for the item."
KitchenConfidential,39p1w7,looki_chuck,3,Sat Jun 13 11:42:19 2015 UTC,"There's more to it than just ""multiply cost by 3"" but that's a good start. The steakhouse I ran had an overall food cost of 38% with some menu items being as high as 45%(porterhouse steak with a menu price of $30). To offset that we had cheese fries at 18%. I'd rather sell porterhouses all day long and make $16 per plate than our 28% burgers making $4 per plate.   The real question is,  what is your overall food cost? Are you making money? Who is your broadline distributor, they often have programs in their laptops that can do a lot of the grunt work for you. What's your average menu price? Are you a scratch kitchen?"
KitchenConfidential,39p1w7,darkrzane,1 point,Sat Jun 13 12:15:33 2015 UTC,A low food cost percentage number doesnt matter as much though at a more expensive restaurant because a cheap and expensive steak can have the same overhead and labor costs but a higher sale price for one will end up making more money.

KitchenConfidential,39p1w7,darkrzane,2,Sun Jun 14 01:01:07 2015 UTC,"You price based on the market. You cost out your items to ensure there's room for profit, or to make other decisions.

Also, between inventory, spot check crucial items like proteins and booze and all the things you suspect may sneak out the door. I've found that being transparent without being accusatory works best. I don't want to treat my employees like criminals but I want them to know that I have multiple ways of spotting theft. Have stringent policies for employee food and stick to the rules you make.

Catering a special event is the place, for me, where my skills made the most difference in peoples lives: This is where you get satisfaction you will never feel slinging out plates on the line. You will see people enjoying your food, and it sounds ridiculous but it's incredibly satisfying.  It's also easier than you think.  A few tips:   Lots of clean towels, and a place hidden from view where any mess can be shuffled easily.  Cleanliness!!!! It can be more difficult to be food safe on a site, do NOT take food safety risks.  Chat with guests but remain utterly professional. Do not be surprised if you are hit on, it happened to me quite often.  Do not drink. You are there to work, not to party. An exception is that you may be asked by the host to join them in a glass of something, if you are, follow your chef's lead.  It's a big deal, usually, to be asked to do these events. It's usually a stepping stone in a career. Be mindful of that, and seize this opportunity."

However, it's much easier to fit more if you put like with like (e.g. Green lids shelf 1, red lids shelf 2, blue lids shelf 3).

It effects your food cost indirectly, over no fault of your own. If there isn't money flowing in for product flowing out, the cost suffers.   (Starting inventory-ending inventory)/sales=cost.    Edit: I got downvoted, so now I'm a bit annoyed at the basic lack of understanding for simple economics.  Think of a restaurant as a car wash. The cooks make the soap, and the FOH takes money for it. Sometimes cooks steal some soap; and sometimes FOH steals money. Either way the overall business suffers. Our shorthand phrase for this, as a percentage, is called cost.    In this instance, I thought It was obvious that the problem with cost was cash not coming in, not soap being stolen."

KitchenConfidential,39hiv0,Lian_Yu,2,Thu Jun 11 19:24:31 2015 UTC,"I think the deal is pretty good in terms of value, but not in terms of utility. Unless you have some pretty godaweful chips to grind out, a 240 grit stone is not important. 240 is super coarse. About the only time I'd use that is to take the back down and reshape a knife after the tip was broken off, but I'd still prefer to use an electric pedestal grinder for that.  The ceramic rod doesn't offer much utility that isn't already covered by the 5000 stone. I don't use a classic steel on my knives because they're too brittle to be steeled and I have no interest in running a round abrasive rod down the sides when my stones offer so much more useable area to cut faster and grind off a burr.  Seems to me that of the three items offered, too much utility is overlapping and some of the features are not very useful. Price is good, but utility isn't there.  I like the King combo stone suggested by /u/srideout. That King combo 1k/6k combo stone is economical and will do most of your sharpening needs. It may take time to grind out a bad nick, but if you're good with your knives you shouldn't get them. 1k is a bit of a jump to 6k, but it isn't too unreasonably large a jump. It'll take a bit longer than having a grade between, but there aren't too many knives you really need to take to 6k. I have bought that stone several times for culinary industry friends who have been shit at maintaining their knives.  Paring knives, petty knives, don't really have to be taken to 6k. They'll do very well at 1k if the steel is good. I do like a very fine hone on a chef's knife though.   The King stone is a bit on the soft side. This is a positive and a negative. On the downside, a soft stone wears more quickly. On the upside, a soft stone cuts faster because it exposes fresh particles readily and is less prone to clogging or glazing.   Skip this if you're not interested in metal work. I am running on a tangent because I have more experience in metal work than shoemaking.  The mechanics of grinding are such that a grinding surface presents a randomized array of particles with edges. Some particles will be ideally oriented to shave off a tiny bit of steel from your knife. Some particles will be badly oriented to do the job. Particles which are badly oriented will get eventually broken away which presents well oriented particles to do some cutting. Eventually the well oriented particles wear down and their edges round (glazing) until they themselves get broken away.   The wear on a stone presents new cutting surface to do work so there is a fine balancing act in how one formulates a grinding stone (if it is a synthetic stone). Fast wearing stones do their work quickly but they will saddle out more quickly. They can also be comprised of particles that break down so a 1000 stone can do some polishing up to say 3000 with the broken up slurry it develops if the particles aren't too strong. A very well bonded stone will release particles very slowly and will be prone to glazing over or getting clogged with swarf. They stay flat for a long time, but they don't do work very fast. In a very bad case, an overly well bonded stone will refresh it's surface so slowly that all you have is worn edges and badly oriented particles and all you have is a friction wheel. In electrically powered rotary surface grinding you blaze away this surface with a diamond tipped wheel dresser which grazes this surface away to present a new open surface which has some fresh particles to cut with.   My impression is that cooks/chefs should get softer faster cutting stones because they sharpen quickly and a relatively low rate of sharpening is being done because reasonably good quality knives would be maintained. A stone may saddle out, but it'll take quite a long time and the issue can be repaired with a fixer stone. I like to cheat and use the 400 grit side of a diamond bench stone to true my whetstones, but I think I almost never have to do that. I prefer whetstones to diamond generally. I have a few diamond stones which have glazed over. A glazed over diamond stone is dead, but a saddled out whetstone is repairable."

KitchenConfidential,39hiv0,RebelWithoutAClue,1 point,Sat Jun 13 11:08:37 2015 UTC,"I've been a fan of zknives.com. There aren't many places with knife reviews from an individual who has seen a lot of, and sharpened, different knives. There isn't anything there on making knives, but there is heaps to read on sharpening. Zknives goes well past the point of diminishing returns in knife sharpening, but it's worth going that far if you can afford the sharpening stones just to see how sharp you can make something.   I used to sharpen my knives a lot. I've got stones up to 13,000mesh and sub micron stropping compound. At some point I found myself noticing as soon as my edges got less than ultimate sharp and honestly it got distracting. In my experience, the sharpest possible edges get diminishingly less durable. It's not that they get impractically dull rapidly. The properties of the sharpest possible edge that can be represented by your material grain structure are less durable than the what you can get with less extreme edges. A sub micron edge is a beautiful thing, but it loses that extreme keeness fairly quickly and degrades into a very good serviceable edge which is a condition which lasts a reasonably long time.  I guess what I am trying to get at is that I kept frequently sharpening things and got extremely good edges, but it wasn't making my food taste any better.   I really like that I can keep my knives in very good shape, but I try not to let me get distracted by the imperfections of my tools and focus on my preparations."

KitchenConfidential,39bedi,link5057,2,Thu Jun 11 00:40:11 2015 UTC,"Maybe... You know how you can tell the difference between a hot plate and a cool one? You can't. Don't try to grab it without feeling it. When I did shop stuff they told us to use the back of our hands (hold your hand upside-down above something, or with the back of your hand facing it) because it's apparently the most sensitive to heat. A few decently-hot pieces of metal will cure you of a grabbing habit very quickly, hopefully before you grab something that's actually hot."
KitchenConfidential,39bedi,bitshoptyler,3,Thu Jun 11 00:55:51 2015 UTC,"Haha, I've been here awhile so burning myself is either regular or avoidable. Somehow it remains to be both, huh..

KitchenConfidential,39bedi,bizkitmaker13,2,Thu Jun 11 01:00:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's very useful, and some things get so hot that tapping it no longer works (though in a kitchen things don't generally get that hot, so it's what I tend to do if I'm in a rush, it takes a bit of time to feel the heat off of something that's not super hot.)"

My fingers were cut, my nuts, a sandpaper sack, glued to my thigh, like gum to a brick wall.      Suddenly, my Chef appeared in the doorway, a wicked gleam in his eye. Brandishing an oven mitt, he pointed his giant two fingered hand at me, as if he were accusing me of taking the virginity of his daughter, and asked, ""Why...so....SERIOUS?!"", as he pressed the searing hot gravy dish to my forearm.      I screamed in pain, but knew that it meant nothing to the man, as he strode back into the depths of hell from which he came.      Still I wear this smile of mine, to this day, because even when I am beat to shit, it's 10 minutes to close, and a party of 15 walks in, I am still smiling!"

Could potentially get your foot in the door at a few places cleaning veg, peeling garlic, picking herbs, plating a few salads, learning the basics and how to act and move in a kitchen etc. See if you enjoy the hours and atmosphere of a professional kitchen before you commit the money to school, it is much different then cooking at home. You would be paid. Depending on your city much of the west coast (Except Portland) desperately needs cooks. Aim high, get a prep cook job or any other and don't expect to make a lot, you will be a bitch, get faster  and cleaner at everything little thing you do, and don't expect people to hold you hand, you can learn a ton in 10 weeks, and if it works out you might get paid to learn instead of the other way around."
KitchenConfidential,39djeb,beardedrugby,1 point,Thu Jun 11 10:28:54 2015 UTC,"Not sure how popular of an opinion this'll be around here, but I'd say to apply for a prep position at a corporate place.  As far as kitchen work goes, it's a really easy job.  You can get a feel for what it feels like to work in a kitchen, and actually handle food(even if you don't do much cooking) as opposed to just cleaning it off plates in the dish pit.  It's also super easy to get into, at least around here.  We get applications all the time, but they're all for FOH.  BOH is always looking for new people.  I got called in for an interview within 12 hours of putting my application in.  Also the pay is usually pretty decent compared to other entry level jobs that don't require education.  Go there, learn what you can, and move on when it's not right for you anymore."
KitchenConfidential,39djeb,confitqueso,1 point,Thu Jun 11 15:40:01 2015 UTC,"Unless you already have professional experience and/or training cooking, it's tough to get your foot in the door in that position. I think the ""traditional"" entry level position is dishwasher, though bussers and servers can transition to kitchen sometimes too. Usually about 8 weeks is when they'll start letting you do cold prep in between your dish work. A couple months of doing a good job on that, then you get to add some hot prep. A couple months of that and then you might get to start joining the line in some capacity. The better you perform, the faster you can move up but you gotta pay your dues and show your worth first."

These were pretty fancy schmancy fryers, with self-filtration, oh my god, cleaning these things was a dream. They were powerful too.... They all had alarm beepers on them if you tried draining them while they were still on... Except unit #5.  It's nearing the end of the night, it's just me on tickets, closing, and dish. So I start to filter the fryers after close. I turn off unit #5, and get a ticket, I cook and sell that ticket. Forget I turned off unit #5, turn it back on, and drain it, and walk away to start the next load of dishes. Turn around to an inferno.  Drop about 3 boxes of salt on it, a bunch of towels, and cover the thing with sheet trays praying to god it goes out.  It did, it was a bitch to clean up, but when I told the boss about it, it was pretty much, ""No harm, no foul.""  Only harm done was in the seat of my underwear.

Then, some months later, for some reason unknown to me, Chef decided that we needed two during busy dinner services. So the next day, we filled up and turned on both fryers.   Unbeknownst to us, and quite regrettably, it had been the habit of the person working the station manning the fryer to store the spider for the fryer in use in the exhaust vent of the unused fryer... Okay... So within a few minutes the previously dormant fryer had a two-foot jet of fire shooting out of its exhaust hood, and within thirty seconds, the Exec Sous (RIP) put it out with a fire extinguisher.

If they are trying a new menu item, lots of times they will just bring it out to get our opinion on it. Granny doesn't get out much these days, but when we take her out she tips well.  About half of the people who eat at that spot are regulars like us and usually the newly hired waiters will catch on that a lot of us already know each other. As we walk to the table everyone greets us by name and its a very casual atmosphere.   I hate it when a new waiter is super formal and nice to us. It makes me feel uncomfortable, kind of like when my grand dad got a new girlfriend and she tried to play host to us when we came to visit."
KitchenConfidential,399l4l,babygblue,11,Wed Jun 10 06:17:44 2015 UTC,Waste and repairs. Even after construction is completed there are going to be expenses for repairs that are going to run in the thousands each time. Its certainly different on new construction vs a retrofit but they'll be there and they will be far more costly than expected.   Waste/loss in the form of paper products and food is always costly and hard to track and account for.   Projecting costs is going to be murky until you have a few months/quarters worth of data though.
KitchenConfidential,399l4l,Pilfered,3,Wed Jun 10 09:45:09 2015 UTC,"Seconding repairs here, at least until you find the rhythm of things breaking the costs can really sneak up on you, and they can really add up.   Try and find good tradies and repairmen before things start breaking and always keep an eye out for replacement equipment and components at auction if you can afford to and have the storage space"
KitchenConfidential,399l4l,fishboy1,5,Wed Jun 10 10:02:05 2015 UTC,I think the best thing I did was to find a local handy man to help the restaurant out.

Not sure why, but I started calling side Caesars ""sneezers.""  Also, when someone wants a regular full-sized house salad with no modifications, we call it out to the salad station as a ""Bob Saget"" (full-sized house > Full House > Bob Saget).   If someone wants a full-sized house salad with no croutons (the most common modification to our house salad) we call it out as a ""Dave Coulier."" Not really sure why we picked him. I think it's just because he was just someone else on Full House, but he's not really the first guy you think of when you think about Full House. He's not even really the second guy. John Stamos is #2 most of the time. But I digress.  A full-sized house salad with chicken (our most common protein add-on to any of our salads) is an ""Aunt Becky"" (chicken breast > tits > Lori Loughlin is the only adult female major character on Full House).  And, of course, a Greek salad is an ""Uncle Jesse."" A Greek salad with ballsack (balsamic vinaigrette), the most common dressing ordered with a Greek salad, is ""Uncle Jesse, watch the hair.""  We used to say ""fuck the commies"" instead of ""no tomatoes"" since tomatoes are red, but we had to stop because someone sitting at the end of the bar closest to the kitchen heard us one time when the door to the kitchen opened as a server was leaving it. Of course he left his sense of humor at home, so he complained about it.  I'm a Buffalo sports fan, but I live in New England (where everyone around me are Boston fans), so during football season and the hockey regular season the EC, who is a Pats and Bruins fan, would say ""sad"" instead of ""Buffalo"" if I was on the line. ""From you I need 3 sad chicken wrap setups, 36 wings all day, 12 barbecue, 12 sad, 12 wicked sad, hit it"" where wicked sad means Death Sauce, our extra hot Buffalo-style wing sauce.

KitchenConfidential,395esh,CupBeEmpty,3,Tue Jun 9 16:55:05 2015 UTC,"As others have said it's great for ballotines/roulades. It's also quite handy if you're working with cuts of meat that have tendons/connective tissue running through them that need to be removed prior to cooking - say a flat iron or hanger steak. You can remove the tendon and then reassemble the meat for a larger portion. There's other varieties that are handy for things other than meat as well - for example Activa YG works really well with dairy products, say if you want to make a cheese gnudi and want to give it a little help holding it's shape - just sprinkle a bit in with the mix and it'll set it up nice. Should you want to make a caseless sausage well... Activa is the answer there as well.  It's also pretty rad for holding together terrines - one of the places I worked did a duck confit terrine for example, made in a fairly traditional way but with a little Activa mixed in to the liquid to set and hold the terrine together. We also would then glue the duck skin back on top of the terrine and portion. When it was cooked you'd get a nice little square of duck confit with crispy duck skin on top - delicious and pretty much impossible to do in a way that would hold together without Activa."

KitchenConfidential,398tdp,bryanodoule,8,Fri Jun 12 09:33:20 2015 UTC,Most of the people you're wondering about are working at a restaurant or bar. The ones not in the service industry are at dives or under the radar ethic joints. The millennial generation isnt filling up fine dining places at 7 on a Friday. My late 20s non restaurant friends are going to the shitty local places and douching up tap rooms instead of dropping $40/plate.
KitchenConfidential,398tdp,revzblove,3,Wed Jun 10 04:02:17 2015 UTC,"Maybe it is also when you are eating, not just where? There's always tons of young people going out for brunch. They go for the food, they want to try something special, And it's relatively cheap ($15 maximum). It's a dining experience where a good Bloody Mary is a bonus. Going out at night seems to be more about getting drinks, and maybe eat something. Going ""out to dinner"" is a special occasion because it can be expensive ($15 minimum)."
KitchenConfidential,398tdp,trellala,2,Wed Jun 10 03:10:10 2015 UTC,Most of the people I talk to eat at Applebee's or buffalo wild wings.  Personally I'll drive the hour out of town to get good food rather than shit.  I live in a cheap area where most places avg 10$ and we avg 100 or so when me and my girlfriend go out (not counting drinks).  I think a lot of people around here just have no idea what the hell good food is or should be young or old.
KitchenConfidential,398tdp,lethaltech,2,Wed Jun 10 12:54:48 2015 UTC,"I recently turned 29 and I agree with a lot of the other posts on here- lots go to the generic places like Applebees, Buffalo Wild Wings, Bonefish Grill, etc (the wife and I go to places like these when we are hanging out with other friends, otherwise, we try and pick better places to eat at (we don't eat out as often, but when we do we like it to be worthwhile and an experience in itself).

I posted it to give an idea as to my ""enthusiastic"" take on food and why for me ""eating out"" is more than Buffalo Wild Wings and other places as discussed.   In regards to eating out in my area, its quite exciting lately as the Philly scene over the past couple of years has been picking up the slack. You do tend to see a lot more of the younger crowd gravitate to your older pubs/bars and places as such- don't get me wrong I can always go for a good ale, but most of those places the food is to be desired."
KitchenConfidential,398tdp,sochac,2,Thu Jun 11 02:20:21 2015 UTC,"I feel the same; I usually end up in subway/chipotle/some other fast-casual because I don't feel like cooking on my day off.  Other days I want to cook something SO much better than what I cook at work, and pull out all the stops.  There's not a lot of middle-ground dining options for me in suburbia, so if I want something nice I'll have to do it myself."
KitchenConfidential,398tdp,daschande,2,Thu Jun 11 02:29:30 2015 UTC,"I'm 21. My friends and I are all pretty broke. When we go out to eat we go in a group of six or seven to Denny's, usually around midnight, and share like four Grand Slams and a bottomless pancake stack. If it's not Denny's it's the cheapest Mexican we can find. I have only have one friend I'd call a foodie, who likes to find unique and/or shady ethnic restaurants."
KitchenConfidential,398tdp,thelaughingpear,2,Wed Jun 10 15:32:35 2015 UTC,"I work FOH, at a mid-priced bakery. Most of the young people my age, around 20, tend to go for the trendy french macaron (which in my opinion is inferior to a good financier). They tend to have money, but a notoriously cheap relative to older customers, who I must say are some of the nicest people. AND when they're eating in, they order like 1 tiny thing for 4 people and take up a table or two for like 2 hours; mind you I only have like 5 tables because we are small.   With regards to eating out with friends, I'm a college student, so pretty broke but I don't mind shelling out money for good food. Other college students don't feel the same way and will try to get what's cheapest and gives you the most food, value (utility if you wanna go there). They see casual dining or fine dining as extremely expensive and not worth it, I tend to disagree, but eating alone at these places can be hard. If you get foodies from my generation, it has to be innovative, good, instagram-worthy and most importantly affordable. But sometimes creativity and quality don't necessary come cheap, so...  I hate my generation.  Edit: I should mention that anything above $10-12 dollars an entree/meal is considered pricey."
KitchenConfidential,398tdp,lolpiplup,1 point,Wed Jun 10 17:14:45 2015 UTC,"Oh wow, the young people that you've mentioned seem terrible in regards to their cheapness, especially if they have the cash. I understand that money can be tight for young people but 4 people for one plate: that's beyond inconsiderate. Yeah, sorry if had come off as bashing on older people as I was just criticizing a small niche as there are always bad apples since older people are the ones that frequent these nice places.   But yeah, most young people don't understand that there's a premium for delicious foods that increase exponentially on the taste scale which is why they're ignorant of why people like myself would pay more (and not much vs clothes that younger people would rather buy).  Although I'm not a sweets/dessert person, I now want to try a financier. Even though macarons are amazing and I know it's just my opinion, I'm amazed in disbelief of how young people form lines for macarons."
KitchenConfidential,398tdp,lolpiplup,1 point,Sat Jun 13 01:44:16 2015 UTC,"I completely understand. My time on the job has made me slightly cynical... I wish it weren't so, but every day people come in and expect to be amazed and blown away but balk at a $6 dessert. Makes me shake my head every time. I think the idea of cheap and amazing hole-in-the-walls has taken away from the appeal of elevated, more complex foods. Not to say either one is better or worse, just two sides of a spectrum.  With regards to the financier, they're fantastically simple and deceptively easy to make. When you have leftover whites from making pastry cream or something, you can use them in financiers. If you're going savory, a favorite is always pistachio and saffron, rose honey for sweetness. Caneles also need to make a comeback..."

Look at Pizza Hut's recent back-pedaling on their last restructure.  They are doing it all over again, without the last round of millenial marketing.  Frankly, you should skip worrying about the demo without the dollars.  Focus on your money, and let the rest settle itself out.

Just park on the side of the road and grab it. There's enough that no one gives a shit.

And I guarantee the couple never took a sip of the drink. When they saw the floating specimen they knew they had hit the jackpot. This case is worth hundreds of thousands because of the bad publicity it will cost Chili's. Chili's will settle fast for big bucks with an agreement by the couple to shut up about the incident.

KitchenConfidential,395c2n,Haki23,12,Thu Jun 11 22:54:45 2015 UTC,"I used to cook up all the pasta ahead of time. It was kept in tubs in the walk-in. For each night, we had several pots of hot water on the stove. Orders of pasta were put into these colander pots and dropped into the water for 30 seconds or so, drained, and then added to the heating pasta sauce in the pan. Toss, top with more sauce,  dress and serve."

One kitchen I worked in had what I'd describe as deep fryers, instead filled with water that is pumped in and heated.   Of course under cook the pasta slightly and cool with cold water/ice bath.

I think cooks like to relive their good times in the kitchen because it's often the only thing that doesn't suck about the restaurant industry. Drinking beers atop a mountain of broken down cardboard boxes with the cooks and the dishwashers and bullshitting until 2am was fun. Showing up to get ready for dinner service at 10am only to find that the walk-in wasn't cool enough and the bread dough had gone buckwild all over the damn place was not. Nor was working 60 hours a week with no OT, almost being horribly maimed like 9 times, being screamed at by a talentless alcoholic ""chef"", being tired constantly, watching fucking yuppies and hipsters pretend they could do your job on 20 different TV channels, making  pitifully low wages, or - worst of all - anything related to motherfucking mother's day brunch."

Electric motors have a ""duty cycle"" rating such as: 10 min on, 10 min off. A lot of robocoupes have only a 5 minute duty cycle, which means if you use it for longer than 5 minutes at a time, it can overheat. The best rating is ""continuous"".   Also the higher torque the motor puts out, the better. Although that usually isn't listed, even on commercial equipment."
KitchenConfidential,3928gr,master_blast3r,3,Mon Jun 8 19:38:21 2015 UTC,On a slightly different note a better known (like Robot Coupe) manufacture will be much easier to get replacement parts for in the future ... Those off brands seem cheap till something breaks (or you want new/different attchments) and there's nothing to be found and you end up buying a whole new one.. Parts and service availability are something you should take into account whenever buying machines.

I was looking for more from a practical usage point of view. Like which one is easier for large heads of cabbage. Or ""the other one does nothing for hard cheeses"", etc.  I'll be sure to get one which is rated higher than my current duty cycle. I know better than to cheap out on specs. :)  Thanks again."
KitchenConfidential,3928gr,milo_alexander,4,Mon Jun 8 20:26:50 2015 UTC,"That much cabbage and especially that much cheese would be hard on a robo-coupe and Im not sure a off brand would last more than 6 months.   I go through 300-500 kg shredded cabbage a week and a good amount of cheese, I use to use a attachment for my stand up mixer but the best decision i mad was sitting down with my produce supplier and negotiated a fair price for them to do my cabbage. Honestly its a bit more in food cost but i save so much in labor and  they have a superior product thanks to industrial shredders."
KitchenConfidential,3928gr,jay--dub,1 point,Mon Jun 8 22:46:17 2015 UTC,"That's a really good point. I did buy some shredded cabbage from a produce supplier a long time ago, but it was too thin and didn't last in the cooler for more than a day.   I'm in the Czech Republic and options are at a minimum. Delivery frequency is even more seldom.   It's possible that that company has grown a little and they would be willing to work with me and my specifications.   So, if I rule out the cabbage, what would you recommend if we do, say, up to 5 kg of cheese a day? Or 10 kg every other day?  Thanks for the reply."

I will be investing in a stand mixer in the near future so, maybe I should look at something just to tide me over for now or, more likely the robot coupe, so I could use it as a normal food processor for whatever else down the road.   How is that thing with cabbage, though? Never did vegetables with it, but I remember shredded cheese flying around if we didn't skirt it sometimes."

KitchenConfidential,3928gr,gzilla57,1 point,Tue Jun 9 14:59:27 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply.  Your RG-100 is something similar to the second picture I posted, it's a Bartscher (kind of a cheapy, entry-level brand) dedicated cutter/shredder.  The RG-100 is just a little over my price range, but if that's the model you had and you say it's a tank, I'd spring for it.  I found a listing for a 240V and a 400V model, but all the other specs are the same. Do you know if that's just for convenience or is there a benefit to the 400V model?  Thanks again."
KitchenConfidential,3928gr,Cyno01,2,Tue Jun 9 18:18:32 2015 UTC,"The 400v model is a heavier motor with longer operating time between cool downs and longer expected life span.  I put 5 years on the RG-100 with zero break downs.  Shredded twenty pounds of cheese, cut fifty pounds of potatoes, daily.  Plus kept the place in coleslaw which was three times a week cuttings.  Keep it clean and don't let the FNG's stick a spoon or hand in there.  For a seriously big place, I'd get the heavy duty model, but the 100 is pretty solid for the average user.  Hope this helps and you find something that meets your needs!"

Do not (and this is just hypothetical) thin out a cream cheese mixture and add carageenan and methylcellulose in an attempt to create an aerated cheesecake. You will not be able to get it thin enough to expel the mixture properly. You will then scrap the idea and attempt to expel all the NO2 out of the canister, which will seem like it's all out. You may then try to remove the top, which will be very tight, mind you, and in doing so, cause the lid to explode upwards with enough velocity to put a dent in the ceiling. What will happen to the contents of the canister, you ask? Well, they'll end up all over you, the sink, the ceiling, and just about everything else in a 12ft radius.  I'm just sayin."

Ive been doing this about 6 months now, and along with quitting alcohol, lost 40lbs. of fat. I look better now than I ever have in my life. Some of the things I found really important to me keeping up with this lifestyle:  I had to start eating breakfast. I used to be hungover most of the time, and if I wasn't, I still just wanted coffee and cigarettes. I hate big meals early in the day, though I do love breakfast food. I found that if I didn't start eating early, my vitamins made me feel sick, and I would eat shitty food when I started to crash after setting up my station. So before I leave for work, I have a protein shake, black coffee, a banana or an apple, a few pieces of bacon, or sausage or whatever I have kicking in the fridge, and 3 hard boiled eggs.  I like to workout after work, not before, because it gives me maximum recovery time. I squat every other day and it just sucks no matter what.  I have like 3 or 4 snack ideas going at work. Quick things to eat when I need energy that I know aren't garbage.  I found that i need to eat some shitty carbs from time to time just to get through the shift and be able to work out later that night, so I set a hard cutoff time. after 7PM i will refuse all carbs, no matter what. At 9PM I stop with the caffiene.  I try to avoid cardio for the most part, as I get plenty of it day to day.  My freezer at home is stocked with proteins and bagged frozen veggies. Bell pepper/onion combo is where its at. I buy in bulk from the managers special and freeze. When I get a day off I usually make a big batch of soup or a crockpot meal, and store half in the freezer.   Finally I set a hard cutoff for myself of 2:30am bedtime. Every day. If I work out that gives me plenty of time to cook my final dinner. If I go out I can basically stay with everyone til last call.   Anyway, good luck man, it can be done!"

If you love it and don't want to leave it, I would recommend redirecting your focus to business management instead of starting over from scratch at something completely different and being absolutely miserable. I know CIA has business programs, talk to your advisor and try to work it out. If needs be you can transfer to a more general college/university to get your business degree, but you can still keep restaurants as your focus."

Many of them (at least here in Virginia) have entrepreneur and business management degrees and certificates. There are some programs through the culinary school that specifically deal with becoming a buyer/vendor (for companies like Sysco) or hospitality management if you want to stay tangentially involved in restaurants/food service.   I personally went a completely different path as far away from the industry as I could. You sound like you're a bit younger though so there may be other directions you could go.    Either way, community college is a great way to explore what you want to do and then transfer to a 4-year school if that's what you choose to do."

I interviewed for the sister restaurant and they wanted me to work for free for at least two to three weeks. I know someone who did that and then was only offered minimum wage even though she had many years of experience. The people who own and run these restaurants are multi millionaires and I just think it's kind of shitty. People do it because it looks good on a resume to have worked there.   I have to say that the market in Austin has become competitive for cooks recently. I was checking out Poached and ran across an ad for a line position at Uchi and it sounded like they've added lots of perks like a knife allowance and stuff like that. Pay in general is going up here because so many hotels and restaurants are opening. A few years ago it was really hard to get a good job cooking because there are like 4 different culinary schools here!   EDIT:  I got some feedback that I'm wrong about my understanding of the way the Uchi and sister restaurants are run. I'm glad I'm wrong! I'm glad that people are loving their jobs there and learning a lot! I don't want to contribute to the negativity that I often find in this sub. Are we all that miserable in this industry? What are we doing with our lives?!? (Sobs uncontrollably...)"
KitchenConfidential,38xsqo,girlfighter,7,Sun Jun 7 23:32:55 2015 UTC,"Not true of the externs/stages/etc. While the pay isn't what I would say as 'top grade', for perspective I've worked at 3 Michelin star restaurants for $9/hr, so theres that. We have knife programs, a stage program, and every 6 months at your review you can get a raise."

That's why I said ""supposedly"" because of course all I have to go on is a combination of rumor and my own experience. I was, in fact, asked to stage for a couple of weeks at Uchiko. I turned it down. I have respect for the reputation those restaurants have, for sure, I just couldn't work for free for two or three weeks."

It's actually amazing how much cooking doesn't go on in an Applebee's kitchen. Even the burgers, they have 2 stages. pink or no pink. A 6 year old could settle the done-ness of an Applebee's burger given 10 minutes of training.  Literally the only thing that takes any actual finesse is the grill station, because at least the steaks get cooked to a specific doneness. And yeah, knowing how to make a mid rare steak is hardly rocket surgery."

I'd put a puck of romaine on an 8 inch round (Cut the root off, then take a 2 inch rouch from the base...Still with me? it gets worse).   We'd then make a circle of dressing around the rim, and then sprinkle capers (not in the dressing, just there for shits and giggles).   After that we'd take a 4 inch round parm cookie, and place it on top of the the stupid puck of romaine; then we'd toss chiffonade romaine with dressing, and put it on top of the cookie. Then on top of that shit, we'd put a whole unseasoned anchovy dredged in salt.  Shit, was horrible, but it sold more than anything. It stood at around 6 inches once done, and was super unstable. Waiters would always top it over, and we'd have to make it again. I'd kill for some romaine in a cup compared to that monstrosity."

KitchenConfidential,38zupy,bikersquid,6,Mon Jun 8 23:51:35 2015 UTC,"I've worked in a lot of NYC kitchens and this is basically how it goes.  ""Four covers, table 35.  On order: two duck, one lamb, one branzino.  Fire: one beet salad, two razor clams, sunchoke soup.""  Or if they ordered a tasting menu:  ""Four covers, table 35.  Tasting menu, fire first course.""  For tasting menus, fire tickets for each course are automatically printed every ten minutes between courses unless the server places a hold or a rush.   For regular tickets, the server will put in a fire ticket just before apps are cleared from the table.   Anytime it makes sense for me to give GarMo and Hot Apps an all day, I do that.   With entremet, fish, and meat roast, I'm constantly communicating to them what they have left on order, which tables have mains fired, and which tables we are picking up right now.   For example:  ""Right now you're bringing me table 7, two venison and a salmon. Next you're bringing me table 15, one pork, one cavatelli, one lobster.   Tables 33, 22, and 28 are fired. 35 and 12 are on order.   All day you're working four duck, three veno, two lobster, two cavatelli, three pork, two branzino, two salmon, and two lamb.""  ""OUI!""  Generally, meat roast will fire proteins as soon as a ticket is ""on-order"". It will be cooked slightly under the ordered temp and allowed to rest until the ticket is fired. Once the table is fired, fish and entremet will fire their components and meat roast will finish the protein and bring it back up to temp. It'll rest a bit more while the plates are being assembled, and as soon as everyone is ready to go, the meat is sliced and plated. Plates are put up to the pass, they're garnished, wiped, and then the runners go.  Pastry, they just kind of hang out all night and occasionally plate a dessert.  It's like this all night, every night."

KitchenConfidential,38zupy,MylesMDT,5,Tue Jun 9 02:27:46 2015 UTC,"We aren't pretending to be French and we aren't trying to be pretentious. It's super common in many of the top kitchens in NYC (you'd really be surprised - in some kitchens I've personally worked in, it was required).   Honestly, I felt the same way you did at first, but now I really like it. The idea is that it's a throwback to the classic French brigade system. It's a tip of the hat, a nod of the chin, a way to feel  connected to our past, blah blah.   Aside from that, I think it's kind of a big inside joke. A calling card, even. You know how when you go out in the real world and you hear someone say ""behind"" or some shit? You immediately recognize they're probably a cook. ""Oui"" sort of operates on the same level but on a smaller scale. When I hear someone casually let a ""oui"" slip out, I immediately assume this guy works in a high end kitchen. Many of my colleagues who work in comparable restaurants (i.e. Michelin stars) all feel the same way about it. As you're probably aware, the culinary world isn't very big. You're probably friends with cooks in other restaurants in your city, they have friends who know guys who work at place x, etc... it's like a little bubble.   I'm not trying to sound arrogant when I say this but the Michelin bubble is even smaller - it's a microcosm within a microcosm. Many of us know each other, have heard of each other, and cooked for and dined with each other. We feel like we're the big boys on the block - we do the best food, we do the most covers, we use the finest ingredients. Yes, I understand this all sounds very self-congratulatory... because it is. I don't want to understate the importance of humility but when you're cooking at this level, it requires a level of commitment that would make most cooks balk. A little stroking of the ego is, sadly, one of the only things that brings any of us any sort of solace.   Anyway, my point is, we don't take ourselves so seriously that we all say oui because it sounds cool or more refined - most of us embrace the ridiculousness of it because our thinking is, who gives a shit what anyone else thinks? We are the best at what we do and if we want to say oui, we'll say fucking oui, even if it makes us look stupid.   Besides, you can't find all French words objectionable. ""Chef"" and ""restaurant"" are both French words, after all."

Sure the market is over saturated, but I had a couple job offers by sending resumes out on poached and craigslist in just a couple weeks. I decided against working in Portland since I don't have to deal with income taxes here in WA. I only have a couple of years cooking line so far, and I don't see myself as a lifer and that was another big reason that I decided against portland. The coolest thing to me about Portland is the sheer number of breweries that have bomb as kitchens. I would check those first. Oh and check out Bottle and Kitchen; I hear they are going to open up a James Beard Market right across the street from them. Having fresh and exotic ingredients that close would be awesome  Oh and pay is roughly around 10-15/hr for line cooks depending on experience of course, as well as tips. Not sure about KM though"

Jobs are easy to find, it's about peppering resumes, and not surprisingly, hitting up bars with industry people. Lots of places are always hiring. Might take a while to find a spot for a long time period, but it can be done.   Rent is a bit trickier. The city has BLOWN up in the last few years. Living on the outskirts is one of the few decent options, but you can still find cheap rooms in the city proper. Just take some looking.  One of the amazing things about this city is just how open many people are. You'd be surprised at what can happen here when you show up in this city."

I currently pay less than a grand for a nice place in St. John's, which is something just below a minor miracle, although the property owners probably just don't know about the taco proximity tax.  As far as wages go, don't expect to make much more than 13 for line work and 15 for management (tho I would say that finding a decent KM or chef/sous situation is a lot harder than finding a decent line job). A lot of places do tipouts for the kitchen, which helps, but it's still not really a situation where you're going to be paid anywhere near your worth."

Now imagine:  Having one person take your order for what you'd like to show up at your doorstep the next morning. Then that person relaying that message to some other people who handpick the list of things that you want out of a huge stockpile of roughly 10,000 items. Then some other people load all that stuff into a truck, that a driver then drives all across and through town in rush hour traffic, going in and out of the truck multiple times to unload at each of 25 stops, sorting thorough it all every step of the way, before it arrives in your walk-in/prep room.   There are so many variables and moving parts involved in any vendor's daily operations that I honestly think it's pretty amazing that as high a percentage of items show up as accurately and in as good a condition as they do.

As a result, I get some pretty wacky requests and have to be really creative because my ingredients are basically limited to gov't handouts and private donations.    One that stands out is a meal with no tap water or bottled water, or oil, that could not be served on anything that had been cleaned with 'chemicals' or made of styrofoam.   I ended up making like 4 eggs scrambled in butter with salt, served on a paper plate (that was easy enough because the town disallows styrofoam takeout containers, so we had paper plates laying around anyway).     Another one was a person who claimed allergy to GMOs. Not any specific GMO food, which would have been halfway believable, but to ALL GMOs. Enjoy your bowl of salt water. I didn't end up serving them anything, but they came back regularly asking if I had non-GMO food yet (this was not at the actual shelter, but at a weekly hot meal program off-site - the person in question was not homeless, rather they knew one of the volunteers in the program and came regularly to visit their friend at work)."

One arm is aiming at providing the most amazing, hearty, well presented, tasteful MEAL  that it can. The other is attempting to inspire and enlighten the eater on what food really can be. They both have their places."

Obviously we would clean them as part of our pre-close so we could go home at a decent time. We had a huge pot we would strain the oil in, We also would did one fryer at a time so we could keep one cooking(pretty common). One night a guy was about to pour the oil back into the fryer when a manager walked into the kitchen and screamed at the guy because the valve was still open. So instead of him dumping hot oil into a fryer and it spilling out onto the floor(maybe burning his feet). He froze up and dropped the pot, It hit the floor and the hot oil shot up in his face.

Sometimes, the distributor would run out of pre-sectioned wings, and one of us (usually me, sadly) would be tasked with breaking down some 200 pounds of chicken wings into winglets. Took forever, but I can honestly tell you that at this point I can bang out 20 of those in a minute due to sheer repetition.  Anyway, at one point the staff diminished really rapidly. Over the course of a week we dropped like half of the kitchen staff for various reasons, and within 2 weeks we were down to literally 4 cooks for open to close. We had to train up our dishwasher, who was an even bigger pothead than your usual dishwasher, on how to work the line. Wing night comes, and I'm needed on the line because at this point I'm one of the most senior people in the restaurant. So we get the happy little stoner breaking down wings and putting them in those big transparent lug tubs that every restaurant seems to have on hand. Long story short, he was slightly blazed and trying to carry the chicken into the cooler, but the floor was wet. Of course, he slips. Drops one lug into a stack of 3 other lugs, knocks the whole thing over, ruins all of the chicken. Easily a few hundred dollars worth, had to cancel wing night and everything.  Upside is, dude got to go back to the dish pit after that."

It was a mistake, but the look on dude's face. I was unofficially in charge by that point, and I couldn't even yell at him.  Woulda been like kicking a puppy or something, he looked like someone told him santa wasn't real. Honestly, I was kinda relieved in the end. This was a kid that I was constantly worried was going to somehow fall face first into the deep fryer, then jump back on the char grill to escape it. It was like trying to teach Gilligan how to make burgers.  If it helps, there is a happy ending. Dude still worked there for 2 years after that."

Needless to say he effectively deep fried his entire right foot. We threw him in the back prep sink filled with cool water until the ambulance came for him. His foot got so infected from the blisters that he had to have an antibiotic pump attached intravenously for a few weeks.

Of course OP didn't care to share these details when I asked so I'm going to assume her actual hourly take was higher than my lowball estimates.  And then you're going to bitch about 25 bucks going to the kitchen.  I know it's not technically legal but wahhhhhh cry me a fucking river here's the world's tiniest violin etc."

Recently we kept the restaurant open for a special late night event, with no gratuity added, and we ended up making almost nothing for an extra four hours of work. The windfall tips help make up for those nights when we are dead, slow, sent home early or just plain get screwed on a big party."

KitchenConfidential,38vi41,Zephlurch,7,Sun Jun 7 04:31:14 2015 UTC,"I'll see if I can give my 2c one point at a time. And for the record? I've been in the industry for 20 years, I'll take an uneducated but enthusiastic/experienced cook any day of the week. Culinary school is good and all, but there's some stuff that you just can't learn without the practical experience.   1: Yeah, the more traditional pub food you can put out there, the easier you'll find it to make money. With a caveat, though. Walk around the area, see what's in the neighborhood. Go around during a dinner rush time, see what's popular. Maybe even get out there and talk to the public, ala ""Kitchen Nightmares"", and get a feel for what people want to see/would like.   There are a few obvious no-brainers that I feel every bar should have on hand, which imo form the backbone of your income. It's the basics that pay the bills, so you can experiment with more interesting fare. That's not to say that you can't make your own spin on em, but stuff like burgers and tacos and wings sell like they do for a reason.  That said? I refuse to go near facebook, but the menu does sound good. If I weren't all the way on the other side of the planet, I'd eat there.  2: Word of mouth and social media will probably be your best bet to start. Maybe put an ad in a local free magazine, if they have them. Getting attention's gonna cost a bit of money, but it's a worthwhile risk. You have a facebook, consider getting a twitter. Have some people put some reviews on yelp for you. Hell, leverage reddit. There's a Melbourne sub, right? Drop a mention of the restaurant, and ask them what kinda food they'd enjoy. It's not an ad if you're asking for feedback, but the plug won't hurt.  3: I mean, that basically falls in with advertising.  4: Well I already touched on it above, but there are some classics that'll seriously help.  You can't go wrong with stuff like panini/grilled sandwiches, BLTs, burgers, and wings. Hell, pasta's cheap and has a good return, as well as lasting forever. That's the kind of dish you want to sort out, because it'll help pay for the food that has a lower cost to profit margin.  It's a tricky scenario, because you want the food to be accessible so lots of people eat there, but you want it to be unique so they want yours instead of anyone else's. Good luck, dude. :D"
KitchenConfidential,38vi41,iamaneviltaco,4,Sun Jun 7 05:01:12 2015 UTC,"For the area, the menu is pretty good. I don't think your menu suggestions would work in Fitzroy. The street over is like a mini-Italy (lygon st) so I can't imagine pasta being worth it. There are already fantastic burger places on Brunswick Street.  Wings would be good though."
KitchenConfidential,38vi41,devilsonlyadvocate,2,Sun Jun 7 16:01:06 2015 UTC,"Word, makes sense. That's why my first point was ""look at the area"". I'm in the US, so things are different here. :D"
KitchenConfidential,38vi41,iamaneviltaco,2,Mon Jun 8 08:46:02 2015 UTC,"Ok, exam period is almost over, and I finally have some serious time to reconfigure the menu. As per /u/iamaneviltaco's great advice, fists will now be my weapon of choice. I'll be focusing on snacky food that fits the refined-casual bar ambiance.  First consideration is the demographic - as you've noted, it's a reasonably young crowd, though the bar is trying to transition this into more of a yuppie scene. I'll do my best to appeal to both. I'm also trying to find the menu sweet-spot between things people will eat at 11pm after seeing a gig, and also be happy to come in for at 6pm for dinner and drinks with work friends.  My main question is about the menu direction/kitchen identity. At the moment, it's kind of an east-meets-west, or asian/international flavours using a mexican vehicle. I'm currently deciding between a couple of directions:   Sticking with this, e.g. quesadillas with japanese ingredients Moving onto slightly alternative typical bar food, e.g. the jo jo's (southern american style wedges) mentioned in a post a little lower. Completely eclectic - choosing signature international dishes, and giving them a melbourne twist. For example, my okonomiyaki game is darn-well on point, and they definitely have a bit of a cult following around the more alternative parts of Melbourne.   What's your intuition? Anybody! I'm so appreciative of this discussion, as I've got extremely limited connections in the industry, and most of my friends just eat at the cheapest dumpling house they can find."
KitchenConfidential,38vi41,iamaneviltaco,1 point,Thu Jun 11 06:39:01 2015 UTC,"How's your discussion with the locals going? Talking to the bar patrons?   You just nailed a thing that you might wanna sort out: ""the cheapest X they can find"". I presume you're in a bar district, so cheap and good is a great thing to explore. Stuff like shredding chicken thighs that have been roasted in a crock pot (seriously, they're hella cheap and you can mix some solid flavors in there, maybe some teriyaki with some fresh basil shredded over the top when you serve the tacos, like we use cilantro and mexican flavors here in the US southwest? The fat makes the chicken juicy as hell and fresh basil plays well with Asian flavors.) as a starter. Thing is, you want every dish recognizable to your customers. So don't go too far out there (I wanted to say that with your fries, because ""fennel salt"" might be too much as far as menu description is concerned) and if you're gonna make it taste good? There are times where less is more. Both on menu descriptions and as far as seasoning. Fennel salt on fries? Probably amazing, I bet. On a menu? You're scaring your customers.   I've done a few Asian wing specials, and chicken skewers that involved Thai peanut sauces, and you know what I put on the menu? ""Asian chicken skewers (may contain peanuts)"". Truth is, your consumers don't care very much. They just want it to taste good. Foodies will ask, and then you can tell them.  Feel free to ping me if you want some more advice, and I really hope you hit up your local subreddit. I'd even offer my personal email address if it might help a bit. I've been where you are, I'd be happy to offer whatever advice I can."

I have been going around and doing research and talking to kitchen owners, and will continue to do so.  I will get involved in /r/Melbourne, thanks! Social media really is a bother, but (particularly in this demographic) it's essential. I'm trying to push facebook and instagram, however I'm finding it difficult when I've got nothing new coming out. getting online reviews is definitely step 2!  And the menu... as /u/devilsonlyadvocate pointed out, it's Fitzroy - a really trendy hospo area, and the food is all highly competitive. That being said, I do need to expand out into a few more of the staples. Also, given it's a bar and not really a sit-down dinner place, it changes things up again. I'm going to explore my menu in a below response, and any input there would be very appreciated."
KitchenConfidential,38vi41,udai_I,2,Sun Jun 7 17:14:01 2015 UTC,"I'll keep an eye out!   I guess the only other advice I can give in the mean time is that if everyone's trying to be trendier than everyone else? Where the hell can someone find a good burger that doesn't cost a ton? You're a bar cook, bar food that can be eaten with your hands will rock if you can make it so. That's why I pointed at sandwiches and burgers. Wing baskets for the people sitting at the bar.  If you're in the middle of an arms race, some times it works best to let people use their fists. Simple and tasty never goes out of style. :D  Also, you're in Australia. Have you ever heard of a Jo-Jo? Fried chicken batter on potato wedges that are deep fried, they're really popular in the south of the US. Cheap, tasty, good returns for your expenses. Great bar food."
KitchenConfidential,38vi41,lucy_throwaway,3,Mon Jun 8 08:53:02 2015 UTC,"Give us more info about the bar.  Does your menu fit the theme and target market? It seems overly simple, yet complicated for a customer who doesn't know food.  Look at what other really popular bars in Melbourne are doing.  Pick a couple things that you think you can do well and make it your own.  Pick items that can feed into each other, they require similar ingredients, but aren't all tacos.    I like the fries, but just say dipping sauce.  Not everyone knows what an aioli is still surprisingly.  Your menu needs to be easy to read for drunk people."
KitchenConfidential,38vi41,lucy_throwaway,1 point,Sun Jun 7 05:00:30 2015 UTC,"The bar wants to have more of a yuppie (young professional) audience, which would really fit its décor, though due to the guy that runs the music bookings, it's currently got more of a student music scene. I'm trying to appeal to both.  Also, given it's location (alternative and good food), I'm pretty comfortable that the menu is comprehensible the average patron - in sobriety, at least. You're completely right, I'll have to simplify the menu a little. Thanks for your feedback!"
KitchenConfidential,38vi41,TheVargTrain,3,Thu Jun 11 06:47:16 2015 UTC,"I don't think many people will agree with me on this but don't be too good at your job.   If you want to succeed in an ""afterthought"" kitchen, never forget that the bar is your livelyhood. You are massively outnumbered by FOH staff, you must cater to their needs to suceed.   First and foremost. If they run the food they should never return for anything. Over portion side sauces, big lime wedges. Your menu items must be fuck up proof. Consistent quality every single fucking time.   Two. The only changes you offer is meat free and sauce on side. Tell FOH to explain that you are a very small kitchen and while you value the business you are simply not able to accommodate such requests. Modified orders will kill you.  Have one menu item that can meet 85% of weird dietary needs, IE a gluten Free vegetarian taco with sauces  automatically on side.    Three. Salt and spice. FOH if your food is perfectly seasoned, drinks won't sell. Don't go overboard but after an order of tacos you SHOULD be craving another drink between spicy and salty.     Menu Design  Dont confuse inebrated patrons with long winded names.  It should look something like this   Crispy Fish Tacos  Catch of the day, Green papaya salad, vietnamese mint and baja sauce  OR  Smoked Tofu  (buzzword) tofu, holly basil and tamarind yogurt  Offer three varieties of tacos daily, and one or two specials on taco tuesdays.   Add a  single substantial entre item to the menu. Perhaps a hamburger, lambchop or any other slab of protein. Make sure it has a great profit margin. If an order of tacos is $6 this needs to be at least $12. And your food cost should be no more than $3.50. Do it simply but well.     Plating   All tacos should be plated with some varation of this   Ideally the plates should ""wash themselves"". Between patty paper and taco stands you should be able to give the plate a shake and put it in the dishwasher.   Planks look nice and all, but you can save time money and have a higher standard of sanitation with porcelain or plastic.   Also, those stainless taco holders will last years.

Also, I've conditioned them well, and I don't serve cutlery, so they're going to last. There's no dishwasher in the kitchen, and hand-washing and hanging them's a sinch.

I'll definitely switch it to your suggested format. As soon as I figure out a bit of an identity for the kitchen (I've discussed it in an above post, if you'd like to weigh-in :) ),  I'll add some sort of hearty option.

I read your identity post and by the time I could have any input I was stuck in a decidedly faux- fine dining joint.   I will say that Jo Jos are a great idea. Understand that traditional american jo-jos sit for hours under heat lamps in display cases, and for all intents and purposes are never eaten fresh from the fryer. As such, they should have a crispy crust but at the same time not a crunch or hard exterior.    The only way I can accurately describe the texture is vulgar. If you filled a mug with jo-jos and tried to fuck it, it wouldn't really abrade your dick. It would hurt but after the fact there would be no visible scratches or cuts or raw spots. Hope that gives you a rough idea not just a strange mental picture.   I would advise you never to add nachos to your menu. I can write paragraphs about the potential pitfalls, just trust me on this.

Also, most of the books here are American and may be hard to get in Australia. I think the perfect book for you is The food I love by Neil Perry. The book is divided into ingredient categories (meat, sea food, pasta etc) and then further divided into cooking techniques (steaming, frying...)  Each section has a bit at the front that contains info on selecting produce, how to cut it, what temperatures it needs to be cooked for, etc. There is also a good bit at the back that takes you through most common sauces and side dishes.  The recipes are also a really nice mix of simple and more advanced. I really can't rave enough about this book, it pretty much single handedly got me into cooking,; the recipes are all fantastic, the book is well laid out and it is big enough to give toy a solid foundation in every basic technique you need to start off.

It's not amazing, nor will it make headlines, but it's good food.    As for school, gonna head to william angliss. Almost all the chefs I've worked for/with have recommended it to me.

Don't be so down on yourself, I'm the head chef in a good restaurant, and I'll hire complete noobs with the right attitude and drive over a young chef who already thinks that they're amazing.    If you're in a French place also check out Bouchon, and for English cuisine, Roast Chicken and Other stories by Simon Hopkinson has great technique, and is briliantly written.  Also Nose to tail eating by fergus henderson.  Feel free to PM me if you need any other advice.  Good luck."
KitchenConfidential,38sqe8,foedus,1 point,Mon Jun 8 10:11:41 2015 UTC,"I've been told the industry is generally like that. I was told I could either keep going as is - write most things down, push myself roughly as hard as required and I'd make an okay chef. One day.   Or I could practice at home, buy books, learn everything I can, write down the inane and learn from it, either good or bad. And when I became better (as in, working grill/pans, not just larder) that I should consider staging at a better restaurant and learn everything they can teach me as well.   Main thing holding me back, well. I've been suicidal since I was 10, diagnosed as depressed since I was 8. Shit's rough, and the stress of being in a good restaurant - with all my obvious knowledge gaps - it's not going so well. I beat myself up over each mistake, which drives everybody nuts. Basically going back to see my old psych and hopefully fix this shit, because it's going to either cost me my job or my life at this rate.   Beyond that, I'll get there. My knives are good, I know how to sharpen them, I haven't lost any fingers. I struggle to work hard, but that's just practice. Busting ass can be taught/learnt, unlike what some people think. It just can't be forced.   Although, I've gotta ask; where do you work? Not that it matters, but hey, never hurt to ask.   Edit: Also, pasta machines. What should I look at for home use? I'll ask my sous when I go back to work on wednesday, but having just made some homemade pasta, I think I'll be making more. But rolling it by hand? Hell, I won't be able to play with myself for a week each time I make it."

Remember a couple of things,  your worth as a person has nothing to do with your worth as a chef.   Also, becoming a good chef takes time - and I'm talking fucking years.  It's a long haul, its not going to happen tomorrow no matter what books you read, but it will happen.  Don't beat yourself up when you make mistakes.  Take responsibility and learn from them.  At the end of the day we're just doing our best to make something nice for someone else to eat.  If we make a mistake in the kitchen, its a pain in the arse for the guys standing next to us, and it sucks at the time, but we're not surgeons and nobody is going to die.  Pasta machines? You shouldn't need to spend more than $100.  Atlas make a good domestic one, have a look at Constante Imports in Preston, or Enoteca Sileno in Nth Carlton.  Enoteca also have a good cooking school if you want to do a pasta class."

Either way, beating myself up is something I do unintentionally.   I dunno, you'd assume people would die based off the reactions we get at times.   I figured $100 would be the endpoint, but wasn't sure where to look.   Would you say that pasta class is worth it, considering we make it at work anyway? Not to be a dick or anything, but $125 for a 3 hour course.. That's most of a weeks wage after rent/bills are paid."

When I was young I didn't even realize how much of a mess I was making, or the benefits of working clean. Explain the benefits to them as well. Tell them it seriously takes 15 seconds to do a quick wipe down of your station, even when you are super busy. It only takes a few seconds to put something away when you are done with it, rather than leave it out, even when you are super busy. Tell them how working clean and organized is part of a mentality that once developed will begin to take them places in the restaurant industry. People see that shit, and if I were calling places on someone's application and an old chef said they may not be the fastest on the line, but they sure work fucking clean, that would bump them up on my list, at least a little.

Only took me X amount of minutes with a green scratch pad and de-greaser (or whatever) to do it and I only do it X amount of times a week. It really makes a difference in my performance, everything is easier to get to and find and makes this place looks better for everyone and makes going home at night faster.""

Who's gonna argue with you if you're trying to get them to be cleaner? There's some stubborn cooks out there, but keeping clean is common sense, and a food safety issue.  Can't argue with that.    Also keeping a clean and organized station helps everyone stay out of the weeds.  When I was working on the line for the first time and would get backed up, another cook would always help me dig myself out of the weeds, and the first thing he would do was come over and organize and wipe down my station.  I saw what a difference it made, so maybe doing that would help.  That way you don't come across as a douche because you're helping them, and you can show them how much easier it is to work with a neat station.    If all else fails just be a douche and get on their case all the time.  You might piss some people off but its a necessary change and if the chef isn't going to step up, someone has to.  I was just out looking for a second job, and got a decent offer but after looking into the restaurant and asking around, I found out they had a dirty kitchen (knew someone who previously worked there and they said they would never eat there after seeing the kitchen) and although the money was good, I didn't accept because who wants to work in a shithole?"

KitchenConfidential,38r78a,Eggless_Omelette,7,Sat Jun 6 04:10:21 2015 UTC,"Are you sure? Taxes don't work that way, you're only taxed at the higher rate on the amount your earn over the maximum amount of the previous lower bracket."

He was staging for the second night, we were seriously minutes away from offering him a prep cook job. It was a night that we were doing an 8 course dinner and we only had a couple of extra pieces of pork belly for how many people we were serving. They were cooking faster than I expected on the grill so I asked the stage to come help me flip them. He was using tongs and broke two pieces in a row so I told him to get a fish spat (with a frustrated tone of voice, for sure) and he called me a fucking bitch as he walked away. I waited til the course went out, told my chef, and was backed up by my line cook who is like my brother. Stage gets told to go home and that he won't have a job and he came back in to the kitchen and actually squared up to me and kept calling me a lying cunt while I told him to get the fuck out of my kitchen. It was insane, I really thought that he was going to try to fight me. Jon pushed him out the door in to the alley and he tried to get back in so he got punched right in the face and pushed back out.

KitchenConfidential,38lih6,Triviaandwordplay,24,Sat Jun 6 04:26:47 2015 UTC,"I owned a restaurant for 23 years. We did the same sort of pranks.   We had a freezer for fries, and we'd have someone get in, and we'd stack fries around them so they can't be seen. We'd send someone over to get a case of fries or two, which of course would reveal someone trying to pose like a frozen body. Once I wasn't even facing the door, and I had my head cocked to one side so it looked like I was dead.   One of us would get on the bottom shelf of our walk-in, and grab the ankle our dairy delivery guy when he loaded our walk-in.   We'd hide in a giant steam kettle, and send someone to clean it. Once, employees tried that prank on me, but I knew they were up to something, so I just walked over to it, and turned it on.(Don't worry, it's steam jacketed, and doesn't heat up that fast.)  When the laundry service guy would show up, we would take a laundry bag, get inside of it, put towels and aprons over the top. That one kinda backfired on me, because my laundry guy was a beast, and the first thing he did was push down really hard to compact the laundry so he could cinch up the bag.   We had barrels of chili peppers packed in brine, and the brine looked like the particular Lemon Ole beverage product we had. If someone was drinking Lemon Ole, we'd switch it out for chili pepper brine.   Good times."

Then the dishwasher decided to just pull one in my face and I got hit in the eye with something...  That was the end of that."

KitchenConfidential,38nw0n,roblobster69,7,Fri Jun 5 12:54:17 2015 UTC,"I've worked in a few Country Clubs which often have very interesting opinions on food safety and storage. The fisrt thing is that if half your menu rely's on chix and you know you sell 300 from thurs to Saturday, wensday morning 300 chix ough to walk in to the walk-in. Although sealed (I hope) you still shouldn't defrost chix with water because it covers everything with a fine misty salmonella spray that is in the vicinity of it, thats just a side note.   That veg oil for carrots is a new one. But your best bet is to look around and write a short list (quietly) of everything not Servsafe in the kitchen and go to managment if the chef/head cook isn't listening and say look at all these violations I found if a health inspector comes in were screwed and see if that doesn't change their tone. At that point its like a crossroads, can you produce food that might get people sick? If so good luck I won't be eating it. But if you are looking for a cooking job (and this has helped me after someone told me) never accept a job without looking through the walk-ins. I can tell more about a kitchen from 10 minutes alone in a walk-in than I can with a 3-course meal in the front of the house.   The last thing and then i'll shut up, if you have a backwards ass way of looking at the world and want to be left alone with your problems a kitchen is an awesome crevice to crawl into. So your kitchen manager just genuinely may not give a shit and nothing you can do will change their mind, so you have to change your mind."
KitchenConfidential,38nw0n,Awfultyming,3,Fri Jun 5 13:49:30 2015 UTC,"Nope not even sealed chicken in water, you can see the outsides slightly cooked while in the sink :( We move ridiculous amounts so it would be easy to have it figured out in advance with no risk of it going to waste. It's also prepped in the dishpit at the clean end, sometimes next to clean plates which no one moves.  I've been putting together a list in my head of the violations, I'll have to focus on that if I talk to management rather than the annoying, fucking weird stuff like oily carrots lol. The owners are really nice people that have had success with the business for 11 years so I think I'm gona have to talk to them.  It's not easy to get work here, and I've just moved back from overseas work to be near my family while making $20 an hour less so part of me doesn't want to get too involved, but at the same time it shouldn't be difficult to work clean tidy and safe in a place that's been consistent and popular for over a decade.  Also the health inspector has just been. They look at a quiet, closed down kitchen that's just had a deep clean, not any of the processes involved in production which is where the problems are. I was actually asked to fill out 5 months of temp sheets, I've worked here for two months so I refused obviously."

Our AKM decided that our spare pans were over seasoned, so before we could make dough on them she put them through the wash. This lead to them neading to be completely re-seasoned, which she did not do, deciding to just make the pizzas on the pans as they were leading to about 50 or 60 of the pizzas getting stuck to the pans.   We had to remake the ruined pizzas on the dough that was supposed to last through dinner rush, make a new batch of dough and then scrape these garbage pizzas out of the pans."

KitchenConfidential,38mr7h,Shalmanese,16,Mon Jun 8 01:59:10 2015 UTC,"Based on the broken English and reference to Thai iced tea, I assume the owner is native to Asia while most people in the kitchen were brought up in America.  Seems like a case of cultural differences resulting in poor communication and mutual frustration on all sides. Asian cultures place a lot more emphasis on rule following and subsuming your identity for the harmony of the group (gross generalization, I know). The owner is probably frustrated, not so much due to the food stealing as the implied lack of respect for their authority and the breakdown of order.  OTOH, North American culture prizes far more individual autonomy and market based solutions to problems. There's the feeling among the staff that if only you would either pay me more or treat me better, I would stop taking food from the line.  The important thing to realize here is that both sides have good intentions but are stuck from their cultural background into interpreting the other side's actions in a negative light. Since the owner is now living in America and needs to deal with American customs, the onus is really on him to meet you halfway.  If I were you, I'd quietly take the owner aside and emphasize that Americans do things differently, NOT because the American way is superior, it's just different. Tell them you understand where he's coming from and that there's a more productive solution to the problem. Explain to them that the American way is that, if you treat people with respect and fairness, they will go out of their way to return the same to you but if they feel like they are disrespected, they will act to sabotage you (I know this is a pretty naively optimistic viewpoint but just pretend it's true when selling it to him).   Propose that he give you a small budget and you can help be his guide in fixing these problems. Use the budget to buy some beers for the crew or fix any annoying niggling equipment issues that are bothering the staff. Make sure everyone knows this is coming from the owner and that he wants a happy kitchen and that the rewards will keep coming if the staff stop doing the things that bug the owner so much.  Maybe that will work, maybe the owner is just an asshole who can't be fixed or the staff are just sociopaths. I can't say for sure not knowing any more of the context. But I feel like it'd be worth a shot and turning things around. Also, if you ever have aspirations towards a leadership role, it's things like this that get you there. Demonstrating that you're a person that people can trust and rely on is key to assuming leadership."

If an employer does not authorize or permit a rest period, the employer shall pay the employee one hour of pay at the employee's regular rate.    ""A major fraction thereof"" is defined as 2 hours or more. I have a feeling that politely pointing this out will either 1) get this whole cutting pay thing straightened out, if you only do one family meal per day, or 2) get you fired over something petty.

Since you ask for feedback and food for thought, my personal opinion if I'm forced to be critical: I find some of the pasta dishes a bit uninspiring. The first image seems 'heaped' rather than constructed. I think pasta is really difficult to do in this style of plating. The chef really enjoys using negative space, in the gnudi dish this works perfectly, with the leaf emphasizing the negative space perfectly; it's also great in a different way in the boiled meat dish and the pork chop (personally I'm not so keen when sauce or purée reaches the edge of the plate - did this get wiped or is it meant to be like that on the pork?). The pasta, however, seems either isolated in the agnolotti or heaped in the clams. The raviolo, however, works really well because it's an undivided whole.  As I've sat here and looked at the images, however, I think maybe I'm seeing the linguine up too close -- it looks bigger than it probably is to me. Maybe my thoughts are unfair.  The tartare looks fantastic, as does the asparagus. They're both standouts for different reasons."

KitchenConfidential,38jzd4,Everyday_Pants,2,Fri Jun 5 05:44:04 2015 UTC,These are some pretty slick looking plates... that asparagus dish and the chilled nettle soup is some next level shit.   The purple potato water was a nice stroke of luck/brilliance. I especially like how it gradually fades along the edges as it runs across the plate and leaves a trail of starch - it gives the illusion of water color. I think the dish itself could probably use a bit more acidity and some more green - maybe some shredded scallions lightly dressed in olive oil and lemon? I know this wasn't the intended form of the dish and this was an off the cuff amuse bouche - looks nice.  Everything looks really delicious. You in the city?
KitchenConfidential,38jzd4,the_popular_whale,2,Fri Jun 5 04:44:33 2015 UTC,"I tend to go very minimal on garnish, hence the two watermelon radish and that's it for greens.

Just doesn't sound right or look right imo.  2 - Looks like dessert w/ the purple, and I guess I'm wondering what the water is for, really.  I'd probably order it to find out, though.  Boiled dinner - doesn't feel right, it's close to original but far from it.  I love the stuff though, so a server could easily sell me on it.  Terrine - I hate scallops, but I'd still be tempted to order that.  Nettle soup - beautiful.  The rest all look quite nice."

KitchenConfidential,38gi8s,athena435,105,Thu Jun 4 01:31:59 2015 UTC,"This is Kobe NY strip, filet, and ribeye.  Editing since this got way more attention than I anticipated. We have a really cool Kobe program in our place that we're quite proud of. This beef is produced on a very small scale so there a lot of demand for it. Few importers can get all of the necessary certifications to sell this product. We have the gold seal, and Japanese certificates framed.  We bring in the subprimals and butcher them in house. The steaks are then cooked in Kobe fat rendered from the trim with salt and pepper, then basted with more Kobe fat in a broiler and finished with peppered maldon salt.  Price varies on the final product based on market rates and supply. We rarely run out, but it does happen on occasion.  We have a ton of other great beef, including Australian wagyu filets and tomahawks.   Thanks for all the interest, I seriously thought maybe 50 people in this subreddit would even see this pic!"

KitchenConfidential,38gi8s,PoppySiddal,12,Thu Jun 4 13:40:39 2015 UTC,"Just depends on what cuts they fabricate I guess? If they fabricate just eye of rib steaks/roasts, they'll have to do something with that cap.

KitchenConfidential,38gi8s,this_isnt_tyler,2,Thu Jun 4 15:12:44 2015 UTC,I was wondering why the ribeye steaks looked so weird. I guess because the cap is missing? That's my favorite part of the ribeye. I didn't know you could get that separate. That is good news! TIL

It's very easy to butcher, as long as you make sure not to waste anything. The silver skin can be pulled off quite easily, but care must be taken not to take off meat with it. The texture is almost like butter that's been out of the fridge for a little bit. Quite the opposite experience from butchering dry age which feels like cutting balsa wood."

I don't know precisely what breed of cow it comes from or grade or anything like that. I just know it's Japanese and has a shit ton of marbling like in those pictures.  And, honestly, it is too fatty for me. It cooks up nice and makes for a soft piece of meat to be sure. But by the time I'm almost done, I feel a bit sick.  If others really enjoy meat like this, that's great. Not saying that it's inherently bad. But for some of us, so much fat really doesn't sit well."

My favorite flavor profile that I have used was a juniper-pink peppercorn rub to start then I would oil the pan with a mix of butter and coconut oil and baste regularly while it sears. The accompanying sauce is like the national Thai dish (but I learned it from Cambodians): sugar, salt, lime, cilantro, garlic, Thai chili, and fish sauce all muddled together.   A good steak is a visceral experience for me and I would love to hear anyone's steak recipes. Respect the meat."

With the Kobe scrap I usually salt it, throw it on a flat top just to crisp it then eat it plain.  We have quite a few sauces at the restaurant, the one I miss is the red wine chili glaze we used to run for a short rib. We make a habanero butter that is ridiculously good on nearly everything, but it rips my stomach up so I no longer eat it.  The best steak sauce ever though is our soy miso butter mixed with the habanero butter. The flavor is insane."

I have literally never had better meat and I've lived and dined at great restaurants in LA for 40 years. They didn't have ribeye -- just filet, tri-tip and sirloin. Thought I was going to be gravely disappointed in the sirloin but it was better than the best prime ribeye I've ever had. It was like buttah.  To save money, we ate itherefor lunch. $120 for an 8 oz. sirloin with beautiful veg, a salad and miso. Dinner would have been probably double. It wasn't a fancy or well-known place but my son (who lives in Kyoto) researched thoroughly and the restaurant had received consistently good reviews.  The most highly anticipated event and, afterward, one of my top 3 experiences of a two-week, amazing trip."

I've had people seriously try to order steaks ""medium-medium rare"". I'm like ""So you want me to somehow exactly hit 157 degrees internal temperature?""  We had this one dude who used to come into one of my restaurants, his thing was ""I want my steak to double as footwear"". First time he ordered a steak, my KM cooked the hell out of it.

Breakfast people are 1 out of 3 IME.  However I know what you mean by those people though. Some people don't know what they want is what I've learned. It can be frustrating and I understand your pain completely.   The Pittsburgh, I don't even know it's origins but it's impossible unless you work in a steel mill... wait Pittsburgh and Steel mills go hand in hand. Maybe it comes from steel mill workers jamming steaks in the fire and ovens for steel as their lunch or snack.   Best thing I've seen for Pittsburgh rare is to sprinkle some some sweet paprika on it along with the normal seasoning and then put it directly on the flame or a burner. It gets darker then normal but I wouldn't call it a char really."
KitchenConfidential,38k6ls,DrStephenFalken,2,Sun Jun 7 04:19:39 2015 UTC,"I can definitely agree with you, when it comes to toast. It's like some people carry a color swatch with them to make sure the hue is absolutely perfect. Meanwhile the cook is all ""IT COST LESS THAN A DOLLAR. DO YOU REALLY CARE THAT MUCH?""  From what I've heard, the most believable explanation for the Pittsburgh rare steak is that they cooked them with their welding equipment while on break. Either way it goes, damn does that look disgusting. I dunno about you, but if it was a ""cook it on the extremely hot boiler"" scenario? I'd much rather be making a pizza.  The paprika thing is a clever idea. We always just basically deep fried them in the hottest pan of oil we could possibly manage. Seriously dangerous, but it gets the char right. I feel like ""this can permanently disfigure the cook"" should be grounds to refuse a dish."

Both of you are over-worked and bad-tempered because of it.  He needs to hire a closer, at least. Pay some high school kid to come in after you close just to make sure your kitchen gets clean, stock put away - CORRECTLY - etc. All those things that don't take a chef, but that have to be done and done right each evening. Find a kid interested in cooking and they might work for peanuts in return for you teaching him a few tricks - maybe teach him some of the prep - what you can do for the next day before you head home. That way he learns stuff, he can eventually take over that prep, and you're ahead for the next morning.  You also need a clear definition of your job - baking cakes, yes. Cutting cakes, NO. That should be on the wait staff. The job description should also come with a 'minimum hours of sleep' defined. He wants you to stay until 3am? Fine, but you don't come in until 8 so that you can get at least 4 hours of sleep. You could even define exceptions - like in emergencies, you'll be ok with 3 hrs sleep, but you'll need 8 the next night, or something along those lines.    As for the prep schedule - as I see it, your job is to get out the food on time and in good shape, HOWEVER you need to schedule your time to do that. HIS job is to get obstacles (including himself!) out of your way so that you can. HIM designing a prep schedule doesn't fit into that.

KitchenConfidential,38it64,AtMyLastJob,4,Thu Jun 4 14:29:25 2015 UTC,"My background: Lived in Chicago since 2007; visited San Francisco a few times a couple of weeks at a time for work; visited New York once for a few days  I love Chicago. It's got a great mix of high-and-low, from amazing street food to the most avant garde high-end restaurants. Charlie Trotter's was here, Alinea is here, El Ideas, Grace, Spiaggia, etc, etc, etc. Great music, great stand-up, easy access to good outdoor sporting areas like Wisconsin or rural Illinois if camping or biking is your thing. Good produce & meats, especially from farmers in Michigan and Wisconsin during the summer. Food truck situation is kind of crappy but getting better. Rent is pretty doable, especially if you don't have to live in the ritzy part of town and are willing to get roommates. Great Mexican food, especially (I love Mexican food). Seafood for the most part has to be flown in.  NYC was cool, but in a lot of ways I thought it was similar to Chicago just more cramped and dirtier. I will say it's got a great vibrancy to it. Everybody's always up really late and doing things. It makes it a really exciting place to be. Great food, of course, of all shapes and kinds. I've heard rent is what you would expect for a city trapped on an island.   San Francisco I thought was interesting, but not necessarily my thing. From what I've heard, the rent is on the completely insane side, because you have all these people trying to make it as the new tech billionaire. It's a beautiful city, with great weather practically year round. The main thing I think would drive me there was the produce, however, which was AMAZING and make every dish it went into pretty good. Shitty vending machine cup of fruit in the middle of winter? Delicious. Random Chinese place you found? Delicious. Random street vendor? Delicious.   That being said, I would look at the restaurants in each city and decide which place has the most you want to work for."

The blade is extremely sharp out of the box and slices through most things effortlessly, although it can be a bit of a pain when rocking to cut herbs. My exec seemed a bit wary of them at first but after letting him use them he ended up being quite impressed.

All of these restaurants switching to shell eggs is raising the demand and creating a price hike.    We order eggs from our produce vendor normally.  Our big box supplier said we can't order from them as they are struggling to meet demand.    Prices will stabilize in a month or so.

KitchenConfidential,38fgyu,cool_hand_luke,2,Thu Jun 4 09:09:26 2015 UTC,"It's time to flex the writing skills.   So you come in on a Friday night. Knob creek Whiskey and a nueske wrapped  8 oz filet with goat cheese mash call to you from the menu, like a siren to an argonaut. A day before you arrived, a 5-6 pound beef tenderloin was delivered to the kitchen. After which it was cleaned of silver skin, chain, and excess fat by a man who watched and learned to do it just right over the course of 2 years (yours truly). From there it was then cut into 8oz portions give or take a quarter oz. Following that it is lovingly wrapped in apple wood smoked nueske bacon.   Your sides of goat cheese mash and brocolini are an entirely different affair. When the potatoes arrive they are washed in cool water, pruned of sprouts and eyes, rubbed down in kosher salt and olive oil then baked in an oven. In the meantime white onions are being skinned, diced, and caramelized in preparation for their marriage to the now baking potatoes. When these potatoes are cooked to near perfection, they are pulled from the oven and ceremoniously gutted of their now soft and tasty innards and mixed in with thyme leaves pruned from the fresh herb, goat cheese, salt and pepper, the onions, and a good swig of heavy cream. The broccolini every night is washed, stems trimmed, and par blanched for service.  Now back to the present, when that vixen of a printer sings forth the song of your order the cogs of the machine known as the kitchen take action. Your steak now oiled, seasoned and ready for play hits the grill with an all too familiar hiss and sizzle, she's singing for you it enhances her flavor. Now all eyes are on the thermometer and clock, temperature and timing are important to this culinary heist. When the last minute arrives your broccolini takes another dive into a boiling bath. Your mash potatoes find themselves in a sauna of butter and fire. When your steak is ready, and only when she is truly ready a bed of goat cheese mash is prepared for her to lay upon, and lightly seasoned broccolini cuddles next to her as she takes a short trip to your waiting fork and knife."
KitchenConfidential,38fgyu,Soulbishop,2,Fri Jun 5 04:18:25 2015 UTC,"Get your popcorn ready.... Swinehauxe with herbed Spaztle.  We get our produce deliveries first thing in the morning. The AM sous will check everything for quality and quantity and file the paperwork in the office. He then moves everything over to the prep sink. The dishie will be clearing up leftovers from last night and getting the machine set up and preparing the wash sink for the veggies. They have their own cleaning solution and get a good scrubbing. The herbs and delicate stuff get moved into the walkin, and he gets to work peeling the carrots/onions. Trimming the celery. Peeling garlic and shallots. We get all that stuff completely raw, but you will never see it in our walk-in that way. The produce side is all giant lexans with already peeled onions, carrots, trimmed greens. No bags, or cardboard cases ever go in there.   There are 2 main prep tasks to this dish. The protein(pork shanks) and the Spatzle (little dough nuggets)  We don't freeze any of our proteins and we have next day delivery, so if the meat comes in, we make it that day. The pork shanks get washed and rinsed until the water runs clear. 1 batch is 24 shanks. We pour our brine over them, label and date, and let them sit for 2 days. When this time has passed we will drain the brine and move them to 3 hotel pans, where we also add the braising liquid. Hard cider, garlic, shallots, onions, ginger, other stuff. All this is pulled right from the walking ready to use, because of the hard work of the AM dishie early that morning. These get cooked for 4.5 hours and then allowed to rest overnight. This is all done by a sous chef, as they like to handle the meat.  When the fry cook stocks his station he will first scrape the hard cold fat off the top of 1 of the pans and discard it. Then we throw it in the oven just long enough to liquefy the braise juice. The hocks are pulled out and cleaned, the liquid is strained through cheesecloth. This is all done by the fry cook. The liquid will be given to the saute cook. He will reduce it by half and season it if need be.  Now the Spatzle is also done by a prep cook. Its made from sourdough. We have our own starter frothing away in the walking or near the bakers table. A little bit is added to flour and other stuff and mixed together. The dough is run through a grate to form little droplets that fall into boiling water. When they float they are done and we move them to ice water. This is done in small handfuls. 1 batch give about 48 quarts of finished sourdough spatzle. The saute guy stocks up his station from this batch.  There is also the pickled apple mustard, which involves finely cutting up apple and pouring a sweet pickling sauce over it, vac sealing, and waiting about a week or so. This is then drained and mixed with whole grain mustard and seasoned with a little salt/honey.  Finally when an order comes in the fry guy drops a shank into the deep fryer. Set at 275 (low for a deep fryer). This is the only thing that goes in this fryer. The saute guy looks over to the fry guy and asks for a 5 out. Total time in the fryer is about 9 minutes depending on the size of the shank, so in 4 minutes he calls 5 out! to the saute guy. Saute guy starts fire under a cast iron skillet. Hits it with oil until it starts smoking like crazy, then drops a hand full of the Spatzle. He then seasons that, and gets another pan going to warm up the reduced braising liquid from the shank. This also gets seasoned. When the spatzle is good and browned on the bottom he flips the whole mass. Then strain off the oil, kill the flame, knob of butter, and a lot of green herbs, toss toss, taste, adjust. Taste the liquid. salt it.   When the fry guy sees the spatzle get the green herbs he checks the shank. If its not quite ready he can tell the saute guy to pump the brakes a little. Otherwise when the spatzle hits the plate, he walks the shank over and places on the plate in just the right spot. The saute guys then pours over the braise liquid, tops with some more herbs, and does a quenelle of the pickled apple mustard on top.  Swinehauxe en la ventana guey!"
KitchenConfidential,38fgyu,newnewBrad,2,Sat Jun 6 00:53:42 2015 UTC,"Well... it depends. In my old restaurant, for example, we served the yellow walleye.   The fish was frozen but pretty fresh (local fish store). We defrost a bunch of them early in the afternoon, and store them in our little fridge. When we get an order, we first heat up the pan filled with oil (we remove the oil every 6-7 orders). We then pick up the flour mixture (with a bunch of different spices, made beforehand in a large quantity), and put some of it in a large plate. We coat the fish in the flour mixture, then wait until the oil is hot enough. We usually take a lil' amount of water and drop it on the oil. If it starts sizzling enough, the oil is hot enough and we can put the fish in the pan.   We grab a plate and start the decoration/salad. A large salad with cherry tomatoes, peppers and (?... I forgot, haven't worked there for 5 years haha). We pour some home-made vinaigrette and we cut a quarter of a lemon and put it beside the salad. All these ingredients are located at our cold table.   Afterwards, we turn the fish at mid-cooking and remove it when it has a nice golden color (of course, we make sure it's properly cooked, sometimes, the oil is too hot and it might need another 30 seconds).  We take the fish out with some tongs - DO NOT BREAK IT! - and bring it near our plate. We put some rice (from our hot table) on the plate and put the fish on it. We pour some honey along the fish and finally spread some spices (again, a mixture made beforehand) onto it. Voilà.   Now, do this between 10 different tickets (30-40~ orders),  with steaks, pastas, frying stuff, oven stuff, etc."
KitchenConfidential,38fgyu,lorty,1 point,Thu Jun 4 05:21:38 2015 UTC,"Two weeks ago, a supplier called the kitchen manager and said ""It's gonna be a good year for ramps.  And I think we'll have some morels coming on."" A week ago, the kitchen manager called the ramp guy and he says ""My bad, ramps are shit this year, we can't get you very many.""  Now the head chef knows that he can use the ramps as a garnish but probably not as, say, a pesto base. This morning, the ramp guy also showed up with morels.  The head chef has had a few plans in his head about what to do with these morels and the ramps. He knows what he's got now, and he looks at his protein (which probably came from the farm a couple of days ago as part of a standing order). He decides to rock some roasted pork chops over a bed of roasted ramps, served with a side of morel-flecked mashed potatoes.  The low men get to it peeling the potatoes and cleaning the ramps.  The sous chef prepares the meat for roasting.  After lunch service closes out, the head chef will prepare the pork so that it can be fired for service. The mashers will be finished close to service so that they don't get starchy and gross."

I sold all of my stuff, packed my life into a suitcase and hit the road for a year +.  I was young enough that it was no big deal.  I had no responsibilities aside from looking after myself.  I got to see parts of the world I may not have otherwise and travel a good bit.  Then when I was done I KNEW where I wanted to be.  I didn't guess or settle, I KNEW.    That is worth a lot.

This means it is illegal in any US state to tip out the kitchen.

Again, this is a rough interpretation coming from a labor dept. rep.   Because our expo did not directly support a tipped worker by working alongside that person, as well as performing similar duties as that tipped worker, they could not be tipped.   It only takes one pissed off server to ruin a restaurant with a labor lawsuit. It isn't worth the gamble to open up tips to BOH positions."

Tip Pool Requirements :  The requirement that an employee must retain all tips does not preclude a valid tip pooling or sharing arrangement among employees who customarily and regularly receive tips, such as waiters, waitresses, bellhops, counter personnel (who serve customers), bussers, and service bartenders. A valid tip pool may not include employees who do not customarily and regularly received tips, such as dishwashers, cooks, chefs, and janitors.  Tip Pooling:   As noted above, the requirement that an employee must retain all tips does not preclude a valid tip pooling or sharing arrangement among employees who customarily and regularly receive tips. The FLSA does not impose a maximum contribution amount or percentage on valid mandatory tip pools. The employer, however, must notify tipped employees of any required tip pool contribution amount, may only take a tip credit for the amount of tips each tipped employee ultimately receives, and may not retain any of the employees' tips for any other purpose."

The rate is based off how much tips are made in a 2 week period (ex. Open for 224 hrs/2 weeks. Total tips =$5152.  Hours open÷total tips=rate/hr)  then they are split based on hours worked (80 hours worked on a $2.30/hr = $184 cash) everyone seems pretty happy about the system. Only real complaing is that the max is 80 hours per period, so overtime isn't counted towards tips.

KitchenConfidential,3899sq,Sharcbait,1 point,Wed Jun 3 13:31:02 2015 UTC,AZ here. Majority of tips do not make it to the kitchen. I've worked a few bars and have gotten tipped out for bar backing of assisting servers.   I now own a place. I divvy up tips amongst servers by hours and offer the kitchen guys free food.
KitchenConfidential,3899sq,thatoneguystephen,1 point,Wed Jun 3 18:35:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, we're tipped out. All nonsalaried cooks, dishwashers, and FOH are. Not equally though, not even equally amongst the cooks. Not really sure how it works."
KitchenConfidential,3899sq,north_n,1 point,Wed Jun 3 19:11:50 2015 UTC,"No with a tiny bit of Yes. I usually do not get tipped out, there is no policy for it. Occasionally if a Waiter or bartender had a great night tho, they will throw all of the kitchen staff a few bucks. Also when we go out after work, it is usually the case where they will be the one who buys the pitchers for our table. But again it is only cuz we are friendly not because they HAVE to."
KitchenConfidential,3899sq,mrminty,1 point,Wed Jun 3 20:22:33 2015 UTC,"At the BBQ joint I work at, all tips are collected into a jar and counted at the end of every shift. The sum of the tips during the pay period is dispersed among all the staff members based on how many hours they worked, regardless of position.  We don't have waitstaff though. Customers order at the front counter, drinks are self serve, and we always have one or two people expediting the food and bringing it to the tables, offering refills etc.  I work strictly in the kitchen and have no interaction with customers unless someone from FOH pulls me out to answer a question for a customer."
KitchenConfidential,3899sq,BallLikeRalphSamson,1 point,Thu Jun 4 14:23:02 2015 UTC,"Nope, paid hourly. Sometimes, when we get big parties, like 30+, we'll get tipped out. Most restaurants I've worked in do it this way. Also, our owner is the bomb and pays us hourly on top of that while only requiring us to report about 10% of the tip. Shhh!"
KitchenConfidential,3899sq,yellowette,1 point,Fri Jun 5 16:05:25 2015 UTC,"My restaurant only has runners and cashiers, so all tips are pooled and distributed evenly based on hours worked. It's been bad recently, but I'll walk with an extra $2-$6 per hour worked on top of ten bucks an hour. So not bad for me considering the work involves no real autonomy or artistry, just churning out tickets as fast as humanly possible"
KitchenConfidential,3899sq,yellowette,1 point,Fri Jun 5 17:20:59 2015 UTC,"I work at two restaurants, and get tipped out at both of them.  These are the first places I've ever worked that has tipped cooks though.  One is running banquets for a place, so I get a cut of the gratuity, and the other is a gastropub that decides to split all tips between foh and boh.  Pretty sweet gigs, tips rule, and now I can use it as bargaining in future spots"
KitchenConfidential,3899sq,yellowette,1 point,Mon Jun 8 06:19:35 2015 UTC,"Yes. We get tipped out depending on sales of the week. If we do 60,000 in one week, we can expect our tipouts (which is every 2 weeks) to be $150-200. I'm not sure what percentage that is, but it depends on the food sales.  Unlike my last job, which wasn't a high volume place like my current job is, and they would collect our tips and give it to us every so often so it was worth something. The first one we got was $100 (which finally came to me after 9 months of working there) and another $100 after another 9 months. Then I found out that the servers were actually tipping out to the owners more than we were getting. Those jerks would always show up with new gadgets or a new car, so we figured they were pocketing our money.  I guess it just depends on the place."
KitchenConfidential,3899sq,MylesMDT,1 point,Wed Jun 3 01:41:37 2015 UTC,I believe it was 2% actually.

KitchenConfidential,3899sq,ParhelionLens,1 point,Wed Jun 3 20:05:08 2015 UTC,"Federal law in the US specifically prohibits tip-sharing with any employee that does not have direct contact with a customer.  It also prohibits any tip share that causes any single employee to lose more than 10% of their personal tips.  Otherwise,  it's illegal.  One quick call to the DOL will suffice.  Granted, the law is often broken, but it's still wrong.  Most BOH people aren't going to bitch about free money, and most servers in shit markets aren't willing to lose their job over it."

KitchenConfidential,3899sq,HitlersThong,2,Wed Jun 3 03:21:11 2015 UTC,"You get a percentage of their sales, not their tips (we tip out 5% of sales).  Which is why as a server it hurts if a table doesn't tip, because you're still tipping out the kitchen, hosts, etc..."

No need to add something to the list we have, no need to delay tickets, no need to feel bad.   Bit boring, but if we're busy, be reasonable. If you can't heat pasta sauce, we'll happily teach you. Or yell at you to google it.   If we aren't busy, then ask. I enjoy it. Good way to use mise that'll turn in a day or two, good way to experiment with no repercussions (you said surprise me), just a bit of general fun.

But it depends on where you want to move on to next as some places look for people willing to commit long term.  You said you like it okay. How long have you been cooking for? Can you see yourself being there in a year from now? Is there anything you can see becoming a problem in the next year if you decide to stick it out? Where do you plan on moving to?

If you stay at your jobs longer than 3 years in the earlier part of your career, you might seem to lack ambition.  You want to stay with a kitchen long enough to master everything it has to teach you, and then bounce.  Up until the point you've mastered your job, you are, in a sense, still being trained.  So the kitchen is still expending resources in training and corrections on your behalf.  This is to your advantage, not the kitchen's.  Once you've mastered the job, it's now to the kitchen's advantage, not yours."

KitchenConfidential,38a6wn,chefandy,1 point,Wed Jun 3 13:43:42 2015 UTC,"Commodity ribs go up every summer due to higher retail demand. Baby backs are generally static, and unless you have crazy usage, you won't feel it too hard (talking like .20 a pound). Spares should be about the same kind of jump. Other cuts are as cheap as they've been in years, so maybe figure out a margin capture on something else to offset the jump?  Also, you might want to inquire about a vendor contract if you buy enough to be worried. Rib contracts are easier to secure because they're generally sold frozen, so your purveyor or distributor might be ok with it."
KitchenConfidential,38a6wn,verywhy,1 point,Thu Jun 4 02:14:05 2015 UTC,Thinking about it and asking around I feel like one of the big chains is about to start advertising spareribs for a summer special.  Last year pork butt spiked past loins and everyone had pulled pork on their commercials a few weeks later.

Some restaurants look upscale in the diningroom, yet are run by morons and have kitchens staffed by inept cooks.  And there are some cooks who've been in the business for years who think they know what they're doing, but they don't.    However, if any of these things pertain, writing ""DO NOT OVERCOOK!!"" on a ticket isn't going to fix the problem.

KitchenConfidential,383vu0,augustprep,10,Mon Jun 1 17:48:26 2015 UTC,One of the things I love most about the kitchen is how caring for it can become a ritualistic process in a good way.
KitchenConfidential,383vu0,TheVillain117,11,Mon Jun 1 19:03:09 2015 UTC,"Deep cleaning can be very relaxin for sure, but for me the most zen part of my job is when we get really busy. I do sauté for a private club, and our business fluctuates with the seasons. In the summer and winter we are really busy, spring and fall not so much. But on those nights we are fully booked, my mind goes blank and I just cook. All the little shit I've been worrying about, everything causing me stress is gone. I've been doing it for so long I don't even have to think anymore. When everyone is clicking and timing is perfect it feels like deep meditation.  I leave exhausted from physical activity, but my mind is cleansed, for at least the rest of the night. Then back to the real world and prep the next morning."
KitchenConfidential,383vu0,thelateoctober,7,Mon Jun 1 22:03:43 2015 UTC,"I found doing the dishes at some places were soothing too, once you got the hang of it.  That is, until someone handed you a pan with what was once food scorched on.  Nowadays, I find this in prep. It's complete silence during the morning."
KitchenConfidential,383vu0,Arrdef,3,Mon Jun 1 19:21:24 2015 UTC,"I used to do my morning prep in silence, but recently I've taken to listening to bebop (Charlie Parker, Charles Mingus, John Coltrane, etc) during morning prep. It's fast-paced music, but it's not as intense as other genres of fast music. It helps me keep the pace up while not feeling hurried or rushed.  During service, though, I listen to thrash metal. After all, thrash metal is to rock as bebop is to jazz."
KitchenConfidential,383vu0,K4ge,2,Tue Jun 2 05:25:47 2015 UTC,"I guess music is fair enough. What I had in mind is that past the initial greetings, no one talks during prep.

KitchenConfidential,383vu0,K4ge,2,Tue Jun 2 19:31:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah, our restaurant (buffet service for student, but I often say corporate because it's short-hand) is in the middle of a campus with a housing capacity of 1400 people, plus a big university that I'm not willing to name; plus the employees.  We actually do a big, mother-of-all prep on sunday morning for most ingredients, and then some each morning. The menus are set for 2 weeks."
KitchenConfidential,383vu0,Arrdef,1 point,Tue Jun 2 19:35:16 2015 UTC,"Did you work at a sit-down place before you got the job at the buffet service one? If so, how different was it, and how difficult was the transition? I ask purely out of curiosity"
KitchenConfidential,383vu0,K4ge,2,Wed Jun 3 07:49:43 2015 UTC,"Alright, I'll split this in two:  Way more personel, and more hierarchy too  In a traditional restaurant, as you know, your superior is the chef, and then except the owner, there's basically nothing above him; here the chef also has the administration to cope with.  We also work with a lot of non-industry personel, like the cleaning crew for example.  We are, in total, 30 cooks, divided in three crews which rotate different part of the weeks, and rotate the sundays mornings. As I said, the deep scrubbing is done by a separate, contracted cleaning crew.  We have a lot more quantity to work with. That's why we do a big prep on sundays, for the ingredients we can preserve. So it means our food isn't as fresh as your typical sit-down place (it's still fucking good tho, for the price [3.50€ for a normal, three parts meal])  We have no front of house staff. Cooks cook and mann the trays which aren't in buffets for x or y reason.  Organization difference:  Wake up early, finish early  So sit down places can have a variety of opening hours. Some open at 11, 12, you catch my drift. They also tend to close no sooner than 21 because then you miss all the late-night guests and money.  Our facility does not work for profit. We're just here to allow students to have affordable meals, 2 times a day. (We also serve the on-site personnel, they come at the end of the service)  So we have to get in at 9h00 for sundays (the crews rotate, so I do 1/3 sundays), and 8h30 for the weekdays. There is no activity on saturdays  More bureaucracy for the better and for worse.  The student body I am employed by, if you must know is my local CROUS [which is manned by the paris-manned CNOUS]. This is a  french state organization which provides housing, meals, and is in charge of some scholarships. Employees have set categories in the organization, as a Category C employee I have a set progression and salary. If I was long term here (I'm not, I replace someone), I would have a set path and progression. On the other hand, there will be no raises outside this, and the chef doesn't really have the power to deviate from policies. He's more of the ""kitchen manager"", but his title says chef so well...  I've read on the subreddit about some differences with the swearing, gossiping, and else... there's not that much of a marked difference. Maybe because the sit-downs I worked at were too small for there to have back-biting ? But yeah, there's definitely gossipping.  There's yelling, but no obscenities. I work with slightly older people though, so that may be it.  If you have any more questions I did not cover, feel free to ask.  The transition wasn't that difficult. I got better hours, so I can drink in the weekdays evening now :P. I don't work saturdays and most sundays... I don't intend to stick around more than my initial contract, 5 months, to be honest. The job is definitely more stressful; it sometimes feels like a grind. The tray lifting is crazy."
KitchenConfidential,383vu0,Arrdef,2,Wed Jun 3 08:41:25 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response, I read the entire thing. That definitely sounds like a pretty big difference from a traditional restaurant. The organizational differences are quite interesting, especially the chef being more like a KM.   From an organizational standpoint, it sounds pretty cool. From a ""freedom"" standpoint, though, it sounds kinda dumb. Not being able to deviate from policies or get promoted outside the set path doesn't sound like much fun.  It's probably gonna look great on your resume that you worked at a place like that. I bet you learned a lot of stuff that'll make life easier in the next place you go."

Why not put herbs in the spaetzle and garnish with something that brings flavor and color to the plate. Some of the pickle salad dumped all over the trout would be nice.   While trout is whole trout. No starch or veg just a shitload of red radish?  This plate isn't even fully thought out. And either the edible portion of that fish is tiny or the lemons are huge. This is a total do over.

KitchenConfidential,385kjt,dr-Love420,2,Wed Jun 3 19:00:29 2015 UTC,"I used to work at a gastropub that did 60-70k a week in sales and we would run very nice specials on the weekends. It was our only time we got to be creative. It sucked because we were in a rich suburb so anything good would never sell because people didn't know what it was. The few times we ran tilapia it would sell out in an hour. Broke my heart, ended up quitting after a few years as the sous to work for a place that was lower volume with a less static menu."
KitchenConfidential,385kjt,zamouse,2,Tue Jun 2 16:03:01 2015 UTC,Its really too bad you didn't get to play around more in a gastropub doing those numbers. It also goes on the servers for not selling maybe? We have that problem

KitchenConfidential,386nmo,jay_emdee,2,Tue Jun 2 06:25:07 2015 UTC,"maybe try bagging it and freezing in small quantities, just enough to last you until the colour fades?   I wonder what actually causes it to fade, if it's an oxidation thing I bet bagging it right away would help. How long is a ""short time""? Is it not practical to make more during a lull halfway through service?"
KitchenConfidential,386nmo,beenjammin26,2,Tue Jun 2 15:23:09 2015 UTC,"Try heating it up. The keyword is TRY, you can keep avocados green if you sous vide them at 40C for an hour which kills the enzyme that turns them brown. Maybe beet juice could benefit from this same process? I've never tried it but if you do let me know how well it turns out. We've made golden beet ""gel"" in the past using juice, sugar, and agar which didn't lose color even after a week so that's worth a go, that recipe also involved heating the juice so maybe that's the key.."

KitchenConfidential,386nmo,Chigre,1 point,Tue Jun 2 18:59:08 2015 UTC,"pH change could be a significant driver of how your beet root juice changes in color. Red beet juice is a known natural pH indicator. With low pH compounds, red beet juice turns a lighter color. With higher pH (basic) compounds it gets darker.  Maybe try spiking samples of your golden beet juice with a bit of baking soda to stop it's color from fading."
KitchenConfidential,386nmo,RebelWithoutAClue,2,Wed Jun 3 08:52:34 2015 UTC,"Sodium bisulfite should work.  You can also use sodium metabisulphite, which is readily available at homebrew stores.  It's the same stuff used for preserving color in dehydrated fruit.  Just add at 0.1% by weight to your beet juice."
KitchenConfidential,386nmo,well_done_unicorn,1 point,Wed Jun 3 12:18:03 2015 UTC,Have you tried keeping the beet juice separate? Maybe adding a few drops of fresh lemon. I'm not sure.

There's maybe 3 places that I could really grow from in my town, but the problem is they are staffed and have been for a while.   I guess my question is, what is a stage? Should I go and ask to do one?"
KitchenConfidential,3858xn,chasmoffaith,0,Tue Jun 2 19:44:01 2015 UTC,"A stage is basically an 8 - 14 hour long interview- think of it that way. You go in and work for free. You get the see the kitchen, a typical day, how it works, and get a feel for your potential coworkers. It's important the same way finding the right roommate is important. These people become your family. Kind of like a first date, you'll know if there's chemistry or not.  And don't forget, it's a french word. Say ""stah-ge"" not ""stage."" You're a stagiere, and you're ""stah-ging"" (soft g on the first g).  When people come in and tell me they're there to ""stage"" or they're ""staging"" we all look at each other and know it's amateur hour.  Edit: I also want to add that not all of the stages we have come in are there for jobs. Some are just there to learn about kitchens, and think of it more as a hobby. We have our repeaters- guys that will come in for one or two days a week and pick herbs, or do something else low-skill level, and eventually we start to teach them things, increase their skill level, trust them more unwatched. It really depends on you and what you're looking for."

To me he represents everything wrong with this generation of cooks who grew up watching too many episodes of Anthony Bourdain shows and believes there is a very black and white set of rules on how food should be prepared. If you look at all the cutting edge chefs who work in Michelin Starred restaurants, they do not believe there is an absolute right way to do anything and they don't look at things as trendy or incorrect but everything as it's own technique and ingredient."

The bad:   Mirazur still #1 for France - really?  Ahead of Gagnaire (who was just voted as best in the world in a poll of his peers), Passard, Frechon, Barbot, etc... Still a huge bias towards the current 'trend' set by the El Bulli/Noma alumni... Narisawa #1 in Japan is a joke.   The ugly:    too much corporate sponsorship - are awards bought? descriptions show a lack of understanding - for instance, in White Rabbit's description they mention caviar as a 'luxury' ingredient in the same vein as truffles or foie gras - caviar is actually a traditional Russian ingredient.   If you take these awards as 50 most 'interesting' restaurants, I feel they're valid.  But not 50 best."

On paper, I know it's the right decision. I'll go from making $12/hr with no benefits to $50,000/yr salary, full benefits, M-F 9-5.    But some of my best friends have been made working in kitchens. These are my people, not the suit-and-tie office types.  Plus, I will miss the food. Cooking is relaxing and cathartic for me, even when we're slammed on the line and in the middle of a hectic service. Food is art; a painter might mix paints to get the right colors, but chefs mix flavors and scents in addition to visual elements on the plate.   I'm hoping to pick up a side or night job in a kitchen. I just don't know how to give this industry up.   I feel your pain, OP."

KitchenConfidential,385ymi,carsknivesbeer,1 point,Tue Jun 2 04:50:14 2015 UTC,You could use drywall screen if you want to go super cheap but if you are spending money on a good stone buy a flattening stone with it. The lansky you listed will be a huge pain. Naniwa or Norton make a flattening stone. If you don't have a flat stone your knives won't have a good edge.
KitchenConfidential,385ymi,Foodisgoodmaybe,1 point,Tue Jun 2 05:08:15 2015 UTC,Buy a single large ceramic tile and use the back of it to true your stone. You don't have to go outside and it's cheap.
KitchenConfidential,385ymi,malcontented1971,0,Wed Jun 3 07:16:35 2015 UTC,your knife is something you take pride in right? Doesn't matter if your knife is $50 or $500 take care of it. By taking care of it means getting a proper stone.  1000k/and 6000k is a great start and will give you a great edge. 600/1200 is too coarse and will grind down your knife way too fast over the years.

Done it for so long because it was a job you could do and still be a massive drug user.  Now I'm more or less done with the drugs, and living better.  I make a little cash, and like my job.  But I also know that, had I finished school or done something else, I could be making a lot more money and have a lot more free time. Hell, I could have a relationship.  I've never really had the time to develop a serious one.  Most of the ones I've had only last a few months.    So how do I deal with it?  Well, to be honest, it doesn't much bother me.  I enjoy my life reasonably well, and really love what I do for a living. I have enough money to support myself, sock a little away for hard times, and enjoy my various interests. Life didn't exactly turn out like I expected, but that happens for a lot of us, I think.  Now what does that have to do with you?  Well, do you like what you do for a living?  Do you get to spend enough time with your lady?  Are things generally working out for the both of you?  If you can answer yes to those questions, then what's really the problem?  That's better than a lot of people do in this life. As for your SO making more than you do, that's some masculine me-man-me-breadwinner shit.  It's the new millennium, man.

Get your experience. 2 years worth. Learn how to manage a P&L, which includes foods cost, labor, supplies. ... it's the store numbers. This will help you to interview. ADs, DMs whatever you wanna call them want to know that you can manage the business.  Keep a log of all the ways you save and make money. It will help you remember all the awesome ways you improve efficiency and bring money to the bottom line.  Good luck."

KitchenConfidential,381qey,im_crashing,1 point,Mon Jun 1 16:42:03 2015 UTC,Well as the KM the P&L is also your responsibility. I lost my last job because i trusted the GM with the PnL. He was cooking the books. I would do inventory then i would give him the numbers and that would be the last Isaw of it. I fucked up and should have known better.  I'm completely out of the management game now and an teaching. It's less money but I'm way happier! So i wait tales to supplement my income. My GM used to be one of my chefs. .. How the mighty have fallen.  There are all kinds of management books out there. My favorite is The OZ Principle. Nothing about managing a PnL but it's all about managing people.  Good luck to you.

Someone, I wont mention his name, Who is totally not reading or typing this... (I think they are buying it) forgot he had a little olive oil on high heat. When i turned back I saw the pan was nicely alight. The owner was standing there with a 'What the fuck did you just do' face. The dishwasher was panicking over the fire, and started to fill a bucket with water. The student at first ran into the pantry all in panic.  Then exited slowly with a fire proof blanket and a fire extinguisher. I took a lid and turned off the fire. Always nice to see who worries about the money.  Who wants to put the whole restaurant alight. Who didn't really read the fire extinguisher label (she grabbed the one that was for non-oil fires) And the one who actually fucks up now and then :P"

Olive oil till it covers all the cloves. Heat on the stove till it bubbles, and turn down to hold that temp.  Once the cloves are a beautiful golden brown, evacuate from heat and drain. Save the oil, garlic infused olive oil is awesome for bread dipping on cheese trays, bases for dressings, on pizza, whatever.  Once the cloves are a bit cooler, send through the robot coupe. Roast garlic paste is, again, awesome in tons of stuff.  Butter to room temp, into the stand mixer, and cream it. Garlic paste you just made, granulated garlic, and garlic powder, and fresh minced garlic. Kosher salt. Fresh chopped parsley for color.  Form to a log, wrap, and chill.  Cut a pat and put it on a steak just before it goes out, just like you'd normally do with blue cheese butter, but for people who are irrationally afraid of blue cheese."

KitchenConfidential,37xf6q,US_Hiker,22,Sun May 31 11:39:32 2015 UTC,"No. The visible light emitted by an object as thermal radiation at a certain temperature is dependent on its melting and boiling points. See Planck's law for more information. Now, unless this was at Alinea, this caramel was made with table sugar, which is sucrose extracted from beets. Sucrose does not have a melting point, but instead decomposes into its component glucose and fructose at around 367 F, which this definitely would have reached. Fructose melts at 217 F and glucose around 295 F, so the disparity between the melting points of these monosaccharides could have resulted in a redox pyrolysis reaction, where the carbon in the sugars is consumed as fuel. The color itself is determined by this reaction, so the activation energy of the reaction would determine how hot it would get before turning into products. As the temp increases, the atoms get more excited and as electrons move around, photons, or light particles, are emitted."

And I understand this might be inconvenient (or impossible depending on circumstances) but dad could take a ride to eyeball baby girl as she walks out if you know a window of time that she usually finishes. Your baby girl might not even have to know you are there.   And if you are a peaceful man without weapons and no desire to confront another human being, in a dire situation, a car makes a formidable threat and a car horn can draw a lot of attention if that is what you need to do.   I'm not sure what good it would do, but a phone call to you while she sets the alarm, and exits, she wouldn't need to have a conversation, just keep you on the line until she starts her car would help you sleep better.   Dads should always worry about their daughters."

The one I am thinking of has a button you hold when you feel unsafe and let go of it if there is danger, the app will then call 911 with your location (taken from your phones gps). Once she is safe in her car she let's go of the button and types in a password to disable the alarm.  That is probably a really shitty explanation of that app...."
KitchenConfidential,37yqz5,ecoevodevo,3,Sun May 31 22:32:12 2015 UTC,"There's also an app that you can set to check in on you in a certain amount of time, and you can set it to call 911 or text or call one of your friends to say ""hey, your friend didn't check back in after 20 minutes, you might want to check on her.""

Here's what I do:  Keep your head on a swivel; always know who is around and what they're up to. If they look sketchy, be prepared.  I carry a knife on my belt. Of course, it's only for show. I would never pull it because I would never try to fight. The line between fighting and getting killed is thin and can be easily crossed.  If shit goes down, stay calm and cooperate. I make 11 bucks an hour. I'm not going to try and be a hero to save the 300 bucks in the register. If a dude puts a gun in my face he doesn't wan to shoot me, he just wants money.  Have a phone/panic button prepared to alert authorities. They probably won't get there in time to help, but it's at least worth a shot.  In reality the chances of being robbed are super low (though it is fucking terrifying when it does). Most people don't want to risk something going wrong or additional charges if they get caught doing a stickup. They are much more likely to pull a smash and grab once you leave because it is lower risk."

I have just graduated, and was looking for a job in canada (I have a canadian passport). I was hoping for the Fairmont or any other group I could get in. But then I got OCLD, to my surprise.     Not sure whether I made the right decision of staying back and living in Delhi or would things be better If I moved abroad?"
KitchenConfidential,37za4w,petit_cochon,5,Mon Jun 1 04:34:13 2015 UTC,"Wow. You and I are mirror images. I take it you did your IT at taj? I graduated from IHM-PUSA in 2008.  I was selected for WMI as a KET. Did the whole 18 months and got posted to ITC Maratha. Spent 15 months and got so disillusioned I quit and moved back to the US. Having worked a few line cook jobs here I was never too happy working in India in those conditions. Worked a few more line cook jobs and was working for a Desi guy who needed help in upgrading his operations, and building a commissary, until he had a bitch-fit and fired me last month. I'm currently unemployed.  My experience so far-   If you must stay in India, Work in the Indian sections. Nothing you learn elsewhere is really applicable to North America. The Oberoi Group maybe is different, but ITC just cannot do anything else except Indian food. Get the fuck out of India. If you are really passionate and want to COOK, get out of hotels and out of OCLD. Just cause you got in, doesn't mean jack. I used to think I was the real deal until I got my ass handed to me in the USA working as a line cook coming from a sous chef position.  Being a cook / chef is not a career choice, its a lifestyle choice. If you are young, you have a good 7 years or so to really push hard, before you want to change tracks or slow down. Think hard on the kind of life you want to live before you make any choices. Work at a fairly simple place and buildup your line discipline. Don't just walk into a shop like Per Se out of college and expect to be a stud right off the bat. They'll chew you out in a day. Start small and work clean, and you'll be kicking ass soon.  I have a batchmate from WMI at your Delhi property, let me know if you need more insight."

One of the main reasons I'm sticking with OCLD is 'cause they pay for everything and I feel that the oberoi is a better brand to work with. When i went for the interview, I was really impressed with their kitchen and standards. They were very strict on that.     I do want to work abroad, I'll probably stick around with the oberoi's for a couple of years and then move on. For now I really want to work on the basics, don't really want to aim really high up just yet.    I keep my options open, I write cuisine related articles for a website and I try to do other projects on the side.     If I move out of here, is a private establishment recommended to work at?

What I have learnt is to ask for help if I'm not sure, and not send out a disaster on my plate to the service window. Not doing your prep properly is also a major issue. Have your chef check your prep until you get the hang of it.  Work in small independent restaurants to get a real feel for the industry."

If it's a legitimate condition, then you need to make sure that you let your chef (and any person working near you in the kitchen) know IMMEDIATELY that you can't see things on your left.  That's not fucking funny, AT ALL!  What if you're working beside someone at the stove who is moving a pot of boiling liquid, or you're the one moving it, and one of you turns and bumps into and spills it on the other because you couldn't see them on your left?      It's a medical condition, and as such, it's something that's covered under the ADA act.  Why the fuck wouldn't you tell your chef that you have a potential safety issue that's ONLY an issue if nobody knows about it?    In the long term, you just need to make sure that you turn your head to the left, and actually look around, before you turn/move to your left, and you'll need to make sure that other people you work with know that you have no peripheral vision on your left, and that they need to announce themselves when they're on your left.      Besides, it's possible, depending on the state, and the situation, that if you cause an accident that hurts someone because of this issue, and you did NOT inform your employer about it, YOU may end up being legally at fault."

It is a skill that anyone can learn and doesn't have much to do with individual tasting capacity.    You're sensitive to salt and that's fine, I'm not shitting on your personal tastes, but if every place you go makes the food too salty that's you not smoking cooks.  *FoH at a high end deli.  I have to know everything is 'supposed' to taste.

KitchenConfidential,3839wp,jbm5040,-2,Thu Jun 11 14:54:50 2015 UTC,"I personally want the food seasoned during cooking.  I do not want to have to adjust salt at the end, unless i like salt.  A pinch of salt can take a bland salsa to a place in the heavens.  The correct level of salt, is right before you begin to actually taste salt.  The flavor is being enhanced, not making the food taste like salt."
KitchenConfidential,3839wp,turingtested,3,Mon Jun 1 16:45:23 2015 UTC,"I think you're missing what I'm saying.  To the person who invented the recipe and most of his or her customers, the food tastes how you describe properly salted food.  To you, it's too salty.  You aren't wrong, it is literally a matter of taste.    Trust me, this industry is sensitive to customer complaints.  If lots of people said the food was too salty it would change."

KitchenConfidential,3839wp,Oneusee,2,Mon Jun 1 15:31:14 2015 UTC,"As somebody in a kitchen, smokers still tend to overseason. The ones I work with are mostly okay, they know they need to season for non-smokers, nor smokers.   Smoking hinders proper seasoning. Doesn't mean I have a problem with anybody who smokes (shit, I drink more than anybody I work with), but it does affect taste. Alcohol probably does too, I'd have to look into that."

The server (allegedly) told the customer that we were busy and wouldn't be able to fill any orders for half an hour. He said that was fine and ordered soup. Cue him yelling five minutes later about how the soup was taking so long and it's just soup and why would it take half an hour to ladle it into the bowl.
KitchenConfidential,37v29l,Marx0r,16,Sat May 30 18:03:54 2015 UTC,Why was the customer seated if yalls weren't capable of filling orders for the restaurant? Any manager of foh I've ever met would've chewed the ass off the host/hostess/server/anyone that's available to shout at.

I've had food thrown at me, pans thrown, been accused of single handedly bringing down what took X years to build. I even had my family insulted because I threw away too many carrot ends. this was all in an open kitchen too, haha.  Despite all that in under a year I went from nobody on GM to being relied upon every shift on any given station in the kitchen, something no one in that particular restaurant has ever done. I've learned more than I'd ever thought possible.   I think it's deplorable behaviour, not fit for any grown man or woman, and it's ultimately why I left, and why they can't keep employees more than a year. It was boot camp, but it wasn't a place to stay. hopefully you'll find this is something similar.   I'm moving to a place that can really use me, a new farm to table (literally) plus a small microbrewery, we have animals, local fishermen, everything I want to learn. No way in hell I could have offered these folks a year ago what I can now. So it was a means to an end that's for sure."

I can't stand these immature tyrants who use their kitchen as their own little fiefdom where they have a captive audience to abuse. It's unprofessional and it makes you a shitty person.

As for the dumping the trash out, this also is another team exorcize: all of you get over here and fix this. As in, no one else is going to let the team down by Trashing usable product again.

KitchenConfidential,37w7vf,chorner79,7,Sun May 31 09:16:01 2015 UTC,"I know that in the high end restaurants, especially in the larger cities, it's still fairly common but this type of discipline is cycling out of the industry. It's basically the definition of an autocratic management technique and almost every management study is showing that in the long run its ineffectual. I mean, imagine the increased cost of training people as your staff regularly quits vs. retaining trained employees. At a certain point it's astronomical. So as a chef, you really find no value in it. Instead you have to kind of blend up management styles. Here in the South, guys tend to be really sensitive. I have a feeling it's because they were raised so focused on ""manners"" and words have powerful meanings. Barking out orders is one thing in my kitchen, but I learned quickly that profanity can turn certain staff against you. It's not because they are ""weak"" it's really more of a cultural thing. So, I just adapted. I've encountered a lot of New York kids and inexperienced sous chefs (not picking on NYC just an example) who come here and have the wrong approach. It backfires pretty obviously. Generally, if you are NOT a Michelin starred chef and you think screaming your face off at someone is an effective use of your time, it pegs you as an inexperienced chef in my book.  As for the hours, you shouldn't be working that much. Simple as that. At that level they're fucking paying you crazy overtime. Seems like a dumb business model honestly. I mean, we've all had to work crazy hours sometimes to get where we need to be in this industry but always keep in mind that this is a job. You get one crack at life and you don't want to spend the best years of it standing in a kitchen getting screamed at by a small minded prick just cause he makes great food. Find some balance and always have hobbies or things outside of work (besides drinking)."

I would say that after 15 years of treatment like you explain I've landed with a chef who treats everyone and everything with respect until they do not return the sentiment at which point they are asked to leave. The cream rises to the top, everyone is plugged in and the team would die for him. It's not common, it's difficult to maintain but I'm never going back to the old school. It comes down to intent. If someone is malicious or lazy you have a problem. But if it's a lack of talent or experience it's your job as a leader to put the work into the individual to make them the employee you want. In many careers people get promoted out of their skill set. Many great cooks who cannot lead become chefs. Many great leaders are not technically perfect. I would say if your happy and proud of your end product then stick to your guns, get as much sleep as you can, eat breakfast and always look to have menu input. Good on you"

Kids in my city are very thin-skinned and take an honest approach - even if it's not harsh at all - to heart. I tell a guy he messed up and needs to do better, all I hear is excuses and arguments and their face goes red. Tonight I told someone they need to be stocked and prepared for service because they weren't and they took it as an insult. It's insane. I came from humble beginnings and took my licks. Get over it.  My worst personal story of teaching through being a cunt was when I was working the pass and the kids on the saute kept bringing me their chips in portion cups. I had a black eye at the time from a nasty spill just before a closing shift. I told them in pre-shift that if they don't tell me they are beside me with a plate I won't know and they might lose it. I also told them to take their cups back. Mid-shift I had about ten cups from one sautee cook and I just began throwing them at his noggin while he was in mid-rush saying ""Your laziness puts me in the weeds and therefore this entire kitchen."" He quit and told management I asked him to fight me. Not true. I then dated his ex girlfriend for three years.  I've gotten a lot more nice since then.

Just doing the bare minimum warrants compliments to them. Even constructive criticism is taken the wrong way as they take it as a personal attack. I'm sorry if your work isn't up to standards but unless I say something about it nothing will change. With the pay that this industry gives, you kinda get what you pay for: minimum wage for minimum work. Kids that are fresh out of school and as their first job don't always understand that this is a business and as such the business' needs come before their feelings.

Go in, work hard and maintain a few hobbies.   For soles - depends on you and your feet in the long run. I think all of us have bought a less than great pair of shoes once, mostly unintentionally. I use inserts in clogs personally. I recommend really good socks and changing them mid shift. It's time tricky to pull off,  but fresh socks and a minute without shoes on in the employee bathroom goes a really long way. Remove shoes and socks, let feet air our for a sec, new socks, 30 sec foot rub, clogs, line. I try to do it right before dinner service."

If you enjoy food and have a good attitude and are eager to learn, you can make a career in the kitchen. It doesn't mean that you will like working in kitchens, or that you will necessarily be good at it.   Personally, I wouldn't hire you solely based on your experience. But if you came in saying ""I don't know much but I want to learn and I will work really hard."" It would be hard not to give you a shot at it.   You won't know until you try. Do what you wanna do."
KitchenConfidential,37wgxf,NewBullLee,4,Sun May 31 00:12:53 2015 UTC,I'd hire you for light prep and move up from there as I feel more confident in your skills.

KitchenConfidential,37wgxf,gereblueeyes,8,Sun May 31 00:56:59 2015 UTC,"Yep. A good dishwasher will usually become a good cook. You need to be a good WORKER first, then all the ""cooking techniques"" stuff will come later. You'll do some prep, then perhaps move on to be a help-cook for a couple months until they think you're ready for the big thing.  Handling the stress is a huge part of the job. You need to show off you can handle it. Think dishwasher is hard and you can't do it anymore? Well, cooking isn't the job for you, sorry. :( Cooks usually see the dishes part as the ""resting"" time, where you forget everything and the stress fades out.   So yeah... I suggest trying a job as a dishwasher first for a 1 month or 2 and show them you're interested in the kitchen part. If they see you're pretty good, they'll probably try you in the kitchen!"

If it's still something you want to do be honest with the chef about your work experience and see what he or she says. Do not go into detail about your personal life. It's a big red flag for industry to hear about weekend warrior chefs. It may be shitty but it makes us mad. If you stick for 8 months, a year, and it's going well open up get More involved. Basically it's not hard to get in the door if you don't mind shit pay and shit treatment and you will very quickly find out if it's for you.

KitchenConfidential,37w2tg,burleson2,9,Sat May 30 23:03:43 2015 UTC,"But the food in New Orleans is considered Creole, not Cajun. So what you describe with tomato paste is the Creole version and should not be considered Cajun. The differences between the two culinary cultures is vast. Creole will rely on okra, tomatoes, and garlic more so in their respective dishes than Cajun, which focuses more on the Trinity due to the respective cultures who lived in the area. (Creoles included French, Spanish, German, and African whereas Cajun was more Acadians from Canada, mixed with Irish, and a small inclusion of Native Americans and Germans.)  A Cajun jambalaya will normally have the trinity and meat browned in the pot, then de-glazed before being cooked with the rice. It will be drier than the Creole version the majority of the time.

KitchenConfidential,37w2tg,dicemonkey,1 point,Mon Jun 1 03:48:58 2015 UTC,"I had no idea.  I just recently gotten into making jambalaya.  Is it sacrilege to use the trinity and tomato sauce?  When I made a large batch for a family meal a month ago, I deglazed with stock, added tomato and boiled, added rice, and then shrimp once it was par cooked.  Turned out to have an almost risotto consistency but tasted great. Disclaimer: I am mostly Irish and from New Jersey."
KitchenConfidential,37w2tg,jastermareel17,2,Sun May 31 07:57:28 2015 UTC,I'm open to criticism. What would you consider a traditional jambalaya?
KitchenConfidential,37w2tg,burleson2,9,Sat May 30 23:14:17 2015 UTC,"Start with the name,  ""Jamb""=jambon or ham, sausage, tasso but can be chicken, seafood etc.; ""ala""= a la, with or everything; ""Ya""=African for rice. Start with the holy trinity, add seasonings, protein of choice, rice, then tomatoes and stock. Cook until rice is al dente.  The dish is usually heavily seasoned depending on the protein.  It should be somewhat ""wet"" like a rice casserole so that it sticks together instead of ""dry"" like a rice pilaf."

KitchenConfidential,37w2tg,DoctorMumbles,6,Sun May 31 00:59:17 2015 UTC,"I think I'm seeing some confusion on this page, which is unfortunate.   First, are you trying to make a New Orleans Style Creole Jambalaya or a Acadian Cajun Style Jambalaya? The one you made resembles the latter, which is from the area I live. Drop the beans though, those do not belong. You do want to brown your meat to help darken the dish. Having the meat cook down in a pot and then de-glazing it is ideal to help flavor the rice when cooking, as well as giving it a nice color. So you want to basically caramelize your trinity after cooking your meat down. Then add your rice and finish off  like you did.  Creole style  will be the one people are describing involving tomatoes and garlic. You basically follow the same steps that /u/burleson2 detailed in his post. Just remember that the differences between Cajun and Creole cuisine are big.   And if you ever see a restaurant advertising ""Authentic Cajun Gumbo"" anywhere's not in Southwest Louisiana, be wary. Especially if it has tomatoes, a mixture of Seafood, Poultry and Sausage in it, or a light roux."
KitchenConfidential,37w2tg,hellobirdman,0,Sun May 31 02:44:00 2015 UTC,"It's a recipe I got in After the Hunt by Chef John Folse. I'll keep that in mind though.

KitchenConfidential,37w2tg,Marquis_Del_Taco,2,Sun May 31 16:44:19 2015 UTC,"I've been cooking jambalaya since I was knee high to a grasshopper.  We can argue all day if you want to put tomatoes in it or not, but it's not about that.  You want to know if your technique is right...  First of all, you need to brown your sausage.  Do it again, do it right.  You want the maillard reaction to be evident on at least one side.  Very small batches.  Second of all, and most importantly, when you add the rice finish it in the oven.  350 degrees and depending on how big the batch is will be your cook time.  There's a reason jambalaya rigs have that big ring around the base, and the oven will be your best friend."
KitchenConfidential,37w2tg,dirtjuggalo,2,Sun May 31 04:29:39 2015 UTC,"Before reading what others have to say: 1. No tomatoes? Jambalaya should have tomatoes. 2. Definitely andouille if possible, but I would also slice them thinner. More yield, easier to let it cook with the rice. 3. You could absolutely up the herbs and spices. I never add stock to my jambalaya because I'm adding so many other flavors. Also I'm not a fan of adding a protein stock to a dish that doesnt contain that protein. Although you could really use more protein in your dish. Specifically some sort of chicken or a mixture of seafood.  4. Based on your picture you definitely should up the amount of rice.  5. Traditional creole/cajun calls for onion, celery, and peppers but I'd also add carrots. Personal preference."
KitchenConfidential,37w2tg,jtrap32,2,Sun May 31 06:48:08 2015 UTC,Add the parsley and scallions near the end. You want them to be the bright fresh contrast to the heaviness of the rice and sausage.

The vast majority of the menu was frozen sysco crap that they were passing off as 100% made in-house (to be fair, they did that...three owners ago).    She gives me an out-of-date carryout menu to approximate the food, and I start cranking out food ""kinda sorta"" correctly.  The KM tries to get me trained properly, but the GM cuts him off at every turn; pulling me off the line to do BS cleaning tasks in the middle of dinner, sending my trainers home as soon as they get there and having me work the stations alone and untrained, promising to train me herself and simply yelling at me to go faster and refusing to tell me how to actually do my job... it was bad.    After a few weeks, she pulls me off the line and moves me to dish because I don't know the menu.  A few weeks later, she allows me to cook again.  On my first day back, the expo is calling for a chicken pot pie and I reply ""Pot pie?  We don't even serve that here!""  ...That's how I learned that they had completely changed the menu while I was on dish and I hadn't been trained on the new menu or even been told that a menu change was happening.    I haven't no call-no showed since my very first job as a 15-year-old, but I did on that job.  I shopped my resume around and found a better job at the very first place I walked in; I didn't give one single fuck about the old place and the new place paid me more, with benefits, and no petty bullshit."
KitchenConfidential,37tcuc,daschande,6,Sat May 30 20:06:42 2015 UTC,"I posted this about 2 years ago, it's one of my favorites:  I work in a busy as fuck burn and turn pirate kitchen. We seat 300 when it's cold and 400 when it's warm. Point being, we got a lot of employees and cameras.  So a couple nights ago this guy broke into our building. We don't have a camera on the point of entry he used but, we did get to see him staggering behind the bar using his celly to light up the taps and bottles. He chilled out for about 2 hours just pouring different drinks in the barely lit room at the end of the bar and appeared to be having conversations with himself and/or invisible people and fucking around on his phone.  So at 4:45am the 20 year old naive dish guy shows up with our 22 year veteran line cook to open the place for breakfast. The cook goes into the office to get the notes from last night, the prep/opening lists, and whatever the fuck else it is he does in there. It actually came up watching the tapes, at one point he looks at the prep list and lays back in the chair and stares at the ceiling without moving for 52 seconds (of course we timed it). So while he's fucking around in the office, the dishy walks up the line and sees the drunk guy playing the empty pots in the steam table like a set of bongos and walks by thinking ""Must be a new hire"" and even waves and says ""hey what up?"", walks right on by and continues going about his opening duties like nothing is up.  About 15 minutes later the cook comes out and sees some random shitfaced dude on the saute station with all 12 burners cranked high and a skillet on one of them while holding two handfuls of raw diced chicken. The cook asks him who he is and the guy explains that it's cool and that he knows the owner (he doesn't) while he's slowly dropping those chicken cubes as he talks. So the cook says ""Oh! Ok then, well what do you want? See, I'm the sous chef here and if you know the owner I'll make you whatever you want!"" Later he told us the guy wanted ""a shhhhteak inside of a pancake"", so he said ok, and went to the walk in to gather ingredients/call the cops.   He then proceeds to sear a sirloin on the hot as fuck skillet and actually pour pancake batter on the motherfucker. He keeps talking the drunk guy up about how he's gonna ""get this motherfucker on the menu!"" He bullshits for another minute or so and the cops walk in the back and take the dumbass without a fight. (we're about 2 blocks from a police station in a small town so they get here fast).  Our grill guy answers some questions, goes over and trims out the edible parts of the shhhteak cake, and starts opening the place up.  TL;DR: sometimes it's fun to have cameras at work if your boss isn't being Big Brother with them."

We were slammed one night and I was working fryers with my buddy on grill. We have a sandwich cooler opposite the grill. Buddy turns around takes a knee to retrieve a chicken breast from the coller and decides to be a hotshot. Instead of just turning to bring it to the grill he flings it over his shoulder. Now we've been working together for 3ish years, and the action didn't surprise me, it was how much he missed the grill by. It hit the metal back splash a good foot and a half above the grill, slid down, and into the abyss. We've since nicknamed him Cpt. Sabotage."

It started off early in the morning with a shit load of wing prep. Parcooked and then portioned out (like 2-3 hours of work). On the line around the time the game starts and we go from empty to completely full in a matter of minutes.   450 people have all been sat at once. I start getting slammed working the fry/app station and it just gets worse. We're running our midweek skeleton staff because everyone there is an MMA circlejerker/NFL fan and no one really thought about soccer crap going on...Anyways.. I get the first 15 tickets up on time and the waitresses just aren't doing their job. They're farting around, talking about last night and doing whatever it is young college girls do at work. We're still getting tickets and the machine won't shut off.   Another couple minutes after expo tracks down the waitresses the food goes out...and I fill up the pass again with apps. By this point FOH is moving so slowly that the line is slowly going into the weeds because they aren't moving the food fast enough.   It ended two hours once the game was over. Of course, waitstaff would complain when their food wasn't ready but the pass would be full of other waitresses' food. I've never seen a line go down that fast because of pure laziness from FOH.   Even expo was ready to kill someone along with everyone in the BOH."

KitchenConfidential,37telr,K4ge,7,Sat May 30 06:15:43 2015 UTC,"That sounds like a fascinating excel formula. I use something very simple to do what I think is similar, but your spreadsheet sounds much more detailed. Do you care to go into a bit more detail? Do you have each of the items in the dish (salt, butter, proteins, veg, starch, etc) itemized out with a calculator so you can very the amount and the cost and it spits out a total?  Sorry, not really on topic, but your description really caught my interest, PM me if you'd rather..."
KitchenConfidential,37telr,Gavin499,8,Sat May 30 07:42:01 2015 UTC,"Yup, that's part of it. I have the correct portion amounts added in so I can compare what it costs us to plate the dish to what we're charging for it, along with other stuff for comparing costs over time and what our total food cost percentage is.  First I have a box that converts everything on the invoice from dollars per pound into dollars per ounce (and adjusted dollars per ounce - more on that later). I have a drop-down list in a cell where I can select any menu item, and it tells me how much it costs us to plate that dish based on that week's food cost.   There are always gonna be variations, though. We don't pre-portion ingredients, so it's extremely unlikely that every single cook is gonna use exactly X ounces of Y ingredient for Z dish. The spreadsheet just tells us what it's supposed to cost us if we use the exact amount according to the recipes. We can figure out some of the variation, though, by going into the system and counting how many of each dish we sold and doing some math.  Other variations include, for example, the fact that a case of bell peppers includes the weight from the stems and cores, which we remove. The percentage of each pepper's total weight that's taken up by the core and stem is different for every individual pepper, so it's almost impossible to exactly predict our unavoidable losses. The only way to do it exactly would be to re-weigh all our peppers after we core them so we get an exact ""adjusted dollars per ounce"" figure. The closest we can get to that is just using the average yield to come up with our adjusted cost, which I figured out by weighing 100 peppers before and after coring them. Took a few weeks to collect that data. I then divided the total ""after"" weight by the total ""before"" weight to get my average yield per pepper, which is what I use in the calculation for our adjusted cost for peppers. And I did this for every single product we order that needs to have part of it removed during prep. Onions, carrots, cucumbers, celery, tomatoes, even fucking iceberg and Romaine. Took fucking forever to collect all that data, and get adjusted dollars per ounce of everything, but I'm glad I did.  Like I said, it's some nerd-tier shit, but I love the fact that my food cost reports are so insanely detailed. The owner and EC love it too because it makes it easier for them to do their jobs. The owner knows exactly how his money is being spent (or as close to exactly as I can reasonably get it), and the EC doesn't have to do nearly as much math to cost out new dishes and specials. All he has to do is give me the breakdown of the new dish, and I create a new item in that drop-down cell of menu items with the new specifications. Boom, a brand-new dish, costed out in no time flat.  Spreadsheets are pretty cool, man."
KitchenConfidential,37telr,Pavswede,4,Sat May 30 09:05:30 2015 UTC,"...any chance you'd share such a spread sheet so that we could learn how you did it, see the formulas, and adjust them to our own recipes? This is really cool and super useful - data rocks!"
KitchenConfidential,37telr,mizenplace,3,Sat May 30 15:52:38 2015 UTC,"Right now my only version is the one that has all of my kitchen's stuff in it. I wouldn't be very comfortable sharing our full spreadsheet, but I have no qualms about sharing a template version.  We're expanding to a second location soon, and hopefully more in the future, so I have to do a template version anyway. The owner wants every restaurant in the group to use my system for food cost, which makes me feel pretty good.  Fair warning: It does take quite a long time to enter in all the menu items, since you need to know the exact breakdown by ounce of every ingredient, but once it's in there you don't have to fuck with it anymore (unless you change the recipe).  Also, the figures I came up with for ""average yield"" are specific to the way we prep stuff for our specific menu, so those numbers might not necessarily be accurate to anyone else's kitchen/menu. The whole point of me making that spreadsheet was to identify as many variables as possible, so I'd feel silly if I didn't warn everyone about the average yield thing, since that's a pretty important variable that's integral to the process of costing out the menu.    Edit: I also want to figure out a way to have variable pricing in the sheet. If we have four cases of a particular product, 1 from last week's order and 3 from this week's order, and we paid a different price per pound on each order, it'll affect our cost for that item. The only way I can think of to account for this is extremely detailed inventory records, to the point where I know which case a particular product came from. I'm honestly not sure how difficult this would be. I do know we are moving to an automated inventory system soon, where we use this fancy laser gun thing to scan in the bar codes on every item on each delivery so we have a running inventory total. That might make it a little easier to input things into the sheet, but keeping track of all that product once it's taken out of the cases and prepped might be hard. It might mean new labeling standards, where we denote what case an item came from on the prepped label, so when we run through something I can go in and update the sheet to our updated cost. It's not like I'd need to know immediately when we closed out a case - I can just look for myself to see if the container with the last of X is still there.  But now I'm ranting. I'm kind of glad I posted this, because I hadn't even thought of the variable pricing thing until now lol. Sure, it means more work for me because now I have to figure that shit out, but it'll make the sheet that much more detailed."

Scrub time is zen time.   I'm happy I found the restaurant life.

I keep getting bitched at for not controlling labor, but it's also my job to have my staff's back and make sure the guests are getting their food as fast as possible. Being short staffed sucks; I run more OT and higher labor than any other store, but I'm okay with that because my staff knows I'm taking the fall for them, so they bust their asses for me until I can hire more people. Your kitchen manager needs to get their shit together and staff appropriately so you're not constantly getting weeded like that, especially if they know it's coming."

KitchenConfidential,37rrys,RamekinOfRanch,1 point,Sat May 30 03:35:22 2015 UTC,"I manage a pizza place, and we had signs in both of our stores a few years back that said a side of ranch was a famous person's birthday or death day hidden in some dollar amount. It would say something like: ""Cost of a side of ranch dressing for your pizza: $13.94. You wouldn't go to Ruth's Chris and ask for ketchup"" (Y'all can figure that one out yourselves). We obviously never charged anyone, and after that one guy got ""reddit-famous"" for doing the same thing and actually charging people, we took the signs down as to not appear to be copy koalas. Now when people ask for ranch without a salad on their table, we all roll our eyes in an over-exaggerated fashion as we walk away, then return saying ""Here's that salad dressing for your already tasty pizza crust"", or something comparably douchey. This restaurant is in Texas. I often get asked by customers what different types of salad dressings we have. ""We have ranch"" with a big smile usually does the trick. The funny thing is, nothing on our menu automatically comes with ranch, it's literally $30-$60 every month of food cost without any revenue."
KitchenConfidential,37rrys,robotwhumanhair,4,Sat May 30 04:37:19 2015 UTC,"Not trying to be an asshole here, but rather serious - you should probably charge for that shit. If you're going to have your creations slathered with ""redneck gravy"" (as a previous commenter called it), you should at least get something for it. If it's $30-60 a month, that's a new robo-coupe or a set of hotel pans or something after only a year."
KitchenConfidential,37rrys,Speedly,2,Sat May 30 06:16:39 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the input. Not my decision, and we strive on being cool with our customers. There are so many pizza places people can choose from, and aside from having a good product, we set ourselves apart by being the best humans we can be to customers. It's all about controlling the variables we CAN control, as often as possible. Charging for ranch is just a douche concept IMO. However annoying, it makes customers happy/helps them enjoy the time they spend at our restaurant. Not to mention, charging for ranch would mean all ranch jokes would need to come to an end :(  I do have a great story about charging for ranch though, the one time I did try to charge someone. I'm going to post it as its own thread here in a second because it's a good one and I want to hear everyone else's input."
KitchenConfidential,37rrys,robotwhumanhair,2,Sat May 30 07:55:37 2015 UTC,"Why is that a douche concept? That's very real money walking out of your kitchen, and unless you're running a charity of some kind, the entire point of the business is to make money.  Plus, I kind of view the concept of taking something that someone spent a lot of time creating, tuning, and making, and then throwing ranch all over it to be its own douche concept."
KitchenConfidential,37rrys,Speedly,1 point,Sat May 30 16:39:40 2015 UTC,"You're very right actually. Douche was the wrong word, I should have used tacky. It's the same reason we don't have tip lines on our credit card receipts, or an advertised tip jar.it just goes against our concept.   It really is incredibly rude, but like I said, it's something that makes people happy, however disgusting it is.  The most popular response I get is ""HAH. Oh... It's just a Texas thang"", to which I always (jokingly) say ""Although brown and fat, I too am a 'Texas thing', and I don't dunk bread into a seasoned mayonnaise pretending to be salad dressing"".  It sucks, but there's always going to be that one dickhead that argues when you to try to charge for it, and that situation always ends with someone getting butthurt. With Yelp, UrbanSpoon, etc. out there, the need to make customers happy about every minor detail while they are physically dining in has become crucial, especially for a small, local business.  In the end, they pay the bills."

If you're referring to my puppy comment, it's because puppies tend to like to run around outside. He looked like someone that hadn't been happy in a while.  He did make me fold, over ranch dressing. That's the best part. That's really, honestly, the entirety of the post. This guy went to a locally owned restaurant to pick up an order he received a $20 discount on for no reason other than his wife saying she wanted it, and demanded 12 ounces of ranch. For free. 12 ounces. I gave that guy close to a bottle of hidden fucking valley. They chose us, and they chose to strong arm us. That's not cool.  Had I charged for the ranch, I guarantee this guy would have escalated it, and I would have gotten a shitty yelp review. Because I probably would have eventually lost my shit.  I know I could have denied the discount and probably ended it all right then, but there were a few factors that made me think twice about it: 1. I quit for a few months and came back not long before this happened. I have no idea what some of the guys that had worked there when I wasn't around had previously said to this woman. The church & school price is not advertised in any way. 2. We were super slow, and it was Saturday morning. Why ruin her day with Pizza Hut? We did end up making the money back soon after. Five 16"" pizzas is a lot to order for a single family, she probably had her kids and their friends waking up from the night before and wanted to feed them, so I do thank her for calling us rather than a big chain. 3. I don't think that at that moment I could have found the words to deny her politely, due to how she phrased it.  I called our owner still fuming and he said I did everything right. He also told me that the next time I see that family's name on the caller ID that I need to put them on hold and call him, because he would like to speak with them."

However, we don't get pushed over by them. One ""yelper"" disrespected one of our FOH guys for how he dresses (dresses normal, probably pissed about his gauges), and our owner politely let him have it & reported it.  I saw no point in getting into it with him, rather depressing that's how he talks to people that he doesn't know. I'm sure his life outside of Reddit is reflectively terrible."

That's a typical discount for ordering a few pizzas. Churches & schools get discounts because they buy so many and it pays off when they want to do givebacks for various teams/clubs at our restaurants.   Like I said, first time I ever tried to charge anyone for ranch. I've given someone a salad bowl-full before, but that person wasn't getting a huge discount on their pizza, they dined in, and they were super funny about it.   We aren't a charity, you are undoubtedly correct. I just have no idea how to say ""no"" to people when they expect something because we all aim to be a laid-back, funny staff at a neighborhood pizza place.  Who knows? Maybe this guy comes in when I'm not there and gets that cup of ranch every time, and whoever gives it to him is too much of a moron to say anything to anyone else. It's not something we've talked about with our staff as a whole because asking for ranch in general is something we poke at customers for."

KitchenConfidential,37tpwp,smashingkitten,6,Tue Jun 2 04:00:48 2015 UTC,"Not reformatting it to be a dick, but I couldn't read this for shit and Im sure it will help others too:  Huge rant, it's honestly more comical than upsetting at this point, so I figured I'd share it here. Sorry for the length, no TLDR; read it or don't. A little backstory, I manage a pizza place and we don't charge for ranch. We don't charge for ranch because we focus on giving the best customer service we can, and charging for ranch is kind of tacky. We all try to maintain an ""everyone's a regular"" method of customer service. This is about the one and only time I tried to charge someone for ranch.  A few Saturdays ago, at around 12:30PM, we're super slow, and a lady calls to order 5 larges. We do a deal with schools & churches where they can get multiple large one topping pizzas for $10/pizza, obviously tax free (that's a dollar less than our medium cheese, not counting tax). After picking out her pizzas, the conversation went: ""And I heard you only charge ten bucks a pie if someone buys a few"" ""Yes ma'am, as long as you're with a church or a school, it's $10 and tax free for a large one topping pizza. Are you with a church or a school?"" ""I'm not... But I eat there all the time so I'll take the discount"" K.... nowhere on our menu or anywhere in the restaurant do we refer to our pizza as ""pies"", and it's really a thin-crust variant, so it's not even close to any pie that I'm familiar with. At this point I'm really hoping she doesn't come in herself to pick up the pizzas. Who says bucks? Demanding a discount... Jesus. I was hesitant on the discount at first, but hey, it's 12:30 on a Saturday, we'll make it back in an hour. So I agree to the discount this one time, and make sure she understands it's just to make up for the confusion.  How she heard about the unadvertised discount, I do not know. About 25 minutes later her husband walks in (I can tell who he is just by looking at him, he's not enjoying life, he just looks like a puppy that hasn't been outside in years). This is how our conversation went: ""Hey how's it going?"" (I don't even know why I ask this question anymore) ""Hi I'm here to pick up the pizzas for ___, and I need a bunch of ranch"" He raises his hands to chest level, and separates them vertically by about 20cm to indicate how much ranch he would like. Trying to decide how I'm physically going to give this dude that much ranch, I say ""No problem, I'll grab 4 sides for ya"" ""No I don't think that'll be enough, how about you fill one of those up?"" He points at the 12oz clear kids cups behind me. I stood half-shocked, half-confused (for FIVE pizzas???) and said ""Yeah... We can do that, let me just add a couple dollars here"" as I started entering it into the POS system. He then said something that made me cringe: ""Be nice, I'm buying all these pizzas"". Now, up to this point I kept my composure and smiled the best I could, but this mother fucker wanted to strong arm a small business for 12oz of free ranch dressing, to go with an order he got a discount for that he did not deserve. I couldn't take it, and got real with him, looked him dead in the eyes for a second as I bit my tongue trying to fight the words I REALLY wanted to say, and ended up asking ""You're getting a discount with these pizzas, correct?"", in a passive-aggressive way that sounded like I was just double checking. He agreed, oblivious to my hint. I then told him his total (didn't charge him for ranch), swiped his card and gave him his receipt. As I walked to the kitchen I reluctantly grabbed a kids cup, filled it up with ranch when I got back there (from the jug, not the salad line's squirt bottle), grabbed his pizzas on my way back out, and sat it all down on the counter to check it in front of him. I listed every pizza's topping out loud as I checked them, and said with a smile ""Aaaand 12oz of ranch. You're all set, have a good one"". He then walked away like a dead-eyed fuck that got his first victory in life.  As soon as he left, I gorilla'd the fuck out of a stainless cutting table and raged for a bit. I hope he got fired from his job that week for having multiple untimely occurrences of diarrhea."

Also keep in mind this was a high end restaurant - we did 12 course tastings at $120pp ($200pp with wine), and won a bunch of awards...    It didn't last long though - because of the pirate-ship nature of the place, it only really 'worked' when that one exec was there with our highly-experienced and skilled crew - once the exec left for greener pastures (and a huge raise), everyone left and now that restaurant is empty more or less every night.

KitchenConfidential,37pcig,rodimustso,18,Fri May 29 10:06:15 2015 UTC,"Start with things that don't cost money (and/or may save money). For example, ask if you can set a new policy to start saving the chicken bones and start making your stock. It may not have been done simply because no one had the time (or desire) to devote to it. If you do, then ask if you can. Then prove the benefits. Then move on to things that may cost a bit more money, but increase the food value (taste).   However, bear in mind that a restaurant is usually a tightly budgeted thing. There may not be money to buy the better, fresher products without raising prices for the customers. Your particular market may not support that. Be flexible and understanding of the owner's realities, but offer suggestions that you think could work.  Edit: One other reality to consider - pre-seasoned food is CONSISTENT. It always tastes the same. If the owners cannot rely on their cooks to consistently flavor the same way and to a set standard, then the pre-seasoned food is a safeguard. Customers want to know that if they order a chicken sandwich one week and like it, then then can order it 3 weeks later and STILL like it. If there is a high turn-over of cooks or the cooks aren't reliably consistent in their methods, then pre-seasoned food is the better bet."

They want to serve reliably decent food that is quick to make and not too expensive. They like it that way and are happy filling that niche. That's where you are.  Other restaurants want to serve GOOD food that may take a bit longer to make, but is better quality. This is where you'd like to work. This is not where you're working now.  Learn what you can from this job - the pace of a kitchen, how to multi-task your orders to get them out faster, etc.  You're actually in a good place for a first kitchen job. Learn all of the non-cooking parts of a line without the distraction of learning the advanced cooking techniques.

I fucking plateaued, there was nothing left for me to learn at my last job and while I was pushing to change the stale menu to a seasonal locally sourced menu, the owners fought me at every fucking corner.  I got real fucking tired of that shit real fucking fast, and working 80 hour weeks, and being blamed for almost anything that went wrong in the restaurant.  The owners there were nuts and nothing was ever good enough for them, and then a friend told me this restaurant I was already a regular at (because the food and cocktails are always on point) was looking for a line cook so I took a chance and staged there.  I was offered a job, I weighed the pros and cons and decided to take a job where I would be learning more than I ever could at my old job.  As a side note I have a sous chef position lined up for the spring where an old chef of mine is opening a new restaurant.  He is my godfather of the culinary world and taught me how to do a lot of things and create awesome dishes.  Also, fuck it, I'm happy in this new restaurant, the staff is great, the food is inventive and fun to cook and the chef always listens to input from her team.  Thanks for the input though, it always helps to have perspective.  Anyway, whatever you guys are a bunch of towels."

(Eg: wouldn't let me do schedules because ""I under staffed my kitchen and problems would arise"" her idea of a staffed kitchen was 8 cooks on a Wednesday, when we could do it no problem with 5...). Anyway, I joined a small Cafe, we're 6 cooks and I take care of most of the closing shifts. Love it ! They're all great people to work with. I gladly took the pay cut from KM to linecook just to be in a better atmosphere, I actually look forward to work now."

KitchenConfidential,37mint,8337,4,Fri May 29 10:27:05 2015 UTC,"You see this in every kitchen and it really annoys me. Most chefs smoke, and over the day end up taking around half an hour out of a 12h shift, or more.. I am one of the few who dont and found that incredibly unfair; I couldnt just step out and say Im going to take a moment.  Its not really necessary either to not have a break, its just bad management. The place I currently work is great, we do around 2000 main meal covers (probably around 60% have starters and desserts too) with around 330 hours in the kitchen, everything from sauces and hand cut chips to rolling and tying joints on Sunday. 30 min break for every 6 hours worked, free food from the set menu. No 80 hour weeks non stop either, everyone gets two days off. Im not stepping in to brag or to give some of you masochists a chance to jump in saying you worked 33 hours in one night, just saying that if you arent getting a break and decent time off it has more to do with a terrible management structure from the micromanaging of the kitchen to the rota drawing."
KitchenConfidential,37mint,DieselHammer,1 point,Fri May 29 15:01:40 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily - you obviously work in a giant kitchen with a large staff who can cover for one another so that you can have breaks. What about a restaurant with 3 cooks working a dinner shift? That's why most restaurants (non-tgichillbees) have a family meal before or sometimes after) dinner service where you can sit and eat for 5-10 minutes, then back you're back at it."
KitchenConfidential,37mint,Pavswede,1 point,Sat May 30 16:29:35 2015 UTC,"Dont really like responding because it comes off as argumentative but I did state we cover 2000 a week with roughly 330 kitchen hours shared between all the cooks. I do around 50 hours a week on the really busy ones, most of the time me and the head chef do around 45 and everyone else hits their 36 hour contracts. Busiest services are saturday and sunday nights, and sunday lunches. We have 4 pairs of hands on the line. Thursday and Friday nights we have 3, and all other times we only have 2. The kitchen itself comprises of a single standard grill, two 6-stove ovens, 2 fryers, and a hot holding cupboard with an awkwardly placed bain-marie centered  right in the way of the pass. There are 4 large fridges and 1 long counter fridge, 2 under counter fridges. The whole area to work is about 7x7m, no bigger than a standard family living room.  The worst places I have worked for breaks etc are actually the larger places with high staff turnover, the smaller ones are more caring to the staff."

I've had this job for 6 months and it has gotten easier and my body has adjusted but it takes time. So be patient. If you need to drink a soda or something before you leave work so you have some extra sugar and caffeine to stay up for a little bit.
KitchenConfidential,37nq25,chefgantor,1 point,Fri May 29 13:46:17 2015 UTC,"The lunch shifts where I'm at are about the same (8-4) and I always seem tired and exhausted too, but if I'm working dinner (2-11) there's no way I'm getting to sleep before two unless I smoke an insane amount of herb. I wish it worked the other way around but unfortunately it doesn't. Shifting from a balls to the wall kitchen environment to a quiet house is tough, my brains still wired and it takes me an hour or two to think through what happened during the shift and calm down. I try not to have any caffeine after 4, but sometimes you need a little boost for the last little pop before closing, and for the cleanup afterwards. I guess that doesn't really answer your question but I'd much rather be tired and able to sleep than the opposite."

Sometimes you just pass out after though. One of the big things is making sure you get the right amount of sleep and not staying up too late.   When I'm working my schedule will be, 8/9-4 depending on the day/prep. Go home and figure out dinner, if im going to have some fun, get the herb set and have a beer or two. Read or watch netflix and in bed by 10.  Only thing that will change that routine is if something fun comes up with my buddies or a lady wants to make the bed shake.   Then I don't care.

KitchenConfidential,37mroz,imhoopjones,8,Thu May 28 19:44:03 2015 UTC,"I used Cooks Illustrated (same guys) constantly when I was a chef. Their recipes all work really well, they almost always scale well, and because they get right into the development phase in their articles, if you do run into difficulties you can usually figure out why very easily.  Now that I'm retired from professional cooking, I still use them frequently. It's the only pay-site I subscribe to, and I find it's much better than buying the magazines. The search function on my laptop makes it invaluable.  The only drawback is that the cuisine is not exactly cutting edge, and you really do need to get the multi-site subscription since they scatter shit across three different sites rather transparently to get you to upgrade.  Other than that, I recommend them absolutely."
KitchenConfidential,37mroz,drays,3,Thu May 28 21:57:01 2015 UTC,"I'm a member with their multi-site subscription to all 3 of their products. I don't really use cooks country much, it's pretty much the same content as their other sites, except I irrationally hate the theme song and the whole folksy charm thing leaves me dead.  I like putting on random episodes of America's Test Kitchen as I'm falling asleep. The rigidly rigorous droning is super effective at putting me under within 10 minutes.  I like having access to the entire Cook's Illustrated archives as a reference tool. If I haven't made anything in a long time, I'll look up the Cook's Illustrated version to have a skeleton. Their version of the recipe is usually the most vanilla one around, excepting the times they go on bizarre, unnecessary reinventions of a dish for reinvention sake. Also, some of their ethnic food is horrifically bad (look up their recipe for pho sometime!) But generally, I'll take the CI version and put my own spin on it."

KitchenConfidential,37myx9,PowerKiegal,9,Thu May 28 20:35:20 2015 UTC,"I just recently moved, joined a Relais et Chateaux kitchen. I'm used to good cleaning procedures, but this is intense.   After the last plate goes out all food containers are flipped and then taken off the line to the walk in (each station has a couple shelves). The inside of the line fridges are then scrubbed and dried. The pass has all the plates removed, then scrubbed and dried. For the equipment, the stove tops are removed and taken to the sink to be scrubbed; as is the sheet underneath (the drip tray if you will). The ovens are opened and sprayed down to cool them off. At this point the stove and the inside of the ovens are scrubbed then dried as well.   The deep fryer is drained then sprayed as well to cool off, and then scrubbed and rinsed.  That's the daily clean, then there is a rotating weekly cleaning schedule on top of that. For example, on Mondays the equipment is pulled out and the back wall is scrubbed.  It's a lot of work and takes some time. It may not be the most enjoyable to have your head shoved in an oven, but when you stand back up and realize that even the inside of your oven still looks new... it makes it all worth while."
KitchenConfidential,37myx9,BoulangerMontrealais,4,Thu May 28 21:29:04 2015 UTC,I'm not sure if I'm jealous of that or not. Definitely more intense than what we do here.
KitchenConfidential,37myx9,Oneusee,8,Thu May 28 23:21:23 2015 UTC,"I worked in a place that was super hardcore about cleaning.  It's great to work in such a clean kitchen but spending 4 hours of an 8 hour shift cleaning burns you out pretty fast.  Then when the team starts to get good at it the bosses start fretting about labor costs.  So after the dinner rush they'll send a dishwasher home and rotate one of the pantry guys to the dish pit and have 2 guys run the whole line for the rest of the time the store is open so they can have everyone else cleaning.  This made some guys have multiple shifts where they'd come in at 5 pm and cook til 7 pm and then clean for the next six hours.  Most of the guys were culinary school grads and people wanting to track towards sous chef/exec chef.  The place has a good reputation and good food and looks decent on a resume but when the work has less to do with cooking than cleaning it gets old super fast.  They flirted with the idea of letting all the dishwashers go after the dinner rush and just have the cooks take care of everything for closing but we talked them out of it.  They also wanted to try having no dishwashers on slow nights and have line guys just rotate through there during the shift but we talked them out of that to.  Dinner shift was always my thing,  I liked the lifestyle, I liked the food better usually but I'd never been so envious of the day shift like I was when I worked there.  All they did was cook and prep and cook and it really did seem that all we did was clean."
KitchenConfidential,37myx9,BoulangerMontrealais,1 point,Fri May 29 00:08:40 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind, we have more staff than most places I am used to as well. For the night shift, we have six on line. Two GM, one pastry, saucier, entremetier, and a sous running expo. Everyone cleans until the whole kitchen is done; it's very much a team environment.  It takes less time than one might presume; especially with this many people cleaning. Also note that when a kitchen is cleaned like this every night and weekly, it really isn't that hard. For example, if you do a deep clean once every few months, it's hard as hell. If every week you pull the stoves out and clean the back well, well it's pretty clean. It ends up being quite similar to scrubbing any stainless surface.  To Jag, that's unfortunate. It isn't like that here. Everyone that works here is good. We have a couple interns that do simple prep, but they are gone before dinner service is over anyway. There isn't any discussion in terms of hours. A lot of us work about twelve hours a day, five days a week and overtime is paid. I suppose it doesn't take that long partially because the intensity of the kitchen is upheld even during the cleaning. Just because service is over doesn't mean that anyone can relax yet. This mentality is enforced and upheld by the sous running the night as well. We push until everything is cleaned and dried.   After that, we all sit down together to write prep lists for ourselves and the interns while shooting the shit and talking about new tasting menus."

KitchenConfidential,37myx9,fnq5000,1 point,Fri May 29 14:20:53 2015 UTC,"We don't clean our fryers because we've got a guy who comes around in the morning and cleans them for us (It's always been this way since I started  5 years ago, I know this is probably frowned upon). We wipe down everything,  the range gets scrubbed. Then we start sweeping and mopping from the walk-in to the expo side of the line. All the fryers, grill, and range get pulled out and swept and mopped behind, and the sheet metal wall gets sprayed and wiped down with degreaser. We also pull out the coolers/freezers around the line to mop up any fry oil that's leaked out or water from leaky coolers. Lastly the back porch gets a quick scrub and spray down.  I know we have it easier than a lot of kitchens that have to clean the fryers and hood vents (we have someone who comes in and cleans them too) but we've really stepped up our efforts over the past couple of years. Under the last chef none of the equipment would get pulled out except for once every couple of months, but now it's pulled out nightly. The one thing that pisses me off is the guy who takes his sweet damn time wiping down whatever station he worked that night so by the time hes done with that he might do the last dry mop over the line if he feels like it. Everyone but him busts ass cleaning trying to finish up, but he's either out back doing god knows what (he doesn't smoke cigs) or texting or just dissapears. One day he's gonna get called on that bullshit."

It's not being made to order. You can (per health code) generally hold it for up to 4 hours, but that's at the outer limit. It's not being made to order in most brunch joints. My pet peeve is ordering anything with hollandaise and getting something that distinctly isn't hollandaise. I've had it as bad as a canned cheese sauce that was written on the menu as hollandaise. Nope, not close.  For having it at home, I just make it in a blender if I'm feeling lazy, though trader joe's has a great refrigerated hollandaise that is super simple to reheat."

There is some merit to the fact that a towel is a contamination vector if it touches food and then sits out at room temp for a few hours before it's used to wipe another food contact surface.

One night the guy slipped on the stairs.  He poured 5 gallons of hot oil all over himself. He screamed bloody murder and immediately stripped naked except for his socks. This prevented most of the serious burning from affecting his body, but basically cooked his woolen socks into his feet.

Not this kid though, common sense was not his strong suit. Dude wants to be Food Network fancy and does the old finger over the spout trick...unnoticeably pouring booze all over his jacket sleeve (why wasn't it rolled up?!).

Where would a smart person place the bottle of alcohol? Away from the flame? Not MasterChef over here. Screaming wildly he throws down the flaming pan and rips off his jacket.

But there will always be a place for craftsmen.  Look at manufacturing. Cars were largely hand-built at first, but the economy of building relatively expensive things using an assembly line first, then robotic assistance later, made huge changes in how they were made (and sold). And yet, there are still thousands of skilled workers hand assembling cars, for buyers who can afford them, and for niche markets.    The same thing will happen with restaurants. Places that do large volume with a limited menu are going to get automated, and places that do niche food, or higher-end service won't. While that means that a lot of low-skill, low-pay people will be replaced, I also think that it will lead the way to standouts being better-compensated for their skills, because of the recognition of the quality difference."

There are plenty of kitchen jobs out there that basically involve ordering food and pulling it out of cans.   At some point you reach finer dining and the techniques involved to fine tune a recipe can't be articulated by machine. Lemons can be more tart than usual, require more sugar to neutralize the Caesar dressing. Or is there going to be someone that does all the fine-tuning and we're just talking about more machinery in kitchens? Because more machinery is inevitable.  Everyone has that burner with a higher psi and burns a little hotter than the others and boils water a little faster, how is a machine going to modulate temperature when cooking a risotto or something? How is it going to keep the stock boiling and add it while constantly stirring and tasting for juuuust the right doneness?  Like I said, maybe I have a lack of imagination but once you get up to a certain point in the industry, we will reject machinery for tradition. At the very least we will have hipster restaurant that use all-man kitchens as a selling point. If hand-made and home-made food is already considered the kitchen ideal, why would we move away from that in fine dining?"

Best as I can figure, FOH didn't make her happy about the bill. Next day when I came to work about 3 pm, I was given a lengthy and mostly ridiculous list of ""problems"" we had encountered on our random health inspection that morning.   I pointed out the obvious. When I call the health department, I was told they could inspect anytime they wanted (which I knew) and what I should do is address the issues on the list.

SO, a few months later we receive a survey from them - they want a critique of our last inspection. so i'm like fuck it, i'm going to be honest. i share my feelings saying basically - we were treated like we're some kind of scumbags during the inspection (in MUCH more professional words) and this was kind of disappointing because we were on great terms with the other guy, etc. and i send it off. didn't think much would come of it, but at least we were able to provide input.  i get a call a few days later from the supervisor. thanking me for the critique. apologizing for the dude's behavior, saying he must've had an off day. he is very professional usually and she discussed it with him. then she stated - which i think is the most important part of this shit - is that the health department is there to protect the public health, yes, but also to be a service to restaurants and that they wanted us to feel like they were a resource, not the enemy. how lovey-dovey, right?  so yeah, it's worth a shot if your health department is worth a damn. sorry about that bullshit, too. best of luck.  ..oh and for anyone wondering, during our next inspection, the dude was MUCH nicer. not spiteful or bitter at all about us essentially ratting him out for being a jerk."

Self promotion and the drive to stand out is stronger today than ever and all the social media tools we have been given serve as a soapbox for every jack-off to speak their opinion and act more knowledgeable than they most likely are.  And society now demands that of people - if you aren't out there, promoting yourself ruthlessly, no one is going to pay attention to you. I have a pop-up dinner series I've been trying to get off the ground for over a year now and it's super hard to get people to come and to reach out to people. It's also super hard to get people to commit to something (another rant for another day) and so I have to constantly be promoting myself through FB, IG, and so forth, though I'd rather not. Do I think I'm a good cook with a couple creative ideas? Yes. Do I think I'm some innovative master of his craft that is worthy of press and a ""following"" of people? No, but that's what I have to act like if I want to seem relevant or for people to want to try my food.

To clarify: FOR WHATEVER REASONS (MY OWN MUSINGS OR OTHERWISE) the trend of attaching a chef's name to everything isn't as popular here as elsewhere. Our restaurant culture tends to focus more on experience and how long you've been doing it. (For better or worse on that one, because it doesn't necessarily mean doing it well).  It's like early cinema. On movie posters and marquees the French would make the directors name the centerpiece in big letters next to the title, while German cinema tended to focus on the actors.

KitchenConfidential,37jj5g,Forikorder,2,Thu May 28 14:38:12 2015 UTC,"Some tips: try to do this by car. Save on hotels/hostels by sleeping in your car (obviously some safety caveats here, but I did it during a 17,000 mile 90 day 30 state college football road trip and it worked out great for me.) Don't waste hours of your life trying to figure out public transportation.   Get a membership to the YMCA: super cheap and you can shower there, most reasonably sized city's have a Y.   You can and should park at Wal-Mart super centers, they're open 24/7, they encourage travelers to park there over night and you can use their bathroom.  If you go the car route, fresh wipes or a damp towel to the face in the morning is an amazing way to reinvigorate yourself and feel cleaner until you get to a shower.  Always drop a pin on your car's location.  The cheapest gas in the country is located in Tucson, Arizona.  If you're anything like me your primary expenditure will be on booze.  And if you're anything like me make sure to use social networking to make contacts ahead: post here letting us know where you'll be and when and I'm sure you'll get a stage. Staff meal everyday, plus you'll get fed a bunch of dishes, plus at the end make a reservation at the restaurant and they'll probably hook you up. (During my road trip I bought maybe 12 tickets of the 25 games I ended up seeing, people can be generous.)"

They were on contract six to eight months, then rotated back home.  So I had contacts everywhere, and just couch surfed around picking up a week here and there at the kitchens they worked in. For you, I'd try to make contacts in the cities you want to visit first, and set up an itinerary so you know where you head next, have a place to crash, and a meal to cook.

Knowing what knife to use when and how is an immense time and effort saver. This video with Alton Brown is old and dated, but still helps. Study it and master it. Especially that parrying grip. That's the one a lot of people mess up.  Thirdly. Get your base sauces down. Master a bechamel, Cream sauce, tomato sauce, Veloute and Gravy. And while not Super important.

Equipment: Know the sizes and volumes of the tools, pots, pans so when a chef tells you to grab him a 1/3 pan you don't mosey back with a rondeau. Methods: know them and the differences between them, ideal cooking temperatures, etc. (braise vs poach) (shallow fry vs sauté). Stocks/sauces: know how to make a basic stock. Mother sauces = burn them into your brain, practice roux and hollandaise (cul students always fuck it up). Proteins: know to break down a whole chix, clean up, trim beef, and know of whole fish fabrication practice if you are able. Temps: know rare, mr, m, mw, well for each protein.

KitchenConfidential,37had6,SquirtManchego,2,Wed May 27 20:25:40 2015 UTC,"Hey, congrats on getting into George Brown, it's a pretty stellar school!  I'm in the same boat as you but coming from the other side (potential (likely next) job in a few months with the highest rated/most acclaimed chef in the prov) and aside from the standard things you've been told already (me too when I asked some coworkers!) I would add:   work your chop-stick skills if you haven't already.  They come in handy when you'll go through you fine-dining module, and tongs are a no-go.  do. the. damn. dishes.   Maybe it's just the culinary schools here, but there are no dishies and you're all going to be responsible for doing your own.  Cutting labour costs in kitchens also means losing the dishes where possible... Be prepared. work like it's an open kitchen, because you are definitely being watched.   coming in with your own knives is probably standard but do it anyways.  Here they send the culinary students to one store only to buy their first knives (lack of selection imho) so coming in with your own, knowing how and when to use them, and how to sharpen then, won't make you special but will keep you on the level.     George Brown is a great school but make no mistake, it's not for rookies and their wait-list is big.  Network like hell because some of the best under 30's in Canada are fresh out of school from GB and have ten+ years experience on you.  Keep your ego in check, don't be a dick and soak up everything they have to show you.   Then leave haha, TO isn't where most culinary peeps want to be (imo!), unless they somehow staged at momofuku shoto, and keep busting ass.  Or maybe I'm biased, rivals and all."
KitchenConfidential,37had6,foedus,4,Thu May 28 05:48:22 2015 UTC,"Here's the best skill to master before going to culinary school:  Not going to culinary school.  Find a restaurant or bakery or caterer or whatever type of place that really inspires you and go work for them. At the end of your shifts, write down in a notebook what you learned, what you did well, and focus on something that you need to work on.   When you've learned everything you can from that place, go work for someone else and repeat the process. If you feel like you're stagnating but still love cooking switch it up - try catering for awhile. Spend some time in big places, spend some time in small.   Eventually you'll decide if the industry is right for you or not. If it isn't you've saved several years worth of loan payments, as well as the time you would have spent fooling around in class.  Cooking is a trade. It's something that is learned largely on the job from people who already know what to do. There isn't anything a Chef at the best restaurant in the world can do that can only be taught in a classroom. Even the nuts and bolts running of a place, doing the financials, how to write menus and recipes - all of that can be learned on the job or in your free time.  I graduated from a pretty decent culinary program a few years ago and to be frank, I had a good time. By all accounts I'm successful and I'm sure I'm the type of chef that my alma mater would like to write about in one of their shiny quarterly magazines.   What they'll never print is the absolute truth: if I had to go back and do it again I'd skip the culinary school route and follow the advice I just gave you. If you really have the drive and lust to learn, skip the middleman and get yourself out there. There's plenty of places that will hire someone with drive and if you keep your head on a swivel and show that you want to learn you'll move up the ranks."
KitchenConfidential,37had6,qvindtar,2,Wed May 27 22:01:46 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice. While I understand the point you are trying to make I feel like there is only so much I can extract from working in the restaurants in my city. I am going to GBC more or less for networking and and to gain a more well rounded foundation of skills than I would be able to in a single year at any given restaurant in the city I live in.    Toronto is a much bigger city than the one I live in, so moving there while attending school will allow me to transition to city life, network with many more people, work in a larger variety of restaurants and as mentioned build myself a solid foundation of skills and techniques. Thanks for the input!"

The price of ingredients is marked by supply and demand, pure and simple. Take baby eels, for example. They are a delicacy now and here in Spain they can reach 1500€ a pound. Only seventy years ago people used to use them to fertilize the fields, and they were worth nothing. Not so long ago lobsters were considered sea roaches and yellowfin tuna was sold as catfood. So there's really not much difference when you think about it between the truffles and the twigs."
KitchenConfidential,37d459,Chigre,24,Wed May 27 13:11:12 2015 UTC,"The fact remains, for every good restaurant, there's probably several that suck.  For every good Italian restaurant, there's probably 10 Italian places that use shit boxed pasta, canned sauce and frozen pre-breaded calimari.  For every good deli, another uses shit mystery meat and dry ass rye bread.    I've had mostly shit gumbo in restaurants.  I've never been to a Greek restaurant that isn't worthy of walking out on the tab.  In Paris, most of the places tourists go to serve shit, inedible food.  If I go to one more breakfast restaurant that gives me fucking cantaloupe and grapes as the 'fruit garnish' I'm going to lose my mind.    Your criticism of pretentious places and Noma clones is valid, but there's equally shitty places on the other end of the spectrum.    On the plus side, if you wade through all the shit, we have more great restaurants than ever before.  Tons of places serve ethnic food, comfort food is making a comeback, and some places do experimental food right.  Street food and food trucks are more plentiful than ever before.  If I'm craving authentic Dim Sum, Kerali food, Breton crepes, Taiwanese milk tea, or Yakitori, I can find it in my city.  I want to spend 300 dollars?  I can find that too.

'“So Sorry - My Friends Liked This Place Until They Went with Me” 3 of 5 starsReviewed April 30, 2015 via mobile After a long line and quite a bit of build-up to what was supposed to be the best poor boy in Acadiana, I finally sat down outside for the feast. A fried shrimp and oyster poor boy. Yum.   And, oh boy, another Acadiana eatery goes down.   Maybe it's just me? Maybe I've just eaten in too many excellent and interesting places around the world (not to mention my own culinary endeavors) to be fair? So when asked by my friends why I didn't think it was awesome, I proceeded to explain:  The dry crusty chewy (in a bad old bread kind of a way) French bread was little more than something you have to get through get to the stuff inside. The stuff inside wasn't much better. Iceberg lettuce (why do people still eat that?). Walmart quality bland tomatoes. Slivery rubbery pickles that were more yellow than green. Some tried and true ketchup-laced mayonaise with Zatarain's season-all. And finally, seafood battered in a bland overly thick flour batter that held way too much frying oil. Oh, and their fries are cooked in the same oil, so it all kind of smelled and tasted the same.   They asked ""What would you do differently?  I then went on to pontificate on what I would do with the poor boy if I were to open a poor boy restaurant in Lafayette. For starters, a San Francisco sour dough boule, organic arugula, organic Roma tomatoes, shaved paramasian, lemon zest, a bacon thyme Tabasco aioli, house-made crispy pickle chunks, a zangy-sweet onion chutney, and seafood that's battered in a white and yellow corn mix that fries up with a nice crunch.

I read KC to see good ideas and to learn how not to piss off kitchens anywhere I go.]  If he can make that sandwich the way he describes it, he should do it. He should do it on a food blog and get the attention he seeks, or he should write a cookbook. And if he can't, then he should shut up.  Regional food is often not about house-made everything. I live near the onion-fried burger capital of the world.  These are not complicated burgers. You flatten a 1.6-ounce ball of ground meat (10 per pound) on a searing hot flattop, season it with salt and pepper, cover it with thinly sliced onions, and cook it to a crisp crust. Then you flip it over and cook the other side until the onions are completely cooked. It goes on a grocery store burger bun with French's mustard and mass-produced pickle slices. Sliced tomatoes and iceberg lettuce (cut, but not shredded) are options. Cheese, if you want it, is American and melts on to the burger after flipping.  Why do I describe this? Look at what the pretentious crowd did with this basic burger while trying to make a ""non-cheffy burger."" They hand-source a cow. The real burgers come from beef ground at the local grocery store. They bought a Hobart mixer to get the grind they wanted. The real things use standard grocery store medium grind.  They used three times the meat as their inspiration. They cook at medium rare instead of cooking it through because they're making a much thicker padding on the original. They made their own fucking garlic powder. you can't have pickles, but you get lettuce ""dressed in pickle juice."" And they charge about 250% of the price of the original burger.  And why did they up the pretentiousness on this simple food so much? Here's their reasoning:   ""We didn't want to do a chef-y burger,"" said Michael. ""Not that we don't love them, but we wanted to do something different.""   Po boys, like onion-fried burgers, are blue-collar food made locally obtained cheap ingredients. Not locally made necessarily, just what you can get the local store or get yourself. Cincinnati chili. Gumbo. Beef on Weck sandwiches. New Mexico green chili. Loose meat sandwiches. This could go on forever: taco carts, chicken and waffles, tamales, chicken fried steak, crabcakes, country ham and biscuits, a thousand casseroles and a million sandwiches.  People who look down on this because the ingredients are organic or not house-made deserve their lifetime of unsatisfying meals."

Would the faux-foodie reviewer who couldn't bear a po boy fawn over the ""John T. Edge"" burger while getting all sniffy at the original onion-fried burger?   Upscale is good. Creativity is good.

So I think that'll agree that it is about expectations (and of course money always hurt, no doubt about it) but I think you're wrong in asuming tat all traditional places are cheap and that all modern restaurants are expensive, and also that we put our expectations in not such a simple fashion. A burger might only put you down five dollars, but if it is the burger you have right after a great day at work when you're on a real high and you just stop for a bite in the way home and the burger SUCKS man, that hurts more than a lot of meals you've forked a hundred bucks for and waited a week for the reservation. (FYI if you change ""burger"" for ""spanish omelette"" it just happened to me a month ago and let me tell you, it fucked my whole week)"

Even made Conde Nast #1 travel destination in the world this year.   There's only a few restaurants I'm willing to pay the prices they charge. I can cook twice the quality food as 90% of the restaurants can for the foods I like. Sushi is really the only thing I'm not good at, so I'll gladly pay $30 for a sushi sashimi combo or a few specialty rolls.  Some of the best food in the city is from hole in the wall shacks. Sadly, magazines got a hold of some of them, so now they've doubled their prices. Food is still good though. It's not plated for the cover of a magazine, but it tastes a lot better than the plastic and wax food molds on them."

I'd say that while Charleston is getting a bit puffed up, it has an amazing amount of quality food per capita. You have to keep in mind that Charleston is relatively small compared to DC, New York, Atlanta or the Bay Area and a lot of other foodie capitals. Think about places like the NC Triangle area or Asheville. Similar in size but Charleston blows them out of the water. I could name off a dozen bars and restaurants with quality food and never mention Sean Brock's name. It's definitely a little ridiculous how a few chefs get all of the press with some great PR but The Boathouse and Taco Boy barely scratch the surface. Oh by the way, if you want to get your taco fix, head up to Raul's Maya Del Sol."

Story time, and its touched on in that article-  At one time, Charleston drank more Grand Marnier than anywhere else on the planet. The French guys from Moet came to town, it was when they were kicking off the 50 year and the 100 year. They had a big to do at The Charleston Place Hotel, Bob Waggoner was the chef at the time. He sabered a bottle of champagne, White Star I think, bubbles were poured, brandy snifters filled with Grand Marnier (Grandma to us), and toasts delivered. Well, all us 'Mericans shot that shit, right to the face. The look on the French guys faces was beautiful. Nobody had cameras on their phones then, but I wish I did. It was as if we had all stuck our collective dicks in their glasses of gold. It was hilarious, and needless to say they didn't come back."

KitchenConfidential,37d459,eskimoexplosion,3,Wed May 27 16:17:53 2015 UTC,"To a certain degree its true.  However I'd also argue that 'rustic' cooking also can give character.  Sometimes the burnt ends of food, the air bubbles in pizza, and any other little imperfection can add interest and make food more tasty.    My favourite meals usually involve cooking over a fire outside - veggies wrapped in foil, fish or meat grilled over the wood coals, etc...  It's difficult to get 'perfect' results, especially since the cook (me) is usually half-drunk, but damn its tasty."

The chef wanted them to be a little rustic looking with crust browned and bubbling and the basil torn rather than chopped. But god help me if I burnt part of it or it didn't fill out the corners of that board. Rustic should mean it looks like it wasn't made in a factory, not that you can't actually be bothered to learn to cook."

I remember people never really ate out that much, only on special occasions or if they were away from home really.   In my experience, all the good organic, local produce stayed at home and was cooked at home. Among almost all the people I knew, there was sort of this do-it-yourself attitude towards food.  Vermont is/can be a super expensive place to live, so I think that certainly factors into it. Why pay extra for something you can cook better at home using ingredients grown by a farmer you've had a beer with?   Not to say there weren't good restaurants in Brattleboro (shout-out to Anon's Thai Cuisine), it just seems that Vermonters have to much of an independent streak to allow dining out to become a lifestyle or subculture, especially when the best ingredients are so readily available to be cooked at home.

We do have an incredible amount of ethnic diversity considering the population but only in one county, and really only in about ten square miles, where there's several dozen languages spoken.    The other thing is that the state is culturally isolated, and the people here are not at all adventurous with their food.  If you want a guaranteed successful restaurant, sell upscale ""gourmet"" burgers or pizza, but call it flatbread, and locally brewed beer.  If you want a guaranteed failure, open an authentic ethnic restaurant with challenging ingredients...although Pho and one authentic thai place seem to be the exception.    Common ethnic cuisines we don't really have within an 1.5 hours of Burlington, the biggest city in the state, without going to Montreal:   -German -Mongolian -Decent Indian (we have two places that have been open for years that only exist for sunday buffets, that are always empty) -Korean -Cambodian/Laotian -Moroccan -Ethiopian -African of any type, really -Dim sum (real dim sum...there's one or two bullshit places that tried and don't do anything close to real traditional dim sum, but might have 3 or 4 halfassed pseudo hippie dumplings) -Hong Kong Chinese -Taiwanese -Chilean -Argentinean -Brazilian -Cuban -Filipino -Caribbean -Jamaican -Spanish -Peruvian -Portugese -Eastern European -Molecular Gastronomy -Traditional Japanese (kaiseki/edomae) -Jewish Deli -Pakistani -Cajun/Creole -Salvodoran"

I like to know about the wine I'm drinking and yes, unfortunately, the better the wine, the more expensive (typically).  What I don't appreciate is people who talk shit about other other people's wine.  You're not drinking it, so who the fuck cares?  Also, I'm not rich, so I budget shop.  Did I pay $50 for the bottle?  No.  Does it taste good to me?  Yes.  So fuck the snobs who ask if I know the winemaker or what specific plot of land it came from.  It probably does matter.  It's probably distinguishable, but if I'm drinking it, it's good enough for me, so fuck off."
KitchenConfidential,37d459,chjmor,1 point,Wed May 27 06:05:59 2015 UTC,"Preach. I've had wines that cost an exorbitant amount and maybe I don't have the palate, but it didn't taste too far off from the more affordable wine. I'd never shit on someone else's choices, but a simple Cote du Rhone 45 Parallele is about $8 and is a pretty decent wine.   We just don't see the utility in spending a ton on wine, when there are simpler, affordable alternatives. Granted, we aim for the pairing and avoid super cheap wines (If it's in a box, it's a no go), but we don't go out of our way to drop a bill.   As you said, it's good enough for me and I'm drinking it."

I live in upstate NY and recently went to a noodle bar after applying at a french place and had one of the best meals of the last year.  It was $10. I was alone, the place was empty and I just chatted with the bartender and owner and let them know how amazing it was.   sometimes, soul food is the best damn food you can buy.

Back when I started doing cocktail, there were barely 2-3 places in Montreal where you could get an actual cocktail. The vast majority of bars still used those Azbar/Berg liquor dispenser.  It wasn't too hard to set yourself apart in a world dominated by vodka-cran. What's that? Basil and raspberry puree? Oh my god this is the most revolutionary drink I've ever seen.  We had an entire line-up with high quality tea-infusions and that was back in 2005.  The internet wasn't what it was back then and finding trustworthy info was a hell of a challenge. We didn't know of Wikipedia and it probably didn't have anything relevent to us. Youtube was barely kickin it.  When I look at the scene today. OH. MY. GOD. It's so deep and vast and complex. I mean we live in a world where making your own bitters, making your own tonic, barrel aging cocktail is already played out. I wouldn't have the energy. It's like : Can't I just get drunk with people and meet girls?  Back then, there were certain drinks that would literally impress everyone. Today, you got to gauge where on the spectrum your customer falls, from the neophyte vodka-cran drinker to the total fucking cocktail geek."

KitchenConfidential,37d459,miseenplace408,4,Wed May 27 12:45:50 2015 UTC,"I'm with you in that.   Additionally, although I completely understand the aesthetic need chefs have to make their food visually appealing, there is a certain part of us that craves comfort food: looks-be-damned, flavorful, rich, fresh and well-spiced cuisine is what we seek. Nobody would buy a deconstructed pho, and my local Ethiopian joint wouldn't be caught dead serving their doro wat in a pleasing manner, but we kind of like that. Every time I'm in a place that stacks food vertically, or has herbs elegantly arranged around the food, I become more critical; I'm waiting to see if the food is good enough to justify these shenanigans.   The problem with all this visual food is that it can distract from flavor. Aesthetics should only enhance; they're not meant to stand alone. The decorative line of a sauce, the sprinkle of flowers and herbs...it means nothing at all if the food itself isn't flavored well and authentic."

I live and know flavor and food can and should make your eyes roll back into the back of your head.

It really is that simple.  This same exact post comes around every few months from some faux-hotshot who just wants to ""keep it real"". We get it, you're above innovation, and you're tired of really fucking amazing restaurants. You probably were cooking shrimp and gritz before it was cool, too.   Since you probably didn't see it the first time around about a year ago, I'll post it again:  http://reddit.com/r/KitchenConfidential/comments/22uims/what_is_fine_dining_today/cgqjpm5   I think it's very easy and extremely convenient that many cooks and chefs use the term ""fine dining"" as a pejorative - I get a mental image of them throwing air-quotes when using the term "" fine dining"" so as to exaggerate their contempt... ""Fine dining chef.""  This is usually followed up with some comment similar to: ""I don't need all that fancy stuff, I just want to cook real food for real people."" Or: ""I care about how the food tastes, not about how it looks."" Both of which I find particularly hard not to roll my eyes at, especially since it's, more often than not, coming out of the mouth of someone who a) never worked in fine dining, b) couldn't cut it in fine dining, c) just came right out of culinary school and they know everything they ever need to know already. These same people fawn over descriptors like ""rustic"" and ""sustainable"" and ""farm to table"", which are nothing but buzzwords conjured up in a focus group to make guests feel better about paying an extra 20% for some very ordinary food. Fascination with charcuterie is a hallmark of this crowd. They say things like""if you can't make an off-cut taste good, you're not much of a cook"", yet only ever learn one braising recipe. Beards and ironic-but-not-really-ironic mustaches are also common. It's more or less food hipsterism, and what is actually deep-down simply an inferiority complex coming out as condescension for fine dining. It's no more than a straw-man argument. It's all a very transparent cover-up for inadequacy for one reason or another.   It's all very cringeworthy."

Tomatillos release a ton of water when they're soft so the hotel pan will help keep it all from spilling when you take it out.  From the roasted tomatillos you can make a really good salsa roja with Arbol chiles. Toast the dry chiles in bit of oil then just blend with the roasted tomatillos until the whole mixture turns a bright red or burgundy depending on how far you toasted the chiles.

It might not effect the price of very small local egg producers (who already charge more), but if commodity eggs are the same price as your local farmers market, you're going to have a lot more competition buying those eggs.   I can't get a local producer to sell me a case (15 dozen), let alone the 5-6 cases I go through in a weekend.   We aren't even a big breakfast place.

The getting was good, and they worked harder to pull in bigger catches but they weren't very profitable."

When I hear front of house tell me that they are stoked it was me instead of the other guy, because I ""handle stress so much better and always seem to know what to do"" whereas ""that other guy"" gets frighteningly angry, I learn that being a man means being that person people depend on to hold the house down in a storm while keeping his cool.

KitchenConfidential,37aezy,Chigre,8,Tue May 26 18:16:46 2015 UTC,"The best way is not to rinse, beacuse it washes off the starch but sometimes it's just not possible. I worked in a place in which no parcooking was simly not an option (cheap daily menu ticket times need to be EXTREMELY LOW, like you have to feed them starter, main, dessert and coffee in half an hour. It's a spanish thing) and this is the seconde best way we found. Cook the pasta, rinse but keep the original water, spread and oil, very lightly, just enought so it doesn't stick that much. Then take the original cooking water and reduce it to about half of the liquid, so it's really starchy. Finish your pasta in this water. It holds sauces well and the drop in quality is very low. It's not the best way, but might be, to my knowledge, the second best."

I don't rinse (spread on sheet pans or a hotel pan, bring downstairs (or outside, in MN winters) and shock it down. My saute guy does rinse. His penne grabs the sauce a bit worse than mine, but the one red sauce (a Rigatoni dish) we serve doesn't seem to care: the Rigatoni are ridged and grab the red sauce just fine.   So...in order: What chef tells you, personal preference, time constraints.  And yes, we reserve the cooking water and use that for service."
KitchenConfidential,37aezy,EbriusOften,2,Tue May 26 06:04:37 2015 UTC,"Leaving the starch layer on the pasta gives its sauce a more textured surface to stick to. Picture a stucco wall vs a normal flat wall. If after your terrible friday night shift you throw your leftover tomato sauce at each wall a lot more will adhere to the stucco wall and get stuck onto its ridges, while it will slide off the flat wall and leave only an ugly red stain that's going to be a bitch to get off.  Also, if the starch is left unrinsed and the pasta is tossed into its sauce some of that layer will disperse into the liquid. This will give the sauce a nicer sheen, a smoother texture, and will serve to help thicken it up slightly as well."

They made more, and tried to complain to the EC that I left cold side with zero Ranch the night before.  Another example: Balsamic Vinaigrette.

Double bevel knives are standard western style and have the same angle on each side. So sharpen and hone accordingly.
KitchenConfidential,378bpo,chorner79,4,Mon May 25 19:28:56 2015 UTC,"The video in the link talks about sharpening for a 70/30 bevel. You lift the knife from flat until you can feel where the angle is. It's super simple but that doesn't mean that it's easy! It just takes practice.   I recommend learning on a cheaper knife and then just sharpen it often. I learned on a $189 Shun. I kind of fucked it up at first and didn't really get it how I liked it for almost a year. It's more difficult to sharpen a knife with good steel like damascus because the steel is harder and it takes more pressure and you have to be more consistent with your angle for longer time.   I actually prefer a softer steel like in a german knife that I can get the edge to how I want it pretty fast. I beat my knives up and I don't always feel like hanging around after a 12 hour shift to sharpen my fucking knives when all I want is to drink a beer or seven.   http://korin.com/Learn/Sharpening  (From their website:)  Sharpening  Many sushi chefs sharpen their precious knives at the end of each work day. Edge life versus ease of sharpening - it is up to you to balance these considerations and choose an appropriate knife. However, you should choose a knife that matches your level of sharpening experience and meets your needs. If you are inexperienced with Japanese knives and water stones, try to choose a knife that is easier for you to sharpen. Why so much sharpening? All knives must be continually worked against a water stone to be use at their fullest potential. As you familiarize yourself with the stone and knife, you may begin to change the bevel based on your needs. When should I sharpen? Ideally, you should sharpen the knife right out of the box. This will produce the strongest edge and is especially necessary for traditional Japanese knives. We recommend that customers sharpen their knives before they become too dull. Sharpening a very dull knife will require much more time. Stones can be fragile and should never be over-soaked. Over-soaking will decrease the stone’s quality and make sharpening more difficult. After sharpening, wipe clean and allow to air dry. It is preferable to store stones in a dry towel. Returning a wet stone to its cardboard box can lead to mold growth, which can weaken the stone resulting in cracking or separation. Knife Sharpening Soak or splash with water. Put stone on wet cloth or base to stabilize while sharpening. Hold knife with you index finger resting on spine and thumb on flat of blade, and three remaining fingers grasp handle. Start with knife tip. Use two or three fingers of left hand to press edge of blade to stone. Keep a firm grip on the knife, with shoulders square to the stone and upper body relaxed. Press edge of blade to stone and push along stone, exerting pressure as you move forward and releasing pressure as you return blade to starting position. Repeat this procedure, pressing the edge closely to the stone and sharpening a bit of the edge at a time until you feel a slight, even burr along the entire edge. Once you have a burr, reverse the blade. Start with the tip. Exert more pressure on the downward stroke and remove burr, or establish a double-sided edge if desired. Japanese-Style Knives (Yanagi, Takobiki, Usuba, Kamagata Usuba, Deba Knives) 1. Sharpen the entire cutting edge until there is a slight and even burr on the reverse side.    Place the blade perpendicular to and flat against the stone. Remove the burr with your middle and index finger gently pressing the edge to the stone and your thumb gently pressing the spine. Pressing both sides of the blade preserves the slightly concave shape of the reverse side of the blade and helps make future sharpening possible. Think of the motion as if you are ""pushing"" water off the stone.  Flip the blade over again and sharpen the shinogi line by moving your fingers away from the edge and pressing just below the middle of the blade. For optimum performance, it is very important to preserve the original shinogi line. Western-Style Knives Note the angle of knife to stone while sharpening.  Angle the knife to establish the cutting edge. A 10º-20º angle is suggested. A smaller angle will make a sharper, but weaker cutting edge. You can use two pennies to gauge an approximately 12º angle. Use this trick to help measure a consistent angle until you feel confident in sharpening.   Please also visit our youtube channel as our knife sharpeners teach their viewers on how to sharpen western style & traditional japanese style knives!"
KitchenConfidential,378bpo,securicorscares,1 point,Mon May 25 20:39:45 2015 UTC,"Makes no sense to try and soak only one side. The water will penetrate all the way through, like a sponge.  I keep my stones in water permanently except the one splash-n-go I have. Soak away."

You have to soak both sides in order for it to work properly.   Now, the difference between a single and double bevel is that on a single bevel only one side is sharpened. Think of it as a V turned so one side is at 90 degrees. A double bevel is sharpened on both sides  to form a V. You want to keep your angles the same and consistant on both sides. If it is a European knife then it will most likely be around 20 degrees for each side. If it is Japanese it will be around 15-16."

KitchenConfidential,378hng,sammalonespitbull,6,Mon May 25 19:08:20 2015 UTC,"Server/bartender of over a decade here.    First off, with a table of 5 or more, I always ask if checks are going to be split, so that usually prevents any confusion as to whom had what.     I have seen it take 20 to 30 minutes to split a bill. It is wasted time and annoying when the pos system should be easily able to handle it.    The POS can take a minute or two for each credit card, usually they are faster than that, but it does happen.  Multiply that by 8 or 9, and that can add up.  Then you have to make change for the people that pay cash, then you have to make sure you are giving the right change to the right order.    It is quite easy to make a mistake while splitting checks on a POS.  Often times, a manager is needed to correct the mistake, and that takes time.  Also, the fact that everyone wants to pay separate isn't as important as running hot food to tables, seating guest that are arriving, or running drinks, in other words, a split check just isn't a top priority, nor should it be.  We are doing you a favor, it's not required that we do split checks and some places have policies against splitting a check more than 4,5, or 6 ways.  Do you think I am going to let a $15 martini or a $35 plate of food sit there while I run 11 credit cards?   No way.  I'm catching everyone else up first, then dealing with closing out a ticket.    Also, think about 5,6,7, or even 10 people all giving YOU their credit/debit cards, and cash.  A good server will make sure they are keeping that shit organized and in order.  It's stressful handling other people's money in the midst of chaos.  Staying organized takes a little bit extra time, but it's worth it."
KitchenConfidential,378hng,Jake_Maple,1 point,Mon May 25 20:17:18 2015 UTC,If a place  has a policy and it's  on the menu that is fine. I have no problem  with that. I appreciate  whrn they ask up front like you do.  I'm just curious why more don't.  Or when  I  am out to dinner with my roommates it is 3 males we aleays want separate  checks but they never ask.   I also  get that is not the biggest  priority  and i have no problem with  waiting. But i would prefer that servers ask first.  It's  much easier on the booze side. If people  alternate  payig for a full round. But with food there can be a lot variance. If i have a $15 entree and a $3 iced  tea i don't  want to pay for  someone  elses crazy appetizers  and  dessert and sangria.   I appreciate  that it isn't  the biggest priority.  But it just  wastes time.
KitchenConfidential,378hng,Jake_Maple,3,Mon May 25 21:26:47 2015 UTC,"I'm just curious why more don't   Inexperience would be a big one.  Sometimes servers forget, not an excuse, but surely some great servers will forget to ask this question.   But it just wastes time.   Yours and the servers.  Don't forget that maybe it's too late to turn the table over again anyways, so closing out 9 split checks isn't going to ""waste"" any of the restaurants time.     But with food there can be a lot variance. If i have a $15 entree and a $3 iced tea i don't want to pay for someone elses crazy appetizers and dessert and sangria.   Fair enough, I completely understand.  The thing is, how is the server supposed to know that?  Yes, by asking, but the table could make a point of saying something too.  Do you know how confusing large groups can be?  It's fucking crazy sometimes.  They don't listen/pay attention to anything the server says, so the server has to repeat soups, specials, and any other info over and over and over....that's a waste of time too.  People will switch seats, play musical chairs, rest coats and purses on chairs, making it look like someone is sitting there, sometimes large groups are broken down into families and those family members aren't all sitting near eachother.  The worst is when people don't even remember what in hell they ordered.    Again, asking a server to stay completely organized for a large group isn't like you're asking for the world, but don't be surprised when the server needs time to get this shit sorted out.  POS systems have their quirks too, they can lag, they can time out, or they can be a bit confusing for someone new to that particular system.     But i would prefer that servers ask first.    Again, in a perfect world, servers would always do this.  Just try making it clear, if the server doesn't ask and just starts taking drink/food orders, that you want the check split whichever way is best for your group."
KitchenConfidential,378hng,MUH_HUGBOX,1 point,Mon May 25 23:17:09 2015 UTC,Whenever  we split checks we wrap the receipt  around the specific credit card or write  the amount  to chwrge on the back.  I agree it can be stressful  to handle other people's  money. But i always  doublecheck after.
KitchenConfidential,378hng,Jake_Maple,2,Mon May 25 21:28:25 2015 UTC,"It's way easier in my opinion to just get the whole check, and workout a ballpark estimate of what everyone owes.  Round to the nearest 5.  Then add tip to that.  Let the server know how much gets charged on each card.  If you can't handle this find better friends."
KitchenConfidential,378hng,Patrol2,1 point,Mon May 25 21:44:45 2015 UTC,I can handle it.  I  am just asking  a question.  I just don't  like  wasting  time  and was wondering  if it was a technology  limitation  or other reason.
KitchenConfidential,378hng,shutts67,2,Tue May 26 06:27:49 2015 UTC,"That's a great way of doing it, and I usually do the same thing.  I am just stressing that there is a lot more pressure handling someone's cash/credit card than their dirty dishes.  I little extra time/care goes a long way."
KitchenConfidential,378hng,Patrol2,5,Mon May 25 23:04:27 2015 UTC,"It would be a lot of extra work for the server on the front end. It would require pretty thorough note taking when tableside, and then either barraging the kitchen with multiple small separate orders rapidfire, or sending in one large and then taking a few minutes to split it all out afterward. This would all be fine during off peak hours, but when it's in the middle of a busy shift, as a server you really have to ration your time, and going through the process doesn't really make sense, especially because you don't know ahead of time when people are going to be paying seperately. Handing the table one large bill and having them split it up themselves takes some of the work off a busy servers hands.  Also I've found that 100 out of 100 times, if you ask a large group whether they want seperate checks, they say yes, even if some are paying cash, which just creates more work for you."

That depends on the POS. I've worked places where you ring in seat 1, hit a button ""NEW SEAT"" then do seat 2, hit the button, seat 3. Table hits the kitchen at the same time, no issues. If you work in a place that doesn't do seat numbers, that fucking sucks."
KitchenConfidential,378hng,ChefGuru,1 point,Wed May 27 02:11:53 2015 UTC,Not bullshit. The pos at the place I work has absolutely no support for seat numbers.

KitchenConfidential,378hng,mentirosa_atx,5,Mon May 25 21:21:00 2015 UTC,Every system I've ever used treats a table as one unit.
KitchenConfidential,378hng,mentirosa_atx,2,Mon May 25 21:22:17 2015 UTC,Wow that must  be  frustrating.  It seems like there should be an easier way to do it. Technology has advanced enough  to do this. I understand  more now.
KitchenConfidential,378hng,lechef,4,Mon May 25 21:33:06 2015 UTC,"Technology may have advanced, but very few people are using the newest technology.  If a place is more than 5 years old, they're probably using software that is even a few years older than they are, depending on where they got their systems.  It also depends on the POS system that they're using, to begin with.. they're all different."
KitchenConfidential,378hng,sadi89,3,Mon May 25 22:23:01 2015 UTC,"It's POS systems that limit this, not your server's math or organizational abilities. The way I ring in my orders(by seat number) keeps most items organized by who orders them. And splitting checks is fairly easy, it's actually just time consuming. There are little limitations from POS to POS, too-- for example, the current one I use doesn't allow you to split individual items, and if there were any comps on the check(let's say I sent something out as a birthday gift) and you split the check after, the comp will disappear. So I have to grab my manager again. Now consider that you and your friends are not the only one of my tables that wants a split check... it adds up.  Trust me, if there were a method of doing this faster, your server would have figured it out. We like turning tables, too."
KitchenConfidential,378hng,sadi89,-2,Mon May 25 21:25:53 2015 UTC,But they don't  explain that upfront or ask. I get their may be limitations on thr system  but there is no way  the customer  would know that.
KitchenConfidential,378hng,citrus_sugar,3,Mon May 25 21:30:12 2015 UTC,"lol ""they""  I always ask larger parties, especially if guests are younger, and explain that I can't split items. But that doesn't make the process any faster...? You can't ring things in on separate checks as you go because of the way the POS sends tickets to the kitchen. You can only split seats onto separate checks after you've rung everything in... and it doesn't matter at what point after that you do it, it takes the same ""annoying"" amount of time. Sorry?"

Dishies have a pretty demanding and hectic job and it is one of the most integral to the kitchen running smoothly. If it such a prestigious restaurant then it is going to be busy. You, being someone off the street with no experience, are a monkey wrench waiting to be thrown in their operation. The manager may have simply hired someone more experienced."
KitchenConfidential,374fsx,kingswee,4,Sun May 24 20:14:41 2015 UTC,"Oh, absolutely. I'm not put off by the fact that I didn't get hired, really. I'm not the type to be deterred easily, and I know that someone with no kitchen experience isn't going to be the top choice. The thing that bothered me was the lack of communication between me and the kitchen manager. I found it a bit unprofessional to tell me to come in on a certain day, cancel, reschedule, and cancel again, especially since he didn't notify me that any of that was going on until I basically forced his hand. That was the worrying thing thing to me. I felt a bit taken advantage of. That being said, if that's just kind of how it is in this industry, I can accept that, learn from the experience, and move on."

Email correspondence with prospective dishwashers is the least of his priorities. And if you're concerned about being treated with respect and reverence, you will not do well in the restaurant business. It is high paced and stressful industry. We don't have time for pleasantries and niceties with our colleagues. And you're not even a dishwasher yet.   I had a dishwasher come to me once, a 19 year old kid, to tell me that he doesn't like having orders yelled at him, and he felt he should be treated with more respect. I fired him."

KitchenConfidential,374fsx,pefyeah,11,Mon May 25 00:24:25 2015 UTC,"I don't mean that it's ok to be rude to each other. But we don't often have the time to politely explain to someone that you need something done in 60 seconds to finish a table that is going out. Yelling a quick order so everyone can hear over the hoods and dishwasher and waiters is usually the only choice. And in that situation, people know they aren't being yelled at out of malice. But that it's out of necessity.   And the dishwasher that I fired was a huge pain in the ass. I didn't just fire him for asking for respect. He was a lazy entitled rich kid, whose parents gave him the ultimatum of finding a job, or moving out. He figured he'd get a job, and work as little as possible. After telling me to schedule him full time. After two days he'd start calling out because he didn't feel well. Then he'd start tearing up halfway through shifts, crying that his stomach hurt and he wanted to go home. The rest of my small kitchen staff work full time, and are insanely dedicated and hard working. They didn't like the dishwasher. So when he came in for a shift after calling out for the previous three, and started by pulling me, the executive chef, off the line in the middle of a busy Friday night to say he doesn't think the rest of the kitchen staff respect him enough, I just laughed and told him to leave.   Two weeks later we found out our hard working 17 year old busboy was the dishwasher's younger brother. He never told anyone because he was so embarrassed of his lazy older brother."

KitchenConfidential,374fsx,MUH_HUGBOX,-1,Mon May 25 01:25:23 2015 UTC,"That's good. Because it takes an open mind and a flexible person to be successful in the hospitality industry. There are more than one way to skin a cat, but in the restaurant business every chef and owner are convinced their way is the only way to do things. Being able to follow orders without giving opinions is a highly respected quality."
KitchenConfidential,374fsx,MUH_HUGBOX,2,Mon May 25 01:28:34 2015 UTC,"That's good. It's a quality I definitely posses. Maybe the kitchen is for me after all.   Again, I really do appreciate your feedback."
KitchenConfidential,374fsx,MUH_HUGBOX,8,Mon May 25 03:06:35 2015 UTC,"He probably found someone else with relevant experience.  He probably is very busy.  He probably doesn't care what the lady in HR thinks about you as a person or how good of a job you do teaching her son, and just wanted someone who could hit the ground running with minimal supervision on his part.  He probably hired a Latino."
KitchenConfidential,374fsx,MUH_HUGBOX,1 point,Sun May 24 20:16:14 2015 UTC,"So this is normal, then? I shouldn't be worried?"
KitchenConfidential,374fsx,cool_hand_luke,8,Sun May 24 20:22:10 2015 UTC,"Well the way he kind of strung you along was kind of dickish, but that's pretty par for course with any kind of job application in any industry where they say they'll call you and then just never contact you.  Also I think starting at dish at the best place in town isn't necessarily the best move.  You're going in there with the expectation of being moved up, right?  Thing is, if you're a bomb ass dishwasher they have no incentive to move you up and every incentive to keep you doing what you're doing well.  They don't want to worry about having to replace you.  That's why the Latino comment...they want a cog in their machine that they won't have to worry about being too ambitious or wanting more from the job.  I think if you really want to break in you might try for an extended stage, maybe one or two days a week, doing actual prep work or something.  Again, this could lead to you getting strung along working for free for longer than you would like, but it would give you some experience and some insight into what the kitchen life is like."
KitchenConfidential,374fsx,cool_hand_luke,1 point,Sun May 24 20:29:44 2015 UTC,"Shit. I made a typo in my post that probably led to some pretty big misunderstandings.   I actually don't expect to be moved up from anything anytime soon, especially with no experience. I understand how many people out there are more qualified than me, and I'm fully prepared to pay my dues and be a dishie for however long I need to be before I'm fully ready to move up.   This was my first choice, partly because I thought I would get such good experience, and partly because I would've been making 1.50 an hour more than I am as a preschool teacher, plus benefits with the dishie job."
KitchenConfidential,374fsx,chorner79,7,Sun May 24 20:40:05 2015 UTC,"That's fucking insane that you would make more as a dishie than at a job that (I presume) requires a 4 year degree.  Fuck man, why the fuck didn't you use your connection in HR for a FOH gig?  That's where the money is anyway."
KitchenConfidential,374fsx,chorner79,2,Sun May 24 20:45:28 2015 UTC,"Really? Huh. I didn't know that. There's actually a FOH job open there right now that I was thinking of applying for, but I thought they didn't make as much as BOH. Dish pit is 10 an hour, FOH would be 6.50 plus tips. Does that come out to more than dish pit?"
KitchenConfidential,374fsx,Chaohinon,5,Sun May 24 20:48:32 2015 UTC,"6.50/hr plus tips at a reputable busy place?  I'd ballpark you'd be looking at 20-30/hr takehome pay.  Just be sure to save some for tax time.  If you're not physically grotesque or an autist and don't hate people yet, it's like 2-3x the pay and half the work of anything in the back of house.  e. actually a FOH job with a 6.50 hourly rate is probably something like bussing or expo.  You'd probably be tipped out by the servers and looking at something closer to 15/hr takehome."
KitchenConfidential,374fsx,S_Jeru,2,Sun May 24 20:56:22 2015 UTC,Shit... I was not aware of that. I'll get on top of that.
KitchenConfidential,373zau,mycathumps,3,Sun May 24 17:41:02 2015 UTC,moved here a year ago to cook i love it. Lots of places opening so theres always work for better or worse( in my opinion mostly better)  and its cheap you can live like a fat cat on a cooks pay.also i feel like here in richmond i feed more locals than tourists which i like alot.
KitchenConfidential,373zau,Squeaksmise,3,Sun May 24 20:30:43 2015 UTC,"I've been cooking in RVA for almost a decade now. It is a really interesting area, all sorts of influences and relatively cheap to live in. As to the food scene, it is definitely booming. About 5 to 7 years ago it seemed like there was a small explosion of new restaurants popping up everywhere. It was crazy how many good places opened up in that time frame. Also, there are many different possibilities as to types of kitchen work. If you are interested in fast paced, ""sling it out and that's all that matters"" work, there are places like that. If you are more interested in good, solid cuisine there are lots of smaller places in town, especially in the downtown and fan areas. The city is full of cooks and chefs, its hard to go to a bar without seeing someone you know from the industry. I read somewhere that RVA has the second highest restaurants per capita in the US. So there is definitely a market saturation, but also, there are always jobs available, and new places opening all the time. I know this is a really brief description, but I hope it helps. If you have any specific questions, fire away!"
KitchenConfidential,373zau,Mekaleckahi,1 point,Mon May 25 03:08:07 2015 UTC,It is booming indeed - Richmond.com did a short study and it's over-saturated.
KitchenConfidential,373zau,Pavswede,2,Tue May 26 15:48:21 2015 UTC,"Richmond is good to up and coming.  I cooked there for several years. Guys like Travis Milton are going to put it on the map. It sometimes gets a little overshadowed by the DC/Chesapeake Bay Area but there is a lot to offer and its a fun city to live in. Cheaper than DC, less saturated than Charleston and probably booming with restaurants faster than the Triangle area it may be a safe bet depending on what kind of food you like."

When you cut an onion, you break cells, releasing their contents. Amino acid sulfoxides form sulfenic acids. Enzymes that were kept separate now are free to mix with the sulfenic acids to produce propanethiol S-oxide, a volatile sulfur compound that wafts upward toward your eyes.  This gas reacts with the water in your tears to form sulfuric acid. The sulfuric acid burns, stimulating your eyes to release more tears to wash the irritant away.     Keeping a mouthful of water while you cut onions will do absolutely nothing to prevent the chemical reaction that causes your body's automatic response to the chemistry involved in the process.  It's the same with chewing gum, or holding a piece of bread in your mouth, or keeping matches in your lips, or whatever old-wives-tale you want to mention."

KitchenConfidential,370plm,Babybleu,1 point,Tue May 26 03:36:04 2015 UTC,"A word of warning about Danskos (I'm not a chef but I used to sell them). They have a very built up sole so keep an eye on the wear, especially if you have a abnormal gait (like rolling your foot, toes pointed out, things like that). The sole can wear away in a way that will make it more likely you'll roll your ankle.  Good shoes, and they do wear well, just keep an eye on the sole as they get older."
KitchenConfidential,370plm,GnollBelle,-7,Wed May 27 21:06:05 2015 UTC,"Why do you care that they're ""feminine""? Just buy some practical shoes."
KitchenConfidential,370plm,TheRealLilSebastian,7,Sat May 23 21:28:52 2015 UTC,"I'm a chick, and I have enormous feet. (Size 11 wide, US sized) For me, practical work shoes that don't look like black tugboats are amazing. If I've gotta wear the damn things all the time, I'd like for them to be at least decent-looking.   That's why I stopped buying Tredsafe shoes, in my size, they're ugly as shit and hurt my feet. I've got some New Balance ones now, they're made for trail running, so they have really good traction. Plus they're gray and electric blue!"
KitchenConfidential,370plm,gullwinggirl,12,Sun May 24 02:02:48 2015 UTC,"I don't know if you're a female or not, but to a small thing that can make a big difference. Our hair is up, we're covered up, no make up on... It's nice to feel some small bit of a normal. Practical is the most important, I agree. But something kinda feminine is nice in a strange way.   Edit:  Wow. Fuck most of you. I'm not going to be a receptionist. And honestly, I don't even have long enough hair for a pony tail. This isn't just me. I like being feminine. That doesn't make me a bad chef."
KitchenConfidential,370plm,BlackMantecore,5,Sat May 23 22:05:12 2015 UTC,oh for fucks sake people are being ridiculous. Yes not having makeup on and being covered up go against conventional femininity. no it's not wrong to want to bring some conventional femininity to your job. jesus christ.
KitchenConfidential,370plm,TheRealLilSebastian,6,Mon May 25 07:29:31 2015 UTC,"I am female. I just didn't realize that wearing hair up, not wearing makeup, and wearing non-feminine shoes makes women not normal."
KitchenConfidential,370plm,TheRealLilSebastian,2,Sat May 23 23:46:11 2015 UTC,"Normal was the wrong word; you're right. I'm not a girly girl by any means, but being surrounded in such a masculine environment makes me crave femininity. I think that's all the person meant by asking for feminine shoes."
KitchenConfidential,370plm,musiccolorthoughts,-8,Sun May 24 00:19:12 2015 UTC,"Right! I wear mascara and lip tint on the line...how much more makeup do you need?  What the hell, being covered up robs you of femininity now too? This is why women get disrespected in the industry. Right here."

KitchenConfidential,370plm,DoctorTacoMD,7,Sun May 24 04:25:57 2015 UTC,"I didn't say anything about looking pretty. I am a decent person; you know nothing about me. I'm also a great chef. I happen to have a vagina, and I happen to like to feel feminine from time to time. It doesn't make me a bad person. It's an opportunity to express myself, and I think it's really shitty of you to judge me for that. We're not going to get anywhere in this industry seeing every other female as a ""bitch"" or a ""cunt"" or a ""Secretary"". Say what you want about me, or what you think you know about me, but in the end, I have a vagina, you have a vagina, and chances are we're both being judged because of it."
KitchenConfidential,370plm,chorner79,3,Sun May 24 01:27:08 2015 UTC,"You're completely taking what I said out of context. At any point did I say I wanted to wear heels on the line? I also never said anything about looking good for someone else. I'm engaged, and I like to feel feminine to make myself feel good. And honestly, my floor isn't greasy because I keep a clean work environment. Secondly, a kitchen is a masculine work place. Take one look at this sub and you see conversations about ball powder, dick vegetables and how the waitress should't wear yoga pants. In no way was I ever trying to pick a fight. I was just trying to say that I understood what the OP meant by ""feminine shoes"". You all can say what you want about me, but in the end, you're not going to change my mind."

Also getting out of a toxic environment is a bonus itself. Weigh your options my friend."
KitchenConfidential,370avd,kitchen_llama,2,Sat May 23 22:09:50 2015 UTC,"38k is pretty typical for An entry level management salary, its right around where I started.  If you do a good job, you'll likely advance quickly and you won't have to worry about 30 cent raises anymore.    A FOH manager with BOH experience is very valuable ( sounds like you'd kill for one right now) and vice versa.  Its hard to find good managers that can float and do anything.     I actually got my first salary promotion as a FOH manager, and quickly got promoted to KM.     If a growing chain restaurant is hiring, you'll have plenty of opportunity to advance.   At the very least, most chain restaurants will give you management experience and teach you how to control costs (one thing chains have dialed in).  You'll get great experience.   I took a pay cut for my first salary position and now I'm making nearly double what I started out as.     Also, 38k is $730/week and don't forget to factor in bonuses.  They'll usually average a few g's a year plus 401k, insurance etc.   55hr weeks aren't bad, hell I'd kill for one now ;)"

We couldn't get rid of the guy because no one had the availability to work days with him, but he ended up no show quitting on an open shift. That was fun, he never showed up and I got called in way too early to save the day with no back up.  Anyhoo, this guy was a piece of work. Been in the industry longer than I'd been alive, I'll give him that. But the guy couldn't cook to save his life. He'd constantly try and take shortcuts to save time but none of these short cuts were actually making the dish to spec so we got send backs a lot. Could only watch the line - no prep, no putting away the orders. He was constantly rude to me and everyone, which is partially why he got stuck on days with me - because no one on nights wanted to work with him.  His attitude is what killed it for me though. He talked down to me because I was a girl and younger than him although I was his superior. He would constantly whisper stuff in front of me to other men, and when I'd ask he'd say how women can't handle kitchen humour. He would talk down to me, yell at me until I put his substandard food in the window. He once asked me to help him run the line during a rush and when I instructed him to time his stuff better with sautee and to wait for me to call tickets before cooking items he yelled at me telling me he didn't have to listen to some bitch younger than him, and how women can't run a kitchen.  I talked to every person in management about his attitude towards me and they pretty much said there was nothing they could do at this point and to just ride it out.... That sucked..."

KitchenConfidential,36yx2g,Country_Ham,15,Mon May 25 00:38:57 2015 UTC,"This was ten years ago, but I will never forget this guy Marc I worked with. He was older, gruff, tattooed, full of war stories about his hellion days with a biker gang. Despite his rough exterior, he was actually really cool and friendly if it was just the two of us talking and hanging out while we worked. He asked me about my family and gave me sage old man advice. He had a habit of making snacks to share, like rice crispy treats and home made granola bars. I remember thinking he was a really neat, complex, interesting guy.  Then I started experiencing conflict with the other people who worked with us. Jarred, a young kid who I had previously gotten along great with, started being real quiet around me. Another guy Dan, who was sort of a hot head, but a decent enough guy, started being even ruder than usual and acting like I annoyed him.  Marc listened empathetically when I told him how the other guys were being cold/hostile towards me. He told me to just continue working hard and keeping a good attitude and they'd warm up to me in time. Later he told me that he'd told Jarred that I was a good guy, but Jarred had told him that he didn't like working with me.   Soon after that I was called in to the bosses office and reprimanded for making an off color joke in the presence of a female delivery person. I don't remember what the joke was, but it was blown WAY out of proportion.   Not long after that I was again called into the office. That time I was reprimanded for threatening one of the FOH girls with a knife. Again, blown WAY out of proportion and I could not imagine that she had actually felt threatened, but the boss said both she and Marc had came forward to report the incident.   The next day I asked Marc why he'd done that, but Marc turned it around on me, telling me that he'd spoken with the girl and she'd been really upset by what I said. He said our friendship didn't prevent him from supporting her. He went on to warn me to watch my behavior, because a lot of people had been starting to talk about how they didn't like me. ""I try to stick up for you brother,"" he insisted.  This situation went on for maybe 2-3 MONTHS. I remember it as some of the saddest, most troubling days of my life. I woke up every morning wondering why no one liked me. Wondering how my personality had changed. I tried to be polite. I didn't butt in to anyone's conversation. I kept quiet and worked hard and felt sad that people hardly ever talked to me any more.  Except my friend Marc. He said he'd be my friend even if the whole world hated me. When it was just us two we'd joke around and talk. When other people were present he'd joke around and talk with them, leaving me out for the most part. No one talked to me unless it was about work.  And then one day I came in late on a day I didn't usually work to pick up my paycheck and saw Jarred sharing some pictures of his daughter with Dan. I couldn't help but notice them and I shyly said, ""she's getting big.""  To my surprise Jarred started handing me some of the pictures one at a time. She was wearing a Halloween outfit and looked really cute. Dan said he missed the good ol days when his daughter was young and cute. We laughed and then kind of stood there in silence. The place was closed and very quiet. ""Well, I guess I better get going,"" I said awkwardly.  As I started to walk out, I felt anger welling up inside me. Why are they so much better than me? What did I ever do to them? It made no sense. So I turned around and asked them, ""Hey guys? What did I ever do to make you hate me so much?""  Jarred said he didn't know what I was talking about. Dan said he hated every one equally. They both agreed that I come off as a ""know it all"" and I act stuck up. But they both agreed that they don't have anything particularly against me. ""You were a pretty cool guy when you started here,"" Jarred said. ""But lately it just seems like you got a stick up your ass.""  ""How about I take the stick out and help you guys clean up, so we can get some beers?"" I asked. They agreed. That was the beginning of the conversation where I realized that Marc had been feeding them lies about me. He told them that my previous job was at a fancy pants place and that I looked down on them. He told them that I had been complaining to the boss about them. He'd told them many stories about advising me to just tolerate everyone until my application goes through at another place. So while I was trying to portray myself as a quiet hard worker, it was coming off as angry inside, hostile, stuck up prick.   And they denied ever saying the stuff Marc had told me they said. Jarred never said he didn't like working with me. We all agreed to put this confusion behind us and be friends. The next morning I saw the girl who had reported me for threatening her with the knife and she didn't even remember the incident at all.   The next time I saw Marc it felt like it was meeting the devil himself. He acted the same, but now I saw through his sham friendliness. Part of me want to literally kill him, but a bigger part of me was so relieved to find out the truth that I didn't need to.  When Jarred showed up that day he sat down to eat first thing and as usual Marc came over to chat with him and offer a homemade cookie. I came over, took a cookie and started eating it, listening to their conversation. Jarred smiled, Marc looked confused. ""Hey Marc buddy,"" I asked. ""Remember that time you told me Jarred didn't like working with me?""  ""What the fuck are you talking about?"" Marc said, more quizzically than angry. If I hadn't known better I would have actually thought he was confused.  ""Also,"" I continued, ""where did you get the idea that I used to work in a fancy place?"" I asked. ""My last job before this was working construction and before that I was a dish washer at a Western Sizzlin."" I reached for another cookie, but Marc snatched the plate away and walked off. He acted really mad.   He wouldn't talk to anyone for a day or two, but remarkably everything blew over pretty fast. We continued working together for maybe another year. I hated him at first, but my hate dissipated and was replaced by feeling sorry for him. Marc was a pathetic old loser who got his kicks out of manipulating people.   They say that whatever doesn't kill you makes you stronger. In this case I think they are right. I learned something about myself through the ordeal with Marc. I learned to recognize gossip. I'm thankful to him for teaching me so clearly that it doesn't matter what people think of me. Now I live my life and be myself and treat people how I want to be treated and leave the gossiping to the pathetic old cunts who get off on that sort of thing."

KitchenConfidential,36yx2g,Thisaintscary,4,Sat May 23 21:42:46 2015 UTC,"Ugh, this woman I worked with last year was amazingly awful. She'd always start mopping our dining hall before anyone had even swept which just created a nasty mess, she was incredibly rude to almost all her coworkers, she told me she gets off on being mean to kids (while working at a summer camp...), and was always stealing shit.  Not to mention she'd go outside and get fucked up on something most days. Pretty much every one of us ending up going to our GM at some point and told him not to schedule us with her because we couldn't stand working with her. And she didn't even get let go until the end of the season."
KitchenConfidential,36yx2g,HBKF,5,Sat May 23 14:48:36 2015 UTC,"I once worked with a prep guy that straight up wouldn't do his prep. His shift was 9-5 Tuesday through Sunday. When I would arrive at 11 for the lunch rush he would ask to leave every fucking time claiming the prep had been finished. Usually he had sparsely started. It was the same thing everytime. First few times it happened I would ask that he stay until after the lunch rush was completed. He would usually throw a tantrum.   Eventually I and other would go through his prep list and make him show us the completed prep (this was a fucking burger place prep was as simple as slicing tomatoes, cooking bacon, chipping fries making onion ring batter etc, real simple shit) When going through his list with him nothing was ever up to the established par levels, he would always claim I thought that enough. He would contsantly say ""it's only burgers"" which I guess was a good enough reason for him not to pull his weight. He basically thought the job was beneath him. Worst part was he didn't even get fired. He threw a huge tantrum and walked out because the boss wouldn't give him a Saturday shift  off with only 12 hours notice."
KitchenConfidential,36yx2g,dwmills,3,Sat May 23 15:30:38 2015 UTC,"Working with the little shit right now.  Little fucker.    Always has an excuse to leave right at 3, when brunch ends.  Doesn't pull sauces, re-stock his station, or change any of it to dinner.  3 pm: Tossing apron into basket, out the door, Saturday and Sunday.    It wasn't until the other guy on brunch had a death in the family that it got to chef.  As any pitch man would say, But wait, there's more!  So this little fuck does the above, and then shit started last week, we have a ham sandwich, gotta slice ham.  So, we're running low, time to slice a new one.  He knows he's low on Saturday, doesn't say anything.  Sunday, 10 minutes before service, 'Say bro, where's the ham?'.  Which turns into him getting pissy cause he's got to slice the ham.  We'll go with this weekend next. Saturday: Late, has to leave early.  I've already got the new girl getting the eggs ready (his job).  Everyone's getting shit done.  So 20 minutes before service, brunch potatoes haven't been prepped (his job), he says to the other cook it's my responsibility, then gets pissy when he's informed by me and then with chef saying on Saturday's it's on him. Sunday: Late, has to leave early. The battle of cheese.  Gruyere and white cheddar, shred with robot-coupe attachment.  His job.  Comes to me, as i'm in the middle of protein prep and have a table full of chicken 'Say bro, where's the white cheddar', and this turns into him pitching a fit about how he's got to do all this work and since I work prep on Sunday it's my job, and other bs.    Now, we're a small kitchen.  No more than 3 on the line, and just a prep and a dish, typically.  And we've got a pretty big prep list.  Right now, it's a monster as we're ramping up for new menu this week, and all the things he's asking me to do, are his job.  He's been told by the owners and chef.  He thinks he's a little bad ass cause it's his first real kitchen and he's doing well on his station except for not stocking"
KitchenConfidential,36yx2g,AndersensMaerchen,2,Mon May 25 13:51:21 2015 UTC,"My head cook. I have no idea how he was ever made head cook. When he makes calls, his accent makes it impossible to understand him half of the time. He is also a fan of making calls while stuffing his face, so we get to have bread crumbs sprayed at us while he mumble-yells whatever the hell the ticket says. Whenever I ask for a recall, he acts as if I'm an idiot. He doesn't understand that he's the problem. He enjoys calling fourteen items in a row without taking a breath, even though the GM told him to cut it out. I don't wish him ill, but I will be happy when he moves on!"

Not even particularly attractive, but basically would always manipulate others into doing all her prep, and anything she messed up she'd blame on others.  She'd sleep with anyone above her in the brigade, and always be friendly with the chef. She finally got fired when her station partner quit, she was forced to do everything herself, and her work 'habits' were exposed.  Eventually she left the industry.  Another beauty was this apprentice who always had these 'creative' ideas, but couldn't cook at all.  Like super basic shit, he wouldn't season a salad, couldn't make a vinaigrette, or blanch vegetables.  One time he juiced some oranges by putting them through a centrifuge juicer - skins and all.  He lasted about 2 weeks - his learning capacity was nil since he 'went to culinary school', and he thought he was above all the menial tasks that he couldn't do anyway...    Also, strangely enough, I've worked with a few of these: saucier cooks who think their job is the most difficult in the world.  We had one who would show up everyday at 10 a.m., get in the way of lunch service, and do all his prep from 10 to 5, barely be ready for dinner service, and then complain about how his station is 'so much harder than the others'.  When he finally quit, the exec and I would simply alternate doing his station.  We never did replace him, because we found that either one of us could bust out all his prep that he'd take the whole day to do in a few hours, and still get everything else done.  And he was so slow on line, that whichever one of us was working the pass would just do sauce during service and shit actually sped up.  But hey, he could do 'sauce' (as though that's an accomplishment).  I think he eventually left the industry too."

KitchenConfidential,371oon,chorner79,5,Sun May 24 23:17:33 2015 UTC,"A blood eagle is when someone cuts the ribs of another person, at the back. Then extracts their still attached lungs and pin them above the person. Usually to a tree to which the victim is first crucified.   So, really, if that's what you were going for you should have taken the breasts off from behind, through the ribcage.  Also, as a side note, that bird looks under. Deep red at the shoulder joint, blush through the center of the breast. Bloody chicken is not pleasant, but it's nowhere near as intimidating as the blood eagle."

Or to possibly explain the process beforehand?  Your post insinuates that he's done something like this before... so who's fault is it when you haven't learned how to train him properly. You obviously know what you're dealing with, so you've got zero people to blame other than yourself when you've identified a problem and keep attempting a failed solution. Your handling of your cook is the equivalent of putting potatoes in a pot and then on the stove."
KitchenConfidential,36y7a9,cool_hand_luke,-8,Sat May 23 05:27:12 2015 UTC,"Yes, he has done things like this before and the reason  it astounds me is that he has done these processes correctly before. This isn't the first time I asked him to put on potatoes for mashing, or told him he needs to wash salad, or told him that his thumb needs to be behind his fingers when he is chopping. He knows how to do all these things, he is just a space cadet. Asking him to prep potatoes with minimal guidance is well within his zone of proximal development. I am just waiting for him to begin to move from the knowledge to application stage and use the skills that he has been taught while focusing on the task at hand. Were I to asses his progress, I would say that he has improved significantly since he has arrived. I only marvel at his ability to skip over mundane steps that I know he is aware of. I love his ability to move from a percept to concept (Campbell/Kessner 2009), I just wish he would pay attention to what he is doing. I am a very good teacher CHL, its what I do outside the kitchen. Were I in a classroom setting, I would provide a peer mentor to work alongside him or create additional opportunities to practice these skills. Unfortunately, I am not the Chef in this kitchen and I am not allowed to allocate resources as such. I therefore strive to provide valid and appropriate models of any task that I assign, as well as allow myself ample opportunities to check for understanding.

If you're not the chef and you have zero authority in allocating resources... you ARE his peer. Your suggestion of a peer mentor to work along side him is a wonderful idea.   So why aren't you doing that? You only do things you're directed to, or are you a self starter who sees a problem and finds a solution?   I have faith in you. Your initial failure will improve if you apply yourself correctly. You seem bright enough to get it. I know it's tough, but one day you will be able to properly instruct a member of the kitchen."

The point of the post was not to talk about how he isn't grasping concepts, or how his skills are sub par, but how he knows what to do and just forgets simple things.

A lot of restaurants especially if they're old and have been there for years have been passed down through families and typically they tend to give the jobs out to family members or people close to them.

From restaurants to private gigs to resorts and hotels. Charleston has plenty to offer. The quality of ingredients you can get your hands on is spectacular. For such a small town my list of possible purveyors for most products is pretty amazing once you tap into the local farms. Decent to great local supply of fish and seafood depending on the season. Unreal regional meat quality, particularly pork and poultry. Plus tons of specialty items, charcuterie, cheeses etc are all made regionally. Charlestonians love to eat and DRINK.

To make cutlets, you lay the chicken tits down on a clean cutting board, or firm surface; cover with some plastic wrap, and beat it with a mallet until it's thickness is thin and uniform.   When beating your meat; make sure when you hit the meat that you are pushing the meat away from you as well (Yes, the pun was intentional. No, I am not kidding).  Almost as if you are  trying to push it away from you.   Since you're confused about a butterfly cut as well; it is a cut that is used to cut something in half leaving one side untouched. So you start from one side of the product and stop before you cut it all the way. Said product should open like a book, or butterfly. The purpose of this cut is to reduce cooking time, and insure even cooking. It mostly used on thicker steak cuts, or roasts, or if someone wants a well done filet to go out with a rare at the same time.  That said, a chicken tit is too uneven to butterfly, and if you do use a butterfly cut; it will fuck up the muscle fibers, and you'll have uneven cooking resulting in a dry ass chicken tit...Just use a mallet and beat the meat for a while.   Oh also, put the chicken in a brine before hand (salt, water, some sugar, and whatever floats your boat). Like 8 hours should be good...This will prevent your newly thinned chicken tit from being drier than the Sahara after your cook it.  Chicken tit."

KitchenConfidential,36xbmx,Aksugi,6,Fri May 22 22:02:17 2015 UTC,"First, go watch a YouTube video about basic knife skills. Most importantly learn how to not cut yourself by keeping your left hand out of the way and a good right hand grip. After that, get a good nights rest, wake up early, get a good sized breakfast with lots of protein and fat to last you the whole shift. Be prepared to work your ass off. Stay hydrated! I go through a gallon of water during my slower shifts. Remember: hurry, don't rush. Do things as quickly as you feel comfortable, speed comes from repetition, not by trying to go faster and making mistakes every time. Focus on working and learning as much as possible. One of the cooks tries to shoot the shit? Ask him/her if they need help with something. They'll like the help and the head chef will see you jumping at the opportunity to learn and get shit done with the team.  As far as the recipe, don't attempt it solo if you don't understand it. Be honest that you don't know or feel comfortable attempting it yet without instruction. The chef is trying to see what you already know so he knows what he's working with. A person who has never cooked anything that didn't involve a microwave stand out pretty quickly when asked to brown some garlic in a pan. Chances are that if you cook for yourself often at home, you'll do fine. It's not like he's going to have you make anything hard or use uncommon ingredients. Even a simple recipe like ""cook this portion of spaghetti noodles, ladle on 4 oz of this sauce"" can reveal a lot about your cooking skill."

KitchenConfidential,36x9zo,cuckname,2,Fri May 22 21:49:49 2015 UTC,"I think you answered your own question?  When it comes to vegetables with a lot of natural sweetness like carrots, parsnips, squashes, I love to add coconut milk instead of cream.  One of my favorites is enough parsnips to fill a middle sized pot, 1 large can of coconut milk + water to top of the parsnips, half a vanilla pod (de-seeded, throw in the seeds and the pod), 2 cloves, 1 bayleaf and salt. Cook until tender on a medium- high heat and until the liquid has reduced and started to caramelize, strain (but save the liquid), remove the cloves and bayleaf, blitz until smooth (add liquid to desired consistency).  Another one of my favorites is sunchokes (Jerusalem artichokes): Wash + scrub the sunchokes to remove all the dirt, make sure they are clean. Slice very thinly with the skins still on, fry in a hot pan to give color + season with salt and pepper, transfer to a pot and cover with chicken stock, simmer until tender and blitz."

Like I mentioned above, I like coconut milk for parsnips and stock for sunchokes. I do use milk, butter and cream in my purees as well, it depends on the vegetable. I love emulsifying brown butter into my cauliflower puree, I use cream + steep thyme into my celery root puree and I prefer milk over cream in my potato puree."

If you're interested in a great butternut puree, halve them and roast them with salt and a bit of olive oil until they're tender enough to spoon out, then remove the flesh and cook it in a pot until a fond starts to form on the bottom (this will give you a much sweeter product) add cream and scrape fond from bottom. Buzz and you're set. I've also been playing with the idea of making a vegetable ash from the discarded skin and folding it into the puree for a speckled look."

It says nothing detrimental about the actual craft of making shoes."
KitchenConfidential,36sngd,BlakeJustBlake,2,Sat May 23 04:34:55 2015 UTC,But the term is used commonly enough in that way in kitchens that one can safely assume they are ascribing these qualities to a person who would make such a poor product in a kitchen.

I worked in kitchens for 24 years,so it's how I learned to speak to people.   However, again, I apologize. I left the industry at age 40 because I couldn't see people exploited and treated poorly anymore. I would have posted what you did 10, hell maybe even 5 years before I got out. Pride in being stupid because it made me seem tougher. Fresh hires in awe of the stories I told them. Demanding they act the same way.   I started getting shit on in a dish pit. Worked line, kitchen manager, Sous Chef, culinary school, owner, treating employees like sub-human profit maximizers. Cut the people that wanted to be treated with respect, and hire someone that would work harder for less money, keep 2 or 3 people around for skill, and work them 50+ hours a week for a shit salary with no benefits. Then I guess I got soft and realized no human being should be forced to maim themselves, have no life, and need to drink to keep sanity in order to live well below the poverty line.   So yeh your post struck a nerve. Again I apologize for the outburst."

KitchenConfidential,36vshy,Romis,9,Fri May 22 14:49:39 2015 UTC,"not necessarily. I am in my late 20s, and while I am no billionaire, my wife and I live comfortably within our means. I was promoted to my first sous chef position 2 years ago, and earned a raise to a more comfortable salary 3 months ago. I still have enough free time to maintain some semblance of a social life as well as spending time with my wife. While, we do not, cannot, or will not concede to the 9 to 5 drab, Chefs can lead a fulfilling familial life. my old HC has a young daughter, and he and I worked our schedules that he was able to pick her upp from the bus stop at least 3 times a week, and have a few weekend days a month with her. on the flip side, he ensure that I got several Fridays or Saturdays and evenings with my wife, who works a 9 to 5. A good restaurant will understand that their cooks and chefs are people too, with lives and families outside of the kitchen. they will do everything they can, within reason, to make sure that their employees are happy and healthy individuals. Like they say, ""Happy Chef, happy food."""
KitchenConfidential,36vshy,TheLazyLardon,6,Fri May 22 15:46:39 2015 UTC,"You are never going to work a 9-5 with decent money in a restaurant. You gotta go be a cook at a nursing home or a hospital or something. They make super amazing pay + benefits. The food is pretty shit and they absolutely drill you on health code, but its a decent career choice. If you open a restaurant and it happens to be successful and you hire people to do all your work for you, then maybe you could go do something else. Otherwise it isn't ever happening. Also the only time I make decent pay is when I get like 15 hours of overtime."
KitchenConfidential,36vshy,Kingtomy,2,Fri May 22 17:46:20 2015 UTC,"I started making decent money around age 25 ($50K+/year).  Basically you need to be a sous or higher, or indespensible enough that you can command a high wage.    The real money in the industry is in owning your own business.  If you're a chef with good experience its not too hard to find investors, although often the terms suck, and you need to wade through a bunch of business bullshit.    But yes, cooking wages are generally quite bad.  Some people are never able to find a good balance."

KitchenConfidential,36sdag,NotQuiteProChef,8,Thu May 21 19:05:26 2015 UTC,"I was working at an Italian steak house when the chef hired a woman who turned out to be a fairly hardcore Christian.  She knew her way around a kitchen and was fast and a self-starter, but she went to the chef on her 2nd day complaining about language in the kitchen.  Chef came to us and asked us to tone it down around the new hire, to give her a chance to acclimate.  We were by no means the worst place I've worked, language-wise; we were actually fairly tame, easy-going folks.  We weren't cracking offensive jokes or anything.  But anyway, everyone agreed to take it easy.  It wasn't enough.  As it turned out, she found it offensive that people would swear in the kitchen, even if you just dropped the F word, as in ""We fucking need this on the fly.""  She never said any of this to the crew, but it came out later that through talks with chef, she didn't even like hearing ""damn"" or ""hell"".  Well, there was only so much we could do, and she ended up quitting after 3 or 4 days.  So we started wondering where she could have gotten experience in kitchens if she was so easily offended.  Turns out she'd gone to culinary school, and then her first job out had been baking for a religious couple in town that ran a cafe.  So we were really her first taste of her chosen profession.  I don't know what happened to her, but I doubt that after trying out a few real, working kitchens that she decided to remain a cook.  I think she thought it was going to be like an office job or something."

KitchenConfidential,36u1hq,ZeraskGuilda,3,Fri May 22 05:00:15 2015 UTC,"somehow they thought the place could support both owners quitting their jobs to do nothing more than bookkeeping for the restaurant(they can't even push a mop or peel potatoes to save hours).    And this right here is why most restaurants fail in my experience.  If one of them was the Chef and one of them was the GM, they'd be saving $100K to $200K per year.  At the very least, they'd both be able to pay their bills and keep the place open.     hell most nights we're pumping out more food than the servers can handle and we're at capacity, it's not like we're one of those places that can't get a customer to come in the doors.   Their costs are too high it seems.  Makes sense with neither of them doing any tangible work.  They probably hired way too many people, and wasted a ton of money trying to figure out a 'formula' for success.    Anyhow, it seems like you have a good handle on the situation, good luck finding a new job."

KitchenConfidential,36vh5f,TheLazyLardon,6,Fri May 22 13:20:40 2015 UTC,"in additrion to allowing a restaurant to save on all those overhead costs, it also frees up a table for another valued guest to come and spend their hard-earned money. My restaurant owners do not charge a fee, and when I approached them about including the togo hardware (in addition to gloves, chems, and other various nonsellables) in the cood and bev costs, they declined, saying hat a customer should not have to pay for something they will not eat or drink."

KitchenConfidential,36s7xl,BrandtCantWatch_,3,Thu May 21 20:16:18 2015 UTC,"I don't know enough about depression so I'll leave that alone. But, I can definitely weigh in on what it's like to work in an intense kitchen. It seems like this is your first job in a super serious environment.  I was once in your position. It was my first job in a Michelin starred restaurant and I simply was not used to the pace or the expectations. You had to be fast and you had to be perfect. None of my previous jobs really prepared me for this... I now realize, nobody is ever ready for their first taste of an intense kitchen.   You're going to be terrified, stressed, and in the shits 100% of the time. There were days when I would cry on the subway on my way home because of how exhausted and stressed I was. I felt like I could never get ahead on my prep, service was always a nightmare, and since everyone else was as weeded as I was, I felt super alone. It was and will likely be, the hardest period of time in my life.  I can promise you one thing: it will never, ever get any easier. It will always be that difficult and stressful. A kitchen like that will never change - its success relies on that very fact. But you will change. You'll get better. Your confidence will grow. Your knowledge will expand. Things that are difficult to you now will seem simple. Your thinking and your attitude will change and it will mold you into a super-star cook. What's that, chef? Lowboys went out overnight so we have to toss all our mise and prep for 400 covers from scratch in two hours? What am I supposed to do with the extra 45 minutes, chef?   I don't know what personal issues you are dealing with and how they are affecting you... but if your goal is to be the best cook you can be, I would stick around. I've since moved on from that first kitchen on to other Michelin starred places and I can tell you from experience that the first one will always be the hardest. Now, I feel confident that I can walk into any station, any service, any restaurant and fucking slay it. You gotta earn those stripes, kid."

KMs are generally not interested in prolonged hiring processes, if someone shows up that can do the job they'll often just take 'em. Many of my stages have turned into paid shifts when it became clear that I really am a cook. If they're not hiring and are just taking you in to get shown the ropes and do some grunt labour, then chances are lower, and it all depends on if they're the type of establishment to say 'yeah sure whatever we can always use a guy' instead of 'ARE YOU CRAZY PAYROLL IS ALREADY WAY OVERBUDGET'"
KitchenConfidential,36thhe,angry_dave,2,Fri May 22 00:54:54 2015 UTC,"From my experience, a lot of it depends on the context, ie is it a place that's well known, what's the job market like, are there other stagiaires, what are their skill sets like compared to mine... Granted, I never looked for a gig in a bakery or as a pastry cook, but I would guess there's a good chance they might look to offer you a job of some sort if they see you have the right attitude and can pick up things quickly.    To expand on what stages actually entail, they can range anywhere from a day to a week or even months.  Kitchens love free labour, and they'll take advantage of the fact that you want and pretty much need the experience to get anywhere.  These days a stage has just come to mean a tryout that lasts a day, maybe two.  There are still places though that will take you on more or less as an unpaid intern, where you do all the bitchwork.    On your stage, they'll want to see where you are in terms of kitchen skills, how you interact with the other cooks and how good a fit you'd be for the team.  Make sure, however, you do the same.  Do what they say, ask good questions, always find something to do, and keep your head down.  I'm sure you'll have a fun time."

KitchenConfidential,36thhe,Hehlol,1 point,Sat May 23 05:16:12 2015 UTC,"How often do stages turn into job offers?   This isn't an ambiguous or open question.

I thought that I had acknowledged that the real question I wanted answered (""How likely is it that this stage will turn into a job offer?"") wasn't one that any person could answer but perhaps I could have been more clear.

We used to do a lot of lobsters at a place I used to work so hopefully that's helpful!"
KitchenConfidential,36sanf,TrickGreen,3,Thu May 21 19:16:22 2015 UTC,"I break them down and do them by segments, in separate batches.  Shears for the body and tail, Knife for the claws, French rolling pin for the knuckles and legs."
KitchenConfidential,36sanf,MylesMDT,3,Fri May 22 02:04:29 2015 UTC,"The most important part when doing huge batches of anything is to make yourself an assembly line.  Instead of doing each lobster 1 at a time, start by breaking your lobsters down and separating the body parts in hotel pans.  I.e. if you're doing 50 lobsters, break them all down and tackle 50 tails at a time, then 100 claws, then knuckles etc.    For the tails take a pair of skinny kitchen shears and cut down the length of all of the tails.  Then remove all of the tail meat.    For the claws, wiggle the pincer side to side (opposite the direction it is supposed to move) and the pincer should come off easily and leave the meat in tact.  Using the back of a thick knife or a small mallet, gently crack the fat part of the claw opposite where the pincer connects.  The bottom half should crack off and allow you to pull the claw meat out in one beautiful piece.   The important part here is to try to remain an assembly line.  Crack all of your shells and then peel, don't waste time putting your knife down and starting over for each claw. Eventually you'll get very efficient.  One thing that helped me was timing myself using a stop watch.  If the fastest I can do it today is an hour, tomorrow I want to do it in 58 minutes etc.  Shaving a few seconds off of each part will really add up.   I'm really competitive and I like to win, so it was a fun game I played with myself that made me much better and helped break up a super boring/monotonous task.  I had to do like 50 lobsters every Thursday for a weekend special.   Here's a tip too, there is good meat in the legs. Its a part 90% of restaurants throw in the garbage, but if you're doing a shit load of lobster, those little legs can yield a lot of extra meat."

KitchenConfidential,36sanf,ibefunlkg,1 point,Thu May 21 21:03:29 2015 UTC,Crab crackers on the knuckles. They usually will come out in one big chunk. the tail is easy if you cut it down the middle with scissors or a chef knife and peel back the bottom shell. I usually deal with lobsters I have just killed before they are steamed so this method may be a little more of a pain in the ass once it is steamed.

KitchenConfidential,36q1iz,well_done_unicorn,4,Thu May 21 18:37:51 2015 UTC,"Well if you really want to do it right, you should do a couple things.  First, blanch the greens until they're soft. Probably longer than you think, but it still won't be terribly long. Then shock them in ice and squeeze every last drop you can get from them. Weigh that amount. Let's say it's 150g of greens. Then blanch spinach and do the same (squeeze water, etc). Add it to the fennel fronds.  Once you have say 300g total of ""green product"" (fennel fronds and spinach combined), weigh out 200g of water, 4.5g agar agar, .5g xanthan gum. Whisk the agar and xanthan gum into the water. Bring the water (and additions) to a boil, and make sure they're fully hydrated.  Add the boiling liquid to the 300g ""green product"" and blend until smooth. Strain through a chinois into a 6 pan (or something similar). Let it chill until it sets. Cut up the gel and blend again in the blender until smooth. I'd still pass through chinois again, but that's up to you.  You'll get a green FG that tastes strongly of fennel, and it'll stay bright green for about 3 days. It'll stay mostly green and theoretically usable (depending on your standards, I toss it after three days) for about a week. After that the taste starts to echo the flavor and it gets a little funky."
KitchenConfidential,36q1iz,Gavin499,1 point,Thu May 21 06:25:48 2015 UTC,"i actually usually use agar as the thickener in FG, but i was worried that the second heating process would overcook the greens and make it turn colors.  thanks for the info, i'll try this tomorrow .  time wont be an issue, since the gel will be used for a one day special anyway"
KitchenConfidential,36q1iz,Gavin499,1 point,Thu May 21 06:38:39 2015 UTC,"I use ultratex for fluid gels sometimes, but for greens I find this to be a better technique. If you're using the ultratex with a fluid gel that has citrus in it (as you suggested you might add lemon or something), be careful. The ultratex 3 reacts poorly to acid and will breakdown. Ultratex 8 would be a better fit in that case.  The second heating would be an issue, that's why I hydrate the agar in water that's blended with the greens. That way after they're blended smooth you can cool them on ice quickly and limit the amount of heat they're affected by. Depending on what you're using it for, be careful. We do a tarragon fluid gel, and you'd be shocked at how intense it can be. It's almost off-putting if you use what looks like a ""reasonable"" amount."

But I have seen my fellow guy cooks get away with shit that shouldn't even be tolerated in a kitchen...Although, I have seen the female cooks do this as well...which should not be negated just because they pull the vagina card, which I've seen quite a few times as well.  I've seen just what  they're capable of, and I gotta say...they tend to have a more professional approach to it; albeit they pack on way more stress than what they think they should carry and it shows in some areas (mostly during service, which I get but...a 200 cover night would very quickly feel like a 600 cover night with the sous's orders)  From my point of view, it seemed like they felt like every day was an audition...No flexibility, no prisoners taken, no jokes, and heaven help you if the entire kitchen has PMS; which has happened to me more than once...They can't help what their bodies do, but fuck me...the dead silence, and angry glares in the kitchen were unbearable.

Im not saying this to rag on the Natives, but as far as a restaurant concept goes its going to be a hard sell.  You say fry bread isnt a native american dish, well look at all the other things I said above, or will you bastardize your culture to salt and butter your corn on the cob?"
KitchenConfidential,36m888,mbillion,2,Sun May 24 18:16:54 2015 UTC,the only native american dish I can remember is a fried bread thing my chippewa stepmother would make.  would be interesting to see what kinds of things they made.
KitchenConfidential,36m888,bikersquid,1 point,Wed May 20 20:14:04 2015 UTC,"interestingly fry bread is not a traditional native food, but rather came out of trying to make commodity foods last. however it has certainly taken its place in many native cultures."
KitchenConfidential,36m888,BlackMantecore,2,Fri May 22 03:35:54 2015 UTC,this guy is awesome. there are a couple other places doing this as well. Salmon N Bannock in Vancouver BC comes to mind.
KitchenConfidential,36m888,BlackMantecore,1 point,Fri May 22 03:35:04 2015 UTC,"Seems like the biggest challenge is that 1) Native American cultures were almost uniformly disrupted by invasion and epidemic, so getting past that ""cultural bottleneck"" (aka, frybread explosion) is difficult, and 2) talking about ""Native American"" cuisine is like talking about ""European cuisine,"" which is to say stupidly diverse. Pre-Columbian exchange plains diets are going to be completely different than post-exchange, and still even more different than, say, Pacific Northwest.  And honestly, there are a lot of Native American influences on some regional cuisines, like typical Southern food. Extracting that is interesting, and I've played around with it, but then you have the problem that it's already familiar and thus loses its novelty."

KitchenConfidential,36nmm4,infectedketchup,1 point,Thu May 21 06:36:26 2015 UTC,"While I can't really say which is the better choice for your specific needs, I can say that over the years I have become a huge Hobart fan boy, and that's from only using two of their products. I've been working with a globe mixer by Hobart for ten years, and if I had to guess the thing was at least twenty years old when I started. That thing is a tank. The only time it has ever given us problems is one time, about six years in, it stopped working because we had never once oiled it. called the repair guy, have been oiling it since, and it still works just as perfectly as it ever has.   The other thing I've used is a slicer. I can't comment on the durability of it because it's basically brand new, but it doesn't feel like something that will break any time soon. What really gets me about it though is its design. It is, hands down, the most perfectly designed slicer I have ever seen (I've only seen about six total, but still) Everything about it is deliberate. There are very few hard to reach places (way under the blade) limited removable parts (about three) and you can tell by using it that this is the result of years of actually giving a fuck about making a tool that is optimized for the people who will use it ever day. It's just a slicer, but I swear that every problem normally associated with slicers was addressed when they made this thing.   Again, I can't say that this specific product is what's best for you, but from my experience the equipment Hobart makes excellent. It's literally ridiculous and embarrassing how much I like their stuff."

Use them more as a guide then just copy/paste.   So, in my restaurant, it's new american, 99% scratch - I'd probably envision a houseground shortrib dog, red wine mustard, pickled diced radish, and ""Chicago"" style relish (but made with blue coloring, to achieve red white and blue) on a housemade bun."

Be organized and have a system that works for your brain, so you know what tickets are where, when to fire, etc.  Keep track of ticket times - When I ran expo I wrote the app time on the ticket so I had an idea when the entrees should be fired - that way no tables get lost or pushed behind other food accidently.  Keep those plates consistent, cleanly wiped, and not missing anything.  The biggest thing is communicating as efficiently and clearly as possible.

KitchenConfidential,36hmx5,kf4ypd,1 point,Wed May 20 02:57:14 2015 UTC,"Natural gas is only dangerously flammable under pressure.   If something were to happen to the pipe, the pressure would be released.     We had a leaky valve on the fryer that needed to be changed during service. Instead of killing the gas to the entire building and shutting down service, the plumber just changed it hot.  Everyone thought he was crazy, but its really not that dangerous."

KitchenConfidential,36i1ow,newnewBrad,8,Tue May 26 08:54:16 2015 UTC,"Definitely do the Manager's cert. Servsafe lasts like 5 years, so why not get the best certification you can? The test is more difficult and also a bit more expensive, and it covers more obscure topics like legal responsibility and specific naming of bacteria that causes food-borne illness, among other things. I found it to be very helpful for me, and you may one day be a manager somewhere someday within the next couple of years! Not sure where you are, but California requires at least one manager in any establishment to hold manager's certification.  Set yourself up for success and just go beyond the average"

KitchenConfidential,36f0b7,drays,1 point,Tue May 19 21:13:52 2015 UTC,that stinks. do you think it has to do with the heat treatment? I know these knives have a really hard treatment which can make some steels brittle. I ask because I have a kanehiro as gyuto which has the same core steel and is made by the same maker.

KitchenConfidential,36gbvb,newsjunki,2,Wed May 20 02:03:21 2015 UTC,"I'll give it to you from an owner's perspective so that you can make the best decision for yourself by looking at both sides of the coin.  You say that Dick is a successful executive chef.  Unfortunately, to be a successful chef, there's a lot more involved than being a good cook and working a lot of hours.  You need to know the business side, and if you haven't taken accounting or management classes, you'll need to learn on the job.  If Dick is willing, it will take him a lot of time and patience to teach you these things.  If you want to start your own place, this experience is a must.      What it sounds like is that Sal may have been a good cook and hard worker, but maybe he lacked in the business management side.  There's a lot that goes on between the chef and the owner/management that you're likely not aware of.    The chef must manage ordering, vendors, cost of goods (products & labor), scheduling, HR issues, etc.  It's very stressful, and not for everyone.  It sounds like Sal was passed over for this position that he feels entitled to because he's put in the time, even if he wasn't the best choice.    I've seen this happen many times, where there are things going on behind the scenes between us (the owners) and the chef and sous - where they're not doing their job to our expectations, or they're not completing their paperwork (and there's a lot of it) in a timely manner, or whatever.  We call them out on it, they get pissed and offended for being called out, they call us the assholes, and they start trying to turn the other staff against us because their ego is bruised.  They end up quitting or getting fired, and try to talk other people (who aren't really truly aware of what went on behind the scenes) with them.  Obviously I don't know the details in Sal's situation, but I've experienced it enough that I can tell you with high probability that Sal was not suited for the chef's position.  He felt entitled because he works hard, and wants to take everyone else down with him.    If you went with Sal, would you be moving into a Sous position?  I always tell people that once they've stopped learning, or once they've maxed out their potential, they should definitely move jobs.  However, in your case, you might consider that being a sous could give you the experience you need to take your career to the next level, and then you leave.  Do what's best for you, not Sal.  Edit to add: when I hear potential employees tell me other restaurant owners/chefs in town are assholes, I laugh.  It's usually code for the situation I spelled out above.  Sometimes they are actually assholes, but a lot of times they're not.  They're just smart business owners."

It's a personnel issue between Dick and Sal.    As I've gotten older, I've learned it always helps to look at both sides and consider alternative scenarios than the one you were fed, even if it's a friend telling it to you.  Always look out for numero uno, and don't let your friend manipulate you into doing what's best for them, because often times even your friends are not looking out for your best interest.

Nowadays, I deepclean the entire kitchen, including the dining table which probably has had beer pong cups on it with spills around it for days before I even get a day off. The stove is always the worst. It's covered in spillage burned on day after day by the roommate that actually cooks. The other one claims he never cooks at home, so that exempts him from giving a fuck about his dishes piling up in the sink even when the dish washer is empty. They're nasty fuckers, but since we got a functional dish washer, I can just ignore their messy dishes until I get something fully cooked, portion it out into containers for the week and hope their nasty fridge foods don't explode next to it.

Towards the higher side considering you are dealing with sushi.  I charge $75 an hour for anything I do that's not working a line.  Start by making an outline/breakdown of all the things you would be doing for him.  Include everything from training to equipment to projected sales if possible.  Treat it as a proposal of sorts to borrow a term from the construction industry.  Keep track of what hours you spend doing that and use that as a baseline for how many hours it would take to set his sushi station up.  Don't forget to include estimated time it will take to train his employees.  Keep in mind he will be making money from your work and don't sell yourself short.

KitchenConfidential,36emxp,anarchir,1 point,Tue May 19 05:32:39 2015 UTC,"Well, the first step is to put whiskey in that cup instead of vodka. Rookie mistake.  Now, you really have to realize that you're 22. That's super young, specially to be hiring you straight to management. You have less than a year being a sous, and it's not like you were an executive. I know it sounds painful, but you have to get your ego in check and possibly take a step down to the line, specially if it's a place you really like and respect.  I worked my way through Chicago kitchens and flew up and down the ranks. I worked my way up from dishwasher to sous when I was young, left, went back to another line, worked to exec chef, then stepped back down to line cook when I went up to Michelin places. One step backwards, three steps forward.   The place you like that's expanding sounds like a great opportunity. Go in on their line or whatever they are offering and prove yourself to them. There's clearly positions opening, and if you can prove you have the chops for the position, you'll be right there to hire. If you feel like you're really balls in for the sous, take that job, work for it, but keep applying around. Don't just stop working and be depressed, that's the worst thing you can do."
KitchenConfidential,36emxp,MediumSizedTurtle,1 point,Tue May 19 10:51:45 2015 UTC,"When I was 22 I had the same mentality. All I can say that would be of any use is, take the job under the chef/chefs that you think can mentor you, that you feel have the most to offer you. What you've accomplished up to this point is great but starting a new gig(given that its with the right crew) is a chance for you to learn, to better mold your current skill set into a trade craft. Don't be down n out bc you lost your ""seasonal"" gig. You should be stoked! Your favorite kitchen offered you a job, go get it."

They wanted oval or oddly stretched pizzas. So i do oval. And they're like ""nah, they look too consistent. Like they came out of a box. Make every one of them differently shaped.""  I said no, that it compromised the integrity of the product, in my opinion, and continued to make the oval pizzas. I called out one day a couple of months later and the regional chef was in our facility, so he hopped on the station that day. Ruined dozens of pizzas. I came back the next day and pretty much got the blessing to do what I know works. Pretty good feeling.  Also. Pizzas shaped like some mutant star of david don't look very good.

I would take a tube of beef, cut patties, and then just peel the wrapper off the beef discs.  After the first night, virtually nobody ordered hamburgers from me.  The boss talked to me after a couple of days, and told me that there were complaints about my burgers, and that it must be a different product, and obviously store-bought, because they were perfectly round.  The other cook would hand-form the burger patties.      So I was told that I had to start making them look ""less perfect"", by just smashing them a little bit, or something, before I cooked them, so that they weren't so round.  So I started smashing the edges after I cut them off the tube, and there were no more complaints."

Having a well crafted resume also helps out.   Where I am, many restaurants provide their own knives because a local company specializes in knife sharpening/provision. Having your own gear is definitely a plus.

KitchenConfidential,36d8y3,EatsRedditors4Lunch,6,Mon May 18 17:53:22 2015 UTC,"Not so much a formula but... 1. How much ice does all of your ice bins (drink machine, bar, etc) hold?  Multiply by three (am shift, pm refill, busy day refill) 2. How much ice does your kitchen use?  3. Do anything else with ice? (sell bags in the summer, ice beer carts for the golf course, etc)  Add all that up and then add another quarter to the total, to cover that crazy busy summer hot day.  It's always tempting to go cheap on your ice maker.  They are ungodly expensive for something so simple.  But running to the store and blowing seventy bucks a week on ice when you run out adds up fast.  Get what you really need in the first place and save money in the long run."

I personally would say something along the lines of ""hey my gf saw this fb post by you"" blah blah and I would appreciate you stop it. I respect you your talented and just want us to move forward. My concern is he might be so distraught that you busted him he might not be able to carry on a professional relationship. On the other hand if you don't do anything it's always going to be in the back of your mind. And you will most likely see future posts that will eventually piss you off &  just add to the already boiling problem. Tough spot to be in for sure. And sadly you did nothing to warrant this.

He's spoken to upper management about it, out of concern that there are going to be further complications down the road with him, and because the things he's posting are a serious misrepresentation of the business.  He's posting pictures of food that isn't even on the catering menu and saying he's made it for caters, and that's only part of the issue given that the things he's said and posted don't exactly align with the business model.   More or less though, at this point he's put it into the GM and owner's hands to decide what to do with.

Sure, he's taking credit for stuff you've done, but only in front of people only he knows.  I'm sure it's a bit frustrating to see someone essentially pretending to be you, but at the end of the day he will have nothing to show for it.  His words and pictures are empty, and one day this inflated and blind ego of his will be crushed with reality.    I don't think it matters much whether you talk with him about it or not.  I'm sure he doesn't know anyone professionally that would make a difference in his charade, so there's nothing to worry about there. If your pride is really hurting though, I guess you could talk to him about it.  My honest advice though is to leave it be.  Like I said, he has no substance behind what he is pretending to be, he hasnt the slightest idea of what its like to be in your position as a chef.  One day when he ventures off on his own, thinking he's too good for your place, he will be humbled tremendously."

KitchenConfidential,369fbn,MisChef,4,Sun May 17 23:38:34 2015 UTC,"This is my magical menu -- a standard menu offering for people who have allergies:   plain mixed baby greens OR romaine lettuce plain poached chicken breast OR plain poached salmon plain steamed white OR brown rice plain steamed broccoli OR plain boiled carrots your choice of whatever fruit is available   They will be cooked technically perfectly, in clean pans, à la minute, just for you. I will prepare them with no garlic, no onion, no salt, no oil, no butter, no nothing.   This is a magical menu, because it seems to make a lot of peoples' allergies clear up on the spot."
KitchenConfidential,369fbn,Who_GNU,3,Mon May 18 23:35:43 2015 UTC,"I must be pretty plain, because that doesn't sound that bad.  If you had olive oil, balsamic vinegar, and black pepper at the table, You'd have my compliments, as long as the fruit is fresh.  I prefer my broccoli florets and carrots raw, which is awkward in a restaurant, but if you had done kohlrabi, I wouldn't mind if they are cooked.  Other than that, I'd go for the salmon on brown rice with whichever greens are fresher."
KitchenConfidential,369fbn,MisChef,3,Mon May 18 23:52:53 2015 UTC,"It's really a pretty good menu, all things considered.  Gluten free, dairy free, peanut free, no red meat, no shellfish, etc., etc.  It's kind of what ""normal"" people might cook for themselves, but the chicken will be moist, the fish won't be overcooked, the veg will be cooked correctly (and in fact, raw is less work for me so whatever floats your boat.)   You can put whatever you want on it, so if you're not going to expode into a pile of goo by sprinkling some soy sauce on it you're good to go. Drown it in sriracha, cheese, ketchup, what do I care? You're going to pay an upcharge over what the typical entrée price, because it's a MAGICAL special order.   ...and how dare you insinuate that the imaginary fruit of unknown origin would be less than perfectly fresh :-P"

KitchenConfidential,369fbn,jadedgoldfish,11,Mon May 18 11:45:08 2015 UTC,Cold urticaria. I get hives from contact with anything cold. Ice and frozen foods cause my mouth and throat to swell and have difficulty swallowing and breathing.
KitchenConfidential,369fbn,SilenceSeven,6,Mon May 18 11:58:03 2015 UTC,"Cold urticaria   That sounds like one of the worst allergies a person could have.  Could you go into some detail how this affects daily life? If you don't want to,  that's fine too..   Do you have to live in an area with hardly any winter? How cold is too cold?  Can you have a cold beer?, but not the ""Coldest beer in town""? Air conditioning in the car? Swimming in a cool pool? If you had a fever and needed to be cooled down,  one giant itchy hive?"
KitchenConfidential,369fbn,jadedgoldfish,19,Mon May 18 13:03:09 2015 UTC,"I live in the bay area, but have to wear a heavy, floor length coat in the winter even here. I keep my house and car set to 73 degrees and start to get itchy around 65 degrees, but uncomfortable under around 68. During the summer, I have to carry around a jacket to put on any time I go into an air conditioned building. Water evaporating off of me is also an issue, so I have to wear a light jacket when I go jogging and I just change clothes immediately if I splash a lot of water on myself, or shove a dry towel between my body and my clothing.  I also have the systemic effects, like low blood pressure when cold, so I tend to notice first that I get very tired and can't stop yawning. I'm on two 24 hour antihistamines (Zyrtec and Allegra) to alternate every 12 hours, at double the ""maximum"" dosage.  I have to put a towel or blanket down before sitting on tile or stone or I get hives on my butt and thighs. Eating something warm alongside a drink helps to minimize the effects, but most soda fountains are too cold at their default temp to drink alone.  I carry an epi-pen (2, actually) in case I ever do fall into a cool pool or the ocean or get locked outside without a coat in the winter. Anything colder than lukewarm and I itch head to toe.  I don't have typical fevers, but the doctors aren't sure if that's related. My temperature drops very low when I'm sick or have an infection, generally around 92 or 93. If they did try to cool me for a more typical fever, I would go into anyphylactic shock.  I wear a med alert bracelet because room temperature IV fluids cause severe acute vasculitis and my veins will swell closed. Also, it's extremely painful in the limb where the IV is because I get a lot of edema from blood not being able to leave my arm. Didn't find that one out the easy way.  The upsides: It generally isn't permanent, but relapse is common. It tends to be triggered by your body getting out of whack from another illness or virus, though I'm not sure what set mine off. There are people who are allergic to water, sweat, heat, or pressure, and I would say I have it better than them because I can always just pile on more clothes."

My allergist is suspecting that mine is familial cold urticaria because I have full systemic reactions and am not limited to just hives, which generally doesn't resolve. The other treatment is daily immnosuppressant injections, but I work in a vet hospital with a high risk of disease, so it's not a good fit."

KitchenConfidential,36c6hk,tishpickle,7,Mon May 18 05:12:22 2015 UTC,"I was in a similar situation some time ago. Felt like i was being given too much too fast. First few weeks suck ass, but in the long run it was worth it. I feel personally that it gets easier with time. Just gotta stick with it. If after this week you feel like you aren't getting any better then talk to your chef about it. We were all new at some point, and if he isn't a dick he should understand  Edit: also, take a breath, one ticket at a time. Communicate with the other cooks and just try to focus on whats in front of you"
KitchenConfidential,36c6hk,Silentarrowz,8,Mon May 18 05:49:34 2015 UTC,"Yes. Often more. Be happy for the hours. Yes. Ask lots of questions! Nobody should be trying to screw you up and they'd help themselves by making you better. Learn fast. You got thrown into the deep end. Nope. It really is a lifestyle choice I think. No looking back.   Your time in a corporate cubicle world has not done you favors for working in a kitchen. Other than a print out of the recipe book if you are lucky... a syllabus? really? And as someone about to turn 40, at 31 you are very late at entering the game. You can do it! Talk to the chef, get feedback and improve. Everyone catches on, and if you don't, you'll know soon enough."
KitchenConfidential,36c6hk,devoskitchen,2,Mon May 18 06:21:21 2015 UTC,"Some restaurants don't have very structured training procedures. It's a trial by fire. You get thrown in the trenches and just need to work thru it. Working a busy line can be a very challenging at times. It's tough at first, it takes time to get into your stride.  Don't get discouraged and just keep at it. Don't be afraid to ask questions.  The Restaurant industry is brutal. Working 50/60 plus hours a week is usually normal protocol (usually for the Sous/Exe).Be happy you're getting 48hrs. Don't go back to the dish pit. Durring the slower shifts you will have time to hone your skills . YOUR GOING TO GET BETTER. Good luck."

It's best for your self, It's best for the business. You do not want to stick around at a shitty job where you're angry at. Especially not knowing you're going to leave in 2 weeks because you've quitted. You don't have the will to work there, so the quality of your product is going down. The boss knows you're not going to be around after 2 weeks, so he's not going to care for your wants and needs anymore.    The only downside to quitting without notice is The boss has to look for someone new to hire, which might give him a grey hair or 2. But in the end, it will be better for everyone."

One of the places I'm currently working had morale that was steadily plumeting, but we just got a new KM and it's headed back up because he actually gives a shit. Our normal weekly sales sit around 60k and last week we broke our record at 82k, and he personally bought a keg for the kitchen and worked the line by himself with the two cooks who are underage on a Monday so everyone could enjoy it.   Probably cost him $60. Saved him losing 3-4 cooks in the long run though."

KitchenConfidential,36apvr,paidakia,12,Sun May 17 20:52:53 2015 UTC,"Marinades flavor, they don't tendorize. And if you are pounding chicken breasts to 1/2"" they should only take a few minutes to cook. At 15 minutes in what I assume to be a hot oven they are probably already overcooked. So when you reheat them you are just hammering the fucking things.   Try timing then by just grilling them to order.   Plus at 1/2"" the difference in cooking  is going from 38 degrees to 140 (from the refer) vs 70 to 140 (from room temp). You are only cutting down 30% of time by roaching the things.   What's in your marinade? If there is acid in it there is part of your texture issue.   Tl:dr - the chicken is rubbery from being overcooked and or being chemically cooked in the marinade."
KitchenConfidential,36apvr,taint_odour,1 point,Sun May 17 23:44:17 2015 UTC,"Olive oil, beer, vinergar, paprika, salt, pepper, garlic powder - may be leaving some other seasonings, but thats pretty much it.  The problem with cooking to order is we have limited space, and raw, marinated chicken makes a big mess compared to cooking a raw burger or steak.   Is it possible we're leaving the chicken to marinate for too long?"
KitchenConfidential,36apvr,taint_odour,1 point,Mon May 18 14:35:20 2015 UTC,I would say the vinegar is probably why you are getting rubbery chicken. How much is in the marinade compared to the rest of the liquid and how long do you soak it?  I would still reexamine how you parcook. It just sounds way too long. You can still mark it and finish it in the oven on the flattop without hammering it.

KitchenConfidential,36apvr,texasfromjames,3,Sun May 17 23:08:57 2015 UTC,"This. I partially cook chicken breasts relatively often and I found this is the best way to do it. Grill mark, keep in a pan of oil and bay leaves, then finish in the broiler when needed."
KitchenConfidential,36apvr,revzblove,3,Mon May 18 06:27:10 2015 UTC,"We mark them on both sides, just enough for solid marks on a hot ass grill, then tray them on half sheets, cover each breast with 1oz or so of marinade, then oven them for eight minutes. Then into a third on the steam table with the insert at the bottom to keep them from swimming. 10 breasts per half sheet and just keep popping trays in the oven."
KitchenConfidential,36apvr,deathbymike,2,Mon May 18 04:14:07 2015 UTC,"Do you brine it at all? Using a brine as a marinade tends to help with the toughness of par cooked chicken in my experience. We use an apple cider vinegar, salt, rosemary, thyme and sage brine for our roasted leg quarters, which are par cooked and re roasted to order. They never come out rubbery because the acid and salt tenderizes the meat."
KitchenConfidential,36apvr,zombie_moses,2,Sun May 17 21:38:25 2015 UTC,On top of your brine marinade don't use the oven to par cook your chicken. An oven is basically a desert and sucks the moisture out. Your better off with a nice poach in a good broth then ice bath to freeze the cook and finish on broiler.

KitchenConfidential,36apvr,OverLordCliq,1 point,Mon May 18 03:11:19 2015 UTC,Yogurt marinade will tenderize chicken. Vinegar will cook it if it is strong enough and you leave the chicken in a long time. Maybe don't make so much at one time.

Some cooks you can show around the kitchen and then tell them to go make a consomme or a blond Roux or a hand them a case of red snapper and tell him to prep it into 6 oz bias cut portions and they will know to skin it and check for stray bones.

The biggest problem is the sexual harassment. And believe me, that's exactly what it is. First you need to sit the exec and him down. Call him on his shit. If the exec doesn't immediately fix the situation (basically fire the loser or something similar) then you need to go to the owner, tell them you reported the issue and nothing was done and start looking for a new job and a lawyer. Cause it's gonna be uncomfortable there. The other big issue? Where the fuck are the other cooks? You're telling me the chef hasn't noticed and isn't just ignoring it? Sad state when people are to cowardly to do the right thing."

Anyways good luck takes a thick skin to work in the industry. Also any problems on your station are all you, prep cook burns something talk to him throw it out etc. and keep it tight if they are riding you to be perfect it's probably just cause they know you can be and it will show later in your career when you are managing the people who just hold it together. ALSO there is no gender in the kitchen figure your own ways about that. sorry for the long rambling post but yours pissed me off has a real woe is me feeling and that is one more thing to keep the fuck out of the kitchen.

No. I hear what you are saying, he may mean well but it's a mindset that has to change.

In a kitchen, the team is everything. No exceptions. If you're on grill, and sauté starts going down in flames, you aren't afforded the luxury of being excluded from the mess. The kitchen is a singular unit, and by removing yourself from that team dynamic you put not only your coworkers, but the business that pays your bills in a bind. Your attitude sucks, and you need to take a serious look at yourself if you want to make it in this business. Maybe try reserving your judgment for frustrated cooks looking for advice in one of the few social outlets available to people like us, and start to look inward at your own shortcomings. We all have a lot to learn, and we need to strive to improve in all aspects, from food to interpersonal behavior. Stop watching so much Hell's Kitchen, and start doing some real work.

KitchenConfidential,367y72,dyingbreed360,4,Sun May 17 01:45:59 2015 UTC,"1) Get a notepad and pen and WRITE EVERYTHING DOWN. Recipes, temperatures and preparation should all be noted down.   2) Buy a bag of potatoes at home. They are cheap and great for learning and practicing almost any kind of knife technique you will be learning (slice chips, julienne fries, dice cubes), this will also help you with your precision and speed. You'll also feast like a starch king.  3) KEEP YOUR STATION CLEAN. This is the most important skill you'll need. Few things are worse then a cook who works dirty. It effects you, it will effect your coworkers, it will effect your food, and it will effect your restaurant.   4) Breath. It's very easy to get overwhelmed and flustered in this profession, so learning how to step back and take a deep breath to pull yourself together will go along way. Look at your task, evaluate what you need to do, and the best way to do it.   5) Don't let the stress build up. This job can take as much as it can give. Don't let yourself be miserable and do something about whatever is bothering you. This is one of the worst jobs to bottle up."
KitchenConfidential,367y72,xuankicodes,3,Sun May 17 02:59:32 2015 UTC,"Clean everything, like seriously, stick a multitool in your knife kit and when it's a slow night pull apart the things you know are dirty but never get cleaned and clean them. The case plate on the mincer that gets shit stuck in it? It's fucking filthy in there, give it a clean. You'll have a cleaner kitchen and you'll know what the inside of the mincer looks like when it's working. Which is fucking handy when it stops working and you can pull the case off and go, ah, there should be a spring and two screws where there are no longer a spring and two screws. Because sometimes you can find that spring and two screws and save yourself some expensive fixing that it takes forever to get approved.  Keep an eye on everything that's going on, what's par for grill proteins for friday night? What does pastry do with that chocolate tart that sold poorly? What's old? What's low?  Always have a plan if you get asked to step up, Chef wants a special? You've got an idea for the salmon that's getting old, which you know is getting old cos you keep an eye on everything. Be aware that stepping up may not seem like stepping up, you're done for the day but the bar is getting killed and needs help?

If you fuck up, own up to it and apologize, but be able to move forward and fix it without getting rattled.   Bad moods are contagious, and a coworker who can not handle criticism well and needs to complain/vent all the time is a liability. I wish more people knew this.  If you have a question, take the second to think and ask yourself first. Try to be concise and action-oriented when asking for direction from your chef.  Pay attention to the mood and action around you. Learn when is a good time to ask questions and discuss food/technical details or when you need to STFU and keep a sense of urgency.  Always offer to help, but know the difference between being actually useful or being a distraction/in the way."

Sometimes you won't have a moment of quiet solitude to regroup. Its hard, but handling stress is a skill that you can improve by consciously choosing how to react. How well you can suppress your ego determines how objectively you can learn from criticism.  Self-awareness in general will make you a better, more conscientious, coworker. If you want to be the person that everyone loves working with, especially in a clutch situation, then train yourself to stay positive and focused."

KitchenConfidential,363jli,Baconated_Kayos,31,Sat May 16 06:09:16 2015 UTC,"I had a lady that said she was allergic to untoasted sliced almonds. She said she could have the item as long as all the almonds are toasted. I had never heard of this allergy in my life. Our almonds are toasted, but i cant guarantee that her idea of toasted is the same as ours  So I put them in a ramekin on a separate plate and let her decide if they were toasted enough that they would not induce an allergic reaction.  She just dumped em on without even checking.  Psycho bitch."
KitchenConfidential,363jli,Mitzli,47,Fri May 15 22:22:22 2015 UTC,"She may be talking about Oral Allergy Syndrome, which isn't a true food allergy. Heat can break down the compounds/proteins/allergens that cause it, hence toasted being ok but not raw. Only logical explanation I can think of for being ""allergic"" to raw but not toasted almonds.  Personally, I find it less of a hassle to just avoid eating things on my OAS list altogether when I'm dining out."
KitchenConfidential,363jli,jadedgoldfish,19,Fri May 15 22:48:53 2015 UTC,"My husband has this. It's an annoyance, but not an anaphylaxis type emergency. His lips burn a bit, like if you ate spicy food, but that's it. Not worth stressing over; when we go to a restaurant, we don't even mention it."
KitchenConfidential,363jli,Mitzli,24,Fri May 15 22:54:55 2015 UTC,"My reactions vary from just moderately tingly to feeling like I've got ants squirming and biting my lips, mouth, and throat for a good 15 minutes. Depends on what I eat. Apples are tingly so I eat them, but I stay the hell away from kiwis. Fuck ant-bomb kiwis."
KitchenConfidential,363jli,pomegranateangst,9,Fri May 15 23:03:30 2015 UTC,"Yep, that's pretty much how he describes it, too. Except for ants biting, he just says tingling/burning. Apples get him, too. Not sure about kiwi; he doesn't like them so I never bothered to find out."
KitchenConfidential,363jli,Mitzli,7,Fri May 15 23:07:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I get it from kiwis and oddly enough raw almonds. It's not horrible, just a weird tingly/numb feeling in the back of my mouth."
KitchenConfidential,363jli,rabiiiii,3,Fri May 15 23:54:33 2015 UTC,"Raw almonds, apples and carrots for me. Almonds is much more severe though."

KitchenConfidential,363jli,rabiiiii,4,Fri May 15 23:39:20 2015 UTC,"Which is odd because condoms haven't caused issues before. I think my kiwi comes from my tree allergies, since it's listed under birch pollen, too, though maybe not on this particular PDF. I'm definitely super allergic to all kinds of tree pollen."
KitchenConfidential,363jli,rivermandan,2,Fri May 15 23:44:45 2015 UTC,"Birch pollen allergies often have a crossover allergy of soy. When I went in for allergy testing, they ran birch, but only because of a reaction to soy"
KitchenConfidential,363jli,suitsme,2,Sat May 16 01:27:45 2015 UTC,"Interesting. I did not know that. I don't react to soy beans personally, but you don't always react to everything under the watch list for particular pollen. Or maybe all the soy I ingest is cooked enough that it doesn't get me."
KitchenConfidential,363jli,HansBlixJr,2,Sat May 16 03:02:18 2015 UTC,"If i eat a whole bite of raw kiwi, it burns the hell out of my mouth but for some reason my favorite sushi roll with a little sliver of kiwi on top is fine. Maybe it's part allergy and partially your mouth being sensitive to the intense acidity? I would imagine the acidity means the part of the kiwi that irritates you gets in deeper."
KitchenConfidential,363jli,StumbleOn,2,Sat May 16 14:35:59 2015 UTC,Maybe. I just know the last time I ate some was miserable and I swore them off after that. It sucks because they're delicious but it's not worth the crazy burning and itching.
KitchenConfidential,363jli,Mitzli,2,Sat May 16 16:12:40 2015 UTC,That's funny. My wife is allergic (probably not too serious but we're not in a hurry to experiment) to untoasted nuts like almonds and she's also allergic to latex. I never thought there might be a connection.

KitchenConfidential,363jli,HitlersThong,3,Sat May 16 00:57:16 2015 UTC,"It's quite likely, then! It took me literally several years to figure it out. I had never had an issue with any foods until senior year in college, and it first popped up eating almonds. (God do I miss tree nuts.) Then certain fruits started bugging me. I thought I was flat out allergic at first, but the reactions weren't ever more than localized to my mouth and throat.  Flash forward a few years and I stumbled across OAS web surfing one day. The detail about being able to eat things cooked was what flipped the light switch for me. It was a eureka moment. Taking the skins off of things with skins can help, too, though I guess that's not relevant to raspberries."
KitchenConfidential,363jli,Mitzli,2,Sat May 16 03:05:34 2015 UTC,Now I'm waiting for people who go out to eat and order their raspberries peeled.

KitchenConfidential,363jli,Mitzli,4,Sat May 16 16:11:32 2015 UTC,"Holy shit I have this with raw almonds too and never knew it was a real thing,  so I never bothered mentioning it to anyone and just avoid eating almonds. This is nuts, TIL I'm not totally insane."
KitchenConfidential,363jli,pomegranateangst,3,Sat May 16 03:04:34 2015 UTC,"Some nuts, almonds included make my mouth itch and I wheeze a bit, unless they have been roasted first. It's a weird one. I didn't always have this problem, but it seems to have crept up on me. It took me awhile to figure out the roasting solution but it seems to work for me.  Fortunately it's not life threatening so I don't even mention it at a restaurant. When I cook with nuts, I make sure that they get a good heat cycle.  I've lived my life having all sorts of annoying response to various things and am kind of used to being itchy."
KitchenConfidential,363jli,Mitzli,3,Sat May 16 07:34:03 2015 UTC,Omg thank you! I just found out why I always get an itchy and swollen throat when I eat a bunch of fruit. I always assumed that it was some kind of fertilizer or pesticide they use on fruit. Apparently it's pollen!
KitchenConfidential,363jli,novas0x2a,3,Sat May 16 14:00:07 2015 UTC,"Np! As I said to someone else, it took me years to put the pieces together and figure it out."

KitchenConfidential,363jli,MentalOverload,8,Fri May 15 22:53:36 2015 UTC,"Lol! I'm not saying it's definitely what she had, just seemed like a possibility. She should honestly just ignore it or order something else even if it is the case."
KitchenConfidential,363jli,Kalypso_,1 point,Fri May 15 22:59:43 2015 UTC,"I definitely have mild OAS with some things, but I was wondering if shrimp could be one of them- I have always treated it like a legit but not too serious allergy because it makes my mouth itch, but could it be a mouth only reaction? I sometimes unknowingly eat something with shrimp in it and feel fine. I know shrimp has no pollen, but am curious about whether my reaction to it is just a topical thing."
KitchenConfidential,363jli,GnomeCzar,2,Sat May 16 14:42:52 2015 UTC,I've never heard about it with shrimp - just food items that grow on tree/plants. I'd be super careful with shrimp still.
KitchenConfidential,363jli,Kalypso_,1 point,Sat May 16 16:09:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's what I thought. I was just hoping since I don't seem to have a reaction if some is mixed in and I don't know it."
KitchenConfidential,363jli,Baconated_Kayos,2,Sat May 16 16:10:46 2015 UTC,"My archery coach back in college had a serious shellfish allergy and they can be dangerous. Shrimp would hospitalize him, so be suuuper careful until you get it tested (if you ever get it tested). I want to get tested for tree nuts personally since that's the one I don't know if it's a true deadly allergy or OAS and I miss eating them so, so badly. Especially pistachios and almonds."
KitchenConfidential,363jli,Kalypso_,12,Sat May 16 16:23:54 2015 UTC,"For what it's worth, I have the same problem. The way Oral Allergy Syndrome works is it's a crossover with nasal allergies; when you sneeze due to hay fever, it's most likely a reaction to a specific protein in the pollen you breathed. That same protein is present in some foods, and if your immune system is already stressed from the pollen, it may also react to you ingesting the protein. In my particular case, I react rather badly to Birch pollen, which contains a protein that is also present in large quantities in apples, pears, cherries, and almonds.  Cooking the protein solves the problem because it denatures, changing its shape and preventing your immune system from recognizing it; it doesn't really take very much heat to do so. (For sliced almonds in particular, it's pretty easy to tell from sight or smell that  they've been heated enough)  Most OAS symptoms are pretty mild, mine manifest as an extremely uncomfortable itch in my gums and back of my throat. You shouldn't count on it being mild in general, though; my friend carries an epipen after an incident with a cherry. It sounds like that woman is basically in my position; she likes almonds and she's also allergic to them (goddamn I miss raw apples and pears :().  I don't think I've ever brought it up in a restaurant before, though; I don't really like almonds, and the other stuff is pretty easy to avoid if I don't think it's cooked enough (like garnishes on apple crumble or something)."
KitchenConfidential,363jli,h_lehmann,3,Fri May 15 23:23:07 2015 UTC,"I would love to see a chemical breakdown of a cooked almond vs raw.  I've been meaning to implement a microscope in my kitchen to truly show the change in chemical structures to my peons, I think I just found my ""reason to do it"" for my owners.  Allergies are nothing to fuck with, much like the wu tang clan..."
KitchenConfidential,363jli,Bongfu,2,Sat May 16 05:44:05 2015 UTC,"Mine is the same way, and I used to eat the foods anyway because I didn't know.  Raw nuts and cherries always made me all scratchy but I never thought much of it.  I thought it happened to everyone.    Then one day I ate half a bag of cherries and my lips swelled up quite a bit.  I avoid these things now if I can, but I'll eat a cherry here and there and I don't really worry about eating raw nuts, I just try not to eat them in significant quantities."
KitchenConfidential,363jli,halifaxdatageek,11,Sat May 16 17:25:49 2015 UTC,My husband is allergic to raw bananas but not cooked ones. He rarely orders them anyways.

Bee bread is the bee pollen with added honey and bee secretions and stored in brood cells,  chambers of wood and mud created by female ground-nesting bees.  When the pollen ball is complete, a single female lays an egg on top of the pollen ball, and seals the brood cell.  Pollen balls are harvested as food for humans. Bee pollen is sometimes referred to as ambrosia.   Foraging bees bring pollen back to the hive, where they pass it off to other worker bees, who pack the pollen into cells with their heads. During collection and possibly packing, the pollen is mixed with nectar and bee salivary secretions. Bee pollen is the primary source of protein for the hive.

Just back yourself and you'll get there. Limit your menu (as suggested already) if needs be but you might need more staff. 130 seats and only a few cooks doesn't sound heaps to me.

It's good that we've been so busy as that allows me to better figure out what works and what doesn't on the line. We're making very slow progress, but progress nonetheless.

Also, you are gonna have to overstaff and take the labor hit. It will let you cover your ass if a station gets hit and let's more people train at once. A lot of opening restaurants plan on running high labor up for the first couple weeks. Then you will get an idea of who can do what, not fall behind in prep, etc. make sure the menu is fairly spread between stations. But you're just going to have to grit your teeth through some shit for a month or two probably. Also might help to call a friend. Bring in a ringer or two to start shifting the crappy staff out."

KitchenConfidential,3645iw,ChefGuru,6,Sat May 16 01:03:11 2015 UTC,"Sticker wars! See how many you can get on each persons back. My highest is thirteen on one person, on top of tagging everyone in the BOH before anyone noticed ;-)"
KitchenConfidential,3645iw,EldritchInquisitor,3,Sat May 16 02:55:46 2015 UTC,Oh for fucks sake.

KitchenConfidential,3645iw,erikpotter82,1 point,Sun May 17 03:12:00 2015 UTC,"They looks like crocs. To be honest, they are comfortable as fuck and a 30 dollar pair will last you at least a year."
KitchenConfidential,3645iw,BakeAndStrips,1 point,Sun May 17 06:50:10 2015 UTC,Either crock or shoes for crews.   I'm trying to figure how OP gets away with having the holes in the side. IME  that has not been allowed.
KitchenConfidential,3645iw,SardonicKiller,1 point,Sun May 17 12:18:01 2015 UTC,It's definitely this. If you look closely at OP's it has the croc logo. Also its funny because they are specifically designed for kitchen use.
KitchenConfidential,3645iw,BakeAndStrips,1 point,Sun May 17 15:20:52 2015 UTC,"Croc Bistro is nonslip cook shoes, they have no holes on the side. Crocs with holes are regular crocs, not work safe."
KitchenConfidential,3645iw,jwccs46,1 point,Tue May 19 19:15:11 2015 UTC,Shoes for crews are ruined after 3-4 months for everyone I know that have gotten them.
KitchenConfidential,3645iw,igotitforfree,1 point,Tue May 19 01:43:38 2015 UTC,"Crocs bistro. Had them 3 years now. I swear by them. Comfortable as the fuck, light, durable, and you can throw em in the dishwasher at the end of the shift. Those are Batali edition. $25-$30 on amazon."
KitchenConfidential,3645iw,jwccs46,1 point,Mon May 18 22:37:17 2015 UTC,did you cut holes in the sides? Bistros don't have holes.
