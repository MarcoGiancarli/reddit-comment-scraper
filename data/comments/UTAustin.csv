I think he said something along the lines of certain professors doing research / teaching higher level  classes , something like that, get their classes ahead of time , and then the rest of the professors get assigned all the remaining unlisted  classes sometime before the start of school for the classes which a lot of them can teach, like 408d or low level courses. Like my professor said that sometimes he teaches x and y , other times he teaches y and z, etc.   Im not sure so don't take my word for it"

So you might get a professor who is good, but wasn't planning on teaching a 408 course, or one of the professors who wanted to teach might pick up another section. Some teachers like to remain unlisted on their course, but that's usually the higher level maths (Dr. Goddard is notorious for doing this with the M427K - differential equations - course)."
UTAustin,3e12d5,TINTINN95,2,Tue Jul 21 03:27:57 2015 UTC,Thanks for the detailed answers! You answered most of my questions! But the tuition fee is 18k per semester?! I thought it was 18k per year.. Well that's gonna drive expenses up by too much.
UTAustin,3e12d5,kor321,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:57:58 2015 UTC,"I am an international student studying Computer Science so I hope this helps.   Does non-Texan resident tuition fee = international student tuition fee? I've not come across this term before so I'm quite confused. But from what is available at the website, it states the the tuition fee alone for non-Texan resident is about 18k. Just want to clear that up.   Yeah I think non-Texas resident tuition fee = international student tuition free. Just keep in mind that 18k is per SEMESTER (I think). There are also other fees and things that you need to pay. Check this page   How long is the CS program? I must be blind but I can't find any information pertaining to the length of the program.   If you're coming in as a freshman in 2016, you'll probably follow this degree plan. The CS program is 127 hours.   Is the CS program strictly just studying or does it have any internship/working period? eg, Study-Intern-Study-Intern?   I believe you can take a course so that your internship would count as a 3 hour course or something like that. BUT, as far as I know, the CS department does not require students to work. I know that some engineering departments have a Co-op program but I don't think the CS program has anything like that. That being said, a lot of people do study during the year, and work over the summer. However, you need to keep in mind that a lot of the students at UT have some AP credits and dropped a course or two (sometimes even more). As an international student (unless you took an international diploma or something similar), you will probably come in with 0 credits. This means that you have complete all 127 hours in 4 years (you can take longer if you want to, I guess). A lot of people tend to complete their core requirements at community colleges over the summer or over winter break. This could be either online on an actual class.   Is is really hard to get a job in USA for a foreigner like me? Been reading about several cases where foreigners, with USA Degrees, having a hard time finding a job. My hope is to work in the tech industry of course, Silicon Valley would be nice. Will the a CS Degree in UTAustin help me in that?   It honestly depends on a lot of stuff. I know a couple of international students who have had internships. But the process isn't as easy as speaking english well. A lot of companies do not hire international students, but at the same time a lot do. After you get an offer, you have to go through the international office to get some paper work done and that WILL take a while. A friend of mine did not enjoy the process of getting this paper done through the international office at UT.   Also, students start looking for internships in the Fall, if they were not lucky to get an offer, they continue they search in the spring.  After graduation, I know that F-1 visa students have a year (maybe two) to work full time in the US. I believe what you're referring to when you said ""Been reading about several cases where foreigners, with USA Degrees, having a hard time finding a job"" are people who used this year or two and did not get a visa afterwards and had to go back.  Hope this helps, let me know if you have any more questions."

UTAustin,3dy5ki,c0c0c0,6,Mon Jul 20 14:22:00 2015 UTC,"That seems really high. But I guess if they're counting undergrads that ""research"" for a semester (or less) before quitting, maybe it's possible."

It's too short to really get a decent idea of the classes, even though the tests they give are actual tests, and unless you really dazzle the professors it's not a big deal.

I can tell you that connecting through the local network probably won't work and might ruin streaming for everyone on your router but you should be able to connect via the internet at large through your plex account. If you can, use an ethernet cable for your media hosting computer and run a speedtest to make sure you're actually getting the right speed.

UTAustin,3ds754,dubzors,2,Sun Jul 19 13:32:23 2015 UTC,"Don't know much about Plex Media Server. After a quick look through their documentation, though, it looks like it should work. Most of the protocols and ports used are allowed on Resnet... with one big caveat.  It most likely will not work (or won't work well) if the Plex server itself is on WiFi. I'd suggest connecting the Plex server to the wired port in your room if you're going to do this.  It looks like Plex has its a couple of discovery protocols -- both Bonjour and their own GDM. If that's the only way to get a client connected, it probably won't work. Bonjour doesn't work on the campus WiFi, and if GDM uses some broadcast/multicast mechanism as well, it will very likely also fail. If Plex allows you to enter a specific IP address or hostname to connect the client to the server, it should be fine. You can even request a static IP address from Resnet (see this page).  Other than that, just make sure you aren't violating any of the University's AUP. Section 5 of the AUP covers the main points. Most of it is pretty common sense."

UTAustin,3dnz02,monsiurpotato,3,Fri Jul 17 20:39:39 2015 UTC,"Hi, I work at UT athletics box offices. The Big Ticket means you have a ticket to every game included in the package. You can scan your UT ID at the gate for admission once you've purchased the Big Ticket.  Edit: To say it more simply, yes, it is a pass to get into the games."
UTAustin,3dnz02,BackHanderson,2,Fri Jul 17 20:49:44 2015 UTC,"I bought one recently and I was confused as well.  From my understanding, the big ticket is admission to any home game. For football, you have a reserved seat. So you must print your ticket (or oick it up at will call, which ever you choose to do) and bring your student ID to get that seat. You also have admission to other home games, like volleyball and basketball. However, you do not get a reserved seat. So if it's a sold out basketball game, the student section will fill fast, so you should get there early to try to claim one of the spots usig your big ticket. Since there is no guaranteed seat, you don't have to print a ticket (cause you shouldn t have one), just bring your ID.  TL;DR admission to any home sports event. Reserved/guaranteed seat for football, no guaranteed spot for other sports (basketball, volleyball, etc)"
UTAustin,3dor2w,gibby_10,2,Sat Jul 18 00:35:49 2015 UTC,"Not sure about journalism, but advertising is an incredibly varied degree depending on what you specialize in. If you take the Media or Account Planner routes, it's going to be much more business-minded/strategy/conceptual stuff. You'll plan out ad campaigns but you won't really make them. If you decide on Texas Creative (best of luck!) you'll actually be creating ads and all sorts of cool things. Probably the most ""creative"" department in all of UT, and super prestigious. But it's a hell of a lot of work.    I actually have been through the Texas Creative sequence, and despite the workload, I can say without a doubt it was the best decision I made in college. In those three semesters I created TV commercials, print ads, posters, mobile ads, radio ads, games, product extensions/merchandise, some cool guerilla stuff, and much more. I got to make some neat things with some really neat people, and Texas Creative made that possible.    Do you have any specific questions about advertising or Texas Creative? I'm a senior graduating in one semester and I'd be happy to give some input. I have lots of friends in both Creative and Media."
UTAustin,3dor2w,Vox_Atomic,3,Sat Jul 18 02:04:09 2015 UTC,"--- Why did you choose this major and what do you like most about this degree?  --- What were some of the typical assignments you received on a regular basis from your classes?   --- As a Texas Creative, did you take design or art-related classes?   --- How are the internship opportunities and the variety of the ones open to you?   --- What are some of the internships you have taken and what were they like?   Any additional information outside of these questions you don't mind sharing would be great.Thank you so much :) !"
UTAustin,3dor2w,Vox_Atomic,2,Sat Jul 18 14:13:24 2015 UTC,"I chose advertising as a major because I've always considered myself a creative person, but I feared doing a purely 100% creative major (art, music, design, etc) would limit my career options. Advertising prepares you with some real practical business chops. In your intro classes, it's kind of a crapshoot in terms of assignments since they have to appeal to everyone (creative, media, accounts, PR, etc) so you kind of get a bit of everything. For one project you might write a case study, and for another you might create a print ad. In general, though, you get VERY LITTLE essay/writing type assignments except for in a couple way-upper-division classes. Most assignments in the ad department are group projects, focused on building advertising campaigns together with a team. No. I'm pretty much self-taught. When you apply for Texas Creative, you're pretty much expected to have at least the basics down. You don't need to be a great artist by any means, but you'll need to understand the core components of writing, design, layout, photoshop, stuff like that. Texas Creative will not teach you the basics, it jumps right in to the hard stuff. LOTS of internship opportunities if you are in Texas Creative. If you make it past P1, you'll have no problem getting solid internships with just a little bit of effort. Especially if you win a couple awards. People from my cohort interned in Austin, Dallas, LA, Chicago, Detroit, Brazil, and lots of other places. Texas Creative is a very well-renowned program that places you a cut above the rest, and the internships do follow. I have taken 2 internships. One was with a production studio/ad agency in LA, and the other was with a company that designs & manufactures electronic instruments and DJ gear here in Austin. Both were great; the first one I got a lot of experience on-set working with TV commercials, and the second one I got a lot of experience in-studio designing things like trade show displays, print ads, and cool UI/UX stuff.   That being said, I have found advertising to be an unfulfilling career choice. I love creating cool things, and I love the experience, connections, and skills this major has given me, but I'm not even considering advertising as a career at this point. I'm applying the things I've learned to work on a startup I co-founded, which I find to be much more exciting than advertising ever could be. I want to make things people want, not make people want things. If that makes sense."

Not all of my credits applied to my degree plan, but all were transferred and they will take all eligible classes to apply to your degree plan.  The hitch is that you must complete a certain amount of hours at UT and with a lot of credits, you may find yourself with a complete degree plan, but having to take several classes to make up the in-house hours required to graduate.  You can either take a lot of electives or you can do a dual major or double major.  I did a dual major and dual minor, rather than take a lot of classes that didn't do anything but add in-house credits.  But, you can certainly take lots of electives and there are many blow-off classes available to fill up those slots."

UTAustin,3dcrgg,tonyofhousestark_,2,Wed Jul 15 06:49:25 2015 UTC,"nah i'm actually one of the rare people at UT who does economics just because they really want to study that.  Go to most other top schools and economics is very respected as a major, that being said it is a more broad degree so you don't have as much specialization as a finance major which some find challenging in job searches because there are a lot of things you can do but not one industry you've been specifically bred to enter.  This shouldn't cause much concern if you're looking to go into the finance industry because banks, consulting firms, PE, and hedge funds all like economics majors as well."

UTAustin,3dcrgg,Jesus4Jews,1 point,Wed Jul 15 10:18:53 2015 UTC,"The job prospects are great.... if you know what you want to do post-graduation, do internships, and prepare yourself accordingly. If you spend 3 years doing classes and nothing else, its going to be much harder for you. The great thing about the major is that you can set yourself up for a career in pretty much anything. Also, a lot of non-majors don't really know what skills econ majors graduate with.. and that causes a lot difficulties when the hiring manager / HR isn't familiar with what the major entails. Another difficulty is that you're competing with highly-specialized Mccombs majors that are pretty much bred for corporate america.

I worked 30 hours a week during high school stocking, and I was working every minute of it. I was envious of all of my friends with jobs where they could sit down and finish schoolwork."
UTAustin,3d6egk,Stolsdos,3,Mon Jul 13 22:52:30 2015 UTC,"It depends on what you want to get from the job. If it's mostly down time, you'll be able to do homework, take a nap, or whatever, but you might not be gaining as much useful work experience. On the other hand, it can be lower stress, and you still get paid."
UTAustin,3d6egk,mrflarp,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:13:42 2015 UTC,"Definitely true in regards to work experience, but I'm thinking more along the lines of being able to have downtime every ten minutes for ten minutes and the like, that would be ideal. Not much like being able to take a nap for an hour, because, like you said, work experience is important."
UTAustin,3d6egk,Stolsdos,3,Mon Jul 13 23:46:42 2015 UTC,"It depends on what you want out of it. I'm a chemistry major, and my first year I had a work study job in a bio lab. 10 hours a week, and I got valuable experience that set me up for my current internship in a bio-inorganic lab.  Library jobs may be dull, but you get to do your homework, study, etc. It's great.  In honesty, you can't go wrong with most work study jobs, unless you choose something you have 0 interest in."
UTAustin,3d5qjq,gecka,4,Mon Jul 13 19:04:34 2015 UTC,"UT actually has the Student Veteran Services (SVS) Office, which provides some fantastic information on their website. They also have full-time staff available for questions & answers as well.  The closest thing we probably have here at UT for your stated interests, would be the Computer Science degree. This page has a list of all of the classes the CS department offers, so you can see if any of those would be of interest to you.  Down at the bottom of the previous link, you'll notice an area for ""CS classes for non-majors). Many of those will work toward an Elements of Computing Certificate, which is something you can pursue while enrolled in any other major at UT Austin (though I personally don't know how that would gel with Hazelwood/degree completion).  I hope that helps a bit, but if you have any specific questions feel free to let me know and I'll do my best to answer!"
UTAustin,3d5qjq,AtypicalAnaphora,3,Mon Jul 13 20:07:47 2015 UTC,"Admissions counselors should be able to talk to you about Hazlewood benefits. Questions about specific courses/departments are better fielded by advisors in those departments. You'd probably want to get in touch with some CS (or maybe MIS? I'm not sure) people for those kinds of classes. Most departments also list their course offering somewhere on their website. For instance, here is the CS department's courses."
UTAustin,3d5qjq,derodotus,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:01:29 2015 UTC,the question that you are asking about the Hazlewood Act is yes and the right answer is you can use the Hazlewood Act and your GI Bill at the same time. To apply go to you https://www.ebenefits.va.gov/ebenefits/homepage

Lots of people looking to sublet and you could likely get them to pay for some of the rent still making it even cheaper than signing in the spring.

UTAustin,3d44kg,tcba_youknow,3,Mon Jul 13 11:01:40 2015 UTC,"First, congratulations on your admittance to CS and UT Austin! Luckily, UT has a ton of opportunities for research, so if FRI doesn't happen, you can definitely look into some alternatives.  The place I'd start with is the Office of Undergraduate Research (OUR) in the School of Undergraduate Studies. They offer info sessions and their website has a step-by-step guide of how to get into research here at UT Austin.  The second resource I want to mention is technically part of the OUR, but I mention it separately because it's a helpful tool. EUREKA allows you to search current research projects as well as look into what interests certain faculty may have in regards to research so you can contact them.  The third resource is a little more specific, but OUR UT is research as well, but done within Higher Ed/Student Affairs. There is a class called Research Methods (UGS 312) which is an ""Interdisciplinary introduction to research methods, designed to lead students through the process of designing an undergraduate research project.""  I know less about these, but since you mentioned CS, this is the list of research areas in the CS department specifically. You could look into these as possibilities as well, but I'm not sure how first-year-friendly they are.  I hope that gives you some places to start; best of luck!"
UTAustin,3d44kg,AtypicalAnaphora,3,Mon Jul 13 14:00:55 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot. This is exactly what I was looking for.  Your answer reminds me of another question I had, which is about how approachable and friendly professors are. I'm not from the United State, so I'm not entirely sure how the student-professor relationship culture is there. A lot of people (on reddit and friends I've spoken to) say it's very easy to shoot an email off to a professor asking for guidance and/or a research opportunity. Do professors entertain such communication? As in, I understand that they may choose not to offer me a position and stuff, but does sending them an email like that annoy them and stuff? Sorry if this is a silly question, and thanks again!"
UTAustin,3d44kg,AtypicalAnaphora,2,Mon Jul 13 17:03:23 2015 UTC,"The ease really depends on the professor truthfully. Though I am comfortable in saying that many/most are more than happy to have you e-mail them with questions and are excited when you demonstrate interest in their research. In your first e-mail to any professor though, you always want to be almost overly formal: ""Dear Professor X, [insert question here] Sincerely, tbca_youknow""  After that you can match their tone if they're very informal, but I made the mistake of e-mailing a professor with only a semi-formal tone and they were none too pleased (that being said, I later found out she had the reputation of being a very intense individual in general).  You could also approach them during office hours as well if you would prefer to speak with them in-person as opposed to through an electronic medium such as e-mail."
UTAustin,3d44kg,Arknave,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:58:38 2015 UTC,"I see, thanks!"
UTAustin,3d44kg,ramchand917,2,Mon Jul 13 20:37:37 2015 UTC,"Also go up to professors and mention your interest in research. Even if your professors aren't interested in taking on students, they likely know colleagues who are!"

UTAustin,3d3tev,Fastpakii,5,Mon Jul 13 08:18:34 2015 UTC,"There is a fair amount of calculus in Micro Theory (420k). That class is kinda considered the weed-out class for econ majors, so try to take it as soon as possible if you want to know if econ is right for you."
UTAustin,3d3tev,FrostyTheBR0man,2,Mon Jul 13 12:43:58 2015 UTC,Is there a calculator restriction? Does that class allow a TI 84?  Or which calculator should I get throughout the econ degree?
UTAustin,3d3tev,rant_about_love,2,Mon Jul 13 22:23:11 2015 UTC,"I think the TI 84 should be fine. As long as you can do basic functions and are comfortable on the machine, any calculator should be good."
UTAustin,3d3tev,FrostyTheBR0man,3,Tue Jul 14 14:07:19 2015 UTC,"I was an economics major at UT. I never thought there was a huge amount of calculus involved in any of my economics classes. You do have to take Calc 1 and 2 for business majors but that was the extent of it I thought. Micro-theory involved taking 2nd and 3rd degree derivatives but that was it, also keep in mind I took it during summer which I would suggest for everyone. If you take it during the year then I believe it's a little more calculus based.  Also it really depends on the classes you choose to take after micro and macro because many of them do have more math than I ever wanted to take. So I would choose your classes well and you shouldn't have a problem."
UTAustin,3d3tev,DoctorOctopus,2,Mon Jul 13 13:29:17 2015 UTC,What are the job prospects like for an Econ major at UT? I'm fixing to enter my junior year and I'm getting a little discouraged because the job listings through COLA career services are really weak.
UTAustin,3d3tev,ODA157,4,Mon Jul 13 17:22:54 2015 UTC,"I'm going to answer very truthfully because it's something I would have wanted before I transferred to Econ. Economics is a very versatile degree almost to a fault, in the way that accounting jobs, finance jobs, marketing jobs would just rather have one of those majors because they think it is easier to justify. It's great for graduate schools and it's great for proving you're not like any other liberal arts major. Unfortunately many recruiters do not understand what economics majors actually did in college so they don't value the degree. It is not a business degree but the more you can sell it as one the better off you'll be. I believe as an economics major I had to sell myself A LOT more than a business major would have. I had to let them know that Econ was a difficult major that prepared me for anything business because there was both math and business fundamentals. So TBH finding a job is a lot more on you then it would be if you had the McCombs name behind you. Also COLA sucks balls. They have a terrible career website. I just used the university wide one, Myaccess.edu. Also don't be afraid to go on indeed.com, monster.com and LinkedIn jobs.   Economics is VERY useful if you double it with another degree btw, every person I know that did that is pulling in very big money right now (they're all consultants of some kind). Economics by itself (that's what I did and I'm a year out of school) they are all in the recruiting department or working for start ups/ entry level financial analyst jobs at small firms. Also sales is always an option.   Conclusions: find companies you like and go directly to their website to look for Job openings, COLA will not help you.   Sorry for the rant but if you have any more questions let me know and I'll help ya out."
UTAustin,3d3tev,DoctorOctopus,3,Mon Jul 13 18:01:23 2015 UTC,"I appreciate the response. I guess at first I was a little naive in thinking that an economics degree from UT was a slam dunk for getting hired as an analyst for a big bank but I'm starting to see that that's only true in rare cases. My biggest fear is getting stuck with some $40k a year entry level job. I simply can't afford for that to happen. I might start looking into the analyst positions at the federal agencies i.e. FBI, CIA. I think my military background would give me a leg up for those positions."
UTAustin,3d3tev,ODA157,3,Mon Jul 13 18:25:38 2015 UTC,"I have a friend who started working as an intelligence analyst with the Navy as his first job after Econ and I think he's doing well. Honestly, I know I made I might've sounded negative but I would try all the options you can, you never know what a recruiter will think after looking at your resume. I do have one friend who is working for Goldman Sachs as an analyst and she was just Economics at UT, but the thing is I know for a fact that they got her cheap and she's making around 38K a year..."
UTAustin,3d3tev,DoctorOctopus,2,Mon Jul 13 18:39:41 2015 UTC,I've actually been in contact with GS. Surprised to hear that they started her out so low on the pay scale. She probably should have negotiated for more than that. At least with them you have opportunities to transfer into the revenue departments and make real good money after a few years.
UTAustin,3d3tev,ODA157,2,Mon Jul 13 18:48:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah you're right, from what I've found getting your foot in the door is the hardest part. Once you're there its up to you to prove yourself and climb the ladder, it's not like anyone is going to care what your major is even 3 years after college.  Good luck with GS, I really hope you get what you want dude."
UTAustin,3d3tev,DoctorOctopus,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:06:10 2015 UTC,"I appreciate the honesty. You say that economics paired with another degree is great, do you think that getting a MSF would open doors?"
UTAustin,3d3tev,qpasche,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:29:07 2015 UTC,Yes I think it would. I actually don't know a lot about the MSF program but I know that McCombs programs like that are extremely useful (and cost effective if you're going for a masters anyways). I know a few Econ students who got accepted into the MPA one year program and they are doing great. Most of them became tax consultants with a big 4.
UTAustin,3d3tev,DoctorOctopus,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:50:37 2015 UTC,I've also looked into the MSF program but I'm not sure how competitive a 3.2 GPA makes me. I know that their placement is great. It's just about a lock for investment banking.
UTAustin,3d3tev,ODA157,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:42:59 2015 UTC,It's just about a lock for investment banking.   Not unless you have previous experience in investment banking. (summer analyst experience and the like)

I've been wondering about this program for a while. I know it's better than the BFP (bus foundations program) but, how useful is it? (Going to be an Econ major at UT wondering if it's worth transferring to mccombs simply for career services because that stuff is important, but I really just want to do econ I love it... need to justify it for some reason.

Be prepared to stand in exceedingly long lines. Attend the required events. Do not feel as if you need to attend any of the others as there are plenty of other opportunities to explore. If you know Austin then do a little exploring, just don't venture too far from campus. The Drag has some fun restaurants, for example.  Make sure you bring toiletries. A towel and soap is a must as the bathrooms are literally empty. The rooms were fine for me, but hey, I'm originally from the north so cold doesn't faze me. Other people say they're somewhat chilly.   If you bring a laptop/tablet, they will have you line up outside the student services building. It is not required that you stand in this line to register for classes. It is easy enough to just go online at 2:00 PM and choose from there. Registration can be done at https://utdirect.utexas.edu/registration/registration.WBX and the course schedule can be accessed through https://utdirect.utexas.edu/apps/registrar/course_schedule/20159/.   If you're a CS student, make sure you spend as much time as you can in the CS building. Maybe I'm biased, but it's that much better than any other building on campus.   Bring money. You can certainly get away without it, but if you're like me and you like adventure you might need it. If you plan on staying in your dorm all day, then hey, maybe you can survive on the meal card.   Be friendly. Say hi to your neighbors during events; you'll make friends from that alone.  Just make sure you register for classes as close to 2 as you can get. They will certainly open some for this orientation session, but you're also competing with all the kids from previous orientation settings trying to steal a better spot. Be ready."
UTAustin,3d3lkk,dune297,7,Mon Jul 13 07:36:16 2015 UTC,"I attended the first orientation....

Many classes are filled, so what you may be doing is registering for classes you need, but don't necessarily want, then making use of add/drop. You should hear more about that at Orientation, but you'll have more chances than just orientation to make changes to your schedule. As other people switch their classes around, some of the classes you want may open.  Bring comfortable shoes. You'll be doing a lot of walking (particularly if you plan on going exploring)."

You could graduate early and start a master's program, though.   I agree with what /u/kondor87 said - if you want to get your master's after getting an engineering degree, a technical one would be far more beneficial than an MBA."
UTAustin,3d1z2r,chairmanchang,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:05:11 2015 UTC,There is a MS in Engineering Management. It's an excellent program and in my opinion much better than an MBA. I'm going to finish the program in December.
UTAustin,3d1z2r,kondor87,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:45:48 2015 UTC,Whoa. That actually sounds right up my alley. Would you mind elaborating on what differentiates it from an MBA?
UTAustin,3d1z2r,sherlocksrobot,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:11:56 2015 UTC,"The curriculum is focused on subjects most important to engineering managers. Project management, product development, and risk Analysis. I have a co-worker getting his MBA.  We compare notes and it's similar  However he's getting a lot more finance and accounting thrown at him. As an engineer you need to know some of that stuff but not to the level he's learning it.  Look at the curriculum of the Executive  MBA, vs. Engineering Management , which I think are most equivalent. If you feel ambitious and don't have a career waiting for you after your undergrad you can finish the program in a year, otherwise it's two.  Another path to consider is the Business Foundation Certificate. I did some thing similar for my undergrad (minor in business administration), which if you still want to pursue a MBA or MSEM that will give you a really strong foundation on which to build.   If you do decide to pursue a master's I strongly feel the Engineering Management program is one of the best in the country, and speaking from experience it has already helped me advance in my career. The faculty and staff is top notch, the coursework is challenging and engaging, the students come from all engineering backgrounds, and bring a diverse and unique perspective to the learning environment."
UTAustin,3d1z2r,kondor87,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:13:49 2015 UTC,So what would I expect for the project portion of this degree? I want to do this degree but I am concerned that in my line of work I wouldn't have much to use for the class.
UTAustin,3d1z2r,robo_reddit,2,Mon Jul 13 03:10:15 2015 UTC,"The project is an independent study that you choose based on the subject matter in the curriculum, I can guarantee that you will have plenty of use for the classes.   Also keep in mind it takes the place of a master's thesis, there is a lot of work that goes in to it."
UTAustin,3d1z2r,kondor87,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:36:48 2015 UTC,"Okay I was under the impression that you pick something from your job to work on.

If you have a high GPA you will get some interviews but maybe not all of the banks unless you are BHP too. Internships will help out a ton. Most kids will have them. Honestly breaking into banking is all about doing the right process. Join IBA this fall, network your balls off and you will get some interviews and then crush those"

UTAustin,3czy0p,TexasFiend,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:39:35 2015 UTC,Investment Banking Association. It's run by the kids who got top offers the year before and they mentor the juniors going into recruiting. The last few years the kids have gotten pretty into it and it seems to really help out recruiting now. So much so that some banks will ask why you weren't in it
UTAustin,3czy0p,drummer1059,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:44:45 2015 UTC,What's better to do the MPA or MSF to get into banking? I'm hearing since the MSF is fairly new and doesn't have it's full legs yet the MPA is better to do because it's the #1 accounting program in the nation and has the respect of the IB scene in the energy industry and such.
UTAustin,3cyosp,1st_lt_Hawkeye,3,Sat Jul 11 23:55:21 2015 UTC,This is the answer from the recsports site:   Students who have enrolled for both summer sessions have access to all RecSports facilities for the entire summer months. Students who have enrolled for just a single summer session are encouraged to try scanning in before purchasing an Interim Student Pass. It might be valid for the entire summer.

You'll especially realize this as most of your classes are far more theoretical than practical when it comes to their application. Several student-run clubs organize projects across a range of size and complexity. Here's a couple of good ones (that haven't been mentioned yet):  1) Longhorn Maker Studio Club (I don't think the club has a site yet, but here's the main page)  They use everything from 3D printers to plasma cutters to CNC milling, and it's all VERY beginner-oriented. The Maker Studio is a great place to do projects, and I'm totally jealous that you'll have it for your entire time in college, whereas I only had it for the last year.  2) ASME Rube Golberg Team (Here's a video of a past machine)  This is the Mech. E, org, but sometimes IEEE (the Electrical Eng equivalent) or AIAA (Aerospace equivalent) also have teams. These teams will probably use the Maker Studio a lot more now that it's available, but there's usually a lot of woodwork involved. It's a very informal design process (sketch it up, cut it out- not so much CAD)  3) Formula Society of Automotive Engineers (site, car video)  They build a formula car. A lot of those people spend a LOT of time on it, but it's a great way to gain experience in a more formal design process (they CAD everything, analyze the strength of their components...etc)  4) UT Solar Car Team (site)  They build a solar powered car. If you're an electrical engineer, this might be better suited for you than FSAE, though I'm sure they need electrical people too."
UTAustin,3cvplp,StateTransit,0,Sat Jul 11 17:19:23 2015 UTC,They're all pretty disappointing -- especially for beginners. There's not much in terms of structure to guide you. (At least in my experience) I would recommend going at it yourself and then having friends to play with you.

From experience, a lot of jobs on campus will allow you to do your homework during downtime, but I wouldn't say to count on it. I work at one of the libraries on campus, but my position has me walking all over the library while shelving, scanning, pulling books off the shelves, etc, so I have zero time to do anything for school except for the occasional task I get that requires me to use a computer. Even then  I'm usually expected to be done before too long anyway, so I wouldn't be able to get any real, significant work done. If you apply at a library, you might have some time to do your work if and only if you go specifically for the front desk/circulation position, but only if you don't mind people breaking your concentration every few minutes to check in/out or answer patron questions or one of the other tons of tasks you have to do in circulation.

There's no clear distinction of where outbound ends and inbound begins (""bounds"" in relation to UT).  You said you're at Wood Hollow and Greystone, right? I think that's probably stop #4. So a bus will pick you up, make one more stop at #5, and take you to campus. Coming back, you'll go through stops #1, #2, and #3, and then you'll be back home."

The route runs from campus, up Mopac, does its CCW loop up near the HEB in Far West, passes your stop, and returns to campus via Mopac again. So, no matter if coming or going, the bus should definitely stop there every ~15 mins for you to board or disembark.   Someone please chime in if I am mistaken."

UTAustin,3csutp,rant_about_love,6,Fri Jul 10 14:26:37 2015 UTC,"CH328M and CH320M are basically the same classes. When I took CH328M with Dr. Shabbir, it was, on paper, a separate class from CH320M, but in practice her CH320M and CH328M sections had the same lecture (cue confusion from the CH320M students when she put up the CH328M code on exam days). Ochem 1 mostly depends on your professor: each has a different style of teaching.  One thing most students who take Ochem can agree on, though, is this: take Iverson whenever you can (he is one of the textbook's authors).  On another note, Shabbir can be considered an ""Iverson 2.0"": she was his TA and has similar teaching styles and grading policies. However, she is said to be harder than the other professors (I can't really say much; I took both CH328M and CH320N with Shabbir and thus have no other professor to compare to)."
UTAustin,3csutp,Aetherium,3,Fri Jul 10 15:30:05 2015 UTC,"The only professors offered are Dong, KeatingueClay, Bocknack, and Shabbir.  Which do you recommend?"
UTAustin,3csutp,Aetherium,3,Fri Jul 10 15:39:42 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I haven't heard of the other professors: only Colapret and Shabbir were offered when I took it, and I've only taken Shabbir, so my bias is fairly obvious. However, I do recommend Dr. Shabbir. Her grading scheme can be a bit harsh; your grade is determined by two of three midterms (you can drop the lowest midterm) and the final. However, she gives out HW assignments that act as extra credit for the exams, and if you do poorly on an exam, the use of a T-curve will bring your grade up. Shabbir is very strict with her grading policy; you can't argue with her to bring your 89.9999 to a 90.0000 (yes, your grade is reported to the ten-thousandths place). What you get is what you get, barring grading mistakes.  Besides grading, she is a very nice person and her lectures can be fun to be in from time to time with her references to Sherlock Holmes, Star Trek, and various drugs. I highly recommend you go to her office hours when you can; they basically are another lecture focused on just doing problems and answering questions; it kept the material fresh in my head, and I attribute by A in her class to regularly attending them."

Hes a decent teacher, if a bit dry, and his class is very doable.  However his grade cutoffs are final. I had a 89.2 or something and had been a PLUS preceptor and he gave no slack.

She really pushes her students to work hard and offers many resources such as office hours and past homework/tests. Though I do have to admit you will definitely have to study. For example I would highly recommend going to the out of class test review sessions and her/TA office hours which are really just extended teaching times. Also shes gives out homework that add max 2 points on your next test. In addition she is incredibly nice!

UTAustin,3csutp,kellenmo,2,Mon Jul 13 22:44:54 2015 UTC,"Chem major here. Depending which teacher you take will actually make a difference. I took Dr. Sessler for CH 328. I then decided to take the next section of OCHEM with Colapret. Let me just say that these two are COMPLETELY different teaching styles and exams. Sessler had all fill in the blank exams,some writing sections, and mechanism questions (anywhere from 5-15 steps per mechanism, with about 2-3 per exam). Colapret had multiple choice exams with questions copied from old exams and the practice exam. In addition, the mechanism questions would only be 5-7 steps. Those are my experiences with taking the two options for OCHEM. Basically 328 is more in depth and requires a lot more work then 320 if you pick the right teacher.   I know some people that took Shaibr(?) and from what I heard about that class it would be pretty similar to CH328. Hope this helps, ask any questions you might have. Also, I took these courses two years ago so I hope most of this is correct."

So anyway, Brasky decides to enter me in the Breeders' Cup, right, under the name Turkish Delight. And I'm running in second place, and I'm running and I break my ankle! They’re about to shoot me. Then someone from the crowd yells out, God bless him, 'Don't shoot him, he's a human.'"

Essentially you need to meet certain requirements to apply to Business and they only accept applications during the Spring semester.

UTAustin,3cqsao,LoveForChrist,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:53:46 2015 UTC,"Gotcha. Definitely a doable option, just keep in mind that those classes need to be completed or at least in-progress when applying. If you don't finish them up by the date mentioned on the webpage, you'd be looking at applying during Spring 2017 as opposed to Spring 2016.  Keeping in touch with your advisor in UGS and the internal transfer advisor in McCombs will be pretty beneficial in terms of making sure you're meeting all deadlines as necessary. Best of luck with your internal transfer!"
UTAustin,3cqsao,LoveForChrist,0,Mon Jul 13 15:47:57 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. If you are trying to transfer, you are right to take easy classes.

No matter where you end up, if you stay with a Bachelor of Science plan you will need those.   2) Keep GPA up.

UTAustin,3cp2d5,glabius,9,Thu Jul 9 17:19:05 2015 UTC,"Well it depends. A lot of people take calculus for the easy A since they already understand it all.  Are you one of those people?  What about biology and chemistry? Did you take the AP courses for these but not get the 5 required? Or do you have no introduction to the material.  The Art History class won't be easy necessarily, you'll need to cram a bit before the tests, and you can probably skip 20-40% of the classes for more time for other things (but I won't guarantee a good grade, as they probably measure attendance to some extent)  UGS is generally always easy.  Also, you need to think about the locations and how far you're walking everywhere. Are you living on campus or are you living off campus?"
UTAustin,3cp2d5,LoveForChrist,2,Thu Jul 9 17:22:57 2015 UTC,"Preparation is everything. If you took some AP Calculus in high school, the material will come much more easily.  I know really smart kids from bad high schools that struggled immensely in Calculus.  With that said, if you are from a struggling background, you might consider replacing one of your elective classes with a general education supplement to whichever class you are most wary of. You can ask advisors about it, but it's generally an opportunity to get extra exposure to course material in a more relaxed setting.  If you took a shit ton of AP classes in high school math and science though, I think you'll be fine (you'll still need to study/keep up with the material though--it's not a cakewalk by any stretch)"

Intro bio and intro chem are both weed out classes that force you to do learn everything yourself and they tend to cause a lot of problems, even for bio/chem majors. In the semester when you want to be able to meet a lot of new people and have fun, you don't want to be taking this many hours IMO.

UTAustin,3cp2d5,AlexGL23,3,Thu Jul 9 17:25:26 2015 UTC,"Is it doable, totally. Should you, maybe not.   I just graduated and my only regret is taking 16-17 hours my first 3 semesters.

All in all, it depends on who you are and knowing how much you're willing and realistically are going to work, if necessary.

Now you can focus on killing your business classes. If you're scrambling to get 12 hours a semester, consider graduating a semester early or taking a minor / certificate program."
UTAustin,3cktia,JeremyPriest,8,Wed Jul 8 18:20:37 2015 UTC,"To piggyback on this-  What it means is that you'll have a lot less workload. You can choose to graduate early, or you could pad your schedule with a bunch of classes that you WANT to take, that interest you(take them pass fail if you don't feel confident, to save your GPA)  No employer gives a fuck how long it took to graduate, but you also may want to consider the extra cost of staying the whole 4 years."

UTAustin,3cktia,JeremyPriest,3,Wed Jul 8 21:30:03 2015 UTC,"Don't load your first 2 years with all upper division/business courses. Since you have the choice, go 50/50 and add elective courses that interest you. Use your free time to take advantage of the college experience! Towards the end of college, you'll most likely have a tight group of friends and everyone will be focusing on harder classes then, so you can load those semesters up with more challenging classes."
UTAustin,3cktia,FluffySandwhich,3,Wed Jul 8 18:46:34 2015 UTC,"Alright, one side-effect is that freshman year, you may find yourself in classes where you're the only - or one of few - freshman in the class. This doesn't apply to major-specific core classes, and more to electives and upper division classes. My advice is to mostly ignore the age difference and make friends anyway. Unlike HS, no one really cares about lower v. upperclassmen differences. Everyone is just a fellow student.  (I personally had 50+ hours coming in.)"

Always try to use restrooms on levels above the lecture halls, usually those restrooms are cleaner and more sanitary.  I think my favorite library to study in is the Natural Sciences library. The architecture of the library is amazing. The only downside is that there aren't too many outlets there.   I tried to stay away from studying at PCL because the architecture there was just too bland and boring.   Clarke Field is a really great place to play at night because of the lights.  Go to top floors of SAC or the Union if you want a more relaxed area to study because there are usually nice coaches there to sit/lay on.  If you like nice open areas to study that are outside, then you should look into studying on the second (or third? I forget) of the NHB. There is a really nice courtyard on the second floor."

Bull Creek, the Greenbelt, 360 Overlook, Mount Bonnell, Town Lake. There are just plenty of cool outdoor spots to find in Austin that I am missing now that I've moved to Dallas.

UTAustin,3ciipg,utexashopeful888,3,Wed Jul 8 04:24:30 2015 UTC,"If you have 30 credits by the time you're enrolled, that's all that matters. So you will indeed be applying for Fall 2016 enrollment in the Spring 2016 semester. Assuming you complete 30 or more credits by the end of Spring, your enrollment will go through for Fall 2016. If your application is accepted but you fail to obtain 30 credits, your admission will be revoked as far as I know. You will list the credits that are in progress, and admissions will treat these as if you are going to pass. They will require a transcript after your classes to verify.  I'm not involved in Greek life personally but I know some people who are. My knowledge of sororities is even less, but if my knowledge of fraternities can be transferred over to them, I'll fill you in. The top Greek organizations are expensive, and as such, depend on how much money you have. I've heard of scholarships or financial aid being given to some members, but I'm not sure how common that is. I believe it's more of a status thing, as well. Looks and social skills are also big factors. If you aren't aiming for a top sorority, there are plenty of other options. You can rush right before the fall semester you are admitted, and I've also heard of ACC students rushing UT Fraternities if they have plans of transferring. There are plenty of options, including co-ed spirit groups (very popular at UT) and academic/volunteer greek organizations.    Co-ops, from what I've experienced, are houses where you do a set amount of chores. They're a bit cheaper than other housing in West Campus, but you get what you pay for. A lot of people who live at the bigger co-ops, especially the ones that allow non-UT students, are known for their... eccentric personalities, to put it lightly.   Good luck!"
UTAustin,3ciipg,Lameborghini,2,Wed Jul 8 05:28:26 2015 UTC,"I would call the McCombs Advising office with your specific transfer credits question.  That's such a specific case, I don't think many UT redditors would know what to do in that situation.    And the sororities in Austin are pretty exclusive to only picking first years from my observations.  I rarely see people older than freshman status get selected for a sorority-- unless you are already a member of that sorority transferring into UT from a different greek-affiliated school.    The co-ops in Austin are great.  There are a lot of options and nice people.  Here's a website with info about Austin ones.   http://iccaustin.coop/index.shtml  As for me, I am not in greek life or co-op life.  Neither are necessary to having a fulfilling college experience at UT.  They are large though.  It can feel a bit overwhelming at times having so many people around you involvled in greek-life.   But I think the most important thing is to try a lot of things.  Not all organizations are the perfect fit so attending a tabling session (we have a bunch going on all summer for Freshman Orientation) or a club fair is important.  I am involved in the TV Station and improv on campus."
UTAustin,3ciipg,skcloud,2,Wed Jul 8 05:23:18 2015 UTC,"I didn't take part in Greek life either, so I'm probably not the best person to correct what someone else said. However, my understanding is that the fraternities and sororities are incentivized/required by UT to take sophomores as well."
UTAustin,3ciipg,_edd,3,Wed Jul 8 06:47:32 2015 UTC,"Sororities do have a certain fraction of their new member classes required to be Sophomores. Fraternities do not, fraternity rush at UT is basically a free-for-all."
UTAustin,3ciipg,asalin1819,2,Wed Jul 8 17:19:09 2015 UTC,"You have to be a UT student to rush Sororities (at least Pan-Hellenic), and there is only rush in the fall.  So if you go to ACC for fall 2015 and/or spring 2016, you'd have to wait until fall 2016 to rush.  Hope this helped!"
UTAustin,3ciipg,sks1024,1 point,Wed Jul 8 06:01:40 2015 UTC,"Greek-life ... Sophomores aren't as coveted as freshmen, but depending on the sorority, it won't matter. The top-tier sororities won't accept you(because they lose 2 semesters of dues by taking you over a freshmen). But if you're pretty and social, a high-mid tier sorority might.  Also, you're going to have to go through formal rush. Make a friend who is in a sorority to guide you through it. DONT EAT ANY FOOD offered to you during rush. It is used to weed out the ""fatties"" and the people hat will suffer ""freshmen 15""  Co-ops are sketch as fuck, don't do it  Do a spirit group instead if you don't want to do sorority.

UTAustin,3ckajs,axemonk667,3,Wed Jul 8 15:59:29 2015 UTC,"I think there is a few things I can help you with. I was in the same position than you.   Edit: I just want to add. That I  strongly disagree with the people saying that if you don't want to deal with getting into CS, you should get into adjacent degrees like math and get minors / certificates.  I think that is a mistake and I think the furthest you should derive from CS is CE or vice versa. Wanting to go to a school is no reason to not do something you want, or having to deal with, with something you don't want. Specially for the rest of your life. Yes math and CS are close to each other. CS was born from the Math department. But the furthest you need to go in math on a CS BS is linear algebra, and some statistics and both can be taken with a focus on CS applications. I mean on whats specifically required on the degree plan, and those aren't even upper division courses they are just one step above Calculus.   There are many more reasons for me to think that, but I don't want to make this wall of text any worse.  lets lay down some facts first about applying: 0. To address your question. Yes, and apparently its only getting harder. But I think there are other really awesome public schools in Texas like A&M and UTD that although not as popular will pretty land you a good job, and a awesome career.    UT has become such big staple in CS, EE and CE. That acceptance to any of those majors is probably at the same level. I applied to CE got rejected but got in CS, and I know people who were rejected to CS and were accepted to CE. The admission process on a ""holistic application"" can be bizarre. And considering it took them 3 months to tell me  I was accepted. I have a feeling it will start to change due to the volume of the applicant pool.  So; applying to UT is hard, you have a heavy burden of proof, and luck may factor in. I got in with a 3.77 but 4.0s got denied.  Accept that reality and the application will be less painful.  You should listen to what people say, but not really.  Mind you, that guy retracted some of the negativity on his post. I applied for CS for Spring this year, and got rejected and literally everybody from the CNS admissions office told me I would never get in because I had 100 hours at the time of applying, because I was too old, I already have an associates in an unrelated field, and because my gpa was a 3.6. My spring application wasn't just a failure but a very demoralizing one. Yet I here I am. So how much do YOU want it? Take seriously the tasks you are given while applying and do serious planning. Write kick ass essays that are nothing but passionate and sincere (I did). And make sure you take good teachers in math and physics for at least two semesters to get recommendation letters from people who do know you (I also did). I managed to get an actual google employee to write one for me which was awesome while I was in a community college. Talking about community college, don't go to the easiest one you can find. They are hit or miss in terms of quality and difficulty and UT knows that. Also a MAJOR factor that people don't take seriously is class transfer guides. Goddam follow it. If you really want to go to UT follow that plan exactly as denoted. As far as I am concerned, in the college confidential transfer thread, people who had their transfer classes done, with good grades and good letters of recommendation were the most successful ones transferring. You are missing one science course, your chances diminish significantly.  You need As, get them. I'm big on modding electronics and home stuff, and I showed it on my essays. Try to show what makes you, you on your essays.   Now I think we should lay down some academic facts:   EE and CS are incredibly different. The fact that they are in two different colleges should flag that. So career wise EE as an alternative to CS seems miserable if you don't love it. EE will have far more math and physics. And ultimately EE upper division electives (duh). While CS you get to build an operating system. That is how different they are. The middle point is CE. You need to apply for CE btw you can't just apply to EE.  CE is half and half. But its not any easier to get in anyway. It's just the alternative to those who want to do hardware instead of just software. Its an awesome degree. Yes UT CS is hot, yes it up there with all the click bait magazines and Forbes and shit. But non of those writers get even close to attend to those majors they write about. They use their metrics to judge and then the hype goes off.  What I am trying to say is: not other schools are bad because they are not ranked or they aren't as high. I was perfectly happy going to my B option school (A&M) or C option school (UTD).  This is just Undergrad man. You can start getting internships since your sophomore year at any school and those are incredibly valuable in the long term. Unless you want to do grad school, where you graduate from is not the most defining factor in the long run. So don't stress too much about it. I applied to Summer CE at A&M and since UT took so long to roll out my admission decision. I got to go there for 3 weeks and it was a fucking awesome school too.  And then you realize that most of your time at University you are not focused on where you are. You are focused on learning the stuff in front of you, and it depends on you how much of it do you absorb and apply. So if you get to go to your option B school, its alright.  I was actually incredibly close to staying at A&M."
UTAustin,3ckajs,vanillaseaweed,2,Thu Jul 9 11:45:30 2015 UTC,"CS is difficult to transfer into. If you are serious about it, you need to do the most you can to ensure a 4.0 or as close to it as possible. Take the most challenging science courses available to you at whatever institution you enroll at. Even if you change your mind about CS, if you set your standards high, you will have a lot of other opportunities available to you when you decide to transfer."

But I think I'm more the exception than the rule.  They pretty much cut acceptance rates in half and the average transfer GPA is now higher according to their statistics.  Only reason I can think I got in is from recommendation letters and my essays.  My advice is to aim for  4.0, especially from a community college.  Get to know all your math and programming professors so you can ask them for letters when you need them.  Start hobby projects on your own time that you can brag about in your essays and your resume.  And sell yourself not as you are, but as you can be!  Caution though: don't bother taking discrete math or computer organization/architecture.  They insist on you taking those on campus, but intro to programming and data structures are fair game.  Also, don't plan on graduating from UT in 2 years unless you're going for a BSA.  Plan on 5 to 6 semesters for a BS.  Source: Transfer orientation in June"

I was accepted into UT in the Theater department, but decided to double major. I was automatically accepted into CS, but after a few classes decided that UT's CS degree was absolutely not for me. There was so much low-level programming stuff that I was required to learn that I was not the least bit interested in learning.  I'm now a professional web developer, and although the first few programming classes have helped me (even though they were all taught in Java, and I have never touched Java since), I'm glad I didn't finish that degree (CS, still got my Theater degree), and am disappointed that I wasted a few semesters in classes that have never done anything for me.  All I'm saying is, make sure the CS degree offered at UT is really what you want. It doesn't (at least didn't during my time) offer as much flexibility in what I wanted to learn as I needed."

UTAustin,3cgcpo,MayStarchild,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:20:06 2015 UTC,"Got accepted as an out of state transfer into McCombs this year.  I'd say that transfering to UT is competitive but still a step below the very competitive public schools like UCLA or UCBerkeley even though it accepts relatively few out of state/international students.  You're going to need transcripts (high school and college), SAT/ACT scores (optional), two essays, and a resume which takes  <30 min.  Aside from that, just fill out your personal info on applytexas and pay the processing fee and you should be good.  If you have other questions, feel free to pm me."
UTAustin,3cgcpo,MisakaMikoto,1 point,Wed Jul 8 06:50:45 2015 UTC,"Be sure to aim for the highest grades possible in your courses: mostly A's and mabe a few B's, depending on what major you want to transfer into. The threshold you want to exceed is a 3.5. The higher the better. There are no guarantees.  As far as credits go, your transcript will be evaluated by hand to determine what credits transfer. Even though you are at a CC, there are still no guarantees all of your credits will transfer. I would recommend taking classes that could conceivably be in a core curriculum anywhere. It may be prudent to look at community college coursework in the state of Texas and search for courses at your home institution that closely match what we offer here in our state.  With this rule of thumb, it may be prudent to exceed the 30 hours minimum required to transfer just in case a class or two does not count."

UTAustin,3ce9p9,stevezeeweezee,3,Tue Jul 7 13:26:13 2015 UTC,"The most likely answer? No.  Could you graduate in 4 years going directly to UT? The most likely answer, no. If you look at the course load for each semester, they're basically squeezing a 5 year course into 4 years. Fail a course or have to drop a course and you're pretty much looking at 5 years. 5 years is fine though.   Here's the bigger issue though. It may not be so easy for you to transfer. The engineering school is extremely selective. Plan on getting A's in your core classes (physics 1 and 2, calculus 1 and 2, and possibly chem 1 and 2 if required) and trying to hit somewhere around a 3.5 or better overall GPA to have a decent chance."
UTAustin,3ce9p9,Picklebiscuits,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:34:58 2015 UTC,a 3.5 isn't going to cut it .. i recently transferred as a Fall 2015 into ECE and had above a 3.9  and for Aerospace i notice that the average was around 3.9+ ... Actually most people that got into any Engineering had around a 3.9 or higher. At minimum he should try to keep his GPA around a 3.85

UTAustin,3ccx87,danielrhymer,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:15:25 2015 UTC,"yeah but from my understanding midland transfers in the credit differently - for example, I apparently only need the last class but I only have 8 hours of spanish, or in terms of the class, I have spanish 1 and 2 done. If someone took 18 hours worth at midland that would be 6 classes..."
UTAustin,3ccx87,danielrhymer,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:22:00 2015 UTC,At UT you need 3 classes. But the thing is the classes are twice the amount of time / week as normal classes. So having 6 3 hour classes at midland does seem like what you would need if they transfer differently than other non-UT places. You probably want to talk to an advisor though
UTAustin,3ccx87,RandomJPG6,2,Mon Jul 6 23:26:24 2015 UTC,It's four three hour classes to meet the requirement.
UTAustin,3ccx87,RandomJPG6,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:21:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I see what your saying - but most community colleges don't offer 6 spanish classes.

I always ran with someone else though. I think as long as you stay on main roads that are lit you'll be fine. I ran along guad a lot, but not necessarily the drag part next to campus due to drag rat population. I also used to run along Lamar from west campus to downtown and back, about a 5 mile trek that's scenic and well lite (I generally took nueces street home because it is way less hilly)."

Light jog to Lamar to warm up, cross the street, and run along the west side up to one of the major streets and back. It's pretty well lit, there's enough traffic that you can easily flag someone down in an emergency, the sidewalk's well paved, and there's not a lot of people on it. There's one spot where you go under the cover of some trees that could be scary, but if it makes you uncomfortable just move to the grass for a few 100 feet."

You could try to use your sister's ID to get into the gym, but they do check ID's when you go in, so it's a crap shoot. IIRC if you get caught passing her ID they'll confiscate it and escort you off campus, which would seriously put a damper on your hanging out on campus.

UTAustin,3byo2t,BurrDurrMurrDurr,4,Fri Jul 3 14:17:10 2015 UTC,"I don't think he could just park it on the street. First off, I don't know that the city will let you just leave an 18' trailer with a 10' tall structure on it sitting out on a neighborhood street. Also, you'd need to run power and water from the house to it, so that'd be some extension cords and a hose that have to run from the house to the street."

UTAustin,3byo2t,Kieldro,6,Fri Jul 3 16:04:18 2015 UTC,"Cool idea and project. Not sure if it'll actually be a viable housing option though.  He'll need some kind of utility hookups/accommodations (power, water, waste water, garbage), which means he'll either need to rent space at an RV park or something, or see if someone is willing to let him park in their yard and share their home's utilities. If the idea is to save money, it'll almost certainly have to be the latter.  Power feeds are going to be very limited, as he'd likely just be running an extension cord to the trailer. That's fine for a small fridge and maybe some lights. But that might not be enough to add on some minimal HVAC capabilities.  Water is also going to be tricky. There doesn't look like there's space to store any, so it'll likely be relying on an external hose. And even then, that won't provide any hot water. And run-off water from the sink and shower have to go somewhere too.  Burning propane in a 145 square foot enclosed space could also be extremely dangerous. In addition to the fire risk, the bigger danger may be carbon monoxide poisoning."

UTAustin,3bymh5,unoriginalloser,21,Fri Jul 3 05:45:43 2015 UTC,"The people supporting this chick may have some decent arguments against affirmative action, or at least how affirmative action is handled, but having this chick as their representative kind of ruins it. Her grades and test scores are mediocre.   I had a 3.8 GPA, 2130 SAT score, and a decent amount of extra curriculars, but I wasn't in the top 7%, so I was pretty damn worried about my admission. About 3/4 of the students who are accepted are automatically admitted because of class rank, so if you're not in the top 7% and don't have something that makes you stand out, you'll probably get rejected.   Affirmative action wasn't the problem in this girl's situation. I honestly have no sympathy for her. I'm just kind of annoyed by her sense of entitlement."
UTAustin,3bymh5,thepro7864,26,Fri Jul 3 11:50:52 2015 UTC,"I hate this girl. She's so ignorant. She had a VERY average GPA and SAT. Aside from the automatic acceptances, the acceptance rate for 2008 was around 16%. Affirmative action has NOTHING to do with why she didn't get in. lmao Also, affirmative action is VERY important. It allows students of color from different areas and backgrounds to get a good education. This is important because In return, this benefits their communities which, in the long run, helps abolish poverty and in return, racism. Ms.Fischer is so privileged that she wants to blame not getting into her top choice university on a program intended to help minorities. She needs to step out of her bubble and grow up."
UTAustin,3bymh5,comedyprepster,24,Fri Jul 3 09:07:38 2015 UTC,"If you're going to have affirmative action it needs to be socioeconomic based, not race based.

UTAustin,3bymh5,Plumbous,5,Fri Jul 3 20:43:10 2015 UTC,"All from the Wikipedia article and the Supreme Court petition:   1180 (680 math, 500 verbal) out of 1600 on SAT (which she took twice - first attempt was 1170) -- 25th percentile for admitted UT students that year was 1120 5.1 on a 6.0 scale (converted to 3.59 on 4 point scale) high school GPA -- 12th percentile (ranked 82 out of 674) in her graduating class Extracurricular: orchestra (cellist), math competitions, soccer, bowling, Habitat for Humanity   So... SAT score on the lower end of the curve of admitted students that year. GPA that is a mid to high ""B"" (5.1/6 = 85% or 3.59/4 = 89.8%, for those of us who were on a 100 pt scale). A couple of extracurriculars, but nothing that any number of other high school students wouldn't also have. And outside the top 10%, so no automatic admission."
UTAustin,3bymh5,mrflarp,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:33:43 2015 UTC,"Right. And about 30,000 freshman applied in 2015, about 12,379 were accepted and 8,979 were automatically admitted because they were in the top 8 percent of their class. Taking out the automatic acceptances, that means that incoming freshmen were roughly 3,400 spots out of 21,021. THAT IS A 16% PERCENT ACCEPTANCE RATE if you are not in the top 8% of your high school class. …and they say they have a 40% acceptance rate. Which they do, but not really.    So, if she is applying to a school with a 16% acceptance rate out of the auto-accepts you better have a REALLY competitive application."

UTAustin,3bymh5,2319longhorn,4,Fri Jul 3 21:46:39 2015 UTC,"From that NY Times article:   Writing for the majority in that case, Justice Sandra Day O’Connor said she expected that “25 years from now,” the “use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary.”   It'd be great if we did evolve to the point where stuff like affirmative action is no longer needed. While I dislike the idea of using of race as a factor, I do see why it might still serve a purpose in today's society. If it helps push society toward no longer needing it, then it's worthwhile (for now)."
UTAustin,3bymh5,mrflarp,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:40:42 2015 UTC,"It would be fair to say however that students receiving affirmative action may not have the required basics that non-minority students may have to get through most of UT's high caliber courses, which may lead to them dropping out or receive consistently poor marks. I do agree that this girl's sat and gpa are nowhere near UT's standards and she just has a hard time dealing with rejection. Regardless of this girl's complaints, I believe it is a conversation that needs to be had."
UTAustin,3bymh5,ThugDaddy,10,Fri Jul 3 09:18:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I don't think the whole system should be abolished just because some affirmative action students might not be able to keep up. That's a poor argument. There are a lot of non affirmative action students who drop out too."
UTAustin,3bymh5,meattornad0,6,Fri Jul 3 10:05:36 2015 UTC,"So you're concerned about college readiness? That's a reasonable argument, but that's not what Fischer is arguing. Also, if this is the case then I suppose the dropouts make room for more transfer students. Look at it this way, if a student from a poor district has a 3.5 GPA, that probably means that they're a hard working student. UT courses may be harder, but if they had a decent GPA in a bad district then they're probably smart enough to seek out the resources set up to help struggling students on campus. I do think the guidelines for affirmative action are pretty unclear and DO NEED to be worked out, but I do think it needs to stay."

If money isn't a factor, UT would be a great place to explore and grow as an individual. Austin has a lot to offer as far as nightlife and culture whereas staying at home would sort of limit you as far as maturing and striving, independently. Also, I believe UT is also opening up a Medical School within the next few years so that could always be an option. But I do know of several people who are going through UT-Dallas' Pre-Med program ""UT-PACT"" and I believe it guarantees admission into Medical School (UT Southwestern). Some of my friends are currently pursuing Pre-Med- one of them goes to UT and on top of having a heavy workload, he has to worry about preparing for his MCAT among some other things Med-School looks at. In my opinion, I think it might be easier to join some sort of program that guarantees facilitated admission into Medical School. I believe UTSA has one called the ""FAME"" program and there are probably others in Texas. Take advantage of your current year as a senior and look into them if the medical field is something you really want to pursue."

I took campus tours of both universities before ultimately committing to UT. At first I really liked UTD, but upon taking my tour at UT I absolutely fell in love with the campus. UTD is a little more quaint and has a large population of commuter students. UT certainly has that community feel about it, and it's a lot busier compared to Dallas. I'm not you so I don't know how you prefer to live, but I was very interested in living on my own. It's not too much of a challenge and your social life takes off a lot easier than if you were living at home. Obviously you'll see some bias here because this is the UT subreddit, so I'd ask around on /r/UTDallas as well for opinions. Overall, UT is certainly worth the hype and I couldn't have seen myself anywhere else. I hope you'll end up the same way."

UTAustin,3bxoy9,NoobMadeInChina,1 point,Fri Jul 3 05:53:49 2015 UTC,"Implying that you're home is in the dallas area, I strongly suggest UT Austin.  Austin is a college town and everything is essentially built around the school, where as UTD is just part of a suburb.  Not only does that mean there are more things to do in Austin, but just the fact that you're away from home and probably a lot of your friends will push you to meet new people and exposed to new things.  Just the fact that you're in someplace new can make a whole world of difference.  If you can't live on your own, theres the dorms.  Or learning on your own is never a bad idea.  Plus, given the size of UT Austin compared to UTD, I bet you'll find many more people in your same situation.    Take for example me and my best friend.  We're both from the same suburb of DFW.  I'm at UT, my friend is at UTD on the medschool track.  I choose UT because I already spent enough time at UTD during my high school years with research, so I hands-down wanted a change of environment anyways.  My friend choose UTD because UTD is essentially paying him to attend UTD (scholarship) so he can save up for med school which is crazy expensive and so he can live at home.  I've known my friend since childhood and we still keep in touch really closely even we're 3 hours apart.  I have nothing against him, but I seriously wish for the sake of his own social well-being, he had gone somewhere else.  I noticed a lot of mentality carried over from our high school to UTD, maybe because a lot of people from our HS end up at UTD.  That said, the way he interacts with everyone is almost like how it was back in high school: same places, same hang-out stuff, same type of jokes, etc.  Sometimes I wondered if he really ""growed"" in the aspect of discovering himself and his own boundaries, aside from just gaining more friends.  And, like you, he can't live on his own either without some time getting used to it.  For me, I've pretty much cut everyone off from highschool except him.  Not that I didn't like them, but its more of a natural process...I met new people from varying backgrounds, some that align with my particular interests, and they just naturally replaced those I knew from highschool, even though theres a good amount of them here at UT too.  I went from living at home in HS, living in the dorms for freshmen year, and now living in my own apartment.  I've learned the importance of fitness/exercising, how to cook on my own, managing utilities/rent/insurance, etc.  I didn't learn all these at once, but I just took it one at a time.  At that rate, I don't think it really effected my studies at all.  And plus the other part is how to utilize available resources that are for free for UT students.  Being on your own in a new place really helps you discover yourself, better understand those around you, and learn life lessons.  If I went to UTD....then I probably would still be the same as I was in HS...but just taking more advanced classes."
UTAustin,3bxoy9,RandomJPG6,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:00:05 2015 UTC,"Let me start off by saying thanks for the incredibly long and helpful reply!  I completely understand what you say about the whole grow up thing mainly because looking back from my freshman year, my friends and I were basically 7th graders attending high highschool. Now, my friends have remained the same, while I feel like I have matured a lot. Same thing that you pointed out about the same hangout places is too true in my case lol, my friends still use stupid jokes you would typically hear a kid say of xbox live or want to go to places like the gas station to get sodas or other things I see as childish, hence why I don't really hang out with them anymore¯_(ツ)_/¯. With the information that you've provided, I will most likely consider UT now because I never really looked at the whole character thing, I was more focused in the classes in general, and I probably won't even stay in Texas for medical school, maybe Dell Medical School if i get in :).  One last question, for the sake of curiosity, what kind of resources does UT provide to its students? Thanks again!"

Besides that, if you choose to live in the dorm (at least for your first year, which I recommend), there will be your peers and RA.  The good thing is that chances are you and your floormates will be in the same boat; some being from out of state or international students...no one really cares if you don't know how to do laundry or whatnot on your first day...(in fact its probably a good way to make friends too)  As for what I know about UTD, you'll be kind of on your own at UTD.  The new on-campus dorms and etc aren't even directly managed by UTD...I believe they are being managed by a 3rd party company (Aramark?) under the facade of UTD.  UTD is originally a commuter school and it still is in many ways...I don't even know if a lot of the student services that UT offers exist for UTD.

I believe seats are 'assigned' as closest to the field by class (seniors, grad students, juniors, and so on). I think it is worth it - great seats close to the field and reasonable even if you only consider football games in the price.   I am a grad student and there was usually plenty of room and people sliding in and out. Everyone stands in the student section and no one seemingly pays much attention to the seat numbers assigned to each ticket. Our group was only about 12 people though, so other groups may be more territorial with their assigned seats.

I was bummed when I realized I'd be assigned to sit in a single seat by myself. I was hoping that I could buy tickets once school starts so I'd be able to gauge if anyone else in my program would be interested in going. Also, is it weird to go by yourself?

The only thing is that each entry way to the stands will have an attendant check tickets (at least on the lower level). However the sections in each level are all connected, so a fan in section 25 could enter the stands in their section and sit with friends in section 30 relatively easily (same thing goes with fans in the upper sections). However a student with an upper level ticket can't really get into the lower section.   I'm not sure what discounts students get for buying tickets if it is not through the Big Ticket so look out for that. And if Texas does happen to get off to a good start, expect the prices of tickets to climb and the seating availability to get much worse.  Regardless, you can still buy the big ticket without a group. Its expensive and frankly not for everyone, but to me it is well worth it."

UTAustin,3bpid6,kikenazz,3,Wed Jul 1 03:18:41 2015 UTC,"Also, get a road bike or hybrid bike. Slightly wider tires will help with the rough Austin roads and bumps on campus. With a slim tire road bike, you can't really take a curb if you need to."
UTAustin,3bpid6,kikenazz,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:20:08 2015 UTC,"Keep it from getting stolen: Mini U Lock + Locking Skewers & Seatpost.  No need for a full size U lock - hey just add weight and bulk.  I recommend Pitbull brand - just as good as Kryptonite but you don't pay quite as much for the brand name.  Locking skeweres keep your wheels and seatpost safe.  I've tried a few and my favorite are the cheap ($23) Sunlite Lock N Roll skewers.  I cannot recommend locking skewers and seatpost enough.  Been using them for years.  No idea why they aren't more commonly used.    Bike choice: road bike.  They're designed for speed on road which is what you want.  Even on a road bike, after 1.5 miles in Texas heat you can get sweaty biking to class. If you're on a hybrid or mountain bike you will have to expend significantly more energy to get to class (and be a lot sweatier)."
UTAustin,3bpid6,tjc4,1 point,Wed Jul 1 12:42:01 2015 UTC,Are you living near Duval and 45th?  Biking is a great option and Speedway/Duval are super convenient to get to. The biggest thing you can do is always use a U-lock through your frame (not just through a tire and especially when leaving your bike somewhere overnight). I find that while I'm commuting I can just hang the lock from my handlebars and it stays out of the way just fine.

UTAustin,3bpid6,LoveForChrist,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:46:42 2015 UTC,"Might be a bit more careful then. Make sure overnight you put your bike against something secure.  Truly safe would be a U-lock for your frame, a seat lock for your seat/seat post and a rope lock or second U-lock for your tires.  Definitely DEFINITELY always have a U-lock. You might just screw on other things extra tight or evaluate the value of your bike to determine what other security measures you want to take."

UTAustin,3bpid6,LoveForChrist,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:47:44 2015 UTC,I think UT said 70+% of bike thefts are U-locks... It's super easy to discreetly carry and use cable cutters.  People also steal seat posts and wheels off of locked bikes sometimes.
UTAustin,3bpid6,audiomuse1,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:26:49 2015 UTC,then what lock do i use lol ? i was thinking of using 2 U-Locks + cables and possibly use locking skewers also ... so one U-lock + cable would go from one the front to the back and the other the opposite way around
UTAustin,3bpid6,dbzfanjake,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:35:54 2015 UTC,"If it's not a particularly nice bike, I would say you'd be okay simply by tightening your wheels and seat extra tight with a wrench so no one bothers popping them off and removing them.  If you can store it indoors at night, that would reduce your chances but be a pain.  If it's a nice bike, then you can do more. The official recommendation is a U-lock from the frame to a solid object and rope locks through your tires.  I personally would use consider 2 U-locks (just leave one on the rack while you're out and about during the day) and make sure both wheels are secured and then look into a seat release. This is the most paranoid option.  I really don't want to tell you what you should do because there are likely a lot of factors involved. For me, I had a decently nice bike, always U-locked it and tightened the ""quick release levers"" on the seat and wheels and was in pretty good shape. You just never know though."

UTAustin,3bpid6,DolphinShades,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:58:18 2015 UTC,"U-lock +cable. Probably want a medium/small ulock cuz the big ones don't work well with road bike cuz the wheel cuts so close to the frame. Lock wheel and frame to bike rack, cable through the back tire. You'll be fine parking it wherever that way (well, not whever cuz a 2x4 can brake ulocks). also, depends on how high up your balcony. I've heard of people getting their bikes stolen off like the first or second floor balconies. If it's a nice bike, keep it in your room. The rain/ sun isn't good for the the bike. Rain rusts, sun will wear out your tires and disk brakes, but you probably don't have those. If you ever need bike-related help, check out the UT orange bike project. Those guys are dope"

UTAustin,3bs2mi,JeremyPriest,3,Wed Jul 1 18:58:31 2015 UTC,"As the others have said, McCord is really great. He's pretty chill, has interesting lectures (I found them interesting, at least), and doesn't make things a mystery. The new class layout with Sapling instead of Quest for the homework assignments made exams a lot better to prepare for - just go through the homework questions and you will be prepared for the exam. That doesn't mean the exams are easy, but that if you can do the homework, you will know what you need to for the exam. He's probably the most technically proficient teacher I've seen, though I'll love anyone who can use a computer relatively effectively Half of the content in CH301 and 302 is stuff you've gone through in AP Chem, so most of the initial stuff should be a review from that course. If you didn't get it in AP Chem, you will hopefully understand it in McCord's class. If you have any issues during the course course, you can always go to the TAs' sessions scheduled weekly. Finally, my favorite part is the fact that there's no textbook - it's all online on the Chem webpage. You can take a look at the material for CH301 here"
UTAustin,3bs2mi,Jemikwa,2,Wed Jul 1 23:13:48 2015 UTC,I had McCord for 301. The class is straight forward to being with but his lectures are also pretty good. I wouldn't worry too much
UTAustin,3bs2mi,burnin7rees,2,Wed Jul 1 21:47:17 2015 UTC,"You should be fine; CH301 isn't that much more than is covered in most AP Chem courses. Additionally, McCord is supposed to be pretty good (from what I've heard, I took another professor). My advise for this class (and all of your classes) is just not to blow it off. Even if you're not feeling like you're getting anything out of lecture, just going is going to help.  Additionally. your FIG should give you some people to study with, which should be helpful. If you struggle, there's always the Sanger Learning Center (UT's tutoring service), where you get 5 free tutoring sessions each semester and can use their Drop in Tutoring for free the whole year."
UTAustin,3bs2mi,ulamala,2,Wed Jul 1 22:11:39 2015 UTC,"Like others have said, McCord is fantastic. I had him for 301, and I always enjoyed his lectures. He gets straight to the point and does a great job at explaining everything in a way that's not overwhelming. I didn't take AP chem, but I still did very well in his class--so you probably have some advantage with things fresh on your mind.  Make sure you go to class and keep up with his online posts. He often posts extra point opportunities."

UTAustin,3bs2mi,derodotus,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:41:37 2015 UTC,"CH 305 is also chemistry and also counts as a Science and Technology Part I credit (unless you're CNS or maybe Engineering? I'm not sure about eng) and is specifically designed for non-CNS majors. It's reeeeeally easy if you take it with Sutcliffe. Personally, I think if your first choice is business, I'd drop CH 301 for now.

You'll have to take MATH 2413 for M408K and MATH 2414 for M408L.   M408K/L is mostly taught using Quest, an online multiple choice homework portal.

There is already a DO school here in FW through UNT that has been here for 50 years! and they could just accredit a medical school, but No.  Oh but if you are UT and a billionaire wants to build then then Hell yes.

UTAustin,3bkyvb,bug_bite,9,Tue Jun 30 13:44:38 2015 UTC,"In order to receive accreditation, the school has to apply for it. I've heard nothing of UNT's attempts at accrediting a medical school as MD, they already have a DO program. The DO and MD programs are accredited by two different organizations, and no medical school offers a DO and MD program simultaneously. I'm doubtful that UNT would scrap its DO program in favor of an MD program. Plus, they're focused on getting their Pharmacy program accredited, which is a much different progression."

There is so much within walking distance and you can ride the Austin city buses for free with your UT ID.  I highly recommend familiarizing yourself with the bus system.. it takes some getting used to (where the bus stops are, what routes you have to take to get some place, and making sure you get on a bus going in the right direction) however you'll learn fast.  Here is a good website for planning trips: https://www.capmetro.org/planner/  Parking on campus is a major inconvenience as you have to pay to park in a garage and often have to move it whenever there is a major event.

Was it worth it?  I thought so, but I drove home to San Antonio relatively often my first year.  I didn't use it very much outside of that (getting to my car took a while because of where it was, so it wasn't super convenient for short trips).  I would say it really depends on what you're planning on doing, though; if you want to explore Austin, it's a lot easier with a car than trying to depend on the buses for everything.  If you just want to go downtown occasionally, probably not so worth it."

There isn't a Walmart or anything like that within walking distance, and the bus ride takes a long time. Honestly, even if you don't use it too often, I consider the cost to be well worth it.

No, the front desk will have equipment.   could I just keep it stored in my room and take it to the kitchen to use   As far as I know, you're not allowed to have it at all."
UTAustin,3bfdx0,kazaanabanana,1 point,Sun Jun 28 19:31:16 2015 UTC,"Kazaanabanana mostly got everything, but I'll add a bit and clarify.  You'll need to check out the key to the kitchen at the front desk. The desk has some stuff you can check out there, but they also have some stuff that simply stays in the kitchen for you to use. Generally, from what I've seen with other desks, they keep a binder around that lists all the items they have available, so that's convenient. Item lists depend on the desk/dorm, since each one has its own unique set, but they have the basics and as long as you aren't doing anything complicated you should be fine.  As for the rice cooker and such, you can't have that stuff in your room AT ALL from what I understand, so you can't really keep it around to use in the community kitchen unfortunately.   Finally, basic rules are pretty simple: clean up after yourself, return the key and equipment when you're finished, please don't light anything on fire, etc. They always keep the rules posted on the kitchen door and the person at the desk will give you a run down if you ask."

UTAustin,3bcbuy,audiomuse1,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:11:36 2015 UTC,"There's a Costco and Sam's on 183 and Great Hills (northwest of campus). Those are probably the best places to get stuff in bulk. Frozen stuff can be cheaper because you can buy them in larger quantities, and they will keep for a long time.   Whole frozen chickens are pretty inexpensive (couple bucks for a 3 lb bird), are pretty versatile (roast it whole or separate it into individual cuts, and even use the bones afterwards to make soup stock). Frozen mixed vegetables are also pretty inexpensive and can be used in a number of different preparations too (stewed, stir-fried, steamed, etc.). Bagels can also be frozen and, properly wrapped, will last for quite a while. They can also be somewhat versatile (eat whole, use as sandwich bread, etc.). Rice is also very inexpensive. Pick up a 25 lb bag at an Asian grocery store, and it'll probably last you most of the year. Kept in a dark, cool space in an airtight container, it'll keep for a very long time. And it fits in with a number of different recipes and preparation methods as well. Dried beans are also good. They're also cheap and will keep for a long time. And they're about as versatile as rice."

I would definitely be proactive about it though; if you find a place that fits your budget, call them and see what is available. If you need some suggestions, PM me your budget."
UTAustin,3b7ual,dune297,2,Fri Jun 26 19:15:18 2015 UTC,"Smart housing opens for the big apartment complexes in West Campus anywhere between mid September to early October for the following year term. Places like: the Texan and Vintage, 21 Pearl, The Block all filled up within 1 week (21 Pearl filled up in 24 hours I was told). Complexes won't release the date this early so I would check back in August or talk to a friend who works in leasing at a place you're interested in. Most student complexes are shitty and expensive- that's the rub to a college town and being close to campus. Unless you can afford a luxury loft downtown (which is unlikely for anyone our age) don't be discouraged by the cookie cutter complexes you'll see. Pipes break, maintenance sucks, sometimes there are bugs (or bats, looking at you Callaway) and the small minority who had shit experiences bitch the loudest on google reviews. All in all you'll be fine wherever you end up - Riverside/West Campus/North Campus it's not a big deal. Just be wary of expensive one bedrooms close to campus, they'll run you 1000+ not including utilities. And I always recommend going into an individual lease so as to protect your ass against shitty roommates. Oh - and don't listen to people who say Riverside is a shit hole, I pay less than 500 dollars for my own bedroom, bathroom and upgraded unit with some friends 30 seconds from the lake. There are high rise condos that are in the 2k+ per apartment range right next to me. There is just as much crime in WC as there is in Riverside."

UTAustin,3b7ual,AKodakFailure,3,Sat Jun 27 02:50:19 2015 UTC,"I strongly recommend sticking with student-only housing in Riverside. The ones off the top of my head include: The Ballpark (and I think they just took on the building across the street too), Townlake, University Estates, and maybe University Village? If that's a thing. If commuting isn't a hard limit for you I highly recommend Riverside. Parking is the cheapest you'll find at any complex (free for uncovered, maybe 20 bucks a month for covered) and almost all units are upgraded with new flooring, furniture, and appliances. You can't beat the amount of space for the price. If you're like me and you qualify for S.M.A.R.T. housing because you're strictly middle class and don't want to drop 800+ on a shared bedroom, Riverside is the way to go."

The only reason we memorialized confederate army generals was because we had to mend the division in the country during the time. We let the south feel honorable in defeat. However, that's gone on too long. We can't let that feeling of ""honor"" rewrite history. These were human beings who had every opportunity to become abolitionists but didn't, and were trying to tear the country in half because of it. And yes, of course I'll make the inevitable comparison to the nazi regime—Germany is ashamed of that history. Why isn't the south ashamed of slave-ownership? Instead, we present the defenders of human ownership and suffering as folk heroes. Disgusting. Does that mean we need to vandalize the statue? Maybe not. But the sentiment behind it is important."
UTAustin,3aubdo,stoleyourwaifu,3,Tue Jun 23 19:50:54 2015 UTC,"We can't let that feeling of ""honor"" rewrite history   So we should let our shame about our past rewrite history instead? And Germany's past atrocities are on a whole different magnitude and context than what slavery was in the US. There are people living today that were victims of Nazism and Germany's other crimes. No one should feel guilty about what a minority population (because 75% of antebellum southerners didnt own slaves) did generations removed. Slavery's effects are still felt today, but the statue of a man who's statue was put up with no malintent should not be such a huge issue when there are problems we should be dealing with that would actually affect race issues in America and at UT."
UTAustin,3aubdo,emalen,3,Wed Jun 24 03:15:41 2015 UTC,"People killed in Holocaust: 11 million  People killed in Atlantic Slave Trade: 5 million  Are you seriously nitpicking over that difference? Slavery was horrific, and you being an apologist for it because 'it's not as bad as Germany' is sad and an example of how these issues ARE affecting peoples' attitudes toward race today."
UTAustin,3aubdo,stoleyourwaifu,-1,Wed Jun 24 13:03:45 2015 UTC,Slavery - 250 years. Holocaust - we can round up to a decade if you'd like  Slavery - supported by a small percentage of the USA Holocaust - started because the majority of Germany gave Hitler power  They're both tragedies but the differences are numerous. You want us to treat slavery like the the Germans do the holocaust? Where the holocaust is something that's basically never discussed? K man
UTAustin,3aubdo,t-shirt,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:59:27 2015 UTC,"Slavery - supported by a small percentage of the USA   Wait, are you saying actual slave owners were the only ones supporting slavery? Because you weren't free just because you got off the plantation. Hundreds of miles in any direction you're not free. The Confederacy went to war to defend it. Their ""nation"" as a  whole. Society as a whole allowed them that power just as Germany allowed Hitler his.  We should definitely discuss slavery and racial relations much more."
UTAustin,3aubdo,SordidCanary,-1,Wed Jun 24 19:35:15 2015 UTC,And how often do Jews discuss the Holocaust or write graffiti on signs because of it? It's clear that regardless of the nature of the disasters the two groups handled it very differently.
UTAustin,3aubdo,t-shirt,2,Wed Jun 24 17:54:47 2015 UTC,I'm sorry. Were Jews left with no choice but to integrate into a society where another cultural group terrorized them and stifled any meaningful progress towards equality for 150 years? When did Blacks get the vote?
UTAustin,3aubdo,SordidCanary,-1,Wed Jun 24 19:30:58 2015 UTC,"Jews were given a much more terrifying ultimatum: Work or Die, and millions of them did.  This isn't a question of civil rights. Jews dealt with intense hardship and their reaction was entirely different, why is that?"
UTAustin,3aubdo,YoureProbablyA14yo,3,Wed Jun 24 19:34:57 2015 UTC,"why is that?   If I had to guess, they weren't forced into economic, political, and social institutions that very deliberately prevented them from achieving anything."
UTAustin,3aubdo,t-shirt,2,Wed Jun 24 20:26:32 2015 UTC,"What /u/youreprobablya14yo said. Also, what were the options for slaves again?"
UTAustin,3aubdo,t-shirt,4,Wed Jun 24 20:57:05 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure a minority of Germans perpetuated the concentration camps. Jim crow happened after slavery. Blacks didn't get the vote until the 60s: desegregation was fought tooth and nail. This is not exactly ancient history. 1/3 of black males born today are projected to be incarcerated during their life. It's connected. It's causal.   Dudes who are icons for racists and ""simpler times""  should not be touted in any other context than that of cautionary tales."
UTAustin,3aubdo,stoleyourwaifu,0,Wed Jun 24 04:31:34 2015 UTC,"A minority of germans may have perpetuated the concentration camps but a man like Hitler doesn't come into power in the first place without large support. And I said that slavery's effects are still felt today. But what does removing a statue of Jefferson Davis accomplish? Statues are symbols. A lot of people seem to assume that the statue symbolizes oppression for everyone, but it can be interpreted as a symbol in a cautionary tale or a reminder of all that we have achieved so far. Why waste time, money, and effort on an issue that at the end of the day won't change any of the current race issues?"
UTAustin,3aubdo,t-shirt,1 point,Wed Jun 24 05:03:56 2015 UTC,And those slave owners didn't come into power without the support of the South (and nation as a whole).  There's a reason nazis were tried as war criminals and their statues don't adorn their universities.
UTAustin,3aubdo,stoleyourwaifu,-2,Wed Jun 24 16:02:07 2015 UTC,"Lol man. If you really want to think that slavery, which had become part of a lifestyle, can compare to the few years of inhumane nazi atrocities, then I doubt nothing I'll say will change your mind. And germany was beyond ashamed and genuinely sorry for what happened. Abraham Lincoln's initial goal wasn't even to abolish slavery. Once again, a huge difference. I'd give a limb to take my chances on a chattel farm rather than a concentration camp, but hey to you they're basically the same thing so yeah."
UTAustin,3aubdo,t-shirt,2,Wed Jun 24 19:12:05 2015 UTC,"If you really want to think that slavery, which had become part of a lifestyle, can compare to the few years of inhumane nazi atrocities, then I doubt nothing I'll say will change your mind.   Are you downplaying slavery because you consider it a lifestyle? What the fuck is wrong with you? ""Na owning people's cool man, everyone's doing it, well except for the people that are owned. We whip, rape, beat, hang, mutilate, brand, and dehumanize them in countless ways for generations! Yea, this slave here, my pappy owned his pappy. Life style man.""   And Germany was beyond ashamed and genuinely sorry for what happened.    And the U.S. has never shown shame or sorrow on any significant scale. No 40 acres. No mule. We should be ashamed, that's the point   I'd give a limb to take my chances on a chattel farm rather than a concentration camp   Well if you gave up your limb they'd probably kill you for being defective, so, yea.. It wasn't your limb to give up if you're a slave. Hope your owner wasn't extra masochistic to the point of making you an example."
UTAustin,3aubdo,stoleyourwaifu,-1,Wed Jun 24 19:24:29 2015 UTC,"Are you downplaying slavery because you consider it a lifestyle? What the fuck is wrong with you?    Do you even remember about what we're arguing over? We're arguing over the similarities and differences between the holocaust and slavery in the United States that caused them to be treated in different manners. Immediately after slavery was abolished, there were many people who did not see anything wrong with slavery just like I'm sure there are plenty of people who don't see anything wrong with it now. An amendment isn't going to change something you feel strongly about and that has been part of your culture and LIFESTYLE for generations. The Germans outlawed the Swatsika basically right after the the termination of WW2 and their war criminals were tried. Those are two different national outlooks towards an issue: one of complete regret and another in which half the nation gave absolutely no respect.   And the U.S. has never shown shame or sorrow on any significant scale   You can't shake someone's hand in gratitude with your right hand and then flick them off with your left. An apology doesn't mean anything unless its genuine. The fuck is an apology gonna do, its regretful that land wasn't distributed but what would 40 acres have done in the south where you were likely to be lynched if you were deemed too big for your britches? How many southerners do you think would want to give up their land? This post and the reason I'm even bothering to respond is because people fail to answer what the significance in removing a statue of an old man, which was put up with a good intent in the first place, accomplishes in lessening racial issues at UT and in the US???????? Jesus man, if you're gonna argue then do it with context.   Well if you gave up your limb they'd probably kill you for being defective,   If your $30,000 piece of equipment (because that's how slaves were treated and how much they were worth) broke would you throw it away? Hell, the only person that would spend that much money on you if you were defective to begin with would only be those that find a use for you. Plantation owners weren't successful because they were wasteful."

An [confederate war hero criminal]. Why do you think local and state governments around the country are taking confederate flags down? The same reason war heroes criminals should be taken down. Treasonous actors against the nation in the name of slavery do not need to pockmark a state university.  Imagine if a man who fought so that you, and anyone with your skin color (or a ""drop"" of your skin color), would still be considered property was then propped up and immortalized in a statue you walk by on your way to class every day. This isn't TIME's ""person of the year"" where we just put up people who had impact. The statues on campus are of people to be revered. They have entire landscaping designs carved around them. They're not honest reflections on sins of the past. They're quite literally something to be looked up to.    If your $30,000 piece of equipment (because that's how slaves were treated and how much they were worth) broke would you throw it away?   Yea. That was a joke at the absurdity of you creating a ""choose your own adventure"" between slavery and the holocaust."
UTAustin,3aubdo,stoleyourwaifu,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:22:44 2015 UTC,"Yes. And it's time to remedy the mistakes of the past by changing our outlook and ceasing to tout war criminals to appease racists.   Statues are symbols. SYMBOLS can be interpreted in a variety of ways. The statue was put up with good intent. Get over it. What it means to you it might not mean to everyone. You don't have to revere the American flag if you don't want to. You're saying that the statue's presence begets reverence and it's ridiculous to think that a school like UT, which helps minorities in a lot of different ways, would have some sort of racist agenda at the back of its mind.    40 acres in the south where you were likely to be lynched is better than no acres in the south where you're likely to get lynched anyway.    Lol.... you were a lot more likely to get lynched if you were trying to change the culture that had been place in for generations. Such as trying to own land as a black man.   Imagine if a man who fought so that you, and anyone with your skin color    Look man, have you ever experienced racism? Like being disliked for your skin color and being talked down upon? I have. Taking down a racist persons symbol won't make them any less racist. I'd fucking study (which I'm doing), become successful, and come back and spit on the statue if it really mattered that much to me. Success is the only way someone who viewed me as inferior would ever change their opinion towards me and my kind. Taking down a statue won't affect jack shit    That was a joke at the absurdity of you creating a ""choose your own adventure"" between slavery and the holocaust.   I wasn't choosing my own adventure. I was pointing out how vastly different the two were................................ because you seem to think that the two were identical...................."
UTAustin,3aubdo,frippere,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:54:08 2015 UTC,"I don't know what should be done with the statues. Supposedly the artists intention really wasn't to glorify the confederacy, and there's these phantom union generals that matter somehow. I'm just speaking in reference to the mythologizing of confederate generals that is ubiquitous around here."
UTAustin,3aubdo,Babel_Triumphant,0,Wed Jun 24 03:59:29 2015 UTC,"Germans can be ashamed of the holocaust without being ashamed of every last general in the war too. How is Robert E Lee different from Rommel? Lee opposed secession, and reluctantly led the southern armies because it was his home and he felt obligated to defend it. He did a damn good job doing it, too. If we have to be ashamed of every one of our ancestors who supported something bad, then we might as well not make statues at all."
UTAustin,3aubdo,frippere,2,Wed Jun 24 08:41:24 2015 UTC,"Historians debate whether Lee supported slavery. The problem is people here don't temper their admiration of this ""complicated"" individual with statements Lee made like:   The blacks are immeasurably better off here than in Africa, morally, socially & physically. The painful discipline they are undergoing, is necessary for their instruction as a race, & I hope will prepare & lead them to better things. How long their subjugation may be necessary is known & ordered by a wise Merciful Providence.    I don't think a personified symbol of those ideas is welcoming to black students, sorry if that means I'm some PC policeman. On Facebook lots of people say to put them in the museum, and I'd say that's a fair compromise."
UTAustin,3aubdo,Babel_Triumphant,1 point,Wed Jun 24 09:13:07 2015 UTC,"Abraham Lincoln didn't believe in racial equality either, and prior to the war didn't even believe in ending slavery where it already existed.   I am not, nor ever have been in favor of bringing about in any way the social and political equality of the white and black races. I am not nor ever have been in favor of making voters or jurors of Negroes, nor qualifying them to hold office, nor to intermarry with white people. And I will say in addition to this that there is a physical difference between the white and black races which I believe will ever forbid the two races living together on terms of social and political equality.   All of our historical figures held opinions which are no longer acceptable, because that was the norm for their period. It's absurd to hold them to modern standards. By your logic, we shouldn't have statues of any figure from more than a century ago."
UTAustin,3aubdo,frippere,2,Wed Jun 24 09:23:55 2015 UTC,"Ok yeah, perhaps my logic isn't the most sound. I suppose that's being ""presentist,"" maybe? Then I guess it's the context that matters."
UTAustin,3aubdo,hankhillforprez,5,Wed Jun 24 09:34:24 2015 UTC,What other statues were tagged?
UTAustin,3aubdo,RealityStricken,3,Tue Jun 23 18:16:31 2015 UTC,It looks like Robert E. Lee
UTAustin,3aubdo,stoleyourwaifu,24,Tue Jun 23 19:41:19 2015 UTC,Sad. Laws and rules matter too.
UTAustin,3aubdo,prettyslattern,-11,Tue Jun 23 16:29:17 2015 UTC,One thing you'll learn as you grow up in life.  Sometimes rules and laws are not absolute and not worth respecting.
UTAustin,3aubdo,TurboSalsa,0,Tue Jun 23 18:22:26 2015 UTC,"Maybe, but in this case vandalizing a statue is petty and pointless. Now we all have to look at it and someone has to clean it up.   Hopefully whoever did this is caught and expelled, I don't really give a shit by which cause they were motivated; if you decide to vandalize school property you're clearly not mature enough to attend."
UTAustin,3aubdo,FataOne,33,Tue Jun 23 18:57:41 2015 UTC,"Expelled?  Punished, sure.  Expulsion would be a huge overreaction, though.  You'd be forever changing someone's life because they committed an act of vandalism in protest.  You can argue that the vandalism was the wrong way to go about the protest, but it was effective and harmed no one."
UTAustin,3aubdo,kondor87,-7,Tue Jun 23 19:11:17 2015 UTC,"Protest (noun): a statement or action expressing disapproval of or objection to something  That's not a protest, that is vandalism. That's not how you fight racism, that's how you perpetuate sterotypes.  It harmed you, those are your tuition dollars being put to work cleaning up a mess. The message could have been expressed more constructively through a public display rather than through the damage of property."
UTAustin,3aubdo,Picklebiscuits,4,Tue Jun 23 23:45:57 2015 UTC,"It fit that definition. Graffiti of  a statute would express ""disapproval"" of the object by changing it's aesthetics (fucking up it's exterior) to better fit your personal view of it.  Next time you write a definition, make sure it doesn't fit the exact thing they did if you're arguing against it? Just because you don't agree with the way someone protests, and there are many ways (take a political science course), don't try to say that their actions are not valid viewpoints."
UTAustin,3aubdo,kondor87,-2,Wed Jun 24 00:57:44 2015 UTC,"I don't need a class to know that there is a line between criminal activities and protest. As I said I don't feel that the vandalism was constructive. I feel that a stronger message would be to start a campaign to get the statues taken down on the basis that they represent racism and slavery. I don't think it would be hard to find support around the community to do that.  I feel that the  perpetrator could have focused their efforts on long term change rather than short term shock that results in the loss of the univerities time, effort, and money."
UTAustin,3aubdo,FataOne,-1,Wed Jun 24 01:57:43 2015 UTC,"Alright, I'll concede that it's not protest.  I'll also concede that it wasn't harmless.  You're right, someone has to take the time to clean up the mess which costs that person's time and the school's money.  Overall, though, it seems absurd to expel someone because they committed a misguided act of vandalism.  The motive clearly wasn't malicious.  They let their emotions get the better of them and, instead of expressing their thoughts in a more productive manner, they vandalized a statue.    I'm not condoning what they did.  I just think the idea of expelling someone over this is ridiculous."
UTAustin,3aubdo,Picklebiscuits,4,Wed Jun 24 00:14:20 2015 UTC,"It is protest. It's the very definition of protest. That kid has no idea what they are talking about. Apply the definition. Rioting, vandalism, and even terrorism are valid forms of protesting, even if they are considered morally deficient (even downright evil).  Protest is anything that chows disapproval for the rule set or actions of an entity. Graffiti of a statue shows disapproval of a statue. That's protest."
UTAustin,3aubdo,FataOne,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:01:14 2015 UTC,"I conceded because it's not relevant to my argument.  Whether or not it's protest, it's certainly not grounds for expulsion."
UTAustin,3aubdo,kondor87,-2,Wed Jun 24 01:02:50 2015 UTC,Is it protest when it costs you money?
UTAustin,3aubdo,Picklebiscuits,2,Wed Jun 24 02:01:43 2015 UTC,"Of course. I can't honestly tell if you're being serious. Some of our most vaunted protests in American history are those that have been financially damaging.  Ever heard of the Boston Tee Party, lunch counter sit-ins in the rural South, or even a group of workers striking? All of those lead to financial losses for the company (or government) they were protesting."
UTAustin,3aubdo,kondor87,1 point,Wed Jun 24 12:53:33 2015 UTC,"So is the perpetrator protesting the university or racism? If he's protesting the university I may be convinced that his actions are warranted. However I think that the ""protest"" is about race relations in America. The University is an innocent bystander in this.   The Boston Tea Party was to protest taxation without representation by an oppressive government.  Lunch Counter Sit-ins were to protest white only businesses.  Vandalizing statues on the University of Texas campus? UT is a very diverse and accepting place. As an institution they embrace diversity, in fact they have an entire department dedicated to it.   For me this issue is black and white, the perpetrator should be prosecuted for their criminal activity."
UTAustin,3aubdo,toboggan_mantis_md,-1,Wed Jun 24 14:24:00 2015 UTC,Are you upset that you're losing your heritage?
UTAustin,3aubdo,kondor87,1 point,Wed Jun 24 13:37:08 2015 UTC,"No, I'm from the north. It's not my heritage, I have a problem with a person attacking the university for their cause."
UTAustin,3aubdo,Punchcard,4,Wed Jun 24 14:08:50 2015 UTC,No one has to take the time to clean it up if we rip it out by the roots and throw it in the sea where it belongs.
UTAustin,3aubdo,prettyslattern,17,Wed Jun 24 02:47:43 2015 UTC,"And as long as you start your adulthood viewing things that way, you'll be derisive later of people who are being disobedient for positive change.  Like people who tell the 99% protestors to ""get a job"" or complain about equal rights protestors blocking the streets where ""real people have to get to jobs"".  This act of disobedience meat something to someone and they took action.  It means something to a lot of people and I think they should leave the graffiti until they remove the statue."
UTAustin,3aubdo,TurboSalsa,0,Tue Jun 23 19:08:41 2015 UTC,If you want to commit disobedience go ahead but I wouldn't expect the people you've just inconvenienced to be especially supportive of your cause.

UTAustin,3aubdo,rednoise,-3,Tue Jun 23 19:22:55 2015 UTC,"Yet you are more concerned about the fact that someone -- gasp -- spray painted a statue, than you are actually concerned with the message that was put up and what it was addressing. Even if you agree with the message, you've obviously got priorities which, to you, are more important than the message; namely, the ""method"" as if it actually matters."
UTAustin,3aubdo,featherrocketship,0,Tue Jun 23 19:31:35 2015 UTC,"My goodness, imagine if the civil rights protesters of the 1960s had followed this advice. Sometimes you can inconvenience someone and they will understand why. Sometimes it is necessary to inconvenience people to get those people to notice you. Sometimes it is worth making a some people annoyed with you in order to make other people pay attention. Consider striking, for example, which relies on inconvenience as part of its efficacy, and in fact causes more than the minor annoyance of a small team of maintenance people having to pressure wash a statue facade."
UTAustin,3aubdo,rednoise,0,Wed Jun 24 01:12:04 2015 UTC,"Maybe, but in this case vandalizing a statue is petty and pointless.   It's a protest. And it obviously did its job in garnering attention."

UTAustin,3aubdo,featherrocketship,9,Tue Jun 23 19:03:51 2015 UTC,"Yes, but as someone who is generally saddened by vandalism and sympathizes with those whose job it is to repair it or clean it, I support this particular case of vandalism. This is an act that grabs attention, gives expression to the very reasonable anger felt by many concerning this subject, and, compared to many forms of protest, is a relatively victimless crime. You might feel that there is a better method for protesters to have made their point, but at least we can't deny that this grabbed people's attention in a way that other forms of protest often do not. It's getting people talking not just about the act itself, but about the motivation for it, and as a result, I don't think it's easy to assume its effects will be more negative than positive. All this is to say, I think methods like the one used here are sometimes worth it, and I think this may be one of the times when it is."
UTAustin,3aubdo,rednoise,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:48:13 2015 UTC,"What difference does it make to you that it was school property, when it's a statue commemorating a slave owner who fought for an ardently racist country?"
UTAustin,3aubdo,TurboSalsa,8,Tue Jun 23 19:08:24 2015 UTC,Do you support vandalism of all statues of historical figures who could reasonably be described as racist by 21st century standards?
UTAustin,3aubdo,Punchcard,6,Tue Jun 23 19:17:49 2015 UTC,"If that is their defining contribution to history? Yes.  MLK was a philanderer. Jesus flipped out and destroyed property because he saw moneychangers at the temple as  disrespecting his closely held religious beliefs.  Washington was a slave owner. Hitler was a simple foot soldier and victim of a gas attack in WWI.  Everything I mentioned are part of the historical context for those figures (forgiving the assumption of the definitive historicity of Jesus of Nazareth). But you evaluate the contribution, and weigh the good with the bad. I find it hard to argue that MLK's contribution toward proper treatment of all men is outweighed by his philandering, or that Adolf Hitler really got a raw deal in WWI and should be forgiven his role in subsequent world events.. I find it hard to argue that Jesus's message of universal love and redemption is outweighed by his disrespect of perfectly legal commerce at the temple.  Jeff Davis served willfully as president of a racist state who's constitution essentially mirrored that of the US Constitution, excepting extra bits added to emphasize how important slavery was, and afterwards was an insurance salesman. I would not be surprised to find that he loved puppies and thought his kids were great. It doesn't outweigh the fact that he willingly headed the Confederacy."
UTAustin,3aubdo,rednoise,5,Wed Jun 24 02:34:46 2015 UTC,"Yes. But that aside, the confederacy was pretty unique in its racism at that time. It was actually founded on the ideas of white supremacy. No other country existing then had actually codified it, until they did. But that aside, as well, there were people who recognized the brutality of the confederacy and the abhorrence of racism. I'd recommend you pick up a book called ""The Other South"" by Carl Degler, which explores southern abolitionists before, during and after the fall of the confederacy."
UTAustin,3aubdo,RealityStricken,-7,Tue Jun 23 19:20:05 2015 UTC,"The Confederacy was founded because of states rights - yes, it was the ""right"" to have slaves, but at the time it was because the federal government was trying to take that ""right"" away from the states. In their mind the federal government was overreaching and causing harm to their economies by wanting to end slavery. You have to remember at this time the federal government was much weaker than it is today, and the states had much more individual power. The states also believed that they had the right to succeed because of the way the federal government was acting.   People seem to easily gloss over the fact that Lincoln only freed the slaves in the rebelling south when he signed the Emancipation Proclamation - the northern states still allowed slavery during the Civil War. Lincoln himself wanted to send the all the black people back to Africa, and he held a meeting with black delegates about the issue trying to convince them to take part in his plan.  He believed blacks and whites were fundamentally different and could not live together without causing suffering to each other. So no, the south was not alone in its belief of white supremacy, it was a common belief at the time, even from educated men that are still held in high regard today like Lincoln."
UTAustin,3aubdo,rednoise,14,Tue Jun 23 19:38:59 2015 UTC,"The Confederacy was founded because of states rights - yes, it was the ""right"" to have slaves, but at the time it was because the federal government was trying to take that ""right"" away from the states.   Let me direct your attention to the Vice President of the Confederacy himself, to explain, in explicit terms, why the Confederacy was founded:   Our new Government is founded upon exactly the opposite ideas; its foundations are laid, its cornerstone rests, upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery, subordination to the superior race, is his natural and normal condition. This, our new government, is the first, in the history of the world, based upon this great physical, philosophical, and moral truth. This truth has been slow in the process of its development, like all other truths in the various departments of science. It has been so even amongst us. Many who hear me, perhaps, can recollect well, that this truth was not generally admitted, even within their day. The errors of the past generation still clung to many as late as twenty years ago. Those at the North, who still cling to these errors, with a zeal above knowledge, we justly denominate fanatics. All fanaticism springs from an aberration of the mind from a defect in reasoning. It is a species of insanity. One of the most striking characteristics of insanity, in many instances, is forming correct conclusions from fancied or erroneous premises; so with the anti-slavery fanatics. Their conclusions are right if their premises were. They assume that the negro is equal, and hence conclude that he is entitled to equal privileges and rights with the white man. If their premises were correct, their conclusions would be logical and just but their premise being wrong, their whole argument fails. I recollect once of having heard a gentleman from one of the northern States, of great power and ability, announce in the House of Representatives, with imposing effect, that we of the South would be compelled, ultimately, to yield upon this subject of slavery, that it was as impossible to war successfully against a principle in politics, as it was in physics or mechanics. That the principle would ultimately prevail. That we, in maintaining slavery as it exists with us, were warring against a principle, a principle founded in nature, the principle of the equality of men. The reply I made to him was, that upon his own grounds, we should, ultimately, succeed, and that he and his associates, in this crusade against our institutions, would ultimately fail. The truth announced, that it was as impossible to war successfully against a principle in politics as it was in physics and mechanics, I admitted; but told him that it was he, and those acting with him, who were warring against a principle. They were attempting to make things equal which the Creator had made unequal.   You can read the Cornerstone Speech in full here. Not one mention of ""state's rights.""   So no, the south was not alone in its belief of white supremacy, it was a common belief at the time, even from educated men that are still held in high regard today like Lincoln.   You're not reading what I'm saying. The Confederacy was the only country at that time who had actually codified white supremacy in their national laws and made a moral basis of it as a part of governeance, and used the institution of slavery as a basis of their social order. By the time of the civil war, countries were beginning to ban the institution and stop the slave trade altogether. The Confederacy was the last holdout for the institution and they made it a moral imperative for slavery to be a basis for their government, as laid out by Stephens."
UTAustin,3aubdo,RealityStricken,-6,Tue Jun 23 19:47:04 2015 UTC,"And laid out in the the Declaration of the Immediate Causes Which induce and Justify the Succession of South Carolina from the Federal Union it specifically states:  ""The ends for which the Constitution was framed are declared by itself to be ""to form a more perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity.""  These ends it endeavored to accomplish by a Federal Government, in which each State was recognized as an equal, and had separate control over its own institutions. The right of property in slaves was recognized by giving to free persons distinct political rights, by giving them the right to represent, and burthening them with direct taxes for three-fifths of their slaves; by authorizing the importation of slaves for twenty years; and by stipulating for the rendition of fugitives from labor.  We affirm that these ends for which this Government was instituted have been defeated, and the Government itself has been made destructive of them by the action of the non-slaveholding States. Those States have assume the right of deciding upon the propriety of our domestic institutions; and have denied the rights of property established in fifteen of the States and recognized by the Constitution; they have denounced as sinful the institution of slavery; they have permitted open establishment among them of societies, whose avowed object is to disturb the peace and to eloign the property of the citizens of other States. They have encouraged and assisted thousands of our slaves to leave their homes; and those who remain, have been incited by emissaries, books and pictures to servile insurrection.""  Being denied the ""rights of property"" was a cause of South Carolina's succession. It was also the first state to succeed the Union. You can read the rest of it here. I completely agree with you that it was about slavery no matter how the issue is cut, but southerners did believe they had the right to have slaves as property and that the North was interfering."

I have said this elsewhere in this thread, but it bears repeating here:   Sometimes you can inconvenience someone and they will understand why. Sometimes it is necessary to inconvenience people to get those people to notice you. Sometimes it is worth making a some people annoyed with you in order to make other people pay attention. Consider striking, for example, which relies on inconvenience as part of its efficacy, and in fact causes more than the minor annoyance of a small team of maintenance people having to pressure wash a statue facade."

UTAustin,3aubdo,featherrocketship,6,Wed Jun 24 01:25:14 2015 UTC,"I see what you're going for, but I think it would only be a suitable argument if we were talking about something other than a statue on the grounds of a public university. There is no getting around the fact that the statue's presence conveys a message about values, and that up until now, we have chosen to convey that Davis's, Lee's, and Johnston's acumen, effectiveness, and sacrifice as leaders is higher on our list of priorities than the incredibly damaging politics in which they were complicit and of which they cannot help but be representations. The men themselves may have been men, whom we may argue are not inherently evil, being a product of their time and their experiences, but we are not making a judgment about the men themselves, we are making a judgment about what a statue of these men suggests, and whether we want to support that suggestion. In my mind, it is far more important to recognize the resonance these men have with the history of racism in our country, and to be willing to say, ""these are not the appropriate symbols to be keeping on our campus."""
UTAustin,3aubdo,rednoise,2,Tue Jun 23 20:01:12 2015 UTC,"Not only do we not agree today, but there were a lot of people in the south who did not agree then, either -- including the slaves who were being held and for which the institution that kept them in bondage was being fought for by the Confederacy. For the abolitionists and dissenters in the south themselves, I'd recommend, as I did before to someone else, picking up a book called ""The Other South"" by Carl Degler.  Being a leader in the Confederacy is not deserving of respect anymore than Mussolini leading the Fascists is deserving of respect, or the fascist soldiers who sought a life that would see people murdered for their beliefs or because of who they were. I do not confer respect upon people who seek to preserve institutions of domination and oppression, whether they happened 150 years ago or if they happened today. That's not how respect works. It's not doled out on a social scale automatically because you did something that some people agree with. And if our social standards are that of ""Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness"" as laid out in our own declaration of secession, then it would be strange to try and confer respect onto those people -- even in history -- who violated all three of those precepts, time and again."

Off the top of my head, it seems like you don't have much time to eat lunch, you've packed some of your days fulll of classes(which can make you less likely to pay attention later on)  But, other than that it seems pretty solid. Bring a coffee in a thermos and snacks to eat during class!  Good luck with M408D and CH301, those are supposedly weed out classes. But i believe in you!

UTAustin,3atr6j,asinglegiraffe,2,Tue Jun 23 13:09:34 2015 UTC,"I decided to take French here and I didn't speak a word of French before the first day of class. I don't regret it even though at first, it was pretty daunting. But the material was easy enough to get through. If you already have experience then you should be fine for quite a while.   I would say that the French curriculum is pretty easy. All French classes have the same book, material, homeworks, everything.  Even if you have different professors it doesn't really matter. That being said, whether or not your class is ""fun"" or not will probably be up to the professor's personality.   But honestly, even though the homework is pretty easy, you have so much everyday that it becomes a problem sometimes especially if you have a paper due the next day or some project, etc. You never really get a break. So just be prepared for that.   Also, I want to point out that I did better than most students who claimed they've been taking French for 3-4 years. But you could tell that they didn't really take the time to do the homeworks each day. So the difficulty of the courses is really dependent on yourself (of course).

That being said, here is the most important part (at least, the most important part you care about):  French 601 is an ""accelerated"" course and some students only require that one class to reach intermediate level of mastery, whereas the Spanish program takes 2 classes (at least, I think, but definitely more than French).

So the second week of school is the easiest test covering the first chapter, then two weeks later you take the second test covering the second chapter and so on and so forth. This makes every test like 10% of your final grade, with the first two being 5% as you get used to the class.  Also, there is no non-accelerated course. I'm sure once you take the class most of the stuff will come back to you since you had three years of it in high school.  Oh! Another thing about the tests: you take a in-class written test that has an oral comprehension portion, a multiple choice section, a ""cultural"" section and a short essay section.   The oral comprehension will be your professor/instructor playing a video that has some ""real life"" situation where people use French. For example, the first chapter was about introducing yourself to people so the cringey (as fuck) video showed two people introducing themselves in French. Then the test would ask ""What is the man's name? Where is he from?"" and you fill in the blanks.  Multiple choice is self-explanatory.  In the book there are these side notes that say stuff about French culture and customs, for example ""faire la bisse"" (spellcheck) is a greeting that Frenchies do where the females will give a kiss on each cheek to whoever they are meeting if they are well-acquainted and even some guys do this to each other too. The first test asked to describe this and asked ""Should you hug a person you just meet in France?"" which the answer is no because it's just weird and awkward.  Last part is a written portion where you are asked a question and, using the information you've learned, you will write a short essay. This essay at the beginning of the semester is around 4-6 sentences and at the end they may ask you to make an essay of at least 8-10 sentences.  BUT the test isn't over because you'll have until midnight test day to submit a video of yourself talking in French online. It's always about what you've been learning and usually 30-60 seconds.  Finally, there is an oral exam towards the end of the semester where two French classes will combine and put you and another student from the other class together to sit down and just speak French. You can talk about whatever so long as it is in French. Your professor will be grading the other student's French and the other professor will be grading your French.  OKAY THAT'S IT. Sorry for the wall of text, but I felt like you and everybody else should know what they're getting themselves into. It sounds like a lot, and it is since you'll have homework everyday too but it's really not hard if you put the time into it. I got lazy because I thought it was easy and ended up with that B. Just like everything else in college, if you put the effort into it, you'll get the grade you want."

And, well, you can take a culture course instead of a foreign language, unless they changed up the degree plan from a few years ago.  My roommate was CS (just graduated) and never took a language course; instead he took two Greek culture courses. He wanted to take Italian but found out how much work it was (less than French) and chickened out :P  Culture courses are like history courses... I guess? I don't know. But people who don't want to take a foreign language take culture courses instead to satisfy their foreign language requirement. Look into that if you really don't want to take a language course.  If you have any more questions, feel free to PM me dawg."

UTAustin,3atr6j,bengr35,2,Mon Jun 29 03:26:17 2015 UTC,You might be able to test out of at least one level of French if you want to give it a go.  I would also suggest continuing with the same language and consider taking it online via Midland or Dallas Community Colleges.  It would be cheaper and much easier to go that route.
UTAustin,3atr6j,prettyslattern,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:28:39 2015 UTC,"Beginner's French will be fairly easy if you've taken French before. There's generally at least a little bit of homework every night, so it's not a blowoff, but it's not difficult stuff either."

The professors know this, and even if you butcher pronunciation it's still smooth sailing.  It's a simple language, you just need to remember the gender of nouns.

UTAustin,3artyt,RealityStricken,11,Tue Jun 23 06:26:41 2015 UTC,"Littlefield does not have his name all over UT for his role in the Confederacy. His name is all over UT because he was a regent and major philanthropist. His role in the Confederacy is only a part of his legacy, and not the one UT honors. Jeff Davis? His role in the Confederacy is the only reason there is a statue of him, and it a shitty reason."
UTAustin,3artyt,Punchcard,0,Tue Jun 23 14:51:45 2015 UTC,"If you'll look at my reply lower in the thread you'll actually see why his statue was put up. Littlefield was actually the one who requested that the statue be made, along with five others. They were supposed to be put together to show the nation coming together during WWI. The statue of Davis is ALSO a part of Littlefield's legacy."
UTAustin,3artyt,RealityStricken,2,Tue Jun 23 17:04:12 2015 UTC,"And if that was the way the memorial was put together, I don't think it would be problematic. There are ways of doing solemn memorials: Lincoln Memorial, Vietnam memorial, possibly this one if it had been completed. I don't disagree with that intent.  Instead, the original intent was abandoned, but the decision was made to say ""fuck it, it would still be pretty cool to have a statue of Jeff Davis around campus.""  THAT is why the statue is a problem."
UTAustin,3artyt,Punchcard,2,Tue Jun 23 17:17:27 2015 UTC,"Then people should be asking to have the statues moved together like it was originally intended, not to take the Davis one down, but no one is doing that because no one is taking the time to look at the history of why it's here, they're just getting offended.   Also, no one said ""fuck it, it'll be cool"" they were trying to follow Littlefield's intent by still putting the statues he commissioned up. The only reason people are upset is because Davis was the President of the Confederacy, I mean, you're not hearing anyone passing resolutions to have the Robert E. Lee statue taken down, and he arguably had much more to do with the Confederacy actually staying around during the duration of the Civil War than Davis ever did."
UTAustin,3artyt,RealityStricken,2,Tue Jun 23 17:26:51 2015 UTC,"Statues and memorials are about communication. The Lincoln memorial could have him standing victorious amongst vanquished enemies. It doesn't because that is not the sentiment we as a nation decided to convey. That was not the lesson to take from the civil war and Lincoln's role in it.   If Littlefield's tableau had been completed, it might have conveyed a message about getting over the rebellion and rejoining the rest of the country to move forward. At this point in history, I don't think states in the south need to be pushed to remember that they are an important part of the union and to pitch in with World Wars or other events of national significance. These are the states that have gladly taken up the  ""Real America"" moniker after all. The time has past, the original message no longer needs to be conveyed. I don't think that paying more money to get the full set of statues and complete the tableau makes any sense. And currently, an isolated statue for Davis or Lee or Willson or King communicates ""hey, these are the kinds of people think are worthy of making statues of"". And that is something that can change. At one point in history a lot of people thought it would be  a great idea to put up statues of Stalin of Saddam all over certain parts of the world. Those ideas change, and the statues can come down. Should those have stayed up? Because, you know, heritage?  Why isn't there a push for the Robert E. Lee statue to come down? I would not be sad to see it go. But relatively apolitical soldiers get cut a lot of slack by their opponents, as the quality of the military enemy can be seen to ennoble the sacrifices of the victor. Consider the way Rommel is treated by history compared to Goering. The Lee statue sends a less egregious  message about the people we enshrine in statuary. The Wilson statue is almost entirely neutral (he sure was a US president alright)."
UTAustin,3artyt,Punchcard,0,Tue Jun 23 19:44:56 2015 UTC,"People just wanna argue ""Davis was racist I feel oppressed"" without any context and any forethought to the implications of removing the statue. Removing this statue accomplishes nothing. Racists are still gonna be racist."
UTAustin,3artyt,stoleyourwaifu,13,Tue Jun 23 18:50:45 2015 UTC,"I don't see the big deal. The main people I see that oppose this statue seem like they've only ever read about racism and never experienced it. I mean, you don't have to have been discriminated against to be capable of distinguishing and disapproving of racism, but anyone who knows how discrimination works should understand that discrimination is only fought through success. What UT does to provide means of success for a diverse group of people should speak more loudly than some dumb statue that an average person doesn't even know exists anyways."

UTAustin,3artyt,stoleyourwaifu,4,Tue Jun 23 08:54:09 2015 UTC,This is an institution of higher learning and we should be capable of distinguishing between past and present.

If there had been a more competent man at the helm of the confederacy things might've turned out differently. So there you go - his incompotency is part of his legacy. What's so offensive about history? What do you find offensive, exactly? And please don't point out how the fact that I'm trying to answer your question makes me some sort of confederate supporter."

UTAustin,3artyt,stoleyourwaifu,-2,Tue Jun 23 17:11:33 2015 UTC,"I mean, we're kind of past the point of whether he deserves that statue or not since it already exists. And like we've both said and agreed upon - Davis was incompetent. So now we have a statue that basically mocks Davis and the confederacy. It's a symbol and it can be interpreted a million different ways and it makes no sense that it should be taken down because some associate a more negative connotation with it than others.

UTAustin,3artyt,emalen,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:42:12 2015 UTC,"we shouldn't learn history with a bias   The irony in that statement is off the charts. History is taught RIGHT NOW with a bias toward white, Western men and imperialist cultures. Having a statue of Jefferson Davis is a bias toward a Confederate perspective.   Status are symbolic   EXACTLY! I'm starting to wondering if you're trolling because your arguments make no sense. This statue is symbolic of a racist, oppressive society in which black people were treated like sub-humans. That is a symbolism we should not project or celebrate. There is a difference between learning and celebrating.   you shouldn't force your opinion onto others   Again, how do you not see that this is exactly what having a statue of an oppressive regime does? You must be trolling me."
UTAustin,3artyt,stoleyourwaifu,-1,Tue Jun 23 16:54:49 2015 UTC,"My friend, the only thing that is trolling here are your reading comprehension skills. The issue here is that you're not understanding that what the statue means to you is not necessarily what it means to other. Just because you view it as a symbol of oppression does not, I repeat - DOES NOT -, mean others view it as that.      History is taught RIGHT NOW with a bias toward white   At UT? Have you ever taken a history class at UT? I have, and it was probably one of the most unbiased classes I have ever taken. Yes, history might be taught with a bias some places. BUT, at the University of Texas at Austin, an institution for higher learning, the goal shouldn't be to remove a statue because it's an unsightly part of our history. How does a stupid statue made during an oppressive period show bias towards the confederacy lmao? Symbols can be interpreted in many ways. If a statue of Jefferson Davis personally offends you, well."
UTAustin,3artyt,hankhillforprez,5,Tue Jun 23 18:19:40 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure how I feel about the statue, but it is odd that it has such prominent placement.  For one, I've never perceived a strong southern or Confederate heritage identity in Texas.  We've always been much more proud of The Republic of Texas and  our own history rather than a misguided misadventure with the Confederacy.  That's for folks in the SEC.  I've actually always felt that the three statues at the top of that quad are sort of an odd trio: George Washington, Jefferson Davis, and Woodrow Wilson.  Seems pretty random.  I feel like Sam Houston or someone similar would make a lot more sense...  And I have no idea why Woodrow Wilson is up there too.  Nothing against the man, I suppose I don't know much about him.  But why is he standing next to the father of our nation and the first president of what (sadly) could have been our next nation?"
UTAustin,3artyt,RealityStricken,9,Tue Jun 23 06:35:26 2015 UTC,"Six statues were originally crated to be put together around WWI to show that the country was finally coming together after the Civil War to fight in WWI, the Davis and Wilson statues were part of this. Someone died in the middle of the project and they ended up not being placed together. There's references to this in many of the articles talking about the Davis statue if you'd like to read more about it since I don't remember all the details like all the statues involved or the exact reason it wasn't finished. The statues were Littlefield's idea/creation, and he commissioned them to be built."
UTAustin,3artyt,anonymisery,2,Tue Jun 23 06:49:12 2015 UTC,Well Texas had much stronger sentiments towards the South when the statues were erected. If I'm not mistaken the reason there isn't a North mall (just garbage dumpsters) is because of anti-North feelings following the civil war.

Now now, I won't deny any of the evil history of the Confederacy and slavery or their rebellion against the United States, both of which are horrid and inexcusable, but we should not remove it just because it's a bad portion of our history. I'd be open to moving the statue elsewhere, but removing outright from campus is just taking a blue pill to our history.  Our history isn't just a field of daisies and I feel our memorials and landmarks should reflect that. The Davis statue should remind us not of the ideology of the South or Davis' sentiments, but should remind us that, for a time, Texas did participate in that event, something that will remain on Texas' identity forever and that the nation that Davis led, was ultimately doomed to fail, like any other future rebellion against the United States would likely be. So no, I don't think it should be removed since it is a reminder of both the history of Texas and such an act would likely be a catalyst for other removals of ""offensive"" statues. Just because you erase the history books and take the monuments, does not mean that it didn't happen."

I totally agree with the fact that it's a way to remind the students of the history of Texas. If we were to remove these statues, it's almost like we are hiding or suppressing a part of our history, which in my opinion is never beneficial. Learning from the mistakes of the leaders of our country's past is extremely crucial!   Also, I feel like with social media reaching so many people in the recent decades, things tend to get blown out of proportion.

UTAustin,3aum6l,145638,3,Tue Jun 23 17:14:52 2015 UTC,Try not to plan more than two classes back to back. It will be harder to focus in the latter classes if they are all stacked together. Also give yourself sometime for lunch. Even though it may look appealing to get all your classes over with and go home it's also hard to focus if you can't eat. Lunch is also a great time to schedule time to talk to friends. Know whether you function better in the morning or afternoon. If you don't function well in the morning avoid morning classes. And long breaks between classes are only good if you are extremely motivated and will study. You will say I want to study but then end up spending all of your time doing something else. I would say no more than 1 hour for a break between classes. Also note that it might be hard as a freshman to make a perfect schedule and have all of these suggestions work. The most important thing is good professors and interesting classes.
UTAustin,3aum6l,TheVinylCountdownRK,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:17:47 2015 UTC,"Eh, this is a personal decision. I prefer having all my classes stacked up and getting rid of them early in the day. 10am is the sweet spot for me as it's not too early but not too late either. As you said if I have a class that starts at 2 I won't get up at 9 to study. I'll just be using that extra time doing nothing."
UTAustin,3aum6l,RandomJPG6,1 point,Sat Jun 27 16:29:55 2015 UTC,"Be honest with yourself.  Don't take classes before your normal ""getting started"" time.  Take your classes back to back if at all possible, breaks are only good if they are less than 2 hours long.  Classes are ended 10-15 minutes before the listed end time, so there's always time to get to your next class.  Stacking your classes with 2 on MWF and 2 on T/Thurs is ideal.  It sucks to have to come to campus for just one class and you'll skip that class a lot if you don't have another reason to come. Try to take classes that are relevant to each other and don't be afraid to take some core classes at ACC, they're cheaper and easier to pass.  Mix hard classes and easy classes, take a class in your worst subject, your two best subjects, and an elective.  And use MyEdu and RateMyProfessor, they work and are essential!"

UTAustin,3appm9,CF5300,6,Mon Jun 22 15:03:04 2015 UTC,"Agreed! If that's too intimidating, go check out the game rooms and lounges at your dorm or ask someone if they want to join you for lunch. Also, the OA's have plenty of events planned--even if they sound lame, check it out! They can be fun, you'll meet people, and it's better than being bored. :-)"

I actually switched to a BSA degree so my credits i got abroad count for stuff, but the topics weren't anything I was really interested in. I did it because I have a German minor and want to maybe move to Germany later on in my life. I got credit for all of my classes, but the grades aren't factored into my GPA. I'm taking 2 CS classes in summer school though. It might be hard for you/ most people because it;s a semester without any CS classes"

UTAustin,3aojo1,Toastyful112,2,Fri Jun 26 14:44:17 2015 UTC,"Hey, I got into McCombs this year from UT Arlington. I didn't take CAP. What I did was just take my core classes and maintain a GPA of 4.0. I didn't do extracurriculars, but I did finish all my indicator classes. I had some AP and dual classes so by the time I finished my first year of college, I accumulated a total of 66 hours."
UTAustin,3aojo1,llamasrule1214,1 point,Tue Jun 23 00:51:40 2015 UTC,"Congrats! You deserve it after all that lol I only have a few ours that'll transfer from high school but I plan to do whatever it takes to get a 4.0. I know they don't really care about extracurricular activities too much but I plan to do those too and have something on my resume pertinent to Finance, etc. Thanks!"
UTAustin,3aojo1,llamasrule1214,2,Fri Jun 26 14:41:15 2015 UTC,"UTD transfer here, just finished my freshman year, got accepeted into McCombs around in April. I had a 4.0 , and the required 30 credits through AP. It may have helped I was pretty high ranked in high school was accepted already, but declined admissions last year. Just make sure you have your indicator courses, and keep your gpa up, gps for transfer is everything."
UTAustin,3an2za,pikabuddy,3,Sun Jun 21 21:05:27 2015 UTC,"Recent marketing grad here. The program is great, there is a lot of job stability, and you can make decent money. I'm going to be honest and say that ""familiar"" will not help you CLEP and that is one HELL of a course load. Micro and macro are awful, as are both calcs. Taking them at the same time is gonna hurt, especially as you'll need to get really involved in a leadership role and keep that GPA up to have a chance at getting into McCombs. From the sound of your post, I think you'll be a lot happier going the communications and certificate route. You'll still get a stable job as long as you prove you have leadership skills - I recommend finding a leadership position in a communications org (look up Campus Events and Entertainment in the University Unions! Lots of Comm people there) and also consider minoring in English. Gets you an even stronger skill set and resume, and helps you with your passion! Business school is highly analytic, even in marketing. I think you'll like Comm better and can excel there."
UTAustin,3an2za,PurpleHooloovoo,1 point,Sun Jun 21 22:40:53 2015 UTC,"This was a very insightful response! Thank you; you've provided me with a lot of food for thought. So, you've got me leaning towards Communications now, but before I dive into that, I thought I'd lay out a few alternatives I've thought up for the Business path. Could you tell me how viable and realistically possible (meaning, pass the classes with As to keep GPA up) they might be?   Option 1: Take Microeconomics at a community college in the second summer term. Enroll in Calc 1 and Macroeconomics for Fall 2015, Calc II  in Spring 2016. (As a side note here, I took a Business Applications Calculus freshmen year and passed with an A, but I know some things were left out that are found in normal Cal, such as trig)  Option 2: Take Microeconomics, study for and CLEP out of Calculus I this summer. Enroll in Macroeconomics in Fall 2015, Calc II in Spring 2016. I feel like I can pass the CLEP (I only need a 50 to receive credit) but I'm worried that I might be underprepared for Calc II -- what do you think about that?   Option 3 (worst): Calc I/Microeconomics, Calc II/Macroeconomics in Fall 2015/Spring 2016, respectively.   One other thing I'm worried about is how McCombs will view transfer credits. I've heard from my advisor that the more courses you take from UT in residence, the better, as it shows McCombs you are prepared for the ""rigor"" later on. Do you believe this to be true?   A few more questions, if you don't mind-- (I'm sorry, I just want to be sure I know all that I can before making this decision).   From your own observations, what kind of person do you need to be to succeed at McCombs? Is it in the same boat as some other majors where it's ""you better have a burning passion for this or you're likely gonna drop out""? What's the workload like?  You mentioned I need to be ""really involved"" in a leadership role. Can you elaborate on what this means? How it would fit into a 15 hour schedule?  In the end, I think going Business means more stress and more work. Would you say that the benefits/connections/networking/experiences that come from a Business degree, as compared to those gained from a Communications w/ Business cert degree, makes the extra effort worth it in the end? If gaining a Business degree, in the big picture, is only ""somewhat"" better than Communications in the end, I'm wondering if it's worth sacrificing all the time and energy required to power through and get in to McCombs.   Thanks again for your help!"
UTAustin,3an2za,PurpleHooloovoo,2,Mon Jun 22 00:07:47 2015 UTC,"Option 1: Take Microeconomics at a community college in the second summer term.

(As a side note here, I took a Business Applications Calculus freshmen year and passed with an A, but I know some things were left out that are found in normal Cal, such as trig)   So...business calc isn't gonna help you much here. I took 2 years of AP Calculus in high school and did well on the tests, still had to take Calc II here...and it was the most I've ever studied for any class in college. Not fun. You're gonna have a really, really hard time (assuming from your post that you're not a math-y type with writing thing. That's an assumption on my part, but I could be wrong.) I AP'd out of Macro and took Micro at UT...again, both are tough classes if you don't have a strong background. Econs and Calcs are weed-out classes. Weekly homeworks, study-heavy tests, formula memorization, etc etc. Not fun.   Option 2: Take Microeconomics, study for and CLEP out of Calculus I this summer. Enroll in Macroeconomics in Fall 2015, Calc II in Spring 2016. I feel like I can pass the CLEP (I only need a 50 to receive credit) but I'm worried that I might be underprepared for Calc II -- what do you think about that?   You will be unprepared CLEPing out and not having a strong background. You'll also be behind in business Stats when you take it, depending on your prof and your natural math skills. Sorry :(   Option 3 (worst): Calc I/Microeconomics, Calc II/Macroeconomics in Fall 2015/Spring 2016, respectively.   For the health of your mind, your GPA, and your social life, please do not do this to yourself. Like I said, McCombs looks a LOT for leadership on campus when you apply to get in. That is a time commitment and to get a good GPA, you likely won't have the time for this courseload. Also...if you're a creative type and don't find numbers fun, this will be incredibly awful.   One other thing I'm worried about is how McCombs will view transfer credits. I've heard from my advisor that the more courses you take from UT in residence, the better, as it shows McCombs you are prepared for the ""rigor"" later on. Do you believe this to be true?   Yes. It is. McCombs transfers are HIGHLY competitive - you gotta have the GPA, the rigor, and the leadership to stand a chance.    From your own observations, what kind of person do you need to be to succeed at McCombs? Is it in the same boat as some other majors where it's ""you better have a burning passion for this or you're likely gonna drop out""? What's the workload like?   Depends on the program. Finance, MIS, Accounting (especially Accounting) all are best if you have a burning passion. Marketing is the best for the more flexible - depending on your electives, you can make Marketing all about psychology and consumer behavior, data management and trends, branding and advertising, or whatever mix best suits you. I was an Advertising minor in the Comm school and took a lot of branding and consumer behavior classes and totally loved it all. I loved my data classes too, since I loved finding all the trends and patterns and using those to inform business decisions. I love the problem-solving nature and creative side of marketing, but you definitely need to appreciate business and business problems. We do a lot of cases with Walmart, tech companies, resource companies, B2B industries - it's not all fun, so an interest in the problem solving side is really important.   The workload in Marketing is generally project-based. Most classes have a team project where you study a company and do analysis and present at the end of the semester. Most also have tests based on core concepts and theories you'll learn. Not a load like engineering or biochem, but definitely not a communications or education major (communications has a rep for possibly the easiest workload so...bear that in mind).   You mentioned I need to be ""really involved"" in a leadership role. Can you elaborate on what this means? How it would fit into a 15 hour schedule?   Yep. Join a student org and get leadership in that org. Do something big, lead a team, and prove you're going to be a good leader in the business world. Teamwork and leadership are MAJOR in being a success in business - you're ultimately trying to land a job where you're on a team, and quickly be a leader in the company. McCombs wants to create leaders, and you have to prove you can do it and that you're going to be a good end ""product"" that will excel and take the McCombs education to the fullest extent. You're at a disadvantage as a transfer, but you can still do it. I did E+E, like I mentioned, and they DEFINITELY let new members be leaders. Try Distinguished Speakers, try to plan an event, then list it on your resume to sounds as impressive as you honestly can and that's gonna help. Like I said....it's a competitive school to get into. You can TOTALLY do it with a 15 hour schedule....but not while keeping a perfect GPA, with tough classes, and any chance of a social life with all that combined. It will be a sleepless year for you, unfortunately.   In the end, I think going Business means more stress and more work. Would you say that the benefits/connections/networking/experiences that come from a Business degree, as compared to those gained from a Communications w/ Business cert degree, makes the extra effort worth it in the end? If gaining a Business degree, in the big picture, is only ""somewhat"" better than Communications in the end, I'm wondering if it's worth sacrificing all the time and energy required to power through and get in to McCombs.   So....here's where it gets tough and depends on what you want. If you get in McCombs and then do well in McCombs, you can get a great job presuming you keep a decent GPA, keep up that leadership, and have a great looking resume for your senior year. BUT you want to write. You want to be creative, You want a job that will match that. Honestly, I think you'd be happier with Communications. You can and will get a job with Comm (especially with the BFC) if you get the experience, internships, and leadership while you're on campus with a decent GPA. Few people get jobs from a diploma and a GPA. Most get a job from proving they can do it through experience on campus. GPAs prove you know how to work hard. Leadership proves you're a capable person who gets shit done and can work with other people. You'll be a happier person, have more time for experiences, and will still get a good job with health insurance with your communications plan. If you were a freshman applying to UT and asking, I'd have a different answer. If you really wanted to get into marketing for a big company or brand, I'd have a different answer. I loved marketing and what it gave me, but for you...I wouldn't sacrifice your time hoping on getting through a program you might not like, when you could have fun, get involved, and have time to explore your passions - you'll be fine! Be sensible but follow your gut on this one. Don't worry about unemployment - do stuff in college and you'll be fine."
UTAustin,3an2za,PurpleHooloovoo,1 point,Mon Jun 22 01:44:22 2015 UTC,"Wow. What a great, detailed response! I think I learned more about what I'm actually getting into from your reply right here than any other information I've read on the UT website. Seriously, thank you for telling me what I needed to hear.   Well, I think you've convinced me. Communications with a BFP cert seems like the best option for me at this point. I've always been an ardent believer in going to college for something practical, something you can take away and use to find a job and succeed in life. But I also value meeting new people, doing things (study abroad, for example, is on my list of things to do before I graduate), and just living life in general. It's the kind of stuff that inspires my writing.   As I read through your reply, I really sat there and pictured myself living through a year of getting Business pre-requisites. Honestly, I believe I could do it; I could force myself to power through those nasty classes and getting involved in campus leadership. Whether I maintain that flawless GPA is another thing, but you get my point. But then I got to thinking what I'd be giving up -- missing out on social outings, time to kick back at a Starbucks and enjoy some coffee while writing, fitness (I workout 30-50 minutes each day, 6-7 days a week), and sleep, as you said. Maybe it's just not worth it.   Something else that I just noticed, too. You mentioned ""leader"" quite a bit, how McCombs wants leaders. To be honest, I naturally tend to step back and let others lead. I'm much better in equal cooperation, group discussion, and teamwork, but to step up, take a lead, and make decisions? I've never been one to do that, even in social groups. Seems like that would be just one more thing I'd have to force myself to learn by going to McCombs.   I've registered to attend an info session for Communications, and I'm excited to learn more. Now, it's time to figure out which field of communications to study in...   But again, thanks so much."

There is nothing scarier than the ""so, what do you want to study REALLY"" mid-college crisis, so I get where you're coming from.

UTAustin,3an2za,mostlybran,5,Mon Jun 22 06:10:30 2015 UTC,"If Advertising is on the table and you really want to incorporate writing in some way, I suggest going through Texas Creative program as a copywriter. It's competitive, one of the best undergrad portfolio sequences in the country, and copywriting is a great career if you love writing. It's also fairly easy to tack on Business Foundations; I believe only two extra business courses will get you the certificate.  That said, marketing is definitely the more financially stable option. It really depends on how high of a priority that is for you, and whether you think it's worth it to suffer through the classes in college so you don't struggle to find a job later.

UTAustin,3an2za,inveterateasshole,2,Mon Jun 22 00:32:12 2015 UTC,"If you simply want to be financially comfortable, it doesn't matter what your major is. Pin a list of the majors to your wall and throw a dart at it. What matters is the connections you make, especially with internships. Really really make sure that you do at least one internship. Other than that, keep your GPA up just in case a prospective employer asks, but they're unlikely to.  With all that in mind, talk to the professors in each department. They'll be happy to give you advice, and it's a great way to get a feel for the types of people that each field attracts."

A film degree won't do anything for you by itself, but building a stable of reliable people that you can work with will go a long way towards helping you find work later.  Also, grades aren't everything.  You're in a creative program, so be honest with yourself.  Is it important to get an A, or do you want to develop your own voice?  Grades aren't an indicator of talent.  I've seen people do great work that falls outside the ""rules"" of the project and get a C, and I've seen by-the-numbers crap get the A for following instructions regardless of artistic consideration. Finally, and most importantly, you will build a reputation with your peers.  Always be certain that you're representing yourself (especially on set/projects) in a way that you'd like to be remembered.  Humility is your friend."

I personally know about 10 RTF graduates, none of them working in their field and all of them were stellar students with great projects/internships/etc.  Even with your expensive diploma, you're still going to start at the bottom and work for barely over minimum wage.  You can do that without an RTF degree and a mountain of student debt."

UTAustin,3ak7dc,the_hibachi,5,Sun Jun 21 04:13:06 2015 UTC,There are a few slightly away from campus that are worth your time if you can find a way there.   Bird's has multiple locations in Austin. They have a student discount and the closest one is near the Hancock center.   The best men's haircut in town IMO is a little further north. Luis's Corner Barbershop is on the corner of Guadalupe and Airport and they are spectacular. Gabriel and Raymond do a great job (if they still work there).
UTAustin,3ak7dc,elektritekt,2,Sun Jun 21 05:52:17 2015 UTC,"Gabriel left, I think he's opening his own place now. Raymond still works there though.

UTAustin,3ak7dc,elektritekt,2,Sun Jun 21 07:48:37 2015 UTC,"I tried Wooten my first month in Austin. The thing that made me decide to not come back (besides the price) was that the barber interrupted me mid-description with ""yeah I know exactly what ya want"", he didn't.   I'm guessing they are still around because of the location and "" weirdness "" but that kind of attitude towards your customers just doesn't fly for me."
UTAustin,3ak7dc,rotorcowboy,3,Sun Jun 21 00:31:20 2015 UTC,"I've had horrible experiences with Wooten. Perhaps it's because I'm shy and don't have a quick wit, but they were quite rude to me. The types of conversations they have will disgust all but the most perverted of people. One time, my barber literally dropped the scissors when a girl in yoga pants passed by the window so he could stare in awe. My god, the things they said to each other after that were deplorable."

Really your only luck for free parking will be to go north of campus. Parallel parking between 30th and 34th streets west of Duval and east of Speedway is by far your best bet. Watch out for signs requiring neighborhood parking permits (everything East of Duval and some of the roads in the area I listed require these permits). Wailing and Tom Green have tons of spots that are free. 30th street between speedway and Duval is a one way street and will be the closest you can get to campus, but these will fill up by about 8am.  If possible in your situation, pay to park on Dean Keeton, drop off all your stuff in your room and then find the free parking. Optionally, pay to park on Dean Keeton until 6pm ($1/hour coins or credit card) which then becomes free until 8am. Get up around 7am and find free parking."
UTAustin,3ak4bv,_edd,5,Sun Jun 21 02:14:27 2015 UTC,"There is no long-term free parking on the campus. Certain pay-by-the-hour locations become free between 6 pm and 8 am (always check signage to confirm). However, parking in the North Campus area is free as long as you can find a spot. Make sure that the area is not resident-restricted. In the cases of leaving your car somewhere overnight, always lock your doors and keep valuables hidden or on your person."

UTAustin,3ak4bv,oogaboogabooo,5,Sun Jun 21 00:23:50 2015 UTC,"Here is the website for the UT parking division. I have no idea what you would qualify as in terms of visitor, student, etc., but garage parking is typically the most expensive. In terms of payment methods, I've only ever used debit/credit or cash (these are automated).  Parking on E Dean Keaton is pay-by-the-hour until after hours. If you plan to leave your car longer than a few hours it will be a hassle as they impose ""5 hour limits"" (i.e. you can buy a 5 hour block of time, and have to come back to buy the next 5 hours).   The North Campus area I referred to is mostly between Duval and Speedway. Generally, you can find some parking from 32nd street and on (32+). Hope that helps."

If you are a UT student, you can ride the bus for free (swipe in with your ID). If not, the bus fare will likely still be cheaper than parking on campus or in any of the metered spots."

There are also places where you can park for free and hop on a bus: https://www.capmetro.org/parkandride/  The MetroRail has a connecting UT shuttle bus to campus from MLK Station.  Driving to campus is a hassle with traffic and expensive with the wear and tear on your car in stop and go traffic/gas prices/parking.
UTAustin,3aiv2c,audiomuse1,1 point,Mon Jun 22 00:41:46 2015 UTC,"If you can afford the pass (and get the pass) then yes, do it.  You may also consider the garage behind the SSB and the garage attached to NOA as well (both along 27th Street).  Not as convenient but perhaps there isn't a wait there.  Or the Co-op garage at San Antonio/23rd."
UTAustin,3aiv2c,longhornisme,1 point,Sat Jun 20 18:40:08 2015 UTC,"I don't know what your class schedule is like, but I purchased the C+ pass as a grad student - I got the surface lot parking all the time and all garages after 5pm on weekdays and all day on weekends. This worked well for me because my department offers mostly night classes and when I did have to come in earlier the bus service from the surface lots is very good.   But, if you can afford the garage pass and the garage isn't waitlisted, then yeah it's super convenient."
UTAustin,3aiv2c,machli,0,Sat Jun 20 20:58:14 2015 UTC,"I'm an undergrad that commutes from North Austin and I currently have an annual parking pass at the San Antonio garage. I'd say it's well worth it, considering I also had a C permit pass two years ago and had difficulty finding parking (not to mention the C lots are much further from campus). However with the permit, there is always parking available (though it tends to fill up to the 4th-6th floor between 8am-9am) unless it's a game day, then you might have to surf the garage for a bit.   Regarding the issue of getting the permit, I snagged mine around late July or August. They open up permit sales around this time, and sell the remaining permits that haven't been renewed. Just make sure you check back regularly, they should have a date for when the permits will be sold for the year and it's really first come first serve.   It's a bit pricey, but overall I'd say it's very convenient and worth the money especially if you're parking at prime hours of the day. Otherwise, C lot parking is probably fine if you're on campus in the afternoon/evenings."
UTAustin,3aiv2c,stephology,1 point,Sun Jun 21 01:07:08 2015 UTC,Having you considered parking at North Lamar Transit Center or the Triangle and hopping on a bus to UT?  There's a MetroRapid stop there and goes every 12-15 min to UT with a stop on the Drag.  Would save money spent on parking and the wear and tear/gas spent for your car. There are also park and rides in Leander and near Lakeline Mall.  You ride free on all Austin city buses and the MetroRail with your UT ID.  https://www.capmetro.org/parkandride/

UTAustin,3aigyg,cuttooth,1 point,Sat Jun 20 15:11:00 2015 UTC,"In the same vein, I wasn't in the top ten percent of my high school, but I have high ACT and SAT scores (33 and 2170), so am I about a close as possible to guaranteed admission?   To qualify for Automatic Transfer Admission, you must have qualified for automatic admission when you first applied to college and have attended a junior/community college afterwards. You are not guaranteed admission to UT."
UTAustin,3aigyg,kazaanabanana,1 point,Sat Jun 20 15:39:02 2015 UTC,"The curriculum is extremely structured, or at least was while I was there.  That was 3 years ago, granted.  /u/cuttooth already posted the tech areas that you can direct yourself into by your junior year.    As far as admissions/scholarships/honors I have some worse news.  At least in my year, biomedical engineering was statistically (in terms of applicants versus accepted) the hardest major at UT to get into.  It is unlikely you will retain scholarships unless they span the UT system, or are independent of it.  I was in the Honors program as well, and can tell you that it wasn't as hard to get into as the major, but to be honest in engineering it didn't afford me many special opportunities save for a resume booster and for a couple special math and chemistry classes.  If you have any other questions let me know, as I was very involved with the BME department while I was there (not so much the Honors/Plan II or admissions office though)"
UTAustin,3aigyg,doctah_Y,1 point,Sat Jun 20 16:26:51 2015 UTC,"There are actually a few people that I've met that have transfered into the Biomedical Engineering program from other universities including UTD! I love the program here and it is pretty structured with various electives that you can take to match which track you want to pursue. The advisor is extremely helpful so I believe that it won't be too much trouble figuring out your classes and how transferring credits work!   As far as I understand about acceptance, it varies based on the other people that are trying to transfer in as well! I've seen people who were salutatorians in high school and fail to get into the program! Obviously, I'm not an expert on the admissions process so don't take anything I say too seriously!"

UTAustin,3ag8ui,UTmania,3,Fri Jun 19 22:07:41 2015 UTC,Internal transfer is 100% GPA based. Get 30 hours at UT Austin and you can apply. Cutoff is usually 3.7-3.8
UTAustin,3ag8ui,EJOtter,2,Fri Jun 19 23:58:26 2015 UTC,"Your UT Austin GPA is literally the only thing that will be considered.  Those with the highest UT GPA's will take the open seats in the program (the number of seats is determined by students leaving the program, so this changes every semester).  If there is a GPA tie amongst competing students, the student further along in the CHE degree sequence will get the seat.  It's frustrating that your good GPA from another school doesn't help you - I had to deal with the same thing - but it's just the way the system works.  You'll need at least 30 and no more than 60 hours in residence at UT Austin.  I got in with a 3.7 a year and a half ago.  While it is a good idea in general to go talk to Kelly to get information about the program, the McKetta School isn't the entity overseeing the internal transfer (that'd be the Cockrell School of Engineering), so she actually has nothing to offer you in that respect.  I hope you've already taken PHY 303K, because it's really tough here, is required for admission into the program, and you're going to need to make close to straight A's to have a chance at getting in."
UTAustin,3ag8ui,tuitilidie,1 point,Sat Jun 20 18:06:39 2015 UTC,"I transferred to ChemE from ME. I got rejected for the fall semester, but got accepted for the spring (when they lower the cutoff). Your GPA looks great! Hopefully you can get in on your first try."

UTAustin,3ag8ui,PlayLikeNewbs,1 point,Fri Jun 19 23:54:17 2015 UTC,"So the real answer is a lot more complex than this, The department takes more than just your gpa into account. The closest to a real answer you'll get is by talking to Kelly McQ, the faculty advisor. You can find her info on the chem e utexas website.   i'm a recent chem E grad and all of the chem E transfers I talked to had 3.7 or higher. Take this with some salt, as the cutoff seems to go up every year."
UTAustin,3ag8ui,chambrayshirt,1 point,Fri Jun 19 23:46:09 2015 UTC,"The Cockrell internal transfer site has the best information related to what it takes to get in. You're going to need at least a 3.7 cumulative GPA and 3.75 technical GPA to be a competitive applicant. Make sure that the technical courses you take at UT count toward a CHE degree. Also you only need 28 hours at UT to apply to Cockrell, not 30."
UTAustin,3ag8ui,currygod,1 point,Sun Jun 21 18:21:09 2015 UTC,"I transferred into ChemE from ECE this last December, halfway through my sophomore year. The internal transfer process is almost entirely GPA-based, BUT you will have a very slight advantage over competitors if you have already finished a large portion of the basic sequence ChemE curriculum and would be well on your way to potentially graduating as a ChemE. Also, as you've probably read on the transfer page, Cockrell students can internally transfer within the college both in the Fall AND the Spring, while non-Cockrell students can only apply in the Spring. This may be something to keep in mind.  To give you a sense of what it takes to get in, my GPA when I transferred was somewhere around a 3.7 and I had finished 40% of the ChemE degree plan. It's hard work, but doable if you stay focused. My advice to you would be to utilize any AP credit you have so you can get ahead in the degree plan, and don't be afraid to use a Q-drop or two if you think a class is going to ruin your GPA. Best of luck!"

UTAustin,3afbnp,arimaspii,3,Sat Jun 20 00:00:26 2015 UTC,"I'm not at McCombs but as an outsider it seems like a lot of work. But they like to party too. Recruiting is excellent, my business school friends are being placed with excellent jobs at big companies. They are mostly staying in TX, but they are mostly from TX so that's where they want to be. I think you'd be fine going to CA post graduation. It's a great school.  West Campus is very close to campus, but everything is full now. North Campus can be close to Wheatsville co-op if you live close to 30th st. It can get full but I know people who have found apts there late in the game.  Hyde Park is also a nice area-- I know people who live around 39th/40th street and take the bus to class. It's much cheaper there, too. Wherever you look, use google maps to plot the bus route to campus from each location. Everyone bikes in Austin too, so you might find getting a bike is a good way to go once you're here.  If you live in Hyde Park you'll probably be going to H-E-B off Red River, so check out the bus route there, too.  Are you looking for roommates? This facebook group can be a good resource. You may find someone who is transferring/dropping out of UT who needs to sublease their place with existing roommates. This could be a good way to find a place without needing to go visit etc. Your roommates might have a car, as well, which would solve the grocery store problem. Plus if you want to live very close to campus, you might find a spot in West Campus this way."
UTAustin,3afbnp,arimaspii,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:59:58 2015 UTC,"Hmm I had originally wanted a place super close to campus but Hyde Park seems to be better suited to my preferences overall.

UTAustin,3afbnp,Juxe,1 point,Sat Jun 20 00:59:57 2015 UTC,"Gotcha! Hyde Park is a pretty cool area. It has more of an Austin-y feel than the areas right around campus, which is nice. I think the key will be joining clubs and activities on campus. If you have things to go to, you'll make friends. There are a lot of major-specific fraternities etc. that you can join as well. If you're involved on campus, you'll have a social life.  I'd say that there are more upperclassmen in Hyde Park vs. younger students, so many of the students living there will already have made friends. But so will a lot of students everywhere. Having roommates that you get along with can go a long way towards making new friends.   The bus system is fairly expansive, but not always on schedule. You'll want to get to the bus stop earlier than you need to just in case it comes early. I didn't have a car for my first two years at UT and it was just fine -- I took the bus to an internship and it worked pretty well. I've been burned a time or two (missed a flight after the airport route changed and I didn't know it) but now that Uber and Lyft are in Austin you don't have to worry about being stranded anywhere if the bus stops running, etc.   For getting to and from campus, the bus will be very dependable. You just won't have the luxury of rolling out of bed ten minutes before class, like many west campus students can do."
UTAustin,3afbnp,Juxe,2,Sun Jun 21 23:58:48 2015 UTC,"it all depends on how much work you want to put in. If you want to skirt by in all of your classes getting a B that's probably not too hard, but if you want to get an A in all of your classes you'll have to put more work in. Of course this varies depending on your professors and specific classes. As a McCombs student I kind of consider my extracurriculars part of my coursework as having a good resume and experience in leadership positions proved very useful for finding a job and gave good material for interviews. That depends on your job, I'm an iMPA (5 yrs to get a masters and bachelors in accounting) and i'm working for the big 4 who will let you work pretty much wherever you want after graduation. Personally I'm from Houston but I wanted to move to NY after graduation and I've accepted an offer to do so. I don't know much about the prospect of out-of-state jobs in other majors unfortunately.

I've held a few positions total from the clubs, but honestly as long as you're interested and dedicated you'll be fine getting a position. All of them have positions that open up in the Fall.  Hrm, I picked accounting mainly because I enjoyed my accounting classes more, MPA is ranked #1 so I know I would be given options for where I wanted to work  (I wanted to move out of Texas), and I didn't want to be an investment banker.  Honestly I think it'd be worth it to decide after you take ACC 311 (financial accounting) most people decide if they want to be MPAs (5 year masters in accounting) like me after that class."

So, hopefully, once you get in, your financial aid package should follow shortly after. The system packages students every MWF.   Make sure you don't have any requirements on your CASH page that could be holding packaging up, but otherwise just continue to be patient.   Also, if you have the Top 10% Scholarship or the TEXAS Grant (aka Texas Excellence Grant at other schools) be sure to let UT Austin's financial aid office know that. Those two awards are Texas-wide, meaning that you can also receive them at UT Austin as long as you qualify and meet the renewal requirements."

I didn't live there so I don't have any bad stories or anything remotely like that, but I've never heard anyone highly recommend it, either. If you can get on campus most of the dorms are newly remodeled and pretty decent places to live and make friends. I know that might be tough this late in the game, of course.

Matlab, Labview or any similar programming tool is not intensive at all. Also there will be strong computers that will run the software everywhere even at home.   Get something you like that is reliable and within your budget. I liked the SP3. I got the 128gb i5 model for $720 at eBay with warranty. I don't know if it was used or refurbished or new, but hey I got it and I registered the serial number on Microsoft for the warranty. It looks new for all I care.   Honestly the best contenders sfor general purpose light pcs seem to be the Asus ux305 for best value. SP3 for versatility (strongest cpu among these optiobs), xps 13 for a great form factor and design. And the new mac book for who knows what but everyone has one. These are the most portable options over $700 bucks (ux305 is 700 on the spot).  You could also snatch one of those deals for an inspiron 5000 they pop up all the time. And you will save a lot of money. But really engineering students are all getting mobile processors. Low heat low performance and high battery time and everyone does just fine.   Sucks for design and art students since they do need a little more powerful stuff.  https://www.squaretrade.com/laptop-reliability-1109/ This is on par with my personal experience fixing countless laptops.

One of my friends got into Turing, and she only took 1 year of CS in high school (declined the opportunity to take more even tho my school offered like 3 years, but she's hella smart and was top ten).  You mentioned that you'll be a sophomore-- not sure how the criteria will change given that Turing is initially geared towards incoming freshman, so it might be valuable to show outside initative: projects you've worked on over the summer, languages you know, etc.  Hope this helps and see ya on the 40 acres next year!"

UTAustin,3a1ck2,Lily_Essence,4,Tue Jun 16 13:36:54 2015 UTC,"This is my opinion about college in general. Choose the major where you think you will learn the most in order to get a good enough starting job. Since ECE and CS are very, very similar in terms of job type, your next criteria should be which lets you graduate faster? College is not a place where people learn how to do well in the working world, often times recent graduates go through a ""re-learning process"" where they have to relearn everything they ""studied"" in college and see how it relates to the real world, or doesn't in most cases. So the track that gets you out of this institution and into the real world where you will actually be spending the next few decades. This advice is coming from the assumption that you do not want to go to grad school immediately after college, but even if you did, graduating on time will help with that (the main thing about getting into grad school is research, research, research). Hopefully this somewhat helped in your decision!"
UTAustin,3a1ck2,nicharesuk,1 point,Tue Jun 16 14:07:54 2015 UTC,"At the moment, I don't think I'll be going directly into grad school, but I haven't gotten the chance/time to do research.

What if I end up hating that kind of job?   I guess I haven't given my future that much thought, but I find it really hard to think that far ahead when I don't even know what I can/cannot do.  Should I look into doing research this coming semester?"
UTAustin,3a1ck2,nicharesuk,5,Tue Jun 16 14:27:37 2015 UTC,"I guess this goes into more personal territory, but I think you should focus on what it is you want to do with your life. Start testing things now, yes find a research opportunity, after that find a part-time programming job. See which you like, if you like either at all. I don't think, though, that there's anything that I can say that will lead you into finding what you want. Only you can do that, and that's the joy of life and your time in college, finding what it is that drives you, but you and only you can figure that out, no one else can.

One thing to keep in mind with transferring though is I've heard CS does not take that many (if any) EE credits as substitutes for the CS courses. So you might have to start at square one, thus making you graduate later, thus making you spend more money on school and less time pursuing the career path you want. (Keep in mind many companies also do their own research so you're not limited to research in a graduate school setting)"
UTAustin,3a1ck2,Sekrim,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:05:27 2015 UTC,"I got into CS but they let me double in ECE. CS told me that none of my ECE courses will transfer into CS. Funny thing is CS 311 and CS 314 did count for ECE. It doesn't work both ways sadly.   So the moral of the story is to pick the CS class over the ECE class when it transfers, otherwise you'll be taking the same course multiple times."
UTAustin,3a1ck2,rjj296,1 point,Wed Jun 17 03:14:58 2015 UTC,Were you originally a complete transfer applicant but they still let you double major?  They told me I could only double major if that was what I applied as.
UTAustin,3a1ck2,rjj296,1 point,Wed Jun 17 03:27:37 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't remember what I put on the application cause it was so long ago. But when I called the CNS dean's office I asked if I could add a major, they said I could, so I guess I said I was gonna add a major on the application."
UTAustin,3a1ck2,leros,3,Wed Jun 17 03:57:14 2015 UTC,"This is a dilemma I had when I applied to UT. After talking to professionals in the field two things were pointed out to me: all ECE majors can program, but not all CS majors can do ECE, and second, it really depends on what job you want to have."
UTAustin,3a1ck2,leros,1 point,Tue Jun 16 14:19:48 2015 UTC,"I've always imagined me with a job that was more high level programming than tinkering or developing hardware.   But I guess it's true how ECE can program (just not at the same level as CS), but CS can't do the electrical portions of ECE. But CS jobs don't really need that electrical portion, right?"
UTAustin,39zhyh,DickbuttCheney,6,Tue Jun 16 01:23:26 2015 UTC,I can't remember the specific problem but it was simple algebra and geometry problems. Most people finished before the time limit. It is also a lot easier than the modules online so don't fret too much about it.
UTAustin,39zhyh,PsykicPaper,5,Tue Jun 16 02:19:06 2015 UTC,"Can't remember what was on the test, but it was A LOT easier than the online ALEKS test. I somewhat struggled with the online ALEKS test, because it's been awhile since I did those type of questions. When I took in person, it was a breeze and got a 100.

UTAustin,3a0hfn,hamzacooly,4,Tue Jun 16 07:04:44 2015 UTC,"As a former prof, I can tell you that the most aggressive students usually got into my closed classes. They would ask, I would say ok or maybe or sometimes no, depending on the class. The smart ones would keep asking. Inevitably someone would drop during add/drop days for whatever reason and then the most persistent person or persons got in. Finally, the limits for my classes were usually set too low anyway, so most of the time, I didn't have a problem with a surplus because I knew that 2 or 3 students almost always drop at some point in the semester and it was usually NOT the ones that were begging to be in that class."

UTAustin,3a0hfn,kor321,3,Tue Jun 16 10:26:25 2015 UTC,"If they don't end up opening seats, then you can always appeal to the professor, but you cannot register for a closed class on your own. Not sure if asking the professor to be let in would help, though, with the number of CS students the department has trying to register for those classes."

I had to get in with some spots they leave specifically for transfer students, but I had to do it through my advisor and not by registering on my own. My advice is that you send out emails to any professors or CS advisors to get your voice out there and show how persistent you are. If not, add/drop in the first week of school may help you out. Good Luck :)"
UTAustin,39ykaq,Netflix_is_Life,2,Mon Jun 15 21:01:12 2015 UTC,"I've said it quite a few times before on this sub, I really think this was a great option: Intro to Ancient Rome combined with Greek Mythology gets you both your foreign culture requirements AND the VAPA requirement. They're both really interesting. They do require a good bit of reading, but it honestly wasn't too bad. I had Rome with Lundy online (freaking awesome to do self-paced stuff), and Mythology in class with Aprile. Be warned, if you take Aprile's class, she talks fast and the slides are sparse, so you better either have an excellent memory or be able to type notes fast."

UTAustin,39xp9j,EngineeringLonghorn,4,Mon Jun 15 17:26:00 2015 UTC,"You will probably take EE 302 (Intro to Electrical Engineering) and EE 306 (Intro to Computing) as these are what most ECE students take their first semester.  You need UGS 302 or 303, and most students try to get that over with during their first semester, but they fill up quickly, as many incoming freshman try to grab them.  As for math classes, unless your calc classes already cover all the material in it, you should take M 408D (Series, Sequences, and Multivariable calc), which is the second class in the accelerated calculus track. You could also take the M 408M (Multivariable calc) from the regular calc track if you'd like, but 408D will include material you should have already learned, making it an easy A. If the calc classes you have already taken cover all the material taught (I don't know what you do and don't know), you could go straight for M 427J (Differential equations), although I really don't recommend going for that unless you are sure you have covered all the material in the basic calc classes.  Other classes you could look into if you need more are Visual and Performing Arts (TD 301 was an easy A for me and provides the required Cultural Diversity flag), RHE 306 (Rhetoric and writing) or one of the E 316's (Literature) if you already have credit for rhetoric. When looking for other classes to take try to get one that also satisfies the Global Cultures or the Cultural Diversity flags that aren't covered by the ECE degree plan  I don't really know how orientation works for transfer students, but they should have you talk to an advisor. They can help you make sure you know what to take, as I don't know exactly what credits you do and don't have.  Here is a handy chart that basically shows most of what I just said. The only change is that M 427K is no longer offered and has been replaced with M 427J."
UTAustin,39xp9j,fishheads24,2,Mon Jun 15 18:40:51 2015 UTC,I'm not an electrical engineer so I have no experience with your classes but I use this website's (http://www.ece.utexas.edu/undergraduate/curriculum) equivalent for my BME classes. Look under 2014-2016 catalog to see what classes they suggest for a four year plan and there are some flowcharts for prereqs and coreqs. Hope this helps.

UTAustin,39wteb,anuragbakshi,3,Mon Jun 15 13:16:30 2015 UTC,"Hey! The best option for someone who wants to get a little ahead in math, and who has taken MVC in high school, is to, rather than taking M 408*, take Dr. Gilbert's M 427L-AP class. He only offers it to freshmen with 5s on the BC Calculus AP, so keep that in mind. It is, however, one of the funnest and most interesting classes I've taken so far. After that, I recommend taking M 341 with Dr. Hadani (if you're interesting in doubling in math, it's what you want to take to decide whether or not you actually want to go for the BS) and M 427J to get all of your basic math requirements out of the way (with the exception of M 362K, Probability I).  source: took 427L, TA for 341  (Also, I joined Turing at the end of my first spring semester too. Make sure to take 311H and 314H!)"

UTAustin,39wteb,rlostrevino,1 point,Mon Jun 15 22:39:04 2015 UTC,AFAIK a 5 on the Calculus BC AP exam is the only way of getting credit for 408m. There's a Calculus CLEP exam but it will only give you credit for 408c/k. You can check the Student Testing website.
UTAustin,39wteb,JeremyPriest,2,Mon Jun 15 14:07:01 2015 UTC,"Can you send me the link to where you found this? On the website you linked to, it says I can only skip C, K, L. This is where I looked: http://ctl.utexas.edu/studenttesting/ap-exam-mathematics-calculus-bc"
UTAustin,39wteb,rlostrevino,2,Mon Jun 15 14:27:04 2015 UTC,"He's mistaken. A BC 5 will only award you K and L credit. What some engineering students (unsure about other majors) are able to do, however, is register for the M 427L honors section. This may require advisor approval. I didn't do it myself. This honors section is flagged to count for M 408M and M 427L credit, but keep in mind it only counts four hours total. Definitely talk to an advisor about this possibility. It may not even be a thing anymore."
UTAustin,39wteb,litsax,2,Mon Jun 15 15:11:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah... sorry bout that. The way the text is wrapped on the website it looks like it's M 408 C, or M instead of M 408 C, or M 408 K."
UTAustin,39wteb,JeremyPriest,2,Mon Jun 15 16:00:30 2015 UTC,"Just finished my freshman year. They're doing a new thing where a 5 on BC covers C and D, which is the equivalent of K L and M."

UTAustin,39wteb,JeremyPriest,2,Mon Jun 15 15:14:51 2015 UTC,"If I remember correctly, a 5 on the Calc BC AP actually did give credit for M408C and M408D. Not sure if that is still true."
UTAustin,39w482,Speedy1g,3,Mon Jun 15 07:32:02 2015 UTC,"I've taken that class multiple times. I enjoyed it a lot. There is always a pretty wide range of abilities, from people who are just a step above ""not drowning"" to people who swam competitively in high school to members of the water polo team (some of which could probably qualify for the UT swim team if they wanted).  Most workouts range between about 1500 yards (slower lanes) to about 3000 yards (faster lanes) over the course of about 45-50 minutes. If you can comfortably swim 200 yards non-stop in 4 minutes or less, you'll be fine. I think the minimum requirement is swimming 50 yards in 50 seconds (which they'll time you on at the start of the semester). They also use that time to split you into lanes (grouped with people of similar speeds).  Most individual sets tend to be between 25 and 200 yards, although towards the end of the semester, you'll usually do the ""mile"" swim (1650 yards, non-stop if you can, but some break it apart, like into 4x400 + 50 at the end).  There's also the ""Stroke Technique"" class which, as the name suggests, focuses on developing proper technique for the four competitive strokes. You don't do as much yardage, but you get more instruction on swimming correctly. If you're already comfortable swimming and just want to increase your fitness level, then ""Swim Conditioning"" is probably what you want. That class doesn't focus as much on technique (they assume you already know the strokes), but works more on doing endurance and interval sets to increase your level of fitness."

UTAustin,39w482,mrflarp,2,Tue Jun 16 21:52:46 2015 UTC,"No, you don't have to be fit. The point of the class is to become a little healthier while learning proper swimming techniques. The instructors are very supportive. After the first week or two they'll organize you into lanes based on your speed so that faster swimmers aren't constantly lapping and running into the slower ones. I took the course a couple years ago with a friend who is a bit on the heavy side and we both enjoyed it immensely."

UTAustin,39w482,mrflarp,1 point,Tue Jun 16 04:31:07 2015 UTC,"More time spent on instruction in Stroke Tech to learn the strokes themselves (demonstrations, drills, etc.), and less time just doing laps (I don't remember really doing much more than 1000-1200 yards in a typical day).  Less time spent on instruction of technique in Conditioning, and more time spent just doing laps.

In order to get more of a college experience, you'll find that spending a lot of time on campus in areas set up to be socially accessible will help you.

UTAustin,39x980,quegrawks,4,Mon Jun 15 16:47:35 2015 UTC,"It's possible to find apartments that are very close to campus, I'm an incoming freshman and I'm living off campus about three blocks away which is close enough for me.  Living off campus though does mean that you won't have a meal plan which is pretty useful as a college student. Also most apartments don't come fully furnished so you have to consider that cost on top of your deposit and food costs.  Considering the differences in cost of the actual rent there isn't much of a difference, another 50-100 dollars more a month, the higher end of that for something really lavish.  And also financial aid isn't released until ten days before the start of the semester at the earliest so do expect to pay first months rent and to pay that deposit.

That particular location has the advantage of giving you the capability to be isolated, but easy access to social experiences when you feel like it.

Focus more on taking something away from your classes that you can apply to a job. I check this place out occasionally since I got my cs degree from UT like 10 years ago.
UTAustin,39sjpe,craiwill,2,Tue Jun 16 18:26:26 2015 UTC,"The BSA is lacking a bit (imo) with only 10 CS courses required unless you pick a hard science minor.  The BA is ideal for double majors, which still requires 13 CS courses vs 14 CS courses for the BS.  Regardless, any of these degrees are fine and I doubt any employers will care either way.  (Be skeptical of those who do...)"
UTAustin,39sjpe,hiccupeater,2,Mon Jun 15 12:30:57 2015 UTC,"I can tell you that employers respect a BA in CS less than a BS in CS, but the BSA degree may require a little explaining, since most employers will not be familiar with the requirements."
UTAustin,39sjpe,iliveintexas,0,Sun Jun 14 19:41:25 2015 UTC,"A BS seems a bit more appealing for employers IMO since it involves a bit more science and math. AFAIK the BFP is not a minor. It can be taken with a BS and most advisors would recommend that over a minor as it's more likely to be noticed. Even though BSA's might sound as though they combine both a BS and a BA, the BS tend to be more competitive. Take neuroscience for example, their BS is sort of becoming an honors major (requiring people inside CNS to internally transfer to it) while their BSA remains open for any CNS major.  Here's an article on BSA's https://cns.utexas.edu/news/understanding-bsa-degree and a little snippet ""it really depends on what you want. There are lots of employers who tell us they would like science students who can write their way out of a paper bag. Others would rather have computer science students who basically took CS courses until their heads explode. Those employers are both right for their own context. One is not better than the other. You have to figure it out based on your own career goals."""
UTAustin,39sjpe,rlostrevino,9,Sun Jun 14 11:52:27 2015 UTC,"It's interesting that you have this opinion, because if you do a search for ""BSA"" on the UT computer science page, every single post will tell you that it doesn't matter. The actual CS core classes are the same for both degree plans, and switching to the BSA has allowed me more time and freedom to work on actual resume boosting things - like personal projects, for instance. I had already taken multivariable calculus before switching to the BSA, so honestly the main factor in my decision to switch was the second science sequence requirement in the BS - why spend time taking a whole other BIO/CHEM/PHYS track when you can use that time to take more CS classes?  That being said, to each their own."

I have the 7.2 model and it is great.   You'll hear people say to get a cheap bike, but it all comes down to the lock.

Mostly because of my majors there was a lot of overlap with Finance and Business Law, and the other classes were just a waste. MIS is definitely the most valuable course, but can be replaced by any online excel/HTML5 course. Accounting is useful if you want to work in business in any capacity, just to get a background. All in all, I don't regret it because there are a lot of skills you develop that translate directly to your resume, but I wouldn't say I learned much i couldn't have found elsewhere."

UTAustin,39m8oy,iPat89,2,Fri Jun 12 22:39:52 2015 UTC,If you have access to the non-business foundations MIS do it for sure. You don't do much coding (my high school ap compsci did Java) but you will learn HTML basics and excel.

Also pro tip, if you're trying to attend office hours and it's a huge swarm of kids (like it always is around office hours), see if there are any other TA's hanging around the hall that will be willing to help--we're all pretty nice and approachable people. My office hours would be dead when I TA'd for an introductory programming course and I'd end up helping several 302F kids that would wander their way in to my office.

For the most part, I enjoyed taking the classes and I feel that I learned a lot and enough to communicate with folks in the business side. Compared to your science and engineering courses, the work load isn't too bad.  I remembered studying a day or two before exams and i will do well.  The professors are generally good since they all teach other courses within Mccombs. Either way, UT is genius to put a program like this knowing that not everyone could get into the school of business.     Anyways, I'll be glad to answer any other questions you have.

The best advice i can give you is focus all your effort into your coursework early into your undergrad career, snag an internship, and then relax. Employers care alot more about experience than grades. So freshmen year if you have a 4.0 you have a chance at an internship, and then can cruise at 3.5 and be in better shape than a 4.0 student with 0 experience.  Your first internship will snowball into better ones."

If nothing else, the BFP classes make you a much better employee, help you communicate better with management, and will get you a head start on the management track (if that is or becomes your thing).

They told to submit an appeal since I had credit for all those courses, but I guess an appeal's useless when it comes to technical courses. I tried taking the intro EE classes. I got a spot but the time conflicted with my m427k class so I ended up not taking it.   TL;DR: Try taking upper division math courses, registering for the two intro EE courses, and getting mostly A's in all your classes and you should be fine."

UTAustin,39k84c,EngineeringLonghorn,1 point,Sat Jun 13 04:01:08 2015 UTC,"Sadly no, They don't do much to help you if you have all the technical courses you can take and I wasn't aware of most of it my first semester. But you seem to be in good standing so it shouldn't be too hard, although I would recommend going to the internal transfer sessions and talking to an engineering advisor. They'll help you get into EE classes. I did however get notified today that I got into CS, so I have that going on for me. Anyway good luck with your internal transfer application and if you have any other questions don't hesitate to ask ;)"

There are many more opportunities that Austin has to offer, and I liked how much bigger UT was than Baylor. Let me know if you have any specific questions."
UTAustin,39jdit,megyem,1 point,Fri Jun 12 12:27:23 2015 UTC,"Are the classes more difficult at UT or is all a matter of determination? Is it difficult to get to know your professor? What program did you transfer to? I wasn't accepted into the program I wanted so I would be in the COLA program whereas I'm already in the Baylor business program, is it difficult to internally transfer between schools? Were you happier at UT?"
UTAustin,39jdit,megyem,2,Sat Jun 13 21:20:11 2015 UTC,"I would say classes aren't anymore difficult at UT vs Baylor. I found it just as easy to get to know my professors here as I would go in often for office hours, and one of them ended up writing a recommendation for me for my job. I went from International Studies at Baylor to Asian Studies at UT. I don't know too much about internal transfer and hopefully someone will chime in about that. I would look up the business advisors here at UT and stop in for a face to face meeting vs emailing/calling. I was a lot happier at UT, but that is because I didn't enjoy the religious atmosphere at Baylor and I found a lot more diversity in student thought at UT. I'm more liberal/agnostic so it was nice to come to a place where that wasn't seen as odd. I also like getting out on the weekends, and while Waco has Cameron Park, UT has a ton of trails/parks and bike paths."

UTAustin,39jdit,_edd,6,Fri Jun 12 03:50:37 2015 UTC,That one guy took an incredibly pessimistic view of Texas. It is a great university.   I would say that the biggest factor should be your major.

UTAustin,39jdit,HumsWhileHePeees,2,Mon Jun 15 14:42:51 2015 UTC,"I hope you've already done your research and are here just for personal opinions. If not, please contact the department/college you've been accepted to at UT and make sure that your credits transfer. As unfortunate as it sounds, UT does not accept all of Baylor's curriculum.   I've had friends at Baylor and at UT who have loved their respective schools, and I've also had friends at Baylor who had less than ideal experiences and either stuck it out and resented it or transferred and found happiness elsewhere. (I will say that everyone I've ever known who has attended UT loved it and wouldn't have traded it for the world.)   I disagree with @yeeeeaaaa in that the campus is ""butt ugly."" I'd say that the majority of the campus is gorgeous and nicely maintained for its sprawling size. Yes, some of the buildings appear to be neglected, but there are quite a few ""state of the art"" new buildings that, I think, more than compensate.   All in all, both are great schools. For me, if I was in your position, I'd view my options through a more ""long term"" lens.  You're already in Baylor's business school, yes? Do you think you'll be able to get into and graduate from McCombs? What are your post-grad plans? Get a job or go to grad school? [A friend got a job immediately post graduation from the b-school at Baylor purely based on a recommendation from his professor. He lives and works here in Austin.]  What were your reasons for leaving Baylor in the first place? Do they still hold true? Did you apply to or get accepted into anywhere else beside Texas?  Are you thinking of possibly changing your major? Which school has the better program for plan B? Lastly, are you prepared for the culture shock that will be moving to and living in Austin post Waco? Have you been to Austin? Do you even like it?   Regardless of your decision, I wish you the best of luck in your endeavors.  \m/"
UTAustin,39jdit,yeeeeaaaa,5,Mon Jun 15 23:27:01 2015 UTC,"As a Baylor student who now goes to UT for grad school, here's what I'd say:  If you have friends at Baylor, orgs, a life, money to pay for BU etc., don't transfer. Transferring throws all the time that you spent building your life at Baylor, and when you get to a new school the friend groups will already be set.   The Downsides: Disclaimer: I love going to grad school here for the prestige of the program I am in, and I love the people, but overall, I preferred Baylor as a school.   UT's campus is butt ugly and way too crowded compared to Baylor. I'm talking about weeds, trash, peeling paint, etc.   The campus is also so incredibly huge that walking anywhere takes forever compared to Baylor. If you are lucky, you will take classes in one of the nicer buildings on campus. I, on the other hand, spend my days in a dreary, yellowed, and building with no windows in most rooms, or dirty windows in the lucky rooms. It makes Draper look like a nice, cheery building by comparison.  Parking is absolute shit. $650 per year for a spot in only one garage a mile from your building kind of shit. Or park on a meter and get monthly parking tickets.  The cost of living in Austin is SKY HIGH compared to Waco-- an apartment that costs you $650/mo in Waco will run you over $1,000 in Austin.  Traffic. so much traffic. Especially compared to Waco.  Academics: You will be one in a school of 51,000 instead of 1 in 16,000. That makes a huge difference when it comes to personalized attention from professors, red tape when it comes to graduating, etc.  UT has lost tons of funding from the state and most people I know have had to take victory laps to pick up the credits they could not get in past years due to budget cuts that have lead to lower availability of class slots.   Red. Tape. You ever have a problem at Baylor, and you could just phone someone up and they'd take care of it? Or did you ever have an administrator take pity on you and help you out so you'd not flunk out? Good luck with that happening at UT.  I also feel like it's harder to get good grades at UT, maybe because of the individualized attention thing.   Especially if you are in math or science fields, you have a decent chance of ending up with a professor who speaks bad or broken English.  The Upsides: Austin has better food and nightlife than Austin. More booze (obvi).   PM me if you want more info.   EDIT: People, don't downvote someone because they provide a negative opinion. Both schools are good, I'm just sharing my experience comparing the two, which is what OP asked for."
UTAustin,39jdit,iH8ExtremeLiberals,8,Fri Jun 12 03:38:59 2015 UTC,"I will admit that there are buildings on both of far north and far south of the campus that need renovating, but the campus as a whole is very well kept. It lacks the space and foliage because it is an urban school and with that, getting to classes is a breeze because everything is actually close contrary to what you say. In regards to parking, if you are unwilling to pay for a garage or see the price as unreasonable, either purchase a $100~ parking permit in a lot or utilize the free buses. Apartments can also go as low as $400 in Austin in the Riverside area, the $1000 ones are either in West Campus or downtown.  With the situation of the faculty to student ratio, you have to be the one to go out of your way to make that connection since that's what the real world will entail if you don't already have connections prior. This also relates to the topic of UT 'not helping you'. UT is a public school and what Baylor does could be seen somewhat as corruption since you are paying more/they are investing in your future donations as an alum. The whole broken english teacher thing is kind of true however."
UTAustin,39jdit,yeeeeaaaa,2,Fri Jun 12 06:01:47 2015 UTC,"True that some buildings/areas are better than others. That's what I mean about luck--unfortunately the area I spend time in is the northern/less-manicured area.   As for the taking time to walk/$$ to park/$$ to live, yes--there are ways of coping. Everyone does--but to compare to Baylor, it's a pretty big inconvenience, at least it has been from my personal experience. I just didn't feel like typing out the details last night.   For example:   Parking:  Baylor: $250/yr parking wherever you want to with student parking a block or mere feet from your classes/dorm--with the ability to drive to other locations with ease UT: $750/yr for one garage only, with no option to change garages if you take classes in another location, or $120ish to park across I-35 and then walk a mile. And sure the busses are okay, but it requires about 30-45 min of my time to schedule around the busses, while at Baylor, I could walk/drive to class in minutes, with very little traffic. It's just a more pleasant experience. Of course getting to class at UT isn't impossible. It's just more time-consuming and inconvenient compared to my personal experience at Baylor.  Rent: My rent at Baylor was $650/mo, with 5 min walk, front door-to- classroom-door. This was a 1BR/1Ba all bills paid, including high speed internet and a washer/dryer in unit--in 2012. For that same level of quality you are going to be shelling out more than twice as much money at UT.   Also as for the ""corruption"" thing--it's less ""corruption"" and more that as a public school UT has to jump through a lot of hoops--e.g., I once had to have a check re-cut to me after an accounting mixup. Rather than getting the funds back to me in a timely fashion, it took 6 months to get the money at UT. Administrative issues just take tons more time and effort to straighten out, while at Baylor it was simple. When I did have to get a registration deadline extended for myself in order to graduate on time, Baylor gave me no trouble about it. I do doubt that that would happen at UT. I worked my butt off to graduate on time at Baylor, and it would have been far more unfair to force me to not graduate because I couldn't get into a necessary class at Baylor. Something which happens regularly to people I know at UT. And if you did need to go to the admin. building at Baylor, it didn't require a 15-30 minute walk to the ""Tower,"" you could drive and park right in front of the admin building and get your problem addressed. It's not about corruption--mostly convenience.  Really it comes down to what is important to the individual, and for me, the day-to-day inconvenience of going to UT has been a pain in the butt compared to Baylor, and I think that for undergrad that was more important for me than in grad school. However, I am glad I came here due to the prestige of the program I am in now."

UTAustin,39jk2c,Russell_is_kool,3,Fri Jun 12 04:18:48 2015 UTC,"I lived in JWest for a year and I've had a few friends live in BRP.  The biggest Con about BRP is no elevators (IIRC).   Although Jester's elevators are slow during peak hours. JWest isn't that bad in terms of noise. Occasional annoyances on the weekend nights, but definitely not a constant party atmosphere. You'll have an RA at both places who can tell people to shut up.  You'll have more freshman in Jester and maybe a few more opportunities to meet friends. Also, more people have lived in Jester, so more alumni can relate to the experience.  The biggest Con I can think of is the lack of individual A/C controls. I didn't consider it too much of a bother, but it annoyed some people when the seasons changed (the HVAC system would be 2 days behind).  The nice thing about Jester is that everything is under one roof in terms of your dorm and food, which is awesome on cold days. It's also a center of life for much of UT and close to almost everything (except for music majors)."
UTAustin,39jk2c,iliveintexas,1 point,Fri Jun 12 06:13:03 2015 UTC,The elevator situation did suck since I lived on the top floor but if you're on the first floor it's a godsend during movein/out day since the doors leading to the streets were maybe 15 seconds away from your room.

UTAustin,39jk2c,iH8ExtremeLiberals,1 point,Fri Jun 12 06:46:23 2015 UTC,No elevators but there are only between 3-5 floors on certain parts of the building in each dorm.
UTAustin,39jk2c,CF5300,2,Fri Jun 12 18:41:29 2015 UTC,"Can't go wrong with either IMO.  I'm in Jester and it's quiet enough on most nights. Certainly not as bad as its reputation makes it out to be.   The ""unclean vibe"" in Jester mentioned before I think comes from the un-renovated floors, which admittedly, feel worse that the renovated rooms upstairs. They're renovating 3 floors per year IIRC, so this year floors 6-14 will all be renovated (movable furniture being the most notable of these renovations in regards to the rooms themselves) and have a much better feel."
UTAustin,39jk2c,iH8ExtremeLiberals,1 point,Fri Jun 12 06:41:12 2015 UTC,"I lived at the BRP last year and it is definitely quiet, which if you like is good. The walls are pretty thin though but oddly enough you'll only hear laughing down the hall sometimes or people talking as they walk by but other than that, silence. In my dorm at least, the rooms were very vintage and felt like a ghetto hogwarts or an abandoned early 20th century inn. There's a lot of wood is what I'm trying to say and the colors/atmosphere is darker compared to other dorms, not depressing but somewhat gothic/18th-19th euro/american architecture. It's hard to explain cause I'm not an architecture major.  Also imo jwest has an unclean vibe to it as your walking down the hallways, at least from my experience. In regards to the bus, there is a bus stop between BRP and San Jac so it is also very close. In fact, the BRP and jester are so close that the bus stop shouldn't be a concern. I did enjoy my time there though because of how much personal space you get since it isn't as crowded and you can also get to the rooftop of the Roberts dorm if you have any of the BRP dorms. Also sharing a communal bathroom with about 9 other guys is not bad. Idk how many other dorms have to share but I would assume it's more people since it is a bigger floor."

UTAustin,39jk2c,iliveintexas,1 point,Fri Jun 12 06:12:32 2015 UTC,I will say that the BRP doesn't have the shine of jester center/jeast. It is very old and the metal and wood show their age.

UTAustin,39jk2c,DomesticLarry,1 point,Fri Jun 12 06:14:02 2015 UTC,"I lived in BRP and everything is pretty accurate. The elevator thing only sucks on move in / out or when you have a lot to carry, so like 5 days out of the entire year. But what really sucks is the few times that it has rained if you want food you either have to go out in the rain or order in. Jester you could stay in and have everything that you need. And the majority of your friends are probably going to live in jester and you are going to be there a lot. But a big plus of brp is roof access and depending where you are the view is great because you (could) face 21st and game days, parades, etc look great."
UTAustin,39jk2c,Netflix_is_Life,1 point,Fri Jun 12 10:45:44 2015 UTC,"Lived in both. They both had different pros and cons.  Jwest- more social, bigger study lounges, closer to the store, food and Sanger learning center (maybe even some classes), renovated rooms, and you have a sink in your room. However, the showers take a while to heat up sometimes & you might have rowdy neighbors.  BRP- vintage feel of the room, big room (compared to jester), ac controls, showers that are immediately hot and almost always empty, more closet and dresser space, more community feel. However, you don't have a sink in your room (which can suck when you just want to get ready for bed in your room), you'll have to travel a while further to get food (which sucks when it's really cold or raining) and no elevators.   I did JEast my first semester and BRP my second semester. If I were to go back now (as a third year), I would choose BRP. But that's only because I have a solid friend circle at UT. If you feel like you'll rely on the dorm for 60% or more on the chances of meeting people, pick JWest."

Second semester, however, is very tough. The first two or three weeks is like being thrown in the ocean. A third of the class, if not more, dropped during that period. However, if you make it through, you'll be rewarded. Third and, as far as I know, fourth semester Chinese isn't nearly as tough, and that's been primarily because of the teacher.   Professor Chen (Chinese 2) is a very tough, but very fair and fun professor who makes the class rigorous and fast. You'll have to learn new vocab every day as well as have an assignment due.

UTAustin,39cv2r,hookemhorns2018,3,Wed Jun 10 22:24:58 2015 UTC,"I took graduate-level Urdu at Texas (I did my undergrad-level Urdu at a different university) and am familiar with all of the professors. When I started taking Urdu as an undergrad I had no prior experience in the language and started from scratch.   I never took any classes with Gautami so I can't speak to her teaching style, but Prof Hassan is a wonderful instructor and I enjoyed my Urdu class with her. She really breaks things down, is very patient with students who have little to no Urdu background, and I received an A in her course. If you stick with Urdu long enough you'll get to take classes with Akbar, who is an amazing instructor and has a real passion for teaching. He only teaches upper division courses though and some of the Flagship stuff, so you won't get him right away (but Prof Hassan is great too!). On the Hindi side, I don't know much about Gautami and Jishnu because they mostly teach lower division Urdu but if you stick with it long enough you can take classes with Rupert who is also an amazing instructor.   I definitely encourage you to take Urdu (or Hindi) at Texas. UT is one of the top universities (if not the best) in the country for both languages and you will definitely come out of the program with excellent language skills. When I started at UT for my graduate work, my Urdu skills were behind many of the undergrads in the program. Quite a few students start Urdu or Hindi without any prior experience at UT so you won't be alone and there are great resources for you to excel.   I'm happy to answer any other questions you may have."

UTAustin,396rrx,anieke56,4,Tue Jun 9 18:07:44 2015 UTC,"Some advice from a recent graduate:  Also, if you need to use a map, go for it. Honestly, no one gives a shit what you're doing anymore. Unless you make a complete ass out of yourself, everyone minds their own business.   What saved me multiple times is keeping a planner. I would take all my syllabuses after the first week, and spend about a hour writing all due dates and homework down. I never forgot anything and helped me do things in advance.  Which leads to my next point, as dumb and as much as you probably don't want to, if you can help it, DO STUFF IN ADVANCE. Even if it is one less thing to worry, it'll relieve your stress exponentially. Have a free thirty minutes? Start  some homework. You'll thank yourself later. I've had instances where shit pops off, and I was so thankful I already did my work.  Additionally, get to see how your professor acts. That'll determine how closely they hold the syllabus and well, the class in general. I've had tough syllabuses, but the professor was so laid back, I barely did work and did well. DISCLAIMER: This is just my experience, it'll vary.  And lastly, although they always tell you this, joins things on campus. You'll get so much more out of college. I never did any of that, and though I met a couple people, it would have made my experience at UT so much better and more personal."

It may seem confusing at first but once you learn it, it becomes second nature.  You can use this trip planner to help you plan your route: http://www.capmetro.org/planner/  Also, I highly recommend getting a bicycle.  Not only can you use it to get to/from campus, it is becoming a very popular mode of transportation in Austin.  There are growing numbers of bike lanes and trails around the city which you can use to get around.  Also, during the major festivals such as ACL and SXSW, bicycles are highly useful for getting around because traffic and parking is horrid.  Always use a U-Lock and beware of bike theft.  Keep bikes indoors at night and don't leave expensive bikes out and about for extended periods of time."

Still, here are a few things I wish I would have known before orientation:  Join the UT Professor Reviews Facebook page before registering for class. I found the posts there to be a lot more specific and up-to-date than the reviews on myedu, etc..  For the love of god, please do not take Microeconomics (ECO 304 K) here if it's part of your degree plan. Take it at ACC or Midland or anywhere - just not at UT Austin. It's just an unnecessarily difficult intro class, and it will most likely mess up your GPA if you are not an economics genius.  Remember that you can drop your FIG classes. My orientation academic advisor signed me up for ECO 304K, even though I made it clear that I wanted to take the course at a community college (I ended up with Hickenbottom, so double whammy). My advisor also made it seem like students weren't allowed to drop FIG classes. By the way, the only difference between dropping a FIG class and a non-FIG class is that by dropping a FIG class, no one can replace your spot once you drop the class.  Don't sweat it if you don't make any friends during orientation. I didn't have any friends going into UT (I'm from Houston, but all my friends went to out-of-state schools), so I tried really hard to put myself out there and socialize at orientation. I just ended up hanging out with people I didn't really click with at all which made me a bit nervous. However, I met really cool people through my dorm, study groups, and clubs once the school year actually began.  This next bit won't really be relevant until a few days before classes begin, but: for those who are receiving financial aid, but whose packages have still not been released, call the financial aid office. It may be because of a simple, yet easily overlooked issue, such as not registering for the number of hours you indicated you would on the CASH page. I had this issue at the beginning of this semester, and it was resolved within minutes with a phone call.   There are free planners in the newspaper vending machines during the first few weeks of school. They have plenty of space to write your daily plans in and have coupons for local restaurants and such, so you don't have to waste your money on buying your own planner.  Lastly, just for funzies:  For your UGS class, try to get Bonevac as a professor, especially if you like philosophy. That is, if he's still teaching UGS classes. I took his Ideas of the Twentieth Century UGS 303 course this year, and he was without a doubt, the most charismatic lecturer I have ever witnessed. He is extremely accommodating, and would often 86 topics from exams if enough students thought those topics were too difficult or unnecessary. Plus, he sings in a Baroque choir!"
UTAustin,396rrx,belloport,1 point,Wed Jun 10 06:33:35 2015 UTC,"I second the advice of a planner, but my more specific is to use something digital! Let it sync to your phone and computer and send you reminders and not get spilled on or lost or left somewhere. I LOVE the Google suite: email, calendar, tasks, docs/sheets/slides (all are shareable for group projects), drive, and all are synced from my Chrome to my phone. It's powerful with a little experience.   Figure out your email situation. I was at McCombs and we had whatever personal accounts, a McCombs email, and the UTmail one. Pick one and sync it all. Emails are important and you'll get a lot more than high school. I also recommend figuring out a sorting system and making sure all the important senders aren't getting trapped by spam.   Get familiar with the eBus. Free service Thurs-Saturday nights to downtown and it runs continuously. You'll probably use it at least once - and it's great even for just going downtown for dinner or a movie at Alamo without dealing with CapMetro's weirdness at night.   Check the service levels during non-standard times! This goes for dining facilities  on campus, bus schedules, and building access. They'll cut everything at the worst times: right around finals as campus winds down. The bus service level drop, dining halls close early, and buildings restrict access. Also, the dining halls get really restrictive in options at the end: pretty sure Kins had sandwiches, pizza, burgers, and a lame salad bar for the last 2 weeks when I was using dine in dollars."

UTAustin,39dqtp,dbzfanjake,4,Thu Jun 11 02:10:09 2015 UTC,"I'm dat good, but yeah, let me go over some things, so I guess you're a freshman. BTW, you can look up the final exam schedule online: it depends on when your class meets. So every class that meet 12-1 on Mondays will all have a final exam at the same time. This information is super important if planning a trip or something. For me, I think your schedule depends on the type of person you are. Like CH 301, UGS 303, and M408L will be big lectures. I would recommend paying attention in the M408L since thats calculus (I never did and it was hard to cram for the exams).  The UGS you can probably good off a little in/ skip the first 5 minutes to grab some food if you're dying. I would recommend to going to CVS right by campus to buy a shit ton of snacks and energy drinks to keep you going through this schedule. You could have bad luck and have 2 or 3 exams on the same day, but it's doable. It's possible to have 3 or 4 exams I guess, but I would say unlikely. I think CH 301 has like 4 midterms or something insane. The M408L will probably have 3 and a final, the UGS will probably have like 2. I'm just ballparking here/ going off my and my friends' experience with those classes. You get a 10 minute break, so you should be able to make it from one class to another, and since these are lectures, you'll be fine if you come in 5 or 10 minutes late. Most profs don't get mad if you show up late, as long as you show up and don't leave early. I say go for it. For your class locations, WEL is in the middle of campus and easy to get to from wherever. I'm guessing the ECJ is the engineering building off of Dean keeton, it's a quick walk to  your math class at RLM. Your walk to the last lecture GE might suck a little bit, but it's doable. Actually, for sure going to suck, but it's whatevs  Edit: You're fine for walking between them, if you have a lot of midterms, skip a couple or attend and just study for the midterm later in the day. Really, it's not that bad if you can handle sitting there and paying attention for five hours. I had 5 hours of lecture in a row last semester, and it was manageable. Holy shit this is a long comment. If you have any questions just reply. My writing is probably illegible"
UTAustin,39dqtp,dbzfanjake,3,Thu Jun 11 02:30:15 2015 UTC,"I am in fact an incoming freshman. Your comment was by far the most helpful thing I've read so far and insanely reassuring. Everyone at orientation just gave me the ""your schedule is whatever you want it to be. Go for whatever you want"" and never really gave me any solid advice. Most people were in awe like they had never even heard of so many classes at once. What a few OA's told me was that if I talk to the professor and let them know I have a back to back immediately after they don't mind students leaving a bit early to get to class on time. They said most hour classes finish after only 50 minutes to give everyone time to get to their next class if it's back-to-back. If I end up being able to pick something up on the way to class, do you think the professor would be fine with me eating it in class? Im sure they would since it's the lectures are going to be so large. Also as far as seating goes, since I'm not going to be one of the first ones there, I'm assuming I'm not going to get very good seating in many classes"
UTAustin,39dqtp,SordidCanary,5,Thu Jun 11 02:56:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah you can eat in class. Just don't bring something smelly/ loud/ annoying. Eat like some snacks. If you grab a burger from wendys or something, eat it outside and then go in. You probably won't miss much in those 5 minutes. Also, don't leave class early. Show up to class late. Leaving early looks worse IMO. And yeah, you can get a good spot if you show up late/ near class start time. Most classes have a decent amount of open spots for seating, and everyone does the awkward seating thing where they leave a space in between them and their neighbors. The courtesy gap. Just sit down wherever and screw that extra space. Also, some classes will have very few people in the front rows. You can walk up and sit down within the first 5 minutes of class. Some professors are annoyed when students do that, like walking all the way up to the front, and some don't care. I had a professor who used to just stop talking and stare at a student walking in late. The whole class would then stop and stare. Kind of a dick move in my mind, but if you have a big enough ball sack, own that shit.  My biggest advise is to go to your professor's office hours and make an effort to get to know your professors. Even in a big lecture, not that many people go to office hours, and even if the professor doesn't know your name, he'll recognize your face and be a lot more forgiving for you possibly showing up late. Seriously, go to office hours. You have nothing THF.  Edit: also there's a pizza stand/ a regular food/coffe stand nearby your math  class, and they sell some cheap pizza slices. I'm pretty sure i ate there like 3 times a week one semester because of how fast and close it was to my classes."
UTAustin,39dqtp,SordidCanary,1 point,Thu Jun 11 03:49:14 2015 UTC,"I got back from orientation today and this is the schedule I ended up with. I'm a Civil Engineering student and this is what my advisor suggested I do. She mentioned that because all my classes are blocked together I will have more time to do my out of class work since there aren't small hours between classes that would only be wasted due to not having enough time to get anything done.  First UGS 303 on M - SZB CH 301 - WEL Second UGS 303 on M - ART (same for UGS 303 on W) CE 301 - ECJ M 408L - RLM GE 206D - BUR  One of my concerns is that it might be too far to walk with everything being back to back and I would be late to all my classes. Another is that I don't get a lunch break on M or W so would that negatively affect my ability to do well in class if I'm continuously going for so long? Thirdly, when it comes time for mid-terms and finals, will I be stuck with 5 of them in one day?"
UTAustin,39dqtp,iH8ExtremeLiberals,2,Thu Jun 11 02:08:31 2015 UTC,Professor's let kids out with time to get between so if MyEDU says your class is from 10-11 then your professor will let you out at 10:50 7 minutes is enough to get most anywhere on campus (RLM ---> The liberal arts area is gonna be a hustle).

UTAustin,398zny,mrflarp,3,Wed Jun 10 17:12:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah. The UT discounted price for Windows is for upgrades only. The full price version is $119. The Office 2013 DVD is the full version (not an upgrade one).  You can still do a clean install from the upgrade media, and the software itself is no different than the full version. It just takes another little registry trick to enable activation using the upgrade key. Or, you can download the installation media direct from Microsoft (see /u/Lightens comment) and then use activation key from the one you bought from Campus Computer store."

It finished the rest of the install, but it just didn't activate the Windows license. I did the registry trick, rebooted, and then it worked.  Some of the more recent systems (within the last couple of years) now have the Windows key saved in the BIOS. If the Windows installer detects such a key, it never prompts you at all. It just goes right through (did this with my mom's new Dell desktop just this past winter)."

UTAustin,397cu9,fuzzywuzzypuppy,3,Tue Jun 9 19:58:10 2015 UTC,ME Thermo was pretty easy and also kinda fun. Mathews was good.
UTAustin,397cu9,xombie_owo,1 point,Tue Jun 9 23:38:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the ME thermo wasn't bad at all. I took it with a different professor than either of the ones you mentioned, but I don't recall it being very calculus intensive at all. Everything really builds upon previous material in the class, so as long as you keep up, it's no problem."
UTAustin,397cu9,DocProcter,2,Tue Jun 9 23:45:06 2015 UTC,"Chem e grad here:  Intro to chem e(aka 317) is pretty easy concept wise, but workload is huge. Both edison and contreras are good, with different styles. Edison is a math junkie, and likes to put non-intuitive math on his exams. However, if you go to his office hours TWICE a week, he will show favoritism to you.Contreras likes to overload you on homework, you have an assignment due every class. 3x a week. No calc needed, but if you don't know how to solve systems of equations you will have trouble  P-chem should be right in your wheelhouse. You don't need calc. Its sorta chemistry, sorta mathy. Knowing how to derive equations from the famous equations is helpful. Reading the book is helpful, they often show how to derive them, if you are stuck.  Thermo ME i have no experience with. But the chem E one I took was basically the same as p chem, with a little more detail. I'm guessing me thermo is about the same.  Good luck"
UTAustin,397cu9,PlayLikeNewbs,1 point,Sat Jun 13 16:57:34 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure how it works for non-degree seeking students, but your biggest worry might be getting into the thermodynamics class. ME 326 is a high-demand class since it's once of the first mandatory engineering classes ME majors have to take. I took it as an aerospace major seeking to transfer to mechanical the next semester, and I had to put my name on a list to be admitted if they had seats open after serving up all the mechanical students. Although, I did get in, so there may be hope. :)  Other than that, ME 326 isn't that bad. You'll focus mostly on whole systems, and the general picture of ""how is energy going in/out?,"" and you finish with thermodynamic cycles (Otto, Rankine, etc.). On the other hand, pchem 1 is more on the molecular scale, and you eventually study things like reaction kinetics.  You could take either class and cover the main topics of thermo, which are the three laws of thermodynamics. The rest you learn is just specific to the department under which the course is listed. I'd choose the class that would benefit you more in the long run, be it industry or grad school."

They weren't even nice bikes."

UTAustin,394dr4,ohPigly,4,Tue Jun 9 04:47:33 2015 UTC,It was when I lived up on 51st st east of 35. The neighborhood was a little worse than it is now.
UTAustin,394dr4,EJOtter,10,Tue Jun 9 15:49:16 2015 UTC,"On campus: hardly a problem. Lock your bike properly and you'll be fine. Especially if it's not great-looking and among a ton of other bikes.   Off-campus: you're better off keeping your bike in your apartment. I had mine locked on a bike rack around both tires and the frame, inside a gated apartment complex and it was still stolen. In the end, the locks are easy to cut through and if a thief wants your bike they WILL get it.  On that note, fuck bike thieves.  Oh and also: annual bike auction is soon! Look for signs around UT, probably can get a cheap bike."

UTAustin,394dr4,dbzfanjake,5,Tue Jun 9 07:29:31 2015 UTC,"Remember ...  The auction is made up of the bikes that UT impounded and weren't picked up by their owners.  UT will impound a bike that is parked very improperly (where it blocks a sidewalk, for example) but usually won't impound a bike otherwise until it's been sitting in the same place for months.  (I recall watching one specific bike deteriorating for just about a year.)  So, the bikes that are up for auction generally 1) have been sitting out in the elements for months, sometimes a year, 2) were in bad enough shape to begin with that their owner just abandoned them and didn't get them out of impound either, and 3) the bikes were so crappy that the thieves didn't steal them.  (That said, they might have taken parts.)  So ... the bikes up for auction are generally crap.  That said, sometimes there's some exceptions.  Looking at the pictures, this batch looks better than most."
UTAustin,394dr4,DocProcter,9,Tue Jun 9 15:56:01 2015 UTC,"If you lock it up outside, use a ulock and a chain. Ulock for front tire and fram, chain for the back tire. If you get a nicer bike, take it inside. The heat isn't great for your tires and the rain will make it rust. You should be fine though. I've been riding for 3 years, haven't had a problem. Locked one of my two bikes outside for two years, didn't have a problem."

I have some friends who have had their bikes stolen, but in every one of those instances, they only locked their front wheel to the rack. I feel like if you're careful about how/where you lock your bike, you should be fine (maybe not, but I haven't heard or experienced otherwise). Also, if you can bring your bike in at night, then I think you should."

On a related note, my great grandfather smoked like a chimney until he died at 95, so smoking isn't a problem."

UTAustin,394dr4,abhd,2,Tue Jun 9 06:32:09 2015 UTC,"I've never had my bikes stolen and I've lived here for 4 years.  One of my bikes is over 600$.    Tips to keep your bike safe: Keep them indoors at night.  Use a good quality U-lock and possibly a cable lock to secure the front wheel.  When out and about, lock your bike in visible areas, with high pedestrian traffic if possible.  Try not to leave your bike locked for extended periods of time.  A sub-200$ bike has a much less risk of being stolen than a 700$+ bike."
UTAustin,394dr4,longhornbicyclist,2,Tue Jun 9 15:52:35 2015 UTC,"In the annual report of the crimes reported to UTPD and APD around campus, they said that 54% of bikes from campus and west campus are stolen every year, so a pretty big problem.   As far as a cheap bike, I got both bikes I used in my time at UT from the Salvation Army for $40 and $60.Both we great and never had problems and only got a new one because I gave my old one to my brother when he started college."
UTAustin,394dr4,ImFromHereDamnit,2,Tue Jun 9 18:43:25 2015 UTC,I think that means that 54% of all the bikes stolen in the city of Austin were done so in Campus and West Campus.  I seriously doubt that 54% of all the bikes in W. Campus and Campus were stolen
UTAustin,391tvy,csvopro,3,Mon Jun 8 17:12:06 2015 UTC,"Here is the degree plan for a BS in CS. 312 is one semester, 311 and 314 are another, 429 is one, 439 is another, 331 is another. You can take 439 and 311 in one semester, but they heavily discourage it, although is may be easier if you've already taken their equivalents at UTSA (computer systems and algorithms, respectively). So that's 4-5 semesters for the main CS classes. Then you need 15 additional hours of upper division CS courses, and whatever other classes don't transfer.  And honestly, the department is understaffed and classes fill up quickly and are difficult to get into. It's definitely an uphill battle."
UTAustin,391tvy,olliegee,1 point,Mon Jun 8 19:52:50 2015 UTC,"Even more uphill, since you have to take 9 more hours of upper division from a list of classes.  All 8 classes require at least CS 429 too.    Is it possible to test out of the first few courses?  I learned to program in C and the classes are supposedly in Java"
UTAustin,391tvy,nicharesuk,2,Mon Jun 8 20:06:01 2015 UTC,"It is possible to test out of 312, the university offers a test to do that. (Hint it's what I did having no prior knowledge of Java, you should do this to save time and money)  edit: I meant to say, before studying for the test I had no prior knowledge of Java, it took me about 2 weeks of studying about 4 hours a day to get to the level to do the 312 Final that is on Mike Scott's Website."

UTAustin,391tvy,dmh2879,4,Tue Jun 9 06:35:18 2015 UTC,"I have a friend who got all of his basics done at a junior college and then graduated with a cs degree in five semesters. Don't worry too much about the classes being closed, its a common thing for the CS program to fill up classes really early, but later on, they'll open more up or move them into larger classrooms to accomadate more students."
UTAustin,391tvy,dmh2879,0,Mon Jun 8 17:32:24 2015 UTC,"That's pretty great to hear!  Graduating in five semesters would be perfect.

UTAustin,391tvy,dbzfanjake,1 point,Mon Jun 8 19:38:55 2015 UTC,"The electives are easier than 429 439 and 331 (generally the software weed out classes) and you would,have to get special permission to take more than two cs classes at a time (they have been restricting registration as of late). That said, 312 I AP'D out of so that cuts of one semester and I would talk to a counciler and see what else you can get to transfer"

They changed the sign-up policy, so you're guaranteed practically to get into 2 of the classes you need. I would say go for it. The UTCS degree is pretty damn good and will help with that first job for sure"
UTAustin,391tvy,famous_amos,2,Tue Jun 9 05:24:06 2015 UTC,It's worth it just for the increased career prospects you'll have from the UT career fair.

I had friends that were better than me in many ways and they got rejected. BUT, I wish you the best of luck and hope that you get in.  Having said that, I believe, but I am not sure, that having a US citizenship means that you will be treated as a US citizen. I am guessing that for a public school this means that you'll be considered as an out of state student. Make sure to contact the international office as they probably have better answers."
UTAustin,39247f,hookemhorn,1 point,Mon Jun 8 20:23:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I just looked at the UT sight and it is very fuzzy as to what is considered out of state vs. international. Honestly, I'm not sure which I would prefer."
UTAustin,39247f,famous_amos,1 point,Mon Jun 8 20:28:50 2015 UTC,"I was in a similar situation to you (went to an American High School in Greece, did Full IB).  I can't speak to entrance requirements at UT (did my undergrad elsewhere), but I can give you some advice on the tests and international background.  It'll be a little harder as an international student.  I had friends who got rejected from some schools for no reason, but got into better universities for the same program.  The US Citizenship doesn't really matter too much at this stage (more important for getting a job on or off campus).   You probably have some pluses from English being a first language (your essays will be better than most other international applicants) and knowing French.  Also, since English is your first language, you probably don't need to take the TOEFL.  If your High School speaks English, or awards you a diploma from an English speaking country, you definitely don't have to (I got the American HS diploma along with the Full IB and I didn't need to worry).  Might not be a bad idea to check in with your counselor about this though.  I don't recall anyone paying much attention to CAS but its not a bad thing to have volunteering experience (you can bring this up in the essays too).  Your SATs are looking pretty good,  idk if you really want to take them again, but take awhile to look up some scholarships related to SATs.  My school offered full instate tuition + housing assistance if you made above a 2250 super scored, so might be worthwhile doing some research.  The IB predicted scores will be very good if you get 6's all over.  A predicted 39 goes a long way.   I think your application will look pretty good, just keep at it!"
UTAustin,39247f,meatinyourmouth,1 point,Tue Jun 9 17:27:12 2015 UTC,"I am an international student coming from China. According to what I heard from my Chinese fellows, UT's admission really depends much on the school and department you apply for. Business school is extremely difficult to get in and engineering school is hard but not that competitive while School of Undergraduate Studies is the easiest. I am in College of Natural Science which is of the medium level of difficulty. If you'd like to major in Business or engineering, I suggest you put either of them in the first place in your application and UGS as the second place. You can always do internal transfer after you had finished one year in UT as long as your GPA  is good enough."
UTAustin,38vdq5,813684683,5,Sun Jun 7 03:47:29 2015 UTC,"The math department at UT has been traditionally academic, but there is a slight shift in this day and age. The focus in that department is on research and higher understanding, traditional the department has been focused on research and getting research grants and what not. There has been a slight shift as of late and that is the world of Big Data. A lot of professors/grad students in the math department are now finding that they are able to secure massive grants from Private institutions demanding higher degree of analytics, I had a professor who was approached by Facebook to spend a summer analyzing their data and find a more meaningful way of interpreting it. Some other professors at UT have also been approached by industry, another professor of mine was approached by a startup who was looking to develop an encoding algorithm in order to more efficiently compress pictures. In closing, its mostly focused on research, but the private sector is playing a bigger part than ever. That said, the private sector has probably gone from about 1-5% of their funding as of late, the bulk is still focused on academic publications."

UTAustin,38vdq5,PlayLikeNewbs,5,Sat Jun 13 20:50:48 2015 UTC,"I am an undergrad math major. I am aiming to work in industry. I got an internship this summer at a large tech company doing a mixture of business and math related projects. It's a little more business related than math related though. I know some math majors who want to be teachers and others who want to go to grad school for math. There are also actuarial majors in the math department who want to work in the insurance industry. Also a lot of students have become math majors because the CS department has become really selective and they still want to get programming jobs. You can basically either go the applied math route, the theory based route for grad school, or the math teacher route. I am not interested in going to grad school so I can't speak about research opportunities or anything like that but if you are looking to get an industry related job it is definitely possible. I would say the math department provides a good mixture of interests between teaching, industry, and being a mathematician.   EDIT: Although sometimes I feel like more of the math students are aiming to go to grad school and become mathematicians. The classes also tend to be more theory based."
UTAustin,38vdq5,TheVinylCountdownRK,3,Sun Jun 7 05:35:35 2015 UTC,"As someone who got their bachelors in pure math back in december, I have to say this was almost exactly my perception of things as well. The types of students really deppended on the path that they were taking as math majors. There are, obviously exceptions to the rule in every category, but from my experience, this is how I see math undergraduates at UT:  One path is actuarial sciences. I don't think I met a single person on this path that planned to go to grad school. It is a path for those that are good at math, and want to use that skill to make a lot of money. Actuaries are very well paid, and usually in high demand. Few people seek this path for the sake of academia.  Another path is scientific computation path, which is where people tend to go if they have aspirations of becoming statisticians or computer scientists. A few of these people wish to go on to do research in these fields, but for the most part, even those that seek grad school are career oriented, and less academically curious in the long run.   The teaching route, much like the scientific computation route, is made up mostly of people that do not plan to go into research. While I have met people that say they want to teach high shcool calculus for a few years before going on to become professors, I would say this plan of action is not as common.  Then there is applied math. This path seems to be pretty evenly split when it comes to those that plan to go on to do research compared to those that plan to seek jobs as soon as they get their bachelor's. There is also a good chunk of this path that is made up primarily of kids that know they want to major in math, but do not yet know where they would like to specialize.  Lastly there is the pure math kids. From what I saw, this is where most of those people that live and breathe math go. This path seemed to me to be mostly made up of people that wanted to go on to study math post-undergrad. This is where I saw the highest concentration of future-mathematicians. Only after switching to this path did I find myself surrounded by people that seemed more mathematically curious than myself."
UTAustin,38uqmy,FortTheLulz,3,Sun Jun 7 00:12:56 2015 UTC,"I highly recommend physics (at the very least E&M), strongly recommend calculus and then taking M408D, and as many of the non-major related classes as possible."

UTAustin,38uqmy,JeremyPriest,1 point,Sun Jun 7 15:16:14 2015 UTC,As many as you possibly can.  All the classes that you can get equivalent credit for through AP tests or whatever are going to be weed-out classes anyways (aka. lots of busywork).
UTAustin,38uqmy,mrflarp,-4,Sun Jun 7 02:09:11 2015 UTC,"Whichever classes you feel you have sufficiently mastered well enough to get credit for by exam?  I am struggling to understand the point of your question. Getting a credit by exam implies that to take the class would be a waste of time, because you already know it."
UTAustin,38qsaa,ejayshun,9,Sat Jun 6 00:53:29 2015 UTC,"Get out of physics as early as possible, you will not learn anything more than you will learn in your Engineering courses. (Particularly, you learn everything you need to know from PHY 303L in EE 302)  You won't be doing much higher level programming in your Freshman courses, instead you'll be working really low level with registers and the like. So if you've never done programming before, don't worry, a lot of people will be in the same boat as you because most people don't study the low level stuff in high school.   Calculus, if you're good at it and on the ball, can be a GPA boost. Calculus was a wake up call for me personally and I had to work a lot harder than I had ever before to get an A.  Start reading the textbooks for EE 302 and EE 306 over the summer to get a handle on what you'll be learning. Even with preparation these classes will still be a bit difficult because it's going to be your first time in a true college setting (I assume you're coming out of high school; even if you did dual credit a community college is nothing compared to UT)  And if you really want to do some higher level programming, start learning about C and C++, that is mainly what you will be working with as an ECE major. There is a wealth of resources online for these just google the books that are the best. But keep in mind you won't be doing a lot with these your first semester."
UTAustin,38qsaa,nicharesuk,1 point,Sat Jun 6 01:40:54 2015 UTC,I am also an incoming ECE major. Should I take my CALC BC AP credit or am I missing too much in the college courses and will lack fundamentals later on?
UTAustin,38qsaa,Cheddarz_,2,Sat Jun 6 04:19:58 2015 UTC,"Most people I meet take 408D and then DiffEq, and have been fine. 408C is Differentials and Integrals so if you got a 4 or 5 I think you'll be fine to skip it. But 408D touches on topics not covered on the AP test and personally I'd recommend it. DiffEq is definitely not something you want to be your first math course at UT, very time consuming and difficult."

UTAustin,38qsaa,javaman1025,1 point,Sat Jun 6 06:11:02 2015 UTC,More than likely summer bridge will offer 408K; the first class in the 3 step sequence. Definitely a viable approach to take the free 408k then continue into fall with 408L then spring 408m. It's a slower approach but an option (instead of doing 408C+408D you could do 408K+L+M)

UTAustin,38herq,ut15uf08,18,Thu Jun 4 05:52:25 2015 UTC,Since it connects into the 2nd floor of Belo I seriously doubt the efficacy of this pedestrian bridge at reducing ground-level street crossings. No one wants to go inside a building just to cross the street when it only takes a minute (at most) to wait on the light to change at the Dean Keeton + Whitis intersection.
UTAustin,38herq,shiruken,10,Thu Jun 4 13:56:10 2015 UTC,It connects two communications buildings so I imagine it is targeting their students much like the pedestrian bridge between UTC and the Business school at 21st.
UTAustin,38herq,iamevilbear,9,Thu Jun 4 14:17:34 2015 UTC,"True, but how many students really pass between those two buildings regularly? It seems like if they're using the argument for reducing ground-level road crossings they should consider bridges across Guadalupe. If it's really just meant to connect the communications buildings then just say that."
UTAustin,38herq,shiruken,3,Thu Jun 4 16:11:32 2015 UTC,"In November, I agree. In August when it is 108 in the shade, I am totally willing to go through A/C to avoid standing in the sun for a minute. I don't think it is any more work than the UTC-McCombs bridge and that gets a fair amount of use."

UTAustin,38herq,eseb1,3,Thu Jun 4 15:21:39 2015 UTC,Given the bus/truck traffic on Guad a tunnel might be a better option than a bridge. It'd be great to eliminate the chaotic crossing in front of the Co-op with a tunnel.

UTAustin,38euby,hankhillforprez,3,Thu Jun 4 04:31:27 2015 UTC,"Are you kidding me?  Sure Taco Cabana isn't the most legit place ever but they actually sell things like fajitas, barbacoa, brisket tacos, enchiladas, street tacos, real breakfast tacos (not that waffle abomination that Taco Bell has), they actually make fresh salsa and tortillas in store everyday, and they're based in and originated from San Antonio, Texas.    Taco Bell, on the other hand, serves ""meat"" and ""cheese"" sauce that literally comes out of a caulking gun, distributes what is basically tabasco sauce in ketchup packets, concocts monstrosities like the doritos locos ""taco"", and (to your ""corporate"" point) is a subsidiary of Yum! Brands, which also owns Pizza Hut and KFC.  Compared to Taco Bell and Yum! Brands, Taco Cabana is practically mom and pop.  Sure, Taco Cabana may not be the best, but it's actually Tex-Mex."

UTAustin,38f43i,amandasinfinity,1 point,Wed Jun 3 20:14:04 2015 UTC,"Hey there,  I studied abroad in Tokyo, Japan for a year to knock out a good portion of my Asian Studies major. Every country and situation will be different, but here are a few things you should think about regardless before you study abroad:  The exchange rate was not in my favor when I first arrived, so combined with one of the highest costs of living in the world, it was a very expensive endeavor. Stack the dollar up with whatever currency you'd be using (Euro?) and keep your eye on it over the summer. Losing some money due to conversion is to be expected, but I had not anticipated the $300-400 loss each time I transferred my funds. This also brings into question what to do about banking. I used Citi because my main bank (Bank of America) was not in Japan, so I had to open a Citi account in America AND Japan, transfer funds to Citi America from BoA, THEN transfer that into Citi Japan. It could all be done online though, so it made the process a bit more bearable. Personally, I feel like because I took additional courses required by the major such as culture and literature studies outside of my language courses, I got the most bang for my buck. It may not be worth it to you to just go abroad to get credit for 2 classes. IIRC, UT had me take at least 12 hours regardless while many of my friends from other universities had more flexible schedules and only had to take the language classes, so they went off and did a lot more sightseeing than I did because I had a full plate of courses every semester. The coursework in my case was pretty brutal, but that's because I took intensive Japanese courses on top of culture courses--but you probably won't have to worry so much about this because you are not majoring in your language. Still, it is important to remind yourself that you are STUDYING abroad. It's okay to have fun and immerse yourself in the culture and language, but ultimately at the end of the day, you are responsible for bringing home the grades that make the credit happen.  Do some research into your living options and what accommodations they have. I got extremely lucky and ended up moving into a brand new dormitory with my own toilet/sink, but I had to sign up for a cellphone and internet service on my own and it was not easy. You also should look into transportation options to get you to and from the school--for me, it was buying 6 month student train passes.  What previous experience do you have with the language(s)? I've never been to Europe before so I can't say how much access to English you have to fall back on, but in Japan, it had a lot less English than one might expect. For me, it was a good thing so that I could force myself to practice the language functionally, but I had also taken Japanese for five years prior to studying abroad, so when I arrived I was prepared to at least go about my daily life. Should you go, I would encourage you to study the language a bit beforehand not only as a safety net if there is not as much English, but also because you will pick up the language faster and it could earn you some respect from the locals, who may be more willing to help you seeing you make an effort to adapt.  On the medical side of things, UT had me enroll in an insurance program as well as the university I attended, but it was on the cheaper end. I got very ill around the New Year’s holiday and had to go to the hospital, but I got all of my medications for about $40 while the visit itself was covered by insurance. Way better than all the money I have to shell out here in the States. Additionally, I have food allergies, which sometimes complicated my diet situation the further I went outside of the big city.  Ultimately, there are a lot of factors that go into the decision to study abroad. With all that being said, study abroad really changed my life. My journey was almost 3 years ago and I often find myself looking back on it fondly. I met so many amazing friends from so many different parts of the world. I became fluent in my chosen language and learned a lot from living in a new society– so much more than I could have in a college classroom. And, in a big way, I took a huge step toward becoming an independent adult by having to manage things my parents had once been responsible for on my behalf, such as insurance and monthly payments. That was the single best year of my life and I cannot imagine having lived without it.   Make your decision based upon your personal situation (financially, physically/emotionally, etc), but if my wall of text hasn’t already spoken for me, I would highly urge you to consider studying abroad. If you have any other questions, please feel free to reach out to me."
UTAustin,38f2hw,knightsd,1 point,Wed Jun 3 20:05:00 2015 UTC,"You are only allotted financial aid for one institution per academic year. So for example, if I received financial aid for Fall and Spring at UT, then I am unable to receive financial aid for a different community college during the summer. Unfortunately, you'll most likely have to pay out of pocket but most community colleges are ridiculously cheap (I'm taking 6 hours for $512 at austin community college) and even smaller non-community colleges have relatively cheap tuition as well."
UTAustin,38f2hw,amandasinfinity,1 point,Wed Jun 3 20:18:18 2015 UTC,"Pretty much this. The only thing that's not 100% accurate is that you can receive aid from two different institutions in an academic year. Transfer students come in all the time in the spring semester from other places and still get aid.  It's not necessarily going to affect your financial aid at UT Austin negatively, but the likelihood of a community college giving you financial aid for summer courses is probably slim. Generally, you can only get aid from the place you're going to get your degree from.   Good on you, though, for taking community college classes. It's a really cost-effective way to get a lot of the core classes out of the way. Sometimes students even save their financial aid from the fall and spring to use towards summer classes, even though they're not taking the classes at UT."
UTAustin,38f2hw,belloport,1 point,Wed Jun 3 23:37:29 2015 UTC,"That's interesting, that would make a lot of sense. I mean if you're just taking a credit at another college but aren't transferring to be a student at that college full time, you most likely won't be able to receive financial aid for it. I highly recommend getting core credits out of the way through community college if you can, it'll save you a lot of money, stress and your UT GPA lol."
UTAustin,38ffiv,_Walpurgisyacht_,4,Wed Jun 3 21:21:47 2015 UTC,"I would suggest you take 408C even if you can get credit. It should be a GPA boost for your first semester, and will make the transition to 408D smoother. As for physics, you should try and get out of as much as you can at UT. They aren't really important at all to the major and many people suggest taking them at community college if you can't exempt them at UT. Hope this helps."

I met a few people who I continued to see throughout campus but never actually said a word to again.

As for the books themselves...  The Bell Jar is one of my all-time favorite books, and I'd highly recommend it if you've ever struggled with depression. It's short and a pretty easy read, too, despite the subject matter. I've heard good things about Blindness, but I hated the writing style and actually had to quit halfway through because I found it so difficult to read. (It had an interesting premise, though, so I was sad to put it down! I might give it another try sometime.)  Oryx and Crake is pretty good! It's not my favorite book by Atwood, but it's pretty accessible and interesting if you're into sci fi. I thought Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking was a bit circle jerk-y, but might be a good choice if you consider yourself an introvert. And while I haven't read it personally, I've had friends tell me White Noise is interesting."

UTAustin,38arey,unoriginalloser,2,Wed Jun 3 04:25:01 2015 UTC,"Mycampusnet is a an internet access service usually provided by apartment complexes in West Campus.   There's usually a wireless access point and a couple of Ethernet ports per apartment. Each apartment is given an account to access the internet this way.   The # of devices one can use is usually limited to 5, hence the devices' Unique identifiers called Media Access Control Addresses [MAC] (each network access device like your iPhone has ONE) needs to be added to the account before that particular device can access the internet. OP doesn't want to deal with the hassle of adding all his/her devices MAC addresses so he/she is only adding a wireless router or his/her own.   This personal router will have ONE MAC address that needs to be added to the account. OP will then connect to the router via his/her other devices.   The router (as designed) will function as a bridge between the ""mycampusnet"" network and the wifi network set up by OP through the router, effectively sharing the internet connection.   Consequently OP can bypass the device limit as there's only ""one"" MAC address connected to his/her mycampusnet account, yet there can be multiple on his/her private network created through the router."

UTAustin,3896lm,kayre1,1 point,Tue Jun 2 18:41:32 2015 UTC,"Hey, I just applied to UT for ChemE as a transfer student from ACC, so I might be able to give some insights.    How hard is it to transfer into EE?   It depends - there isn't a real definite answer here. One thing to consider in general is that when you apply to Cockrell your application is weighed against everyone else in the applicant pool and a decision is made from there. From what I've heard it's less competitive than Petrol/Biomed/ChemE, but I also think EE gets a lot of crossover from CS which may make things more competitive.    Would it be better to apply as a spring 2016 or a fall 2016 transfer? Would transferring for the spring semester be easier since I won't be competing with incoming freshmen???    That would be nice, but you can ONLY apply to Cockrell for Summer/Fall, with the application deadline being March 1st.     Would being a hispanic female be a factor in admissions?   You will be checking different boxes, but how that's weighted is unknown to me.   I had a great experience at ACC, there are some extremely talented and dedicated instructors there. One final piece of advice would be to spend a lot of time on your application, make it kick ass, which definitely means start on it early. Good luck with transferring!"
UTAustin,3896lm,14Gigaparsecs,1 point,Wed Jun 3 04:57:42 2015 UTC,Keep in mind that even with CAP you're still considered an External Transfer (except with liberal arts) as with applying from a community college (where you can also qualify for Automatic Transfer Admission to the university itself just like CAP if you graduate in the top 10% of your High School Class)
UTAustin,3896lm,arod356,1 point,Wed Jun 3 20:03:19 2015 UTC,"I can't really help you with the transfer part, but I'm curious why you are already planning on transferring since you are in high school. If it is for financial reasons then I understand. Getting your basics done at a cheaper school is a great way to avoid some debt.   Other than that though, keep in mind that UT has a CAP program that would make transferring significantly easier. You can spend your first year at a different UT school and then transfer into UT Austin."

Now I am a math major and getting a certificate in computer science and also a certificate in business. Math is actually really open and all you have to do is walk in, say you what to switch and they will put you in the major. You can still get programming jobs with a math degree, you will just have to learn languages and do projects on your own instead of in class. Or do the computer science certificate to learn more. If that's not your thing there are still other opportunities in natural sciences or liberal arts. You might even have other options. I would recommend talking to a natural sciences advisor.

UTAustin,386w36,iliveintexas,1 point,Wed Jun 3 16:52:30 2015 UTC,Depends on your classes. I've seen profs drop students who don't show up the first week. You may want to check syllabuses to see if there are any limits.

UTAustin,380536,ceanders,14,Sun May 31 21:33:23 2015 UTC,"CHL holder here and I work at UT. I don't believe this provides any benefit and I just don't understand why there was a huge push for this bill. Let me shed light on some of the types of people carrying concealed guns.  When I took the class, the majority of the people under 30 seemed to have this weird ""wanna-be hero"" mentality. It was pretty alarming. Among the MANY examples I have there was this one guy, 22 yrs old and recent A&M grad (I asked him after the class) who was asking the craziest questions. He asked the instructor things like  ""So if I have a female friend and I know or see that her boyfriend is abusing her, can I legally intervene?""  And ""Even though it's not my house, if I saw someone walking around at night around my neighbors house, could I legally defend his house?"" The tona!e and the way he phrased the questions made it seem like he was looking for justification and not so much asking about the law.  At one point, the instructor showed us a video of what appeared to be a kidnapping outside of a shopping mall. The surveillance videos showed a female walking from the parking lot to the mall entrance, then a van pulls up. A man and small woman hop out and force the female into the van, then take off. After we watched this, the instructor went around and asked what we would do in that situation. Literally half of the people responded with something like ""I would run up and shoot their tires out"", ""I would step in and stand my ground"" (dude you're not in Florida..), and sure enough aggie guy said ""I would defend her life as if it were mine"" (so you'd shoot them?). The instructor was trying to make a point since it turns out that the kidnapped woman was actually a teenager that had run away from home and was supposedly about to run off with some guy across the country. The abductors were her father and sister trying to take her home (in their own way I guess). Nobody would have been justified interveneing with their gun and nobody knew the situation.   Everyone got their liscense that day except for a really old man who failed at the shooting range, he couldn't control his shaking hands.   I honestly believe a LOT of CHL holders are waiting for something to happen. They just want an excuse to ""exercise their right"" when sometimes it isn't. Imagine a gunman on campus somewhere and a young chl holder decides to pull his gun out, now imagine aggie guy sees him as he scurries away for cover or something.

UTAustin,380536,BurrDurrMurrDurr,-5,Mon Jun 1 19:15:56 2015 UTC,Exactly. What also alarms me is that statistically UT has more undergrads than grad students. Statistically the people carrying concealed will be undergrads in the 18-23 year range. Would I trust an 18 year old to carry concealed and to be able to defend me with it? Not really... I would trust someone older and with military/police training instead. I worry about the amount of experience the people carrying concealed will have. With the presence of firearms on campus I also worry about the possibilities of negligent discharges.
UTAustin,380536,SC275,9,Mon Jun 1 23:17:21 2015 UTC,"Well thankfully you have to be 21 to get a CHL. So we're mostly looking at seniors, juniors, and grad students. Anyhow, that's still a lot of potential holders."
UTAustin,380536,BurrDurrMurrDurr,9,Tue Jun 2 00:07:23 2015 UTC,You just don't know anything about the situation at all. You legally cannot possess a handgun unless you are 21 or older.
UTAustin,380536,Demonoid_,2,Mon Jun 1 23:25:11 2015 UTC,I stand corrected the age is 21. My other points still remain valid however.
UTAustin,380536,SC275,14,Mon Jun 1 23:29:07 2015 UTC,I fail to see why a licensed CHL holder should be prohibited from carrying on campus. There is not some magical boundary where violent crime stops as soon as you step on campus.
UTAustin,380536,Leroytankin,30,Mon Jun 1 01:42:03 2015 UTC,"The primary contention to this bill is if there is an emergency like an active shooter on campus, having students with concealed hand guns around can potentially impede the ability of UTPD to contain the situation. It would likely be easier for UTPD to operate in such a scenario knowing the only ones armed are the assailant(s) causing the threat."
UTAustin,380536,ThinkinFlicka,19,Mon Jun 1 01:51:08 2015 UTC,"You bring up a good point, but I could also argue that one or two CHL holders could potentially neutralize the threat before UTPD arrives on scene. UTPD might only have 4-5 officers on duty at a given time. Also, this type of confusion with law enforcement could extend off campus as well. Should concealed carry be banned elsewhere too?  Edit: I also wanted to add that even with a fast police response an active shooter could quickly kill dozens of people. I'd personally rather take my chances being armed rather than hiding under my desk waiting my turn to be shot."
UTAustin,380536,Leroytankin,15,Mon Jun 1 01:57:21 2015 UTC,Problem is should they be able to neutralize the threat. The police would supposedly have training for such situations and it just seems like a single person handling the situation may not be able to properly assess it. It could be construed as being a vigilante. I don't even want to imagine the shit show if there civilian casualties.
UTAustin,380536,omnicious,2,Mon Jun 1 02:05:29 2015 UTC,"No matter how well trained, the police can not be everywhere at once. Even if you assume a quick police response (such as 3 minutes in Virginia Tech) a determined active shooter will wreak havoc if unopposed."
UTAustin,380536,Leroytankin,19,Mon Jun 1 02:16:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah but an untrained armed intervention, even with the best of intentions, could end up making things only worse for when the cops finally do arrive."
UTAustin,380536,omnicious,1 point,Mon Jun 1 03:21:39 2015 UTC,"When you say untrained in reference to CHL holders, are you talking about tactically trained or general gun training?"

There's a pretty good amount of training and instruction that goes into a CHL, in terms of gun safety. I don't know how much tactical, if any, training there is."
UTAustin,380536,brandnamed,3,Mon Jun 1 22:10:07 2015 UTC,A pro-gun group in Dallas tried some mock scenarios and ended up proving you wrong.
UTAustin,380536,metrion,9,Mon Jun 1 02:44:07 2015 UTC,"Mock scenarios are controlled. If I'm in a mock scenario I know what is coming. (Plus, I wouldn't trust a biased group like pro-gun groups to hold mock scenarios in a controlled environment. Would need an unbiased partisan group that didn't have an agenda or it's bullshit) If I'm in a class, and there are 5 other people carrying in the room alone, and another 40 outside, and I run out and everyone has a fucking gun, there is going to be people hurt that were just trying to be a hero or ""doing the right thing"". The Law is fucking dumb, and it should be up to the Campus president to ban firearms. Worse, Private campuses can't even ban them. It's the ""small government"" in Texas only being small when it's the laws it wants."
UTAustin,380536,Drayzen,2,Mon Jun 1 13:19:26 2015 UTC,"Exactly. I was referring to /u/Leroytankin's argument about CHL holders neutralizing the threat before UTPD got there. I linked to the mock scenario because even in a controlled situation put on by a pro-gun group, which was likely trying to show that it's better to have armed citizens in such a situation, the only person with a gun who survived was the one that didn't try to play hero but ran instead. What's even more ridiculous about that exercise was that after seeing that 11/12 of them still ended up dead, they said they wouldn't have done anything differently.  As for banning private campuses from banning gun bans, can you really expect less when the governor banned towns from creating fracking bans? Since private schools tend to be religiously affiliated, maybe they should try to uphold gun bans using religious freedom laws."

He said to close one eye, fully extend your arm, and cover something across the room with your thumb. Now switch eyes.  If a person is not fully or completely trained, this discrepancy could mean that more innocent people will get hurt. I personally would much rather have one shooter than several."
UTAustin,380536,t-rextophat,-1,Mon Jun 1 13:29:43 2015 UTC,"And I would like to argue the point that CHL owners are not trained professionals who receive more than 6 hours of training (Who the fuck thought 6 hours was enough to let someone carry a gun in public, and act like they can solve anything with it? Shit man, people go to the Middle East after months of training and still undergo PTSD after live combat actions, and encounter extreme anxiety during firefights, but 6 hours will be enough, RITE GUISE?). Furthermore, if a situation does develop and bystanders are hurt by CHL holders, they have no legal recourse to actually recover losses if they are shot. However, if UTPD or Austin PD shoots you, you can damn well go after them for medical bills, losses, etc.   At most, all this does is turn campuses and texas in general into a cold war scenario. Everyone is too scared to pull out their gun and do something due to the fact that everyone else has guns. Arming everyone isn't the solution to solving problems. Furthermore, Republicans will tout this as a reason for more open gun laws because there wasn't a shooting, because Politics are dumb and people are ignorant."
UTAustin,380536,Drayzen,3,Mon Jun 1 13:15:40 2015 UTC,"The primary contention to this bill is if there is an emergency like an active shooter on campus, having students with concealed hand guns around can potentially impede the ability of UTPD to contain the situation.   This same argument could be applied to a mass shooting anywhere, on campus or not.  So far no concealed carriers have been shot by police nor have the situations been made worse by their presence.  A very similar question was asked by the senators during committee testimony and one of the sheriffs said that when they have happened upon a situation of an aggressor and an armed CHL ""good guy"", the person with the CHL was always very compliant, put the weapon down when the police showed up, and was as non-threatening as possible.  He didn't have concerns that they would be able to distinguish the mass shooter from a person with a CHL"

Whitman committed mass murder on August 1, 1966.  In the early morning hours of August 1, Whitman murdered his wife and mother in their homes. Later that day, he brought a number of guns, including rifles, a shotgun, and handguns, to the campus of the University of Texas at Austin where, over an approximate 90 to 95 minute period, he killed 16 people and wounded 32 others in a mass shooting in and around the Tower. Whitman shot and killed three people inside the university's tower and eleven others after firing at random from the 28th-floor observation deck of the Main Building.

If you feel that you NEED to retake it because your calculus skills are weak(or whatever credit you'll be taking) that's another matter. But if you don't really need to take it then what taking the course again is going to do is just stress you out over stuff that you already know. You'll still have to do homework, go to class, take tests, etc.   I'm an upperclass physics major and if I could redo things from the start, I would have gotten as much credit as I possibly could have through AP exams and by testing out.   You think it's going to be less stressful to take these classes, but I think it's going to be loads less stress to take like 12 hours and just do really really well in learning that material. Also, you'd think that each class would perfectly build upon the last and the departments would be in sync that way but in reality they aren't. I can't think of a physics class I've taken that didn't spend SOME time going over prerequisite knowledge at the beginning(engineering might be different of course).  On the other hand, it tends to be the case that you should take your major specific courses again if you do have credit for those. For instance, most physics majors just start at Phy 301 even if they have Ap credit. I'm pretty sure it's the same deal for engineering."
UTAustin,381dzq,emalen,2,Mon Jun 1 05:28:54 2015 UTC,"Thanks for such a thorough answer! I think I'm leaning towards what all of you (and my parents) are saying, since taking less classes should let me spend more time on each class."

I'm talking core classes, like econ/English/fine arts/etc. Because those are basically one and done classes for the most part and won't lead into something more detailed.  Science/math classes might be a bit trickier because each class leads into the next in some way, shape, or form. Dual credit/AP classes don't translate very well into UT classes (from personal experience). They definitely help, but won't act as a complete substitute for taking the actual class with a college-level professor, and having all of your peers at your disposal."

This solves a problem that doesn't exist, for the sake of these politicians getting a pat on the back from the NRA. This will not result in citizen heroes, just professors and students feeling unsafe in a classroom of all places.   Each school would have to justify gun-free zones in a report due at the Legislature before each session begins.   That would be a really short report: ""Why the fuck would you want stressed, exhausted, stupid, and frustrated college students bringing guns to class?"""

I couldn't disagree with you more on this one, and I'll try to respond in a way that doesn't end in ""Lol."" Many people have bad tempers that cause them to do things in a moment they normally wouldn't; this is why there are ""cooling periods"" laws for gun acquisition in many places. Under the heavy stress especially of spring semester office meetings, adding anything like this is completely reckless and adds no sort of reasonable ""freedom"" that pepper spray and the like doesn't already. This adds nothing of value and erodes security and relations between members of the community."

This argument only works if they don't already own some type of gun.  But here in TX, its more likely than not that they already do own a firearm.   Under the heavy stress especially of spring semester office meetings, adding anything like this is completely reckless and adds no sort of reasonable ""freedom"" that pepper spray and the like doesn't already.    CHL holders carry in stressful situations every hour of every day and they manage to keep themselves together.  Why does everyone act like campus is some sort of high-stress environment completely unique to outside society?  Pepper spray has several deficiencies in comparison to a handgun - not the least of which is the ability to engage a target at some distance.  People who are under the influence of certain drugs or who have had some training can actually be completely unhindered by pepper spray.  Finally your average CHL person has training on how to engage threats (if they must do so) that your average pepper sprayer does not - for example:  how not to hit innocent bystanders"

If that server is bandwidth-intensive, you'll eat through your weekly transfer cap that much faster though.  There is a policy somewhere (don't recall where) that says you can't sell services though. For example, you can't set up a private gaming server connected on the UT network and then charge people to use it. Or set up a web server in your dorm room, and then charge people to host their sites on it. There was a former student that got busted for this a few years ago by setting up a Paypal link for people to ""donate"" so he could buy more storage for a private file-sharing network."
UTAustin,37vxbw,mrflarp,5,Sun May 31 16:23:54 2015 UTC,Here's what UT itself has to say about the matter.
UTAustin,37vxbw,dougmc,1 point,Sat May 30 21:57:45 2015 UTC,"There are pretty much no technical restrictions. There is policy saying you aren't supposed to do anything illegal, but UT doesn't actually prevent you from doing so. So, anything you want to run or any service you want to access is allowed (Facebook, Netflix, Youtube, Spotify, iCloud, Bittorrent, Tor, etc.). However, if your activity does result in a DMCA notice, UT will just forward it on to you (like any other ISP), and you'll be responsible for dealing with that. UT will not provide you with cover from copyright owners or law enforcement for any illegal activities you might do.  The only other real limitation is your transfer cap, which can vary depending on what tier of service you opt for. The default is 1GB/wk (no charge), and it goes up to 500GB/wk for $8 for an entire semester. After you hit your weekly cap, you get throttled down to 256Kbps, but you can stay online at that speed indefinitely.  As for the throttling, UT doesn't throttle any application or service in particular. If you haven't exceeded your transfer cap, everything will run as fast as your connection will allow (varies, depending on WiFi connection quality, overall network saturation, etc.). Once you exceed your cap, everything similarly will get rate limited to 256K. It doesn't matter if it's accessing Wikipedia, Canvas, Facebook, Netflix, Bittorrent, or anything else. Either none of it is rate limited (ie. when you haven't exceeded your cap) or everything is equally."

UTAustin,37gbgj,cheese93007,9,Wed May 27 12:35:04 2015 UTC,"The funny thing is that even when this passes it won't change much. The whole point of concealed carry is you don't know who has a gun unless shit goes down and you need to defend yourself. Students with CC permits will not just be running around campus shooting their guns all the time. Things will go on and the world will keep turning just like it always does.  But unfortunately, most UT students are indoctrinated to only think as far as ""Guns=Bad"".  Maybe it's not as simple as that."

A lot of evidence suggests concealed carry is MORE LIKELY to make conflicts escalate. While you may not agree with the evidence, don't pretend that the other side of the debate lacks any merit.  A few studies and articles to back this up -  Drivers who carry guns are 44% more likely than unarmed drivers to make obscene gestures at other motorists, and 77% more likely to follow them aggressively.  A gun in the home is 7x more likely to be used to murder/assault someone than it is to be used for self defense, 11x more likely to be used for suicide, and 4x as likely discharged on accident  A person assaulted while carrying a gun is 4x more likely to be killed  Concealed carry has little effect on crime rates except to increase the proportion of shootings  [UPDATE: NOT ENTIRELY TRUE] Mass shootings stopped by armed civilians in the past 30 years: 0"

In general though, Blair said, fewer people were killed or injured in the events that ended before police showed up at the scene -- either because civilians took action, or because the shooter spontaneously stopped or committed suicide.   The article says the data is inconclusive... so how does it address the point at hand?"
UTAustin,37gbgj,GGTX,1 point,Mon Jun 1 16:43:47 2015 UTC,"The case that concealed carry prevents/reduces mass shootings is not backed up by any real numbers and is entirely anecdotal- and there are fewer anicdotes I can find about CHL holders preventing mass shooting than there are about CHL holders COMMITING mass shootings. (And the vast majority of these concealed carry hero cases are off-duty cops, who in most states can conceal carry even before the whole CHL thing).  My original point is that the pro-gun set makes bullshit claims about the value of guns, and then goes on to pretend that liberal opposition is founded on a general fear of guns that ignores all evidence. The point is that that's crap."
UTAustin,37gbgj,fharion,5,Mon Jun 1 18:04:12 2015 UTC,"Mass shootings stopped by armed civilians in the past 30 years: 0[5]   Apart from that being completely false anyway, it's already a paradox. If a CC/CHL permit holder takes down a shooter before they kill a bunch of people, it's not a mass shooting. Because it was prevented from becoming one.  Not to mention CHL holders are statistically much more law-abiding than non-CHL permit holders.  Sorry, the idea that campus will suddenly turn into one big warzone if CC/CHL holders are allowed to carry concealed on campus is just plain false."
UTAustin,37gbgj,justduck01,-5,Thu May 28 22:32:25 2015 UTC,"Come on, guy, I never said campus would become a warzone. I just said CHL permits make one more likely to get violet. Admittedly, the person a CHL holder is most likely to shoot is themselves, but in the high-stress environment of a Campus, UTPD, the Dean's office and the Provost all agree that guns do more to harm the campus climate than they do to help. What do you know that they don't?  And your comment about CHL carriers being law abiding - your source is some guy on Reddit interpreting a crime report? Such Investigation. It's not a question of whether the folks who would get a CHL are more law abiding than the folks who wouldn't, it's a question of whether a CHL enables/increases violence for the same person vs not having one, and whether CHLs have any effect on decreasing crime.  As for mass shootings: did you read your own article? 7/9 of those were stopped by off-duty cops or military. People who I agree should be allowed to carry, because they've had much more training than the goddamn joke that passes for CHL classes. And if CHL holders in aggregate get credit for stopping 10 shootings, do they also get credit for the 772 murders they've committed?  http://www.vpc.org/press/1502ccw.htm How about the mass shooting committed by CHL holders? Maybe those folks would have had guns without a CHL, but one can't dismiss the effect of normalizing carrying of firearms EVERYWHERE.   PS way to refute the weakest point and ignore the others!"
UTAustin,37gbgj,fharion,2,Fri May 29 14:15:47 2015 UTC,"Do you realize that to get a CHL you have to pass a criminal records check?  Therefore it is a fact that CHL holders are more law abiding.  Convicted felons are the group of people who are most likely to commit a violent crime, and they cannot get a CHL.  Yes, some of these licensees commit crimes, but at a notoriously lower rate than the rest of the population.

UTAustin,37gbgj,TEOTAUY,1 point,Sun May 31 21:22:22 2015 UTC,"That's exactly my point. You can't say that CHL holders commiting less crimes vs general population is a defense because the people who get a CHL are not a representative sample of the general population.  Good luck finding disinterested sources on this matter. At least mine is from an org and not from some guy named diablo on reddit. I also went as far as to critique the method behind his idea, whereas you seem to be just dismissing it. And yes, I'm aware of the background check. It's amazing to me that this is this is basically the only requirement for carrying - no mental health or competence evaluations. There's also good evidence that people slip through CHL systems (of course you wouldn't accept the source, so what's the point?).  God, this subreddit really doesn't like dissenting arguments, and you CHL folks have a lot of practice defending yourself without any substance."

UTAustin,37gbgj,fharion,2,Mon Jun 1 16:34:24 2015 UTC,"I couldn't help but notice that your proposition is that concealed carry escalates conflict, but your evidence for this claim has nothing to do with concealed carry.  Carrying in a car is not concealed carry and you do not need a CHL to do that.  Having a gun at home is not concealed carry and similarly you don't need a license for that.  Jurisdictions with concealed carry have dramatically lower crime rates that jurisdictions with heavy gun control.  Detroit, DC, and Chicago have the harshest gun control and the highest violent crime rates.  Finally, the mass shootings that are stopped by CHLs are not statistically compiled, since that would be impossible.  Something like 95% of mass shootings occur in places where concealed carry is banned, like Virginia Tech, the Aurora Theater, Ft Hood, and many more.  It's not possible to count the times a mass shooter did not commit the act due to his cowardice to have a fair fight, but it's still evident that they are afraid of such a fight and are deterred by the possibility of opposing someone with a gun.  About 55% of mass shooters commit suicide when they encounter or learn they soon will encounter a police officer or armed person.  Consider how committing suicide is obviously much more harsh than simply not going through with the act in the first place.  Or don't... I realize that this sort of controversy does not lend itself to either side being intellectually fair.  But it is this deterrence that underpins the argument far more than the notion that a CHL holder is going to save the day one day.    Thus, it's likely the vast majority of mass shootings never happened.  All those lives were saved by CHL laws.  At any rate, yes, I do think your side of the debate lacks evidence because, with all due respect, you didn't present any evidence about CHL holders except the odd assertion that no CHL holder has ever stopped a shooting (that is not true)."

UTAustin,37gbgj,Drayzen,-1,Thu May 28 11:23:17 2015 UTC,"Shouldn't have to worry about guns at school being a thing anyways.   This is the equivalent of a Republican saying ""Women shouldn't have to worry about getting pregnant anyways"" or ""Men shouldn't marry other men anyways"". Just dismissing the argument because you don't want to open your ignorant mind.  Do you worry about guns when you're off campus? You do realize CC permit holders are all around you in public all the time right? Do you worry about it? No, because CC permit holders don't just randomly start shooting people for no reason. You don't even realize who they are or when they are near you because their weapon is concealed."
UTAustin,37gbgj,justduck01,-5,Thu May 28 22:23:04 2015 UTC,So? More people pulling out guns or having direct access to them is not a good thing. It's not civilized.

You basically just came right out and said ""I don't care about the facts of the situation, I don't like guns and think they are icky so I don't think anyone should be able to have them."""

I'm saying, don't let a bunch of 21 year olds who haven't even matured into adults bring weapons to school. There is simply no reason for it. There is zero logical reason to arm more people.   The only reason is ""everyone wants to be the hero.""  Especially when it requires are a 6 hour course. Fuck man, they go to school for more than decade to learn how to be an adult in the real world, and in 6 hours we give them the power to carry a life ending weapon in public. Yeah, that's fucking accurate. We don't even check up on their mental state via a certified state therapist or psychotherapist... you know. Those things that professionals have on staff and have to see on a regular basis.   It takes me longer to past a SCRUM certification course than it does to get a concealed carry license."
UTAustin,37gbgj,Drayzen,0,Fri May 29 02:56:18 2015 UTC,"So you're saying legal adults who have the right to vote, marry, join the armed forces, gamble in areas where it is permitted, purchase pornography, alcohol, and cigarrettes, are just kids?  Again, you do realize that any student over the age of 21 can already legally have a CHL and carry concealed anywhere other than the UT campus and other ""gun-free"" zones?"
UTAustin,37gbgj,justduck01,0,Fri May 29 03:34:43 2015 UTC,"I like how you complain about disrespect while calling people who disagree with you all kinds of disrespectful names in a rambling comment that is difficult to piece together.  Not to be a grammar nationalist socialist, but what did ""it requires are a 6 hour course"" mean?  I think it's rather amusing you bristle at being called a liberal, which is a common way to say 'left of center', only to 'correct' by saying you are a socialist progressive, which is obviously left of center.  At any rate, Texas is quite far from your POV generally, and thus has by far the best opportunities in the country.  It took me two hours to find a job that could feed my family.  Took a few months to find a job I liked, but the employment opportunities in Texas are awesome.  The state's budget is generally excellent.  If you control for English as second language students, our education system is arguably the best in the nation.  All this because of a basic attitude that government doesn't exist to permit us to do things, or solve our problems, or really even help us out.  It exists to do what can't be done without government, and otherwise stay out of the way.  Thus a person in California may have access to many services, but they can't get a job in a country with the lowest labor participation rate (real unemployment) in about 40 years (likely double your life if your emotions are any indicator of your maturity).  You can't effectively argue against handgun rights until you understand this basic element where people think the government has to justify restricting a right, rather than the people have to justify exercising it.  Throwing in a 'twat' or a 'fuck' doesn't make you sound more powerful in your dismissal of this point of view... quite the contrary... it justifies skepticism that your policies have Texans' best interests at heart.  Do you?  I suspect you have contempt for most people here.  Why should we adopt policies from someone who feels that way about us?"
UTAustin,37gbgj,TEOTAUY,3,Sun May 31 22:11:23 2015 UTC,"Well if they don't remain bogged down with useless legislation like this then they might actually have to work on helping people, which sounds like way too much work."

UTAustin,37gf25,Herooftime64,3,Wed May 27 13:07:41 2015 UTC,"Don't apologize for A&M, it actually has many fantastic programs! That being said, transfer into the UT Nursing program is going to be very, very competitive. For internal transfers (students already at UT Austin), you really want to be around at least a 3.5 GPA. With you being an external transfer, you'll want to be as high on that GPA scale as possible unfortunately. For overall transfer admission to the university, you'll want at least a 3.0 (and that's not a guaranteed acceptance either). Nursing has no minimum listed, but the higher you can get, the better. Try aiming for at least that 3.5.  Your question about Pre-Nursing gets a little weird though. Originally, you would have applied and been accepted Pre-Nursing then applied again to the Upper-Division Professional Sequence. Nursing is now moving to a ""once you're accepted to Nursing, you're automatically in the Professional Sequence"" model. The last semester they are accepting applications to the Upper-Division Nursing sequence will be Spring of 2016. It's likely with where you are currently in your timeline, that when you apply, you will be applying into the Auto-Professional-Sequence Model. That being said, it would be much better to call the Nursing Office and/or the Office of Admission and clarify that when you're applying since it IS something that is currently changing.  Most of my other advice on the application process can be found here on the Admissions webpage. Basically it boils down to do well (particularly in Science & Math courses), have volunteer and work activities relating to healthcare (if you can do this in the hospital, even better), and you need to have 3 specific classes completed: CH 301, BIO 311C,and Stats (SDS 302 or M 316). Outside of that, the more classes you can successfully complete from the degree plan, the better.  My last piece of advice is more personal than requirement: make sure Nursing is actually what you want to do before you apply for it. There are many components of Nursing and many of those components can be found in other majors. Getting some of that work in the hospitals for the application will definitely help solidify/challenge your interest(assuming you've not done any of that already. For all I know, you're 110% sure that Nursing is your forte and passion, in which case, fantastic, ignore this piece of advice).  If you have any other questions, I'll do my best to answer them. Either way, best of luck when you do apply and I hope it all turns out in the best way possible for you!  P.S. Love the username. I feel like I should have made this entire post an allegory for Legend of Zelda. Oh well, opportunity missed. :("
UTAustin,37gf25,AtypicalAnaphora,2,Wed May 27 23:37:06 2015 UTC,"Wow, thank you so much for your very detailed and organized reply, this is extremely helpful! And I agree, if you had been able to meld a whole LOZ connection into a question about Nursing, I would have been extremely impressed! That being said, I have a couple of questions.  What is the Auto-Professional-Sequence Model? From the name of it, I'm interpreting it as being the same as the Upper-Division Nursing sequence. It sounds like they will still be accpeting students straight into the program, or is it something else? I will probably be applying and being accepted in the Spring 2016 semester, so I'm guessing this won't apply to me, but I just want to be sure.   Also, I notice you said that you think I should be aiming for about a 3.5 to get into nursing. I calculated my gpa that I expect to have at the end of the Spring 2016 semester, and I got a 3.3. The thing that's really bothering me with that is that my gpa while I was in engineering was a 1.6, but after taking nursing classes last semester I made a 3.5, which I predict I can continue to make, if not better, in the next two semester. My nursing courses gpa should be at least above a 3.75. Now, although that might be a little bit low, I have a few other accolades that I think might help me get into the program: 1. I've had a job working in a hospital for two summers in a row as a CNA 2. I'm an Eagle Scout 3. I'm a member of A&M's pre-nursing society 4. I'm shadowing several CRNA's and surgeons this summer  So, do you think these will help pull me up? Or will the 3.3 weigh me down too much? Thanks again for taking the time to answer this!!"
UTAustin,37gf25,AtypicalAnaphora,2,Thu May 28 03:54:32 2015 UTC,"The Auto-Professional-Sequence Model isn't the real name, but basically, instead of needing to apply to get into the Upper-Division Sequence, once admitted to UT's Nursing school, you will automatically be in. No need to apply to an Professional/Upper-Division Sequence or anything. If your plan is to be accepted and starting during the Spring semester, my assumption is that you would wind up automatically in the major, but that's the semester where it will be most tricky. Working with admissions/nursing will keep you in the loop as to whether you would need to apply to Upper-Division or if you're good to go once you get in.  A 3.3 will weigh you down, but the fact that you'll have a 3.75 GPA in Nursing classes will definitely help and the other accolades you mentioned will definitely stand out. Make sure to put thought into the required essay and make it real/personal. Have others read it; if A&M have a Writing Center or Career Counselors, get some input from them. I've seen the essay make or break the internal transfer application, though I can't speak to its weight in the external process.  Admissions is always a moving target and depends a lot upon the amount of people who just graduated/amount of spots available and the caliber/number of people applying. During Spring you won't be competing against freshman for the most part, but there are usually less spaces available as well.  I definitely think you should apply, but I can't give you any sort of % chance of likelihood of acceptance. If Nursing is something you want to do and you don't want to do it at A&M, I would suggest applying to more places than just UT Austin though. It never hurts to have more than one avenue in place."

Deny the allegations, demand the name of your accuser, demand the date and time of the alleged offense and state the facts.  You were not there at that time, you do not smoke or otherwise ingest any illegal substances, you do not appreciate having your time wasted over a baseless allegation, and you appreciate their responsible action but it is unwarranted in this case.  If they continue to press the issue, contact an actual attorney and see what legal actions YOU might take in terms of the allegations being  baseless, harming your good name and academic record, etc.  If there was suspicion of drug use, the police are the correct people to investigate an actual crime.

Take the advice @prettyslattern laid on ya, deny. act super offended (because you're welcome to be so), and contact a lawyer if they don't just immediately drop it.

Truthfully, outside of funds, it makes little difference if it's 4 or 5 years.  At this point you need to look back on your previous semesters and learn from them. Did you not study enough? Do more. Utilize Sanger if it would be helpful. Did you have some personal issues in your life affecting your academics? Visit CMHC to talk about it. The only reason at this point that you should feel bad is if you don't learn from the past. UT is teaching you skills and knowledge, yeah, but one if the big things you're unconsciously learning right now is how you deal and learn from adversity.  When you graduate and start looking for jobs, you'll have a clean slate. No one will care if it took you 5+ years, and if they do ask about it, just be truthful: it started off difficult, but this is how I improved. My friend who took 6 years? Currently a computer programmer making much more than I am and I graduated in 4 years. Just use your extra year wisely; get involved, do research if that's your thing, look into internships, etc.  You got this.

As for your friends, I wouldn't get in the habit of comparing oneself to them: sometimes you'll be doing better than them, sometimes they'll be doing better than you in life.

UTAustin,3776r2,ODA157,2,Tue May 26 03:01:41 2015 UTC,"I'm not at UT, but I wouldn't sweat it. On my course right now, I'm due to graduate with a bachelor's in another four years (after being in school for a year and a half.) And then I'll be pursuing a Masters. A lot of it comes down to how many courses I can handle, while also working full-time. It is what it is. We live, on average, 78 years. That's a long ass time. You got time. Don't compare yourself to others. People get where they need to get on their own time; some finish quicker, some finish later. It's not a race. What matters is what you get out of it."
UTAustin,3776r2,AtypicalAnaphora,2,Tue May 26 07:08:42 2015 UTC,"Not trying to be negative here but this is something I've been wondering. I'm on track to graduate in 3 years. I'm 27 so I'm not a traditional student but it just seems like such a waste to not take summer classes. Yeah, the workload is a bitch in the summer but you're getting a huge leg up on your studies. Campus feels like a ghost town over the summer. Is there a reason the overwhelming majority decide to not take classes over the summer outside of laziness?"
UTAustin,3776r2,longhorn___786,5,Mon May 25 18:36:10 2015 UTC,"A very valid question. For most traditional students, there's a few reasons: *Some do take classes, but at the local community colleges. It's cheaper, they likely don't need to pay rent, and they get to see their families. *Finances is another big one. Some students can't afford more than they already pay to attend during regular semesters. Some students work the entire summer to help offset the cost of the Spring and fall semesters. *Some students feel they are needed at home/have family obligations, whether that's to watch their siblings while the parent works, take care of an ill family member, etc. *Certain degrees are sequenced in such a way that it's not exceedingly helpful to take summer classes as it might only move your graduation up by a semester(architecture and engineering being two of the main examples where this might happen) *Many of them are just on autopilot from elementary, middle, and high school. You got to classes during the fall and spring and summer is your vacation time.  Those are some of the reasons I've seen outside of the laziness factor. As a non-traditional student, you also likely see things in a very different light than many of the students on campus, which can be fantastic when the students are willing to learn from your experiences."

UTAustin,3776r2,ATXblazer,1 point,Tue May 26 07:28:45 2015 UTC,"Taking a break might help if you're constantly wrecking it, I was in a similar position I think years ago. I thought I could finish in 3 years total due to walking in with like 60+ hours. I ended up switching colleges like 4 times and exact major more than that. After some difficult personal times a few semesters in I went from doing mediocre to failing 3 or 4 semesters in a row. I had to take a forced break (medical condition, that coincided with me getting put on probation). Just came back after being away for 4 years (try not to take this long if you do take a break, mine wasn't particularly by choice). Despite the break really throwing me off my school game/time to exit, I did indeed come back reinvigorated and with a lot more purpose. After one decent first semester back, the second was even better. I graduate in December and I'm sure if you add up all my semesters I'll technically be in the 7-year club, which yeah, feels ridiculous. But damn I do not care at this point, especially when I look back to the time I spent away from it, far less certain about anything."

UTAustin,3776r2,SoulsticeCleaner,1 point,Tue May 26 14:15:26 2015 UTC,"Cheer up! Here's a personal story that might help:  I screwed around in high school (c/o 2012) and had to go the boring community college route. With that track record, I was already behind and didn't get into UT until Fall 2014. Even then I got in on my second-choice, a liberal arts major. Now, two semesters later, I am finally in my preferred major and still looking at 3-4 more semesters to go.  But in the meantime, I have tried to keep myself busy. I networked my way into an up and coming startup, founded an organization on campus, joined a professional org in Austin relevant to my major, utilized the shit out of Lynda.com, and made a point to live life party my ass off while I still can.  The college experience is subjective to you, my friend. Work on bettering yourself and what you will become once you actually do graduate. You have way too long of a life to go worrying about one extra year.  p.s. This isn't high school. No one expects you to graduate at the same time as everyone in your freshman class. And, if all of your friends are graduating at the same time, maybe it's time to re-evaluate your networks. Best of luck to you!"

Afterwards, any remainder will be given to you either by direct deposit, or mailed to your local address if you do not have direct deposit set up.  One thing is that it's all released in a lump sum to you at the beginning of the semester and it's your responsibility to budget it out appropriately. Spend it wisely."

UTAustin,375d8x,RandomJPG6,1 point,Mon May 25 04:39:20 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry, I guess I should have clarified. You're right in that financial aid is split up between semesters and you will not receive your entire year's worth of financial aid in the fall semester.  One common mistake that students make is not having enough money for January rent. There's a gap of time between rent being due in January and the release of spring financial aid.   Make sure you have enough money at the end of fall to cover at least your January rent while you wait for your spring aid to release. The financial aid office will likely not issue an emergency loan for you to pay for your rent in this scenario."
UTAustin,375d8x,belloport,1 point,Mon May 25 19:21:20 2015 UTC,"Yes, it is. After UT receives notification of your aid, it will (usually) go towards your tuition and the rest will be disbursed to you to use as you please."
UTAustin,374ql6,andydroo,2,Sun May 24 21:29:43 2015 UTC,"I transferred last Fall. I went to UTD for 2 years, then transferred here. Personally, I still prefer UTD and its atmosphere, but there's plenty that's good here. I honestly came because UT has a bigger name for my major (CS), and I wanted to give myself every opportunity that I could to be successful. You can still be perfectly successful graduating from UTD, but UT does open up a few more doors.  I applied pretty late in the Spring semester, and heard back I think early on in the Summer (don't quote me on that, I honestly can't remember how long it took). I had a 3.86 GPA, an internship, and research experience.  Be aware that just because the schools are under the same name, they don't follow similar degree plans. Many of my classes from UTD didn't transfer here, even though I had an A in pretty much all of them. It has sucked to retake them, but it is what it is.  If you have any specific questions, let me know and I'll try to answer them, no promises on how fast I'll get to it though, I'm out of town on vacation."
UTAustin,374ql6,dumebringer,1 point,Sun May 24 21:47:19 2015 UTC,"Which classes is particular didn't transfer? Maybe I could put off taking them until after I transfer. I'm an upcoming freshman, so the only college credits I have are from AP exams so far."
UTAustin,374ql6,dumebringer,3,Sun May 24 23:29:38 2015 UTC,"For me personally, Computer Architecture, Operating Systems, and Discrete Math didn't transfer. I had taken Discrete 1 and 2 at UTD, and they didn't count it for Discrete 1 here. It was WAY harder at UTD anyway, so Discrete was easy to redo, but Computer Architecture and Operating Systems (OS especially) suck here."
UTAustin,374ql6,AtypicalAnaphora,2,Mon May 25 00:58:41 2015 UTC,"A lot of CS classes don't transfer unfortunately. UT does have this nifty tool called the Automated Transfer Equivalency System that will let you put in the course numbers for what you're taking at UTD (or other Texas schools) and will tell you what it will transfer into UT as. What you'll likely find with many of the CS courses is that they'll transfer in as CS 3HRS, which means they come in as elective Computer Science credit, which is generally pretty unhelpful.  That being said, you can use the ATE and the UT CS degree plan to make sure the classes will transfer in a helpful way.  One note though is that the CS department has become extremely competitive over the last year or so, so keep that in mind in terms of working on being a good applicant.  Best of luck in your endeavors! And definitely let me know if you have any follow-up questions (the ATE can get a little confusing)."

I think my GPA was like 3.47 or something but that's only because I had taken dual credit English my senior year of high school (I was lazy in high school hence community college). Ended up not getting accepted until mid June.   I have loved my time at UT and wouldn't trade it for anything. I fucking loathed community college.

I'm not sure of the CNS procedure, but in UGS you have the opportunity to do a dismissal appeal. Check in with your advisor about that possibility if you don't meet the grade contract. With a 1.97 you should stand a pretty good chance if you're able to appeal barring any other circumstances not mentioned.  Best of luck with the process!"
UTAustin,370yzo,AtypicalAnaphora,1 point,Sat May 23 22:10:05 2015 UTC,"You'll always get a SAN if your GPA is below 2.0 at the end of the semester, regardless of what academic plans you've already signed. It's just the way the system is set up, and they haven't bothered to weed out the exceptions (like those on academic plans).  Basically, if you maintained a pretty good average, didn't fail any classes, didn't go below full time, and didn't go below 75% completion on your pace, you should be fine. Mind you, these restrictions apply ONLY to the classes you've taken since getting on your academic plan. So if you started the plan at the beginning of the spring semester, had a (for example) 3.0 GPA, completed all classes you attempted (meaning you signed up for 15 hours in the beginning and completed all 15 hours), and you didn't fail any classes, you should be good to go."

I do want to plug CMHC (Counseling &Mental Healt Center in the SSB) since you mentioned mental health. It sounds like you may already be meeting with someone, but I just wanted to let you know they are a resource. Since you registered with SSD, it should definitely help with your appeal. I'm not sure if you saw this page, but near the middle there's a ""CS Entry-Level/Promotion"" area.  Under the first question there it mentions that you should receive a SAN with more information/the process to appeal. It does mention that appeals are really only granted due to documented extenuating circumstances though it's never guaranteed. If your appeal is denied, you'd likely want to start with the advisors. Most departments will have you meet with them before meeting with the dean.  On a side note, if you earned less than a C- in any of those entry level courses, you should be eligible to automatically retake that course one more time.  Either way, best of luck with your situation, and keep an eye out for that SAN. Feel free to reach out to the CS advising office if you'd like though."

I was denied to CS as an internal transfer, and he didn't let me into CS, but he did let me into CS 311 and CS 314 for that summer. My point is that talking to the dean won't hurt you.

Check out the live music scene. Hike the Greenbelt, it's been raining a lot this year, so there should be a ton of pools to cool off in. Barton Creek (obviously.) Go to the Oasis-- I've gone midafternoon for a beer and queso, much cheaper and the view is the same.  Check out Mount Bonnell.  The Cathedral of Junk. Go to 6th street or Rainey then head to Kerbey Lane for 3AM pancakes. Eat at Tacodeli and Torchy's Tacos. Eat something out of a food truck (there's a food truck park in west campus.) Kayak on town lake in the late afternoon, and get near Congress Bridge at sunset to watch the bats. Check out the events at BookPeople. Alcoholic ice cream at Amy's. Watch a movie at Alamo Drafthouse."

UTAustin,36jb2x,eduzueck,1 point,Tue May 19 22:59:16 2015 UTC,Quick question: does your sister have her housing confirmed for the next school year?
UTAustin,36jb2x,BlackSpidermanIsReal,1 point,Wed May 20 00:25:11 2015 UTC,"Not yet, shes still on the waitlist. Which is also pretty surprising to be for an international freshman. I went to a different school here and we had our orientation after move in. Which is why I'm wondering why its this way"
UTAustin,36jb2x,BlackSpidermanIsReal,1 point,Wed May 20 00:53:25 2015 UTC,"Okay I thought as much. I was in the same shoes as her (applied for housing in April) and was told constantly that I was on the waitlist over the summer. It ended up that I had to look for off-campus housing since the housing division does a poor job at informing you of how likely you will end up with on-campus housing.   I suggest you start looking for housing options off-campus if things do not work out. West Campus is the preferred location (albeit pretty pricey, but still around the same you'd pay on campus over a year). North campus is a bit quieter and cheaper, but tends to be seen as pretty isolated and boring. Riverside is if you are really trying to save money (ranges $4,000-$7,000 for pretty decent apartments) but almost 5-6 miles from campus.   Good luck to your sister, I really hope she's able to get her housing arrangements sorted. If you resort to off-campus housing, make sure to get candid reviews about the apartment complexes you might be looking at. Lots of these guys just care about getting non-cancelable leases signed and won't care about the residents one bit after that."
UTAustin,36jb2x,BlackSpidermanIsReal,2,Wed May 20 01:31:16 2015 UTC,"Damn, are you serious? When do you suggest i start looking for options off campus? Were you international as well, how did you go about signing the lease, etc.?"
UTAustin,36jb2x,bubbasaurus,2,Wed May 20 02:20:51 2015 UTC,"Yes I am international and was lucky to have a domestic relative to help me find a place to stay my freshman year.  First and foremost, call the housing division as many times as possible to check what your chances look like. If it still does not look good, start looking at possible apartments that your sister might like.  I would say the most stressful part of this off-campus housing search is finding a place that she will for sure like over the year, including roommates and neighbors.   Due to some other family engagements I literally arrived to school the day before classes without housing and had to drive around to several apartments before we found a suitable one. Regardless, I was able to stay at 26 West Apartment (one of the best in WC) for a relatively good price and good roommates. I got lucky basically. We signed the lease in like an hour pretty much."
UTAustin,36jb2x,Vertigostark,1 point,Wed May 20 02:41:24 2015 UTC,I'd recommend checking out co-ops too - lots of international students live there.  Try College Houses.

It's a stupid idea, kids won't spend money there, but they are the style of store that can actually afford the retail space there now. If your restaurant isn't seeing at least decent foot traffic you're toast. What happened to mellow mushroom was straight sneaky lawyering from the sound of it, which is really messed up, but indicative of what's at play here. It's valuable land.  But the key now is to only go to places that are unique. Go to Kismet, go to Austin Pizza, even Kens donuts all the way up in 27th. Buy that random cheap crap in the stalls that pop up near the co-op if that's your thing. But everything else is foot traffic, and money."
UTAustin,36cep3,FranklySinatra,5,Mon May 18 07:37:00 2015 UTC,Ken's Donuts looks like someone hung from the rafters and blasted the whole place with diarrhea. Definitely wouldn't mind seeing a higher quality establishment take that spot.

Things change.  I agree with those who would prefer the Drag didn't become a corporate strip mall with nothing more unique than a couple of murals.  It takes away from the culture and charm of the university setting rather than adding to it.  Heck, I remember when Texadelphia was just in the Union underground and across the street on the drag.  $4 got you a cheesesteak that was at least 50% bigger than the ones they sell for $8 today plus you could pay with a check if you had no cash.

UTAustin,36bog6,_Valediction,5,Mon May 18 05:32:14 2015 UTC,You can find that info here: http://registrar.utexas.edu/schedules/152/grades
UTAustin,36bog6,gustavohdz,2,Mon May 18 02:39:09 2015 UTC,Varies by when your class met/when your final exams were. I believe Friday is the final due date.
UTAustin,36b7jk,parthadhia,10,Sun May 17 23:28:10 2015 UTC,"The meter parking (ie. Dean Keaton, 21st, Guadalupe) is free everyday 6pm - 8am and all day on Sundays, so there's really no excuse to park illegally."
UTAustin,36b7jk,_edd,2,Mon May 18 00:26:42 2015 UTC,There's also metered parking outside the bob bullock and in west campus...all of which is also free after 6pm! Really no reason to park on campus without a permit
UTAustin,36b7jk,throwthisawaybitches,3,Mon May 18 02:06:39 2015 UTC,"Yes. I think PTS has fewer people patrolling at midnight though, so you might get lucky if you want to chance it. I've gotten ticketed after 11:30pm before (actually had a parking permit, but I neglected to hang it from my rear view mirror, so I got ticketed)."
UTAustin,36b7jk,mrflarp,1 point,Sun May 17 23:59:18 2015 UTC,"They have fewer people, but they make up for it with technology.  They can just cruise around, and if a car is not properly permitted, the plate reader will tell them.  The night owl permit is pretty cheap though."
UTAustin,36b7jk,TEOTAUY,1 point,Tue May 19 00:59:02 2015 UTC,"In my case, I had a permit, was parked in a space that it applied to, and I had my license place entered into the system under my parking profile. So if it was just the camera carts, I should have been okay. Someone had to have gone around the front of the car to see I didn't have my permit hanging from the rear view mirror. I recall the ticket even said something to the effect of ""failure to display permit"".   To be fair, they do say that you're required to keep it on display at all times. But getting a $21 ticket while parked in a permitted spot which I was already paying for via a parking permit was still pretty shitty.  But yeah. I've seen the carts with the cameras mounted on them. They just drive by and scan all the license plates."
UTAustin,36b7jk,mrflarp,3,Tue May 19 02:36:39 2015 UTC,I wouldn't put it past them.  I have no idea when/if they check that late but if you don't feel like shelling out the cash if you get a ticket just park somewhere legal.
UTAustin,36b7jk,CF5300,1 point,Sun May 17 23:59:37 2015 UTC,"Parking in the garages is $3 per hour. If you really need to park on campus, I would just pay the 3 bucks and not risk getting cited."
UTAustin,36bf63,almostalumnus,2,Mon May 18 00:39:18 2015 UTC,The orange and white ones are probably college scholar cords. You get them for being in the top 20% I believe.
UTAustin,3663bq,rikinmshah,11,Sat May 16 14:40:07 2015 UTC,North campus is the best campus.
UTAustin,3663bq,WhiteEyedFly,4,Sat May 16 15:02:20 2015 UTC,Obligatory.
UTAustin,3663bq,windowsyou,3,Sat May 16 15:03:17 2015 UTC,"West Campus is the closest you can get but prices for everything are way too high. If you want cheaper and still be able to take a 5 minute bus ride, north campus is probably your best bet for a good priced condo."
UTAustin,3663bq,abhd,2,Sat May 16 16:34:45 2015 UTC,"I lived on campus, north, east, and riverside before. And castillian. I think west and north campus is fine choice. How much are you willing to pay? Wsgaustin.com have some nice apt complexes"

UTAustin,3650bp,NostalgicRageHQ,3,Sat May 16 05:01:31 2015 UTC,"I took it during fall last year, and I have to say that it is a challenging class, stay on top of the homework and the materials and you will be fine. Use the Calc lab that is available for you as much as you can/need. Good luck."
UTAustin,3650bp,texan11moore,3,Sun May 17 00:27:54 2015 UTC,I just finished the class.  It's absolutely grueling compared to 408K.  I'm trying to get into business and would have taken it at community college if I knew was allowed to use the credit.  It's easily the hardest class I've taken all year.
UTAustin,3650bp,sks1024,2,Sun May 17 01:48:35 2015 UTC,"Meth is great, but definitely take it at a CC."
UTAustin,364bnf,Peter_Weyland,40,Sat May 16 00:32:56 2015 UTC,"Don't look at this junction as the result of any insurmountable inability on your part. The concept of college as a well-defined, four-year line isn't true for most people, and you shouldn't feel like your experiences have been meaningless and things won't get better.  There are many possible reasons for your struggles in college (incompatible profs, poor scheduling, outside stress, etc), and unfortunately, many of these may be out of your control. However, you should also take this opportunity to reflect on the things that were within your control and the things that you can do differently when you're back.  It's okay to make mistakes. Mistakes give us the opportunity to explore other choices, question our motivations, and, ultimately, find a more optimal path."
UTAustin,364bnf,zifnabxar,5,Sat May 16 01:20:16 2015 UTC,Mistakes can also give you some kick-ass cover letters about overcoming adversity when you do get pass them.
UTAustin,364bnf,nicharesuk,15,Sat May 16 06:06:04 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you're having an extremely rough time. Maybe look at this opportunity of dismissal to truly find what you want to do. It seems that CS isn't what you want to do, (and if it is and it's just college that's getting you down, then I strongly urge you to start working on self teaching yourself everything you need to know like programming and business concepts to start working in the field, up your programming and do a ton of personal projects, things you can show off, but do it cause you want to not because you will think it makes you money) During your semester off really look at what you want, do you like math classes? Math is a great option for people coming out of CS.   WHAT YOU SHOULD NOT DO: 1.Feel sorry for yourself. College is hard, I know plenty of people that have dropped out and become successful, you have to take this moment as a learning experience. 2. Do not waste this valuable opportunity to find out what you really want in your life. If this experience is telling you that college isn't for you, then follow it and find what is for you, there are plenty of ways to find what you want, it isn't all about having a good degree and making lots of money.  3. Always look ahead, the happiest people are those who take their past and make a better future with it. Just being alive you have so much opportunity to make your life better and more exciting everyday, all you need to do is put in the work. If you ever find that the route you're going isn't what you want, change it, even if it means starting at square one again and again.  Sorry for the long winded message, I just hope something I've said rang true for you!   TL;DR This is a great opportunity for you to learn what you want in your life, seize this moment and learn from it and be thankful for it."
UTAustin,364bnf,TheRedGerund,12,Sat May 16 01:27:53 2015 UTC,"Well, shit man, two years in and you haven't passed the freshman courses? So you took the courses, failed, then took them again then failed again? You either have something getting in the way of your ability to concentrate/study or this field/ this degree just isn't for you.   I don't know, that's pretty rough. Either drop out and learn to code or pick a new major. That's about all you can do."
UTAustin,364bnf,DealLayLolMo,6,Sat May 16 02:52:37 2015 UTC,"One of my friends got kicked out of CS, and he starts doing more CS thing than he should because he has choice, and finally got interview from companies like Whatsapp, Indeed, and even Microsoft.   It's not the major in the school, it's the skill in your heart."
UTAustin,364bnf,PulpFreeOJyo,4,Sat May 16 06:22:15 2015 UTC,"Don't worry man. One thing I've come to realize is that the CS department can be quite cruel. 2.55 minimum gpa between 3 classes to get promoted to upper division is absurb. I screwed up 1 exam this semester and almost didn't make the cutoff gpa.  Some people thrive in CS and others don't. The department seem to cater to those who do. I don't know what you did to get to this point, but you seriously have to reconsider your major. That sounds a bit harsh but it will only get harder.   Like others have said, use this time to explore other options. Personally if I were you, I'd start looking at trade schools or even transfer to other universities to pursue the major you want in case it's restricted at UT. Definitely don't use all this time to do nothing. Get a job if you need it to to pay the rent and learn some skills in your free time. If you really like CS, there are so many resources online to help you out. Udemy.com has a lot of great courses, but you'll have to pay.  They do have a lot of sales where you can get a $200 class for $10. Codecademy.com is also great and so is bento.io. Good luck man. Don't be so harsh on yourself!"
UTAustin,364bnf,Bokononism4Life,6,Sat May 16 03:44:28 2015 UTC,"It's actually a 2.75 GPA now, unfortunately."
UTAustin,364bnf,DealLayLolMo,1 point,Sat May 16 12:38:03 2015 UTC,"Jesus, I actually almost failed at 314 with Scott because was being lazy, I start brushing up my work as soon as possible after realising there is a GPA cutoff. So glad I got promoted in the final."
UTAustin,364bnf,sinkking,6,Sat May 16 22:31:30 2015 UTC,"Seek help from a therapist. If you can't afford it, try Austin's Capital Area Counseling."
UTAustin,364bnf,Filthy_Fil,3,Sat May 16 02:46:28 2015 UTC,"Sorry. I guess just try to turn over a new leaf when you get back. The people and resources are here, but you have to take them."
UTAustin,364bnf,rduser,3,Sat May 16 01:09:19 2015 UTC,"don't feel bad, people getting kicked out of CS has become a thing now"
UTAustin,364bnf,DavidatUT,1 point,Sat May 16 01:46:27 2015 UTC,"Some people don't understand that UT is the big league of public education in Texas.  If you didn't come to give it your best, you really don't belong.   If you didn't learn a single thing. Haven't made a single study buddy or friend, and gained absolutely nothing...   UT isn't a place that you can just stop by a pick up a degree in whatever topic you want."
UTAustin,364bnf,jlatto,-3,Thu May 21 16:38:03 2015 UTC,Thats your fault
UTAustin,364bnf,CS41251252,7,Sat May 16 05:18:06 2015 UTC,Shh Its obviously the colleges fault. Failing Intro to programming twice requires some real hard work.
UTAustin,364823,Fastpakii,7,Fri May 15 23:58:20 2015 UTC,You can take any of the UT Extension self-paced online courses and take exams at a local testing center. Lots of community colleges throughout Texas also offer courses online that will transfer for UT credit. Use this to find courses
UTAustin,364823,unoriginalloser,1 point,Sat May 16 00:29:53 2015 UTC,Does University Extention courses count as In-Residence UT hours or does it count as Transfer credit?
UTAustin,364823,emergencynumber,2,Sat May 16 20:00:33 2015 UTC,"Does not count as in-residence, but does affect your UT GPA.    There are a lot of online courses in the summer. Go to the keyword search in the course schedule and search ""wb"" (web based)... you get a list of all of them in every subject. Many of those won't require you to be in Austin. If you find one you like, i'd either check to see if a syllabus is available for when the course has been taught previously (https://utdirect.utexas.edu/apps/student/coursedocs/nlogon/) to see if it's 100% online, or just email the professor and ask."
UTAustin,364823,NameIWontRegret,2,Sat May 16 20:38:05 2015 UTC,"Cool, thank you! I really appreciate your well-informed responses. I already chose a class to take online and have emailed and received a response from the professor."
UTAustin,364823,donutbomb,2,Sat May 16 21:01:19 2015 UTC,"You don't have to come to Austin. There are testing centers all over the United States. Even if you did have to take it in person, you would just go to your local college/administrative setting."
UTAustin,364823,rachelpineflavor,2,Sat May 16 02:17:12 2015 UTC,"If any business foundations classes are offered, they might be online-only. I took intro to finance this past spring and there were no physical components to it."
UTAustin,364823,donutbomb,1 point,Sat May 16 06:19:06 2015 UTC,"How was that class, if you took it online? I'm a little nervous about mine this summer since I've never taken an online class before"
UTAustin,364823,bradfleu,2,Sun Jul 5 22:48:47 2015 UTC,"It was easy if you get a PDF of the book that you can search, and you don't procrastinate. There are two-week deadlines so you won't end up screwing yourself over by putting things off until the last minute. About 3-4 hours of work (watching videos and taking quizzes) every two weeks. A couple short essays at the start of the semester."
UTAustin,365j3k,apr_pro,4,Sat May 16 09:58:38 2015 UTC,"A 3.8-4.0 in CS will be tough. Like you'll have to work a ton for it. A 3.5-3.75 is much more manageable. 3.75 is the cutoff for the top 10% of the kids and like 3.84 is top 4% maybe? I'm not quite sure what it is for my grade this year. I just finished my 3rd year in the department. I have a 3.6 in CS, and I definetly did not work as hard as a lot of people. People with the 3.8-4.0's don't have much of a life outside of CS. Well, they do, they just work an extra 5-15 hours a week on school. Your life will be school practically. Good for some, not good with others."
UTAustin,365j3k,dbzfanjake,7,Sat May 16 10:27:33 2015 UTC,"quick correction because I'm a nerd: Top 4% is more like something around 3.95.   The cutoffs vary since they're percentages, but over the past few years the 4% cutoff (for summa cum laude) is usually somewhere around there.  As you get closer to 4.0 it becomes considerably harder to increase/maintain your numbers. Always seems to be easier to lose GPA points than gain them."
UTAustin,365j3k,drang55,2,Sat May 16 17:01:34 2015 UTC,"Cool, thanks for the correction. I had no idea about the 4%. I just guessed the 3.75 from a friend who's on the honors list"
UTAustin,365j3k,dbzfanjake,1 point,Sat May 16 17:09:58 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your great answer!    Well, they do, they just work an extra 5-15 hours a week on school.   What is the average number of hours people work on school?"
UTAustin,365j3k,Galactic_Empire,2,Sat May 16 10:30:25 2015 UTC,I have a 3.75 in CS and I put about 18-25 hours / week to CS outside of class and projects (pure studying). Doing Pintos this semester in CS439 was really difficult. That's another 15 -20 hours / week just for that project. I'd say I put in around 33-45 hours /week to CS alone. I honestly don't know how other people do it. I'm on the verge of having no life.
UTAustin,365j3k,scotchirish,4,Sat May 16 11:35:42 2015 UTC,"Take some solace in that Pintos was the most life consuming element of my CS career.   I'm convinced Pintos was mainly intended to teach CS students to appreciate friends, the outdoors, life in general and to not turn into stereotypical basement dwellers."
UTAustin,365j3k,Galactic_Empire,2,Sun May 17 16:52:36 2015 UTC,"Now that I think about it, I think you're right."
UTAustin,365j3k,biddybam,3,Mon May 18 00:59:31 2015 UTC,"You'll find that GPA doesn't matter terribly much as a CS student. Companies generally don't care unless you have atrocious GPA, so I imagine if you keep it above like a 3.2 you should be fine (which won't be hard if you are a good student)."
UTAustin,365j3k,BoomerBreh,1 point,Sat May 16 18:35:10 2015 UTC,Where are you from?

UTAustin,365j3k,drang55,3,Sat May 16 13:07:24 2015 UTC,"ok, since I am originally from India (though I did not go to Undergrad in the US, came for grad school) the one thing I really think you need to know is that the scoring in a course is much more spread out. Unlike back home, you cannot just spend the last two weeks and put in 100 hours/ week to manage it (which is what a lot of us did). My experience is from TA-ing multiple courses in physics as a grad student here. good luck!"
UTAustin,365j3k,drang55,1 point,Sat May 16 13:59:44 2015 UTC,"Hahahah yeah, I'm so happy it's that way in the US!"
UTAustin,3651x4,yoohoooos,10,Sat May 16 05:22:21 2015 UTC,Depends entirely on the class and how hard you work.  This is too general of a question.
UTAustin,3651x4,brazilianbunny,-3,Sat May 16 05:34:44 2015 UTC,For upper class. Would this help?
UTAustin,3651x4,brazilianbunny,2,Sat May 16 05:45:45 2015 UTC,Do you know what specific classes you would be taking?  I could give some insight since I'm graduating from CNS next week.
UTAustin,3651x4,Filthy_Fil,2,Sat May 16 05:49:24 2015 UTC,Congrat. Which major? PHY315 316 M325 CH320M 353 Thanks a lot
UTAustin,3651x4,kazaanabanana,1 point,Sat May 16 05:57:57 2015 UTC,"Pet E. Since I'm a transfer, so I already have most of the classes that will go toward the plan, and I won't be able to take any engineering class. So for engineering physics, they allow CNS student take it?"
UTAustin,3651x4,HaziqQ,1 point,Sat May 16 08:57:46 2015 UTC,Some people have a hard time with ch320M. If you keep up with the work it shouldn't be too bad though. I managed to get an A just fine. I haven't taken any of the other classes.

UTAustin,35z5my,olliegee,7,Thu May 14 20:48:04 2015 UTC,"Get Grande if you can. If not, I went with Time Warner because I use a metric fuckton of data and they have unlimited data. I'm pretty sure AT&T lets you use your own modem and router, but I know for a fact that Time Warner does."
UTAustin,35z5my,olliegee,2,Thu May 14 20:18:08 2015 UTC,"Time Warner it will be then. Can you comment on the quality of their service? I had them in Durham, NC when I studied in the US for a brief period...they are utter shit. The service went off and on at random days. Called and they blamed my modem, which was rented from them. Then again, they do have a monopoly over the town, so I hope it's different when facing the incoming threat of fiber.  Edit:Thanks! It's sad that I'm moving from a country with a per capita income of US$2000 (vs your US$48000 income) and there actually is a hight chance my Internet will be slower in the US. Freedom is never free."
UTAustin,35z5my,dbzfanjake,4,Thu May 14 20:48:40 2015 UTC,"For me, service does cut out occasionally, but not very often (maybe once every month), and usually it's only out for a few minutes or so. And I'm sure customer service is just as infuriating here as it is in NC. They did recently just give everybody a speed boost to try and compete with fiber, but it wasn't that great and I'm still gonna go with fiber when it comes to my neighborhood."
UTAustin,35z5my,auricchemist,3,Thu May 14 21:37:25 2015 UTC,"I'm using Time Warner's basic connection (which is free for me). Just ran speedtest and got 10 Mb/s down and 10 up (fluctuates down to 3 Mb/s down sometimes). Never goes out and is pretty consistent. I also live by myself and only use one device at a time though. Good enough for netflix streaming and such. Used my own cheap router. Edit: Also, use your own router/modem. The ones they provide are usually shit for how much they charge you to rent them and are more prone to security flaws/ outdated firmware and such. Buy a cheap one from Bestbuy, amazon or such for $30-20"
UTAustin,35z5my,Furyhunter,2,Thu May 14 23:05:50 2015 UTC,I've had a surprisingly good experience with time Warner. I'm paying about $35 a month for 50mbps in west campus and I almost always get that. My wifi is utterly useless but that's just because of the number of routers in the surrounding buildings. I've always had decent speeds wired.

I believe any time you fall below the 2.0 GPA, you're automatically put on scholastic probation which is just a warning and if you don't pick up your GPA you're subject to dismissal. These sites don't really explain that though."
UTAustin,35zxqy,emt92,2,Thu May 14 23:14:54 2015 UTC,"I was put on probation after my first semester as a transfer. They should offer you probation and a grade contract. Pull it together next semester, and take advantage of the extra help they will offer you. That kind of problem doesn't just fix itself."
UTAustin,35zxqy,kissedandoften,2,Fri May 15 04:53:40 2015 UTC,how did you get in with a 3.37 gpa in the first place?

UTAustin,35zxqy,roman_desailles,1 point,Sat May 16 21:30:51 2015 UTC,"I was put on probation twice at UT (transfer student with awesome community college GPA). You just have to get through it. They offer programs to help you get your GPA back up and everything. It is hard and really stressful to be teetering on the edge of that 2.0.   I struggled with it for my first two years at UT. My GPA is still awful but I moved out of my party building and started studying a lot more and now I have made mostly all B's since I was last put on probation. I feel your pain but unfortunately there isn't much you can do about it except work your ass off next semester to get your GPA above a 2.0; I recommend signing up for classes you think you'd be good at, even if they don't necessarily count for anything."
UTAustin,35zxqy,meeps626,1 point,Fri May 15 15:31:53 2015 UTC,"I know what this feels like. I transferred here with a 4.0, I could barely get a 2.0 my first semester and then I took 15+ hours the next semester with really hard courses trying to restore my gpa. I was dismissed and tried to appeal. The people at the liberal arts office basically told me don't hold your breath. What you can do is, if this is your first dismissal, sit it out. Go to ACC do REALLY well in easy courses..or if you have the money for it ,do an online extension course or two. My mentor told me that it looks really great when you come back and you have either good grades in extension classes(which do count towards your gpa) or you get good grades in community classes because you'll be able to transfer those over and it'll be like you didn't lose that time while you were dismissed."
UTAustin,35zxqy,JanitorinGotham,-5,Tue May 19 19:03:59 2015 UTC,You got in with a 3.37? All you have to do is not fall asleep in class and you can pull a 3.5 in CC. Or were you CAP? Sucks that there are people busting their ass to get a 3.9 at a CC and still getting denied admittance into McCombs and Cockrell but people that can barely pull a few A's get into COLA. Sorry for being a dick but it's the truth.
UTAustin,3606vk,Then_Suddenly,5,Thu May 14 23:59:41 2015 UTC,"I also transferred in with a lot of credits and took the requisite 60 in-house credit hours.  You can either finish your major and then take a bunch of electives or you can do a dual or double major/double minor.  I think it's probably better to get a dual or double, rather than wasting time and money on a bunch of random classes, but it's up to you."
UTAustin,3606vk,prettyslattern,1 point,Fri May 15 06:13:40 2015 UTC,"Thanks for that input. I will probably go the double major route if I must. Does the 60 in-house credits count if I work towards my masters? Sorry to ask such a newb question, but I am new to how real colleges work."
UTAustin,3606vk,prettyslattern,1 point,Fri May 15 17:41:53 2015 UTC,"Nope, it's only applicable towards an Undergrad degree.  But, if you find a professor that you really like, you should talk to them about doing conference courses.  These are self-designed research projects under professor supervision and guidance that you can repeat for credit.  This is great preparation for a Master's and will net you a great professor recommendation for your Grad School application, as most won't do recommendations unless you've done research together.  Advisors won't tell you about these courses for some fucked up reason, so I'm telling you.  They're great and totally worth it if you want to work towards getting published or have a great project to boost your Grad School acceptance efforts."
UTAustin,3606vk,bearfx,1 point,Fri May 15 18:30:58 2015 UTC,That is wonderful advice. I will most definitely be doing that. I'm sad to hear that that type of information is not being shared. I will gladly take note of any other useful advice that you may have for a hopeful transfer student! :)
UTAustin,3606vk,BlueLightSpcl,5,Fri May 15 23:50:45 2015 UTC,"I think that is more to save you time than saying you won't get in.  UT requires that 60 credit hours be completed in house for any 4 year degree.  If you have 90 hours, you are basically going to have to complete 30ish more credit hours of classes to get a degree at UT than if you stayed at another university.  I transferred in 160ish credit hours.  Had to complete 60 hours at UT, including a complete BS class called UGS 301..."
UTAustin,3606vk,BlueLightSpcl,2,Fri May 15 00:10:17 2015 UTC,"And I am okay with that. The school that I was attending was not my choice school and I don't feel like I really learned from them. If I have to take more credits, I will gladly do that.  Anyways, thank you for your comment! So they allowed you in with 160 credits? That calms me a bit to know that. Thank you again for your input!"

Everything was pretty simple, and I'm in-state. However being a transfer student can be especially lonely at ut unless you know you're the type of person who can be outgoing and make friends. You will need to try very hard to do that if you don't already have friends here."
UTAustin,35w5lp,frippere,2,Thu May 14 09:09:43 2015 UTC,Yeah I don't really agree with this. I was pretty antisocial before coming to UT and had no problems making friends. It's as easy as anything else. Just talk to people the first day of class.

Keep in mind that the transfer process is only concerned with your collegiate work and not what was done in high school, so the high test scores and grades, impressive as they may be, won't have any bearing on a potential transfer.  You can find some extensive information directly on Cockrell's website regarding their transfer statistics."
UTAustin,35wsmz,exclusionaryrule,3,Thu May 14 04:01:59 2015 UTC,You won't know until after you graduate. Actual honors graduates aren't calculated until after we all walk. So I guess you'll know when you get your diploma?
UTAustin,35wsmz,wavesandtide,2,Thu May 14 05:29:57 2015 UTC,"Here are the minimums: http://catalog.utexas.edu/general-information/academic-policies-and-procedures/honors/graduation-with-university-honors/  The actual GPAs needed are recomputed each May to match up with the percentages, which stay the same.  Different colleges do it differently, but here's info from Engineering: ""During the graduation ceremony we will announce tentative honors based on your current in-residence GPA. These honors will not include any current semester grades and will be subject to adjustment after all grades have been posted. Official honors will be calculated at the end of the semester to include final grades. """

UTAustin,35ulnq,exe163,9,Wed May 13 17:17:56 2015 UTC,"This sounds like an ideal question for the guy in the transportation department that you talked to already.  Ask if he knows of any lots where this will not happen or if he has any other advice.  Or maybe call up the UT parking enforcement people and ask them, see what they suggest.  Certainly, if your car gets towed and you don't even learn about it for two months ... the storage fees will be massive and they may not even be able to reach you to tell you that they have your car."

UTAustin,35ulnq,IronPat,5,Wed May 13 17:33:10 2015 UTC,"It would be ideal if a friend can move it for you during the summer in case of an event. Not only to avoid being towed, but it is not good to leave your car sitting that long. Try to get someone to take it for a spin every other week to keep the engine lubricated, and the battery charged. Cars need to stretch as well."
UTAustin,35ulnq,dougmc,1 point,Wed May 13 18:24:20 2015 UTC,"Really, with such a friend, just see if he can park it at his friend's place.  Perhaps it's a friend who doesn't own a car and rarely needs one, but his apartment comes with a parking spot that he can use and would appreciate having access to a car for a few things in exchange for taking care of it.  The engine will be fine after sitting for a few months, but the battery may die.  Years will be bad on the tires and hoses, but a few months are fine.  But the battery ... if it's not disconnected (the car tends to drain it very slowly) or the car isn't driven occasionally, it'll probably be dead.    A small solar panel can be put on the dash and wired to the battery (often via the cigarette lighter, if it's one that has power even with the key off) to keep the battery charged, if he wants to go that route."
UTAustin,35ulnq,cmh2548,1 point,Thu May 14 04:34:13 2015 UTC,"I'll go look for said friend. However, I drive a manual. That limits the number of people I can lend it to.   I am not too worried about the battery."
UTAustin,35ulnq,cmh2548,2,Thu May 14 12:57:16 2015 UTC,"Summer is baseball/softball season so you'll be more likely to need to move your vehicle from over there. I'd suggest looking at a garage pass. More expensive than a surface lot but it'll be less than $200. Depending on if you'll be back in time for the first football game, the ones on the outskirt of campus will be your best bet (GUG, SAG, TSG). Send an email to parking and they should be able to assist you in where exactly to park (plus you have a paper trail should you get a ticket for parking where they told you it'd be okay)."
UTAustin,35ulnq,GGTX,1 point,Wed May 13 21:58:52 2015 UTC,Which garage specifically are you referring to? The ones I see cannot be parked 24/7.
UTAustin,35ulnq,GGTX,1 point,Thu May 14 12:12:28 2015 UTC,All of them offer overnight parking. You buy an S permit then stop by the office to purchase storage. Look on your parking profile to see which summer garages have spots and call them directly. I'd recommend calling before 3 as students take over then and can give out wrong info.
UTAustin,35uiyb,zestanye,4,Wed May 13 16:57:26 2015 UTC,I know that a lot of people are actually selling their graphing calculators as the school ends. I remember coming across an ad on the UT buy/sell facebook page for pretty cheap. If you couldn't find one you could go there and take a look.

If it's too late for this summer, you'll probably still have basics left until your junior or senior year depending on how you schedule things. If you've got time in future summers, you can always look into the community college thing again."

UTAustin,35t7am,Pmastablasta,1 point,Wed May 13 18:14:06 2015 UTC,Yeah I was referring to that using their services to look for apartments is free. You don't have to pay the realtor for their time helping you. My realtor told us that they receive a part of the application fee and a part of the initial deposit as commission.

The motorcycle dude cut me off (he was literally several inches in front of me!) so the pack can get ahead of everyone else.  I high-beamed him to get his ass off my bumper.  The motorcycle dude was stupid enough to ride with one hand and look back at me while going 75.  They were doing close to 80 in the 55 construction zone.  Jerks.  Most of the plates were vanity license plates, with what sounded like Middle Eastern last names.  Then they took an exit close to campus.  I wonder if this is them....maybe or maybe not."

UTAustin,35oxq0,prettyslattern,4,Thu May 14 15:06:36 2015 UTC,"No, there's no hope of this happening right now or in your immediate future.  Here's why.  You are 19 and unless you can get your family to sign off on your student aid and loans, you can't apply for them yourself until you're 24.  You probably cannot afford to pay out of pocket for school AND pay rent, bills, gas, food, etc. on the meager salary that 19-year-old you is going to be able to command.  My advice would be to enroll at TCC and complete your core classes there via an associate's degree.  Get straight fucking A's, take honors classes, and join extracurricular groups to pad out your UT application.  You will be charged hefty out-of-state tuition if you're accepted at UT, so it might be a good idea to move here the year before you plan to apply.  Be aware that you are nowhere near being financially ready to move here.  $1500 might get you into an apartment, but that's it.  And if you have no credit or rental history, you'll have to have your parents co-sign."
UTAustin,35oxq0,prettyslattern,3,Tue May 12 17:45:46 2015 UTC,"I'm located very close to OCCC (Oklahoma City Community College). Could I attend there instead of TCC? And as far as I know, an associate's degree takes two years. Did you mean that I finish those two years first, move to Austin and work for a year, and then transfer to UT?"
UTAustin,35oxq0,_edd,2,Tue May 12 18:45:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, whatever community college is closest to you is fine.  And yes, an associate's degree takes two years, which will cover all of your core classes.  Just get the degree plans online for the degrees you think you're interested in at UT and tick off the lower-division and core classes as you go.  You will have to take 60 hours in residence at UT, but you can transfer in with as many credits as you like.  Not all of them will be applied, but most of them will be.  And yes, I think you should start there, then move to Austin to establish residency, and transfer in to UT.  You could go to ACC here in Austin, but you would also have to pay out of state fees and don't get much in the way of financial aid since it's a community college.  You want to try and do the first two years on the cheap, because the second 2-3 years are going to be kind of expensive.  The last thing you want is to graduate in mountains of debt.  Alternately, if you have any friends who want to move down, you could save up between you and move here together.  Establish residency for a year and go to ACC once you qualify for in-state tuition."
UTAustin,35oxq0,prettyslattern,2,Tue May 12 19:05:01 2015 UTC,"You've got a few mistakes in your comment. Students under can receive loans through financial aid, however it is usually a smaller amount. My financial aid covered my tuition fully without any parent loans. However this was in state and not out of state tuition.  Second, parents are no longer necessary to receive financial aid once a student turns 23."

Once you're cleared to register, you can actually add and drop classes every single orientation session throughout the summer. It's always on a Wednesday or something.   They only partially open classes so you can continue to try and register all throughout the summer."
UTAustin,35lpbc,dontforgethetrailmix,2,Wed May 13 20:46:55 2015 UTC,Always register for classes as early as possible because the classes you want will likely fill up quickly. Look for other classes you need other than your expected AP credits. Seeing your UT advisor as soon as possible will also help
UTAustin,35kegk,lmazo,8,Mon May 11 05:15:56 2015 UTC,"to add on, most people find it ideal to have classes slotted back to back since putting a 1 hour gap between class is pretty useless (except for lunch) and you won't really accomplish much during that period, effectively wasting an hour. Plus, putting classes back-to-back tends to reduce your urge to skip a class. 10 minutes should generally be enough to walk to your back-to-back classes."
UTAustin,35kegk,Canaloupes,7,Mon May 11 05:45:35 2015 UTC,"Hour-long classes typically only last for 50 minutes and 90-minute classes typically last for 75 minutes, so you'll be okay. As long as there is no direct overlap between times of two of your desired courses, you're fine."

UTAustin,35cn80,nakon,1 point,Sat May 9 07:12:23 2015 UTC,How does petitioning the department work? Any advice on what they look for in an appeal?
UTAustin,35cn80,Ayyra421,5,Mon May 25 00:24:23 2015 UTC,"Some advice from someone someone who dropped out of UT while entry level and still got promoted once they returned and raised their actually abysmal gpa up over a 2.0, get to work on your finals and keep yourself too busy too worry about it.  I imagine you haven't taken all of your finals yet. Start studying for them and don't mope about your gpa. A 3.1 isn't bad at all and still keeps a ton of doors open. Getting below a 3.0 is where it becomes really difficult. Get below a 2.5 and most universities won't even let you transfer in. Obviously that negativity probably isn't what you want to hear, but you are at a point where you really have an opportunity to keep your gpa where it needs to be to open doors up and you really should make the most of it. The best thing you can do is to study your ass off for finals and get whatever points you can.  UT's CS program has fluctuated a ton over the last 4 years on their admissions standards. They've gone from incredibly easy to get into, to one semester as damn near impossible to get into and regressed back towards the middle. Just because you've done poorly doesn't necessarily mean its the end of CS for you. Talk to the advisors. If anyone has answer, its them. This includes what majors you qualify to transfer into as well if that's the path you take. If there are any additional entry level CS courses you can take (or retake) or if there is any way they can factor in your outside gpa or other classes (AP CS credits counted as something like a 3 or 3.5 and I want to say calculus or matrices could have factored in as well but I'm not sure), then maybe you've got another shot at the CS track."
UTAustin,35cn80,not_a_cs_asshole,4,Sat May 9 07:48:41 2015 UTC,I went to RTF when I failed out of CS. They have a ton of technical programs that are perfect for a CS mindset.
UTAustin,35cn80,drang55,1 point,Sat May 9 04:07:29 2015 UTC,"The entry level CS classes are already a lot easier than they should be (they don't weed out enough people). CS is probably not for you, just do a ton of general classes and try to get an idea of what you want to do."
UTAustin,35cn80,Ayyra421,13,Sat May 9 04:47:07 2015 UTC,"You got to be kidding me. The difficulty of entry cs classes varies wildly.   Some are easy yes, depending on the professor. But its a goddamn fact that  data structures and especially discrete math in the department are not standardized and the content and level of difficulty differs from  professor to professor. Its luck of the draw,  if you are not aware of who to take.  I love our department, but a huge portion of you kids are entitled and arrogant.

CS 312 use to be called CS 305J and didn't even count toward the major.  CS 314 used to be the first course, called CS 307. The CS department has caused a lot of its enrollment woes by making what is little more than a programming course count now.  This is the second time now that the CS department has lowered standards on the 1st course - CS 307 used to be taught in Haskell and was like Berkeley's CS61A.  (This was before 2001.)"

There are several bar scenes to choose from (most prominent are ""dirty 6th"" downtown = the more rowdy/college scene and Rainey St. = the more ""hip"" scene). Lots of great craft breweries in the area including Live Oak, (512), Jester King,  and more.

There is seriously a major music event every few months with SXSW being the biggest. Bands are always coming through, the music scene here is awesome to say the least. I come from Houston which has a fairly weak scene compared to here, and I don't think I will ever go back. I know music isn't a huge thing to everyone, but it is definitely one of the big plus's about Austin that will keep me here for a while. That and tacos for sure."
UTAustin,35djzo,nivadia274,3,Sun May 10 20:09:22 2015 UTC,"UT is a school of 50k kids.  Now there are advantages and disadvantages to that, but it does mean that anything you're interested in, specifically in CS or not, there will be others who are as well.  Want to learn rock-climbing? There's a club for that.  Want to help the faculty build autonomous robot guides for the CS building? There's undergraduate research opportunities.  Want to grab some friends and see some big name music act? There's music happening all the time.  I'm an out of state student, so I understand your questions.  I'd never been to Texas or anywhere really in the south, so coming here was a big culture shock.  ""Southern hospitality"" is a very real thing, BBQ is as good as people say, and you haven't tried food until you've eaten it fried at the state fair.  Everyone here is proud of the fact that they live in Texas, and I think that's awesome.  Coming to UT, I knew nobody, and yet I've found many close friends.  I strongly encourage you to come visit.  I don't know when your deadline is, but if possible I would suggest visiting when school is happening.  It helped me in my school decision.  I was also between UCSD and UT, and I visited both and felt that UT was right for me.  Also, shameless plug for UT Ambassadors, we're a group of CS students who put on tours and campus visits specifically for CS Majors.  If you still have the fall to decide, I highly recommend taking one to get a feel for UTCS specifically.  Good luck with your college decision!"
UTAustin,35djzo,megabox,1 point,Sat May 9 17:32:16 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately I've got until June 1st to decide between UT and UCSD. It's crazy that you decided between the same, though! I visited UCSD and up until I got my UT admission, I was set on UCSD. I hear that there's plenty to do around the area -- surfing, good Mexican food, outdoors activities, and some concerts. In comparison, it's more down-in-the-books academic though. Apparently people don't socialize much outside of student orgs and the CS community. I'm interested in being inspired academically by people from all fields, and having some incentive to finish work early to live up UT and Austin as a whole. But how realistic is that? Do UTCS students spend most of their time in CS labs anyway?  EDIT: do you know of tours going on outside of school session, if I were to visit in the weekend of 5/23-24?"
UTAustin,35djzo,bman5252,2,Sun May 10 07:59:11 2015 UTC,"If I'm being honest, the school here is whatever you want it to be.  There are CS students who are dead set on doing CS work, and spend a lot of time in the labs.  There are also students who work with other departments, whether through research, double majoring, or just for fun.  In a school of 50k, you can find your niche that balances school and socializing in the way that's right for you.  I don't spend all my time in the lab, but there are others who do spend a considerable amount of time.  It's really up to you.  I know they do tours and info sessions over the summer, so I would encourage you to check it out.  Compared to UCSD, UT's campus is smaller and more urban.  There definitely is a divide between the campus and the city, but the city is right there.  I'm pretty sure there's often more things going on in Austin than La Jolla, in terms of music/events/etc.  At the same time, our campus isn't next to the beach.  It's hard to put a lot of it into words, so I would encourage you to schedule an info session and/or tour.  No school is right for everybody, so getting on campus and getting a feel for it is probably the best way to differentiate between schools with similar academic rankings.  I know they run tours and info sessions during the summer, so hopefully you can find one that fits your schedule (look  here).  Good luck with your decision!"

Austin is an amazing its very much like silicon valley but with a ton more stuff to do. Think mixture of San Fransisco and Palo alto. And with 50k kids your bound to find friends and enjoy your time here. Everyone is super friendly, teachers are awesome I would HIGHLY recommend it. I cannot see myself being happier anywhere else.

UTAustin,357tc0,hill-cw,5,Fri May 8 07:18:01 2015 UTC,"Echo what everyone else has already said. I have a CS professor that specifically says no laptops/tablets in lecture, he wants people to really focus on the concepts and being able to produce code without the machine in front of you. I have mixed feelings about his policy despite understanding the different angles hes coming for, some of them quite valid and useful. That said I take all my notes on my tablet with a pen. I'm the only person I've seen him let get away with it but I speak up a lot and sit in the front of the class, so I think he realizes I'm genuinely just using it as a digital paper notebook rather than playing with code and/or goofing or or losing focus during lecture.  I guess my point with that anecdote was most professors will see you for you doing the right things if you are doing the right thing to learn and will be flexible even when they say they aren't. And if you find any exceptions, I'll echo what everyone said about the SSD, that's where I'm going to go if any teacher ever tries to not let me use my tablet that way in class. (It still blows my mind taking all your notes on a tablet is not standard or at least more widespread in classes.)"

UTAustin,357tc0,lolwhatathrowback,3,Fri May 8 08:17:20 2015 UTC,"It's certainly a case-by-case basis, but in general the larger the lecture is, the less professors will care about or notice laptops/digital devices, and even in small classes a lot of professors are fine with students using laptops to take notes. There are exceptions of course, but for those smaller courses if the use of technology isn't covered in the syllabus, go ahead and talk to your professors about it on the first day of class. (It's a good idea to go up and talk to your professors and go to office hours anyways, just to earn brownie points and enable them to get to know you as an individual.) The majority of professors will be fine with you using a laptop when they hear your case, but in the rare exception that one isn't, get in touch with SSD, UT's services for students with disabilities program. They will certainly side with you when a professor fails to do so."

UTAustin,350tda,kawangkoankid,3,Wed May 6 03:57:54 2015 UTC,UFCU is awesome. I've banked with them for years.  You pretty much can't go wrong with any credit union.
UTAustin,350tda,prettyslattern,2,Wed May 6 17:27:11 2015 UTC,"If you do need to hold a balance, the interest rates are far below what you'd pay for any other credit card, relative to your credit standing.  My interest rate is only 5.9%, which I think is impossible to match at any for-profit credit card issuer. Also, the transaction fees for foreign use and cash advances are superior."
UTAustin,350tda,hiccupeater,2,Wed May 6 18:16:32 2015 UTC,"tl;dr - If you absolutely must carry a balance or absolutely must make cash advances against your credit card, then they aren't bad. Otherwise, you're better off looking elsewhere.  Their interest rates seem better than most. Their rewards programs don't look particularly interesting. Cash advance fees are a bit less than most. Foreign transaction fee is better than some as well.  On interest rates and cash advances... If you find yourself carrying a balance or needing to use cash advances on a non-emergency basis (and I mean real emergencies), you are much better off making lifestyle adjustments such that you don't put yourself in that position. Or, just get a debit card (overdraft fees/penalties are going to be cheaper than a lifetime of credit card interest debt). As such, I actually don't weigh either of these as factors when looking at cards.  Many cards offer no foreign transaction fees. All Capital One cards, for example. Discover as well (but almost nobody outside the US accepts them - as has been my experience traveling in Asia and several western European countries).  That leaves the rewards. 1 travel point per $1 spent is pretty typical. Just about travel rewards card will offer that. The airline-specific miles programs (and cards) can generally be redeemed for better returns. And the tiered cash back card is worse than most others. You have to spend $3000 just to start getting 1% cash back (which amounts to $15 cash back on the first $3000 you spend, and then it's 1% for everything you spend over $3k). Most cash back cards offer at least 1% with no minimum spending requirement. Rotating bonus categories can go up to 5% on some cards. There are also cards that give a flat 1.5% or 2% cash back with no minimum spending (if you don't want to keep track of the categories)."
UTAustin,350tda,mrflarp,1 point,Thu May 7 05:46:58 2015 UTC,"I was with UFCU for about ten years.  They have great rates.  I would say they are better than every other credit union I looked at for rates, especially auto loans, and worse than every other credit union I have looked at for service, partly due to the use of terminals or ATMs inside their branches so their in person customer service is limited to a loan officer. That loan officer will look for a way to make money off you, and if they can't, they will usually insist on you using one of the ATMs sitting where a teller used to work.  I recall trying to deposit a very large check that I wanted a human being to handle.  The loan officer would not do it, so I opened an account with Chase and have been  lot happier.  I had the UFCU rewards card and it had an excellent interest rate, and they gave the card to me when I was young and had very little credit history.  If you're a student with a little income, this is a great deal.  If you don't plan to carry a balance, keep in mind that Chase, AMEX, Discover, and Barclays all offer rewards programs that are far far far far better.  Also remember that UFCU is in the profit business.  They say they are non profit, but they make millions and are ruthless about firing staff and exploiting tax laws from an era when credit unions were not just retail banks by another name.  Chase treats me so much better, and they all know my name and use good customer service.  If you insist on a credit union (I have no idea what some do that), then RBFCU is a better long term alternative once you're away from campus."

I wasn't at UT at the time and didn't know what I was going to try to get into UT with, so I took DiffEQ. The professor, Burtch, I HIGHLY recommend. He really cared for the students and made the class very interesting; he actually made it seem a bit philosophical. After DiffEQ, I took Burtch again for Calc III and ended up making a 103 on the final. He is a very good prof. That being said, stay away from McCarthy.  I don't know how accurate this is, but while I was taking it, I heard from UT students that it was actually more difficult at ACC - we had huge homework assignments as well as 3 projects throughout the course. Projects may sound frightening for upper math, but they were so rewarding. I learned more from those projects than from the homework. Now, I can actually use my DiffEQ knowledge in unexpected ways.  I enjoyed taking it there, as I was experimenting with classes to decide on a major, so I took DiffEQ as a ""hell, let's see how I do in upper math classes."" I enjoyed the class so much that now I'm a math major at UT.  Tl;dr - don't expect an easy A at ACC with DiffEQ, it's actually quite demanding. Burtch is awesome, get into his class."

Verifying proof of enrollment, GPA, and highest degree earned (or level of education completed) are about all anybody looks at. And that's only in absence of actual relevant work experience. After graduation, once you have a year or two of relevant work experience, nobody will ever look at your transcript again."

UTAustin,34wet1,thurst31,6,Tue May 5 02:50:59 2015 UTC,"West Campus is by far more convenient.  What type of person are you? When are your classes next semester? If you're the type of person who rolls out of bed at 2pm 5 minutes before class -- living in Riverside might hurt your grades if it'll affect attendance. And what good is saved rent money if you end up doing poorly or even failing?  Then again, if you like to study Friday and Saturday nights at home, West campus isn't so good either.  I lived in West Campus for 2 years, and I commute now from North Austin. If you drive, parking's a bitch, long walk too. If you take the bus, you lose control of time to a certain extent. West Campus is also very social. You're always running into people as you walk home.   I'd say Riverside if you know you're going to get up on time to go to class. Or if you never go to class too. Maybe if you have a solid friend group too, and are not looking to be more social. Being far away from campus makes a bigger difference than you'd think. But riverside is also a lot cheaper -- and if you taking student loans, you don't want to make those worse.  I'd say West Campus, but I don't know your financial situation -- and that makes a difference."
UTAustin,34wet1,crankychopsticks,2,Tue May 5 03:50:13 2015 UTC,"West Campus is convenient, expensive, loud, and parking is spotty and also expensive. It's also more of a walking neighbourhood, if you're into that.  Riverside is cheap, not exactly quiet by certainly less loud, better parking, and not very gentrified. Living there without a car is terrible, but do-able. It takes somewhere between 15 to 30 minutes to get to/from campus without a car, and much, much longer if you're trying to get anywhere on Saturday."
UTAustin,34wet1,meanderling,2,Tue May 5 16:58:15 2015 UTC,Getting to campus by car is a hassle (and parking is expensive) so bus/biking/walking is the best way to go.  Getting to campus without a car is easiest when you live in West Campus as opposed to Riverside which is largely full of car-dependent suburban sprawl
UTAustin,34wet1,audiomuse1,4,Wed May 6 03:31:25 2015 UTC,If you can travel easily then Riverside is the safest bet. Living in west campus can be very annoying if you're not involved in greek life. I live in one of the Quarters apartments and greek asshats trash the place every other day and break signs and even the elevators. But if you're into partying or like living close to campus then go for it.

I enjoyed the show more than most people who were there as I really like their albums. Honestly though the ACL festival crowd didn't seem too energized and the sound mixing was ""washed out"" so to speak.  Austin Music Hall is a most hated venue. Just a pain in the ass all the way around from parking to long beer lines to jostling to be able to actually see the stage. The acoustics in there are just horrid since the remodel unless you are dead center upstairs balcony. Never fails when we try to get tickets last minute from scalpers half our group gets floor and half gets balcony which further complicates things. Anyway, BAD venue but GREAT band!"

Within the music building I knew everyone, but once I walked 5 minutes across campus, I was anonymous. I loved having both experiences.   Being a little fish was good for me, and working my way up was a huge accomplishment. I would not trade my experiences for any other school. You should consider going to the summer camp. I'm pretty sure you would be in the top group as an all stater and would get to work with Professor Junkin. He changed my life, and it would give you an idea of what to expect."

UTAustin,34ootg,BEARS_ARE_GREAT,2,Mon May 4 05:29:01 2015 UTC,I was a clarinet major last year. Dr. Williams is an excellent professor and you'll learn a lot from him. Within the studio there's definitely a lot of competition for the top ensemble spots. We had a a good number of masters and doctoral students so it's very possible that you may not make wind ensemble your very first semester. The wind symphony is still great though! Let me know if you've got any more questions.
UTAustin,34ootg,BEARS_ARE_GREAT,1 point,Sun May 3 12:29:04 2015 UTC,"I have a few questions:  I do understand that my first semester, I won't be in the top band. Do you believe you had good opportunities after the first semester/year to play in the top band?  Do you think you were well-taught/prepared?   How was the audition process like for you? Did you have to send in a video audition or can I just drive up there to do it? With who?   At The Butler School did you feel like a number or a student there to learn? (If that makes any sense)  About how many people are in the music program at UT?"
UTAustin,34ootg,BEARS_ARE_GREAT,2,Sun May 3 20:53:50 2015 UTC,"I made wind symphony my first semester and it was an amazing experience. There wasn't an audition for the top band second semester because the wind ensemble went on a world tour that summer (last summer). They don't really do in lesson work for auditions- that's on you to practice and apply what you've learned. We did have a freshman though in the studio who made wind ensemble and went on the world tour.  And ha, I actually left after my freshman year. Music performance wasn't for me.  The audition process just comes with the application. There's no pre-screening- just sign up for an audition date and show up on that day. Dr. Williams and a bunch of students in the studio will listen to your audition.  Within the clarinet studio, Dr. Williams definitely cares a lot for all his students and lessons can be pretty personal. You'll learn so much. He puts a lot of effort into all his students so be prepared to be pushed. Theory and piano classes are pretty small so if you're having any trouble you can get in contact with your professors or TA's no problem. You're absolutely not just a number in BSoM.  UT's a huge school but it'll feel pretty small in the music building.  I do not know how many people are in the entire music program but you can find that online or by calling them. Hope this helped. If you're looking to go into performance, I really do recommend UT. Even though, I'm not pursuing performance anymore I can assure you so many people find success at UT and have gone on to really famous schools for further education or professional playing."

I am really interested and I am wondering if you got any spots for undergrads?"". Since you're an undergrad, they should assume you have no previous experience.   You should definitely ask the professor what you will be doing in the lab. If you get a spot, they will assign you to a grad student, who will tell you what you will actually be doing. That's kinda what happened to me.   All the professors I mentioned above are actively researching something related to bioengineering."

They pair you up with a grad student doing research in a field you're interested in (so it kind of takes the work away from that), and it also gives you a really great opportunity to talk to their supervising professors and potentially stay working in their lab after the GLUE semester is over."

Just SSH into one of the lab machines, navigate to (or create) your ~/public_html directory, and place all of your files in there! Keep in mind that file permissions will need to be set appropriately (world-readable, NOT world-writable) and that any space you use there will count against your 2 GB quota.

As a freshman and female (I was usually the only one, maybe two others at the most), I found the experience patronizing and unpleasant.  I'm now a senior in euro studies and french (by way of international relations). I love it, but it's a better fit for me because I'm into culture studies and want to travel."

In regards to how close it is, it just depends on where you are going in UT, I walk all the way to the far corner of Engineering which is probably the farthest part of campus away from 21Rio and it only takes me about 10-15 minutes to get there.   Out of all the apartments I have been to, this one definitely is the quietest from the way it was built so you dont need to worry about noisy neighbors like in some other places. Overall I really like this place because of the convenience and location. If you are looking for a quiet place to sleep but an easy place to walk to the nearest party, this would be a great place.

If you implement the time management and study habits that work for you, you'll come out with a great grade and a great understanding.  One additional thing that I've found helpful for me: pre-prepping for a course. The UT has a huge library, so I like checking out an algebra textbook before taking calculus and working through some problems from each section, etc. You can do this with almost any math/science course, and I find it helps the pace from being overwhelming when you start the semester because you're fresh on the material and also have been practicing your study habits."

Don't shy away from unpaid ones either; especially as a freshman or sophomore.

It wasn't exactly easy, but if you studied a moderate amount, getting an A is possible.  I know everyone hates Saxena, I think the most common complaint was that he doesn't care about his students. My friend had to drop his class after failing the first two tests and when she went to get his approval for the drop he laughed at her…  There was another professor during that time who gave almost everyone in their class As. I don't remember their name. I know they had tenure, so they didn't really care either but rather than failing everyone, they gave out As. Down side is that if you actually want to learn genetics, you won't learn anything in that class."

UTAustin,34c8sg,ReadThat14,5,Thu Apr 30 01:05:51 2015 UTC,"rather have four exams in two days than an 8 AM three times a week, but hey, that's just me"
UTAustin,34c8sg,ReadThat14,5,Thu Apr 30 01:06:25 2015 UTC,Grouped finals will make for a miserable couple of weeks.  8 AMs will make for a miserable semester.   I'm inclined to agree.
UTAustin,34c8sg,kazaanabanana,0,Thu Apr 30 01:11:48 2015 UTC,Guess it depends on your schedule. I can easily avoid TTh 2:00–3:30 pm and MWF 3:00–4:00 pm so I'm not stuck on campus until DEC 15th.
UTAustin,34c8sg,ColinHanks,1 point,Thu Apr 30 01:51:37 2015 UTC,"ha , i have classes both those times!"
UTAustin,34c8sg,JustAnotherRedditeer,6,Thu Apr 30 02:29:01 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if this is good advice in the grand scheme of things. Two finals in a single day was never a problem for me as long as I planned accordingly.   I think it is much more important to choose classes you are interested in than to assure that you only have a final every other day.   When you put things in perspective it is more important that you choose classes you will attend and pay attention to than classes with exams far apart -- it does not matter how spread out your exam schedule is if you did not pay attention to personally unappealing subject matter in class, and you have all semester (or at least all the time after spring break) to study for finals.  Preparation and interest are far more important than any exam schedule!"
UTAustin,34c8sg,dbzfanjake,2,Fri May 1 05:46:50 2015 UTC,"My priority is to get done with finals as early as possible. Some people may prefer other plans. You may not even care. But it's important to at least know that the finals schedule is published this far in advance, so you can consider it just as you would the professor's reviews, the course content, the time of day of the class, etc.  For example, I could take a Number Theory class at 3 pm with a solid professor and have a Dec 15th final, or I could take it at 10 am with a solid professor and have a Dec 10th final. Just one factor to consider."

UTAustin,34c66o,azncommie97,2,Wed Apr 29 23:48:02 2015 UTC,"Hi :) it's a very new program so not a lot of us have gone through it, but I can tell you to be prepared to do a lot. The first level classes aren't too bad, but once you get to workshops it's pretty brutal. In the fiction one you'll write two 8-12 page short stories while also reading 2 of your peer's papers+marking them up+ writing a critique on them per class period.  Literature for writers has a very low workload, 3-4 stories at 5ish pages each and you read 4 books. I haven't taken any poetry classes yet so I cannot speak to them.   I'm an English major so my perception of what's a lot and what isn't when it comes to reading loads is a little skewed, but at 14 hours you won't have a problem. I was at 17 when I took the workshop and still slipped by with a b+"
UTAustin,34c66o,Lochbessmonster,1 point,Thu Apr 30 07:17:23 2015 UTC,"I've written up to 20 page short stories before (granted, with no deadlines), and certainly not at that pace you described. Just to be clear - you have to write two stories AND critique two peers' papers in one class period? How often do you meet, and how did the application go? Third year EE is when it gets particularly brutal, so the workload does have me a little worried. Then again, I don't exactly plan on graduating in four years, so I have a little more room to space out my classes.  Right now, I'm hoping to take both E316M and TD301 next semester, along with circuit theory and diff eq. I think it's manageable. Do you think it would be worth it to get a hold of the syllabus for American lit and read one or two of the books over the summer?"
UTAustin,34c66o,Lochbessmonster,1 point,Thu Apr 30 14:49:49 2015 UTC,"I would definitely recommend reading the books over the summer just so you're relaxed during the year!  Sorry that I wasn't clear. It was a Tuesday/Thursday class. For the first month or so we'd just read already published short stories and a book by Francine Prose and discuss it while working on our own short story outside of class. We then would have a peer review day on a Tuesday and turn the final draft in Thursday. Every student and the teacher would get a copy, and then you'd assign 2-3 people for every t/th until you finished everyone. The next time you met you were expected to have a typed one page critique and a marked up copy of each of the short stories assigned for that day, and you'd spend the class workshopping the stories. Then you'd do it all again each day until everyone had been worshipped, and you'd all turn in your second stories. Rinse and repeat! I would say outside writing your own story you can expect 3-4 hours a week on critiques? Depending on how quickly you can read.  TD301 is a joke. If you go to class you're pretty much guaranteed an A with minimal effort.   The only real learning curve is that its very different from a stem track since you'll have consistent hw every night. I love the program though, and know that you can always drop the cert if time gets to difficult to come by.  I was in the first wave of applicants for the program, but I don't think the application has changed. It took me about thirty minutes and has a short essay. Super painless and most kids get in-it looks like they're offering s lot more crw classes this year as well so I guess they're taking more than they did before. My semester they took 35 and it was mostly English majors who applied, but now a lot of other majors are popping in."
UTAustin,34d94v,Gonewiththewindow,2,Thu Apr 30 05:28:17 2015 UTC,Hi!  Our office is next door the the COLA course scheduler.  They say: Those classes  are usually taught by Assistant Instructors. They follow a standard syllabus so they could look at a syllabus for this semester for a better idea. There are two new ones so they will just have to wait and see on those.
UTAustin,34d94v,utgi,1 point,Fri May 1 19:43:12 2015 UTC,"It looks like they are on the Department's website: https://www.utexas.edu/cola/depts/english/courses/  Change from Creative Writing to English to view the courses if it starts with CRW. Otherwise the Department has them--they have their offices on the second floor of Calhoun (next to the elevators...you can't miss em), and if you stop by in person they can get you all of the info you need."
UTAustin,34bbjx,PM_ME_SHOES_PLS,2,Wed Apr 29 20:01:51 2015 UTC,"UT doesn't offer a business minor, but rather a Business Foundations certificate. Everything you need to know is available here.  SDS 321 or M 362K will count for the statistics requirement. A lower division CS course will count for the MIS credit. And I believe you can double up the economics credit as well, but you might need to double check on that.  That should leave CS majors only needing to take an additional 15 hours to get the certificate.  Also the CS advisors should be knowledgeable on the matter. I doubt they'll tell you anything that I didn't, but it would be smart to verify everything."
UTAustin,34bbjx,_edd,2,Wed Apr 29 20:56:14 2015 UTC,Looks like your right.
UTAustin,34bbjx,_edd,3,Fri May 1 05:54:58 2015 UTC,I wish I had known this as an undergrad. I needed a minor to complete my degree plan and completed a minor in a foreign language to do so. It was only when I met with an advisor to apply for graduation that he informed me that the BF certificate I completed would have counted as my minor. I suppose that at least I have some extra language skills as a result of my ignorance.  I hope to save any students on reddit in a similar position from the regret I faced at that meeting with my advisor to apply to graduate! I could have graduated a semester earlier had I known and it wouldn't have made a difference to any employer/grad school
UTAustin,34bbjx,ColinHanks,1 point,Fri May 1 05:57:57 2015 UTC,"Texas doesn't offer a business minor, but the Business Foundations Certificate is often described as such.

UTAustin,346m4k,apr_pro,7,Tue Apr 28 18:41:15 2015 UTC,"Switching from CS to ECE will probably not be too difficult. Just make sure to have a good first semester GPA.  If you're more interested in physical computing, then ECE is probably a good fit. Basically ECE is taught from the bottom up, where you learn how transistors work and build up to high level concepts later. In CS, you start out with programming in Java and go down to systems level stuff.  If you're interested in software, you'll want to think about what specifically. If you want to do more low level programming like operating systems, embedded programming, robotics, computer architecture, then choose ECE. If you're more interested in high-level theory or advanced AI concepts, pick CS. There's a lot of overlap between the two though. Both options take operating systems, architecture, data structures, algorithms, etc. And both majors can make web and mobile apps.  But I disagree with /u/yushieboy that CS is more application. ECE students in the software tech core delve into application pretty heavily. You'll have a software lab, where you'll make web or mobile apps. You'll have lots of project based courses where you're implementing real software (and hardware too). Your senior year, you'll do a senior design project partnered with a real company and work with a team like actual industry engineers do. Plus you know hardware too!   ECE and CS both have pretty extensive application stuff. CS may focus on more recent things like how to deal with big data in Hadoop, or how to code in Go or something, but just because that's hot now, doesn't mean you should spend time taking a course on it. It's definitely more important to understand fundamental ideas than some hip new tech trend."
UTAustin,346m4k,Sekrim,6,Tue Apr 28 21:33:57 2015 UTC,"But I disagree with /u/yushieboy that CS is more application.   Definitely. Second semester you're already making a full fledged game on a microcontroller. The application is definitely there, even if you don't start with the best tools."

UTAustin,346m4k,DeltaBurnt,2,Wed Apr 29 04:27:39 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you'd love the Embedded Systems track in ECE, it's all about where the software meets the metal of your circuit. Your first semester you'll make a robot car that drives through an obstacle course (light on programming, heavy on circuitry). In your first software course your final lab will have you making a simple interpreter for a made up programming language. The embedded systems lab has all kinds of cool open ended labs, my friend made his own music player that played Gangnam style and I heard someone else made a Gameboy emulator. Senior design is your final semester where you'll make an actual product for a company or professor and that's very open ended from what I hear. Of course this is all dependent on the professors themselves."

It's two unique ways to learn how to program, but with CS you'll get to apply what you learn immediately into something practical. CE definitely delves into Computer architecture/embedded systems etc. (depending on your track) with more depth, but it ultimately depends on what you want."

UTAustin,340e0e,Dawskyness,12,Mon Apr 27 14:50:03 2015 UTC,Your counselor is making things up. Then report SSD to a federal authority and then that SSD has to comply. I'm not sure what the right authority is but I can find out if you need.  As long as Texas is a state in the Union then it still has to follow all federal law including Americans with Disability Act. Don't listen to your counselor about this and do your own research on ADA.  It's a tough world for someone with disabilities and the last thing you need is someone discouraging you with made up anecdotes.

UTAustin,33zuvg,NEEDLESSBACON,2,Mon Apr 27 04:56:22 2015 UTC,"I took Sirbu for probability and I thought he was a very nice and approachable professor. I often went to his office hours very frequent and he was very helpful. However, I did find his class challenging and I had to put a lot of effort into it. He doesn't do many examples in class and dwells more on the concepts rather than computational work. So if you're one who learns by seeing examples, Sirbu might not be for you.  I took Luecke for multivariable calculus. He's very straight forward and does plenty of examples in class. His tests were similar to the homeworks and problems he worked in class. So if you do the homework and pay attention in class, you'll most likely do well in his class. I also took Maxwell and found him to be similar to Luecke, although his tests weren't quite as predictable as Luecke's. He's also funny and I found his lectures to be entertaining. I would definitely recommend Luecke and Maxwell."

The largest percent of the band is actually engineering majors. I would definitely try it out for at least the first semester, when classes are easier. Chances are you will see some band kids in your classes, so it'll be easier to form study groups.  Also, since I wasn't a big fan of LHB, I joined the Pep Band (plays at volleyball and basketball games). WAY less of a time commitment, no marching, less strict. The director is really cool. And its a 1hr class. So that's always an option.  There is also a group called the Engineering Chamber Orchestra. Its a student organization of mostly engineers (but anyone can join) where everyone gets split into ensembles based on their musical preferences. You rehearse with your ensemble as much or as little as you guys want, and at the end of the semester there is  performance.  As for non musical groups, there are plenty! I think the main ECE one is IEEE. Here are some more though  If you have any questions, feel free to PM me :)  TL;DR: You should try LHB at least once, but needs the most time. Pep Band is a medium time commitment, and EChO is minimal."

Coming to UT I knew the time commitment for LHB was not something I wanted (ready to focus on academics after not doing that in highschool). I ended up joining pep band though, and have done it for 6 semesters. It really is a great org if you're looking for a relaxed place to still play your instrument.   You definitely lose a lot of the marching band social stuff being in pep band though, especially if you never did LHB. So if you're into that part of band, consider doing what the above poster said and try LHB."

I've learned that LHB doesn't really take away from your grades. In fact, as a freshmen it helps you learn to manage your time better. It's 2 hours M,T,TH, and then Saturday.  The truth is as long as you stay on top of your studies like anyone else would regardless of being in the band or not, LHB doesn't really interfere at all.   If you love marching/music, and want to get to know a bunch of people inside and outside your major and be a part of something great, it's a great place to be.    If anything, come to band week and audition. By the end of the week, you'll know whether you want to continue or not.

As far as other clubs, it totally depends on what you're interested in. If you like robots, there's the IEEE Robotics and Automation Society. We also have a solar car team. If you like software, try some CS clubs like ACM and MAD.   One thing I'd recommend is joining HKN (the ECE honors frat) as soon as you can if you can. It's a lengthy process, but it's worth it. It looks good on a resume, and it helps to be surrounded by other really smart people. It kind of motivates you to work harder and be as good as your peers."

I'm an Indian student from Austin and I've never experienced any overt racism growing up in Austin and certainly not at the university. The only thing I will say is that UT has kind of an odd culture of sticking to your own race, i.e. Race based sororities/fraternities, cultural groups, theater/dance groups. I think simply because UT is so huge, joining an organization of your own race is an easy way to find common ground with others. I simply combated that by joining a very diverse spirit group, there are a lot of them on campus! And now I interact with people of all races and never ever experience racism on campus."

Reddit does a horrible job of depicting Texas. It's really not as backward as people make it out to be.   I grew up in the city and rural areas.

OP, just so you know, Pintos is a project in CS 439, ""Principles of Computer Systems"". If you could actually do this project coming in as a freshman, I would be amazed.  But to answer your question, you probably don't really need to know much coming in. So long as you are passionate and try things outside of class you'll do great. Just apply what you learn, be curious, and enjoy what you do, and you'll be fine. And enjoy college! The freedom and newness of everything freshman year is a truly wonderful thing."
UTAustin,33ldex,dumebringer,9,Thu Apr 23 15:48:21 2015 UTC,"After reading other replies, I actually do have some suggestions on stuff to start out with: familiarize yourself with the Linux terminal. Just throw Ubuntu onto a virtual machine on your computer, open up its terminal, and learn. See how much you can do with the terminal alone, without a GUI to help you. Learn how to move files around, how to list what files are in the current directory, how to change directories, and how to open a file in a terminal editor (like /u/windowsyou, I also suggest starting with nano). After that, figure out what a ""pipe"" is, and as a starter learn how to use it with the command ""grep"". Learn about file permissions, and how to change them. Learn how hidden files are treated in Linux. Figure out how to tell what processes are running on the machine. Once you have a decent understanding of the above, learn about ssh and scp, and marvel at how incredibly useful these two commands are.  I'm not suggesting that you only use the terminal forever, you can still get plenty of work done with GUI tools, but using the terminal in addition to GUI programs will up your productivity substantially, and the more you play around with it the more you'll get a better feel of what's actually going on in your computer."

UTAustin,33ldex,34215527015,6,Thu Apr 23 17:57:52 2015 UTC,Yes I would highly recommend pintOS
UTAustin,33ldex,cjbest85,2,Thu Apr 23 15:36:18 2015 UTC,"Try a programming language. You'll need to know how to program pretty well going into projects like Pintos, and you don't want to get caught in a group project without having ever reasoned a piece of code through.  For more traditional, commonly used languages, try Python, C, or Java. You'll learn Java in Intro to Programming but honestly I don't recommend it as a first language. C is used starting in the 3rd entry level course, 429. Most languages you'd use in a work situation are like these (by name, the ALGOL family languages).  For functional languages (which are very good at making you think about program structure), Clojure is a good start, then Haskell. Haskell was going to be the primary language at UTCS some 15 years ago, but instead Java was chosen, much to the dismay of famous former faculty member Edsger Dijkstra. Clojure is a Lisp dialect that runs on the Java Virtual Machine, so if you learn Java, you can actually leverage Java code within Clojure.  The first two programming oriented classes, Intro to Programming and Data Structures, are Java."
UTAustin,33ldex,Furyhunter,2,Thu Apr 23 21:45:40 2015 UTC,MIT has open courseware which are free online courses with video lectures. Great way to learn core concepts without spending a dime. Just listening to the lectures was worthwhile to me but the assignments were not easy to complete on my own. The MIT CS opencourseware uses python programming language last time I checked. Python is a fine first language.  Just don't get suckered into buying a super expensive PC or laptop thinking that it is necessary to write good code. Any older reliable laptop in working condition is fine for first and second year coursework you might need to do outside of a lab.

Downside(for Swedish at least) is that it is hard to find fluent speakers to practice with though that is not really necessary for getting a good grade in the course, and that the text books can be a little expensive for what you are getting since you may have to pay for them to be shipped on a slow boat from Sweden."

I can't speak for other language departments, but in French, all the sections are basically the same, just with different instructors--generally grad students or lecturers. We all take tests the same day and have the same homework schedule and use the exact same book and exercises. Instructors are always different about grading and teaching to a certain degree, but with regard to the structure of the course and how things are weighted, it's essentially the same across the board for French.  Hope this helps"
UTAustin,33ivx2,saradactyl25,1 point,Thu Apr 23 02:58:07 2015 UTC,"This is the same in the German department.  It's my major so I'm biased, but I think if you just want to get your language credit and not go any farther than 612, German is easy enough because its basics are simple enough to master if you're a native English speaker, and there are so many correspondences to English you can see right from when you first start learning. Some people say German is hard just in general, but I found most of the difficulty to come after I learned the basics in the lower division classes. After what you learn by the end of those courses the grammar can get pretty complicated and there always seems to be tons of exceptions, which I think is why some learners find German hard.

Someone already posted links to tours, those are a good idea as well, and check to see if the department you'd be transferring into offers meetings about transferring with prospective students.  2)  Disclaimer: I'm not gay.  That being said, I have several openly gay friends who seem to do just as well as everyone else.  There are also programs put on by the Gender and Sexuality Center, and occasionally by the residence halls or other clubs, geared towards diversity and/or the LGBTQ community.  There's also groups like this one you may be interested in on campus as well.  3) Cost can be an issue, I live on campus but depending on where you live/how many you live with it can add up.

I'm gay/queer/??? myself and I've found the campus to be really awesome. There is a really healthy community here with lots of support (LGBTQ clubs, mental health counseling, etc.). I have never been actively harassed for who I am and the few times I have encountered things that were anti-gay either on campus/in the city there were so many people speaking out against it that I never felt shitty about it. People here are honestly just real nice about that stuff and the city in general is really probably the healthiest place to feel good about who you are.   Also see someone has already posted the Gaymers group Facebook in here and I second it as a potential group to join. I've been to a couple meetings and they're really rad. There are also other game groups on campus who give 0 shits about sexuality as well as gaming competitions posted around for smash/mario kart/LoL/etc.   I guess I'll add to question 3, although someone has already mentioned it, that the area is pretty expensive. Housing is one of the biggest kicks in the ass/wallet every year for me. Austin in general just has a high cost of living compared to other areas of Texas I've lived in."
UTAustin,33i5mn,Rreptillian,1 point,Thu Apr 23 21:29:24 2015 UTC,"Any input is appreciated, don't feel like you're being redundant!   As for the costs, I'm full prepared for the ass-kicking I'm going to get. I'm not wealthy by any means, but I believe I'm fully capable of working off a student loan of 20-30 grand. I have my Associate's, so I shouldn't have to spend more than 2-3 years of tuition assuming most of my credits transfer. Housing costs are another issue, but again, as long as I'm working during this time I think I'll be able to come through.  Honestly, after having a huge internal crisis recently, I feel like the college experience would be worth it. UT really appealed to me because it's A) not too far from where I live that I would be stranded with no family, and B) far away enough from where I live that I could stretch my wings and finally let go of all the falsehoods in my personality and FINALLY let myself out. I've been so scared of being myself that I've lost him somewhere inside, and the environment I live in is not stable enough to do any kind of searching for him.  Didn't mean to dump that on you, but this was actually the first time I could really imagine the words I was trying to find to describe this phenomenon.   Thank you, again!"
UTAustin,33h0bd,notyouraveragegoat,2,Wed Apr 22 13:29:02 2015 UTC,"I went to the second to last orientation date and managed to get into all the classes I needed (I'm a CS major), so I would say the one you pick doesn't matter too much. Honestly, orientation is pretty worthless, if you're into partying you can probably find one, but I'd recommend just getting familiar with campus and maybe downtown Austin if you find time. There's really not much else to say about it."
UTAustin,33h0bd,Bokononism4Life,1 point,Wed Apr 22 14:34:26 2015 UTC,You should probably go to an earlier orientation if you can but if not don't worry too much about getting into classes. You would be surprised how much people drop classes during the add/drop period. During my orientation all the classes I signed up for were filler classes that didn't even count towards anything for me. I managed to get the perfect schedule by the time school started.
UTAustin,33h0bd,RandomJPG6,1 point,Wed Apr 22 15:08:38 2015 UTC,"You will need to get your UT ID in the FAC during orientation. You can do this at any time, not just the last two days. Get it over and done with quickly after arrival to avoid lines.  Use MyEdu and Excel for registration... It's a good way to keep track of all the classes. Schedule a lunch time, and don't be afraid to take 12-15 hours for your first semester.  Have fun!

UTAustin,33ct4n,YoureMyVitamins,26,Tue Apr 21 14:10:52 2015 UTC,"When I go I usually swim outside (not as stuffy) but my answers should be the same either way. Put your towel and stuff off to the side or further back from your lane, I guarantee you it'll get wet if you set it right next to the pool.   They might have lanes marked slow to fast, pick one that suits your skill level, no reason to be embarrassed about being in the slow lane if that's where you're at!  We've all been there at some point.   Also don't be afraid to jump into someone's lane if there's not an open lane. Usually ""circle swimming"" is the default way to share a lane. Basically stay to the right the whole time so you don't run into one another, like driving. If there's only two people, you can also ""split the lane"" and pick one side of the lane to swim on the whole time (like an imaginary line drawn through the middle of the lane, and you stay to  your half). Usually if you want to split the lane you should ask/communicate it to whoever you're sharing with.   Bring some water! Have fun!"

UTAustin,33ct4n,geekpondering,6,Wed Apr 22 16:16:51 2015 UTC,I always swim in the outdoor pool. It's very pleasant especially on days with a little cloud cover. You can leave your towel on the chairs. They have kick boards and pull bouys. Don't be afraid to ask to share lanes if they are all taken. Never had a problem with that and everyone is friendly.
UTAustin,33ct4n,i_am_always_hungry,6,Tue Apr 21 14:46:16 2015 UTC,"In the Natatorium, there are benches around the perimeter to put your towel and anything else you don't want to get wet. For the outdoor pool, there are lawn chairs everywhere.  As for sharing lanes, that's perfectly fine. Now that it's warmer, it's pretty unlikely you'll get a lane to yourself. If there are just two in the lane, you can split it down the middle (each person staying to a side, using the lane line at the bottom of the pool as the divider). But if you are going to do circle swimming, definitely take a minute to check out the other swimmers to make sure you are all at a similar level. Otherwise it can get pretty frustrating, as you'll be constantly having to stop, or occasionally even colliding with the others.  I always swim in the outdoor pool (unless it's closed due to lightning). The open air is much more pleasant, in my opinion. The pool itself is heated, so it's fine year-round."
UTAustin,33ct4n,mrflarp,4,Tue Apr 21 16:00:30 2015 UTC,"/u/CE5300 pretty much covered it, but a few more things:   I highly recommend the outside pool The pool is open until 10pm on most nights, after about 8:30pm it's pretty empty so if you don't feel comfortable swimming during peak hours, that's a great time to go. Generally speaking, the middle few lanes are ""fast lanes"". As you move towards the edges, the lanes are marked as slower. If you haven't swam too much in the past, a good pair of goggles & a real swimming suit (i.e. not trunks) are a valuable investment. If you plan to swim during the day, you will at least want tinted googles, if not polarized (like sunglasses) - but these are a bit more expensive."
UTAustin,33ct4n,UndoubtedlyOriginal,2,Wed Apr 22 00:45:54 2015 UTC,"All good points. A couple of other notes...   There is a swim shop at the TSC that has grab bag suits for pretty cheap. They also have Longhorn-branded stuff, but that can get a lot more expensive.  Also, if you have long hair, a cap is recommended. Caps are cheap, and they help keep the hairball tumbleweeds from forming (an occasional phenomenon I've seen in the natatorium, but doesn't seem to be as bad in the outdoor pool)."

UTAustin,33ct4n,throwagay1235,1 point,Tue Apr 21 23:17:03 2015 UTC,"The Masters Swimming program is probably the closest thing. The Water Polo team also has a lot of very good swimmers.

(If I'm approaching the wall and about to kick-turn, I don't pay attention to what's happening above the water) To some extent, disregard ""speed"" signs. If you're a medium swimmer but the medium lane is taken and there are other empty lanes, choose one of the empty ones. I usually take 30 secs to gauge a swimmer's speed before joining them anyways. I see lots of fast people in ""slow"" lanes, vice versa."

TCT also has decent food, but nothing beats their breakfast tacos. I'm personally partial to them because they have a lot of cheese (and I like bean and cheese tacos), which probably isn't great for my health...but they also have nice mac and cheese (microwave for 45s, add pepper and stir, and then 45s again), decent cinnamon rolls (if you want 700 calories and a lot of cinnamon sugar), and great Texas Tea (which isn't unique to them or anything, it just tastes good).  Also, their new supervisor (Joao) is like the most well-versed coffee enthusiast I've ever met. Part of his job is to find awesome new coffee, and he always delivers. Their Texas blonde is a staple if you like that, and for something a little darker their Mexican chocolate is delicious. They also have iced toddies, which is coffee that's been cold-brewed for 24 hours (or something, not super clear on what exactly it is). They make a gallon of it every day, so sometimes if you go close enough to closing they'll run out. It's about as good as the extreme (see below) from the Coffee Bean, but closer to me (I live in the GDC :/).  The Coffee Bean has something called the extreme (or insane? I don't remember exactly) coffee, which is basically cold brewed, slightly evaporated coffee. Except it's probably better described as ""caffeine juice"" or something, because that shit keeps me going longer than anything I've ever had. They also have decent frappes, but Starbucks usually wins that particular competition IMO. They have flavored coffees, which when iced are a good combo of sweet and coffee-ish, so it doesn't assault your taste buds and drown out the coffee taste, but greatly diminishes the acidity.  Oh, and Caffe Medici is good for like first dates and stuff. I don't really like their coffee that much, to be honest, but the environment is nice. If you're alone, you can go up to the second floor and study in a nice coffee-shop atmosphere (or read one of their books, which are usually kinda hit-or-miss). If you're with other people, there are a ton of larger tables to accommodate big groups. (I have a TA this semester who holds his office hours in Medici.) Also, I should note than when I say first date, I actually kinda mean the date before the first date, when you're trying to get to know the other person. It's not that romantic.  There are a ton of places that are more off-campus than that, but I don't think that's what you're looking for. (If you are, try Yelp or something.)"

Here you have class sizes of ~30, the professors actually teach, and there are tons of free resources like the Learning Lab (free math/science tutoring) available for students who want them.   For EP1, John Cise is an easy A, and Underwood / Fredrikson are the ""real"" physics professors who will be hard but will give you a really solid instruction. Took Cal2 with Leonor Eklund and had a good time, she was very nice, she worked tons of example problems, and she has an optional final. If you want a solid instructor who will challenge you I would highly recommend Paul Wright or Richard Doring (he's teaching Cal2 over the summer, if you're an engineering/natural science major who will be using calculus in the future, he's your man), or Leonor Eklund / Paul Schliesing if you want someone a bit easier.

UTAustin,33al59,fernvz,2,Mon May 4 04:43:08 2015 UTC,"Honestly your mileage may very depending on the professor. I'm currently in Calc II and engineering physics 1. According to my friends in Calc II who know kids in the equivalent at UT, they claim that acc Calc II is a lot more difficult than UT's. We took a test last week and the class average was a 58 if that helps you at all. Engineering physics however has been fairly straightforward, especially if you have a moderate physics knowledge. The labs are very simple and straightforward, fun, and help you understand the concepts. The homeworks aren't that difficult. The only thing you need to worry about are the tests, but the professor I have does a good job at showing you what will be on them. For reference I have Mark Burtch for Calc II and David Wolf for engineering physics"
UTAustin,33al59,Aznguyener,4,Tue Apr 21 04:40:18 2015 UTC,Engineering Physics at UT is pretty painful.
UTAustin,338ky0,PhilABustArr,3,Mon Apr 20 14:46:50 2015 UTC,Best answer right here.
UTAustin,338ky0,yoss250,1 point,Mon Apr 20 15:39:05 2015 UTC,Yep. Thought I would care but it literally means nothing the moment you leave graduation.

UTAustin,338ky0,SITHISIT,6,Tue Apr 21 05:57:30 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure you don't put honors cords on your cap...  You drape it over your shoulders over your stole.  Much less obnoxious that way.
UTAustin,338ky0,brazilianbunny,3,Mon Apr 20 15:47:33 2015 UTC,It's just flair but if you earned it then why not? It really isn't obnoxious.
UTAustin,338ky0,Nick51705,3,Mon Apr 20 18:05:37 2015 UTC,"The way I looked at it was that if I worked my dick off for 4 years and have something to show for it, why not wear them? Graduation is a time for you to celebrate your accomplishments with friends and family. I've never heard of anyone saying they were obnoxious and if someone does think that, who gives a shit? You earned them."
UTAustin,33aits,stephology,2,Mon Apr 20 23:15:38 2015 UTC,"African Travel Narratives with Osseo-Asare is awesome.  I took her and the class is mostly discussion over the books and one paper, no exams.  There is a presentation, but it's super easy and just an overview of what you got from the reading.  I think she's great and I'm pretty sure everyone scored high grades if they came and participated.  Epics and Heroes of India with Talbot is probably going to be good. I took her for another class on Medieval India and wish I had taken more of her courses.  She's a super sweet lady with easy tests and easy reading assignments. I didn't find the class hard at all and she was super kind and helpful with any questions."
UTAustin,33aits,prettyslattern,2,Tue Apr 21 04:12:40 2015 UTC,That's actually perfect--I was looking into Epics and Heroes of India. Thanks!
UTAustin,33a7sx,nbarohit,5,Mon Apr 20 21:50:37 2015 UTC,"im a freshman in PACE so im in a somewhat similar situation. My advice to you that i'm doing: TALK TALK TALK email chem E professors and grad students and get involved with whatever research you can that pertains to your field of interest, establish a resume ASAP with UT officials. (EX: i wanna be in marine bio, im talkin to a grad student about coral research during my freshman year) CLASSES MATTER!!! take classes within the major you want (EX: i'm taking bio 101c my freshman year) STUDY STUDY STUDY. especially with chem e, they won't want you if you can't show it in your grades. your grades show your desire to be in that major."
UTAustin,33a7sx,colaudrey,1 point,Mon Apr 20 22:22:38 2015 UTC,Thanks so much for the advice! That definitely sounds doable
UTAustin,33a7sx,yeezusboiz,1 point,Mon Apr 20 22:50:22 2015 UTC,I recognize you from the UT19 group fam.  Solid advice.  Upvoted.
UTAustin,33a7sx,clubmaster_,2,Tue Apr 21 03:29:43 2015 UTC,"I work in the Chemical Engineering Undergrad Office, so maybe I can answer some questions regarding transferring in/what you should do once you get on campus if you aren't in ChE.   Although /u/colaudrey 's advice is great, at the end of the day all that will get you into the department will be your grades. AFAIK, transfer admissions to Cockrell are reduced to your in residence (UT) GPA, especially your GPA in your technical classes.   Every year's GPA cutoff is different, but ChE has one of the highest cutoffs both because of the large quantity of applicants and because of the high quality of applicants.   I suggest you really really focus on grades. There will be enough time to enjoy school fully once you're in, but the first metric used to determine admission is your GPA. If it is not above the cutoff that admissions (since each department doesn't handle their own admissions) sets, that's the end of the line."
UTAustin,33a7sx,bradfleu,1 point,Mon Apr 20 23:38:46 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your response! Let's say the GPA cutoff is 3.7 for next year, and I apply to transfer with a 3.9, am I guaranteed admission? Or are there other factors. What other things besides studying should I look to do next year?"
UTAustin,33a7sx,stoleyourwaifu,1 point,Tue Apr 21 00:37:10 2015 UTC,"There are other factors, but from what i've heard, the cutoff is consistently <3.9."
UTAustin,33a7sx,MotivationalListener,1 point,Tue Apr 21 05:24:26 2015 UTC,"It all depends on your GPA. Regardless of what major you begin with, transfers are mainly accepted based on whether or not they meet a certain required GPA.  I think ChemE and ECE require higher GPAs than the other engineering majors and I think it's 3.7/3.8+ (?). Being involved in stuff would help I guess, but I've heard that it's almost purely GPA based.   So if you think you can get as close to a 4.0 as possible come to UT with w/e major but talk to advisers and try to get into classes that'll transfer into your desired major. First year courses aren't too bad and that's definitely possible. Or, just go to another school where you did get the major you wanted and try and get a high GPA and transfer to UT lol. End of the day it all comes down to GPA"

UTAustin,33823r,Nick51705,21,Mon Apr 20 16:53:03 2015 UTC,Most scholarships are need based in my experience. I did get a merit based scholarship from the engineering department though. I don't really remember applying for it though. Your best bet is to look into applying to outside scholarships. Your HS counselor should have info on local ones.
UTAustin,33823r,yoss250,1 point,Mon Apr 20 12:19:32 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply, I was afraid of that."
UTAustin,33823r,longhorn88,8,Mon Apr 20 12:53:53 2015 UTC,"UT doesn't offer scholarships on based on merit without you applying for them. I had just as qualified a resume as you when I got to UT four years ago. I thought they would give me a scholarship, but lo and behold, you had to apply for it. Contact the department you are enrolling in and get their advice on it. They will have a list of scholarships to apply for.   Also, don't rely on UT to give you money. When those cheesy websites say there are literally millions in dollars of unclaimed scholarships, they are not bullshitting. Check out scholarships.com, or niche.com, or a multitude of others. You can get a lot of money, more than me because most of the scholarships are focused on high school seniors or college freshmen."
UTAustin,33823r,AngusOfPeace,4,Mon Apr 20 15:49:17 2015 UTC,"I believe you have to apply to most of the University wide and department scholarships. Also, CNS will have less scholarships available than engineering and probably business."
UTAustin,33823r,windowsyou,14,Mon Apr 20 13:22:55 2015 UTC,They don't give scholarships to white males

UTAustin,33823r,kerklein2,2,Tue Apr 21 06:49:51 2015 UTC,Most state schools have been tightening the purse strings on scholarships recently.
UTAustin,33823r,PhDeeezNutz,1 point,Tue Apr 21 15:34:11 2015 UTC,They don't give out many. I think I got 1 in my 8 semesters.

UTAustin,33823r,GambitGamer,1 point,Mon Apr 20 15:26:46 2015 UTC,"You can try to get scholarships elsewhere.   There's a pretty sick website I heard about from my friends, schoolinks.com.

UTAustin,33823r,windowsyou,1 point,Mon Apr 20 16:49:16 2015 UTC,The vast majority of UT scholarships are need-based.  They offer some merit based scholarships but you need to apply to them and they are oddly specific.  I didn't fit any of the categories.  I also had top notch ECs and a 2340 SAT score yet did not get anything.

It's pretty hit or miss with them because they don't always have much experience teaching. I'd honestly just pick whichever time you like best."
UTAustin,339mo5,rotorcowboy,2,Mon Apr 20 19:20:50 2015 UTC,"Go here to see when your final exams are going to be. This doesn't necessarily mean that you will have final exams from all your classes. It just tells you that if you do they will be at the times specified.  Also, you will notice that the website provided doesn't tell you the locations for your exams. That information can usually be found in your classes' syllabi. If a syllabus doesn't provide a room for the final to take place, that means it wasn't assigned at the time the syllabus was printed, so just ask your professor if he/she has more information at this date."
UTAustin,339mo5,ConjugateBase,1 point,Mon Apr 20 19:28:54 2015 UTC,"Mine are listed. Last semester, I had no finals, and around this time they weren't yet listed, but I'd still double check."
UTAustin,339mo5,ramchand917,1 point,Mon Apr 20 20:11:42 2015 UTC,"If the professor requested a time slot/classroom for a final, it should show up in your personalized exam schedule, which was posted about 2 weeks or so ago.  So if that schedule is showing no exams then you should definitely double check the class syllabus for all of your classes. Last thing you want to do is fail a class because you assume you don't have a final when you do."

There is a location north of campus on Lamar (and 41st I think) and there is one at 4th and congress in the bottom of the frost bank building. Both locations are equidistant from campus. The quality of bean and precise care taken in making espresso or pour overs cannot be matched. Seriously, this place is one of the best coffee shops nationwide.  Cafe Medici on the drag is quite good. I would say one of the three or four best coffee shops in town. They have a few locations, but the one on the drag is maybe two stores down from the Co-op. Their ice coffee is great in the afternoon (they use the Toddy brewing method), and their espresso is quite good as well.  Thunderbird Coffee is also a decent place, right off manor east of thirty five. (Maybe a five minute drive from campus) They have a nice vibe and pretty decent coffee. They have a few beers on tap, and they have a location up north that has maybe 25+ beer options.   In my opinion Mozarts is a great atmosphere but they have subpar coffee. About as good, maybe a little better than a Starbucks or coffee bean. Great place to take a date for dessert though. Nice, romantic, and lakeside.  Lastly, Wright Brothers Brew and Brew is on east fifth (maybe a block east of thirty five) and they do great aeropress coffee and have quite a few beers on tap. Great place, fun atmosphere."

I think you're also missing the fact that most of the revenue is from students and teachers coming and grabbing a coffee and leaving (he said at minimum 600 customers a day). So although some people sit at the table, JP talked about how summer and winter breaks they're absolutely dead. So I imagine that was a bigger problem."
UTAustin,3302r8,mansionfullofpandas,2,Sat Apr 18 20:22:26 2015 UTC,This is probably the real reason. Most coffee shops in Austin have people buy a single cup of coffee and then camp for hours. But they also have a steady stream of people coming in that aren't obviously affiliated with UT.

UTAustin,330ewp,145638,12,Sat Apr 18 07:41:10 2015 UTC,"I didn't do my undergrad here so I'll leave most of those questions up to other people.  But one thing I wouldn't put too much stock into is rankings.  When schools are in the top tier, nobody cares if you graduated from the #4 ranked program or #6 (I have no idea what the actual rankings are for ME I just made something up).  Plus the rankings change every year, so by the time you graduate they might be reversed."
UTAustin,330ewp,thegreatRMH,8,Sat Apr 18 14:51:15 2015 UTC,"Sweet, I think I can give you a decent perspective - I did my undergrad at UIUC, and am now a grad student at UT (albeit, in ECE).   It'll be roughly the same procedure to switch in both schools. You'll need to apply to your new degree program and have pretty damn good grades to have a chance to get in. Transferring into CS in both schools is pretty damn difficult (some say impossible), and I know transferring into ME at UIUC is no cakewalk either. UIUC is ranked higher, but they probably carry the same reputation among industry professionals. When you're in the top ten, and not Stanford/MIT, you're kind of interchangeable. I'm not entirely sure what you're asking by ""other options"" - maybe you could clarify? Keep in mind you're not restricted to any sort of geographic location just because you went to school there... So job market shouldn't matter. Both schools have a shit ton of companies coming to recruit students - I think the biggest difference would really be what your major is. Majoring in MechE would give you more options as to what sort of field you want to pursue post-graduation than majoring in Aerospace (just due to it being a broader field), but it really comes down to how you spin yourself to recruiters.. This may be the most compelling case for UIUC. Keep in mind, Champaign is incredibly cheap to live in - I paid half the rent for an apartment there that was similar in quality to what I live in Austin now. But this obviously comes with the downside that Austin is wayyyyyy more enjoyable and liveable. What do you value about a city? I'll tell you from experience that Austin has better food, weather, music, and way more things to do. Is this worth the added expense? Internships throughout the year are generally referred to as ""co-ops"" and are actually a great thing to pursue, especially because they're about 6 months vs the traditional 3 during summer (i.e. more money and actual experience). Austin will definitely afford you more opportunities here.   I had the opportunity to continue on to grad school at UIUC, but I'm really glad I didn't. Austin is by far the best city I've lived in. I know you'll be super busy during college with classes and all, but keep in mind you'll need to have a life outside of school - things you do to relax, hobbies you may have, etc. I'd encourage you to visit both schools if you have the chance. Let me know if you have any other questions!"
UTAustin,330ewp,wtfsachode,2,Sat Apr 18 18:02:42 2015 UTC,"One thing to keep in mind if OP is considering CS is that CS at UIUC is part of engineering, if I am not mistaken, but it is part of College of Natural Sciences at UT."
UTAustin,330ewp,kor321,1 point,Sat Apr 18 19:56:16 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind you're not restricted to any sort of geographic location just because you went to school there... So job market shouldn't matter. Both schools have a shit ton of companies coming to recruit students - I think the biggest difference would really be what your major is.   While this is true. Where he does does change the odds of where he will end up. A lot of engineers do in up in other places here, but the majority do stay in Texas, mostly going to Houston for oil related positions. If he's looking to go back to Kansas or Indiana, it will be harder finding a spot here at UT."
UTAustin,330ewp,crankychopsticks,5,Sun Apr 19 04:34:10 2015 UTC,"How easy it will be to switch majors within the school of engineering? (for both UTAustin and UIUC)   Switching majors within engineering at UT isn't too difficult. You do have to apply, and some are more difficult to get into than others, but it's not as difficult as switching into engineering from another college.   If I fail/drop out of engineering what other options will I have at UTAustin and UIUC   No clue what it's like at UIUC, but at UT if you want to transfer into some (most?) of the other colleges, you do have to go through an internal transfer application. Business and Natural Sciences are somewhat difficult to get accepted to, I believe.    Out of state is slightly more expensive at UTAustin   Not by much. I considered both as an out of state student for both, and UT is like 1.5-2k more.   There are a lot more companies around UTAustin that might offer internships during the year   Internships during the school year aren't very common, and most people travel for summer internships anyway."
UTAustin,330ewp,unoriginalloser,2,Sat Apr 18 12:44:35 2015 UTC,"I had narrowed my options to UT and UIUC too when I was applying, but I majored in chemistry. I ended up going with UT since my dad had found a job in Texas, but I have friends that graduated from both schools and have had no problems finding jobs.   Not exactly sure what the job market in Illinois is, but I would say that Texas probably offers more opportunities in the DFW and Houston areas."

I am an out of state student and it was worth every penny. If you work smart and create a strategy,  you can get in state tuition the second year. I'll just throw out my selling points quickly. - they are building a brand new engineering school that you will probably get into your junior/senior year. - they just built the gates/dell computer science building which fosters incredible collaboration if you were to switch majors to that. - Austin itself is absolutely wonderful, very healthy and mindful people (Texans generally are really nice) with morality top of mind for most. -very diverse and cultured population - there is an organization for everyone so getting connected is really easy. -There are plentiful natural landscapes, like a lake nearby and a lake that runs through the city as well as cityscapes and many natural parks only a few hours away. -Entertainment venues and live music every night & any night is status quo. -Weather is never too cold (30s-60's) but does get hot in summer (60's-100s). --THE FOOD. IS. SO. DELICIOUS. There are tons of amazing restaurants with every food imaginable. - the entrepreneurial community here is the best in the nation (SXSW, startup week, accelerators and incubators and just like minded inventors everywhere).

I feel like this is just another example in the long list of UT's push for fashion over function. The primary links for colleges and school information were at the top, same font, same size. Very legible. no drop down or searching required. Then, a large tabulated list of links was down below, easy to read for comparison and finding what you need.   Most egregiously, they sterilized each college's unique logo and replaced them with a string of text stating the title of the major. Unbelievable. Some of these logos have been around since the 19th century and have been heavily associated with their college.   I logged a complaint on the website itself, but that has a fat chance of even being read. Does anyone have any information as to how I can make my voice heard in opposition of this change?"
UTAustin,32vwbf,ThinkinFlicka,3,Fri Apr 17 05:34:00 2015 UTC,Where did they used to show the college logos on the main page? I don't see them here. I don't see the primary links for the colleges that you described either.

UTAustin,32psjh,JuniorOneNut,2,Wed Apr 15 23:13:58 2015 UTC,The application deadline was March 1 but they say submit your application by February 1 so you have time to get other stuff in before the deadline. If you have already completed 30 hours by the time you submit your application then you'll hear back sooner rather than later. If you are going to finish 30 hours after the current semester then you have to submit your final transcript in May once the semester is over and you'll hear back in June...I'm pretty sure I'm in the first round of acceptances.

UTAustin,32psjh,MotivationalListener,1 point,Wed Apr 29 03:09:04 2015 UTC,damn that's impressive! can you elaborate on what you mean by maybe not worth it
UTAustin,32psjh,kacxdak,3,Wed Apr 29 04:19:18 2015 UTC,"haha in some regards its impressive, in others its not. its really a decision you make that has its own cost / benefit attached.  When I entered college, I was very much into hardcore sciences, I aspired to get into MIT/Stanford/etc, you know, the standards. Upon getting to UT, I decided to compensate, I'd just do a double major in EE and in CS. I ended up taking ~6-8 classes per semester, only ever had the chance to take classes that were super technical. In the end, I skipped almost half my classes because they were tiring and I wasn't really learning enough (in my opinion it was easier to learn the stuff from the books and hw than many of the professors). Thus, with my new found abundance of free time, I started auditing random classes across various departments and some grad courses. I found that I really enjoyed those classes. And the greatest benefit was meeting people outside of my major. I was no longer only talking to people who discussed sciences. And it was that variety I really appreciated. Being able to appreciate a good book, philosophical discussion, and just shooting the shit with other people are just some things I didn't really do when I took all those classes.   Looking back, I think that the dual technical degree didn't really help me to the magnitude I thought it would when I first entered college. What I'm taking away from college isn't really the education (which was indeed valuable), but rather the people I met. By dual majoring, I spent a lot of my first year cramming in classes. Then my second year, I spent stressing about classes and cramming more in. My third year, I still took a lot of classes, but I made a drastic change in my balance and spent much more time with friends. That, I think, is what college is about. Getting to know people and yourself better. Not sitting in classes, passing each day studying.   But all in all, I'd recommend you not double major and learn something non-academic about yourself or your peers. Or if you really want to double major, do two that are very distant, so you can meet people of different thought processes rather than be pigeon-holed so early on.  Sorry this is so long!  (note i graduated in 3 years so some of this stuff might be kind of unique just to me)"

UTAustin,32pxwn,counterlogik,3,Wed Apr 15 19:42:53 2015 UTC,"Honestly, if you have experience, you're probably better off finding an advanced certification course: http://www.adobe.com/education/certification-programs.html  Any photoshop course you take is probably just gonna reteach you what you've already learned.  I suggest you take a related course, like the CS game development course. It's not hard for an employer to find someone who's proficient in photoshop, but taking a course like that can open the door to employment in game development companies as well. I'm not saying you should absolutely take the course, I'm just saying you should consider expanding your skillset beyond just basic photoshop."
UTAustin,32pxwn,SITHISIT,2,Thu Apr 16 17:58:12 2015 UTC,Look through the course catalog and email a professor if it's only open to other majors besides yours. Tell them what you said here and they may let you take it. I did that for a junior level design class restricted to design majors. If it works make sure to meet with the professor as some class descriptions make classes seem hands-on when they can be more theory based.

HIS 350L 54-EPICS AND HEROES OF INDIA might be a good choice as well. I've had Talbot and she's so fucking nice.  Like a sweet grandma.  The course I took was light on reading and was pretty easy.  HIS 366N GLOBAL HISTORY OF DISEASE is a class that I took just last semester and it's super interesting.  The reading is pretty light, writing is also light, and Asseo-Osare is a great professor.  Really interesting stuff about everything from malaria to ebola.  ANT 325L JEWISH FOLKLORE - I've taken a few folklore classes, but not this one.  My friend took it last semester and absolutely loved it.  With folklore, the readings are usually light and the discussion is always interesting.  You also can't go wrong with an upper-division anthropology course with Fred Valdez.  He's not big on reading, his exams are pretty easy, and he's pretty funny and down-to-earth with his lectures.  I have had a couple of courses with him and think he's the bees knees.  Film appreciation classes are also supposed to be pretty easy on the reading and writing assignments.  I'd suggest that you see if you can find the syllabi online for anything you're interested in.

UTAustin,32jaef,CardGamesInHell,3,Tue Apr 14 14:36:58 2015 UTC,"Here's the thing about psychology: lots of people (maybe your even your parents and friends) question the validity of a psychology degree. It's sad, because studying human thought, behavior, emotion, etc. has great value, and will apply no matter what field you end up in.  Why? Because you will work with people in almost any job, and being able to understand their behaviors and leverage their psychological strengths and short-comings will help you to advance your own career.    Can you work in a corporate environment with a psychology degree?  Absolutely, (and not even just in the HR department).  My undergraduate degree was in general psychology and I ended up working in operations for a major corporation and thoroughly enjoying it.  Having a business certificate will certainly help your case as well."
UTAustin,32jaef,isallokie,3,Tue Apr 14 14:35:52 2015 UTC,"You can absolutely do business with a psych degree - especially with a certificate, internship experience, business networking, etc. You can't do EVERY type of business (e.g., Accounting requires more specific training), but there are definitely business careers related and unrelated to psych for which a psych degree can be helpful."
UTAustin,32jaef,emalen,2,Tue Apr 14 16:54:33 2015 UTC,"I am actually a senior majoring in both business and psychology. I came at it from the other side, though. I started in McCombs and added on psychology in my sophomore spring semester.   A couple things I've learned: first, this is a very rigorous path to take, either way you go. If you decide to double major, that's a huge commitment and you may have to take an extra year to finish. I have had to take at least 15 hours a semester for every semester I've been here, peaking at 21 hours last semester. If you decide to transfer and only pursue business, you need to realize what you're in for. McCombs is a great school, and highly ranked, and it is appropriately challenging. I have never gotten below an A- in a psychology course, and I've rarely put more than the bare minimum effort into those classes. Like, not studying for exams bare minimum. Only going to class and taking notes and doing the homework. I have struggled mightily in some business classes, even having to drop some in order to pass them the next time I take it. It truly is an entirely different level of stress and workload.  On the other hand, if you stay in psychology only and decide to pursue a business career after school, you'll face challenges that are possibly larger. Psychology is very useful in the workplace - the usefulness of that degree is immeasurable. However, a lot of companies are hesitant to take a chance on someone who hasn't had extensive experience in business practices, including an internship at a typical corporation. It simply is a fact that you'll face a harder time getting into the business world with a psychology degree. You won't have the benefits on McCombs recruiting. You won't have the benefits of a top 10 business school degree. So, there are challenges on both sides.  I don't know what kind of advice you're looking for, but if you want any advice or have any questions for someone who has been in the exact same situation as you (and is graduating with degrees in both psych and finance in about a month), feel free to shoot me a pm. Good luck! I think you probably have a better chance getting into McCombs than you think - the averages are higher than what they actually let in! Forgot to mention earlier that I actually transferred into McCombs from the UGS after my first year."

If you're okay with something a bit more challenging, CH 320M: Organic Chemistry I was really neat. A lot of memorization, but you develop intuition about organic molecules and their characteristics. The funnest part was the reaction mechanism problems, which just felt like fun puzzles. I hear the lab is fun too, and you get to do stuff like make lavender dye.

As far as other classes, try getting anyone but Gouda for 311 and if you can try to get Scott for 314 (his class is supposedly a little harder than Novak but he's a great teacher).

If you take it though, you can basically sleep through most of the probablility course you have to take and still get an a. I'm pretty sure you avail the engi physics, which ever one that is. AP chem i don't think will count for anything because 312 + physics fill the natural science requirement for common core and the cs major.

The Castilian recognized competition was a threat and finally got off their ass and took remodeling seriously.

You have to distinguish yourself a LOT because there's going to be close to 100+ other students all going for a max of 25 transfer spots (last year there were 8 transfer applications accepted)  Its not impossible, definitely not impossible. But (if we are being honest) you came from the waitlist, and therefore probably didn't have the most competitive application, so you'll have a lot of work to do (but i don't know your story).  So to answer your question: Very very very hard."

UTAustin,32af6x,Coconutso,1 point,Sun Apr 12 07:00:36 2015 UTC,"Internally transferring into ECE is not too terribly hard based on previous semester required GPAs. You need around a 3.4, which isn't all that difficult if you are coming in with some physics/math knowledge. Having previously taken AP calculus and physics in high school will be useful. I transferred into ChE Fall 2013, so it is definitely doable. Just decide that transferring is what you want to do (CS or ECE), then work your ass off to get what you want. Take advantage of resources. Tutoring, office hours, etc. you can definitely do it if you want it. CS will be a whole lot harder to transfer into than ECE, but it's still doable.

I think the difficulty of the class really depends on your learning style.  314H is definitely harder than 314 regular. The assignments are much harder and more involved. However the class is much smaller, and honors classes usually have better profs. You will also have access to all the help you may need. Not to mention you will have a programming partner in 314H.  As for grades: Sometimes I think getting good grades in Honors is just as easy as getting good grades in regular classes (if you put in the work) because of the smaller class size and better professors."

ME is a very broad degree, which gives you the background to work in many fields, including ASE.   If you'd like first hand perspective on this, contact Professor Kiehne. He got his undergrad and graduate degrees in ME, but specialized in thermal fluid systems (TFS). During my first lecture in fluid mechanics, he joked about how undergrads in ASE are making the mistake of specializing early. Comparatively, he started general, specialized in grad school as a ME TFS student, and is now a joint professor of ME and ASE.  The TFS-related courses you take in undergrad (heat transfer, fluid mechanics, thermodynamics) give you an excellent background in theoretical and practical design. Additionally, you can tailor your degree through electives (turbomachinery and compressible flow, engine design, dynamic system and controls) to be an even stronger candidate to work in the aerospace field. BTW, all the classes I mentioned are listed under ME.   If you needed further convincing, I have several undergraduate ME friends who had internships or are getting jobs at places like Boeing and Lockheed Martin.   Edit: Grammar and clarity."
UTAustin,322u4s,danmanmoo,1 point,Fri Apr 10 06:16:12 2015 UTC,"In addition to this, from what I can tell competition among ASEng is pretty high, so being versatile as an ME might be better. But I'm not a job seeking aerospace engineer, I just remember huge lines at expo."
UTAustin,322u4s,elektritekt,3,Fri Apr 10 19:41:00 2015 UTC,"It sounds like your interests really lie in Aerospace. I'd transfer. We have a great Aerospace program.  I'm not sure how transferring works before you've started college, but if you can't transfer before you register for classes, make suer you kick ass in your first semester. Internal transfers can be iffy, and Aerospace is one of the smaller programs, so you'll want to have as close to a 4.0 as possible.   http://www.engr.utexas.edu/undergraduate/admissions/changeofmajor"

They were both great and very accommodating and before lunch they already had me transferred into the ASE program. Who knows, maybe I got lucky but I still think it's the best decision I made! I'm happy where I'm at but I also recognize its not for everyone. If you think it's what you want then I definitely recommend it. Just email Sarah Kitten and I'm sure she will help you throughout the entire process. Good luck with everything and hopefully I'll be seeing you in the halls of WRW next year!"
UTAustin,322u4s,thegervais,1 point,Fri Apr 10 18:20:56 2015 UTC,"I originally started as an aerospace major, but ended up switching to electrical as soon as I could because that's truly where my interests lie. That being said, if you are truly passionate about aerospace, I still suggest staying in mechanical. Any aerospace job will require mechanical engineers, so you would definitely be able to stay in that area of work if you decide to. The benefit of staying in mechanical over switching to aerospace lies in the fact that mechanical is EXTREMELY versatile compared to aerospace, so if at some point down the road you decide you want to change your line of work, you'd be much more marketable. I suggest reading other people's opinions on different forums and even subreddits such as /r/engineering, but I know that any job you could get with an aero degree, you could get with a ME degree, however it's not the other way around. Aero degrees are far from worthless, I don't mean to infer that at all, only that mechanical degrees are simply much more versatile and would allow you to work on any of the same projects aero majors will be able to."
UTAustin,322u4s,flyingbkwds21,1 point,Fri Apr 10 05:30:12 2015 UTC,"I would take a look at what you want be to doing at those companies. Most major aerospace companies are equally interested in ME and ASE students. The material learned in both majors has a decent amount of overlap. If you specifically want to get into things like high-speed aircraft, aircraft control systems, or anything space related, transferring is a good idea. If you are just interested in working at those companies in some engineering capacity, you won't see much benefit to transferring. Transferring to ASE is not an issue in most cases, we're a small department and under capacity student wise."
UTAustin,322u4s,JeremyPriest,1 point,Fri Apr 10 05:53:15 2015 UTC,"I was in your opposite situation: I was ASE for my first year and transferred to M E after that to broaden my job prospects. I'm interning at NASA this semester (by the grace of some greater force), and I'd say that the aerospace sector recruits interested MEs just as much as they recruit ASE majors. The interns here this semester (a small pool, admittedly) are 60% Mechanical engineers, with a small amount being ASE students. I figure this is an anomaly, but it's worth telling.  Ultimately, you can choose whichever career you want to with M E, as long as you work hard and stay the course.  I may be a little biased, though.

UTAustin,322c1x,rubyred2019,3,Fri Apr 10 00:34:55 2015 UTC,"If youre doing pre-med youre probably going to be here 4 years regardless of the AP credits you have, there are a lot of classes you have to take; more importantly AP Bio and AP Chem are the two credits that you would have needed to get any real head start. As for the major, Biochem is more intensive and difficult but it overlaps with almost all medical school requirements and is a good major by itself, if you can handle it, do biochem. One more thing to consider is simply the BS degree, which does allow you to get graduate degrees in the field that you are studying. However it is a lot more math and science based compared to the BSA."

I am a liberal arts major, going to medical school. In fact, many schools prefer non-bio majors because they stand out a bit more (same goes for chemistry, biochem, etc).  What you need to take is:   2 years bio (generally 3) 2 years chemistry (ochem and gen chem) 1 year physics 1 semester calculus 1 semester english 1 semster sociology/psychology   That seems like a lot, but it is very manageable to tack that on, particularly if you have any AP credits. I did it with my liberal arts degree no problem, graduating in 4 years with an average of 15-16 hours per semester."
UTAustin,322c1x,DangerManMan,2,Fri Apr 10 02:21:17 2015 UTC,Thanks for the reply! I personally chose Science because I enjoy Science a lot!

UTAustin,322rae,windowsyou,2,Fri Apr 10 06:44:38 2015 UTC,"Okay, I live there right now and I'll offer my two cents. I'm in a single, feel free to ask me anything.  I don't think it's as bad as everyone says. The main problem with the building is that it's just too damn old - the rennovations look nice, but the pipes, machinery, etc. are still straight from the 60s. This is why they can't switch from heat to cool without giving the AC system a day to cool down. The hot water, in my experience, needs a few minutes to warm up. Over the winter, it often wouldn't heat up at all and I'd be doing a cold shower. Also, over Thanksgiving break, the building lost power and water and they had to put us up in a hotel.  Another big problem is the cafeteria. The food is... well, cafeteria food (the staff eat it, so they can't make it that bad), but it sucks having to drag my butt back over the hill, across Guadalupe, and up the elevator everytime I want a meal. Unlike on campus, where there are a variety of options. Also, the place is run by soup nazis and they force you to put your backpack in cubbies by the entrance. They're afraid of you using yours to sneak their mediocre food out. The hours also suck. However, they now have hot plates and sack lunches on request, so I highly recommend making use of them.  American Campus Communities is trying to turn the place around... quite slowly. The rennovations have never been on schedule (the new 11th-floor lounge was supposed to open on the first school day, but it was actually opened in late October) and they really need to fire some of the old staff, like the cafeteria soup nazis.  Final tip: ACC also likes to use their student RA's as pseudo-staff members. But they're not professionals, and on some of their not-so-good days they have a bit of an attitude. And they really don't know much - all they can do is read off a script. Sometimes they can just be so disorganized. During the Thanksgiving break outage, for example, one of them told me to use a free Uber ride to get back from the hotel to the Castilian. WTF?  ...I may have listed a lot of bad points, but honestly these breakdowns are pretty rare, and who knows - maybe by this fall ACC will have put some money into actual repairs. But the age of the building, coupled with the big design flaw of the cafeteria being on the 11th floor (note that Calloway's is ground-level) mean that I won't be coming back next year.  tl;dr Despite what everyone says, you're not gonna die."
UTAustin,322rae,windowsyou,1 point,Fri Apr 10 15:43:02 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply. I don't think it'll be too bad. How are the rooms? When we visited, they were miles ahead of jester or other similarly priced options"

I have some friends in rennovated rooms and I have to say, they're quite nice - indeed miles ahead of the JWest room I stayed in for orientation.  I'm not sure if I'd be willing to live in a double, though - it's four students to a tiny bathroom. At least housekeeping cleans them up every other week.  AC controls are shared between rooms and are kinda finnicky. I ended up closing my vent because my neighbor prefers it cold.  If you ever have any issues, just submit an online work order. Maintenance has been very prompt in my experience."

They use the sub-floors and storm drains to get around campus.  Our squirrels are pretty tame but even they will bite if you try to handle them too much(or act like you have food and don't).

However, I would say the class would be difficult if you didn't attend lectures because there are certain Quest problems that require a hint that only the professor or a TA can give you. Quest loves to trick you. You may not get the best grade if you don't attend lecture, but if you get help from an experienced tutor then you'll be fine.

I'm sure that programs that are more geared to working professionals (like education) are different than those that are more academic; so it would depend on what you are planning to do.   There are often tuition waivers (or partial tuition waivers) that go with a teaching assistantship or research assistantship, and it's also possible that you could get a stipend."

UTAustin,31pyqv,just_a_happy_account,4,Tue Apr 7 06:17:04 2015 UTC,"Okay so this is a question that I can relate to. I'm also from out of the country and was also considering U. Washington (UDub), UCSD, UT, and some others schools for their CS program. Here are some things to consider:  1) Have you been accepted into the actual CS major?  I know that at UT most (if not all) students are accepted as entry-level CS majors and they need to complete some requirements before they are promoted to full(if that's the correct term to use) CS majors. My freshman year, the requirements was to take 3 courses and get a minimum 2.5 in these courses. Here's the page of the requirements and the promotion process which I think has been updated.  At UDub, if I am not mistaken, a lot (if not all) international students who want to pursue a CS degree are accepted as Pre-Science majors. They then need to complete some requirements and then fill out an application with an essay to be considered for admission to the CS program. I have a friend who went through the process and got in and he says it is pretty competitive. If you don't make it into the major, I think you can apply for another major but i'm not really sure. What I have seen is that people usually just transfer schools.  I got accepted as an undeclared major at UCSD so I wasn't actually considering it that much. But I have a friend there studying something in Engineering so they might help.  2) Whichever school you choose, you'll probably spend at least four years there. So check the weather of that city.  3) This is probably less important, but the proximity of the school to international airports is always a plus.  My first year in Austin, I went back home for winter break and had to fly back to Austin through Houston. Even though Austin's airport is international. I don't think they had a lot of international flights that year. But, I know that this year they started having direct flights from Austin to London either once or twice a day.  4) If you are not on a scholarship, check the differences between the tuition of these schools.  These are the stuff that I could think of right now. I'll update it if I have anything else to add.  I came to Austin after living on the east coast for a year. My first time in Texas was during my freshman year orientation after I have chosen UT. Things that I like about Austin/UT:  1) Even though it is generally hot. I personally prefer warm weather over cold weather. (This is not to say that it doesn't get cold. Austin's weather changes a lot during the same day. This semester we had a day where the high was somewhere in around 21, and the low was -2... so yeah)  2) I like the fact that some restaurants around campus open till really late and some of them are open 24/7.  3) People are generally nice and genuinely interested in learning about your country and culture.  4) My first American football that I ever attended was at UT and it was a pretty fun experience.  5) food is really good here.  6) Austin is pretty cool and there are a lot of stuff to do around the city.  Things that I wish I had known before:  1) Even though we get free access to the cities bus systems. Buses take a lot longer than driving. They are usually late too.  2) The core requirements (requirements that ALL students need to take) include U.S. History and U.S. Government.  3) UT's campus is huge and you're going to walk a lot. or bike.  4) The weather changes pretty frequently and it is not always warm in Austin.  Let me know if you have any questions."
UTAustin,31pyqv,kor321,3,Tue Apr 7 15:33:25 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for your detailed response.   1) Have you been accepted into the actual CS major?   I should've been more clear in my post. I have been accepted to Computer Science (entry level, as you described) at UT Austin and pre-science at UW Seattle.   2) Whichever school you choose, you'll probably spend at least four years there. So check the weather of that city.   Correct, so what exactly is Austin's weather like? From what I've read, it gets pretty hot for a good part of the year and pleasant for the rest. I'm from India, so I think the heat should not be much of a hinderance for me. What do you think?  Thanks for all the great points about the people, location, food and football games!   1) Even though we get free access to the cities bus systems. Buses take a lot longer than driving. They are usually late too.   Is it essential/recommended to have a bike? Or will walking and riding the buses be sufficient? I'm guessing the buses are only handy to visit places off campus?   2) The core requirements (requirements that ALL students need to take) include U.S. History and U.S. Government.   Oh well... I've actually never done any of these subjects before (since I'm from India), so it'll be fun to formally learn about the history and government of another country!   3) UT's campus is huge and you're going to walk a lot. or bike.   Ah. Back to the query raised earlier. Would you recommend I get a bike from day one? Or should I play it by ear and see how I feel after a few weeks/months on campus?  Thanks again for replying!"
UTAustin,31pyqv,kor321,1 point,Tue Apr 7 15:59:17 2015 UTC,"Correct, so what exactly is Austin's weather like?   This could probably  give you a better idea on the weather though I am not sure how accurate it is.    Is it essential/recommended to have a bike? Or will walking and riding the buses be sufficient?   On and around campus you could do either I guess. You'll just get there faster if you bike.   I'm guessing the buses are only handy to visit places off campus?   You could use the on campus busses too if you don't want to walk or bike.   Would you recommend I get a bike from day one? Or should I play it by ear and see how feel after a few weeks/months on campus?   You could do either to be honest and you'll be fine. Sometimes if i'm late and want to get to class fast I take my bike. If i'm in the mood of walking to class I just leave my bike.   I guess you could just wait and see where you classes are on campus and how much it will get you to get from on to the other and then decided if you need a bike or not."

UTAustin,31pyqv,kazaanabanana,4,Tue Apr 7 18:34:44 2015 UTC,You'll most likely find that college life probably won't differ a whole lot between those schools. All are in urban environments and are large campuses. There's probably lots of fun to be had at any of them.  Some things I wouldn't pick UT for:   It's really hot down here ~6 months out of the year if you're not used to it Housing is ridiculously expensive in Austin (but that's likely also a problem elsewhere). Public transport is good for a Southern city but pales in comparison to actual urban areas   Things I would pick UT for (if you're into that):   Food in Austin is pretty darn good Heavy winter clothing is not a thing Football is big here

If you're not coming in with a group of friends it's also pretty easy to feel a bit lost (I also came from out of the state) at first.

UTAustin,31orzc,145638,1 point,Mon Apr 6 23:43:13 2015 UTC,"UTAustin fits that way better than the other two.   Parties abound, and Austin as a city is super party in its own right. Gregory gym is incredible. Definitely tops of the pops/upper echelon level for those fields. UT is basically one of the, if not the, best bang for your buck of any school in the nation, particularly for engineering.   I got into Carnegie Mellon too years ago, also engineering (though I moved to the College of Natural Sciences after my first year or so). I chose UT for cost sake. Carnegie gave me a big portion of my tuition actually (almost half or so), but still it was gonna be about triple the cost of UT. This assumes you are a Texas resident, but even if you aren't UT is a lot cheaper than Carnegie. UIUC definitely cheaper than Carnegie but not nearly the deal UT is if you're a Texas resident, not sure otherwise."
UTAustin,31orzc,counterlogik,2,Mon Apr 6 23:50:57 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't call Gregory gym incredible.   It has below mediocre lockerrooms and while the equipment in the weightroom is nice, it's way too small for the population."

Big discounts on software from computer store (you can get Microsoft Office for like, 15 bucks). All the resources (Journals, papers, etc.) that are on the library website in addition to the libraries themselves. Some free tutoring with Sanger Learning Center in Jester.

UTAustin,31kepj,whiteyeezy,2,Sun Apr 5 22:59:51 2015 UTC,"So nothing catastrophic is going to happen if you drop your from 12+ hours to less than 12 hours, but it is dependent on what you have in terms of financial aid.   In terms of any federal loans, you're okay if you have 6 or more hours and if you drop after the 12th class day. If you drop below 6 hours total for the semester, then your loans go into their grace period, but this is usually not the case for most people.  In terms of grants (UT Grant, TPEG, Pell Grant), nothing happens if you drop this late in the semester.  Both the Top 10% Scholarship and Texas Grant have hourly renewal requirements that must be met to get them again in the 2015-2016 year. They're available to view if you look at them on your CASH page and you click on the actual award.   TEXAS Grant requires at least 24 hours completed by the end of summer 2015 and Top 10% Scholarship requires at least 30 hours. Both also have other requirements, so do check on your CASH page. Please note, that even if you lose eligibility one year, it is possible to regain the award in the next academic year.   If you have private named scholarships and grants, you will have to check with the donor for their eligibility requirements and what they will do.   Lastly, this was touched on before, but Satisfactory Academic Progress is also at play. Basically, in order to receive financial aid at all, you must meet 3 basic requirements:  Your GPA must be above a 2.0 You must pass at least 75% of the classes you attempt, and  You must not exceed 134% of your program hours (this means usually not exceed 160 hours).   Every time you q-drop, get an F, get an incomplete, or withdraw, it counts against your completion percentage. The basic formula to compute it is (classes successfully completed/classes attempted). This does also take into account transfer credits/AP credits, so that is a nice padding if you transferred some in.  So, essentially, not much is going to happen to you at this point, but it depends on what you have."
UTAustin,31kepj,belloport,2,Mon Apr 6 03:26:52 2015 UTC,"Hey there. I'm a UT alum and actually work as an academic advisor at another institution. First double check with your advisor and financial aid, but to hopefully give you some peace of mind here's what I've experienced with students in this situation.   Dropping below full time really doesn't affect much, unless you do it every semester. If you are receiving and government assistance (loans, grants, etc) you need to maintain ""Sufficient Academic Progress"". This means you need to earn passing grads in 67% of the hours you attempt. So dropping below full time once or twice won't hurt you.   If you have a scholarship that requires you earn a minimum number of credits each academic year (fall and spring) then you'll need to check with the scholar. In most cases, there is a probationary period if you do not satisfy the terms of your scholarship.   On a personal note, I dropped to 10 hours when I was at UT and nothing happened. I didn't have scholarships, but had several federal loans.   I hope this helps, let me know if you have questions. Good luck."
UTAustin,31kepj,nutmeg1640,1 point,Mon Apr 6 01:27:56 2015 UTC,"IIRC correctly, you get a ""one time pass"" for dropping below full time as far as UT and Stafford loans/grants are concerned. I did this my second to last semester and I was not disqualified from any financial aid I was previously given (Still have to pay off loans after graduation, of course).  So I think, as /u/nutmeg1640 said, you're good as long as you don't make it a habit. Of course, verify with an adviser and/or the Financial Aid office, because polices tend to change."
UTAustin,31kepj,justduck01,1 point,Mon Apr 6 01:50:49 2015 UTC,From what I understand as long as you have 24 hours by the end of the year (fall-spring-summer) you'd be considered full time. If you take a few classes over this summer I think it should be fine. Be sure to ask your advisor about this though to be safe and sure!

UTAustin,31gqy0,saradactyl25,8,Sat Apr 4 22:49:48 2015 UTC,"Getting a bike is super worth, especially for getting around such a large area like campus. You travel a lot faster compared to your plebeian bus-riding or pedestrian friends. Also, you get the joy of riding downhill, like on 24th street from Whitis to San Jacinto.  There are usually bike lanes in West Campus, but if you find your self in an area where there aren't any just stay to the far right of the lane. Most cars here know how to share the road with bikers since there are so many here. If you're making turn, be sure to signal your direction.  For protection, make sure your bike is night-ready. Check that all your reflectors are good, and purchase safety lights for the front and back of your bike that flash. To go the extra mile, you can add reflective tape to the rims and frame of your bike.   Biking on roads may seem intimidating, but you'll get used to it after a few days."
UTAustin,31gqy0,danmanmoo,7,Sun Apr 5 02:37:54 2015 UTC,"Please use the bike lanes. It's technically against the law to ride a bike on certain sidewalks around Austin, including parts of Guadalupe.

UTAustin,31gqy0,Kostanza,5,Sun Apr 5 04:23:21 2015 UTC,"It's really not that scary. There are bike lanes on many roads and as a previous commenter said, you can always go up/down a block or two from a major road and find a different one that takes you to where you want to go and has a fraction of the traffic. Personally I don't have a problem navigating Guadalupe and 24th on bike but I've been doing it for awhile.  Please for the love of god though, if you choose to ride down 24th or another street without a bike lane where you are going to have to take up a whole lane, pedal your ass off. It is far more safe for the cars behind you to say ""damnit, this biker is in front of me. At least they're going close to how fast I would be going anyway, though"" rather than ""mother of god this person is slow, I'm going to force myself around them."" And definitely do not ride down the side of a lane on 24th or what have you. It is far better for the driver to know they aren't getting around you without changing lanes than to have them think they can squeeze by you. Just take up the whole lane and pedal your ass off."

Depending on the time of day, there is always a decent amount of traffic on that road.  If you are wanting to get more comfortable riding around. I'd suggest going north/south and then riding east on a lesser populated road like 21st.   There are also a lot of social rides that are laid back and would help you with getting comfortable with your abilities and traffic.  FYI I've seen PLENTY of people riding to campus that looked like they had never ridden a bike in their life.. As long as you make an effort to be safe, I'm sure you'll be alright."

UTAustin,31g6ud,LoveForChrist,5,Sun Apr 5 03:24:18 2015 UTC,Start talking to people in CS now. Maybe there is another option for you to stay in CS?
UTAustin,31g6ud,Xizel,4,Sat Apr 4 20:20:15 2015 UTC,GPA-friendly professors like Novak aren't good lecturers like Scott.

UTAustin,31g6ud,passwordistroll,3,Sat Apr 4 20:55:40 2015 UTC,Don't make bad grades.
UTAustin,31g6ud,69pissface420,-11,Sun Apr 5 01:57:40 2015 UTC,"Psychology, general communications, maybe education, fabrics, or how about english?"
UTAustin,31g6ud,nakon,-3,Sat Apr 4 20:39:36 2015 UTC,"RTF, there's a ton of technical classes in the production track.  A few of the classes are cross-listed with CS as well."
UTAustin,31g6ud,RandomJPG6,3,Sat Apr 4 20:19:07 2015 UTC,RTF is in no way comparable to CS in any way at all. The only classes that are cross-listed are the game development courses and in those classes you don't learn programming if you are taking the RTF version. Also OP never said they wanted to work in film or video games.
UTAustin,31i1qs,Shoot_Boyz,4,Sun Apr 5 07:14:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, 429 would be the first class. It covers basic computer architecture (cpu, RAM, disk, pc, etc), logic gates, and different designs and how that relates to the basic assemlby. You also code in assembly which is the next level down. If you take Gheith you cover all of this and he teaches a 429 class during the Spring (?) and during the summer."
UTAustin,31i1qs,dbzfanjake,1 point,Sun Apr 5 07:25:02 2015 UTC,Awesome! Thanks again Jake. Would this be a sophomore class?
UTAustin,31i1qs,dbzfanjake,2,Sun Apr 5 07:33:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah. It's the first upper division class and is mandatory. If you come in with ap credit, you can take it second semester Freshman year, and then you can get Gheith, who is an awesome professor. He might be back to teaching the honors classes, I'm not sure though. There are compiler and more advances computer architecture classes as upper division electives and grad classes you can apply for."
UTAustin,31i1qs,dbzfanjake,1 point,Sun Apr 5 07:51:14 2015 UTC,"I have the ap score to get credit for 312 but I wasn't planning on skipping any CS classes. Is it still possible to get Gheith my sophomore year? Also, on a side note, I was told at Explore UT (Open house type of thing) by a current CS student that you can no longer use AP scores for credit. I'd have to take an exam for credit if I chose to skip 312."
UTAustin,31i1qs,Comm2010,1 point,Sun Apr 5 08:01:14 2015 UTC,"Oh, then you probably have to take the exam. I'm not sure if it's worth taking the exam though. The GPA boost from 312 is pretty nice. You can always apply to take the honors course or take 429 during the summer. Or he might be teaching it in the fall instead of the spring. There are a lot of variables, so you should probably just take 312 and decide what to do from there. One of the 429 proffesors who teaches the other semester is pretty good though. Gheith is a systems architecture guy with IBM and he works part-time while he teaching part-time. He's not the end-all-be-all, but he;s pretty good"
UTAustin,31i1qs,DealLayLolMo,1 point,Sun Apr 5 08:19:29 2015 UTC,Sounds good. I've been considering applying for honors during my freshmen year but we'll see how that goes. Thanks again

UTAustin,31g5f3,dirkey93,5,Sun Apr 5 17:41:28 2015 UTC,Definitely sign up for rush on the IFC website. That's where most of the fraternities get names from that they end up contacting and inviting to their rush events. http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sfl/join_ifc_recruit.php
UTAustin,31g5f3,LucidityX,4,Sat Apr 4 21:32:04 2015 UTC,"I'm in Greek life here and I'll summarize it for you:  Pledgeship: You will get hazed to death. Plan on cleaning up the vomit and beer cans in the house, being forced to chug sixth's of crown, chugging gallons of milk, being allowed to sleep 2 hours a day, forced to pickup drunk actives at random places etc.  Once initiated, Greek life at UT is all about social events. Nearly 95% of the frat guys I know get hammered at least two days a week. There's a lot of pressure on hooking up with women (Although that's being addressed recently and getting a lot better). The peer pressure to get drunk often/use drugs will be pretty high. However you will meet a lot of sorority girls and get pretty close with your pledge class. If you're a business major you'll likely meet some good connections as well.  I say these things because I grew up in Michigan and I know fraternities are a lot more ""respectable"" in a gentlemanly sense at northern colleges I have several friends at. Just wanted to let you know what it's like beforehand, if it sounds appealing to you then go for it! Just sign up on the IFC page another user posted and as soon as you get here try to get to know as many people in Greek life as possible."
UTAustin,31g5f3,GroverMcGillicutty,12,Sun Apr 5 00:49:51 2015 UTC,"Also know that it is possible to have lots of amazing friends, wonderful experiences, and valuable connections without sacrificing your dignity, moral compass, or money."
UTAustin,31g5f3,TheEyes0fTexas,3,Sun Apr 5 01:56:18 2015 UTC,"And keep in mind that every fraternity has different groups of guys. There's going to be the guys that drink every night because their major is a joke. Then you'll have the groups of guys like myself and my close pledgebrothers that are studying Engineering and end up in the library a bunch even on weekends.  Whatever experience you want to get from the fraternity there will be like minded people to help you do that, whether its getting drunk constantly, making connections or even just friends to study with."
UTAustin,31g5f3,PlayLikeNewbs,4,Sun Apr 5 02:02:26 2015 UTC,"Some other good ones include  ATO KappaSig KA   Sadly, the real estate prices are too high for the little guys. Most of the small fraternities will die in the next few years.  I recommend you join a non-greek student org, regardless if you get in or not(although pledgeship might get in the way) it never hurts to get to know alot of people.  If you need anymore guidance, pm me."
UTAustin,31ft2l,lordofmiraclewhi789,9,Sat Apr 4 17:56:42 2015 UTC,"Jester really isn't that bad. The majority of freshmen live in Jester West/East, so even people who live across campus in the Quad/Duren/etc end up going to Jester many times a week. It's in one of the best locations: JCL/J2, Gregory gym, and the PCL all just a couple minutes walk away. The bad things about Jester: when it's hot outside, the air conditioning makes the inside freezing, and vice versa; there's a smell in the hallway, but you get used to it really; and on some floors (like mine), the water definitely has some bacteria in it so you have to clean out your britta/water bottles every few days."

UTAustin,31di5y,meanderling,2,Sat Apr 4 01:09:14 2015 UTC,"Which job would you be applying for? The majority (if not all) internships are reserved for UTeach students.  What you do varies greatly based on the internship assignment. There's after school club coaches and tutoring for AISD schools, learning assistants for various UT courses, positions at various STEM organizations throughout Austin, etc. Some do require outside lesson plan writing while others you just need to learn the lesson plans. Some internships you are teaching a classroom on your own, others you are teaching with a partner, while others you're simply tutoring.  As far as pay, when I was there I got paid $12/hr for working with outreach, $13/hr for AISD after school club coach. Most positions are by semester (fall, spring, summer), and the hours really depend on what position you apply for (you can also sometimes request how many hours you want to work per week). On the application you can list the top three positions you want."

It's part of a certificate program, and I'm going to guess that the Natural Sciences and Liberal Arts programs are pretty different.  But, I will say that the Liberal Arts program is great if you're wanting to experiment with teaching. In my program you get placed in a classroom with a mentor teacher starting with elementary and eventually finishing the program in a high school classroom. You also start with creating 3 (pretty basic) lessons a semester to the elementary kids and again, working your way up to full time student teaching to high schoolers. I really enjoy the faculty and program, and even though I haven't decided yet whether or not I'll finish, it's totally because of my indecisiveness about teaching, because the program itself is wonderful.  Hope this helps!"

UTAustin,3193ml,austinapts,3,Thu Apr 2 23:50:05 2015 UTC,"UT has very limited housing for graduate students, but the waitlist is I think more than a year right now so it will not be a short term solution. If you are coming to UT for a PhD, it might be worth placing yourself onto the waitlist but you probably won't get in for 1-2 years. I never put myself on the waitlist because I am in a terminal master's program and it was unlikely I'd get off the list before I graduated.   Most grad students live north of campus, although some live in the Riverside area. There are some places that do the renting by the room setup, but they are mostly in the West Campus area, are entirely inhabited by undergrads, and tend to be very expensive and you can find something less expensive where you won't have to put up with undergrads partying. I would recommend against living in any of those. I'm not aware of anywhere that does roommate matching.   You'll be able to find apartments to move into over the summer without needing a short term lease. I was able to do this both years."
UTAustin,3193ml,machli,1 point,Fri Apr 3 15:44:09 2015 UTC,"What kind of environment are you looking for? What's your budget?   A lot of graduate students live in North Campus due to its neighborhood feel and quietness. Many of the apartment complexes are privately owned or owned by small companies.  West Campus has a bunch of huge apartment complexes that offer roommate matching. However, the area mostly consists of party-minded undergrads with whom you'll likely be placed.  If commute isn't an issue, you might consider the Far West or Riverside areas.  I've had a couple friends successfully find apartment in North Campus using a free realtor. The only drawback as far as I can tell is that they only show you apartments owned by the company that hires them, so there could be better options you're not seeing."

UTAustin,310fii,GambitGamer,12,Wed Apr 1 03:33:54 2015 UTC,"They do reserve some seats in each class for every orientation session. For example if a class has 100 seats, each orientation session they might open 20 seats up. This means that there will be at least some seats open for every orientation session.  That said, people who went to earlier orientation sessions can also sign up for the newly opened seats, so there is more competition.   I attended the second to last orientation session and had no problems getting the classes I needed. Another plus to waiting longer is that you get your AP scores back so you know which classes you will get credit for. This is a big help when planning your schedule.   So overall, I would say don't worry about it too much. Attend whichever orientation works best for you.  Welcome to UT and Plan II!"
UTAustin,310fii,austintexan,5,Wed Apr 1 04:32:09 2015 UTC,"I'm also from out of state, and flew to Austin in June for orientation. I'd highly recommend it if it's an option for you. You're more likely to get the classes you want at the times you want them, and you'll likely have a better orientation experience. The August orientation is mostly international students and I believe it has no separate orientation housing. I met a lot of cool people during orientation and really felt like it gave me an idea about what to expect when classes started in August.  As far as getting the classes you want, I wouldn't worry about it too much. See here and here for info from previous posts on this sub"
UTAustin,310fii,unoriginalloser,2,Wed Apr 1 05:24:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Plan II does a good job of reserving spots for you at orientation. It makes for an unpleasant surprise when you sign up for your second semester of courses and realize there aren't spots reserved for you anymore!  I wish I knew about CS specifically-- All I can say is I've had good luck during add/drop (i.e after registration) getting into classes that were initially full. Sometimes it's taken a week or so into the semester for me to be added to the course but where there's a will there's a way. I think you'd be fine coming in for August orientation."

The ""8 students accepted"" thing was a reaction on the part of the administration to the college forcing them to take 100+ transfer students a year, a burden the department isn't well-equipped to handle. After some negotiations, our budget looks far more safe now, so we'll probably be back to the 100 or so transfers admitted.  Of course there is no ideal GPA, but the higher the better. Also, if you can take CS 303E (Elements of Computing), that's a HUGE plus on your application. Focus on getting your state-required stuff out of the way as well. Aside from that, any background, significant or not, in CS is a huge plus."

At this point in time it is extremely difficult to transfer to CS from any major and college. GPA needs to be around a 3.8. On top of that they have about 300 incoming freshman and about 200+ transfers applying. Last semester of all the transfers I think they only took like 8 or so.

UTAustin,310eh9,Hookem_Horn,12,Wed Apr 1 03:25:16 2015 UTC,"I think its very difficult to triple major across 3 different colleges, as in they are very reluctant to let you into the third major. UT is VERY big on everybody graduating in 4 years. Also the Math department has started to become picky when letting new majors in.   Overall the math sciences degree plans are very easy to do with other majors, so that's probably less of an issue."
UTAustin,310eh9,neutralvoice,6,Wed Apr 1 03:41:57 2015 UTC,"There is very little reason to triple major. Businesses and Graduate schools do not care how many degrees you have, but instead what you've done with those degrees. So doing more with one major is way more important than doing less with three."
UTAustin,310eh9,nicharesuk,2,Wed Apr 1 13:39:06 2015 UTC,"This is the best answer. No one cares if you triple major (seriously no one, do a scan of what companies are looking for now). You need to focus on internships, research, supplemental experiences that you can talk about that show your skills and passions. 'Look how many classes I can take!' is not impressive. Plus, it's extremely unlikely you'd be admitted into a third major."
UTAustin,310eh9,emalen,3,Fri Apr 3 16:15:31 2015 UTC,"It will be very tough. Plan II  doesn't take a lot of AP's so you're not as ahead as you'd hope to be. I know several Plan II/BHP people and the conventional wisdom is to take 5 years when you're getting two degrees (from different colleges, as opposed to double majoring, which would be like doing Plan II and English, in the same college). Your plan would be three different degrees, with totally different prerequisites at the freshman/sophomore level. Very little course overlap will make it hard to get out in a decent # of years.  Consolidate or plan on spending more time at school. I wish I had advice for you on what to drop, sounds like you have many great options. Keep an open mind when you come to school-- lots of us start one place and end up somewhere very different."

UTAustin,310eh9,Aznguyener,1 point,Wed Apr 1 04:58:45 2015 UTC,"If your third major is in the business school then BHP runs right along w a business major and you don't really have more hours. 5 years is the standard for plan ii BHP and a business major,  If you really are looking to bust it you could do it in 4.5."
UTAustin,310eh9,jakehoodlum,1 point,Wed Apr 1 12:54:06 2015 UTC,"The course load would be way too much. Trust me, I'm majoring in pure math now and there's incredibly difficult periods. There's no way you're doing anything math-y with two other majors. Edit: Er, saw you said math sciences, not as familiar with those. Point still stands though!   Why do you want to major in three different things? A major is a pretty substantial commitment/concentration. Maybe consider having 1-2 majors/1 major and a minor? That'd get you a good education while still allowing you to enjoy college. Honestly, I can count on one hand the number of people who have the ability to triple major."
UTAustin,310eh9,PastaTapestry,0,Wed Apr 1 06:49:34 2015 UTC,"Don't be discouraged by the other comments; it's totally possible IF you start planning early.

I'm doing BHP/Math/Econ, so feel free to PM me if you need any advice."

I'm a grad student and I try to avoid undergrads as much as possible, which is definitely the norm for my peers (not sure about law student mentality).  I still go to bars often with friends, but I'm not going to many ragers or anything like that.  I can't speak to the fraternity lifestyle here at all or if non-undergrads can join them."

UTAustin,30y1uj,radiatorcheese,2,Tue Mar 31 18:17:32 2015 UTC,"I don't think you'll be living with undergrads.  If I'm not mistaken, you'd be living in a grad complex with other grad students.  I have no idea where that is in relation to campus or to any other dorms, everyone I know rents an apartment or a house."
UTAustin,30y1uj,geekpondering,2,Tue Mar 31 18:52:27 2015 UTC,"I'm going to be studying at the law school   Are you going for pre-law, or a professional law degree? I'm not sure of whether the frats will let a non-undergrad join, etc, but at best it would probably be a little weird to be a 22 year old pledge.  There's certainly a party lifestyle in Austin for people beyond 22 where you can hang out with people that are actually of drinking age. :)"
UTAustin,30y1uj,geekpondering,1 point,Tue Mar 31 18:08:39 2015 UTC,"I'm getting my J.D - I don't really care about pledging as a 22 year old etc etc, even if it is a little strange, but it's whether or not it's prohibited for non-UGs to pledge to begin with. I don't want to miss out on all these facets of the 'experience' just because I'm a few years older than everyone else."
UTAustin,30y1uj,geekpondering,3,Tue Mar 31 18:11:04 2015 UTC,"I think some might consider it more than a little strange, but oh well.  According to the UT page, the only requirement is being a full time student registered for 12 hours. Full time at UT Law is 10-16 hours, so you might have to take a larger than normal load to stay in a frat."
UTAustin,30y1uj,alone_yet_strong,1 point,Tue Mar 31 18:34:52 2015 UTC,"In what sense? I'm aware that this is a particularly arbitrary comparison, but here in England the closest we have to fraternities in college are sports teams. As part of my rugby team we have had plenty of 22-27 year olds initiate (pledge) with us and no one has batted an eye-lid, I imagined it would be the same for fraternities but if it's going to turn me into some kind of Greek Freak (hold your applause) then obviously i'd reconsider. If it's pure aesthetics then that doesn't matter, I still get ID'd for alcohol here (18+), got a real baby face, but if it's the entire concept of someone 'older' pledging that's a really big deal then I won't bother."
UTAustin,30y1uj,geekpondering,6,Tue Mar 31 18:40:28 2015 UTC,"the closest we have to fraternities in college are sports teams.   It's a bad comparison. The Greek system (the social part of it anyway) at US colleges are considered to be generally an undergraduate phenomenon. You might get a hint of this when you register at the IFC for UT, where they ask you for your hometown and high school information (not 'other colleges', etc), and the choices for recruitment status are ""Freshman"", ""Sophomore"", ""Sophomore Transfer"", and ""Other"".   it's going to turn me into some kind of Greek Freak (hold your applause) then obviously i'd reconsider.   It's also generally known that belonging to a (social) fraternity means that your social life will almost entirely revolve around fraternity/Greek functions.  That's a generalization, and while the spectrum is limited, there is a spectrum of Greek life especially at a big university like UT. There's also professional and volunteer fraternities that provide some social outlets and networking that you might look into.  Edit: words"
UTAustin,30y1uj,bubbasaurus,1 point,Tue Mar 31 19:02:31 2015 UTC,"Interesting, thanks for raising those points. And if i don't join a Frat, are there still plenty of ways to meet nice people, have a social life, and party? The impression I get from some people on forums etc is that if you want to party you HAVE to be part of Greek Life, or you can kiss it goodbye."
UTAustin,30y1uj,arimaspii,2,Tue Mar 31 19:42:05 2015 UTC,"Bud, I am not in a fraternity, and I can honestly say that I go partying every single weekend and just this spring break I went on a road trip with a great group of people. Also, you can befriend frat members and usually to to their parties with no issues if you are a good friend to them.  Like the other guy said, college is what you make of it. Also, there are a shit tons of orgs you can join to meet people, and 99.9% of them have social/partying events throughout the year."
UTAustin,30wtem,got_rejected_today,2,Tue Mar 31 10:20:13 2015 UTC,"Welcome!  This could be a totally decent program, I don't know that much about it. Here's what I do know. They seem to be the only certificate program emailing freshmen, and their emails are a little misleading. They make it sound like you have been selected for a prestigious program, when actually anyone can apply. I don't know, it could be great if it's something you are interested in. But you should really check out this page. There are so many programs to choose from! Game design (in major) or Business Foundations out of major, for example. Don't rush into it, shop around for a program you are interested in."

I understand it is a program that is open to all, and was asking whether it is recommended to apply. Thanks for your advice!

UTAustin,30wtem,snicketer,1 point,Tue Mar 31 19:49:04 2015 UTC,"Sure thing. I don't know anything about it, I just don't want you to discount the dozen or so other programs available to you because you didn't get an email. And it's probably possible to do more than one."
UTAustin,30wtem,Ndrul,2,Tue Mar 31 20:13:33 2015 UTC,"I was in JSP for fall semester. I am an Economics major and I ended up dropping it. Here is what I have to say:    Full disclosure: I only took one JSP course. I can't remember what is required/recommended anymore, but they are flexible about helping you get it into your schedule. I dropped because I am in 17 hours without it already this semester and I didn't like it as much as I expected. The courses that you take are harder than normal intro philosophy courses. The one I was in had a TON of reading (Aristotle, Rousseau, Locke, Montesquieu, Aquinas, Marx, Smith, Hobbes, and Hayek). It was less of an exploration course and more of an in-depth study of how political and economic thought has changed over time.  JSP does give you access to a lot of great resources like professors and guest lectures, but I'm not sure that you need to be in JSP to access them.  I took their course instead of being in a FIG and I regret it. A lot of my friends really liked their FIG and made other friends through it. JSP has a required discussion group that is similar, but I didn't benefit from it as much.  There are all kinds of majors in JSP. I think I remember meeting someone in CS. If you like philosophy and don't mind the extra course load, then it could be a good fit.    JSP wasn't worth it for me, but that doesn't mean it isn't the right fit for you. I don't want it to sound like I'm slamming the program because some people did enjoy it. I didn't get involved in the Jefferson community so I can't comment on that except saying that it exists. You can always apply then drop later if you decide you don't want to do it. I'd be happy to answer any questions you have."
UTAustin,30wtem,GambitGamer,1 point,Tue Mar 31 21:31:47 2015 UTC,"I'm in CS and it sounded interesting enough so I applied.  Whether I actually will have time for it (double majoring CS and Plan II) is another question altogether.  Also, I might want to do another certificate instead."
UTAustin,30uup2,fokinsean,30,Mon Mar 30 22:08:13 2015 UTC,"This is just conjecture, but maybe because it was all resolved relatively quickly and without incident, so UT leadership didn't want to create a panic?"
UTAustin,30uup2,justduck01,1 point,Mon Mar 30 23:44:38 2015 UTC,That's possible. This just resonates to me the whole bomb threat situation that happened 2 (?) years ago where they held back a lot of information. I just feel we should at least be aware of these things.
UTAustin,30uup2,justduck01,15,Mon Mar 30 23:55:43 2015 UTC,"They probably will release more information. But if they put out, in the middle of the day, a big e-mail or text to all students and faculty telling everyone there was someone with a gun on campus, they would be forced to not only deal with the panic, but probably cancel classes which would be a large and unnecessary burden for the university. I imagine they will put out info tonight or tomorrow.  After all, if it was all handled quickly & neatly, and no one was hurt, what's the point in creating a huge mess about it?"
UTAustin,30uup2,kazaanabanana,4,Mon Mar 30 23:59:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's true, good point. It just kinda weirded me out when I heard about it from a friend. I walked through the SAC around that time so it is just a strange feeling knowing how close I was to the situation."
UTAustin,30uup2,untouchedURL,2,Tue Mar 31 00:03:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I would have at least appreciated a campus-wide email about the situation after the fact.

There were also the bomb threats recently in West Campus that UT didn't inform students about."

Run till you get to the stadium, bang a right on 23rd, turn right at San Jacinto and run all the way to Dean Keeton, turn right, and run back to your original spot on Deadman. That will be 1 mile. Repeat to your abilities.  Route two: it's pretty much an extended version of the first. Instead of turning right at the stadium, run down Deadman all the way down to 20th, turn right, and turn right on San Jacinto, run all the way to Dean Keeton and back to your starting point on Deadman. That's 1.5miles.   The app Strava is really fun to find routes and track your runs."

UTAustin,30sp52,Cr0wnd,10,Mon Mar 30 11:37:15 2015 UTC,"You have a few options!  First, I would talk to a counselor from UH about transfer student scholarships, it may help your decision knowing you do have a fall back if you need one.  When it comes to Pharmacy, UT is probably going to be your best bet because the labs and what not at Austin are better than UH. The classes will be hard, but I think you knew that coming into it.  If you decide pharmacy isn't for you, however, it is very hard to transfer into a different natural science major simply because internal transfers are strictly GPA based, and you decided you don't like pharmacy will probably be because you aren't doing well in the classes.  Are you going to be dedicated enough at UT austin to make sure you get the good grades to utilize the better facilities? Or are you going to want to have a safety net in a possibly easier school."

You got in and you can do it.  You have a few options really. You could go to UH and just get your degree there. You have the scholarship so why not?  You could go to UT and hope the offer something good. The problem with this is you might not get enough.  Have you done your FAFSA?   A lot of them are over but there are external scholarship resources that you can find online.  If you do go to UT, worse case scenario is you take out student loans. Is it worth it? That really depends on you. You have a full ride. Housing in Austin is relatively expensive and you might have to get a job. I wouldn't live in the dorms just due to the prices. You have to leave for Christmas and summer breaks. Personally I would find something off campus, unless you can afford it.

I loved the Castilian, I met a lot of great people there and the food was usually tolerable.   After that me and a bunch of friends rented a house a block east of I-35 off of Dean Keeton. The prices may have caught up, but back then it was just as close to campus as west campus, but way cheaper.   What I -will- say is that unless prices have changed, Dorms are just as expensive, if not more expensive than just renting an apartment/house with buddies. Live in the dorms for a year (you can only take so much new responsibility at once!) and after that go have some fun and live somewhere without an RA or rules about what gender your guests can be."

UTAustin,30pxqw,713corleone,1 point,Sun Mar 29 19:03:41 2015 UTC,"u/CF5300 is on point. I'll also add that your VAPA class will be a breath of fresh air. I would suggest arranging your schedule so that there is at least one non-engineering class (arts, history, social science, etc.) every semester. These classes require you to switch gears and was a welcomed change. I took Art History and (surprisingly) loved it."

UTAustin,30phoo,glabius,2,Sun Mar 29 19:30:06 2015 UTC,"IRG is what you make of it because your essentially choosing whatever you want in the liberal arts school.  IRG = like 3 IRG classes. The rest are tracks that let you take a large list of classes from liberal arts. Check out the available courses for the tracks to get an idea by googling the major.  I chose culture media and the arts because it had a ton of courses to choose from. I chose to do Spanish LAS minor, and culture media and the arts - which I used to study mostly religion classes.  For example here are some classes I've taken:  Philosophy of Mind  Philosophy of Yoga  East-west spiritual & intellectual encounters  Sufism & Islamic mysticism  Gender politics in the Muslim World  Mexican Revolution  Latin American Asylum&Detention  Gringomania (class about Latin american perspective of USA)  others may however choose classes more within the economy, or government areas of liberal arts. I just chose what I was interested in.  Most of the classes within liberals arts are cross listed so its easy to hit your reqs with your choice of classes within IRG."
UTAustin,30phoo,quick_quip_whip,1 point,Sun Mar 29 23:18:16 2015 UTC,"Hey. I'm a sophomore international relations major. Relevant information: the major is fairly new, and mostly builds off of combining other majors with a few IRG courses to tie things together. There are several IRG related organizations (International Affairs Society, Model United Nations, Women in International Relations). Personally, although Dr. Anderson (the head of IRG) loves the International Affairs Society, they were disorganized the semester I attended. Work opportunities and internships depend on your interests and departments you connect with. Many people intern at the Capital, or do general government/NGO internships.   You're going to have to choose a language, an area to study (Europe, Middle East, Africa, South America, etc), and a track to choose from (World History, Political Economy, International Security, Culture and Media, and International Environment). They don't have to be related, but in general it helps if you're a language that corresponds with your area of study. There's a fantastic Arabic flagship here (the best in the US) if you're interested in that area.   You're required to study abroad at some point for the IRG major. There are a few great programs connected to IRG which fulfill specific degree requirements for IRG, like UT in Paris, but you can study abroad for however long/whereever. Many people choose a maymester, which is around 6 weeks, but I don't recommend that length because it's extremely expensive for little immersion.   The strength of IRG majors really comes when and if you know what you'd like to do, and pull the relevant classes together. IRG can end up disorganized mess of unrelated classes, or it can be comprehensive. If you have any specific questions, I can try to answer them."
UTAustin,30phoo,whirled___peas,2,Sun Mar 29 17:08:07 2015 UTC,"Seconding what you said about International Affairs Society. It was great when I first joined ~2 years ago, but it really has become disorganized, especially this last year.   I'm a senior international relations major and this guy/girl pretty much covered it. Just coming to say that I considered Journalism when I first applied for UT, but I ended up deciding on IR and I've really enjoyed the program.   Your study track is what's really going to determine what type of classes for the major you'll be taking, since there's only three actual IRG classes(an introduction class, a foundations class, and a capstone research seminar your final semester).   The three main professors involved in the major are Anderson, Holmsten, and Mosser. I've had classes with all three and had really good experiences with all of them."
UTAustin,30phoo,quick_quip_whip,1 point,Sun Mar 29 17:59:37 2015 UTC,"Ok, thank you!!   How do you like your major overall? Since this degree builds off of other majors would it be doable to double/dual major with journalism even though it requires a language, area of study and track? Also, the three tracks that interested me the most was the Culture, Media, and Arts, Science with Technology and Environment, and the International Security tracks. Can you tell me anything about those tracks.    Furthermore, if you don't mind , what track, area of study, and language did you choose? Additionally, what has your experience with this degree been and is the potential for future growth positive?"
UTAustin,30phoo,yagrandmum,2,Sun Mar 29 18:23:29 2015 UTC,"I love it. I only applied to two colleges, because they were the only ones I could afford in Texas which had international relations majors. I'm the sort of person who generally knows what I'm interested in, academically, so I'm able to form a path where the classes work together and I feel as if I'm learning far more than I could without college. I'm not sure, mainly because I don't know the requirements for journalism. I will say, though, that I came into college with over 30 credit hours that applied to my major, and am now taking 2 certificates along with IRG, as well as several additional courses from the Liberal Arts Honors program, and I'm on track to graduate with all of those in 4 years and no summer courses. Though - caveat - both of my certificates and LAH somewhat cross  reference with classes that count towards my track/IRG requirements.  I'm an international security major - what you're looking at there is mostly government and history classes, with several options from the area studies programs. Culture, Media, and the Arts I know almost nothing about. Science with Technology and Environment tends to be heavy in environmental science classes.   I'm an international security, Africa, and French focused gal. The classes are phenomenal, imo. Some example classes I've taken/am taking are Suicide Terrorism, American Foreign Policy, and Intro to Modern Africa.   It's hard to make generalizations about the job field - I'm not worried about my future job prospects, because I make good grades, have and will interned places, work over the summer, am involved in organizations, etc. I think liberal arts degrees within the social sciences/humanities depend on the individual. An IRG degree from UT doesn't look bad, certainly."
UTAustin,30phoo,quick_quip_whip,1 point,Sun Mar 29 19:49:50 2015 UTC,"This information is really helpful, as I am also transferring and looking into IRG.  I am currently a declared history major and considering declaring an dual major with IRG, but I know I have to be accepted into the program.  Can you tell me a little more about that please? How hard it is, what they focus on when looking at applicants, ect?  Also, /u/gibby_10, I highly recommend talking to an adviser, they gave me some great info on which credits transfer and where they apply.  Good luck!"
UTAustin,30phoo,yagrandmum,2,Sun Mar 29 23:15:46 2015 UTC,"I came in as a declared IRG major, so don't know about the transfer process. IRG is one if the fastest growing majors at UT, and a lot of the Liberal Arts students today are in it/were in it at one point. I think as long as your GPA is above 3.0 and you stress how important diversity in thought/multiculturalism/whatever is in your desired track is to yourself, you should be fine.   Though I did add and then drop government second semester, and that was incredibly easy. I made an appointment with a government advisor, we talked over the added classes I'd need, and then the advisor added gov as my second major."
UTAustin,30pkuz,diff_under_int,1 point,Sun Mar 29 16:23:58 2015 UTC,"I graduated from UT with a BS in pure math (and in CS) and am now a PhD candidate at a top 10 program. I have no idea what the Polymathic program is, but a brief glance at the website makes me think this is not the best option if you are really interested in pure math. If you might be interested in applied math, then I would tell you to absolutely go for it.  I can try to answer any questions you have about doing a double major, the pure math program, trying to go to grad school, etc. Just send me a PM."
UTAustin,30pkuz,musketwarrior,-1,Sun Mar 29 21:20:07 2015 UTC,"Oh, and I forgot to ask if there are any tests that I can take to place directly into multivariate calc/linear algebra (or at least calc II). Over the last few years I have self taught very large portions of these, but I have never had a structured environment to work in, so that would be super nice. I challenged the Calc AB test my junior year and got a 5, but then completely and honestly forgot to sign up for BC this year (cursing ensued). So, is there any way I can test out and avoid having to take introductory calculus at UT? I might go batty if I do, but whatever."
UTAustin,30pkuz,Filthy_Fil,3,Sun Mar 29 16:34:06 2015 UTC,Well if you have to take calc 1 and 2 at least you'll get some nice GPA padding.
UTAustin,30pkuz,Stolsdos,2,Sun Mar 29 23:34:37 2015 UTC,"That really sucks about your BC credit as that would get you into linear algebra or multivariate. I think your AB credit will put you straight into calc II, but anywhere beyond that you'll probably have to talk to your advisor about it."
UTAustin,30lqvn,sunflowers12919,13,Sat Mar 28 15:06:04 2015 UTC,"CAP. I did it at UTSA and it was the best decision I've ever made. Baylor is really expensive, even if just for a year."
UTAustin,30lqvn,hookem131,3,Sat Mar 28 17:01:00 2015 UTC,"OP I second this. I loved UTSA. At first I hated it because I didn't want to be there, but honestly its a beautiful and loving atmosphere.    The CAP advisor here would do nothing but put you in classes that were on the CAP list and she wouldn't let most people take calculus here.   Regarding to this I was allowed to take whatever class I wanted. hookem131 were you forced to take certain classes or not to take certain classes?"

UTAustin,30lqvn,Russell_is_kool,1 point,Sat Mar 28 18:00:58 2015 UTC,"Well, the transfer process will probably be easier with CAP. And UTA is much, much cheaper, even for a year.

UT Arlington's classes were much easier than the same classes at UT, and you had guaranteed credit transfer. I realized this and tried to take the most difficult subjects I could, so I wouldn't have to take them at UT and I think that helped my GPA quite a bit. It was also nice because you get to get used to how college works at an easy school, and you have guaranteed admission to a good school after a year. I literally didn't study at all the first semester of college and made one B and 4 As. I think with a bit of determination, a 4.0 at UT is definitely possible.   The school is located in a semi-bad area, but I think the school has enough security that  you shouldn't be scared. If you have morning classes and are driving to school, get there early. From around 8 AM - 12 PM, the parking lots are completely full and it might take you a while to find a parking space."
UTAustin,30lqvn,justduck01,1 point,Sat Mar 28 15:30:15 2015 UTC,"Did they change it to where your GPA from UTA classes counts towards your GPA at UT Austin? Because when I did this (it was many years ago), they DID NOT COUNT. Which sucks for me, because I had 7 A's and 3 B's."

UTAustin,30lqvn,Almiria,5,Sat Mar 28 19:51:55 2015 UTC,"As someone who did a year at UTSA, I can say that the classes were beyond easy. They were easier than my community college classes. Now, a big reason for this is because I pretty much decided I would have no life. I went to the gym a bit, but other than that I had no life other than studying. I easily got a 4.0 in all 10 classes.  I'm assuming the quality of classes is similar at UTSA and Arlington. If so, and you are willing to sacrifice 9 months of your life to obtain your goal, then I would encourage you to go to Arlington. Baylor will likely be harder with a smaller chance of successful transfer.  The important part is to be totally committed. No (or very few) parties. And little time spent on socialization. I saw it as, friends don't really matter because I'm only gonna be here for 9 months. Just suck it up for 9 months and focus completely on academics and you will easily be able to get a 4.0. Best of luck. Let me know if you have any other questions."
UTAustin,30lqvn,Big-Package,3,Sat Mar 28 19:17:08 2015 UTC,"I'm a current CAP student at UTA as well. Like /u/Big-Package explained, don't listen to the CAP advisor if they tell you not to take Calculus/Physics. I'm in Calculus 2 (Integral + Series & Sequences) and the rigor of the course is nowhere near what I expected; Physics is even easier. To answer your question, it isn't difficult to maintain a 4.0 GPA here. This is coming from someone who took 17 hours last semester of the ""hardest"" classes I could take.  Considering that you're wanting to do ME, make sure you have at least Cal 1/2 and Engineering Physics 1 completed as these  are the minimum required courses to apply. Additionally, if you can handle it, take at least one science related course each semester, even if you don't need to. Since CAP students are labeled as external transfers when they apply to Engineering, admission criteria heavily involves the rigor and grade performance of your STEM-related classes. Most of all, make sure you take courses that are actually transferable!  I don't have much of an opinion on Baylor's ME program, but it's pretty expensive and isn't as highly ranked as UT's ME program.   If you have any other questions feel free to inbox! Gl. :)"
UTAustin,30lqvn,trevorcop,0,Sun Mar 29 07:58:42 2015 UTC,"I wish I had done what you had done so much. But I'll just have to take those STEM classes at UT I suppose. I have AP credit available for Cal 1, but I'm afraid of redeeming it and jumping into Cal 2 with a year of no calc. I know you're not an advisor, but do you have any input on that?"
UTAustin,30lqvn,a7c,2,Sun Mar 29 17:04:42 2015 UTC,"I did CAP at UT Arlington, and it wasn't half bad... It's nothing like UT though, don't expect it to be hustling and bustling when classes die down --- it's largely a commuter school (6 years ago, anyways). It was dead on the weekends and during nights. Dorms were still fun, but nothing like UT Austin. Good luck homie.  Edit:   From what I remember, CAP is guaranteed if you make a B average... that's not guaranteed at Baylor from what I know (knew?)"
UTAustin,30lqvn,saradactyl25,2,Sun Mar 29 04:34:39 2015 UTC,I went to Baylor my first year and transferred into UT my second year. I would say it wasn't bad in terms of difficulty but I had the goal of transferring in the back of my mind the entire time so I tried pretty hard to get a good GPA to be able to transfer in. You definitely won't be able to just breeze through. But I guess the same could be said about any school.
UTAustin,30lqvn,krazekidg,2,Sat Mar 28 20:30:47 2015 UTC,CAP. I'm at UT Tyler and it's so easy. making the good grades isn't difficult. I made a 4.0 last semester and the hardest part of everything is the anticiption for Austin. plus hella cheaper.
UTAustin,30lqvn,soopadook,1 point,Mon Mar 30 19:01:21 2015 UTC,"I CAP'd at UT Arlington (my hometown) and I had a pretty decent freshman year. I had a job and lived at home, and I basically made school and work my life. A little lonely at times (would not recommend, making some friends won't kill you) but I got in with a good GPA and UT was all I wanted, so it was worth it for me.  As for Arlington, like I said, I've been here since I was 10 and my dad's a faculty member at UTA. It's a growing city with a lot of cool things to do if you look hard enough. Sports are EVERYWHERE--I've been going to Rangers games for years and they never get old, and the Cowboys are just down the road now, too. Six Flags is a fun day trip, as is Hurricane Harbor, and the shopping areas just get bigger every year. UTA is a really good school with a nice campus and a great little culture going on. It's in central Arlington, and I wouldn't call it the bad area of town at all--a few minutes north, however, it gets a little different. Parking is crazy but there's lots of good food around campus. I think you'll be fine and it was the right decision for me, too.  Good luck!"

The CAP advisor here would do nothing but put you in classes that were on the CAP list and she wouldn't let most people take calculus here. No matter how hard I tried to make sure I took classes I needed, without calculus, I couldn't apply directly to CS or CE, which now means I have to internally transfer into my desired program after I get the required credits. I took mostly all core classes here, and they were all easy. I'm about to finish with a 4.0GPA here with relative ease, as long as you stay organized. I think the CAP program is safer for getting general admission to UT, but sometimes makes it tougher for getting into your desired major. I've also heard there is a new CAP advisor, but I haven't talked to him, so I can't give you any insight."
UTAustin,30mv89,raghavmathur,11,Sat Mar 28 20:59:51 2015 UTC,It varies by teacher
UTAustin,30mv89,stoleyourwaifu,4,Sat Mar 28 21:07:51 2015 UTC,It really just depends on the average and median grades of the class. The teacher can make a 70 a C or a 70 an A depending on how everyone did.
UTAustin,30mv89,PencilMan,3,Sat Mar 28 22:05:30 2015 UTC,It's worth noting that for a lot of courses (at least in my experience) you have to get a C+ in one or more of the prerequisite courses to take them. So D- might be passing but it's not passing enough to get you into other courses that are required for your degree.
UTAustin,30mv89,puffpuffpastor,9,Sun Mar 29 07:50:29 2015 UTC,most commonly a D- will be a 70.   A D- has been a 60 in all of my classes so far

The last one is immediately important to know. Unlike some other possible areas, gpa is crazy important to get opportunities. Most of our interns have 3.8-3.9 goals from great programs. From personal experience my roommates and friends where a: corporate comm major, philosophy/ancient studies, and kinesiology major.

I'll definitely be checking out as many buildings as I can. Does Gregory require an ID to get in?  Thanks for the food recommendation, if I can talk my family into pancakes for dinner we might just go."
UTAustin,30bxx7,wavesandtide,12,Thu Mar 26 05:01:55 2015 UTC,Jester is the quintessential dorm and is usually branded as the most social!

Also, you can try to go to the Jester East desk and ask to see the showroom for a minute, they might be able to go open it for you if there's an extra RA around. And Jester is definitely one of the more social dorms on campus."
UTAustin,30bxx7,ankopan,1 point,Thu Mar 26 07:15:01 2015 UTC,"Gregory does require an UT ID to get in. I know if you were doing a tour with a guide you would be able to see what the inside the gym looks like. Right behind Jester is Clark field, an outside track and lacrosse field.   Definitely pass by areas such as the main tower, Student Activity Center (SAC), the Union. There's also a couple museums sprinkled throughout campus such as the Blanton South West of Jester, Harry Ransom Center a little south of the main tower, and one other museum off of San Jacinto and 24th Street.  There are also buildings that are closed to the public during the weekend. For example, the Gates Dell Complex does not allow students to enter unless they are computer science majors and have the UT ID.  Edit: More places to visit"

Honestly though, the room pictures are online and everything else you can see yourself just wandering around the dorm. The highlights include a full postal room (Jester used to have its own postal code!), a market for students to buy small groceries, dining places, the most popular Wendys in the nation, and the Sanger learning center where students can receive tutoring.  As for things to do, grab a map and walk around UT. See the PCL (our major library), the McComb's building, the FAC (a popular campus study spot!), Gregory gym, the Union building (popular hang out/study space with several eating options), SAC (another great study place for students), and the stadium just to get a brief ideas of amenities offered by the campus. You may hit these on your info session.  Then, see Guadalupe Street. You'll spend a lot of time here as a student so walk up and down the Drag (as its sometimes called). There are a lot of great eating options and stores to peek into. Go into the Co-op if its open to see a bunch of burnt orange merch. :)  If you're not pooped from all this, tour Austin a bit. It's an incredible city. Drive to Zilker park, see Lady Bird Lake, walk along South Congress... Honestly, this is more than you can do it one day, but you'll get a chance to see all the fantastic things an urban city (as hip as Austin!) can offer if you choose to move here next year!"
UTAustin,30bxx7,wavesandtide,6,Thu Mar 26 16:45:08 2015 UTC,Try Hopdoddys its an amazing burger place. Also Trudys and Torchys is pretty good near campus!

If you'd really like walk around the building, poke your head in a classroom or two, take a look at the study lounges (you won't be able to get into Reliant unless someone badges you in).  If you have any burning questions that you think you really wanted answered about McCombs during that session, feel free to ask away. I'm a senior in McCombs and have been a TA in the IROM department for MIS courses for two years now, so I've been a student and I've seen the faculty side."
UTAustin,30bxx7,wavesandtide,2,Thu Mar 26 03:03:02 2015 UTC,We're driving down on Sunday and the tour is on Monday. I insisted that we visit when the campus would feel like a typical day and so hopefully I'll get to see some more activity around McCombs.  Thanks for the input! I didn't actually expect anyone to reply.
UTAustin,30bxx7,wavesandtide,2,Thu Mar 26 05:07:02 2015 UTC,"You'll definitely see activity around McCombs on a Monday. Also it may be helpful to note that a lot of business classes are held across the street in the UTC next to the PCL. In my four years here I could honestly count on one hand the number of classes I actually had in McCombs.   Sorry that the McCombs tour was full, but I think you can get just as good of a feel for everything by looking around on your own. Enjoy your visit to campus! There's so much to see and do here!"
UTAustin,30bxx7,wavesandtide,1 point,Thu Mar 26 05:41:23 2015 UTC,"Have any tips for the next four years at McCombs? How important is being quick to sign up for the classes with the best professors, who were your favorite professors, etc.?"
UTAustin,30bxx7,crankychopsticks,1 point,Fri Mar 27 02:20:30 2015 UTC,"Make sure to get to know your professors if you like them and feel like they'd be cool on a personal level. They'll open a lot of doors for you. I'm lucky to have been a TA and have made so many great connections with the professors in my department, and because of that, I stood out in interviews and had no issues securing a job for post-grad life.  Have a backup plan for course registration. And a back up plan for your back up plan. And probably a back up plan for that. Classes fill up quickly. Don't worry if you don't get a class you want in a semester. Don't worry if you have to waitlist something. It will work out. Fun fact: the fall semester of my sophomore year I was able to register for a total of 6 hours during registration. Through the beauty that is wait lists I started with 15 hours that next semester. Be patient.  Get involved in clubs. I was involved with MISA since I was an MIS major. I got exposed to a lot of great companies early on and made a lot of good connections with recruiters that I still keep in contact with even though I'm not going to work for them right out of college. You never know.  In regards to career fairs, go to them and talk to recruiters. Don't expect any kind of offers or extensive conversations freshman and sophomore year. Just get your face out there and get used to talking to recruiters. That being said, don't feel like you have to go to every company. Pick a handful that look and sound interesting to you and do some research. You'll make yourself look a lot better if you know what the company you're talking to does on at least a basic level. I say this because I've been on both sides of the table. I now recruit for my company and believe me this makes all the difference in my conversations with people.  As far as favorite professors go, I'm extremely biased and all of my favorite professors have been in the MIS department: Katie Gray, Clint Tuttle, Joshua Rock, Edward Doan, Reuben McDaniel, and Rick Byars are all amazing professors that I'm so glad to have been able to work with. Unfortunately my boss, Rick Byars is retiring at the end of this year, and I'm so sad to see him move on after 35 years in the department. Sharek for MAN 336 is amazing as well. Most other McCombs professors I had were pretty run of the mill. Nothing awful, all super smart and qualified people, but not as engaging and down to earth as the MIS professors.  That being said, get into McCombs and don't rush to declare your major. Take some classes, find out what you like, find out what you don't like, and really think about what kind of a career you can see yourself having in that field for a substantial, foreseeable future. If you can't imagine being in that industry for even five years, don't make it your major. Don't chase the money at the price of your own sanity and wellbeing.  EDIT: I just saw you're interested in programming. MIS may very well be the major for you at McCombs since it's really pretty much the bridge between CS/Computer Engineers and businessmen. If you've got any questions about it, let me know. I've TA'd for the Introduction to Problem Solving and Programming course as well as the Web Application Development course. The Intro course will be moving to Python next year and Web Dev will be moving to C#. Both good moves for the program. Also keep in mind that we're ranked #3 for MIS in the nation for undergrad. UT is a good place to be right now!"
UTAustin,30bxx7,pirateflavor,1 point,Fri Mar 27 02:52:53 2015 UTC,I've heard about the value of being close with professors and I'll definitely try my best at that.  Have your ever run into the problem of professors having such thick accents that it ruined the class? My brother was a mechanical engineering major at Oklahoma State and he said almost every professor was impossible to understand. I don't know much about MIS but I thought it was all data structures and data base management and daunting back-end stuff. But web app development sounds like a good time. I'm curious as to the differences between a Business major with a Comp Sci minor and an MIS major. I'm not sure how their careers would differ either. Thanks for all the insight!

I'm a business major (MIS) with a CS certificate (essentially a minor) and it's been smooth sailing for me. I'm not sure if the CS minor does much other than teaching you other languages. MIS isn't all back end. It's knowing how programs work and how they're structured in order to be able to make sure that you can effectively recommend a system for a client. Or make sure that what you have is effective in your own business. You have to know how something works to explain it to someone else. The course sequence is: intro to MIS, problem solving and programming, database structures, web application development, capstone (a case based class), business systems development (a client consulting project class), your internship, and then two electives (they can be as technical or as theoretical as you like. I did one of each)."
UTAustin,30bxx7,adyvee,3,Fri Mar 27 15:26:38 2015 UTC,"A You'll see a lot of empty buildings, some nice architecture -- but for Dinner, maybe Sao Paulo's restaurant. Clay pit too, but that's Indian.   I would suggest BBQ, but Salt Lick is far. You probably have Rudy's where you live, and everywhere else is far or closed. There are a couple I can't rack my brain on for sure.   There is The Carillon at AT&T too, but that's kinda fancy.   If you're willing to drive, maybe Hopdoddy if you're willing to wait, northern one tends to have shorter wait time. Home Slice would work too. I'm assuming mom and dad are coming, but if not there's cheap carbs on the main drag west of campus. Verts, Pita Pit, East Side Kings, and Madam Mam's are local Austin Chain. Torchy's Taco's also."

They have the regular burger or their bulgogi burger which is excellent, both served on this fluffy slightly sweet bun. Their fries are the absolute BEST- it's hard to describe what they're coated in, maybe tempura idk, but they have the best crunch and taste to them. I also like whatever sauce they have there by the ketchup; I think it's a mix of ketchup, mayo, and relish, but whatever it is goes really well on the burger or to dip fries in."

The 3rd floor (one floor up from the lobby, just take the stairs) has the main computer lab and the offices of many of the CS clubs. There's a second lab in the basement that's worth a look as well. Sixth floor is worth going up to for the view of the tower."

I would strongly look into the Masters in Data Analytics program McCombs started a couple of years ago - stay an extra year and graduate with an MBA and a specialty in tech and data. The salary jump is unreal.

It seemed that the Israel block party thing was more there to celebrate the culture of that group, not upset Palestine protestors.  It kind of diminishes the whole idea when every little thing that annoys a group ends up causing a protest. But mainly I was just annoyed that the walkway was being blocked."
UTAustin,30ag9z,Bokononism4Life,10,Wed Mar 25 21:42:46 2015 UTC,Maybe because Israel day wouldn't exist without the oppression of stateless Palestinians which is a big pretty big issue
UTAustin,30ag9z,glabius,3,Thu Mar 26 12:15:28 2015 UTC,The main issue is promoting the state of isreal which oppresses palestinians.

UTAustin,30ag9z,Bokononism4Life,0,Thu Mar 26 21:05:55 2015 UTC,"Don't worry man I try not to make assumptions.  In my opinion, we didn't obscure the sidewalk that badly. Judging by the amount of people who asked what was going on (personally not random people so there room for argument in that random people who dont recognize any of the protesters being more annoyed then made aware) I thought it was rather successful. Also, just my opinion again, the palestinian oppression dosen't have nearly the amount of awerness it deserves."

UTAustin,3091pv,brazilianbunny,0,Wed Mar 25 18:26:10 2015 UTC,Thissss. Swear to god if another person jumps in the road without looking in front of me LDSKJFDSLK:FJSLKDFJSDF
UTAustin,3091pv,PastaTapestry,1 point,Fri Mar 27 22:32:43 2015 UTC,"I'll believe it when I see it... Seems like this has been in the plans for quite some time. Not saying it's not going to happen or that it's not needed... but this plan has been in the works since before many of the current undergrads here were born.  Based on what I could find, this was brought up in early 1995 and added to the campus master plan in 1996. A search for ""ut campus master plan speedway pedestrian mall"" yields numerous results, including several mentions in several of the campus master plan updates over the last two decades. Looks like there was also a fundraising campaign started in 2008, brought up again in 2009, and again in 2010, and again in 2011 to try to raise money towards this initiative. It looks like the 2010 post is the one that is the ""current"" one on the UT ""giving"" site based on the sitemap."
UTAustin,3091pv,mrflarp,1 point,Fri Mar 27 07:29:10 2015 UTC,"This must be why the roadway was cut off back in the early 2000's.  I was a student 1999-2003 and Speedway was a main thoroughfare for cars from 27th all the way to the capitol.  The section between 24th and 21st even had angled parking.  Eventually they cut it off, put up barricades, blocked off the section south of 21st, and it's how you see it today.  I didn't realize it was part of a larger master plan."
UTAustin,309amx,oogaboogabooo,1 point,Wed Mar 25 14:59:11 2015 UTC,"The LBJ School IT staff will be looking to hire a student worker for the Summer who can hopefully continue on into the Fall/Spring. We won't be at this job fair since we currently have a student worker, but he is has an internship this summer and will be looking for employment related to his major going into his senior year.  We'll be looking to hire someone around mid to late-May. It is a Student Associate position that assists us with basic computer tech work. Once we are ready to hire, we will want to move quickly so I thought I would start a potential list of students looking for Summer/Fall/Spring IT work. Shoot me a PM, and I'll contact you once we actually post the position."
UTAustin,306trp,rotorcowboy,7,Tue Mar 24 23:09:13 2015 UTC,"I considered shooting you a PM over this, but looks like you delivered!  Re: the weekly emails, will ITS pick up on inactive devices that I've connected to this network and still bug me?"
UTAustin,306trp,kazaanabanana,5,Wed Mar 25 00:54:28 2015 UTC,"No, it will only notify you of devices that have been seen on the old network within the last week."
UTAustin,306trp,AdamarLives,4,Wed Mar 25 00:55:22 2015 UTC,"Not sure if you can help with this, but ever since I changed my internet speed has been considerably slower on all my devices (laptop, tablet, phone). Any reason for this?"

UTAustin,306trp,litsax,1 point,Wed Mar 25 15:22:58 2015 UTC,Is it still possible to get a public IP?
UTAustin,306trp,litsax,2,Wed Mar 25 03:07:36 2015 UTC,"Not for the foreseeable future on the new wireless network, no. If you need one on your wireless devices between now and the end of May, you may email Networking to ask for an exemption. After that, public IP addresses will not be available on the wireless network. If you need a public address beyond then, you can see if your department offers wired ports that you can use."
UTAustin,306trp,TotesMessenger,1 point,Wed Mar 25 03:13:31 2015 UTC,Does the new ssid support more devices (like gaming consoles)? I know some of my stuff wasn't able to handle the restricted certificate.
UTAustin,308acz,myrloc,3,Wed Mar 25 07:23:55 2015 UTC,"I frequently pack my own lunch. I find that it is a) cheaper and b) more efficient food-wise for me to do so. I don't end up eating nearly as much when I pack my lunch.  When I'm in a bind, I pick up a large chili from Wendy's. 250 cals, 23 grams of protein. Only downside is sodium."
UTAustin,308acz,kazaanabanana,1 point,Wed Mar 25 14:20:56 2015 UTC,"Their Go Wraps on the value menu are a healthy and super-cheap option, too."
UTAustin,308acz,PurpleHooloovoo,1 point,Fri Mar 27 08:26:59 2015 UTC,"I'm in the habit of grabbing one of the hummus cups and a banana or other fruit from O's Campus Cafe when I'm in my office at McCombs or if I'm around ACES. They also do really good soup too. I'm sure sodium is high, but it's not fried and on a bun, so that's a plus."
UTAustin,308acz,wavesandtide,1 point,Thu Mar 26 03:05:38 2015 UTC,"O's is just out of my price range. I can get a fruit cup there for $3, or go to Prufrock's in the PCL and get a bigger one for $1.89. And I've gotten apples with rotten centers from O's more than once, so I'm pretty much done with it."
UTAustin,308acz,PurpleHooloovoo,1 point,Fri Mar 27 08:28:42 2015 UTC,"I try to cook my meals the night before or for the entire week on Sundays. Packing your lunch is much more cheaper than eating out most of the time.   I'm on campus 8AM-10PM some days without a chance to go back to my apartment. I try to pack something that won't spoil quickly. I carry around a lunch box that I'll toss my meals in. One friend I have likes to strap his lunchbox to his backpack so it doesn't take up room inside his backpack.  My go to is a turkey sandwich with lots of lettuce. I'll bring along snacks such as baby carrots, grapes, and energy bars. Other times I'll prepare rice and chicken with broccoli.   I also often mix coffee, soymilk, and protein powder together because it's easier to drink your calories and get my caffeine kick this way.  My experience is a bit different though, as I have access to a locker on campus(paid for), fridge(as a student employee), and a microwave. I usually have an early morning shift and/or late night shift so I'll just drop my lunchbox off in the break room and come by to eat lunch."
UTAustin,308acz,ankopan,1 point,Thu Mar 26 20:34:23 2015 UTC,I'd kill to have access to a fridge. I've considered just sneaking in a spot in a fridge of one of the Graduate lounges
UTAustin,308acz,atomtomato,1 point,Fri Mar 27 02:23:49 2015 UTC,Quiznos in the old student union isn't the worst.
UTAustin,308acz,PurpleHooloovoo,2,Thu Mar 26 23:51:47 2015 UTC,"All those places in the Union are good options, imo! The BBQ is DELICIOUS (baked potato+brisket...not the most unhealthy but so good and cheap) and the turkey plus veggies for sides can be a combo. Then there's the salad bar place, which usually has a decent special. Quiznos, Wendy's, and Taco Bell CAN have healthy options if you order right (Taco Bell protein bowl, hold the cheese and sour cream, don't eat all the rice...Wendy's side salad+value grilled Go Wrap, hold the cheese and get light dressing is <$4...etc)."
UTAustin,308acz,counterlogik,1 point,Fri Mar 27 08:32:45 2015 UTC,"Zen is one of the few vegetarian friendly places on campus, so mostly there for me. Otherwise I bike up Guadalupe a bit to wheatsville or toms, or to the Thai or Indian food trailers west of the coop store"

UTAustin,3036y9,ThrownAwayFromTheBay,12,Tue Mar 24 02:26:03 2015 UTC,"Email under-info@cs.utexas.edu, it will get to one of the CS advisers (this is the generic email for the advising office). Just explain what happened, I'm sure it will be fine. If you don't get a response fast enough for your liking, or are genuinely concerned and want to deal with this as fast as you can, you could go to GDC and ask to make an appointment to speak with one of the advisers. When you enter the building from the front, it's the group of offices on your right. I'm not sure if they'll let you though since you aren't in CS yet, but it's worth a shot."
UTAustin,3036y9,dumebringer,4,Tue Mar 24 04:03:44 2015 UTC,Email sent! Thank you so much for your help :)
