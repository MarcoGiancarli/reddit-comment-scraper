theleaguefx,3cvoes,superdownvotemaster,7,Sat Jul 11 04:04:03 2015 UTC,"I just discovered this show and I've been binging it hard, just started s5.   This show is so good that I love it even though I have 0 understanding of (fantasy) football. I'm not from the US so football, let alone fantasy football isn't even a thing in my country.   From what I understand from the show you draft an nfl team from all players currently in the NFL and then you get points based on how your players perform in the real life matches?"
theleaguefx,3cvoes,POOPING_AT_WORK_ATM,4,Sat Jul 11 11:11:45 2015 UTC,That is correct. I'm sure you can play fantasy football (soccer) as well. I play for fantasy league of legends lol.
theleaguefx,3cvoes,bronerkill,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:26:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, soccer is the #1 sport in my country The Netherlands and now that I think of it there's some websites and stuff that are similar in idea but it's not quite the same. Those are more like simulations and not really based on the real life matches, as far as I know.  What do they mean in the show when they say ""Jenny versus Pete"" or something though? How can individual teams in the league go up against eachother, there's no real-life equivalent of them right? Or do they just mean those teams are really close to eachother in the rankings?"
theleaguefx,3cvoes,POOPING_AT_WORK_ATM,2,Sat Jul 11 16:48:15 2015 UTC,"At the start of the season, before any games are played you ""draft"" players on your team. Based on random order, each person playing in the fantasy league will choose one real football player at a time (except for defense, where you typically just get an entire team's defense, not individual players).  The draft  happens before any real games have been played, so for the first week of NFL, you get points for how well your individual players (or defense) do for the week. Each individual play is typical going to give points in some fashion to everyone involved based on how well they performed. The fantasy game will put together a weekly 1v1 between fantasy players and depending on how well each person drafted a winner will be declared. Then you keep playing a different fantasy player every week until the playoffs which has its own bracket and shit."

theleaguefx,3b78e4,tunaman808,3,Sat Jun 27 02:00:17 2015 UTC,"I saw Nick Kroll on Conan and he said that the plot outlines are most certainly written in advance. The cast improvs the scene 2-3 times to figure out which jokes work and which don't. There are a couple of writers on the payroll that ""sweeten"" the jokes (they had just hired one, and that was who Conan asked him about). They rehearse the scene at least once more, then film it.  So yeah, it's ""improvised"" in the sense that the most of the actors invent their own dialog, but it's been rehearsed several times by the time you see it on TV.  EDIT: Grammar"

Protip: Hugo's Frog Bar next door shares a kitchen with Gibsons but is easier to get into and more relaxed. Plus you can get almost all the same steaks at a lower price. Still expensive, but not as bad as Gibsons."

Been changing it up a little with spreading butter on it before grilling.  I normally make it medium-rare but I don't know if I'm really getting the best flavor I can get.

It's not just the Kroll Show, every week it seems like I see him on another show I watch.  he was a regular on Parks and Rec (probably because of Amy Poehler), and I've seen him on Brooklyn 99, Mulaney, New Girl, Portlandia, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, and probably a ton of others I'm forgetting."
theleaguefx,2yhtx7,oddmanout,7,Tue Mar 10 15:05:56 2015 UTC,I just ment the Kroll show filming was directly interfering with The League's filming schedule which is why we really didn't see him as much the last two seasons.

theleaguefx,2yhtx7,kickpuncher1,2,Tue Mar 10 04:34:38 2015 UTC,the last episode with the blood drive was pretty bad. Just waaaay to over the top. But the workaholics guys have an episode or two like that each season. I think it's for the younger kids that watch it and think it's actually funny.
theleaguefx,2yhtx7,NOODL3,4,Tue Mar 10 14:53:10 2015 UTC,"I agree completely. I kind of fell out of regularly watching the League and Workaholics after the first few seasons of each. I've viewed a few newer episodes of each in the last few weeks and was pretty disappointed. They both seem to be trying way too hard to go over the top and be gross. I have no problem with toilet humor or ridiculousness, but it just feels forced and uninspired on both counts."

theleaguefx,2yhtx7,IggysGlove,6,Tue Mar 10 00:31:23 2015 UTC,Always sunny is completely insane compared to what it was.  They literally just did an episode highlighting it.
theleaguefx,2yhtx7,Ginger-Nerd,12,Tue Mar 10 16:08:17 2015 UTC,"Have you seen this latest season of its always sunny, its by far the most non-formulatic as possible... they recently did an episode that was meant to look like it was filmed in one take, and another where the whole show was set in a game show, another was set solely on an plane.    if there is a show that has broken out of its formula recently, it would be its always sunny."
theleaguefx,2yhtx7,I_Buck_Fuffaloes,6,Tue Mar 10 09:03:53 2015 UTC,"They also did an episode where the gang tries to break out of their usual formula and do new things, and it goes disastrously and shows that they should never stray too far from the formula."

The big bottles come with a booklet explaining how it is brewed and bottled. This particular brand contains deer, bull and ram penis. To ""brew"" it you dry out the dicks and then grind them into a powder. You mix the dick dust with Chinese herbs and other ground up ingredients that the Chinese believe will increase virility (centipede, sea cucumber, etc.).  Next you pour the dust into a barrel of Chinese baijiu (a clear vodka-like spirit made from sorghum).  You let the mix age for 3-6 months and then remove any remaining solid bits. The clear liquid turns brown and smells sweeter (due to the spices).  The finished product tastes like a spicy/nasty scotch.  When drinking at a bachelor party it is best consumed using a penis shaped straw that you stole from the bachelorette party."

theleaguefx,2xvwnh,downwithlevers,2,Wed Mar 4 23:17:49 2015 UTC,That's how I learned about him and got into the League!
theleaguefx,2xvwnh,traiden,8,Thu May 7 19:47:29 2015 UTC,"If you listen to him on How Did This Get Made, he totally plays up the crazy guy thing. Not to Rafi level of course."
theleaguefx,2xvwnh,ActualButt,9,Wed Mar 4 19:04:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'd love to see him do a foxcatcher and show what else he's capable of because I think he could be a great dramatic actor as well."
theleaguefx,2xvwnh,Shalmanese,4,Wed Mar 4 13:35:32 2015 UTC,He wasn't crazy in the Dictator
theleaguefx,2xvwnh,yodamaster103,4,Wed Mar 4 20:56:36 2015 UTC,He was crazy funny
theleaguefx,2xvwnh,stankbucket,3,Wed Mar 4 21:33:51 2015 UTC,I love seeing him do other things.

theleaguefx,2xvwnh,moodyfloyd,-5,Wed Mar 4 19:05:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah I guess, I just keep seeing him (like in P&R) as successful characters and it's just so weird seeing him not only be normal, but actually good at it"
theleaguefx,2xvwnh,AlexR42,44,Wed Mar 4 12:23:52 2015 UTC,"Man, it's almost like he's an ACTOR."
theleaguefx,2xvwnh,djdoodle,13,Wed Mar 4 15:47:39 2015 UTC,"I mean in Parks he's successful but definitely not normal. He's still a dick. It would be weirder for him to be homeless and nice than successful but still creepy/an asshole, IMO."
theleaguefx,2xvwnh,roque72,6,Wed Mar 4 13:54:12 2015 UTC,How dare an actor accept roles that are diverse and can showcase their range as an artist because it breaks some illusion you've created from one of their characters they've played.
theleaguefx,2xvwnh,Carnane,-4,Wed Mar 4 17:07:45 2015 UTC,How dare I make a joke right?
theleaguefx,2xvwnh,Deaf_Mans_Radio,13,Thu Mar 5 00:01:41 2015 UTC,He's teaching at Greendale.  He's far from successful.

theleaguefx,2xvwnh,jeffraider,6,Wed Mar 4 13:10:49 2015 UTC,"He played a fairly normal guy who worked with Paul Rudd in ""They Came Together."" His character seemed fairly nice too, although something absurd happened to him. Also as a warning this movie isn't that good, just using it as an example of Jason playing a different role than he usually does.   It feels like he's starting to show up in a lot of things in small character bits. I think it's cool for him."

theleaguefx,2w6z57,IggysGlove,1 point,Tue Feb 17 15:38:59 2015 UTC,I don't know if you saw it but there is a video on YouTube with Gil & George that is about an hour long. It was moderated by Willie Geist. I'm on mobile so I can't link but try Oh Hello live maybe add Willie Geist in search bar.
