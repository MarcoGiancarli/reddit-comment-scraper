osugame,3e255k,jms8719,38,Tue Jul 21 11:11:22 2015 UTC,"In case you're wondering, this is completely 100% legit.  The guy improved his score as well, 95.51% acc for 1119pp now (UPDATE: 96.00% acc for 1135pp currently). This also makes him be the fourth person ever to reach 10k pp.  Waiting for jhlee to 99% the thing now lol, how much pp would that be? 1300?     UPDATE:  FutabaAnzu just got a 95.36% play on that map for 1080pp. He's now the sixth person to reach 10k pp.  [Tenshi-] also got a 95.87% play on that map for 1116pp.  Cobo- has also now got a 92.52% play on that map for 933pp, and is now the seventh person to reach 10k pp.  MANIA PP INFLATION GUYS     UPDATE THE SECOND:  W1NGS has got a 96.65% play for 1132 pp; although he has higher acc than HNC_yk, he's got less MAX hits and hence less score; HNC_yk remains #1 on that map.  M o g i has got a 93.16% play for 966 pp, and is now the eighth person to reach 10k pp.  F1rstLove has got a 94.97% play for 1080 pp, and has reclaimed #1 in mania.  Mania pp system is so borked...     UPDATE THE THIRD:  Jhlee has got a 99.40% play for 1230 pp! Not as much as I expected for that acc though.  F1rstLove improved his play to be 95.47% for 1084 pp.  FutabaAnzu also improved his play to be 95.70% for 1101 pp.     UPDATE THE FOURTH:  cr1sp has got a 96.31% play for 1138pp, and is now the ninth person to reach 10k pp.  Degeneracy has got a 95.10% play WITH HIDDEN for 1097 pp (FYI mods don't affect pp in mania)  __M A S__ has got a 93.07% play for 924pp, and is now the tenth person to reach 10k pp.  inb4 map got disqualified and leaderboards reset lol     UPDATE THE FIFTH:  jky0308 has got a 96.27% play for 1132pp, and is now the tenth person to reach 10k pp.  rustbell (a.k.a. spro) got a 95.46% play for exactly 1111pp (and has now over 10k pp as well)  Ok, I'm gonna stop doing these updates for now, you get the idea.     THE THREE HOURS LATER UPDATE:  Mania now has FIFTEEN players with over 10k pp.  Jhlee still holds the best score on that map, worth 1230 pp.  There are now 21 scores on the map worth over 1k pp. Basically if you can get >93.5% acc on that, congrats, have a 4 digits pp play.     tl;dr: HOLY FUCKING SHIT PP CITY PP RAINING FROM THE SKY WHAT THE FUCKING FUCK"

osugame,3e254h,Kynan383,5,Tue Jul 21 11:35:48 2015 UTC,No it doesn't.  ACC Matters a shitton. But without high combos your score & also performance won't be as good. Still acc matters like HALF of the pp.
osugame,3e254h,CLICKMVSTER,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:38:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, ONLY HALF on a game mode with no aim, awesome right?"
osugame,3e254h,Darkprince97,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:47:31 2015 UTC,Only two types of notes too. Much less notes than the average mania map add well I reckon. Consistency is actually a thing in taiko
osugame,3e254h,Kynan383,-2,Tue Jul 21 11:52:50 2015 UTC,"This is because the number of notes is infinitely higher, so combo is much harder to keep.  But you can't deny that the amount pp given is being overweighted. A 8 stars play in Standard is worth 650-700 pp max."
osugame,3e254h,fizikxy,9,Tue Jul 21 12:09:22 2015 UTC,"Because it's standard man, it's like comparing star system and PP system in ctb and taiko : you can't. What I meant is that rating a play on it's combo is dumb, whatever the game mode. It's like if in ctb you'd get PP depending on your ACC instead of your combo, it would be retarded as hell."
osugame,3e254h,Kynan383,4,Tue Jul 21 12:27:48 2015 UTC,"people always keep arguing to make the game based on acc and not combo system, but why? the aim factor is just crucial in osu!standard, there is no comparable rhythm game that works with that. second even if you were not able to hold combo, your acc would just break with a few misses so it would change literally nothing, you'd get 98% plays with 1x100 and 15 misses, how does that make more sense? and as third, osu!std to be not based on combo would really mean it would need to be way harsher on accuracy, and decrease the hit windows even more or make higher ODs to be an accurate reflection of skill. (and ofcourse make sliders not be free 300s)    (unless you were implying that combo scoring is fine, then just ignore this lol)"
osugame,3e254h,jesha1995,3,Tue Jul 21 19:18:46 2015 UTC,"I just find it absolutely retarded that a 90% ACC FC gives more pp and score than a 99% 1miss run. And as you said, missing reduces ACC anyway so why base it on combo?? Sure there's an aim factor, but imagine that 100% ACC means 1M score, then combo wouldn't matter and everything would work just fine and no one would give a flying fuck. People don't watch combo in mania, ""FC"" is just a special thing that doesn't affect your score, why would it in standard? I just find it retarded and meaningless to reward aim over EVERYTHING else on a rhythm game, even if it requires aim."
osugame,3e254h,houndbluedragon,3,Tue Jul 21 11:44:21 2015 UTC,"praise it man, I don't like how the combo system works with pp but people should be rewarded for high acc. Prefer something with the likes of 5% pp reduction per miss next to the acc loss and pp not being combo based.  So that people can actually be rewarded for sick ACC runs on hard maps but they missed midway and that fucked everything"

Actually, combo matters, and here you can see the hit punishment will hurt your score badly for a miss and that's where getting 300s and keeping combo is important. Combo is the reason I had a 94.95% play end up better than my 95.5% play of Mastication Numerique. Lost roughly 6pp."
osugame,3e254h,kHeinzen,2,Tue Jul 21 12:39:02 2015 UTC,"It's performance points. In standard, people like seeing FCs more than anything else - put videos of a 99.8% caviar [Gangsta] DT 1xmiss on YouTube, and a 98% FC, and the second one will get more views."

osugame,3e2hqb,kHeinzen,3,Tue Jul 21 18:43:25 2015 UTC,"Interesting but like every time this is discussed there are two issues for every solution. Low bpm maps with right angled jumps are incredibly hard to read (bandiria travelers for example).  Your idea would claim it to be rather easy to read because the note density would be average and the overlap would be low.  A 240 bpm ar10 map would most probably appear as ""harder to read"". Another issue is that sliders can be far easier to read than normal notes in some situations and in other situations sliders can be played without even knowing they're slides.   There are so many factors that come into reading that solving one issue generally creates more than it solved and of course there will always be anomalies."
osugame,3e2hqb,kHeinzen,0,Tue Jul 21 19:28:07 2015 UTC,"Implementing a core feature into fully-functional game is always very risky...   As for these issues you mentioned about. I think they can be solved quite easily, but somewhat brutally. Simply adding some aim and reading boost to these sliders with extreme angles. Smaller sliders could be worth as many ""reading points"" as normal note.  EDIT: Apparently my example code should work perfectly on this ""badiria travellers"" map, because of the low AR. I wish there was a place to discuss this feature in detail..."

FL or EZHD should grant  pp too. The only time FL is viable is only when it's combined with DTHRHD.  Also, seeing rrtyui's Dopamine or Big Black plays give no pp just hurts. Seems like high level nomods also give no pp at all."

In the end, high acc plays, on hard maps, while also beating other players in the leaderboards, would be optimal imo."
osugame,3e2hqb,Yomu-,2,Tue Jul 21 13:31:52 2015 UTC,"Completely agree with you on this but is ppv1 not at fault for popular maps, where loads of players achieve a score, giving way too much pp?"
osugame,3e2hqb,Ted_the_red,2,Tue Jul 21 14:25:04 2015 UTC,"You had to beat (or, back in ppv1, tie the scores) to get pp. If you simply FC'd something but didn't beat anyone you wouldn't get anything.  The problem was that the system interpreted a tie as ""if you can tie, you can beat him, so we will give you pp considering that you did beat the person"".  That's why maps that were full of HDDT SS without spinners gave a ton, because if #1-#xxxx on the map were ties, even if your score was exactly the same but you got placed at, let's say, #666 on the map, the system thought you'd have the potential for #1 and give you peppy points.  Not sure if that was confusing, go horse OP"
osugame,3e2hqb,Doctissimi,2,Tue Jul 21 14:44:20 2015 UTC,"What about being outspun, or in CTB getting less bananas for example? Would the system penalize you for those measly few points? I always liked ppv1's ""beating other players is a factor"", this was the only hiccup I ever had with it."
osugame,3e2hqb,vanishingstapler,3,Tue Jul 21 15:12:47 2015 UTC,"I am talking about a mix between ppv1 and ppv2. Where harder maps are rewarded more. I am not saying that everyone should stick to SS'ing things.  Generally beating other people in the top50 should be rewarding, on the contrary of what happens today.  This would force players to not only get a good run, but also practice not-choking as you can often see people who get lower acc beating someone with higher acc in the leaderboards because of early/late 100s, 50s.  About spinners, they became quite irrelevant in ppv2 and IMO they should stick that way. THey are the gameplay-aspect that requires the less amount effort to improve. And judging by the fact that harder maps are rarely a spin battle, they would most likely remain that way."

osugame,3e2hqb,Championman6000,7,Tue Jul 21 15:51:24 2015 UTC,"I think it would be better if missing once near the middle of the map would be the same penalty as missing once near the end. I don't really like the combo aspect of the score system Imo. I wish we could do away with the whole combo system in general and replace it with an accuracy system where score is pretty much dependent on acc, and hit error is a bigger penalty to acc. Also if it was possible I feel it would be better if you got penalized depending on whether you missed during the hard or easy part in a map."
osugame,3e2hqb,FancyMancis,5,Tue Jul 21 14:04:53 2015 UTC,"My thoughts:  Missing is like ""dividing"" the map in two or more.  SSing the first half of the map, missing, and then SSing the rest of the map is like you SSed one map and SSed another map. You shouldn't receive the same PP as someone who SSed it till near the end. It just doesn't make sense to me.  This same thought goes to your last sentence, you get penalized not when you miss, but rather get a 100 or a 50 during the hard or easy part accordingly."
osugame,3e2hqb,Painketsu,3,Tue Jul 21 16:20:20 2015 UTC,"Many maps that use sliders for difficulty need to be more valuable, but the algorithms for properly estimating their difficulty don't exist, so right now it's just using minimal paths. Things that will need to be accounted for include slider release time, fast repeat sliders, and movement on sliders with directional changes. Mad Machine, Forgotten, Valkyrie Dimension DT, etc, seem underweighted. Accuracy pp probably needs to be more generous at high bpm streams, and perhaps less at lower bpm (thinking of Ice Angel). Pattern difficulty based on challenging overlaps, angles, and spacing would be needed to perfect the system, but making algorithms for these seems even more challenging than for sliders. Peak difficulty and average difficulty present complex tradeoffs when it comes to using combo versus accuracy for pp. Where peak far exceeds average, a combo system can catch people that missed on a difficult part (unless the peak is near the start/end) so they don't get 6* pp for only playing the 4* parts perfectly. Where peak and average are close, an accuracy based system will likely better represent actual skill. The only way to get rid of these tradeoffs is to have per-hitobject data, but this would require major changes to replays, which means it might not happen unless we see other major changes, such as with scoring. At the moment, hidden and flashlight have bonuses depending on map metadata (like AR and length), rather than on detailed map content. This is yet another place where objectively estimating difficulty is hard."
osugame,3e2hqb,Ippikiryu,2,Tue Jul 21 17:24:21 2015 UTC,"Make acc/quality of the run in general (number of misses/sliderbreaks) MORE important than the maximum of combo you get on the run. (Don't know if that would work for every map(high bpm/hard readable patterns), but in most case for me, the run in hitself should count for more than the combo)"
osugame,3e2hqb,GlitteryGoose,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:08:18 2015 UTC,"That would create a huge amount of problems with just missing at every hard part. Yes there are some cases like this with maximum combo right now such as best friends tvsize where the only hard part is at the end, but much more often the hard part is around the middle or there is multiple.

osugame,3e2aa4,Pohjis,3,Tue Jul 21 18:13:11 2015 UTC,"As people said more than once, it's just that mania top players don't have enough hard ranked osu!mania maps to truly show their skill level, so they're sorted by accuracy grind on (relatively) easy maps.  I don't think the solution to ""there's no maps for them to play"" is ""don't rank hard maps"".  But that's besides my actual point, that even if there's anything wrong with the pp algorithm that overrates that much this specific map, it still isn't a good enough reason to disqualify it, because the algorithm can be fixed even after the map has been ranked."

And since you're admitting you are unsure about the difficulty of the plays I don't see why you're making strong statements in regards to the pp it should give because you know little to nothing about it. If the other maps are too easy that just means maps of the same difficulty should be made and there's nothing wrong with how much pp it gives.

osugame,3e2sxq,number1cookiezifan,-1,Tue Jul 21 15:06:56 2015 UTC,"Maybe it's not anything impressive, because there are many better mouse players than him, but I for example never seen or even heard about Cookiezi playing with a mouse and I would never expect him to be that good with it. Also it's the other thing when you see a mouse player setting another great score with a mouse and the other when you see a tablet player doing one (first?) run with a mouse.  Also it was something different, something new that you're not seeing everyday, probably not going to happen ever again."

Then Emperorpenguin comes: ""Oh, look! Glitter Goose has found an easy map..!""  Glitter Goose: "";-;""  I wonder how does it feel being rekt everytime you reach an insane score. Like rrtyui getting rekt by Cookiezi on maps like FDFD or Airman for example. (I don't mean to be rude here)  And since I'm nearly sure Glitter Goose will see this, can you still read ""low"" ar? like 9-10.3. Many high ar players are losing their abilities of reading lower ar and I'm curious how does it work for incredibly high, like 10.8 or 11. And what's harder? OD or AR in DTHR?"
osugame,3e1bhw,Exemmar,2,Tue Jul 21 07:41:13 2015 UTC,"Then Emperorpenguin comes: ""Oh, look! Glitter Goose has found an easy map..!""

osugame,3e1bhw,Exemmar,2,Tue Jul 21 12:12:10 2015 UTC,"I know he can still read AR10 since he still plays a fair amount of HDHR. I think I read somewhere that he regrets not being able to read AR9, though."
osugame,3e1bhw,GlitteryGoose,2,Tue Jul 21 12:07:51 2015 UTC,"It's actually more ""Oh look Emperorpenguin has done this map with bad acc, I'll beat him so he has to improve his accuracy."" The only reason I take his number 1s on maps that I cannot 99%+ is to make him 99%+ them hopefully - I just want to see good scores from him which he isn't otherwise motivated to do. I really was hoping he would 98% this map, maybe I'll do it again so he has to improve.  No I can't read anything below AR10 and the AR is the harder part for me since I seem to have decent acc.  Also this map is very hard and I'm sure Emperorpenguin thinks it's one of the harder AR11 maps that is doable as well."
osugame,3e1bhw,Exemmar,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:00:15 2015 UTC,"By ""easy"" I meant that most of plays I watched were done on low stars maps with simple patterns.

That said, the pen is way shittier build wise and uses batteries, while the actual tablet surface is fine. Drag players also have a better time on the Huion tablets since the surface is less tacky, meaning your pen won't get caught or anything of the sort.  I think if you already have a bamboo there's no point switching, but if you want to keep the longevity of your bamboo for art then switch to the little osu tablet for osu strictly."

Then wacom pen does not require a battery and the pen is much more easier to grip imo>also the pen of the osu tablet is much ""bigger"" so it was a bit hard for me to find a good grip>since the pen of the osu tablet requires a battery and the pen is bigger than usual then pen is also heavier. Finally the hover range of the Osu tablet is a bit smaller than the range of the Wacom tablet which can be sometimes annoying when you are playing maps with screen jumps and then your cursor suddenly dissapears. tl;dr: Wacom Tablet: - pen feels light, requires no battery                                - hover range is quite far            Osu tablet: - pen is a big too big>hard to grip it                            - pen requires a battery                            - hover range is a bit smaller"

osugame,3e0pkl,Brikery,5,Tue Jul 21 08:04:53 2015 UTC,"Two general approaches I've seen work: 1. psychologically convince yourself to ignore the stress (""this play is nothing special"" OR ""I don't care if I miss"" mentalities). 2. condition yourself so your ""stress threshold"" is relatively high. You don't get nervous when FC'ing a 1 star map right? expand that range by FC'ing things that are *easy for you* until you can FC closer to your skillcap without feeling stressed out.  *easy for you varies based on skill level and comfor levels, where you practice will be a personal choice you will have to make."
osugame,3e0pkl,Ranguesy,3,Tue Jul 21 06:41:43 2015 UTC,"The easiest way to overcome those adrenaline rushes is making the thing, that induces the adrenaline rush, a common occurance.  Look at it like this. You get that adrenaline rush as your body's reaction to a potential thread, in this case that would be missing a note/ breaking your combo. To some extent, you'll always get this when you get far into a song, that is right at your skill level.   Get to a higher level of consistency and you'll see, that those adrenaline rushes become easier to handle. You have to be sure of your motions, insecurities will just make it worse.   The more often you experience them, the sooner you'll learn to deal with them."

osugame,3dya5m,TLATER,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:18:05 2015 UTC,"hitting the corners can cause something like mouse drift, since it resets the cursor to the center.   Uhh.. then it would instantly snap back to the right place again on the next report, no?  The whole point of absolute positioning is that it doesn't matter where your position was on any previous report, if your pen tip is 80% of the way to the right and 60% of the way up the tablet, that's where the cursor will snap to on screen immediately. It can't drift"
osugame,3dya5m,-Aeryn-,0,Mon Jul 20 19:05:28 2015 UTC,"No, not when the tablet's area is larger than the window and you are using cursor speed settings, at least not using wine.  It's still absolutely positioned, the ""area"" you play on just moves a bit. You scroll through the window as many times as the cursor speed setting dictates and then you move into the area next to the window.  It's strange, but it does make sense if you think about how this is probably implemented. The window is supposed to take control over the exact cursor position, but scrolling outside it (due to cursor speed mandating it move further than the position of the actual pen) causes the window to move it back.  I'd record it for you, but I'm nowhere near my decent computer for the next month and a half.  It might be a (possibly wine-only) bug, but I'm not really bothered by it because you never really touch the corners anyways, and if I were bothered I would fix my settings. I'm sure anyone who's seen it could.  It's just an interesting note because this means tablet doesn't necessarily mean no drift (even though technically I guess it isn't) ;)"
osugame,3dya5m,TLATER,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:49:22 2015 UTC,"It's still absolutely positioned, the ""area"" you play on just moves a bit   That's not how absolute positioning is supposed to work at all, i'd say it's just bad implementation of something in osu or the tablet driver.  Cursor speed settings do not apply to tablets. It's quite useless, and anything trying to scale cursor movement as if you're using a relative positioning system instead of an absolute one is quite likely to either do nothing or have really strange side effects. You should not be using anything other than 1.00x cursor speed in osu for any reason when using absolute positioning on a tablet - if you want to go faster or slower, change the absolute positioning area to be smaller or bigger.  you're describing behavior that is not supposed to happen"

So I bought one. After spending all the money on batteries.  Switching to a tablet from mouse is relatively easy, it only took me 2 days to get my skills back.  Also, if you are buying a tablet for only Osu, you might want to consider the Huion 420. (http://www.huiontablet.com/420.html or http://store.ppy.sh/store/product/1) It is considerably cheaper than other tablets as it is made for Osu.

osugame,3dtqoq,Yauxo,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:39:39 2015 UTC,"To keep it simple, if there's a very strong beat for example, the map will reflect that in a very strong something (big Jump, quick Kickslider pattern etc)  If the song is slow, one could use low SV, no jumps at all etc. to reflect that.  Sometimes people also adjust their Sliders to fit to the vocals (for example, if the vocals say ""left left left"", the Sliders would go to the left)"
osugame,3dtqoq,HiImNoob,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:59:18 2015 UTC,Isnt that what most mappers do lmao
osugame,3dtqoq,Athrun_Yamato,2,Mon Jul 20 11:54:57 2015 UTC,"Depends, really. You can go even deeper into that topic.  Imagine Beat A is very strong, Beat B is strong and Beat C is normal. The mapper wants to empathize these accordingly, so Beat A as a very big Jump, Beat B an average sized Jump and Beat C is normal.  Other mappers might not care too much about that and they put Beat A and Beat B at the same distance.  Next, the vocals in the music are long, they feel kinda ""round"". So what does the mapper do? He uses a round Slider. On the other hand there's an electronic sound after that that keeps its pitch. This is now mapped with a straight Slider.  As last, imagine a streamheavy section (some xi song) where the piano becomes more intense the further you are into it. Instead of keeping the same distance throughout the entire Stream, the mapper adjusts the spacing to fit to the pitch increase/intensity.  Theres more of that ofc, but these examples should be enough."

osugame,3dsvk4,Sambanisse,24,Sun Jul 19 03:25:18 2015 UTC,"gangsta is certainly underrated, but mostly i'd say ice angel is way too  easy to be a 600+ pp map."
osugame,3dsvk4,genesislol,8,Sun Jul 19 05:21:08 2015 UTC,way too easy? Jesus the circles feel like they are made for ants. The spacing since like 2k combo ongoing until the end is completely retarded on HR and it's has over 3k combo which needs amazing consistency to even get a 99% Acc. I think Ice Angel is perfectly rated in terms of PP.
osugame,3dsvk4,OsuletteMuffin,3,Sun Jul 19 15:36:24 2015 UTC,"Well sure, small circle size but doesn't really have any jumps to go along with it. The spacing isn't extremely hard like a couple of dragon force maps. The map's BPM is only 168 and basically the only thing hard is to keep good accuracy since it's nerve wrecking. I think it should be around 500 PP for 100% acc."
osugame,3dsvk4,Sambanisse,6,Mon Jul 20 00:16:50 2015 UTC,"Do you really think it's the best score of all time? Because that's what it is in terms of pp. I'd go as far as saying this score being top rated play of all time illegitimizes the whole pp system.  Well if people dont realize how overweighted this map is right now, they will when all the hard rock players have this score as top play in a few months."
osugame,3dsvk4,RationalCube,16,Sun Jul 19 17:21:11 2015 UTC,"Gangsta is ridiculously short and not OD 10. Also CS 4 makes it ""easier"" and it's only 235 bpm, which isn't that fast for a high-level DT song.   Look at the PP difference for 95% as well. Since Gangsta is so short but so hard it gives a lot of PP no matter what your acc is, whereas Ice Angel is really a test of consistency in streams, aim, and stamina. To be honest, I think both are pretty fair in how much they're weighted in PP."
osugame,3dsvk4,asthuno,24,Sun Jul 19 05:06:51 2015 UTC,"gangsta goes up to like 300 bpm, pretty sure xilver agreed on the fact that ice angel is overweighted as fuck. Its an amazing score but 600 pp seems like way too much, its a score lewa/bikko could probably get if they tried as much as xilver did (which isnt a lot). I feel like 600 pp scores should be unique, not easily obtainable by getting great acc on maps with a lot of circles."
osugame,3dsvk4,Imthenewfish,9,Sun Jul 19 05:41:44 2015 UTC,His acc is what makes that score unique. 3000 notes at that UR is fucking insane. The real problem is mappers making 6+ star maps OD8.
osugame,3dsvk4,silmarilen,3,Sun Jul 19 11:43:07 2015 UTC,"not easily obtainable by getting great acc on maps with a lot of circles.    see, that's the thing here, it's not easily obtainable. otherwise there would be more scores like it."
osugame,3dsvk4,Quiesce7,6,Sun Jul 19 13:01:54 2015 UTC,"Both are hard in different ways. Gangsta DT tests your aim, and Ice Angel HR tests your consistency."
osugame,3dsvk4,sellyme,7,Sun Jul 19 03:33:42 2015 UTC,Ice Angel has 2042 circles. Gangsta has 208.  An SS on Gangsta isn't even remotely comparable to an SS on Ice Angel in terms of accuracy. Call me when anyone ever gets an SS on a 2000+ circle OD10 song.

osugame,3dsvk4,Kenshin_Osu,-15,Mon Jul 20 04:59:16 2015 UTC,"gangsta is like less than 1 min with dt or w/e and sure it got some insanezor jumps and stuff but if some über pro l33t speedaimer like, rrtyuk, hvic, reimu................ would retry it they would for sure be able to fc it (proved by rrtyui) but getting 100% on a 6 min 6.5cs od10 map it's a whoooooooooooole other story. You can't really compare it but tbh I'd say an SS on ice angel would be harder :s"
osugame,3dsvk4,silmarilen,12,Sun Jul 19 05:00:22 2015 UTC,"Then explain why image material HR ss gives nearly the same PP Is that more a fair comparison? Image material is a bit longer, OD10 and streams twice as fast. Plus no FC yet on nomod how that sounds? http://i.imgur.com/dcw66Cu.png"
osugame,3dsvk4,Forgd,3,Sun Jul 19 05:58:16 2015 UTC,"image material may be longer in time, but that's not what pp looks at. when we look at length in hitobjects it's only half as long as ice angel."

osugame,3dsvk4,-vEZ,-8,Sun Jul 19 05:26:12 2015 UTC,"I disagree. It's just that no one is good enough (Maybe hvick, but he only plays anime maps) yet. The thing is, if you fuck up just slightly on accuracy on ice angel, your whole run is over. The difficulty spike for Ice Angel isn't before 2k Combo, so you first actually have to get to that point. On the other side, most pros can get to the difficulty spike on Gangsta almost every single time. All it takes is one very lucky run."
osugame,3dsvk4,Jacezero,5,Sun Jul 19 05:56:08 2015 UTC,Also image material HR SS is around the same pp Thats wierd... http://i.imgur.com/dcw66Cu.png

osugame,3dsvk4,silmarilen,3,Sun Jul 19 04:39:20 2015 UTC,Long HR scores are worth a lot (but only if you have acc to back it up)
osugame,3dsvk4,YOGURTOVSKY,0,Sun Jul 19 09:42:44 2015 UTC,Yeah but almost 800pp for Cry Thunder HR 93% is kind of ridiculous.
osugame,3dsvk4,silmarilen,3,Sun Jul 19 11:16:05 2015 UTC,no it's not. the best score right now is a 94.90% accuracy nomod with 16 misses. do you honestly think anybody will even get close to a 93% acc hr fc for the next 2 years?
osugame,3dsvk4,Sambanisse,-3,Sun Jul 19 12:58:54 2015 UTC,"Do you honestly think no one will? Aren't you underestimating top players a lot? In the past 12-18 months the best players out there grew immensely, and there's still much room for improvement."
osugame,3dsvk4,RouSGeLi,3,Sun Jul 19 13:45:24 2015 UTC,"i dont think i am underestimating the top players no, but you may be underestimating the difficulty of the map.  but leaving that aside, why do you think 800pp for cry thunder is overrated? it's 8.5 stars, that's 1.5 stars more than freedom dive nomod and still a full star higher than freedom dive hr.  it's even 0.85 stars higher than time freeze, which is about 0.6 stars higher than freedom dive and worth 111pp more at 95% acc. if you extrapolate that, assuming the relation between pp and star rating is not linear (which is most likely isnt based on a graph of mania pp i saw on the osu forums one time) and add the higher od it's not hard to believe cry thunder hr will be another 300pp higher."
osugame,3dsvk4,1stSlash,-4,Sun Jul 19 14:26:45 2015 UTC,"The top players didnt really improve that much, Rrtyui and cookiezi are still the best and no one is close to them yet.  Hvick keeps getting crazy hddt scores, but it doesnt necessarely mean he's improving, just spending more time farming."
osugame,3dsvk4,lee97_08,3,Sun Jul 19 17:15:01 2015 UTC,Gansta dt gives pp for jumps and ice angel gives pp for accuracy so obviosly ice angel SS gives more pp. Gansta is underrated for its constantly chaging bpm that makes it hard to keep accuracy on it.

osugame,3dv6i4,Edoexplosivepawn,4,Sun Jul 19 20:38:52 2015 UTC,"1.1k with 25.3k playcount. Playcount sucks, stop using it. We have nearly the same playcount but you have HALF the hitcount.  Hitcount requires you to actually play and it's not as easily gained as playcount, so I use that as a metric.  Also you have 8B total score and I have 47B; what's happening in your plays?"

osugame,3dv6i4,By4jiri,3,Sun Jul 19 21:21:05 2015 UTC,"Playcount doesn't mean shit, you will never know how much of it are tv size or marathons/longer maps. Plus, every single play where you get 10.000 points or so it's counted so people who retry a lot will have higuer playcount.  Even though it's not 100% accurate either, total hits is a better indicator. It depends on how hard is the stuff you tend to play too. At the end who cares if you have more PC than someone? osu! is purely about self-improvement."

osugame,3duuqk,TwistedJay,4,Sun Jul 19 18:22:14 2015 UTC,"I think a big limiting factor for a lot of people in terms of singletaps is your liftoff distance. Liftoff distance refers to the distance you raise your finger above the key between singletaps.   By definition, a smaller liftoff distance will allow for faster singletaps, but it often comes at the price of comfortability. Yes, most practices will become comfortable after a few days of practising them, but you should still strive to find a balance between your liftoff distance and its comfort.   For me personally, my liftoff distance is not quite perfect, but I'm still able to singletap upwards of 290 BPM on a good day.     You should also be aware of which part of the hand you're using the singletap. I suppose it varies on a person to person basis, but as a general statement, I believe that singletapping with the majority of the action emanating from your wrist is faster than primarily using your finger.   Here's a slightly extreme example.    If you find that neither of these are your issue, then it comes down mostly to practice. I'd like to reference an analogy I made in a previous post:   Bahamete: ""When I say 'play Freedom Dive 1000 times' in response to people asking how to improve at streaming, they never do it, but boy did it work for lovu and I.""   I'd like to take this quote as an opportunity to construct an analogy. The way I see it, improving stamina and speed in osu is akin to running. At first, while your performance may be subpar and undesirable, the most important thing is to just keep going. It's more important to stretch your limitations (within reason) than to achieve perfect times immediately. This is applicable to both long term practice and singular performances. Even if your play on Freedom Dive is 30% with 1000 misses, the most important part is just to play through the whole thing to push your hands.    When I was practising my singletapping speed, the most important thing for me was to strain my hand to its limits. Once I reached exhaustion, I took a break, did some stretches, and went back at it again.     Good luck in your practice."

Especially for me, since I can't give my opinion on singletapping speed, I alternate...so yea.  Nice formatting, keep it up.    One thing I want to say:     Even if your play on Freedom Dive is 30% with 1000 misses,...     Please, always keep in mind, that you should play something you're actually able to play. You should push your hands, that's true, but your tapping is only related to streaming speed, not to stream aim. If you can't properly aim it and you go out of sync with the notes after 1 second, you are better off choosing a map, where you can actually play the patterns and still push your speed. When you are ready, you can return to get the hang of the aim.    From your someone's comment:     if you take breaks when your hands hurt you should be fine     Please don't do this. Your hand is not supposed to hurt, it's supposed to feel a bit sore. This should only happen at the very end of your session, when you can give your hand all the rest it needs. In between, it should only feel tired. Playing with a hurting hand is one of the easiest possible ways I can imagine to end your osu! career early.  Don't destroy your hands, please. You might need them in the future."
osugame,3duuqk,osuSero,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:55:50 2015 UTC,"""if you take breaks when your hands hurt"" is from another user, but yes. You shouldn't overexert yourself.     I don't think it's 100% necessary to pick maps that you're able to get Bs or As on. I guess this comes from someone who's completely mind-blocked on Freedom Dive (most stream maps of equal or higher difficulty are much easier for me), but I still found that playing through it and reaching that soreness was essential to the development of my speed. I'd say that my stream aim isn't bad, as spaced streams are not too obnoxious for me.  But, I do agree with your point to an extent. If it's your first day playing, don't start spamming Freedom Dive. You need a foundation of basic skills before you start working on more difficult mechanics. Stream speed to that extent should not be of concern at that point.     Horizontal rule masterrace \o/"

osugame,3duwjs,SgtPenguin47,4,Sun Jul 19 21:27:59 2015 UTC,"I'm quite confused as to what you are referring to.   Comfortability comes first in what instance? Tapping? AR reading? Pen grips? I thought this would be a very broad statement on those trying to deviate from their initial technique leanings, but you only mention AR throughout the rest of the diatribe.     The reason people can't read old maps is primarily due to the strange and largely unintuitive patterns. In a map like this, it is nigh on impossible to read the speech that is mapped in the latter half of the map. Moreover, old maps lack the flow that has become so necessary in more modern mapping. Maps strive to make it feel like one note leads to the next one in tune with the song, while older maps just tried to line up with the song while creating difficult and often geometric patterns.   Yes, lower AR is another part of the problem, but I don't think people tell others to read low AR because it teaches one to read at a ""comfortable speed."" It teaches players to make the effort to read each individual note instead of merely reacting to the approach circles as they appear.     When my ar10 reading was still developing, the slower parts of difficult maps that use AR10 were often troublesome. Like in the very beginning of NANO DEATH!!!, I occasionally had a miss in the intro just because I wasn't able to react fast enough to the circle appearing without any hint of it beforehand (lack of flow). It's akin to playing an Easy difficulty with ar10. It's not as simple as it seems on the surface. Meanwhile, the more difficult or quick parts had the flow that allowed me to presume where the next note would appear before it actually did.    ""When stamina issues occur whilst playing comfortably, you have reached a state of consistency that you can't match otherwise.""  What? I'm completely befuddled as to what you're trying to express here. Doesn't having stamina issues while everything else is comfortable imply that you need to work on your stamina?"
osugame,3duwjs,SgtPenguin47,0,Sun Jul 19 20:21:14 2015 UTC,I wasn't talking about ar10. Comfortability in your grip & tapping so you can focus on the map.
osugame,3duwjs,lilelf29,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:28:09 2015 UTC,"I think a better term to describe what you're speaking about is ""muscle memory."" You could instantly have comfort in new grips or tapping styles, but being able to do them without thinking requires practice and nothing else.  I can guarantee the general incompetence at old maps is not because people have not attained enough muscle memory/comfort."
osugame,3duwjs,agubelu,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:20:13 2015 UTC,Being very comfortable when you lack desk space is pretty much impossible to achieve. I've been using the same grip the entire time I've been playing and it still feels like shit along with my consistency :D

Better than trying to twist the truth. example: If he knows he's the best, you damn well bet that he is going to tell you straight up."

osugame,3dq8bq,JosephLeee,29,Sat Jul 18 12:25:11 2015 UTC,RRTYUI IS BEST. BEST. BEST. all you need to know
osugame,3dq8bq,moofen-,18,Sat Jul 18 12:46:58 2015 UTC,He and Niko were the only ones who could somewhat keep up with Cookiezi when he was still unbanned. Niko and Cookiezi were banned because of stupid reasons and rrtyui was the top player for some time and an inspiration as C was before him. after some time SnowWhite (Hvick225) became really good and people started saying that he's the best. rrtyui is probably still the best (after C) but we don't know because he hasn't played or taken his rank serious in quite some time. that's why there's so much hype about him coming back.
osugame,3dq8bq,SaftigMo,16,Sat Jul 18 12:51:21 2015 UTC,"Niko wasn't really in contention with cookiezi nor rrtyui. He may have the potential to get to their level but like he said himself from an interview with him: What took him hours to do, cookiezi/rrtyui can do in 10 minutes."
osugame,3dq8bq,SuzumiyaCham,5,Sat Jul 18 14:59:53 2015 UTC,i don't know for sure because i was really bad when they were still unbanned but didn't C say that he thought niko was the best after him?
osugame,3dq8bq,SaftigMo,3,Sat Jul 18 15:15:44 2015 UTC,He actually said Niko was better than him. Of course he wasn't being serious but he said that because he likes Niko as a player.
osugame,3dq8bq,SuzumiyaCham,-10,Sat Jul 18 15:35:08 2015 UTC,I don't think it's even a debate that rrtyui is better than snowwhite.

osugame,3dq8bq,heyitskry,-9,Sat Jul 18 13:41:55 2015 UTC,That's like people saying sw is better than C because he's faster
osugame,3dq8bq,ensio9,6,Sat Jul 18 13:45:05 2015 UTC,It seems to be subjective to how you value speed or aim or other stuff to people who argue for either side. I just think both are amazing at the things they're good at.

Lots of high level sports players, such as soccer players at the professional level (since it's the study I remember reading) have had tests done as they play.   Brain activity actually falls as they lull into a trance where they instinctively react and play with a higher level of skill than they would otherwise. It's a really interesting phenomenon since it goes to show that our conscious mind isn't always totally in control of our more focused actions.   It's usually attributed to a high level of focus, so you're not alone! I'd say it's a really common thing, especially with long, technical maps."

In terms of key words, look up Sports Psychology, and the mental processes surrounding high level play in sports. One study that focused on this concept can be found here.   And though it might seem strange to equate very physical sports with osu!, the psychology behind the intense focus and trance-like state have been suggested as being nearly universal across many different, psychologically engaging activities.

osugame,3dpz74,Edoexplosivepawn,1 point,Sat Jul 18 11:43:28 2015 UTC,3800pp is 6.9 rank

osugame,3dpz74,Litejason,2,Sat Jul 18 13:06:30 2015 UTC,"So growth has been nearly linear? That's good, makes it easier to catch up."
osugame,3dpz74,TLATER,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:59:29 2015 UTC,I think it's safe to assume it's linear. I'm not sure if any data from ppv1 will mess up the ppv2 line though.
osugame,3dpz74,Litejason,2,Sat Jul 18 18:14:24 2015 UTC,"I think osu data is very interesting. Generally growth is exponential, because word of mouth just works like that, but in this case it doesn't seem to be.  This either means that the osu learning curve is steep enough to prevent word of mouth from doing its thing well (about as many people stop playing fairly soon as new players come in) or the pp system is strong enough to make exponential growth in players linear in rankings (which a good ranking system should do IMO, although this is probably hard to achieve since you need to eliminate most farming).  I'd love to know if there's some magic number at which new players stop playing/start cheating. It would give a good estimate of how patient people are :)"

osugame,3dpz74,CoonFight,2,Sat Jul 18 11:58:39 2015 UTC,Maybe a popular qualified map that he hadnt played got unqualified? I guess there could easily be 55 people that dropped due to something like that

He has to put that in his head everytime he's playing. If he's not 100% sure of the answer being ""Yes, i'm 100% a mouse+kb player"", it means that in a corner of his head he's still a mouse only player and therefore will never be able to switch playstyles. (so, he should not switch and just stay with mouse only honestly)  2- Maybe he's just not made to be a keyboard player. Maybe he is just meant to be a mouse only player. Some players can't play mouse, some players can't play tablet, some players can't click on keyboard, some players can't click on mouse/tablet. It just depends on the person.

This will set you back maybe 110 dollars including the actual games (unless you pirate, which I have no objections over :D).  However, eventually you will want to buy a dao if you are planning to play iidx for a long time.  If you know you like the game, you might as well buy a dao.

If you expect tons of people on it to be used specifically as a chatroom, I'd open up the irc and xmpp gateways instead of making everyone use a featurless slack. Also I hope you have a couple of programs to manage the place because you'll need them for more than 5 people if you dont want to pay for every user.  eh I run a slack for modding and mappers in the osu community - contact me about that one ingame ID is _dog  (not just a chatroom since we have a dev team to program mapping related features :-))"

Are you sure it's not just that a lot of people passed you, and then after submitting the score, you just ended up losing fewer ranks, than what you would have lost otherwise?  If your score gave x ranks, and you lost 90+x ranks without updating/submitting a new score, then it would result in just losing 90 ranks."
osugame,3dt61k,osuSero,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:50:09 2015 UTC,"Ok here's what happened.  Score gave x pp but I got -90 right after. I still got ranks for the US though. The guy below me was ""higher in rank"", but lower in the US and pp. Then later I got more pp, only this time my rank did update for both ingame and profile. Now I checked again and on the leaderboards it's the same thing again. I am higher in pp and US rank, but my profile shows that I am lower."

osugame,3dt043,Hm0ney,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:21:29 2015 UTC,I upgraded to a larger monitor because it was 144hz and it took less than a day to get used to. It's a far smaller problem than changing your sensitivity.
osugame,3dt043,ChrisMiuchiz,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:26:46 2015 UTC,It should only take you a few days at most to adjust. Probably less than a day though.
osugame,3dt043,Bauxe,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:24:31 2015 UTC,I did the math for it and changed my sensitivity. So if my new resolution is 1.5x bigger than my old one I go from 1x sens to 1.5x sens. So far everything seems the same.

People change over time and it would be only fair if peppy looked at C's appeal with no bias.

There’s nothing to prove you aren’t just watching a bot or cheater playing. Also, please, don’t spam my email or twitter asking me to consider unbanning other players. Do not bother making petitions. Bans are between our team and the player in question. In this particular case I’m willing to add that the “player” sent me (personally) and the support team a series of rude emails which were both out of character of someone of their calibre, and not appropriate to even begin the appeal process. Be careful who you idolise and realise when it’s time to move on."""

This post is what Tom is talking about in his ask.fm.  Listen, it's clear that peppy doesn't like him and he may have a good reason for it, but Cookiezi hasn't really done anything against the rules after the ban(except the burstlimit account) and in my opinion his appeal deserves to be looked at fairly just like any other player's."

osugame,3dtlb8,osuSero,0,Tue Jul 21 15:33:23 2015 UTC,"Problems I see:   you have to use headphones in public, which could be strange depending where you are input lag when using touch (you'd have to tap before you hear the sounds -> pretty bad) the feel is different - for some this would be ok, but for others (including me) it would be too weird to even bother with it the other big part of streams is aim; using all your stamina to tap all day is very one-sided practice   Personally, I'd say anything that reduces the game to just tapping practice without a goal is not helping - you may get better, but you won't have any fun doing it for extended amounts of time. It's just dull and drains your motivation to actually play.   But that's just me."

Try playing easy/normal songs and see if you can SS them if so then go to hard and see if you can score 97%+ accuracy and if so you should be fine. It's not needed for everyone but clearly I needed it haha without it I was in only 80% accuracy.

osugame,3dr3xn,Litejason,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:25:51 2015 UTC,I know. I'm never gonna say a single thing because apperently a 4 day ban is a great punishment for someone who said hi to somebody in chat. I realize that speaking in Russian was not allowed in #osu but I said hello literally right after he said !FAQ. And I didn't even type in russian. I just wanted to say hi to the guy
osugame,3dr3xn,number1cookiezifan,3,Sat Jul 18 17:30:55 2015 UTC,"i mean you broke a rule (which you knew was a rule), you could've just said ""Yes, I am russian"" or something  i don't really see why people use #osu, it's just a shitfest."

osugame,3dr3xn,Soulgee,3,Sat Jul 18 17:34:00 2015 UTC,"was this in #osu?  well, that chat is english only, so you broke the rules."
osugame,3dr3xn,Bauxe,0,Sat Jul 18 17:34:53 2015 UTC,"Yes I did. I'm just arguing that a 4 day ban isn't worth it. I realize that it can stack, but my earlier ban skipped everything and went to 2 days because of an accidental link I posted of hentai in #osu."
osugame,3dr3xn,Bauxe,2,Sat Jul 18 17:41:48 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying it's a decent sentence either, but you should just avoid breaking any rules ever and you won't get punished for anything."

It might be ok to downvote me from time to time for no reason, but when I see other people's comments downvoted for no reason it ticks me off. Like sure, target one person, but please wipe the shit out of your ass and use your time on something other than downvoting, maybe then you'd probably grow up.

Keep in mind that _index - someone entirely capable of 600pp scores with insane accuracy - got 7.25 times as many 100s on this map.  _index's score (544pp) is pretty representative of what most people think this map would be worth, but that's because getting 99.8% acc on an OD10 marathon is completely unheard of. It's completely inhuman and I'm not sure there's a single player who could match it."

osugame,3dlmkg,Bic_Bun,2,Sat Jul 18 00:37:33 2015 UTC,There are very few HR players and even fewer who could come close to that acc. And keep in mind that 99.5% is still 2.5x as many 100s as 99.8%.
osugame,3dlmkg,sellyme,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:09:47 2015 UTC,"tbh, i think it's very fair. 8x 100 on a 3k combo 6.7 star cs6.5 od10 map? i can see that being the best score set so far in the game since there isnt a single other score like that  now if you said it wasnt the hardest map fc'd i would instantly agree with you, but you can't discard the accuracy."

osugame,3dlzjp,lolisamurai,0,Fri Jul 17 16:16:00 2015 UTC,I don't know if I'm fucking up somewhere but it seems correct to me.  http://ask.fm/Tom94/answer/111988370126   The combo multiplier for pp is (score's combo)X / (map's maximum possible combo)X . X is tuned to be 0.8 for osu! standard at the moment.   combo: 886 max combo: 936  8860.8 / 9360.8 = 0.95703164548  we have to reverse the combo break multiplier so  581 / 0.95703164548 = 607.085463416   The miss multiplier for pp is Xscore's amount of misses where X is currently tuned to 0.97 in osu! standard.   misses: 3  0.973 = 0.912673  607.085463416 / 0.912673 = 665.173028474
osugame,3dlzjp,BananaOoyoo,3,Fri Jul 17 19:31:30 2015 UTC,"Your math with the given formula is correct, it's just that the formula isn't a 100% guarantee of the PP value."
osugame,3dlzjp,lolisamurai,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:39:49 2015 UTC,oh I kinda get it now. well it'd probably still be ~650
osugame,3dlzjp,TheRealShotzz,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:43:53 2015 UTC,"its because the 580 pp has the accuracy pp in it, which is independent of combo/misses. with the formula you multiply that accuracy pp though and get too much."
osugame,3dlzjp,Pohjis,-6,Fri Jul 17 22:16:53 2015 UTC,"That seems very overweighted tbh. It's a great play and all but FCing this can't be worth closer to 700. His acc would've obviously been even higher without the misses.  Edit: You can feel free to disagree but i urge you to actually watch the replay yourself. That's not a 700pp play, misses or not. Even though i know you guys love to circlejerk around any new hvick score."
osugame,3dlzjp,number1cookiezifan,-1,Fri Jul 17 14:40:53 2015 UTC,"The map itself is pretty overweighted, even if you don't FC the end part you can still get a nice amount of PP because there's only 1 other hard part.

osugame,3dlzjp,Jetzu,4,Fri Jul 17 10:51:58 2015 UTC,This map is relatively easy compared to jumpy maps with similar star rating. When it first got ranked a lot of people suspected it's going to be DTd soon.  I think yamamesita also got nice pp from it?    EDITS: Broken englando
osugame,3dlzjp,hohol545,7,Fri Jul 17 10:43:44 2015 UTC,"It has only 2 hard parts, the rest is 5 stars max. As long as you fc the first jumps and don't get too many misses at the end, it'll be pp"
osugame,3dlzjp,realdeal111111,4,Fri Jul 17 11:01:36 2015 UTC,"Sure the jumps may not be ""hard"" but this song has really high bpm. Here's Cookiezi trying it with DT"
osugame,3dlzjp,hohol545,4,Fri Jul 17 12:53:51 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying that the jumps aren't hard, they are really difficult, but  the second jump section is so far at the end that you really don't need to fc them to get pp and the first is early enough that you can spam retry until you get a lucky.  IMO rafis,pupu, enju etc. can get a score like this without hidden and maybe lower acc"
osugame,3dlzjp,number1cookiezifan,2,Fri Jul 17 13:17:07 2015 UTC,Deleted the hard parts and the map is only 4.68 stars.
osugame,3dlzjp,Rryui,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:53:35 2015 UTC,The jumps are disgusting... But maps with one hard part that makes the whole map 2 stars more is deemed to be overrated!

osugame,3dlzjp,Exemmar,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:55:21 2015 UTC,"Just like in DT gangsta's case - get a nice combo, survive until the end, enjoy the pp rain. Congratulations on the play though, it's definitely hard, but in my opinion it's still overrated as hell. Hvick's FC on that map is just a matter of time and once he'll do it, it will be probably 600-650pp range."

osugame,3dqabl,OmegaRipper501,2,Sat Jul 18 12:37:46 2015 UTC,possibly a temporary bug in pp calculation for your profile

osugame,3dmfvu,SirBlackMage,18,Fri Jul 17 17:29:29 2015 UTC,"O-Ok  As usual, don't take it srs :)  Snow capped trees surround the two able-bodied pp-gaining monsters as they caress each others bodies without the presence of civilisation around them. What was merely considered ""training"" became so much more after such a short amount of time for the two beautiful men as they quickly became the apple of each others eye.   Mount Peppy, where they stayed was infact the Japanese Batcave. It's deceptive ""rocky"" facade served as home to members of the GUNDAM project and hosted the world's largest parties with invited guests being the largest pp farmers in the world. After Cookiezi's explosive return to osu!, albeit using offline play, the Taiwanese prodigy and current world #1, el hvick225 took an immediate re-interest in the man he once called 'kami-sama'.  He was noticed by Cookiezi by donating $4000 in eroge fap material, as he knew Cookiezi and him had a shared interest in cute 2D girls. This had startled Cookiezi during stream, and had immediately asked how the eroge-loving Taiwanese could ever be repaid.   3 days later, his 10,000pp dong was farming the everloving shit out of the Korean overlord.   While the slider velocity remained low-key for this point in time and they both were enjoying the hugging in this part of the occasion, there was an evident lack of happiness on Cookiezi's face.   ""You look sad. What's up?""   ""Nothing..."" replied Cookiezi seemingly distant from the conversation.  ""Well I'm gonna hit your deepest parts to wake you up!"" proudly exclaimed hvick in a strong but caring tone. Taken aback by the sudden proclamation, Cookiezi made a reflex reaction to prepare himself for the biggest pp in his life.  The Oriental beauties began to unbutton each others shirts. Cookiezi's face began to blush with ever increasing might, but hvick acted quickly to rectify the awkwardness Cookiezi felt.  He unzipped his pants to reveal the pp of a god, unquantifiable to any mere mortal. hvick himself began to turn Cherry MX Red but somehow it managed to calm down Cookiezi which was what hvick wanted.  ""I-I've heard you're the current #1 on osu! How about you show me your raw single-tap power?"" asked Cookiezi still slightly speaking in a embarassed volume. There was no chance for hvick to refuse his wish, he knew what he was there for, and that was the most beautiful korean he had ever seen.  He began to pound away at him with his 10 inch tablet pen with 10,000pp of pure muscle to go. It was such an impressive display of accurate streaming speed however as slider velocity increased, so did hvick's unstable rate. This seemed to not bother Cookiezi, as his ecstatic look on his face showed everything that needed to be said to hvick.  ""D-Dayuu~ S-S-Sto-Haaaaaaa~"" screamed Cookiezi as he could feel his keycaps breaking from the raw tapping power of the Taiwanese legend. 300BPM quickly felt like HT as they approached the deathstream together.   ""I'm going to try with Hard Rock now"" said hvick in a slithery voice as he repositioned himself in order to gain maximum accuracy. The unstable rate was ballistic, Zac started playing in the background, eroges had started playing on the PC, it was all on for the affair of the two gods. As Cookiezi felt weak at the knees in pure ecstasy he felt the final stream approaching.  ""AR10.3 SO EASY"" screamed hvick as he unleashed the last of his stamina onto Cookiezi. The words ""Full Combo"" echoed in both their minds, as they collapsed to the bed together.  ""EZ to get pp."""
