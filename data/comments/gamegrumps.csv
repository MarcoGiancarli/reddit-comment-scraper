gamegrumps,3e3a51,UndeadMeme,34,Tue Jul 21 17:29:40 2015 UTC,"For a game with ""Adventure"" in the title there sure is a lot of ""Don't you DARE go ANYWHERE but this specific path"" in it."

gamegrumps,3e3a51,LOLmouseLOL,3,Tue Jul 21 18:23:44 2015 UTC,"Well, since the main idea of the game is going forward as fluid as possible, going backwards usually isn't an ideal way of keeping with this philosophy. Sonic games always have branching paths, but they're rarely (if ever) actually behind the player. Some branching paths are more hidden than others, and most of the early levels in Sonic games have fewer paths. For obvious reasons."

gamegrumps,3e3a51,Travisv27,7,Tue Jul 21 18:16:56 2015 UTC,"It's a Sonic game, and some of its appeal comes from whipping around at the speed of sound around crazy twists and turns.  During these points of the game, exploration is not the key focus.  It's not like this is the only level of the game and there's never any chance for exploration in the game at all.  In fact, there are plenty.  Just look at the hub worlds."
gamegrumps,3e3a51,swag_fiend,8,Tue Jul 21 17:36:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah but even compared to other sonic games this is very linear. 2D sonic games, and generations  would have tons of branching paths and hidden shortcuts you can take. Not so much here."
gamegrumps,3e3a51,UndeadMeme,13,Tue Jul 21 17:50:16 2015 UTC,"Really? Because, if I recall correctly, the point of Sonic 1-3 was, depending on how fast you were going, your momentum could help you find hidden paths and secrets. Go up a ramp slow and you'll just get to the top of it, but if you hit it fast you might get to a platform in the sky. It's kind of strange how Sonic's focus went from ""secret paths and shortcuts"" using the mechanic of speed to speed BEING the focus."

gamegrumps,3e3a51,Tekno-pathetic,2,Tue Jul 21 17:59:40 2015 UTC,"I completely agree.  Even though it was pretty obvious that several of the deaths were Arin's fault; (i.e. The first wind tunnel he kept jumping and falling off of) if a game doesn't support that  and causes an unintentional player death by something as simple as pressing one button or turning the wrong way, the game is broken."

gamegrumps,3e3a51,Kamunami,2,Tue Jul 21 17:55:47 2015 UTC,"I said an ""unintentional"" death, as in one that was not specifically designed as an obstacle.  I completely understand that many platformers are designed to have precision platforming as a form of challenge, but something as ""scripted"" as the wind tunnel shouldn't have a way for the player to die by simply pressing a different direction on the controller."
gamegrumps,3e3a51,Chozothebozo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:07:02 2015 UTC,"I thought you meant unintentional like, from the player's perspective, which... Yeah but I get you now.  Still though, the wind running segments just aren't as scripted as you imagine. The point is that you have to go fast, like running on water segments of other sonic games. You may not have to navigate, but you HAVE to keep your speed up or you'll fall and die. Is that not completely intuitive?"
gamegrumps,3e3a51,Kamunami,2,Tue Jul 21 18:17:47 2015 UTC,Sonic games are more or less obstacle courses. They're designed for you to work your way through it. Trying to leave the course or go backwards will just mean you failed at it.
gamegrumps,3e3a51,SilverSights,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:42:06 2015 UTC,I mean... at least Sonic 06 let you explore
gamegrumps,3e3a51,Jeskid14,2,Tue Jul 21 17:43:17 2015 UTC,"Sonic 06 is like the opposite of Adventure in terms of controls. 06 is slow enough that you can technically explore, but he's so damn sticky to control. Sonic Adventure, meanwhile, is like you put butter on Sonic's shoes and he's incapable of walking in a straight line.  Out of all the ""Adventure-style"" games, Sonic Adventure 2 controlled the best. Heroes/Shadow felt buttery like SA1, and SA2 had decent traction but only 1/3 of the game was fun."
gamegrumps,3e3a51,Butter_Is_Life,2,Tue Jul 21 17:46:22 2015 UTC,"Sonic 06 has a much bigger overworld than SA1 where you were pushed to talk to NPCs. SA1 is just going from point A to B and that's why some people disliked it.  Sonic 06 stages are also unnecesarily big and makes you swap between characters. SA1 Sonic/Tails/Gamma routes is just to go straight forward, while Knux/Big is more to look arround and Amy has some puzzles.  Again. You can't whine about Sonic Boom not focusing on speed like any Sonic game for then go to game which all it does is making Sonic go fast and make it his biggest flaw."
gamegrumps,3e3a51,necroneechan,18,Tue Jul 21 17:57:48 2015 UTC,"It's super easy to see, especially in this series, why Arin doesn't like Sonic games. Even beyond shit ones, Sonic is not really a game that rewards slow exploration. There's obviously alternate paths and secrets, but you could see Arin several times stop and explore areas before going forward, even though as the viewer I know there was nothing there. I'm not saying this is a bad thing, I'm loving this series so far. It's just funny how Arin's preferred playing style with games just doesn't mesh with Sonic at all"
gamegrumps,3e3a51,Macaluso100,16,Tue Jul 21 17:26:29 2015 UTC,At 9:13 did those rocks just exploded in a fiery fashion when sonic hit them? Well I guess that makes sense everyone knows how volatile BRICKS ARE!
gamegrumps,3e3a51,FishPaste13,33,Tue Jul 21 17:12:23 2015 UTC,"For those of you who played this game extensively as a kid, is that invisible windy road scene as non-intuitive as Arin makes it out to be? I mean, all you have to do is keep running and not jump whatsoever right? I'm just asking."
gamegrumps,3e3a51,OptimisticPsychopath,48,Tue Jul 21 17:10:08 2015 UTC,"Considering there's a Tikal point that literally tells you JUST KEEP GOING literally one character length before the checkpoint (which Arin got and didn't read, as per usual). It's fine. Arin's just bad at games as per the norm, nothing else to see here."
gamegrumps,3e3a51,Mikomaxless,4,Tue Jul 21 17:12:50 2015 UTC,What's the point of that section though? How does running in one direction make for good gameplay?
gamegrumps,3e3a51,dylansan,15,Tue Jul 21 17:26:17 2015 UTC,"Arin and other people might disagree, but you don't always need to have gamepaly 100% of the time in a game. The loops and other scripted running sections of Sonic aren't meant to be some kind of challenge, they're meant to look cool. After the scripted running section you get back into gameplay with collecting rings and attacking enemies and such.  Of course I'm not saying Sonic doesn't have flawless game design. The actual gameplay parts are still pretty boring as well. But I'm just saying it's okay for a game to have scripted sequences like that."
gamegrumps,3e3a51,CowThing,7,Tue Jul 21 17:43:14 2015 UTC,"It's okay to have them. This game feels like it relies on them.  And it's personal of course, but I don't find them exciting or cool at all. The bumper section in particular are way too fast to even see what's going on."
gamegrumps,3e3a51,dylansan,2,Tue Jul 21 17:44:53 2015 UTC,"Of course, but if the whole scripted scene is moving too fast to keep track of, then what's the point?"
gamegrumps,3e3a51,Teostran,20,Tue Jul 21 18:10:22 2015 UTC,I think this game relies a lot on aesthetic rather than actual gameplay. It's not as bad as Arin seems to make it out to be though.
gamegrumps,3e3a51,Pally321,9,Tue Jul 21 17:38:03 2015 UTC,"I've noticed over the course of three episodes that Arin and Danny are really hammering this game. I mean, its a pretty bad game by today's standards. But that's the thing, seems like they are treating this game Sonic Boom generation standards... or even by GameCube standards. It was made around the same time as Ocarina of Time and even by those standards it was only technologically fine but not necessarily revolutionary gameplay wise."
gamegrumps,3e3a51,TheOldNewGraig,8,Tue Jul 21 17:52:11 2015 UTC,They want the next Sonic 06.   They did the same thing with Shadow the Hedgehog (like jumping on the electric rail over and over) it didnt work there either cause it was 06 levels of bad and you can tell.
gamegrumps,3e3a51,Tekno-pathetic,4,Tue Jul 21 18:07:23 2015 UTC,There are plenty of bad games that can give that Sonic '06 feel without actually being Sonic. But sadly there is a stigma that every Sonic game is just Sonic '06 from a different time period. And sometimes that's true.
gamegrumps,3e3a51,TheOldNewGraig,4,Tue Jul 21 18:12:07 2015 UTC,"It's considered a set-piece. They're very prevalent in most older Sonic games. Things like the corkscrew in Sonic 2 come to mind. They're just there to look cool and fast. Not that it makes for good gameplay, but it's Sonic thing."
gamegrumps,3e3a51,docscott,14,Tue Jul 21 17:40:54 2015 UTC,"Because it's fun. If you don't stop and keep running throughout the level, it's really really fun. There's no deeper game design theory to it, running in the sonic adventure games was just really whimsical. Remember this game came out the same year Ocarina of Time did, these kinds of games just didn't exist anywhere else."
gamegrumps,3e3a51,Rokusi,3,Tue Jul 21 17:36:15 2015 UTC,"Games some times have set pieces. Things that are just cool to look at while you get to the next thing. That's part of playing games. Mario Galaxy, a game that is among the best games there are, has you taking a break from running around after each planet. The travel to another planet is largely for show. It's a little break and you get to take in the world. With Sonic, it's bonkers action-y set pieces here and there. Both are part of the charm of their respective games."
gamegrumps,3e3a51,TheColorsDo,2,Tue Jul 21 18:15:26 2015 UTC,"It's not about the gameplay in that section, it's about making you feel like you're fast and fluid."
gamegrumps,3e3a51,RyanB_,7,Tue Jul 21 17:36:13 2015 UTC,"It just feels like a large chunk of the Sonic games are the game telling you which button to press, and then you press it, and the game does all the work and takes you somewhere.  Personally, I can't imagine those segments making me feel fast and fluid. Mainly because I'm not doing anything at all, the game is. If anything, the game should allow your controls to interact with the game, slowing you down, changing to a different path, etc.  Now that I think of it, I think Sonic Boom did do that aspect better, as all the long running or rail gliding scenes allowed deviations from the path for other items and stuff. This game is like taking a tour of these environments. Tours that are way too fast and jerky to get anything out of it."
gamegrumps,3e3a51,dylansan,4,Tue Jul 21 17:43:18 2015 UTC,"Sure, but is there anything wrong with that? If you don't like it that's fine, but sometimes I just want to play something a bit more cinematic. I don't need to be in control all the time for every game"
gamegrumps,3e3a51,RyanB_,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:00:16 2015 UTC,"Sonic Boom was terrible at speed, but at least seemed fine as far as not having you careen off the game.   Sonic Adventure 2 had levels that were a little wider and a little bigger. There's still scripted moments, but it's not as much of these fine hallways as you see in SA1."
gamegrumps,3e3a51,Butter_Is_Life,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:48:07 2015 UTC,"SA2 still was a very linear game most of the time, unlike classic Sonic or even Colors or Generations"
gamegrumps,3e3a51,EpicRive,2,Tue Jul 21 18:18:22 2015 UTC,"For sure, I meant more in line of how you traversed the individual levels. There was more space to the left and right of you rather than narrow hallways, and there were also the Mystic Melody boxes lying around in each level. It was a little less claustrophobic than SA1 on a level to level basis, even if it didn't exactly have branching paths (or heck, even a hub world like SA1)."
gamegrumps,3e3a51,Butter_Is_Life,2,Tue Jul 21 18:19:31 2015 UTC,"But you aren't doing anything, how is it supposed to make you feel fast and fluid? You hold forward and Sonic does shit.  That's it."
gamegrumps,3e3a51,doctorvonscience,2,Tue Jul 21 17:48:58 2015 UTC,You don't do anything during movies. Does that mean you're incapable of feeling anything?

gamegrumps,3e3a51,orangegluon,3,Tue Jul 21 17:44:28 2015 UTC,"To me (and I'm fairly sure I'm crazy and half deaf but) it sounds like Arin jumped a time or two in the middle of that wind road. But honestly that road causes unexplained deaths even in the original less bugged Dreamcast version. So it's a little bit if column A and a little bit of column B.   But as for those numbered jump pads, all you have to do is press jump till its over. Though I'm sure there is something wrong with the way they ported this game, so even that could be bugged and not working properly."
gamegrumps,3e3a51,TheOldNewGraig,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:45:47 2015 UTC,"It's funny because I recently replayed it and did the same thing he did (although I didn't touch the Tikal light). I jumped into it because the other sections involving wind required you to jump. It took a couple of tried for me to realize 'oh you do nothing'.  What's funny is that there's a second section like that but you hit a booster right before, meaning you know not to jump, since that's how the boosters work. What if they had put a booster in the first section and omitted it in the second?"
gamegrumps,3e3a51,ListentoGhostface,0,Tue Jul 21 17:34:32 2015 UTC,Dont  jump off the wind road. Run along it  Its the simplist thing in the world. Arin knows what hes doing.

However, most games from that era were a bit of a mess. 3D games from 1998 didn't really age well with a few exceptions, and on top of that Sonic Adventure was a launch title on new hardware.

I usually hate when Arin riffs on a game because it doesn't usually deserve it, but half the time in this game sonic's either going so fast as to be uncontrollable/off-camera or the camera makes the level borderline unplayable.  This game has not aged well, yet people are fighting Arin as if it's still 1998."

gamegrumps,3e3a51,Pally321,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:39:16 2015 UTC,"Exactly. The 3D Mario games from Galaxy to now are pretty linear. They are some of the best platforming games ever made. Rendering polygons does not commit you to an open world. People who think that way are shackled by the design language of Mario 64.   It's my belief that Sonic Team thought that platformers had to fit that model, which is why the Adventure games (and their successors) aren't good. That style isn't how all platformers need work. It isn't until the boost games that Sonic Team really figured out how Sonic could work in 3D. And those games do work.   Sorry for the rant. I just get really irritated when people just dismiss the Sonic games. And it's because I'm invested in the series from childhood. There are elements that stand to be defended from cavalier dismissals."

gamegrumps,3e3a51,RyanB_,3,Tue Jul 21 17:39:53 2015 UTC,"You are at points in the game.  But it's still a Sonic game, and some of it's appeal comes from whipping around at the speed of sound around crazy twists and turns.  During these points of the game, exploration is not the key focus."

Super Mario World is a bad game. Do you see how that is obviously a bad assessment of Super Mario World? The common complain against Sonic games is that they're just running and jumping. That's fucking platforming. You run and you jump. Sonic is just different than Mario in that the focus is on clearing the level while maintaining momentum. You do that by finding the best paths and committing them to memory. You can judge that, for yourself, that is not fun, but that doesn't, by itself, make the Sonic games bad.   Lots of other things make them bad. Like poor implementation of gameplay gimmicks, not clearly communicating goals in the language of the game, shit level design, garbage narratives, not fucking finishing and testing the games, etc.   The core idea of Sonic is good, plenty of good Sonic games have slipped through the cracks and show how this kind of platformer can be fun. It's just that many more have been made that are broken as fuck."

More importantly, there are plenty of parts of the game where exploring and experimentation are key aspects to completing the level/finding secrets.  Arin is just choosing points where you should obviously take the straight path to instead wander aimlessly like an idiot which promptly leads to his death, and then he complains that the game is terrible."

gamegrumps,3e3a51,Tekno-pathetic,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:17:10 2015 UTC,"This is a silly response. It's not true that exploration/open world is better than linear games. This game is a linear game, so it doesn't make sense to treat it as open world. There's limited exploration. Sonic games let you explore to get to different paths, but the idea is to learn the routes that clear the stages fastest. So the optimal way to play is after you've played a few times and can get to the right paths.  Also, the ""adventure"" in the title is not the ""adventure"" describing an open world, but rather describing the adventure of playing through the story. The story, not the gameplay is the adventure. And its probably titled Adventure because this was the first time in which there was a whole narrative to accompany the Sonic levels. It was going to be a real narrated adventure."

That wind part Arin died at multiple times? The game told him to hold forward and not jump, and he just kept jumping and dying because he didn't read or listen, as usual. Plus they criticize the game for going too fast, but in reality that's not a valid criticism. The game is made to go fast. If you can't handle the speed that the game moves at, that's not the game's fault, that's yours. What makes this game bad are the terribly outdated graphics, the awful voice acting and lip syncing, the boring boss battles, and almost every campaign aside from Sonic's. Also Casinopolis.

Like all the human models and realistic cities with cars and trains and all of that.  Hell, in Sonic Adventure 2 Battle, Sonic actually MEETS up with the fucking President.  Then you go to racing sections and there's flying islands in tornadoes with random rocket placements and bumpers.  Not to mention the fact that, uhh, Sonic's a giant blue hedgehog, and having that kind of realism in a game with such a cartoon-y mascot is jarring and weird.  Mario, on the other hand, has an entirely fantasy world.  Nothing in the Mario world follows real-life logic, because the developers know it's a cartoon-y video game.  The NPCs in Mario games are never realistic looking humans for a very good reason.  And because of that, when Mario is doing things like propelling in the air or riding a dinosaur we don't question it, because it fits with the general theme of the game."

Boom is terrible. DX just, well, isn't good. I liked the Casino Nights level a lot, the final fight was really cool, the overworld can use some work but other than that it isn't the worst game in the world and definitely isn't the worst 3D sonic game. The controls are janky and a lot of levels expect you to hold forward and discourage exploration but it was a decent game for its time. If you go out of your way to ignore the onscreen prompts and insist on glitching out the game then it's a cakewalk to make it out to be some kind of unfinished beta game that slipped through the cracks but if you play it normally its nowhere as bad as Boom or 06."

And yes, the controls are jank, no argument there.  But the goddamn Tikal hint light tells you exactly how to handle the wind path sections, not that I ever expect Arin to read those things.  Edit: I'm actually mostly referring to Arin trying to go backwards every time he lands in a new section instead of simply moving forward, just as the rings direct him to."

gamegrumps,3e3a51,Probe_Droid,15,Tue Jul 21 18:00:14 2015 UTC,"I know people like to say that Arin is intentionally trying to break the game and that's why it looks like shit, but as someone who likes the game and had it as a kid, no, there's a bunch of stupid glitchy bullshit all over this game. As he was running through this level I was remembering all the broken parts I found.  Like yes, Arin doesn't like Sonic in the first place so he already is predisposed to not like Sonic Adventure, but Sonic Adventure is still a giant ugly glitchy mess.  The perfect example is the part where he has to run on the wind. It's completely stupid that if he jumps at all on that section, it breaks it. You have to literally just hold forward until you're out of it, and that is completely counter to how that section feels. Eventually he figured it out but the way they designed those sections they may as well have just kept the player from being able to control it while he's in those"
gamegrumps,3e3a51,Macaluso100,5,Tue Jul 21 17:24:28 2015 UTC,"I purchased and played Sonic Adventure on the Dreamcast back in 2000, and while it is a bit of a janky mess, as long as you're playing the game properly you're typically fine.  However, Arin seems intent on trying to jump towards weird parts of the stage and explore areas off the beaten path for no real reason other than attempting to make ""funny stuff"" happen."
gamegrumps,3e3a51,nolaredditor,2,Tue Jul 21 17:28:55 2015 UTC,"The thing is Arin's playstyle with video games is ""explore and find secrets"", which doesn't gel with with more modern Sonic games which don't really want you to do that."

gamegrumps,3e3a51,Probe_Droid,7,Tue Jul 21 18:29:36 2015 UTC,"I don't like to go around accusing people of shit, but Arin figured out the Wind Key suspiciously fast.

LOOK, I'M JUST SAYING, OKAY?"
gamegrumps,3e3a51,MWPlay,4,Tue Jul 21 17:54:34 2015 UTC,"You know, that's a good point that I thought of as well when I was watching the episode but forgot to mention.

Now granted, Sonic Adventure isn't exactly the best-programmed game, it's finicky and buggy as all hell, but the ""Wind bridge"" is proof that Arin is intentionally looking for glitches or bugs to exploit.  The Navi Fairy IMMEDIATELY BEFORE tells him to keep holding forward to cross.  Also if Arin already knows the story beforehand (knowing that Chaos gets all Emeralds) he has to have played this game before and made it past this point. So out of memory alone, he knows how to get past that part.  Now, I don't blame him to playing up the game's bugginess for laughs on the audience and Dan's part, but that's not fair to intentionally look for bugs and then shit on the game.  If that was genuine he would have been either way more pissed off or surprised.  Again, not trying to defend an already shitty game, but that's a low-blow to intentionally trigger glitches that weren't meant to happen under normal playing circumstances and then shit all over the game.  That's like throwing a brand new computer into a tub and then complaing that it doesn't work afterward. Low blow, Arin."

This was the biggest criticism of their play through of Shadow the Hedgehog. It's like ""Guys, there's plenty of legitimate stuff to poke fun at (like the president's photo), you don't need to aggressively hunt for material, it just comes off as bullying."" And I say that as someone who bought and played shadow the hedgehog back when it came out and was astounded how bad it was."

gamegrumps,3e3a51,SoG650,2,Tue Jul 21 17:44:18 2015 UTC,"Like most Sonic games, they're mainly made for speedrunning. You try and beat the levels as fast as possible while also going through the best branching paths to save you the most time. Obviously the earlier levels don't have very many branches, but that's to adjust the player to its fast-paced playstyle, even if most of it is on rails. It's made to be linear, not adventurous. That's why no competent players can get lost."

This play through is rough mostly because getting through these levels is a matter of muscle memory from playing this game as a kid. Fucking dammit. I also feel like because its a Sonic game they have to play to make it seem like shit. It has problems, but this game is not so much broken as Arin is kind of bad. It's a little broken, but like I said, I feel like thee's some willful doofery."
gamegrumps,3e3a51,TheColorsDo,3,Tue Jul 21 18:12:14 2015 UTC,"To the people who seem convinced that Arin is purposefully trying to break the game (like with the wind bridge segment), I can promise you; he isn't. I've played Adventure on the Dreamcast and on the GC, and both times I played it, I messed up that wind bridge section a few times. Even though the Navi thing tells you to keep pushing forward, I remember jumping out of it more than once because, frankly, I didn't want to stop moving in a sonic game to read what the little shit was saying. The shitty game design actually shows even more through Arin's messing up of this section because it shows that the developers knew that pressing the jump button would shoot you out of the wind bridge. Rather than doing some programming to fix it, they explained through an in-game tutorial how to avoid this bug, probably because they considered the threat of killing yourself one which added difficulty to the game. What that did was make the difficulty in Sonic based on your ability to stop moving, read a tutorial, and learn to hold up instead of press jump. I messed up this section both times I played through the game because who the fuck wants to stop moving and listen to what Navi says in Zelda? Nobody. In a sonic game, a game ""designed for speed"", the number of players with an urge to do this should be even smaller."
gamegrumps,3e3a51,Doctor-Bagels,2,Tue Jul 21 18:10:35 2015 UTC,"I would never say this game is good. Ever. But come on Arin, its not that hard to just go..."
gamegrumps,3e3a51,Spaghettilee,2,Tue Jul 21 18:03:20 2015 UTC,"Why is everybody pretending Arin cares about exploring? As far as I can recall, in every game they've played that involved exploring he either told Danny exactly where to go step-by-step, or made them use a walkthrough step-by-step to get through it as quickly as possible. If a game was too non-linear and he didn't know exactly where to go, he'd drop the series."

They've all had some sort of event, or thing they did/didn't do that I can think that brought hate.  Even Danny I can't see getting much hate nowadays. When he joined sure. Kevin gets it from not being Barry-Quality editor, Arin gets it whenever he plays games badly on the show. Ross gets it for being unfunny or his humor not clicking (I love Ross ).

I think he is a stand up guy, and he brings a fresh perspective to the group when he is there, it just doesn't click with me.  More recently though, Barry was right in the middle of the pay to watch Table Flip thing. I think it was handled well, but that is the only drama I can think of him being.

Literally every participating member of Game Grumps, Steam Train, and Grumpcade (excluding ""guestcade"" guests) just heard him say that. With that in mind, maybe they'll ask him to do more stuff in future episodes.  On the other hand, I'm sure they talk to him daily, so they would certainly already know what his workload is like. I doubt him telling us about his workload has no impact on any of the other grumps when it comes to how much work they think they should give him.  But...

Basically Sega fucked up something fierce when porting it from the dreamcast to the Gamecube. It has aged poorly, the cutscenes are a riot, and the story makes no sense. The controls feel wonky at time.  But! They literally picked the worse version of the game to do it. And they keep making the same mistakes that the warn (although in a vague way I'll say) warns them about. Pro tip:: When flowing with the wind, do not jump mid air, as you know that causes you to lose momentum."

Considering how 1998 anime dubbing was, I'm just glad they didn't try to make the english dialogue match the mouth flaps and go full Girlchan in Paradise."
gamegrumps,3dyr7x,Rokusi,57,Mon Jul 20 18:25:44 2015 UTC,"It's not lip synced for any language. If you look at it long enough, you'll see that the mouth animation just loops after a second or two."

Games barely had voice overs to begin with. It was a welcome change from what I was used to at the time. Arin could afford to be a bit more forgiving. I'd bet Danny would find a lot more enjoyment from the game if he tried playing it with someone a little less judgmental.
gamegrumps,3dyr7x,happiest_tree_friend,8,Mon Jul 20 18:55:29 2015 UTC,"I was a Sonic fan as a kid, and downloaded Sonic Adventure for free, and it's not worth what I paid. It really sucks. Dan is old enough to have his own opinion."

gamegrumps,3dyr7x,JailbaitRarity,4,Mon Jul 20 20:00:34 2015 UTC,That's basically the response to most of the beloved games that Arin shits on. If Danny played them with other he would probably like them more.

gamegrumps,3dyr7x,cianmc,27,Tue Jul 21 09:23:21 2015 UTC,This game is going to take forever and I'm perfectly fine with that.
gamegrumps,3dyr7x,rpm11257,89,Mon Jul 20 17:15:49 2015 UTC,"Okay, so I, a Sonic first-timer, decided to play this game side by side with the Grumps using the XBLA version, and I got up to the second Sonic stage. Honestly, the game is fine, but I feel like it is dragged down by its connecting parts and bosses. I think during this game's development, the need to portray a cool story for Sonic took precedence over convenience and fun game design.   I will admit though, I love the Chao garden. I named one of them Buttpop. I have no idea to take care of her, though."
gamegrumps,3dyr7x,GreatPhail,38,Mon Jul 20 17:07:26 2015 UTC,"I really hope they fuck around in the Chao Garden, because the GameCube version is the best one to do it on. Once (if) they beat this game, they can bring a Chao to Sonic Advance (which they don't have to play, just to transfer) and then bring it to Sonic Adventure 2 if they ever play it. That way they can torment their Chao across two playthroughs  But thank God they aren't playing the Dreamcast version if they're going to play with the Chao. They are a glitchy, annoying mess. They'll just stand up and sit down repeatedly and they make screeching noises if you trying to give them stuff when they're in the water, on top of other things"
gamegrumps,3dyr7x,TripleXero,9,Mon Jul 20 17:15:15 2015 UTC,"They don't even need sonic advance, just a gameboy with no game in it works. It will create a tiny chao world that lasts until the gameboy is turned off."
gamegrumps,3dyr7x,shabraca,4,Mon Jul 20 19:00:05 2015 UTC,"Always forget about that. But if they have Sonic Advance, they'd be better off using it because without it I think it duplicates the Chao and has some issues transferring back to the original game. I guess they wouldn't really have any reason to do that though"
gamegrumps,3dyr7x,TripleXero,6,Mon Jul 20 19:30:27 2015 UTC,"Oh, the dreamcast Chao garden was the best though.  The pet/pickup button was the same as the attack button.   Going in for cuddles?  Nope, kicking the baby.  It upset me so much."
gamegrumps,3dyr7x,PersonalSycophant,12,Mon Jul 20 19:26:07 2015 UTC,"That's actually sort of funny, as the big supporters of this game cite the hub world as one of the best parts of the game. I personally find it okay, but nothing to boast about."
gamegrumps,3dyr7x,Sigma-Alpha_2,5,Mon Jul 20 17:27:46 2015 UTC,That's really strange. I saw nothing that wow'd me in the game hubs. The only notable part of it so far which also annoyed me was the whole wind key segment.
gamegrumps,3dyr7x,GreatPhail,24,Mon Jul 20 17:31:52 2015 UTC,"Do note that this game came out in 1998, and while hub worlds certainly weren't new, this one was pretty cool looking in the context of other games around at the same time. This was before stuff like GTA3 and such. If you were playing the game for the first time today, the hub world would probably seem quaint."
gamegrumps,3dyr7x,sstarkm,8,Mon Jul 20 17:42:10 2015 UTC,"This. I got this game in 1999 when I was 7, and it was the biggest open-world area of any 3D game I had played. It gave me a sense of wonder and drove me to explore every nook and cranny. It basically blew my little child mind and I fell in love.  And now I get to watch Arin and Danny tear this game a new one."
gamegrumps,3dyr7x,War-Cry,6,Mon Jul 20 22:23:51 2015 UTC,"I remember thinking Mystic Ruins was a LOT bigger than it actually was. That game may kinda suck but I still play it every year out of nostalgia. I generally think it's an okay game though, bugs aside."

gamegrumps,3dyr7x,skyman724,3,Mon Jul 20 19:57:56 2015 UTC,It's no use.
gamegrumps,3dyr7x,Shardwing,2,Mon Jul 20 21:28:19 2015 UTC,"I have tons of fond memories of this game and I have never in my life even TOLERATED the hub worlds. They're 100% trash through and through IMO, the way they tie the story together is okay but they're certainly a mess to navigate or move in. Fuuuuck the ruins jungle.  Then, I didn't play this until the Gamecube release, though."
gamegrumps,3dyr7x,enragedmanatee,6,Mon Jul 20 19:45:30 2015 UTC,"That's kind of a fun idea. It looks...really bad as Arin's playing, but I have the PC version already due to Steam sales, may as well use it as a chance to try out the game and see what it's like."
gamegrumps,3dyr7x,seburoh,12,Mon Jul 20 22:53:53 2015 UTC,"Tried catching up to where they're at, what I've noticed on the PC version:   That spot arin fell through the wall is SUPER janky and just a nightmare to control. The collision detection is terrible there, on the straight-away going down it's actually closer in than the walls are, and as you get to the turn it widens out, eventually getting behind the walls are, and I guess there's no floor below them, which is how Arin slipped through the world. Even when trying to go fast, it's just not great. Not being able to control the camera much is weird, so far the auto-camera been good, but sluggish. Good enough angles so I can see what's next, but is not always moving to it's next position as quickly as it should. For something from the late 90's it certainly could be worse. Setpiece bits are inconsistent, which is part of why that specific spot was super janky. In setpiece moments like that it's important to have consistency in control. Is the player controlling that timeframe, do they need to be pressing forward? Do they need to be controlling the turn? This is very important to keep the same from setpiece to setpiece, so that players know what to expect when they reach the next one. This game is terrible at that. Some are DDA (I put down my controller for the Whale bit, and just watched), some require input. Of the first two loops in the game, one requires input, and one doesn't. It's just incredibly unclear to the player, and that's terrible design. This could have been easily fixed by considering what tools should be used to convey different kinds of setpiece events as well. Bounce pads = DDA, Number Pads = Control, are a good example of this done right, but speed pads are used in both kinds of scenarios. Controls relative to camera position are wonky. In places where the camera wants you to see how awesome you are, pressing forward is still forward, but in turns and places where the camera is moving for other reasons, you have to manually adjust. Needing to second-guess why the camera is moving is not something a player should be doing. Again this leads back to consistency. Ring...pod things, sometimes break when walked up to, sometimes don't, which is odd. Guess it's a bug in some way, doesn't seem to be tied to momentum unless that's the part that's bugged."
gamegrumps,3dyr7x,seburoh,7,Mon Jul 20 23:37:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the PC version is a lot less buggy than the Gamecube version"
gamegrumps,3dyr7x,Neosaurus_,3,Mon Jul 20 17:21:26 2015 UTC,"I would expect the PC version to be similar to the XBLA version, and I still had that first ""falling through the ground"" glitch on XBLA."

Sonic Boom wasn't fun, at all. Even though DX is buggy as all hell, it's still fun to run around as Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles."

gamegrumps,3dyr7x,GreatJaerb,72,Mon Jul 20 17:12:11 2015 UTC,"Aside from the tutorial he died on, where did he suck? Most of the Sonic section is jumping and holding forward on the control stick.  Edit: a word"
gamegrumps,3dyr7x,ListentoGhostface,23,Mon Jul 20 17:48:35 2015 UTC,He sucks at holding forward on the control stick.
gamegrumps,3dyr7x,ScottTheCanadianDick,2,Mon Jul 20 22:47:59 2015 UTC,Sorta like a platformer? Oh wait.
gamegrumps,3dyr7x,PapaNickWrong,13,Mon Jul 20 18:35:52 2015 UTC,"I'm not contesting the game isn't a platformer (except for the part where it's Sega Bass Fishing featuring Big the Cat), I'm just saying playing as Sonic is a pretty mindless experience. The game takes control away from you a lot, and not gracefully. It's easy to, idk, tilt the control stick the wrong way and end up underneath the stage."
gamegrumps,3dyr7x,ListentoGhostface,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:59:29 2015 UTC,"The whole point is to get the fastest time, those sections where the game takes control away from you are supposed to be breaks in the action so you don't have to be focused the whole time. Also you're supposed to avoid them as much as possible (and it IS possible)."
gamegrumps,3dyr7x,Lurking4Answers,-4,Tue Jul 21 05:04:05 2015 UTC,"He constantly tried to slow down at the fast parts, which made him die like 3 times"

gamegrumps,3dyr7x,dragnerz,4,Mon Jul 20 20:08:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the primary reason Arin gets these glitches nobody else gets is just because he deliberately tries to throw himself off the rails whenever possible, either to make a point or just because he hates being on rails.  To be fair, being on rails kinda sucks. The 3D games especially used them way too much. But still, he refuses to follow the game's own logic so they're gonna be locked in a sort of combat for a long time."
gamegrumps,3dyr7x,enragedmanatee,15,Mon Jul 20 19:48:43 2015 UTC,"If the game lets you do that, then it should work.  If they didn't want you to go off the rails, they shouldn't have let you go off the rails."
gamegrumps,3dyr7x,DigitalCannon,3,Mon Jul 20 20:51:12 2015 UTC,Yeah but the sections that are on rails don't last very long excluding the whale part.
gamegrumps,3dyr7x,bluejaygo,42,Mon Jul 20 20:38:12 2015 UTC,"I can understand Dan, but seriously this game is  almost 17 years old. Sonic Boom, in theory, SHOULD be better than this game. Sonic Adventure can get a drivers license at this point and is old enough to quit school, get a low paying job, and struggle as an artist GET OFF IT'S BACK, DAD."
gamegrumps,3dyr7x,DrunkPlatypusGames,10,Mon Jul 20 17:54:27 2015 UTC,"Dan's obviously not thinking about the sequence in which these games were produced, so I give him a bit of a break when he says that.  You are exactly right, though.  Sonic Boom is a game from last year that's two generations more recent than this yet is buggier and only looks incrementally better.  It has to take the cake for worst based on that.  Another thing to consider is that the horrible glitches in Sonic Boom, in particular the Knuckles jump, actually made their playthrough much more fun.  Maybe Danny's got more rose-colored glasses for that game than he expects he'll have for this one.  This one does look to be a terrible game from the outset, regardless of it being a first try.  We should really just direct our ire towards Sega in general for shitting out so many clones of this game even to this day."
gamegrumps,3dyr7x,SerialTimeKiller,11,Mon Jul 20 18:55:31 2015 UTC,"I disagree a bit about it being terrible from the outset. In 1998, pre-dating the PS2 and coming out at the same time as Crash Bandicoot 3 and the original Baldur's Gate, it was pretty damn impressive. This port - the Gamecube port - is notoriously poor and suffers from massive framerate issues and poorer collision detection than the original. Though they did improve the Chao Garden and added some new mission mode levels.  That said, it definitely has not aged well and the adventure fields are just painful. It's only sometimes clear on where to go. And Big the Cat."
gamegrumps,3dyr7x,DrunkPlatypusGames,15,Mon Jul 20 19:35:51 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't read too much into it. Dan is just sitting and watching in both cases, so I imagine all he cares about is visuals. While both are full of bugs, boom is pretty to look at. Its not like dan is commenting on how the game controls, he is just noting lots of visual bugs in a game that already looks like ass"
gamegrumps,3dyr7x,Dantes_Inferno1,8,Mon Jul 20 17:37:39 2015 UTC,Also we have to remember that for the time it was released this game was technologically advanced.
gamegrumps,3dyr7x,Macrat,35,Mon Jul 20 17:43:43 2015 UTC,"Saying Sonic Boom is better than Sonic Adventure is like saying getting punched in the face is better than getting kicked in the nuts, to be fair."
gamegrumps,3dyr7x,nolaredditor,12,Mon Jul 20 17:16:33 2015 UTC,I know. This game hasn't aged well but it has its moments. I might drop this series if all of it is going to be them shitting on the game which was funny the first 457 times.
gamegrumps,3dyr7x,GreatJaerb,19,Mon Jul 20 17:09:58 2015 UTC,"I agree. It doesn't help that they're playing arguably the worst version of the game either (more noticeable framerate issues [later releases of DX had far less than the GameCube version], missing textures, uglier character models with way too much shine [in my opinion]).  It has aged very poorly, but it's definitely the Sonic game I most want remade. Behind the poor delivery is an interesting plot that adds to S3K. The level design sticks the closest to the original formula of branching pathways and speed reward (for Sonic at least) of this era of 3D Sonic games. The aestectics are far more varied and interesting than Sonic Adventure 2, in my opinion. There's so much going for it that's worthy of redoing and streamlining in this game, but this a channel that mainly has people who hate the idea of Sonic being legitimately fun, and rather he just be a meme. The franchise had done a lot of that to itself, but that doesn't mean there isn't anything to enjoy from the games."
gamegrumps,3dyr7x,ThatsGooodJason,3,Mon Jul 20 17:29:12 2015 UTC,They did it TWICE.  One during the end slate for episode 1 and one during this episode.
gamegrumps,3dyr7x,jado1stk,11,Mon Jul 20 21:14:40 2015 UTC,"Eh, I had enough fun with Boom. If you look beyond the framerate and bugs in Boom, there is a pretty serviceable bralwer/platformer beneath all the shit. By no means is the game good, not even close, but it's playable. When I tried to play DX, I couldn't get over how floaty/twitchy all the characters controlled. DX is buggy and mechanically unfun. Boom is buggy and mechanically generic. I, personally, give the edge to Boom."
gamegrumps,3dyr7x,SF218,7,Mon Jul 20 17:12:27 2015 UTC,"Boom also had really fun art direction. The implementation of said art wasn't great, but the world designs were fun. Sonic Adventure, looking past the outdated graphics and hilariously bad facial animation, is just bland, a problem I think a lot of 3D Sonics had. Boom took the Sonic style and made it 3D. Most other 3D sonic games just threw Sonic into the ""real world"" and stuck some bumpers in it."
gamegrumps,3dyr7x,TheNittles,7,Mon Jul 20 17:49:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, what the fuck's up with that? The first few Sonic game took place in polygon-tree-checkerboard land with the robot monkeys and ladybugs. How come the 3D sonic games got rid of all that for the most part, putting sonic in the real world, and Soleana and realistic-ish mechs and shit? Sonic Heroes was a little closer to the original, but that's the only example of early 2000's sonic doing that."
gamegrumps,3dyr7x,Probe_Droid,30,Mon Jul 20 20:32:08 2015 UTC,I'm really enjoying the show so far.  This hate in the comments is disappointing.  I think I'll stay out of these threads for a while.
gamegrumps,3dyr7x,250lespaul,14,Mon Jul 20 18:02:37 2015 UTC,This hate in the comments is disappointing.   All the people who think this game is good are thinking the same thing about the show.

gamegrumps,3dyr7x,cmdood,22,Mon Jul 20 21:39:57 2015 UTC,"I may be all for Sonic and supporting him, but I'm not going to deny anything here: this game has aged horribly. All the same, it does kinda feel like they're ignoring the context of the game being released in 1998, where you'd have to consider all of the things that are actually going on in this game being pretty ballsy experiments and attempts for its time. For all its worth, I think this game is defended because it still did good things and laid a kind of groundwork for some of the later, better titles, even if the game itself also laid the groundwork for some of the recurring flaws of the later, worse titles all the same.  Still, among other things, Arin not just using a spindash in that one segment to go up the wall and instead walking aaaaalll the way back over and over kind of concerns me. A lot of Arin's bad habits seem to make some games look a lot worse than they are."
gamegrumps,3dyr7x,Hydroxianchaos,11,Mon Jul 20 21:24:11 2015 UTC,I also defend it because it's fun.
gamegrumps,3dyr7x,PRDX4,3,Tue Jul 21 00:31:52 2015 UTC,"I wish I could say 'that goes without saying', but people really sometimes make me feel like I somehow have the worst taste for enjoying this game. It's glitchy and buggy, sure, but ultimately bearable at worst and I still have tons of fun with it, so I'll gladly defend it while acknowledging its obvious faults."
gamegrumps,3dyr7x,Hydroxianchaos,33,Tue Jul 21 02:35:18 2015 UTC,"Is DX a buggier version of this game? Or have I just never ran into these issues throughout the years of playing this on Dreamcast? I must've went through that part where Arin fell through the stage a hundred times and that never happened.   But regardless, despite its problems this game is fun and unique. Good design, terrible execution. If any of you wanna see a let's play a group that understands that, watch the ""Best Friends Play..."" Of this on TheSw1tcher."
gamegrumps,3dyr7x,Eyedoless,29,Mon Jul 20 17:18:53 2015 UTC,GCN port is buggier and also doesn't fix many of the bugs of the Dreamcast version. Although I have to say that scripted loop-de-loops and automated sequences are pretty easy to glitch out in all versions of the game. You just stop in the middle of them or roll in a wrong place and BAM - you're dead.

But gosh damn, I didn't get any of these bugs and glitches when I played the game, and I've played pretty much every damn version (Dreamcast, GC, 360, PS3). And it's not helped by the honest factor that ...<<...>>....Arin isn't very good at the game anyway. Dude died against chaos 0. There's not glitch, bug, or frame rate issue to blame on getting put on blast by the first boss. Again, the game isn't all that good, but neither is Arin or his copy of the game (possibly), because none of the glitches he's show in episode 1 or his clip from Sequalitis have ever happened to me. I've even tried to recreate them. Nothing. And it seems many others haven't ran into these problems either. And while Danny can have his own opinion, it's a shame that even moments that are Arin bad playing will most likely be attributed to the game being bad. I have no problem with people thinking the game is bad....buuut I hate false examples contributing to it. Fuck, he should've let Dan play now that I think about it. Dan would get wrecked, sure, but we already know Arin hates Sonic."

gamegrumps,3dyr7x,SionGWN,17,Mon Jul 20 17:38:09 2015 UTC,"Watching this so far I think I might be getting why Arin doesn't like Sonic games. Like during the Sonic sections it seems that the only thing you do is hold up on the stick. When Arin pressed any other direction the game freaked out a little bit. And I can see the argument being made that that's not a game, that's hold a button and watch a scene."

gamegrumps,3dyr7x,thunderboyac,70,Tue Jul 21 00:00:30 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry, but coming from somebody who had never played this as a child, I don't see how this game could possibly be fun without nostalgia pushing the entirety of the experience. Super Mario 64 didn't age well, but at least the controls were tight and it wasn't a buggy mess.  I mean, I hate to yuck anybody's yum by saying that, but I'm finding it really hard to see how anybody can think that this game is fun on anything other than nostalgia. Good for you if you can find the fun in it, regardless, and I actually kind of envy you, but jesus fuck."
gamegrumps,3dyr7x,Jishkah,25,Mon Jul 20 17:38:25 2015 UTC,"I don't think Mario 64's controls were ""tight"" ... Mario had a penchant for slipping around all the time and some other issues. But that's a whole other discussion that happened a million times on the Mario 64 posts. :)  Sonic Adventure however... I grew up with and loved Sonic in his rise to fame back during the Nintendo v. Sega pissing contest of the early 90s. I've never liked Sonic Adventure for multiple reasons, and even back then the all-too-easily triggered world detection bugs were embarrassing to the already embattled and floundering Sega. A lot of people praise this game, a lot of people had this as their first Sonic game, but I'm pretty sure this is when Sonic began his decline.   Adventure isn't an overall total loss, but it definitely signaled a time when it seemed to me that Sega no longer knew how to handle their own mascot character. I think they felt the need to retire the old Nature v. Man sub-context and change it to a much more generic Hero v. Villain thing. We also begin to move away with it's-Eggman-stop-calling-him-Robotnik-you-god-damn-English-speakers being the de facto villain and making him progressively more useless as more games were made. The fun fantasy world was replaced with the oddly-realistic world. (This has sort of toggled back and forth in some kind of deathmatch since.) This of course culminated in '06 with the realistic settings and even more disturbingly realistic humans. I'll give Boom credit that it at least made the NPCs look like they actually belong in the same world!"
gamegrumps,3dyr7x,CaptainSouthbird,15,Mon Jul 20 18:12:19 2015 UTC,"ProJared did a review of Sonic Adventure 2 a month or two back and I think he nailed it--people remember the game because of the Chao Garden.  They wanted to upgrade the chao, so they only replayed the levels they actually liked.  The bad levels were more or less forgotten."
gamegrumps,3dyr7x,IronOxide42,14,Mon Jul 20 20:12:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I saw that review, and I think he's definitely on the right track, or even possibly hammer on the nail.   The bad levels were more or less forgotten.   This is pretty common practice for any ""overall awesome"" game, because just about every game has some bitch of a level that everyone wants to forget, but the overall experience is positive. (I love Mario Galaxy, but Luigi's Purple Coins is a disaster for me, yet I'll forgive it that transgression.) The problem is, Sonic Adventure and kin seem to get hefty rose-colored glasses equipped with blinders for some reason. There's a lot of games I'll stick up for, even when nostalgia is a push factor, but Adventure is just not one of them."
gamegrumps,3dyr7x,CaptainSouthbird,6,Mon Jul 20 20:30:11 2015 UTC,"The only version I've played of Mario 64 is the DS one, so it might be harder to control, but I can't get Mario to stop moving worth a damn. It took me forever to beat the mission where you climb to the top of the spiraling tower"
gamegrumps,3dyr7x,TripleXero,12,Mon Jul 20 17:48:26 2015 UTC,"Sonic, Tails, Knuckles and Gamma stages are still pretty fun to play, despite all the glitches and issues, they really have something enjoyable in them. People wouldn't still be nostalgic about them, if they were complete shit without any enjoyment.  It is fun to go up and down and all around and try to do all of it fast. So fun, you can even tolerate the crappy sections.  Of course, there are better Sonic games out there. But still, remember, this originally was a 1998 Dreamcast launch title from a series that didn't have a big game since Sega Genesis days. It was very revolutionary for the time, nobody had done what Sonic did back then — all the cool set pieces and going fast and stuff.  Tl;dr Yeah, this game is janky as hell. But it's very unique and loveable and that's why people still feel nostalgic about it, despite having to put up with Big the Cat."
gamegrumps,3dyr7x,EpicRive,4,Mon Jul 20 18:09:33 2015 UTC,"I actually really, really like the Amy stages too. Having to spend the entire level in a panic run away from something you can't kill is fucking horror movie status anxiety, and it makes for an incredibly interesting level mechanic."
gamegrumps,3dyr7x,RogueA,42,Mon Jul 20 21:54:14 2015 UTC,The controls in Mario 64 were tight? Excuse me? How many times did Arin die in that game because he was slip-sliding everywhere EXCEPT the places he wanted to go?
gamegrumps,3dyr7x,MWPlay,18,Mon Jul 20 17:44:41 2015 UTC,"Here's a death reel of the SM64 playthrough  Really most of the deaths are 1) Arin making poor choices 2) the camera positioning itself in a way that doesn't give Arin useful depth perception or 3) sadistic level design.  Mario's controls themselves are actually really good and make for some really good platforming. The slip-sliding deaths you're referring to seems to be the decisions to put slopes next to death pits in practically every level which is really level design and not controls.  I wouldn't really argue that Arin is playing shitty, but more that Arin doesn't give a shit. For instance he dies from over shooting long jumps quite a bit, but the game gives Mario a very high level of in-air control over long jumps that Arin doesn't utilize."
gamegrumps,3dyr7x,lostsemicolon,9,Mon Jul 20 21:09:47 2015 UTC,"I played this game a few years ago (plenty of time to let the nostalgia wear off after playing it as a kid) and honestly... I have no idea how Arin is encountering these issues. I never clipped through the world, I never had these weird camera issues (until the final Sonic stage, at least, but that level sucks). I guess Arin just has the magic touch. Maybe the Tester chose the wrong person to vote off after all!  As for finding enjoyment out of the game... the Sonic and Tails stages are fun and the game gives you a decent sense of speed. Knuckle's stages are hit and miss for some people, but I like treasure hunting games so I like them. E-102's stages are fine, though they're nothing great. There are setpieces like the Orca that have you automatically running through certain areas but stuff like that isn't all that different from contemporary works like Final Fantasy VII having overly-long Summon animations or FMV sequences. It's late-90s ""wow"" factor that was meant to sell the hardware. That was the big deal back then, just like how graphics are pushed today. It certainly doesn't excuse what Sonic is doing, but the instances of this happening are pretty few and far between and they only really happen during the Sonic segments.   I still hold that if the bugs and all that were ironed out, (and if Big's and Amy's stages were taken out completely), SA1 would be a pretty solid game. Comparisons between this and Sonic 06 or Sonic Boom miss the mark because unlike Sonic 06 or Sonic Boom, beyond all the bugs honestly lies a pretty fun game. Sonic 06 and Sonic Boom would still be shitty, boring games even if they were completely bugless."
gamegrumps,3dyr7x,VashTrigun78,5,Mon Jul 20 19:13:41 2015 UTC,"Two things about this game:  One, the game is not quite as buggy as it appears. All you have to do during the cutscene-esque running sequences is hold up and you go through just fine. Yeah if you don't do that then shit breaks but that's why they made it easy.  Two, the game was good/noteworthy for its context. Obviously if the exact game was released now it would be trash (like Sonic Boom). But it came out at a time where it just hadn't been done before. It's Sonic at its basics -- you run fast and a bunch of cool shit happens around you. There's a level where you're infiltrating a goddamn airship by going fast. Naturally the game is now way overshadowed by better cinematic experiences like Shadow of the Colossus -- basically, it hasn't aged well -- but for its time it was a cool game."
gamegrumps,3dyr7x,tchutchu,2,Mon Jul 20 20:52:34 2015 UTC,"I've never heard ""yuck anybody's yum"" before but I love that. And as someone who loved both this and SM64 as a kid, I don't think the controls of either game have aged well at all. They're both floaty messes."

gamegrumps,3dyr7x,Probe_Droid,10,Mon Jul 20 20:35:40 2015 UTC,"Arin is not even trying to appreciate anything about it. His bias and unwillingness to at least try to actually have fun with the game are killing the experience. And I'm not saying that out of salt; it doesn't matter how good a game is, if you go into it with enough bias already, you won't have a good time.  This game has a lot of fun parts, and some not-fun parts. The overworlds are bad, but only like 4/10 bad. Not Sonic 06 bad. Sonic's levels are a lot of fun and the game controls very responsively; I have no idea how Arin finds glitches so frequently, as in ~10 years of playing this game I've only ever seen a glitch twice (once when my then-girlfriend did it on her first playthrough, once when I recreated it to try to see what was happening). The level designs are fun and creative, although brief. Tails' levels are just Sonic's levels with some twists, which is repetitive but still enjoyable. Knuckles' levels are hit-or-miss; some are VERY fun, others are bleh. Amy's levels are slow, but I enjoyed her unique mechanics and I felt a looooot of tension (her levels have her being chased). Gamma's levels are a blast (literally), and as for Big that Cat... a completely unnecessary addition to the game. His levels are awful and a drag, no denying it. Chao Garden is an amaaaaaazing side game. The boss battles are (mostly) way too easy to be memorable, except the final boss because the music is soooo awesome. The plot is kinda lame, and the dialogue/cutscenes are TERRIBLE. It's not as good as SM64 by any means, but it was a solid beginning to 3D Sonic games.  Super Mario 64 also has pretty sloppy control. Try playing Sunshine or Galaxy and going back to SM64. You slip and slide everywhere, randomly pivot, stick to walls awkwardly... the list goes on. I've been trying to 100% that game recently."
gamegrumps,3dyr7x,NeoSeth,11,Mon Jul 20 18:10:47 2015 UTC,"Sure, but the game has definitely aged like milk. I'll admit, the part where they're in that little portion of the city, at the end of today's video, definitely had a sort of aesthetic visual charm, but I really do feel as if the controls butcher what could've otherwise been an enjoyable experience. The graphics are fine for the era, the voice acting, the facial animations, all of it... but the controls kind of ruin the game. It's better than Sonic '06, I'll admit, but for a game that relies on momentum-based controls to build up speed, it definitely doesn't feel like momentum.  Anyway, the only problem that I see with Super Mario 64's physics engine is that there's no friction when there should be friction, and too much friction when there should be no friction. Super Mario Sunshine's controls actually feel worse to me than Super Mario 64's controls (almost too snappy), but, overall, I didn't really have any issues with Super Mario 64, as a game. Even still, and that's coming from somebody who first played it six years ago. Sonic Adventures DX, however, has a physics/momentum system that really shouldn't be excused. But, then, most modern Sonic games fall into that hole, as well - an otherwise decent game with a shoddy physics/momentum system."
gamegrumps,3dyr7x,Jishkah,8,Mon Jul 20 18:21:06 2015 UTC,"It has not aged well by any means. This is far from my favorite Sonic game, but it's certainly not garbage. I strongly disagree with how bad Sonic Adventure's physics are. I don't think they're great, but they work pretty well and I would argue the control is the thing about the game that aged the best. I personally think Sonic Adventure 2 perfected the feel of moving as Sonic, so I'm very sad they've never returned to that."
gamegrumps,3dyr7x,NeoSeth,4,Mon Jul 20 18:28:58 2015 UTC,"I've never played Sonic Adventure 2, so I can't say. I've played Sonic Generations, however, and I actually rather enjoy how Modern Sonic controls, in that game. It's not great, but it's not terrible.  If you have Sonic Generations for the PC, you should download the mod that lets you play as Classic Sonic in Modern Sonic levels. IMHO, that's how the controls/momentum should feel, except, perhaps, with a bit of a speed boost to take into account Modern Sonic's faster top speed. For some reason, most Modern Sonic games' controls feel either too ""floaty"" or too snappy, disregarding friction and proper momentum build-up. Sonic Generations' Modern Sonic had the ""floaty"" momentum problem, whereas Sonic '06's Sonic had the ""snappy"" momentum problem."

Not comment on anything bad in the game at all like the shitty lipsyncing and voice-acting and glitches that killed him four times in the first ten minutes of their playthrough? So Dan can have a completely nonbiased experience?  Fuck that. Dan is able to form his own opinions by looking at what's going on at the screen, which is a ton of bullshit in this game's case."
gamegrumps,3dyr7x,eluveitie5799,2,Mon Jul 20 19:46:44 2015 UTC,"I don't get it at all. Dan is not being coaxed into this, he's as enthusiastic about the criticism as Arin is. His reaction is exactly what you would expect from someone who is now seeing this game for the first time. I remember when I bought the Steam version and showed it to my younger brother and cousin as one of my favourite games from when I was younger and they had the same response as Dan.  Also, news flash guys but Dan isn't having some masterpiece ruined on him. This weird little cult game we like is not important or influential. It's not critically acclaimed. It just has a following based on a combination of nostalgia and love for the better 2D Sonic games. It's not like Arin is on the sidelines convincing him that Citizen Kane is a terrible movie. It's more like Arin and Dan watching Boondock Saints and everyone is getting upset because Dan will never appreciate such an important film now that Arin has corrupted his mind."

gamegrumps,3dyr7x,CaptainL95,11,Mon Jul 20 18:27:32 2015 UTC,"I agree. But, the more I see people play the older games (and even in my own replays more recently) the more I'm beginning to see that I just played them as a kid who did not recognize flaws in video games. Sonic games from game one are plagued with some poor design choices and some awkward bugs. That doesn't make them shit, but it does dent the idea that they're good games in a real sense of good. They're fun, but they're falling pretty short of good. They always seem to try to play Nintendo at their game, but always miss that mark.   And I LOVE Sonic games. I really do. But, this is what I've come to see about them."
gamegrumps,3dyr7x,TheColorsDo,5,Mon Jul 20 18:50:41 2015 UTC,"I think the problem is that the Adventure titles, while they do have their flaws, the flaws themselves are not consistent across the series, and I believe that the fact that each game has a certain problem to them is precisely why people are so against the notion that ""Sonic can exist in a 3D environment"". I mean, don't get me wrong, I fucking love the Adventure titles (Adventure 1 through to 06) - Adventure 2 I still hold up as the ""standard"" for 3D Sonic titles past, present and future; it was the game that got me back into the series - but even I'll admit that while I think they're the best out the bunch, they have their blemishes.  Adventure 1 had great level design, but they really only catered to Sonic; the other characters, while they played well (for a game made in 1998 that was a release-title for a brand new piece of hardware), felt more like an afterthought when it came to the stages themselves. Adventure 2 fixed that problem by having each character have their own exclusive levels, allowing them to fully show off their styles of gameplay. Unfortunately, they were also very restrictive and linear unlike Adventure 1 whose levels felt much bigger and part of an overall world. There are a couple exceptions of course - Final Rush is the definitive 3D Sonic level in my opinion. Heroes tried to do the same by having the levels built around different styles of gameplay, but the fact that every team had to go through the same levels and bosses (granted, with minor variations), and add the fact that certain sections required a particular team member, it did bog the game down. Shadow streamlined the whole thing by having just two styles of gameplay (platforming and vehicles, the latter of which wasn't really strewn about as much as folk tend to say), and the levels catered to that. But, in order to complete the game 100%, it required playing the game 10 times, which again, turns some of the levels into a mere chore. 06 I've always defended as an ""OK"" game - it's not the best game out there, but it's far from the worst. Level design for the most part, is alright; so long as you're paying attention to what's going on around you, you can get through the game fine. Hell, I actually had a fair amount of fun playing as Silver (minus the infamous ball puzzle of course). But, like with Adventure 1, the side characters felt arbitrary and the stages didn't accommodate them at all. Add on top of that a bunch of other more glaring issues and it becomes one more apple in the orchard.  As far as ""post-Adventure"" goes (Unleashed, Colours, Generations and Lost World). While I have Generations on my computer (only because it was going cheap in the Steam Summer Sale), I'm still yet to play it, plus I remember being really disappointed with the demo (and yes those are my actual thoughts on it), although I've been told the game gets better after Green Hill. The other three titles, I have close to no interest in playing (and plus I don't have a WiiU so I can't play Lost World to begin with). Rise of Lyric, despite the hate it gets, looks... alright in places, but like with Lost World, I don't have the console to play it on.  tl;dr: bold text up top"

gamegrumps,3dyr7x,ninjarager,2,Tue Jul 21 15:39:38 2015 UTC,"At first i was glad they were playing SA1. But if they're starting to constantly compare it with Sonic Boom and latest improvements in recent videogames in general is gonna go downhill.  Even compared with SA2 back on Dreamcast this game hasn't aged well after two years in the market. Yet aside of that glitchy part in Emerald Beach (Being Gamecube only as far as i know. I played the DC and 360 versions) everything is what you expect of the very first and official attempt of Sonic to 3D (Sonic Jam hubworld was mostly to test the waters. Sonic R wasn't by Sonic Team). And don't forget we're talking about a game first released on Xmas 1998 in Japan.  Arin has played much more obsolete yet popular games and hasn't bashed it as much. Like Link to the Past where on sequelitis complained about getting spoonfed about what to go and do, yet nutted a pair of times in the actual playthrough. When Jirard played S3&K they were having a good time, and very back with Sonic 06 despite the buggy mess it is was a fun ride as long as it lasted.  The point is that i hope Arin doesn't turn all smartass because poorly aged textures, unsync voice acting (Both ENG and JP), and unpolished yet manageable controls. SA1 is not a perfect game, but i don't want the playthrough to be cynical as balls until whenever they stop (Except with Big. I don't hate his stages but i respect the negative feedback)."
gamegrumps,3dyr7x,necroneechan,5,Tue Jul 21 16:59:17 2015 UTC,"They should probably keep in mind that this game came out in 1998 and they keep standing still, which is like begging for a bad experience playing sonic"

Yes, that also has flaws (camera for Eggman/Tails, the emerald mechanics for Knuckles/Rogue), but the glitchy moments are far fewer.  I think more of what I love and remember about SA, the more I've gone into it, is the atmosphere of the game. It's a shitty atmosphere to be sure, but the idea of that beach level, the run down the skyscraper (which I'm sure will break Dan physically and emotionally), the casino level, the hub world music, the idea of the Egg Carrier, and the final boss. Nothing was ever good, but it was built around good ideas that maybe have showed their age too much since."

gamegrumps,3dzpfd,ECHTECHT,9,Mon Jul 20 21:47:22 2015 UTC,"No. You gotta use the motion controls on the remote, but it is HORRENDOUSLY SHIT!! So your turns are really hard to make if you aren't careful enough. Also there are these parts where you had to balance on a ball by standing the remote up, and it's equally as annoying as surfing."
gamegrumps,3dzpfd,MonochromeGuy,2,Mon Jul 20 22:03:35 2015 UTC,"Oh, so more like the Star Ball from Galaxy 2."
gamegrumps,3dzpfd,ECHTECHT,4,Mon Jul 20 22:46:33 2015 UTC,"The star ball began here on SMG. Honestly, it was somewhat better than ray surfing, since the controls actually actually worked. Still annoying, though."
gamegrumps,3dzpfd,TheNittles,2,Mon Jul 20 23:05:02 2015 UTC,"Oh, I only played the second one so I wouldn't have known that, but I absolutely hated the Star Ball. Of course having played the Wii version of Super Monkey Ball, I probably wouldn't have much trouble now"
gamegrumps,3dzpfd,pixario9,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:11:08 2015 UTC,"Worse. Despite using the Wii Remote's IR pointer, the most responsive part of the Remote, the controls barely work."
gamegrumps,3dzpfd,TheNittles,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:05:31 2015 UTC,"It doesn't use the IR pointer, it uses the accellerometer. All the IR pointer does is track a point on the screen, you'd need the accelerometer to track the orientation of the wii remote."
gamegrumps,3dzpfd,pixario9,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:56:38 2015 UTC,"Oh, do you? The pointer on the Wii menu rotates with the remote, and the game asks you to point the remote at the screen, so I just assumed."
gamegrumps,3dzpfd,myohel0,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:18:33 2015 UTC,"The pointer rotates when you rotate the remote. The position of the pointer is determined by the IR sensor, and the rotation of it is determined by the accelerometer.  EDIT: This actually might be entirely incorrect. I don't really know."

I think it's traditionally about giving up what you have in the hope of getting something better or over-extending yourself and giving up easier targets with a view to having more. A perfect example is Game Shows: ""You can take your $50,000 prize now, or risk it all for the show case!"".    In other words, which would you rather have? A confirmed bird in your hand, ready to be cooked for dinner? Or twice as many birds that you haven't yet caught? Sure, there's two of them, but at least you've actually got the one in your hand!    There ya go. If you were wondering and didn't want to ask, wonder no more. :)"

One guy out there is completely devoted to rebuilding Sonic X-Treme the best he can, and whether you think he's wasting his time with a shitty base concept or not (I don't but I can see why some might think that) you have to admire his dedication.   There's also the Unleashed Project which aimed to port all the good parts of Sonic Unleashed into Sonic Generations for people to play on PC, and their port is pretty damn professional looking as if SEGA did the DLC themselves.  There's also a slew of Sonic fangames out there that stand up pretty well to the Genesis titles, like Sonic After the Sequel.   No frills or nonsense, no ""lol look at muh original character"", just people who have a lot of talent and can get shit done.

The HD releases of them both really pointed that out for me. There are parts where the game is fun. Going fast is definitely present in both titles. Just.... Not everywhere else. I understand where Arin is coming from. I'm pretty sure everyone that's played the game has run into a bug or two. At least two.

gamegrumps,3dze2z,DoctorMordor,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:14:46 2015 UTC,"People get mad because they see a game they like being criticized unfairly, and while I don't particularly like Sonic Adventure I can see their reasons. Arin has badmouthed games without really knowing what the fuck he's talking about in the past (Symphony of the Night being the best example).  People getting mad at him not being good at the game are either new to the channel or (kind of, maybe, a little) dumb."

gamegrumps,3dze2z,thederpyguide,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:25:30 2015 UTC,I have not played this game before and seeing what I have seen it honestly looks like a mess every one who is defending it that hard probably has found past memories of it witch isn't bad but you can pretend it's a amazing game and agure that either
gamegrumps,3dze2z,Have_A_Jelly_Baby,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:21:14 2015 UTC,What I don't understand is why people upset about it can't just take the series off.  Enjoy Mario Galaxy and whatever middle video happens that day and do something else with their extra 10 minutes.  I skip almost all of the Kirby games they play because they're simply not interesting to me.  It can be done.
gamegrumps,3dze2z,SomeOtherNeb,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:24:39 2015 UTC,"Seriously, I can't believe that three years into this, people still get mad at Arin for either being bad at games or badmouthing games he doesn't like.  Do they just not watch the show and spontaneously appear to whine whenever someone says something bad about Sonic? Because this show has never claimed to be about competent LPers playing games at the best of their abilities, it's always been about people fucking around while a video game is in the background."

gamegrumps,3dze2z,Big_Green_Piccolo,-4,Tue Jul 21 01:18:04 2015 UTC,"It's not even that bad, but because of Arin's bias, Danny thinks this is Sonic 06 or Sonic Boom without getting to really see for himself yet."
gamegrumps,3dze2z,zedsdeadbby,4,Mon Jul 20 22:01:45 2015 UTC,"It's pretty bad. The glitches in the first episode followed by the shitty voice acting, writing, and music in the next episode show how bad the game is."
gamegrumps,3dze2z,Big_Green_Piccolo,3,Mon Jul 20 23:10:25 2015 UTC,"The voice acting isn't terrible - the lipsync is, and the audio mix is. You gotta remember this game came from the late 90s and the only comparable games at the time were like, crash bandicoot and mario 64. This game was awesome. Those glitches in the first episode were embellished heavily by Arin, I've never hit that ramp glitch that he hit twice in a row. He just wants to go ""oh boy guys, its sonic 06 time. I sure hate sonic games but I play all of them""  Have you even played the game?"
gamegrumps,3dze2z,The_Anal_Catastrophe,3,Mon Jul 20 23:46:17 2015 UTC,"I agree with that.  The lipsync is god awful, but the voice acting isn't that bad.  I thought Deem Bristowrip did a great job respectively.  He made Eggman look like a badass in Adventure 2."
gamegrumps,3dze2z,zedsdeadbby,2,Tue Jul 21 00:29:06 2015 UTC,"Are you saying he purposefully hit a glitch? That's a little farfetched.   Maybe the voice acting isn't bad but the directing is. There's that scene where Sonic just says ""Watch out you're gonna crash! Ahhhh."". That line has no acting behind it. He's saying Ahhhh with no affectation whatsoever. It's so jarringly bad.  I didn't play the game all the way through. I probably rented it though. Not that that really matters. I can see the poor craftsmanship that went into this game."
gamegrumps,3dze2z,Big_Green_Piccolo,-1,Tue Jul 21 06:06:41 2015 UTC,"Maybe the first time he hits that ramp glitch, fine? It's never happened to me but the second time in a row he does it I call shenanigans.  The wallrun room in the first level he just fucks around. ""I gotta get the speed powerup!"""
gamegrumps,3dze2z,zedsdeadbby,2,Tue Jul 21 06:10:15 2015 UTC,"There is no way he can gauge that turn. The camera is going so fast. He can't have possibly been like ""If I hit that glitch again it'll be really funny."" That's nonsense. Just because you haven't hit that glitch before doesn't mean that the glitch isn't there. It's probably the disc he's using. You can't blame him for the glitch happening.  The wall run thing he was definitely fucking around and that wasn't even a glitch that was just weird coding. Sonic's movements looked funny because they didn't code the game very well as they have not done with many 3D Sonic games."
gamegrumps,3dze2z,GrayMagicGamma,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:15:25 2015 UTC,This was around the same time as Shenmue and Conker. It was pretty bad.
gamegrumps,3dze2z,DoomZero755,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:45:39 2015 UTC,"I'm really willing to believe you. To be honest, after watching the episode, I was basically like ""oh my god. This game is so perfectly bad. I hope the glitches continue, this is going to be an amazing series.""  But since then, I've really had my expectations turned around. Like, I genuinely thought this was another Sonic 06, and if I didn't have reddit, I probably would still think that. (Also, I mean, despite everything you CAN say about it, there are things that are just bad which you can't blame on random chance, or Arin's amazing glitch magnet properties.)   So, I'm going to keep my mind open about this. If it turns out to be a glitchy trainwreck, I won't hold it against the game, but I won't lie here. I would be ecstatic if this game fell apart in Arin's hands, because that shit is the most entertaining thing I could hope for."
gamegrumps,3dze2z,Big_Green_Piccolo,3,Tue Jul 21 03:07:43 2015 UTC,"It's not though. At most it's gonna be a bunch of  WHERE DO I GOOOOOOOOOO  I've actually played this game, looks like most of this thread hasn't. It's a good game."

gamegrumps,3dze2z,RiversBromo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:11:07 2015 UTC,"I played this game when it came out and it was...trash   Literally the only difference between the game in 1999 and 2015 is that it was a pretty looking piece of shit in 1999, and now it's not pretty."
gamegrumps,3dze2z,DoctorMordor,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:14:09 2015 UTC,Which is exactly what happens everytime they play a game Arin dislikes on the show. Then Arin's bias influences the fanbase in exactly the same way and posts like this start appearing. Sounds familiar? Mario 64.
gamegrumps,3dze2z,GrayMagicGamma,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:10:26 2015 UTC,"Coming from someone who hates Mario 64 for a number of reasons, even I have to call bullshit on a lot of what Arin brought up in the playthrough. So far he's nailing everything wrong with SA though, no more missing major design flaws like over 90% of his deaths coming from instant kills or the 100 coin star in Tall Tall mountain if you look around the level."

gamegrumps,3e2x6b,BetterPlacesToSleep,2,Tue Jul 21 15:29:31 2015 UTC,"I'm sure Arin still dislikes hint box-esque mechanics, in which you have to find something that tells you where to go (signs in Wind Waker and Super Mario 64, glowing ball in SADX, etc.), but it's nice to see him using them."
gamegrumps,3e2x6b,CountedCrow,2,Tue Jul 21 16:15:05 2015 UTC,Every time someone uses the initialization SADX all I can picture is a forlorn Megaman.

gamegrumps,3e2x6b,RogueNine,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:43:29 2015 UTC,"They called it Navi, but also acknowledged that it reminded him of things that he had ignored in the cutscene (Going to the Mystic Ruins). I'm sure he'll start hating on Tikal soon, or at least the noise the ball makes."
gamegrumps,3e2x6b,Kyoukon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:16:12 2015 UTC,"I'm sure he'll probably instead just completely forget that the ball tells you what to do, and  just be confused ."
gamegrumps,3e2x6b,necroneechan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:22:29 2015 UTC,Arin dislikes when the game shoves you tips and tutorials. Not a prop in the game you can boop to get advice.
gamegrumps,3e2x6b,xnamkcor,0,Tue Jul 21 17:01:18 2015 UTC,They said it was Navi several times.
gamegrumps,3e2x6b,xnamkcor,2,Tue Jul 21 16:12:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but that's not an insult. It is similar to Navi in design,  so I didn't have a problem with that."
gamegrumps,3e2x6b,HillbillyMan,-1,Tue Jul 21 16:20:30 2015 UTC,It wasn't a question of whether you had a problem with it. You said he didn't insult it. Calling it Navi is insulting it.
