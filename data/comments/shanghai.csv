shanghai,3e5mev,rufustank,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:37:05 2015 UTC,"And by the way, till now, it's still dangerous for foreigners to travel near the boarder with North Korea, as their intelligence agents can snatch people out of the China, like those 2 American journalists ""arrested"" in North Korea and brought back by Carter, they were believed to be in China during the time of abduction."
shanghai,3e5mev,rufustank,3,Wed Jul 22 06:31:54 2015 UTC,"I'd be careful of any scare-mongering here. If you look carefully at the 2 American ladies that were ""arrested"" a number of years ago, the story was nothing like what you are implying.  It was in the dead of winter, the river at border town of Dandong was frozen solid. They went out onto the ice to take pictures and the NK soldiers went out to chase them. Even though they got back to the China shore, the NK soldiers dragged them into NK.   Moral of this story: Don't go out onto the ice.  However, thousands of foreigners visit Dandong at the North Korean border every year and we haven't had any incidents like this in a long time."
shanghai,3e5mev,stockpilethomas1921,1 point,Wed Jul 22 06:39:42 2015 UTC,"Dandong is another case, not like those boarder towns and villages up on Tumen river. For those towns, even the locals are scared and many fled, because there are armed DPRK soldiers crossing the boarder."

A lot of Chinese studying abroad have this desire of being ""intellects"", but once they obtain their masters that broad desire of intellect narrows down to a basic desire for money, albeit no passion. They're still absorbing information from their travels and social interactions, but most unconsciously doing so as a competition. The 30's and mid-30's generation is absent of this, and evident that most are just concerned with money. Current Chinese millennials (20-28) that were able to travel outside of China for studies exhibit this behavior like a sponge -- not for quality, but quantity. In a long run, many of them want to salsa dance, hang out with their junior high school girlfriends in New York, or some country in Europe, the annual trip to Europe, and so. It's just like bragging rights, so money correlates to buying you knowledge, and not necessarily making the most out of it.   Basic bitches in other words.

shanghai,3dx347,bshwartz,2,Mon Jul 20 10:46:59 2015 UTC,"Sorry to hear about your troubles OP... Sucks that they left you out to dry like this.  My guess is that you cannot apply for a (Hangzhou) Residence Permit here in Shanghai. Not only does Shanghai follow different visa regulations, but (from what my company HR staff say) you need to apply in the same city listed on your application form.  Do you have all of the application forms/documents? If so, you can go to Hangzhou yourself to apply.  Bear in mind that the Residence Permit takes 5 working days (not including weekends) to get back. They will need to keep your passport during this time.  EDIT: You might be able to apply in Shanghai... More research needed."
shanghai,3dwd0e,ikiel,3,Mon Jul 20 02:10:02 2015 UTC,"Sounds like a great idea, I'm sure lots of people would like to buy wine at wholesale prices. I'd join the group for sure. Just wondering if a Wechat group is the best platform though. Especially as a group it might get a bit spammy and you'd lose the overview. Might make more sense to create an official account that people could follow?"
shanghai,3dwd0e,BlackGlove,3,Mon Jul 20 02:29:50 2015 UTC,It sounds good but you wouldn't be the first one trying it (fellow wine seller). Wechat is not the optimal tool to sell wine unless its an official account.

shanghai,3dwd0e,phatrice,2,Mon Jul 20 05:30:19 2015 UTC,"Great! So it shouldn't be too hard for you to understand this concept. The purpose of using a wechat group (or official account) to take orders once a month is to enable people to take advantage of wholesale prices. We are a trading company and not a physical store so we usually sell wine by the container or, at the very least, by the pallett. If we can eventually put together monthly orders of 100 cases or more then we begin entering the volumes in which our company is comfortable dealing with. Shanghai has a great expat community and using Wechat in conjunction with social media outlets such as Reddit is a great way to reach that community."

shanghai,3dtiwy,JJLuckless,5,Sun Jul 19 09:58:11 2015 UTC,In a more polite way I think he meant to ask do you have a permit/license to employ foreigners.   I think that's a generally valid question on what is a mostly foreign populated subreddit. Also you don't often hear about what sounds like smaller chains with foreign employees.   So generally curious can you guarantee visas etc and what opportunities are likely to develop for a foreigner taking what is quite a low salary?
shanghai,3dtiwy,redditorjay,2,Sun Jul 19 10:41:19 2015 UTC,"Thanks for clarifying! We do indeed have a license to employ foreigners.   We're looking to employ either foreigners or Chinese.

Nice to see you guys have a Reddit presence, so I suppose I should seize this moment and ask you: That time I had the mexican, and my coworker had something else, and our dogs seemed to be the exactly same thing just with different toppings. Is this the case for all options?   Also, my mexican was cold while my coworkers meal was warm. Is the mexican supposed to be served cold as to preserve the sauce and nachos on top or something? We ordered ours to go (all 4 seats at the restaurant were taken) and were going to have them outside , but I had to go bring mine back to the office and put it in the microwave :/"

There are at least 100 thousands expats in Shanghai. Then maybe I can delegate people to do it. Not everyone knows what you just mentioned.  I'm wondering what kind of management headaches WS is facing, it will be real hard manage a lot people providing this service, they only have 1 Wechat account. And their staff is probably not as dedicated as me. My edge would be, I'm a local Chinese, I know more local O2O services, I'm very flexible, easy to change. I can help expats order almost any delivery and get it within 2 hours( only Beijing and Shanghai so far), I can also call a cab near you. I know Wechat Secretary has a regular working time, I can also work at night, so if you need something to be done real quick at night, you should ask me. What do you say?"

If you want an offline version without an app you can just save this one from shmetro.com to your phone: http://www.shmetro.com/zbdt/overall/english_large.jpg  Googling 'Shanghai metro map' gives about a billion similar images.  Even if you don't speak any Chinese it would help to at least learn some of the major stations and core words that'll help you get around, at least then if somebody refers to Nanjing Xi Lu, you know it's referring to West Nanjing Road.   路 (lu4) = road 西 (xi1) = west 东 (dong1) = east 北 (bei3) = north 南 (nan2) = south    Either way, metro's pretty easy to use, everything is in English anyway."

Millions from all the people in Shanghai that never did any sport in their life and earn 5k RMB a month with virtually no disposable income? :P  Let's not forget that your landlord will squeeze you dry as well, hence the ridiculous membership fees.  Getting the equipment yourself (unless you need the real heavy weights) is usually the best idea.  There are lots of hotels though with gym and pool that are open from 6am, but membership fees are usually outrageous.  Hotel Nikko comes to my mind for Jing'An."

After a colleague called a few times they apparently won't offer me anything for the tank I have. They will not deliver bigger than 5kg for a grill (which is reasonable) and don't want orange tanks for some reason, or at least in JingAn they won't touch it. A new 5kg tank + gas +delivery is a big 350rambos. Supposedly more expensive for first time customers, will get cheaper delivery for repeat users.....  As for SH gas, once we finally got in touch with the correct office for where I live, they refuse to deliver a tank. They said the delivery men will check if your house has a hard gas line, and if so....meiyou.  Probably not in time for your BBQ, but I will probably end up using xiwei.

I would like to work in public health specializing in epidemiology. I would ask my relatives and friends for help if they had business in the Healthcare area but sadly, they don't."
shanghai,3dbugq,ExcaliburZSH,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:31:42 2015 UTC,"If you want to specialize in epidemiology, I would think you need to go to med-school. What a recommend is you volunteer or work for a year  in that field. See if that is what you really want to do. I can see some NGO's liking you in the field as a secondary translator. A few more questions;  What work experience do you have?  Do you have any certification for you Chinese? Mandarin, Cantonese or other? Any other languages?  What other skills do you bring? Can you draw, do you know how to read a blueprint, can you hammer a nail?"
shanghai,3dbugq,ExcaliburZSH,2,Thu Jul 16 00:21:08 2015 UTC,"Epidemiology is a field in Public Health. You can obtain either a Master's or PhD on it. You don't get an MD for it.   What is ""NGO""?  Currently, I work at a non-profit organization in the US. I am experienced in customer service and public relations because of the job I am currently in. I am also a certified notary public.   I was brought up speaking both Mandarin and Cantonese. I am more than fluent in the two dialects.  I learned Spanish in High school and in University.   I'm not sure how reading a blueprint, or hammering a nail would come into play with this question I have."

shanghai,3dbugq,olyphto,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:51:12 2015 UTC,"I did not know it was not a MD degree, thanks. What are your plans for getting a higher degree?  So you know how to talk to people. Your certification means you can work in one of the consulates in China. If you just want to live and work here, that with you language skill, that would be an area to start looking.  You are fluent according to who? Do you have a piece of paper to back up this boast? No paper, look into certification, HSK is the common one people get.  I asked about other skills. What do you know that makes you stand out from others? Reading a blueprint and hammering a nail means you have some skills that can be used in a number of areas, but in general it means you have practical skills to put something together correctly. i.e. you are a person who doesn't need tech support to turn on stuff."

So to clarify, I do have the 回鄉證, and I know that there are restrictions on that. Thank you for asking your friend for me.   I'm not aspiring to move out of the US because it's probably fun to, but I understand why you would suggest a vacation. I want to get back in touch with my roots. Because I was brought up in the US, I feel that I missed out on a lot of the traditions, things that I see my family in Asia are celebrating that isn't celebrated here."
shanghai,3dbugq,ExcaliburZSH,2,Thu Jul 16 01:56:20 2015 UTC,"Take a year off, volunteer-work abroad. Then get a Masters, then work at the WHO or CDC for a couple of years, volunteer to help out in Haiti, learn how to do what you want to do, then go help the motherland."

shanghai,3dbugq,kanev91,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:44:57 2015 UTC,Getting a job here will also depend on your passport. If you have a Chinese one (suggested by your friends and relatives comment) then you're all set to work. If you have an international one (excluding Hong Kong) you're not eligible to legally work in Shanghai without two years of post-graduate work in a professional field.
shanghai,3dbugq,kanev91,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:31:25 2015 UTC,"I have a US passport but because I was born in Hong Kong, I was able to get the card to return to China (don't know what it's officially called). How would that work out?"
shanghai,3dbugq,na1nsxr,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:35:47 2015 UTC,"Not entirely sure how it works in that situation. If you were born in HK and have a HK ID card you should be able to work there fine. As far as I recall you can't have dual nationality with a HK passport so if for some reason you decided to get a HK passport to seek work in the mainland you'd have to give up your US nationality.   More importantly though, have you ever been to the mainland? If not check it out before you make such a big decision :-)"

It's close to Metro City, on the road where the church is, opposite side.  Food is okay. Not bad but there's better. There are a few typical NK dishes and the cold noodles are really good! I've been to NK twice and I can tell you this place is the real thing - especially since, at around 8 o'clock, the waitresses all pick up instruments and perform a tacky North Korean dance and music routine with authentic NK vibes. It just seems hard to fake that part ;) The show is a big reason to visit, next to the cold noodles and other NK dishes.  There's another one at Zunyi Lu / Tianshan Lu in Changning. Never been there, but it should be similar.  They're all operated by some China / NK cooperation agency. The waitresses usually come for 3 - 4 years and then return to NK. I hear they all have an overseer who keeps them in line and controls them strictly. That job is quite a privilege to them. Not many North Koreans got to see the rest of the world."

When I monitor network traffic on the server and client machines, it's nowhere near what my network should support. Whereas when I have astrill set to global, I often see much better results.  So you use it for the browser only? The OSX client has it's own whitelist/blacklist which ships with a convenient list of GFW access rules. Can you import access rules into proxyomega?"

shanghai,3d3mlm,kisses_joy,2,Mon Jul 13 14:20:08 2015 UTC,"What are some recommended iOS apps to use while in Shanghai?(found a metro one so far)   BonApp for restaurants. Really good app, get involved.  China Air Quality Index, PM2.5 is a useful thing to keep track of.  WeChat for messaging, it's what everybody uses here. Get used to audio messages, they're stupid until you start using them and then you wonder why you ever typed anything.  滴滴打车 or whatever taxi app of choice for getting around (Uber is getting pretty popular here too).  Also very worth getting a VPN setup now - Astrill have an iOS app, though I'm an Android user so can't vouch for how good it is. But since Google is blocked here, if you rely on those services you'll want a VPN from the get-go.  Also worth getting Baidu Maps going since it just works so much better than Google Maps here due to Chinternet.   Is there any tips for flat searching?   Go to the real estate agent yourself (with a Chinese friend if your Mandarin isn't too good). Tell them exactly what you're looking for, the area(s) you want to live, your maximum budget, any dealbreakers you have, and tell them not to show you anything that doesn't fit those specifications. Give them your phone number and tell them to call you when they can show you what's available. Best way to do it is take a full day and just arrange a bunch of viewings.  Don't believe anything you see online; 99.999% of the time those are bait-and-switch adverts showing a beautiful apartment at a disconcertingly low price. When you call, you'll get 'oh, what a shame, that apartment has just gone, but we have lots of very similar ones', at which point they'll show you a bunch of shitty apartments that are half the size and twice the price. Expat sites will have legit apartments but they'll have hugely inflated prices. Better just to deal with the agent directly.   And anything else that I should be informed about before I leave for Shanghai.   This page, and this page (and the FAQ in general) might help. Watch out for scams when you're new here.   Oh, and where do Kiwis hanghout?   There's a Kiwi restaurant on Dagu Lu called Little Huia, there are always Kiwis around there. There are also a bunch of NZ cafes and NZ-owned places around town like Fix, you'll find them as you go. There's also a monthly Kiwi Drinks organised by a total twat, but it's a great place to meet Kiwis.  You'll also usually find Kiwis at the Camel, a sports bar. Aussie owned but usually plenty of Kiwis hanging out watching the rugby/cricket."

Totally unrealistic for Germany, but in China people with western education and experiences are usually far ahead of their Chinese counterparts.

shanghai,3ctnaa,GomiHolloway,6,Fri Jul 10 18:03:22 2015 UTC,"American who's lived in Shanghai for 2 years here: I make it a point to check out what’s going on with the independent music scene every few weekends.   In regards to your mentioning of there being a tough environment for drummers to thrive in Shanghai yes there are indeed practice rooms to reserve in Shanghai.  Music right now is more of a hobby outside of work for me, so there are people who take it more seriously in Shanghai/have lived here longer that know more people and venues- cough /u/dteeban and his plethora of bands cough.  My 'story' is that I started out by attending the open mic nights at Yuyintang on Mondays for about a year then that got old due to disorganization among other things so currently performing at the Folk Nights there during the week maybe once or twice a month, which is hit or miss with getting an audience due to the fact that it’s a work night and weather and yadayadayada…  Have played and attended shows at Live Bar and Harley’s and had a random weekend trip to Hefei during my first year in Shanghai to play an acoustic set at Paul’s Pocket  Mao Livehouse is another prominent venue here that hosts bigger weekend rock/metal shows  To your point yeah like /u/Lumpiest_Princess said from what little I’ve seen at JZ Club the musicians there are professionals and can put on a great show, so if you’re into the jazz scene it’s definitely worth checking out in Shanghai.  A bigger problem you didn’t mention that I’ve noticed about music in Shanghai is the polarity between mega acts and the ‘amatuers’.  Shanghai gets the arena Ed Sheerans, Taylor Swifts, Maroon 5s, and Katy Perrys on one end of the spectrum (guess you can throw those jazz professionals in this group too since their career is likely music), and there’s the casual ‘let’s-just-do-it-for-fun-this-week’ startup bands on the other end of the spectrum.  So it seems like there’s a ‘no man’s land’ between these types of acts in Shanghai, but there are bands like XXYY and Friend or Foe lasting for 3-5+ years as foreinger bands in Shanghai that ultimately break up because of members’ departures (also heard The Horde is done?).  It seems like the average timespan of a foreigner’s stay in Shanghai is 2 years from what I’ve been told. Given that rough estimate the clock is ticking while you are out connecting and listening to the local bands here trying to build something musically before you have to decide if you want to keep up this regimen that rakes in zero funds.  It’s obviously not going to be easy to make it as a musican here like it is anywhere else in the world, but Shanghai seems like a city that’s even more difficult to do so if you’re a foreigner because unelss your Mandarin is tiptop you’re already at a disadvantage communication-wise.  25 million people in Shanghai and how many are foreigners? It’s like less than 5 percent of the population isn’t it? So from a business standpoint your best bet at developing a rapport with your listeners is to get your Mandarin on point so you can speak to the majority of the people living here (but I’m just spitballing here).  Anyway I could go on and on and on and on about what my perspective is regarding Shanghai’s music scene, but there’s no substitute for going out and watching shows yourself to get a better idea of what you like/dislike.  Enjoy Shanghai! : )  tl;dr /r/Shanghai is useful for event promotion, going to shows in Shanghai is the best way to give you perspective"
shanghai,3ctnaa,boilerladd,3,Sat Jul 11 05:47:06 2015 UTC,"this is a very good post. OP, you should listen to what this guy says.   JZ Club the musicians there are professionals   point   average timespan of a foreigner’s stay in Shanghai is 2 years   point   even more difficult to do so if you’re a foreigner   i might contest this, but i'll explain later   less than 5 percent of the population isn’t it?   it's actually only 0.8% of the population. it seems much higher than that if you are a foreigner, because they cluster together. even when you hear shanghaiers whine about how the city is ""full of foreigners"" -- not only is it not even 1%, fully half of those foreigners are japanese and korean meaning they more or less blend in"

shanghai,3ctnaa,boilerladd,2,Sat Jul 11 08:29:43 2015 UTC,"What's the script with the open mic on Mondays? How long is a set? Would you consider it worth it even if just to get some practice in a live environment?  I actually have a fairly decent history of playing in touring bands back in Scotland and have played a couple of major festivals too. All of that was easier than even getting a band off the ground over here simply because the appetite for live music in the UK is amazing compared to over here, there seems to be a disproportionately small number of people with any real interest in live music in Shanghai.   I checked out the Machinery of Other Skeletons show last night and the first two bands got very little in the way of crowd participation, which was disappointing given the high levels of energy in the music itself.  TMOOS did a great job of hyping up the crowd and the response was the best I've seen for a local band here (excepting the knobhead in the baseball cap windmilling like an idiot. I love moshing and circle pits but that ""violent"" style is just pathetic).  So there definitely is interest, you just need to work hard at garnering it.  You said music is a hobby outside of work for you and I feel like that is the case with about 90% of those people living in Shanghai and playing live music. That's not a bad thing though, that's just the reality of it regardless of where you're based. It takes a lot of hard work and dedication to hold down a job and put so much time into music on the side, it makes me appreciate those who do it even more.  OP; opportunities may arise but you'll have to work hard for them, probably doubly hard than in most other countries based solely on the apparent lack of interest in live music within the population as a whole. Get a job to support your hobby and put as much time and effort into your music as you can. Just don't expect anything too much beyond the satisfaction of doing something that you love doing.  All the best with it!  (p.s. /u/boilerladd , keep up the good work with the Folk Nights, I've caught a couple and it's always great to see people making an effort! Hopefully when my friend and I's band are ready we can also work hard to keep improving the Shanghai music scene."
shanghai,3ctnaa,GegYaBas,1 point,Sat Jul 11 07:25:39 2015 UTC,"Just don't expect anything too much beyond the satisfaction of doing something that you love doing.   True true  Thanks man! Appreciate you coming out : )   Hope your band works out  The script with open mic on Mondays? From when I was going it was super casual, like if you have your own setlist you can go up and play for a length of time that is determined by how many people want to get on stage after you, so 15-30min in general.  I would consider it's worth it to go to open mic night if your   A) Goal is to perform live and develop a stage presence/get better in general   B) Interested in meeting musicians to jam with"
shanghai,3ctnaa,boilerladd,4,Sat Jul 11 08:22:39 2015 UTC,"So it looks like you're considering a move to China. Good choice! But there is a key question that you must ask yourself: considering the variables involved, do I really want to live here?  The key point to whether or not you make it at all in China as a musician, or anything, really, is something that you will hear from the business world, parroted over and over: it's all about connections.  So, welcome to Version 1.0 of my Guide to Being a White Guy in China.   A White Guy in China does not have to be a guy. There are White Guys in Female Form (WGFFs). A White Guy in China does not have to be white. There are black white guys. There are other options for a number of White Guys in China, but it is both an entry channel into and an ever-present fallback for people that can fit the bill.   ISSUE ONE: VISA  China is not a visa-free country. With the exception of Japanese and a few other passports, you can't even enter the country for a significant amount of time without a visa for which you must apply and pay. Is this a huge hassle? No.  Now, many people will tell you that it is a huge hassle. The visa is the most ever-present and nagging problem in many foreign communities in China. But, like most things in China, you can buy one. 10,000 RMB will sort you out for a year with a work visa at a company that will answer the phone any time, say you're a great employee, and show tax stubs. Is that a lot of money to pay for a piece of paper? Yes. But what would happen if the UK, US, or German embassy hung up a sign saying ""we have 100 1-year visas, no questions asked, for $/£/€10,000, first come first served""? There would be riots. People would be fighting tooth and nail to get in the door.  So have some perspective. You're going to spend either a bit of time or money to legally stay in the country. Everyone deals with it, you will too. Worst case scenario, you're paying £100 a month to just ""be legal"". You do not need a performance visa. You will sort something out.  ISSUE TWO: LEGITIMACY  This is where being a White Guy comes into play. Race is a huge factor. If you're white, you are a white guy. If you are black, you are a White Guy -- ""foreign enough"". It's significantly harder, but if you play your cards right, and you are Aisn, you can still be a White Guy. Kaiser Kuo is a good example. He was (maybe still is) in a few decent enough bands, played some shows. But in China, he's an absolute rock star. Frequently billed as such in expat publications. He's also the head of communications for Baidu (Chinese google). Is he a qualified tech professional? No. Was he close friends with the people who hired him? Yes. Is he kind of an arrogant douche? Yes. Does he deserve the success and easy ride that he enjoys. Yes, yes absolutely. In the right place and the right time, knew the right people. That is how the game works in China.  (If you do not fit into the above racial categories, don't sweat it. People will bring up your race all the time, just brush it off. If you're a UK Arab, you'll just be ""an Arab from the UK"". If you're Chinese-born German, you'll ""Chinese, but he lived in Germany or something"". People will constantly define your racial and national identity for you and there is nothing you can do to change their minds. Do not waste your time worrying about this. You will only frustrate yourself.)  So you want to be a musician in China. You need to know people. You will need some savings because you're not going to be able to support yourself playing music the first few months. You can also teach English; it's really the McDonalds of White Guy Jobs in China -- anyone can do it. It's degrading, and boring but it's also extremely easy money. Thats a personal choice for you to make. Back to knowing people -- you need to basically find venue owners or people that know them who are interested in having ""foreign"" musicians play their venues. You will not compete at Jz -- it's got entrenched performers and clientele, and the performers are quite good. Also, importantly -- they know each other. Connections, once again. Make friends with them and you can join that club. But that'll take you a few months.  So what do you do at the start? You go everywhere, meet everyone, ask venue owners if they need musicians to play, accept what you can get, get your face and name out there and it will snowball if you do it right.  ISSUE THREE: LANGUAGE  Really not that big a deal. Buy textbooks, talk to people, get a tutor, put in effort, learn that shit. People who are dirt poor in Africa learn 4-5 langauges in some regions out of pure necessity without textbooks, smartphones, Berlitz, whatever. You can handle this. Will it be hard? Yes. Will you pull it off if you really want to? Of course.  The bar isn't even set that high. Notice how in pretty much all cases foreigners' langauge abilities, as long as they are not Asian, are qualified with an adjective or phrase. ""Fluent Mandarin"". ""Perfect Cantonese"". ""Japanese just like a native"". Now an English-language magazine wouldn't describe a Japanese person living in China as speaking ""impeccable Mandarin"" -- even though the langauges are structurally very dissimilar, people assume they're pretty close, and an Asian guy speaking two Asian languages is nothing remarkable to them. Whereas you speaking Mandarin will blow minds, Chinese and foreign alike. Both Western and Asian culture give very little credit to Asian people learning English or French or whatever, as it's just viewed as par for the course, whereas a white person learning Mandarin is still a jaw-dropping, earth-shaking acheivement.  Almost all foreigners described as ""fluent"" are ""conversationally fluent"" or ""functional"". Shoot for that. If you can stand up and say ""Hey everyone, I'm Dorby Buster, and I'm going to be playing some awesome jazz music for you tonight!"", you're set.  About the first sentence of the previous paragraph: among foreigners this can be a very sensitive topic -- if you criticise other people's language skills you'll often be subject to ad-hominem attacks. I have yet to meet a foreigner that I consider to be eloquent in Chinese. Definitely not something I'd say at an expat event, though. You will be given a very easy linguistic ride in China, and massive amounts of credit for whatever progress you make. Just enjoy it. Which leads us to:  ISSUE FOUR: BEING REALISTIC  You will get gigs because of your foreign appearance. Just accept that. Do you want to develop your skills to the maximum and become an absolute virtuoso? Go to the United States. Do you want to have a great time, meet fun people, get paid to do what you like and become a demi-virtuoso? Come to China. Lekker; you'll like it.  You can play venues in China and make a few gs a week, more than enough to support yourself. Willing to travel? Let ""foreign agents"" know this, meet people who arrange gigs. You'll be massively overbilled as some international superstar to play silly gigs in cities you have never heard of in the middle of nowhere. Take the checks and face the facts -- this is a sweet deal.  ISSUE FIVE: ALL THE OTHER STUFF  Gotta boil your water before you drink it. People saying dehumanising stuff to you on a daily basis on racial grounds -- not harsh racism, but just ""lol all of your foreigners do [whatever you have just done]"". People spit on the street. Animals are kept in shitty condition in pet shops, you'll see guys hit their girlfriends on the street from time to time and there's nothing you can do about it. Mandarin is not exactly Spanish. You will struggle to learn it. Shitty shopkeepers will try to rip you off. Reddit is pretty much representative of foreigners in China -- some nice people, a bunch of really argumentative bitter jerks that are negative about almost everything for no good reason.  At the same time, you'll enjoy awesome nightlife; a bottle of beer is cheaper than a can of soda water. The structure of the cities is fun, there's plenty to do. The food is amazing. People are friendly. There's a great rail system that goes all over the country, flights are readily available and cheap. There are many sights to see. You will get laid. You will get paid. You'll learn a new langauge. Maybe you'll fall in love. Keep your head up and your eyes open and you will have the time of your life.  There are pros, and there are cons. This is the game and these are the rules. You can not change the rules. The only choice is to play or not play."

Everything from classics to experimental funk. It's not a huge scene either. Depending on where you went to school, playing in your college five-piece probably won't be enough experience. Most players here have masters in music, play a myriad of instruments, and are also composers. The successful ones I've met also speak fluent Mandarin, although they're usually western.   Good luck though, it's a great scene if you can break into it."

shanghai,3co5or,AllOverShoe,9,Thu Jul 9 12:44:51 2015 UTC,Story behind the photo:   This is one of my good friends that I met during my time in Shanghai. He's been my wingman for rooftop hunting and urban exploring in general. Before he left Shanghai he told me he really wanted to find this rooftop but I had a feeling it would be pretty difficult to get up. After working our way around security and doing some sneaking around guards we managed to find our way to the roof.   Needless to say it was quite an awesome picture to conclude our adventures together.

shanghai,3cmtfc,krikara4life,-2,Fri Jul 10 02:23:07 2015 UTC,"What are you paying? What equity are you offering? Do you have any funding or seed? If not, how long have you been bootstrapping? What is your product exactly, and how does it compare to the hundreds of established and well-funded home automation products and companies in Asia and globally? What will you do when a local competitor rips your product off and sells it for 10% of your cost?   Or, let me guess, you came up with an idea while you were taking a shit one day and you're expecting some 'techies' to implement the entire idea for no pay?"
shanghai,3cmtfc,chinar888,9,Thu Jul 9 07:43:22 2015 UTC,"I am actually saddened by the hostility on this subreddit, when I see people get shitted on or downvoted seemingly no reason. I thought we were supposed to be a community of expats helping each other. But to answer your questions point by point:   What are you paying?   That would obviously depend on your level of experience and expertise. The pay is usually higher for iOS devs than Android devs   What equity are you offering?    I am not offering equity, unless there are things that you uniquely bring to the table. This was a job posting. I am nearing the end of a app development contract with a big local App Dev company here in Shanghai, with most of the functionality that we need in order to launch our first wave of products. Moving forward I want to bring people in house so that we are more flexible with changes, bug maintenance, and time schedule.   Do you have any funding or seed?   I have plenty of money for this project. I do not need seed. Maybe I shouldn't have used the word startup, since that's what you seem to have a problem for.     If not, how long have you been bootstrapping?    I am not bootstrapping   What is your product exactly,   We currently have 6 products due to come out by the end of the year. To get into people's homes, we have created a control box that allows people to control various appliances in their homes such TV's, top box like xiaomi tv, sound system, air conditioners, etc etc. This box controls any infrared and RF devices, acting as the center control centerfor the ecosystem we are trying to build. We have smart wall switches (complete), wall plugs, external wall plugs, multiport extension plugs, smart curtains, and wifi switches, door and motion sensors all to be fully released by the end of this year.    how does it compare to the hundreds of established and well-funded home automation products and companies in Asia and globally?   Home automation is currently only catered to the rich right now. In North America, if you had a 1mil house, it would cost you 50-100k to properly set up a home automation system. Here in China, it might bit more because it's even more niche. There are some companies that have lower price points, but most of them are Wifi module solution companies which are slow to come out with new products and with a wifi based setup creates unnecessary load on your router and a big increase in the consumption of electricity in your house even when at idle.They are also very slow to add new products to their lineup. After our initial R&D, we can probably add a new product every month.    What will you do when a local competitor rips your product off and sells it for 10% of your cost?   I help operate a 400+ employee manufacturing operation shipping to customers worldwide. If the quantity gets to the level where it's feasible for me to manufacture the products ourselves, we will not be undercut.    Or, let me guess, you came up with an idea while you were taking a shit one day and you're expecting some 'techies' to implement the entire idea for no pay?   My current customers for my main business are big box companies in North America, ones that if you are American your family probably shops at. I have very good personal relations with these companies and if what we do here is successful, can very well be pushed into these stores in the near future.   Like I said, this was a job posting seeing if there are people that are interested in the company I have started up. Hope you won't be so negative next time to a stranger you don't know :)."
shanghai,3cmtfc,chinar888,-5,Thu Jul 9 10:02:09 2015 UTC,"This is the type of info you should have included in the first post! Yes it doesn't really sound like a startup, more of an app for an established hardware business.   However, you remain at risk from competitors - and there are literally hundreds of startups working on this stuff. You might want to check out Plum (in the US), they're gaining some traction for automated light switches.  Now regarding your post, adding on the extra information, you probably in the wrong place. This probably isn't the right place for a job listing. Foreigners on this reddit are either students or English teachers or professionals - none of those can easily start working for you due to visa requirements. I would start networking with the local tech & startup community if you want to find coders for this kind of thing.

shanghai,3cissb,loller,2,Wed Jul 8 09:38:27 2015 UTC,"I don't know Shanghai at all, so I'm open to anything.  I envisioned a night scene running through alleyways that are lit with neon lights and a cyberpunk vibe. Depending on the talent I find, it could be a chase scene (if there are 2 or more people) or a running out of time type of scene to get something done (can only find 1 person).  A friend is trying to connect me to some guys who do parkour, which I think would add a lot to the chase, but I don't want it in any way at all to feel like a parkour exhibition video. I want that kind of stuff to be practical, but impressive. I'm also thinking that if I can get in touch with somebody with an E-bike, that it would be cool to film part of the chase with my shoulder rig as I'm sitting on the back and the bike is coasting at the same speed as the talent.  I personally believe that well placed comedy is always a good thing, so I'm all for it. Have any suggestions?"

Comedy in chase scenes is generally slapstick. Won't be able to do much with that as it would require destruction, unless it was completely rethought to be about the girl hiding from the guy by trying to blend in. Not sure off the top of my head right now, slapstick isn't really my bag.   I say base the idea on what actors and help you're getting. You have a shoulder rig and potentially parkour people. What about sound?"
shanghai,3cissb,loller,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:18:45 2015 UTC,"Definitely waiting to see who's in first before I start writing up a draft. For sound, I have a Zoom H1 and some lav mics.

shanghai,3cj3ko,PsyanideInk,1 point,Thu Jul 9 08:18:59 2015 UTC,"I work in logistics, dealing almost exclusively with CN, and this is my take: don't do it on your own. Full stop.   Chinese customs is a nightmare, and tax-exempt/non-profit shipments also tend to be a nightmare, no matter where they are going. I don't have first hand experience with this sort of freight to CN directly, but I've got plenty of experience with standard freight into CN, and have seen enough non-profit shipments go sideways to say all this with certainty.   Reach out to a reputable freight forwarder. They will know how to navigate customs, and thanks to their economies of scale they'll be able to get better inland trucking rates than you'll likely get on your own.   I would recommend a company called GAC (Gulf Agency Company). Look into getting in touch with them, find out if they do non-profit/NGO type shipments (many companies, like mine, won't accept them because of the headache), and if so have them quote it. They have plenty of people in their office that speak near-fluent English, if Chinese is an obstacle.   If they can't do it, then I would start doing searches on the internet for other forwarders, and find one that will. The handling fees will be a few hundred dollars at most, plus the cost of trucking. If you do the go-it-alone approach, you could potentially incur much much higher costs than the handling fees, if you hit any snags.   In any case, if you need further explanation, just let me know and I'll be glad to help. There's certainly a lot more nuance here than what I'm addressing. And, should your organization need a logistics person, I've been looking to move to the non-profit sector ;)"

shanghai,3chxir,ExcaliburZSH,2,Wed Jul 8 01:57:57 2015 UTC,"I'm sure any hostel would be happy to take them. Else you might be able to unload them here piecemeal if there aren't too many.  There's also ShanghaiSecondHand, who are probably willing to come out to you and buy them off you."
shanghai,3chxir,kinggimped,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:09:50 2015 UTC,I could use some. The only books I have to read are LSAT books.
shanghai,3chxir,electroencefalografi,-1,Wed Jul 8 06:16:48 2015 UTC,"If they are not politicaly sensitive books, yo could easily just stand in front of your local high school and hand them out to kids as they leave.... wait, it's summer, nevermind..."
shanghai,3cfk4b,Frostytoe,4,Tue Jul 7 14:59:44 2015 UTC,On mobile but check out Stepping Stones. They do English teaching in migrant schools and need volunteers this summer! The typical English education in these schools is quite poor and volunteer teachers make a big impact.
shanghai,3cfk4b,goumama,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:48:31 2015 UTC,"I second this. A commenter said to beware of scams, this is true, but I've done stepping stones and can vouch for it. You might also check out any church organizations that do volunteer work, such as st peters on chong qing rd., which I think also does a english teaching program"
shanghai,3cfk4b,shanghaibornnraised,2,Fri Jul 10 11:10:33 2015 UTC,"The best place to start is probably Google. A lot of volunteering is in schools in more rural areas. Best you do some Googling.  I'd wager that the majority of active users on here are working expats.   Checkout the sidebar for information about where to live, what to do.  When you have some more specific questions that aren't answered in google/sidebar/lonely planet then you might find the friendly folk at /r/shanghai a little more likely to open up.  Also, it's early in the morning in SH... also probably contributing to the lack of responses :)"
shanghai,3cfk4b,jpr64,3,Tue Jul 7 23:33:11 2015 UTC,No advice other than its a bad idea to volunteer to teach English. There will be some fucker charging parents for your class and he won't be giving you shit.   At my school we had student go to old folks homes and stuff but otherwise volunteering doesn't really exist in china. People are too concerned with themselves. I'll ask around and see if I can find anything for you.
shanghai,3cfk4b,nikatnight,2,Wed Jul 8 00:19:56 2015 UTC,Thank you! I will definitely keep that in mind.
shanghai,3cfk4b,pmedthrowaway,0,Wed Jul 8 00:33:51 2015 UTC,there's actually a decent bit of volunteering lol but i bet you never looked into it
shanghai,3cfk4b,nikatnight,2,Wed Jul 8 10:29:23 2015 UTC,I have volunteered. My statement is accurate.   It's not the same as volunteering in America. In China there's often someone exploiting donating and volunteers for their own benefit

shanghai,3cfk4b,Casutama,1 point,Wed Jul 8 11:07:26 2015 UTC,"I can't help you with working and living, but here's some general advice, if you haven't been to Shanghai/China before:  I recommend looking for a VPN before you get here. It's possible to download one here, but ever since google is blocked, it's got considerably more difficult. Be careful on the streets. Traffic in Shanghai isn't nearly as dangerous as in some other Chinese cities I've been to, but don't expect all cars/motorbikes to stop at a red light, or slow down when they see that somebody's crossing the road. They probably won't.  If you have to get from A to B, regardless of your choice in vehicle, plan enough time to get there. Shanghai is huge, and although the underground is pretty fast, it can be so full, especially during rush hours, that you might have to sit one or two out before one is actually empty enough for you to get on."

shanghai,3cidfd,redditorjay,18,Wed Jul 8 03:43:35 2015 UTC,"Welcome to China, enjoy your stay.  Seriously though, you just have to thicken your skin a little bit. China's a developing country. Attitudes towards animals here are not as warm and fuzzy as they are in the west.  The world is not one homogeneous region where everything is the same. Things are different here. Actually that's kind of the point of backpacking and travelling in general, to see what's different and broaden your horizons. Consider yours a little broadened.  There are a few animal rescue places (check the FAQ) around town, but generally it's not really a big thing here.  Thing is, though... this is China. This isn't 'back home', wherever that is to you. Harsh, I know. But there are plenty of people in China living in worse conditions than those animals."
shanghai,3cidfd,kinggimped,6,Wed Jul 8 05:51:39 2015 UTC,"I totally get you =(, but "" I would really appreciate someone explaining animal welfare rights to me or recommending someone I could speak to about it!"" won't work here or other developing countries.

shanghai,3cidfd,sharksblessme,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:17:39 2015 UTC,"It's really annoying the amount of people in this subreddit that are just jerks.

Instead of any helpful feedback OP gets a bunch of sarcastic comments ""yahhh let's report unsafe driving too lol"" and insults ""you're an idiot."" This is the most volatile, elitist subreddit I am subscribed to. Yeah OP, welcome to Shanghai, where 90% of westerners are awful, miserable people. Anytime anyone posts anything in here that shows they are new to China or aren't yet knowledgable about the societal norms here are treated like this, so don't take it personally."
shanghai,3cidfd,kinggimped,3,Wed Jul 8 09:00:45 2015 UTC,"Wha? People around here are super helpful and friendly. Feel free to link me any other examples of people being treated like this though, I'm happy to have my opinion changed based on evidence rather than just throwing around words like 'volatile' and 'elitist'.  Any place is going to have its share of trolls, but in general this subreddit is pretty bloody friendly to newcomers compared with most of the alternatives, especially since at any one time a large portion of the active posters are newcomers themselves.  Besides, I don't see you stepping up to help out OP. Be the change you want to see."

shanghai,3cidfd,kinggimped,2,Thu Jul 9 03:18:17 2015 UTC,"Link? I'm 99.9% sure that never happened. I generally don't insult people on the internet.  There's a troll who likes to pretend to be me, you might have been duped.  Even if it were true, one guy telling you to go fuck yourself doesn't mean the entire subreddit is 'volatile' or 'elitist'. This is the internet, there are going to be dickheads. Overall this place is extremely friendly and welcoming to newbies, even when their questions/topics are as FOB, first-day-in-China as this one.  Edit: I just did a quick ctrl+f through your post history for all the posts you've made on /r/shanghai. I never said anything of the sort to you, and I have no idea why you would make something like that up and pass it off as fact when it's so easily disproved. The only exchange we've ever shared was me sympathising with you for having your bank account emptied. Which is about as far away from 'go fuck yourself' as it's possible to be."

shanghai,3cidfd,sharksblessme,-3,Thu Jul 9 03:54:09 2015 UTC,"The thread is invisible now. I don't know why it became invisible after everyone downvoted the hell out of me. I deleted my comments, but you can see people's responses to me.   Basically I said I didn't understand why he said unmarried late twenties girls were leftovers because my chinese girl friend told me it is typical for chinese girls to get married in their thirties now, and focus on their careers first. It also happened to be, and still is the case, that every chinese girl I work with is around 25/26 and unmarried. I'm a 25 year old american girl that is married and EVERY chinese lady who finds out I'm married says ""Oh, but you're so young. too young to be married, yadda yadda.""  Anyway, I said all this, and people went nuts. I deleted my comments since they were all at -10 or so and the thread went invisible anyway.  [https://np.reddit.com/r/shanghai/comments/25zvvv/donnie_does_chinese_dating_show/](Here is is.)  Mobking says IF as a qualifier, but it was pretty clear he directed that at me although I was NOT in anyway proliferating that. But look at all the other responses to me. Because I didn't know some arbitrary culture norm people told me I had my head up my ass, I should read more about the world, that my friend is an idiot, etc."
shanghai,3cidfd,kinggimped,4,Thu Jul 9 04:05:31 2015 UTC,"Thanks for posting a link. It's invisible because the Donnie Does people like to delete their stuff when it gets downvoted to save face. Which, I guess, is exactly what you did.  As for the 'fuck you' bit, it looks to me like you just completely misunderstood him.   As an aside - dating before 18 is '早恋' (too early); marrying after 23 is '晚婚' (late marriage). And don't even mention '剩女' (leftover women). This is fake, this is bullshit. Modern Chinese society persecutes women. Fuck you if you proliferate any of this shit, people can get married whenever they like for whatever reasons. It's none of your business!   He's saying 'fuck you' to the people who agree with the outdated idea that you MUST get married at a certain age (i.e. that it's 'bullshit'). He even says, 'people can get married whenever they like for whatever reasons'. He was saying that the whole 'leftover girl' thing is garbage, he wasn't having a go at you for not knowing about the phenomenon. Most people who have no experience of China don't know much about it.  Which is the EXACT THING you seemed to be saying. He's saying 'fuck you' to the opposite viewpoint, the traditional viewpoint. I don't know if English is your native language so it might have just been a miscomprehension thing. But it seems to me like you completely misunderstood what he was saying and instead decided to take it as an insult directed at you.  I don't mean to speak for Mob_King, but it just so happens that he's my best mate and I know how he feels about this kind of thing, so I'm sure I'm not misreading his intentions here.  In summation:  a) The 'fuck you' comment was not directed at you, not even indirectly.  b) The comment was not even directed at people who think along the same lines as you, but at the traditional Chinese culture that persecutes women who aren't married by the 'expected' age.  c) He even apologised for his rant because he felt like using the 'f' word was over-the-top (so cute).  d) It was ONE COMMENT from over a year ago. Not in any way indicative of the wider /r/shanghai community. For that one comment, I could show you a hundred comments where somebody has come here, asked a question that anybody who has lived here longer than 2 weeks would consider really fucking dumb, and people have gone out of their way to help them.  e) The other people who replied to you were actually pretty polite (especially by internet standards), they just had experience that differed from your own (purely anecdotal) experience. 'Leftover women' is a common cultural phenomenon in China, has been widely written about in western media, and I think some of them were just expressing disbelief that you had had such a different experience. Some people even posted several links and sources, so were probably a little frustrated that even though they were trying to explain to you that it was a very common thing, you were refusing to back down because of what your 'Chinese friends told you'. I can't really tell that though, given that you deleted all your comments.  As for why your comments were downvoted, things get downvoted. Can't control how people use their votes. I wish people wouldn't use the down arrow as a 'I disagree' button. But it happens to everyone, especially when what they say goes against the grain or is in some way controversial. But getting butthurt and claiming that the entire community is toxic isn't a way to combat it, it's just a way to create drama.  Go spend a day on /r/china or ShanghaiExpat and then come here and tell me that /r/shanghai isn't a frigging nirvana of good vibes and shiny happy people in comparison. If you spend time in either of those places with such a thin-skinned attitude you'd get crucified in minutes.  Again though, this is a single comment. And in the end, it doesn't support your original point in any way. I'd love to see more evidence of the 'volatile, elitist' nature of this community.  Oh and by the way, when posting a link on Reddit, square brackets first, then parentheses. [Like this](http://www.website.com)"
shanghai,3cidfd,sharksblessme,-4,Thu Jul 9 04:25:54 2015 UTC,"First of all, he was saying fuck you if that's what you're saying because he couldn't even tell that we had the same viewpoints, which I indicated in the text that I posted the link in. Are you trying to be snide asking if English isn't my native language? You can see the American flair by my username. He apologized for saying fuck you because he realized after he posted that I agreed with him (his apology was in response to me saying something like, why are you so upset, I agree with you.)  That was just what came to mind because I mistakenly thought it was you that threw a tantrum rather than the other mod here. And do you think /shanghai is the only sub I subscribe to? This one has a terrible attitude that isn't prevalent in any of my other subreddits, where people are decent to each other, so no need to tell me to go use other sites. And I did back down right away, I just said, ""oh I didn't know, I only heard what my chinese friends told me,"" and people got EVEN MORE upset after I said that. Nice of you to write such an ardent reply sticking up for your sub though, but just take a look at the voting patterns here. Why are almost all the threads at 0 or negative, when compared to other areas (I'm subscribed to /raleigh and /huntsvillealabama) this voting pattern just doesn't occur."
shanghai,3cidfd,kinggimped,4,Thu Jul 9 04:45:09 2015 UTC,"First of all, he was saying fuck you if that's what you're saying because he couldn't even tell that we had the same viewpoints, which I indicated in the text that I posted the link in.

You can see the American flair by my username.   Not trying to be snide, no. We get a lot of people here from different places, I was trying to be sensitive to the fact that English might not be your first language. I use a Reddit app that doesn't show user flair, jeez.   He apologized for saying fuck you because he realized after he posted that I agreed with him (his apology was in response to me saying something like, why are you so upset, I agree with you.) That was just what came to mind because I mistakenly thought it was you that threw a tantrum rather than the other mod here.   Again, can't tell because you deleted your comments. But I do know Mob_King pretty well, and I know that he's not the kind of person to say 'fuck you' to a perfect stranger, especially not on the internet. If anything, quite honestly the guy is too nice. Like, to a fault. Pisses me off sometimes, if I'm going to be honest.  And anyway, he wasn't upset at YOU. It was about the prevailing attitude in China that people need to get married by a certain age. 'Fuck you if x' or 'If you do this, fuck you' is a common Reddit trope. It's not aimed at a single person in particular, you're taking the whole thing so personally!   And do you think /shanghai is the only sub I subscribe to? This one has a terrible attitude that isn't prevalent in any of my other subreddits, where people are decent to each other, so no need to tell me to go use other sites.   I'm honestly amazed that you're still subscribed to this place if it's that horrific for you. With one click, you could remove this toxic filth from your front page and frolic in the meadows of happy happy fun times internet instead. I don't see what you get out of being here other than the opportunity to complain about it.  You might have noticed that the insults and shitposts routinely get downvoted here. We can't stop people from posting dickish things.   Nice of you to write such an ardent reply sticking up for your sub though, but just take a look at the voting patterns here.   I'm off sick today and have time on my hands, usually I wouldn't bother with something as silly as this but I'm bored and can't sleep. I'm not really 'sticking up for' the sub per se. I mean, completely honestly, I don't really give a shit. But in my experience of this place for the last few years, I'm genuinely surprised that you have such a negative view of the place. That's why I asked for links. And yeah, you managed to provide one link, which doesn't actually prove your point at all because you deleted all your comments anyway.  For a regional subreddit filled with expats, it's the friendliest place I've seen. The subs you quoted are no doubt full of people born and bred in the area and so are filled to the brim with local pride. GO ALLIGATORS! It's not the same thing. This place is full of expats, many of whom are probably pretty tired of the shitty parts of living in a developing, communist country. But compared with other Chinese subreddits, the ranting is pretty minimal, and most people here celebrate the good things Shanghai has to offer rather than fill up the subreddit with ranting, sniping newbies, and general dickmanship. Which to me is awesome.   Why are almost all the threads at 0 or negative, when compared to other areas (I'm subscribed to /raleigh and /huntsvillealabama) this voting pattern just doesn't occur.   I'd hate to tell you that this is fairly common knowledge because I wouldn't want to upset you (there have been a few threads about it), but there are a few downvote bots/trolls here. Same on a lot of subreddits, actually. Everything gets voted to 0 immediately after posting. It's not a problem since the worthy content gets upvoted anyway. I encourage you to upvote threads that you feel don't deserve the downvotes they've received, rather than simply observing or complaining about it. It's kinda the whole point of the whole voting thing.  Anyway, look. If it's really that bad, unsubscribe. But again, I really don't care. I'm not the boss of you. Stick around and complain every time somebody says something that can be re-imagined as a slight if you squint hard enough, it's all good. I was just interested by the fact that your view of the sub differed so much from the prevailing viewpoint that this place is surprisingly friendly and welcoming compared with the alternatives.  Edit: feel free to have the last word, I'm going to see if I can sleep. Have a great day!"

Went back to shop but owner refused to give hm any money back. Went back with Shanghainese friend. Still no joy. Called police. Police came and maybe did something because friend was foreigner. Went in police van to station (shop owner in another). Eventually got 1500 back (price of dog). Other people had complained before it turned out. A day later shop was gone. Got money back because dog sold was ""faulty"", nothing to do with animal rights, which are not law here. Dread to think what happened to the animals. So, was this a win?"

Like most of my colleagues I don't really have much interest in hanging out with tourists (because that means I am supposed to give free tours/tips instead of shooting). That's why the few other pros I hang out with use wechat or closed other groups to plan trips.   If you are merely looking for someone to take your portrait I suggest going to FC or the bund on a sat or sun morning and talking to one of the bajillion wedding photographers. Some of them shoot quite nice stuff that has honestly positively surprised me.

Even the double rooms? Cause that's what I've booked myself for, an X-B type (at least that's what my acceptance letter says) which means I'm bunking with someone else, but will that room be connected to some other rooms, or will it be separate on the corridor?   Side note: I chose a double room cause it was the cheapest I could find that wasn't suspiciously cheap, I'm there for a year (originally planned for a term) and the finances are stretched thin enough as they are for my part."
shanghai,3ca4bh,theleveragedsellout,2,Tue Jul 7 03:13:31 2015 UTC,"Currently at Shanghai University's Yanchang Campus. There's little to no socialising between the local and international students on our campus. It's not intentional, but it's more a case of there are no activities, societies or events which really involve both groups mixing. That said, both campuses have a couple of hundred international students who tend to hang out a lot. Most of the international students are Japanese/Korean or European (there's a few Americans floating around as well).   If you're studying Chinese, the study/workload will give you plenty to do. In the downtime most of us over here go the to gym, eat out, explore etc. One of the tricks to surviving Shanghai is to find activities that you enjoy. I have a few friends who like to ride their bikes all over the city, a few friends who are really into recreational sport (soccer/rugby) etc. That said, there's a big group of us that hit the pub every Friday/Saturday night.  To directly answer your question, the social life is really what you make is. Shanghai has a pretty strong expat community, and you'll be surrounded with a whole lot of international students if you live in the dorms, most of whom tend to make good drinking buddies.  In addition, if you're looking to kill time, one of the best aspects of Shanghai is that the high speed trains give you a lot of opportunities to go on day/weekend trips around the place. You can kill a few weekends checking out Suzhou, Nanjing, Ningbo, Yellow Mountain, Beijing, etc. etc.   Feel free to PM me if you've got any questions."

Ahem; well, in my experience there was never a lot of partying in the dorms since there are guards posted 24-7 that will shut you down if you cause too much noise. Hitting the town in Shanghai is very affordable, so groups of students usually dont have a problem going out to enjoy themselves.  Im not too familiar with Shanghai University, but Baoshan is pretty far away tho, so nighttime expect a one-way taxi ride downtown to be 80-100 rmb. You can fit 4 people into a taxi."
shanghai,3ca4bh,Winston_Sm,1 point,Mon Jul 6 12:00:14 2015 UTC,"There is absolutely no partying among the Chinese in their dorms. It's not what they do, it's not how they study and it's not what they are allowed to.   Most likely you will make friends with a lot of other international students with whom you will go out a lot for sure.   Also, opt to not live in the dorms and quickly find a place for your own. It's cheap and easy enough and will offer a LOT more comfort and infinitely more freedom."

What are you thinking?  I would try to find a service that has experience in doing this kind of thing from your end (US?!) and find out what they know about restrictions, quarantine, etc. The rules are different from/to different countries. If you have specific airlines in mind, then contact those airlines.  I think you're a bit close to your departure date to rely on crowdsourced advice."
shanghai,3br7u6,mihoutao_xiangjiao,3,Thu Jul 2 02:06:33 2015 UTC,Just following on this... what kind of dog do you have? Are you absolutely sure you want to bring her? I know several people who have moved with dogs and several - myself included - who did all of the pros and cons and decided it was a much better choice for the pup to re-home them in our home country than subject them to the move. PM me if you want to discuss at all.
shanghai,3br7u6,wtfshanghai,2,Thu Jul 2 04:08:33 2015 UTC,"I probably should have prefaced this whole post. We've traveled before, I used to work in Korea then I moved back to the US with her, now we're moving to another place. She (my Shiba Inu) is really good with travelling and hasn't had any issues. Money isn't that big of a problem either so paying for better flights has never been an issue.  In addition to this, I was a bit coy with my information. I have a flight and as of yesterday I had everything, including her spot on the plane, booked. I know the paperwork involved and all of that.  As far as I checked there is a 30 day quarantine for dogs coming into Shanghai, but they can be released after an initial 7 day period as long as their bloodwork/paperwork is in order.   I guess the main point of the post was just seeing if there was anything extra when coming from the US. I know about the rabies/health certification with an endorsement from the USDA, she's getting micro chipped next week, and I have the flight regulated crate and all of that stuff. I was just wondering if there was anything else for when I arrive in Shanghai.   I saw something about having a certified vet come to the airport and inspect the dog. Is that the case?"
shanghai,3br7u6,buckwurst,3,Thu Jul 2 15:07:09 2015 UTC,"As far as I know, you can bring the dog on the plane with you, IF it is under 5kg. If over it needs to go in the hold. If I had to put my dog in the hold I would NOT choose a Chinese airline, but a foreign one, as I think they would be more used to doing this and care more. After experiencing often how MU treats its customers, I hate to see what they do to dogs ;)  Also be aware, you can't fly dogs domestically in China, so you need to fly from abroad directly into Shanghai. I think, but am not sure, that flying into HK first would be bad as it would add complication and risk. So best to fly directly from somewhere in your country to SH.  There are agents that help with getting dogs out of China including all paperwork needed for China, airlines and destination country. I assume they'd also deal with the reverse. Bess, at Buddy Dog in Pudong, where we leave our small beast when we're out of the country, speaks English and can probably give you contacts for agents. Buddydog plus net will get you to her site."

I really liked the area - Kerry Plaza is there, and the plaza at the Jumeirah Himalayas was starting to fill in. (We went to the movies there a lot.) Century Park was right there too, of course - you can get a yearly pass. Line 7 goes to Kerry. Line 2 is nearby also. Easy enough to get to Puxi or anywhere you want.  (With Disney coming, the rents in that area may be increasing, though.)"

All pleasures revolve around eating, of course. No bars, but taxi ride from FFC will cost you ¥30-40 and will be quick 10-15 mins if you take Lupu bridge. There is also a nicer area up via Xueye road, all the way to Intercontinental Expo: there you can get a swimming pool / gym membership, and maybe even live nearby, though it still feels like a ghost town over there. If you drive a scooter / bicycle, take Xueye road up to Nanmatou ferry, which will take you to Jiangguo road entrance / not far from Cool Docks as well."

shanghai,3bme5w,TheAtomicDog,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:19:46 2015 UTC,"That's why most people fly Phantoms.  Quads aren't that intuitive to fly.  It takes a lot of practice.  If you want to set up a nice, stable platform for photo/vid, a Naze 32 acro is a poor choice.  You would at least want a full Naze 32.  Also, if you bought your Naze 32 on Taobao, it's not a Naze 32.  Probably a Flip 32.  A basic flight controller won't be stable enough without additional sensors to fly for photo work."

shanghai,3bme5w,TheAtomicDog,2,Wed Jul 1 04:42:55 2015 UTC,"More sensors provide more data for the fc, so it does help a bit.  But I wasn't able to find a single, legit Naze 32 on taobao.  I got a couple from the states and the difference was significant.  At the end of the day, you'll want GPS as well.  Naze 32 can do it, but it won't be ideal.  Better to get a Naza or APM or something more robust.  I don't think the Naze, Flip or even the CC3D are going to be ideal for photo work.  You should ask over at /r/diydrones.  They'll have the info you want.  If you just want to see how far you can push your current FC, try to set up in-flight calibration.  I think that's going to be your best bet at getting stability.

I was able to reduce but not eliminate using better vibration dampening.  At the end of the day, this was solved by replacing the FC with a real Naze.  Everything that comes up on Taobao is actually a Flip 32.  Easy to tell because the architecture is quite different.  I tried 3 different Flip 32's and a Taobao purchased CC3D, and all had minor to significant handling problems.  On the Flips I got a lot of gyro drift.  I'm leaving town until the 20th, but if you're still having issues when I'm back, maybe we can meet up and have a look.

In Hong Kong's Ocean Park the mainland people also queued happily and it was fairly civilized while inside the queue.  The real problem begins once they're out of the queue and everything goes. Ocean Park was the worst. The parents plodded along taking it all in, pushing ahead if necessary, but the kids were the true nightmare. Don't bring food? whatever. Don't touch! whatever! Don't smear food over everything! whatever! Don't litter! Whatever! Don't flash photograph the fish? Yeah - flash photography!  Really, the world should be scared when these monsters ever grow up.

Hadn't used any DHS stuff before coming to China (all Stiga, Butterfly and Schildkrot) but really impressed. Chinese know what's up.  It's a really good bat and is perfect for my play style, the only criticism is the wood that the handle is made of isn't lacquered and will chafe a little bit after a couple of hours of playing.

shanghai,3bl79p,cyborg_ninja_pirates,4,Tue Jul 7 11:44:34 2015 UTC,"good luck, you'll need it!  In PuXi pretty much everything is old, and even buildings built in the 2000's are old by now, as Chinese buildings age in dog-years. A lot of Chinese tennants take no care at all of the properties. To quote Rutger Hauer ""I've… seen things you people wouldn't believe…"" when it comes to apartments and their absurd rents.  I'd say on the outskirts of the French concession you can find nice places - also with some searching - for around 7k. Not brand new, but at least well maintained - i.e. no furniture rotting with mold, no corroded electric plugs, no grime covered kitchens.  You will need to see many apartments to find something good for that price. 10 - 20, maybe 30. An alternative would be to live outside the city center. Prices go down and you'll spend a long and annoying time commuting. Or you pay 1000+/month RMB for taxi - but then you could just increase your rent budget instead.  I heard it's better in Pudong. I've been far out to the east once, and it certainly looked nice. I've also been far to the west - Hongqiao and beyond, but those places were rather sad. Never been far to the north or south; dragons live there."

shanghai,3bl79p,stopbeingperfect,4,Tue Jun 30 11:08:30 2015 UTC,"Well, there are several strategies you could use:  Draw a 10 km circle on the map, cut out small ~1 km circles around subway stations, and look for the most remote, newest (2008+), decent-looking communities (you can use satellite view). E.g. check out area around 广中路／广粤路, or along 曹安公路 — driving it should be a breeze.  Or rent a 毛坯房, buy some cheap linoleum on Taobao, pretend that exposed concrete is a Japanese modern style, buy some fancy bulbs and hang them on wires. It's a nice way if you know what you're doing.  Also I would warn you that ""decent view"" can come in a bundle with 60+ dBi 24/7 highway noise, and ""another house view"" means you're shielded a bit."

Security camera footage will often only be played back when the foreigner is defending himself and fighting back, not including what happened before that. If you get into a spat and the Chinese cops show up, do everything possible to avoid being arrested, like paying off the other person and apologizing. Problem is some locals are onto this and will ask for $1000-2000 USD (or more!) without a mark on them and after they started it. That's one reason to avoid; things can be worse.  Americans think it will get sorted out later in Judge Judy's TV show, but in China the police decide everything right then and there about minor altercations. If the other guy claims an injury, you better get some marks on you quick before the police arrive. Sometimes the local will claim injury weeks later and show up with nothing to demonstrate they visited a doctor and demand big money. The Euro football divers can train you in this skill, but a little blood will go a long way.  I knew a fellow with good Mandarin who got into a few brief altercations, a couple of punches thrown but no real damage. When the local complained, but had no blood, the foreigner would just keep blaming the local in Mandarin and since there was no obvious advantage for either person's case, and it takes a little work to arrest a foreigner, the cops just let it be. He only got into spats with locals whose mannerisms and education level was obviously quite low; the cops had no reason to favor the local in those cases."

shanghai,3b5wcm,nikatnight,4,Fri Jun 26 16:04:34 2015 UTC,They tend to wait to return your deposit until after the utility bills have been paid. I would ask to see the bills or to be there when the people come to read the various meters and give the totals.
shanghai,3b5wcm,Theunfortunatecookie,2,Fri Jun 26 07:32:31 2015 UTC,"When I moved out of one place last year, I got my cash back and left, and 10min later the girl called my phone and said that she had forgotten something because she was new and that I needed to come back.   She said that there were unpaid gas bills from my whole year of living there, 50 RMB per month, so I needed to pay additional 600. I told her that sounded weird to me and that I would go home to check the contract first, but she begged me to come back immediately because she would get in trouble with her boss for forgetting to get that money from me.  I didn't fall for that and went home (at that time I had already moved to the new place). The contract said that all utility bills would be delivered in the mail and that we had to pay them ourselves directly. The girl was fabricating a story about it being an exception and that they had received all the gas bills etc., total scam. When she called the next day I told her there was no way I was paying that, and I never went back there again."
shanghai,3b5wcm,pantaoran,2,Sat Jun 27 10:14:12 2015 UTC,"Good luck.   Chances are you'll get screwed, either fully or partially and in my personal experience, agents mostly don't give two shits if the owner refuses to pay back your deposit.  If you rent some fancy place for 15k+ that is owned by some guy with lots of apartments via some fancy agency it might be different, but low to mid range many owners try to screw you when it comes to deposit refunds."
shanghai,3b5wcm,aiguo888,2,Sat Jun 27 10:34:00 2015 UTC,"My experience in Guangzhou is that the owners like to have all the paper utility bills handed them when you resolve the deposit, every one of them that were mailed for the entire time of your living there, even if you were the one paying them. Why do they need a 3 year old water bill for 15 RMB? So the water company can't rip them off. In China, those utility bills are in the owner's name, not the tenant's and they will find out the exact amount of the unpaid portion up until the day or moment of your getting your deposit back, so have all those papers with you. And yes, they will make up some fictional utility you never heard of in your previous years living there that suddenly needs to get paid. Mine was a surcharge for water service for the electric pump based on the floor number. Why wasn't this already factored in? It was, but you need to pay it again because they didn't tell us before, blah, blah.  You should also have the contract with you while you're getting the deposit back, and at the arranged time for this meeting, there really shouldn't be any exceptions to the procedure, like, ""Give us your keys now, there's a problem with the gas bill, and we'll settle it later,"" it gets finalized now and you return the keys after it's resolved. Two of my previous landlords lied to me about reasons to get my keys while I was finishing cleaning before we settled the deposit; one of them ripped me off a lot and the other just a little. My impression was they were trying to prevent me (or some tenant in general) from ripping them off. In China, it's always about having an advantage and leveraging it.   How do you know you're getting ripped off by your Chinese landlord? Because you didn't already rip them off. Chinese landlords really hate to give back all of the deposit. In the future, I would always bring a friend; both of my previous landlords did that during the final meeting, one with good reason, if there hadn't been witnesses I woulda..."

shanghai,3b5wcm,Existential12,2,Sun Jun 28 03:05:06 2015 UTC,"The one who ripped me off the worst just started making stuff up during the meeting, anything that popped into his head, such as, ""You never paid any rent,"" ""I don't owe you any deposit, it wasn't in the contract. Do you have the contract?"", ""Three years ago, you didn't pay rent for one month, can you prove you did?""  He said, ""You don't have the last water bill. I can't give you your deposit back until I know how much it was."" Me: ""You already delayed this meeting five days to get all that information, and there are 3½ years of previous water bills for 20-30 RMB per month, so what could it be?"" Him: ""I can't give your deposit back without that paper."" Me: ""How about you just keep 100 RMB in case there's a problem?"" Him: ""No."" Me: ""The water bill was actually paid by you through your bank account, which you previously claimed showed that I never paid you any rent for more than three years, it's in your hand; I just paid your account for the water later. Let's look at your account for the water bill information."" My translator: ""I can not follow the logic of what you just said. You lose."" Him: ""BIG FUCKING SMILE.""  I was working through a translator who was not able to deal with it, not that I could handle that kind of thing terribly well myself. It's a difficult situation to be in where someone is holding your money and you're supposed to persuade them to give it to you. The only useful response to these kinds of people is paper work. If the case went to court, they would lose, but getting there would also be a bit painful, although it can be done.   If you're in a major city, there is a definite legality involved and a process to follow."

And your European company can pay you, sure -- they just need to do that into your overseas bank account, and cannot give you 1 RMB.   Of course, where there's a will there's a way; a 'rent stipend' can be reimbursed with a fapiao receipt, etc.   The real tip for this situation IMHO is to leave your Masters off your Labor Dept application.

Haggled hard and got a good price at 150 RMB, but on the agreed upon collection date they pushed for more time and every couple day for more time, suddenly asked if they could do some stuff that had a low chance of wrecking the laptop and then told me that they wrecked the mainboard a couple days later. (just a coincidence obv.)  Repair guy told me he might be able to fix it but wanted double.  He did some half assed fix in the end and chipped the casing big time cause chinese people are rough as fuck and just throw laptops around like the owner won't care. Fix lasted a couple days until the mainboard went dead (probably really half assed soldering job).  They obviously didn't give a fuck and a laowei meltdown ensued.  Basically don't do it unless it's really easy and you don't mind that the case will be scratched / dented / seriously damaged optically and if any soldering is done it will most likely be a half assed job that could kill your mainboard as well.

There have been days when Chinese govt-issued AQIs have been lower than the US consulate reports. I'm not sure why everyone talks about the US consulate numbers as being a bastion of purity and truth; this is the lying-est ministry from the lying-est government on Earth."
shanghai,3awtdu,Mob_King,5,Wed Jun 24 04:34:13 2015 UTC,"Then again, behaving as though the AQI is higher as opposed to lower won't have adverse effects on your health."

shanghai,3awtdu,kjazetti,2,Thu Jun 25 01:43:54 2015 UTC,They are using different sensors. Plot two graphs and come back to me with a month of data instead of a conspiracy theory.

shanghai,3aveak,Cheesewheel12,2,Tue Jun 23 20:30:28 2015 UTC,"(2) Just do it in German and no one will know, lol. Doubt it's a problem, but locals in the same boat know better and that's not me.  (3) If your skin is not dark and your passport USAnian, finding ESL jobs and tutoring is easy, but not always legal. Just need to make contacts and keep it quiet from the school or whoever is connected to your visa.  (6) Yes, but of course you would need to have a multiple entry visa, which is the norm for what you've described. If you are really into traditional Chinese culture, it's here in the mainland, but it's easier to access in Taiwan.  (7) Try it both ways and see what happens.  (8) There has not yet been any legal problem for foreigners to access Facebook. You would pretty much have to openly declare your intentions to be a political activist inside China, by vociferously pointing to sensitive issues, in order to receive any feedback from the govt. That's the legal issue. The technical/computer issue of getting over the Great Firewall is always getting more difficult, but still manageable. I use a paid VPN and keep current on the software updates from 3 free services in order to be prepared for emergencies, because once in a while the paid VPN has a problem, sometimes just once a year."
shanghai,3aveak,jo3schmo3,1 point,Wed Jun 24 00:00:14 2015 UTC,Thanks a lot for your input man! Much appreciated:) especially the point about the tourist visas
shanghai,3aveak,jo3schmo3,1 point,Wed Jun 24 00:08:21 2015 UTC,"There have been several good discussions lately about what smartphone to buy or use in China that revealed how useful these devices are in a place where information can be difficult to obtain. Considering where you're going and that you'll be around international students, I think they'll have all the tips you need, but doesn't hurt to research a little about phones and computers in China before you go."
shanghai,3aveak,kinggimped,2,Wed Jun 24 00:29:34 2015 UTC,"1) Go to real estate agency/agencies when you're here, tell them exactly what you want, arrange viewings. Can't get anything done online, it's all bait and switch. Make sure you're strict about your price range and tell them not to show you anything that doesn't match your specifications, because they'll probably try.  2) No first-hand experience but I reckon you'll be fine.  3) It's possible and pretty easy to do, but technically illegal.  4) Re: budget, difficult question to answer and totally depends on you. You can live on a shoestring if you want. If you love to cook then buy your fresh stuff at wet markets. Cheap and fresher than supermarkets. As for drinking, depends if you have more cultured tastes or if Tsingtao is all right for you. The local beers are shitty but very cheap (~3-4 RMB for a 500ml bottle from a convenience store, bar prices vary hugely). Conversely, you can get craft beer at plenty of places here but it's expensive. Same goes for baijiu, you can get the 5 RMB bottles that take a layer off the inside of your mouth or you can splurge on the good stuff. All depends on your standards and how keen you are to save money.  5) lol  6) Yes and yes.  7) Not being mean, but who really gives a shit? You might want to call yourself an American to Chinese people just so you don't have to go through the pantomime of explaining what Croatia is every single time. Sinocentric education system has little knowledge of any foreign country that isn't USA (so rich and burgers!), England (so cultured and gentleman!), or Japan (so evil and dogs!). But in the end, who really cares. Everyone's from somewhere and in the eyes of most Chinese people you are simply a 'not-Chinese' rather than an 'American' or 'Croatian' or 'Ethiopian' or whatever. You're not really going to earn or drop extra points for being from somewhere more exotic. And if for some reason somebody does judge you on that basis, that's usually a pretty clear sign that's somebody you should probably avoid.  8) Just get a VPN, Astrill works fine most of the time. If you're on Android, I recommend fqrouter2 as an easy and free solution. You're not going to get arrested for using Facebook."
shanghai,3aveak,kgall,2,Wed Jun 24 03:09:30 2015 UTC,"Gdje Si Brate! I just finished my semester at Fudan, from New Jersey, but parents are Croatian and Serbian. A lot of these answers are pretty good, so I wont repeat everything that was said. I actually told a cabbie that my parents were from Ke lo di ya and he knew Croatia for the soccer team, so that was pretty dope. You're gunna have a blast, Shanghai isn't REALLY China so the difficulty level is turned down (More like China with training wheels). The biggest thing is how huge the city is. As far as identifying American or Croat, For the average Chinese boli im kurac"
shanghai,3aveak,tigertigerduckduck,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:06:57 2015 UTC,"Being a Croat is pretty safe: you didn't start the Opium Wars, you didn't take a concession from them, you didn't burn down their Summer Palace (at least you can blame the Habsburg Empire if any Croats were involved), you're not contending about influence in the Pacific, Croatia is no rival super-power, so you're fine ;)   But seriously, nobody really gives a damn, and nobody should. Ignore the people who do."

shanghai,3athhr,OldeEnglish85,7,Tue Jun 23 11:22:56 2015 UTC,"Yes, it is a possibility. However, most of the Philippino ayis in China are not here legally. They usually get into China via agencies who sort of ""smuggle"" them through the immigration check at Macao and others come on tourist visas and then stay. You may be able to find one via an agency. There are a select few here with ""legal"" documentation and work permits mainly because this line of work is not considered an employable position for foreigners by the labor department.   If you do get an Ayi, they will usually be a live-in Ayi, sort of Hong Kong style. I have a good friend with a Philippino Ayi and they really like her. They have her because they want to reinforce their child's English.  Source: we once helped a Philippino ayi escape from an employer and uncovered the dark underbelly of Philippino ayis in China.  Note: with the upcoming residence permit changes effective July 1st, there is a provision for ""servants"" of a family to obtain a residence permit through their employer. However, the provisions have not yet been released."
