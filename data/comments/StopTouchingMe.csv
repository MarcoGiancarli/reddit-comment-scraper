StopTouchingMe,3drviu,batfiend,9,Sun Jul 19 02:32:41 2015 UTC,Low carb helped my big fat cat! More meat less bickies.   She is an adorable rolly-polly squawker though.

StopTouchingMe,36pjit,24-7booty,3,Thu May 21 14:30:39 2015 UTC,"Here's the thing. You said a ""dumerils boa is a ball python."""
StopTouchingMe,36pjit,Nixteen,2,Thu May 21 14:43:37 2015 UTC,"Here's the thing. You said a ""dumerils boa is a ball python.""  Do they look the same? Yes. No one's arguing that.  As someone who is a scientist who studies ball pythons, I am telling you, specifically, in science, no one calls dumerils boas ball pythons. If you want to be ""specific"" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing. If you're saying ""python pattern"" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of coolasspatterns, which includes things from squiggles to dark colors to circle.  So your reasoning for calling a dumerils boa a ball python is because random people ""call the dark color squiggle shaped design ones dumerils boas?"" Let's get garden snakes and anacondas in there, then, too.  Also, calling someone a human or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A dumerils boa is a dumerils boa and a member of the squiggle shape pattern family. But that's not what you said. You said a dumerils boa is a ball python, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the squiggle pattern family ball pythons, which means you'd call boa constrictor, garden snakes, and other snakes ball pythons, too. Which you said you don't.  It's okay to just admit you're wrong, you know?  Don't call me out just because I don't know anything about snakes."

It was like the scene in The Exorcist where blood shoots out of her neck. Crazy shit.

They crawl across the sea floor using their flexible arms for locomotion. The ophiuroids generally have five long, slender, whip-like arms which may reach up to 60 cm (24 in) in length on the largest specimens. They are also known as serpent stars; the New Latin class name Ophiuroidea takes Ancient Greek ὄφις, meaning ""serpent"".  The Ophiuroidea contain two large clades, Ophiurida (brittle stars) and Euryalida (basket stars). Many of the ophiuroids are rarely encountered in the relatively shallow depths normally visited by humans, but they are a diverse group. Over 2,000 species of brittle stars live today.  More than 1200 of these species are found in deep waters, greater than 200 m deep.

StopTouchingMe,306iz9,abHowitzer,14,Tue Mar 24 21:51:25 2015 UTC,What is it with cats and their bellies? They absolutely love it for the first seconds and then viciously attack usually. Fuckin' paradox.
StopTouchingMe,306iz9,Rufio88,3,Wed Mar 25 11:24:28 2015 UTC,"It has to do with sensitivity and security. All cats vital organs are located by the belly so instinctively they prefer not to.be touched there. Also I'm not sure with the belly but sensitive area such as the back, right above the tail is very sensitive so although it may feel good in the beginning for them the more rubbing/scratching makes it to intense and causes them to bite or scratch you to stop."

StopTouchingMe,2uakr8,pwnrx,12,Sat Jan 31 23:46:26 2015 UTC,"Well, the first thing you need is a drone, a little one if it's in the house. Then you will need a complicated computer program to fly the drone and handle photography for you. After that you will have get the drone to fly over, dangerously close to your head, and take pictures while you trim kitty feet tufts. You will attempt this for months as you refine your routine and programming, trying to imitate spontaneity, as you were thwarted in prior attempts by the cat losing interest. Finally, after years of planning, a program way over budget, and the hopes of dozens pinned to a dream, it finally happens. The cat looks directly at the camera with something discernable as an expression on its face, all while you just happen to be doing routine pet maintenance. The entire point of which was to attempt to overcome the obvious continuity error in the photo with sufficient cuteness as to not draw attention to itself.  Either that, or someone else took the photo."

StopTouchingMe,2roj4a,autowikibot,3,Thu Jan 8 02:25:52 2015 UTC,"Golden tiger:       A golden tiger, golden tabby tiger or strawberry tiger is a tiger with a color variation caused by a recessive gene. The coloration is a result of captive breeding and does not occur in the wild. Like the white tiger, it is a colour form and not a separate species.  No official name has been designated for the colour. It is sometimes referred to as the strawberry tiger due to the strawberry blonde colouration. Their striping is much paler than usual and may fade into spots or large prominent patches. Golden tigers also tend to be larger and, due to the effect of the gene on the hair shaft, have softer fur than their orange relatives.

The blacktip reef shark (Carcharhinus melanopterus) is a species of requiem shark, in the family Carcharhinidae, easily identified by the prominent black tips on its fins (especially on the first dorsal fin and its caudal fin). Among the most abundant sharks inhabiting the tropical coral reefs of the Indian and Pacific Oceans, this species prefers shallow, inshore waters, and its exposed first dorsal fin is a common sight in the region. Most blacktip reef sharks are found over reef ledges and sandy flats, though they have also been known to enter brackish and freshwater environments. This species typically attains a length of 1.6 m (5.2 ft).  Blacktip reef sharks have extremely small home ranges and exhibit strong site fidelity, remaining within same local area for up to several years at a time. They are active predators of small bony fishes, cephalopods, and crustaceans, and have also been known to feed on sea snakes and seabirds. Accounts of the blacktip reef shark's life history have been variable and sometimes contradictory, in part reflecting geographical differences within the species. Like other members of its family, this shark is viviparous with females giving birth to two to five young on a biennial, annual, or possibly biannual cycle. Reports of the gestation period range from 7–9, to 10–11, to possibly 16 months. Mating is preceded by the male following closely behind the female, likely attracted by her chemical signals. Newborn sharks are found further inshore and in shallower water than adults, frequently roaming in large groups over areas flooded by high tide.

Fish of this family are known as flying fish. About 64 species are grouped in seven to nine genera. Flying fish can make powerful, self-propelled leaps out of water into air, where their long, wing-like fins enable gliding flight for considerable distances above the water's surface. This uncommon ability is a natural defense mechanism to evade predators.  The oldest known fossil of a flying or gliding fish, Potanichthys xingyiensis, dates back to the Middle Triassic, 235–242 million years ago. However, this fossil is not related to modern flying fish, which evolved independently about 66 million years ago.

My daughter put on a leather glove when she went to pick him up--the cat was waiting for us to go away and we had to pick the little guy up to get him to safety--and those talons went right through the leather like it was silk. Those are serious weapons.

I remember going to a reptile presentation and the guy saying the green anaconda will kill you by giving you a heart attack trying to lift her (he said she weighed 15 stone)  I helped put her back into her cage, took four of us to put her back in. She seemed fairly placid but a snake that size could fuck up your day if she decided she had enough of people touching her"

From what I've heard from the guys in the local reptile shop yellows tend to be more aggressive than greens (but with less severe bites). I think 'condas would need to be handled regularly in order to get a quieter one, some animals with previous bad reputations have turned out to be much more docile if captive bred and socialised, tokays for example, there are a lot of videos of people on YouTube with tame tokays. One guy on a forum said he once he couldn't see a particular Australian lizard ever making good pets and now bearded dragons are one of the most popular pet lizards in the world."

Intelligent, curious, they fuckin love water. They're beautiful too.   One of my good friends has a lot of yellows, Brian from Feeder Source. They're some pissy little bastards. Any conda is gonna be better with handling and time, same as any other snake. It takes experience to tame out a green, with a yellow it seems like it may never happen in a lot of cases. Depends on the individual. Cool animals nonetheless.  Some good examples. Lots of people hate Nile monitors and say they never tame out and make horrible pets. Me and a friend bred them and they all used to be terrible, aggressive animals but now the male of the trio is puppy dog tame.

Even if you keep the enclosure/tank/cage very clean, turtles are not good-smelling animals. Everyone that came over noticed it, no matter how clean I kept her.  By the time I enlisted and re-homed her, I was ready to no longer be a turtle owner.  Mine had a mellow, almost charming disposition, and would actually ""play"" with me sometimes, but most turtles are kind of boring as pets once you get past the novelty of having a pet that's still pretty uncommon."

StopTouchingMe,2ey1ks,Jungle2266,23,Sat Aug 30 06:33:52 2014 UTC,Why does it drive you crazy? In legend a basilisk is 'a legendary reptile reputed to be king of serpents and said to have the power to cause death with a single glance.' Which is exactly what is in Harry Potter and exactly what any snake would say about themselves to get the person to release it.   The legend of the basilisk being a serpent is a lot older than the time some dumb fuck decided to call a lizard a basilisk.

I'd rate the core value of the sub to be something like ""adorable aggression"", and the title would need to be believable (ideally concise) narrative from the POV of the critter. The aggression being in response to ""touching"" is strongly indicated by sub name, but should at minimum be in immediate response to being coddled (which is why I felt that the waste basket submission was too far off-topic).

StopTouchingMe,263pb9,autowikibot,3,Wed May 21 07:28:35 2014 UTC,"Stingray:       Stingrays are a group of rays, which are cartilaginous fishes related to sharks. They are classified in the suborder Myliobatoidei of the order Myliobatiformes and consist of eight families: Hexatrygonidae (sixgill stingray), Plesiobatidae (deep water stingray), Urolophidae (stingarees), Urotrygonidae (round rays), Dasyatidae (whiptail stingrays), Potamotrygonidae (river stingrays), Gymnuridae (butterfly rays), and Myliobatidae (eagle rays).    Most stingrays have one or more barbed stingers (modified from dermal denticles) on the tail, which are used exclusively in self-defense. The stinger may reach a length of approximately 35 cm (14 in), and its underside has two grooves with venom glands.  The stinger is covered with a thin layer of skin, the integumentary sheath, in which the venom is concentrated.  A few members of the suborder, such as the manta rays and the porcupine ray, do not have stingers.   Stingrays are common in coastal tropical and subtropical marine waters throughout the world, and also includes species found in warmer temperate oceans, such as Dasyatis thetidis, and those found in the deep ocean, such as Plesiobatis daviesi. The river stingrays, and a number of whiptail stingrays (such as the Niger stingray), are restricted to fresh water. Most myliobatoids are demersal (next to lowest zone), but some, such as the pelagic stingray and the eagle rays, are pelagic.   While most stingrays are relatively widespread and not currently threatened, for several species (for example Taeniura meyeni, D. colarensis, D. garouaensis, and D. laosensis), the conservation status is more problematic, leading to them being listed as vulnerable or endangered by IUCN. The status of several other species are poorly known, leading to them being listed as Data Deficient.

StopTouchingMe,23agqi,comanon,10,Fri Apr 18 03:12:17 2014 UTC,According to the description he is a licensed  wildlife rehabilitator and the eagle had a respiratory infection. That thing could injure the guy if he wasn't careful which is why he handled it the way he did.
StopTouchingMe,23agqi,SuperBlahq,1 point,Fri Apr 18 06:59:29 2014 UTC,So many times in that video the eagle could've taken his face off. The reach of those things with their neck is much further than it appears.
StopTouchingMe,23agqi,comanon,-12,Thu May 22 09:00:55 2014 UTC,"The crux of the creep factor is if the bird only eats when fed by hand, I understand why he handled the bird this way, but I didn't feel like all the effort was worth it unless the bird won't eat otherwise. If the only reason he's filming this is because he thinks people want to see him baby talk and hand feed it, then he's creepy."
