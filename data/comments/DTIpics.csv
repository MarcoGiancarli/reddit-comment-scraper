Could I place a little turbine in the path of the falling water an sleep better knowing my my new nightlight won't fail do to a power outage while I am sleeping?  Edit: a word
DTIpics,3e2lm8,wrongwayjay,3,Tue Jul 21 17:55:39 2015 UTC,"The answer to 'is X a perpetuum mobile' is always no, simply because there's always energy lost somewhere. The fluid rubs against the tube creating friction, so with each loop a little energy is lost, until there's not enough energy in the system to push the fluid upward anymore.  If you insert a wheel into the flow that will also cost energy to operate, making the flow stop even faster."
