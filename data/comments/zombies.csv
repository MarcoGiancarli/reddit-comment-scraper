zombies,3dqpkl,SupremeKai4,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:10:42 2015 UTC,"I like it, needs editing in the worst way but has potential."
zombies,3dqpkl,hollyinnm,2,Sat Jul 18 18:44:22 2015 UTC,"Eh, wasn't really looking to write the perfect story. Just a fun little work that's easy to read and has a semi-interesting plot."
zombies,3dqpkl,hollyinnm,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:03:29 2015 UTC,"I think you should edit, really is a good story and is much better than most of the Zombie fiction I've seen out there. You need to finish and sell it! Plus, I'm really surprised you wrote this on a mobile...I would have had a million more errors!"

zombies,3dj3r6,davinci186282,3,Thu Jul 16 18:03:35 2015 UTC,I can't stand that show but my wife loves it.
zombies,3dj3r6,mattbluesman,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:05:49 2015 UTC,My mother likes this show. Feels like they got the inspiration from that one movie where love turns the zombies to human again.  Such a dumb show but hey if it sells...
zombies,3dj3r6,MarukiChan,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:53:09 2015 UTC,Did you ever see Tru Calling it made me think of that. Except Zombies
zombies,3dj3r6,Epistemo,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:01:23 2015 UTC,It's actually a graphic novel. but It's aimed at women.
zombies,3dj3r6,mattbluesman,0,Thu Jul 16 23:51:01 2015 UTC,I like it.  I am interested in seeing how it grows.  They did a good job on season 1 though
zombies,3dfx2b,Hyperdrunk,13,Wed Jul 15 23:23:19 2015 UTC,"Good idea, as long as you have a draw bridge, you can marshal your own people, and have a way of keeping the ditch cleaned, otherwise a swarm might be enough to fill the bottom and overwhelm the walls. One of the better ideas though."
zombies,3dfx2b,derpmcderp82,8,Thu Jul 16 00:34:31 2015 UTC,The agricultural industry has your zombie ditch cleaning needs covered.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdOPTKcXYwQ
zombies,3dfx2b,seesaw242,7,Thu Jul 16 02:57:14 2015 UTC,"oh great, now, not only do we have the smell of undead around the entire town, now we've got the smell of burning undead completely around town, why don't we just throw some old tires onto the fire for some added aroma?"
zombies,3dfx2b,merix1110,15,Thu Jul 16 05:18:03 2015 UTC,"Great until there's an outbreak in your town and the only way out is to cross a ditch full of zombies.  Also how do you get food/resources/people in and out? You've got to have some break in the wall and bridge across the ditch, which is still a weak point that can be overwhelmed.  It's probably a better plan than none, but takes time, effort, and resources to set up and maintain. Personally I'd rather fortify my own home and have a well planned escape route."
zombies,3dfx2b,boomer478,15,Wed Jul 15 23:44:45 2015 UTC,"Farming communities are huge. They can cover hundreds of acres and even if they only dig a huge ditch all the way around, that dirt can go on the inside as a berm and too steep for even people to climb. It's doable.  They're a farming community. They can have everything they need for the most part and stay isolated very easily."
zombies,3dfx2b,meshnet_user,2,Thu Jul 16 01:19:39 2015 UTC,Hiding in your home will eventually prove a bad decision.   Looters will come and a fortified target is more likely to have a better return for their effort.
zombies,3dfx2b,Ne0r15s,5,Thu Jul 16 19:15:01 2015 UTC,A drawbridge is unnecessary and failure prone. You could just have a narrow land bridge with removable stakes to deter zombies from crossing it.
zombies,3dfx2b,xaqaria,3,Thu Jul 16 01:23:53 2015 UTC,"Until a horde comes.  Then the ones in front get pushed onto the stakes, the ones behind keep pushing, eventually breaching your one weak point."
zombies,3dfx2b,european_american,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:41:36 2015 UTC,A horde is going to overwhelm the ditch/wall eventually as well. There isn't much chance for one though in a rural area.
zombies,3dfx2b,xaqaria,5,Fri Jul 17 03:33:50 2015 UTC,I think your underestimating just how big and spread out a farming community is. In illinois farmland you might only have a house every mile to half mile. Small farms are in the hundreds of acres range. Big farms are in the thousands to tens of thousands of acres. The amount of fuel and time required to dig a ditch mIles long would be far too much.
zombies,3dfx2b,kobullso,3,Thu Jul 16 11:48:20 2015 UTC,"If a horde does come, those big machines could also be used to mow down or just roll over the horde. For me, this was my biggest disappointment in the book WWZ. Oh no, the tanks are out of ammo! Uh, are they out of gas too? Roll over those mothers for days, epidemic ended."
zombies,3dfx2b,jcquik,6,Thu Jul 16 06:49:18 2015 UTC,"Exactly, jump in the combines, put on some free bird and go all LEEEERROOOOOOY JEEEENKIIINNNS on the herd!"
zombies,3dfx2b,MadManZan,5,Thu Jul 16 13:20:50 2015 UTC,"They are running their farms based off petroleum products. Unless they switch completely back to animal labor, conventional pesticide control, they won't be able to successfully function. That would take time, and zombies would likely get in before you could plan it out. A community already running old style, Amish type, maybe."
zombies,3dfx2b,snowcrashit,10,Thu Jul 16 02:16:48 2015 UTC,"But the Amish don't have reddit, and therefore will not know that preparations need to be made for the zombie Apocalypse."
zombies,3dfx2b,shadow1515,3,Thu Jul 16 05:40:35 2015 UTC,"They can grow enough food by hand to feed the local community, there would be no need to mass produce for sale anymore."
zombies,3dfx2b,MadManZan,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:36:57 2015 UTC,"The facilities are designed to mass produce, not to grow by hand. It would take time and resources to train people on how raise crops with conventional methods. The community would also need to have trained, tame animals prior to the outbreak.  Example: A human would need to plant every seed, watch for certain infestations, and irrigate. They would need farm animals, like an ox, to help with the plowing or tilling, etc.   It seems like you would need to have already had some knowledge how to quickly convert to the methods of farming prior to the advent of machines. Storing gasoline would allow you some time for this conversion, but I assume most would be caught by surprise."
zombies,3dfx2b,CrackerJack23,2,Sun Jul 19 04:15:42 2015 UTC,How do you get the tractor out?
zombies,3dfx2b,jrwn,2,Thu Jul 16 13:56:27 2015 UTC,With another tractor.
zombies,3dfx2b,IndefinableMustache,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:59:11 2015 UTC,Why not just build tree houses with rope ladders that can be brought in if needed?  If the Zombies are anything like what we see in The Walking Dead then they wouldn't be able to climb.
zombies,3dfx2b,Maschalismos,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:58:54 2015 UTC,"Nah theyd be plenty of lumber: build foundations on stilts, use a rope ladder to get up and down.   Hell, just adapt the larger barn's haylofts for living space...."

Mute the sound of the show and turn the music up, you're welcome.  edit: protip, start the music and then start the video. It is absolutely incredible"
