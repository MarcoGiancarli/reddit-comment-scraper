Askasurvivor,3e3t07,PrudhoeBayOF,2,Tue Jul 21 19:08:28 2015 UTC,"What are you looking to trade for? We have weapons & ammunition, food, medicine, and other things.  Also, any possibility of setting up an ongoing agreement?"
Askasurvivor,3e3t07,diabloknk,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:30:20 2015 UTC,"Food and medicine are what we are hoping to get as a trade, there is shortage of both of those on the North Slope.   We would be happy to set one up. We are only able to produce 1,000 gallons a month, our refinery is a small one used to sustain the oil field equipment. But an agreement could be made for what we have available."
Askasurvivor,3e3t07,diabloknk,2,Tue Jul 21 19:40:37 2015 UTC,"As far as food and medicine - we can have you at least somewhat covered on that for now. Due to the special type zombie situation in the east coast, we're restricted to shipping everything via beachbum's airship. Furthermore, he's helping us transport food to one of our settlements that's been cut off. So at least for the next 3 weeks, we wouldn't be able to do many shipments - I'll have to talk to him and see what his availability is.  However, once we reestablish a safe route to that settlement, we'll be able to ship more if beachbum is willing. And if/when the beacon that was keeping these special zombies out of our repair gets fixed, we'll be able to establish more regular trade routes.  Beachbum, if you would be willing do trade runs to Alaska, let me know. I understand that your rates will be different. I also have some bonuses you might be interested in - new/custom equipment, weapons, and/or defensive systems."
Askasurvivor,3e3t07,Beachbum313,2,Tue Jul 21 19:50:49 2015 UTC,"We understand, once that situation is under control we can work on trading.   Once Mr. Beachbum is free we could work out an arrangement on shipping. Do you know how his airship is powered? If it has a small aircraft engine we could supply him with the fuel needed to get here in exchange for running deliveries to you."
Askasurvivor,3e3t07,Beachbum313,2,Tue Jul 21 20:31:08 2015 UTC,"It takes a couple types of fuel, actually. We can run off of a wood gasifier, steam power, or aircraft fuel, and our max speed is dependent on which we have burning."

Askasurvivor,3e3t07,diabloknk,2,Wed Jul 22 02:15:55 2015 UTC,"I've got an offer for you. Not only regular food, but I can trade you a few colonies that will let you produce your own. I've only got basic medicines for you but they'll serve well enough. I have tanker trucks that can be used to transport the fuel out in whatever quantity you decide to sell us.  Also, do know that trading with the Republic is a declaration of war upon me and my men, just in case you'd missed that. If you do go through with his offer I might have to pay you a non-trade visit."
Askasurvivor,3e3t07,BenjaminSankt,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:26:00 2015 UTC,"Will those colonies be able to survive in the sub-zero temperature of the Northern Slope? If they are we are very willing to work out a trade.   But, may I ask why would trading with the Republic be taken as an act of war? We are a peaceful community, our only wish is to keep the oil field running and to take care of our workers."
Askasurvivor,3e3t07,BenjaminSankt,2,Tue Jul 21 21:45:25 2015 UTC,"I forgot that he made that little threat of his.   BenjaminSankt is our main competition for weapons trades (not including Wacky William, whose weapons have a 23% chance of exploding). He wants a monopoly, so he's declaring war on anybody who trades with us, because he knows his product is inferior and that attacking us head on is suicide.  Since you're potentially an important trading partner, we'll supply you with weapons - rifles, landmines, rpgs, etc. If you want, we can also send over some soldiers - both to train you guys and participate in your defense against any attackers, not just MDC.  I also wouldn't take him too seriously, he still has a war going on with 7SA, and the last time he got into battle with them, he lost pretty much his entire army. Turns out armies of meth addicts aren't very effective. He talks big, but his ability to actually carry out his threats against anybody with even a hint of real military capacity is virtually nil.  Finally, I would advise against trading with MDC - although I won't stop you if you choose to. Sankt is fond of flooding every community he gains access to with drugs, in an effort to get everybody there addicted and then turn them into slaves. And then he'll make you eat your own children. I'm not exaggerating.  Hell, he tried doing the same to us a few months ago - he couldn't get direct access, so he started firing large bags of drugs out of a cannon at us (where he got the cannon, I don't know, but I suspect he had an ally for that). It didn't work - bags of drugs don't withstand ballistic stresses well, so what little survived being fired out of the cannon exploded on impact."
Askasurvivor,3e3t07,BenjaminSankt,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:32:28 2015 UTC,"We wish to remain a peaceful trader. We won't be taking any armaments in our trades. We need food and medicine.   At this time I do not have an answer as to whether or not we will work out a trade deal with you. With the threat of an attack from Mr. Sankt if we choose to trade with you, I need to call a meeting with other members of the oil field. I will make a post detailing our decision after the meeting."
Askasurvivor,3e2y6q,foresterSG6,4,Tue Jul 21 15:36:58 2015 UTC,"Welcome to the sub. A few things:   The zombies in this universe are something of a mixture of Night of the Living Dead style zombies (slow, shambling dudes) and Left 4 Dead style zombies (mutated zombies with abilities far exceeding normal zombies). Also, to the best of my understanding, it's been around 10 years since the initial outbreak. There are major factions, and they do claim territory. You don't have to join any one of them - plenty of unclaimed territory. It's also not clear exactly how much control they exert over their claimed territories. Depending on the writer, they may even be willing to have smaller independent groups operate within their ""claimed"" territory, and have it make sense.  As far as I can tell, it's sort of like the Fallout universe, but with zombies.  /u/Creathian runs a faction called New Michigan, and they currently claim all of Michigan. You should talk to him about what you want to do in Lansing. There is a map, although not 100% accurate, that shows what areas are claimed. In general, it's considered bad form to do things to other people's characters/groups without their consent. There is a special event going on right now - there was a beacon that was attracting the super zombies, and it failed (for now). The east coast is basically infested with something like 10 million or more super zombies. Somebody should be along pretty soon to invite you to the Skype chat. It's mainly used for bullshitting, but also for setting up collaborations and the like."

Askasurvivor,3e2u7c,foresterSG6,4,Tue Jul 21 15:07:24 2015 UTC,"TL;DR I cant actually sum it all up for you BUT.....  So first off, Welcome to the sub. Im TelekineticHead, The writer for Greg Hugan, A Good guy turned bad guy turned even better guy. In this sub we have events that span the continents, which writers like you can choose to partake or ignore, hell, The way I drew attention to my character was by creating one! These events are highly visible and easy to reference without too much knowledge, although if you want to, you should go back and read some posts on them.   But, Before all that, you'll probably want to know about the zombies. You can find a fairly recent comprehensive list of those here and that list is always evolving, think you have a cool idea for a zombie-type? Message the mods and see what they say, if they say yes, well you have just screwed all the other survivors over with new ways for them to die, go you!.   As I mentioned earlier, There has been several ""Events"" that would make sense if your character had experienced. Such as the Carrington Event which happened again 3 months ago and The Quakes (Basically, Massively strong earthquakes, nearly world ending).  Onto Us. Your fellow survivors and the rules surrounding your interactions with us. If you want to do anything with someones character, Drop them a message via a reddit and have fun collaborating! the worst they can say is no and that doesn't happen very often.We also have a Skype group which you can be added to if you are so inclined.   If you want to claim land, make sure you check the map on the sidebar before you do, beware its not 100% accurate but it close enough so that you wont be totally at loss.  As for the semantics of the sub. The Subreddit exists because a group called The Brotherhood of Snoo operating out of San Fran and the old reddit offices brought it up. No other subreddit is up and as far as we know, No other websites are either. A network called the IuNet used to run which allowed survivors to access satellite imagery has fallen into disrepair.  So thats it. Thats all you need to become the survivor your mother knew you could be, So lets get started then shall we?"

Askasurvivor,3e2u7c,BenjaminSankt,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:17:30 2015 UTC,"As I understand Zombies (I tend to follow the definition written in Max Brooks's Zombie survival Guide), they arent capable of running, speaking, using basic human skills (opening doors, etc).

Askasurvivor,3e2u7c,BenjaminSankt,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:22:38 2015 UTC,"Warnik (the deceased survivor) made mutations that can sprint, and a rare mutant that has the brain capacity of a great ape. I re-introduced them in my last post. We also have zombies from the video game Left 4 Dead (tanks, sprinters, etc.) and Night of the Living Dead zombies, that are more stereotypical. They shamble around, moan and groan and crave brains."
Askasurvivor,3e2u7c,MightbeaViking,2,Tue Jul 21 19:30:06 2015 UTC,"so is there a Wiki post that details where each type of zombie is found? and perhaps the concentration of each type? Like, ""This type of zombie can be found in this area, but hasn't been spotted in great numbers""...almostl ike a field guide for gatherers and hunters.  Also, what kind of supplies, fuel, etc. is available? With proper preparation ahead of time, Biodiesel is possible to manufacture, spare parts can be scavenged off of abandoned vehicles...  Are cars and trucks common?"
Askasurvivor,3e2u7c,Beachbum313,2,Tue Jul 21 19:34:36 2015 UTC,"There's not, Warnik's wiki is bare. But here are the posts where he introduced them. A field guide would be really nice to have, I can work on setting one up.   Swimmers/Leapers/Gliders These are incredibly rare, confirmed sightings number less than 20.   BeetleBack/Head Hunter These have made a come-back since the fall of the Beacon, BeetleBacks are more common then Head Hunters.  FrogSkin These are pretty common  This post details an encounter of a special city mutation, Warnik himself PM'ed me and Klein with the details of this zombie. They are found only in cities, extremely rare, but you should stay away from New York City.  Cars and trucks are common, but need a lot of fixing up, some large countries have refineries that produce gas (well, only one, New America) and then there is /u/PrudhoeBayOF who is manufacturing new and usable gasoline. Motorcycles and horses are the common means of travel.   I think /u/diabloknk and his nation are capable of making basic penicillin.

Askasurvivor,3e0ibb,twawaytrust,2,Tue Jul 21 03:05:03 2015 UTC,"Alts  Admittedly, none of them are subscribed to the subreddit though, so they wouldn't count towards the 1,000..."
Askasurvivor,3e0ibb,EndTimesRadio,2,Tue Jul 21 03:05:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, and I used to have like 18 too before I cut back, 1k is still a crazy number.  It's kinda funny that we only have maybe 25 active users though."
Askasurvivor,3e0ibb,BenjaminSankt,2,Tue Jul 21 03:06:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it definitely is. I honestly don't know how many writers/characters the sub could theoretically support before we sort of start confusing readers."
Askasurvivor,3e0ibb,Imightbeflirting,2,Tue Jul 21 03:07:27 2015 UTC,"I guess at some point you'd cross the threshold where people stopped caring about what was happening on the sub at large and stuck to just people in their area.

Askasurvivor,3e0ibb,BenjaminSankt,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:07:59 2015 UTC,"Or we could start branching to Europe or South America, or... so on and so forth. Granted, the original vision of this sub is sorta non-geographically centric, you can ask a question and it can be answered from anywhere."
Askasurvivor,3e0ibb,Imightbeflirting,2,Tue Jul 21 03:11:10 2015 UTC,The entire reason for this account is to be there for anyone who wants to do things in South or Central America.

Askasurvivor,3e0ibb,BenjaminSankt,2,Tue Jul 21 04:27:01 2015 UTC,Who are all the active users then? I thought we had way more than that.
Askasurvivor,3e0ibb,Sebastian_Aleshire,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:32:06 2015 UTC,"That was more a highball guess. There are 26 of us in the AAS OOC chat, but a total of like 15 (another highball) are active, with a few more like Immyownisland who may or may not be alts of someone else.  There's Tangent, whose alts were all just set up here.  Me, with like three characters now that I've cut down.  Spootin with all his, though he's out of commission for at least ten weeks.  Creathian and his ~4 alts.  Viking, who has one.  Jamie, who might not have any.  Those cowboy amish guys, who I'm pretty sure don't have any.  Oh, and the Wild Willie's guy.  That's all that I can think of for writers. There's probably a couple I'm missing though. Are you in the chat?  Edit: Also I_ruined_your_life, who has one alt, Beachbum, who has none, good ol' Greggy Hugan, who I'm not sure about, and Diablo, who has no alts. I missed a ton."

Askasurvivor,3e0ibb,twawaytrust,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:03:06 2015 UTC,"I like to think that I'm doing okay with not using Writer Knowledge to gain an upper hand. E.G., Princess got captured because Greg visited the hospital where Princess was already visiting Viking. Princess had no idea Greg was coming- but I did, and I only let made her aware, once Greg got there, rather than getting her out safely/beforehand, because she wasn't commenting or checking reddit with that account, because nobody tried engaging with her.)  Besides, many of the guys I posted with in the above field...many are shared (e.g., student accounts, church accounts, etc.,) or are dead characters (Pleasantvill, iunetanna, fdasfgas). I'll also point out, none of them are subbed to this- so while we do have fewer writers, hovering around 15-25, I think we also have far more readers/lurkers than we knew."

Askasurvivor,3dn27p,Sebastian_Aleshire,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:52:54 2015 UTC,Well that just happens to be my specialty. Are you looking more for guns or slaves to kill people with?
Askasurvivor,3dn27p,Imightbeflirting,2,Sat Jul 18 00:37:25 2015 UTC,I need more ammunition for sniper rifles and any poisons if you have any. Preferably unnoticeable and highly lethal.
Askasurvivor,3dn27p,MightbeaViking,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:28:17 2015 UTC,"What caliber?  The closest thing to poison I can get you is the sludge from our kitchens, I know that'll kill someone. Not sure how effective or unnoticeable it is though"
Askasurvivor,3dn27p,MightbeaViking,2,Sat Jul 18 21:29:05 2015 UTC,"OoC: to be honest I do t know much about guns so I don't know what caliber we would have so, you can decide what we have or just give us new ones entirely. Oh and we will pay for whatever you do give us.   I'm going to say no on the 'poison' for now but I may ask for it latter if I decide I want to torture someone."
Askasurvivor,3dn27p,MightbeaViking,2,Sat Jul 18 22:52:51 2015 UTC,"Ooc: Where did you get the rifles? If they're police/military rifles you're probably shooting .308 or 7.62x51.  Neat.

Askasurvivor,3dn27p,MightbeaViking,2,Sat Jul 18 23:41:19 2015 UTC,OoC: They are very high military grade ones so probably a mix of those two would make sense.
Askasurvivor,3dn27p,MightbeaViking,2,Sun Jul 19 01:03:45 2015 UTC,"OOC: What branch of military? The Marine Corps and Army standard rifles uses 7.62×51mm, though the M24A2 and 3 use .300 somethings. Not sure about the Navy, or if the Air Force/Coast Guard even have snipers. What exactly do you mean by very high military grade though? That might mean anti-material rifles firing big huge .50 BMGs and obliterating shit."

They were trying to recreate 1950's America in a zombie wasteland. There exists nowhere near the infrastructure necessary for such a society, and Pleasantville wasn't exactly training its inhabitants to build that infrastructure. And then on top of that they expended serious resources on trying to capture people like you, resources that they could ill afford to lose.  They would have imploded well before they could become a threat to the Free Republic. They were idealists (maybe they had a horrible ideal, but they were idealists nonetheless). and their utter lack of pragmatism would have destroyed them, probably within the next few years.  For all the shit I give you about not having morals and being too controllable, there is such a thing as going too far in the other direction.

Unfortunately they were also the exception to refugees being good about bringing food with them - few of them had any vehicles or pack animals, so they could only bring what they could carry.  We expect the food to last 3 weeks at best, even on short rations. That still leaves at least a week without food before we'd be able to resupply them. This is the best case scenario we have right now - it assumes that there are no snags, pitfalls, or other problems.

I mean, I wouldn't call a cow human, but I don't deny that it is able to feel pain.  What really sets humans apart from all other species on this planet (and the zombies) is our ability to strive for something, often an intangible something. Animals only concern themselves with eating, sleeping, and mating. Zombies are even more simple - they only look for things to eat (although I am not sure why they eat, it doesn't seem that they have working digestive systems).   Would I call you human, Salem? Yes, because there is something you are striving for -  love, although not necessarily in the romantic sense.   I find it strange that you look to Princess for guidance - she tries, at every turn, to make herself less human, to reduce herself to the basic survival instinct. If she ever succeeds fully, she will be nothing more than an animal in human form."

Askasurvivor,3cto7g,Sebastian_Aleshire,2,Tue Jul 14 05:38:27 2015 UTC,But which one is the most important?
Askasurvivor,3cto7g,Creathian,3,Sat Jul 11 01:19:05 2015 UTC,Both are equally. You lose if your king is taken but a queen is the most important piece.
Askasurvivor,3cto7g,diabloknk,3,Sat Jul 11 01:32:19 2015 UTC,"Fun Chess fact.  You manipulate a pawn across to the end of the board? It becomes a queen, who's soul purpose...is to serve the king.   You beat your queen, which is not something that happens to queens. Now, you took Viking because Princess is showing signs of weakness. Viking's just another pawn you're slowly going to bring across the board.  Meanwhile, you can't even fend off a medical camp. Thanks for Pleasentville, by the way. Great hunk-o land here."

We can't have that- they'd chop her up and sell her parts, and they'd use whatever they gain to bury us.  My apologies for violating your orders, but it seemed important, and the troops... they were catching an eyeful of her and I don't know how much we should trust them, so I brought her inside. She must be kept out of their hands, so while she went inside, I thought it was a bad idea to leave her unescorted- especially in a hospital, full of doctors who would give their lives just for a crack at her.

Askasurvivor,3cmbiu,KimJacob,2,Thu Jul 9 04:37:12 2015 UTC,"Aye, we got explosives. Effectively, it's dynamite- a better pusher for projectiles, better at putting someone to rippy bits and moving dirt than it is at actively destroying things, but we also have thermite for the other stuffs, if that's to your liking at all. Easily made, easily transported, and best of all, stable 'til suddenly it ain't.  We'll trade you Washington's medical bill, since you seem so eager to acquire the laddie, too.  Now, for yer part of the bargain:  We don't really need vehicles, per se, we're trying to get our methane capture running better and on a larger scale, and since we merged with Salazar, we've been doing alright there.  Food? Ha. Hampshire's got us covered nicely, and the farm fields of Smith are online. We even got tobacco!  Now, Beer you say? Real, actual beer?  AND LIKE THAT YOU HAVE MY ATTENTION. But in all seriousness, how about some weapons? Aye, the FCC's got the nicest rifles around, and we even got some artillery from the RRR/AMR, or whatever they're calling themselves, but we need more. Cannon, construction supplies, concrete, finished beams of wood. You know, the good stuff. A mind like yers doesn't come up with something as madcap as the zed wall, then ask for explosives without an eye for the future, now do it? We want first crack at least steep but large discount for whatever comes outta your lab that isn't used fer yerself.  We wants it, and we'll trade ye for it."

Easily made, easily transported, and best of all, stable 'til suddenly it ain't.   As for the dynamite - is it TNT or gunpowder based?   Thermite - yes, we could use thermite. Good for making AP rounds.   We'll trade you Washington's medical bill, since you seem so eager to acquire the laddie, too.   Washington is coming to us of his own accord, specifically because we can offer something closer to a retirement package than what the FCC is willing to give him. We do not consider that as part of our trade negotiation. Any deal FCC has with him is between you and him, our agreement with him is entirely separate.   we're trying to get our methane capture running better and on a larger scale   We have engineers who could help you triple or quadruple your methane capture, maybe even more. In return, we want 50% of all captured methane for the first year following completion of the upgrades, after which we will negotiate further with you. If you don't want our engineers to help you there, however, we are willing to trade for methane.   Now, Beer you say? Real, actual beer?   Yes, real beer. One of our residents was a brew master for Samuel Adams - he's running our plant. We mostly produce lagers and IPAs, although we are planning to expand to stouts and hefeweisens.   But in all seriousness, how about some weapons?   Currently, we do not have much weapon production. So I have nothing to trade right now on that front.   A mind like yers doesn't come up with something as madcap as the zed wall, then ask for explosives without an eye for the future, now do it? We want first crack at least steep but large discount for whatever comes outta your lab that isn't used fer yerself.   Well, yes. I've mentioned it before, but I was a weapons designer before the outbreak. And I'm not the only one here in the Free Republic - many of us came here from NYC, where we had been attending a conference.  What I am prepared to offer you is a licensing agreement. In exchange for methane, nitric acid, and/or high explosives, we will give you a 30% discount on all weapons produced. To give you an idea of what we plan to make:  Small Arms (ammunition sold separately):   Advanced rifles with caseless ammunition and multiple fire types (full auto, semi auto, and 3 round burst) and round types (regular, HE, AP). The advantages of caseless ammunition are that the bullets themselves are lighter (therefore your soldiers can carry more), and that the gun can automatically clear any jam. Furthermore, the 3 round burst mode can fire out all bullets BEFORE you feel the recoil. Advanced sniper rifles. Again, caseless ammunition. Semi-automatic. Accurate to 3000 yards. Multiple round types. Shoulder-Mounted Multi-Purpose Assault Weapon II. It is, essentially, a multi-round-type RPG. Unlike older versions, it can be fired indoors. Can use HEDP (anti fortification), HEAA (Armor piercing), and NE (thermobaric) rounds. Fragmentation grenades. Perfect for clearing out corridors.   Missiles (launch platforms to be sold separately):   Radar and laser guided missiles, with varying payloads. No nuclear, biological, or chemical warheads planned at this time. However, these will be VERY expensive.   Defenses:   Land mines, both anti-personnel and anti-tank to be available. Anti-personnel mines will be bounding. All mines will be controlled by both pressure plate and remote. Can be remotely set to dormant - in dormant mode, mines will not detonate under any circumstances. Mines will also communicate with your controller - you will be able to keep track of which mines are operational at all times.   Please note that this is not an exhaustive list."

Alright on the methane capture, but you have to find a way to transport it and do so without using our methane, and without adding cows- this would be the method of capturing.  Do 50% on the weapons and you have a deal.  I think we need the Shoulder-Mounted Multi-Purpose Assault Weapon II's. I likes my guns like I likes my swords: Big, tough, and gets the job done, no questions asked. We also want a discount on future productions in continuation of the trade. RRR owes us big for our construction projects, so they'll do the shipping.  Fragmentation grenades are lousy for killing undead, though, and we have plenty of those.  Landmines are already present in great abundance, we are okay with what we have."
Askasurvivor,3cmbiu,TelekineticHead,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:46:13 2015 UTC,"Gunpowder based. Why?   We're less interested in the actual dynamite than we are in the material.

Alright on the methane capture, but you have to find a way to transport it and do so without using our methane, and without adding cows- this would be the method of capturing.   We can transport it, and we don't have any cows to add. What we do have is more efficient capture equipment. Since we're doing this, we will NOT include methane under the weapons agreement, for the first year.   Do 50% on the weapons and you have a deal.   40%. Final offer.   I think we need the Shoulder-Mounted Multi-Purpose Assault Weapon II's.   Ok. We'll prioritize getting SMAW II's and ammunition available to you for purchase first, assuming this deal goes through.   We also want a discount on future productions in continuation of the trade.   You'll keep the discount as long as you provide us nitric acid, other nitrates, thermite, and/or high explosives (not gunpowder based). We'll set the agreement as follows:  1 year terms, with automatic renewals. At the start of a new term, either party can object to the continuation of the agreement, but they have to provide 30 days notice (e.g. - 30 days before each 1-year term is up, either party can state that they no longer intend to continue the agreement). In the event of default, either party has 30 days to cure, otherwise the agreement is voided."

Askasurvivor,3clcb5,Imightbeflirting,3,Wed Jul 8 20:20:08 2015 UTC,"A few of us in Free Republic had Reddit accounts back before the outbreak. After the initial outbreak, it was really a scramble to survive, so we lost most contact with the outside world. After that, we didn't even try to reestablish contact - the business of building our infrastructure and security took all precedence.  However, about 5 years ago we started scavenging for computer parts and radio antennas. Most of what we found early on was used to establish the first Zed Wall.   In time we found more and more, and eventually we were able to reconnect to the internet, as part of an initiative to reach out to the rest of the world, see if anybody was alive, that sort of thing. We found that basically nothing was up on the internet, except Reddit, specifically this sub.   What we also found was that the world was dominated by warlords and raiders. We had expected this, but what we hadn't expected was the sheer size of some of these groups. Groups like NA and 7SA were quite a bit larger than we expected. In an emergency meeting, the council decided to stay silent, and focus on improvements to our defenses.  That was 2 years ago. Since then the Zed Wall has come a long way. And 2 months ago, we decided to take a risk - we'd open up trade. We figured that we'd be discovered sooner or later by one of the larger groups, groups that we would rather not be a part of. Trade is vital for us to secure the means to protect ourselves from groups like the Empire, NA, and the former Mad Dog's Caravan. We can only hope that this was the correct decision, and that it was not made too late."

I'll make up for my earlier failures, I promise. I'll work my way back up until you call me your equal again. I'll prove to you that I'm worthy. Let me prove it for you.  I won't let a man escape, I'll be thorough this time, it won't be like it was at Pleasantville, I'll make you proud to have me as your hand. The walls will drop with blood. I'll make them rue the day they crossed you, us, and the people we care for."

Any one of us (except that bitch Tim) could take any one of you. I bet Ms. Ruth's kid is mine, she never made any of us wear a rubber."
Askasurvivor,3ce1aq,Smithcolstudentbody,3,Tue Jul 7 04:36:50 2015 UTC,"Hey fuck you buddy! Your food is being supplied by us we're not farming and doing all this agriculture for you to shit on us, I'll make sure your next food shipment is fucking poisoned by the time it gets there.   And don't you dare call Ms.Ruth shit like that, everyone in smith is either sterile or ugly as fuck to even be near someone like her, fucking assholes."
Askasurvivor,3ce1aq,Smithcolstudentbody,2,Tue Jul 7 04:50:58 2015 UTC,"Oh no, this new food source that we've never had to rely on before is threatening us, whatever will we do? If you're so focused on food why don't you eat some dicks?  I didn't call Ms Ruth shit, I only implied that she was a slut and a whore. If we're really all as ugly as you say doesn't that make it worse that she let us all run train on her ass?"
Askasurvivor,3ce1aq,Smithcolstudentbody,3,Tue Jul 7 04:55:31 2015 UTC,"My friends, this is a simpleton trying to get into your heads.   See, these people were conditioned to be psychotic killers, somewhat similar to their original creator, Ms.Princess Beckers, understand this please.   They use a simple Ad Hoc rationalization, they make a statement with no evidence or proof whatsoever.   They also add the Ad Feminam fallacy as well, trying to change the subject by adding false traits in our lovely Ms.Ruth, who's never for a second been an unfaithful human being.   You see, these students are just clones of Ms.Beckers, there is no difference between them and her, and it's a damn shame that they themselves have no form of individuality, leave them be and they shall go back to-- ahem ""circlejekring"" and hating others, they were raised to be hateful beings with no such thing as the freedom of choice.   You children were given that choice, leave them be."

Askasurvivor,3ce1aq,Smithcolstudentbody,3,Tue Jul 7 05:04:41 2015 UTC,"We don't hate all others. Well some of us do but I don't. I just hate whiny little bitches like your student who can't take a little good natured ribbing. Hey look. A difference between myself and some of the other students, almost like we're individuals.  You know, I can spew out random fallacies as well. You've got a simple ad hominem, a couple appeals to consequence of a belief, with some gambler's fallacy and begging the question to boot. Maybe support your argument before assigning random fallacies with little to no support.  I'd counter your claim of an ad hoc rationalization but it seems to be one itself. Funny, huh? Maybe you mean the statement that Ruth's kid could be mine. Have you not seen the massive belly? Is that not enough evidence for you? Maybe when it comes out with my nose and my hair that'll be enough for you. God but that stomach was tight before that, same with the rest of her before we got there, but that's besides the point.  I think you mean ad hominem rather than ad feminam because ad feminam isn't a real thing. I've said nothing about her, only that I'm the father of that child after we all ran some train, and that I'd implied a few other things. For an ad hominem you need to be using these claims to disquality that person's claim, however, the only claim here is mine, Ruth's said nothing I'm attempting to disprove.  So basically eat a dick Smith #1 at football, killing, and debating."

Already it has provided to us four protectorate states from which to draw resources and recruits. Every day it weeds out the weak, the unfaithful, and keeps the claws and teeth of our enemy from our throats. Should you ever wish to drop your shield and pick up mine, you could live a good life as an Attendant, perhaps even ascend to the rank of Knight. You could even become Champion when I fall if you do well enough.  I don't fight true, I fight faithfully. All other accomplishments are from His Will and His Will alone."

I don't appreciate the implication that I'm anything like your ex, and that my passions are anything to be concerned with.  June, despite being your twin, seems to be displaying far better judgment and sociable grace. How you ever decided to be a reporter is beyond me, and that you've made it this far speaks more to the simplicity of your average interviewee than it does any talent on your behalf. She's a wonderful girl, possessed of a fine & delicate sense for the finer things in life.  I don't kill because I have to, so don't compare me to that little schizo you're so fond of. Speaking of, I'll tell you some things about her: That girl was a headache and a nuisance at the best of times. In need of constant defending from the people around her, always coming crawling back from scouting excursions empty-handed except for a bag full of excuses, like ""a small bunch of them popped up."" Here's a quick piece of advice for you: Deep down inside, on her basest level, she feels nothing- no pleasure, no pain, nothing. She might slap some makeup on a void and paint a picture of a smile, but that doesn't make it the real thing. /u/Spootinlaza 's hopefully done her the favor of stripping the paint down to reveal some of what's underneath.

We only prohibit them from our community because many of our potential immigrants were affected.   I just need a kill - once every few days...   We are not willing to provide people for you to kill as some sort of blood sacrifice. Nor are we at war with anybody.   I'm not aiming to be a citizen of your country.   I don't see why you would. You're in a leadership position in Spootin's army. I don't see why you would leave that to do farm work."

Askasurvivor,3bp9kc,twawaytrust,3,Wed Jul 1 19:27:10 2015 UTC,"No need to get all snippy about it. I get that it's not pleasant to be told that you're not wanted to be part of something, but certainly you can understand why you're such a huge security risk, right?  You have a need to kill, otherwise you go on a rampage. Do you realize the difficulty there would be in even procuring you a zombie for you every several days, especially considering that we intentionally gather the zombies into hordes and use them to form a wall around us? Breaking just one or even several off every few days isn't really feasible. And we can't just let you go off to fight zombies at the wall - if we're lucky, you'll just die there, if we're unlucky, they'll follow you back to the settlement. And this isn't even the biggest issue we would have with letting you live among us.  The biggest issue is that you are extremely impressionable, and in fact you don't seem to have much of a will of your own. Just two months ago, you were the leader of FCC Smith. Then you had that nasty business with Greg Hugan and Spootin, and you walked away from it as one of Spootin's subordinates! Just before that incident, you heavily distrusted and hated Spootin - and in the span of one day you completely and utterly changed your opinion of the man and became his ""left hand.""  I mean, seriously, it's one thing to be flexible and be willing to change your mind and views. It's another thing to be able to do a complete 180 in the span of one day! And it's not like you did that yourself - all that needed to be done was to present some (shoddy, questionable) ""evidence"" that those you trusted were using you, and you immediately cut ties with those people and started following the next person to come along who was willing to tell you what to do, even if that person was your sworn enemy up until that point!  The reality is that you are a puppet! You do not do anything of your own accord, you always follow what others tell you to do, as long as they provide some sort of flimsy justification.  Hell, the fact that you basically feel nothing renders you even more like a puppet, because they feel nothing either, they just dance along the strings like you have been doing!  Can you see why we would consider that a security risk? You would be willing to betray us at the drop of a hat. No promise you could make us would be convincing, because fundamentally you are a puppet, and we don't care to pull your strings."
Askasurvivor,3bp9kc,twawaytrust,2,Wed Jul 1 20:23:37 2015 UTC,"It was three days. Three whole days Greg had me to himself. He almost killed me. Spootin got me out of there as fast as he could. And the evidence was... Okay so it was a mixed bag, but so what?  Some of it was right. And since then, he's been right- we saved Salem, we warned everyone about Pleasantville. He killed Doc Martens, he got the Voice back out...  He made me whole again. He pieces me together after everyone who betrayed me shattered me into pieces. Don't insult him by calling him a... Whatever you're getting at! He saved me. No one seems to remember that. I'm not his subordinate he says I'm his equal.   I saved Salem, I chose to. I didn't have to kill those construction corps students either, I chose to. I can make decisions, like who to hire at FCC Smith."
Askasurvivor,3bp9kc,twawaytrust,2,Wed Jul 1 23:32:06 2015 UTC,"It was three days.   Ok, my bad. I could have sworn it was about a day. Doesn't really change much. Doing a complete 180 over the course of three days isn't really much better than doing it in one.   Three whole days Greg had me to himself. He almost killed me. Spootin got me out of there as fast he could.   Remind me again, who captured you? Oh, right, people who were planning to sell you to Spootin. Remember?  Greg only got you when he killed those guys. Also, you might want to check out the posts where Spootin made a deal with Greg:  Initial Proposal.  Spootin mentioning some of the terms of the deal, including the bit where Greg ""gets to have his fun."" I remember that the only reason he was angry was because he thought Greg killed you. He was totally okay with Greg torturing you, as long as you were left more or less alive.   And the evidence was... Okay so it was a mixed bag, but so what? Some of it was right.   Much of it was wrong as well. And easily made up by people who have both the means and interest in doing so. And Spootin definitely had both of those.   And since then, he's been right- we saved Salem, we warned everyone about Pleasantville.   He also raped Kathy for no reason other than the fact that he didn't like her and he destroys entire settlements for the smallest slight, intended or not. And he likes destroying them so much that it is remarkable when he doesn't kill everybody.   He killed Doc Martens   And you think that's a good thing? Doc Martens was a doctor, a valuable sort in these times, and he wasn't really an enemy to you and Spootin.   he got the Voice back out...   Again, you think that's a good thing? The Voice is nothing more than your current tendencies taken to their natural conclusions - as long as you can convince the Voice that taking an action will help it/you survive, it will do it, even if you're lying. The Voice is very logical, in a way, but it is a terrible judge of character. The Voice is the ultimate puppet, easily controlled and absolutely emotionless!   He made me whole again. He pieced me together after everyone who betrayed me shattered me into pieces.   Your evidence of everybody's ""betrayal"" comes from a suspect source, who we've already established had the means and knowledge to forge evidence.   Hell, does this look like betrayal to you? Everybody from FCC Smith was trying to find you! You know why? To rescue you from Greg. Spootin got to you first, and that's only because he made a deal with Greg, so he already knew where you were!   Don't insult him by calling him a... Whatever you're getting at!   I'm not calling Spootin anything he doesn't readily admit to. And again, I find it striking how quickly you come to his defense when two months ago you would have tried to kill him on sight.   He saved me.   From a situation that he put you in. Remember, those guys who initially captured you were working for Spootin. Greg may very well have not been able to capture you if not for them. And he captured you with Spootin's blessing.   I'm not his subordinate he says I'm his equal.   And yet you're called ""The Left Hand of Spootin."" You're not even his right hand, and the right hand person isn't the equal of somebody, their that person's top subordinate! Face it, you're his subordinate. What's more, you're not even his top subordinate. To Spootin, you're second best.   I saved Salem   At Spootin's suggestion, as you implied earlier.   I didn't have to kill those construction corps students either   Right after Spootin told you that everybody at FCC Smith had betrayed you.   I can make decisions, like who to hire at FCC Smith.   As far as I can tell, Pearl runs FCC Smith now. Not you."

I'd like to retire in a place like this. I worry what will happen when Smith decides the old dog's too long in the tooth to bite.

As for retirement, it depends on what you mean by that.  We are not in a position to start offering the sort of retirements that people enjoyed before the outbreak. There is simply too much work to do, and we need everybody who is able to work to do so.  What we can and do offer you is the following:   Medical care for any injury and/or illness that you may suffer. This will be provided, free of charge, until you either recover or die. In the event that an injury or illness arises that prevents you from doing your current work, we can transfer you to a less strenuous position. Paperwork might not be the most exciting work, but somebody needs to do it, and you don't need to stand or have particularly good eyesight to do it. In the event that an injury or illness arises that prevents you from being able to even do paperwork, we will not require you to work (and will provide you food and other care) until you can either recover to the point that you can return to work or die."

I'm a bit tired, so I'll try to keep this quick:   I'm willing to house and feed, I can give tons of supplies if you ever need to siege, and anything else... I can't give yet.   We only have a small defense force of 50 soldiers and 50 volunteers, they guard the entire Holyoke since we're not a military college or any conquerors, we are nourishers and providers, we farm and we make food for any of the allies for the FCC (That means Smith and Hamphsire as well, including you, friend.)  Our population is at 500 students , we have a good relationship with Smith as well since I was a former teacher there, if you wish I can provide your people jobs as teachers and builders for anti sieging weapons and such, supplies and such should not be a problem.

I'm not going to use it, mind you, due to travel time...but it's there.  So, what is Spootin going to do here?

I know you're local, now.  /u/telekinetichead , I don't trust you. I don't think you're a good person. And frankly, I don't think there's many places I'd consider 'safe' for you in this army, so I'm going to stick you with /u/crethian's forces, since you probably pissed them off less than FCC Smith's forces. Jameson can jump off the ship- first into the inner ring, sliding down the rope.  If what /u/Beachbum313 said is correct, then perhaps /u/wild-tangent's 'Fuck You Cannon' can be used to distract, as a feint. We'll land the cannon on the far side of our offensive. /u/ionianvalues, you will hold there against any offensive action they take and protect the cannon, with Greg there to lead a small scouting detachment, (unless you really want to take your chances that Jack might see you and behead you on the spot.)  Beachbum will cut tethers from the gun emplacement before it fires, and pick up FCC Smith troops, Andrej, Kathy, /u/I_ruined_your_life and the others, then land them atop the wall on the other side, away from where the cannon is attacking, so that their troops are split. The construction corps will set about getting a lift system for the rest of New Michigan's forces at the wall's bottom so they can climb up and reinforce. Hopefully splitting their forces will weaken whatever response they give. Beachbum will provide air and artillery support.  Mortar teams will then shell the inside if there's any resistance from inside. I'm not sure what your stance is on the civilians inside- some of them, perhaps all of them, are brainwashed, they may be innocent in all this. Or not. I'm no stranger to war, so I know what happens when one side loses to another.  Just try to get Psycho, June, Phyllis, and Sheila out of there, plus anyone else we recognize. Maybe separate out the brainwashed and missing survivors from the culprits, something I can leave to Frank Delele /u/survivor_radio, covered by /u/smokeysmokes who will help the teams disembark from the airship.

What am I, then, am I Future Subject Epsilon?  Maybe it's coincidence.  She's not talking. At all. We can't even get a word out of her. I don't want to call in a therapist to FCC territory, though, and it's unsafe to travel unless in a large pack. Do you have any ideas?

We are now reforming many of them, and producing more valuable, contributing members of society than ever. Acquisitions has kept us very busy.
