IAmA,3e2e9w,Cheesebeard1025,53,Tue Jul 21 12:52:14 2015 UTC,Pretty slow is better than fast. My friends and I did it in 3 months and 12 days and missed a lot of cool things. I am planning on going back with my wife and taking our time.   Have you left some trail magic?   What has been your favorite shelter so far?
IAmA,3e2e9w,FightForGlory,38,Tue Jul 21 14:51:05 2015 UTC,Congrats that's really fast! I haven't left any but I fully intend on doing some next year. The amount of kindness I have been shown by trail angels is unbelievable. I don't know what I'm going to do for trail magic but it's going to involve beer in some manner. Favorite shelter so far would be 501 shelter for sure. Or camerrer fire tower in the smokies if that counts.
IAmA,3e2e9w,zebra-fart,27,Tue Jul 21 14:57:21 2015 UTC,Can you explain what trail magic is?
IAmA,3e2e9w,FightForGlory,66,Tue Jul 21 15:34:56 2015 UTC,Sorry didn't see your question. Yeah trail magic where someone helps out hikers in some manner. It can be as simple as leaving a jug of fresh water by a road to extravagant as cooking a huge meal for all the hikers by a road or shelter. It's really amazing how often it happens and the kindness of people out there.
IAmA,3e2e9w,dazzlerdeej,15,Tue Jul 21 16:01:06 2015 UTC,"Yea everyday we would measure out our ibuprofen and keep going lol. I think we had one zero day throughout it because of a tornado warning. Hell yea for 501 :)  Got another question, what are you using to do this AMA?"
IAmA,3e2e9w,-KhmerBear-,25,Tue Jul 21 15:03:36 2015 UTC,Good old vitamin i. Good reason for a 0. We camped 5 miles from a tornado in pa. Scary shit. My phone. Galaxy s5
IAmA,3e2e9w,plzsendhalp,77,Tue Jul 21 15:09:40 2015 UTC,"I'm a huge fan of travel writer Bill Bryson, and loved his tale of hiking the AT, A Walk in the Woods. However, I understand many thru-hikers are upset at the book. I wondered if you could explain why that is, and what your views are on the book and upcoming movie adaptation?"
IAmA,3e2e9w,PossiblyNameless,103,Tue Jul 21 13:50:35 2015 UTC,For sure. So I haven't actually finished the book. I've read up to the point where they have started the trail and his friend throws all their food off of springer. The main reason I think people are upset with the book is the fact that it's the biggest a.t book out there and he didn't even finish the trail. People are also upset with it because it brings in a lot of people on the trail who don't know what they're doing and get themselves in trouble. The a.t is already the most popular trail in the world and already there are crowding issues with the start. Around 7000 people started last year and only like 470 finished. With the release of a big Hollywood movie about the a.t being released there will probably be a huge influx of ill prepared people. Baxter state park is already considering kicking the a.t out and moving the norther terminus out of katahdin. So really I just think people are nervous that the movie will be a catalyst for this and bring a lot of people who have no idea what they're doing to the trail.
IAmA,3e2e9w,bg-j38,182,Tue Jul 21 13:59:31 2015 UTC,So I haven't actually finished the book.   This is the perfect tribute to Bryson's through hike.
IAmA,3e2e9w,mudclog,99,Tue Jul 21 16:49:54 2015 UTC,"The AT kind of IS the place to go when you don't know what you're doing.  It's heavily traveled, there's plenty of water, shelters, towns to restock.    It's the perfect place for the wannabe to learn a thing or two.  If you can't start there, where can you start?  Have you heard of Andrew Skurka?  He's a famous ultralight hiker who's covered 10s of thousands of miles on foot.    He started with the AT, made just about every rookie mistake you can make, and then he learned along the way, like most of us do.    If you don't want the congestion, if you don't want the new hikers, there are countless other trails available that provide amazing, gorgeous adventures.  Why anyone would get snobby about new people on the AT is just  bizarre."
IAmA,3e2e9w,Seattleopolis,41,Tue Jul 21 17:10:37 2015 UTC,"There's a difference between rookies (totally okay) and people who don't understand the basics of ""leave no trace"" / ""pack it in - pack it out"" (not okay)."
IAmA,3e2e9w,lostmylizard,7,Tue Jul 21 17:36:38 2015 UTC,There's also just idiots. There's a 10 mile hike into some hot springs near where I live. It's not a terrible hike but a lot of elevation changes and highly recommended that you pack in and stay a night. I'm a pretty experienced hiker and backpacker and I still consider it kinda tough. I've seen a lot of people who have no idea what they're doing attempt that hike. The first one that comes to mind was the guy carrying a plastic bag with some food and clothes in one hand and a gallon jug of water in the other. No pack or anything. I have no idea how far he made it but I didn't see him in any of the camping areas that weekend.
IAmA,3e2e9w,cara0910,7,Tue Jul 21 18:09:24 2015 UTC,"I'm really surprised about the ""leave no trace"" thing and how its a problem. I guess I was just brought up that way by my parents - any time we went camping, hiking, or even just to parks, we never left any garbage unless there was a garbage can to throw it in. It's as simple as ""don't litter"", and it's really not very difficult at all."
IAmA,3e2e9w,IsThisItThisTime,4,Tue Jul 21 18:14:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's not the PCT."
IAmA,3e2e9w,SoMuchMoreEagle,40,Tue Jul 21 17:26:01 2015 UTC,"Our friend who completed the AT said her biggest objection was that Bryson didn't emphasize trail ethics, such as leave no trace, pack it in/pack it out, etc. She recommended ""AWOL on the Appalachian Trail"" by David Miller as a better introduction. (I've only read the Bryson book, myself.)"
IAmA,3e2e9w,groggyMPLS,7,Tue Jul 21 14:33:35 2015 UTC,"I've read both. Bryson is a hilarious and awesome writer. AWOL was great, too, but they're different books and they're both great in their own ways. It would be a shame if the trail gets overrun, though. You can always do the PCT instead."
IAmA,3e2e9w,bkgxltcz,7,Tue Jul 21 17:30:36 2015 UTC,I've never read bryson's but can second the recommendation for AWOL.
IAmA,3e2e9w,JustaPoodle,3,Tue Jul 21 17:26:08 2015 UTC,"To be fair, Bryson's book was not a guidebook.  It's a travelog, a story.  Just like any of his other travel books, it can certainly inspire, but it's not meant to instruct.     And the basic ""clean up after yourself"" lesson should have been taken care of in kindergarten. If they didn't learn it then, I doubt a book is going to make that much difference."
IAmA,3e2e9w,ignayshus,22,Tue Jul 21 18:27:38 2015 UTC,"In other words, A Walk in the Woods is to the Appalachian Trail what Cheryl Strayed's Wild is to the Pacific Crest Trail..."
IAmA,3e2e9w,rickyharline,8,Tue Jul 21 16:42:19 2015 UTC,"I think it's the other way around since Walk was published 14 years earlier.  I find Bryson amusing and entertaining, I've enjoyed all his books. Does Wild have that same vibe? Because the movie was super  chick flicky"
IAmA,3e2e9w,thitmeo,8,Tue Jul 21 17:03:45 2015 UTC,"The book is completely different. I read it before seeing the film and - predictably - was very disappointed. There's a huge amount of emotion in the book that would be nigh on impossible to put across in the film.   Tbh, I'm surprised that anyone would consider either book as any kind of 'must read before hike', let alone an introduction to the trails. I've done neither, but surely it's like me reading 'Two Hours: The Quest to Run the Impossible Marathon' and then thinking I can run a marathon. They're not meant as guides - especially the Bill Bryson one! Both are personal experiences - not in any way presented as guides."
IAmA,3e2e9w,SoMuchMoreEagle,3,Tue Jul 21 17:32:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but you can't just do the PCT. Weight, water, food, and shelter are huge concerns that you have to carefully plan for on the PCT. Also if you're on the PCT, you're probably not going to see anyone, so if things go sideways on you, you should also have some way of reaching civilization.  Wild isn't going to affect the PCT much, because it's abundantly clear with one google search that you can't just wing the PCT."
IAmA,3e2e9w,Relgappo,5,Tue Jul 21 18:13:37 2015 UTC,"I've really never understood this frustration with the book, though. Surely the book is a warning not to go if under prepared?"
IAmA,3e2e9w,BeastroMath,3,Tue Jul 21 17:09:12 2015 UTC,"I'm OK with the book, and Bryson in general.  Why some people don't like it, from what I gather, is that he and Katz give up out of laziness, rather than hardship or incompetence.  They skip a huge portion and get a taxicab!  Also, not all readers are cut out for Bryson's side-tracks into science, history, and ""I'm so British now"" segments."

IAmA,3e2e9w,wieschie,17,Tue Jul 21 13:01:18 2015 UTC,"What do you mean by ""taken a lot of 0s?"""
IAmA,3e2e9w,LifeByTheHornss,41,Tue Jul 21 13:29:01 2015 UTC,0 days are days spent doing nothing. Like laying around in a hotel or something like that. They tend to be expensive since you're not making miles and you're eating in town.
IAmA,3e2e9w,instamemer,20,Tue Jul 21 13:30:11 2015 UTC,"It's not exactly cheap to eat on the trail either. I haven't done much hiking lately, but I've seen the prices of dehydrated food at stores.    Actually, I should put that in the form of a question: ""What's your typical daily diet like while hiking, and how much do you spend for an average days food?"""

I don't like the rest of the website very much but these recipes are pretty similar to ones I have made.  There's a fairly active subreddit at /r/WildernessBackpacking, but I haven't frequented it much so I don't know how useful it'd be for meal ideas."
IAmA,3e2e9w,highfiveman27,2,Tue Jul 21 17:34:57 2015 UTC,"I can see ""don't spoil, easy to cook, and tasty enough,"" but lightweight? that is a huge issue and the big advantage of freeze dried food. It's also a very important consideration when you have to  carry everything you eat, in addition to very heavy water. What is as tasty and as light? I'm thinking of section hiking the AT in the near future, so I am very interested in light food."
IAmA,3e2e9w,flogmorton,5,Tue Jul 21 17:21:50 2015 UTC,I wonder if you could invest in a dehydrator and a food saver and slowly make dehydrated meals over 6 months to a year to split the costs.
IAmA,3e2e9w,fish60,3,Tue Jul 21 16:51:08 2015 UTC,You totally could. Many people wouldn't bother and just pay the price.
IAmA,3e2e9w,Dizzy_Panda,5,Tue Jul 21 17:06:03 2015 UTC,Those dehydrated food packs are really just a luxury. There are lots of alternatives which are just as tasty for 1/10 the cost (and similar weight/prep).

You haven't worked yet, you don't have a career to abandon. Being in a career can be really awesome -- and yes, it's true that if you're in a career for a long time, you may be unhappy. But that's when you go hike the AT. I think you're missing out and potentially doing future-you a disservice by blowing off the whole career thing. The financial independence aspect can be really satisfying, and if anything, working for a few years and making my own money has really helped me assert myself as an adult. Now when I think of taking time off to travel or hike the AT, I feel more purposeful, you know? But that is just my $0.02"

Yeah one night while we were in n.j (which is notorious for bears) a bear climbed the tree our bear bag was hanging from and was able to lean out and swat the group of bags. It successfully ripped open my friend click's bear bag and was eating all his food when we finally realized and chased it away.   So a little different experience from other thru hikers: we are all a bunch of marvel nerds, so naturally we had to go and see the new avengers. So we get into this tiny town called pearisburg va which is like 20 miles from blacksburg va, that has a movie theater, and we can't figure out a ride. All the shuttle services were busy that day. So after a long while of brain storming we realize we can rent a car in town for aost the same price as a shuttle. So we rent a dodge avenger and went to see the avengers in blacksburg. Twice.   But crazy stories on trail not too much. You get the usual crazies and animal encounters. One night we camped through a huge thunderstorm that had tornadoes less than 5 miles away."

IAmA,3e2e9w,ri_hid,9,Tue Jul 21 17:06:42 2015 UTC,Did you meet Dizzy? He's my brother in law and he started at the same time you did. He's only a week or so from Katahdin now though - he moved fast.
IAmA,3e2e9w,ri_hid,9,Tue Jul 21 15:27:37 2015 UTC,Sick! congrats to him! The name isn't familiar but it's possible he didn't have a trail name when I would have been around him. Is he hiking in a group? If so what's the groups name?
IAmA,3e2e9w,sleeppeaceably,5,Tue Jul 21 15:42:23 2015 UTC,No group as far as I know.  Good luck with the rest of your hike - it's an awesome achievement!
IAmA,3e2e9w,Aaron215,8,Tue Jul 21 15:49:54 2015 UTC,"I live near Hanover, NH and Woodstock, VT, which both have sections of the AT. What could I do that would make a hiker's day (aside from offering rides into town in Woodstock)?"
IAmA,3e2e9w,waiyan13,11,Tue Jul 21 16:16:01 2015 UTC,Rides is always awesome! Hitchhiking can be hard.  But beer and food is always a favorite of hikers at road sides. A place to crash is also primo trail magic!
IAmA,3e2e9w,wigglefish,6,Tue Jul 21 16:20:52 2015 UTC,Cool. Message me if you need anything in the mid NH-mid VT region!
IAmA,3e2e9w,digital_excess,9,Tue Jul 21 17:12:01 2015 UTC,"How does a trail name happen? do other trail users give it to you, or is it something you come up with?"
IAmA,3e2e9w,nebulouscloud,10,Tue Jul 21 16:47:45 2015 UTC,Can be either. Usually it's something you do and someone gives it to you. Lots of people think it's ch eating if you name yourself
IAmA,3e2e9w,Stendecca,2,Tue Jul 21 17:05:55 2015 UTC,"""They call me tater salad"""
IAmA,3e2e9w,oursaviorjoe,8,Tue Jul 21 18:15:13 2015 UTC,"Hey man, hope your hike is going well. Wanted to know your thoughts on through hiking vs section hiking? Me and my father have done sections of the a.t over the two years or so, but are crazy busy with work, and also really enjoy the solidarity of hiking parts of the trail when the through hikers are mostly gone. We usually do two weeks at a time with one or two 0 days. Thoughts?"
IAmA,3e2e9w,oursaviorjoe,8,Tue Jul 21 15:32:22 2015 UTC,Section hiking definitely has its advantages and disadvantages in my opinion. I think it's physically harder since as soon as you start getting your trail legs you have to get off trail. But you can choose when to do each section so you can choose to go during better weather. Personally I like hiking in the fall best so I think it would be super rad to see a lot of the views we get but with all the leaves changing. You also get to avoid the main bubble as well which is super nice. But if you do a through hike the right way the bubble isnt so bad and can be fun to be so immersed in hiker culture. I also think that a section is way more money just because of traveling up and down the east coast for it. I prefer thru only because I like the idea of doing it all in one go and getting to stay out here for such an extended period. But I don't think section is anything to be frowned upon. I have a few friends who section hike and they're all badass.
IAmA,3e2e9w,NotSure098475029,3,Tue Jul 21 15:40:35 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the thoughtful response. Most through hikers I have talked to about it have been slightly snobbish, but when we do section hike in the fall it's incredible. We hiked over blood mountain in the fall on our first trip and it was so gorgeous. Anyways man, best of luck!"
IAmA,3e2e9w,helpimstuckinct,2,Tue Jul 21 15:57:13 2015 UTC,"I have heard that there can be some animosity toward section hikers on the grounds that they are ""cheating"" or being wimpy.  Have you observed that?  Personally, that's the only way I'd be able to manage it due to work.  I've been thinking about the AT for around 5 years now."
IAmA,3e2e9w,helpimstuckinct,2,Tue Jul 21 16:45:52 2015 UTC,You also get to avoid the main bubble as well which is super nice.    Could you explain what you mean by the bubble?
IAmA,3e2e9w,MikeMaloy,2,Tue Jul 21 18:14:51 2015 UTC,"Most people on the trail start alone but around the same date so there will be groups ""bubbles"" that are hikers traveling at about the same rate in the same area but aren't officially together. Any choke-points that show people down such as towns or Trail-Days can cause a lot of congestion. There are days that you can camp alone and others where 12 people are already set up and you have to find another spot."
IAmA,3e2e9w,dcHurst,6,Tue Jul 21 18:34:50 2015 UTC,I'm right near GB. Need anything?
IAmA,3e2e9w,yosemitetrailblazer,4,Tue Jul 21 16:41:42 2015 UTC,Thank you so much! I think we are good but if something comes up I will definitely hit you up. Thanks!
IAmA,3e2e9w,SparkyDogPants,5,Tue Jul 21 16:54:33 2015 UTC,"Hey, I just finished hiking part of Massachussetts! :) Hope you enjoy Upper Goose Pond if you go teeheehee!  I want to thru-hike it next year but I'd have to go SOBO... do you usually hang out with the same people at shelters or is the social aspect more meeting cool people for a couple weeks then moving on? I just don't want to miss out on the NOBO bonding! </3"
IAmA,3e2e9w,Breadgunk,3,Tue Jul 21 16:54:30 2015 UTC,I hike in a group of 4 and usually we hang out with a few people for a few days then they move on or we do. But I bump into people sometimes that I haven't seen since springer which is incredible. Sobo I think could be cool for the fall aspect but honestly I think springer would be such an anticlimactic finish comparitively that I would highly suggest nobo. Plus more trail magic!
IAmA,3e2e9w,shooshx,2,Tue Jul 21 16:57:44 2015 UTC,What are SOBO and NOBO?
IAmA,3e2e9w,gayrudeboys,7,Tue Jul 21 17:48:43 2015 UTC,are you fucking anyone on the trail?
IAmA,3e2e9w,MutthaFuzza,6,Tue Jul 21 16:15:53 2015 UTC,"I wish. There weren't many girls starting when I did and by the time later starters caught up to me people had already hooked up. Lots of people pink blaze though. Another reason for a lot of dropouts. If you wanted to do the trail and just hook up, start in april"
IAmA,3e2e9w,maxg1,4,Tue Jul 21 16:18:53 2015 UTC,"pink blaze?  and my primary reason for doing is just to do it and basically build a stronger foundation because ya know, people are meant to travel long distances and elevation changes would really help as well, but finding someone else while there would be pretty cool. I plan on starting next year after I finish up this little chapter in my life."
IAmA,3e2e9w,gayrudeboys,5,Tue Jul 21 16:20:14 2015 UTC,Slowing down or speeding up miles to hook up or be in a trail relationship. Pretty much basing your decisions on hooking up.
IAmA,3e2e9w,skibumwannabe,3,Tue Jul 21 16:21:51 2015 UTC,How are you aware where people are?
IAmA,3e2e9w,WilliamMelvinHicks,8,Tue Jul 21 16:22:26 2015 UTC,Word travels on the trail. I keep in touch with people who are further ahead. There are also journals at the shelters where you can leave messages for people. You can also send word with south bounders. I had a message travel 200 miles south to me with a south bound section hiker which was pretty awesome
IAmA,3e2e9w,MakerGrey,3,Tue Jul 21 16:31:55 2015 UTC,"Do it man! I had similar thoughts, it just didn't happen to me. Or at least not yet. But it does happen for lots of people."
IAmA,3e2e9w,palebluedott,3,Tue Jul 21 16:23:22 2015 UTC,What books are you currently reading on your journey?   And how are the people that you have met during the trip? Has they been receptive to you? Any crazy encounters with the people?
IAmA,3e2e9w,Martinda1,12,Tue Jul 21 13:58:49 2015 UTC,I am rereading all of the harry potters right now and  currently on number 6. I also listen to audio books while hiking and actually get an audible credit today! Yay! Almost everyone has been amazing on the trail. I have only come across a few assholes. I've bumped into a couple of crazies on the trail. There's a guy hiking right now (shall remain nameless) who is known to openly masterbate in shelters. I also met a guy who just got arrested for embezzling 9 million from coca cola and may have murdered his wife. He thru Hiked 4 years in a row. His name was Bismarck. Look it up crazy story. Saw him on his last day of freedom in damascus va on trail days
IAmA,3e2e9w,Martinda1,3,Tue Jul 21 14:07:20 2015 UTC,"Whoa, that is some crazies you met! The Coca-Cola is really something.   OP, what do you plan to do after you finish your trail?   Do you keep a log? Would you write about your experience? Or maybe blog about it?"
IAmA,3e2e9w,Dlockett,5,Tue Jul 21 14:20:48 2015 UTC,I'm planning on working for a bit. Taking my emt classes maybe do that for a bit. Might try to get a seasonal field biologist technician job. But yeah I'm just going to eother go back to wor or go live at the red river gorge climbing for a few weeks or months.  I'm planning on doing a big several month backpacking tour of Europe and then going to Nepal to do the annapurna circuit next August. I don't keep a log or blog. I started an instagram account last night though so I plan on keeping up on that and posting pics from this adventure plus my future adventures.
IAmA,3e2e9w,fightlinker,4,Tue Jul 21 14:39:05 2015 UTC,Whats your instagram?
IAmA,3e2e9w,micmea1,3,Tue Jul 21 16:47:05 2015 UTC,"Here's the link to the Bismarck story, for those interested: http://appalachiantrials.com/at-thru-hiker-bismarck-arrested-at-trail-days-on-embezzling-charges/"
IAmA,3e2e9w,micmea1,4,Tue Jul 21 16:51:42 2015 UTC,"Do's and Don'ts for those planning for long trail hike?  Did you get inspirations from movies like ""Into the Wild"" and ""Wild""?  Any suggestions for weekend backpack hikes you had enjoyed in the past?"
IAmA,3e2e9w,dreamboat96,5,Tue Jul 21 14:08:09 2015 UTC,Hmmmm. Long distance is all dependent on which trail. But I would say make sure to have a guidebook or maps and make sure you know water sources for the day or make sure you carry enough water. Nothing sucks more than going a few miles without water. Really test out all your gear before attempting a long distance hike. Then you'll know more of what you will actually need and not have too much gear. The biggest mistake people make is carrying too much at first. Ounces add up fast.   Yeah into the wild is one of my favorite books it had a huge influence on my life. I haven't seen or read  wild yet.   It all depends on where you are in the country. But Linville gorge profile trail is incredible in nc. All of the grayson highlands are breathtaking in southern va tons of trails through there and berry season is rad there with tons of huckleberries. The a.t from Albert mountain fire tower outside of Franklin nc to like 40 miles from there would be incredible especially in fall lots of fire towers. Art Loeb trail in nc is sick. And my favorite hike ever was in glacier absolutely unreal check out the granite park chalet there

IAmA,3e2e9w,hotstargirl,3,Tue Jul 21 17:26:40 2015 UTC,"Good luck to you on this journey, I'm sure it will be life changing! Quick question: How have you prepared financially for this? Did you take an extended vacation from work? Last I looked an average thru hike on the AT is about 7 months. That's a long time out of work :)"
IAmA,3e2e9w,hotstargirl,5,Tue Jul 21 14:25:49 2015 UTC,Yeah its a long time. I've been saving bit by bit for a long time. I've known I've wanted to do this for 7 years. I just finished college and haven't started a real career so I just saved from my camp job and bar job. So yeah the bar said I can ce back when I'm done so I have work after which is nice.
IAmA,3e2e9w,itsjeeeves,3,Tue Jul 21 14:33:53 2015 UTC,What did you eat in a typical day?
IAmA,3e2e9w,noodle-face,9,Tue Jul 21 15:08:49 2015 UTC,Pop tarts and clif builder bar for breakfast. Mid morning clif bar. Lunch is usually a tortilla 2 packs of tuna and mayo and Sriracha. 2 afternoon snacks of cliff bar then a protein bar. Then blue box mac and cheese with half a block of cheese and Sriracha. Then a dessert of some kind. My favorite is rice Krispy treats. I can't wait to eat real food every day again.
IAmA,3e2e9w,Liiithe,3,Tue Jul 21 15:13:53 2015 UTC,Are you planning to explore Newfoundland? The Appalachians extend to here.
IAmA,3e2e9w,jonmon22,6,Tue Jul 21 16:24:48 2015 UTC,I would love to but it will end for me at katahdin. There is an unofficial extension of the trail that extends up there called th e international a.t
IAmA,3e2e9w,Aaron215,3,Tue Jul 21 16:30:13 2015 UTC,How many serial killers do you think are on the trail at any given time?
IAmA,3e2e9w,honeybadgergrrl,4,Tue Jul 21 16:25:08 2015 UTC,Lol a few. Look up Bismarck a.t. he embezzled 9 million dollars and murdered his wife and has been thru hiking the past 4 years just living on the trail. I've met a few others that have been very clearly mentally ill as well. There are also a few famous murders on the a.t. but statistically it's pretty safe
IAmA,3e2e9w,bfloros,2,Tue Jul 21 16:28:57 2015 UTC,Do you carry any personal protection?
IAmA,3e2e9w,claybonee,5,Tue Jul 21 16:30:52 2015 UTC,Nah. Too many laws about carrying throughout different states and it's heavy. Ounces add up quick
IAmA,3e2e9w,nrkuhlma,5,Tue Jul 21 16:33:18 2015 UTC,"Read about Bismark. It is questionable whether he murdered his wife. He is not a suspect in the case and I believe the case has long been closed.  Also about Bismark, he was a fantastic member of the AT community. A HUGE figure on the trail. Everyone that met him loved him. No one feared him at all. One hostel owner still welcomes him back to work there as he has for years if he ever gets out of prison.  The AT is actually a very safe place with an EXTREMELY welcoming and loving community that looks out for one another. There is such a thing as trail justice and word spreads quickly of any sketchy person."

IAmA,3e2e9w,sideburns,4,Tue Jul 21 16:33:55 2015 UTC,DAMN!!! I was hoping to cut you off there and hit you up with some trail love man.  YOU BEAT ME!
IAmA,3e2e9w,A8Warmonger,3,Tue Jul 21 16:39:01 2015 UTC,Have you run into my sister and her friend?  They're also through hiking the AT.  Their trail names are fireball and lightning.

Also have you had to replace a pair yet?  Has anyone you've gotten close to on the A.T. had to get off the trail?"
IAmA,3e2e9w,rwhickok,3,Tue Jul 21 16:57:51 2015 UTC,Ive done trail runners and shoes. Gone through 4 pairs so far. No not anyone I was close to but tons of people have dropped out
IAmA,3e2e9w,blackbiscuit58,3,Tue Jul 21 17:20:03 2015 UTC,"Howdy there! First off, congrats on your first thru-hike. Thru-hiking is a serious endeavor that should not be considered lightly, especially with the surge in interest thanks to books and films like Wild. I was a ""trail angel"" for hikers on the PCT when I lived in California's Sierra Nevada mountains and heard some horror stories from folks that didn't come as prepared as they should have been.   Now I have a few questions for you: 1.  How many days worth of supplies do you carry at a time before going into town? 2.  What kind of food do you carry/prepare on the trail? 3.  I have been hiking/backpacking for years and I really want to do one myself, how did you know you were ready mentally, physically, and emotionally?  4.  Ever consider hiking the Continental Divide or PCT?  5.  What is the funniest situation you found yourself in?    Thanks and happy trails!"
IAmA,3e2lxt,PureEarthNow,9,Tue Jul 21 14:01:47 2015 UTC,"I'm a resident of New Delhi, India. While your organisation's focus seems to be on heavily polluted specific areas, I was wondering if you guys have any ideas that can help tackle the ever increasing levels of air pollution in cities like mine. The current set of solutions essentially seem to revolve around ""drive less"". However, that isn't really a feasible option, since public transport is overloaded as is and is especially a nightmare in summers. We're getting more people and more cars day by day with no relief in sight. Do you have any suggestions or opinions on the matter?"
IAmA,3e2lxt,brownboy13,4,Tue Jul 21 14:16:32 2015 UTC,"In cities like that, you need a major overhaul of mass transit. Public transport needs to be attractive enough that people use it instead of driving one person in one car. That could include ""bus only"" lanes that aren't affected by traffic jams, or more expensive solutions like subways and trams. Just letting private bus providers do what they want does not work. Banning people from driving doesn't do much either. As PureEarthNow mentions, better fuel helps, but although it contributes to better air, it doesn't remove the traffic jams.  Bogotá is a successful example with their Transmilenio bus."
IAmA,3e2lxt,Turicus,7,Tue Jul 21 16:53:59 2015 UTC,"My sympathies to you and the daily problem of air in Delhi.  Through our partners in the newly formed Indian Alliance on Health and Pollution (www.indiahealthpollution.org) we are working to direct solutions to air pollution in Delhi, amongst other issues.  The first steps are to change the quality of diesel fuel (this is underway we understand), and next to stop outdoor burning.  There are cleaner technologies that can make the most difference.  Changing driving practices alone can be quite impractical, as you pointed out.  We need to continue to push for cleaner fuel, better catalytic converters, better controls on diesel emissions, and the like.  There are success stories out there already - converting the two-stroke rickshaws some years ago is a good example.  It needs so much attention, as the numbers are getting worse."
IAmA,3e2lxt,wantedwanted,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:28:48 2015 UTC,"There's a movement that I think holds a lot of promise in this regard, and that's new urbanism - creating mixed use, walkable communities, where healthy food, shopping, recreation, and other amenities are all easily accessible. With a good public transit system, a community like this goes a long way toward reducing pollution and reliance on cars. Poor city planning is a huge problem everywhere."
IAmA,3e2lxt,bretherenley,7,Tue Jul 21 18:10:41 2015 UTC,"Hi Richard!  5 questions (I hope that's allowed): 1. Polluting is easy, cleaning is not. Aside from pollution remediation, does your organization undertake efforts to change people's polluting behaviours? If so, how? If not, why not?  2. What's generally the greatest logistical hurdle to these clean-up projects? 3. How is your organization funded? 4. Has your organization ever been met with local opposition in heavily polluted developing areas?  5. How sustainable is pollution remediation in the areas that you have tackled?"
IAmA,3e2lxt,bretherenley,5,Tue Jul 21 14:36:21 2015 UTC,"Many questions!  OK, let me give it a shot. 1. and 2.  Yes, the key to managing pollution is first of all to change to non-polluting technologies and techniques.  Once done, then there is often a need to clean up the mess from earlier.    For mercury contamination in gold mining, for example, we train miners in mercury-free technologies that also increase yield.  For polluting industries with a contaminated site, we will never work on the clean-up without the industry stopping the initial exposure.  This usually requires technology, investment and enforcement on their part, which we often help to pull together with various partners.   Our organization is funded by donations from governments and international organizations (like USAID, European Commission DG DevCo, World Bank, ADB and others), some foundations like Rockefeller Brothers, and individuals as well.  They fund us because the public health extent of pollution is simply enormous.  So much needs to be done.   A number of times we have met with problems where local politicians have their hand out for donations, or are stalling for other reasons.  We have never had opposition from the poor who are affected by the pollution.  They are who we work for.   We expect and plan that the work we do is sustainable, and the programs expands to other regions in that country.  So far we have not seen any backsliding.  We do watch - staff in each country stay on top of old and new projects.      Thanks for all these great questions!"
IAmA,3e2lxt,2kun,3,Tue Jul 21 14:52:28 2015 UTC,Thank you for the answers! What are some ways that one could get involved?
IAmA,3e2lxt,Turicus,5,Tue Jul 21 15:03:48 2015 UTC,"I am currently studying civil engineering, partly because I too wish to help reducing pollution in the environment, especially in densely populated countries like Bangladesh. Was there any particular reason that made you decide to pursue your career path? What were some of the hurdles in creating Pure Earth and how did you overcome them? How would you recommend one to follow a career path in environmental care/entrepreneurship?"
IAmA,3e2lxt,spacemonk42,5,Tue Jul 21 14:18:28 2015 UTC,"I applaud anyone studying engineering, of any type.  I am an electrical engineer, and we geeks are truly the way of the future!  Practical solutions are needed, and implementation.  We spend too much time talking about problems rather than just solving them.  Its up to us engineers to make it happen."
IAmA,3e2lxt,Turicus,2,Tue Jul 21 14:30:53 2015 UTC,"Good luck. I worked in Bangladesh for 4 years. I started up a recycling project in 2012, which is still running. It's tough going, cause people really lack awareness."
IAmA,3e2lxt,Frajer,4,Tue Jul 21 16:44:18 2015 UTC,"I live in Santiago, Chile. Coming from Buenos Aires, the air here gets really bad in winter, especially when it doesn't rain enough (like this season). Have you done work here? What is the overall outlook on the evolution of cities like Santiago? Is it an issue of reducing emissions or is there a technology-based solution for the future like extensive use of green roofing, increasing forestation, etc?"
IAmA,3e2lxt,SpumlyChumWack,3,Tue Jul 21 15:20:27 2015 UTC,"This year is the worst air quality in Santiago since 1999. Part of it is due to Santiago's location in a valley, the other is climate conditions (winter inversion). The first half of 2015 has been the dryest semester in decades. Rain would wash out some of the pollution.  Since traffic is the biggest source of contamination, the solution is to make cars less polluting (like in Europe), and to re-organize mass transit. Replace individual cars with buses, trains, trams etc. Rooftop gardens and the like can make a contribution, but you won't be able to compensate for continuing pollution with that. Some contaminants aren't eliminated by trees anyway.  I work in environment projects in Bolivia, and we just got a letter detailing this year's situation in Santiago."
IAmA,3e2lxt,1320Fastback,2,Tue Jul 21 16:49:00 2015 UTC,"Hi.  We have had a little work in Santiago (and some in BA too), looking at contaminated sites, but we are not currently active there.  Our partner, Fundacion Chile, is really excellent, and may be a good group to approach."
IAmA,3e2lxt,Turicus,4,Tue Jul 21 15:32:03 2015 UTC,How do you clean up pollution?
IAmA,3e2lxt,DrizzyDroz,3,Tue Jul 21 15:32:32 2015 UTC,"Well, there is a lot to that question.    First, we look at the type of pollution.  Air, water, or soil.  Then, we look to see what is the contaminant.  Is it bacteria in water?  Or lead in soil? Or particulates in air?  Then, we look to the source of the pollution.  Is it a factory, or a car exhaust, or some small industry?  Answering these questions then gives us a set of solutions we can implement.  The solutions are no longer rocket science because we have dealt with the worst pollution problems in the United States already.  Our water is clean to drink, the air is (mostly good), and the soil safe for kids to play on.    But overseas, though these problems are still huge.  The solutions we have used in the US can be transplanted into those poorer countries to help them out.  This is what we now need to do, to look after the millions who will die each year because of pollution - almost all of them in poorer countries."
IAmA,3e2lxt,warry0r,4,Tue Jul 21 15:42:23 2015 UTC,What would you say is the largest obstacle to being able to clean up these sort of things? Do you ever have people attempt to stop or threaten you or others while cleaning?
IAmA,3e2lxt,Originholder,2,Tue Jul 21 16:09:21 2015 UTC,"There are two main obstacles.  The first is knowledge: knowledge both of the dangers of pollution in these countries (people often do not understand why they are getting sick), and of the way to solve the problem.  The second is funding.  There is not much funding given to pollution within most countries yet.  The international aid community has not made pollution a priority yet, even though it kills so many people.    I have had quite a few exciting run-ins in the last few decades.  I just wrote a book called The Brown Agenda - it is available for pre-purchase on Amazon now; it comes out August 11th.  You can see what it is like in these poisoned spots from first hand experience!!!"

China is a polluted country, no doubt, and we pay close attention to it because it manufactures so much of our consumer-economy products.    But it is not the most polluted country.  Imho that title goes to the former soviet union.  The Soviets manufactured without any pollution controls, much of it for the cold war (weapons and the like).  There are regions in Russia, Kazakstan, and others that are destroyed, toxic nightmares.  Hundreds of thousands if not millions of people living in these places.  And almost no efforts to clean them up."

IAmA,3e2lxt,orc2015,3,Tue Jul 21 16:50:16 2015 UTC,"As a chemist and more specifically a ""green"" chemist. I have a few questions about your cleaning processes and testing.   1.) What is the most toxic substance your company has had the displeasure of cleaning up and what additional safety measures did you take to ensure the health of your employees? (e.g. highly radioactive substances, carcinogenic inhalants, etc.)   2.) How is the toxic waste ""disposed of""? Is it stored in a more controlled environment or sent to specialty sites that may treat the waste?   3.) What metrics do you use to determine that an area is ""clean"" and contaminants haven't leeched into the sediment or groundwater?  4.) Can any of the toxic materials you take care of be recycled or do you currently try to purify contaminants for useful components?  Thank you so much for you time answering our questions and the work you're doing cleaning up the mistakes of bad science!"
IAmA,3e2lxt,bannibunny,2,Tue Jul 21 16:38:20 2015 UTC,"We have cleaned up many highly toxic substances, from radionuclides to TNT, MNCB, and hex chromium.  Many of the toxicants we deal with are both acutely poisonous and carcinogenic.    All of our work is done with full protective gear (PPE) when it is called for, under the guidance of an expert with detailed understanding of that particular problem.  We find experts throughout our Technical Advisory Board, and senior engineers will go visit sites, design projects with the best science and knowledge available, and then oversee the project from both an efficacy and safety perspective.    We generally follow USEPA guidelines for standards, or local guidelines if they are available and appropriate.    Sometimes the toxicant can be recycled - it depends on the concentration and toxicant itself.  I hope this answers your questions.  Green chemistry is the way to go!"
IAmA,3e2lxt,Ariosoto,3,Tue Jul 21 16:56:03 2015 UTC,"Hi Richard, What should I invest in: radiation suits or gas masks? Maybe both? The current state of pollution, i don't want to wake up, step outside and get burned to a crisp due to losing our atmosphere."
IAmA,3e2lxt,Ariosoto,2,Tue Jul 21 16:59:20 2015 UTC,"Neither worries me.    Living in the US, life is good, getting cleaner by the year.  The ozone layer is getting better, our drinking water is clean and well protected, and our wildlife has so many caring for its wellbeing.

If I were to be concerned about my consumption and toxicants, it is just not the food industry I would boycott.  I'd have to boycott the entire economy.  The processing of raw materials  to make plastics, metals, everything we use - this is the main source of contamination.  The trick is to mine process using the best and cleanest technologies, and be willing to pay for that.  The circular economy is a must for the human race to thrive."

My question to you is do you have plans In The future to make it bigger? I feel like this years event was rather small. There was only about 4 aisles of vendors and at 50 bucks for a GA ticket I expected a little more.
IAmA,3e2htw,kutch_classic,6,Tue Jul 21 13:42:23 2015 UTC,"Hey there! 4 years straight, impressive! It's always interesting to hear different perspectives. We actually had about 10 MORE companies participating this year than last in Chicago. We changed the layout of the floor quite a bit. Fucked up Club Spotlight (which has since gone back to it's previous setup) and moved the seminars further off the main show floor... BUT, one of the things we're thinking of doing is bringing back some ""ancillary"" events held within EXXXOTICA... The tattoo portion was cool. We've done car shows in the past, which we may bring back... We're also open to other suggestions of what people might like to see! We're also working on bulking up the VIP ticket. We're doing a free poster which gets you 25 free autographs from the top stars at the show in Dallas. It's certainly not cheap, but it's definitely an experience you can't get anywhere else!"

I remember seeing billboards for this a few years back and joking with my girlfriend that we should go. I'm sure it beats the home renovation show I saw there last time.  What is the most surprising thing you've learned about the porn industry since starting the expo?
IAmA,3e2htw,TsaraNoga_,4,Tue Jul 21 15:59:38 2015 UTC,"First... To all those looking to talk their girlfriend/wife into attending with them, remember, Ladies Free Friday!   I think the most surprising thing was that not all adult businesses have a license to print money... When I first started EXXXOTICA, it was because the adult business makes 13 billion dollars a year in the United States and I just wanted a little piece of that. The real truth is, that type of money doesn't exist in adult anymore. Still to this day, people always say, ""You should get a big company to sponsor and pay for it... Like Vivid or Wicked Pictures""... But the simple fact is those companies just don't make the crazy money selling DVD's that they used to. Obviously tube sites have pretty much crushed that. Now cam sites? That's a whole different story..."
IAmA,3e2htw,uronlisunshyne,3,Tue Jul 21 16:07:51 2015 UTC,"Really must ask, what is the deal with cam sites? Do they make a ton of money outright but just take a cut, do they make their money in adverts, or subscriptions, what is the deal? Not really what I am looking for in terms of my kicks so don't really know too much about it, although am interested in their business model, or perhaps lack thereof.  Or do you mostly just deal with the bigger more well known adult actors?"
IAmA,3e2htw,uronlisunshyne,3,Tue Jul 21 16:35:39 2015 UTC,"Cam sites are pretty easy to figure out. They're just like strip clubs... Digital strip clubs. The stripper is the webcam girl. The website is the club owner. And patrons are patrons. Only difference is, instead of the club taking a small fee from the stripper, they take (around) half from the camgirl. Girls (and guys, and couples) can both perform and watch online, from the comfort of your own home. You ""tip"" the performers just like you would a stripper. And dudes fall in love with camgirls (and believe the camgirl reeeeeally likes them, because they're different) just like strippers.   I once heard of a camgirl having a brand new Mustang convertible purchased for her by a man she never met IRL. THAT I don't get... But hey. To each their own."

I really loved working on that, in Hawaii with the Hawaiian people. It's the largest collection of contemporary native Hawaiian art! It was unique in that we weren't trying to create a 1950's parody of Hawaii. It's the current story of Hawaii told with shape and form and with roots in traditions without being a book report. I'm proud of it because it wasn't appropriation. At least I hope I am not alone in feeling that it's genuine. It came from a genuine place.  How many disciplines make this place work. From librarians to janitors to mechanical engineers, programers and artists... SO many people are part of this process. We are very collaborative. We also have very inventive halloween parties. One year someone came as an AppleII and had a scrolling Oregon Trail game going. Whaaaat!  I went to a design school in Pasadena called Art Center College of Design. We have grad shows where industry executives peruse our art wares. I was hired directly from there because my work looked a lot different from everyone else's. I think I was also able to explain my ideas well.  BE CURIOUS! We like to see inventiveness in all of it's forms.

Im an animation major so I dont see a lot of other departments, but I hear good things about our fashion, film and illustration majors too."
IAmA,3dzgk0,PossessedPuppetArt,2,Tue Jul 21 05:30:15 2015 UTC,A lot of my friends from animation have great jobs now. Everyone I know from VFX and motion graphics are gainfully employed in their fields.
IAmA,3dzgk0,howisaraven,5,Tue Jul 21 14:57:45 2015 UTC,"I'm not the one to answer that question, but I will say that any schools have job fairs where potential employers come looking for employees. It would be the placement rate that sets them apart if anything, not that people come looking."

IAmA,3dzgk0,KILL_WITH_KINDNESS,14,Tue Jul 21 00:14:25 2015 UTC,"Hey! How much are electrical engineers involved in the design process? I'm currently studying about that, and once dreamed about becoming an Imagineer.   Also, is there any way I could visit any imagineering facilities? Are there any located in Orlando?"
IAmA,3dzgk0,irvinesleuth,31,Mon Jul 20 23:53:35 2015 UTC,"I know a friend who is an engineer/Imagineer.  He's about 60.  He's a little bitter. . .  Apparently, the oldschool Imagineers were all engineers and they had a reputation of hiring the best.  After John Lasseter took over, they shifted their focus.  Now the Imagineers are mostly design people, more focused on art,  like the post at the top of the thread.  They design everything, but don't know how to build it.  They contract out the engineering."
IAmA,3dzgk0,Bruione,7,Tue Jul 21 04:11:18 2015 UTC,"To be completely fair, most engineers don't know how to build things. They just know design and expect the contractor to figure it out. Source: am engineer with family in the construction business."
IAmA,3dzgk0,aocom,6,Tue Jul 21 11:30:43 2015 UTC,"One of my friends does electrical engineering for them, and they are definitely heavily involved!  Mmm, it's doable, but you would definitely have to know somebody to get in, both feature animation and Imagineering (WDI) are even shut to unaccompanied employees in other segments of the company, but I think WDI is more strict."
IAmA,3dzgk0,Badankis,4,Tue Jul 21 02:26:52 2015 UTC,"There will be EEs on board from day one in terms of facility design. Generally for show design we will have a consultant brought in at schematic design (SD, phase 1 of design) to review SD drawings and compare with SD facility drawings for feasibility. This will be repeated through concept design (CD, phase 2) and detail design (DD, phase 3). It won't be until after contract awards that the real EE work will begin. For ride, EE will begin after contract award. If you are looking to work on the 'fun stuff' exclusively, I recommend investigating major ride/show vendors (B&M, Zamperla, Oceaneering, Triotech, Electrosonic, Entech to name a few). I say major vendors due to smaller vendors subbing all engineering work to specialized firms (sorry, can't remember any of the engineering firms' names). I try to always steer people away from imagineering due to the romanticism associated to it thus causing overpopulation. There are over a hundred really good vendors out there that need talented staff right this second. Disney is not the end all be all of theme parks and WDI is certainly not what it used to be."
IAmA,3dzgk0,AeroEngineer90,12,Tue Jul 21 06:18:59 2015 UTC,"Hey there. I am not an imagineer but I did take a tour of Disney with a mechanical engineering manager.   Unfortunately, there are no imagineering facilities in Orlando. They are all in California. Engineers at Disney in Orlando are mainly repair and overhaul type engineers which can still be really cool.  I'm sure there are electrical engineers involved in the design process. Someone above mentioned that their imagineer friend designed light bulbs for the tree that reduced fire chance to near zero. I bet there was an ee on that job! Enjoy school. It's great but being an engineer is even better  (in my opinion)"
IAmA,3dzgk0,Racuh,20,Tue Jul 21 01:47:40 2015 UTC,"We have a lot of Imagineers in Orlando. We have an office there as well. Glendale is the centrally located unit, but our in-park Imagineers are invaluable."
IAmA,3dzgk0,Pidery,6,Tue Jul 21 02:02:02 2015 UTC,I didn't realize you guys were on the Grandview campus!! I'm across the street at Dreamworks now but used to work at Disney Mobile. The Dreamworks campus has more ducklings but not nearly as many Starbucks :)
IAmA,3dzgk0,Racuh,6,Tue Jul 21 02:42:40 2015 UTC,But the baby ducks! and the baby duck ramps! Koi fishes and also free lunch. I think that campus wins.
IAmA,3dzgk0,Phreakhead,2,Tue Jul 21 02:45:08 2015 UTC,"I'm sure there are some. I had a PCB fabricated and populated by Imagineering's factory, so I'm sure they've got some EEs there or somewhere else..."

IAmA,3dzgk0,Soperos,12,Tue Jul 21 01:24:55 2015 UTC,What does a Disney Imagineer do?
IAmA,3dzgk0,HeyItsNickCA,23,Tue Jul 21 00:52:22 2015 UTC,"Walt Disney Imagineering is the part of the Walt Disney Company that focuses on design and development of all theme parks that Disney owns.   They design all the rides at Disney theme parks along with the general layout of the park. In addition, they are now building the non theme-park resorts such as Alunai Resort in Hawaii.    While theme parks/resorts are their main area, they have done other things such as designing the first Disney store, modernizing the Angel stadium, designing the Magic and Fantasy cruise ships on the Disney Cruise Line, etc."
IAmA,3dzgk0,HighSorcerer,5,Tue Jul 21 04:05:08 2015 UTC,It's the attention to detail that they put into everything that really impresses me. Those guys think of everything.
IAmA,3dzgk0,jcb5150,7,Tue Jul 21 13:27:56 2015 UTC,What don't they do?!
IAmA,3dzgk0,Soperos,5,Tue Jul 21 02:38:02 2015 UTC,"That is the question, yes."
IAmA,3dzgk0,jcb5150,2,Tue Jul 21 02:49:55 2015 UTC,"Fine.  Inspiration. Childhood wonderment. Hope of a better world. This is what an Imagineer does, and they are awesome.   Also they made Figment. Loved him as a kid."
IAmA,3dzgk0,Dothelokipokie,6,Tue Jul 21 02:59:14 2015 UTC,"Hey there! How long ago did you graduate from Art Center? I got to dine with Marty Sklar a few days ago and I just have to say, you guys rock. From Disney legends to current attractions,  y'all never cease to blow my mind grapes.   Have you done any work at DL or CA?"
IAmA,3dzgk0,Racuh,22,Mon Jul 20 22:22:50 2015 UTC,"Marty is an institution! How very fortunate you were able to have dinner with him. I graduated in 2005. I did work for Toy Story Midway Mania at California Adventure. It was really cool seeing my artwork on display in the Blue Sky Cellar after it had opened. I am on the front end doing concept art, so no one ever gets to see what those first ideas look like on paper before they get built."
IAmA,3dzgk0,Dothelokipokie,10,Mon Jul 20 22:37:11 2015 UTC,"Wonderful! I was very very lucky indeed (he hosted the Ryman arts benefit last week and I was fortunate enough to be invited).  Did you ever know Bob Kato at Art Center? (I think he may have been teaching there. That guy is the reason I am in school for visual development.)   I freaking loved seeing your work at Blue Sky! The SO and I are a excited whenever the cellar opens, and we remember being even more excited about seeing the vis dev for Midway Mania. That ride is beautiful.   You're doing exactly what I've dreamed of doing since I was 4. I'm in my last years at college now. The imagineers are like heroes to me, so thank you for being such a strong inspiration!"
IAmA,3dzgk0,Racuh,28,Mon Jul 20 22:43:42 2015 UTC,"I do know Bob! In fact I still see him on Wednesdays. We have a drawing class on campus here.   Bob actually changed the trajectory of my life:  I was about 14 and my mom had a temp job for Disney Toon. I was on summer vacation and went to work with her one day. There was a costumed model class while I was visiting and my mom asked if I could join. The teacher (Bob) said sure, and away I went. Bob said that in 2 hours he had crammed 2 terms worth of skills into my head. He said I had done so well that I should consider going to Art Center and making art a career goal. So I did! I had him as an instructor- one of 3 that I feel are THE BEST at Art Center. And here I am now, working at Disney, and I still see Bob in life drawing. Full circle."
IAmA,3dzgk0,Dothelokipokie,8,Mon Jul 20 22:54:39 2015 UTC,"He did the SAME thing for me! I wish I had gone to Art Center, but LB state has an illustration/animation program that I couldn't pass up. God, that guy is cool! Ever been do his Drawing Club on Thursdays?  I've only been once since it moved to Gallery Nucleus."
IAmA,3dzgk0,Racuh,8,Mon Jul 20 23:05:12 2015 UTC,Nope. I haven't. Im just very lazy. The last thing I want to do after work is more art. I kind of want to stare off into space and turn my brain off. Hear great stuff though and I got his Drawing club book. I made him sign it.
IAmA,3dzgk0,Dothelokipokie,3,Mon Jul 20 23:14:42 2015 UTC,"Hey I totally get it. That book is rad, I should make him sign my copy! Well thanks for the chat!"
IAmA,3dzgk0,jgweiss,10,Mon Jul 20 23:18:05 2015 UTC,"Toy Story Midway Mania at California Adventure.   thank you, THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK ON THIS AWESOME BEAUTIFUL RIDE.  my question: is there anything that you've done that you wish more guests would notice?"
IAmA,3dzgk0,ngmcs8203,7,Tue Jul 21 00:07:13 2015 UTC,"One of the things I love noticing the most in Disneyland/DCA are the little touches. From the Monsters Inc posters/artwork on the walls of the ride, to the mostly unseen themed parts of the park like fence posts or trash cans. I feel like every time I go to the parks, and see some of the smaller details, a little designer angel gets its wings."
IAmA,3dzgk0,Racuh,6,Tue Jul 21 01:08:28 2015 UTC,I usually feel that way too. I have ridden Pirates a zillion times and there is something new EVERY time.
IAmA,3dzgk0,CaptnJoe,3,Tue Jul 21 01:11:50 2015 UTC,We had dinner with Bob Gurr on a Disney Cruise a few years back with his son. Very nice guy. Have you had any interactions with Bob Gurr or Joe Rhodes? I guess Joe with the Aulani build. Anything on Avatar?
IAmA,3dzgk0,progress_dad,4,Tue Jul 21 00:51:00 2015 UTC,Do you work with anyone from SCAD?
IAmA,3dzgk0,Racuh,7,Mon Jul 20 23:04:17 2015 UTC,"There are SCAD graduates here, yes."
IAmA,3dzgk0,progress_dad,5,Mon Jul 20 23:15:00 2015 UTC,Awesome! I'm at SCAD now in the themed entertainment design degree! Thanks for answering some questions! :)
IAmA,3dzgk0,howisaraven,3,Mon Jul 20 23:48:07 2015 UTC,"SCAD alum. I've been looking at Art Center for MA or maybe just another undergrad degree (I have no presumptions I'll be accepted to the MA program lolweep).   The real kick in the face is that I wanted to go to a school in California right out of high school and got accepted to the Academy of Art College San Francisco (now Academy of Art University) but my mom wouldn't let me go then, she said I had to wait a year and go to an east coast school. Freshman year at SCAD I learned about the Art Center. Applied to transfer my sophomore year, got accepted but didn't go because I decided to stay at SCAD.  I graduated 8 years ago and am still kicking myself."
IAmA,3dzgk0,clemsinfonian,4,Tue Jul 21 02:18:13 2015 UTC,Thanks for answering! Becoming an Imagineer has been a dream of mine for years. I'm currently studying mechanical engineering at Clemson and applying for the Disney College Program in August. What are some of the most common diciplines in the program Imagineering?
IAmA,3dzgk0,Racuh,5,Mon Jul 20 23:48:33 2015 UTC,"I unfortunately don't know a lot about our Disney college program. I interned before being hired, but I was local- lived in the LA area. I hear great things about the program however! Best of luck in your journey."
IAmA,3dzgk0,clemsinfonian,3,Tue Jul 21 00:16:15 2015 UTC,Thanks! I meant to ask what diciplines are common among Imagineers. My wording was confusing.
IAmA,3dzgk0,SirThom,3,Tue Jul 21 00:20:07 2015 UTC,"Good luck on getting into the program! I did 3 programs (both at Disney World and Disneyland), and loved it all. Hit me up if you have any questions."
IAmA,3dzgk0,mydogisanewok,3,Tue Jul 21 00:37:54 2015 UTC,Common engineering disciplines are mechanical and electrical. A lot of people I work with are ex-aerospace but there are people from many different industries.
IAmA,3dzgk0,la_pluie,2,Tue Jul 21 06:36:46 2015 UTC,"You should apply for the Professional Intern program. You actually work specifically within your field as opposed to College Program, where you're labor for the parks."
IAmA,3dzgk0,IamKlutcH,6,Tue Jul 21 06:02:39 2015 UTC,did you just apply online or is there another way of getting in?
IAmA,3dzgk0,Racuh,23,Mon Jul 20 22:12:01 2015 UTC,A lot of people come in through Disney Imaginations program. I was hired after executives saw my work in person during my grad show.
IAmA,3dzgk0,Tighten_Up,6,Mon Jul 20 22:18:03 2015 UTC,2 . Dont forget about us at BigD/Starbucks that keep you guys fueled ;)
IAmA,3dzgk0,Racuh,9,Tue Jul 21 00:18:02 2015 UTC,Omg. Every morning or I'd  be useless. You guys are the real MVP's.

IAmA,3dzgk0,ninjaturrtle,2,Tue Jul 21 13:03:00 2015 UTC,Did you know anyone that worked in the WDC?   I always hear that's it's hard getting your foot in the door unless you know someone.
IAmA,3dzgk0,solo89,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:36:30 2015 UTC,How many disciplines make this place work. From librarians   As a librarian that goes on disney careers and ABC jobs etc etc... Any suggestions on getting in? haha
IAmA,3dzgk0,Boltcable,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:21:49 2015 UTC,"Hey! Right now, I am about to start college and am intrested I'm both engineering and video editing! What should I do for college to help my chances of becoming an imagineer?  Ps. I'm going to Disney World for the 17th time in my life! Is there a way to get more firmiliar with imagineering while there?"
IAmA,3dzgk0,IPokeUWithSharpie,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:43:33 2015 UTC,Hi Racuh! Can we see some of your art works? Would love to see the creativity of an Imagineer :)
IAmA,3dzgk0,Racuh,11,Tue Jul 21 00:57:56 2015 UTC,Unfortunately no. Unless the art has been released in media already- I do not own it and would not distribute it. If you look up press releases for Aulani expansion you will see marketing art painted by me. It will be on the Disney site I am sure.
IAmA,3dzgk0,clevingersfoil,786,Tue Jul 21 01:03:55 2015 UTC,Please don't be disappointed if this doesn't happen. The Mouse is very litigious and I will bet every Imagineer is under a lifetime non-disclosure agreement. Revealing engineering trade knowledge and intellectual property to the public and competitors would be incredibly damaging.
IAmA,3dzgk0,Tophloaf,22,Mon Jul 20 20:53:33 2015 UTC,"I figured they wouldn't be able to talk much about it, but I was more interested in how they landed their job in imagineering."
IAmA,3dzgk0,push_pop,44,Tue Jul 21 00:13:56 2015 UTC,I worked at Disney imagineering for a little over a year and know many people who have worked with them through out the years (or still do). They keep few actual imagineers on staff and then hire through local design firms when they need to staff up for a park (IE Shanghai Disney). I'd be happy to answer what questions I can if someone better doesn't show up.
IAmA,3dzgk0,RaveTheGo,8,Tue Jul 21 01:40:07 2015 UTC,"I'm curious what (if any) relationship does Disney research have with the Imagineers.  The projects that come out of Disney research are on par with MIT media lab, etc... wondering if that tech makes its way into the parks or toys eventually or do they act sort of as their own research entity?"
IAmA,3dzgk0,PenisInBlender,4,Tue Jul 21 04:57:11 2015 UTC,"You are the one! Please, do! And thanks."
IAmA,3dzgk0,zomething,3,Tue Jul 21 04:56:06 2015 UTC,The same way everyone else lands a sought after job in modern America: knowing the right people.

IAmA,3dzgk0,alarumba,165,Mon Jul 20 21:10:43 2015 UTC,"Not to mention they're extremely devoted and loyal to the company. It's almost cultish, but Disney makes great stuff, so I'll allow it."
IAmA,3dzgk0,I_RAPE_REDDITS,45,Tue Jul 21 01:52:26 2015 UTC,My brother works for Weta workshop. He keeps very quiet on details. All I know is he's currently building a Tank.
IAmA,3dzgk0,alarumba,12,Tue Jul 21 04:17:02 2015 UTC,He's working on the Thunderbird Shadow.
IAmA,3dzgk0,MikeyB67,7,Tue Jul 21 05:50:58 2015 UTC,Ooooo...  I didn't even find out from him that he was working on anything. It was a colleague of his that wasn't so tight lipped.
IAmA,3dzgk0,alarumba,4,Tue Jul 21 08:19:41 2015 UTC,"Like, a normal tank? Or do you know?"
IAmA,3dzgk0,xSoupyTwist,14,Tue Jul 21 05:28:46 2015 UTC,I'd love to know. I don't know if it's military or septic.
IAmA,3dzgk0,katiehates,3,Tue Jul 21 08:26:05 2015 UTC,"Damn, that's awesome. Went to visit weta a few weeks back. Would love to work there."
IAmA,3dzgk0,alarumba,2,Tue Jul 21 09:31:09 2015 UTC,"I had a job interview there a couple of months ago. Didn't make the grade unfortunately, but was interesting to see just a little bit behind the scenes!"
IAmA,3dzgk0,xSoupyTwist,4,Tue Jul 21 10:44:03 2015 UTC,My brother has said he could get me a job there. I'm likely to offer the job to my a flatmate (and best mate). He'd be far more capable than me.   It's not all positive working there from what I've heard. There's heavy hours and minimal pay. But the creative side is brilliant. My brother was responsible for some of the Anzac exhibit at Te Papa.
IAmA,3dzgk0,nowenknows,4,Tue Jul 21 09:38:39 2015 UTC,That exhibit was absolutely breathtaking. Tugged at the heart strings even for someone who's a foreigner.  I'm not surprised your brother said that. That industry is all about the connections haha. I'd take long hours being creative over a cubicle/desk job any day though. Wake up for a 4 am call time? Okay! But man do I have the hardest time crawling out of bed for a 9 am class hahaha XD
IAmA,3dzgk0,Vampircorn,37,Tue Jul 21 09:47:06 2015 UTC,I did the imagineer internship program and got kicked out for the dumbest thing. I vouch for this statement.

IAmA,3dzgk0,JM2845,46,Tue Jul 21 04:00:11 2015 UTC,Nowen knows :/
IAmA,3dzgk0,nowenknows,33,Tue Jul 21 04:55:30 2015 UTC,They got to him before we did
IAmA,3dzgk0,heisenberg0,28,Tue Jul 21 04:04:34 2015 UTC,I was holding a PBR in the dormitories. I was 20 at the time.
IAmA,3dzgk0,nowenknows,44,Tue Jul 21 05:31:49 2015 UTC,Sounds like a legitimate reason to get kicked out of a DISNEY internship program.
IAmA,3dzgk0,O8N0X10U5,22,Tue Jul 21 05:50:47 2015 UTC,"The dormitories house thousands of interns and foreign workers. Everyone from imagineers to gift shop ""cast members"" lived there. We're talking about a plethora of hot girls from every country living together. It was a non stop party."

IAmA,3dzgk0,nowenknows,7,Tue Jul 21 13:11:48 2015 UTC,You're asking the right question. I'm guessing Vista.... because Vista.
IAmA,3dzgk0,123choji,3,Tue Jul 21 07:24:43 2015 UTC,Is that really a question?
IAmA,3dzgk0,nowenknows,4,Tue Jul 21 07:39:26 2015 UTC,PBR?

IAmA,3dzgk0,nowenknows,5,Tue Jul 21 04:09:24 2015 UTC,You broke the law?
IAmA,3dzgk0,legotri,4,Tue Jul 21 05:58:19 2015 UTC,Yes. I drank a beer underage when I was living in a dorm in Florida working at Disney World with 1000 other people of my age. Forgive me father for I have sinned.
IAmA,3dzgk0,Piznti,8,Tue Jul 21 06:13:25 2015 UTC,"Yup, sucks, but Disney can't be complicit in that. Disney has to stand for children's values and that means underage drinking has to be taken seriously. It's not easy, but that's why Disney may not be the right place for ya :P. Nickelodeon on the other hand..."
IAmA,3dzgk0,FUCITADEL,8,Tue Jul 21 06:16:35 2015 UTC,"Yup worked for a company who did work for them. Had to sign something saying I couldn't say anything about what we did. Everyone had to sign one if they came in, even guests."
IAmA,3dzgk0,Keurigirl,16,Tue Jul 21 03:57:57 2015 UTC,Hahah!
IAmA,3dzgk0,lmg6841,7,Mon Jul 20 23:22:51 2015 UTC,"I've heard several imagineers speak at various places. They do answer questions, they do talk a lot about their jobs or things they've done. They obviously can't talk about things they are currently working on but past projects are game."

IAmA,3dzgk0,CarolineH10,5,Tue Jul 21 02:03:18 2015 UTC,"Sure, but engineering trade knowledge isn't something people with art or design backgrounds are going to share in much detail or expertise."
IAmA,3dzgk0,courtnoo,12,Tue Jul 21 02:25:54 2015 UTC,"I would suggest following Brian Collins, a former Imagineer, on periscope! He does some really insightful scopes at WDW and tries to answer questions!"
IAmA,3dzgk0,viperware,6,Tue Jul 21 01:00:24 2015 UTC,"I saw a panel of Imagineers speak at a teacher's convention about 8 or 9 years ago. Each of them gave their backstory about how they became an Imagineer and talked about their current projects and areas of expertise.

IAmA,3dzgk0,SeauxCrazy,25,Mon Jul 20 22:18:56 2015 UTC,"I am an Imagineer, albeit one with a short tenure at this point. I will answer what I can, but that will be limited due to legal stuff (as discussed ad nauseum). To respond to the initial questions:  1: Haven't been around long enough to accomplish much, so I'll say landing the job. It was very unexpected but I am honored to be working for a company with such a rich legacy and with such a big impact on people's lives.   2: Everyone talks about the variety of disciplines here, which is very different from my past experience. I am finding that they encourage people to do things outside of their normal job function in order to foster creativity - for example, I'm an engineer but working with creative types really forces you to see things from other perspectives, leading to very unique ideas.   3: I have an engineering degree and worked in a different industry for several years after school. I was approached by a Disney recruiter for another position, which wasn't a good fit. Much to my surprise, they contacted me a few months later with a much better fit. Having an engineering background isn't required, but engineers do make up a substantial portion of our workforce.   4: Stay in school, kids! But seriously, do well in school. If you're serious about working here, major in something you enjoy that is relevant to what we do (art, storytelling, engineering, etc.) and try to get into our internship program. It seems to me that many of my colleagues got in that way. The school you go to has some bearing for some positions, they recruit from certain schools in some disciplines. Engineering seems to be more scattered as far as backgrounds go.   5: Rides! I can't wait to see peoples reactions when the ride I am working on opens. That will be very fulfilling to me."

I will speak from my own exepriences...    I am proud of the fact that you will hopefully never see or notice anything that I worked on at a conscious level, and we worked tirelessly to make it that way... BUT the impact of what I do is definately felt and really helps make the experiences as good as they are.   Part of Pulp Fiction was filmed on the Imagineering campus before it was imagineering.  I landed my job through a mentoring relationship in college (Purdue University).  Incidentally, finding a good mentor in college (even at the undergraduate level) is what made all of the difference to making my education what it was.  It gave my education context and purpose.  Even if you aren't trying to be an imagineer, foster those relationships with teachers who are willing to mentor.  Apply for assistanships, show initiative, and be excited about what you are doing.  Having some experience on the operations side of business is valuable... I wish I had some.  Also, experience in construction is good too.  I am on the engineering side of things, so knowing how to handle RFIs, CAD detailing (archetectural and mechanical), construction workflow, contracting business, and even knowing how to frame walls can be useful.  I think its really valuable to know how to build things at a large scale, and know the realism that building something will bring to a beautiful piece of concept art or a meticulously detailed integration drawing.  I like early design stuff and the last part of the jobs where we integrate systems.  Its a lot of fun to watch everything come together.   Cheers!"

My current proudest moment is having my friends and family pay closer attention to the little details in the parks.  We all come from very different backgrounds with all kinds of odd interests. Like pinball machines and storytelling competitions.  I went to CalArts. My current boss came to my portfolio day and played with a cool program I designed while we talked about all of the weird stuff I am doing. He contacted me a few months later and asked me to interview for my job.  Love what you do. Passion is the best trait in any Imagineer.  My favorite thing to work on is a new story line.

IAmA,3dzgk0,kgoyette,6,Tue Jul 21 01:35:20 2015 UTC,"Hello! Former Imagineer here, I worked there for about a year and a half on a few projects, mainly the upcoming Shanghai Disneyland. Going to try to not give too much detail here, as I am bound by NDA on almost... everything.   I was only there for a year and a half, so it's a bit hard to say. I mainly worked on things for the just fully announced Shanghai Disneyland that's to be completed very soon, so that's super exciting! It was super cool hearing the announcement and knowing I was a part of that. Most people really don't understand just how much work goes into making the rides. Literally every detail of the experience is thought out and worked on for countless hours. Things that people would never stop to notice often have employees spending hundreds of hours on to get just right.  I got referred in by a friend. It seems to be the most common way to get into Imagineering. Keep going at it! Imagineering is way, way cool to be a part of and is definitely a special place to be. Nevertheless, it is still a job and might not quite be the fairy tale it's often made out to be. Networking is key to getting in, at least in my experience! I enjoyed working on everything. There's not much work there that is actually pointless, since everything has a pretty solid contribution to the end product (in my case, a theme park). It gets a bit slow sometimes but I think on average, the work there is pretty enjoyable.    Just a bit of background, I'm an Electrical Engineer who recently graduated undergrad.

My last time was 2 years ago.  The last scene is the same as it always was except they have a flat screen tv and a laptop.  Really this thing needs to be expandable and show how life has changed in the last 40 years since it was made.  Another idea would be to move it out to an area near downtown Disney and make it a show that people can see who are staying at the park.  While you are at it you could start making shows and concerts there for people staying in at the park - which would be yet another draw.....

IAmA,3e0dcf,_tx,69,Tue Jul 21 00:02:21 2015 UTC,"Paul- Battlebots for sure! Destroying robots is awesome. Also, in FRC, I am a mentor, not a student, so the robot isn't really ""mine"" as much as an entire team's.  Cory- I've done FRC for 15 years and this is my first time doing Battlebots, so it's a little tough to compare. Battlebots is very different than FRC in that everything is ""just get it done"". It doesn't have to be pretty, it just has to work. That's a big departure from how we work on 254, so it took some getting used to. I think it's definitely more exciting seeing something get destroyed (come on...Icewave/Tombstone ripping people in half...or forklifts stacking boxes?) and it's a lot of fun modding the robot on the fly to better match up with future opponents (shoutout to the Lincoln Electric welding guys that sponsored the event and spent countless hours helping us improve the bot). FRC has the advantage of working to help inspire high school students, which is also a lot of fun.  Travis-Both have their pluses and minuses.  FRC is really about the team experience and inspiring students.  Battlebots can do the same, but also has the ability to allow individuals to do everything themselves.  I grew up and was inspired by BattleBots as a kid.  Robots are robots, as far as I am concerned, but FRC was the easier and more approachable means to getting involved as a high school student.  The barrier to entry was a little less.  As an adult, Battlebots  has fewer restrictions.  It isn't just about inspiration.  Adults can drive the robots and have fun in different ways.  Helping Paul as much as I could and doing both FRC and Battlebots this last season has been extremely rewarding.  I wouldn't rank one higher than the other."

IAmA,3e0dcf,Angry_Table_Flipper,57,Tue Jul 21 00:13:58 2015 UTC,How did the judges decide in the match vs. Overhaul?
IAmA,3e0dcf,AndyDoopz,98,Tue Jul 21 00:04:53 2015 UTC,"Disclaimer: We are not the judges, nor speak for them.  I (Paul) have judged combat robot and other events before, it is not fun or easy. I assume they decided mostly on the length of time of ""controlling the match"" and ""aggression"" as a slight edge for us. The essence is, about 2 minutes in our favor, a minute in their favor.  After the clock stopped, we remotely self righted and drove to our starting square, demonstrating there was zero damage. The judges I assume went in to verify that. (or to admire the robot's beauty!)"
IAmA,3e0dcf,exoscoriae,27,Tue Jul 21 00:28:14 2015 UTC,"Your bot really does look good. The white, black and blue with the sleek industrial design, man I want one but I wouldn't know what to do with it."

IAmA,3e0dcf,CornflakeJustice,6,Tue Jul 21 16:14:00 2015 UTC,That guy with the cat ears... I wanted to rip them off of his head and eat them.
IAmA,3e0dcf,MyifanW,2,Tue Jul 21 17:49:07 2015 UTC,"We'd love to have you come to Boston and eat the cat ears (email us to coordinate). If you can't make it out, I'd recommend you find a 3d printer and print your own for consumption."
IAmA,3e0dcf,Sunderpool,4,Tue Jul 21 18:24:18 2015 UTC,"Yeeeessss thank you. What even is that dance? It's not even in sync. Plus the main guy, the red hair kid looks just like an annoying guy I know in real life  There's just this feeling that they think they're sooo much better.  ""I didn't like the late hit"" has become an inside joke of sorts between me and my friends who watch it."
IAmA,3e0dcf,FriendlySceptic,4,Tue Jul 21 16:27:10 2015 UTC,"That was my view of the fight as well, yeah. Their one minute was a little more aggressive than your two, but all told, you were still in control for longer.  You vs. Overhaul was probably my favourite fight so far this season. I'm disappointed there aren't more battles that go the distance like that, but I guess that's what happens when they add the moving weapon requirement."
IAmA,3e0dcf,Qwyxand,3,Tue Jul 21 12:34:45 2015 UTC,"I wanted to mention that I'm impressed with the design overall and love the treads with magnets idea! How has that worked our for you as far as affecting the bot's control?  Also, thanks for knocking out Overhaul. I'm sure they're great builders and probably nice folks but I really liked Lockjaw!"
IAmA,3e0dcf,RA2lover,2,Tue Jul 21 10:39:29 2015 UTC,"When you had Overhaul against the wall, did you let them go on purpose? It looked like the situation was sufficiently stuck- they had no wheels on the ground.  Is there a rule against uh... excessive holding, or something? Like, if you grappled them in a position neither of you could move but you were ""dominant,"" can you just keep that position?"
IAmA,3e0dcf,BrainSlurper,25,Tue Jul 21 13:31:23 2015 UTC,Are hazards controlled by someone or are they set to be randomly controlled by a computer?
IAmA,3e0dcf,Sebastian_341,32,Tue Jul 21 00:27:00 2015 UTC,"The hammers in the corners are controlled by the team members.  The other hazards are all controlled randomly by the field controller computer. There were some parameters, like that they would introduce one new hazard per round (screws, then the ""hellraiser"" posts that popped up, then the saws, then the big flipper panels in the middle of the box) and that they would wait until later in the match to activate the random hazards."
IAmA,3e0dcf,BigBlueSaw,12,Tue Jul 21 00:48:32 2015 UTC,The hammer never seemed to do much damage for its size. Was it more intimidating irl?
IAmA,3e0dcf,SinisterTitan,24,Tue Jul 21 15:29:06 2015 UTC,Would you rather have Bite Force fight 10 30 pound Tombstones or one 300 pound Tentoumushi?
IAmA,3e0dcf,flashisflamable,20,Tue Jul 21 00:44:08 2015 UTC,10 30 lb tombstones for sure...it's difficult to fight a really large robot.
IAmA,3e0dcf,WhoahCanada,11,Tue Jul 21 01:16:29 2015 UTC,"Do you think you'd have a chance against a ""tentonmushi""?"

What are your design principles as a robot builder?  What are your best practices for really good strategic analysis? As an aside, how do you like Big Blue Saw as a sponsor?  Thanks!"
IAmA,3e0dcf,ragbagger,35,Tue Jul 21 00:06:27 2015 UTC,"Design principles- 1. Heavy on the design and planning side, then quick implementation 2. Design within your means, and for manufacturability 3. (battlebots) have 4 wheel drive minimum, low center-of-gravity, and a way to get underneath your opponent.  Strategy- 1. Drive slowly, spin and aim, then move. Keep the business end pointed at your opponent. 2. Be calm, one mistake can cost you the match.  Big Blue Saw- They were awesome! I have known Simon (owner) for years, and he ""gets it"". High quality parts, very quickly. Also, instant quotes are awesome. No other waterjet shops do that."
IAmA,3e0dcf,ragbagger,12,Tue Jul 21 00:36:00 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  BTW, Aptyx Designs has been doing a great job as a sponsored team: plenty of social  media interaction which mentions Big Blue Saw."

IAmA,3e0dcf,Zoccihedron,36,Tue Jul 21 00:27:52 2015 UTC,"The robot treads were not damaged at all in Episode 5.  The episode was actually cut off before you could see the robot independently self-right, drive away, and go back to the starting square with the clamping jaws and lifting forks operational. (If you look at the shot of the judges assessing Bite Force, you'll notice that Bite Force had already driven back to the square)."
IAmA,3e0dcf,seanmurphy505,14,Tue Jul 21 00:51:57 2015 UTC,Oh god I need to know this.  The whole match was crazy.
IAmA,3e0dcf,Zoccihedron,16,Tue Jul 21 00:35:22 2015 UTC,It was a very back and forth and tough match! Very crazy to have re-seen it on TV last night.

IAmA,3e0dcf,smstarkiller,13,Tue Jul 21 00:27:10 2015 UTC,"For helping out my career, Battlebots has helped a lot! My first job was at Boston Dynamics, where I was interviewed by a Battlebots veteran, and he had been given my name by the Battlebots creators. I also worked at Double Robotics, which was created and owned by Battlebots people, Marc DeVidts and David Cann. Finally, people message me out of the blue with job contract possibilities based on seeing my robots."
IAmA,3e0dcf,Zoccihedron,15,Tue Jul 21 02:08:48 2015 UTC,Paul - ICEwave  Cory - Bronco...in a landslide. Totally badass.  Teena - Witch Doctor. Good robot with cool imagery  JJ - Beta. They were next to us in the pits and we were very disappointed that they were unable to make it in the box. They have a massive hammer that can actually do serious damage.  Travis - Bronco (I loved Toro from the old Battlebots).
IAmA,3e0dcf,smstarkiller,4,Tue Jul 21 00:53:30 2015 UTC,"Beta! That bot looked so cool, and seemed like it had good principles, build and materials as well. Sad we didn't get to see it in action. I heard it was meant to go up against Tombstone, and I think would have stood a very good chance."
IAmA,3e0dcf,Zoccihedron,13,Tue Jul 21 11:35:16 2015 UTC,Whose idea were the magnets?  And how difficult was the process of getting them to stay attached to the treads?  Thanks for doing this AMA!  My current flair over at /r/battlebots (shoutout!) is Bite Force. Love your bot and love the show.
IAmA,3e0dcf,smstarkiller,24,Tue Jul 21 00:05:14 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Magnets have been used by many robots for additional traction for 10+ years that I know of in robot combat. I do not know who the first person was. I used them first back in 2004 on my middleweight Hazard style robot.  The magnets all have a center hole, and are screwed into the center of each tread... so in that sense, they were simple. On the flip side, we picked up more bot-fragments from the arena floor than anybody else."
IAmA,3e0dcf,Nick331hog,14,Tue Jul 21 00:54:03 2015 UTC,Screws!  Of course. I had visions of you guys trying out dozens of types of epoxy.   So Bite Force is also the janitor bot. Hope you got paid a little extra for cleaning up.

IAmA,3e0dcf,tballer4596,3,Tue Jul 21 11:47:51 2015 UTC,These are the real questions.
IAmA,3e0dcf,picklesitter,11,Tue Jul 21 00:29:56 2015 UTC,"How would one go about breaking into the sport of robot combat? It seems that the resources required to build the big robots (and even the small ones), and not get absolutely wrecked, have gone through the roof in the time since the Comedy Central series aired. I remember things like scrapped wheelchair motors and batteries being pretty standard, nowadays, it seems everyone has CNC machining, high performance alloys, top of the line motors, and so on. Is there still a way to do this on the cheap? I'm quite familiar with the tech and skills involved, but don't feel like I have anywhere near the funds or manufacturing resources to do this, not to mention living on the wrong side of the country.   Related, how does a Battlebots team go about getting sponsored? I've been reasonably successful at soliciting donations for FRC, but there, you're reliant almost entirely on the ""inspire students"" angle, which is less viable for a broke recent college grad and a couple buddies trying to do it solo to take. It seems as though a lot of sponsorship is in the vein of ""You're a proven builder, so we'll donate product X for you to showcase in your presumably awesome robot,"" which circles back to question one -- how do you get there to begin with without many resources?"
IAmA,3e0dcf,JLaFs,15,Tue Jul 21 00:15:33 2015 UTC,"Simon here. We sponsored Bite Force partly because of Paul's fantastic track record, it's true. But more significant is the ability to engage and spread the word about Big Blue Saw via social media, etc. We've sponsored other non-robot projects simply because the project owners were good with using Twitter, Facebook, reddit, etc.  Also, as a robot builder, I have to say that you really want to get started in the lower weight classes. My personal favorite competition is Dragon*Con Robot Battles here in Atlanta.  Finally, it's still possible to build a  competitive robot for the lower weight classes by scavenging and looking around for deals."
IAmA,3e0dcf,EntropyInTheUK,26,Tue Jul 21 00:59:39 2015 UTC,How does it feel to have the inventor of Capri Sun on your team?
IAmA,3e0dcf,abyssmalstar,28,Tue Jul 21 00:24:18 2015 UTC,It's news to us that Travis invented the Capri Sun...he's wondering where his royalty checks are. The 254 mentors do like their Capri Sun though.

IAmA,3e0dcf,hibrawler,7,Tue Jul 21 06:56:21 2015 UTC,"Big fan here, I was wondering where the Center of Gravity was on your bot, and if you hoped the downforce from the magnets would aid in that. One thing I noticed was whenever  you tried to pick up another robot, you all would end up picking your own bot up. My theory was that the CoG was too high.  Related, were the magnet-treads worth it?  Third, What do you think is the coolest robotics project going on (or similar science project)"
IAmA,3e0dcf,paniconenvy,11,Tue Jul 21 00:05:22 2015 UTC,"This robot was designed and built in just under 8 weeks. It constantly changed on the fly. The center of gravity was too far forewards, not too high, that is what gave me difficulty in tipping forward while lifting Overhaul.  The ""wedgelets"" out in front had hard stops to try and prevent the robot from tipping forward, but they were not forward enough.  I did originally hope that the magnets would be able to add enough force to keep us planted, however, there was not enough time to test and tune the magent force to make it strong enough. Although the TV talks up the magnet power a lot, that was more of a planned in thing, then an actually executed thing. For this event, the magnets didn't add much. I and others have used much more powerful ones in the past."
IAmA,3e0dcf,Fire2box,8,Tue Jul 21 00:48:36 2015 UTC,"Hello from NASA in Mountain View!  A lot of people are talking about the anti-bot specific defense system used against Ice Wave. What's the rule on switching out your main weapon mid-competition? Are you allowed to just throw a blade on your bot if you wanted? What would be your ""Anti-Bite"" weapon someone could use against you (specifically to counter/avoid you, not just chop to pieces)?"
IAmA,3e0dcf,_tx,6,Tue Jul 21 00:47:11 2015 UTC,"Hi! We love Ames (Team 254 works in a lab there for the FIRST Robotics Competition).  You have the freedom to make pretty much any modification you want to your robot mid event, so long as it satisfies the safety rules and the requirement that you must have an active weapon. Ghost Raptor was very good at making mid-event changes once their spinner broke.   Our game is to get underneath the opponent and either pick them up or shove them around...So the super weapon to counter us (but not destroy us) would be to have a wedge or spikes that ride along the ground and get under our wedge/forks."
IAmA,3e0dcf,FryGuy1013,11,Tue Jul 21 01:30:54 2015 UTC,Your fight against Warhead was probably the most entertaining match until Stinger took on Tombstone.  My question is: What is your favorite ice cream flavor?

IAmA,3e0dcf,dsmitherines,19,Tue Jul 21 00:38:30 2015 UTC,"Cory: Thank you!  After playing Warhead, our wedge was effectively destroyed. It didn't look too damaged on TV, but the mounting trusses were lightened a little too aggressively, which caused them to completely cave in. We stayed up until 2 AM designing a new wedge on Thursday night that was laser cut Friday morning and then welded up on site by the Lincoln Electric welding guys (Thanks, Lon!). This is the wedge you saw in the Hypershock match. We spent a lot of time modifying that wedge to potentially face Tombstone or ICEwave, in the event we made it far enough to face them.  Other than that, we mostly did routine maintenance. Making sure that drive chains were tensioned properly, that the treads weren't stretching too much, replacing magnets and rubber bumpers on the treads (this had to take place every single match...and was awful. There were something like 250 rubber bumpers on the treads), checking to make sure all the bolts on the bot were snugged down, etc.  At one point we discovered after a match that we had a bad drive gearbox causing one side of the drive to drag intermittently.  I forget which match it occurred before, but we were doing a pre-match test of the robot minutes before going to the box...and the entire electrical system of the robot appeared to be shorted and non functional. We had to scramble to diagnose the problem and test every connection to each speed controller in about 5 minutes. We nearly got replaced by a backup bot, but eventually discovered an extra circuit on a speed controller that was powering the radio receiver was causing the problem. We were able to replace it and make it out in the box just in the nick of time."

IAmA,3e0dcf,teamtestbot,21,Tue Jul 21 00:12:08 2015 UTC,"Absolutely! I have been obsessed with Battlebots for my entire life. I always hope to be able to compete. I want to build something destructive again like my last robot, Brutality, but with a new design. We hope to compete in as many different robotic combat events as possible (Such as Robogames).   We need everyone to keep watching the show so it can close out with strong ratings and hopefully seal the deal on a second season.  We are not tied to using Bite Force again and are always interested in building new things. For this season, the designs were highly curated by ABC, which lead to some design decisions being made on the basis of what would cater to the producer's wants as opposed to what might be the most destructive/cool. We are hoping to have a little more freedom in what we potentially build  for a future season."

IAmA,3e0dcf,The_Zone5,6,Tue Jul 21 06:20:06 2015 UTC,How much extra down-force did the magnets produce? Do you think they made much of a difference?
IAmA,3e0dcf,The_Zone5,12,Tue Jul 21 00:19:35 2015 UTC,"The magnets actually added very little downforce in this configuration, maybe 50-75 lbs at most. I planned on being able to add hundreds of lbs of force, but we ran out of time to test and properly finish and tune the robot. So no, I do not think they made much difference.  Getting underneath your opponent makes all the difference in the world! In the past, in my old robot, Brutality, I have had several hundred pounds of downforce which has helped a lot fighting against vertical spinners."

IAmA,3e37zd,holyscalpel,4,Tue Jul 21 16:46:39 2015 UTC,So let me ask the basic question - why do you need a robot ? How is a robot better than the surgeon directly doing the same procedure ?
IAmA,3e37zd,desiWonder,4,Tue Jul 21 17:05:56 2015 UTC,"So - that's THE question, right?  The main thing I use it for is facilitating what can be a very difficult dissection of the pelvis.  Operating on cancer in the pelvis has two good analogies:  1) it's like playing Jenga where someone's life is at stake 2) it's like trying to get a redbull can out of a coke can without touching the sides.  Yes, just like ""operation"" the board game.  if you touch the sides you can cause infection, urine leakage, infection, impotence, or even make the patient bleed to death."
IAmA,3e37zd,desiWonder,3,Tue Jul 21 17:17:00 2015 UTC,"But the robot is not autonomous. You control it's movement. So is the robot in asynchronous mode sometimes - and other times there is no lag between you doing something, and the robot doing it  If the robot is always in a synchronous mode, if you suddenly twitch, I would guess the robot would mirror your actions."
IAmA,3e37zd,desiWonder,3,Tue Jul 21 17:24:27 2015 UTC,"It's always synchronous and I can abort its movement immediately in a split second.  Yes, if you twitch it will mirror your movement.  However, it does have a ""smoothing"" option like your mouse - never used it but it's there"
IAmA,3e37zd,desiWonder,2,Tue Jul 21 17:35:49 2015 UTC,"Since medicine in the US is so expensive, how much does the robot cost and how expensive would the surgeries be with & without a robot ? Finally, how much better are the results - mortality rates, healing rates and so on."
IAmA,3e37zd,-Tim-maC-,4,Tue Jul 21 17:08:03 2015 UTC,"The cost to the patient is 1500$ - but that is almost always covered by insurance after the deductible.  However, that cost is often recouped, at least partially, by not using other ""disposable"" surgical instruments like an energy device or stapler  The recent publication of the ROLARR trial shows some benefit to morbidity in males that are young, but otherwise no difference in major outcomes for cancer.  The question is then ""WHY ROBOTS?!?""   The hidden concern is that surgeons make more money or get paid to use the robot - there is no difference in payment to your doctor regardless of what form of minimally invasive surgery he/she performs.  Plainly, if you use laparoscopy (like a gall bladder, for instance) or the robot you get paid the same for the work you do.  Simply, the abilities that the robot gives you to perform specific maneuvers have made several surgeries possible for my patients that I couldn't have ever done without it.  Recently, I was able to prevent a 35 year-old man with very rare cancer from having a permanent colostomy and having to cut out his anus COMPLETELY by using the robot in a way that no other surgery could have done."

IAmA,3e37zd,ichegoya,2,Tue Jul 21 17:38:09 2015 UTC,"that's a really good question - and especially pertinent when you do essentially a handful of basic operations on the same thing time and again.  It's easy to feel like a mechanic, occasionally.  However, that doesn't last long and you remember why you got 500,000$ in debt and spent 16 years training after high school.  And you know who snaps you out of it fastest?  The little old ladies.  They are so sweet and kind.  And when they come back for a cancer check up in Fall and Winter - they bring pie.  Oh, the PIE!  Seriously, burnout is huge among cancer doctors.  I had a lady die from metastatic disease I couldn't fix on Sunday, and another lady will likely do the same today.  it's depressing and every time it happens I have to call my wife and say ""Someone died - I love you.""

The robot is actually a method of translating your gross motor movements into VERY fine motor movements inside the patient.  Think ""Minority Report"" glove thing but with the ability to control the scale of movement like you do mouse sensitivity in an FPS.    The whole thing together is pretty big as you can see.  the console is about the size of a desk.  The tower is 3x3 feet and usually 8 feet tall with the hoses to run the equipment.  The Dr. Octopus looking thing with the arms (the ""patient cart"") is what goes inside the patient and deployed it is 8 feet tall and about 5 feet wide.    It is entirely guided by the surgeon.  It is really just a huge glove box essentially.  It is awesome for pelvic surgery or surgery in a small space.  It is TERRIBLE for anything you need to do fast.

However after a month or so i realised the  slaves are well watered, fed and sheltered and they seem to be happy enough. To be fair, the plantation is all they have ever known so i do not feel it is cruel as such. A few months ago, my neighbour took four of the slaves that were going to ""get hung"" and he keeps them free range and i have to say, they do look a lot happier.

I assume that your chickens are used for both eggs and meat, but where do you get new chicks from if the eggs produced are left unfertilized? Do you have separate eggs/chickens for fertilizing and eggs/chickens for consumption?"
IAmA,3e3gvc,vinochick,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:15:09 2015 UTC,"Good question. We buy in all of our hens from a company that breed, hatch and nurture them till they are 20 weeks old. The hens are then delivered to us at 20 weeks old and start laying at around 22-24 weeks old. Our company is solely for egg production but once the chickens reach 70 weeks old we sell them on to a further company which slaughters them for meat."

I have one question for you then a few follow ups if the answer to the first is Yes:  Do you contract farm chickens for one of the four major chicken companies? (Purdue, Sunshine Farms, Tyson and I forget the last)  How would they feel about you doing this AMA?  How do you feel about the recent ""breach of contract"" some farmers have been doing to bring awareness to the awful standards and practices being forced on chicken farmers from these corporations?  Best of luck to you and I hope more and more people are becoming aware of the substandard crap these corp are putting you and if not you then most of your colleagues through.   EDIT: After reading through some of your replies, I think you may be from the UK or at least not the states so I believe your meat standards are a lot higher than the USDA and I can tell from your pic that you are raising much ""happier"" chicks for a way longer period time (70 weeks) than what is standard with those 4 major corps (about 12-14 weeks) My question still stands though somewhat as to how you feel about what these major corps are doing to US chicken farmers. If you need a reference on it, John Oliver does a great job explaining how these corp screw over US chicken farmers - long but worth it if you're in the industry."

Haha). You're also a big reason why my dad and I started repairing our relationship. We had both been very angry and depressed after my parents split up, but you and that first season of TUF started airing and we started talking more and now we're closer than we've ever been. A lot of that is our journey to find our own peace and happiness but it all started with getting together each week to watch you on the show. So thank you.   I really enjoyed your career in MMA.

Why question is, what do you think of the current state of the unified rules of MMA? Is there any rule that you would like to get rid of, or a rule that you would like to add to it? Also, do you have any idea of how to improve the judging of MMA fights? Cheers!"
IAmA,3dz3vg,bloYolbies,20,Mon Jul 20 19:12:45 2015 UTC,"good questions... more people should be asking. you know, one rule I think should be changed is, for example Who remembers wanderley silva jumping up and soccer kicks opponents in the head... back in pride now, how many fights that we paid good money for, excited to see. but they are stopped, fighters get stuck on the cage, one tiny elbow cuts the face, doctors comes and waives the fight is over..  I say we trade elbows with Soccer kicks!!!!!!"
IAmA,3dz3vg,TrademarkMMA,8,Mon Jul 20 20:23:42 2015 UTC,"Hey Chris, I remember enjoying watching you back on TUF.  Do you feel you were portrayed fairly on the show?  Would you change anything about the way you acted when you were a contestant?  How would you say you're different now (if you feel you are) from the way you were back then?  Thanks, and I always enjoyed watching your fights!"
IAmA,3dz3vg,SuperiorJazzHands,13,Mon Jul 20 19:26:10 2015 UTC,"funny!!! they film you 24h of day, to make 40 minutes of tv per week. They can portray you they way they want, saint or complete asshole. They filmed me to look asshole. Especially beginning of the show, then nicer"
IAmA,3dz3vg,SuperiorJazzHands,6,Mon Jul 20 20:08:09 2015 UTC,"Man, you were my favorite on that show and have been a fan ever since, and ALWAYS rooted against Koshchek. That guy has such a punchable face and a shitty attitude."
IAmA,3dz3vg,Brandunn0511,7,Mon Jul 20 21:45:20 2015 UTC,i think you ended up as one of the most likable guys by the end of the season. I was rooting for you by the end!
IAmA,3dz3vg,Brandunn0511,21,Mon Jul 20 21:11:51 2015 UTC,Do you believe the UFC treats fighters the way they should? How do you feel about the Reebok deal?
IAmA,3dz3vg,1standarduser,13,Mon Jul 20 19:02:19 2015 UTC,Crickets chirping.
IAmA,3dz3vg,of-maus-and-men,2,Mon Jul 20 23:17:10 2015 UTC,Was partially answered lower down in the AMA.
IAmA,3dz3vg,IFLSciencePhil,5,Mon Jul 20 23:43:52 2015 UTC,were the injuries worth the money and the fame?
IAmA,3dz3vg,PhillipCarey,18,Mon Jul 20 19:32:02 2015 UTC,"its worth it, even without the money and fame it would have. Martial Arts saved my life. fighting saved my life"
IAmA,3dz3vg,thorsdisciple,6,Mon Jul 20 20:03:24 2015 UTC,Were there any fixed fights that you know of in the UFC or other organizations?
IAmA,3dz3vg,TheLapHog,9,Mon Jul 20 20:17:32 2015 UTC,"not that I know for sure.... there has been one or two that have been questionable when watching... outside the UFC in smaller org, yes for sure."
IAmA,3dz3vg,Mikey1ee7,2,Mon Jul 20 20:47:51 2015 UTC,Thanks man appreciate the time your taking out to do this!
IAmA,3dz3vg,FISHneedWATER,9,Mon Jul 20 20:57:58 2015 UTC,"Chris you are one of my favorite fighters.  Thanks for being a pioneer and for giving us everything you had. My favorite moment of your career was when you tapped out Sexyama after stepping up on short notice.  Not enough fighters do that.  My question to you, sir, is:  what is your favorite hangover remedy?    Hope life is treating you well!"
IAmA,3dz3vg,the_dubster,16,Mon Jul 20 18:59:19 2015 UTC,"over the years I had a few of them hehe Early to mid 20ths , my favorite method was to wake up pound to big glass of water, sprint as fast I could until I would throw up... Then I was good!!!  Get it all out!"
IAmA,3dz3vg,johnjohnson12,6,Mon Jul 20 19:23:30 2015 UTC,"Oh man that brings up another great memory from your career, when you partied your ass off the night before that big cardio exercise on TUF.  Everyone thought you were going to die and you ended up kicking ass.    You are the man Chris.  Thanks for being you and for answering my question."

IAmA,3dz3vg,AndersonPenn,4,Mon Jul 20 20:16:13 2015 UTC,"Wow, just wanted to say what an honor it was watching your fights and your balls to the wall style.  Regarding your buddy Short Fuse, I was at a bar in Vegas winning some serious $ off of Serra V GSP and Kos V Diego when I saw Mr. Herman with his girlfriend.  I was gonna buy them a round and say hi but he looked, as usual, very pissed.  Should I have gone up and said hi?  Big fan of his as well, oh well..."
IAmA,3dz3vg,shinyblastoise,14,Mon Jul 20 19:45:00 2015 UTC,"hahaha Absolutely you should have gone up to him and say: ""Chris Leben I am your biggest fan!!""  That actually happened... So IF SOMEONE SEES ED HERMAN; YOU HAVE TO WALK UP TO HIM AnD SAY HI"

IAmA,3dz3vg,loserlame,6,Mon Jul 20 20:04:14 2015 UTC,"Hey Chris been a huge fan of you ever since TUF, followed your career through the ups and downs and just wanted to say I'm proud of you for getting back up when you were down - I know what it feels like to be so far down a rabbit hole that it's hard to see a way out.  My question is do you still roll? Actively train at all? I was just curious if you still practice bjj as rolling has been a huge asset for my sobriety and continued sanity"
IAmA,3dz3vg,Yohnstoppable,12,Mon Jul 20 18:37:47 2015 UTC,"Yes, of course!!! I will never stop grappling, even when I cant walk anymore I will still play guard game..  I will never stop learning, will always grow and get better in training."

You were one of the toughest fighters in UFC and also one of the most exciting ones, just getting this out there for people that might not know you well.   Now, for my questions:  1) What did you think of the Lawler/MacDonald fight?   2) What are you up to nowadays?  3) Who is the most exciting young prospect currently in UFC in your opinion?  4) What do you think about Anderson Silva being on PED's? Did it surprise you anyhow?  5) Did MMA left some ""scars""(worse remembering/thinking, headaches etc.) on you, or you feel the same as you were before entering MMA world?"

I have a great new job coaching, radio show with ESPN RADIO called www.unfilteredmma.com couple of interesting gigs end of 2015 and the release of my book. I will do good.."
IAmA,3dz3vg,tickle_me_not,3,Mon Jul 20 20:05:43 2015 UTC,Hey Mr. Leben!! Huge fan here...What was the worst situation you ever put yourself in with regards to preparing for a fight?   (I ask this question as someone who used to indulge in drugs and often questioned my own reason for putting myself in such shitty situations so frequently)
IAmA,3dz3vg,JimmyZL1,6,Mon Jul 20 19:35:40 2015 UTC,"my book is coming out end of 2015, I have done alot of them. Youwill find some good stories there, being dope sick and fighting, hangover etc.  Check out my book for sure!!"

IAmA,3dz3vg,CameHereForChael,5,Mon Jul 20 23:18:36 2015 UTC,"What was your weight cut like? How much did you cut, and what was your diet like say 8 weeks out and how did it change 1 week out? What did you like to eat after weigh ins/before your fights?"
IAmA,3dz3vg,Flailed,4,Mon Jul 20 18:59:47 2015 UTC,you know early in my ufc career
IAmA,3dz3vg,MrRANDOMDUDE,7,Mon Jul 20 19:49:44 2015 UTC,"My weight cut was ridiculous, nut because I am the biggest guy in the 185lb division, it was because of my other hobbies. Getting drunk eating bar food. My biggest weigh cut was against J Riveria, I showed up in vegas at 212Lb, just days prior the fight!!"
IAmA,3dz3vg,Ranndym,7,Mon Jul 20 19:51:12 2015 UTC,"Since then, 2nd half of my career I started do things smarter. As far as week of the fights, most people cut out the water too early. 3 days prior the weigh I switch to distilled water, drink 3 gallons a day. I cut salt completely!  My trick is I pound water exactly 24h before I am getting on the scale. You can cut all the water withing the short time frame. you trick the body, pound as much as possible, then no more fluids until scale. So it tricks the body to dump all the water..."
IAmA,3dz3vg,Ballacaust3000,2,Mon Jul 20 19:54:04 2015 UTC,Hey Chris!   What fight of yours do you think was the best? And who would you rematch given the chance?
IAmA,3dz3vg,Ichibankakoi,9,Mon Jul 20 18:59:17 2015 UTC,"best fight; Otto Olson and      Benji Radach, great fights. I love a good rocky story.  Rematch; Brian Stann!!! I was sick going into this fight, and funny he knew exactly what my game plan was ;)) lol"

Thanks for the time man."
IAmA,3dzexc,Alltruenews,39,Mon Jul 20 19:47:08 2015 UTC,Hey. I'm a heart transplant survivor in the UK. Had mine 30 years ago and still going strong. Just wanted to wish you all the best. How long were you hospital?
IAmA,3dzexc,ThursdayNext10,27,Mon Jul 20 23:04:05 2015 UTC,Congratulations! Good for you.   I was in for about 16 days after transplant. I was a mess when I left.

IAmA,3dzexc,ThursdayNext10,2,Mon Jul 20 23:36:17 2015 UTC,What kind of defect did you have?
IAmA,3dzexc,mommieoma,2,Tue Jul 21 01:20:57 2015 UTC,congenital cardiomyopathy. I was really unwell. I think I was a few weeks from death when I had my op. I was very lucky.
IAmA,3dzexc,schoocher,3,Tue Jul 21 06:35:45 2015 UTC,Wow that's amazing!
IAmA,3dzexc,glitzyjan,4,Mon Jul 20 23:57:17 2015 UTC,"30 years?  Wow...   how old were you?  The avg for heart transplant is 10 years, so that's amazing."
IAmA,3dzexc,glitzyjan,6,Tue Jul 21 01:39:18 2015 UTC,My boyfriends sister is coming up on 26 years. She's pretty much the poster child of the Ottawa heart institute for someone who did everything right when she got her transplant.
IAmA,3dzexc,ShooTa666,24,Tue Jul 21 02:45:58 2015 UTC,What is something that you can do now that you couldn't do before that makes you thankful to your donor?
IAmA,3dzexc,mommieoma,50,Mon Jul 20 19:50:06 2015 UTC,"Walk, leave the house, take a shower, dress myself, travel, basically lead a normal life."
IAmA,3dzexc,LostInTheMaze,17,Mon Jul 20 19:55:02 2015 UTC,That's amazing. All the things we take for granted.
IAmA,3dzexc,MindlessElectrons,19,Mon Jul 20 21:08:13 2015 UTC,I know! My whole life is entirely different now.
IAmA,3dzexc,IAMATiger-AskMeStuff,20,Mon Jul 20 21:33:33 2015 UTC,Are you now a donor?
IAmA,3dzexc,howisthisnotused,28,Mon Jul 20 20:45:09 2015 UTC,I've always been.
IAmA,3dzexc,macpatrik,16,Mon Jul 20 21:22:41 2015 UTC,Unfortunately when you are a recipient you can't be a donor because of the damage the immunosuppressive drugs do to organs
IAmA,3dzexc,iOats,8,Mon Jul 20 23:47:38 2015 UTC,Interesting to know!
IAmA,3dzexc,Clob,3,Mon Jul 20 23:50:11 2015 UTC,"Why wouldn't they take donors of ""grade B"" organs for people that would be rejected from the ""grade A"" transplant list.  They don't have much to lose."

IAmA,3dzexc,iOats,3,Tue Jul 21 01:18:17 2015 UTC,There is definitely a reason doctors call them donorcycles.
IAmA,3dzexc,MsNewKicks,34,Tue Jul 21 02:08:17 2015 UTC,What did they do with your original heart?
IAmA,3dzexc,A_Cheeky_Fuck,39,Mon Jul 20 20:40:29 2015 UTC,They do an autopsy on it and then it's burned with hospital waste.
IAmA,3dzexc,A_Cheeky_Fuck,28,Mon Jul 20 21:22:26 2015 UTC,I would like to keep it if it was me.
IAmA,3dzexc,Kabulamongoni,30,Mon Jul 20 21:25:03 2015 UTC,They never gave me the chance.
IAmA,3dzexc,DDRTxp,5,Mon Jul 20 21:50:42 2015 UTC,"I feel like that is super fucked up. Like perform an autopsy... But give it back. Nothing is more ""yours"" than your heart."
IAmA,3dzexc,schoocher,3,Tue Jul 21 02:06:15 2015 UTC,"Uh well...he did get a new, better heart. So I wouldn't go so far as to say super fucked up."
IAmA,3dzexc,arcticfoxtrotter,5,Tue Jul 21 03:08:13 2015 UTC,It's like car batteries. You gotta turn in the old one.
IAmA,3dzexc,TRAUMAjunkie,6,Tue Jul 21 07:05:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, like Clob said, were you allowed to keep it if you wanted?"
IAmA,3dzexc,mesropa,13,Mon Jul 20 21:50:42 2015 UTC,"No, it was never offered or spoke of. It's kind of a serious environment and they don't deal well with requests."
IAmA,3dzexc,arcticfoxtrotter,12,Mon Jul 20 22:04:45 2015 UTC,What were your symptoms?
IAmA,3dzexc,schoocher,25,Mon Jul 20 19:50:44 2015 UTC,I started having trouble sleeping. I would wake up in a panic. I later found out that my heart failure was causing my lungs to fill with fluid. They found blood clots in my heart and I was pumping at only 15%.
IAmA,3dzexc,secretpandalord,10,Mon Jul 20 19:53:56 2015 UTC,Any idea as to what caused the heart failure at 52? Overweight? Bad diet? genetics?
IAmA,3dzexc,AlmightyNeckbeardo,22,Mon Jul 20 20:14:21 2015 UTC,It was 100% genetic. They did the testing. I've always led a clean life (which helped me get listed.) They're VERY selective regarding who gets listed.
IAmA,3dzexc,BoxDroppingManApe,10,Mon Jul 20 20:17:23 2015 UTC,Oh wow - that is truly unfortunate.
IAmA,3dzexc,drphildobaggins,13,Mon Jul 20 20:20:05 2015 UTC,"Here in the U.S. donors are hard to find so recipients are put through extreme social, financial, support, legal and criminal background checks."
IAmA,3dzexc,Petores,3,Mon Jul 20 20:26:59 2015 UTC,"Wow, I did not know that.  So someone who is a convicted felon, or maybe has a bad credit score, etc..., might be up the creek?  I guess then that if your family has a history of heart disease, you might want to keep your nose clean...."
IAmA,3dzexc,average-adventures,4,Mon Jul 20 21:28:04 2015 UTC,Bad credit score would be a red flag but not automatic denial. Criminal record would be almost always a no go. Keeping your nose clean is a must. Getting listed is like getting in to Harvard.
IAmA,3dzexc,average-adventures,2,Mon Jul 20 21:54:52 2015 UTC,Having a criminal record does not necessarily prevent a patient from receiving a transplant. It's different for each hospital and program.
IAmA,3dzexc,mommieoma,5,Mon Jul 20 22:33:18 2015 UTC,"Correct, but it is a huge factor. Do you remember the kid who had a criminal record and the hospital didn't want to list him, but public pressure made them and he had heart transplant at 15? He was later killed in a high speed chase with the cops. I think it was in Detroit."
IAmA,3dzexc,-WarHounds-,2,Mon Jul 20 22:40:36 2015 UTC,I got listed and the LVAD on a really bad credit rating (10 yrs of a severe health issue builds up bills quicker than most people can pay them).
IAmA,3dzexc,Dracon421,9,Tue Jul 21 01:41:49 2015 UTC,"Wow, the U.S. restricts heart transplants according to factors beside health? Isn't that basically eugenics?"
IAmA,3dzexc,TRAUMAjunkie,14,Mon Jul 20 21:15:09 2015 UTC,It's very subjective but the idea is that there's a very limited number of organs to give out to a very large number of people so let's give it to someone who isn't going to squander their second chance at life.
IAmA,3dzexc,JcakSnigelton,5,Mon Jul 20 21:37:03 2015 UTC,Here is a story about a guy Who squandered his second chance. link As a kidney transplant recipient from a family member I will say that the doctors were concerned because I hand mentioned that I smoked hookah (tabacco) with friends on occasion.
IAmA,3dzexc,aviguyael,2,Mon Jul 20 21:58:06 2015 UTC,I'm in the UK and it's completely shocking to me to screen by anything except health.
IAmA,3dzexc,itsjohnsnow,2,Mon Jul 20 21:38:28 2015 UTC,"Familial support is important, daily habits affecting health are important, and you also have to go through a psych evaluation.  It's a pretty comprehensive process largely in part because there is so many recipients for a limited amount of donors."
IAmA,3dzexc,schoocher,8,Tue Jul 21 01:43:25 2015 UTC,"None of the factors are incredibly distant from health, and most are just to maximize its effectiveness. Our system tends to prefer the young over the very old, non-smokers and non-drinkers over heavy smokers and drinkers, and the fit over the obese. Basically, if it's your own fault that you're broken, we have somewhat less sympathy than if you were just born broken. Obviously its not a rule, and there are tons of exceptions; if you've been waiting long enough, you might just get one regardless."
IAmA,3dzexc,itsjohnsnow,4,Mon Jul 20 22:05:17 2015 UTC,"It's not really a ""transparent"" system, but if you're a heavy drinker and smoker without a solid support network, and there's another recipient waiting who is ""clean"" .... they'll choose the non-smoker. This is because organs are really hard to come by and the hospital's want the best outcome. However, I know a drinker/smoker who got a heart transplant and she totally fucked it up."
IAmA,3dzexc,SEMiTRiCKY,2,Mon Jul 20 21:47:45 2015 UTC,"Well there is a limited supply of hearts, so if yours fails because of your own actions, doesn't that make it unfair to those who lost theirs due to genetics?"
IAmA,3dzexc,rexadoodle,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:05:55 2015 UTC,I'd say that the average age of a heart transplant recipient is high enough that the effect restrictions has on the genepool is negligible.

IAmA,3dzexc,monkeybrigade,11,Mon Jul 20 22:10:08 2015 UTC,"Now that you have had a heart transplant, is your current heart transplant-able to another person?"
IAmA,3dzexc,monkeybrigade,11,Mon Jul 20 21:18:34 2015 UTC,"I don't know for sure, but I don't think it is because they use a little tip of your old heart to sew on to the new one. I suspect that this ruins the new heart from being transplantable."
IAmA,3dzexc,JcakSnigelton,5,Mon Jul 20 21:50:10 2015 UTC,Is this to help bypass your immune system and increase acceptance?
IAmA,3dzexc,leggyblonde13,12,Mon Jul 20 22:56:17 2015 UTC,"No, it's actually done to speed up the transplant. If you cut ALL the arteries, you have to individually stitch them back, but it you use the top 1/2 inch of the old heart, you only have to stitch that on."
IAmA,3dzexc,MackLo7z,4,Mon Jul 20 23:08:52 2015 UTC,Huh. Neat! Thanks for answering!
IAmA,3dzexc,_The_Real_Guy_,3,Mon Jul 20 23:31:43 2015 UTC,My first husband had a heart transplant in 1986.  They told us then the immunosuppressive drugs cause changes and damage to your organs that prevent them from being donatable.
IAmA,3dzexc,DJKest,11,Mon Jul 20 23:56:20 2015 UTC,Did you ever doubt you would live or find a donor? I have heard many stories of people waiting years for donors and some of them sadly passing.
IAmA,3dzexc,DJKest,15,Mon Jul 20 20:04:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but it didn't occupy my mind. I used to have little mini panic attacks, but my wife held me together. I have a very large support network and I never felt alone. Long stays in the hospital were the worst. You find out what you're made of when you're waiting for an organ."
IAmA,3dzexc,thbb,11,Mon Jul 20 20:07:59 2015 UTC,Did you get to see your former organ after the operation?  How long was the road to recovery?
IAmA,3dzexc,EatGulp,10,Mon Jul 20 20:56:00 2015 UTC,"No, they don't even discuss it. I've always wondered how some people got their pictures taken with their heart."

IAmA,3dzexc,Rex8ever,9,Mon Jul 20 21:58:15 2015 UTC,"Hi there, congratulations on your transplant and ongoing recovery. I'm just curious, where you are from (i.e., country)? I study transplant systems and would like to hear your highlights and lowlights from your particular jurisdiction. Thanks."
IAmA,3dzexc,Togie25,11,Mon Jul 20 20:16:13 2015 UTC,"I'm in the Boston area in the U.S. It was a three year ordeal, so the highlights and lowlights were many. The worst was 11 months on the LVAD. The highlight was hearing that a donor heart was available."
IAmA,3dzexc,hyperocky,7,Mon Jul 20 20:21:58 2015 UTC,11 months on LVAD? That's amazing. I didn't realize ppl stayed on them for so long.  And congrats! Sounds like your new heart is strong and will take you far.
IAmA,3dzexc,NeonBodyStyle,6,Mon Jul 20 21:13:03 2015 UTC,"Thanks, yeah some people do really well on LVAD's and have them for years. They are horrible, but they do the job."
IAmA,3dzexc,transplantkid,5,Mon Jul 20 21:35:31 2015 UTC,My father has been on LVAD for about two months and is waiting to get a heart transplant.  This thread makes me feel better about the whole situation.   I'm glad you've recovered so well!!
IAmA,3dzexc,HiGodItsMeYou,5,Mon Jul 20 22:58:00 2015 UTC,"LVAD patient here. Earlier LVADs had really high mortality rates but the newer ones are MUCH MUCH better with patients living years on them.  I heard of one who was in his 3rd year with an LVAD.  Tell your dad that the first 2 months are the worst.  In addition to the pain, limited movement, dietary/fluid restrictions, a large portion of patients experience PTSTD.  The most important thing is to slowly increase activity, eat right, protect the sternotomy wound,  and keep the stomach wound clean, around 30-40% of LVAD patients end up with infections around the driveline wound.  It is also important for those around him to understand the major life change that he's been through.  He's probably a bit scared (many patients end up with PTSD, adjusting to the LVAD takes time, and the medicine changes can make your mood erratic.  Around the 3rd month though, it gets better... much much better. You still have a bag attached to you, which is a pain in the ass, but he will feel SIGNIFICANTLY better, particularly if he is doing some light exercise on a regular basis and watching his fluid/salt intake.  I was at a 5% ejection fraction and had flatlined prior to placement so they had to bump the surgery within hours instead of a week like I was scheduled.  4 months out, I can walk for 2-3 hours, lift light weights, and still have energy left.  For the first couple months, I sat in my recliner ALOT.  I also bought one of these: http://www.amazon.com/Exerpeutic-7101-Motorized-Mini-ACTIVCycle/dp/B001IV6MV6/ref=sr_1_13?ie=UTF8&qid=1437443811&sr=8-13&keywords=ergometer  No resistance and you can use it from any chair.  I can put in many hours on this little sucker."
IAmA,3dzexc,HiGodItsMeYou,2,Tue Jul 21 01:57:41 2015 UTC,"Thank you for concern and advice. I truly appreciate it and I hope your doing well for yourself too.   The good thing is my dad is doing pretty well so far. He's pretty much back to his old self and seems to be handling the change quite well. He's walking, driving and going to the gym a couple of times a week at the hospital. We have a nurse that comes to the house 3 times a week to change the driveline dressing.   He doesn't seem too concerned about the fact that he has to have two big batteries attached to him anytime he wants to go anywhere.   I'm blessed to be a 10 minute drive from University of Ottawa Heart Institute which is one of the leading heart hospitals in Canada so the doctors have made his transition to an LVAD very easy.  The only thing I'm a bit stressed out about is the wait time for a new heart which is on average 2 years I believe in Ontario.   I'm glad op did an AmA because it shows how incredible a heart transplant really is."
IAmA,3dzexc,ctully1988,3,Tue Jul 21 02:23:30 2015 UTC,Thanks. Be patient with your dad regarding anxiety or having a short temper.
IAmA,3dzexc,ctully1988,3,Mon Jul 20 23:09:41 2015 UTC,This may sound really odd to ask. But my best friend was in a tragic accident and donated many organs including his heart. I'm taking a shot in the dark but would you mind telling me if the heart came from New Jersey?
IAmA,3dzexc,ctully1988,7,Mon Jul 20 21:55:29 2015 UTC,"No, mine came from Maine. If your best friend's family receives a thank you note, they can establish contact. Here's my story. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=tHIKe6jFNTg"

He's coming to our monthly training in a couple of weeks to help us get to know his device.  I got a sneak peek of it last week and the whole setup is amazing.  However, his device has no manual backup.  If the batteries die and there's no replacement he has a 15 minute backup.  He also has a bag he carries with emergency wall/car plug-ins.  How was your LVAD in comparison?"
IAmA,3dzexc,bozobozo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:13:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, mine was similar. I had a wall unit that I plugged into overnight. I had two batteries on my that share the load. I had two more batteries in my travel bag along with a replacement computer controller. It would have taken a really rare event to leave me without power, but it can happen. How well you do with the device off depends on the condition of your real heart."

IAmA,3dzexc,DakiniBrave,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:31:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I have private health insurance from my employer and they've been great.

Have you experienced anything strange like that? Like feelings, emotions, or memories?  Also, what was it like ""Dying"" and being brought back to life? Did you go into the surgery thinking that it was quite possible you would die and never again wake up? How hard was it to go through with the proceedure knowing that?"
IAmA,3dzexc,lunescence,41,Mon Jul 20 19:56:24 2015 UTC,"I have experienced slight changes in food cravings and I have had more 'surface emotions.' Truthfully, I liken these changes to the two major surgeries, anesthesia and life renewal than to any other thing. My donor was very different from me. He was 25 and a sports hero in is town. I'm 52 and very bookish. Sports are not part of my life.  Regarding the feeling of my life ending, it all happened so slowly that you kind of got used to it. By the time a heart became available, I was so desperate that I would have let them put a monkey heart in me. I wasn't very scared... more excited I guess."

Just a couple weeks before his transplant, his son was diagnosed with the same condition, and since then has also been placed on an artificial heart at the age of 22. Now the fear is that my uncle's other kids, and my cousin's own son, are affected by CHF. Same with my mom, and myself and my sisters. I had an EKG the other day that came up fine.

I'm not running to be President of the Koch brothers, so I can say that I believe the wealthy should be able to enjoy their success, but I don't believe that passing billions of dollars down through generations to people who didn't earn it is good for our country.

A party promises to deliver certain things if they form the government. Well they didn't, they formed the minor part of a coalition and actually did well at moderating the Tories from what I could see. So many people I spoke to said ""no way I'd vote for them again, they went back on their promise about tuition fees."" Just specifically that reason. Out of all the reasons to vote or not vote for any of the parties. I was even a student at the time and I think the tuition fees issue is a very very small one indeed considering the way student loan repayments work is pretty fair.

I was working for a startup that had managed to raise $300,000,000 in venture capital, and managed to blow through all of it in just a few years. There was no accountability to shareholders and, even though it was public, they got away with sloppy accounting (that's being generous) that overstated revenue by tens of millions of dollars.   A lot of people lost their livelihoods over it. While I support business and am against unnecessary regulation, this experience taught me that the enforcement mechanisms the SEC has for public companies needs strengthening.  It's not a free market if the information being provided to large and small investors is false."

IAmA,3dym6w,xyzyxyzyx,86,Mon Jul 20 16:28:13 2015 UTC,"Like most people, it would depend on the issue.  I believe we spend too much on our military. We spend billions on wasteful programs and pork barrel projects that often even our military leaders don't want. We can have a stronger military if we cut the fat.  One place where I wouldn't cut is veterans' benefits.  We need to take care of those who've served.  Abortion - We could all argue till we're blue in the face on this one, and as a nation we have.  I'm pro-life, but it's not a position I'd force on others.  The one exception is partial-birth abortion which I'm firmly against in any situation besides the health of the mother.  Equal rights - It's 2015.  I think it's shameful this is still and issue.   Regardless of whether not I can win, I'm hoping to at least have an impact on the discussion."
IAmA,3dym6w,Reiginko,104,Mon Jul 20 16:49:41 2015 UTC,"Constructive political advice for you: you need to learn how to frame issues. For instance:   If you aren't going to change things, don't wade into the discussion. By mentioning abortion you waded into that debate and turned away people. You are for keeping the status quo, so just don't say anything about it at all unless directly asked. You actually managed to piss off both sides by being pro life and against making it illegal.  Don't say the word ""cut"" unless you're a hardline tea party crackpot. Ever. Only talk in positives. Instead of saying you would ""cut"" the military, say you are for ""strategic investments"" in the military. If someone presses you on it, say that you would 'consider fund reallocation'. When you say ""cut"", the headline is going to ignore the rest of the text and say ""Candidate for cutting military"". You don't get an explanation. Everything you say needs to communicate what you mean in 15 second bits. Do not let other people redefine topics, and do not take sides. If someone asks if you are a conservative or liberal and you aren't comfortable taking a side, come out strong on a different direction. Don't answer them, but state a strong opinion. ""I don't believe that a good leader should confine themselves to thinking about the world in one way. I would make decisions based on evidence"". Again notice that no negatives are used in what you would do. Don't say ""neither"" or ""both"" or ""depends on the issue"", talk about why you are better than both."

IAmA,3dym6w,Family-Duty-Hodor,7,Mon Jul 20 21:34:31 2015 UTC,"It's not that emotions are bad, for me the sad part is, that the rules of politics seem to punish people who are straight forward with their position except they are extremists on either side who want to polarize. If you're moderate in any way you have to be extremely careful with what you say so you can't possibly be misinterpreted even by the most malicious people.

IAmA,3dym6w,bunchajibbajabba,2,Mon Jul 20 22:10:32 2015 UTC,"That isn't the way the world works, and it also isn't the issue with politicians.

If you want to speak your mind all the time and ignore media politics, that's great, but you also exclude yourself from doing anything of value.  Now for the issue. Playing the game isn't the issue. The game taking over is the issue. You need to play brokerage politics to have an effective polity, but when public opinion ends up selecting people who legitimately believe the bullshit (ie the tea party), you have the tyranny of the majority."
IAmA,3dym6w,jjbpenguin,2,Mon Jul 20 22:18:51 2015 UTC,"Right, but where are the politicians that are just playing the game without being taken by it who are actually successful? The only politicians I see who aren't losing sight of their actual promises arent being elected."
IAmA,3dym6w,the_foxy_cow,3,Mon Jul 20 22:22:40 2015 UTC,"All over the place! A huge number of politicians actually truly try to do the right thing as their primary goal.  The reason it often does not appear so is something called ""incrementalism"". Essentially, you have three types of capital: financial, political, and time. You have a goal in mind for what you want to change, but have limited capital to make it happen.  You can't pay for it all at once right now. You don't have enough support to make a huge change. You don't have the time in office to build up to a big decision. So you make minor, incremental changes toward the goal.  Now, I'm not American and my understanding of your system is that there is far more partisan gridlock than elsewhere (I would suggest you're experiencing two failures: the tyranny of the majority and plutocracy). However, I am confident in suggesting that a large portion of politicians are still trying to do the right thing.  The point is that you absolutely have to play the game. The better you are at it, the more leeway you have in all three forms of capital. You can get access to more funds. You have a stronger mandate. You generally have more time as you'll be re-elected. You need to be a part of the system to change it."

Sometimes budgets need to be cut.  We are in debt and need to spend less money.  You spend less money by cutting things.  I have heard other people say things like you are suggesting by using creative tactics like claiming that the budgets of everything is decreased and the most critical areas are provided some additional funds.  This is just another way of being afraid to tell people that we are in debt and need to stop spending so much.  It is like a parent being afraid to tell their child that they can't afford to buy them a new toy.  This is just my view and if my view isn't the majority view, it would make sense to ignore my views to cater to the majority as you need a majority to win.

Sorry I am not familiarized with the terminology here, but I wanna know, as I closely know someone who went through that hard decision; what's the difference? I'm in Canada, this has been common practice here for years and never a taboo subject at least not in my province.  If you had medical evidence that your infant child was going to have severe heart disease, lung malformation and to top it off, Down's syndrome, would you carry on with the nine months pregnancy just to watch your son/daughter suffer miserably for months and ultimately die soon after his/her birth?  I'm simply wondering who are you or anyone else but the mother/father to judge of this? You can put all the eggs in the same basket like this, abortion is a case-by-case thing, at least from my perspective.

IAmA,3dym6w,notgarysmulyan,2,Mon Jul 20 22:58:12 2015 UTC,"The truth of it is that most people don't consider these sorts of situations in America. Many are HEAVILY anti-abortion and are very vocal about it. Then there are those on the other scale which fervently believe in the rights of the mother. Most Americans are in the middle, not knowing what they would do in the circumstance or, like me, don't want to consider taking the life of a child but knowing that it's not up to us what the mother does.  Your life, your choices. This is something the government should not be involved in other than regulations to make sure that it is as safe as possible for the mother."

IAmA,3dym6w,robinkooli,2,Mon Jul 20 18:33:05 2015 UTC,"that sounds like a great way to eliminate the discounts that major companies get.    Nearly every business relies on giving discounts at one time or another.  Sometimes it is done to ensure a large group commitment, and other times it is to build brand recognition, and other times it is to get people to buy other things.  Would you force all grocery stores to sell all of their products to every person every day of the year at the lowest price that it ever sold any of those products to any person?  Why should someone who buys salmon fillets in bulk when they are on sale get them cheaper than the person who comes in on a random day and wants to buy one small fillet?  Clearly these topics are somewhat different, but clearly it is not a viable business model to sell everyone your product at the cheapest price that you sell anybody your product.  If you are force to do so, your lowest price is just going to go up."

I have no idea where the idea that nuclear energy isn't clean but I would love to see this rectified.

I am intrigued by your effort and wish you the best, but Commander In Chief sounds like a pretty major departure from what you do currently.   I recognize that you are running as ""something different"" and I respect that 100%. However, I have worked in public policy for years and have run several political campaigns at the state level. During that time I have learned that governing well is hard for even the smartest and most well-meaning folks in our community.  The learning curve is steep and the consequences for mistakes are higher than you can imagine.   How do you plan to govern well without learning first-hand how governance actually works?   It is for good reason that many of our Presidents start out as Governors and Congressmen who started out as elected officials at the state level. You are challenging that widely respected and entrenched practice; which makes you a completely unknown and untested entity.   As such, what kind of practical experience do you have that will allow you to overcome the lack of experience in this field and jump straight to the top of the chain of command?  To help convince myself and others of your value as a candidate, here are some additional questions that need answers before folks will consider voting for you:   Do you have experience managing high-functioning individuals with sensitive public egos?  What about high level contract negotiations?  Training in consensus building?  Have you studied Federal Law?  Have you studied macro or micro economics?

IAmA,3dy732,bookitsouth,735,Mon Jul 20 17:08:11 2015 UTC,"Haha I couldn't tell you the exact ratio but you're probably close. We had WAY more men than women. The men on the site were exactly what you'd expect - horny, middle aged, sexually deprived and willing to do/pay anything for the affair of a lifetime. Poor guys, I always felt bad for them. The legitimate women on the site (we like every dating site had a huge problem with fraud/scammers/cam girls) were mostly single, looking for older married men. Lots of women looking for sugar daddies. We also got a lot of couples, looking to add a third person or another couple to their mix. As the site became more and more popular, I saw a lot more married woman making their way to us but they were far more careful than the men. The men would join, post a picture of their dick and then call two hours later screaming ""why has no one messaged me?!?!?!"" The delusion was off the charts. I had to explain at least five times a day that sending women pictures of your dick is literally the WORST first impression you can make. 9 times out of 10 they still didn't get it and would just go upload MORE dick pics.   Overall it was a healthy mix of people in a number of circumstances. We had one guy I'll always remember. His wife was in an accident and stuck in a wheelchair, unable to do anything. She forced him to join the site and encouraged him to find a woman he could have sex with. He ended up finding partners that would last a couple years at a time and it worked very well for them.

Not everyone using the site was married and not everyone was hiding their profiles from spouses. Lots of couples joined together to find other couples or a third person to join. Because every person's story was different, I could never judge the company for the actions of thousands of people. I actually miss working there - it was the most non-judgemental atmosphere I've ever been a part of."
IAmA,3dy732,Fhqwghads,86,Mon Jul 20 15:54:20 2015 UTC,"why did you stop working there then if you loved it so much? not trying to be sarcastic or an asshole, just curious."
IAmA,3dy732,Scudstock,264,Mon Jul 20 20:49:35 2015 UTC,I got offered my dream job and debated long and hard but it was actually my boss at Ashley Madison who encouraged me to go out and follow my dreams. I also have a standing invitation to go back and work for them anytime. :)
IAmA,3dy732,Fhqwghads,151,Mon Jul 20 20:54:04 2015 UTC,This person still works there...
IAmA,3dy732,hamelemental2,110,Mon Jul 20 20:59:40 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Their ""dream job"" was doing marketing work... for AM."
IAmA,3dy732,jwolfer,118,Mon Jul 20 21:40:24 2015 UTC,"So far I've learned that Ashley Madison:   The best marketing people ever. The best management ever. The best tech people on the planet. That she would bet that some vindictive wives hacked the website, not an inside job. The hackers are lying about them not actually fully deleting stuff. This person is sure that they'll have it fixed shortly.   How the fuck is this not a fake AMA... It is all deflecting and flowery bullshit to say about AM.  Anyways, it is obvious their marketing, and/or tech guys aren't ""the best in the workd""..."
IAmA,3dy732,Baked_Bacon_420,38,Mon Jul 20 23:32:17 2015 UTC,"You're right. The thing is, this is MY opinion of a company I used to work for. I had a good experience, despite the madness of the circumstances. My co-workers were a bunch of mad geniuses, because who else would work for a company that promotes infidelity? It was such a bizarre work environment, unlike anything I've ever experienced and my intention for this AMA was to simply share my stories and impressions of a company that gets a load of crap thrown at them. Some of it is deserved, I just personally feel this recent ""hack"" is yet another circumstance in a long (and not always publicized) trend that we as employees dealt with daily. If every death threat made against my co-workers made the news, maybe I wouldn't have wanted to do this AMA. I may be cavalier in my responses, but these people were like family and I remember the stress we felt when things like this happen. That's really all it is. Just my voice in a sea of voices. I had hoped my pragmatic responses came across that way but I'm by no means claiming AM is the best company of all the companies.   If I was a PR spokesperson for them, I'd be doing a terrible job as you clearly stated. :)"
IAmA,3dy732,Panencephalitis,138,Tue Jul 21 00:43:49 2015 UTC,"Again. Nope! The marketing team at AM was one of the best in the world and they don't need my help. I'm sorry I'm not a disgruntled former employee who is telling you the terrible things about the company that you seem to want to hear. I had a great time working there and while they're FAR from a perfect company, I really can't logically say things that just aren't true. I mean we had a serious problem with people leaving their leftover food in the communal fridge for way too long but that's really the extent of ""company drama."""
IAmA,3dy732,MystikIncarnate,68,Mon Jul 20 22:43:26 2015 UTC,"I don't want or need to hear terrible things about the company, but, I mean, there's a metric fuckton of people who are about to be really pissed off when their identities are released. That's going to look really bad for AM... And, conveniently, here you are with a glowing AMA about what a fantastic company it was (is) to work for.  Former employee or not, I take it with a grain of salt that this is in no way a concocted response by AM to battle bad press. It's sad, but this is pretty much standard ops for well known companies now."
IAmA,3dy732,rbarton812,10,Mon Jul 20 23:17:07 2015 UTC,Yup. AM is about to get a shitload of bad press from the hacking scandal and this is damage control.

IAmA,3dy732,thewaybaseballgo,149,Mon Jul 20 18:19:33 2015 UTC,"Protection as in we'd receive death threats constantly and every single one was taken seriously. Every employee was listened to, we made extensive notes on every detail of customer interaction and the management never said ""oh, don't worry, they're not ACTUALLY going to come and kill you and your family."" They would get police and lawyers involved and made sure the office was secured 24/7."
IAmA,3dy732,fran_the_man,80,Mon Jul 20 18:31:33 2015 UTC,I apologize for my attempt at humor; I honestly never considered death threats against the employees as a possibility. What would spawn the threats? People worried their affairs were not confidential?
IAmA,3dy732,jonnyfgm,161,Mon Jul 20 18:38:44 2015 UTC,"Haha it's ok. I figured it was a joke but thought I should answer anyway. The death threats were from one of two kinds of people: wives who caught their husbands using the site OR just random religious crazies. Like ""I'm going to blow up your office and laugh while watching all of your staff burn in hell. Jesus hates you."" You know, those sweet little messages that made us feel all warm and fuzzy. ;)"
IAmA,3dy732,bkoron,34,Mon Jul 20 18:42:46 2015 UTC,"Well, the fires set to your office certainly had the ""warm"" feelings in mind.   And I love the peaceful religious types that preach God's love, then get all Old Testy when something they don't like occurs."

IAmA,3dy732,browner87,3,Mon Jul 20 22:38:25 2015 UTC,"I find it strange that it was usually the wives of the husbands caught cheating issuing the death threats. I would have just assumed that it would be the husbands issuing the death threats because I assume that men are more aggressive. Any reason why it isn't the other way around? Or, in general, did it go both ways?"
IAmA,3dy732,rbGriphon,9,Mon Jul 20 21:15:30 2015 UTC,"As a completely unqualified unprofessional I would assume the disparity if from men being more likely to go do something to those involved as opposed to attacking the site itself. I have zero basis for this other than being a guy, having worked many customer service jobs over the years, and knowing how pissed off guys operate."
IAmA,3dy732,browner87,90,Mon Jul 20 21:23:38 2015 UTC,What percentage of the female users on Ashley Madison are real and not bots?
IAmA,3dy732,rbGriphon,190,Mon Jul 20 17:53:58 2015 UTC,"I would say 50/50. The bots are so easy to spot though, we had a full time fraud department to shut them down but damn, cam girls are persistent. There were obvious flags - be wary of single 21 year old girls who look like they came from a Maxim photo shoot. If it seems too good to be true, it probably is! Cam girls never put personal info in their profiles, the real women do."

IAmA,3dy732,bananahead,118,Tue Jul 21 15:36:18 2015 UTC,"Can you please respond to this part of the story in particular?  In a long manifesto posted alongside the stolen ALM data, The Impact Team said it decided to publish the information in response to alleged lies ALM told its customers about a service that allows members to completely erase their profile information for a $19 fee.  According to the hackers, although the “full delete” feature that Ashley Madison advertises promises “removal of site usage history and personally identifiable information from the site,” users’ purchase details — including real name and address — aren’t actually scrubbed.  “Full Delete netted ALM $1.7mm in revenue in 2014. It’s also a complete lie,” the hacking group wrote. “Users almost always pay with credit card; their purchase details are not removed as promised, and include real name and address, which is of course the most important information the users want removed.”  Thanks, you seem like you know what you're talking about.  Is this part true?"
IAmA,3dy732,NotYourMothersDildo,178,Mon Jul 20 19:11:45 2015 UTC,"Nope. This is the funniest part to me. The whole reason the Full Delete option was introduced is because simply deleting your profile didn't remove your information from our back end. If someone purchases the Full Delete option, we had NO record of them in our system. It was literally like you never existed on the site or our back end. It's actually a great service for customers but was annoying for us because suddenly information disappeared on us and we couldn't get it back.  The problem is people are idiots and create multiple accounts under multiple emails. So it only deletes the profile you pay to delete."
IAmA,3dy732,bkoron,68,Mon Jul 20 19:19:34 2015 UTC,"It was literally like you never existed on the site or our back end.   To the back-end system you had access to. Based on your responses, you were a CSR and I doubt you had access to the PCI-compliant card database which is what the hacker group said still had customer information in it."
IAmA,3dy732,redditjumpssharks,14,Mon Jul 20 21:27:54 2015 UTC,"lots of companies do not have their own pci compliant database because it is too much of a hassle and there are providers out there that do it stupid cheap (stripe, braintree, etc). all the credit card customer data is stored on the providers side (presumably not accessible by the hacking group) and you get at it via token.  maybe ALM did roll their own because at scale it was more cost effective, i dont know. just sayin that lots of companies dont."
IAmA,3dy732,SilentlyCrying,89,Tue Jul 21 01:04:30 2015 UTC,"Just going to throw out there that deleting something isn't the same as wiping is securely. Databases? They execute DELETE commands when all readers of a record have closed the record. Filesystems? Mark for deletion and write over them as desired. ZFS? Will only overwrite old data as a last resort. I'm not saying AM didn't do a proper scrub, I'm just saying I think /u/bkoron 's question would have to be answered by an actual tech person on site to get a valid answer."
IAmA,3dy732,BoratRemix,38,Mon Jul 20 20:56:24 2015 UTC,"Additionally, database backups are not deleted so easily. If you delete the whole backup, then you've lost any recovery ability. If you want to delete a single record from the database backup you'd have to restore the backup, delete the record and re-backup. Multiply that by the days/weeks/months of backups, including daily, incremental, differential and transactional, and your records aren't truly deleted. They're just not on-line. Unless you're backing up to a SAN or NAS, in which case, they are on-line and ready to be swiped.    Which is why I believe that it was more likely an insider. Possibly a disgruntled ex-employee."
IAmA,3dy732,SilentlyCrying,13,Mon Jul 20 21:16:03 2015 UTC,Lol my friend suggested the hacks were sponsored by divorce lawyers trying to drum up business. Maybe they hired a double-agent there.
IAmA,3dy732,BigBlackHungGuy,7,Mon Jul 20 22:10:52 2015 UTC,"Also a good theory.  From OP's description it sounds like disgruntled ex-employee is not likely, but never trust an ex-employee. I know I wouldn't do anything to my former employers, but I wouldn't expect them trust me either."
IAmA,3dy732,onemorepicplease,6,Mon Jul 20 22:29:02 2015 UTC,Dba here. Your information is never truly deleted.

IAmA,3dy732,Panencephalitis,17,Mon Jul 20 19:30:46 2015 UTC,"No, I don't know either of those men but truthfully, even if I did I wouldn't say so here! As I haven't worked for ALM in several years, it is not my place to comment on their current security practices or speculate who is behind the hack. I will say that the programmers and developers at ALM are some of the greatest people I've ever met in my life and everyone over there is worried about protecting the customers' privacy. They have dealt with FAR worse than some small time hackers in the past and this will be resolved quickly and efficiently. In MY OPINION this is the work of a bitter spouse (or group of bitter spouses) of an affair gone wrong. If it's anything else, I will gladly accept it but my gut tells me it is just someone with too much time on their hands. The ALM team are beasts and won't go down without a fight."

IAmA,3dy732,puddlejumper,52,Mon Jul 20 22:42:45 2015 UTC,"Having seen some of taboo aspects of human nature when it comes to monogamy, would you ever get married?"
IAmA,3dy732,taxemic,138,Mon Jul 20 20:01:00 2015 UTC,"I am married. The only thing it really changed my perspective on was sex in a marriage. It's so important to have a healthy sex life with your spouse, if you choose to be monogamous. Being monogamous shouldn't mean no one's getting laid. I don't ever remember seeing anyone on the site who was looking for a secret affair that also said they had a happy sex life at home. Every profile was the same... ""My wife/husband doesn't like/want sex but I do...""  It's actually heartbreaking. People don't WANT to cheat, it happens out of necessity."
IAmA,3dy732,QuickAgISTheFlash,62,Mon Jul 20 20:28:06 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with this.  We are good friends with a couple who are the ""Bickerson's"", they show up at get togethers' irritated and are always sniping at each other.  At our last dinner date the husband mentioned ""...you know what onemorepicplease? I fall asleep on the couch downstairs every night watching SportsCenter and then I wake up and drag my ass upstairs about 1 in the morning and go to bed, then the alarm goes off at 5:30 in the morning and I go work out.""

IAmA,3dy732,unclexrico,5,Mon Jul 20 21:10:52 2015 UTC,"I'm curious if you hang out with them because they're sort of entertaining. Not judging, that's what I would do. But if they're like that all the time I don't see any other reason why you would want to see them regularly."
IAmA,3dy732,SasJam,22,Tue Jul 21 02:01:51 2015 UTC,"A small tidbit that one of my best friends, who holds a Bachelors in Sociology specifically, said point blank that cheating is the action of fulfilling a need. In a monogamy derived society, the action of cheating is frowned upon immensely, but most of the people who cheat aren't ""bad"" people, as I think it would be fair to say the OP is emphasizing.   In all truth, I used to have an issue with ""talking"" with other women. Yes, just talking, but HIGHLY inappropriate topics at that. Why? Because I settled down too fast, committed too fast, and just wanted to see what was out there (3 previous relationships to current one, all of them hilariously/ tragically unstable, and for the first two years, so was my current). But the silver lining here is she and I talked about where we stand both as a couple and individuals. In a fortunate twist of fate, she and I wanted the same thing,  but just never talked about it. After talking to present day, I honestly have no motivation to fall back into old habits. It's honestly rather nice.  My single biggest piece of advice I can render to anyone in a relationship, healthy or struggling, is communicate as much as possible your needs. Now that's not to say ""be needy"", but if you feel the need to start shopping elsewhere, the first stop you should make is your partner. And if you don't feel like youcan talk to your partner, there's much bigger issues at play, and you need to do some serious personal reflection on the benefit/cost of your relationship on yourself.  Note: these are just my reflections and opinions, not gospel."
IAmA,3dy732,dozersmash,53,Tue Jul 21 00:17:27 2015 UTC,Would you ever consider using such a site yourself?
IAmA,3dy732,SasJam,104,Mon Jul 20 17:05:14 2015 UTC,"No. I would never pay for online dating! That was probably my only issue - forcing people to pay. In this day and age, there's SO many free dating sites (which actually most of our married members also belonged to, so what does that say about the quality of people on ""singles"" sites?) that do the same thing. The only benefit I could see is that we would protect our members' privacy more so than a free dating site. When wives called demanding information, we were all trained on how to deflect and avoid. We had to change the billing name for people's credit card statements every few weeks because people would find out and post it online. Like ""if you see a charge on your husband's credit card that says 'Joe's Internet Cafe', that's Ashley Madison."""
IAmA,3dy732,buttsbuttsbutts7,25,Mon Jul 20 17:14:46 2015 UTC,"Ouch. If the main draw is the added protection of privacy this hack and threats to expose all info must be a pretty huge threat.

They're holding the site hostage saying ""pay us, or we'll dox all your users"".    What are your thoughts on this incident?  Was security lax?  The news is reporting that it was likely an employee.  Were employees treated poorly there?  Why do you think they'd do this?  Do you have any idea who it might be?"
IAmA,3dy732,Panencephalitis,24,Mon Jul 20 18:13:58 2015 UTC,"I have no idea who it could be or any reasoning behind it. I haven't worked there in a couple of years and employees come and go.    Security was always priority number one. It was all fun and games to be the company that promotes cheating but ultimately, it was more of a headache for us to be lax on security and have 100 angry wives calling us every five seconds. If you put your info on any website, you're taking a bit of a risk right?   I wouldn't dare speculate on who is responsible for the hack but when I read the article this morning my gut reaction was ""Great, the bitter wives brigade has done it again."" I haven't looked in years but there used to be many sites dedicated to bringing us down. Groups of women would band together and ""help"" women catch their husbands on the site and encourage them to ruin the lives of anyone who went near us. We'd always find them and the lawyers would get their sites shut down but they'd come back just as fast elsewhere.   Of course, I may be biased because the angry wives were always the cruelest, most vindictive and by far the most vocal. I can't imagine any employee being THAT mad. The company was amazing. They paid well, provided full benefits, lots of fun employee incentives, etc."
IAmA,3dy732,rbGriphon,15,Mon Jul 20 18:27:20 2015 UTC,"When you say the ""angry"" or ""bitter wife brigade"", you mean the women who have been devastingly hurt, right?

IAmA,3dy732,mkrsoft,53,Mon Jul 20 20:45:53 2015 UTC,"Not really. It's weird, I always felt like the men must be finding their wives on the site like women are finding their husbands but maybe men are less likely to admit it out loud? Women get vindictive. I get the feeling men would just up and leave the wife and be done with it. The women drag it out. They want to know every sordid detail.  I sense that a man would not want to call into the site and admit their wife may be cheating on them. Is it a masculinity thing, I don't know. Perhaps a man could answer that better.  Also, women were a little smarter about it. They'd take the conversations off the site immediately and therefore out of our ""realm"" of influence."

Do you think they consider: ""Hmm, I don't think Ashley Madison treats their employees that well, I better not use the site.""  Or do people think that this kind of press helps expand market share?  ""I never thought about cheating on my spouse before, but Ashley Madison seems so cool, maybe I should consider cheating!""  Fucking ridiculous.  You have people complaining that the answers are ""perfectly crafted"" from a PR standpoint when they make no fucking sense from a PR standpoint.  The only answers that would make sense from a PR standpoint have to do with privacy and security, but OP parroted the same shit you'd probably find on their website and made it clear that she doesn't know the two people most responsible for those areas.  And people think this AMA is about damage control?  Why not pretend to be a former IT person?  Or claim to know the CTO?  Or have any insight into security at all?  OP also confused ""bots"" with ""cam girls,"" and went ahead and said fucking half the girls on the site are cam girls.  One of OP's first answers also makes clear that it's a sea of dicks, jokingly saying that a 5000-1 male-female ratio probably wasn't that far off.  And of course OP said flatly that she'd never consider using a paid site like Ashley Madison when free alternatives exist.  OP's answers are all that Ashley Madison is a good place to work, but not a good place to find a real woman.  Does that seem like PR?"

IAmA,3dy732,OneAndOnlyJackSchitt,38,Mon Jul 20 23:43:37 2015 UTC,Do you have any idea of the success rate of the married men who used your site?  Lots of dating sites can have men send out dozens of responses and end up empty handed.
IAmA,3dy732,eek04,121,Mon Jul 20 19:40:35 2015 UTC,"It's true. Ahh, this is fun, so many memories are coming back to me. Here's the thing. Men on dating sites tend to be completely unrealistic. Most men expect the women to do all the work. It's like they think ""hey I'm just going to put up a picture of my dick and my jacked up arms, write ""sup ladies' in every section of my profile and just wait for the hotties to roll in."" It doesn't work like that in real life and it doesn't work online either. 65 year old men would call and complain that none of the 19 year old models they wrote to replied. It's never fun having to crush a man's soul by saying ""maybe try messaging a 40 year old one time and just see what happens..."" They just refuse to accept that the 19 year old model might not want them.   I felt really bad for women over 40 on the site. They were invisible. But they were always the most wild and adventurous.   If men are honest, open, willing to talk to women before asking them to fuck, post ANYTHING other than dick pics (no, putting your dick besides rulers, beer cans, pop bottles or any other inanimate object you feel the need to compare your dick size to is NOT a turn on for any woman anywhere) is a pretty easy way to get the most out of any dating site. You have to put some work into it, just like real life.   I wish people understood that a dating site can't fix crazy.   But seriously guys, stop sending pics of your dick to random women on the internet. I've seen it happen a million times and not once has it worked or resulted in any interest from a woman. Just stop."

IAmA,3dy732,HackPhilosopher,41,Mon Jul 20 20:05:57 2015 UTC,Nah. Maybe it should have but I mainly felt bad for the customers. They were all just looking for something they weren't getting at home. We were the last resort. I didn't want to make anyone feel worse than they already did.

IAmA,3dy732,Tress33,64,Mon Jul 20 18:27:16 2015 UTC,Every day was crazy. I mentioned it in another reply but probably the woman who had her young son call us to tell us we ruined his family was the most memorable. It was strange to hear a 4 year old kid screaming about his daddy having sex with another woman and how it was all our fault that mommy was crying. I always hated that mom. Leave your kids out of it and talk to your husband. I'm pretty sure the damage done by his mother that day is far worse than his dad getting one night of sexual release. It definitely gave me more compassion for men who aren't getting laid.

Some porn companies would literally create thousands of female profiles at a time and we'd spend the next three weeks furiously deleting them all. They're bots (or we called them bots) because they're not technically real but they weren't made by AM. The biggest problem is these bots trying to take traffic to their sites. It's a problem on ALL dating sites, not just AM."

IAmA,3dy732,himisscas,102,Mon Jul 20 17:24:25 2015 UTC,"Women, by far. They went crazy. It's hard to choose just one memorable story because (no exaggeration) we'd get at least one legitimately crazy wife harassing us every single day. I was called every name in the book. I had people threaten to blow up our office, kill my family, etc. It was terrifying.   Mainly the wives were pissed because we refused to confirm what they already knew. They'd have proof and beg us to just say ""yes, he's on our site and yes he paid for a membership."" But we never compromised our members' privacy.   It sadly ruined my impression of a lot of women, even being a woman myself. 99.9% of their madness could be solved by sitting down and talking to their spouses. Some women sent in pictures of their kids to try and make us feel bad. One woman had her young child (he sounded about 4 years old) call us to tell us we'd ruined his family."

IAmA,3dy732,jennareid,89,Mon Jul 20 17:42:59 2015 UTC,"Oh sure, all the time. But the building we worked at had access cards, security guards at the entrance AND our main office door was locked and required a key or someone to buzz you in. Even the elevator needed an access card to work. They never made it past the front entrance, thank God! It wasn't hard to see the raging woman a mile away so the security guys were always on top of it.   We were also open/operating 24 hours a day and some employees had overnight shifts. It always stressed me out, worrying about them being in the office alone at night but knowing how many security measures were in place helped ease my mind. In all my years there, we never had a breach of security. From my understanding the security has been increased even more since I was there."
IAmA,3dy732,gjs278,8,Mon Jul 20 17:50:49 2015 UTC,I'm curious - was there some supersecret way in and out?

I'm trying to imagine the logistics of doing this but an underground direct-access parking lot that exited a few blocks away is all I can think... Or were things not that crazy? I'm imagining being afraid to show my face/license plates if I worked in that kind of environment.

You are catching them at a totally horrible time in their lives and your buisiness is clearly a part that facilitated their husband's affair.    You really look down on those women for being irrationally upset?   99.9% of their madness could be solved by sitting down and talking to their spouses.    Are you under the delusion that cheaters don't lie?"
IAmA,3dy732,jennareid,34,Mon Jul 20 22:01:55 2015 UTC,"I think the implication here is that if the cheaters communicate and tell their spouses/SO what the problem is and WHY they feel the need to cheat they are actually less likely to cheat bc the problem will, hopefully, get solved.

IAmA,3dy732,brettmjohnson,37,Mon Jul 20 21:11:20 2015 UTC,How do they justify making people pay to delete data? Shouldn't that be free?
IAmA,3dy732,prchm,30,Mon Jul 20 19:34:46 2015 UTC,"If you delete your profile, your profile is removed from the public site. Because of the nature of the business, we kept detailed records of customer accounts because sometimes law enforcement would ask for it. Plus, for our loyal customers it helps to be able to pull up information easily when they call/email in. Every site does it, I hate to break it to you. If you give them information, they may very well keep it.  The Full Delete is mainly for the people who give the site their credit card info and therefore get overly paranoid about their spouses finding out and demanding we wipe them from our system. The thing is, it actually DOES wipe you entirely from the system, just as advertised. So if you're that paranoid, it's $19 well spent.   And you don't have to pay to delete your profile. You can do it for free anytime. But if you want to take your privacy to the next level, pay the $19 and all traces of you on the site are gone forever, including your credit card and name. Even if you wanted us to find your old profile, we wouldn't be able to.   For people who just do the regular delete, they can have their profiles reinstated if they want. Full Delete can't. You're dead to us. :)"
IAmA,3dy732,rbGriphon,101,Mon Jul 20 20:11:31 2015 UTC,"Wait... you ""kept detailed records of customer accounts because sometimes law enforcement would ask for it"", but $19 is all it takes to magically make it not matter that law enforcement might ask for it?  ""Gee, sorry officer, we'd love to help you out, but we're not showing any record for that person... so either they never had an account with us, or they paid $19."""
IAmA,3dy732,nothefunkind,51,Mon Jul 20 21:58:55 2015 UTC,"Amen. That explanation is complete horseshit. Unless there are record retention laws in place then there is no reason to keep the information for any extended time. I'm no lawyer, but God, that sounds eerily close to a one time extortion scam. And depending on just what the TOA for the site and service says, if they said they would delete all info for a price and then didn't, well, isn't that a fraudulent service?"
IAmA,3dy732,SuperSpecialEE,29,Mon Jul 20 22:37:23 2015 UTC,It also seems flawed from a credit card standpoint. Surely you could request the $19 service then complain to Amex that there was a $19 charge on your account that you didn't authorize.  AM would then be unable to show that you had an account and Amex would reverse the charge. Or AM would show that you did have an account and then you could appeal to Amex to reverse the charge because they didn't do what you paid for.
IAmA,3dy732,Soylopeor,10,Mon Jul 20 23:08:24 2015 UTC,OP please explain this. What do you do if law enforcement is requesting information but they did a pay for delete?
IAmA,3dy732,Discko14,6,Mon Jul 20 22:52:14 2015 UTC,"So, I am in no way an expert on this, but there are federal record retention laws, state record retention laws and IRS tax code requirements that deal with making sure that you keep transactions on file for a certain time period (usually somewhere between 3-7 years). I believe that there is even a SOX compliance thing involved. I highly doubt that AM is deleting the records 100% because of this. However, it may just mean that there is a box in the basement with a paper copy of everyone's invoice. If you are exchanging money, the record is not just going to go away.

If they were secretly harbouring these profiles after people paid to delete them then they did a very good job of hiding it from us. I am sure deep down in the servers you'll find every profile that ever existed if the cops require seeing it. But if you're a husband who fucked 10 women you met on the site, paid to delete your profile and then your wife calls to pester us for details? As far as we're concerned he never existed and that's what we will tell her.   Beyond my job description, I can't say what the overlords do with the millions of deleted profiles and frankly, no one cared until this recent ""hacking"" came out.

But as I stated elsewhere, it only deletes the profile you request to be deleted. If you have ten other profiles using the same or different emails, they'll stay still be there unless you tell us about them too. Most people with half a brain create one profile and know they only created one. If you and your buddies create 50 profiles at 3am one night when you're wasted and expect us to be able to find and delete every single one, it's not going to happen. Or it may take us a little while longer to find them all and remove them for you. I would say the hackers are people who created multiple profiles, paid to delete one of them and then got pissed because they have multiple other accounts they forgot about. There's no criminal masterminding going on here."
IAmA,3dy732,ConquerHades,8,Mon Jul 20 20:41:59 2015 UTC,"It is because the database they are talking about surviving the Full Delete was the secured credit card billing database -- not the database you had access to.

IAmA,3dy732,dildosmith,5,Mon Jul 20 21:41:11 2015 UTC,"I mentioned earlier that, while I am in no way an expert, there are federal, state and IRS regulations in regards to businesses keeping credit card transactions for a set period of time. There is just no way that AM would go out of compliance with the financial record retention. But, there is no specific method that a company has to use to maintain these records, so they could be paper copies in a box somewhere for all we know."

IAmA,3e3be6,Mikecom32,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:34:26 2015 UTC,"Once we had chosen the pieces of writing that we knew we wanted to use for the film, then the question became, ""What's the best technique for doing that?"" In the case of 'Men In Black', there were two factors that lead us to animation: first was that Colby (the subject of 'Men In Black') was a big fan of comics and graphic novels, the second was that we had no practical way to dramatize his story with live-action images."

IAmA,3e3be6,uplawyered913,2,Tue Jul 21 17:35:30 2015 UTC,I joke that half the reason I made the film was to meet Tim O'Brien. And he was the last interview -- I pursued him for many months.

Nowadays, kids are calling me asking me for an appraisal. The ones that I thought got away are actually coming to me now. All in all, I can't really put my finger on a deal that got away. Everything that I buy I can constantly sell, comic books have appreciated so much that they can become up to twenty times more valuable, so the goal is to not let it get away. Use a long pole, that's the secret. Now when it comes to girlfriends, that's a whole different story.   Sure, I wish I had bought every one and kept it along the way. But my business is buying and selling but what I buy is what I collect. Personally, I love Marvel stuff but that's a whole other conversation..."

In the 1980s at my comic books store in Queens, I came across Omega Man No. 1. I bought 10,000 copies of Omega Man No. 1, 2, 3 and 4. I sold a few hundred copies in my store, but not nearly as much as I expected. It was a great book, a great series but it didn't get to the value that we wanted.   Omega Man No. 3 was actually the first appearance of Lobo, so that  became extremely valuable and I lived on selling those for about 3 months.   I just invested in the new Star Wars book that came out in January and that was a great investment.  You have to be very smart about it if you're going to buy things in large amounts and know where you're going to sell some of this stuff.

When I saw the Nightcrawler appear in that second movie, I thought ""Wow, they really got it right.""

IAmA,3e382x,dylansfc,2,Tue Jul 21 17:03:52 2015 UTC,"This, the Double Action comic book. When Action Comics came out with Superman it was so popular they had Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster and they created an ashcan (black and white comic book) to show what the book would be like. This is Double Action No. 2, one of the rarest comics, which is extremely important in the history of comics. It's as close to an Action No. 1 as you're going to get. It's probably worth $150,000 to $200,000.   I also have a Marvel Fanzine from 1967, which I found at the Long Beach Flea Market this weekend, that's just four pages which is a point of view of all things that had come previous, the original X-Men series hadn't been created yet. That's what is amazing about comic books is the early fan culture that was created. It's super rare and super interesting. The supply is very low and demand is high which equates to make them valuable and interesting.   I like lots of things, we found a warehouse in Allentown, PA filled with movie programs from the 60s, 70s, and 80s and some of them are in the top 100 films like Indiana Jones, Sound of Music and Terminator. When you used to go to feature films they would sell a program in the lobby. We bought this warehouse and put these programs out for sale which was one of the most successful things we sold at San Diego Comic Con last weekend.   I once met a guy in Connecticut, he had a room 15x15 filled with Hulk stuff, Hulk pinatas, pinball machines and the first 15 Hulk comic books. He said to bring a truck, and he was right!"

IAmA,3e382x,JohnHF2000,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:24:01 2015 UTC,"Yes! And it's just begun, the international experience. One of the coolest deals I did was to Germany. I had a deal in Hameln, Germany (near Hamburg). A friend of mine arranged all my plane arrangements, but when I got to the airport, they didn't have my reservation. I had to get there in a certain time frame or the deal was off. The man had a collection of original golden age comics, over $100k deal.   I tried everything, but they had no flights to the north where Hamlen was, but they had a flight that went to the south, it took 8 hours to drive the north. The GPS was in German. I didn't really know where I was going, but I made it in time and bought the collection! It was really interesting having that ticking clock in the background.  I'm excited about Europe. The guys in Europe did a lot of work to get the American comics into their country so they are real collectors.  There's a great market in France. There's a show that's over 50k attendees, I want to go there.  I'll be going to the London show next year. I've always done a lot of business with the guys over England, so there's a lot going on there.  I'm going to go to Japan next year for a show.  I really want to go to every state to make a deal too. I haven't got a deal in Alaska, I keep waiting for that call to go to Alaska. So, if you're in Alaska and have a collection, let me know!"

IAmA,3e382x,MattAlbie60,2,Tue Jul 21 17:39:29 2015 UTC,"Sure. I love the Dondi. Coming from New York, I loved reading it.  I became friends with Irwin Hasen, was the artist and writer and he sadly passed away recently. Irwin was a very petite man, and full of energy, a lot like his character. He came to comic book conventions I ran and it was always a delight to be around him.  I like Peanuts strips. Whenever I get a chance, I love to stop and read a Peanuts strip.  Harvey comic books, it's kind of like a comic strip panels. I just bought a Casper comic and Casper was sitting there with a gold fish bowl on his head and a bunch of gold fish at his feet. I love that.  Another one was Little Nemo in Sumberland. It was by Winsor McCay, one of the most amazing artists. You could call him surrealist. It was about a little boy and he'd always fall asleep and his dreams were always an amazing places he'd go and they'd end with his mom saying, ""Nemo, wake up!"" It's a strip that you could read again and again because the artwork was so detailed. I'm hoping to do an art show with that work soon.  Comic strips were the initial beginnings of the comic books. Before the super heroes, they'd take comic strips from the newspapers and put them together in comic book form. They'd sell them for 10 cent. 1938 the superheroes came in with the invention of Superman and such. There were super heroes before that of course, but that's when they dropped the term ""strip"" and just started calling them comic books."

IAmA,3e37ol,WNW3,3,Tue Jul 21 17:03:00 2015 UTC,"There are several reasons.  One is that a lot of robocallers are scammers who are offshore, who really could care less about your request - they don't even keep lists of numbers that have asked to opt-out.  In other cases, the laws around when consent was required were often interpreted in funny ways - so debt collectors would call over and over and over because you'd given them consent to do so, and they didn't believe they had to opt-out (they weren't telemarketers)."

IAmA,3e37ol,SimiTS,3,Tue Jul 21 17:07:16 2015 UTC,How do you collect the information that prove the call is unwanted?
IAmA,3e37ol,SimiTS,3,Tue Jul 21 17:06:14 2015 UTC,"If you're on a cell phone, you can get an app or service that will keep track in a digital format of all the calls/voicemails you get and when (our service, YouMail, does this for you).  This provides proof that you got the calls, and who they were from.   To provide proof that you opted out, you can use services like ours to record a specific greeting for telemarketers asking to be taken off the list and have that play automatically when they call.  Now you have proof of when they call and that you asked to be taken off the list."
IAmA,3e37ol,SimiTS,2,Tue Jul 21 17:11:16 2015 UTC,I know a bit about what YouMail does. :) I was wondering if you have an algorithm that can automatically recognize a number that was eg. previously flagged as a scammer and block it upfront?
IAmA,3e37ol,Efferri,2,Tue Jul 21 17:18:41 2015 UTC,"Our algorithm can recognize numbers as spammers even if users haven't flagged them as spammers.  We have answered billions of calls so we have a very solid idea of the calling patterns of robocallers/spammers, so we can identify many of them very quickly after they start calling some of our users.   We don't stop people's phones from ringing when these calls come in, but if they ignore it, we'll automatically play the out of service tone to the spam callers, which makes it much less likely they'll call again in the future."
IAmA,3e37ol,exjentric,2,Tue Jul 21 17:23:42 2015 UTC,"This is a super interesting topic, I would love to know some of the data points you collect on the numbers, but I guess you can't disclose that... Am I right?"
IAmA,3e37ol,DanJusto,2,Tue Jul 21 17:32:34 2015 UTC,It depends what sort of data you'd like to see?  We have a directory of numbers you can search to see if we know/think a given number is a spammer and what our users think of that number: http://directory.youmail.com
IAmA,3e37ol,erebello13,2,Tue Jul 21 17:38:24 2015 UTC,Can you identify if a number is VoIP or which operator it is registered with etc.? Do you typically see spam numbers come from certain countries or phone types (landline/mobile/VoIP)?
IAmA,3e37ol,Fletch71011,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:48:59 2015 UTC,Spammers often spoof or use disposable Voip numbers.  So you can't be sure it's really that number.  So detecting spammers is really about the calling patterns we see that help us recognize that a number is suddenly behaving like spam numbers behave.

They're recorded calls, sometimes different, and they alternate between 800 numbers and various different numbers using different area codes. It's infuriating, especially since I'm job hunting; when I see a number I don't recognize, I get my hopes up. In the message, they do give a number to call to supposedly get your name removed from their list, but I'm really hesitant to even call that; everything about it just feels so scammy and awful, and I'm not sure if I would be removed from all their lists, since they use a number of numbers, and of course, I have no idea how they got my number in the first place."

IAmA,3dvgvi,ybreddit,5,Mon Jul 20 06:15:38 2015 UTC,"Not quite. Before pulling facts off of Wikipedia, I'd suggest reading them and the sources.   The X-Files premiered September 10, 1993, while the song was released in Spring of 1994. Hell, recording on it didn't actually begin until after The X-Files pilot. Kinda hard for it to be the inspiration for something released several months in the past.  ""The song has appeared in several films and TV shows, such as Dumb and Dumber, Box of Moonlight, Hellboy, Cirque Du Freak: The Vampire's Assistant, Peaky Blinders, and The X-Files television series, whose producer Chris Carter explained in the liner notes for the compilation album, Songs in the Key of X, that the song was the direct inspiration for the anthology.""  So, the song appeared in the show, and was the inspiration for the compilation album ""Songs in the Key of X"", in which it was featured."

IAmA,3dvgvi,strongbadpenis,7,Mon Jul 20 00:28:11 2015 UTC,A more prevalent role in which movies? I don't think you realize that Scarecrow was one of the main villains in the first and had less than a minute of screen time in the second and third movies.

IAmA,3dvgvi,lostarchitect,101,Mon Jul 20 15:03:12 2015 UTC,"Just want to throw in my quick Cillian story. I've worked on two movies with Cillian and was lucky enough to get to talk to him a bit because I was the first team PA, meaning my job was getting him from his trailer, tending to his needs, etc. basically just keep an eye on him at all times.  Whenever people ask me who are the meanest celebs, nicest, etc. I always say that Cillian is one of the nicest people I've ever met.  For instance, the FIRST movie I ever worked on was one with him and after a bit I got promoted to being his wrangler and he was telling me and another crew member how he'd just been in Vegas doing character research for an upcoming role and I remarked how I'd just been there the same weekend myself and he said, ""Oh you should have let me know, we could have gone out for a pint."" And at the time, I had not talked to him much at all nor did he know me very well.  He was so grounded he just threw that out there.  As to the what he does in his free time, I know we both talked a lot about running and how much we loved the peacefulness we got when doing it.  He mentioned that he just liked hanging with his pals at the pub and you could tell he was just a normal guy.    Oh and yeah, his eyes are even more ridiculous in real life.  I've often thought how it's amusing that say Danny Devito and Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson are both members of the same human race because of how different they look.  I get the same feeling when thinking about Cillian's eyes and my own hazel ones.  It's like his eyes are Brad Pitt and I'm just some guy.  Just thought I'd throw in my anecdote."

IAmA,3dvgvi,hamark,9,Mon Jul 20 04:46:56 2015 UTC,"Man, then you are going to love this story.  A friend of mine, Irish, from Cork. was at a pub and found a spot at the bar to get his friends a round, when he is approached from behind that he apparently took some dude's spot at the bar and the guys said it a bit harsh or whatever happened my friend became a bit agitated while turning around, since he didn't even intend on taking the spot forever.  It is Cilian Murphy standing behind him and of course he gets his spot at the bar back plus ending up ordering the round for my friend and his guys.  I am not good at story telling, but I liked how it all worked out as a very casual encounter  with such a great actor."

IAmA,3dvgvi,boyhunk,198,Mon Jul 20 12:18:51 2015 UTC,I loved Murphy in Sunshine. Probably my favorite Sci fi film coming from a guy who's seen neither Star Wars nor Space Odyssey 2001.
IAmA,3dvgvi,imgettingbetternow,68,Mon Jul 20 02:20:20 2015 UTC,Same writer as 28 Days Later and Ex Machina. Absolutely loved all three.  Fantastic soundtrack too.

IAmA,3dvgvi,Fire2box,7,Mon Jul 20 10:15:05 2015 UTC,"This part of the soundtrack was grinded through sooo many trailers and used on countless other occasions. It kind of breaks my heart when someone says ""That's the music from kick-ass"".  But to be honest, it's hard to compete with the track ""Capas last transmission home"". The beauty of the music is breathtaking. Also the fact that the score includes ""ambient sounds"" is a pretty neat detail.  edit: added link."

IAmA,3dvgvi,Fire2box,25,Mon Jul 20 04:19:16 2015 UTC,the 3rd acts of Danny Boyle movies do seem to always lack a little something. but i still love his movies.
IAmA,3dvgvi,Daamus,10,Mon Jul 20 06:03:12 2015 UTC,"what gets me is The Beach.   You got Danny directing and Alex Garland screenwriting his own book. Yet, the book is better in a few parts such as showing Richard and Sal in the cave system where they store the tiny boat to get to mainland to trade/buy rice and get luxuries. I'm glad I saw the movie before I read the book.   also I'd say Alex Garland movies are the same way. Other then 28 days later, that movie is just a constant ramp up."
IAmA,3dvgvi,Th3Marauder,7,Mon Jul 20 06:56:45 2015 UTC,I think that statement has a horrible second half. Loved Sunshine. Pinbacker's part in the movie made sense to me. But whatever people's opinions on the quality I don't think the studio is responsible for the second half. Just Boyle.
IAmA,3dvgvi,Zarick452,7,Mon Jul 20 08:59:04 2015 UTC,"After reading this excerpt, do you still think the ending was horrible?

IAmA,3dvgvi,NimChimspky,8,Mon Jul 20 07:59:43 2015 UTC,"I've always defended Sunshine's ending. Not to the point that it blew me away, but it didn't have a negative impact on my experience.  On the surface Pinbacker may just seem like a re-write to introduce cheap action. But the character itself is much deeper than that. Maybe the first viewing of the movie doesn't make that obvious (all the insight into him is revealed before they go to Icarus I) but I see it that Pinbacker had a revelation that God wanted man to die as a species. The complete opposite of his mission (was he a fanatical terrorist to begin with or did the mission do this to him?) So he stayed alive to thwart future missions/be in the presence of ""God"".   He personifies a narrative that I don't think the story could've explored nearly as much without him. And sure, adds some action. Still one of my favourite films."
IAmA,3dvgvi,rslake,5,Mon Jul 20 08:22:53 2015 UTC,"The ending to sunshine wasn't horrible or even bad, it was good. The second half/pinbacker was.   also cillian turned full atheist after working on the movie  I believe in god on at least some level and the christian one at that. However I see cillian's point of view more then that user's review. Plus wasn't it Capa who had the recurring nightmare about falling into the sun? I think if the case was for it always to be a suicide mission he wouldn't of been scared but welcomed it and of been like their resident sun worshiper guy.   I'll still watch the movie eve after seeing it at least twice now, but pinbacker does nothing for me."

I don't know if it would really be worth his time unless some kind of fan mobilization could happen where the AMA ends up exposing a ton of new people to the band's music (that's what I would want to happen).   I am willing to try to drum up interest on music boards and the like. I could contact m. gira from doing concert photography back in the day, I just don't want to bug him in order for him to come here and have a few people ask him the same questions he's been asked a million times.   I know that happens to everyone who does AMAs, I just wonder if there are a ton of Swans fans on reddit who would make it worth his time.  He's terrifically smart, funny and caring.

IAmA,3e38yc,ESNMRA17,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:09:34 2015 UTC,"That's a great question! It really depends on the type of game, its scope, what medium/platform, how many people are working on it, and many other factors. Everything starts with the game design, and prototyping (always prototype early!) will help save you time and let you know if a game idea really is fun enough to be worth pursuing.  A great game idea can happen in a day, prototyping can take a few days or weeks, and then development can take months, or years.   Again, it really all depends on the game. But I'd say a MINIMUM of three months for the smallest of games, and up to three years for big and elaborate games. The parts that make the game ""good"" should be figured out during the early days of the project, but won't be fully polished and realized until the end.   Note: The discussion is actually going on in /r/boardgames/ and future questions should be posted there.

IAmA,3dy4y3,bemorebob,3,Mon Jul 20 17:03:17 2015 UTC,"We reduce them and put them out on the shop floor if they hit the best before date, which results in a hoard of people grabbing whatever stuff they can. We also have a group of regulars that wait an hour before the reduction time (as I work in an express store, thats usually between 6pm-8pm)   Out of date products, we put them in the waste section of the warehouse, count them and throw them away in the bins at the back of the store. We do get our fair share of bin divers on the night, so lately we place the bakery waste in the chiller and then throw it out before the store opens the following morning. (this can vary between stores)"

IAmA,3dy4y3,Scyentist,6,Mon Jul 20 17:57:44 2015 UTC,"Good question.  On bin diving in general, I don't care really if I'm perfectly honest with you. It can count under the Theft Act of 1968 however. (my own research, not Tesco)  However, with the actual bin divers, its a mixed bag. Due to the fact that some of them (rarely, mind you) take out of date stuff and try to refund it, which is a right pain in the neck for myself and the management as some are pretty persistent when they have no receipt. Overall, I can understand why people do it with the current situation some of them are in or have got themselves into and I sympathise with them most of the time."

IAmA,3dy4y3,MysticalTurban,9,Mon Jul 20 14:23:51 2015 UTC,"Long post here (sorry for keeping you)  One of the worst situations I witnessed was when a group of teenagers came into the store not too long ago. They were hurling racial abuse at my security guard (who is Pakistani) and ended up assaulting him by punching him and later throwing a glass bottle, which smashed off his chest. My supervisor** never even stepped in to help and just watched. (**EDIT: Supervisor, not manager. I wrote this a bit quickly, my bad.)  Another time was when one of my colleagues was shot at with an airsoft gun for banning a customer in the store. Police and forensics were in the store for hours. The person who was shot at never returned again (poor guy.)  Some of my colleagues have stolen food from the store. Including one team leader and her boyfriend, who was a CA (customer assistant) at my store, who would steal food on the late shift. Even being good friends with the guy and worked with him on that shift, I didn't even know until the stock count came back showing stuff going missing. These alongside many others.  In terms of staff treatment, I have seen supervisors & managers come and go. Some were really humble and helpful, some were bitchy and pretty shallow, but got the job done, and then there are those who were the ones who just harrassed me and a few of my colleagues.   One team leader (now left), always tried to keep me behind on my shift (I was 16 when I started and a little naive) and took minutes off my break for getting a quick drink or going to the toilet. Another guy, who was my duty manager around 2012, would often insult me openly in front of colleagues, mess up the store on purpose or made me and other colleagues do more work than others (favouritism) and tried to get me sacked due to a minor mishap.   My current store manager is a saint. One of the hardest working women you'll see in the workforce. She'll do her normal shift and come in at random times or stay a lot longer to keep the store running. She is a sarcastic, but nice woman and she is a valuable asset. My duty & supervisor currently, swan off in the back at times and disappear for long winded phone calls to their missus or sit down and take longer than usual breaks. This is prominent on late shifts.   The other CA's (customer assistants) like myself are the same too, hit and miss. The female staff are as you'll see in most workplaces, very shallow and tear into others all the time, but not all of them. The same with the guys too.   Overall, at the moment, I am treated quite well. The wage is quite reasonable, my current manager is liberal in terms of shift swaps & emergencies. My only issue is getting more hours (I've recently graduated) is very hard. My manager wants to give me more hours, but her higher ups won't allow it, especially with a major store closing down in the area.  Again, sorry the post took so long. I'm writing on my phone and there might be a couple of errors!"

You could pretty much replace the store name with one we have here and the stories sound similar.  I was just curious about the inner workings.

I don't think I'll see myself there by the end of the year, due to the lack of contracted hours given to me, and I don't particularly want a career at Tesco (ie. Graduate Schemes).  I'm lucky enough to have equal time on both tills and stock (Over the newbies however, I'm put on stock a lot more) and I'm alright with pretty much most of the staff there at the moment with the exception of one or two who are either too lazy or big-headed."

IAmA,3dy4y3,passthejerry,2,Mon Jul 20 22:24:20 2015 UTC,Most definitely moving onto something else. I don't see myself in a career with the store. I want to get out there and find something new really.

IAmA,3duer2,Darkomicron,108,Sun Jul 19 17:51:40 2015 UTC,"big questions! aha. i dont know how to give a satisfying short answer. but ill try. i started ""traveling"" 5 years ago, started in search of myself as i was lost and going through depressive identity crisis. i was 19 when i shaved my head to nothing and decided to sleep on the streets of florence in christmas time with 100 euros in my pocket (50 in pocket, 50 in shoe aha) as an attempt to clear my head from myself, and the life i considered to be too complicated to be in for me at the time. the plan was one month in florence, but this became 5 years of traveling around the world somehow, i never looked back and recently ive been living on an island called Koh Samed in Thailand for the past 5 months or so.  My future... like anyone is full of dreams and ambitions. my nearest future vision worth mentioning right now is a youtube channel about my travels, and experiences outside of myself that id like to share with anyone who's interested. i hope to give inspiration to those who seek it and even better if i can to those who don't :) i hope this answers something darkomicron. have a good one ;)"

I came over on a working holiday (Canadian) but switched to a spouse visa after getting married.  A woman I'd met in Canada was one of the reasons why I left everything behind to come here (although it had been a dream for many years).  I teach English now, but later this year I'm moving to my wife's hometown so we can join her family's farm.  After many years of offices, companies and corporate BS I'm really looking forward to a simple life involving honest work in the outdoors.  Rural Japan has a lot of appeal for me.  As for work visas, they really need to make it easier for people to obtain one.  Maybe once the population has fallen by an entire Canada by 2050 they'll change their tune?"

From the moment I was born  Life only gave me  Endless times I had to struggle     Every time I look in the mirror  And ask myself, what did I do wrong?  I have I done to deserve this?  It never gets better  Day after day     (Hoyung)  But don't give up  Don't back down, what this world gives  what you're given  What this unfair world gives  If you only take, nothing will change     Will you fight, or will you give up?  Will you give in to the fate you're given?  Don't turn you back to this world  Don't stay down  And look at us     (Chorus / Taewoo)  When you're tired and worn out, lean on me  I'll always be by your side  You'll never feel alone again  Because I'll hold your hand     (Denny)  It's too dark, I can't see a path  All I have is a one match one candle  What can I do  With just one candle  Does the darkness fade with just one candle     Far far away, a magnificent light  My movements struggling in the dark  To light, to that light  Even if I want to fly  My wings can't fly     (Hoyung)  But that's not true  If you light just one candle  So much changes  Because in the place around you thought was empty   There's another candle placed there     One more light becomes two candles  And you find another candle again  Becomes three candles, four candles  And the darkness starts to fade     (Chorus / Taewoo)  When you're tired and worn out, lean on me  I'll always be by your side  You'll never feel alone again  Because I'll hold your hand     (Junee)  Do you remember, without our father  Finally we did it  That was the story of my youth  Honestly, it was really hard     But I didn't give up there  I didn't lose my dreams, I didn't lose my courage  I kept trying and trying  And eventually made it here     Now I want to tell you guys  You can do it too     (Chorus / Taewoo)  When you're tired and worn out, lean on me  I'll always be by your side  You'll never feel alone again  Because I'll hold your hand"

IAmA,3duer2,thatbluesyguy,47,Sun Jul 19 16:17:35 2015 UTC,"i find that to be a big question. and naturally calls for a big answer. but 1st of all, this completely depends on your intention of travelling. either way i would say i find the most important thing to be attitude. for whatever reason you are travelling, or missioning in any direction, you gotta ... not believe.. but KNOW. that 1. its possible. 2. everything is always ok. 3. there is always an answer.  travelling can just be fun ofcourse, but it becomes meaningful when you know why you are doing what you are doing, and you are deliberate with your day and in the way in which you derive meaning from your experience.   i have almost always traveled on low, or no budget. and so this forced me to be a certain way and do certain things inorder to get what i want from my life. but this was ofcourse specific to me.  theres obviously alot more to be said here, but then again, im just tempted to answer the question with another question.  are you serious about your desire to travel? if so, then why?"

IAmA,3duer2,ryano52,28,Sun Jul 19 18:01:52 2015 UTC,"busking is an art form like anything else. what works best for you might not for others depending on .... everything pretty much. each style, person, country/city you busk in, calls for different skills. adapt. if my intention is creating positivity and having fun. i take away the guitar case, dont show that u want money. ppl will feel more comfortable to gather. and often end up tipping you anyway. and more often then not... i end up meeting the greatest people and making real freinds, with real couches to sleep on ;) if i want money, i play short sets. not long dragful ones. i turn my short set into a quick show. where i begin by attracting attention, telling my story (musically or however), reaching a climax, and at the biggest round of applause, i STOP. say thank you, put the guitar down and drink my water. this helps people feel like theyve seen the whole thing, and feel comfortable and carrying on with their lives (this is the streets... remember.) and ofcourse they will feel as thought it is a perfect cue to tip, (since everyone else is doing it). and once theyve all moved on, i can start again, with a fresh audience. this way i can spread my performance to more people, and obviously fill up my guitar case faster. again i insist, everyone has theyre own way. ive seen many many buskers along the way, and they do things i never have or would, but it works best for them. just do it ALOT. and the sooner you become immune to rejection, the more successful you will be."
IAmA,3duer2,Junkstar,37,Sun Jul 19 19:31:35 2015 UTC,I saw a busker once and all he did was stick a gun in my face and then demanded that I tip him all the money in my wallet.  Worst. Performance. Ever.

Do you have things like cell phones or other electronics while you travel? If so how do you maintain all of it? I know it's a lot but your time is very greatly appreciated sir"
IAmA,3duer2,bozobozo,4,Mon Jul 20 03:32:13 2015 UTC,"Regarding my possessions and maintenance of them. I learned a while back to keep with me only the bare necessities. I will show it all on my YouTube channel when its up, but i basically put my whole life into one biggish backpack and one guitar case. I put all my clothes in the guitar case, and often inside the body of the guitar itself. Apart from this... all i own is a portable studio (zoom r8) an effect pedal of some kind, laptop. And phone charger, external hardrive... etc.. all this fits in the bag. Done. Everytime i leave a country i will have accumulated a bunch of stuff.  I make point of throwing out the unnecessary, and giving away anything else. This way im free and light. ....... as to the 2st question. I obviously cannot tell anyone how to make their way. But ive met many people who havr their own unique way of ""gypsying around"" so to speak. Some who draw caricatures.  Sell jewelery. Dress up as a bush and stay still. Pantomime. Etc etc. Make it up man. Theres always, always something you can offer to the world. And as crazy as it sounds, if u KNOW (not ""believe"" or ""hope"" ) that everythinfs gonna work out somehow. It just will. Period. Maintaining a positive attitude regardless, and finding a way to sincerely feel greatful for whatever u get or lose, is gonna keep u inspired and ultimately grow in ur ability to be content most of the time, and as u keep doing whatever it is ur doing (given that u love it) ull eventually master it, and cash will just start flowing in. This is a quick answer. hope it is relevant :) Goodluck"

IAmA,3dttoj,anschelsc,78,Sun Jul 19 13:45:44 2015 UTC,"I think the answer is definitely yes. From what I understand, Varoufakis resigned because Tsipras wouldn't take the preparatory steps necessary to leave the Euro. Without taking those steps, the threat of a Grexit wasn't credible and Greece would almost certainly have to accept whatever bailout package was offered to them."
IAmA,3dttoj,mmmkunz,57,Sun Jul 19 16:33:26 2015 UTC,"Close but not quite. Varoufakis has been very vocal about not leaving the Euro. His plan was to default and remain within the EZ, while printing IOUs in the meantime. A lot of commentators have been talking about IOUs = Grexit, but that's simply not true. There are huge differences between IOUs and the Drachma which I won't get in to, but suffice to say that it was more potent as a political message than the act itself.  Really the dumb part was playing this game to begin with. Greece had a surplus and an economy that was finally starting to grow. All they had to do was finish implementing the reforms they promised the last time around. They were already able to tap capital markets again, so another bailout wasn't even necessary. Samaras lost his stomach, so we got this cynical charade."
IAmA,3dttoj,Scipio_Africanes,17,Sun Jul 19 17:18:02 2015 UTC,"Argentinian here. When my country defaulted on its huge debt in 2001, the government had to abandon a forced ""1 to 1"" parity between the Argentine peso the US dollar. Since they didn't want to spark hyperinflation after ditching this peg, the governments of each province would issue ""faux currency"" IOUs to pay their public employees. The peso was still perfectly acceptable, it was just that as the peso was worth way too much for our economy (cough Greece & the euro cough) there were too few of them.  By late 2002 the situation stabilised and the economy began growing again, and the exchange rate was about 2 pesos for a dollar. A devaluation, no doubt, but in no way a Zimbabwe-style hyperdevaluation-hyperinflation deathly cocktail.  By 2005 the government had enough money to pay the debts it had defaulted on, and thanks to being on a stronger negotiating position it managed to get a 50% haircut on those debts (don't weep for the investors, they knew well that they were lending money to a country which wouldn't be able to pay them, and even with the haircut they still got a profit from their investment).  I'm in no way suggesting that Greece would do as well as Argentina did if it left the Eurozone. Although my personal opinion is that, given the totally unsustainable deal they've just agreed with the Eurogroup, the most rational course of action for them would be to prepare their country for a Grexit, given that no Eurozone leader will commit electoral suicide by doing the economically literate and sensible thing: condining a large chunk of Greece's debt  Edit: grammar."
IAmA,3dttoj,Nabokovian97,11,Sun Jul 19 21:47:07 2015 UTC,"You had several advantages over Greece. First and foremost, an actual export-driven economy. And shortly after your default you were able to piggyback on the Brazil/China led decade-long commodity boom. Both of those meant that devaluation had huge multiplier effects economically.  The second and more technical point is that the peso was already in circulation. You didn't have to forcibly convert one currency into another, and more importantly you didn't have to introduce a currency in hugely volatile period. That's not trivial in the best of times.  Not only that, your currency had a natural stability of, as I mentioned before, positive balance of trade. Greece has never had positive balance of trade since they joined the Eurozone. That's a problem because it means there's a constant deficit of reserve FX, which constrains the country's ability to manage their currency. For a country as consumption dependent as Greece, that's a huge problem.  As for your ""economically literate"" solution, I'm not sure. Certainly if the goal is to boost Greek output, they could forgive a large part of their debt. Here's the problem - even if there was no debt, Greece would be running at a fiscal deficit with no way to borrow from public markets. Which means in less than a quarter Greece would need another aid package anyway, and who would give it to them?  Moreover, France and Germany would have no ability to prevent Spain or Portugal or Ireland or Italy from holding out for debt cuts, and that would be impossible because even France and Germany doesn't have the cash. Plus, you'd be asking several countries poorer than Greece to bail them out. At a basic level, that makes no sense. That's like making Detroit bail out Puerto Rico."

I'm not sure whether it's true that writing off a part the Greek debt would bankrupt France and Germany (much of that debt was originally bought by French banks, right?). Couldn't the ECB boost not just the Greek economy but all the Eurozone by increasing the money surplus until the euro devalues to a level that could help Eurozone countries' exports AND create a little bit of inflationary growth? (Phillips curve, anyone?)  Also, I think that even when an exit from the Euro would prove extremely damaging at the beginning, it's the only sensible course of action on the long run. As you've mentioned, there are countries poorer than Greece in the Eurozone, and I totally understand their voters' and politicians' feelings when they're asked to contribute in the bailout scheme. Although quite honestly, even if there were a Greek government willing to do all the ""sacrifices"" so that those poorer EZ countries won't feel bad, it'd be a Pyrrhic victory for them and the Eurogroup in general; the Greek debt is simply not sustainable, no matter how much of a primary surplus they run.

I said if they forgave Greek debt, they would also have to forgive Spanish and Irish and Portuguese debt almost for sure, and likely part of Italy's. It's a slippery slope - every government that had some form of austerity would revolt, and rightly so.  And you do realize the ECB has not only negative rates, but about as big of a QE program as is physically possible? I'm not sure what you want Draghi to do.

Perhaps the problem is that the whole single-currency project has, among its many flaws, a tendency towards the deflationary. So no matter how pro-stimulus is the central bank's monetary policy, it can't compensate for the lack of a fiscal union or other tools needed to make up for the huge economic and productive disparities within the Eurozone.   Nobody knows for sure, but I'd be wary of their financial system being able to withstand the kind of chaos that would generate. If nothing else, they should take this bailout package and then consider a surprise Grexit later in the year once the banks are open and not subject to runs.   I totally agree with this. But I'm dubious whether the Greek gov't will choose not to heed its electorate and actually prepare and eventually go forward with an euro exit, in much of the same way that it chose not to heed its people's clear anti-austerity message because in doing so it would have had to leave the euro without being prepared for it. Even though I insist that the latest bailout package is futile, I think it was a good call if it's a way of buying time so as to be able to leave the euro at some point in the future, when the country is prepared.  Although I don't know how the government is going to prepare Greece for it without causing public and causing the mother of all bankruns. When Argentina abandoned the peso peg, the first measure was to set a weekly withdrawal limit, but later on the billions of dollars that were deposited in bank accounts were converted into pesos at a loss for those savers. In this way the government managed to raise a lot of the funds it needed to keep running (a few years later thousands of savers sued the state for damages, naturally), but it was only successful because it was backed by the press, the local banks and mainstream economists. The most important local TV stations and newspapers (who had huge unpaid tax bills which were being forgiven by the gov't) kept reassuring the public that everything was OK, and that a ""pesification"" would never happen. I doubt that the Syriza government has such support from the Greek establishment; any attempt of simply preparing for a Grexit would be met with widespread alarm.  By the way, it's very nice to debate with someone who's as well informed and analytic as you are, as well as polite; very often all one gets from people who disagree with one are either empty soundbites or insults.

Yeah, I don't know that a full fiscal union is strictly required, but at the very least there needs to be a stronger central government to ensure key policies (employment, retirement, etc) are uniform across the entire zone, and more of one than there is now. To be fair, the deflationary tilt is most likely because of Europe's demographic (old and increasingly aging population) rather than a result of monetary union.

Especially with so much Western media attention, even if the Greek parliament controlled the local media directly it may not help that much. Interestingly on the legal front, Varoufakis himself raised the problem that it's unclear whether Greece could even convert Euro to Drachmas. Since it would almost certainly be a devaluation, and EU legal protections for individuals are so strong, it's likely that if citizens challenge the conversion in court they would win. So Greece would have to work out a loophole with EU courts, pay back citizens a post-conversion euro equivalent instead of just 1:1 (which would weaken Drachma even more), or in the worst case scenario leave not just the EZ but the EU also.  And that would be a death knell for an export-driven recovery because EU import restrictions are so tough. Russia and Turkey aren't exactly the best trade partners to depend on. Plus a lot of citizens working abroad in the EU with EU citizenship would be forced to return. Maybe that would be net beneficial because they're likely predominantly higher skilled labor.. but like the whole Grexit scenario it's a pretty big coin toss to make.

I suppose that because of things like these it's hard to extrapolate Argentina's (or any other Latin American country's) problems and their solutions to Greece, since LatAm countries have young populations and, even when their ultimate goal is to develop industrially, they have a solid amount of raw materials to export. Perhaps Greece's leaders were wrong to think that by simply creating the same welfare and social protection system rich countries have their country would automatically become one of them.  The truth is that the US and Western Europe became welfare states when unemployment was low and birth rates were high. If they had to be created today, when manufacturing jobs have been decimated by both deindustrialisation and automation and when the population is older than ever, it'd mean to eternally run budget deficits.  In a way, the current situation in the developed world seems to be mimicking (in its own way, of course) what happened to Latin America in the '80s: they took tons of debt to finance their deficits (which were a result of unproductive, stagnated economies), and then when the petrodollars run out and interest rates soared, huge debt crises ensued. Then in the '90s, all of those countries elected governments which promised to fix those problems by privatising state companies, reducing expenditure and de-regulating and de-centralising all they could.  It was argued that enacting these measures was the only thing these countries could do, but all they did was to sow the seed of the next crises: Mexico, Brazil, Uruguay and especially Argentina all were in the middle of one by late the '90s or the early noughties. They had racked up debt again, their economies only grew for the first few years, and they had in the process destroyed much of their industry, widened income disparities greatly, definanced their public sectors and endangered their economies by giving away companies which were the main players in key sectors (energy, transport, oil, telecommunications) to private owners that had no intention of running them for the benefit of their economies or workers (no surprise there, really).  My point is that this stagnated, low-growth, Victorian-like inequal shape the industrialised world is truly worring, and a threat to basically the huge middle class they have. I know there are demographic factors at play here, but really that's why many economists consider much of Europe's and the US's immigration policy to be demographic suicide, in the long run."

No one talked about California ""Exiting the dollar"". They used them to pay employees, until things stabilized.   Nobody talks about it with Puerto Rico either. That's because, unlike Greece, all US banks are governed federally, with federal FDIC insurance. Greece, not the ECB, guarantees its bank deposits, how much would you put your faith in that? The inability of a state to pass a budget doesn't make everyone worry about the viability of the US Dollar.  Contrast that to Europe, where every country (i.e. ""state"") has their own banking system. If Greece forcibly converts all deposits to Drachmas, everyone who stashed their money outside of the country in French or UK or German banks keeps their euros. Everyone too poor or financially unsavvy to do so gets screwed over, along with anyone on a state paid income."

From January 2015: ""Greece announced a primary budget surplus of €1.9 billion ($2.24 billion) for 2014"" Source. That followed a budget surplus in 2013 as well.    edit as noted by u/NoUseForAName123, that successful budget surplus was essentially the first step in a larger process.

IAmA,3dttoj,GudSpellar,11,Sun Jul 19 17:41:53 2015 UTC,"The problem with the surplus was that it wasn't sustainable. It had been achieved  through excessive taxation that could not last longer. Samaras knew that, as he also knew that he was about to miss the Troica targets unless he implemented more taxes. The political cost of that would be suicidal hence he opted for the exit and did not ask for an extension on the Troika review hoping that Syriza would fuck it up and soon he'd be back in power. Generally the return to growth narrative was a false one. It was only based on heavy taxation instead of reforms or investment and would not last long anyway."

The budget surplus's were before Greece's interest payments to her creditors, they were still technically running a deficit.   The whole thing is inherently unsustainable."
IAmA,3dttoj,MyFavouriteAxe,11,Sun Jul 19 18:05:49 2015 UTC,"There are many parts to this. By late 2014, Greece had surpassed their budget targets for three consecutive years.    Greece was also running a ""primary budget surplus"" (a budget surplus before making interest payments) in accordance with a long-term plan for returning the country to solvency. Basically, the first step of this plan is getting your fiscal house in order. In other words, getting your budget to the point where you are consistently bringing in more money than is going out. Then you can focus on economic growth and increased debt repayment.    In early 2015, the plan started really going off track. Greece had not yet implemented all initial terms of the plan and in fact began reversing some by re-hiring public sector workers who had been laid off, etc. As a consequence, the lenders began delaying/withholding aid payments to pressure Greece to see things through. The tension and politics ratcheted up from there.    TL;DR: Running a primary budget surplus (which is a budget surplus before making interest payments) was the first step in a longer-term plan for returning Greece to fiscal solvency. This may or may not have been a ""good"" plan, but things were generally on track until really jumping off the rails this year."

A primary account surplus doesn't help if you can't cut your loans or loan payments.    Running a primary budget surplus (which is a budget surplus before making interest payments) was the first step in a longer-term plan for returning Greece to fiscal solvency.    ""having a plan"" doesn't matter if the plan isn't feasible or realistic, which is what most independent economists would tell you. That's why Varoufakis called it ""extend and pretend"" - that's all that was happening.  The Eurogroup was living in a fantasy world.   It seems strange to think that everyone running a massive, technocratic government would be delusional, but just look at climate change or the Iraq War.  Clearly it's a thing that happens."

The whole thing is inherently unsustainable.   Not true at all. The US hasn't run a unified budget surplus since 2001. Our GDP's just grown. Greece's GDP was just starting to grow again, even if it was lower than it was pre-crisis. Getting back up above pre-crisis was never a short-term possibility no matter which route they took anyway."
IAmA,3dttoj,Scipio_Africanes,5,Sun Jul 19 18:47:59 2015 UTC,This suggests is still shrinking http://www.tradingeconomics.com/greece/gdp are you confusing it with their budget surplus?
IAmA,3dttoj,all2humanuk,6,Sun Jul 19 19:05:13 2015 UTC,"The US hasn't run a unified budget surplus since 2001. Our GDP's just grown.   Yeah but Greece need to run a budget surplus if GDP is shrinking for debt to remain sustainable (not that it's actually running a surplus due to repayments).  Problem is this shifts debt-based growth to homeowners and makes investment more difficult due to lack of government lending.  So budget surplus = lack of growth, lack of growth = more need for budget surplus to maintain a sustainable debt.  The solutions are that Greece begins growing substantially whilst maintaining austerity (wasn't happening before Tsipras, definitely isn't happening after for a year or so), or their trade balance compensates (it's on the rise, but still a deficit). Since neither are occurring, it's hardly strange that the debt remains unsustainable.  Best case situation for Greece would be if it received long term loans that enabled it to run at deficit whilst repaying short term debts - this would make growth easier to achieve and lower debt levels as % GDP faster in the medium term. But because it has to practise strict austerity policies to get its loans, it'll take significantly longer to recover.  Edit: somewhat ironically, guess why this is all a problem in the first place? The bursting of the US real estate bubble.  Guess why that happened (in part)? The budget surplus during the Clinton period!  Because politicians still haven't learned, after six depressions post-surplus, that budget surplus in a growing, major diversified economy is stupid. Easier to pretend government budgets work like a household budget, because that way a surplus sounds like you're doing a good job to the electorate!"
IAmA,3dttoj,googlyeyespy,2,Sun Jul 19 19:30:36 2015 UTC,"Well said. It is a very different approach from direct ""stimulus"", and calls for a plan that requires pretty strict adherence in the early stages.    The 30-year payment respite proposed by the IMF would help accelerate the process, and may be the only real way to salvage it other than a ""haircut"" at this point, but that is not going to be a popular option with some."

IAmA,3dttoj,ex_ample,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:01:27 2015 UTC,Yeah but Greece need to run a budget surplus if GDP is shrinking for debt to remain sustainable   There is no sustainable way to deal with a shrinking GDP and debt at the same time. If GDP shrinks you need to allocate more and more of your GDP to interest payments every year.  That means you need to raise taxes every year. That chokes off the economy and causes more contraction.   The only reasonable thing to do is either cut the debt or wait for growth to kick in to start making payments.
IAmA,3dttoj,ex_ample,14,Sun Jul 19 23:59:43 2015 UTC,"Their GDP crashed, and austerity is the prime suspect for this. Their debt-to-GDP ratio worsened considerably despite the budget surplus. At this point, they have ~175% debt to GDP ratio at 3% interest/year. Consider a normal healthy first world economy grows at ~5% per year (very, very loose with numbers here); you can realize that they can't pay back the debt this way.  The problem is that the austerity shrank the economy faster than it could pay off the debt, so to say."
IAmA,3dttoj,VodkaHaze,10,Sun Jul 19 18:12:51 2015 UTC,Their GDP crashed because it was being inflated with all the borrowed money that wasn't there anymore. Austerity was a side effect of not being able to borrow money anymore. It didn't cause the drop in GDP.

IAmA,3dttoj,VodkaHaze,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:26:50 2015 UTC,"Well after years of having their economy destroyed by austerity there will be plenty of ""development"" that will need to be done."
IAmA,3dttoj,ex_ample,2,Sun Jul 19 19:39:29 2015 UTC,"Pay careful attention.  A primary account surplus only means you're taking in more money in taxes then you're spending prior to making interest payments.    Because they couldn't go through bankruptcy the way a business or person could they couldn't get out of the whole even though the government was ""profitable"" prior to interest payments. They were going to have to continue to borrow and run up the deficit forever, especially if more austerity measures contracted their economy even more.   Remember, it's a negative feedback cycle - even with a primary account surplus you still have a budget deficit. So you impose austerity to cover the deficit, and that contracts the economy more, so next year you have even less money and need to cut again, etc, etc.   If you look at Greece's GDP, it's been going down every year since 2008. So a Primary account surplus in '12 wouldn't mean a primary account surplus in '15, given an equal level of taxation.   Your logic only works if GDP growth is positive. But that can't be guaranteed under austerity"

What's the point of democracy if you just do the opposite of what you run on? That's the kind of thing that makes people extremely cynical about democracy in the first place.

They might have been growing but would they have continued to grow if more austerity was imposed? It's not that clear.   Well the dumb part of their stance is that outside of pension cuts, the remaining measures weren't direct austerity.

A deal with a government doesn't mean anything if voters don't support it. I think European technocratic leaders have been used too ignoring politics for such a long time that they didn't seem to understand that in order to make a deal with a democratic nation you need something that a majority of the people will support.   In my view Tsipras when he submitted nearly the same deal that had been voted down in the referendum, and his complete unwillingness to consider a Grexit. That meant he had less then zero leverage because he knew any deal that he made could be overturned by the same voters who voted against the last deal. So as a result the Eurogroup demanded collateral, external controls, and the like.   I think the ones who really used Game theory the best here were the Germans.  They knew that Tsipras placed a very high value on avoiding Grexit because he wouldn't even do the preparations Varoufakis wanted. So, when Schäuble started publicly stating that a Grexit might be the best thing to do that put a lot of pressure on him. Now that the deal is signed Merkel is publicly stating Grexit shouldn't happen, but she wasn't contradicting Schäuble during negotiations    I went in with an impression that he's just another annoying politician but came away impressed at a personal level. But that didn't exactly help him or Greece.   It might have been more helpful if he'd been there from the beginning. But he came in pretty damn late in the ""game"".  And you could argue that the main reason things went bad is because Tsipras lost his nerve at the end - he wasn't willing to engage in brinksmanship because he got convinced that Schäuble actually wanted a Grexit and that merkel was fine with it.   To be honest, I think a grexit or a parallel currency would have worked best.  The state California issued IOUs in 2009 essentially issuing it's own dollar-pegged currency. Things went fine.

California issued IOUs because it couldn't pass a budget, not for lack of money. Also, personal accounts are still FDIC insured by the Federal government, and banks (despite the hate here for ""big banks"") are so insulated from risk from any single state that they'd barely be impacted. Neither are the case for Greece.  Varoufakis himself has written about the problems of dual currency. Feel free to read it. That's why he only wanted to use it as a bluff."

However, today i have difficulties finding those articles. Not a problem, did find quite alot of articles. The last 3 articles openly state the blackmailing, but they are all in german. Google translate however does a really good job there.   https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2015/04/14/gree-a14.html   There is a direct connection between the fact that Germany supported the acceptance of Greece into the European Union in 1981 and the euro zone in 2001, and the fact that the Greek government did not demand reparations after German reunification in 1991.   http://www.keeptalkinggreece.com/2015/03/11/greek-govt-to-demand-wwii-reparations-from-germany-may-confiscate-goethe-institute/   According to Greek media, already in 2000, PASOK Justice Minister had signed the court decision and a justicial clerk appeared at the door of Goethe Institute in Athens. “However, the Justice minister withdrew his signature. after a couple of days later Germany approved the entrance of Greece to the Euro zone,” notes Proto Thema.   An interview in english by SPIEGEL mentions this briefly: http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/are-greek-world-war-ii-reparations-demands-unfair-a-1023474.html   In the past decades, Germany has provided enormous transfer payments, to Greece as well -- not as reparations, but as a part of European integration. [...]When the country was accepted as a member of the European Community in 1981, it was a tottering candidate. In in 2001, when Greece was admitted into the economic and currency union, people didn't look very closely when the Greeks falsified their accounts.   This guardian article also mentions it between the lines http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/08/germany-divided-over-greek-demand-for-2787bn-in-war-debt   Despite acknowledging the damage that Germany caused Greece during the war, commentators feel that there are both legal and political reasons to refuse to pay reparations. Writing on the N-TV website, Andreas Theyssen pointed out that not only did Germany pay Greece 115m deutschmarks in 1960 (worth about £150m today), but Greek governments were notably quiet on the issue in 1981 and 2001, when Athens was lobbying to join the EU and the eurozone.

If you believe that he was insincere, or has since deviated from this stance, you might want to be more clear in exactly what parts of the negotiations you're referring to.   Because I spent many years during my previous life as an academic researching game theory, some commentators rushed to presume that as Greece’s new finance minister I was busily devising bluffs, stratagems and outside options, struggling to improve upon a weak hand.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  If anything, my game-theory background convinced me that it would be pure folly to think of the current deliberations between Greece and our partners as a bargaining game to be won or lost via bluffs and tactical subterfuge."
IAmA,3dttoj,ex_ample,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:07:19 2015 UTC,"he's very clearly denied using game theory, and explained why he thought it a bad idea.    It's always a good idea to use game theory.  You just have to figure out the right utility function.  If you place a high value on preserving the EU then you have to factor that in when you calculate moves.  So for example even if you think you can get a better deal by exiting,  you wouldn't actually do it because your calculated ""score"" would end up lower.   Ideally you want a situation where both sides calculate their utility differently so you get net positive outcome. Game theory doesn't mean calculating things as a zero-sum game.    If anything, my game-theory background convinced me that it would be pure folly to think of the current deliberations between Greece and our partners as a bargaining game to be won or lost via bluffs and tactical subterfuge.   He doesn't say you shouldn't use game theory, just that it would be a bad idea to use bluffs and tactical subterfuge. In the real world, obviously, there would be a good chance of your plot getting called out - these conferences involve a lot of spying and it would be absurd to think that you could conspire with other MPs without Germany or the NSA getting wind of it.   In that sense, then trying to do a bluff has a high game-theory ""cost"".  It would be like trying to bluff in poker if you though there was a 99% of your opponent seeing your cards.  But that doesn't mean you don't use game theory to figure out optimal moves.  Not doing it can only result in a worse outcome, on average (of course you may get lucky. Like going all in on a pair of sixes, then drawing two more sixes in poker.  It was a bad move and on average a losing move. But of course bad moves sometimes win. )"

I could feel her pain and how hard this must be on you as you were negotiating.  I completely sympathize with Greeks. They are between the rock and hard place.   You must have read Micheal Lewis's beware of Greek bearing bonds.   Tax compliance in Greece has been extremely poor while the rich live in luxury and pay no taxes.  In Amsterdam the prostitutes also pay taxes. Why should the poor of Europe bear the burden for their compliance when the people in Greece have  not to paid their fare share.  You say you are not a politician - Why then did you say that the banks will open two days, when as someone who is a trained economist and had participated in the meetings with the troika knew that was not going to happen. Isn't this what politicians do - fudge the facts when the truth was you did not know. How has this 60 euro limit affected you personally.

IAmA,3e2p4o,Fuzzl,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:27:52 2015 UTC,"A lot of programs these days use a what you see is what you get kind of scripting, there is no need to rewrite every single function that has been created already, even the new Unreal Engine is going to use templates which, for people like me is extremely awesome!!!  I'm just your regular 8bit music creator with a little too much time so I add games to my music albums, takes about a year to create them but it's just awesome to shape my own world for my creative alter ego. I have my experience at a bigger studio as a QA tester which makes finding bugs and killing them easier with the experience I got there.   The most important pieces of advice I can give you is... START SMALL!!! Don't start thinking about massive projects because you are going to lose yourself in such a project. Just start small, get the feeling of what a program is actually doing when playing a game.  Expect to lose interest in playing games casually case the deeper you dive into this world, the less secrets it holds to you. You are going to recognize things in certain games and it's going to spoil the fun of playing games like you used to.  Last but not least... EVERYONE has idea's!! An idea is nothing special at all. It's great that you have them but please do not go to any game dev company with just your idea no matter how awesome it is. Work out that idea into a concept. The mechanics are much more important then that idea which you can write down in two scentinces.  Very last but not least. Do whatever you want and love and never let anyone hold you back, only then you can realize your dreams."

IAmA,3e2p4o,mildspring,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:04:01 2015 UTC,"Disclaimer: I made a few games published in google play (one in Amazon), they are very small and had no success.   My background is I'm a software developer full time working at a company unrelated to making games, we make enterprise software.  I have a BS in Computer and Information Science I have never worked for a game company, most my gaming endeavors have been solo, one was paired up with previous co-worker. The hardest part is finishing the game.  It's pretty easy to do basics - things like making characters move, but when you start adding menus and any type of polish, the project becomes less fun and more like regular work.  It isn't easy to push yourself to finish it.   There aren't technical difficulties with publishing to google play store or amazon, but I found some issues in amazon documentation which made integration into their play service harder than it should have been.  It looked like they made updates to code, but not to documentation.   I never had a problem with starting coding (there are two separate games that are right now in beginning of development right now), my problem has always been to keep going at same project. The few times I was able to finish a game, it was because I pushed myself to do something every day for that 1 game (and not move onto something else or stop entirely - which is common).  Even for half an hour, I pushed myself to do something.  So my advice is to not stop until you're done. You can take a break after you're done though before next project. Even if all you do is test  your game, and document issues, or you write up how you may solve them without coding - just don't stop, make sure to keep going. Solo developer mostly, the one time I made a game with someone else, knew the person from previous employment.   There are a lot of INDIE people in these forums posting when they make a game trying to promote it. You can google for some prior posts, and most likely you can message people from those posts ... at worst there won't be a reply.  If there are any questions to me, I will reply to them later tonight.  (for my proof, you can look at my history, i did an AMA a while ago, there should be links to proof there.)"

Sometimes, and frankly I don't remember all of those votes, one is put in a position of having to make very very difficult choices about whether you vote to provide food for hungry kids or health care for people who have none and other programs. But, in general, I do support increasing funding for NASA.   Kind of a half answer. ""Yes, I'd love to spend money on NASA"" is different than ""I would seek to increase their budget.""

It was a Belgian Tervuren. I went to go say hi and check him in and he went for my face. I told his owners I didn't feel comfortable grooming their dog if he bites and they told me he would be ok as long as I don't touch him -.- they were pissed when my manager had my back.   Quite a few. Someone came in with their Newfoundland month or so ago, the dog was really matted and I told them it would be a short haircut. The dog had explosive diarrhea on my leg and didn't want to stand for more than 5 minutes. The owner was pissed it took more than our 3-4 hour window even though I explained I was doing the best I could.

Maybe they think it's a remote sensing kind of situation. You sort of feel through the dog's pelt from a distance.   yeah he ate a bunch of cat poo today   Unreasonable expectations are us.  Be more firm when you set the customer's expectations. ""This dog's pelt is really matted, that will make grooming more complicated.""

IAmA,3e16tn,Jawbreaker93,2,Tue Jul 21 04:40:07 2015 UTC,Oh you probably were asking as a pet parent. You can't be nervous. They can tell you are scared and think they should be scared too. Also bring them every 6 weeks or so so it's a regular trip

I'm worried that you will think I'm hurting your little baby when I'm just trying to ride out a hissy fit.  It also is kind of annoying if you are trying to get your dogs attention and take pictures, as soon as your dog sees you they go crazy and are done for the day, they usually won't stray still anymore once they see mom or dad.

IAmA,3dv8oi,nnopainnogainn,15,Sun Jul 19 20:19:52 2015 UTC,When did you know you had a problem?  What made you decide that surgery was necessary?
IAmA,3dv8oi,exwasstalking,20,Sun Jul 19 20:21:51 2015 UTC,"I went in to the ER with a small thrombosed one about 10 years ago. The situation slowly got worse. I didn't always have blood but eventually they had to always be manually ""reduced"" by pushing them back in. For years I was just wiping hemorrhoids. That gets old. Even though they're NOT cancer and do not become cancer, you can imagine the stress. I needed relief from that just as much as the medical side."
IAmA,3dv8oi,sadpandadude,4,Sun Jul 19 20:25:56 2015 UTC,"this!  having suffered for 4 years i am finding it pretty hard to cope. I was pretty much turned away from the docs 7 times, as I am an early 30's male in fairly good shape, so pretty much just advice of 'drink more water', 'change your diet', etc all of which I was doing anyways.  Its hugely stressful, always uncomfortable, can't really sit at all. Going to the bathroom is a nightmare.  How soon after surgery did you see improvement?"
IAmA,3dv8oi,beholdkrakatow,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:23:50 2015 UTC,Not op but it took my mom at least 6 weeks. She regretted the surgery the whole time but it's been years and I think she's glad she got it done.

But you have to think of it from the perspective of what kind of relief as I had no pain prior.... but when I shit no ""guests"" are there to hang out.

IAmA,3dv8oi,Psychh,9,Mon Jul 20 03:10:21 2015 UTC,That's odd. Coffee is what keeps me regular.   I think a lot of people are getting hemorrhoids now because they sit on the can for too long reading their phones.
IAmA,3dv8oi,Psychh,2,Mon Jul 20 03:51:41 2015 UTC,Coffee is a diuretic but caffeine can cause dehydration and in turn constipation

IAmA,3dv8oi,Moscadilia,10,Mon Jul 20 15:11:47 2015 UTC,Can you give a layman's version of what the surgery was?  Why did it take you ten years to decide to have it surgically resolved?  Hope you feel better and keep feeling better!  Edit: how --> hope
IAmA,3dv8oi,Moscadilia,13,Mon Jul 20 00:41:52 2015 UTC,The surgery uses Doppler to locate the arteries feeding the hemorrhoids. It runs multiple rounds of stitching around the artery and then drops down to the hemorrhoid. Once it's at the bottom of the hemorrhoid they basically tie it into a knot where the artery was and it lifts the hemorrhoids up higher. No actual cutting.  This process returns the anatomy and cuts of the blood supply to the hemorrhoids. Super cool technology.   The wait was out of fear. Nothing more. Lots of horror stories on the internet mine was nothing like that at all
IAmA,3dv8oi,Moscadilia,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:43:59 2015 UTC,Good call not getting them cut out. I had a hemorrhoidectomy last October and it still hasn't healed. I hope this is the end of your problems.
IAmA,3dv8oi,Moscadilia,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:21:10 2015 UTC,What was your healing like? What stage were you? Internal?
IAmA,3dv8oi,IrishBA,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:30:43 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure of the stage, but I had an internal one that I had to manually push back in, and two really bad external ones. The external ones had gotten worse and worse to the point where I had to take a week off of work before the surgery because of the pain. He took out the internal one while he was dealing with the external ones, since they're connected. The external ones were definitely the reason and the focus, though the removal of the inside has caused all of the issues afterwards.    The healing process was the most painful thing I've ever experienced, by far. I wouldn't wish it on anyone. The pain really was, as they say, like shitting out a cactus, for the first week or two at least. There was also constant leaking, so I had to have gauze taped in the area and changed throughout the day for a few months. The outside healed really quickly, but the inside has been causing issues ever since. i actually went back for a follow-up appointment, just to check things out, and he decided it would be a good idea to cut out MORE for some reason. That was half a year ago, and I still have bleeding after every bowel movement, with 1-4 pain most of the day. I'm going to see a specialist about it soon, hopefully the surgery parts are done with though..."
IAmA,3dv8oi,AsRandomly,2,Mon Jul 20 16:52:23 2015 UTC,This is the wild part about this surgery; experiences vary.   I looked up reviews on EVERY doctor in my area that offered this. Then I looked at court records to see who was sued a lot. I picked the best. Turns out he had only done a dozen of these but he said only one had to come back for banding. I thought those were great odds. You can always see a new doc. My experience is to not mention what another doc thought as they tend to be swayed by another docs diagnosis.
IAmA,3dv8oi,ESNMRA17,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:56:51 2015 UTC,"I definitely regret not seeing a specialist from the start. The one covered by my health insurance was on vacation at the time, so my doctor's office picked a general surgeon as the quickest option under my health plan."

IAmA,3dv8oi,Immortal_Azrael,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:24:19 2015 UTC,Never
IAmA,3dv8oi,DeadAgent,8,Mon Jul 20 20:16:38 2015 UTC,From what I understand from asking my doctor about mine basically they cut them open drain them out(They consist of mostly coagulated blood) and remove the clot that started it. I'm sure there is some pain killer involved as well.  That was half a year ago so I don't remember much about what he said. For all I know there might be different procedures depending on the doctor.  OP can feel free to correct me.
IAmA,3dv8oi,drunk_haile_selassie,7,Mon Jul 20 02:34:06 2015 UTC,"There are many ways to do it. Traditionally they would cut them out. That's very old school and very painful. Newer solutions include rubber banding, PPH (stapling) and even laser!"
IAmA,3dv8oi,legotri,9,Mon Jul 20 02:54:01 2015 UTC,Is it bad that I expected a before/after picture of your butthole as proof? oh internet...what have you done to me
IAmA,3dv8oi,SPARTAN-113,4,Mon Jul 20 04:06:39 2015 UTC,Honestly you couldn't even tell prior. In healing I have one that is protruding. Only pain I have. I imagine they ligated it which is why it hurts a little. I read many reviews that this was common and it would go away.
IAmA,3dv8oi,Immortal_Azrael,8,Mon Jul 20 04:12:14 2015 UTC,Was your bleeding bad? I've got them also but mines only the external one and isn't as large. My parents keep saying I'm too young to have them but I got them at around 20. Its not like I actively contracted it or anything. When did you have yours?
IAmA,3dv8oi,greffedufois,6,Mon Jul 20 00:58:24 2015 UTC,Started at 25. Internal only. They can get worse. Just take care of it now and eat smart. Technology has come a long way and is on your side!
IAmA,3dv8oi,greffedufois,4,Mon Jul 20 02:40:15 2015 UTC,I've already gotten a consult and I was told to watch my diet and just put it in if it hurts. I want it out but its still pretty small to have to undergo surgery. Was yours painful that's why you got it removed?
IAmA,3dv8oi,VelociraptorCatapult,4,Mon Jul 20 02:53:20 2015 UTC,"I had zero pain. Maybe that's why it took so long to go for it?  Sometimes if I stood for hours on end it would hurt. Mine were classified as ""pretty large"" by my doctor after he put a camera in my butt"
IAmA,3dv8oi,greffedufois,4,Mon Jul 20 03:01:01 2015 UTC,Ohhh wow. I guess the downside of it having it out is that it hurts but at least I won't need anything up my butt.
IAmA,3dv8oi,VelociraptorCatapult,5,Mon Jul 20 03:58:38 2015 UTC,If yours is small you can just have it banded. Takes mere minutes. You can walk out.
IAmA,3dv8oi,egg_on_your_face,5,Mon Jul 20 04:07:34 2015 UTC,Banded?
IAmA,3dv8oi,greffedufois,6,Mon Jul 20 04:19:35 2015 UTC,They put a rubber band around it. It dies and falls off.
IAmA,3dv8oi,gutter_rat_serenade,2,Mon Jul 20 04:24:43 2015 UTC,Exactly what the word meant but had no idea that it would work that way.... Interesting. I shall do more research on banding now. Thanks a lot man. Happy hemorrhoid free day!

IAmA,3dv8oi,nicoekies,8,Mon Jul 20 03:05:16 2015 UTC,I've heard that the design of modern toilets is largely responsible. Basically the human body isn't really meant to poop while in a sitting position and hemorrhoids are almost unheard of in countries where people still squat to poop.
IAmA,3dv8oi,sadpandadude,16,Sun Jul 19 21:07:42 2015 UTC,"It's totally possible to squat poop on a normal Western-style toilet if you're light enough (I'm about 6'1"", 160 lbs. and do it all the time). It actually really makes pooping easier. I call it 'gargoyling' because you're perched up on the toilet like some kind of poo gargoyle."

IAmA,3dv6v2,chrisjay318,3,Sun Jul 19 20:15:34 2015 UTC,"BO: By far it wasn't the first film, but I saw Raiders of Lost Ark and when I walked out I told my dad what I wanted to do the rest of my life, and my dad said: ""An Archeologist!?""

Then it just freaked me out, but it was awesome at the same time that I felt that from a story that was drawn. It wasn't reality it was this other thing, and from that point on I knew there was a difference between reality and stories, but that stories came from reality, and I preferred thinking in terms of stories.

Your two recent films Rise of the Guardians and Epic were the final push I needed to actively pursue a career in animation. Unfortunately, I can't afford to go back to school for it full time.

IAmA,3dv6v2,missmintygreen,4,Sun Jul 19 20:16:03 2015 UTC,"WJ: Study the masters of animation. Live and breathe what you learn from them. Internalize every lesson that you can see. Read, devour, become the art form. Treat it as a religion, or a calling. And if you're good, your talent will shine through, and people will hire you. You don't have to go to college to learn this. You just have to want it so bad that you can't not do it."

IAmA,3dv6v2,WalrusWinks,4,Sun Jul 19 20:47:31 2015 UTC,"Dear Mr. Joyce, I know many people don't give him much thought when talking about the movie, Rise of the Guardians, but for me, the character I was able to relate to the most was young Jamie Bennett. I saw so much of myself in him from when I was a child, and can still relate to his wanting to believe in fantastical beings and pursuit for the truth of the supernatural. I also thought his relationship with Jack was especially endearing and significant. So, getting down to it, my question is: can we expect to see more of him, specifically in Guardians of Childhood? Also, if you've given any thought to it, what would he be like as a teenager? What would his aspirations be?"
IAmA,3dv6v2,WalrusWinks,3,Sun Jul 19 20:58:43 2015 UTC,"WJ: Jamie was our way of giving the audience a sort of identifiable every kid. So as his character took shape we just thought of the things we wanted him to embody that we all had felt about belief and imagination and that sort of fall from grace when you have to accept the fact that a lot of these things aren't real. But the belief in them is really the most awesome part of the experience, and in the way it makes these characters real. I want to leave Jamie exactly as he is and let people like yourself imagine his further adventures."

Do you have any favorite memories from the production of that film? As production designer, what were some of the locations and scenic touches that you created?"
IAmA,3dv6v2,KSClaw,4,Sun Jul 19 20:08:43 2015 UTC,"WJ: One of my favorite things was Brandon and I went to a bunch of junk stores and bought all this metal junk. Like old pressure cookers and waffle irons, and coffee pots and just nutty metal stuff. And we built a miniture city in my living room out of that junk. That became the template of the whole look of Robots. As the production designer we sort of inspire a team to find the visual language that everybody agrees works for the story and the characters, and is cool. The whole process of making the movie with the team and with Chris Wedge was more fun than recess, but politics of the studio filmmaking can weary the happiest spirit."

Will there ever be any hope of actually getting good, quality merchandise for Rise of the Guardians? Things like...Jack's Hoodie, maybe a toy Ruby Memory box, stuffed plushie Nightmares, maybe even something cute like a Sandman Nightight? All of your fans would -love- to have stuff like that!"
IAmA,3dv6v2,MoonclipperStowaway,3,Sun Jul 19 20:28:39 2015 UTC,"WJ: Maybe. I'm thinking about. I just finished the Jack Frost book. Everyone who wants a sequel to happen to call Jeffrey Katzenberg at Dreamworks studio, and not to hang up until you talk to him. Tell them how essential it is that another Rise of the Guardians film be made. As for the merchandise, call Jeffrey Katzenberg [laughs] send him telegrams, letters, fruitcakes, pints of blood, anything that'll get them to do this very simple, profitable, and necessary extension of our global culture. And bless you all."
IAmA,3dv6v2,CobraCornelius,3,Sun Jul 19 21:08:33 2015 UTC,"Have either/both of you seen the mini-series ""Over the Garden Wall?""  The series draws upon a lot of early animation influences that I recognize in the aesthetic of Moonbots as well.  It seems like something you would enjoy!  Lots of those rubber hose arms."
IAmA,3dv6v2,CobraCornelius,2,Sun Jul 19 20:36:45 2015 UTC,BO: Over the Garden Wall is definitely one of the most exciting things I've seen on TV over the past year. Please start a petition and let Curtis Lelash at Cartoon Network that you'd like Moonbot to do a mini series in the same tone as Over the Garden Wall

IAmA,3dv6v2,KSClaw,3,Sun Jul 19 20:50:45 2015 UTC,"You have blown minds for decades, probably your whole lives - what is blowing your minds today?   What has your biggest struggle ever been?  Is there any movie or tv show that people can't access today, b/c of licensing or whatever, that you wish they could?"
IAmA,3dv6v2,andrejason,3,Sun Jul 19 20:38:01 2015 UTC,"WJ: I saw about 4,000 people riding their bicycles naked in St. Louis yesterday, and that really messed me up. But what blew my mind -- there's this cool thing in New York a puppet show called Ada/Ava. Struggle: Creatively...Realizing when you're wrong is tough, but once you get over that it makes everything so much easier. Movie that can be accessed: There's an amazing short called Blaze Glory that's about the trippiest thing you'll ever see. Blaze Glory is Imagination with execution, but it's still a hallucination. Also more work by Lottie Reninger.  BO: Things that are blowing my mind are: Magic Leap, Punch Drunk Theater. Struggle: Balancing patiences and perseverance with sanity. It's a fine line. There's a quote by Thomas Edison that we often look back on: ""vision without execution is a hallucination"". Movie that can be accessed: This is something that's not that old, but certainly hard to find - a place where you can tune into the exciting experimental use of film for shorts and music videos. Back in the 80s there was this thing called MTV and they used to show music videos. Late at night they would show this show called Liquid Television. Sure Youtube and Vimeo do a form of this, but rarely do you get to experience something that's curated like Liquid Television. We got to see The Dancing Pig. It wasn't the Lumiere Brothers. It was another group. It was made in the 19-teens. It's actually an incredible costume. It's the most bizarre and captivating cosplay caught on film. We got to see it in it's most purest form. An restored print using a hand crank exactly how it was first shown one hundred years ago. You could only see it at the TCM Movie Fest.   WJ: It would be awesome to see things like Liquid Television on a movie screen. TCM or Turner Classic Movies has a film festival every year where they show some of the rarest and most amazing stuff. In the most beautiful screening rooms in the world and it's a revelation. It would be great if TCM Movie Fest could go everywhere in America."
IAmA,3dv6v2,WalrusWinks,3,Sun Jul 19 21:00:01 2015 UTC,Hello! Both of your artworks are fantastic btw! All of your works inspire me so much. Thank you for creating so much wonder and hope that inspires children and people everyday -- But my question is 'what advice would you give a young artist who is starting to doubt themselves about their artwork? What tips would you give in drawing/creating something new so that THEY can inspire others too?'
IAmA,3dv6v2,burningeraph,2,Sun Jul 19 20:40:05 2015 UTC,"Both: Thank you for enjoying our artwork!  BO: Sharing is important. Sharing your gifts with not just your family or friends, but as many people as you can in really important. You'll make an important connection. Try to tell stories through your art. Try to tell personal stories. That's where true meaningful connection will inevitably happen.   WJ: Just remember that everybody's story matters. And if you can tell your story truthfully people will recognize it's power."

IAmA,3dv6v2,MoonclipperStowaway,3,Sun Jul 19 21:21:20 2015 UTC,Hey William and Brandon! Thank you so much for being here . First of all i got to  meet you guys last Ctn and it was a blast! I was never familiar with the work you have done but I fell in love after I found out you guys did Robots and when I watched the fantastic flying booksof mr morris lessmore. The Mobile games were too adorable and cute as well! I will be graduating this September from Art school and what i want to do for living is Vis dev and Illustration. The problem is I have been very very Lost about how to start and where. I would Love to know about how you guys started in this industry and if there is any advice you can give me or anyone else who is new and want to start fresh in industry!  Also Would love to know  what is the process when you guys try to hire an artist! What qualities do you look for in their work/portfolio and what goes through your head?! Thank you so much!
IAmA,3dv6v2,WalrusWinks,2,Sun Jul 19 20:57:12 2015 UTC,"BO: We can only speak from our personal experiences and how we've done it. That being said for me I have always like and enjoyed paving my own path and creating the job vs. applying for it. It comes with greater frustration and risk, but with greater reward and satisfaction.   WJ: I second that."
IAmA,3dv6v2,heysaratoga,3,Sun Jul 19 21:21:36 2015 UTC,"""Meet the Robinsons"" is one of my favorite movies.  At what point did the film move beyond the book in order to take on the theme of adoption/letting go of the past?  Was this a direction Mr. Joyce wanted it to go?"
IAmA,3dv6v2,WalrusWinks,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:05:36 2015 UTC,"WJ: That came into the development process about 12 years into the development of the film. It originated with the director as it reflected his childhood experiences. I think it worked within the context of presenting Wilbur as a dreamer and outsider, but it was not my first choice for the direction of the story and I've always felt a little ambivalent about it."
IAmA,3dv6v2,WalrusWinks,3,Sun Jul 19 21:26:42 2015 UTC,Did you see the 2011 animated short Wild Life?
IAmA,3dv6v2,MoonclipperStowaway,2,Sun Jul 19 21:05:50 2015 UTC,"BO: Yes we did. It's a cool one. The two women filmmakers who created it are very sweet and have a very unique outlook on the world. They've been nominated several times.   WJ: Yeah, that was awesome. We love hanging out with them. They're like us. They're artists."

IAmA,3dv6v2,andrejason,2,Sun Jul 19 20:06:28 2015 UTC,"WJ: 1. I came up with the idea when i was in the 3rd grade when I saw my first James Bond move with Sean Connery and I thought Santa Claus must be as cool as Sean Connery and I came up with an early idea of what his life must be like: a super cool spy bandit from bandit from long ago. 2. Sort of the same thing it seemed more interesting that he started out as not a totally good guy, but became a good guy because of what happened to him. It was sort of merging Robin Hood and James Bond because Robin Hood was a normal guy and became a hero because of what was going on around him. He became a hero for the underprivileged, and kids are always treated as second class citizens and Santa Claus' mission was to make their lives easier and inventive and full of imagination."

IAmA,3dv6v2,KSClaw,2,Sun Jul 19 20:25:42 2015 UTC,I'm a character animator that's very interested in what you guys are doing. I grew up outside of Atlanta and have moved to Los Angeles and Vancouver in order to find work but would love to get closer to my family. I applied last year when you were looking but wasn't selected. I've now finished my mentorship and am poking around studios. I recently watched some reels from your animators and noticed there was feature experience in a few. What are the things you are looking for in reels that make people stand out besides the basics like understanding of the principles?
IAmA,3dv6v2,KSClaw,2,Sun Jul 19 20:07:01 2015 UTC,"BO: As it relates to animators and all of our artists, we're very selective as it relates to choosing people. As it relates specifically to animators. We have to sense that they're a great actor that there's an actor inside of them and they have to be able to translate that into the puppets that you create. They don't have to be pretty they just have to perform well. But if you create a thesis or short and you create it yourself and you have a beautiful looking character that performs incredibly well that's always a plus.   WJ: We look for a spark of divine and hilarious and tragic and fun."

Dolby has a new projection system called Dolby Vision, and I'm excited to hear where this goes and grows within the United States. I believe Look Cinemas have Atmos theaters, and if you go to Dolby.com you can find them. It is a joy to mix in Atmos it's like nothing we've ever experienced. It's sexy."
