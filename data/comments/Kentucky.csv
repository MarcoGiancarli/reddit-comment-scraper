I guess when it's there your whole life and you don't visit for school, you tend to ignore it.

Sanders also demanded banks send free loans to illegals and other people that would never pay back then supported the Federal Reserve giving countless billions to these banks that also kept charging people for their mortgages.

I moved out-of-state a few years ago, so I've not been exposed to it much for some time...  I've been to Eastern Kentucky. I know people who work in coal. It's still hard to understand the loyalty these folks feel toward an industry which views them as replaceable parts."
Kentucky,3cshd9,Nygmus,6,Fri Jul 10 14:10:08 2015 UTC,"But there aren't any other jobs that pay a living wage in Eastern Kentucky for people with this skill set. And no other industries moving into the area any time soon. People need to feed their families now, not in a couple of months. And most are too proud and wary to ask for government assistance."
Kentucky,3cshd9,Nygmus,3,Fri Jul 10 14:44:52 2015 UTC,"That's true, too.  Eventually you start to get into catch-22 territory, though. Coal isn't really the friend people treat it as. I don't expect for a moment that if operations in the area were no longer financially viable, that the companies moving out would do much at all in the way of severance support for their employees. If the coal companies packed up and left, the people dependent on them would probably be SOL.  You could get into some real cause-and-effect stuff there, too, though. How much of the dependency is based on other industries simply never having been developed? How much of the lack of other industry has to do with the population simply never pursuing it (because they had coal around), and how much of it is due to the quiet influence of coal companies working to maintain their economic control over the region?  It's a rough issue. It just makes me a bit sad to see people I've known since I was a little kid still so dependent on an industry that, from my perspective, seems like the very worst kind of fair-weather friend."
Kentucky,3cshd9,ApolloThunder,2,Fri Jul 10 14:55:38 2015 UTC,"I agree with everything you said. This is a decades old problem that has had a myriad of solutions tried that haven't worked out very well - Tourism subsidies comes to mind. Better highway systems is another. Health care industries too.  Getting a reliable source of high speed internet into the region is a high priority. Industries can't operate in this day and age without reliable communication.  So does finding a way to keep our best and brightest to stay in the area. Which requires employment incentives that provide a living wage.  It really is a catch 22. Who knows, maybe now that Greg Stumbo did a complete 180 overnight about legalizing marijuana, maybe that is a viable option. At the very least, the hemp industry looks promising."
Kentucky,3cshd9,Nygmus,3,Fri Jul 10 15:09:24 2015 UTC,"Think about this: what other industry had come to the area and employed them?  I grew up in the mountains, went to college, got my Masters and couldn't get a job there, and I tried.  Is it manipulative?  Yeah.  But it's the only game that came to town.  Everyone else thinks they're too dumb to do anything else."
Kentucky,3cshd9,Jables162,3,Fri Jul 10 14:51:28 2015 UTC,"I couldn't even get a job in more western parts of the state. It's not just the mountains that had a poor job market, the recession seemed to hit hard right when I was graduating. I can't even imagine what it would have been like out that way.  I know it's the only large-scale game in town, the trouble is that it's not a game that's going to last all that much longer, and nobody has any plan for the future.  It seems like your experience is pretty common, too. It seems like there's a bit of a brain-drain going on out there for that reason, which might be contributing to the perception you mention of people in Eastern Kentucky being seen as ""dumb."" From what I can tell, a lot of the people able to seek higher education wind up not going back, and in the meantime the high school completion rate in Eastern Kentucky is low enough to make it a noticeable blip on any heat map of that statistic.  Suppose that's another scary thing about it, isn't it? The economic situation feeds into it, creating a bit of a self-perpetuating system. Smart people wind up having to drop out of high school because of the economic problems, people with the money or scholarships to go further frequently don't or can't come back, and it creates a perception of unintelligent people in the area that helps scare off investors that might be able to improve the underlying economic issue. It's a shame, because I know there are a lot of people out there smarter than they get credit for."
Kentucky,3cshd9,Mr_Bro_Jangles,2,Fri Jul 10 15:07:19 2015 UTC,"Well the recession didn't touch Lexington. We've always done better than the national average on jobs since the recession. So I dunno about far west Kentucky, but central Kentucky is doing well. Expanding and growing, more jobs are popping up, cost of living is the lowest in the country.  Point is: Lexington is the place to go with your degree.  However you are totally right about the pit that is Eastern Kentucky. It's a pit that not even the politicians and millionaires can escape. And it's because of itself that there is an issue. No industry will throw them a bone besides coal. And coal has to close their doors to people now. All the easily accessible coal has been mined, so they're automating it now. Safer, more efficient, and cheaper."
Kentucky,3cshd9,Nygmus,2,Fri Jul 10 21:33:03 2015 UTC,Your right. I agree with everything you said too. And we haven't even touched upon the other big hindrance to a successful economy in Eastern Kentucky - corruption and nepotism within the infrastructure.
Kentucky,3cshd9,Mr_Bro_Jangles,2,Fri Jul 10 22:42:10 2015 UTC,"Its simple.  Who else is bringing a large amount of great paying jobs to Eastern Kentucky?  No one.  The geography is expensive to operate in.  Major shipping routes don't service the area for that reason.  The available experienced work force is small and less educated than other regions.    So, why wouldn't you cling to the one industry who pays heads and shoulders above others. Additionally, local governments love the coal industry because of the great severance and energy taxes they use to pad their budgets."
Kentucky,3cshd9,realbabysealclubber,2,Fri Jul 10 18:26:43 2015 UTC,"I do understand why they cling to the coal industry, I just think it's kind of a shame because the industry doesn't seem especially likely to return that loyalty in any way if it becomes financially unviable to operate there."
Kentucky,3cshd9,_cheeze_,2,Fri Jul 10 18:28:49 2015 UTC,"I don't get what you mean by ""loyalty"".  The industry returns loyalty by paying an average worker 3 times what they are valued otherwise.  No mines or business can stay open and pay wages when their product is not being bought.  You do understand in the coal industry you have high school graduates making 70k+ in a place where there prospects might be hard labor for 1/3 the wage or a service job at close to minimum wage.  The fact is, mining and drilling of any sort comes in boom/bust cycles and given we are still talking about the same industry 100+ years after they arrived shows a decent track record.  I know no one that works or has worked in coal that expects mining to be a steady 40 year career."
Kentucky,3cshd9,ImJordanTheTurtle,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:39:38 2015 UTC,You nailed it.
Kentucky,3cp4ma,realbabysealclubber,23,Thu Jul 9 17:20:19 2015 UTC,"I really don't know what these clerks expect.  A refusal of the clerk is a refusal of an agent of the state. A refusal of the agent of the state that translates into the state's refusal more generally (if no one else can process these by law) and becomes the basis for a civil rights violation.  Do they think Beshear has some power to prevent SCOTUS's ruling from going into effect? From applying to the states in some way? What do they seriously expect him to do, blatantly violate the US Constitution in the same way Texas' AG seems to be right now?"
Kentucky,3cp4ma,Neurokeen,3,Thu Jul 9 18:33:18 2015 UTC,"I agree, completely. If you can't fulfill the requirements of your job, find another one where you can. Even though this ruling happened after the clerks got elected, your job is to fulfill your public duties to the nation. Even though gay marriage may not have been allowed when the clerks ran, they had to have known there was a chance that it would pass. It's like knowing that things are heating up in a foreign country and I join, then when we invade that country I claim to sympathize with them and can't fulfill my duties. How many soldiers that have been deployed disagree with why their over there but do it anyway? Might be a bad example, but you get the point."
Kentucky,3cp4ma,monk3yarms,-1,Thu Jul 9 20:49:07 2015 UTC,"But at the same time though, how can someone like Conway, who refused to argue the appeal in the state? Regardless of how you feel about the issue he technically refused to do his job representing the state.  (I agree 100% with what you said about the clerks/think its stupid what they're doing, but how does Conway get away with it)"
Kentucky,3cp4ma,Soccham,3,Fri Jul 10 14:54:47 2015 UTC,An AG has no responsibility to continue appeals indefinitely - they are always given discretion when to stop. Otherwise SCOTUS would be issuing thousands more cert denials each year.
Kentucky,3cp4ma,Neurokeen,-10,Fri Jul 10 15:00:11 2015 UTC,"Issuing marriage licenses to same sex couples is not the only way to obey the supreme court ruling.  Another option would be to stop issuing any marriage licenses.  I think they expect or at least hope that he will call a special session of the legislature to work out some sort of arrangement that obeys the court ruling while not forcing them to violate their consciences.  However, thats obviously a long shot, not least because forcing a few clerks to do something they don't like is certainly the easiest, and probably most popular, way to proceed."
Kentucky,3cp4ma,mlbontbs87,6,Fri Jul 10 02:57:46 2015 UTC,"Your other option doesn't work. If the ruling was only couched in language about just discrimination it might be,  but marriage is itself presented as a right in the opinion."
Kentucky,3cp4ma,Neurokeen,8,Fri Jul 10 03:09:54 2015 UTC,"Wrong.  Issuing marriage licenses is part of the statutory duties of Kentucky County Clerks.  If you cannot fulfill those duties, you're honor-bound to resign.  If these Clerks have such strong consciences, let them make a sacrifice for them.  Right now they're just using their so-called Christian beliefs for political theater."
Kentucky,3cp4ma,VernonDent,-1,Fri Jul 10 13:22:01 2015 UTC,"Hence calling for the special session of the legislature, to change the statutory requirements.  Give me flack all you want for trying to explain a viewpoint you don't agree with, but at least read my post."
Kentucky,3cp4ma,mlbontbs87,2,Fri Jul 10 14:09:28 2015 UTC,"OK then, I'll bite.    What is it that the legislature, in its infinite wisdom, is going to do to solve this situation?  What law are they going to pass?"
Kentucky,3cp4ma,VernonDent,-1,Fri Jul 10 14:27:18 2015 UTC,Issuing marriage licenses is part of the statutory duties of Kentucky County Clerks   That is a statutory duty of the KY county clerks because the legislature wrote the statute that way.  There is no reason the legislature cannot change the statute.
Kentucky,3cp4ma,mlbontbs87,2,Fri Jul 10 14:30:19 2015 UTC,To say what?  Who's going to issue marriage licenses if the county clerk won't?
Kentucky,3cp4ma,VernonDent,-2,Fri Jul 10 14:38:16 2015 UTC,"One option is to stop issuing any licenses.  Another option would be to have the courts do it.  Or the Secretary of State's office.  Or create a special marriage office to do it. There certainly are options.  Whether you think those options are necessary or feasible is debatable, but that is exactly why these clerks want a special session, to debate the options."
Kentucky,3cp4ma,mlbontbs87,5,Fri Jul 10 14:44:10 2015 UTC,"I'm asking you to debate the options.  I'm asking you what you think would work.  I'm asking you why you think we should spend hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars (if not millions) coming up with an expensive, unwieldy way to allow some butt-hurt political grandstanders to continue shitting on portion of the population that the law of the land requires them to treat like everybody else."
Kentucky,3cp4ma,VernonDent,-2,Fri Jul 10 14:50:55 2015 UTC,"That is not something I was ever intending to do on this forum, nor is it something I will do now.  I did say above:   However, thats obviously a long shot, not least because forcing a few clerks to do something they don't like is certainly the easiest, and probably most popular, way to proceed.   I was responding to this comment from /u/neurokeen:   Do they think Beshear has some power to prevent SCOTUS's ruling from going into effect?    by saying that forcing these county clerks to issue same sex marriage licenses is not the only way to obey the SCOTUS ruling."
Kentucky,3cp4ma,mlbontbs87,2,Fri Jul 10 14:58:02 2015 UTC,"One option is to stop issuing any licenses.    Not a credible option.  People want to get married in Kentucky.  Denying that right wouldn't solve anything and would create an incentive for thousands of lawsuits.   Another option would be to have the courts do it.   Or the Secretary of State's office.   Or create a special marriage office to do it.    None of these options solve anything when those positions are open to similarly bigoted individuals who would, by precedent of the clerks, have the right to request a special session and special laws to move the job to someone else."
Kentucky,3cp4ma,mescad,3,Fri Jul 10 16:21:51 2015 UTC,"I'm actually surprised he pressed the ""stop issuing any licenses"" again after my seemingly gentle correction. It's clear that anyone suggesting that's an option didn't read SCOTUS' majority opinion, or at the very least didn't understand the implications, so I'll explain in more detail here:  Going the substantive due process route in the ruling (which was alongside an equal protection route - but Kennedy used both, so the implications of both follow) pretty much rules that option out altogether. Using SDP basically sets marriage itself on a pedestal as a positive liberty that the state cannot take away from anyone."
Kentucky,3cp4ma,Neurokeen,15,Fri Jul 10 17:52:15 2015 UTC,These clerks are just embarrassing themselves.

By going ahead and challenging it, the issue was forced up the chain to the Supreme Court.

It is also the only place in the world that produces Corvettes, is home to a minor league baseball team, promote tourism through it's many parks, parades, and The Lost River Cave.  It has a yearly convention (Concave).  Downtown has historic buildings and venues such as the Capital Arts Center.  It's not a ""small town"" known for ""a few things"".  Sorry, I love my hometown."

I deal with DCBS often in my line of work. Many times, signed medical releases aren't filled out properly, request entire medical records when all they really want are drug screens, they fax a request for documentation and their cover sheets provide no call back number and no fax number.    I'm not sure if they just aren't being trained properly or what but they sometimes frustrate the hell out of me. They fax a request, 1 day later call ""Why haven't you faxed me the notes?"" Well, because 1) You didn't give me a fax number and 2) It's been one day. I have stuff to do too you know.    End of unrelated rant. For once, I think we agree on something galt.

Kentucky,3c3lz2,fuzio,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:31:24 2015 UTC,"It's always possible to find common ground.  :-)    You're absolutely correct in the overworked/understaffed observation.  Everything I've stated in this post is 100% verifiable, despite its ridiculousness.  The new hires that have been brought on haven't been trained on a LOT of things, namely the old system that is still in use due to Kynect not being set up for certain types of medical applications.  How to request a proper drug screen, I'm pretty confident, is at the bottom of the list.    The state can't even decide how to process certain types of medical cases.  It honestly depends what county you try to file one in, if they even have a worker that can help you and isn't assigned to be on the phone that day.  People in some counties have, true story, stated that if a client doesn't have insurance already, they don't get to file for coverage on the old system because they're required to have coverage now, by law.  Never mind that the old system is the only way to currently issue coverage to some clients and that the only option for some people is coverage through the exchange that they honestly can't afford.  I can't wait to see how the Anthem rate increase works out.    I'm glad people have coverage open to them through the expansion, I really am.  But, I shudder to think how Medicaid expansion is going in other states if Kentucky is the national crown jewel of the whole scheme.  It's one of the most mismanaged launches/software programming/allocation of human resources of anything I've ever seen."

Kentucky,3bu6yv,trueslicky,6,Thu Jul 2 04:38:38 2015 UTC,"Whitney Westerfield, the Republican nominee for attorney general, also blasted Conway in his reaction to the court's decision.  ""Unlike Attorney General Jack Conway, who failed in his responsibility to fight for the laws of this commonwealth, as Attorney General I will act to uphold the law even as it runs counter to my personal beliefs,"" Westerfield said in a news release.   Now that the Supreme Court has ruled that the law of the land is equality, it will be interesting to see if Whitney Westerfield was just blowing smoke or if he continues to ""uphold the law even as it runs counter to my personal beliefs"" and defends marriage equality.  The governor has made it pretty clear that Kentucky is not going to defy the ruling of the Supreme Court.  If the Republican candidates dig in their heels and try to make this a central campaign issue, they are going to lose very badly."
Kentucky,3bu6yv,mescad,8,Thu Jul 2 12:52:51 2015 UTC,"Really?  I'm worried this is going to rile up the same base that always votes in Mitch McConnell and elect another Republican governor after the disaster that Fletcher was.  There is no point in fighting gay marriage, yet Republicans STILL use abortion 35 or so years after that ruling as a talking point.    Thats not even getting to the fact that if Bevin wins, he wants to rip out Medicaid expansion and cost our state billions.  It'd be a horrific shitshow of epic proportions.  I want to believe Conway can't lose, but man I'm not really sure."
Kentucky,3bu6yv,RogueLeaderJ,3,Thu Jul 2 13:02:39 2015 UTC,"It's possible, but I doubt that four months from now that any states will still be fighting against this ruling in any serious way.  If Kentucky is the only one, the implications for Rand Paul's campaign are interesting to ponder.  Even Texas, who promised to defy the court ruling, is backing down from any serious action and is instead making accommodations for individual clerks who have a problem with it (source: http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/01/opinions/roosevelt-same-sex-marriage-enforcement/).  As they should, since there exists no legal standing to defy the Supreme Court's decision.  It's the law now."
Kentucky,3bu6yv,mescad,4,Thu Jul 2 13:16:17 2015 UTC,I don't see this being important campaign issue. If anyone remembers that Conway 'supported' gay-marriage and Bevin 'opposed' it'll be unlikely to change the way they'd have voted.

That first day I moved there was a wasp nest starting under the outside stairs. I called twice about it, but it was only after the third call three weeks later when I cussed them out on the machine when the nest finally disappeared. The guy who was supposed to come check my apartment when I moved in came three months afterward. There was no fire extinguisher, the carpet was not new, and the ""balcony"" was two feet deep, so usability was zilch. I learned not to call for anything because I got no responses.

I gathered this data for this using a modified version of a script made by the folks over at /r/MUWs. If you want to create your own word cloud for another subreddit, you can post requests there. I have also done several requests and as I have several sports and city related dictionaries I use to filter out particularly common words that are not normally detected. If you would like one made for any subs, just say the word and I'll crank it out. The actual word maps were made through Wordle. My apologies if these are difficult to see. I suffer from monochromatic colorblindness, so I had to use hex codes I found online when putting this together. Common words such as ""city"", “the”, “and”, “I'm”, as well as numbers were removed from the clouds.  I will be using this data to update my state/city/regional subreddit profanity analysis. I will also be running the numbers to see which of the subs have the most active discussion. My city and international clouds should be coming out in a week or so.  If you have any questions about specific frequencies of the words, the top words are under the third image in the album. I typically removed the largest words on the second and third images, as they were so large they typically made the other words harder to see. Only two states had words larger than their state name/abbreviation as the largest word, Wisconsin with ""Walker"" (our governor) and California with ""Water"".

And as for the Kentucky drawl, it differs considerably from Southern modes of speech."

Kentucky,3b8on1,FireHole,1 point,Sat Jun 27 13:28:49 2015 UTC,"Some of these things are hard to put a finger on and even harder to describe, but I'll try. I can really only speak in generalities, but of course, there are always plenty of exceptions.  Southern culture is laid back. There's a sense of timelessness about any gathering of people, whether it's a family reunion, a dinner party, or having company over to sit on the porch and converse. People tend to take off their shoes and make themselves at home and give the conversation their complete attention. Even goodbyes are done slowly, in stages. I never saw any of my parents' guests simply get up, shake hands, and leave. Someone would state the intention to leave. Another cup of ice tea would be had. Folks would stand and stretch and make for the door. Mentions would be made of the next get together. Everyone in the house would creep out the door. Conversation would continue on the porch. The gathering would stroll to the guests' vehicle, still chatting. The guests' would enter their car and start it up and roll down the windows. My dad would lean inside and shake hands with the gentleman as my mother talked with the lady about phoning to report a safe journey home. The car would back slowly out of the drive as goodbyes were shouted. The whole family would wave as the guests pulled slowly away and down the road.  Hospitality is another essential aspect of Southern culture. Many a time, especially in the mountains of Georgia, complete strangers have offered to share meals or a cup of coffee, to help with a broken down car, to have me up to the porch to sit a spell. When someone would come to the door, my parents would have them in the house and offer them iced tea or supper if it was time before they ever bothered to ask what the stranger wanted.   There's a sense of belonging to a place in the South, of a long history with the land and the people, of being in the midst of the winding stream of history.  I haven't experienced any of these in Kentucky to any significant degree. Granted, this culture is drying up in the South to some extent, especially, it seems, among Millenials and younger."
Kentucky,3b8on1,thatbigscarydude,2,Sat Jun 27 14:29:53 2015 UTC,"Indeed it is; I remember people in Eastern Ky would reserve Sundays after church to go ""visitin"" where they'd go to family members' and friends' homes and bring food, like a big pot luck. When the time would some to leave, they'd all say ""Come go with us"", which wasn't a real invitation, it was kind of a sentiment.  One of our odd deviations from southern culture that I've noticed is our cornbread--we like it yellow, usually and people more southerly tend to have the white cornbread, at least from what I've seen. I dig both :-)  Thanks a lot for your impressions and thoughts thatbigscarydude. I appreciate it."

Some would look at the prevailing culture to make the determination. Kentucky has strong northern and southern influences. The fact is that the topic can be argued back and forth."

In fact, many folks in rural, Southern Indiana and Ohio would not claim to be from the ""North"" either, though by virtue of being a Hoosier or Buckeye, any claim to being a Southerner is a bit of a stretch.    With all that said, Kentuckians freely admit to not being in the Deep South either, as some have already commented on. Another good question is do Kentuckians say they are from Midwest? Conversely to the above, most, not all, would say no, but a larger portion of Louisville and N.Ky I think would answer yes to being a Midwesterner."

Kentucky,3b8on1,Lizzichka,2,Sat Jun 27 05:56:14 2015 UTC,"Being a border state, so to speak, makes it tough to categorize the whole state. The culture and manner of speech is very different from one region of the state to the next.  People from north of KY are quick to categorize the whole state as southern mainly because most of the state speaks with an accent and is rural."
Kentucky,3b8on1,shutter-cane,2,Sat Jun 27 12:50:12 2015 UTC,"We have a mix of southern attitudes about family groups--clannishness and an insular family structure that can be seen in other parts of the south. This is similar to other groups in the US who may have traveled here from other countries, but is different from main-stream American culture where you're supposed to move away from where you grew up and start a whole new life.  That said, the state of Kentucky only began having southern leanings after the Civil War ended. This is probably due to the fact that the wealthy people here who owned slaves knew that KY would be invaded if it seceded, and they would lose their ""property"". So, the wealthy slave holders here were pro-Union, convinced that Lincoln would never deprive them of their property. So a declaration of neutrality was made by the Kentucky state government to try to preserve the status quo here, but it was basically ignored, first by the Union, then the Confederacy.  So, when Braxton Bragg came through Ky trying to recruit soldiers he was disgusted with the apathy for the secessionist cause, and said so. Although tens of thousands of Kentuckians fought for the Confederacy, more fought for the Union, and Union sympathy was especially strong in the Eastern portion of the state, where the coal was. Later conflicts like the Hatfield/McCoy feud were partially founded in a Union/Confederate paradigm.  After the war ended, all people who were owned by other people were freed, and this bankrupted many  of these former slavers, and they were pissed. This began our drift southward. So, as with many things about Kentucky, there's a paradox. Lexington was the slave-market of the upper south, and many people living in the central Bluegrass owned slaves or were sympathetic to the secessionists, but the rest of the state was more oriented northward, since these other regions were populated by newly arrived German and Irish immigrants, whose loyalty was undeniably to the Union. General Breckinridge, former senator and 14th Vice President of the United States was commissioned brigadier general of the First Kentucky Brigade called the ""Orphan Brigade) in the Confederate army since they soon were expelled from the state by Union advances. One of their Generals, a Benjamin Hardin Helm, was President Lincoln's brother in law. The First Kentucky Brigade  returned with Braxton Bragg in the summer of 1862 to try to raise recruits, but even these Kentucky Confederates couldn't inspire many of their fellow Kentuckians to join their cause. Less than 5000 men joined. So, Kentucky had Confederate troops, had a secessionist government in Bowling Green, and had many wealthy slaveowners, but the state's proximity to the Ohio River and it's vast reserves of coal, tobacco and hemp made it a vital resource for the Union--President Lincoln said if they lost Kentucky  they would have lost the war. So, we only really began to have southern sympathies after the Civil War was over, and that wasn't even true for the whole state, especially the eastern portion.  Culturally, I am not sure enough to make a claim there--I haven't visited very many southern states. I know there are some similarities and southern states do not have the same culture--Florida, Georgia, Texas, and Missouri all are very different, in terms of character, culture, customs, dialect and cuisine. Someone more knowledgeable than I am would have to weigh in on that,  but I have hopefully sketched out a picture of the historical background some.   I personally think we're more southern than northern, but northern influences are part of our culture as well, and as deep as the southern ones."

Kentucky,3b8on1,JJJ3232,4,Sat Jun 27 21:37:51 2015 UTC,"Ok. I have family in Ohio and Kentucky. I grew up in southern west virginia, and lived in South Carolina for 5 years, and I've now been living in kentucky for 2 years. My SO is from Maryland so I've spent a good amount of time there, too. So I have great experience with southern, Atlantic, Appalachian, and Ohio valley side of the Midwest. I feel like I can make a valid description of kentucky.  It's south of the mason Dixon line, but (for the most part) is north of the mountain range that I generally use to describe as Appalachia, the division line between  northern  and southern culture/values/practices in their purest form.  I consider Appalachia to be more ""country"" or ""secluded yet based in a very ""do it yourself,"" artisan and farmer mentality, rather than a southern or northern type feel. It's decidedly different if you have lived in more culturally concentrated areas (less touristy).  The Ohio valley is hot, flat, and full of corn and other cash crops. It is decidedly different than Appalachia (less hilly forests) yet populated with farms and little hidden creeks and cliffs.  In Appalachia, the hospitality is based on tradition and respect for the people around you regardless of class, or money. It's common decency to take care of your fellow man. You do it because you expect the same to you, and you do it because it feels good to respect everyone regardless of their luck of the draw.  In the south, the hospitality is ingrained as deeply as breath. If you don't follow the decorum, there's something inherently wrong with the way you were raised. It is expected, and basic social interactions are held at a proper level of personal disclosure (you usually take a few times hanging out before you can easily just talk about more crass items or touchy topics)  To me, I'd describe the majority of Kentucky as an Ohio valley/eastern side of Midwestern state with a strong Appalachian flavor. You get the long, wide plains of cash crops and horses lining the rural towns, but there is a strong sense of identity and pride in the local heritage which you find in Appalachia. However, I feel like there is an ingrained strong sense of privacy when first meeting people that I have only found in the Midwest. Also, the role of social decorum is strongly based on a sort of hybrid southern and Appalachian style- there is an expected sense of decorum for those you know and identify with. Someone you don't connect with socially or geographically won't feel the same warmth. Maybe it's a way of communicating, maybe it's rooted in that strong sense of identity and pride with a dose of love for privacy.  Would I call kentucky a southern state? No. But it's not northern and not Midwestern. As a longest time resident of West Virginia, I have always struggled with a regional identity. It's time we start recognizing the mid Atlantic. Appalachian, and Ohio valley states as a decidedly different cultural region between north and south. We have an incredibly different sense of being that falls somewhere between the two."

I would definitely say as a whole we are more of a southern state than like Florida. Ocala and north there is definitely the south and especially around the panhandle and probably some of the small towns below that but the rest of florida and especially in the cities you can see the influence of the migration of a lot of people from the north east moving down there either to retire, climate, or for a winter home.

The likelihood of the winner being able to afford the taxes is slim, not to mention that when they give away half a million dollar houses, most people entering can't even afford the property taxes were they to be able to afford to take possession.  From the T&C:   • With respect to any prize whose value is more than $5,000, the Internal Revenue Service requires St. Jude to withhold federal income tax at the rate of 28%, and the winner must pay the amount of tax to be withheld to St. Jude as a condition of transfer of ownership of the prize. The winner of a vehicle in the St. Jude Dream Home Giveaway is responsible for payment of applicable taxes, titling, and licensing fees.   You need to be able to pay St. Jude $128,000 in order to take possession of the house.   Edit: the house is in Tuscany, which is in the 6th district.  At $450,000 assessed value, the annual property taxes would be around $4,600 (although the PVA will probably asses it lower, but the most recent data available is from when it was a vacant lot.)

There are inexpensive, cool thrift shops all over town, if you want to shop or just look at weird, funky, cool old stuff.  There's always outdoorsy stuff to do, like going to any of the area parks to run, walk, hike, ride a bike, whatever. There's the giant Phil Moore park on Scottsville Road a couple of miles past the interstate/Natcher Parkway. You could also drive out to Barren River Lake to swim or fish. Mammoth Cave isn't too far away, if you want to visit the grounds, go hiking, take a tour.  Have you visited the Half Price Books Outlet next to the mall? That's a good way to chill out, read some books, get some $1 cookbooks. They also run a Magic tournament every second and fourth Tuesday of the month, if that's your cup of tea. You could check out Great Escape Comics by Kroger or Mellow Matt's at Smallhouse/Scottsville Rd. if you are in the market for comics, vinyl records, action figures, DVDs.

If the purpose is to portray important historical figures from Kentucky, then Davis should be there. If the purpose is to honor people whose ideals represent the best of Kentucky, then Davis shouldn't be there.   In this country, we don't typically erect a statue in such a central location unless we're honoring someone, so it's likely that the true purpose was to honor him.

Kentucky,3b0jqb,halgorithmic,3,Fri Jun 26 17:37:57 2015 UTC,"Not that I disagree with the sentiment of not honoring Davis but context is needed if we are going to judge these men (and women) more than 150 years after the fact.  This quote is take from a speech that Lincoln made in 1858 in Illinois:   I am not, nor ever have been, in favor of bringing about in any way the social and political equality of the white and black races, that I am not, nor ever have been, in favor of making voters or jurors of negroes, nor of qualifying them to hold office, nor to intermarry with white people; and I will say in addition to this that there is a physical difference between the white and black races which I believe will forever forbid the two races living together on terms of social and political equality ... I will add to this that I have never seen, to my knowledge, a man, woman, or child who was in favor of producing a perfect equality, social and political, between negroes and white men.   Lincoln also went so far as to propose an amendment to the Constitution as late as December 1862 that would allow for gradual emancipation over a 37 year period. This amendment would also have compensated slave owners, not slaves, for loss of property. Additionally the amendment would have called for the expulsion of African descended slaves from the United States."
Kentucky,3b0jqb,ComradeGnull,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:27:22 2015 UTC,"Sure, Lincoln certainly didn't have modern views on race and equality. He was also a politician and interested in what could be accomplished without creating a violent rift in the Union, which would have meant advocating racial inequality even if you advocated abolition. White people in the 1800's were so afraid of miscegenation and integration that these positions were used as strawmen by pro-slavery politicians to weaken support for emancipation and abolition among people who were anti-slavery but still racist. I don't know what Lincoln's private beliefs were, but he would have had no choice but to distance himself from racial equality if he were going to succeed in the non-violent elimination of the evil of slavery.  Jeff Davis went to war to keep Americans in chains. Lincoln was trying right up to the eleventh hour to accomplish a noble but impossible goal- eliminating slavery while keeping the South in the Union through a negotiated recognition of the property rights of slave owners. The other side doesn't have to be a moral paragon to recognize that one side advocated a position that involved preserving the treatment of human beings as property."

Lincoln is in the center of the room while Davis, Henry Clay, and Alben Barkley are against the wall. Henry Clay owned many slaves. I think it's amazing that both Lincoln and Davis were born in Kentucky and it reflects the position Kentucky was in during the most transformative stage in our country's history. I suppose this has come up because the battle flag of the army of northern Virginia still flies in the South Carolina state capitol and on the Mississippi state flag.

As this issue moves forward, I fear that people will be arguing past each other without asking this important question. Instead the sides will raise noise on two points that no one doubts: 1) that Jefferson Davis is historically important and 2) that Jefferson Davis held beliefs on slavery that we now see as shameful."

If it is an appeal, I would think they would've given you at least two weeks notice to gather witnesses and send in material supporting your claim.  Call Frankfort asap to find out information."
Kentucky,3ag1sz,speedballfordonkey,2,Fri Jun 19 22:10:52 2015 UTC,The appeal hearing and this eligibility review are 2 separate things.

I know a lot of people who visit expecting Kentucky stereotypes but Louisville is a pretty decent sized city with a culture unique from the rest of the Commonwealth. Louisville's a pretty nice mixture of urban midwest and rural south. So you get most of the charm of Kentucky (hospitality, nature, bourbon, etc) with most of the charm of a large city (shopping, entertainment, multicultural, etc). Hell, the University of Louisville campus has a small park named Freedom Park dedicated to the elimination of slavery adjacent to a small monument dedicated to the fallen Confederate soldiers!

And there are multiple tours that are easy enough for kids and breathtaking views for adults. I forget if it's the ""historic tour"" or another one, but look on the National Parks website for the ""snowball room"" - a massive space in the cave where you can have lunch and then descend down a spiral staircase to see all the glorious formations.   Also, while you're in Cave City there are some pretty fun tourist attractions! In particular ""Alpine Slide"" where you can take a chairlift to the top of the mountain and either zip line down or go down a massive concrete slide on little wheeled carts. So fun! Also horseback riding, go karts, etc.   I am pretty sure they are opening it next week, but a new attraction is ""Funtown Mountain"" - a guy from Louisville bought an old attraction and is revamping it as a family spot. Wild Wild West style!   Don't forget to pick up some bourbon and some Ale 8. ;) oh! And also, stop in to the Watermill Restaurant for some fried catfish and hushpuppies.   ENJOY!"

It's a college town an hour south of Lexington that used to (and may still) give its students an education for free provided that they worked at/for the University.  Also, it's a very picturesque place once you get to the downtown.  There's also Raven Run, which is just south of Lexington along the Kentucky River.  It's very beautiful.  Follow the path to the overlook and pack a lunch.  Great hike for just a couple hours.  Note that I personally would hit up Red River Gorge or Natural Bridge State Park (which is a bit more out of the way).  Both are stunningly beautiful."

Kentucky,39aeta,I_am_Gorthos,2,Thu Jun 11 01:20:41 2015 UTC,Kentucky is a surprisingly beautiful state.  My top recommendation would be to go to Red River Gorge.  It is beautiful.  I'm a lifelong KY resident and had never been there until I was 20 or 21 and couldn't believe that a place so naturally beautiful existed here that I had never been to.  It's a big canyon with the Red River running through it that has many good hiking trails that offer lots of pretty views.  There are the natural arches that exist and all the vertical cliffs that make it a top rock climbing destination as well.  If you want to see museums and a city go to Louisville.  It's a really cool place with lots to see and do.  There's also Mammoth Cave which is the largest cave system in the world located a little north of Bowling Green in south central KY.  Also there are all the bourbon distilleries you can check out.
Kentucky,39aeta,HexHoodoo,2,Wed Jun 17 01:34:24 2015 UTC,"Another vote for Mammoth, but if the kids are into engineering, Kentucky Dam is not very far and it's pretty cool.  They have a museum underneath which is way loud if the have the locks open.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Dam"

The dam is the lowermost of nine dams on the river owned and operated by the Tennessee Valley Authority, which built the dam in the late 1930s and early 1940s to improve navigation on the lower part of the river and reduce flooding on the lower Ohio and Mississippi rivers. It was a major project initiated during the New Deal of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's administration, to invest in infrastructure to benefit the country.

Kentucky,38qd48,brogalion,1 point,Fri Jun 5 22:56:12 2015 UTC,"Comparing anywhere in KY to NYC is pretty tough.  Ft. Wright is one of the more affluent NKY/Cincy suburbs.  There are maybe a dozen good non-chain restaurants in the Ft. Mitchell/Ft. Wright area.  Lots of bus stops, though I don't take the bus so I can't speak to ease of use.  To my knowledge there are no sketchy areas in Ft. Wright.  Certain areas in West Covington should probably be avoided.  The cost of living anywhere in KY will pale in comparison to NYC and really most metro areas.  The population in Ft. Wright is mostly white-bread business/professional types.  Very friendly people though, as you might expect in KY.  Covington and Newport have the college and bar scene in NKY.  Nature stuff is always a plus in KY. Devou Park is pretty decent and close to Ft. Mitchell.  Over in Boone Co. you've got Gunpowder Creek Nature Preserve and Big Bone Lick Park, both good for hiking and the like.  You may want to pose this question to r/cincinnati.    Hope this helps.  Good luck to you!"

I also forgot to mention that you will be about 15 miles from the CVG Airport, which as of late, has had some pretty competitive commuter flights to Chicago...not sure about NYC."
Kentucky,38qd48,courtnbur,1 point,Sat Jun 6 00:25:46 2015 UTC,"The closest Coscto and Microcenter are about 25 miles away in Sharonville OH north of Cincy. Best Buy and Sam's Club are in Florence south of Ft. Wright/Ft. Mitchell. The Kroger in Ft. Mitchell should serve you well but there are lots of suburban areas with all kinds of chaing.  Biking/walking to work is theoretically possible but you might find people are not used to seeing bike commuters and will be rude to you. It's just not something people do here and they will expect you to bike on the sidewalk. It's a suburban area and everyone is expected to drive to work. There are miles of sidewalk that no one uses.   After living in Chicago, I personally wanted to live in a more urban area where I can bike/walk to places so I chose to live in Covington even though I work way out in Florence. I have to drive to work (bus doesn't even go there) but outside of work I can walk and bike places in Cincinnati for fun."

You might have some trouble walking to get groceries from Arlington Rd. You would be within biking distance of the big Kroger in Ft. Mitchell but again it's hilly. There is a produce and deli market on Dixie near Arlington but I have not shopped there."
Kentucky,38qd48,brandonthegrey,1 point,Tue Jun 9 13:38:13 2015 UTC,"That is a pretty long haul for a weekend visit. I have made the drive from Louisville area to New York a few times and it takes ~15+ hours by the time you figure in food/fuel stops. Might be do-able on a long weekend, but not something I would want to do much. You're looking at minimum 10 hours from Cinci area.    I don't know the specific area you are talking about too well, but I have enjoyed the time I have spent in Cinci and Newport area. There is a lot to do there. The Newport aquarium and Cincinnati Zoo are a couple things I have enjoyed in the past.   KY is a great place for outdoors activities. Lots of fishing, hunting, hiking, kayak/canoeing opportunities. Look up Mammouth Cave national park, Red River Gorge, Smokey Mountains National Park, and Land Between the Lakes.  The public transit, or lack there-of will probably be a big adjustment compared to NYC. Like I said, I don't know that area great, but most of KY is so spread out that you need a car to get much done. Commuting on bike is a pretty good option in most cities though.   I hope this is helpful"
Kentucky,38qd48,longtim_lurker,1 point,Fri Jun 5 23:31:12 2015 UTC,"Hey, I grew up in Fort Wright and am moving back in the next few months.    It's very different from NYC. Fort Wright is a solidly upper-middle class town and feels very suburban in many ways. The town itself has very little to do in terms of entertainment or nightlife; it's almost entirely residential. That said, you're only a few minutes drive from Covington and Downtown Cincinnati that each have fairly bustling social scenes.  Get a car if you can. Fort Wright is very spread out along Dixie Highway and Kyle's Lane and getting from place to place on public transit is doable but extremely time consuming.  NYC for a weekend is perfectly doable; CVG (around a ten minute drive) has daily flights though they're expensive. However, you're looking at a quite a drive. I just checked google maps; from my parents house to Manhattan is approximately a 10 hour, 8 minute drive with no traffic. I'm currently in New Orleans, about an 11-12 hour drive from home, and it's usually not worth it except on long weekends/holidays.  Lots of great restaurants (chain and otherwise) in and around Fort Wright. Crescent Springs and Crestview Hills are a short drive away and offer a wide selection of both fast food, casual dining, and local places. The Kroger in Fort Mitchell is one of the best ones I've ever been to. Many of the Kroger family actually live in Fort Mitchell and the store serves as something of a testbed for other stores. It includes a full-service butcher shop, sushi bar, cheesemonger, bakery, fishmonger, and more. It's one of the main things I miss from home! Fort wright is extremely nice. Apartments can vary widely. My sister lives in Park Hills (just a few blocks form my parents) and a nice one bedroom is only around $400 a month, but I would expect to pay more than this. The worst crime are occassional break-ins and burglaries, as it's a short drive from the city. Lock your doors when you leave and at night, and don't leave anything valuable sitting out in a car. Otherwise it's hard to find someplace in the metro Cincy area that's safer! As I said above, nightlife and whatnot is sparse in town itself. However, if you like nature Fort Wright has its own nature preserve, and there are numerous areas with great hiking trails quite close by. The population is a mix of elderly retired and young or middle aged professionals. Again, it's a very suburban town for the most part.    My biggest piece of advice is that you get a car. Biking along the main roads can be very risky and the area is extremely hilly with many steep or curved roads. To get to entertainment and most shopping you'll almost certainly need a car.   Let me know when you move if you need help with anything. I'm hoping to be moving back to the area within a few weeks assuming my current job hunt works out. Just shoot me a PM, if you have a specific area picked out or have any specific questions let me know!"

Kentucky,38l0uc,snowlove,6,Fri Jun 5 01:13:00 2015 UTC,"Three deaths tied to suspensions Jun. 03, 2015 @ 12:47 PM CURTIS JOHNSON   HUNTINGTON - The Social Security Administration has until 5 p.m. Thursday to respond to attorneys who seek an injunction to block the immediate suspension of disability benefits to more than 900 people, according to a court order entered Wednesday.  It stems from an Inspector General's investigation that revealed evidence of fraud involving four doctors used by The Conn Law Firm in Stanville, Kentucky.  That triggered a review of benefit eligibility for approximately 1,500 recipients, including the immediate suspension of benefits for more than 900 people.  The proposed injunction, sought by attorney Ned Pillersdorf, of Prestonsburg, Kentucky, would reinstate benefits for everyone until a hearing can be held.  U.S. District Judge Amul R. Thapar scheduled a telephonic hearing on the injunction for 3 p.m. Friday.  Pillersdorf's motion, filed late Tuesday, linked as many as three suicides to the suspension notices. He first learned of an Ivel, Ky., man's death, whose widow he cited in saying the client shot himself Monday.  Pillersdorf urged any overwhelmed clients to contact a medical professional or suicide hotline.  ""I've been worried about this from day one,"" he said Tuesday. ""Just the client contact, the panicked voicemails, text messages, emails, the parade of people in my office - we've been worried about this.""  Such concern follows the Social Security Administration's move to suspend disability benefits for more than 900 people during a review of approximately 1,500 cases, all linked to Kentucky attorney Eric C. Conn and former Social Security administrative judge David B. Daugherty of Huntington.  Congressional investigators allege Conn relied upon those medical experts for false or fraudulent testimony, while Daugherty assigned those cases to himself and awarded benefits to hundreds without justification.  Social Security's initial review found none of the estimated 1,500 people qualified for disability benefits based upon evidence not associated with the four doctors.  That triggered a redetermination of benefits for the 1,500 recipients, more than 900 of whom received immediate suspensions pending the final outcome of their review.  Pillersdorf didn't dispute the government's need to re-evaluate the cases, but said last week he fears that process will take up to a year and half. That prompted his federal, class-action lawsuit in hopes of reinstating benefits until a hearing can be held.  U.S. Rep. Evan Jenkins, R-W.Va., and U.S. Rep. Hal Rogers, R-Ky., called upon Social Security to give each person more time to provide medical records to support their original claim, according to letters sent to Social Security's Acting Commissioner Carolyn Colvin.  The agency initially gave each recipient 10 days to provide additional evidence, which would be forwarded to appellate operations and onto an administrative law judge if the case is assigned for a hearing.  ""While we remain concerned about the alleged fraud and abuse of (Social Security Disability Insurance) benefits, we believe consideration should be provided to those individuals that are rightfully receiving benefits,"" the congressmen wrote. ""Ten days may not be enough time.""  Pillersdorf's federal action represents one of two, class-action lawsuits filed on behalf of the more than 900 with immediate suspensions. The other targets Conn accusing the attorney of negligence and fraud.  Pillersdorf's class won a temporary restraining order Tuesday in the state case. It blocks Conn from transferring assets and destroying evidence related to the case. A final order could be granted following a hearing set for Thursday.  Similar lawsuits targeting Conn are filed in West Virginia.  Conn's attorney, Kent Wicker of Louisville, Kentucky, has called lawsuits targeting his client misdirected in pointing to the government as cutting benefits. He also maintains Conn's innocence saying years of investigation have yielded no criminal charges.  Daugherty also has maintained he committed no wrongdoing. He retired amid paid suspension and later voluntarily agreed to have his state law license annulled last summer.  If you are having thoughts of suicide, call Prestera Center for Mental Health Services at 800-642-3434 or the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 800-273-8255.

If you're going to camp make sure you are at least 300ft from trails or roads and 100ft from cliff overhangs and grab a permit before you go.

I am an entrepreneur, technologist, and now an Independent candidate running for governor of Kentucky.    My general platform is this: The governor is the last line of defense against bad ideas. He or she should judge each bill based on what is truly best for the citizens, not based on party politics and the demands of special interests. The only way to accomplish that is to elect an independent candidate.    My stances are based on my born-and-bred love for Kentucky, my business sense, and my careful research into what the data says. What has worked in other states? What could work here? What are the roadblocks we need to overcome in order to make things happen? And above all, can we pay for it?  So if you’re truly tired of the same old politics, year after year, why not try something different? Those other two guys will run again in 2019 – vote for them next time around.    How can you help?  If you’re in Kentucky, the most important thing you can do is go to http://drewcurtis.com/petition and help collect signatures. We have to collect 5,000 signatures before August 11 in order to get on the ballot, and we need a lot of help. Print off a sheet, talk to all your friends and family, and explain to them the importance of having a third legitimate option on the ballot this fall.  Additionally, we are up against millions of dollars from not only candidates but special interests, Super PACs, and more. If we can raise even $250,000, we can have a shot at winning this election. But we have a long way to go, so go to http://drewcurtis.com/donate and give what you can.   Everyone complains about being forced to vote for the lesser of two evils? Now is your chance to change that."
Kentucky,37scv1,millenialmalfunction,2,Tue Jun 2 16:01:37 2015 UTC,"Hi Drew,  I live in the Lexington area. I am very liberal, and in my ideology, probably relate most closely to you. The problem I struggle with is voting for an independent candidate. As you probably know, independents don't tend to win major elections. The issue is is that I would love to vote for you, but that leaves probably several liberals who would normally vote for Democrats taking votes away from Conway, giving Bevin a greater chance of winning, which kind of makes me want to die (like we saw with Alison and Mitch--the votes going to Patterson probably would have helped Alison).  Generally, how do you feel about the common dismissal of independent candidates? I think it is a shame that parties matter so much."
Kentucky,37scv1,sowders22,6,Tue Jun 2 16:42:42 2015 UTC,"Hey, Drew's campaign manager here. So the conversation we often have is about how our campaign actually has the broadest appeal of all the candidates. In fact, most legitimate independent candidates can appeal to both conservatives and liberals as we have been. The Republican and Democratic candidates are Ralph Nader to us, not the other way around.   Political parties have been successful at convincing people votes for independents are wasted by misinforming them on turnout in elections. Turnout is so much lower than people realize that all it takes is to get the disenfranchised and discouraged excited about someone who is cutting through the crap that political parties constantly put out there. In a three-horse race, you only need 33.4%. Legit independents are entirely viable, we just have to get voters to believe enough to get them to sign petitions, donate money, and actually work for a candidate they believe in. If everyone who ever damned the political parties actually volunteered and voted for the legit independents they believed in and didn't listen to the lies about their viability, no major party candidate would ever win again."

Kentucky,37scv1,KiltedCajun,1 point,Tue Jun 2 17:19:08 2015 UTC,"Andrew, let's get real here. The average third party candidate gets a single digit vote percentage in local and state level elections. Even though 40% of voters identify as ""independent"" (making them the majority of voters), it's because they feel disenfranchised by their ideological party, and they will continue to vote along party lines even though they call themselves independent.   Let's look at Gatewood Galbraith. He wanted to get elected so bad, and he knew that he couldn't win his party's nod, so he switched from Democrat to Reform, then back to Democrat, then to Independent. Anything he could do to get his name on the ticket. Back in 1995 in his first attempt, he only got 0.4% of the vote so it didn't really matter, but that election was decided Patton 50.88% to Forgy 48.71%. Had Gatewood stolen just 1% more of the vote from Patton, the election could have swung to Forgy.   I love Drew to death, but to sit here and tell people that it's the political parties that are convincing people that votes for independents are wasted by misinforming them is simply bullshit. Yes, in a three-horse race you only need 33.4%, but that's a long shot from 15.3%, which is the largest percentage a 3rd party candidate in a Kentucky gubernatorial candidate has received in recent times."
Kentucky,37scv1,bigkat,2,Tue Jun 2 19:41:53 2015 UTC,because of attitudes that push the duopoly of power here in the commonwealth... you bring up gatewood... He didn't want to get elected so bad!!! It was us Kentuckians that wanted a third option that wanted it so bad... He was just the right fellow to get up and do it... but if your going to down a long shot then I guess you can take the safe bet of the status quo...  bK.
Kentucky,37scv1,bigkat,4,Tue Jun 2 21:34:11 2015 UTC,(like we saw with Alison and Mitch--the votes going to Patterson probably would have helped Alison).   But the people who voted for Patterson made a choice to vote for Patterson... Mathematically speaking under your theory they could have gone 50/50 for both Alison and Mitch... :)    bK.  You're not wasting a vote voting for an Independent or a third party if you believe in what they are doing!!!  votesmartKY

There has been a ""blue ribbon"" list of recommendations from an Abramson commission which, while unfocused, has also been completely ignored. Do you have a major tax plan, or are you juts looking at one off tax tweaks?"
Kentucky,37scv1,DrewAtFark,2,Tue Jun 2 18:20:24 2015 UTC,"Since that has to originate in the legislature, I'm going to have to evaluate proposals as they arrive in bill form.  My main concerns are that whatever reforms they suggest maintain tax revenues at levels sufficient to cover expenses.  That the reforms not overly burden the lower/middle class.  They should bring data to back up their suggested changes as well."

I should have asked a more specific question, though.    Would you ever sign a so-called assault weapons ban into law in Kentucky? Would you ever sign magazine capacity restrictions into law in Kentucky?   Thank you. I'm undecided and, as I've looked into the candidates, I've found that some of your positions aren't all that clear (which makes sense, since you're running as an independent and not attached to any party platform).   Anyway, I think it's amazing that a platform exists where I can communicate directly with a gubernatorial candidate. Reddit is awesome. Good luck!"
Kentucky,37scv1,DrewAtFark,2,Mon Jun 15 16:37:10 2015 UTC,"I'd have to have a good understanding of how effective the laws would be.  To my knowledge they don't make a huge impact - however I'd be willing to take a deep dive into them.    Practically speaking I don't think there's any chance of the legislature passing anything restricting firearms in any way.  As for my own opinion on guns, I don't own any.  I do have Tasers, mainly because I have three small kids and if one of them accidentally shoots themselves with a taser it's something we can all laugh about later.  However I believe people should be able to own guns, mainly because police response times in Kentucky's rural areas can be too long - which is unavoidable, and not a problem with police coverage.  Hope that helps!"

The Appalachian region of our State is an area most associated with abject poverty, a lack of access to healthcare, a lack of access to education, and few employment opportunities. Natural gas is diminishing investments in coal as revenues drop and the jobs are going with it.    Do you have a vision for improving the lives of Kentuckians facing these challenges? What can the State do to improve access to healthcare and education in these parts of the state?  How could the State draw in clean energy industries to fill the void left by coal magnates abandoning the region?"
Kentucky,37scv1,DrewAtFark,7,Tue Jun 2 16:16:09 2015 UTC,"vision for improving lives/education etc: the mayors of Lexington and Louisville have developed an interesting program that spans 22 counties.  They joined with industry and local community colleges to increase training for skills that industry was specifically seeking.  I think we should take a look at expanding this statewide.  The number one need of industries looking to move to or expand in KY is a well-trained workforce There are a few practical problems with clean energy in EKY.  Mainly that the cost of clean energy is several magnitudes higher than the cost of energy from coal.  Additionally, eastern KY is not well suited to either solar or wind power production.  I think we should focus on other industry sectors instead, such as training people to code and taking a hard look at Adventure Tourism"

If the legislature passed a copy of what Colorado passed along with a few extra tweaks (such as backing out prior felony possession and usage convictions - they forgot to do that), I'd sign it.    However as an Independent Governor there's not much I can do to affect the filing of bills on specific issues.

I have four questions:   What are your views on science funding - especially climate and fundamental research in general. Do you have a clear vision for a more sustainable Kentucky? In other words, with an inevitable move away from coal, do you have any ideas for the role of renewables in Kentucky? Internet speeds where my parents live in the commonwealth are considerably slower than the average internet speed in Kenya. Do you have a plan to improve internet access in Kentucky? Kentucky's education standards are, unfortunately, near the bottom of the list, especially in essential STEM subjects. What will you do to improve this?"
Kentucky,37scv1,DrewAtFark,4,Tue Jun 2 16:31:36 2015 UTC,1) I'm pro-science funding.  Climate change is real 2) answered downline somewhere 3) Yes - and it turns out my first company was a dial-up ISP.  I understand the technology at a deeply granular level.  There's currently a $300m initiative to bring broadband to Eastern Kentucky - I'd like to review this program to see how it can be optimized 4) I plan to start with seeing what can be done to alleviate government restrictions on teachers.  I will not cut education funding.

Kentucky,37scv1,DrewAtFark,5,Tue Jun 2 16:34:18 2015 UTC,One of the things I really want to do is galvanize Kentucky's diaspora.

Current projects are underway in widening the Mountain Parkway all the way to Prestonsburg. Today, Greg Stumbo proposed that the Parkway should extend into West Virginia, meeting up with the interstate in Beckley, WV. Is this something you're in favor of?  Also, what areas of the budget do you believe spending needs to be reduced?"
Kentucky,37scv1,DrewAtFark,2,Tue Jun 2 16:41:45 2015 UTC,"Mt Parkway - infrastructure matters a lot for economic growth so in general I'm in favor of it.  However is that the best place for the Parkway to meet up with the Interstate?  I haven't seen the proposed path.  If it is, great.  If not let me know.  Budget - one of the biggest unnecessary expenditures is fees the pension system pays to hedge fund managers.  We're talking potentially hundreds of millions of dollars.  No hedge funds - switch all stocks to ETFs.  After that, I've taking a quick pass through the budget and have seen a number of line items I have questions about -  small amounts of money given to small organizations.  I'd check into these to make sure everything was up to snuff.  I plan to take a weekend and compile a master list of them.    Another way to save money in a budget is to use Open Budgeting systems like the one Socrata uses - apparently if you assemble a budget online in plain site that prevents a ton of corruption from cropping up (http://www.socrata.com/products/financial-transparency-suite/)"

Kentucky,37scv1,realbabysealclubber,0,Tue Jun 2 17:09:27 2015 UTC,My thoughts before I look on it were it could be a great chance to utilize previously mined and reclaimed lands that are much less steep than naturally occurring hills in Eastern Kentucky. I'm a big fan of that and is something I have been seeing a lot of in my work here in Eastern and Southeastern Kentucky.  And that's honestly something I wish more people were on board with advocating. There are a lot of areas that could be developed due to the previous surface mining activities.
Kentucky,37scv1,imapirate502,5,Tue Jun 2 17:17:03 2015 UTC,"One more question, Drew. How do you feel about casino gambling, either limited to existing race tracks or opening up the possibility for casinos on land. Indiana, West Virginia and Missouri all allow some form of casino gambling and I feel like all that money could be spent here. That POS David Williams squashes the idea every time it comes up because he says it will attract the types we don't want here, but then he blows a ton of money gambling in other states."
Kentucky,37scv1,DrewAtFark,2,Tue Jun 2 17:16:51 2015 UTC,"I'd pass it - provided the state doesn't just give away licenses.  Those are worth real money.    I have no objection to it on practical considerations either - it's not like we don't have out-of-state casino gambling within a short drive of any part of Kentucky.  Plus, some people might be surprised to know there's already some forms of in-state legal gambling at race tracks ;)"
Kentucky,37scv1,kamnet,2,Tue Jun 2 17:21:48 2015 UTC,Here is the big hang-up that I have with casino bills in Kentucky. Almost always a substantial part of the casino's license fees and profits must be handed over to Kentucky race tracks as they will most certainly lose some money if people choose casinos over tracks. Are you in favor of helping to continue to support one of Kentucky's most iconic and influential industries in this manner? Is this an appropriate use of the state's potential casino revenue?
Kentucky,37scv1,DrewAtFark,3,Tue Jun 2 20:22:22 2015 UTC,I really don't like corporate welfare - just handing checks over to racetracks doesn't seem like the way to go.  Also I don't think it's necessarily a zero-sum game.  I'm not sure why people would stop going to Keeneland or Churchhill Downs just because there are slot machines nearby.  They said VCRs would kill off cinema but box office receipts went up instead.  I'd need to see more data either way

Kentucky,37scv1,DrewAtFark,3,Tue Jun 2 17:23:19 2015 UTC,"Fixing the pension funding problem is the number one issue facing Kentucky.  Most people don't realize it's an economic apocalypse.  That's no exaggeration - when I first dove into the problem I very nearly quit the Governor's race.  It's that dire.    However I'm very good at tackling unsolvable problems.  I also understand Financial Statement Analysis extremely well.  I've come up with three solutions, all of which work.    I'll be providing spreadsheets with adjustable inputs so anyone who wants to can tweak the numbers.  It uses RVKs May 2015 Asset/Liability study KERS projections and takes anywhere between 15-30 years to reach 100% funding depending on which solution is implemented  So stay tuned"
Kentucky,37scv1,diversified-dingo,4,Tue Jun 2 17:33:14 2015 UTC,Two questions:  You have been talking recently about corruption being a major issue you would take on.  Growing up in the district of Hal Rogers I have heard many people defend his use of pork barrel politics because of eastern kentucky's dire need for economic stimulus.  How do you combat corruption and at the same time ease voters concerns of losing badly needed funds to impoverished areas?  On your website your say that you don't have a solid stance on right to work.  Why is this?  Are you not convinced that this will erode union membership or is it the unions themselves you are unsure about?
Kentucky,37scv1,DrewAtFark,4,Tue Jun 2 17:36:28 2015 UTC,"Corruption - it is the case that pork is an economic stimulus, the problem is that it goes to individuals and corporations that don't necessarily have a need for it.  I intend to try to redirect pork funds to greater needs in the same area when possible.  Ideally to areas that have a greater impact - ie anything we might get $2 of value for every $1 spent gets a hard look.    Right To Work is being held up as a solution to bring jobs to Kentucky and lower unemployment but the data doesn't bear that out in any study I've seen.  At best it's inconclusive.  And bear in mind I have a personal bias against unions.    The greater issue with Right to Work as I see it is it's an inelegant solution to the problem it's supposed to solve.  If we made a list of all the things that might increase jobs and employment in Kentucky and ranked it from a easiest-to-implement+most-effective ranking, I'm willing to bet passing Right to Work wouldn't be in the top 100.     Ending All Unions to increase employment is as effective as killing a mosquito with a hand grenade.  I have a strong bias against ham-fisted solutions that don't take into account unintended consequences, and Right To Work is certainly one of these.    Corporations are far more concerned about having a well-trained workforce.  Also - Kentucky's unemployment is already lower than both Tennessee and Indiana.  Both are Right To Work states.  Unions don't appear to be the issue here."

Much of the data created and managed by public entities in Kentucky (including the one I work for) are in data silos or behind pay walls. Would you be willing to adopt or push for a statewide open data policy  for public entities (PVA, GIS & planning offices, clerks, etc)? Perhaps a policy guided by Tim Berners Lee's 5 Stars of Open Data?  To this end, this Saturday, June 6th, OpenLexington will be hosting a National Day of Civic Hacking event at MakeTime (446 E High St #110, Lexington).

That said, OpenLexington, the main group organizing the event in Lexington, has regular 7PM meetups on Tuesdays at CirrusMio in downtown Lexington. I ran it by some of the core members and they are definitely open if you ever want to pop by during a Tuesday meetup to chat about the value of open access for public data and records. I'd be happy to work with your team through more formal channels to set this up if this is something of interest.  Even if a meeting with OpenLexington wouldn't fit in your schedule, I'd encourage you to look at what is possible when the LFUCG opened up some of the public's data (see Lexington's open GIS data portal) and how the citizens were able to turn it into a community good (see What's My District? app). Then contrast that with Lousiville's Civic Data Alliance and their efforts to gain access to public data held by the Jefferson County PVA."

Kentucky,37scv1,kamnet,3,Tue Jun 2 19:33:53 2015 UTC,"(Since nobody else is chiming in yet, I'll keep on asking! ;) )  On taxation: all of Kentucky's Republican gubernatorial candidates shared the same opinion, Kentucky taxes are too high, especially on corporations, and needed to be cut. Looking over Kentucky's tax revenues for 2013 I saw that in a state of just over 4 million people Kentucky collected only $3.85 million in personal income tax, and collected less than $700,000 in corporate income tax.  As both a citizen and a company officer in Kentucky, do you feel that taxes are too high, too low, or just where they should be?"
Kentucky,37scv1,DrewAtFark,2,Tue Jun 2 20:51:54 2015 UTC,"Doublechecked those numbers - add 000 to the ends of those figures http://ballotpedia.org/State_government_tax_collections_by_source   According to those numbers we're just below median per capital tax collection, also below Indiana and Ohio and above Tennessee  Anyhow here's a complicated answer - I swear it's not intentionally vague  I'm all for the lowest taxes possible - however we do need roads, education, police, and so on.  We can't just cut everything x% and expect things to work exactly as before.  I recall at least one of the candidates calling for across the board 20% expenditure cuts.  That simply won't work - there isn't 20% to cut from education for example.    Politicians always present funding state revenues as a two outcome solution - either cut expenses or raise taxes.  There's a third option however: increase the productivity of existing resources.    There are also more elegant ways to reign in expenses, for example concentrating on a lower -rate- of growth of expenditures is a much less disruptive method of controlling costs than arbitrary budget cuts  I've been tossing around the idea of Minimum Viable Government - modified from the Minimum Viable Product concept in the Lean Startup Model.  I'm going to try to optimize around effectiveness and impact.    I'm also collecting ideas for other solutions so if you know of any please share!"

Would you give a short, one sentence summary of your stance on the following current biggest concerns and platforms in Kentucky?  Marriage equality  Marijuana and hemp reform   Coal and Eastern KY   Education  Healthcare  Michelle Malkin"
Kentucky,37scv1,DrewAtFark,5,Tue Jun 2 16:08:11 2015 UTC,"Marriage equality - in favor.  This'll pass at the Federal level 7-2 btw so it's sorta moot  Marijuana - see my other answer there  Coal - This is actually super complicated and I've got a huge technical discussion forthcoming on this.  I am not pro corporate welfare.  However if I had to sum up the problem it's this: coal wants to mine with no regulations at all.  Foes of coal want no mining.  No one's willing to budge one iota on this.  There are far more elegant solutions than just those two things  Education - Legislators think they understand education because they went to school.  This results in incredibly blunt legislation that needlessly burdens teachers with reporting requirements and other overhead.  Teachers know better than us what they need - we should ask them rather than tell them.  And cutting education funding is a complete nonstarter for me.    Healthcare - I am not going to dismantle KyNect.  It solved the problem it was meant to solve (uninsured individuals).  Plus, it's not costless to force the healthcare industry to migrate to a completely new system twice in three years.  However, the conservatives do have a point - if things go a certain way by 2017 Kentucky will -not- have the funds to be able to sustain KyNect.  Given that a viable alternative doesn't currently exist, my plan is to watch what other states do for possible solutions.  If as some predict KyNect is unsustainable 3-5 years for now, we should design for a transition to another system.  Just canceling the program, as Bevin has proposed, shows reckless disregard for peoples lives.    Michelle Malkin - her Twitter fans seem to have a basic misunderstanding of the point of Fark."

Kentucky,37scv1,kamnet,3,Tue Jun 2 23:35:14 2015 UTC,"To be clear - I'm not saying no state should be first to try anything.  I'm extending my personal business philosophy to government.  For some background on that: I've run Fark for almost 17 years.  It's self-funded, which means when I evaluate new projects I have to weight risk much higher than you would normally for a corporation - because if our resources ever hit $0 we're out of business instantly.  To work around that limitation, I have a practice of waiting whenever new technology or design standards enter the marketplace.  Sometimes this works out, sometimes it doesn't, but the good news is that when it doesn't work out it's not significantly harmful.  Some examples:   A few years ago, everyone was so convinced that a Pinterest-style design was the wave of the future that Microsoft redesigned Windows OS around the concept.  Which we now know was a huge mistake.   A few years ago, everyone was so convinced that tablet computing would completely replace PCs that Gannett redesigned every media website to be tablet friendly.  Then sales fell through the floor   If Fark had jumped on every new technology trend the moment it came out we'd have gone bankrupt years ago.  My philosophy is to wait and let new market developments play themselves out for a year or two, and if they start gaining traction then to jump in with both feet.  I think Kentucky government could work this way as well.  Other states are experimenting with all kinds of new ideas.  Let's save money time and resources and let them, then move quickly when we see proven solutions."
Kentucky,37scv1,DrewAtFark,2,Wed Jun 3 18:14:25 2015 UTC,"Recently all the GOP candidates were asked on how they would comply with the upcoming EPA regulations requiring states to implement their own targets for reducing air pollution, and specifically reducing emissions from coal-fired power plants. The GOP answer is that not only would they not comply with ""Obama's EPA"", but they would spend state money to fight it, and spend more state money to bring back jobs for coal miners.   The issue on the table right now is that states must either create their own air quality plan that meets EPA approval by mid-2016, or the EPA will develop a plan without state input. Do you believe your administration could do this, would you prefer the EPA to take the lead and develop a plan, or would you fight against the EPA in court to block their plans completely?"
Kentucky,37scv1,kamnet,2,Wed Jun 3 19:16:11 2015 UTC,"I punted out to my network on this one and folks on different sides of the issue said basically ""it's complex"".  Can I have more time to sort this one out?  And what's your opinion on it?"
Kentucky,37scv1,DrewAtFark,1 point,Wed Jun 3 21:13:39 2015 UTC,"It's your campaign, not mine!  ;-)   My opinion: we've neglected the health care and needs of Kentucky residents in favor of coal mining for far too long. We know coal pollutes, we know that it's dirty, we know cleaning it up won't be cheap. Kentucky has some of the cheapest electric utility rates in the nation (#3 when I last looked). We can't keep crying about how costs will go up for corporations when the pollution from coal-fired power plants puts the health and well-being of Kentucky's citizens at risk. It may cost the power producers some money to implement, but we know they won't go bankrupt, and their investors could certainly afford to take a small haircut in exchange for improving the lives of our people. I would like to see the state develop a plan to reduce pollution, in addition to continuing to improve the health and welfare of the people, in addition to improving job prospects for the declining coal mining industry. I don't see why it has to be all-or-nothing proposal and why the state can't work towards improving all of it simultaneously."

Kentucky,37scv1,DrewAtFark,1 point,Tue Jun 2 19:38:03 2015 UTC,"Hi Drew, longtime farker here and Louisville resident. How do you feel about addressing congestion and transportation infrastructure in Jefferson Co? Spefically, I'm in favor of building a light rail system, comparable to Atlanta's MARTA. Studies have been done as recently as the early 2000s, and the conclusion was basically ""you need it but you can't pay for it.""  A north-south/east-west rail system would cost roughly $2billion to construct. I have no earthly idea how to pay for such a thing, so I'm wondering 1. your thoughts on the need for such a thing and 2. if you're in favor, how would we pay for it? I feel like it would not only ease congestion and commute times, but provide low-cost, easy to use transportation for low-income people to better-paying jobs like in Riverport or Hurstbourne area."
Kentucky,37scv1,imapirate502,3,Tue Jun 2 16:25:23 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately there isn't $2b in the state budget available for an infrastructure project like this.  Most of those funds have been allocated to building two bridges across the Ohio river.    Meanwhile, I think driverless cars are going to fix this - mainly because they'd reduce the number of cars on the road and clear traffic jams faster because they can all start moving forward simultaneously.  Here's a piece I wrote about it that we haven't published yet where I asked Google's head project lead how to make things easier for driverless cars.  I was at SOAR this past May.  Most of the conversation centered around the Eastern KY broadband initiative and providing ways to train people to code.  From 1996-2002 I ran an Internet Service Provider in central Kentucky - I have highly technical experience and understanding of how broadband networks are constructed and operated.  I’m also a coder with a degree in Computer Science.  This is a great conversation to have.  However having an understanding of technology is just part of the solution.  Knowing what questions to ask of technology businesses is also important.  I was asked the other day at a talk at the University of Kentucky if I could clarify exactly how I would push my pro-technology agenda forward as Governor.  I responded that a large part of my agenda would be contacting large companies and just ask them “what works best for you?”  Sounds simple right?  No one does this for some reason.    So along those lines, let me present my proposal for attracting Google’s Driverless Car program to our state.    Rather than just guess how we might go about doing that, I emailed Google’s Driverless Car project head Chris Urmson and asked him what he’d ideally like to see.  Here’s what he said:   Review current regulations to ensure readiness. Existing laws and vehicle codes should allow for the fact that a driver may not always be physically present in a vehicle. In those cases, the rules of the road should still apply. For example, a state’s Vehicle Code may refer to responsibilities of drivers when hailed by a police vehicle. A full review of regulations and how they apply in a world of autonomous technology or remote operation would be in order. Make information about roadworks real-time and openly available. Our cars have a good map of areas they’ve previously navigated. But when roadworks or other construction springs up, and where traffic is rerouted, it can be difficult for the vehicle to navigate the situation. If cities could keep their information about roadworks up to date and available to the public to see, autonomous vehicles would be more equipped to cope with that new situation. When new laws are needed, ensure flexibility for tomorrow’s technology. The market for self-driving cars has not yet developed. Innovators will develop a wide range of autonomous vehicles. While the private sector develops the technology and business model and evaluates consumer demand, it’s important that laws don’t “tip the scale” towards any particular technology or model. Establish transparent, objective, and outcome-based safety standards. Clear safety standards help build public trust in the technology, and also give businesses the regulatory certainty they need to make the necessary investments. Rather than regulating specific technology or component parts, regulators should establish transparent, objective standards that measure how a vehicle performs in real-world conditions using data collected through the operation of the vehicles. Create swift processes to help develop and deploy self-driving vehicles. Every day that this technology is not deployed is measured ultimately in lives that c​ould h​ave been saved. Licensing and registration requirements should not create unnecessary delays or add huge disproportionate costs to manufacturers’ programs. Regulatory processes should be streamlined with set timeframes for decision making.   PS I’m not proposing allowing corporations to write our laws - that’s a terrible idea.  I am however proposing we ask corporations directly what they think works, and then decide if it works best for the State of Kentucky."
Kentucky,37scv1,DrewAtFark,3,Tue Jun 2 16:32:13 2015 UTC,"Great answer and thanks. I didn't expect the money for rail to be there. God knows this city can't do anything to save itself. It took 20 years to get the bridges built and about as long for a stadium. My preference is a train, but I'm ultimately a fan of whatever works.  Since you brought up broadband, how do you feel about getting a fiber network set up? Or at the very least, bringing in some competition for Time Warner for an ISP? TWC is the only ISP offering over 6mbs in my area, and since I'm a cord cutter and stream everything, they sorta have me screwed if I want to use someone else. I've also read about Chattanooga where they have super-fast wifi everywhere and everyone pays a few dollars in taxes to pay for it."

Areas where Google Fiber has been deployed or is deploying all have municipally owned pole infrastructure. It allows them to cut a deal with a single entity (city gov) to cut red tape and make the work happen fast. Kentucky cities have been passed over, just like the whole Northeast US, because private entities control pole infrastructure (regulated by state agencies) and it's just a mess. Trying to make things happen like running new fiber have crazy bonding requirements, negotiations with multiple parties and added costs on things like overweighted poles. How can we open up rights of way access for new fiber deployment for companies willing to invest?  And fiber aside, what about busting up these monopolistic exclusive franchise rights for cable companies that exist now? AFAIK those rights for cable infrastructure were only meant to be exclusive to recoup initial investment back in the 80s. What about some competition in cable internet providers similar to DSL CLECs? (before they were neutered by the PSC and AT&T lobbyists)  Getting Kentucky up to Estonia levels of bandwidth would be a huge economic boon and really improve Kentuckians lives in a noticeable way. You could really lead on this issue I think."

Kentucky,37scv1,DrewAtFark,1 point,Tue Jun 2 19:01:15 2015 UTC,"A question on education:  During the GOP debates all of the candidates expressed their opposition to Common Core Standards, declaring that Kentucky education should not be dictated from Washington and that they would block Common Core from being implemented by the Kentucky Dept. of Education next year in favor of letting local school districts decide what works best. However, many local school districts have already chosen to implement Common Core on their own. This creates an obvious conflict if Matt Bevin wins - will he support local school districts that have implemented Common Core, or will he have Common Core blocked and stand opposed to those school districts?   Do you have an opinion on Common Core Standards? Are you comfortable with letting local school districts select their own education plans rather than a state-directed plan, even if it implements Common Core?"
Kentucky,37scv1,DrewAtFark,3,Wed Jun 3 17:46:33 2015 UTC,I'd support local school districts and if they want to keep common core they can have it.  I know far less about what makes education effective than teachers do - I'm going to rely on their input primarily.
Kentucky,37scv1,kamnet,3,Wed Jun 3 18:04:42 2015 UTC,"Btw I should also mention that early on while contemplating running for Governor -everyone- advised me that I should be against common core ""because no one likes it"".  Which doesn't seem like a great reason to have a stance on anything.  But I think it explains the GOP candidates position on it quite well - when asked what specifically they disliked about common core none of them could name anything in particular.  Be interested to hear what Conway thinks about it.    Here's specifically what I think about it - what little I know about it resembles teaching methods and shortcuts that we used when I was on Lafayette's Academic Team.  Which are great and do work.  So I think perhaps the main problem here is either implementation, execution, or the fact that people just fear change in general.    So if teachers say they want it, and some do, then I say let's see how this plays out in a year or two and take another look at what teachers say then."

This gets talked about a lot but little is being done to make it happen.   With the roads in Eastern Kentucky, and the difficulty for trucks to transport in and out of the area, you need an option that involves little to no import and export. That leaves out manufacturing for being a viable option. You also need an option that is a cheap startup which leaves out solar and wind energies (in addition to studies showing output with these technologies would be relatively low). Considering all this, tech really is the best way forward. We have seen time and time again the game-changer the internet can be once a region comes online en masse."

Rather, I call myself an agnostic.  Atheists and agnostics constantly dance around semantics and try to define and redefine each other haha.... From the perspective of most self-declared agnostics, atheists are just as belief-filled as religious folks as most seem to actively disbelieve in god(s).  As the atheist about this issue and the terms will simply be redefined a bit to say they ""lack belief.""  Actions speak louder than words, IMHO. Atheism is intriguing and most atheists are pretty bright, but their absolute faith in empiricism, reason, and logic as a means to discern Truth bugs me a little....well....alot.  As an agnostic, I'm pretty comfy with simply saying ""Frack, I dunno"" to most questions.   I dunno...I just get the vibe that this conference is not much more than a group of folks who believe there's no god, take great pride in it, believe themselves to be intellectually superior to ""the ignorant masses""....all while sitting around stroking each other's egos.

Of course no state worker will have something to do 100% of the time.  But below a certain percentage, the job is unnecessary and wasteful.  You do make a valid point concerning oversight from the General Assembly.  Laws and policies need to be in place to foster effective and efficient government service.  But there is also the issue of state worker culture and ethics, which I believe Frankfort could improve upon.  I was a federal employee for 13 years and quit, mainly because I was ashamed at the waste and the complete apathy of those who made much more than I did but who did less work.  We need quite a few in Frankfort to do the same thing, but I ain't holding my breath.  It's glorified welfare for a lot of them."

I've discovered that for the most part people expect everyone else to mind your own business and you won't get harassed.  Sure, we have our share of outspoken bigots but they are a small minority of the population.  The fact you can't connect with others is that you require them to be ""like-minded"", it's that kind of elitist attitude that keeps you separated.  Try getting to know some people, even if they are a redneck or have spiritual beliefs.  Rednecks are seldom racist and few religious people will try to shove their bible down your throat.  My circle of friends include people who share my ideas and beliefs but many do not, those that don't share my interest and ideas open my mind to new ones.  It doesn't mean I have to conform to their way of life, nor do they have to conform to mine."

Kentucky,37bu34,idkmybffyossarian,3,Tue May 26 16:31:17 2015 UTC,How is living in Finland compared to Kentucky? I've been considering trying to get a job over seas after college and Scandinavia is one of the areas I've thought about looking at.
Kentucky,37bu34,mickopious,5,Tue May 26 22:23:06 2015 UTC,"It's certainly colder (although not unbearable as people might lead you to believe). Everywhere is safe, public transportation is pretty amazing and everyone pretty much leaves you alone.  Finns are really shy and sometimes it might take awhile to make a Finnish friend. Until then, there are tons of Americans here to keep you company. There's even a Facebook group for the Americans living in Finland which can answer any question you have once you get here (where to get a haircut, best place to find a certain American food you miss, etc).  Other than the cold and the shy Finns, it's pretty nice here. Living is maybe a little more expensive, but on the other side, university and medical care are practically free. (Went to the doctor twice, have not seen a bill, and my university ""tuition"" was a 92 euro entry fee for the whole year.)  Getting a job can be easy if you're in the right fields. I even got a job at an English speaking kindergarten that pays better than any job I had in college back in Lexington, and all I have is a degree in German. I mentioned the Facebook group earlier- they sometimes post info about open jobs for English speakers, so they really come in handy.  Naturally Sweden, Norway and Denmark are other Scandinavian options for you, although you should know that Norway is ridiculously expensive. If you're on a budget, I wouldn't move there anytime soon.   Finally, I have to say that there are things you'll miss from Ky, or even the US. Stores open all of the time and a wide variety of food are missed here. Also, random food products you didn't know you would miss (For me-Nilla Wafers and Campbell's Chicken Noodle Soup), but you will be able to find Finnish (healthier) alternatives.  Anyway, PM me if you make it here! There's also another Lexingtonian living here so that's pretty cool to know someone from home.  Good luck! And let me know if you have any other questions!"

I grew up outside Bowling Green, moved to another state for college and then another state for a decade, then moved back to the BG area a few years back. It's easier to find weirdos near the college towns, but even in my current town of about 5,000 people, I have come across many interesting people through a job where I often interact with the public. Even people who don't share some of the same values that I do, I can enjoy their company in some aspects. My dad still gives me shit about voting for Obama, but in a good-natured kind of way. We get along.  We're not all in Louisville and Lexington, and the people who think those are the only worthwhile places in the state ought to get out more."

Yeah, it's possible that defense counsel will come up with some wacky theory that catches the State off guard, but in the majority of cases there are a finite number of affirmative defenses and the avenues of attacking the state's case are fairly predictable.

Dog Slaughter Falls in particular is one of my favorite places in the commonwealth. Bark Camp Creek is another cool place. And just to the southwest is the Big South Fork which has some pretty cool areas as well. All of these can be accessed in some way from the Sheltowee Trace.

If you're up for a longer hike, you can tack on Double Arch, and if you can find it--Star Gap Arch and Jailhouse Rock.  All of which are off of the Auxier Ridge loop."

Kentucky,35fsx4,buttmud-brooks,7,Fri May 29 01:42:50 2015 UTC,"Roadside America's listing of offbeat attractions in Kentucky.    Personally, I love the Maker's Mark tour and despise the Heaven Hill tour.  The Jim Beam tour is also fantastic.    The Patton Museum at Fort Knox used to be very interesting if you're into military history, but when the Armor School moved to Ft. Benning, Georgia they took all the good stuff.  The Gold Depository is a sort of drive-by tourist attraction, but don't go to see it unless you're passing by.  It's sort of 'meh' and the guards get pissed if you stop.  The Louisville Slugger Museum is pretty neat as is Churchill Downs and the Kentucky Derby Museum.  You can also go to the Kentucky Horse Park in Lexington.  Louisville Mega Caverns also has an underground bike park if you're into mountain biking.  If you're into museums, go to the Frasier History Museum in Louisville.  You can visit Colonel Sanders' grave in Cave Hill Cemetary in Lousiville or order some of his chicken at Harland Sanders Cafe and Museum in Corbin, KY.  I have gone there and while it's cool if you happen to be in the area, it's not worth a drive (my opinion).  Hope you enjoy your visit.  I've lived in many places in my life, but the people here are about the friendliest there are."

Kentucky,35fsx4,WharfBlarg,5,Sun May 10 03:14:22 2015 UTC,I tell this to everyone visiting in that area. Go to Mammoth Cave and then kayak down the Green River. One of the best times I've had outdoors.  Red River Gorge/Natural Bridge is great too. Eat at Miguel's Pizza on your way to the park.
Kentucky,35fsx4,armfly,6,Sat May 9 23:35:18 2015 UTC,"Awesome!!! We budgeted 2 hours for the ""Historic Tour"" at Mammoth Cave. That and the Corvette factory justified an entire vacation day in the Bowling Green area. I can't wait...  We are actually doing whitewater rafting in Tennessee on the way to KY, otherwise I'd probably take your other suggestion as well. Maybe next time...  Thanks for your suggestions!"
Kentucky,35fsx4,brilliance2spare,2,Sun May 10 00:07:18 2015 UTC,"If you're only going to do one cave tour, you might want to opt for something other than the historic tour. The historic tour is cool because you learn all the history of the caves, but it doesn't have the ""oooooohhh"" factor of some of the other tours."
Kentucky,35fsx4,brilliance2spare,1 point,Sun May 10 00:17:46 2015 UTC,Interesting. Which tour has the most Bang for the Buck (time-wise; we will only be there 1 day)???
Kentucky,35fsx4,TheRealDrWan,3,Sun May 10 00:26:18 2015 UTC,"If you're only going to take one tour at Mammoth Cave, you have to decide what type of underground scenery you want to see.   Some sections of the Historic Tour have incredibly large and impressive passageways, but that part of the cave is mostly dry, so you won't see any stalactites or other cave formations. But it does have lots of old wooden artifacts from the War of 1812 and cool looking candle smoke signatures from cave visitors in the 1800's. It's a two mile, two hour long tour with over 400 stairs and lots of variety, including Tall Man's Misery, a 20 foot long passage that's only 5 feet wide and 3 foot 6 inches high! (Which you see right after squeezing through the somewhat larger, but narrow passage called Fat Man's Misery!) There's also the spectacular Mammoth Dome, which is almost 200 feet high and has a 60 foot tall stair tower that you have to climb up near the end of the tour.   The Domes and Dripstones tour is also a two hour long tour, but it only covers 3/4 of a mile of passageways (with 500 stairs) in a different section of the same cave. You take a bus out to a man made entrance and go down lots of steep, steel stairs through several amazing wet and drippy domes and pits, some of which stretch 80 to 100 feet vertically above or below the staircase you're descending! Once at the bottom, you hike up and down through moderately large, but dry tunnels until you get to near the end of the tour, where you see the Frozen Niagara section. The highlight is a 50 foot high, massive flowstone formation that you get to go underneath and a series of three small, but really pretty rooms full of stalactites, stalagmites, and more flowstone formations.   I would suggest that you take both tours if you want a more complete experience, but you will want to get reservations for your tour(s) if you're coming to the park this time of the year. They do sell out. (And make sure you schedule at least a 15 minute break between tours if you're taking two.)   There are several other longer tours that go to different parts of the cave, but those usually sell out days or weeks in advance.   Here's the current tour schedule for Mammoth. Have fun!"
Kentucky,35fsx4,oricthedamned,3,Sun May 10 02:20:07 2015 UTC,"Louisville native and current resident here. Though I've not been myself (fear of open heights), many friends have raved about the underground zip line we have now. It may be up your alley:   http://www.louisvillemegacavern.com/  I'll second Mammoth Cave. That's both pretty dang cool and a holdover from the mid-20th century pre-Interstate travel culture.

Kentucky,35fsx4,powen01,3,Sun May 10 02:30:45 2015 UTC,"Louisville resident here... used to live in Lexington and grew up in NorKY.   In Louisville, Fourth Street Live is pretty tourist trappy. Avoid it if you can. Don't do the casino in southern Indiana. It's terrible. Do try to hit up Bardstown Road inside 264 for a taste of local Louisville food and brews. This area is called the Highlands. Cumberland Brewery is a local microbrewery that has great beer cheese. Dittos is a safe local American restaurant. You pretty much can't go wrong with anything in the Highlands. Lots of people talk about NuLu but there's not enough to really attract a tourist to the area. A couple of the restaurants are nice but for the most part, it is not all that well developed.  In Lexington, there is great food in and around the intersections of Limestone and Main. Just about any of the places around there are good local eats. The Kentucky Ale brewery does a great quick tour in downtown that is pretty good if for nothing more than the free drinks at the end. Several microbreweries in the area means you can have a great time hanging out and getting your drank on (forgive me plz). There's an outdoor weekly event called Thursday Night Live in downtown that features public drinking and live music. If the weather is nice, it's a great event to attend. No public intox or open container laws on that city block during that time.   The University of Kentucky has a beautiful campus this time of year if you want to kill an hour or two just looking at interesting scenery and architecture. School is out, so no crowds either. You must hit up Pazzo's on pint night (Tuesday if I remember correctly) for some good pizza and a fine eclectic brew. Two Keys is a little rowdy for my tastes but you might try it out if you want to mingle with the local college crowd (which will be significantly reduced because of summer). County Club is a good local eatery to hang out in as well.  About 45 mins from Lexington is Red River Gorge and Natural Bridge. Natural Bridge was a family favorite growing up and features great beginner level hiking and awesome scenery with tons of photo ops. Hit that up for sure. I would be careful going anywhere east of there. Not a lot to see beyond those locations.  I will second (or third) Mammoth Cave in the Central Part of the state. There are great trails outside and tours inside. It's a must-see if you're visiting the state. Also near there is the Corvette Museum. It's a cool place to check out if cars pique your interest.  Of course you have to hit the distilleries if you have a chance. They get busy and some of the tours book up so be sure to call in advance. Woodford Reserve is beautiful if you're looking for a nice site to see and Buffalo Trace has something called the ""Hard Hat Tour"" if you want to dive in a little more.   Don't forget Cumberland Falls in the southern part of the state. It's a good scenic stop if you're heading south but I don't think I would make a trip just to go there.   If you're up north on a Saturday night, you absolutely have to check out dirt track racing at Florence Speedway. It's a hoot watching cars with 800+ hp try to get traction on a banked 3/8 mile oval track. Admission isn't too awful and you'll really feel like a bonafide redneck. But seriously, the people are great and it's fantastic fun watching the cars bump off each other as they fight for position.   Hope you enjoy your trip and I hope I've helped you out just a little bit.  Edit: How did I forget Keeneland and Churchill Downs? Keeneland is the cleaner and more proper of the two but Churchill has the lure of the history and tradition of the Derby and Twin Spires. Neither is a bad choice if they are in session when you come to town."

For bourbon, it's not my favorite, but Maker's Mark is probably the most notable bourbon, not sure if that's what you are going for. Willett is a good bourbon around $40 so that may be too much, but it comes in a bourbon still shaped bottle so it's kind of a souvenir when empty too. If you want to spend less, maybe get like 4 or 5 airplane bottles. Makers Mark, Blanton's, Bookers, etc. $2-8 or so each depending on the brand and that way they can try a few."

Kentucky,3481kf,DumDumDog,5,Thu Apr 30 12:23:51 2015 UTC,"Matters not what the shirts say   See, that's where your views and theirs diverge.   Christians are called to follow a narrow path. They cannot endorse or show any tacit approval for what their faith and scripture deem as immoral behavior. That ethos transcends money and popularity and law. They cannot, in good faith, make money off of something which contradicts their deeply held beliefs. It is not fair to force people into such an uncomfortable position.  Would you ask a devout Jewish or Muslim deli owner to make you a ham sandwich? Would you ask a black dry cleaner to launder Klan robes?

Congratulations, your now a small business owner. Things go good for a few weeks.  One day a lunatic from Middle-earth Baptist Church comes in and wants you to megaphone message ""God hates hobbits"" for 3 hours.  You say something along the lines of ""get the fuck out of here, your an idiot"".  Then a local committee decides to force you to go around with your megaphone (the one you saved up to buy) in your mouth yelling ""God hates hobbits"".  Your moms a hobbit, your dads a hobbit, even your baby sister is a hobbit, so it really hurts your feelings to have to say this.

The government should not have the power to make a person promote an idea they disagree with, regardless of whether or not I agree with the idea that they are trying to force them to promote. Christians trying to force gay people not to get married is no worse than gay people trying to force Christians to promote gay rights. Gay people should be able to get married and have equal rights in every way under the law. And Christians should be free to disagree with that, and promote an anti LGBT philosophy as long as they keep it in the church and out of city hall.

Kentucky,33q7uh,bobbydishes,4,Fri Apr 24 23:36:38 2015 UTC,Considering its derby festival time and keeneland is over id just stay in the louisville.  Newport area is also awesome and you can catch a reds game across the river if they are playing while you are here.

Kentucky,33q7uh,Prufrockz,7,Fri Apr 24 16:58:45 2015 UTC,"Man, then I gotta go with Louisville.  Bardstown road has a great bar scene, lots of good places to eat.    Louisville has the Muhammad Ali Center, Slugger museum, all that kinda stuff.  If you want to see something cool downtown that's a little different, check out 21c Hotel.  It's a hotel with really unique art instillations.  Outdoors, we have  a huge parks system.  Check out Cherokee park for sure.  There are a ton more!"

Kentucky,33q7uh,diddlydiddler,1 point,Sun May 3 03:09:51 2015 UTC,ok cool. but in general lexington still isn't a bad city overall right? just in case i pass through
Kentucky,33q7uh,oricthedamned,10,Fri Apr 24 17:17:29 2015 UTC,"Best way to look at lexington is that is a bit more quaint than louisville.  Great bar scene, smaller, but great.  Hang around the Pavillion downtown, Cheapside, stuff like that.  A handful of great restaurants around there too.  You don't seem interested in horse racing, but if you're in town while it's in season its an absolute must.  Louisville has the Slugger Museum, Ali stuff, more ""attraction"" type things.  Lexington is more enjoyable to walk around and take in the scenery.  Louisville has the river to walk near while lexington doesnt.    Also in lex you can drive in almost any direction and be in beautiful scenery and horse farms within 10 minutes where Louisville is more urban>suburban>somewhat boring rural.  As someone very familiar with both, i personally enjoy lexington more but maybe bc i lived there longer.  If you go to Lex and are looking for relaxing things to do in the day, check out the Lexington Cemetary, Ashland Henry Clay House (in a great area to just drive or walk the neighborhood), Mary Todd Lincoln's house is downtown.  There's a few breweries in or near downtown too.  You can go check out UK's campus too.  Look for local events such as farmer's markets and art shows"
Kentucky,33q7uh,diddlydiddler,2,Fri Apr 24 17:48:43 2015 UTC,"I live in the Ashland Park neighborhood. It's amazing how many people don't know about it, it'a ridiculously beautiful, especially if you like house porn."

You could take a look at the tour schedule for alltech brewing Co. or any distillery on the Bourbon trail. Mammoth cave is fun(check their scheduling), I think six flags just reopened...  If you want to be more outdoorsy then head over to the red River gorge and check out the arches/bridges."
Kentucky,33q7uh,BigTimeOwen,1 point,Fri Apr 24 19:12:13 2015 UTC,"No, not bad at all!  Just not nearly as much to do, in my opinion."
Kentucky,33q7uh,Tuckessee,3,Fri Apr 24 17:27:58 2015 UTC,What's your time frame? Both cities are definitely worth checking out but if you only have 2-3 days it might not be worth it to explore both.
Kentucky,33q7uh,lobo2_me,3,Fri Apr 24 19:22:55 2015 UTC,"Get you some Bourbon & Toulouse in Lexington (not two things, one great Cajun restaurant), follow the brew grass tour and see the horse farms that spring to everyone's mind when you mention Kentucky. Louisville's highlands and  Bardstown road areas have the coolest shops and food, and Cherokee Park is wonderful. If you're still into cities there's Covington, but we concede the the northern most counties to Ohio. My real advice is to skip all three, get out and see the real Kentucky, one that's largely wild and rural, from Black Mountain and the Cumberland Gap to the lazy cypress swamps and bayous of the Purchase. The real commonwealth is somewhere in between all this, cosmopolitan factions fighting the stereotypes associated with the region, and generations old families clinging to their heritage. You'll find us a warm and welcoming state, as the South and the hospitality that goes along with it start here, but as a border state we're more accustomed to dealings with other regions. For more rural suggestions, plan a longer stay and holler"
Kentucky,33q7uh,selfabortion,4,Mon Apr 27 14:19:46 2015 UTC,I've lived in both.  Currently in Lex.  Lexington is nice but Louisville has much more to offer a tourist.
Kentucky,33q7uh,campersdeath,3,Fri Apr 24 23:37:07 2015 UTC,My vote is for Louisville
Kentucky,33q7uh,mgcarter3,4,Fri Apr 24 21:18:07 2015 UTC,I would also highly recommend the Covington / Newport area of Kentucky. Lots of great music venues & cool bars surrounding the The Newport Aquarium. It's the part of Kentucky I think a lot of people forget about. It's around the Cincinnati Metro on the Kentucky side but has a lot to offer.

It's also not good if you head too far away from a major city on the interstate. It's also not good if you're inside a big-box store or office building due to the frequency their network uses (it doesnt penetrate as well as what the other networks use). You may also find your phone's battery dying quickly because it is constantly trying to ping the towers. If you do have a signal, then it may be only voice, not data.   It was a very frustrating experience for me, especially seeing everyone else use their phones and I'm sitting there with 0 bars. Personally I switched to at&t which is more expensive than tmo but has excellent coverage (not as good or fast as verizon though).  Now I am on cricket - its prepaid but uses att's towers - actually att bought them out. I brought my own phone and pay 35$/month for unlimited talk/text and 5 gigs.

It didn't seem to me that the coal companies were actually contributing to meaningful economic growth there, and really only profiting themselves."

They don’t have the luxury of choosing where that will be.""  That really struck a chord with me. So many people are trapped in the cycle of poverty that breeds contempt for the region.

Kentucky,324e69,ReaditLore,5,Fri Apr 10 14:22:49 2015 UTC,"The current gas tax is 18.4 cents and about 3 of that currently goes to local transit projects. If I understand the congressman right, he'd like the full amount sent to the Highway Trust Fund to help cover budget shortfalls. There's also an understandable appeal in finding money in the budget for infrastructure without new taxes or higher tax rates.  http://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/2015/03/19/thomas-massie-transit-funding/25035063/  I don't think there's anything obviously wrong with the idea.

Economically,  it makes sense to tax gas and encourage transit use. This is one of the biggest things being pushed by economists and urban planners. Just doing what's best for rural areas is shortsighted and will harm the US economy,s competitiveness.   We have to act collectively to do what's best for everyone. Congress has been underfunding highways and bridges and rail/transit  infrastructure for decades now."
Kentucky,324e69,Neurokeen,2,Fri Apr 10 18:38:52 2015 UTC,"we have to look at the big picture, and do what's best for the country as a whole.   Highways and bridges are used by all Americans. Where urban transit systems only serve people who live in cities. If the common good is your interest it makes sense to consider his idea as a way of serving it."
Kentucky,324e69,ReaditLore,1 point,Fri Apr 10 21:27:29 2015 UTC,"Everyone needs highways and bridges to get goods around the country, but that doesn't negate the importance of mass transit. They're both important, and they're both in desperate need of funding.   Americans are increasingly living in denser areas. Mass transit systems around the country have seen unprecedented growth in ridership. People are driving less. And when they do, they're buying less gasoline because they have more fuel efficient vehicles. The current tax system, the way we fund highway and road construction is unsustainable.  Why would our politicians ignore those trends when they're addressing this issue?   The total number of vehicle-miles traveled in the U.S. remains about 2 percent below its 2007 pea. The number of miles driven in 2013 was lower than that of the 12-month period ending February 2005 – a nearly nine-year period of stagnation in total vehicle travel unprecedented in modern U.S. history.   http://usa.streetsblog.org/2014/02/24/2013-another-year-of-falling-per-capita-driving-in-u-s/   CBO projects that, starting in 2015, the highway account of the Highway Trust Fund will have insufficient revenues to meet its obligations, resulting in steadily accumulating shortfalls. That projection is based on two assumptions: that the taxes whose receipts are allocated to the highway account will continue at their current rates (most of those taxes are scheduled to expire at the end of September 2016) and that federal funding for highways will increase at CBO’s projected rate of inflation. To avoid such shortfalls, lawmakers would have to enact legislation to reduce highway funding, increase dedicated tax receipts, transfer money from the general fund of the Treasury to the Highway Trust Fund (as has occurred in recent years), or undertake some combination of those approaches.   His method of raising funds is a temporary solution at best. And it would hurt US economic growth in the process. Cities and States around the country would have to scramble to make up for the lost funds. Infrastructure that is already falling apart, causing mass transit delays for millions of people would get even worse.   Cities and mass transit play an important role in supporting businesses. Helping them attract talent, becoming hubs for specialized industries. You may not realize it, but rural areas depend on that as much as anyone else in the country. It's all interdependent. There's also a ton of potential in transit oriented development right now, that is starting to address some of the sprawl issues that were created in the past few decades. Tons of other stuff too."

Rural people pay most of the costs while only receiving some of the benefits. What makes sense when funding these shortfalls is going to depend a lot on who you are."
Kentucky,324e69,Dirty_Old_Town,1 point,Tue Apr 14 18:29:18 2015 UTC,I don't see any reason to upset the status quo right now. If we can pull 19.5 billion from the general fund to cover the HTF's shortfalls in 2010 we can do the same for the much more modest shortfalls we usually see. (numbers from wikipedia and Rep. Massie's press release)  If at some point we face the choice the congressman presents in his press release - between raising the gas tax some cents on the gallon or redistributing funds from side projects I'd favor the former.  Not getting federal funds from the Highway Trust Fund for urban development doesn't mean those side projects won't be funded. If Lexington wants to refurbish their sidewalks they can make room for that in the city budget. If Ashland wants to add more bus stops they can do the same or take the project to the guys in Frankfort.

Kentucky,31errm,ZeGentleman,1 point,Sun Apr 5 08:39:48 2015 UTC,Corbin native here - going to the KFC at home expecting anything outstanding is setting yourself up for disappointment. That's not to say I don't see quite a few people every time I'm home out taking pictures in front of the store.

I don't know exactly what I was expecting, but the food was pretty much a big letdown.  We could have been eating at any KFC anywhere in the U.S.   There are some coolish museum exhibits, but I wouldn't have driven the hour and a half from our house just to look at it.  Let alone make the kind of drive you're planning.  Now you've got me wanting fried chicken!!"

She went on to tell us that recent guests of hers had been robbed twice in the same day, walking around the city.

One day I missed out on a discount because I didn't have my student ID with me, so on the fourth day I just said whatever, I'll carry a small bag with a bottle of water like everyone else in my group and threw my wallet in there.

I was suddenly stricken by the thought that  I had obliviously gone about my business while spring was bursting forth all around me.   Since then I've made a conscious effort every spring to keep an eye on the trees as I go about my day to day business....It's amazing how quickly those swollen buds will become leaves as big as your pinky nail; and just as amazing is how quickly those pinky nail sized leaves will become as big as your hand!  For five years I drove through the Kentucky River Palisades to work, and there was always something different on every drive.   It was almost magical to see the first hints and whispers of green in the river cliffs when the earliest trees were starting to bud out.    Every morning you could see larger and denser patches of green.   Same with the slight wisps purple in the trees when the redbuds were fixin' to burst into bloom, each day they became more and more strident.    Fall was pretty cool too.   When the nights started getting cool there are tiny pockets of color dotted here and there and each day they spread like small fires."

Kentucky,318mle,lostpreacher,4,Thu Apr 2 21:37:14 2015 UTC,"Re-posting this from a /r/Supernatural thread.  I'm going to be a little vague about it because of something that ended up happening with the pastor that owned the cabin.  Happened in Lawrence County, though.  The story goes that a local pastor back in the 70's and 80's had a cabin that he'd let people stay in sometimes. Small place, just a couple rooms and beds and all that, nothing special, except he kept one of the doors chained and locked shut, and some stories mention that there were children's shoes nailed all along the walls near the ceiling. The story he'd tell the people staying in the cabin was that once you go to bed and turn out the lights, you do not get out of bed no matter what. Once you get in bed, you stay in bed until sunrise.  The rest of the story goes that his family had, for the lack of a better way of describing it, a demon. Some stories around here just call it a creature, but a lot of them specifically call it a demon. Someone in the family had been involved in some stuff they shouldn't have been involved in, and had managed to seal a demon in this cabin, behind the chained and locked door.  Well, the story I heard from one of my friends' dad's is that when he and his brother were in their 20's, they stayed in that cabin one night, and decided to see what would happen if they got out of bed. Friend's dad's brother got out of bed, while friend's dad stayed in bed. He said he heard the chains rattling and sliding loose from the door, and the locks hitting the floor, and a few moments later his brother starts screaming, and a loud ""THUMP"" sound every few seconds. His brother ran back to bed, covered up, and didn't say anything the rest of the night. He said he heard the chains go back and the locks lock again, which made no sense because it was on the outside of the door in the room they were in, and they were the only ones in the room. The next morning, the brother said he couldn't see what it was because it was pitch black, but it felt like he was being beaten by a heavy stick.  Now, what it probably was.. back in the mid 90's, the pastor was arrested for child molestation. The cabin where this all happened ended up getting burned down to the ground. He apparently scared the kids that were staying in the cabin, saying he'd ""protect them from the house"" and other stuff like that, to coax them into whatever it was that he wanted to do to the kids. Guy ended up dying in prison, I think."
Kentucky,318mle,unclebeard,2,Sat Apr 4 01:09:26 2015 UTC,"Absolutely great story. The truth and the legend both equally creepy. A child molesting preacher and a demon,  I'm surprised a movie hasn't been made yet. Thanks."

Kentucky,30hnbd,Gouretoratto,4,Fri Mar 27 18:58:08 2015 UTC,"This article gravely provides misinformation about Suboxone though. Huge thumbs down for Huffington Post for literally doing zero homework and asking one of the most unpopular treatment centers for its opinions on treatment. Lol.    I support the legislation to an extent. I'm all for SEPs, they have amazing track records of lowering transmission and spreading of HIV and Hep C (which KY leads the nation in Hep C cases).    I'm not sure the parts related to jail for certain amounts of heroin will be as effective as they think. We will have to see...    Guarantee you shortly the state will be pushing for Suboxone treatment and providing some sort of funding. They recently started passing all sorts of regulations on Buprenorphine behind closed doors (without telling anyone, let alone the Suboxone Clinics).    Sadly the legislation isn't good in terms of good quality treatment for addicts and will either shut down a bunch of clinics in the state (which has already happened, many are kicking out Medicaid patients) or they will turn the ones left into pill mills looking to get as many people through their doors as fast as possible.    It's sad really. They're trying to force all Suboxone providers and clinics to accept Medicaid while at the same time pushing forth a ton of regulations. No legitimate office that cares about quality treatment can survive or run on Medicaid reimbursement. (~$53 per patient per month) They are required to monitor UDS, see patients a certain number of times within the first 3 months, do a certain number of random drug screenings, consult physicians who have to have SPECIFIC licenses and certifications, etc.    Source: I work for a Suboxone clinic in Lexington"
Kentucky,30hnbd,fuzio,4,Fri Mar 27 22:03:37 2015 UTC,"I work for an outpatient drug and alcohol facility in Philadelphia area which does medication assisted treatment (Methadone, Suboxone, and Vivitrol). We don't accept private insurance only Medicare and County Funding.   As you said the restrictions are very intense and it can take months to get someone approved for Suboxone because you need to prove 12 straight months of dependency which isn't as easy as it might seem cause you need proof of treatment. And they basically need to be in active withdraw so we need to essentially tell clients to use in order to get accepted but their ""supposed to use responsibly"" which is insane.   As for the number of sessions per month our regulations are 2.5 hours per month which really isn't that stringent considering clients are expected to attend 1 hour individual and 2 hours of group a week. But it can still be an issue but it's not that difficult. Urine Screens, observed or unobserved, are 1 a month and they meet with the doctor for 15 minutes anywhere from once a week to once a month though most are every other week. This aspect is actually the most beneficial as we can leverage that time and hold clients prescriptions until they talk to their counselor which saves many clients.  I could go on and on about Medication Assisted Treatment but I'll leave it at that. It's not a perfect system by far. The worst is getting them started but it is helpful still."
Kentucky,30hnbd,DeRanjed,6,Sat Mar 28 03:34:35 2015 UTC,"We don't accept any insurance for office visits, which a lot of people tend to see as ""shady business practices"" which I can understand why they think that, but after having worked here for a year; it would be impossible for a small clinic like ours to operate if we accepted insurance for office visits.    Medicaid Reimbursement (which I would estimate over 85% of our patients are on Medicaid) is ~$53 per patient, per month. Say you have one physician (we have more but this is just to show people what I mean) who has been prescribing Suboxone for a year and has petitioned for his 100 patients, that's $5300/month.    We pay our physicians malpractice insurance (which is almost unheard of in this state for any Suboxone Clinic) so even if we take that out of the equation, you need at least a receptionist, office manager, medical biller/coder and at least 3-4 other employees (contracting a lab, etc.) at a bare minimum. Pay one of those employees $10/hr (which isn't great but it's okay pay here in KY) and that right there is $1600/mth. You still have to pay your other employees, pay the physician, pay the laboratory, etc.    The only way a facility could take insurance for office visits and run would be if it's a massive network of facilities and have the resources to bill insurance easily (and not a small clinic like ours) or if they don't give two shits about quality healthcare and just want to see as many patients as possible as fast as possible and bill insurance for everything under the sun.    Here in KY, it's fairly easy to get insurances to cover Suboxone. It mainly requires a Prior Authorization, copy of their UDS and copy of the doctor's note. I get approvals back sometimes within a few hours.     And they basically need to be in active withdraw so we need to essentially tell clients to use in order to get accepted but their ""supposed to use responsibly"" which is insane.     Yes, this is one of the things I truly hate. Many people call us because they've been without medication trying to do something right or because their doctor kicked them out for having medicaid and they can't find a facility and have nothing in their system, so legally we can't provide them with treatment.    We don't have a problem with the regulations, in fact most of the stuff they put in the new regulation, our facility was already doing (and we were the only facility that attended the public hearings about the legislation and provided additional opinions that they added in), our main issue is that they're trying to force all clinics to accept insurance for office visits. Medicaid is arguing that if someone is on Medicaid, how can they afford a $310/mth office visit. Which, on it's face, makes sense but we offer them unlimited doctor visits, we will prescribe medication for sinus infections and general problems like that, so they don't have to pay co-pays to see their PCP and it's likely easier to come see us. We prescribe things like Vistaril for anxiety, provide referrals for Hep C (which KY leads the entire nation in; I would say easily 80%+ of our patients are Hep C+).    Some of the regulations, however; are ridiculous. They want us to, prior to seeing the patient the first time, obtain ""all medical records"" for the patient from any physician they've seen. It doesn't specify what type of physician, how long ago, etc. So we basically have to request records from EVERY person they've seen for the past 2 years. Dentists, everything...even things that aren't related to Opioid dependence at all. Half the time the patients won't tell us their past physicians because they're afraid we are going to tell them they're addicts, they don't want us having their records, etc. but we have to or we can't treat them. Takes a lot of time and work to get that done, half the time we have to run their kasper report and try to find where the doctor is located. That's like hunting down a unicorn...     We also required they attend a 12-step program (and it's part of the regulation) 2x week. Some of our physicians provide counseling during their session with the patient each time they're here. Some don't.    Sorry for the massive post. xD We're fine with a lot of the regulation, it's just trying to force people to accept medicaid for office visits will shut us down. We had to unenroll from Medicaid or else we would have to accept it. Thankfully, 2 KY Medicaid plans don't require you be enrolled in Medicaid to submit prior authorizations for medication. If they change that, I'll be out of a job. :/"
Kentucky,30hnbd,fuzio,3,Sat Mar 28 10:43:40 2015 UTC,"I work over in West Virginia, and have previously worked in KY. The regulations in WV are much more strict, and more closely line up with proposed plans. It has probably hurt the patients more than anyone else. It forced the doctors to simply only accept cash, and then the patients are forced to pay cash at the pharmacy. It causes them to pay upwards of around 900-1200 a month in their treatment. This has increased diversion of medications in our community. Our office found a loophole with the regulations, and had it accepted by Medicaid, so thankfully we're actually making a difference now. But damn if Medicaid in WV isn't the biggest headache of my job, much more so than the patients."
Kentucky,30hnbd,LarsViener,3,Sat Mar 28 13:25:54 2015 UTC,"KY actually modeled their legislation after the WV legislation. We happened to come across the WV stuff one day and that's how we found out about KY doing it. They were passing all this legislation in private and not even telling the clinics, so we were having new regulations to comply with and no one was telling us. We were telling other clinics who had no idea...      Yea, I deal with all the prior authorizations for our office and I can tell you, I've never hated insurance companies and their employees more than I do now.    They hire incompetent morons. -__-"
Kentucky,30hnbd,fuzio,3,Sat Mar 28 15:03:37 2015 UTC,"No worries about the length. I'm from KY and will never stop trying to convince my girlfriend to move to Lexington so I'm definitely interested in how things work there.  They want us to, prior to seeing the patient the first time, obtain ""all medical records"" for the patient from any physician they've seen.>    That is INSANITY. I could not imagine having to make that happen.   I work at a Counseling facility that also provides Medication Assisted Treatment which, in my area, there are not many but there are a few options. That being said there are MANY suboxone doctors in the area. Most ARE shady and hand out prescriptions like candy and even will provide faked urine. But there are a handful we refer to because they are on the up and up. Maybe 1 or 2 accept any kind of insurance either.  I definitely see what you mean about the financial costs. My guess is that Kentucky would probably have to go the way it is here in PA which is to have Medication and Counseling in the same building. The only reason I say that is because I know that PA is also very heavy on regulations. We had a team of specialists come out from California to give a training and their direct quote was ""Our job is to analyze different state systems and we must say that PA has the worst regulations of anywhere we've seen""   Just keep the faith and keep working to make a difference. I've got a few clients who are really working their asses off and their happiness keeps me going. Just remember that you're helping people."

I don't know where you're staying and I don't know what you're used to, but there is a Food Giant in town.  It's good enough for your basic grocery needs - milk, bread, meat, etc.  I wouldn't expect lobster, or even much kosher, but it should do for most stuff.  Otherwise, Hopkinsville isn't too far.  ""Hopkinsville isn't too far"" is probably going to be a re-occuring sentence."
Kentucky,30gped,jonathanpepper,1 point,Fri Mar 27 14:20:34 2015 UTC,"A better sentence that should pop up frequently is ""Clarksville is not too far.""  Hopkinsville is better than Cadiz (as far as having, you know, things), but Clarksville is going to be the closest place where you have several choices of activities."
Kentucky,30gped,grahamiam,1 point,Fri Mar 27 17:43:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, House of Spice is surprisingly good for being an Indian restaurant in the middle of nowhere.  Beyond it, though, there's not much besides the Lakes (incl. Land Between the Lakes).  45 minutes away (depending on which end of Cadiz you're at, it's surprisingly sprawling) is Paducah which has a lot to do.  Hopkinsville is closer but I haven't spent any time there in a long time."

Kentucky,30gped,jonathanpepper,1 point,Fri Mar 27 17:17:43 2015 UTC,"I arrived not too long ago and I certainly feel like I'm being punished. There isn't wifi and I'm currently in a wooden cabin (with no heat- just AC) huddled in the corner because I have sort of a signal to see what you all said to do here. It's very rustic and beautiful ....and also a possible death trap. I've never been camping before and I wasn't told anything about this trip. I asked the lady at the desk where the trollies are so I can take my luggage and she, sensing I've never stepped foot out of the city, told me to think of it as ""glamping.""  I asked what she meant and she said ""glamorous camping.""   The good news is everyone is super nice and, though I don't have a refrigerator, I bought beer and I can just keep it outside to stay cold. So, cheers Kentucky! I'm making the best of this and I'm looking forward to seeing what else happens tomorrow."

Kentucky,30ed9c,Allan57,3,Thu Mar 26 18:46:08 2015 UTC,This. If you come to Kentucky during the fall please be sure to check out keeneland or even churchill downs and if there isn't racing I would go visit the Kentucky horse park! There are wineries near lexington that give tours as well as great craft breweries you should check out. For the outdoorsy type Mammoth cave or natural bridge are within a short drive.
Kentucky,30ed9c,ipullout2L8,3,Thu Mar 26 20:19:15 2015 UTC,"You might try planning for this weekend. The Kentucky Bourbon Festival  Bardstown is a sweet little town, it's close-ish to Mammoth Cave, a cool place to tour if you're not claustrophobic.    From Mammoth Cave it's a short trip to Bowling Green, birthplace of the Corvette.      If you can't make it for the actual festival and prefer central Kentucky you can always just do the Kentucky Bourbon Trail."
Kentucky,30ed9c,that-old-broad,3,Thu Mar 26 18:53:40 2015 UTC,"We just got back and did half a dozen of the tours.  But honestly you could get away with doing only two tours....get a 'top to bottom' experience with tons of information and tasting, see amazing properties, and be totally stoked.  Willet and Buffalo Trace hardhat tour.  Each of these is completely behind the scenes, very thorough, great history, etc.  The difference being that Willet is tiny compared with BT, which is a giant by comparison...so seeing the production facilities and scale of each is very cool.  Willet's tasting in particular is amazing.  They offer you practically as many tastings as you're interested in taking, 6-8 different open bottles, including a lot of the older and better bottles, as opposed to most distilleries which generally give you a couple of their base offerings only.  Hope that helps."
Kentucky,30ed9c,venice7771,2,Fri Mar 27 04:12:53 2015 UTC,Not sure why no one has really answered your question. Yes the races are an awesome time to come and yes you onl;y really should visit two or three distilleries of your favorites if you don't wanna get burnt out.  Other things to do:  Kentucky Horse Park  My Old Kentucky Dinner Train  The Steven Foster Story  Forts Harrod and Boonesborough  Shakertown Village and Trail System and River Boat Tour  Country Boys or West Sixth MicroBrews.   Lexington Cemetery (actually a pretty neat place)  Lexington Opera House  Ashland Estate (Henry Clay''s home)  Kentucky State Capital and downtown Frankfort  Bardstown Square and Talbot Tavern (rated the best in the state recently)  Toyota Plant Tour in Georgetown  Abbey of Gethsemane  (a pretty awesome place btw)  Abraham Lincoln Birthplace  Louisville Slugger Museum  Kentucky Science Center  Churchill Downs (where the Derby is)  Versailles Castle   Any number of horse farm tours/back road tours  This is al stuff that falls generally along the bourbon trail BTW. Not the whole state. And it certainly isn't close to being all your available options. The Kentucky Tourism Website is actually pretty good at listing festivals and all available things to do in each county. So I would call them or go online and see if there is anything you think that your dad would really be into.   Hope this helps.

Kentucky,307g40,chuckmilam,3,Wed Mar 25 14:20:00 2015 UTC,"I understand that you're supposed to pay to adopt a dog from any animal shelter, but it just feels kind of weird that you all want to go get the dog and bring it back to the shelter. Of course there's no guarantee it's going to a good home (indicative of the type of people that would steal a dog from the shelter), but still- the dog presumably has a family that wants it now and wants to take care of it. Hopefully someone knows these people and will convince them to come back and pay for it. Unlikely though."
Kentucky,307g40,a_jax,16,Wed Mar 25 03:54:36 2015 UTC,"It's not about the money. LHS works hard to make sure the pups not only go to a home, but go to a GOOD home.   There's a good chance if the couple tried to adopt this puppy that they would have been denied, which might be the reason for them stealing the pup.   It really isn't about the fee, it's about making sure that the pup goes to a good home where he will be taken care of and that's all they're wanting is to find him to make sure that he's not being used as dog bait or sold to someone else.   A responsible owner that goes into the shelter, fills out the proper paperwork, and yes, pays the adoption fee, usually doesn't have bad intentions for the dog.   Someone that steals a dog, probably has something to hide."
Kentucky,307g40,hadyr,6,Wed Mar 25 03:57:42 2015 UTC,Ahhhhh I see. I didn't realize there was a thorough process of evaluating the people that are adopting the dog. Thanks for the insight.
Kentucky,307g40,Venge,10,Wed Mar 25 04:02:19 2015 UTC,"Anytime. I actually adopted my dog from LHS so I'm very passionate about what they do.   Any dog owner or potential dog owner should know that $200 is a VERY low price to pay for adoption. The first set of vet visits with the first round of vaccines and the spay/neuter can cost well over $300-$400.   And the cost of having a dog is even more extreme. If you can't pay to adopt the dog, how are you going to pay for the annual vet visits and vaccines, food and other emergencies that came up?  I don't mean to go out on a tangent, but I really believe in what LHS does and they do work hard to  put dogs in good homes with responsible owners.   Also, I don't think I mentioned this before, but the dog that was stolen was already pending adoption to a family with a little boy. It just breaks my heart thinking of this boy who was about to get a new puppy, just to have someone steal him."

Property tax at the local level, the gas tax at the State and Federal one.  Now, before I get lambasted for ""tax-and-spend liberalism"", it's important to understand that the amount we are taxed compared to the amount we use infrastructure has changed by orders of magnitude since the infrastructure system was developed before most of us were ever born."

It you want the absolute darkest areas I have ever seen look for something in Livingston or Crittenden County. They are by far the most rural counties in the state and rural as all get out. The Big Rivers Wildlife Area on the Tradewater River is also really flat and ridiculously secluded.   These places don't have many public areas, but i lived out there for a while and the flat full sky view on a summer night is amazing. But the drop in elevation can be a bummer on clarity unlike in the Cumberlands where they shine though so crisp.   Not sure open it is, but Blue Licks Battlefield State park is also really neat and closer to Lexington for you. And Pine Mtn. State Park is about as high as you can go, I've camped up that area and the night view can knock you on your back. But I am not sure about the vehicle/camper situation at those points.   Just some ideas. Everyone always thinks of the Gorge, but there's tons of options. Good luck!"

For such a small and rural area Madisonville has a bit of a nasty undercurrent of drug culture (heroin, pills and meth). This is mostly due to the coal mining mindset which is sort of understandable. Don't get sucked into it. I know of well educated outsiders who came to town for a medical internship, job, etc. who fell into it and destroyed their lives.

Kentucky,2z0cee,atfeld01,1 point,Sat Mar 14 13:56:26 2015 UTC,"Louisville Museum Plaza:       Louisville Museum Plaza was a 62-story skyscraper that was planned for Louisville, Kentucky, United States.  By August 1, 2011, despite the expenditure of public funds on its behalf, its developers had officially announced that they were abandoning plans to build it.  The 703-foot (214 m) tall skyscraper was projected to cost $490 million and contain a 1-acre (0.40 ha) public plaza and park, condominiums, lofts, a hotel, retail shops and a museum. If built, it would have replaced the AEGON Center as the tallest building in Kentucky. The avant-garde design of the skyscraper was chosen by New York City REX architect Joshua Prince-Ramus. A groundbreaking ceremony was held on October 25, 2007, and construction at that time was expected to be complete by 2010. Delays disrupted the project. Prior to announcing that the project had been abandoned, Craig Greenberg, one of the projects four developers, had stated that he was ""hopeful that construction will start this year [2010]""  and that he also expected the project to be completed by late 2012.

That said, it's often not economically feasible for someone to commute to a job that's an hour or two away. That's like saying if I can't find a job in Louisville, then I should drive to Cincinnati, or Indianapolis, or Nashville.  My family has done this for generations though. Leave on a Sunday night, hit I75 for Dayton, or Michigan, work through the week, and come back home late Friday morning. Being away from your family, your friends, and your community just eats at your soul, and your pocketbook, though. And you have to have good health to do it.  The problem lies within the exportation of our youth. Our best and brightest leave for college, and just can't come back home because there isn't anyway they can make a living and support their families. Especially with the coal fields drying up.  I would like to see reliable communications in this area, internet, cell. And for heaven's sake, isn't there some way we can get these girls a car so they can go to college? This is Reddit. If we can find a way to give a guy a kidney, surely we can set these girls up with a reliable used vehicle. Preferably with four wheel drive so they can come make it home in the winter time.

They have no special skills or training and moving to a new places requires having a place to live set up and finding a job, which still isn't easy, all of that costs money which they don't have much of to begin with. The culture they've been raised in is a very ignorant one, and while there is little opportunity in where they live, there is familiarity.

Kentucky,2ysqxl,DangerRanger79,4,Thu Mar 12 17:42:36 2015 UTC,"If you keep doin' what you been doin', you're gonna keep gettin' what you been gettin'.  The lack of jobs and opportunity in the area is certainly nothing new.  It just seems like the land just won't support many people.  It's not good farmland.  It's not centrally located such that it would make a good transportation hub.  There's no compelling reason to build factories there.  There's limited tourist appeal.  And the long-term prognosis for coal isn't good.  Geographic and economic realities suggest to me that this is not the land of milk and honey, nor will it magically transform itself into it -- no matter how many well intentioned economic development dollars we pour into it.  Which brings me to my next question.  To what extent should I, as a taxpayer from another, more economically self-sufficient part of the state, be required to subsidize these folks' unwillingness to relocate?  If you stubbornly refuse to move out of Death Valley, should I be required to pay for your air conditioning?  If you choose to live in an economic dead-end, don't come bitching to me about it when you're poor.  Staying in the homeplace is all well and good, perhaps even admirable, but it is a choice.  Like all choices, it has consequences.  As to the feasibility of moving to a different area, somehow millions of illegal immigrants manage it, despite facing even more daunting obstacles."

Kentucky,2y1zgl,that-old-broad,2,Fri Mar 6 05:26:03 2015 UTC,Bluegrass airport is an NOAA weather station. They use precise instruments to measure precipitation - it's not some dude sticking a ruler in the ground.
Kentucky,2y1zgl,WizardTrembyle,1 point,Fri Mar 6 05:32:41 2015 UTC,"Actually, that's pretty damned close to what they do.     To properly measure snowfall you have a nice flat surface at least ten feet from any trees or structures.    A sheet of plywood does quite nicely.   Your surface needs to be swept clean after each measurement so you're not measuring old snowfall.     You measure in several different spots on your flat surface and average those measurements.   You measure each morning with a 'snow stick' which is basically a metal  yardstick with the inches divided into tenths.    I'm not going to go to the trouble of digging mine up and snapping a shot and posting a photo.   You'll just have to make do with this photo of a guy using one from the NOAA website.     Another thing the weather geeks at NOAA really like to do is to measure the snowfall as a liquid.   To do this, you take a two part rain gauge like this and use the large outer container as a cookie cutter to get a 'punch' of the snow--again using your flat surface.    Then you melt the snow in that container and pour the liquid into the center tube of the gauge and measure that liquid.  Source:   used to be paid by NOAA to keep a home weather station and report precipitation and twice daily river levels when we lived near the river"

Kentucky,2xs0x7,ds580,1 point,Tue Mar 3 20:24:52 2015 UTC,Check out the wiki article on the Three-tier system.  The supplier is the first tier (brewer) who supplies the product to the distributor (2nd tier).
Kentucky,2xs0x7,jcembree,1 point,Tue Mar 3 20:33:44 2015 UTC,"Three-tier (alcohol distribution):       The three-tier system of alcohol distribution is the system for distributing alcoholic beverages set up in the United States after the repeal of Prohibition.  The three tiers are producers, distributors, and retailers. The basic structure of the system is that producers can sell their products only to wholesale distributors who then sell to retailers, and only retailers may sell to consumers. Producers include brewers, wine makers, distillers and importers.  Some states chose to become alcoholic beverage control jurisdictions after Prohibition. In these states, part or all of the distribution tier, and sometimes also the retailing tier, are operated by the state government itself (or by contractors operating under its authority) rather than by independent private entities.  The only state with a privately operated retailing and distribution system that does not require any form of three-tier system is the State of Washington. In Washington, retailers may purchase alcoholic beverages directly from producers, may negotiate volume discounts, and may warehouse their inventory themselves. However, the three-tier system remains a de facto reality in Washington despite the law.

He's old school about everything. We were discussing this bill and what the consequences will be. I showed him pictures of trans people, mostly men who were biologically born women. He was very surprised at how they looked. People who would not be welcome in a women's bathroom as they look like the gender they identify with. I mentioned my sister from another mister who was born male but looks like a female. My grandfather agreed that she wouldn't look right going into the men's room. I think many people, too many in fact, think that trans people are men with beards and shitty wigs and stuffed bras.  Building extra bathrooms or forcing them to go to a separate bathroom isn't financially logical. It's also not the schools business what's between a child's legs. I expect any schools that force these changes will be getting sued, the ACLU involved and just a whole shitstorm of bad press and money issues when and if this goes through.  The man who proposed this bill should use his own money to fund these extra bathrooms since it's so important for him to force a gender on children who feel unsure or not the right gender. He's for being fiscally conservative and small government yet he and the rest of his shitty right wing buddies (not all though, 3 voted no) need a wake up call because they are voting to force segregation and take away basic human privilege of using a bathroom that feels right to them."

Kentucky,2wzex3,Cremaster1983,2,Tue Feb 24 19:16:54 2015 UTC,"Try a little thought exercise with me real quick:  Imagine that you, as a man, are banned from using the men's restroom. Would you feel entirely comfortable using the women's restroom? Maybe. Maybe not. Lets say you're not. But, state law prohibits you from using your own (Men's) restroom. Instead, you have to go through a long, obstructionist and bureaucratic process of having a special bathroom set aside for you, because ""you make other men uncomfortable."" Does that sound like fun to you? Keep in mind that you'll be looked at differently for using your own, special restroom. (I say this mostly to head off the comment about how people think it would be pretty nice to have their own, private bathroom.)  The big difference between the state making you, as a man, use the men''s restroom and making trans men use the women's restroom (or trans women use the men's restroom) is not that you're being limited from a certain area, but you're being kept out of the area you identify with. They really are limiting transgender students more than any other student, because they're essentially forcing trans students to either use the wrong restroom, or seek special accommodation, for the sole reason that these students identify with a different gender than the rest of society identifies them with.  The reason that this makes Kentucky look bad is simple. This is discrimination. Discrimination is, by definition: ""treatment or consideration of, or making a distinction in favor of or against, a person or thing based on the group, class, or category to which that person or thing belongs rather than on individual merit"" (1)  What this bill proposes to do is require transgendered students (there's the ""group"" or ""class"" part of this) to use a specific restroom that they don't identify with (there's the treatment/consideration part).   Also, in a note that amuses me immensely for its irony, this is a near-perfect example of big government stepping in and trampling all over personal freedom and liberties. Take from that what you will about the inherent hypocrisy of certain segments of our body politick.   Edit for sources:  (1): Definition of discrimination, from dictionary.com, accessed 2/24/15. http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/discrimination"
Kentucky,2wzex3,Raszamatasz,4,Tue Feb 24 20:19:02 2015 UTC,"To continue your exercise:  I'm not saying you are wrong, and I'm not condoning discrimination of transgender people, but where does it end? Your definition of discrimination is nice, but can be used for just about anything.  I can't use women's restrooms purely because of the group (identify as male) I belong to.  Why should I be pigeonholed into using the same restroom my ""peers"" do when it is not based on merit?    What makes it okay to discriminate and deliniate based on gender identity rather than biological sex?  Your entire argument can be used both ways.   Again, I am not supporting this law or any discrimination, but I believe that this issue is nowhere near as simplistic as many would act.  You are condoning discrimination based on gender (why is this allowable?) but not sex.    And the big government thing, is it not trampling over liberties to disallow men from using women's restrooms and vice versa? The only difference is whether you think it is cool to discriminate via gender or sex.  The infringement of the government does not change in scope either way.  This whole issue is a prime example of conservatives and liberals being opposite sides of the same coin."

Kentucky,2wzex3,Gypsy_Cowboy,-1,Tue Feb 24 22:04:31 2015 UTC,"Sure, I see your angle, it is good, a bit snarky, but good point.  Though I can see the other as well:  Biologically male restrooms should stay biologically male restrooms (and vice versa).  The separation of restroom I have felt isn't due to common orientation, but due to common physiology.  There isn't a provision in this that says homosexuals who identify as ""the wife"" or ""butch"" have to use the opposite restroom.  (sorry for lack of appropriate terminology, ignorance on my part)  Guys already have the unspoken don't stand next to urinal thing, and I don't care who is crapping out in the stall next to me.  But there IS a reason our society has developed separate restrooms, and the issue is if that is a valid reason."
Kentucky,2wzex3,Gypsy_Cowboy,-1,Tue Feb 24 22:00:52 2015 UTC,"A few things you need to educate yourself on:   a special bathroom set aside for you   Or, like the bill says, you use the bathroom corresponding to your biological sex.   you make other men uncomfortable   What about those uncomfortable men? Are they supposed to just keep feeling uncomfortable?   using your own, special restroom   You act like there's going to be a third door at the end of every hallway in Kentucky.

Kentucky,2wbk3s,jjandre,3,Wed Feb 18 15:52:51 2015 UTC,"Layman summary and breakdown -   Summary:   HB 152 (and SB3) would remove the ""Carrier of Last Resort"" provisions from Kentucky law removing the requirement for  telecomm companies (AT&T, Windstream, or Cincinnati Bell) to provide landline service to Kentuckians living in areas with 15,000 or more housing units.   Breakdown of arguments:   Against: Those who oppose the bill (including the Kentucky Resources Council and AARP) feel that people in rural areas who rely on landline service for things like calling 911, sending faxes and other emergency-type services would be at a disadvantage and could not function as they do now.   For: Those who support (the Kentucky Chamber of Commerce, GLI, Bluegrass Institute) feel that these laws are impeding Kentucky's natural advancement toward IP based, broadband tech. They fear that because these companies are forced to invest in copper-based landline technology, they are forgoing investment in broadband infrastructure which will eventually be the standard (more people opting to use just cellphones rather than landlines than ever). With this investment in broadband (which is cheaper and has more longterm potential) broadband will become more accessible. Additionally, as a compromise from last year, they have excluded areas with less that 15K housing units, making most of the state immune."

Kentucky,2wbk3s,fradtheimpaler,1 point,Wed Feb 18 16:11:26 2015 UTC,"It sounds like the telecoms are wanting to count voip and mobile as phone service to get out of requirements to provide landline service to customers. Not sure if that's a good or bad thing.   Typically if the big telecoms are for it, I'm against it because I don't have faith that they care about innovation or customer satisfaction. It is cheaper to offer voip instead of landline, trading off reliability.  I don't have enough information to form an opinion yet."
Kentucky,2wbk3s,navi555,2,Wed Feb 18 16:50:57 2015 UTC,"My concern is 2 fold.  1)  It could people witg less technical (in old people) and 2) with Broadband expansion being as slow as it is in KY, I don't have much faith I in their investment in infrastructure."
Kentucky,2wbk3s,inserthandlehere,2,Wed Feb 18 20:53:39 2015 UTC,"Just to offer a countering viewpoint - the reason that there has been slow broadband expansion in KY is that these companies (due to the carrier of last resort laws written in the 80s) HAVE to build copper landlines and therefore CAN'T invest in broadband infrastructure. So, you can't really use that as the litmus test. If HB152 passes, these companies could build cell towers instead of copper-wire landlines in some of the more rural areas, increasing speed and access to broadband. Which would incentivize other types of investment and economic growth in our state. On a side note - KRS does have a ton of info on this, but they are (IMO) a very bias group on this topic. For instance, they have touted for years that people would lose their landlines if this passes. First of all, this bill would only relieve COLR laws for areas with 15,000 or more house (most rural areas not impacted). Second, folks who are in 15K areas or more would have the choice to stick with their landline or not, then after 30 days they have the option to switch back. I would just keep that in mind when reading their materials."
Kentucky,2wbk3s,panjadotme,3,Wed Feb 18 22:48:18 2015 UTC,HAVE to build copper landlines and therefore CAN'T invest in broadband infrastructure   I think keeping huge profits are more of a reason for not expanding... It's a cost to run copper but not THAT much lol
Kentucky,2wbk3s,navi555,1 point,Thu Feb 19 03:47:02 2015 UTC,It really depends.  running line in Lexington or Louisville would be a lot less expensive and much more profitable than running lines in the mountains.  I think there are good arguments on both sides.  The reason I'm so dubious of the Mobile/IP phone arguement is who's making the (the same people who oppose Net Neutrality)
Kentucky,2wbk3s,PM_ME_UR_FEDORA_TIPS,2,Fri Feb 20 22:06:49 2015 UTC,"I'm torn on this.  I'm all for better technology reaching everyone in the state and everyone in KY and this seems like it would force that issue - requiring companies to invest in cell towers and such rather than investing in what seems to be soon phased out phone technology. I like progress BUT - I don't feel I can get behind this. I have an elderly disabled mother that lives in central KY and lives in an area where cell phone signal and broadband internet are non-existent. I feel that although there are supposed to be clauses to protect her and people in her situation, she will likely fall between the cracks and be SOL."
Kentucky,2wbk3s,dchappy111,2,Thu Feb 19 02:40:56 2015 UTC,"There are mobile and voip solutions that are really no different than home phone service....  You can even plug in your own phone.    These phone providers currently have to provide copper,  and they aren't saying they are allowed to not provide an equivalent service,  they are just allowed to do it over mobile or voip now,  both of which provide greater bandwidth capabilities.   Assuming there is a provision that states that an equivalent mobile or voip based service must be made available at the same or reduced price,  I see this as being a good thing."
Kentucky,2wbk3s,nerdshark,2,Thu Feb 19 15:11:46 2015 UTC,"I'd say it's a bad thing, because VOIP devices require a working internet connection, which requires power. Phone lines are separate from the power grid (they carry their own power), so if you lose electricity and your cell phone dies, you could still have a landline backup. Now, if we had broadband modems that could be powered the same way, then it wouldn't be so bad, but as it stands now, basically all modems are dependent on both the power grid and the broadband network."
Kentucky,2wbk3s,DUBYATOO,0,Wed Feb 18 20:52:55 2015 UTC,They wouldn't be trading off reliability if they'd invest more in their broadband/fiber networks.  Too bad they won't do that either... since it costs money.

Kentucky,2w5xsj,The_Aesir9613,6,Tue Feb 17 05:35:41 2015 UTC,Knew it was Miguel's before clicking the photo.  Best pizza ever.
Kentucky,2w5xsj,greenwifelife,3,Tue Feb 17 14:15:22 2015 UTC,Where is this at?
Kentucky,2w5xsj,gtsmx_manbird,5,Tue Feb 17 12:52:47 2015 UTC,Miguel's pizza in Red River Gorge.  About 40 minutes east of Lexington.
Kentucky,2w5xsj,greenwifelife,3,Tue Feb 17 13:10:14 2015 UTC,Isn't it by natural bridge down the mountain Parkway?

Kentucky,2w5xsj,lazrbeam,3,Tue Feb 17 16:23:37 2015 UTC,"What's so good about it that makes it the ""best""? I enjoy taking road trips in our fine bluegrass state to explore great foods, sights, etc.  Is it worth a drive from NKY area?"
Kentucky,2w5xsj,Venge,7,Tue Feb 17 16:45:26 2015 UTC,"I would say its worth it just see the Red River Gorge, not necessarily for the pizza."
Kentucky,2w5xsj,am0x,6,Tue Feb 17 19:54:05 2015 UTC,"They use really fresh ingredients.  I've heard they grow their own tomatoes and spices for the sauce, but I'm not sure if that is true.  All I know is it is delicious, especially after a day of hiking at the park.  They are located in the Red River Gorge/Natural Bridge State Park area.  Beautiful country.  Absolutely worth a visit, especially in early summer or fall (if you can actually find a place to park at Miguel's - they stay packed during summer)."
Kentucky,2w5xsj,ZombieLibrarian,4,Tue Feb 17 17:17:06 2015 UTC,"is it worth it? absolutely. yes. The Red River George area is an immensely ecologically diverse area with amazing geographical features. It's also a fantastic (possibly top-rated?) place to climb as well. If you're not into climbing, a day hike there is phenomenal. What makes Miguel the ""best"", imho, is after you spend a day wearing yourself out enjoying the gorge, you come to sit at one of their picnic tables, suck down a long-neck Ale-8 and nom on some wonderful, wonderful pizza. I'd also give them mad props for their variety of toppings."
Kentucky,2w5xsj,vietnamted,3,Tue Feb 17 17:40:26 2015 UTC,As a photographer who frequents Red River Gorge. I try to always make this my mid-day lunch stop. Super cool vibe. During the summer you can find people from all parts of the world camping in the field out back. A real rural gem.

The ice storm we had a few years ago was far worse. I don't kentucky did much to the roads to prepare. I really don't think this storm was too bad.
Kentucky,2w4gq0,bigsexy1,3,Mon Feb 16 22:29:29 2015 UTC,"Ton of snow. Other than that, not too bad. The ice storm a few years ago wasn't too bad because it can be fixed with salts. Snow really can't. And you can't plow too easily if you live in a valley."
Kentucky,2w4gq0,Rosencrantz202,2,Mon Feb 16 22:43:51 2015 UTC,"^ yup. This small amount of fun fluffy snow has people freaking out and I just don't get it. 1993 we had something like 3 or 4 feet. Felt like 10 feet to me as an 8 year old then. That was some fun times.  It has been a bit since we've had some decent snow coverage. Now people are starting to forget our winters can suck too. Even Business and schools can't deal anymore. Just about every day this winter there are a few schools somewhere in the state closed. Lost track of how many times I've seen my local schools shut down because ""It's too cold"". Excuse me? Those buses ran fine when I was going to school in 1 foot of snow like this. They only called it off when it was icing up.   That ice storm we had a few years back. That was hell. We were without power for 6 days. I had no heat, couldn't find a generator or kerosene heater anywhere where they weren't price gouging. Then right on the last day of the outage, I broke. Rumors were going around that the damage was ever worse than what was being reported, and we may be without power for at least 1 more week. Local hardware store took great advantage of myself and some others. Paid $290 for a basic kerosene heater that sells for at best $150 any other day. But because we were freezing, they knew we would pay anything.  And I kid you not... as I'm putting it together the power came on.   No refunds of course. Still have it tho and glad I do.  It sure is pretty outside tho. :D"

It's a moist area as far as alcohol goes - so no bars or anything.  Not sure what you're looking for.  The nice thing about Etown is it is very close to Louisville and Cinci, Nashville, Indianapolis are all few hours away.

People can denigrate EKY all they want, but I know a TON of smart, capable people who had to leave and have proven they can compete and prosper anywhere. It's just a shame we couldn't stay home and do the same. I know many of them would LOVE To have been able to stay closer to home, myself included."

Kentucky,2vrwp4,-Snoopaloop-,5,Fri Feb 13 16:41:10 2015 UTC,"""Hardest Places to Live"" is pretty inaccurate IMHO.  Clay County is a pretty easy place to live.  Unhealthy? If you want to be..yes.   Uneducated?  Yup...if you choose not to get educated.  Poor?  Most definitely...work opportunities are limited.  But to characterize Clay County as a ""Hard"" place to live is silly.    The cost of living is basically as low as you can get in America.  The most traffic you will ever encounter is when the high school lets out.  Unless you are a career outlaw, you will not be murdered in Clay County.  I'd venture to guess that no one has ever been truly ""car jacked"" in Clay County.  Armed robberies and muggings do not take place in Clay County.  There are exactly 0 legitimately homeless people walking the streets in Clay County.  I will admit that drugs are a pretty serious problem in Clay County though.  Obviously if you want to rate a place as ""hard"" to live in based on the quality of life data points used in the article, Clay Co. qualifies.  But it ain't hard to live there.

The shopping has improved greatly (all though I hate to shop so I don't really give a hoot personally) and there is plenty of culture it may be Appalachian but it is here. There aren't any awesome museums of fine arts or science, I wish there were, but oh well I can travel to them no problem with the money I save living here. Plus I know all my neighbors, I know my children's friends parents, I have the convenience of a 5 minute commute, and there are no throngs of people which I hate. The biggest plus instead of paying 700,000 for a mid size home I was able to get alot of acreage and a huge place for hundreds of thousands less. It's all about perspective the world is open now more than ever, location is not what it once was. I am a lawyer because that is what I love to do, if you go to law school to get rich you're not making the right choice.  *To be fair I live in Pike Co. which is a bright spot in the region.

I've always said that Eastern Kentucky suffers by being so isolated, as in there's no simple way to get there from a major city/hub.   Most roads in your population centers in Eastern Kentucky, like Hazard, Pikeville, Prestonsburg, Paintsville, etc. are big 4 lane roads, they just don't get anywhere too quickly. They need an interstate badly. There has been a lobby for getting through Pike County that runs up to Charleston (and provide access to larger parts in Virginia) and down to Charlotte, but that's never going to happen."
Kentucky,2vrwp4,SpackleButt,2,Fri Feb 13 20:08:15 2015 UTC,I agree with you 100% on the interstate. Eastern Kentucky is one of the most beautiful places in America. If there was an interstate in this area I also think tourism would go through the roof and would help revive it.

Kentucky,2vrwp4,Teelo888,2,Fri Feb 13 19:48:42 2015 UTC,"There are a lot of people here that are calling for more government spending in eastern Kentucky. I did a fair amount of research on this specific subject last semester and wrote a paper on why eastern Kentucky is in the shape is in, and why the entire region won't improve. Here is an excerpt:   Johnson’s war on poverty helped bring forth the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC), which was established by an act of Congress in 1965. The ARC uses federal funds, targeting them in a way that will promote economic growth and opportunity. Since its inception, the ARC has spent billions of dollars on Appalachian states, with a large share going to Kentucky. The agency conducts economic reports of the region frequently, and at the time of writing, 43 of the 54 Kentucky counties that are in the jurisdiction of the ARC are still listed as economically “distressed” (Appalachian Regional Commission). Bear in mind that this is after almost 50 years of subsidies directed specifically to these counties. How much worse it would be without the ARC’s help we will never know, but it does beg the question, “Is this worth it?”   Eastern Kentucky won't improve because there are no opportunities there. They have tried building industrial parks, tried improving infrastructure and providing job training, but NOTHING WORKS. The state and federal government has spent billions of dollars in eastern Kentucky for the last 50 years! It just simply doesn't improve. I think it's time to stop with all of the extranneous Appalachian-specific welfare programs, and if you think that sounds harsh:   This has led to development of a culture that has come to rely on government assistance that is supposed to be only temporary, with 33% of eastern Kentuckians living on federal assistance- and for 41 counties, federal assistance constitutes the principal source of income.

Kentucky,2ut1eu,jjandre,5,Wed Feb 4 22:45:00 2015 UTC,"My understanding of this issue is the opposite of Mr. RhinoWaterFall's.  Small manufacturers cannot afford to have their own distribution network in every state in which they hope to sell their product.  Therefore, smaller brewing operations depend on separate distributor networks to move their product around.  Large manufacturers can afford to form their own distribution networks and deliver their products themselves.  If all of the large breweries distribute their own products, then it is not economically feasible for an independent distributor to exist.  This independent distributor could/would probably choose to deliver as much diverse product as they could (both Macro & Micro Brews).  However, there is no motivation for a distributor that is wholly owned by a large manufacturer to deliver products from micro-breweries.    I could be wrong, but I believe that the small breweries would prefer that independent distributors exist, while the major breweries could do just fine without them.  It seems to me that the consumer would be better served by having the wider selection of products that an independent distributor could provide."
Kentucky,2ut1eu,TheRealDrWan,2,Thu Feb 5 01:11:45 2015 UTC,As rhinowaterfall pointed out Rhinegeist distributes there own beer in KY. While this law could impact small breweries I don't want the Anheiser Busches of the world to run everything. What many status do is if you brew below a certain quantity then you can distribute. KY does not have this in place and I think we should encourage it.
Kentucky,2ut1eu,Suspicious_Suspicion,2,Thu Feb 5 04:25:29 2015 UTC,"Rhienegest may already distribute their own product in KY, but are they doing it as efficiently, or as widely, as they would like?  I'm not a beer connoisseur, but I don't recall seeing their product in the stores that I frequent (though I haven't looked for it).  It may be available in certain stores in Louisville, but I'm sure that they would prefer that it was available in almost every store.  It doesn't make economic sense for a small brewery to personally deliver 3-4 cases of their product to every store in KY every month.  However, an independent distributor may be more than happy to pick up 1000 cases per month from them and drop 3-4 of those off at each store along side the 100s of cases of Macro brew that they are also delivering.  A distributor that is owned by the large breweries is not going to be willing to do this.  I disagree with almost every word that comes from Stumbo's mouth, so perhaps I'm being fooled, but the quote below from the article and the fact that In-Bev is opposed to the legislation makes me think that I have the right angle on the law.   Small breweries and independent distributors — many of whom sell AB InBev’s Budweiser, Corona and Stella Artois brands — support the bill.  “Unlike independent distributors, ABInBev only distributes its own products,” says Kentuckians for Entrepreneurs and Growth, a loose confederation of breweries and distributors in the state, on its website. “This type of monopolization stifles consumer choice and market competition.”"
Kentucky,2ut1eu,TheRealDrWan,0,Fri Feb 6 01:45:38 2015 UTC,"I don't know how far Rhinegeist distributes into Kentucky. Their Kentucky distribution hub is in Erlanger and I would assume services Northern Kentucky. They are not at the size yet where they can product the volume to service both Kentucky and Ohio (they recently started selling in Columbus). Their owner just invested $250,000 in their new distribution hub. He also expects to get $30 Million in the next five years. He is also using it to distribute for other small breweries.   I would be interested in knowing how much 3rd party distributors charge or how much volume they require to take on a client. If this wasn't the case I'm sure Rhinegeist would have sold in Northern Kentucky years ago."
Kentucky,2ut1eu,Suspicious_Suspicion,3,Fri Feb 6 02:08:03 2015 UTC,"The three-tier system (producers -> distributors ->retailers) came in after the repeal of prohibition. The goal was to correct perceived abuses that came with the very close relationship between brewers and taverns. In pre-prohibition times, there were taverns known as tied-houses that through all sorts of inducements only served beer from one brewer.  Using /u/RhinoWaterFall's example of Rhinegeist, this legislation would likely put their distribution arm, Riverghost, out of business. OP's linked article concentrates on the lobbying money involved; this article from the Louisville Courier Journal gives a more complete overview: http://www.courier-journal.com/story/money/2015/01/19/kentucky-beer-distribution-battle-draws-debate/21992487/  Although the language that the bill's sponsor, Greg Stumbo (Democrat-Prestonsburg), uses tries to sound like this is a blow against large corporations, it really is an act of protectionism favoring Kentucky distributors. As written (http://www.lrc.ky.gov/record/15rs/HB168.htm), the law sees no difference between small distributors (like Riverghost) and multinational distributors (like AB InBev). The biggest losers involved would be the little guys like Rhinegeist...which would be the biggest bummer because their beer is most excellent."

Kentucky,2ut1eu,dvs-hillbilly,1 point,Thu Feb 5 07:44:22 2015 UTC,"Here's my understanding of it. Take it with a grain of salt as I may be wrong.  Right now Beer makers can also act as beer distributors. This means small guys like Rhinegeist in Cincinnati can drive their vans in to ky and distribute their own alcohol. This also means big guys like Anheauser Busch can do the same. Both companies also do this.   In most states you have to have separate beer makers, beer distributors, and beer sellers. This is a way to keep closer tabs on each aspect of it. Alcohol distributors like this because their ENTIRE business relies on it. Makers would prefer to cut out the middle man and distribute themselves."

You should be able to privately be treated for heroine, it's no ones business but you and your doctor. These drugs are stopping people from, out of pure desperation, selling their things and bodies, putting needles in them full of something that they bought off of a drug dealer. These are parents, sons, daughters, wives, husbands, sisters and brothers. If a medication can help stop them from destroying their lives and their loved ones lives, why is it so looked down on.

I have been clean accept for when I had surgery I took percocets, and when my son was born I had an epideral that contained fentynyl. My ordeal was ten years ago. So maybe I am biased, but if I had tried to go straight from black tar to some strange clinic where I would just scream alone in a bed, I would have ran, I would probably be dead now if it wasn't for methadone, and my mom getting me help when I asked her. Maybe methadone isn't right for some people, but it was right for me, and can turn addicts back into functioning people."
Kentucky,2ubl83,jackster_,2,Sun Feb 1 14:54:39 2015 UTC,"Thanks for sharing. Just out of curiosity, did you ever meet anyone for whom methadone did not work?"
Kentucky,2ubl83,waiting-for-the-sun,5,Sun Feb 1 21:17:09 2015 UTC,"Sort of, this is hard to explain, once you are on the methadone, you are now addicted to the methadone. You can do two things: taper, or maintenance. The people who either couldn't afford a long program would try to taper too quickly, and not enough of their life and routine had changed, most of them went back to using dope. Now I had quite a few acquaintances in the methadone program, most were on maintenance like me. We didn't do dope together, no one did dope (it was unnessisary)We would get together after our methadone for coffee and donuts, and talk about music and art, our lives, some of them had kids and pets and jobs. Some of them were severely disabled from shooting dope and having limbs wither away, some were disabled to begin with and took methadone because they had previous pain killer problems. It was a very diverse group of people. Now some of them ended up like me, some of them are still on the methadone, living pretty normal lives, besides the walk to the clinic, some of them are on suboxone and live really normal lives because they see a doctor once a month and take their suboxone with the rest of their medication. And some of them have passed away, from AIDS or other reasons, remnants of their needle days that would never go away, There were a few people I knew who did other drugs, besides opiates, I stayed away from them, they were usually kicked out of the program because of it. So yes, if people try to taper too fast, die, or do other drugs, then I suppose it didn't work for them. But methadone always does what it is supposed to do, at the right dose it eliminates withdrawls and cravings, allows you to have a job and family and self esteem ( things that you really can't have while constantly trying to score dope) it is isn't a cure, it's a much healthier alternative to dope, it's a lifestyle change. You wouldn't believe the art and music these people were capable of once you remove always needing to score dope from the equation. Now I have been off of methadone for almost a decade, I had to move away from where I had lived before, to make sure I wouldn't go back, I had withdrawls from the methadone, but I was equipped to deal with methadone withdrawls, I had a long time to prepare spiritually and mentally. Methadone did that for me, allowed me to prepare. So do I know people who methadone didn't work for? Sort of lol I hope I answered your question, I'm sorry for being so long winded, I am passionate about recovery, it needs to be more accepted to get that kind of help, there were junkies that were afraid of methadone because of things like ""it doesn't work for everyone"" or ""but you just trade one addiction for another"" ""then I will be on methadone for life"" and those guys are mostly dead. Another question is do you know anyone who a 12 step rehab worked for? No, I honestly do not. I know alchoholics who it worked for, but the tough love style detox, I have never seen it work, I know many people who went, and each one would come out and get right back on dope. Thanks for reading. I hope I have helped to enlighten some things."

Kentucky,2ubl83,waiting-for-the-sun,1 point,Tue Feb 3 02:57:38 2015 UTC,"I've known people who have treated opioid addiction with suboxone and methadone, respectively.  Both are widely abused by addicts, so I can see why people are not exactly pumped about treating drug addiction with drugs.  There are a lot of cases of people actually overdosing on suboxone + xanax.   I think that this risk of abuse scares people who are hoping that their loved one will recover.  I know that I've felt the disappointment when a friend tells me that they are treating with suboxone while looking at me with that same deadeyed look that all opioids give you."
Kentucky,2ubl83,-Snoopaloop-,3,Sun Feb 1 13:22:08 2015 UTC,"Well, even if it is abused, it is a safer regulated alternative to a baggy of powder, or a dirty looking glob of black tar. It is much harder to shoot up. In my educated opinion, it needs to be more available, people need to be more educated on it. People are going to use no matter what, every single junky I knew HATED that they were a junky, but it is a disease, and we need to start looking at adicts as mentally ill, not criminals. I think it's a crime to let an adict out with no tolerance, their brain tells them like its thirst and hunger and longing and more all rolled into one. Then they give in and die, because they shoot the same amount they were before or even less but it is too much. They don't deserve to die, and their families don't deserve to lose them."
Kentucky,2ubl83,jackster_,2,Sun Feb 1 15:06:16 2015 UTC,"I lost a brother-in-law to this. I almost couldn't read past the first section; it was nearly identical to his story.  I had another friend who was going through treatment for cocaine who kept repeating that I should make sure he got on Suboxone because of my friend's experience with other addicts. I try not to, but I feel a little responsibility for not trying harder."

Kentucky,2tqoo3,NumNumLobster,1 point,Mon Jan 26 18:53:59 2015 UTC,"Alaska Permanent Fund:       The Alaska Permanent Fund is a constitutionally established permanent fund managed by a state-owned corporation, the Alaska Permanent Fund Corporation (APFC).  The fund was established in Alaska in 1976  by Article 9, Section 15 of the Alaska State Constitution  under Governor Jay Hammond. From February 1976 until April 1980, the Department of Revenue Treasury Division managed the state's Permanent Fund assets, until, in 1980, the Alaska State Legislature created the APFC.   Shortly after the oil from Alaska’s North Slope began flowing to market through the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System, the Permanent Fund was created by an amendment to the Alaska Constitution. It was designed to be an investment where at least 25% of the oil money would be put into a dedicated fund for future generations, who would no longer have oil as a resource.  This does not mean the fund is solely funded by oil revenue. The Fund includes neither property taxes on oil company property nor income tax from oil corporations, so the minimum 25% deposit is closer to 11% if those sources were also considered. The Alaska Permanent Fund sets aside a certain share of oil revenues to continue benefiting current and all future generations of Alaskans. Many citizens [who?] also believed that the legislature too quickly and too inefficiently spent the $900 million bonus the state got in 1969 after leasing out the oil fields. This belief spurred a desire to put some oil revenues out of direct political control.  The Alaska Permanent Fund Corporation manages the assets of both the Permanent Fund and other state investments, but spending Fund income is up to the Legislature. The Corporation is to manage for maximum prudent return, and not—as some Alaskans at first wanted—as a development bank for in-state projects. The Fund grew from an initial investment of $734,000 in 1977 to approximately $42.1 billion as of August 31, 2012.  Some growth was due to good management, some to inflationary re-investment, and some via legislative decisions to deposit extra income during boom years. Each year, the fund's realized earnings are split between inflation-proofing, operating expenses, and the annual Permanent Fund Dividend.

Do you just move on to another campaign or do you get an appointment to secretary of bourbon or something similar?    Have you done other campaigns?
Kentucky,2tqoo3,asphalt_incline,2,Mon Jan 26 21:28:55 2015 UTC,"Oooh, interest in me? This is a new one. But yeah, feel free to ask me questions. Especially like this. A lot of people helped me along the way so I like to help others when I can.  I became a campaign manager pretty much like you would expect. I was a political science major (added a second major of communication studies along the way), started with an internship as a volunteer coordinator in a state Senate campaign, and then worked my way up through the opportunities. I love it but you have to be work your ass off - especially in the internships - but if you do, people notice pretty quickly and don't hesitate to recommend you to other people. The cliche of ""it's all about networking"" is completely true in political campaigns.  To your second question, it depends on the person. A lot of campaign staff (the famous ones you see on cable news shows) are typically hired guns. Win or lose, they move on to the next campaign. Some of them care very little about the candidate and it is simply about providing the best advice and doing the best work you can to give them the best chance to win. O  I am not a hired gun. I only want to work for candidates I believe in to some extend and with Drew, I've never believed in a candidate more. ""What happens if he is elected"" is a bit early to answer but that is up to Drew and if he wants me on his staff. I don't work for anyone I wouldn't want to work to help govern or legislate though, should they win.  And yes, I have done other campaigns.

IE would you say work a democratic campaign one year and a republican one later?    What does a day for you look like?  Is this your only campaign right now or do you do several at one time?    Is it a full time job?
Kentucky,2tqoo3,bionicjoe,2,Mon Jan 26 21:49:53 2015 UTC,"I'll answer the first question last.  Most campaign managers are partisan, some hired guns are not and will work for anyone willing to write them a check. I am pretty partisan though, so I'd only work for someone in my party on an Independent like Drew.  It is not only a full-time job, it is a full-life job. Phone is always on and loud enough to wake me up. And there really is no such thing as a typical day for me but a lot of the common stuff I am doing or will be doing involves advising Drew, making sure the staff are doing what they need to be doing, managing the schedule and lining up appearances, helping with strategy and the ""so what next?"" discussion. Generally, my job is to support Drew, advise him (or sometimes insist) on the best thing to do to improve his chances of winning, and then do what need to be done once the decision is make.  What made me believe in him? The same thing that is making people believe in him now. Listening to him. We met and talked about what was on his mind, why he was wanting to run, and what is thought he could do. He was the first candidate I've found that saw what it was suppose to be about: not a pre-packaged set of opinions but true vision and thoughtfulness in making decisions that are the best for the most amount of people. He was the first candidate I've talked to that was both thoughtful and a true independent. He talks about typically-liberal ideas  that make conservatives agree he is being reasonable and he talks about typically-conservative ideas that make liberal agree he is being reasonable. It's a rare skill (especially when it is coming from someone who is being genuine) and the direction I believe politics are going (despite how contentious things seem now.)  Quite simply, I wouldn't have moved two states away unless I was truly inspired."

If there were easy answers we'd have solved it already  In favor of equal pay for women - but I need a mechanism we can copy first.

Kentucky,2tqoo3,alishainreallife,11,Mon Jan 26 18:52:05 2015 UTC,"I understand where you are coming from, but I'm going to have to disagree a bit on the abortion thing. Abortion rights in Kentucky are already pretty endangered and likely to be further attacked. The anti-choice organizations have been campaigning pretty successfully at the state legislative level to further restrict women's rights and as a way to get around Roe v. Wade. Kentucky, specifically, has numerous TRAP laws on the books, 24 hour waiting period, and required anti-abortion state-directed counseling. And more is on the way. I'm not sure that doing nothing is really an option, and even if it was it certainly wouldn't be a desirable one."

Kentucky,2tqoo3,NumNumLobster,3,Mon Jan 26 19:52:04 2015 UTC,Drew-  I'm a Northern Kentucky resident and one of the key economic issues facing us is our infrastructure relationship with Ohio/Cincinnati.    In particular the Brent Spence bridge is way over capacity and lacks modern safety controls (like break down lanes etc).  Are you familiar with this?  Ohio has largely taken the opportunity to tack on needed high way renovations on 75 in their state to the cost and and the final plan hurts many Kentucky communities.  Both states and the feds are essentially offering no monetary support to do anything and instead insist on it being tolled.  NKY law makers have basically tied this up as it totally screws them while our current governor (and Ohio's) seem to basically want the issue to just go away.  What are you thoughts on Kentucky's infrastructure needs and how will you prioritize them and fund them?
Kentucky,2tqoo3,NumNumLobster,3,Mon Jan 26 19:14:48 2015 UTC,I really like the PPP stuff that's been tried elsewhere.  However the deal structure needs to be deeply vetted.

You will be asked these types of questions if you do wind up being successful here at debates, interviews etc.    While depending on facts, studies, and examples from other states is good practice, at some point people want someone who is going to say ""I have looked at facts, studies, and examples of other states and THIS is what I concluded"".

Kentucky,2tqoo3,GnomeChumpski,3,Mon Jan 26 23:18:17 2015 UTC,"Municipal broadband options, yeah yeah yeah whatever - let's get some god damn better internet infrastructure to the boonies. I remember reading a press release while working for my hometown newspaper better than a decade ago that Kentucky was working on high speed internet infrastructure throughout the state. Great! I guess it's still being worked on? Is it a priority for anybody?  I live in a county near Bowling Green, and my internet connection makes it feel like 1996 up in here (my neighbors are Mennonites, so it's not really a priority for them, I guess). I used to live in DFW, so I know what it's like to be able to view /r/pics without having time to bake a turkey while waiting for it to load, and I miss it. Having better rural internet access would mean work from home opportunities. I know that when I was looking for part-time work to supplement my main income, I turned down a position working for my old company by doing online transcription because I just couldn't download movie clips (and now, I work a minimum wage job for part of the year and drive 50 miles round trip to get there). I can't Skype or stream on Netflix. I'm pretty sure it's lack of job opportunity and entertainment options that contributes to the state's brain drain. I was a governor's scholar back in the 90s, and I remember the mantra well of ""Go away, get an education, and come back to Kentucky."" I think that of the six scholars from my school and the friends I made while living there, two of us are back in the state, and I'd moved away for a decade and only came home to work for the family business.  I work in a financial industry and live just on the edge of Appalachia, and I know the problems that affect my county get worse as you go east, with worse cell signal and fewer internet providers, more chronic joblessness and poverty, undertreated health problems (though hopefully the expansion of Medicaid is going to help some people with that), etc. Internet's not a magic bandaid that will fix the lives of people who can't get work and live in unheated trailers that have holes in the roof, but better/expanded high speed internet infrastructure outside of just Lexington and Louisville is going to improve education and job opportunities and make our smaller cities and larger towns more attractive to companies looking to move here.  And I guess this plea for attention to non-urban Kentucky internet infrastructure is also tied in to net neutrality, so that we won't all be losing our fat pipes to telecoms who want to charge us for every byte of data. (The only upside of having our phone line also be our internet line is that the data, a slow trickle, is free... for now.)"
Kentucky,2tqoo3,spappletrap,3,Tue Jan 27 14:18:15 2015 UTC,"Drew,  As a resident of another state that has often fantasized about someone like you doing exactly what you are, the most important question that I think can be asked here is what exactly can I do to help? (besides donating money)  I believe very much in what you're doing although I was certain that Citizen's United pretty much sealed the door on anyone ever pulling off this type of independent run.  What are you going to do when you start getting a little bit of traction and the parties at the National level put aside their differences and aim their Campaign Cash fire hoses at Kentucky to secure the status quo?"
Kentucky,2tqoo3,GnomeChumpski,3,Mon Jan 26 23:33:56 2015 UTC,"How do you feel about voting system reform? Range voting, for instance, allows each voter to score each candidate from 1 to 10 and the highest average wins. This prevents vote splitting and allows a consensus candidate to win.  Would you be willing to looking into opening the door for such things?   See http://www.rangevoting.org for more information. The guy there has written a tome on it. It focuses on content over presentation, so it is a little rough."
Kentucky,2tqoo3,spappletrap,3,Tue Jan 27 01:20:19 2015 UTC,"I really hope I'm not too late!! Something that I hold near and dear to my heart is the new SOAR initiative for Eastern Kentucky. It's apparent that the coal industry is in a sharp decline, and the economy here is hurting.  Do you have any plans for said movement?   Edit: There's also a lot I'd like to ask about Eastern KY's road infrastructure, political corruption in this state, the ACA, and many many more... but I'll wait and see for those."

Kentucky,2tqoo3,NumNumLobster,2,Mon Jan 26 19:54:29 2015 UTC,"Well yes, but as a governor you certainly have a lot of power in budgeting (cash is king) and authorizing/administering different programs.  You could certainly say dismantle or enable treatment programs or do the same for law enforcement programs aimed at combating drugs (of any type).  In the event the legislature passes any bills pertaining to the lawfulness, treatment, enforcement, or penalties regarding drugs (again of any type) you certainly have veto powers.  I am not asking what you'd unilaterally do here but I think its a fair question as to where you stand on this so voters would have a reasonable expectation as to how you would react when opportunities arise regarding this."
Kentucky,2tqoo3,megabeano,2,Mon Jan 26 20:07:24 2015 UTC,"I can tell you the governor and legislature have been for the past 6 months or so creating and passing legislation behind closed doors regarding Buprenorphine treatment (Suboxone) specifically because of the heroin epidemic in this state.    Since HB1, heroin OD deaths have increased 207%. They are aware of the problem and my opinion is, due to the regulations they've been passing in secret I have a feeling they're going to start supporting or pushing for Suboxone Clinics or they'll be assholes and try shutting them all down. (Which is likely the case; Medicaid is trying to shut down clinics that won't take it for office visits)"

If there are some types of requirements around this how does your ownership of fark play in?    maybe a stupid question but I'm just curious if there is an legal liability for you there and if so how owning fark would compare to say owning a tv station, if it even does."

Dash cam video? So many questions.  Though am slightly amused by this brilliant legal reasoning   The prosecution maintains that the officer failed to properly identify himself, an extremely plausible claim given the officer’s attire.   Judging by that website's portrayal of the event and the users' comments, I doubt they really care about the specifics anyhow"
Kentucky,2su91c,herberthunke,7,Sun Jan 18 16:31:07 2015 UTC,"Since childhood I have loved the mushy warm bun, melting into finely shredded cheese - chili goo.  Add onions and Franks hot sauce  and hold the mustard, please.  The hot dog itself isn't needed.    Whitley and Laurel counties are home to several unique spots for chili buns.  The oldest and most known are Weavers in London and the Dixie Cafe in Corbin.  Both are reliable, but in my opinion their chilis have become bland versions of what I remember.    In warm months, the Root Beer Stand in Corbin can be the ticket.  It's a cinder block building in a gravel lot.  You order from carhops who bring fresh chilled mugs of homemade root beer.   The prices can't be beat.  Dogs and burgers are still under a couple of bucks.   For adventurous eaters I recommend Virgil's Chili just south of Corbin on 25.  It's in a tanning salon so it smells like piña colladas and chili.   However the best chili bun in the area is at Whites Billiards in south Corbin.  I can't describe it except by saying it is a perfectly executed creation.   The owners are nice and there is a big sign asking patrons not to swear."
Kentucky,2su91c,justin_cornbread,1 point,Sun Jan 18 19:22:52 2015 UTC,"Can confirm that the chili at the Dixie has changed considerably. AJ Lawson, my great grandfather, created the Dixie after WWII and from I remember had the recipe in the family since before that. When he passed away in the mid-90s, the recipe never left the family. All renditions of the restaurant since have been an attempt at the original but there's always an ingredient or two missing."
Kentucky,2su91c,Notla15,1 point,Sun Jan 18 23:04:20 2015 UTC,"Justin I can confirm that White's Billiards has a pluperfect version of the chili bun. I suspect they use Mexene as their chili powder.

Visit Murray State if you get a chance, it has the most beautiful Campus in the state IMO, but I'm alum and biased. Also go out there in the fall and drive around the farm country to see the farmers smoking tobacco, there is no sight or smell like it.  Much of the River Counties are beautiful in their own right, being part of the upper delta and having a very different vibe than most of KY. So flat and delta like. Wickliffe has its cool mounds and jump over the bridge to see the Ohio run into the Mississippi. It's quite a site.   LBL is always great, I recommend Ginger Ridge for best views. Also go to Grand Rivers just to see the harbor. it's like nothing else in the state. Mantle Rock in Livingston County is beautiful and part of the Trail of Tears.  Crittenden County is Amish Country and very neat to drive around in the summer and fall (no pics). Hopkinsville (Hoptown) and Princeton have really neat downtowns and histories of the region. Earlington used to have the largest rail depot in the state. Mammoth Cave is amazing and so is driving through the Barrens in that area. It's so different.   Although I live in Lex now I lived in The Purchase for almost a decade. So BG is SOKY and not western Kentucky. Owensboro and Henderson are really cool on the river and have their own more independent identities.   You should really go for a visit sometime. If you like the Civil War go to Fort Donelson just over the TN border and Clarksville is also really close. Fort Heiman on the KY side is all but under water now I think, but there are some interesting properties that lasted from the war. The furnaces in LBL and there is even one original mansion on the blood river in Calloway County that needs to be restored. It's a straight ante-bellum plantation.   Go down there sometime, it's totally worth it."

I've also eaten at The Columbia in Tampa and while the food was okay, it was definitely a tourist spot. I currently live in Memphis and if you even mention Rendezvous to a local they will get offended. The local spot in Memphis is either Central BBQ or (in my opinion) One and Only BBQ."

All 41 no-jail counties still have an elected jailer, which in Kentucky alone is a constitutional office.  All told, the state’s 41 no-jail jailers are paid nearly $1.4 million annually for their county positions.  Most of them have little to no responsibilities.  This uneven system of no-jail jailers’ responsibilities and incomes has led some officials to suggest merging the jailer’s office with that of the sheriff in at least some of the 41 counties.  The legislature doesn't seem to have any real interest in doing anything about it."

All I can say is she is one of the most fortunate people I've ever seen to walk away with non life threatening injuries.

Shit, Harrison why trying to draw a foul later in the game and was head faking like he was actually drawing contact when he wasn't.

I know of people, mainly the older generation, who say ""sure let their be medical marijuana, but only if you're dying of cancer and on chemo"".  That is nonsense and I believe is just a way for them to say they support it, without really meaning it. It can help so many other ailments better with far fewer side effects than some RX drugs. I myself suffer from an odd form of an autoimmune disorder, with accompanying pain. Marijuana helps way more than pain killers (of which I can no longer be prescribed anyway because of the changing laws). I'm therefore forced to pay extremely high prices for low quality marijuana while risking my own freedom to simply get some relief.  If one day I can afford it, I'm moving to a state where it is legal and I'll never look back."

Although this expansion will allow for a company to lease the fiber and with a good amount of capital it could lead to fiber to your home, this move specifically won't do that.

I'd say the wife and I went through about 12-14 cases of Ale-8 this past year (which were shipped to us from the plant in Winchester throughout the year).  We've been hanging onto one case for the Holidays.  I'd drink more, but we've both cut back on soda for health reasons, plus having them shipped out here is not cost prohibitive, but it's not cheap.  They're usually ordered by family members, who have them shipped to us as gifts.  I always look around in places that sell unique, regional sodas, but I've never seen Ale-8 in WA.  I did find Cheerwine recently in Haggens Grocery. I bought one and remembered why it's not really my favorite.  Too sweet.  Bourbon is another story.....I drink a decent bit of it throughout the year.  I like beer better than hard alcohol, but will drink a few fifths during the year.  It's especially great this time of year because I like to mix it with egg nog. I've got a buddy who is a Cards fans who keeps losing bets with me on the UK-UL games....he's had to ship several 1.75's of Makers to me the last few years, which is a good deal because 'sin taxes' in WA State are through the roof."

Also, 90% of the time when a track would ""recalculate"" the odds after a race had run, then take back the winnings and redistribute them accordingly, it was through CHD, Twin Spires' parent company.   Finally, TVG was bought by Betfair a few years back, so they're now being backed by one of (if not the) largest betting corporations in the world. They've really helped TVG slowly step up in professionalism and user-friendliness.   Don't get me wrong, I hate horse racing and everything to do with it--3 years in the industry taking bets will do that to you--but if I'm going to be throwing my money somewhere, it wouldn't be at T.S."

It really depends on how bad your grades really are.   Otherwise, I second the guy who said go to BCTC for a semester, do well and then try to transfer. However, the grade-for-grade transfer option with BCTC was stopped around 2010.  So it'll be the same as any other transfer. Knockout some of the basic classes so you're not paying as much in tuition."

You can find a dirt cheap apartment right next to campus for next semester and slum lords will be begging to make a deal because otherwise their house will most likely sit empty for 8 months.  Unfortunately to get the best place you have to spend a day or two down here going through the side streets to see what's for rent.  Also going to bctc for a semester is a great way to get your feet wet, then transfer in"

Kentucky,2orofi,ricorgbldr,1 point,Wed Dec 10 12:38:52 2014 UTC,"Well, firstly, because I tend to agree with the Koch brothers on everything I've heard them say or support.  Secondly, corporate shills are no less damaging to young people than ivory tower liberal academics that are out of touch with reality.  Thirdly, I don't see much difference between someone like Charles Koch doing this than someone like George Soros doing the same thing, except from an opposite perspective.  Fourthly, conservative viewpoints are heavily underrepresented in academia, and the more the merrier, in my opinion.  As far as if the players were changed, I don't think it would be a huge problem for me intrinsically.  Obviously if someone were to try to endow a chair in anti-american studies I would be opposed to it, but because I support america, not because I am opposed to people using their money to influence others.

If a physician that prescribed Buprenorphine is a Medicaid provider at all, they must accept Medicaid reimbursement for the office visit. So many clinics are either booting Medicaid patients or they're going to turn into pill mills and try to see as many Medicaid patients as possible, to get more money.    Others (like our office) are un-enrolling from Medicaid and remaining cash only and there is good reason for this I can get to later. (You can scroll through my comment history and find a lengthy post I made in /r/suboxone I believe that goes in depth as to why many places charge cash instead of taking insurance reimbursements and why it's actually better that they do this in the long run)    The biggest issue now is that Medicaid is only going to pay for your treatment (office visit) for 1 year. After that, you're back to paying out of pocket. The big thing here is, if you go to a clinic that accepts Medicaid, once your year is up you can no longer continue at that clinic because if a physician accepts Medicaid, they cannot charge cash for the office visit. Ever. So then you're going to have to leave and find a cash only clinic, which basically make this song and dance you have to do (and the clinics have to do) a complete and utter waste of time. It's all so that Medicaid and insurance companies can get money and so the government can make it appear as if they're actually doing something to help addiction when in reality, they're not doing a damn thing but funneling money to insurance companies. THEN, once you are forced to leave the clinic and Medicaid stops paying for it, the ""statistics"" will make it seem like what they've done has really helped the problem because ""Look, tons of people are graduating from clinics"".    It's a nightmare. Not to mention, after being in treatment for 12 months, you have to be at 16mb QD or less unless you find a psychiatrist with specific credentials to support your being on more than 16mb QD. Which won't be easy."

When Samanthas car starts to pull out he stands in front of her car to try and stop her. This is where his options come in. 1) Move himself out of the way and follow the car via his copcar. Have backup try and take care of the rest of the party goers. 2) Move himself out of the way and call backup to cut off Samantha Ramseys car at the next intersection. She has had previous duis, so either way she'd rightfully serve jail time. But he opted for 3) Put himself in front of a moving vehicle that is probably being operated by a person under the influence.

You'll have to go across county lines in Corbin area for that, although you can get a drink at a few restaurants in London. There's not your typical bars here, from my understanding only restaurants can sell drinks provided a certain % of their income is in food sales so any ""bar"" you'll find is more of a restaurant than a typical bar you might be used to. Basically like an Applebee's.   There's 2 big flea markets in London and there's one (that I know of) in Corbin. There's the vendor's mall in London which is awesome! There's one in Corbin too but I haven't been there yet. If you're going to need furniture and you like antiques or upcycled stuff I'd recommend hitting the vendor's mall and there's a couple antique stores in downtown London too.

IT'S NOT AN OFFICIAL advertisement-video, just something he made for us.  You were all very kind and gave great advice, so thanks again for that! Some of you also offered to meet up, but unfortunately this was nearly impossible, because we were mostly on the countryside/driving around or had some sort of activity all day. Also, I couldn't post here, because most of the time I had no wifi.  We were in KY from 15th of September till 25th of September, for 10 days. Landed in Lexington, and had no idea what was going to happen, they didn't give us any programm or info on what we were going to do the next day. So, everyday in the morning we've had a meeting where they would inform us what our next stop was. In our group were about 30 people, 10 from Germany, 2 from the Netherlands, 2 from Hungary, 2 from Austria, 4 from England, 4 Russians and our drivers and event manager. We didn't know each other before the trip, every winner could bring one person with him. We all became friends in the end.  We started in Lexington, drove to Bowling Green, Frankfort, Olive Hill, Clear Creek, Sparta, Salt Lick, Louisville (in no particular order) and went Horseback Riding, driving through cornfields in ATVs, had barbecue with the real Rednecks (also got to taste some Moonshine!), swimming, ZipLining in a cave, Canoeing, got to see a NASCAR race with Infield-Camping... lots of stuff!  One thing I have to say is that you guys are the nicest and kindest guys on earth. We were so welcome everywhere we were going, people were very interested in us and very very open minded!

Kentucky,2mk4da,SpackleButt,8,Mon Nov 17 14:58:28 2014 UTC,It was never about the miners themselves. Politicians only care about coal because the millionaires who own the mines pay them to care
Kentucky,2mk4da,were_elephant,2,Tue Nov 18 00:34:19 2014 UTC,It's not about either of them. It's about voter manipulation.
Kentucky,2mk4da,SpackleButt,11,Tue Nov 18 03:30:10 2014 UTC,"So the auto industry in Kentucky is much bigger... in fact I would say it's a major part of our economy. And yet, you never see politicians paying auto workers lip service."
Kentucky,2mk4da,oricthedamned,5,Mon Nov 17 16:00:09 2014 UTC,"Kentucky is one of the top auto producers in the country, third only to Michigan and Ohio."
Kentucky,2mk4da,Dirty_Old_Town,3,Mon Nov 17 17:16:14 2014 UTC,"Part of the issue is that coal mining is the only industry in the eastern part of the state. When the coal jobs die off, the eastern 1/4 of Kentucky is going to wither. There just isn't another industry to fall back on out here, and that's a serious problem no one out here is willing to talk about."
Kentucky,2mk4da,MasqueRaccoon,5,Tue Nov 18 01:30:03 2014 UTC,the eastern 1/4 of Kentucky is going to wither   You say that as if it hadn't a long time ago.  The infrastructure just hasn't been there for a long time in many of those areas.
Kentucky,2mk4da,Neurokeen,1 point,Tue Nov 18 04:57:05 2014 UTC,What good is coal if everyone over there is piss-poor anyways? What difference would it make?
Kentucky,2mk4da,dkyguy1995,3,Thu Nov 20 08:27:56 2014 UTC,"It's true. Most companies don't want to build production facilities out there because of the rugged landscape and expense of infrastructure. And David Patterson's ""idea"" of giving the people a chance to leave is just as insane. It's like... what can we do to help the people of that region? There are just so many problems."
Kentucky,2mk4da,oricthedamned,2,Tue Nov 18 03:55:44 2014 UTC,"Auto production is great and all, but it does dick for the eastern half of the state. There is no other established industry."
Kentucky,2mk4da,realbabysealclubber,2,Tue Nov 18 03:13:50 2014 UTC,But regionally it is segregated. Hence the backlash.
Kentucky,2mk4da,am0x,1 point,Thu Nov 27 05:59:53 2014 UTC,"You are soooo right...cough...CashForClunkers...cough...3 Billion dollars...cough!  Also, I wonder if you have connected the dots between the high energy usage of those plants and the low energy costs provided by coal?"
Kentucky,2mk4da,Mr_Bro_Jangles,7,Wed Nov 19 19:53:38 2014 UTC,"Hypothetically, if a large corporation wanted to build a plant in Eastern KY - say Pikeville - how do you think the coal industry would respond? Would they be supportive of the general economic good that would come of it, or would they fight it because it would give their employees an alternative to mining?"
Kentucky,2mk4da,Dirty_Old_Town,2,Mon Nov 17 17:44:55 2014 UTC,What about the altech plant opening up there.
Kentucky,2mk4da,craigtussey,1 point,Tue Nov 18 02:57:54 2014 UTC,I don't know anything about it - is it up and running?
Kentucky,2mk4da,Dirty_Old_Town,2,Tue Nov 18 13:15:47 2014 UTC,"I think they'd like it. Mining as an industry isn't as labor intensive as it used to be. And a diverse economy leads to a higher standard of living. Not to mention that coal jobs are among the best paying in the state. So the lure of money can keep an employment pool full.   No one when talking about coal mining ever considers the Illinois Basin in their arguments. Why? These areas have diverse economies which means that people who aren't involved in coal get to enjoy a living as well, so people don't consider these parts of the country when thinking of the Eastern Kentucky. In reality if you're a coal operator, that's what you'd want, to stay out of sight and out of mind."
Kentucky,2mk4da,realbabysealclubber,4,Tue Nov 18 03:17:44 2014 UTC,"As someone who was born there, I can say that any business that's not WalMart, McDonalds or related to mining or the mining industry doesn't get to expand there, due to local ""zoning issues"" or ""property taxes"" or other problems that just seem to pop up. Of course the coal mine owners would oppose any competing industry; the politicians and local government officials would as well (many of them also own mines, or businesses that make money from mining, like selling mining equipment)."
Kentucky,2mk4da,antoniusmagnus,4,Mon Nov 17 20:49:39 2014 UTC,"I disagree. The reason no one invests there is because it is too isolated to ship from there. It is too far removed from an interstate system to be able to justify sending goods throughout the country. Even he Kellogs plant near Kimper is struggling, and they only have regional distribution."
Kentucky,2mk4da,realbabysealclubber,2,Tue Nov 18 03:10:07 2014 UTC,"Well, that may be the case, but more isolated towns seem to have modest variety in industry, and I know for a fact new non-coal related businesses that would employ a lot of people are actively discouraged. Lack of access doesn't explain companies like Sykes, who did IT and Tech Support, and whose business didn't depend on transport--they stayed for a few years, until they found it more profitable to move elsewhere."
Kentucky,2mk4da,antoniusmagnus,2,Tue Nov 18 03:16:03 2014 UTC,"-they stayed for a few years, until they found it more profitable to move elsewhere   Because you still have to send products there. Whether it be your IT professionals from corporate, paying managers to go there, etc.  It's really more of an Eastern Kentucky problem than a coal community problem. Beattyville recently opened a call center, and Alltech just opened a plant in Pike County, so some people are trying. It's just hard when you're facing the fact that it is hard to move product anywhere."
Kentucky,2mk4da,realbabysealclubber,1 point,Tue Nov 18 03:22:58 2014 UTC,"Other coal mining communities such as those in Western Kentucky, Illinois, and Indiana don't have a problem establishing a more diverse economic base."
Kentucky,2mk4da,realbabysealclubber,2,Tue Nov 18 03:19:05 2014 UTC,"They don't have the local obstruction, is what I'm saying. The local government there is actively discouraging competing industries."
Kentucky,2mk4da,antoniusmagnus,2,Tue Nov 18 03:40:24 2014 UTC,"But it's the SAME companies. That's what people don't get. Locally owned coal mines exist, but they're tiny and don't make anything compared to the large companies. These companies have mines in both the Appalachian Coal Fields and the Illinois Basin Coal Fields."
Kentucky,2mk4da,realbabysealclubber,-3,Tue Nov 18 12:58:24 2014 UTC,"How many indirect jobs?   Also, how many jobs at Aluminum & Steel Smelters?  Coal goes, so goes that industry."
Kentucky,2mk4da,Mr_Bro_Jangles,1 point,Mon Nov 17 16:08:41 2014 UTC,"That's a valid point. There are entire industries in the Eastern half of the state that rely on coal mining. However, that's not going to drop the cost of production. The coal situation is much more complex than coal is bad, m'kay? and honestly, it is not going to have an easy solution."

I say mostly because I can't speak for every manufacturer, but I can assume most are very similar. Nothing in the juice itself is harmful second hand.

The first thing you'll notice is how friendly the folks are, especially if you live in a smallish town or county.  You can't drive down the street without a wave.  Cash a check in a small area, they know where you live and don't need to see your driver's license.  They are major differences, sweet tea is the norm.  At Christmas, there are electric candles in every window.  There are wreaths on the doors all year long, with themes relating to the season.  At halloween, the kids are polite and sweet when they come to your door in costume.  When my husband passed away, I was giving some furniture away to a young gal that had suffered a tragic loss of her family and was going to college and needed to furnish her new apt.  Her friends told me how sorry they were about my loss and offered to do anything I needed before they left.  They moved some heavy furniture from upstairs to down so I could sell it.  I will never talk badly about California but I can admit the people here are lovely and they raise some good kids."

That's entirely their business. I would have a problem with them if they insisted that no church or authority anywhere in Kentucky could perform marriages for gay people. I suspect they would prefer that none did, but that's irrelevant to them ejecting a member for not following the tenets of the KBC."

This is a HUGE country, if you dislike your neighbors or neighborhood....FUCKING MOVE to an area that is better suited to you. Why can't everybody just STOP trying to push your beliefs down everyone else throat?? How about this, if you want gay friendly churches, start your own fucking sect. Goddamn I get tired of this stupid shit, I wish I could avoid it, but it's smeared across headlines nationwide. I'm probably the most intolerant person on this shitfuck website, but if there's something I hate more than race, religion, politics, shitty government, big brother, ecological bankruptcy, and liars, it's this...BULLSHIT. AND this right here is just that, a bunch of fucking bullshit. In Appalachia, if two members of a church disagree on something, say Biblical interpretation, they don't fight and feud over it, one member will find out who is with them and they will build their own fucking church down the street and worship there. Nobody gets hurt and everyone is happy to fellowship with likeminded people. As an Appalachian, we may be simple, but son of a whore if simple ain't the best way. I don't have to accept a fucking thing about this society of degradation we live in, and you don't have to accept my backwards hillbilly ways.

The Rockcastle empties into Lake Cumberland close to a spot called Bee Rock campground (you can find it on Google maps & park there).  From there you can head upstream on the east side of the river.  Not much traffic due to the lack of loops, but you can pick up the sheltowee trace on the way back to add a little mileage.   It's along the same escarpment as the red river gorge,  so the terrain and scenery are similar.  Not sure where you are,  but it's a little over 2 hours from louisville."

That's where you'd meet the people your wife is worried about. I'm as atheist and liberal as one can get, and the most trouble I've had with religious folks here is an old guy giving me the finger as he almost ran me over pulling into a church I was walking past one day.   Having a moderately large liberal arts college doesn't hurt much, either - the student population, I've found, is definitely a little more liberal than the average for Kentucky. Mitch McConnell did win Warren County, though. :/  All in all, it's not a bad little place.

Kentucky,2lsev6,am0x,2,Mon Nov 10 03:20:31 2014 UTC,Not being religious wont cause you problems in and of itself.  I live in rural north eastern Kentucky and plenty of people do not go to church.  You may be asked where you go and invited to services but it will generally be polite.  I cannot speak to BG area directly about this but if it is like much of the rest of the state there is something that can give you social trouble and it is likely the root cause of a lot of folks bad experiences.  That is making comparisons between here and where you came from that imply you think things were done better where you left.  Native Kentuckians tend to be proud of their home state and are well aware of the stereotypes other folks have of us.  If you give the impression that you think you are now surrounded by dumb hicks then you will have a hard time making friends.  In general just be polite and you will get along fine.  PS.  Kentucky loves guns.  Texas thinks it is the king of loving to shoot stuff but they are wrong.  The area you are moving to is close to one of the worlds largest shooting sports centers.  Even the majority of our democrats are very pro gun.  If you to meet people and start with a good impression taking up shooting sports and hunting is a good bet.

Kentucky,2lkwdm,realbabysealclubber,11,Fri Nov 7 14:18:15 2014 UTC,"This may actually speed up the process of full federal recognition of same gender marriages.  Last September Ginsberg said that the Supreme Court was waiting for a circuit court split on the matter. All the other federal courts have ruled to overturn gay marriage bans, all of them citing the 2013 Supreme Court decision that struck down the ban on federal recognition of same gender marriages, on the grounds that this violated equal protection and due process.  Now that one federal court has ruled to uphold such a ban, the Supreme Court will have to get involved sooner rather than later. And given their previous ruling, they probably aren't going to rule in favor of the ban. It's very likely that we'll see full federal recognition of same gender marriages, in all 50 states, sometime between now and the end of the Supreme Court's term in June/July."
Kentucky,2lkwdm,tgjer,4,Fri Nov 7 17:04:29 2014 UTC,I'm so nervous about it going the wrong way
Kentucky,2lkwdm,FunnOnABunn,5,Fri Nov 7 17:48:12 2014 UTC,"It's possible, but probably pretty unlikely.   The Supreme Court could refuse to hear the appeal on this case, which would mean gay marriage remains banned in Kentucky, Tennessee, Ohio and Michigan, but wouldn't affect other states. But at least from what Gisnberg has been saying, I don't think they'll do that. With different federal courts ruling different ways, the Supreme Court needs to step in an make a decision.  And just last year the Supreme Court ruled that part of the ""Defense of Marriage Act"" that banned the federal government from recognizing marriage contracts held by same gender couples was unconstitutional. That case only applied to the federal government, which is why it didn't immediately apply to state bans too, but it seems unlikely that they'll rule differently now."
Kentucky,2lkwdm,tgjer,2,Fri Nov 7 17:54:25 2014 UTC,"So it's a question of whether or not the Supreme Court thinks it's the states' right to decide who can get married?  If they decide not to hear it, it's essentially the same thing as ruling it's up to the states, except that future justice's would be able to hear a case.  Is that right?"
Kentucky,2lkwdm,FunnOnABunn,3,Fri Nov 7 17:56:47 2014 UTC,"The Supreme Court ruled in 1967 that marriage is a basic civil right, when they struck down all state bans on interracial marriage. At the time these laws were overwhelmingly supported by voters - but it didn't matter. The supreme court ruled that it was unconstitutional to withhold this basic civil right from a minority population, even if the majority of the population wanted to do so.  States can't make arbitrary rules about who can or can't get married. The 5th Amendment's Equal Protection and Due Process clauses require that the law treat citizens the same unless a specific pragmatic reason can be shown why they shouldn't. E.g., a 16 year old can get a drivers license while a 6 year old can't, for the pragmatic reason that a 6 year old couldn't drive safely. But if a state tried to pass a law saying green eyed people couldn't get a drivers license, that would be unconstitutional because the law has no actual pragmatic reason for this ban.  Marriage bans work the same way. In order for the ban to be constitutional, the state has to show that there are specific, practical reasons why only opposite gender couples should have access to this legal contract. And the Supreme Court ruled in the 2013 DOMA decision that no such practical justification exists."
Kentucky,2lkwdm,tgjer,1 point,Fri Nov 7 18:05:55 2014 UTC,"In order for the ban to be constitutional, the state has to show that there are specific, practical reasons why only opposite gender couples should have access to this legal contract.   You're probably aware of this, but it's actually slightly more involved than that.  There are various considerations that determine how strong the arguments in favor of discrimination have to be for it to be constitutional.  Under the weakest standard, the state has to do very little to justify their laws.  The precise way this should all work out is pretty controversial, though, and relevant rulings in the past have not been very consistent with each other.   And the Supreme Court ruled in the 2013 DOMA decision that no such practical justification exists.   The DOMA ruling is a little bit incoherent: Kennedy talks about equal protection and due process, but he also makes a federalism argument, that the federal government should respect the states' marriage laws.  He doesn't make it clear which of these arguments were necessary to arrive at the outcome, presumably on purpose to avoid sending a clear message on whether state bans are constitutional.  The equal protection and due process arguments apply in exactly the same way to state laws, but the federalism argument goes in the other direction, suggesting that the courts should give deference to the states."
Kentucky,2lkwdm,Mgye,1 point,Sat Nov 8 01:37:41 2014 UTC,"If they don't hear the case, all of the circuit court rulings stay in place.  So same-sex marriage would be up to the states in some states (Kentucky, Ohio, Michigan, Tennessee), mandated by the Constitution in others (California, Virginia, Kansas, Indiana, and many others), while in the remaining states the question would remain unanswered until the lower courts there decide it.  Clearly this outcome would be problematic and unpopular with just about everybody, so hopefully the Supreme Court wouldn't be stupid enough to choose it.  If they do hear the case, the most likely outcome is that they will make a sweeping ruling requiring all states to recognize same-sex marriage... however it's not like they haven't surprised everyone before when it comes to SSM cases.  They could conceivably rule that SSM is up to the states, in which case many states that currently recognize SSM would stop doing so.  Or they could find some procedural issue or an excuse to rule narrowly, so that the case would have a very limited outcome (perhaps just applying to one state or to couples in particular circumstances), leaving the central question open for a later case to decide.  Under any of these scenarios, it would be possible for the Supreme Court to take up another case and rule differently in the future, though I imagine if we get to the point where same-sex marriage is legal throughout the country, it will quickly become viewed as a settled issue."

Kentucky,2lkwdm,leo_jones,5,Fri Nov 7 14:23:26 2014 UTC,"Yeah, it sucks for now, but this has some potential to turn into a positive.

This could be the final case that pretty much sets up the last 18 states to recognize gay marriage."
Kentucky,2lkwdm,Kart0ffel,2,Fri Nov 7 14:25:36 2014 UTC,"Wasn't there a measure a couple years ago in CA to ban gay marriage that got overturned by the supreme court?  If so, I could see the supreme court using that previous ruling as justification to overturn the law here state side."

Not the thousands of people obsessed with building a new basketball arena in Lexington while businesses avoid us like a coal-stained plague?  I do like one Democrat in Kentucky: Greg Fischer, Louisville's mayor. He has overseen a bustling growth in the downtown area, new hotels, new businesses, with more on the way. Louisville is the steam engine pulling this train wreck of a state. We don't need to be looking to D.C. to save us. We need to look for solutions here."

Kentucky,2lbxug,Seanatronic,1 point,Wed Nov 5 15:13:57 2014 UTC,"The height of idiocy? Really? Seems a bit of a stretch. From the ""idiots"" perspective we elected a senator who has served us well for the past 30 years and now Kentucky has the largest voice in the senate with him as leader. If you think it's so obvious he didn't serve us well do you really want to elect someone who couldn't even show it? Just take a step back and realize that you'll get to vote him out in 6 years."
Kentucky,2lbxug,WhosJoeDaddy,6,Wed Nov 5 16:22:14 2014 UTC,"Correct the highest position in the senate, but he has stopped caring about the state. It is all party politics at this point. He put forth no agenda for the state. His campaign was this: ""Grimes. Obama. Grimes. Coal. Obama. Obama.""    Not that ALG was a much better choice, but Mitch has helped make partisan politics even worse. This has been his closest challenge, and even then it hasn't been a wakeup call that he needs to change and that there are a LOT of people unhappy with him. So great. Our state is now known for continuously electing someone who is only looking to further his party, not the state, and will do nothing but try to undermine anyone who disagrees."

And yes, the rest of the country does send Republicans to D.C. but the thing is that they usually aren't shitty circus clown ones like you'd find in a state like Kentucky.

No other details are provided.""   ""Senator McConnell has voted against numerous bills and amendments that propose to raise taxes on the wealthiest Americans or to close loopholes.""   These are standard Democrat talking points.  For the 3rd district Congressional race, they got a response from the Independent candidate:  ""I support a low flat tax. A flat tax is a fair tax.""  And then added their own commentary:  ""Fact check: Studies of many flat tax proposals show that they benefit wealthy Americans more than lower-income taxpayers.""  The Republican did not respond, so the site added this:  ""Record Check: MacFarlane does not address this question on his campaign website. About taxes, he writes; “The best kind of tax is low, flat, and fair.” ""  ""Fact Check: Studies of many flat tax proposals show that they benefit wealthy Americans more than lower-income taxpayers.""

I'm not sure where it can be gotten, but the list of registered voters are public, so on the less nefarious side, they can mark off all who vote so they can call their supporters who haven't voted in order to get them to the polls too"
Kentucky,2l02iv,Teelo888,1 point,Sat Nov 1 22:23:51 2014 UTC,There will indeed be challengers at every precinct in Kentucky. McConnell will have one at every polling location and Grimes will have challengers at most polling locations.  The purpose of the challengers is to make sure there is no fraudulent voting. McConnell's team will also have an attorney at every polling location as well.

Kentucky,2kzx7g,Christina_Marie,4,Sat Nov 1 19:32:01 2014 UTC,other poster is right.  you can register now or later for the next election though. Primaries are May 2015. The second to last Tuesday in May I believe
Kentucky,2kzx7g,Christina_Marie,5,Sat Nov 1 22:02:07 2014 UTC,This is correct. Don't let the fact that the deadline to register for Tuesday's election has passed stop you from registering at all.
Kentucky,2kybtl,pateras,8,Sat Nov 1 04:32:47 2014 UTC,McConnell continues that there is no lie he will not tell. There is no tactic he will not use. McConnell continues to demonstrate that he is lower than a Rattle Snake in a wagon rut. This type of scum has no business in the U.S. Senate. VOTE

Kentucky,2kybtl,Smellivision,3,Sun Nov 2 18:46:38 2014 UTC,"Well fortunately you don't get to decide who votes and who doesn't. There isn't, and shouldn't be, a law that says only people that are smart can vote.    People are stupid. They will vote and it doesn't negate this tactic he's using or make it less dirty.    Interesting how all your comments on this sub are in support of McConnell, attacking democrats and then when this topic is brought up, instead of condemning his tactics, you resort to call people who would fall for his tactics, basically, morons who shouldn't vote.    Proving that you're likely one of those straight ticket voters who has never voted for anyone outside of the Republican Party in your life."
Kentucky,2kybtl,fuzio,3,Sun Nov 2 13:55:46 2014 UTC,"Your comments show how little you pay attention.  Pointing out the faults of 'your' candidate does not mean I endorse the turtle.  The majority of contributors to this sub have covered his failings.  I've stated repeatedly I have no love for either horse ('s ass), rather I'm voting for Patterson in spite of him being a cop.  Your accusation of blind allegiance to a party or ticket is misguided, at best.  The hilarity in which she's run her campaign (if you can really call it that) is fun to point out.  No more, no less.  I rarely vote for either major party.  Can you say the same?  I've moved way past R and D, but it seems you're stuck there.  Good luck with that.  If you think either of them have your best interests at heart, I have some beachfront property in Arizona you might be interested in.  If you read my comment, and didn't allow your blinders to get in the way, you would've seen I said I would feel the same way if Grimes campaign had done the same thing.  I also did not call for a law that limits people's voting rights.  But, since your reading comprehension and retention is so low, perhaps we'd all be better off if you stayed home on Tuesday, too."

Kentucky,2kx2hp,BuckDunford,1 point,Fri Oct 31 22:21:57 2014 UTC,"Its honestly interesting how he is in the running still. He has put forth no agenda. Its just ads of ""Obama Grimes this"" and ""Obama Grimes Obama that."" I was back home in Hopkinsville (live in Louisville) for a day and took some time to drive neighborhoods and look at political signs. I only ever saw one Mitch sign in a county that is incredibly red. There were several houses with all the other local republican candidates, but no Mitch. To me it feels like a LOT of people are just going to skip over this race. And what is so shameful is Mitch doesn't see this close race as a call to action that he needs to reevaluate the work he does for the state. It is all about HIS agenda and his agenda alone. I am not hugely in favor of Grimes, but at least she puts forth some sort of agenda."
Kentucky,2kx2hp,Semper-Fido,-2,Sat Nov 1 05:44:04 2014 UTC,"Let's just be real honest here for a minute.    Half the reason the GOP has the support is does is...religion. Without their constant shouting about jesus this, abortion that and same-sex marriages the GOP would likely lose the vast majority of their support; especially in the rural towns and cities because their policies aren't helping anyone in truly small town America.    If that were the case, wouldn't KY be in good shape by now? All of these ads are constantly talking about the clout that McConnell has, how he can fight against Obama and the Democrats, how he can allegedly do all of these wonderful things if he's re-elected...    Okay....so where the hell has he been for the past 30 years? Why is he just now saying ""Oh look at all this stuff I will do or can do but haven't yet"".    I am honestly stunned at how moronic people are if they think McConnell, after 30 years, is going to actually do anything for this state. Are we truly in better shape as a state? Are we improving or falling backward?    Continuing to elect the same man into office despite KY continuing to slip down the charts...what the hell is wrong with people.    I don't love Grimes either but she's a hell of a lot better than McConnell."

We sure didn't run up the deficit under a Republican run government. That totally didn't happen."
Kentucky,2kmiw5,Seanatronic,0,Wed Oct 29 16:19:10 2014 UTC,"We need to get that tax money back to everyone, since a huge chunk of stuff the feds do isn't really their business, and everyone would be better off with more money in their pocket.  If you are really concerned about low wages, why raise the minimum wage?  Why not do something that incentivizes employment, like wage subsidies, rather than something that disincentivizes it, like minimum wage laws?"
Kentucky,2kmiw5,mlbontbs87,0,Wed Oct 29 16:22:28 2014 UTC,"well gosh wage subsidies sounds like one of those handouts you people hate so much. you would rather a person be more dependent on a govt subsidy to live than on their employer? and since youre in the party of ""OMG THE DEFICIT"" I don't see how more tax breaks will help us solve that. Unless we take tax breaks from the rich, but Im sure youll say that will hurt jobs too.  of course this is ignoring that fact that if minimum wage went up with inflation it would be about $10 an hour, which is far from unreasonable."

Kentucky,2kmiw5,Seanatronic,4,Wed Oct 29 21:23:22 2014 UTC,"I hate Mitch, always have even when I was a ""Young Republican"" but I agree Grimes is not very good of a canindate, but it comes down which would you choose. I take having an decent option of health care choices (including some damn good co-opt programs) expanded coverage for people can't afford health care (medicaid expansion), and maybe someone who will some ok policies on the economy, than a true empty suit who bows to whatever the party wants at that moment. Mitch has no plans going forward, and only can say ""Obama bad, coal good"" and can't answer what the republican party will do with a majority because they know damn well Obama will veto everything that they have campaigned on (Obamacare, privatizing social security, etc) so they just go back to hey did I mention my opponent likes Obama? So it's an empty suit I don't like to an empty suit with a shiny light on it. I like shiny lights."
Kentucky,2kmiw5,mwatwe01,-1,Wed Oct 29 02:47:39 2014 UTC,"Grimes wants to raise the minimum wage and doesn't make poor people look like moochers. Mitch, on the other hand, will never raise the minimum wage while at the same time saying low wage workers just aren't trying hard enough. Republican hypocrisy at it's finest."
Kentucky,2kmiw5,mlbontbs87,2,Wed Oct 29 02:57:35 2014 UTC,"I agree with Mitch.   Raising the minimum wage sounds nice until you look at the numbers. It would only affect those people in entry level jobs, where one would not expect to be able to support oneself entirely anyway. It would force employers, already squeezed by taxes and a struggling economy, to pay wages not in line with the work produced, thus forcing them to lay off people.  If Grimes wants to raise the minimum wage so much, why doesn't she first convince her father's restaurant to raise their pay above minimum wage to act as an example? That's hypocrisy."
Kentucky,2kmiw5,Seanatronic,3,Wed Oct 29 14:18:32 2014 UTC,"It would only affect those people in entry level jobs,   It would also affect those who are looking for entry level jobs, but can't find them anymore because employers can no longer afford to gamble on them."
Kentucky,2kmiw5,mlbontbs87,0,Wed Oct 29 14:29:35 2014 UTC,"Kinda funny how raising it before didn't ruin the economy. But then you would have to actually study history to know that, and not just spew what Fox News and Mitch are telling you."

Kentucky,2kmiw5,Seanatronic,0,Wed Oct 29 16:09:53 2014 UTC,"Oh wait, you probably hate food stamps too. It's ok, you don't get it.   Food stamps are fine, for a time, for those who need it. If someone is just getting started in life, or they've gone through some serious life changing event (divorce, job loss), then I agree we should help.   But if someone is still making minimum wage and/or on assistance 10 years later, I think we need to question their life choices."
Kentucky,2kmiw5,mwatwe01,0,Wed Oct 29 16:03:29 2014 UTC,"yea we definitely need to make people starve to make them learn their lesson. i mean how dare they not afford a college education that costs way too much? the audacity of poor people really irks me too man. /s  You're just another person who fails to recognize the change in our economy, and how service jobs are now worked mostly by adults and many of them have kids. Of course I guess we could prevent kids with insurance covered birth control, but your party is against that too. Republicans have no real answers.  And you admitted the economy is struggling, and you are voting for a guy who has wanted to cut food stamps. Poor people aren't always poor by choice. Quite the opposite. It's ok though, I don't expect you to understand how Republican policies go against the solutions they supposedly want.  and let's not forget that people who are uneducated work low wage jobs, and Republicans hate funding public education. They want it all private so their rich buddies can make money off of it."
Kentucky,2kmiw5,Seanatronic,1 point,Wed Oct 29 16:16:47 2014 UTC,"A few things:   yea we definitely need to make people starve to make them learn their lesson.   I don't recall saying that. If someone is need let's help them. But at some point, we need them to get things in order.   i mean how dare they not afford a college education that costs way too much?   So that's the only way to get a job and support oneself? Can people not go to trade schools or join the military? There are lots of scholarships and funds for those willing to work or them.   Republicans have no real answers.   None that liberals like, anyway.   a guy who has wanted to cut food stamps.    Cut, not eliminate. There's a difference.   Poor people aren't always poor by choice.   In my experience, people aren't poor by choice. But they are poor by their choices. At a minimum, if you stay in school, work hard, stay off drugs and alcohol, and don't procreate outside of marriage, you can make it.   Republicans hate funding public education.    Since when? I'm fully in favor of public education. Americans get a free education through 12th grade, thanks to property taxes, which I am happy to pay.  Please stop building these evil republican strawmen. Republicans believe in the inherent worth and value of all people and their ability to excel, if given the chance and motivation."
Kentucky,2kmiw5,mwatwe01,0,Wed Oct 29 16:20:04 2014 UTC,"ah yes, the military, the last resort of poor people everywhere.   If you're born into a poor family, odds are you will be poor. Just how the world works. Plus social mobility is at it's lowest point in a long time.  Sorry, when i said Republicans are against public education I should have said ""Republican politicians."" I mean, you DO vote for them but still.  You should read your party's platform sometime.   http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/post/gop-platforms-contempt-for-public-education/2012/08/29/b8e83a96-f16d-11e1-892d-bc92fee603a7_blog.html  http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/post/what-gop-platform-says-on-education/2012/08/28/4b993bce-f15a-11e1-892d-bc92fee603a7_blog.html#pagebreak  They want everything to be up to the private sector, so that they can profit off of it. Plain and simple. That's why Republican love vouchers so much. It's also why UPS and FedEx gives Republicans so much money, so that they can be convinced to get rid of the USPS and then FedEx and UPS can profit off of it. And both education and the mail are an example of how much Republicans hate unions.  So you just have to ask yourself, what parts of our society are you ok with being profitable to the wealthy? That's what Republicanism is all about these days.  EDIT: And don't procreate outside of marriage? The GOP is the party of abstinence, which as we have seen time and time again doesn't work. So Democrats try to make birth control cheaper for women(so they can go to college without having a kid to support) and Republicans are against it. Fact. I don't have to build any strawmen, you just have to know how your politicians vote and what the party platform is.  EDIT 3: Don't ever say ""in my experience"" because personal analogies aren't a valid argument. So you know poor people who are poor by their choices? good for you, because there are way more that aren't.  Have a good day."

Your comment about property taxes made me remember something. The town I'm from has a great school system because of high property taxes. Its a conservative city in Northern KY. Last time a tax increase came to a vote, it barely passed because it was parents voting against parents who no longer had kids in school and felt they shouldn't have to pay more.

I looked at a few of the ballots for my county, and things like school board and city races made them different. Most of the items were identical though. I figured out which would be mine since I know what races are up for my precinct. My county didn't have 31 ballots to look through though, so that was easier.   Hope you can figure out which one is yours, so that you can make an informed decision at the poll."

Kentucky,2k3b53,profstenny,1 point,Tue Oct 28 22:08:04 2014 UTC,There is nothing wrong with the existence of a distributor who serves small brewers.  The problem is when all brewers are legally obliged to use a third-party distributor.    Not mandating something by law is not equivalent to banning it.

I blame the abuser. The abuser in my family has no accountability and that is what the problem is. It's always somebody else's fault. ""If this didn't happen or that didn't happen, blah, blah.""

Kentucky,2jydb3,SpackleButt,7,Wed Oct 22 11:32:06 2014 UTC,"I think the suit in this case is that they knew it was habit-forming and easily modifiable into an abusable form while their marketing was saying exactly the opposite. The cigarette companies knew that cigarettes cause cancer, and said nothing. If a company knows their product is dangerous and does nothing, courts tend to look down upon that."
Kentucky,2jydb3,fuzio,3,Wed Oct 22 13:19:48 2014 UTC,"and that is what the problem is. It's always somebody else's fault.     That's not the problem. That is a mindset that is created as a result of addiction.    Yes, they make a decision to use the medication (either legally or illegally) for the first time. However, no one chooses to become addicted.    Not to be an ass but just because you have an addict in your family does not (and a lot of people believe it does) qualify you as an expert on the topic.    EDIT: I will say that I agree with you in regards to, it's not the manufacturer's fault people became addicts and in turn, broke laws or committed crimes but that's not necessarily what this suit claims.     The Kentucky action claims that sales representatives misled doctors and others into believing that OxyContin didn’t produce a “buzz” and was less addictive than shorter-acting drugs. It alleges the company concealed information about the dangers of OxyContin. The 12 claims against the company include Medicaid fraud, false advertising, creating a public nuisance, and unjust enrichment     If that's the case, I fully believe they can (and should) be held liable. Sales Reps lie and say shit all the time. I work for a substance abuse treatment facility specializing in opioid dependence. (just to provide some details as to my connection to the topic at hand)"

Kentucky,2jc6vy,pateras,7,Wed Oct 15 18:02:29 2014 UTC,So this statement would not be rated four Pinocchios?
Kentucky,2jc6vy,Dirty_Old_Town,8,Wed Oct 15 20:20:04 2014 UTC,"Correct me if I'm wrong, I'm not experienced in economics. But if the minimum wage is raised very high in the entire country (like how everyone wants) wouldn't it offset our current economy? I mean, wouldn't the price of goods and the average cost of living end up raising to sort of counteract the higher wages?"
Kentucky,2jc6vy,Fried_Snicker,4,Thu Oct 16 02:03:33 2014 UTC,What has happened in other areas with increased minimum wage is that businesses make up the cost in increased volume.  People who are paid more can afford more so they buy more.
Kentucky,2jc6vy,guru42101,5,Thu Oct 16 13:13:03 2014 UTC,"As an economics student, I'll give it a shot. A business' costs are a function of capital (buildings, land, equipment etc) and labor (people that work there). So for some businesses (majority of jobs are salary and majority of hourly jobs pay above $10.10, mostly service industry will be affected), raising the minimum wage will increase labor costs which must be balanced out either by reducing capital costs or other labor costs or as you mentioned, passing it on to the consumer by raising prices. Important to note that any wage increase will be staggered over a few years to allow businesses to adjust so it's not a shock. Now we are a capitalist country, competitive markets keeps prices low. ""Kroger raised price of bread? Fuck that, I'll go to Meijer."" So, price increases will be the last resort of most businesses after reducing capital, other labor costs, and hours of those whose wages increased. All this to say, will prices increase? Probably but in almost negligible amounts not too different from inflation. Now when put in this way, it can be viewed as the government subsidizing labor costs with need-based welfare. Using conservative buzzwords, a vote for raising the minimum wage is a vote for reducing government spending and privatizing welfare costs. But I'm a filthy goddamn liberal so take it with a grain of salt. If you're interested in more stats, Louisville's congressman Yarmuth has a bunch including 92% of Kentuckians on min. wage are over the age of 20, ~25% have children, majority are women."
Kentucky,2jc6vy,RealGoodBub,2,Thu Oct 16 03:43:00 2014 UTC,"Either businesses would reduce the base of employees or raise base product prices to offset the increase in pay of their bottom level workers. If they reduce their workforce they will overburden existing employees, and if they pass the price along to the consumer than the rise in minimum wage will be diminished (not eliminated) so raising minimum wage would alleviate some problems but overall it is a band-aid to a much larger issue. Thats my very basic econ 2 cents."

Fun fact: it hasn't ruined us all the other times we raised it. And it doesn't get raised as much as the pay of people in Congress. It makes so sense to have a minimum wage that when you work 40 hours a week, you still have to be on government assistance. So the business gets the benefit of paying their workers a poverty wage(full time) and the taxpayers get screwed because that worker has to go on government assistance to survive.  So Republicans, which will it be: make the minimum wage a fair wage, or continue to allow people on government assistance. Republicans are against both of these things, and it just shows how much they bow down to their corporate masters at the expense of millions of people."

His view, and his doublespeak designed to keep voters confused and uninformed, is diametrically opposed to the best interests of the country."

Kentucky,2j93l8,mwatwe01,10,Wed Oct 15 10:18:44 2014 UTC,"How is Kynect not a branch of Obamacare? A majority of those who found coverage through Kynect did so through the Medicaid expansion. You literally cannot have the success of Kynect without the provisions of the Affordable Care Act. It is like saying ""The website can stay up, but the links will be broken and you won't actually be able to use it."" McConnell is intentionally obfuscating the fact that the two are one in the same because one word is popular among voters and the other has ""Obama"" in it."
Kentucky,2j93l8,festizian,-2,Wed Oct 15 14:22:13 2014 UTC,"It all about the intent of the Constitution. If a state wants to implement a program, that's fine. But we should be wary about implementing new federal programs, and forcing them on all the states."
Kentucky,2j93l8,mwatwe01,5,Wed Oct 15 16:39:19 2014 UTC,"The problem is that federal programs that rely on redistribution of wealth don't work nearly as well when you scale them down.  Now, you're well within your rights to argue that no government shouldn't intervene to redistribute wealth, but that's a more fundamental topic that I'm not going to try to argue against.  The various state taxation laws, which inevitably lead to some states being more ""tax-friendly"" to the wealthy than others, lead to an inequal distribution of wealth among the states.  Geographical factors also play a role - a disproportionate number of the wealthy live in metropolitan ares, say Los Angeles or California.    Delaware is the obvious outlier here - due to its status as a corporate tax haven, the state only receives around 30 cents back from federal spending for every dollar of revenue it generates.  That's a state that can clearly afford to employ a wealth-distributing system like the ACA. At the opposite end of the spectrum, we have states like South Carolina, which take in over $5 for every $1 sent to the federal government.    Without implementing these programs at the federal level, wealth stays unequally distributed throughout the country, which is exactly what programs like Medicaid are designed to address.  The argument about ""original intent"" by the framers of the Constitution is a valid one, and can't be entirely dismissed, but pushing the issue back to a state's rights issue means you must accept that the entire idea of redistribution of wealth in the US is unworkable on a broader scale."
Kentucky,2j93l8,WizardTrembyle,-3,Wed Oct 15 18:56:33 2014 UTC,"Without implementing these programs at the federal level, wealth stays unequally distributed throughout the country   As a conservative, all I can say is ""Good"". I don't believe in redistribution of wealth, especially at the federal level, where bloat and bureaucracy reign. What works in California may not work in Kentucky may not work in Maryland."
Kentucky,2j93l8,mwatwe01,4,Wed Oct 15 19:38:10 2014 UTC,"My point was that if you accept beforehand that we should implement social welfare programs on a population-wide scale, they simply can't and don't work on a state-by-state piecemeal level without the support of federal income tax redistribution, unless you're willing to have people in state A fundamentally worse off than those in state B.     The point of implementing these policies at the federal level is to even out the gap between not only rich people and poor people, but rich states and poor states.  I understand we fall on opposite sides of the underlying issue, though, whether we should be doing it or not, just wanted to defend why it's a federal solution and not a state's rights issue in my eyes."

To provide affordable insurance to people who could not afford it otherwise.  It's not ""just a website"" like McConnell  wants you to believe.  It also includes expansion of Medicaid (which is also ran by private insurance companies in KY) prevents companies from discriminating against you for having a preexisting condition or owning a vagina, and allows people to get preventive care and keep you from getting sick in the first place, rather than waiting to the last minute and going to the hospital every time you get near death.

I thought it was a little confusing you'd ask that, though. Your real question makes way more sense.  I'll be voting for Grimes. McConnell has proved over and over that the needs of Kentucky take a backseat to partisan politics and agenda. McConnell cares more about saving his party and his own reputation than about what Kentucky wants or needs.   Some say Grimes is the same way, but I'm not sure we can accurately say that until she has time in office to prove herself one way or another. Maybe she'll fall into the same trap, but we don't actually know for sure yet, and I think its worth it to give her a chance.  Other people would say why take that chance with Grimes, who belongs to a mainstream political party and will therefore probably fall into that trap, when you could vote for the libertarian candidate. Well, that's easy for me to answer--I'm not a libertarian. In fact, I am the polar opposite of a libertarian. I am a socialist. Politically, I'd MUCH rather have a democrat in office than a libertarian.

Coal mines were shutting down 20-30 years ago when I was a kid, and it just keeps going. The main reason all the coal jobs are being lost is that the easy-to-mine coal is running out. It's getting harder and harder to mine, so empty mines close down and no new ones open, which of course leads to lost jobs. Sure, the EPA regulations on water quality when doing mountaintop removal mines are hurting some mines, making it harder to get to the already difficult to mine seams, but there hasn't been a significant change in the number of coal mining jobs in KY since Bill Clinton was president. Under Clinton, the number leveled out instead of the massive declines from 1983 until mid-way through his presidency.  You want to know the other real issue? Wyoming. Wyoming produces nearly 4 times the coal with less than 1/2 the workers vs KY. They're doing it with bigger, newer machines, all under the EPA regulations, and making money hand over fist."

The problem was the deep south had cheaper labor, and our local businesses took their toys and went south. Now people are making at or less than the exact same workers were making years ago (even though inflation has went up 10 fold since then) and there are less and less jobs. None of this had to do with regulations as this happened under Ford, Reagan, Bush Sr, Bush Jr, as well as Carter, Clinton, Obama. Actually (in great irony for how red the area is [should note I am talking about my home area]) the times when the jobs have grown and income went up were under Carter and Clinton, and if we compare to 2006, under Obama.

I have worked for over a hundred different coal companies in eight East Ky counties.  While you are right about job loss due to machines and also about coal being a finite resource, a lot of mining companies have gone under and resources made unmineable due to EPA regulations pulmagated since Lisa Jackson was made EPA administrator. Now Gina McCarthy seems to be on the same track.  I am looking at the current situation with regard to this election. Coal mining in East Kentucky is not done yet.   The EPA administrator is appointed by the president and approved by congress. Obama and his EPA are doing everything they can to stop coal mining. The additional regulations coal companies have to comply with due to this administration is unreasonable (In my opinion).  Too many in congress vote with party lines and I suspect Grimes would do the same. My vote has to go with McConnell this time.   (If you feel bad that is your choice.)"

I didn't know this off the top of my head, but damn, it would've been amazing when McConnell said that he wasn't aware of anyone besides from Obama and Grimes who received ""four Pinocchios,"" she'd ask ""not even you back in April?""   Then mention how she doesn't always agree with Obama, but believes he has good intentions. Mention that she disagrees with McConnell about many things, including how he doesn't (seem to) regret voting for Nixon who was multitudes worse than Obama, then she'd say that ""I hope...(looks at McConnell) and trust that you would've been a source of reason who would've worked from inside of the party to change Nixon's misdoings, and that I will serve in that capacity today with Obama."" Granted, even though she may think very poorly of him, that would make her sound amicable and not a mudslinger. Then would've been a good time to list acts of obstruction, but she'd be low on time so nvm  that would be a good answer, right?  I'd like to run for public office someday, and I don't know if they have crappy answers or I unknowingly have a large ego when it comes to my pretend debates  .  I'd rather Alison present a strong defense of her actual views, but she has previously claimed to oppose cap-and-trade, so use that. Say that ""the reason why cap-and-trade failed with a majority Democratic congress is because moderate Democrats took a stand to moderate the president. Not all Democrats are the same, Mitch. Viewing people that way stands in the way of bipartisanship.""  .  A minimum of 90% of medicaid expansion costs are covered by the federal govt.

If the initial criteria to be included in the debate were used and equally enforced, the Nazi candidate would've been left out and David Patterson, who is the only ballot candidate excluded from the debate, would have been allowed to argue the libertarian position.

Kentucky,2j5bup,Mr_Tulip,0,Wed Oct 15 17:30:12 2014 UTC,"I'll bite your attempt at trolling because it implies a misunderstanding of the word oligarchy, the principles of libertarianism, or both, any of which should be cleared up for others.  noun: oligarchy; plural noun: oligarchies  a small group of people having control of a country, organization, or institution.  Libertarians argue for less government, in large part because of the collusion of the private sector with the public, resulting in crony capitalism. Legislators and regulatory bodies are co-opted by the biggest players of whatever sector it is they try to regulate and, in turn, end up creating a private oligarchy of large corporations that have clear advantages over competitors (small businesses). The fact that libertarians advocate for smaller government also rules out the idea that we want an oligarchy of government.  If you think that your joke is a fair representation of libertarianism, you've probably been watching too much TV. Go out and meet some of us - we have very varying views and we're not ""Republicans that like weed"" (an ignorant statement I saw from glancing at your previous posts)."
Kentucky,2j5bup,kellymcswelly,4,Wed Oct 15 17:42:03 2014 UTC,"Listen, I realize this 'less government more freedom' stuff all makes perfect sense to you right now, but libertarian economic theory is one giant mess of circular reasoning and unfounded assumptions which explicitly rejects empirical evidence in favor of unsupported axioms.  For a free market to function in the way that libertarians claim it would, consumers would have to always act in their own rational self interest based on perfect information of the market as a whole.  Furthermore, barriers to entry would have to be negligible.  That's not how the world works, and it's not how the world would work if all regulation were to be abolished tomorrow.  You claim that oligarchy only comes about because of crony capitalism.  That's an absurd statement that assumes that buy-outs, price fixing, collusion, and misinformation campaigns would somehow cease to exist in a world without regulation.  That last bit about Republicans who like weed was a description of a particular type of libertarian - the sort who protest loudly whenever they are called conservative, yet who hold conservative views on very nearly everything, perhaps throwing a bone to one or two social issues such as gay marriage or the drug war.  I have no need to meet more libertarians - I have met plenty, and I used to be one."
Kentucky,2j5bup,galt88,2,Tue Oct 14 20:48:23 2014 UTC,"I get that this seems unfair to the 3rd party candidates. If I was a 3rd party candidate I would be pissed.   At the same time however, this is a really important election for this state and country and there is a part of me that feels that having the 3rd party there would distract from the two people who are the main contenders. This debate could really change people's minds that are on the fence, and as an Alison supporter and someone who has put a lot of time volunteering for her campaign, I think she needs to focus on beating Mitch tonight.

Kentucky,2j5bup,lovemymeemers,7,Tue Oct 14 02:38:29 2014 UTC,"As a taxpayer-funded entity, I disagree that KET has ""the right to choose who they put on their broadcast."" If there are three candidates on the ballot, all three should be invited to the debate. There are enough people who want neither ""major"" candidate to win.

Kentucky,2j5bup,Doctor_Underdunk,6,Tue Oct 14 14:19:43 2014 UTC,"I do get your point about the taxpayer-funded thing. It is probably the producers of the broadcast wanting it to be a certain way and fighting for it. I have seen other states who allow all candidates and it becomes sort of a circus, although letting one of the 3rd party candidates on our probably would not be.  I did start out supporting Alison because I was AGAINST McConnell, but once I started to do research on her became very pro-Alison and what she stands for. She is very pro-women and our rights and that obviously appeals to me, as well as having most of the same liberal values as me.  Am I pro-Coal and pro guns? No. But if you want to win in KY you have to be. I doubt I would find a candidate in this state I completely agree with."
Kentucky,2j5bup,xerogod,2,Mon Oct 13 20:59:43 2014 UTC,"The occasional ""circus"" can be crucial.  Adding a third person who disagrees with the first two on a basic beliefs is inherently disruptive.  It causes the first two to have to ""backup"" and defend belief that they consider remedial and I consider egregiously wrong.  I realize this is probably not what you meant by circus, but it would be labeled as a circus by many.  Personally, I tend to think of it as a Bazaar as it has some crucial components in common with Eric Raymond's ""The Cathedral and the Bazaar"" written in the mid '90 in relation to open source software.  While I only read snippets of emails in the discovery process, my personal opinion is that KET didn't want to risk losing the debate due to Mitch and/or Alison avoiding the ""circus"".  While, I can understand voters crying ""Oh, no we can't loose the only debate we are going to see"", it is a terrible error on the publics part to allow the two party establishment to control the boundaries of the debate.    While I happen to be a libertarian, if the third person on the ballot were a communist I would want to see the Ds and Rs debate them too.  I may vehemently disagree with communists, but it is extremely health that I should be force to occasionally re-examine why I disagree with them.  Instead, we have the status quo insistent that we only consider that which already defines the status quo.  ...and what will we be rewarded with for allowing it?  The status quo."

Kentucky,2ivxqp,Vailhem,0,Fri Oct 10 20:12:25 2014 UTC,"E. coli contamination usually comes from vegetables washed in contaminated water. If the raw milk was contaminated with e. coli it would have to be due to the milk being contaminated after it came out of the cow, perhaps by being kept in a milk tank that was washed out with contaminated water. E. coli lives in the intestines of corn fed cattle, not in their milk.  Part of the allure of Kentucky raw milk is the local, traceable way it is usually acquired here. Since selling raw milk is illegal in Kentucky, the only way you can legally get it is to buy your own cow. Recently groups of people have started forming cooperative groups that pool their money to invest in a herd of cows. Once an individual ""buys in"" they become an owner and are entitled to a certain amount of milk every week.  In this type of relationship all of the milk drinkers know exactly where their milk comes from and the farmer better keep their farm up to snuff, because any contamination or illness resulting from the milk will be immediately traceable directly back to it's very obvious source.  If five kids all got sick from the same source, it should be followed up on. If their families are drinking raw milk, it's likely that they are also buying other local products, like spinach, lettuce or kale. The milk is probably not the only link."

In some cases the LFA is the state, while in others it might be a city, county, or municipality. The LFA is meant to address cable problems such as service related rates and charges, tier rates, customer service problems, franchise fees, signal quality, and the use of public, educational, and governmental (PEG) channels.  When experiencing a problem with your cable television you should first contact the cable company itself, then the local franchise authorities, then the National Citizens Committee for Broadcasting, and finally the chairmen of the House and Senate subcommittees who oversee the FCC.

Its the 323 Million dollars in coal severance tax that get pumped back into the state.  Chances are, no matter where you are...you use services paid for by coal mining tax.  There are some funds which are taken right off the top. Last year that amount was $25,272,500. The first $19 million goes to the Worker’s Compensation Fund. Then, $872,500 goes to benefit an Osteopathic Medicine Scholarship Fund. Students at the University of Pikeville benefit from this. The Trover Clinic receives a $1 million grant as they provide the family practice residency program for medical students in Madisonville. Finally, the state Department of Mine Safety gets $4.4 million because in 2007, the General Assembly required that they double the number of mine inspectors. It also supports the requirement that mine rescue teams be located within 60 miles of every mine.  This $297,899,570 remaining is split into two parts. The first 50% ($148,949,785) goes directly into the General Fund.  Have any of you benefited from General Fund dollars?   The other 50% is designated for distribution. It is divided between the Local Government Economic Assistance Fund (LGEAF) [ $44,684,936 or 15%] and the Local Government Economic Development Fund (LGEDF) [ $104,264,850 or 35%].  The LGEAF money is granted to counties and cities for economic development projects...and not just counties with coal mines.  So if you think just because you are in a county without mining and somehow don't benefit...think again.  The remaining is spent by the LGEDF.  Here are some LGEDF recipients:    Read to Achieve, $3million; School Technology for University of Louisville’s school computer and data processing project, 2.5 million; University of Kentucky’s Mine Engineering Scholarship Program, $300,000; Debt Service – School Facility Construction Commission (SFCC) – 2003 HB269 54.7million Bond Funds, $4,617,900; Debt Service – Kentucky Infrastructure Authority (KIA) – 2003 HB269 54.8million Bond Funds (20year bond), $4,091,400; Debt Service – Kentucky Infrastructure Authority (KIA) – 2006 HB380 50million Bond Funds(A) (20year bond) and 50million Bond Funds(B) (20year bond), $8,562,300; Debt Service – Kentucky Infrastructure Authority (KIA) – 2008 50million Bond Funds and HB514 - 25million Bond Funds (20year bond), $7,538,000; Debt Service – Kentucky Infrastructure Authority (KIA) – 2005 80million Bond Funds (20year bond), $694,200; The University of Kentucky’s Robinson Scholar’s Program, $1 million; Mine Safety - $952,000; Money to pay salary and benefits for administration staff who administer the LGEDF  program from the Department of Local Government and Kentucky Infrastructure Authority, $1,039,700.  These distributions total $34,295,500.  Not to mention, Kentucky politicians sure seem to think a lot about coal tax...Breshear and Stumbo were forced, by sheer outrage, to give back 2.5 Million in Coal Tax they planned to use in Rupp Arena Renovation."

Kentucky,2isams,RedMushtoom,3,Thu Oct 9 23:05:01 2014 UTC,"I'll cross-post my response in /r/Lexington to here;    As a gay man (and agnostic atheist) here in Lexington, I actually hold a contrary opinion and don't believe they discriminated against the GLSO at all.    There is no excuse for the GLSO not to have know HOO was a very religious and Christian based company. It's all over their website. Not saying that Christianity means that you're not supportive but let's be realistic; this is KY.    The first person they spoke to said they could print the shirts and offered a quote. They were contacted back by the CEO (I believe) and told that they would not print the shirts but they would find another company to print them and honor the same quote they were given and the GLSO refused.    When it comes to advertising and messages being printed, I do believe people should have the right to refuse service. They weren't discriminated against based upon their sexuality it was solely because their company's name was going to be on shirts involving a message that contradicts with their beliefs.    HOO went further than most would and found another company to honor the same quote. So it's obvious they were trying to extend an olive branch and had no malicious intent.    The GLSO claims they had no idea that HOO was a religious based company but I find that hard to believe. If the same people who placed the order came in and ordered shirts of a different nature, I can assure you they would fulfill the order. So it has nothing to do with the sexual orientation of the people; it's solely about the message the shirts were giving and the fact that their companies name would be on those shirts as well, essentially advertising for the pride event.    I understand why people feel they shouldn't be allowed to do it but at the same time, HOO was never malicious about the issue and found someone to duplicate their quote. (the GLSO chose HOO because of the cheap quote they offered).    I think it's over reacting on both parts personally."
Kentucky,2isams,fuzio,2,Fri Oct 10 13:20:05 2014 UTC,"Whether they knew it or not... replace ""gay"" with ""black"" in this situation.  If they knew HOO hated black folk, then tried to place the order anyway, would it be okay for HOO to deny them?"
Kentucky,2isams,fuzio,1 point,Wed Oct 15 14:33:15 2014 UTC,"I'm not saying it's right or okay.    GLSO should have used a bit of common sense. I feel (my personal opinion) that this was likely done for promotion. The GLSO, at the time of this incident, was hurting for money almost to the point where they couldn't pay rent anymore on the building. (They had been posting on FB stating this exact thing and sending out letters asking for donations) While I don't know that this was done with the intent of trying to drum up needless controversy in order to garner more donations and support it seems pretty coincidental that around the time they were hurting for money that they contact an organization that's known for it's deep religious beliefs to make shirts for them supporting the Pride Festival.    HOO did far more, in my opinion, than anyone else would have in that they found another vendor to honor the price they quoted the GLSO. That was, from what I was told by a GLSO member, the reason they chose HOO out of the other vendors they'd gotten quotes from.     If they knew HOO hated black folk, then tried to place the order anyway, would it be okay for HOO to deny them?     HOO did not refuse to print the merchandise due to the sexuality of the people placing the order. It was in regards to the event the merchandise was promoting. Two entirely different things. There is zero evidence that HOO ""hates gay people"". Refusal to print shirts for a LGBT Pride Festival isn't evidence that they hate LGBT people.    I'm a huge agnostic atheist; I think religion is a bad thing (in terms of the big picture) for society. I am rarely one to stand up and say anything in support of a religious organization but I find it a bit odd that during a time the GLSO is stating, in their own words, ""We might have to close our doors"", that this controversy happens with an HRC lawsuit (or whatever they call them) and donations / support start pouring in from all over the state.    I have friends who work for the GLSO, and try to involve myself in events with the GLSO as well. I have nothing against them or the organization. I support pretty much everything they do; I just think some common sense and decency (from both sides) is in order on this and that this was blown way out of proportion."

Christianity is a religion.  A company is a for profit business.  It is impossible for a company or corporation to belong to a religion.  The owner of the company/corporation may but the corporation itself does not.   A company/corporation is not a sentient being.  If the owners of these companies do not believe all human beings in a civil society should be treated equally they have the right, protected by law, not to own/operate a company.  Nobody is holding a gun to their heads making them operate these businesses.   If they don't like black people and therefore do not want to do business with black people, they have the choice to not own a business."

It's not like the owner of the company was sitting on his couch one day when government agents showed up at his home, burst through the door, held a gun to his head forcing him to start a business then print tshirts he doesn't like.    It's plain and simple.  All men and women were created equal.  If you would like to start a business to sell items to these men and women, you can.  If you don't want to start a business to sell items to these men and women, that's your choice too.  Nobody is forcing you to do it if you don't want to.  what you can't do, however, is start a business then refuse service to black folks because ""I hate dem dare niggers"", refuse service to gay people because ""I hate dem dare fagooots"" or refuse business to women because ""I hate dem bitches.  They's good for suckin' my pecker but that's it.""  People need to stop being fucking idiots.  Nobody is better than anybody else.  If they believe a god created them then a god created everybody else too.  they're not special.  if they don't believe in god they need to stop being bigoted fucks who spend their lives trying to separate themselves from every other human being on this planet who varies even the slightest from their own genetic makeup (probably because everybody else isn't inbred) to build a false sense of superiority.  There's no room in a civilized society for people who say, ""I don't like him.  His hair is darker than mine"", ""I don't like him, his skin tone is 2 shades darker than mine"", ""I don't like her.  she has a vagina and it's different than my penis."" ""I don't like him/her.  they love somebody from the opposite gender than I do."".  If these bigoted idiots don't like it they can just move away from civilized society. Nobody's forcing them to be here.  Nobody's holding a gun to their head preventing them from leaving.  I'm sure they could find plenty of wide open space in the middle of a Montana wheat field with no other human being around for 50 miles.  There they'd never have to encounter another human being different than themselves in any way."

Kentucky,2ingoo,Neurokeen,4,Wed Oct 8 21:02:48 2014 UTC,"As a gay man (and agnostic atheist) here in Lexington, I actually hold a contrary opinion and don't believe they discriminated against the GLSO at all.    There is no excuse for the GLSO not to have know HOO was a very religious and Christian based company. It's all over their website. Not saying that Christianity means that you're not supportive but let's be realistic; this is KY.    The first person they spoke to said they could print the shirts and offered a quote. They were contacted back by the CEO (I believe) and told that they would not print the shirts but they would find another company to print them and honor the same quote they were given and the GLSO refused.    When it comes to advertising and messages being printed, I do believe people should have the right to refuse service. They weren't discriminated against based upon their sexuality it was solely because their company's name was going to be on shirts involving a message that contradicts with their beliefs.    HOO went further than most would and found another company to honor the same quote. So it's obvious they were trying to extend an olive branch and had no malicious intent.    The GLSO claims they had no idea that HOO was a religious based company but I find that hard to believe. If the same people who placed the order came in and ordered shirts of a different nature, I can assure you they would fulfill the order. So it has nothing to do with the sexual orientation of the people; it's solely about the message the shirts were giving and the fact that their companies name would be on those shirts as well, essentially advertising for the pride event.    I understand why people feel they shouldn't be allowed to do it but at the same time, HOO was never malicious about the issue and found someone to duplicate their quote. (the GLSO chose HOO because of the cheap quote they offered).    I think it's over reacting on both parts personally."

Kentucky,2igjhx,-deteled-,9,Mon Oct 6 21:47:24 2014 UTC,"Ideally, that's true.  But with our electoral system, it isn't.  The system is set up so that voting strategically (your personal favorite of the two major parties) is the way that voters get their best outcome.  Even if you dislike both parties equally, voting against the status quo is usually more effective than voting for a third party.  I could get really specific about how third parties win elections, but basically, a third party doesn't stand a chance in an election with a 30 year incumbent US Senate Minority Leader in the running.  However, against a one-term, liberal-leaning in a conservative state, possibly unpopular senator, a third party could enter the next race as a serious candidate.  In addition, third party candidates do far better when they're in an election after an incumbent resigns, or they've been elected to a previous office under a major party.  Neither of which is the case for our election."

It bothers me that people don't seem to grasp that politicians are suppose to 'pander' to the people that they represent.  If Grimes gets elected and goes back on her support of coal, she won't be reelected except by divine intervention.  Thus, even if she is personally against coal, she will walk, talk, sing, and dance about how great coal is if she's elected.  Also, going to field organizers (lowest level of campaign management) and getting their opinion on a campaign is hardly a way to get any idea about the candidates 'secret intentions'.  I'm sure that I could get a McConnell field organizer to say that McConnell actually doesn't support African-American rights, but he says that he does to get votes."

Not sure what part of the state your in (if you even still live around here), but I know up here in NKY vape stores have been popping up all over the place. I'd recommend you go with a bigger set up than the disposable sort they sell at gas stations as you have a much larger variety of flavors/customizations to choose from. If you're in a more rural area, walmart should carry the HAUS brand personal vaporizer at the cigarette aisle that would be a good start (plus you should be able to get replaceables at any hour)."

With the increased mechanization of mining it just isn't going to employ much unskilled labor, as much as Mitch wants to say otherwise.  And since the majority are unskilled and uneducated we can't just switch them to some other area without adequate training which will take several (5+) years.   We can't just open some programming shops there, unlike Rand says.    I guess we could open up a bunch of low pay call centers, but I really don't wish that work on anyone.  Manufacturing now-a-days is more mechanized plus the hills and mountains make the train shipment of goods difficult.  Hemp farming I would imagine is easily mechanized.

Well I can't speak for whether the plans were objectively bad but he sure as hell has done a terrible job in his legislative position so far. If he's not pushing for even more deregulation in areas where it's desperately needed, refusing to answer questions about immigration, denying climate change, continuing to deny women reproductive rights, claiming paycheck fairness laws are essentially Soviet legislature, or hiring Neo-Confederate racists, then he's ignoring the tenants of the libertarian philosophy he claims to follow by trying to increase the power of the Federal government when it comes to States legalizing weed and arguing for drone strikes on Americans. And whenever he takes time off from all of that really influential work he's busy being a real asshole everywhere else by telling single mothers they're just not being good enough, telling blue collar workers they just need to accept the tough love of poverty wages, plagiarizing, and telling people that ""There Is No Greater Defender, Truly, of Minority Rights... Than Myself"", again, this coming from someone who hires Neo-Confederates.  Is that seriously what we want Kentucky's legacy to be? How we want to be represented?

Kentucky,2h3spd,thingscouldbeworse,0,Tue Sep 23 04:41:07 2014 UTC,"You've misrepresented most of those links with your descriptions.  For instance, the article that you said was ""trying to increase the power of the Federal government when it comes to States legalizing weed"" describes a bill meant to apply to all federal laws, not just those related to state/federal marijuana legalization.    Regarding denial of ""women's reproductive rights"", the right to perform/receive an abortion is seen by conservatives as the converse of the right of a fetus to its own life. It depends on which group or which set of rights trumps the other, and helpless little babies are favored by conservatives over fertile women.  And there are other ""reproductive rights"" beyond abortion.  You are seriously misrepresenting Paul when you say that he is ""trying his hardest to keep down minorities, women..."" Do you sincerely believe that?  Do you really think that Paul is trying to oppress people?  This seems like a good example of the psychological tendencies described by Jonathan Haidt, summarized as follows:    ... Haidt’s research suggests that many liberals really do believe that conservatives are heartless bastards–or as a friend of mine once remarked, “Conservatives think that liberals are good people with bad ideas, whereas liberals think conservatives are bad people”–and very liberal people think that especially strongly. Haidt suggests that there is some truth to this.    There is a lot of discussion of similar points on the political internet.  I don't think you are a bad person, but I do think you are a person who hasn't considered the potential legitimacy of alternative perspectives with much seriousness.  P.S. One adheres to the ""tenets"" of a philosophy."

The law abiding citizens lose their weapon and the crooks keep theirs.  All it takes is a little research to see the kind of laws they want to pass.  Start out with a registry then they know what everyone lawfully owns then start outlawing them one at a time so they can confiscate them while militarizing the police forces.

That's what she brings to the table. Mitch has explicitly said that if Republicans take the Senate under his leadership, you can expect more and more stalled budgets and pointless debt ceiling debates as a Republican tactic to force Obama to do what they want. Holding the global economy hostage as a way to gut social programs is his explicit strategy going forward. He's proud of it. He thinks it's the right thing to do. That's what a vote for Mitch is a vote for. Even if Grimes brings absolutely nothing to the table (which isn't the case), voting for her purely because she isn't Mitch McConnell is still the right thing to do.  ""Oh, but voting against someone instead of for someone isn't how things should be done!""  Well, yes, in a vacuum, that's true. But if your choices are Hitler vs. some fucking guy, you're damn right you should get out and vote for some fucking guy. Mitch isn't Hitler by any stretch, but he does fucking suck.

Other than that, as a Democrat she's going to support healthy social programs and protections for the working class (e.g., a higher minimum wage), and she's specifically stated that she's committed to alleviating the country's student loan burden, which is a massive issue that Republicans won't touch.

Even if she doesn't have any specific plans at all, she tilts the scales slightly in favor of the left when it comes to votes in the Senate. We generally speaking know where she's going to fall on a range of issues simply because of her party affiliation, and that alone distinguishes her from McConnell.   Not to mention that if you, like many, want Mitch out, a vote for no one is functionally a vote for Mitch -- everyone who doesn't vote for change is complacent in staying the course. And an unfocused or ineffective Grimes is better than an effective McConnell focused on doing the wrong thing. We don't yet know whether or not Grimes would be unfocused or ineffective.

The reason they need to replace the bridge is because it is in such a state of disrepair and it would be cheeper to build a new one.  He never mentions that.    He does say if the bridge does need to be replaced to use a simpler design.  I don't know all of the details that went into the bid for this bridge, but if it is possible, I would agree with that.

As the quite likely soon to be senate majority leader (or possibly strong minority leader) he helps bring a large amount of clout to KY that we have had for so long we forget about it. Grimes does not. 2.) Guns, I know it is a shallow reason, but I like to have guns, I am applying for a silencer this month, grimes does not like those sorts of fun toys that can defend freedom. 3.) This is probably the most important to me, but is admittedly quite personal. If it wasn't for McConnell stepping in and calling the Ugandan Embassy my dad would still be there trying to bring my second adopted brother home. That my newest little brother is in the states and going to get the treatment to survive his medical conditions would convince me to vote for him even if I were against every other issue he represents.  edit: spelling"
Kentucky,2h3spd,SpackleButt,8,Mon Sep 22 12:09:09 2014 UTC,"I understand your personal reasons for supporting him, and good on him for helping you and your family out. I like you would support him too. I'm happy for your you and your brothers.  Now...He has been the Republican leader for some time now giving clout to KY and used it for nothing. As far as guns go. Nobody is coming for your guns. You won't have to turn in your guns if Grimes is elected. Let's be real here. The only ""gun control"" that Democrats have proposed in the last year is a national registry of guns. This is a common sense policy that a large majority of the country supports. If I have to register my car you should have to register your gun."
Kentucky,2h3spd,SGTWhiteKY,3,Mon Sep 22 12:20:57 2014 UTC,"We can agree to disagree on the guns. I think it has been used for more than most people realize, I know of a few examples, but it should be used for much more.  edit: I change my mind about agreeing to disagree. Though the evidence suggests that those numbers saying the majority of the country support it are wrong, that is still irrelevant. I don't support it, so my vote is going to the candidate who doesn't."
Kentucky,2h3spd,SpackleButt,0,Mon Sep 22 12:28:03 2014 UTC,So you are willing to throw the middle class under the bus for your guns?
Kentucky,2h3spd,SGTWhiteKY,-2,Mon Sep 22 14:00:52 2014 UTC,"As far as I can tell the middle class was a short experiment of humanity that as it turns out, only works in a very specific set of circumstances. It began during the industrial revolution and is now fading into a shadow of what it was. We are conveniencing ourselves out of a middle class. UPS which employs many thousands of people has replaced roughly ten jobs in the drop shipping industry for every one person they have employed. AT&T employs a fraction of the people selling cellphones than they once did maintaining their networks and operators. Every major factory employs less people, or the same number of people for massively less somewhere else. As we head back to the Lords and the Serfs I for one want to be armed. I feel no guilt not wanting the failed middle class concept on life support paid for through my tax dollars."
Kentucky,2h3spd,ky420,-1,Mon Sep 22 16:46:34 2014 UTC,Yes a national registry of guns so the government can wait a couple of years and then come confiscate the ones they don't like.
Kentucky,2h3spd,todd200,0,Mon Sep 22 16:00:49 2014 UTC,Not who you were speaking to but a National Registry is instantly enough to count her out.

I'm just so sick of guns and this is not the best state to feel that way.
Kentucky,2h3spd,SGTWhiteKY,4,Mon Sep 22 17:24:30 2014 UTC,"My silencer will mainly protect my hearing. Out of curiosity can you explain why you are ""so sick of guns"". I'm not asking a political question. I am just curious what inspired the statement. Do you see a lot around? Are you just sick of the argument? Do  either of those things actually make you feel sick or are you just tired of them... or something else I didn't think of. I really am curious, if you don't want to talk about it hear to avoid the argument feel free to PM me."
Kentucky,2h3spd,spinblackcircles,-1,Mon Sep 22 17:29:41 2014 UTC,"Sick of innocent people getting shot and our country unable to do anything about it because of people 'protecting freedom', which really means 'protecting my own ass and my own family from someone else with a gun, regardless of the collateral damage from a market flooded with illegal and legal guns that are insanely easy to get'.  Guns themselves aren't necessarily the problem, but our laws concerning them are ridiculous and there absolutely needs to be a lot more restrictions placed on who can have one and how many. And assault rifles should never be owned by anyone that doesn't work for the government. Call me a liberal or whatever you want but I am fucking sick of guns and needless violence and preventable gun related deaths."
Kentucky,2h3spd,cromulenticular,3,Tue Sep 23 02:14:17 2014 UTC,"I think you should look into some statistics on gun deaths, the types of guns involved in gun deaths, the types of people involved in gun deaths (hint: not usually gun enthusiasts, hunters or hobby shooters)."

This button would erase all guns from the world, and all ability to make guns forever, I will be the first person to press it, I will click it. Until then I will have a gun on my person every minute of everyday I am legally allowed to (attending UofL makes that difficult). Even in country's with strict gun control there is still gun crime. Assault rifles are a weird one though. People want them banned for purely emotional reasons. On average 323 people are killed each year with rifles, not just assault rifles. On average less than 100 of those are with assault rifles. Over 1,700 people a year are killed with knives. So 17 times more people are killed each year with knives than assault rifles. Most of the deaths in aurora were with a shotgun. So the only major assault rifle event was at sandy hook. I get that it is sad. But people only care because it was a bunch of white kids. Over 40,000 children are saying each day of starvation in Africa. So you could spend your time on an emotional attempt to ban something that kills 100 people a year. Or spend your energy trying to says millions each year. Just my $.02"
Kentucky,2h3spd,spinblackcircles,0,Tue Sep 23 09:15:29 2014 UTC,"I can't imagine living life so paranoid that I would need a gun on my person at all times I was able. If something terribly traumatic happened to me I could understand and I would probably agree with you.

Kentucky,2h3spd,ky420,1 point,Tue Sep 23 13:21:00 2014 UTC,It is not the lawful gun owners causing the shootings.  They have nothing to do with criminals who have stolen guns and caused problems.  If they did outlaw guns which is what you want nobody would have them but the criminals. How are you supposed to protect yourself then.
Kentucky,2h3spd,spinblackcircles,0,Tue Sep 23 12:46:49 2014 UTC,"I don't want all guns outlawed. I never said those words. I said I want them heavily restricted as far as who has them, how many they have, and how powerful they are. Jethro in Irvine having 8 different guns and 2 assault rifles is INSANE and should be illegal. You want to protect yourself? Fine, one handgun would do that. The rest of the arsenals people have is just dick measuring similar to how big can your truck get and how much smoke can it blow. I've seen it my whole life."
Kentucky,2h3spd,ky420,0,Tue Sep 23 13:24:16 2014 UTC,Protects nearby people from hearing you practice and bothering them.  I guess you get all your views on guns from the movies. I feel sorry for you being so ignorant of the rights we are trying to protect.

Countries like Germany say they are all renewable but they don't mention a large part of their power comes from Nuclear plants and is just supplemented with the renewables.  I would love to see wind turbines going up around the state even solar panels for that matter it is just the cost.  I see them going down hwy 80 all the time on trucks and they are really impressive.  However we still need the coal industry as things are and if we are gonna pull out it needs to be really gradual.  I really wish we could build a Nuclear plant though that would solve many problems and allow for the renewables to be put into place much easier.  I can't stand people's fear of Nuclear power it is safe and people make it out to be the devil like its a fission bomb sitting there making power at the brink of going super-critical.  With the tech we have these days there is no reason we shouldn't be putting these plants up.  I wish more people would actually learn the truth instead of listening just to the ignorance they put on the news stations.
Kentucky,2h3spd,leo_jones,2,Mon Sep 22 17:41:44 2014 UTC,Isn't nuclear considered clean energy? I know new plants got all that funding from the govt a few years back.

Kentucky,2fj0ze,mlbontbs87,-19,Fri Sep 5 13:08:47 2014 UTC,"Cuts taxes for oils industry, doesn't help small businesses   All reductions to our corporate taxation are a good thing.   Marriage is a religious sacrament that does not at all have anything to do with the legal definition. So keep the state and church separate.   This is naive & impractical   Shutting down abortion clinics does not prevent pregnancies nor does it prevent young women from taking matters into their own hands, often to horrendous results.   It does prevent many, if not all abortions. While we should strive to prevent unwanted pregnancies, we should also strive to protect all lives that currently exist.   Our state has more millionaires than several states around us, and was host to the Equestrian games. Where's the jobs? Where's the wealth? Where's the pay raises? Not happening. Trickle down economics DOES NOT HAPPEN.   Because anecdotes are great economic arguments, after all.   The coal industry is on the sharpest decline it's ever been on.....with this man in office. There's no stopping that tide. Just like the candle industry going down when light bulbs were invented, it's time to pack up bags and make a living in a new line of work. But instead he's spreading false hope to a region that should have more options.   There are close to 2 centuries worth of coal in the ground.  There is no good reason prevent the expansion of clean coal/liquefied coal technology.  The only reason we dont see that is because of overblown fears of AGW.  Mitch is standing against bull like cap & trade.   No student loan support   The less teh gov't is involved in student loans, the cheaper college tuition will get.  BUt when the gov't throws money at students, then colleges have no incentive to keep costs down.   No funding for educational institutions   More money has never equated to sustained improvements in educational outcomes.  The dept. of education is a waste.   No higher minimum wage   That is a great way to destroy entry level jobs for immigrants and teenagers who are unqualified for anything else.   If this man isn't the very face of corruption in Washington. The very face of the term ""lifetime politician"". The very face of ""do nothing except fill his own pockets while the common man suffers"", then I honestly don't know who is.   How about these?.  Because a vote for Grimes is a vote for these people to stay in charge."

Kentucky,2fj0ze,hansSA,5,Fri Sep 5 19:13:32 2014 UTC,"If you're magnanimous enough to assume you alone possess all the facts and that your way is inherently the only way, there's nothing I can say to burst the little bubble that you live in. Fine with me, I'd rather you stay there. My only comfort comes from the fact that majority of people who share your beliefs are rapidly aging. Time and education will win out in the end. It mostly always does."
Kentucky,2fj0ze,mlbontbs87,-10,Fri Sep 5 19:39:01 2014 UTC,"I most certainly don't believe that.  I simply believe that matters of economics and morals are matters of fact, not conjecture, which means they should be disputed as right or wrong based on objective argument, not written off because they are old.  If I am wrong, show me.  If you can't, then perhaps you should consider what I say or do more research."
Kentucky,2fj0ze,hansSA,5,Fri Sep 5 19:50:09 2014 UTC,Morals are facts? Seriously? Wow. I guess it's really convenient then that you happened to be born and raised with a family and a church who got it right compared to the 6 billion other people alive who must have it factually wrong.

Kentucky,2fj0ze,mlbontbs87,-10,Fri Sep 5 16:10:57 2014 UTC,Except our spending on education has never been correlated with gains in education.  Throwing more money at schools surprisingly doesn't do anything.

Kentucky,2fj0ze,mlbontbs87,-4,Fri Sep 5 16:37:11 2014 UTC,"Alternatively, you can check out the chart here for US spending, or a full blown report on the issue in the UK here.  This article goes into more detail."
Kentucky,2fj0ze,leo_jones,10,Fri Sep 5 16:51:16 2014 UTC,"Your article conveniently focuses on Hanusheks study, which was gathered in the 70s using methods and data that are outdated and don't pass in academic circles anymore. The HF also conveniently ignores how educational funds are distributed throughout each state by just focusing on the national averages. The Shaker Institute deals with these methodology concerns in pages 10-14.  Even aside from that, the main point of the article is that increasing educational budgets might be secondary to analyzing how budgets are spent, which I think most people can agree on. If you asked high school aged leo_jones, he would have been all for cutting a few administrators out of the budget in favor of higher level classes he'd be all for it. But to suggest that the department that provides funding and actually does the analysis of school budgets and makes suggestions on what they should do with them is a waste is crazy. Absolutely nuts."

Kentucky,2fh7wt,mlbontbs87,9,Thu Sep 4 23:30:23 2014 UTC,"Honestly curious and still forming my opinion, what exactly does McConnell do for our nation and state that means he should earn our votes?"
Kentucky,2fh7wt,festizian,-20,Thu Sep 4 23:39:06 2014 UTC,"He has a long record of standing for our bill of rights, especially the first and second amendment.  He stands strong for the rights of children not to be murdered in the womb.  He protects our coal industry.  He is not Harry Reid.  He has also stood strong against such destructive legislation as obamacare, cap & trade and mccain-feingold. He has supported the nomination of level-headed, conservative judges. Though his record is far weaker on this than I would prefer, he does have a view of smaller government than Grimes does, and especially than the Democratic party.  Also, if you don't like the tea party, he has vowed to crush them, and has successfully campaigned for incumbents in at least 5 primaries which had tea party challengers (this is a major reason why I voted Bevin in May).  Grimes, meanwhile, has no accomplishments.  Her tenure as sec of state has been unmemorable.  She has been successful thus far largely because of her daddy, and now for running against the most hated republican in america.  She has campaigned on nonsense like the war on women and meaningless statistics like 78 cents on the dollar.  In short, while Mitch is far from perfect, there have been much worse members of the Senate, and I am confident Grimes would be one of them."
Kentucky,2fh7wt,mlbontbs87,11,Fri Sep 5 01:01:58 2014 UTC,"The topic of abortion is likely something you should stay away from when attempting to sway undecided voters, especially if you're going to use strong language like murder. If somebody is likely to agree that abortion =  murder, they're likely already going to vote your way anyways.  Also, I work in the healthcare field and to characterize obamacare as destructive is disingenuous. The expansion of medicaid and Kynect have been a resounding success for our state, and I see it every day while working in Appalachia.  Why is a judge being conservative a good thing? Would it not be best for a judge to be unbiased, impartial, and difficult to label?"
Kentucky,2fh7wt,festizian,-9,Fri Sep 5 14:58:49 2014 UTC,"The topic of abortion is likely something you should stay away from when attempting to sway undecided voters   Most americans are far less liberal on abortion than Grimes and the democratic party.  However, many of those on the fence simply don't see abortion as a significant issue because they buy into all the euphemism that surrounds it.  I like to call a stone a stone, and sometimes bluntness is exactly what people need to realize the gravity of the situation.   The expansion of medicaid and Kynect have been a resounding success for our state   At what cost though?  Trampling our civil liberties? Moving us a huge step closer to a gov't run healthcare system?  Forcing people who do not want insurance to buy it anyway?  Most of the people I know who work in healthcare see Medicare/medicaid to be a major reason why hospitals are barely staying afloat financially, and Obamacare is only making that worse.  Sure it's great for poor people to be able to afford medical care, but if the quality of care goes to shit, or if hospitals are closing up, that hurts all people in the long run, and most especially the poor.   Why is a judge being conservative a good thing?   Being a conservative judge is a good thing because a judge's job is to faithfully interpret the law, not to read anything into it that is not there.  So when I say conservative, I mean in the sense of textual interpretation.  Conservative is unbiased, because it means they are trying their hardest to not read their own opinions or the cultural mood into determining what our laws say."

Kentucky,2ewzcn,BuckDunford,9,Fri Aug 29 21:46:03 2014 UTC,"Mitch said his #1 goal was to make Obama a 1 term president, and he couldn't even do that. Why should I believe any of his other promises?

Kentucky,2ewzcn,glass_hedgehog,1 point,Sat Aug 30 01:50:55 2014 UTC,He couldn't even do that.   As if one person can easily swing a national election.
Kentucky,2ewzcn,heisenberg69,9,Sun Aug 31 13:26:00 2014 UTC,I'd vote Grimes. Imo McConnell is -10 and Grimes is -9. Both suck.
Kentucky,2ewzcn,jboromir,14,Fri Aug 29 16:46:37 2014 UTC,I will in all likelyhood vote for grimes because if the republicans swing the majority in the senate they will put riders on every appropriations bill.  It is their plan.  So a vote for grimes is a vote to stop that shit.  The republicans will stop grimes and the democrats from screwing too much up.
Kentucky,2ewzcn,cyvoid,10,Fri Aug 29 17:00:38 2014 UTC,"I'd choose Grimes just so I wouldn't be receiving all theses ""Mitch is gonna save coal from the big bad guberment"" flyers."

Kentucky,2ewzcn,SayethWeAll,7,Sat Aug 30 01:59:21 2014 UTC,Grimes because I'm a pretentious liberal and that is as close to a progressive candidate that we will ever get in a statewide election (not that she is even close but it is what it is). Plus I disagree with Mitch on just about every single policy issue there is.
Kentucky,2ewzcn,gianini10,4,Sat Aug 30 02:45:10 2014 UTC,"See, I don't feel comfortable voting at all. Sure, Grimes is probably closer to my political views, and Mitch's voting record and unwillingness to compromise (see shut-down thread) doesn't agree with me. But I still don't know the specifics about what they want to do. All I've heard from Grimes is vague lip service about the minimum wage and the fact that she isn't Mitch, and all Mitch seems to talk about between whining that people can't give even MORE money to political campaigns is about how we need to take the fight to Obama, who will be out in 2 years anyway. You'd think that they'd at least have a debate (I don't think Fancy Farm counts), but they can't agree on it.  TL;DR: Until they actually have a debate or start talking about specific plans for Kentucky's problems, I don't know that I'll vote at all. This is a really shitty race."

I don't like some stuff that Mitch has done, but Grimes really seems like she is going to be in Obama's pocket, but then what? She only talks about minimum wage, other than telling you is going to be a good senator. Kinds reminds me on Family Guy where Lois just keeps saying 9/11.

Grimes keeps spouting liberal nonsense, and shed vote for Reid to rule the senate. Mitch has lots of problems, but he's still better than most democrats I've met.  FWIW though, the only time I'd vote third party is if repubs and tea party split."
Kentucky,2ewzcn,mlbontbs87,5,Fri Aug 29 19:33:44 2014 UTC,"So, Mitch's unwillingness to create new jobs has pulled you into voting for him?"
Kentucky,2ewzcn,bigtaterman,-2,Sat Aug 30 12:04:03 2014 UTC,"Creating jobs is not the gov't's job. Gov't needs to facilitate an environment for the market to thrive, and not put impediments up. Mitch's recent off the cuff comment about minimum wage demonstrates that he at least has a feeble grasp of that.  Also, Mitch doesn't want people to have unrestricted access to infanticide, nor does he spout feminist talking points about a wage gap that isn't real."
Kentucky,2ewzcn,mlbontbs87,-2,Sat Aug 30 12:43:18 2014 UTC,As much as hate mitch he getting my vote. Why you ask because he does get ky a lot money and recognition by being republic miniorty leader of the Senate. Sorry grimes :(.

It's fun, really pretty, and super historic. I would highly recommend it, and say that it's easily worth the drive if you have the time.   I ended up visiting a few other distilleries on the trail and the tour guides inevitably mentioned that maker's had the best tour."
Kentucky,2esjjx,cdb3492,1 point,Thu Aug 28 05:46:54 2014 UTC,Maker's does seem like it's highly rated. I've also been told Buffalo Trace is good
Kentucky,2esjjx,cdb3492,1 point,Thu Aug 28 13:27:14 2014 UTC,Perhaps the ratings were old? I was just there over this summer and everyone on the tour had a fantastic time. You actually tour the distillery  rather than going on a tour of stuff (like old equipment and educational films) like a few others have. You also get the dip a bottle in the wax at the end of the tour and you get a really cool tasting experience. I can't imagine why it would have low ratings.

We've also been to Buffalo Trace, it's technically not part of the trail but makes some of the best bourbon and still gives tours and tastings."

I haven't made time do either tour myself though. Kind of shameful really. I was born and raised here. I have to say though, that Woodford Reserve might be one of my favorite places. So peaceful."

Kentucky,2ee3lk,galt88,3,Sun Aug 24 00:21:46 2014 UTC,"A vote for Grimes is just a vote against McConnell. But its a futile endeavor. I have half a mind to abstain from this one in sheer protest.   KY's McConnell is in the same position as California's Feinstein. Nobody will vote for the opposing party, so the only way to get them out of office is to introduce a better candidate of the same party. Considering McConnell's position in the senate, the chance of that happening is on par with Grime's chance to win this time."

Also, I live in Lexington and visit Hopkinsville and Bowling Green, KY often (and we just got married in the Red River Gorge, so I understand the stress of planning a wedding) and I'm always up for helping a fellow redditor out, so just PM me if you ever need me to pick something up to mail to you, or scope out anything for your wedding, or really anything you need here in Kentucky.   Edit: I just kinda realized maybe the Kentucky for Kentucky ones aren't exactly what you're looking for. But maybe some tourist places might have some, like Keeneland, or the convention center attached to Rupp arena. If you're interested, I can run by there (and any other places in Lexington you may suspect have some you would want) after work or on a weekend sometime and take a look for you. I know how frustrating looking online for something like this could be. Just shoot me a PM if you want me to."

With this do-nothing congress, and two years before the next presidential election, where Obama can't be reelected, seems like a poor choice of a running platform. If this election happened four years ago, where the possibility of Obama being reelected, the campaign would make much more sense, but this entire campaign, including the Grimes side, is all political bashing and a waste of money that could be better used elsewhere in the state!"

If the people of like beliefs want to pool their money and build this, it is within their right to do so.   Can they only hire people of similar beliefs to work there - only if they are a church.  Churches don't pay income tax.  In fact I'm not sure churches pay taxes on anything.  Ultimately the hiring discrimination and questions about business or church will be settled in court, but by then the 18 million dollars in tax incentives that the people of Kentucky have invested in this will have evaporated with no return on investment in the form of larger tax base, tourism revenue, or jobs."

Kynect doesn't communicate with other state Medicaid computer sysytems and often issues coverage incorrectly.  Kynect has also had a negative effect on the state's previous Medicaid computer system (that is still being used) and causing it to often issue coverage incorrectly.  What's going to happen when the federal dollars run out in December and no state money is allowed, by law, to be spent on Kynect or MAGI Medicaid?"

We love our Thoroughbreds so you probably want to stop at Churchill Downs or Keeneland (Keeneland is in Lexington and the region, the grounds around the track and the racetrack its self is more beautiful than Churchill, in my opinion.)

I have Comcast.  I really don't understand all the Comcast hate.  They're constantly updating their system, increasing their bandwidth.  I pay $60 a month for the 50mbps package and always get more than that.  I average 55-60mbps download speed and 30mbps upload speed.  Don't get me wrong, I hate Comcast as a company due to their policies and the way they structure their television deals but on the internet side of things they've been nothing but great.  I started with Comcast internet in 2002 and the max was 6mbps/2mbps.  Due to their constant improvement of service those numbers have risen steadily over the past 12 years resulting in my current 55mbps/30mbps connection.

But getting on the air and telling us we'd be angry 'if only we knew', especially on a program that comes across as conspirarial, sounds like he (and other politicians; I'm not trying to make a party argument here) are exploiting a national tradgedy for attention.

Massie wants to make the documents open for journalists and citizens.  He has stated this...even at placing him at odds with his party.  He goes as far as to say that in his analysis, it would not harm our national safety but he is bound by law not to release any information. Its not like hes holding out until his prime time special.  Let me spell it out...This is an attempt to encourage the public action in demanding the documents declassified...or at the very least, to have your congressman go read them.  Most likely the documents are from the bush era.  I mean, if anyone else was saying this, it would be a liberals wet dream.  Grind away."

The idea being that of course religious organizations would want to hire people of their own religions. I believe they also do not pay taxes.  I think that if any organization takes public money, they should not have the exemptions traditionally enjoyed by religious organizations. This means that if Noah's Ark Theme Park took any public money, they would have to pay taxes and hire with no religious bias."

Kentucky,2bvzm4,fuzio,1 point,Tue Jul 29 16:51:51 2014 UTC,"Religious organizations are usually exempt from some taxes because they are non-profit organizations.  Non-religious non-profits like civil service groups, are exempt from the same type of taxes.  For-profit religious organizations (like Hobby Lobby, apparently...) aren't exempt from those taxes.  But even non-profit churches have to pay payroll taxes, and most of the other taxes related to employment.  You don't get a 100% free pass just because you use the religious label.  I do agree in principle that theme park employers shouldn't be allowed to discriminate against their potential employees based on religion.  However, unfortunately that's the way the law is written.  Religious corporations are allowed to discriminate on the basis of religion on any level of employee (from priests and pastors down to janitors and gardeners) because that's what was written into the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  It's the law, so Kentucky doesn't really have any justification in making an exception.    Personally I don't support this organization or what they stand for.  I also don't believe in wizards or dragons, but I would welcome tax breaks for a Harry Potter themepark in Kentucky if I thought it would bring tourism money to our state.

Fortunately, once Lending Club goes public (it's currently in the process of preparing for an IPO ""later thsi year""), anyone and everyone will be able to participate as a lender regardless of accredited investor status.  The idea behind the accredited investor requirement, if you're interested, is simply to try and prevent just anybody from taking your money and promising you a return. Put simply, the SEC has to put their stamp of approval on Lending Club before they can go public, which means there's no need for the additional precautionary measure that requires accredited investor status once LC receives the stamp of approval.

I ask people for years what McConnell has actually done for KY and all they seem to be able to say is ""Well, he's such a powerhouse, he holds so much clout for the state and brings money to the state"".    Really? Does he? Because it doesn't look like the state is seeing this alleged money at all.

Kentucky,2brxjb,fuzio,2,Tue Jul 29 16:46:07 2014 UTC,"Hes done amazing things for the state.  The reason Louisville is such a powerhouse in cancer research? Funding he brought in.  The reason the we have more paved roads then many 'modern' states? Mitch.  Head Start was started with funds he was able to provide as well.    He has also brought countless jobs into Kentucky indirectly, like with the cancer research."
Kentucky,2brxjb,fuzzyjedi,3,Tue Jul 29 17:13:13 2014 UTC,"So over 30 years, that's all you have?    Anyone who was in office would have pushed for that funding. Is there any evidence that had it been anyone but McConnell that we wouldn't have gotten the funding?    Same applies for the cancer research. Those are both issues that really any politician would get lambasted for not supporting.    Unless there's proof that we wouldn't have gotten the funding unless it was McConnell, those points are kind of moot. The democrats support those issues as well, it would be different if it was something only McConnell supported....but it's not.    Not to mention, that's merely 2 things over a 30 year time span.    From the government's own website; Number of students enrolled in Kentucky Head Start programs 14,665    Number of public school students 675,530    So all that funding helped a total of 4.6% of KY Students. Sure that's better than 0% but still, not many. (all numbers are for the 2011-12 school year)"
Kentucky,2brxjb,fuzio,2,Tue Jul 29 17:31:33 2014 UTC,"Head Start is voluntary in the state, so a lot if it comes down to the parents wish.  And yes, it would be better if more kids were enrolled, that isnt his job.  Ill have to get you the exact bill, but after we passed a law saying that roads had to be paved for x,y, and z reason, he was the one that got the funding through porkbelly funds, by himself, and used his political clout to get it passed.    The Toyota plant in Georgetown, one of the largest employers in the state, came to Kentucky because he was able to woo them and was able to get incentives for them by applying pressure to the local politicians from both parties.    These are just the things I remember off hand.  I had a long conversation with a guy I know recently about Mitch.  I was on the train to hatesville until he started breaking things down for me."
Kentucky,2brxjb,fuzzyjedi,2,Tue Jul 29 17:45:12 2014 UTC,"that isnt his job   Didn't say it was but you're trying to give him credit for it as if we had anyone else as a senator, we would have never gotten that money. I find that a bit hard to believe.     he was the one that got the funding through porkbelly funds, by himself, and used his political clout to get it passed.     If that's the case, then I'll happily give him credit for doing so. While I personally don't care about such things because it will never affect me in any manner (I avoid pretty much any city outside of Lexington and Louisville)     The Toyota plant in Georgetown, one of the largest employers in the state, came to Kentucky because he was able to woo them and was able to get incentives for them by applying pressure to the local politicians from both parties     Eh, while I was very young at the time I don't necessarily remember that. I don't see how he was able to hold much weight at the time since he had just been elected. (My father has worked there since the plant was built and I like to research political history like that)    Even so, I support term limits. He's been in office for ~30 years, it's time to elect someone new."
Kentucky,2brxjb,fuzio,1 point,Tue Jul 29 17:55:32 2014 UTC,"Just like with roads, the head start money was initially porkbelly money.  Thats something you hear a lot about him, his use of porkbelly in bills.  Its almost always something directly related to Kentucky.    Im not old enough to remember the Georgetown plant being built, but what I do remember is hearing Marshall Long (Kentucky House of Representatives, District 58, District 58, 1982-1998, Republican) give a speech about the plant in the mid-90's (I was friends with his granddaughter) and he spoke about Mitch coming to him and, as he put it, threatening to with draw his support of Marshall if he did not put his weight behind the plant being built. As a point of full disclosure, this could have been simply about the expansion the build engines there ~1990"

I was a long time Mitch hate until I started speaking with a guy I graduated high school with who is really into politics and he began giving examples on what he has done.  The three main examples that stood out to me (which I also listed in another comment) is money for cancer research, money for paved roads and money for Head Start.    These are things that brought a better quality of life to people, as well as propelling Kentucky into a better place through indirect job creation.

Ive listed this else where in the thread, but the fact that you can go almost anywhere in the state and have access to paved roads is a largely due to funds he brought in.  While that may not seem like the most exciting thing in the word, as someone who has spent a lot of time driving the roads in the state (right around 100,000 miles total) and speaking with people that live in some of the farthest reaches of the commonwealth, that alone is an amazing thing.  It gives many people a much more fair shake at work then they had before.    Ive met people that drive 100 miles a day to a job that pays them much better than they would have ever imagined that they could be paid, simply because the infrastructure is there, and travel in the state is so easy.

Things like education (despite the fact that many in the GOP want to dismantle the entire Dept of Education and let states run education.

Okay, so you mean to tell me without McConnell, that would have never been possible?    Again, a 30 year time span and all you can bring up is paved roads?

Kentucky,2brxjb,fuzzyjedi,1 point,Tue Jul 29 17:30:43 2014 UTC,"As far as paved roads, I am saying that with out him, over 40% of the roads in the commonwealth would not be paved.  And that would be a huge issue because we passed a law several years ago stating that if a road over a certain legnth was not paved, it would no longer get any state funding.    That was huge because that meant that the vast majority of the people who live here would no longer have access to public school transportation as well as not having confidence that they would be able to commute to and from work easily.    The cancer research was something that was a passion for him.  No one thought, at a nation level, that Kentucky would be the proper place to give tens of millions of dollars for medical research.  They felt, like most people who have never spent time here, that we were just a bunch of rednecks who didnt need it.  Mitch felt that not only was Kentucky perfectly advanced enough for it, but that the state with the highest cancer rate in the nation should also be the place that is at the cutting edge of how to save people."

Awfully fishy that has would drop .30 cent on the gallon over night.   The city isn't selling tobacco, sodas, or candy bars.. They don't even have bathrooms.

Kentucky,2blln3,Mr_Bro_Jangles,0,Sat Jul 26 01:42:47 2014 UTC,Ask any gas station you want where they make their money. Gas or items inside? Have you ever spoke with a C-Store owner? Probably not.

""Social ownership"" may refer to cooperative enterprises, common ownership, state ownership, citizen ownership of equity, or any combination of these.  What do you think it means?"

Kentucky,2blln3,Smokezilla,1 point,Thu Jul 24 16:37:28 2014 UTC,"Just curious, what level of profit constitutes price gouging?"
Kentucky,2blln3,Teelo888,5,Fri Jul 25 01:27:47 2014 UTC,"It's not equated to the level of profit.  It's gouging when you see one gas station chain controlling the price levels across the entire area and raising prices based on when they know more people will be on the roads (a holiday, a festival is in town, etc.) rather than supply and demand.  You can't tell me that raising prices a dime on the gallon just because it's time for the government checks to be dispersed at the first of the month is just coincidental."
Kentucky,2blln3,Smokezilla,4,Fri Jul 25 01:41:27 2014 UTC,I think you just defined the laws of supply and demand
Kentucky,2blln3,Mr_Bro_Jangles,4,Fri Jul 25 04:27:19 2014 UTC,"I believe you are correct, but when you see a pattern unfold that's basically just taking advantage of people, I see it as being predatory and unfair.  I just calls 'em like I sees 'em.  :-)"
Kentucky,2blln3,Smokezilla,-1,Fri Jul 25 11:24:14 2014 UTC,"So by your logic, as long as a company is consistently ""gouging"" without change then it's ok.  But once they do so on a inconsistent basis, it's time for government to step in.  Because, you do know that many other businesses and industries have higher profit margins than gas station owners, right?"
Kentucky,2blln3,Mr_Bro_Jangles,2,Fri Jul 25 05:42:45 2014 UTC,"I also know that the individual gas station owners barely make anything on the price of the gas they're selling unless the station is owned by the oil company.  It's not saying inconsistency makes it worse than being consistent.  Gouging is gouging.  I'm never said other businesses don't do it, either.  I believe that you're playing Devil's Advocate, my friend.  My opinion:  If you were in Somerset, you'd be buying gas at this station, too."
Kentucky,2blln3,cdstigall,1 point,Fri Jul 25 11:22:54 2014 UTC,"It's not saying inconsistency makes it worse than being consistent.  Gouging is gouging. I'm never said other businesses don't do it, either.   So, to be clear...Your definition of ""Gouging"" or being ""predetory"" does not rely upon prices that go up and down.  So...if you want to control these ""unfair"" practices in a fair way, you will need to address the businesses with the most egregious profit margins...here are a list of the top 10 small businesses taking the most ""advantage"" of people.   CPA : 16.5% pretax margin Chiropractors: 15.3% Ambulatory Emergency Centers: 15% Other Accounting 14.9% Dentists 14.7% Tax Preparation 14.7% Orthodontists: 14.4% Lawyers: 13.4% Financing: 13.3% Portfolio Management: 12.2% Link   Also, do you really think the city using tax dollars to buy gasoline from the oil company the same way other gas stations do is sticking it to the big bad oil company?    The only people you are hurting are the local owners/operators and employees of the gas station.  If you think they are getting too rich off of price gouging, you've got a lot of other businesses to turn over to government control first.  I'm gonna bet that the local accountant wont be happy with the mayor if he decides to open a city run CPA office at discount prices."

When someone tries to open a new one, he lowers prices attge nearest station to rock bottom until the new place closes, then jacks the price back up.  Tiwn got tired of being screwed iver, so they bought gas wholesale.  This is justice."

Kentucky,2blln3,cdstigall,1 point,Fri Jul 25 00:59:29 2014 UTC,"Surprise, you introduce competition into a market and prices drop precipitously. Rather than going the bust-the-oligopoly route trying to charge them with illegal collusion, where there's less antitrust legislation, they beat them back into shape simply by opening an inexpensively run gas station. (Really, refurbished the city gas station into a public one.) Kudos.  The business owners in this case don't really have a leg to stand on - if they were playing fair with the market, nobody in the city government would have felt a need to do anything to change the situation. Instead, they colluded to jack up prices 30 cents more than the surrounding area."
Kentucky,2blln3,SpackleButt,1 point,Fri Jul 25 12:33:11 2014 UTC,Well said.
Kentucky,2blln3,Mr_Bro_Jangles,2,Sat Jul 26 06:07:45 2014 UTC,So these people are using their tax dollars to buy the city gas...then paying for the gas again?
Kentucky,2blln3,cdstigall,2,Thu Jul 24 23:52:53 2014 UTC,You are correct.  The implication that government money/services is not only free but efficient is hilarious.  Either these people don't pay taxes or have no idea how this government thing works.
Kentucky,2blln3,Mr_Bro_Jangles,4,Fri Jul 25 14:23:42 2014 UTC,The city already owned the bulk plant where the station is located.. It only cost them $68k to be able to sell to the public. $60k was to service/perform maintenance on the fuel tanks (which they were going to have to do anyhow.). People just got fed up of seeing Somerset's fuel prices the highest out of all the surrounding areas. The city council tried to request that the distributors explain why prices are the way they are but they all refused.. Said it was a free market.
Kentucky,2blln3,cdstigall,2,Fri Jul 25 01:03:21 2014 UTC,"The ""already owned"" bulk plant was purchased two years ago for $200,000."
Kentucky,2blln3,Mr_Bro_Jangles,-2,Fri Jul 25 14:30:25 2014 UTC,Yes.. For the city's vehicles. What's your point?
Kentucky,2blln3,cdstigall,3,Sat Jul 26 01:28:26 2014 UTC,Are the other stations in town getting to use the $200k taxpayer funded bulk plant.  I'm gonna guess not
Kentucky,2blln3,Mr_Bro_Jangles,-2,Sat Jul 26 01:37:00 2014 UTC,Why would they need to?
Kentucky,2blln3,Teelo888,3,Sat Jul 26 01:54:19 2014 UTC,If you want to encourage fair competition then the other stations should get to use the free (taxpayer funded) tanks instead of having to purchase and maintain their own.   Because as you might imagine buying and maintaining tanks it's an expense that the other stations have to account for with revenue...but not the city run station.

Your interests fall in line with what the college promotes, and there are often guest speakers, even open to the public, on many of the issues that interest you. There are hiking trails in the area and many folks bike.  Most of the locals are lovely, though you might run into the occasional redneck from the Southern part of the county.   Berea's massive drawback is that it is a dry town, and you would have to go to Richmond to buy booze. Also, Lexington isn't far away.

It's commonly called the Lautenberg Amendment. It's federal, not state.  It seems motherjones is bunching their panties over TROs not requiring surrending your firearms. But you can get a TRO against almost anyone with a ""he said / she said"" argument.  The point of the new legislation was to let women who filed TROs apply to conceal carry much faster than the normal process takes.  The problem was a women is beaten/threatened, and leaves, files a TRO, files for a CCDW, and gets killed while she waited for the paperwork to process.  The new legislation lets women who feel their life is threatened enough to carry a gun, do so legally, without someone losing all their guns because a vindictive acquaintance claimed he was threatened."

Hell, maybe if I had stayed with it I would have kept the trim muscles I got from it. Haha  I never got nicotine poisoning. I imagine it could be an issue, but I just never did, regardless of my arms getting covered in sap. Would I want it for my kids? I don't know, when they are old enough it's their choice to make. If they don't like it for the money, then they won't do it again.  Only time I saw kids younger than 13 on the field, they were bringing out water and such.

My younger siblings have never even touched it out in the field or hanging or stripping it.    We all knew that smoking and tobacco was bad for your health, I've never used it.

Don't believe me? its a thing.   kids are tougher than what we think   This is true.   talking to teenagers who work in fields   Sooooooo, why are the kids working in field?  The farmer who is employing them I don't think rounded them up and forced them to work with a whip?  Why not ask these kids parents why they are letting them work?  Also, surprise, I think we all know there are asshole people out there that we all work for.....   nicotine poisoning   Yeah, its a thing.  Thats why you wear gloves, hydrate, and watch yourself.  It can happen to everyone, not just kids.  I've only seen it happen to people who are super careless in the way they handle themselves around it for days on end.  They don't talk about HOW you get poisoning, just that it exists.  Scare tactic.  Oh darn, buying a pair of gloves is sooooo hard.

You will find someone with a car and/or can go once a week to Richmond on the shuttle to hang out for 5 hours around the mall.  Papaleno's is delicious. Don't get too addicted to Mario's because it'll kill you haha. The Village Trough is trying to get some more events sorted out like concerts, festivals once a month, stuff like that. The only thing that is better in Richmond is restaurants where you can drink,a movie theatre, and shopping, and you're a college student so you won't have that extra money anyway.

I'm sure the friends you meet at Berea will be taking you to EKU parties every weekend.   When you're in the party mood 10 minutes of driving is nothing.  It's the non-party stuff that will get on your nerves.  Having to drive to Richmond for basic things like buying shoes, watching a movie or picking up a new video game will get on your nerves eventually.    I'm sure you'll have a good time.

Kentucky,2a5evc,Re-AnImAt0r,4,Tue Jul 8 16:24:19 2014 UTC,"I used to live in Eastern, Ky (Pike then Letcher Counties) and this blog is bullshit.  There is a lot wrong with Eastern, Ky.  I still have numerous extended family members who live there.   First let's talk about the socially acceptable rampant welfare/social security fraud that goes on in the area.  Half of the population are perfectly happy being poor (as you the author is) except that they take advantage of all of the public assistance programs available to the poor.  They do it not because they are unable to work but because they are simply lazy and were raised just as their parents and grandparents were raised, to think that growing up and living on welfare, foodstamps, etc. is a legitimate career path.  It's not even socially frowned upon because so many people do it.  Living off of government assistance is a way of life in the area.  This region is a parasite to both our state and federal governments.   You guys would not believe how many people in the mountains have their children declared with a mental disability before they're even a teenager to get an extra social security check while they are children and have them already completely set up to take advantage of the government assistance programs before they turn 18 years old.  I'm not typing about legitimate disabilities.  I'm typing about masses of people qualifying for a ""crazy check"" (that is what they call it) for life at 11 years old. Now let's talk about the lack of education in the area.  I'm not even speaking of the low rate of HIGHER education.  I'm speaking of high school graduation.  A large number of the population never even graduate high school.  It, again, is socially acceptable there.  Why do you need to graduate high school to draw a welfare check?  You don't.  Since so many people raise their children to believe that living on welfare or social security disability is the proper career path to take, they never instill an importance on education.  They view it as completely unnecessary.  School is viewed as daycare for their children until they are around 13 years old and can look after themselves.  Then it's optional.  The kid can either go to school or do whatever else they want as long as they're not around the house bothering the parents all day. Now let's talk about the drugs you mention in your blog.  The drug culture is insane in the mountains.  You've got all of these people not working, drawing government assistance so what do they do with their time?  They do drugs.  It's not even a secret.  You know if you want some marijuana, all you have to do is head up 3 Mile hollow and stop at any house.    It's all done in the open and there's no reason for them to hide it.  The (very small) local police doesn't even go into these areas.  They know they are outgunned so everything has a blind eye turned toward it.  Prescription medication abuse is rampant in the area.  These people getting their ""crazy checks"" get prescriptions for opiates for the sole purpose of selling them to have disposable income.   Again, they don't even hide it.  It's socially acceptable there.  How else is a person to get a few extra dollars when they need it?  Uncle Sam isn't going to give you an extra $100 on your welfare or SSI check because you want to take your family to a movie this month.   Mountain culture (not just in eastern Ky, the entire Appalachian mountains) is completely different than anywhere else on earth.  If you're an honest person you work in the coal mines or for the state government (railroad, road crew, etc.).  If you're family is ""rich"" as determined in the mountains, you own your own business.  Everybody else lives on one form of government assistance or another.   Some actually need this assistance and really do have a condition preventing them from work but the percentage of those people is so miniscule that it hardly even bares mention.   I lived there for 6 years and moving my family away from the mountains was the best thing my parents could have done for my family.   The poverty and despair you witness there on a daily basis just sucks the soul right out of you.  If any of you were wondering, my extended family members who still live there are no different than the rest.  I do not see them and do not talk to them.  They are no better than the rest.    All they know is poverty, all they see is poverty and nothing will ever change in that region.  Anybody not drawing a welfare check, foodstamps or ssi disability is rich.  This is all a way of life for these people.  All of it socially acceptable and out in the open."
Kentucky,2a5evc,Re-AnImAt0r,3,Thu Jul 10 04:50:49 2014 UTC,"For anybody wanting to know about eastern kentucky, I suggest you watch the documentary ""The Wild and Wonderful Whites of West Virginia"".  It's available on Netflix and Amazon Prime.   While the documentary is about a family in West Virginia, it could have just as easily been filmed in Pike county Kentucky.  It's all the same mountain culture."
Kentucky,2a5evc,Re-AnImAt0r,2,Thu Jul 10 05:15:15 2014 UTC,"I'll give you some upvotes for this because I agree, but I think ""The Wild and Wonderful Whites of West Virginia"" isn't a fair example for the majority. Those people are definitely at the extreme end of the spectrum. You are totally correct about the fraud and the culture. To sum up your points in one sentence, I think Eastern Kentucky's problems all boil down to a fundamental flaw in ideology. Even those people who aren't crooks and swindlers looking for a check are raised with a totally backwards mindset.   A big part of what makes up Appalachian culture is a particular stubbornness when it comes to change and the acceptance of outsiders. I mean this goes all the way back to settlers; it's part of what makes us who we are. I think these ideologies come in two categories: the ""crazy check"" types who teach their kids the government will take care of them, and the coal supporters who think that the coal companies will take care of them by keeping the economy moving.  I won't even bother to address the ""crazy check"" types because I don't think their wrongs need any explaining. The problem with the coal lovers are their complete and utter devotion to a money making machine that has burned them several times over. Coal is on the out; it's no secret. What really astounds me is that coal supporters totally neglect the fact that coal companies have raped and pillaged Eastern Kentucky for generations. When the coal dries up, the companies leave the towns to rot and the people to fend for themselves. I mean post-war Germany looked less bombed-out than some of the coal towns you can find in Eastern Kentucky. It's ridiculous, but what makes it more ridiculous is that somehow after all that it is still socially acceptable to tell your kids to drop out of high school at the age of 16 and go work in the mines. It's crazy.   So here we are. We have an entire microcosm of society that's full of young, uneducated workers who have a very limited skill set, and that's for those who even work. Why get a job when you can go on the draw? Why waste time in school when you can make the big bucks in the mines? It's all a damn shame. Pills pills pills. Coal coal coal. The pills need to go. I know so many pill addicts that it's mind-boggling, and it's not just Billy Jack who runs the excavator on the hill. I know doctors, lawyers, and teachers addicted to prescription drugs. Eastern Kentucky also needs to get themselves a 21st century mindset and face facts that coal is done, and that it's time to move forward like the rest of the world. I don't know what could be done to save Eastern Kentucky. It's like sending someone to rehab; rehab only works when the person wants change, and Eastern Kentucky doesn't want change.  Oh and just so we're on the same page, my family is from Floyd and Knott counties. I was born and raised in Floyd, I actually just visited for the holiday, but I definitely don't live there anymore."

Going to bars? hmmm...depnds on what you're hoping to get.  Think $5+tip for drinks....some will be a bit more, some a bit less...but that's probably a good average.  Food?  Kentucky has very few significantly distinctive foods.  The Kentucky Hotbrown is always a good choice.  In general, KY is a meat and potatoes place....southern cuisine which is typical for most nearby states.  If you get a chance, just for bragging rights, be sure to eat at the Kentucky Fried Chick in Corbin, Kentucky as it's the very first KFC.  Kentucky is an awesome state overall...especially during the summer and fall.  (It's ugly in the winter, though).  The people are very, very friendly and they love people with accents.  They'll love you.  In fact, if in a restaurant and you talk to the waiter/waitresses and tell them you're here on a contest, they'll likely enjoy your story and want to hear more.

No problem, as your above the smoking and drinking ages (18 and 21). I don't smoke myself, but you should try some of the bourbon, since we're famous for it. I recommend Maker's Mark and Jim Bean personally.  I'm under the drinking age, so I haven't been to bars. Sorry : There's lots of BBQ in Kentucky, so I'd recommend that. In my hometown (Owensboro, KY), there's a slogan that we're the World Capitol of BBQ, and while I don't know how true it is, we have some good places. Moonlight BBQ is pretty famous (I'm pretty sure President Clinton was quite the fan and eats there when he comes to town), as well as Old Hickory (their pulled mutton is tasty).    I'd also suggest places like Mammoth Cave as a must-see, since it's the world's largest cave system, with new tunnels still being discovered.

Kentucky,29o617,dfromrc,7,Thu Jul 3 17:39:30 2014 UTC,"Western Kentuckian, here!  Kentucky is safe, beautiful, and wonderful!  You'll find most of the people you meet on your trip to be very friendly, and you're more likely to be met with interest rather than animosity for being German.   Smoking will pose little to no problem. Cigarettes are cheaper in KY than anywhere else in the United States, so there are plenty of smokers around the state. You won't be able to smoke indoors in most cities but no one is going to give you evil looks for smoking outside. Actually, you'll probably meet a lot of people this way.  Alcohol shouldn't be much of a problem as most towns are at least 'moist' (meaning alcohol can be sold at restaurants), and the price will vary. I know in my little western towns, beers range from $2.50 (PBR) to $6.50 (anything imported, or fancier than your typical big name American beers, mixed drinks hover around $6 or $7 and shots are all over the place based on the tier of the liquor. Louisville and Lexington will be more expensive, but as long as you aren't going to super fancy bars you shouldn't have to worry. KY is famous for Bourbon, so definitely hit up some stops on the Bourbon trail if you can!  Food-wise, several KY towns are pretty proud of their barbecue. I also agree with everyone suggesting the Hot Brown, it is a magical thing. If you're here in the west (and it's still summer), stop by Belew's in Aurora (by Kentucky Lake) for cheap and delicious burgers and shakes... but be prepared to wait a while for it, it's a very popular stop. Otherwise, nothing says Kentucky like fried catfish.  Hope you have a great time!"
Kentucky,29o617,SilentLurker,3,Wed Jul 2 20:27:23 2014 UTC,"To add, if you come to western ky anywhere on Kentucky Lake is worth visiting. If it's summer and you can afford it, rent a boat and spend the day on the lake. Go to the rock quarry with the the alcohol you buy in a dry county. I would suggest passing on  ""Belews"" for food. It just isn't worth waiting am hour and a half to two hours for the same cheeseburger they sell at the local Dairy Queen. Instead visit Land between the Lakes The Homplace. You take a tour of what life was like in the 1800's and you can have supper afterwards."
Kentucky,29o617,Fleiger133,1 point,Wed Jul 2 21:48:34 2014 UTC,The reason I suggest Belew's is primarily because it's OP's first trip to the US and the old-school mom-n-pop burger stand is a pretty classic American experience. I don't think I've ever waited that long-- but it's definitely not worth a two hour wait.
Kentucky,29o617,SilentLurker,7,Thu Jul 3 16:13:59 2014 UTC,"Slightly Conservative on average, but southern hospitality abounds.  You'll find the people friendly and they'll be delighted to meet tourists.  The Lederhosen might garner giggles.  There's no hostility towards Germans.  1) very safe  2) tobacco is cheap here  3) depends on the bar and if you are drinking domestics. Take $30-$50 and you should be good.  Try Kentucky Ale and Bluegrass Brewing Company (BBC)  4) YES!  Kentucky Hotbrown, Burgoo, Catfish, Cornbread, Greens, Grits. Derby Pie, Goetta, Bourbon Balls (KFC STINKS since the Colonel died)  5) You didn't ask, but you need to know... BOURBON!  While you are here:   Mixed Drinks:Mint Julep, Kentucky Mule.    Then try some straight room temp. SIP IT. Don't shoot it.  Good ones to try: Woodford Reserve, Blanton Single Barrel, Eagle Rare."
Kentucky,29o617,dsyncd,5,Thu Jul 3 02:09:10 2014 UTC,"I hope you have a good time.  If your trip brings you through deep Southeastern Kentucky, I'll buy you a beer.

Kentucky,29o617,thanatocoenosis,7,Thu Jul 3 00:26:08 2014 UTC,"I live in Russell Springs, KY(south central) around Lake Cumberland.  I think you'll find that most people here are very friendly and interested in meeting international tourists.  I'm sure you would get some funny looks in Lederhosen, though.  Dangerous? -  Not really.  It depends on where you go, but you'll be fine most everywhere.  I would not go walking through the woods in eastern KY alone but I assume you have some sort of itinerary.  Alcohol/Cigs - There are some dry counties where you cannot buy alcohol(I actually live in one) but most places you can.  There is a lot of tobacco grown in KY and, not sure if related, seem to be quite a lot of smokers too.  Bars and restaurants in Louisville and Lexington don't allow smoking inside but you can in a lot of other areas.  Just ask or look for an ash tray.  Bar prices - First off, our beer is not as good as your beer.  If you come to KY, you need to try the bourbon.  We are famous for it and there is a wide range of prices usually depending on how old it is.  Go to as many distilleries as you can and you can try free samples to find what you like best.  To address the beer, there are quite a few small breweries scattered all over KY as well and some have some pretty good beers.  Just ask for something local.  Good local brews should cost around $3-$5 each I would imagine.  Food - You could try a KY Hot Brown.  Sounds gross but is pretty good.  It was created at the Brown Hotel in Louisville.  If you see Ski(citrus soda) in a store, grab one.  I'm sure I'm leaving out some things.  If you travel around Lake Cumberland, message me.  We actually have two German manufacturing plants in Russell Springs.  Good luck and have fun!"

There is a strong German heritage here, and well lederhosen aren't unheard of, but no one really wears them outside of Oktoberfest. There is a Hofbrauhaus in Newport, which would be silly not to go to because it's awesome. They also serve a KY hot brown there that is phenomenal. Do you get to choose your destinations or is there an itinerary of sorts?   Also, I'm not sure if they have it further south, but up here we have this lovely breakfast item called goetta. Basically a sort of sausage made with pork and oats."

Kentucky,29o617,Skanky,1 point,Tue Jul 8 14:48:39 2014 UTC,"There's one in Vegas, and one in Shittsburgh. There used to be one in Tokyo. As far as I know, the one in Newport is the only one officially affiliated with the original. That reminds me also that The Party Source, just dow the street from the Hofbrauhaus, is the largest alcohol distributor in North America with a Bourbon distillery and a brewery and bar on site. It is truly one of Northern Kentucky's greatest tourist attractions, whether or not tourists know it yet. I had the luxury of growing up 5 minutes away from it, and I take all of my friends from out of town there immediately."

Kentucky,29o617,kerneldashiki,3,Thu Jul 3 02:19:36 2014 UTC,"Not dangerous at all, alcohol/tobacco is no problem, but you will probably have to smoke outside. Try the BBQ, burgoo (a stew of sorts), check out the Bourbon trail. Also, check out couchsurfing.com  You can meet up with some interesting people there. I've had couch surfers from Boston to Finland crash on my couch and it's always been a wonderful experience. I would love to host you for a night or two, but I'm not living in ky anymore.

We have the best barbecue   earth, I recommend the sampler plate so you don't miss out on anything. Also visit the Miller House, they have the widest selection of bourbon in the country (nearly 400), and they're #1 on the Bourbon Trail. Depending on when you'll be here, I actually organize music festivals and events and you can feel free to PM me and I'll show you a good time!"
Kentucky,29o617,paganize,2,Thu Jul 3 03:21:10 2014 UTC,"A lot of people might be closed minded but southern hospitality is big here so most people will be happy to see a tourist and help them out.  In a lot of places in Kentucky German heritage is dominant but I'd say most people don't know much about the country their great grandparents are from. Most of Kentucky Is very safe, open carry is a thing but it's not a big deal most likely to see a hunter in a rural area then someone walking around the city with a gun.  Just try to find out if there are any dangerous areas in each city/ county you visit.  Expect to pay from 2-7 dollars per beer just depending on the type of bar you go to and where it is.  Make sure to get bourbon while you are here it is cheap and plentiful.  And Kentucky has some of the lowest taxes on tobacco so it's cheap to smoke here.  Have any questions just message me."

I'm guessing you'll be going to Bardstown to see the distilleries.  Make sure to go to Maker's Mark - it's gorgeous.  Tours end early though, so keep that in mind.  Call ahead.  Mammoth Cave is incredible - I'm sure you have nothing like that in Germany.  If you're going to be here in the summertime, prepare for oppressive heat, humidity, and thunderstorms.    The people here are wonderful, friendly, and will love your accent.  Remember that most people here are very simple and conservative in their views, so just avoid hot topics like religion, politics, abortion, etc. And you'll be fine.  Be warned, bringing up a sports-related topic might get you trapped in a very long conversation.  Many here are fanatical about sports, especially college basketball, golf, and football.

We have a murder every so often and robberies on occasion but I'd say for the most part it isn't anything to concern yourself about. Alcohol/tobacco is np. The best advice I can give you about eating is to accept the invitation to dinner. You will get 1 at some point and a lot of families have big Sunday dinners, barbeques, cookouts etc, especially this time of year. You'll eat better than you would in any restaurant. Also, we don't lynch people. You might get some strange looks and a lot of curious people and a few laughs if you show up somewhere in Lederhosen but nothing bad."

My recommendations:   Catch a college football game at either University of Kentucky or University of Louisville. Tickets are generally cheap. Drink Kentucky Bourbon Barrel on tap somewhere. Make a trip to Cincinnati (right across the river on the northern tip of Kentucky). It's a German-heritage city (Oktoberfest, German-inspired brews, German-inspired town names, etc.), and Newport, KY which is at the very tip of the state has one of the few Hofbrauhaus' in the country.

I think I remember Simon Cowell taking a local saying as a threat when they were doing American Idol crap here.  Don't get me wrong though, there are plenty ignorant people around though.   Bourbon and Craft Beer is our specialties.  Country Boy IPA, Kentucky Bourbon Barrel Ale, West Sixth are local Lexington beers.  For bourbon, just walk into a Liquor Barn store and stare at all the options out there.  A decent bourbon will run between $30-$60 range for a fifth.  Tobacco is our number 1 ""legal"" cash crop. Depending how much you drink and what you drink while out.  Domestic beers: $2.50 to $4 a piece.  Good beers are around $5.  Well drinks are around $5.   Hotbrowns are delicious but they sit heavy on the stomach and have a lot of calories, but damn they are good.  Beer cheese is pretty unique in the south.  Ale8one and Ski soda.  Any small BBQ place will probably be very tasty.     If you can, check out Mammoth Cave and Red River Gorge.  Miguel's Pizza is a must for the Gorge trip.  It's nothing to special though but it's a stop for us every time we go. http://www.kentuckytourism.com/outdoor-adventure/  Lakes, we have some of the nicest lakes.  A lot of big houseboats and offshore racing boats.  Lake Cumberland, Dale Hallow, Cave Run Lake...  Louisville is our big city.  Lexington is City/Country mixed.    We get a decent amount of good music from bands passing through.  If you're in Louisville on a Wednesday afternoon, they have a band play down near the waterfront.  In Lexington on Thursdays, they do a ""Thursday Night Live"" but all it is really are people drinking out in the pavilion area down town by the bars.  Enjoy your trip!"

My good friend from Köln has been here a few times and she really likes it :) I don't think you have anything to worry about in terms of safety.   One thing to consider: pack for warmer weather than you're used to. I went to Germany in June and it was so cold compared to what I'm used to in KY. In September it will probably be about 23-25 degrees celsius. So pack a lot of short sleeves and maybe a light jacket and you should be fine.  Tchuss!
Kentucky,29o617,caliph_24,2,Thu Jul 3 15:52:03 2014 UTC,i just had some business associates come in from Denmark for a week and they had a blast.  When we would go out to eat the women would try to take pictures with them.
Kentucky,29o617,niccig,2,Thu Jul 3 16:47:02 2014 UTC,"Central Kentuckian here, (just north of Lexington actually)   I recommend the bourbon trail, touring the Toyota factory in my hometown, Cumberland falls (one of two places in the world that has the moonbow), Cumberland gap, Cumberland lake, mammoth cave, corvette museum, and touring the corvette factory too.    For food I highly recommend going to the original KFC in Corbin (close to Cumberland falls and lake btw).   It's not dangerous here at all really. Just treat people nice and most kentuckians are the friendliest people I know.  Yeah we have some rude ass people but who doesn't.   For alcohol it depends on what part of the state you're in. Some counties are dry counties which means you cannot sell alcohol in that county, others only allow them in restaurants. For tobacco most public buildings don't allow smoking in them but tobacco is a big part of Kentucky life so if you smoke it won't be a problem for most people.    I've only Been to a bar a couple of times but it's about $5 plus tip on average. $3 usually of beer IIRC.   Kentucky is an open carry state so there is a chance you'll see someone carrying a firearm but don't be alarmed by it.  If you go to a store odds are for every open carrying person you see 50 more are concealed carrying.  Kentucky has a big gun culture (we have the highest gun to citizen ratio in the country). I highly recommend that if you can try and get to shoot with someone.  Just be safe.   PM me if you have any questions about anything and I'll do the best I can to help answer then for you.  Hope you enjoy your trip to Kentucky and if you're in the Lexington/Georgetown area send me a message and if I can I'll show you around a bit, gives me a chance to practice what little German I remember from high school lol."

Kentucky,29o617,light_sucks,2,Thu Jul 3 18:17:42 2014 UTC,"As far as safety goes, I think your only issues would be in the ""bad"" parts of the larger cities. I've traveled all over most of the state taking pictures of trains, and in the rural areas I've rarely had any issues. I've heard stories from friends encountering folks who were a little suspicious but I've never ran into anyone like that. Lots of tourist-y things to do here. Cumberland Falls, Mammoth Cave, my hometown of Bardstown has a lot of historic stuff. I'd also suggest checking out Pine Mountain for the heck of it, the view from Chained Rock is nice."
Kentucky,29o617,bigtaterman,2,Thu Jul 3 20:17:58 2014 UTC,"Not dangerous at all.  Most people are very friendly.  Their friendliness may even begin to annoy you after a while.  Of course you can carry open but most people will probably shy away and think you strange for doing so as there's absolutely no reason to.   You will be very annoyed with this.  I am and I live here.  Many counties in the state are ""dry"" meaning it is illegal to buy alcohol in those counties.  Also, the horrible smoking bans that have been sweeping our nation in the past few years have taken hold here as well.  In most places it's basically illegal to smoke inside of a building or even within 15 feet of an entrance to that building.  If you're in a town that can serve alcohol you will thoroughly frustrated that you can't even sit in a bar and smoke a cigarette while you drink your beer. Smoking is pretty much limited to your home and vehicle.  As a visitor you will not even be able to smoke in your home away from home as in most places you cannot even smoke inside the hotel room you have rented.   depends on how much of a drinker you are.  Plan on about $5 a drink.  It's customary to tip as well.  Waitresses here earn their living off of tips.  If you go out drinking, go ahead and give the waitress a $20 tip when she brings you your first drink.  She'll make sure you get good service the rest of the night.   Nothing specific to this state.  You will want to try the southern cuisine though.  It's common all across the mid-west and southern regions."

Kentucky,29kpfh,leo_jones,10,Tue Jul 1 23:13:34 2014 UTC,"In my experience, most rural Kentuckians don't really care. As long as you aren't bothering them, what you do in your own time is your own business. Even folks who are against gay relationships/marriage typically won't bring it up unless prompted. There's always a few loud & preachy types, but most folks are of the ""if you don't bother me, I won't bother you"" variety. And the younger generations are more accepting of the whole thing.  That said, my partner and I aren't very affectionate in public, nor do we announce our relationship unprompted. For some folks, that can fall into the ""you're bothering me"" zone, and we'd rather not get into that kind of trouble out here. Luckily our landlord and neighbor are very accepting, and my co-workers have been cool with it.  Can't speak much for the more urban areas. I lived in Louisville for a couple years, but in a bad part of town and didn't get out much."
Kentucky,29kpfh,MasqueRaccoon,4,Wed Jul 2 00:17:25 2014 UTC,"In my experience, most rural Kentuckians don't really care. As long as you aren't bothering them, what you do in your own time is your own business.   You must have had a wonderful experience. I grew up in Georgetown (not rural KY) and had the most demeaning, horrible and tormented experience of my life as a teen. Death threats, attempted assaults, being chased by guys in a pickup with bats and 2x4s yelling ""die faggot"", people calling my home threatening to kill me and my parents, etc. and that was just while I was in high school.    If you being yourself in public falls in the zone of ""bothering"" other people, they need a reality check. If they can hold hands, kiss or hug their SO in public, so can I. I don't go around doing it just to do it in public but I'm not going to purposefully not do something just so other people won't have an issue with it.    It's my life and I'll live how I want and within reason, show affection to my SO in public. I don't care if I'm in London, Louisville or Pikeville."

Kentucky,29kpfh,Re-AnImAt0r,2,Sun Jul 6 12:18:03 2014 UTC,"Sexual relations outside of marriage it wrong, regardless of gender orientation, and marriage is designed to be between only a man and a women.  That's the standard I'm going to live my life, I'm going to make it clear that I believe those standards are universal, but so long as they don't pick my pocket or break my bone I'm not going to be bothered much by what others do. The shock was simply because I had never seen that before, and I wasn't expecting to for one reason or another."
Kentucky,29kpfh,CEsTJF,0,Sun Jul 6 13:43:02 2014 UTC,"I find it admirable that you have an opinion, can easily explain your opinion and are intelligent enough to realize that it is YOUR opinion and do not stand on a soap box preaching how all others should share your opinion.  This world would be a lot nicer place to live if everybody conducted themselves as such. I respect your opinion but I look at it the opposite way.   Marriage is a union in which two partners love one another enough to pledge themselves to each other for the rest of their lives, forsaking all others.  Homosexuality pre-dates civilization and all aspects of it, including marriage.  I feel that it was wrong to exclude them from marriage, 10 years ago, 100 years ago, 1000 years ago, etc.  To further deny them participation in the very same socially accepted union we heterosexuals have had access to since it's inception would simply be perpetrating another wrong and 2 wrongs (many more in this case) do not make a right.  It's time we stopped excluding  them from our clubs as though we are superior and they are not good enough.  Two homosexual men or two homosexual women are in no way inferior to my wife or myself and therefor should be granted the same rights and privileges as us.  I view homosexuals being denied marriage in the past the same as I view women being deprived the right to vote in the past or blacks not being allowed to eat in the same restaurant or use the same drinking fountain as we whites.    Social engineering to designate one group of people as being superior to another group of people.   Every human being on this earth was equally created by God and none among us have the right claim superiority over another. That is my opinion.  Your opinion differs on the subject but I can respect that.  This world would be an incredibly boring place if we all had the same opinions."
Kentucky,29kpfh,Re-AnImAt0r,2,Sun Jul 6 16:34:03 2014 UTC,"Well thank you. I should also add that I don't think it should be illegal, but that they also shouldn't force Religious institutions or private businesses to be involved in it either.  I believe it would be wrong to force a church to hold a marriage ceremony if they don't want to and I also think it was wrong when that gay couple sued the cake business to make a cake for them.  You're right, they should be able to live how they want but that right goes two ways as well, in neither case are they preventing a gay couple from getting married, they can find another church and another cake shop."
Kentucky,29kpfh,CEsTJF,0,Sun Jul 6 16:40:26 2014 UTC,"I understand what you're saying and honestly I don't even know what my opinion on that is.  I mean, I understand that every religion should be allowed to operate as they wish but then I think, ""well, this is 2014.  would it be okay if a religion decided they didn't want to serve blacks?  or women?   would it be okay if Chick-Fil-et decided it was no longer going to allow black people to buy chicken sandwiches anymore?""  I honestly don't know.  At some point, I don't know when, hard decisions would have to be made by somebody a whole lot smarter than me to decide if legally allowing a business to discriminate against a segment of the population due to religious beliefs or any other beliefs was more important than putting all this hatred, bigotry or segregation behind us and continue to evolve together as 1 race, the human race.    I mean, it seems like it will have to happen sometime eventually even if it's 100 years from now.  If a man wants to open a burger joint but doesn't want to serve black people, he doesn't open up a burger joint.  It would be against the law for the man to discriminate, not serve, a person just because he doesn't personally like something about the man.   As such, he never opens up that burger joint because he knows he can't legally discriminate against people he doesn't like.   I believe these people who just don't like homosexuals will have to make the same choice.  Let go of their petty bigotry or just not operate a business.   I mean, it's not like who a person falls in love with has any baring on a burger transaction.  A black man, a white woman or a homosexual are all just as capable of handing the guy $4 for a hamburger.  The color of their skin, their sex nor who they love should have any baring on it."
Kentucky,29kpfh,Re-AnImAt0r,2,Mon Jul 7 07:57:45 2014 UTC,"I would say that they should be allowed to do that, if someone want's to be racist then they should be able to be racist.  My reasoning behind this is because no one is forcing a black guy to go to a racist restaurant.  The government shouldn't be discriminatory, like what happened from slavery all through the civil rights era, because the government is a public entity.  A private business or organization isn't.  I don't think people should be racist, but I do think they have the right to be racist if they decide to."

Kentucky,297xiu,trueslicky,18,Fri Jun 27 05:49:43 2014 UTC,"The thing that absolutely drives me crazy about Eastern Kentucky is their insistence that coal is the only industry that can fix their tough situation. Coal may have given them a golden age, but coal was not a golden goose. Companies would move out of towns the second veins went dry--there was no loyalty to workers who had given decades or even generations to the company. And yet, many people in Eastern Kentucky believe that coal is the only industry that can save them. You can hear it whenever anyone does a story on Obama's new environmental regulations.   Other industries exist, and could theoretically be enticed to move into Eastern Kentucky. We need to stop chasing after king coal like a desperate lover begging for him to take us back, and focus on moving forward."
Kentucky,297xiu,glass_hedgehog,12,Fri Jun 27 13:04:33 2014 UTC,"I partially blame that attitude on the coal industry itself.  They've done a fantastic job in the past few decades nurturing a sense of loyalty among citizens who should know better.  If our great grandparents could see what we've become they'd be ashamed.  Less than a century ago coal miners were treated like they were less than a mule, and they were.  Our ancestors literally fought and died for the right to be treated fairly by the coal companies, and now we're fighting the government in their name.  It's pathetic and sad."
Kentucky,297xiu,valtr0n,6,Fri Jun 27 13:10:35 2014 UTC,"I understand that Eastern Kentucky needs to diversify, however, the key issue is what other industry will go there? I mean, coal companies and their associated industries are there because that's where the coal is. But, if you were opening up a factory or something, would you put it in Eastern Kentucky? Which is an area so isolated it's 1.5 AT LEAST from the nearest interstate. An area where flat land that is available for development and not located in a flood plain is a premium.   Yes, they do need diversification, I don't think anyone would argue that. But it's not as simple as saying ""Diversify!"" and having it done. I am of the belief that until there is an adequate interstate system constructed that opens up Eastern Kentucky to the larger population centers Virginia, West Virginia, and North Carolina, as well as making the Mountain Parkway an actual parkway all of the way to at least Salyersville, things aren't going to get better."
Kentucky,297xiu,realbabysealclubber,2,Fri Jun 27 14:16:28 2014 UTC,"As a former factory worker, companies like these kinds of areas. The workers are loyal and have no other options.

Kentucky,297xiu,realbabysealclubber,2,Fri Jun 27 14:35:21 2014 UTC,"I mean, coal companies and their associated industries are there because that's where the coal is.   Except there is increasingly less coal there, and the coal companies are leaving.  The intense loyalties and cry for help isn't going to make coal stay or expand operations.  Even reducing environmental obligations to zero, big coal would still be packing up shop in eastern Kentucky because all of the easy and cheap to mine coal is gone.   You're right --- the infrastructure there is bad and needs to be fixed to entice other industries to move in.  In the long term, that could certainly be a better use of money than welfare.  However, it doesn't change the fact that eastern Kentucky needs to stop relying on the coal industry to get by."
Kentucky,297xiu,glass_hedgehog,1 point,Fri Jun 27 15:22:00 2014 UTC,"That wasn't my point.

It's like saying you can't believe people would love their factory job even though factories used to lock workers inside and not allow breaks. Also, having a job that pays over $50k with a high school diploma is a rarity in this state, much less the region.   I don't see how people can treat this like such a black and white issue. People know that coal isn't going to last forever, but until there is a viable replacement in Eastern Kentucky, the people are going to hold onto it, and it's hard to blame people for that."

Exactly what industries stay open after business has stopped being profitable?  I'm not sure you understand why people invest in starting a company.  You are implying coal mines should just stay open and pay workers to stare at the walls?  I know plenty of mine workers and they all know going in that mining fluctuates dramatically.  Also, the ideology that miners ""give"" years of their life is a false premise.  This is a case of a voluntary contract between employer and employee to provide labor for an agreed wage.  Nothing more.  I don't see others industries lining up pay eastern Kentuckians with a HS diploma or less $75k a year.

As this article points out, the coal is almost gone, at least the easy stuff.  It gets poorer because the industry is gone and until people admit the industry is gone it will stay poor.  I used to live near a town in Arkansas that had an awful poverty and crime rate because the factory that sustained it shut down.  It's a similar premise to that.  What's interesting to me is them recommending coal people move to ND/SD - presumably for the gas fracking jobs up there.  What's going to happen to people up there when all of THAT is either gone, or shut down for being so hazardous?  I'm not going to get all moony and say ""build solar panel factories for them to work at"" but the boom-bust cycle seems like it's going to continue so long as people keep going after destructive resource jobs instead of something more long term."

During the summer she could get upwards of 300 people into Beatyville for a weekend worth of camping each month. How did the locals react? By focusing on Jesus, harassing the people trying to spend money in their community, protesting outside the property, throwing chicken at people's cars, repeatedly burglarizing the property, calling the police repeatedly with made up complaints, and doing everything possible to chase away anybody that didn't live in the county.

There would also be a jump in the cost of housing as these cities already have a moderate population density. Along with the increased cost of living in a larger city there would be a need for more public assistance for those that relocate. This would lead to Kentucky being even for of a burden as far as federal spending on public assistance than it already is. The common solution would be to raise taxes in Kentucky, great! Except Kentucky already has the problem of loosing many of its most educated residents to relocation to other states. By raising the taxes it could be reasonably assumed that quite a few high earning industries that are currently located in Kentucky would move south to Tennessee where there is not a state income tax, thus defeating the idea of raising taxes."

State and local officials in the area do nothing but embezzle any money the federal/state governments give them. Case in point the newest judge before I left town was randy Thompson. Literally 1 year into his term and he got investigated for stealing county money. It never changes either because the people in the area don't trust the government. It also doesn't help that each generation gets further into poverty and relies more on welfare due to the lack of jobs. Hemp may be the solution for eastern Kentucky's money problems. I say this because there is plenty of farm area there but mostly because they all already grow cannabis there.

It would likely make an impact but a slower one. The younger generations understand tech but the population, at large, is not the more tech literate group.   I believe that out-of-county, more tech savvy candidates would be selected by call centers and the area would still suffer. Call centers are still a profit-making entity that would select those candidates that will require minimum training/re-training and those with more experience in the field or with equipment. It is an option to increase the financial means of the area but does not impact the other five factors nearly as much. It also does not favor the population as heavily as it could. Without legislation requiring businesses within the county to hire a certain percentage of locals, which would likely never pass, it's hard to speculate the feasibility of implementing such a measure."

Kentucky,28wen8,BigAssFans,2,Thu Jun 26 12:37:11 2014 UTC,"Yes, and where there may be any issues, it will be blocked off or locked. The main building is in surprisingly good shape - concrete roof has kept moisture intrusion to a minimum. The barrel houses are a different story, so it may only be accessible on the ground floor. The upper floors are fine - but they need some repairs (hence the tours)."

Even if you live near robards you will be about 30 to 40 minutes from Evansville, which is close enough.    You can probably find cheaper housing in poole or around robards, but you will trade off access to social life for the rural country lifestyle.    The schools in owensboro are better than henderson, although henderson isn't too bad.  Elementary schools are a bit hit and miss."

It is a moderate sized town with a population of around 50k. Crime is pretty low, but depends on which part of town you live in.

Henderson is 10-15 minutes from Tyson in Robards and 10-15 minutes from Evansville. I'd recommend it over Owensboro which is pretty far out of the way. For a small house you're looking at around 550/month in rent. That's like 1 week between the two of you at Tyson, without OT.   Activities are pretty meh.

You'll probably spend a fair amount of time Henderson, pending on where you decide to live. It has a decent amount of restaurants and has a theater in town. With Evansville just across the river you can make occasional trips for things you can't find locally. The neighborhoods are fairly safe, but I'd still keep my doors locked at night. Henderson also has couple of nice public parks and the riverfront has events going on from time to time. As fair as rent, it really depends on the neighborhood and house. Rent typically gets a bit cheaper the further you get from town.  Edit: Forgot to mention. Henderson has the cheapest gas and gallons of milk within several miles."

It's the biggest city in our tri-state area and probably has the most to do.  Henderson is nice, but it's the smallest (maybe 30K people).  However, I bet you could find a comfortably priced place to live there, and you'd just be across the river from Evansville.  Owensboro is about 30 minutes east of Henderson and has about 60K people.  I'm from there and it's a great town to raise a family, but I'm not sure I'd say it's got a whole lot to do for people our age.  Go with Henderson or Evansville.

Governor Beshear isn't running again, and may in fact be done with politics altogether, so he can take any heat that may come from this case.

They have to make sure all their food is done at the right temperature, stored at the right temperature and everything sanitized at the same time.

When kitchen fucks up, wait staff has to handle the fallout up front. A kitchen mistake can cost a server their pay - and the restaurant a customer. But the right wait staff can .mitigate such a situation and maybe keep a customer coming back. They really are codependent positions. I have worked many sides of the industry as well, and prima Donna cooks that don't appreciate their wait staff make me really frustrated. Not saying you're like that, just saying."

Kentucky,27rk84,crossedx,7,Tue Jun 10 11:56:32 2014 UTC,"The title of the post suggests that McConnell is the worst thing to happen.  My response was to point out how facetious that statement is.  Do I like him?  Not really, but he's far from the worst thing to ever happen here."
Kentucky,27rk84,SilentLurker,1 point,Tue Jun 10 13:17:24 2014 UTC,"Ok, I get what you're saying, I just took, from the context of his self post, that he means much more recent history.  His lifetime recent."
Kentucky,27rk84,crossedx,5,Tue Jun 10 13:24:54 2014 UTC,"Coal is part of our heritage, It's also one of the largest industries we have.. 20 years ago we had Tobacco too, McConnell killed that with the buy out. Now the majority of the tobacco used today comes from central and south America. Having the lawmakers in Washington pass those new EPA regulations was idiotic, basically they said ""We don't know what we're gonna do about pollution.. But we're gonna do something blindly without thinking about the outcome."". I'm as Conservative as it gets and proud to be a Kentuckian but McConnell needs to retire, 30 years is long enough. The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over expecting a different outcome."
Kentucky,27rk84,cdstigall,5,Tue Jun 10 13:41:46 2014 UTC,If we don't innovate we'll take this state and our coal heritage farther into the toilet.
Kentucky,27rk84,MadCard05,2,Tue Jun 10 12:09:55 2014 UTC,"the people who are loosing their coal jobs need the old car.  they want someone that is going to keep the mines open.    Kentucky as a state don't have the will power to reposition the state into a forward looking state that focuses on up coming industries like clean power and tech industries.    The workforce that is becoming jobless due to the shutdown of the mines is not qualified, and often not capable of other jobs.    As far as employment goes, there are jobs to be had that go unfilled everyday.  The problem is that many people find the work beneath them or simply don't want to.  There are also jobs like the one I am trying to fill that people simply aren't qualified for.  Not trying to defend mitch, just trying to throw a little reality into the equation."
Kentucky,27rk84,cyvoid,3,Wed Jun 25 08:30:26 2014 UTC,cyvoid I tend to agree with you that the state lacks the will power to reposition itself. But then there hasn't been any answer to what is going to be a viable alternative to fossil fuels and coal either. Once we've decided how to proceed then depending on education levels required we could possibly even retrain those that are reliant on the coal industry for jobs. But for now those 8000 or so need those jobs to support their families.
Kentucky,27rk84,vexed_squirrel,9,Tue Jun 10 12:58:16 2014 UTC,"As of late 2013 there were only estimated to be around 8,000 coal mining jobs left in Kentucky. Surely it is not in our best interest as a state to reelect this man based on the idea that he will try to ""save"" those 8,000 jobs for another 10-20 years until they become completely obsolete and the coal industry collapses entirely. The coal argument is moot. We need to be forward thinking."
Kentucky,27rk84,naholt01,5,Thu Jun 19 20:13:52 2014 UTC,"what you don't understand is that for each of those 8000 (not a small number by the way) jobs there are 20 or more people who believe to their bones that the return of king coal will save their lives.  There are entire communities who's only source of revenue is coal.  There are entire counties who will never elect someone who doesn't support coal.  These people don't care about the environment, or looking to be innovators in clean energy.  They aren't equipped for any other job that pays a decent wage.  These are families of multigenerational miners.  These people and these communities are hanging on by a thread, all they want is to keep feeding their kids for another week much less another 20 years.  I'm going to guess that you live in the golden triangle.  I don't think you understand what it is like to watch a county die because it's a rural area and the only thing it offers is coal and farming, and the day of the small farmer is long gone.  If you understood the desperation of living in an area with zero options of meaningful employment, and moving away means abandoning generations of family, then I don't think you would be quite so caviler with peoples lives.  Yes, Kentucky needs to find a way to look to the future, however not at the expense of the present."
Kentucky,27rk84,cyvoid,-2,Tue Jun 10 14:17:29 2014 UTC,"no argument, but are you so blithely willing to take away the lively hood of thousands of people?"
Kentucky,27rk84,cyvoid,3,Tue Jun 10 17:01:36 2014 UTC,"I understand all of what you said and realize the reality of the situation. The problem is that these communities are going to collapse either way when coal collapses. Preserving the jobs that remain while moving forward with new energy technologies seems like a decent idea, but coal companies aren't exactly looking to diversify, unfortunately."
Kentucky,27rk84,naholt01,-1,Tue Jun 10 21:07:09 2014 UTC,The way oil companies diversified into ethanol and killed it?  Coal should not be the ones associated with new energy tech.

At best you could push that number to .01% if you include transportation of coal jobs, but that's a generous bump. Most overrated industry in the state.  Edit: Realized my math was wrong because I used the total population as opposed to working age population. When you remove the percentage of Kentuckians under 18 and over 65 you still only get a percentage of .006%."

As opposes to say... roughly 65,000 automotive manufacturing jobs in Kentucky. Stop perpetuating this absurd lie.  Edit: Before you go into your diatribe about the periphery jobs created by coal, let me go ahead and stop you. The same can be said for the auto industry on a grander scale. Shipping of cars, shipping of parts, manufacturing of parts, construction of and expansion of factories and warehouses, auto sales jobs, etc. Plus all the windfall jobs created by having a paid workforce in an area. I'm just not buying what your selling."

While some of our practices may seem antiquated, these arguments have no place in Kentucky lifestyle or politics. Coal may be rough on the environment, but there are currently no cost efficient solutions to the mining and production of coal. Another ""evil"" practice to northerners is alcohol consumption as they are all pothead libs. Not only does Kentucky have a multi billion dollar industry for the finest liquor on the face of the earth, we also cultivate the finest green as well (which Mitch has helped my partners in greatly). Finally with firearms... No Kentuckian will hold this against you when the Feds come riding in like the Brits, we will save your asses as well.

Obviously, regulations should be put in place to make the most of the economic opportunities. Medical regulations can also be developed once cannabis is removed from schedule 1, and we can finally utilize marijuana for its medicinal benefits. As well as work to diminish any possible health risks. I believe this is the way forward for Kentucky."
Kentucky,271rb4,snowlove,9,Mon Jun 2 03:18:36 2014 UTC,I don't use marijuana but I do support the legal sale of it same as alcohol I know several people who smoke and they are not degenerates or low lifes they work hard and want to relax at the end of the day also tax money is good and another crop for the farmers is also good I heard (correct me if I'm wrong) marijuana is a relative easily crop to grow compared to some now I'm no farmer myself so I wouldn't have any idea other than what I hear
Kentucky,271rb4,lcoursey,8,Sun Jun 1 23:22:13 2014 UTC,"Yes marijuana is suppose to be easy to grow. It's called weed for a good reason. I've heard of people throwing seeds onto the banks of water and coming back to harvest a couple months later. This obviously produces a less potent crop though, because of a lack of care.  I'm just sick of good money going to the people willing to break the law. It needs to be regulated similar to alcohol and tobacco, the only difference is that marijuana has almost no negative side effects."
Kentucky,271rb4,BeyondMyWallsofSleep,0,Sun Jun 1 23:27:40 2014 UTC,"It also increases heart rate which in turn increases the risk of a heart attack. Another negative effect is short term memory loss ( and paranoia because it's against the law).  Medical marijuana is great. It helps many people in need. I'm arguing for more than just medical uses and decriminalization, I want full legalization. Adults should have the right to enjoy a relatively harmless plant. The mental health risks are real, but in most cases require an underlying condition. Some people are bad when they drink, everyone reacts to substances differently, but we should have a right to consume those desirable products.  It is not yet time to legalize all drugs, America is not mature enough to handle access to hardcore substances, but the war on drugs has failed. The sooner we change our approach to contraband substances the sooner we can treat addiction rather than crime. We need to address the issues we can overcome, instead of waging war on the streets of our country."

However, I will agree that the VAST majority of law is written in favor of an individual making money.

I haven't been out there in a few years, so I can't quite remember the exact location of it.  It's gorgeous, though.  I'll ask one of my friends about it and get back to you.  There's also a Methodist church up on Town Hill, and it overlooks the city.  I'm sure you could get in touch with them and ask if they'd be okay with you scattering your father's ashes.  It's not far from Pine Hill Cemetery.  EDIT: Oh, wow. Thank you for the gold!  I appreciate it. First time I've had that happen."

If I venture futher southwest from there theres good thick woodlands and I think I can see trails back there.  The Church is a homerun. Dad was a pastor (his church went under shortly after he died or else I'd rest him there). There are dirt trails east and north of that church that look like prime spots.

My windows were down, and the scent of honeysuckle was heavy on the soft after-rain air. Fireflies were slowly coming out, winking in the trees. I drove through a tree tunnel - tree branches reaching from either side of the road to meet in the middle - and came out the other side facing west to a high spot with a clear view of the sky. This is one of the rewards for living in this state: getting to see these kinds of gorgeous sunsets and enjoy this beautiful weather before it turns a little too warm and the mosquitoes are unleashed."

Kentucky,26f264,Dalto11,4,Sun May 25 14:18:58 2014 UTC,"I'm only familiar with Lexington, so if anyone has any Louisville suggestions, definitely piggyback off my response!  For hot browns, the only place I've ever had them was at Ramsey's in Lexington and I've always liked them there. Stella's is supposed to have great hot browns too!  Burgoo is another Kentucky staple. It's a stew dish. I've never had it in a restaurant so unfortunately I don't have any recommendations.  And then there's fried chicken! In Lexington, I really love the fried chicken at the Merrick Inn as well as at Saul Good (I like getting chicken and waffles there, which is another southern dish).  Lastly, there's derby pie. I like it at both Missy's Pies (which is a standalone business as well as served at Ramsey's) and at Windy Corner.  Those are the Kentucky staples I can think of off the top of my head. Some other good local restaurants in  Lexington that don't necessarily sell Kentucky style food are Bourbon n Toulouse, Malone's, Joe Bologna's, Sav's Grill, and Thai Smile (this one is actually located in Frankfort and Richmond, but delicious all the same). I hope you all enjoy your trip!"
Kentucky,26f264,microwizard,2,Sun May 25 17:11:19 2014 UTC,"A weird local thing worth mentioning: ALE81.  Regional soft drink, kind of like a caffeinated ginger ale, worth trying.   Lexington specific notes relevant to your stated preferences, some of which is elsewhere in the thread:   My usual recommendation for traditionally local is Ramsey's, though their old downtown location with ambiance (good and bad...) closed.  We do have a Farmer's market that moves around a bit and makes a good stop.   I am not a seafood person because of allergies, but I think our traditional seafood place is a dive called Charlie's (note: shitty part of town, not really a sit-down restaurant, etc.). We recently got new place called Smithtown attached to West 6th, which is one of the nicer local breweries (there are quite a few good new breweries, but the area around W.6th is a rehabbed neighborhood full of interesting stuff to eat).  Fresh seafood around here pretty much means catfish and crayfish.  In a related vein, it's not exactly traditionally local, but we've got some decent cajun places.  I'm partial to Gumbo Ya-Ya, others like Bourbon n’ Toulouse."

Ecclectic atmosphere and great food.  If there is a bit of a wait, you can browse in Carmichael's bookstore next door and they will come get you when the table is ready.  The Irish Rover is fantastic.  The original is on Franklin Ave and has fabulous food and a nice ambiance.  Wick's Pizza Parlor in the Highlands is also fabulous.  If you are in the mood for something sweet, hit up the Homemade Ice Cream and Pie Kitchen, again in the Highlands area and on Bardstown road.  This place has fantastic ice cream they make themselves and also really delicious pies and cakes.  I highly recommend the chocolate chess pie and the yellow cake with caramel icing.  Also, while in Louisville, eat some Kizito cookies.  They are a local delicacy and so yummy.  I am actually tempted to order some and have them delivered to me here in Florida.  Places to go in Louisville:  Derby and Slugger museums have already been mentioned.  The Mohammed Ali Museum is also in Louisville and while I am not a fan of boxing, it actually has a lot of historically interesting things in there (or at least it did before I left the state).  If you like something a little more daring, check out the Louisville Mega Cavern and go ziplining...underground!  Like architecture?  Check out the Conrad-Caldwell House Museum (Conrad's Castle).  Want to have a nice stroll in a scenic area?  Cherokee Park is great for that.  Very pretty, nice paths.  For a more rigorous stroll, Iroquois Park is up your alley with more hills to conquer.  The Louisville Zoo is small but well designed.  They really care about their animals there and put a lot of effort into the design.  I should know, I used to work there.  The Speed Art Museum can be very interesting to visit.  I used to keep my eyes peeled for new exhibits traveling through.   Like Spooky?  Waverly Hills Sanatorium is known as ""one of the most haunted places in the US"" or some such.  They now have guided tours of the place.  I used to go stalk around it with friends (ooh we were so lucky we never got caught) and the spookiest thing I saw was when we scared the bejeezus and piss (literally) out of some college students that were already there and we were just a bunch of high schoolers.  Zachery Taylor National Cemetery is on Brownsboro Rd if history and tombstones tickle your fancy.  Depending on when you are there, you can hit up Shakespeare in the Park at Old Louisville Central Park.  It's a great outdoor theater. Runs through the summer starting in early June-ish, I think.

Also that bevin would never back raising the debt ceiling.  I personally don't want a leader who is so wrapped up in party ideology that he can't compromise.  we have plenty of those.  Additionally everyone i have talked to has said that defaulting on the debt would be horrible for the economy therefore the ceiling had to be raised.  Bevin is a tea party canidate.

That's pretty much McConnell in a nutshell. We're talking about a guy who filibustered almost every single meaningless congressional appointee over unrelated issues, crippling the government because he could stand in the way. There have been more filibusters since Obama took office than in the entire history of the US Senate prior. In the middle of the recession the man went on record saying that the top priority was preventing a second obama term. Not jobs, not getting out of costly wars, not health care, not education, nothing but partisan politics.  In a primary, there is always a lot of chest-beating about not compromising with the other guys. McConnell has led an unprecedentedly obstructionist senate GOP. His opponent might have been worse, but I'd hardly say leading through compromise across the aisle has been a gold star on McConnell's record. I'm not advocating for Grimes or anything, just saying that McConnell has taken partisanship to a whole new level of dickery."

You can throw weight around and bring more federal funds to your state (so during re-election you can tout that fact). If McConnell is unseated then Kentucky goes way on a back burner. Paul and Grimes don't have any clout to bring much our way.

Eastern Kentucky was the poorest region in the country when the commercial coal companies got here over a hundred years ago, and it's still the poorest region in the country. The coal industry is at absolute best a band-aid on the gaping wound that is Eastern KY's economic troubles, and that's if you accept all the industry's horseshit claims."

Then policies change, the new ""clean"" energy like gas gets its preferential treatment taken away by whatever regulatory body was getting paid and its back to coal again.    Second,  before you get Kentucky citizens to ""accept"" that coal is on the way out you better get them to ""accept"" hundreds of millions less in tax revenue from coal severance and jobs earning about 40% less.  Schools and county governments have build their entire budgets on the back of coal taxes.  It has brought local governments to a stand still in Eastern Ky.  So what, pray tell, is your plan to ""vitalize"" Eastern Kentucky?  LBJ would love to know.

Throwing all of our political capital into propping up the dirtiest fuel source this side of burning feces just isn't going to fly in the era of clean energy innovation. Not to mention widespread environmental devastation locally from mountaintop removal, cancer, pollution of the drinking water, etc. etc. I don't know what the solution to Eastern Kentucky's woes is, but it isn't coal. As long as all our resources are focused on propping up coal instead of figuring out what to do in the post-coal world, we're just digging ourselves into a deeper and deeper hole."

But I know what it isn't, and it isn't clinging to an energy source that's being phased out as newer, better sources are developed. Coal isn't the only industry this is happening with. Look at ISPs fighting fiber optic internet, cable companies fighting Netflix, car dealerships fighting Tesla, and so on and so forth (except ISPs, cable companies, and car dealerships don't give people cancer or turn mountains and rivers into moon landing practice sets, but I digress). Whenever new technology starts to supplant old technology, some elements of the entrenched old guard fight tooth and nail to maintain the status quo. They inevitably get buried. Wiser old guards adapt, innovate, and join the new guard. Kentucky has established itself firmly in the former camp by forcing politicians to obsequiously acquiesce to whatever demands the coal industry makes or be branded unelectable. When coal gradually loses market share on a massive scale over the next few decades, we're going to find ourselves with our pants around our ankles, no better off than we were before they showed up, and we'll have no one to blame but ourselves."

Kentucky,25564d,fuzio,17,Fri May 9 17:27:46 2014 UTC,I have long argued that the Governor wants to purposely lose the appeal as a politically safe way of making sure Heyburn's original ruling stands within the state until the Supreme Court decides to finally make a judgement on the issue. This hilarious and seemingly unwinnable argument does nothing but reinforce that belief for me.
Kentucky,25564d,imfeelingsinister,3,Fri May 9 19:28:47 2014 UTC,"I've argued that this entire thing is all a political plot by the Democrats (and a damn good one at that) to try and push same-sex marriage into the election platform because currently, it's really not one of the top issues anymore.    Heyburn was recommended by McConnell and I'm sure the Democrats realize they can run with this like crazy but they don't want to really discuss it themselves on the campaign. So how do they do it? Just like this. They (the democrats) don't have to actually involve themselves in the discussion or get their hands dirty.    Matt Bevin is a strong supporter of 'traditional marriage' and this could easily be another nail in the coffin for McConnell and Grimes (in my opinion) could easily wipe the floor with Bevin.    So if this becomes a wedge issues among the Republican Party and it knocked McConnell down, it paves the way for Grimes to finally unseat him."
Kentucky,25564d,TheGoshDarnedBatman,1 point,Fri May 9 19:32:40 2014 UTC,"I very much agree that Beshear is basically trolling the Republican party with this defense, but is there a chance in Hell that Bevin wins in two weeks?"

Kentucky,25564d,SilentLurker,10,Fri May 9 23:00:50 2014 UTC,"It's an interesting, although fairly flawed, argument.    This has really always been an issue about gender and not about sexual orientation. (Which is why I've always preferred calling it same-sex marriage as opposed to gay marriage)    There are plenty of people born every day who will, for their entire lives, not be able to naturally produce a child. So are we to tell them they are not ""allowed"" to get married?    Marriage is a civil institution and it's not required in order to produce children, it's not necessary in order to produce children and quite frankly, their argument is pretty faulty in my opinion.    So glad to see our tax-payer dollars going toward something so important despite the state of our economy."
Kentucky,25564d,champcantwin,13,Fri May 9 17:31:45 2014 UTC,I don't understand how this is valid as marriage and pregnancy are two very separate things that don't need the other to occur.
Kentucky,25564d,galt88,7,Fri May 9 17:57:47 2014 UTC,"Some ""traditional"" marriages also don't or can't produce children.  So those marriages should be nullified?"
Kentucky,25564d,bigtaterman,0,Fri May 9 18:58:13 2014 UTC,"Their argument is basically because a male/female couple have the ability to procreate (even if they can't), they should be the ones getting married.    As if promoting pro-creation is something we seriously need to be doing in this day and age where no one gives a damn about the environment. Over-population will eventually start to be a serious issue on top of the other problems that will come along with it."

Kentucky,250i18,-deteled-,3,Thu May 8 19:35:30 2014 UTC,They did. In the updated article they posted a day later.
Kentucky,250i18,jordanundead,-3,Thu May 8 19:38:43 2014 UTC,"I agree 100% that's their prerogative.  Regardless of where you stand on the issue, no man should be forced to serve another, we outlawed slavery a long time ago."
Kentucky,250i18,hanz333,14,Thu May 8 05:40:40 2014 UTC,I think it's a little extreme to equate this to slavery.
Kentucky,250i18,hanz333,-7,Thu May 8 14:44:18 2014 UTC,"Not according to the second defition here.  Because it isn't equating it to anything, I'm purely stating that is what it is."
Kentucky,250i18,thingscouldbeworse,7,Thu May 8 14:51:46 2014 UTC,"What? That's the stupidest analogy ever. No one is being ""forced to serve"" anyone else, it's just being proposed that we should force people to apply their rules for serving people to everyone. It's not saying ""YOU have to serve THOSE PEOPLE"" it's saying ""IF you serve some people, you don't get to pick and chose who ELSE you serve."" I mean what, teachers provide a service, but are we going to say ""naw, screw integration of schools, we aren't SLAVEDRIVERS"""
Kentucky,250i18,hanz333,-2,Thu May 8 16:08:05 2014 UTC,"What is this, day one of contract law?  First and foremost, let's not forget that teachers:    Don't own the school  Don't own the property the school is on  Don't employ themselves  Are under contract and are expected to fulfill the terms of that contract as a term of employment.  (Terms of employment are terms of employment, nobody wakes up in the morning with uncontrollable desire to clean up bathrooms)  Paid for by taxes, which are colorblind in this country.   But what we can say is:  Slavery is now and will always be non-voluntary service coerced through force.  If you were to make somebody do something through threat of force, you either have to label it theft, rape or servitude.    The 13 Amendment has made it pretty clear that this type of servitude, even with little coercion (involuntary servitude) is outlawed and at least in the eyes of the government seen as slavery."
Kentucky,250i18,Neurokeen,7,Thu May 8 18:09:18 2014 UTC,"I'm pretty sure public accommodation nondiscrimination laws regarding race, religion, and national origin have been on the books for years (ever since the Civil Rights Act of 1964) and carry the full weight of law.  It's not slavery in any sense - no one is forced to engage in a business of public accommodation. If you don't want to do business with Muslims or Hispanic people, you don't have to have a business. If you don't want to pay taxes, you also will lose your business license. And if you violate several other laws, like health codes, you'll lose your business.   That's like saying I'm forced to work by having a job. No, as a condition of continued employment, I have to work. I have the option of quitting though. I am not someone's property that can be coerced through threat of bodily harm or by means of some ownership-based duress to go to work."
Kentucky,250i18,hanz333,-2,Thu May 8 15:13:49 2014 UTC,"First and foremost you'd be hard pressed to argue that a print shop is a public accommodation.  And further, endentured servitude with or without law does not change what it is.  A bar/restaurant is a public accomidation.  So a ""gay bar"" should be forced to host an event for say Westboro Baptist Church if hosting events is a service they offer?  Would they not feel as if that is forced service, contrary to their beliefs, practices and dare I say right of assembly and free speech?  Furthermore the Civil Rights Act does not protect sexual orientation, but it does protect religious beliefs.  Westboro would be in standing in the situation above."
Kentucky,250i18,Neurokeen,3,Thu May 8 15:32:41 2014 UTC,"I'm not saying a print shop falls totally under those rules (they are by federal definition set as places of lodging, eating, and entertainment; states tend to have similar if not sometimes more expansive definitions), but rather addressing the larger point as to equating anything of the sort as slavery.  Also, the example of special events would only apply for those places that have a policy of publicly renting out the space for events to private groups (like a conference room at a hotel). If a bar/restaurant holds only in-house/sponsored events (as most do), then it's not part of the public service they're providing.  Westboro would probably not have a special claim under the CRA unless it was demonstrated that they were discriminated against for being Christian and not for being associated with the Phelps Family. If the place in question had a previous business history with Christian groups, Westboro probably would not succeed in a claim because there are lots of justifications for exclusion that might be tangentially related but not central to the fact that they're a Christian group."
Kentucky,250i18,hanz333,-2,Thu May 8 15:46:08 2014 UTC,"Then let's address slavery.  Is involuntary service of an entity by means of force and perceived authority over them slavery or not?    Alternatively we could argue theft or rape, but in terms of service this type of servitude was explicitly outlined in the terms of the 13th Amendment, hence why I believe slavery is adequate for the framing of this discussion.  Also CRA explicitly protects religion, not affiliation, but actual beliefs, which is further independent of association, but that is neither here nor there."

Convenience matters greatly and being able to support a local farmers market is a luxury - whether it's being able to afford the foods offered at the market, or are able to attend the market when it is open.   I shop my local farmers market frequently, my work schedule allows me to do so.  I live in Franklin county and we are fortunate enough to have Farmers Market several times a week, at different times of day. The prices are often comparable with grocery store prices - eggs for $3/doz while Kroger had them for $2.40/doz.   Shopping at a farmers market is in itself, kind of different. It's a continuous learning process - you may not be able to get everything you want at the market. It takes some planning and forethought to make a trip worthwhile - plus you now have access to different types of veggies that you don't normally see at places like Walmart."
Kentucky,24rq4y,DomesticallyDisabled,3,Mon May 5 18:17:09 2014 UTC,"They may be comparable where you live, but here eggs at the farmers market are $4/dozen while eggs at IGA are $1.19/dozen. Makes a huge difference when your food budget is less than $200/month."

Kentucky,24rq4y,gallantfox,2,Tue May 6 02:11:05 2014 UTC,"One of the things I love is that in my part of Kentucky, IGA (which bought up Houchens) has been becoming Price Less IGA in some places, and they source a lot of local food. I live in southcentral KY, and I am continually delighted to find milk from a Warren County dairy, honey and sorghum from Allen County Mennonite farmers, and produce from several surrounding counties in the IGA stores in Bowling Green, Franklin, Glasgow. Best for me is when they actively advertise their local food. Dollar General has had a hold on the area thanks to their longtime headquartering in Scottsville, and they are your typical single-serving convenience, ""highish prices due to lack of competition"" kind of dollar store suck, but it's the only option for so many people without access to proper groceries. I do feel like more community involvement, letting people know where you can go out and buy fresh food, as well as what the hell to do with it, would go a long way toward making us healthier as a state.  I know it wasn't the focus of the article, but it's just as important as having access to good food: cooking needs to be addressed in Kentucky as well. Cooking really is a lost art, and a lot of people are just happy/relieved filling up with prepackaged food that's easy to prepare,  isn't that expensive, and isn't necessarily healthy when not eaten in moderation and/or in combination with non-prepackaged food. Anecdotally, I'm a native Kentuckian who grew up with my mom and grandmom, and I wasn't taught that much about cooking growing up. Luckily, I've lived with people who have taught me some things and been willing to pick up some of the cooking duties themselves, and I am willing to follow recipes. Some people just can't be bothered to learn or follow recipes, or they don't have time or the energy when so many other things are pulling at their attention (crazy hours at crappy jobs and child-rearing come immediately to mind). I think that's definitely an area where we need a culture shift, a reprioritization of the value of cooking more from scratch, for diet-based behaviors and problems to be properly addressed."

Kentucky,248no4,Allan57,0,Tue Apr 29 03:13:28 2014 UTC,My fiancée wants to get married at a certain location. I have brought up eloping dozens of times. But this is what she wants
Kentucky,248no4,Allan57,3,Tue Apr 29 12:48:14 2014 UTC,"Judges don't have to marry you at the court house. They can, and usually will, perform a ceremony at any place of your choosing."
Kentucky,248no4,oneshotdown,1 point,Tue Apr 29 13:21:11 2014 UTC,I'll talk to my second half about this. She mentioned that she asked someone about our local judge and that he wouldn't do it outside the courthouse. But that's second hand information...
Kentucky,248no4,kerneldashiki,3,Tue Apr 29 14:41:03 2014 UTC,"KRS 402.070 says that as long as you believe that a person officiating your ceremony has the authority to do so, it is a valid marriage.  ""402.070 Marriage not invalid for want of authority to solemnize.  No marriage solemnized before any person professing to have authority therefor shall be invalid for the want of such authority, if it is consummated with the belief of the parties, or either of them, that he had authority and that they have been lawfully married."""

Kentucky,248no4,Harley_Quin,2,Tue Apr 29 01:54:54 2014 UTC,"My fiancée has been told by a few officiants that they will not marry us for several reasons, such as us refusing counseling, or because we live together, or we must become a member of their church, among other things. Do you have such requirements?   Also, would you be willing to drive to Leitchfield? We have a location for the wedding already. We will happily reimburse you for travel and pay for your time as well."
Kentucky,248no4,mrswright_89,6,Tue Apr 29 02:01:39 2014 UTC,"I don't have those requirements.  But, let me drop this knowledge on ya.  When I went to talk to my local court clerks office about obtaining a license to marry folks I was told they didn't do that anymore.  (I'm am an ordained minister though).  According to them basically anyone can perform the wedding as long as the bride and groom are cool with it.  I've been the officiant at 3 weddings since then.    But I would be willing to officiate your wedding, when is the wedding? ( I would have to check with my wife too....make sure it's cool with her, and that the date doesn't conflict with something I am forgetting)"
Kentucky,248no4,omgaaah,5,Tue Apr 29 02:08:44 2014 UTC,I found it horribly interesting when they told me that /anyone/ could sign anymore.  I'm ordained in the Church of the FSM and they don't even raise an eyebrow.

Kentucky,23jqsm,omg_cupcakes,1 point,Mon Apr 21 19:02:53 2014 UTC,"We found most everything to be reasonably priced! The City Museum is a must-do and I believe it was $11. The zoo was free, the science center was free, and the arch tour was less than $15 if I remember correctly. The food was also reasonably priced and delicious (we just used urbanspoon for wherever we were at the time). We ate lots of donuts from different local shops, as well as a few coffee shops. I was also so impressed that the parking was so easy. I think the only time we paid for parking was at the city museum, and even then, we saw street parking we had missed as we were leaving. I definitely recommend it!"

Kentucky,23hkmb,thebradking,2,Sun Apr 20 18:01:13 2014 UTC,"There are load of great books on the subject. Night Comes to Cumberlands is one of the famous books about Kentucky, although it's a bit troublesome at times as the author perpetuates some stereotypes.  The Road to Poverty is an amazing book that traces the economic forces that shaped Kentucky. It's based upon 100 years of academic research, but it's a narrative telling of that."

Kentucky,23cw8k,SilentLurker,9,Fri Apr 18 16:29:14 2014 UTC,Isn't the stereotype that backwood Kentucky folk make illegal corn liquor?  How does opening a legitimate distillery and creating jobs in a state known the world over as producing some of the finest spirits available further a stereotype?
Kentucky,23cw8k,Allan57,-7,Fri Apr 18 18:10:42 2014 UTC,The story mentioned white whiskey and moonshine. Sounds like corn liquor to me.  I say it plays into the hillbilly stereotype that this state needs to distance itself from.

On the way back I took US 60 the whole way because I love the beauty of that area of the country. Bourbon distilleries are always a solid choice as well
