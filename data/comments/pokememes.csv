pokememes,3bh154,kpecc99,2,Mon Jun 29 14:28:12 2015 UTC,I don't remember which pokemon they have with them but if survival training taught me anything it is that any plant can be made into sub par tea. Now the real question is are grass pokemon considered more plant or animal?
pokememes,3bh154,TwelfthDoctor12,2,Mon Jun 29 14:32:47 2015 UTC,Probably depends on what part you're consuming. Bulbasaur's bulb is plant but her body is animal.

pokememes,3anjg9,porygonj,7,Mon Jun 22 01:06:21 2015 UTC,I said the same exact thing when this was posted by someone before. People seem to think poke' dollars/yen directly equates to dollars.
pokememes,3anjg9,Meltian,3,Mon Jun 22 01:36:39 2015 UTC,Someone on /r/pokemonconspiracies actually commented about how the prices are perfectly reasonable in a Japanese context. Until then I interpreted it as large sales taxes used to raise money for healthcare
pokememes,3anjg9,daedalususedperl,2,Mon Jun 22 04:15:00 2015 UTC,"Pokédollars are about the same as a Japanese Yen. Meaning lemonade is actually around $2.84 (as of time of posting).  Further more, even if they were Dollars and not Yen, prices match what is given to the player by other trainers. For example, the pictured character's (Hilbert's) first gym is Striaton Gym. The leader gives out ₽1680, or $13.62, enough for 4.8 lemonades."

pokememes,2mvw83,Earthenblood,3,Thu Nov 20 16:10:18 2014 UTC,He only wants to get back in his pokeball. He just doesn't want the trainer to leave without him and accidently chokes him out unknowingly.
pokememes,2mvw83,soybjs,1 point,Thu Nov 20 18:55:16 2014 UTC,"You attempt to flee! There is no escape!  The Feraligatr then chomps the skull of the tiny pokemon trainer, foolish enough to go out into the tall grass without a pokemon for protection. I mean, the kid even tried to throw a Poke Ball at it. Full health. Stupid.  This is a cautionary tale to all 10 year olds who think they can just up and leave their hometown without talking to a professor first. THIS is why we put a sign at the gate! DANGER! Wild pokemon live in tall grass! Inform your kids."
