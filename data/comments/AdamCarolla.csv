The media recognizes how horrible it looks... take note of the cell phone video that any media outlet plays.  Instead of the black bars on the sides, they blow up the video and blur it and have that in place of the black background.  At this rate, we're going to have a 20 year period of history where all amateur video will be vertical video where you can barely see a damn thing and we'll wonder why the fuck we were so stupid."

Southwest (or any airline) is not gonna boot a quiet person sleeping in the back of the plane. She had to be drunk and was likely loud and obnoxious.
AdamCarolla,3dy6pf,whiskeydeltatango,10,Mon Jul 20 15:24:53 2015 UTC,"I used to have a really bad fear of flying and I would routinely get on airplanes with enough booze in me to stop a baby elephant.  In all those flights, I never once got thrown off of the plane or even approached by a member of the flight crew.  I know that you can be barred from entering a plane if you're sauced, and I'm sure plenty of them smelled a whiff of beer or bloody mary on me, but I also know I'm not the only one who flies drunk. Your explanation is the only one that makes sense: she was behaving inappropriately and they didn't want a disruptive person on the plane.  Being drunk may have been the grounds for it, and it was certainly icing on the cake, but I don't know how anyone can tell that story with a straight face.  Her story is so far from believable and it's been told now several times. I would honestly be ashamed that my behavior got me booted off of an airplane and keep it to myself.

She wasn't wearing her bathing suit as underwear under nice clothes.  If she was going to do that she would have taken the 15 seconds to take her suit off.  She left it on because she was drunk and passed out for 30 minutes.  Remember of the first story adam heard it was ""missed the plane"".

Whats great is in 2015 with the technology we have she won't be able to hide from the real truth forever."

AdamCarolla,3dy6pf,ZaltorTheMerciless,-6,Mon Jul 20 21:11:54 2015 UTC,So what could she have been doing to get her kicked off the plane? What is your fantasy? You think she is completely lying when saying she was just sitting there with her eyes closed? What is she leaving out?
AdamCarolla,3dy6pf,heperd,6,Mon Jul 20 21:15:23 2015 UTC,"So what could she have been doing to get her kicked off the plane? What is your fantasy? You think she is completely lying when saying she was just sitting there with her eyes closed? What is she leaving out?    The real question is how did the businessman get back on the plane? He's the one who was having the verbal altercation with the ""kid"" while Lynette was sitting there with her eyes closed under her mother-of-the-year halo. Why would they have let him on the plane and kept her off? Maybe because he was the poor schlub who had the misfortune to get caught between two fucktards."
AdamCarolla,3dy6pf,bassplayerguy,0,Mon Jul 20 23:09:23 2015 UTC,He wasnt drunk and he was dressed nice. The dumb kid was drunk and starting shit. The flight attendants made a stupid decision in 3 seconds and decided that Lynette was with the guy. I cant believe people think that people that work on airplanes are at all reasonable and make reasonable decisions.   Just like Adam explained. They hold all of the power and when they make a stupid rash decision they will never back down because they dont have to. They dont care if you didnt do anything. You have to do what they say or else. If flight attendants had guns they would shoot innocent people everyday just like cops.
AdamCarolla,3dy6pf,heperd,3,Tue Jul 21 00:04:21 2015 UTC,Drunken loud talking BS is my best guess ..........  If you listen to a clip from HER show posted on youtube(link in one of these lynette threads in this sub) go to the 16 minute mark you will hear her describe what she said in the terminal to the young guy and how security threatened to call the cops. A bit of fire escapes from the little angel. IMO very telling to what actually happened.

AdamCarolla,3dy6pf,Jamaican_In_NY,3,Tue Jul 21 15:21:23 2015 UTC,"I might be the only one around here that buys this story. Long and short of it, to me, is: Security booted the two initial trouble makers off the plane, then the 22 year old included Lynette in their situation. The security guys were like 'Ok this bitch is causing problems too I guess. I don't give a fuck let's just get her off this plane so we can go home.'   I've seen situations like this happen plenty of times. Like friends of drunken friends get kicked out of a bar for literally doing nothing. It's called guilty by association. The 22 year old gestured towards Lynette's association with the trouble that he was causing, so they booted her too.  I could be wrong, but I don't think that it's out of the realm of possibility at all."
AdamCarolla,3dy6pf,RichterScale,3,Mon Jul 20 22:20:29 2015 UTC,"It's completely beyond the realm of possibility.  A plane is not a bar.  You honestly believe she was just laying there with her eyes closed, like an angel, stone quiet with headphones on, minding her business, relaxing in her own world, and they just roused her and threw her off the plane based on nothing but the word of a 22-year-old they were in the process of kicking off the plane?!?!?!?  People who get thrown off planes don't have the power to point and say ""If I go, he/she goes!"".  At least one airline employee had to witness Lynette doing/saying some very nutty/unruly/obnoxious, a.k.a. drunken, things for her to get thrown off the plane."
AdamCarolla,3dy6pf,joomommyhappy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:11:52 2015 UTC,"Naw.  It is completely within the realm of possibility that they looked like they were together (he helped her with her bags, she was talking with him) and they booted her because of his word.  Her not engaging and just sleeping probably hurt her because she didn't engage to defend herself.  I'm sure the business man assumed they were together and also verified whatever the 22 year old said when they were at the front of the plane."

There was some kind of ""hey fuck you"" ""no, fuck YOU"" argument going on with the guy and some other guy.  They get kicked off the plane and so does Lynette who was ""just laying there sleeping"".

AdamCarolla,3dxd2w,Liledroit,17,Mon Jul 20 09:57:17 2015 UTC,"The most charitable interpretation of events that could have resulted in Lynette getting kicked off the fight is her getting loud and obnoxious with the flight attendants.  That's the most charitable.  More likely she was drunkenly arguing with the guy across the businessman's seat (in the way only drunken entitled Italian women can do) then blew off the flight attendants multiple times.  Also, I'm sure it absolutely sealed the deal when she said her husband was a celebrity.  I would take particular pleasure in kicking someone like that off a plane.  Trust me, my mom was a flight attendant for decades and has dealt with all kinds of drunks and crazies.  The attendants don't want to have to deal with this shit, they would much rather you just quiet down when asked, so they can fly.  Especially the last flight of the day, everyone just wants to get home and crack a beer.    The only thing you need to know about Lynette's story is that the businessman was allowed to continue flying.  That's literally the only thing you need to know."

Now, he has to support her on the podcast, because well, you know, blow jobs.  But, if she really did fuck up, he'll skip Southwest for a few flights and then rationalize getting back on them.    If she truly was innocent collateral damage, then he'll rewire his method of travel to exclude Southwest.

When she got to the airport she was tired from ""working hard"" all day and she needed something to relax. She takes a xanax, or Ambien, or a vicoden to wind down. Then the flight gets pushed back, so she goes to have a night cap at the bar. When it comes time to board, Lynette is blacked out.

Wouldn't surprise me if the kid is the reason the neighbor was such a dick.  So I'm a little skeptical that Howie and his family were completely innocent and it was just this one 'crazy neighbor'.  I also have doubts about Lynette's story, and like other people here have pointed out, Ace is the first person to give people a hard time for claiming someone with no real reason is out to get them.  Ace can call a spade a spade when it's someone he doesn't know or doesn't like but when it's a friend, family member or someone he sucks up to (Alec Baldwin), his 'hyper-vigilance' goes out the window."

AdamCarolla,3dxd2w,MustBeNice,12,Mon Jul 20 19:17:05 2015 UTC,"Homebrewer checking in here: Germany does regulate its beer industry, but in a different way then the States do. Germany regulates it more based on ingredients, in the production process (speaking to the Purity Law of 1487 here). We regulate more on where it can be sold. I believe you can buy beer which is under a certain ABV at the age of 14 with an adult present in Germany. You can buy distilled spirits at 18. In the States, we all know its 21 years, no matter what you are buying. NOTE: I know we regulate based on some ingredients. But the Germans have been historically more active in limiting what ""beer"" is ie it must be malted barley, water, yeast and hops.   Now in terms of the ""embalming"" liquid Adam speaks of, some brewery's used astringents to clear their beer, as most commercially brewed beer is ""fined"" with various agents that clarify the beer. For example, Guinness uses fish bladder to clarify (yes, even though its dark, they use fining agents). Most micro-brews use aging and physical filters to clear their beer. However, I'm not a professional brewer, so someone out there might be able to speak to what our macro-breweries use to fine their beer. NOTE: I know of many who use Irish Moss which is a type of algae. However, I've never used fining agents as I find a week of aging in the fridge really clears my carboys, and I'm very careful in the transfer into the keg."

I used to kind of defend her and I certainly don't hate her like most do around these internet parts, but her constant inability to recognize that Ace and his audience isn't the same as a Morning Zoo audience is starting to get on my nerves.  Save the worship of all things ""progressive"" and homosexual for the hours of 6AM to 10AM."

AdamCarolla,3dxd2w,ColinOnReddit,13,Mon Jul 20 13:10:03 2015 UTC,"Her reactions aren't better than no reaction because they sound incredibly fake and like she's not even tracking with the story. She breaks up the flow of the story and really disengages the listener. I don't really blame her though since that seems to be what they want you to do in morning radio, so I think she's just doing what she was trained to do. Consider yourself lucky that you don't even notice."

She was flirting with the 'cute' guy in line.  The Guy was still in 'Vegas Mode'.  Amazing how Adam isn't on the side of the sober Businessman professionally dressed.  Adam should be embarrassed by the sloppy drunk flirting wife.  Southwest averted a problem.  I have been that traveling businessman - Good for Southwest.

I'm just beyond bored with it and the constant stupid points and bitching.  It's just not entertaining to listen to anymore, and there is no comedy.  I did recall James Deen being a good guest in the past so I downloaded this episode, but now I'm worried that might have been a mistake.    It's just been downhill for ACS ever since the start of the year."

I've actually quite grown to like Gina.  She's at least an equal as far as pop-culture references as Alison was. -- I also like her stance on getting drunk.   James Deen was actually a great guest and im amazed how much Adam talked over Deen when he would be talking."

AdamCarolla,3dxd2w,grimace1973,6,Mon Jul 20 15:26:22 2015 UTC,Nothing is impossible but EXTREMELY unlikely. She even included random tidbits here and there that are extremely telling like the suitcase falling over (because it's 'cheap'). That sounds like an excuse someone drunk would use for why they can't properly handle something or properly put it in the overhead.  I'm sure what happened was they were already both conversing back and forth. Later the businessman probably offered her the seat as they probably continued to banter back and forth since that is something that happens all the time on planes. You don't want to be that guy sitting between two people talking.  The most damning is that the businessman got back on even after being a part of the altercation. This not only disproves Lynette but Adam as well in that he was obviously able to plead his case. For Adam its confirmation bias and not wanting to talk too much shit on his wife for something she's obviously very upset about. For Lynette she just seems to forget things out of convenience or just has no sense of objectivity.

AdamCarolla,3dxd2w,lloyd67,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:40:58 2015 UTC,I actually like Gina but do find her over doing it a lot...some of it may be due to the fact that Alison sat there and did nothing and that was cited as one of the reasons she got canned.
