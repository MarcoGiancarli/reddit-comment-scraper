The synth obviously and that rubbery bass.  I don't think that there's anything as eerie as this song on Currents though.

TameImpala,3e1smp,Guzyguz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:55:13 2015 UTC,It sounds like he used his old boss br600 Mabye used another pedal in combination to change the sound up a bit.
TameImpala,3e1smp,xxrockitmanxx,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:13:58 2015 UTC,"Definitely not a guitar sound with pedals, sounds like a synth controlled by a guitar. Roland GK-3 MIDI pickup thats on his strat into his Moog Sub Phatty.  Unfortunately midi pickups 220  + Moog 899 = 1,120 to achieve this sound :/.  Of course you could just try a software-synth with a keyboard and get close tho."

TameImpala,3dzysk,patpavs,13,Mon Jul 20 22:07:47 2015 UTC,"I did exactly that! I decided that I would do this for albums I am really excited for after I listened to the singles for Modern Vampires of the City before the album itself was released (I think they were Diane Young, Step, and Ya Hey). I really liked the songs, but knowing them already sort of divided the album in my head, which stunk because that album was IMO in the top 2 albums of 2013.  The temptation to listen to the Currents singles was great (never greater than when KP released Eventually on an AMA!), but well worth it to resist I think. And considering how much great music there is to enjoy these days, it becomes easier to hold off the more you do it.  Anyway my favorite tracks are Reality In Motion and Eventually."
TameImpala,3dzysk,dventurino,6,Mon Jul 20 23:02:40 2015 UTC,Bless your brave soul
TameImpala,3dzysk,sdlaloo,2,Tue Jul 21 00:12:04 2015 UTC,He actually released Disciples in the AMA! I was so pumped when that happened lol

TameImpala,3dzysk,tamayimpala,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:09:20 2015 UTC,"Just wanna sprinkle this here....Modern Vampires of the City is fantastic. Beautiful, 10/10 IMHO."
TameImpala,3dzysk,sal25,5,Tue Jul 21 19:21:51 2015 UTC,"I also did this! I've gotten into the habit of avoiding singles for albums that I am already heavily anticipating. Though in some cases its not always possible, I was luckily able to do it with Currents. I wouldn't go as far to say that knowing singles ahead of time has ever ruined my experience of listening to an album. But I've learned that I really love the experience of listening to a full record from start to finish with everything being brand new to my ears. IMO it's a totally different experience than if you've already heard a decent chunk of it. It's exactly the same reason I like to avoid movie trailers for films that I'm excited for.  Anyways, for this specific album I found that my patience really did pay off. In some cases when I avoid tracks that are released before an album, when the record comes out I feel as though it might not have been necessary. However in the case of Currents it is rewarding in the best kind of way.  I listened to the whole album today for the very first time, and for someone like myself that invests tons of emotion into music it felt like pure ecstasy. This album IMO begs to be experienced as a single piece not on a track by track basis, and I LOVE THAT! All of my favorite records achieve the same thing that Currents does. Which is that if you've heard the entire album it feels like an injustice to single out tracks from the rest of the group. In a sort of ""whole is the greater than the sum of its parts"" type of way.  I would even go as far as to say that in an ideal world I would like to not even know the titles of the singles. Or I guess in a perfect world there just wouldn't be singles. For example when I got to 'Cause I'm a Man on the album I knew that it had been released as the first single and just the fact that I knew that made me listen to it with a different ear and sort of isolate it out in my mind from the surrounding tracks. I understand that some people will think thats a little extreme, but it's a legit feeling I had while listening to it.  Anyways, I'm very excited to give this record many repeat listens in days/weeks/months/years and see how my feelings about it evolve. IMO the best records reveal themselves to you overtime and I definitely feel that will happen with this record.  Sorry for the novel, just a topic that I think a lot about but isn't discussed very much so I naturally had a lot to say. :)"
TameImpala,3dzysk,redjess1206,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:50:32 2015 UTC,Favorite tracks at this point?
TameImpala,3dzysk,d_dolson,2,Tue Jul 21 13:55:01 2015 UTC,"I did that too! I got stoned and downloaded their album on Google play music and my favorite tracks were Let it Happen, Yes I'm Changing, and 'Cause I'm a Man"
TameImpala,3dzysk,GrubDogMillionaire,2,Tue Jul 21 03:44:15 2015 UTC,I wish I had but I couldn't help myself to listen to the singles. I didn't for Lonerism and the album stayed with me like an album. For Currents since I played the singles too much before the album release I think Currents will always feel like singles+songs instead of an album. Hopefully I learn from this mistake.

TameImpala,3dxptn,Madcap01,2,Mon Jul 20 19:14:10 2015 UTC,"The idea came from the transformation of Lonerism the more and more I listened to it. When I first began listening to it my favourite songs were the obvious ones Like Elephant, Mind Mischief & FLWOGB.  After 2 years of listening to it my favourites had changed alot being, NTHHSFHBAWCC, Apocalypse Dreams & (still) Mind Mischief.  I want to try keep tabs on how my favourites change this time."

Kevin is trying to be what Com Truise already is, and is about as good at it as you'd expect Com Truise to be at psychedelic rock (which would certainly be interesting, but likewise not as good as Kevin). They're masters of their own realms.  Source:  I've listened to both of them on acid, more times than I can count."
