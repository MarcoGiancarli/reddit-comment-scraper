For anyone on Android I recommend download ""My Earthquake"" app and selecting the North America region so you can see what's going on. The big one was rated a 3.98 which scares me since I don't want to know what a 6 or greater feels like.  I dont have desks big enough for this shit"
bayarea,3e1yp3,Left4Head,30,Tue Jul 21 09:42:59 2015 UTC,"Yep, I heard it before I felt it and my house is less than a mile from the epicenter.  I actually thought someone was breaking into my room through the window, so I hid under the covers.  I guess I would be pretty useless in emergencies."
bayarea,3e1yp3,BananikaND,5,Tue Jul 21 10:48:27 2015 UTC,"If there's nothing heavy above you, just hiding under your covers and pillows isn't a bad action to take if there isn't something easy to get under nearby."
bayarea,3e1yp3,RobotKitten,31,Tue Jul 21 15:16:24 2015 UTC,there's nothing heavy above you   does a house count
bayarea,3e1yp3,runxctry,3,Tue Jul 21 15:21:14 2015 UTC,"Depends on the house. If it's legal and not really old you're probably okay.  The hiding under your covers thing is what my geology professor said to do, although he never mentioned if this was okay in a house that wanted to collapse."
bayarea,3e1yp3,RobotKitten,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:28:51 2015 UTC,"Assuming the roof didn't fall on you, would a bed be enough to protect your fall if the house collapsed? (and you were on the 2nd floor)"
bayarea,3e1yp3,rushingkar,4,Tue Jul 21 18:01:55 2015 UTC,if the house is collapsing there isn't much you can do. although i think if the house is up to code it's unlikely.  you're best off staying in your house and riding it out then trying to run outside or something.

Most of the houses in niles are really old, so when the quake woke me, my first thought was how unlikely it is that the house was built to widthstand an earthquake. Luckly it only shook for like 2 seconds.  My girlfriend just thought it was me shaking the bed by moving around."
bayarea,3e1yp3,DressedUpNowhere2Go,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:06:32 2015 UTC,I have been in two earthquakes around 7 on the scale in my life. Those ones screw up everything for a week or so afterwards (assuming you are in a first world location where they engineer for such things as much as possible).
bayarea,3e1yp3,Spazum,-2,Tue Jul 21 17:27:17 2015 UTC,"Sorry to laugh at you for being scared, but dude, it was only a 4. I've lived in NorCal all my life and been through plenty of those. No reason to get scared until it's getting up around 6 or more."
bayarea,3e1yp3,dirthawker0,9,Tue Jul 21 16:00:30 2015 UTC,I was scared because at the moment it happened I didn't know the potential of the quake. It was soft at first then shook hard for a second then slowed down again.

My other friends whose apartments are built into a big hill in San Rafael don't feel anything during earthquakes, while friends on flat land do.  Is this all anecdotal, or is there anything scientific behind this? Obviously some people will notice earthquakes and some won't, I'm not talking about that so much as how location might affect the shaking sensation."
bayarea,3e1yp3,bshift1,4,Tue Jul 21 12:14:02 2015 UTC,"Yes, location is one of the factors that influences shaking.  Here's a liquefaction hazard map of the bay area- basically the parts of the bay area that are on fill or sand will reach a more or less liquid state and shake like a bowl of jello, whereas if you're on bedrock, the shaking will be less severe.  http://gis.abag.ca.gov/website/Hazards/?hlyr=liqSusceptibility  Engineers use this data as one of the inputs to generate the base shear number that is used to determine how much force your building needs to resist"

So it ends up being an extra ~$20/order (Which goes against the whole point of ordering pizza...I'll pay those fees to have something like sushi delivered, but for pizza?)  Sadly looks like O'Sole doesn't deliver either. Fluc will deliver O'Sole but they have the prices way marked up. (Like $5 more a pizza, plus all the fees.) So same situation. I might try calling Rainbow, but I fear we may live too far north.  Thanks for trying! I'm just really over Pizza My Heart at this point. Ah, well..."

bayarea,3e12sg,Smelle,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:16:28 2015 UTC,"So, I'm taking a look at the moratorium bill that voters will vote on and it seems to be saying that letting developers create market-rate (which would be expensive and out of the price range of most citizens) units this reduces the options for creating affordable housing.  Is it reasonable to expect that, if this 18-month moratorium passes, that developers will proceed to make ""100% affordable housing projects"" (defined as 120% of area median income, which seems to be about $85k to $122k for 1 to 4 person households from these docs though I'm not sure how that translates to monthly rent) instead of luxury (and much more profitable) units? Or would they simply wait it out, taking it as a cost of business?  Or is the strategy to give affordable housing developers an 18-month window where they can develop without having to compete with higher prices?  Or will all of this simply result in another year and a half of rent going up in the Mission because there's no new development to meet increasing demand?  I'm fine with city planning and government intervention to ensure that affordable housing exists. I don't entirely trust developers and trickle-down market effects; incentives for profit don't always align with the public good.  But I'd only support something like this if it's a plan that will result in new affordable housing in the next few years. SF has been holding off on high density development for decades. I'd rather see luxury condos go up rather than no construction at all."
bayarea,3e12sg,AlSweigart,-2,Tue Jul 21 19:43:25 2015 UTC,"Our goal is not to stop all development,” said Edwin Lindo, vice president for external affairs for the San Francisco Latino Democratic Club, in an interview with the San Francisco Business Times. “Our goal is to stop incredibly large development that focus exclusively on market-rate housing.   I'm with this guy. Building a high-rise full of Market Value, $1 million+, condos is going to make that developer a lot of money.  Building housing that is anywhere near affordable-middle-class rate is much less profitable.  If it takes some government intervention to make sure that the middle and lower class don't get completely pushed out of SF, out of the Peninsula, out of the East and North Bay, out of Silicon Valley, than so be it.  If this new type of capitalism we find ourselves in (""The Sharing Economy"") only grows when people have enough to, every day, have a private driver take them the one mile from the King St. Caltrain to their office in SOMA, but not enough to hire a dedicated driver to bring them from Los Altos Hills to Mountain View, it may be time to look at how many consumers we could create if we didn't let 99% of our nation's wealth go into the pocket of the top 16,000 families in this country."
bayarea,3e12sg,nowellmaybe,4,Tue Jul 21 10:14:04 2015 UTC,"Having the rich buy and remodel existing houses will still happen and be quite profitable for developers.  We are not in a new type of Capitalism, but instead returned to the old ways by limiting taxes and regulations on the wealthy."

Also dependent on the line it may be raucous or unpleasant.  As far as other stuff, I looked into buffing, but the union is dead and I would've had to commute hours to make a couple bucks more than I was making already.  There's still carpentry or plumbing and such, but apprenticeship is usually awarded based on family/personal acquaintances.  Contractor stuff often requires expensive certifications.

So if you have a week's worth of Campbell's soup and a Costco sized flat of bottled water then you'll be able to survive.  Beyond that any extra preparation depends on how comfortable you want to be during the time but at a minimum you should be able to feed and hydrate yourself for a week.

All cards on the table: assume income of $130k, two kids under the age of 2, 2 dogs, 3 cats, and a wife that would stay home with the kids. An apartment will not work.   Would you do it?"
bayarea,3dyh2g,keylime503,28,Mon Jul 20 20:04:24 2015 UTC,130k to support 4 people with THIS cost of housing? No way. Definitely stay in the Midwest.
bayarea,3dyh2g,halcyon400,13,Mon Jul 20 20:29:51 2015 UTC,"Total household income of $130k? If you were single, that's enough for a reasonably nice 1br apartment/location and a modest lifestyle.   I wouldn't try to raise a family here on that, unless you are cool with less-than-desirable neighborhoods and schools and lengthy daily commutes.   Source: My fiancée and I have a combined income of more than that but we are planning on moving to another region with a lower cost of living before buying a house and starting a family.

bayarea,3dyh2g,finkydink,8,Mon Jul 20 20:32:16 2015 UTC,"In anywhere else, that is a great salary, but it won't get you much here. Coupled with 5 pets, you're pretty much out of luck with renting. It's hard enough to rent with 1 dog, but 5 pets is basically impossible. I assume you're not going to get rid of your pets. And buying is probably not going to work, there's such a shortage of housing and everything in the area is selling for over a million (for normal, small, plain houses). It'll be a strain to afford a house at $130k. You also need like 30% down payment to even be looked at seriously, so that's like 300k at least.  You might get an increase in salary, but you might actually be financially worse than your old job because the cost of living is so high."

bayarea,3dyh2g,12LetterName,2,Tue Jul 21 05:19:10 2015 UTC,"You're right, it can certainly make it difficult.  Having a good realtor and broker can go a long ways though.  Also FHA loans are going to be better on less desirable, less expensive fixers where there is less chance of a bidding war. (but more likely to be an all cash offer from an investor)  In the South Bay, It's probably not all that feasible."

Purchasing a home right now is damn near impossible as people are being outbid by several $100k in all cash offers with no contingencies.  Then you have to think about childcare/pre-school.  As your kids age, they'll need to go to pre-school which will cost between $950 and $1,300/mo.  Also, finding a house in a good school district will add to the cost.  If you want a night out, a babysitter will run you around $20/hour.  Then there's the gas which is at $3.50/gallon (remember, CA gas is more expensive due to state requirements).  Public transportation around here is minimal unless you are in SF so driving is a must.  I love the Silicon Valley.  The weather is practically perfect year round.  There are tons of activities not only for adults but also great playgrounds and parks catered to kids all over the South Bay.  The drought is a bummer and does take some getting used to but that wouldn't be a main factor in my mind for moving here.  Also, due to the locality of all the farms, you can find pretty fresh produce in the farmers markets and even grow your own if you have a backyard.  We have a variety of cultures and food and are pretty accepting of many different ways of life.  I do truly love living here but I would move in an instant if it meant we could actually save several thousands a month or purchase a home for less than $1 million that's a decent size, location and not a fixer upper.  We bought our fixer upper 1,200 sq ft 50 year old home for almost $500k and I don't want to do another renovation with young kids.  If it were me, I would look to Raleigh, Denver, Austin or Charleston.  I've been told all are promising tech hubs and the cost of living is far less."

I rent a condo, where the landscaping is taken care of by the HOA.   The drought is the least of your concerns that should affect your decision to move here.   Really, the only two major downsides that every one has in common are:  1) Cost of living. Housing is atrocious. Don't be fooled by a 6 figure salary. Taxes and rent will eat your money. Compare to the rest of world, my combined household income puts me at 97 percentile, but I still feel like I'm scraping by.  2) Commute. Commute is hell. I work in SF and I live in East Bay. Two hours of my day are gone due to commuting.  Also, since you are working for Apple, I'm guessing you plan on renting somewhere near South Bay. If you don't have any high school aged kids, I would avoid renting near any of the good high schools. South Bay is home to many of the top high schools in California, and that's a huge factor in determine housing price. Why pay a premium for an amenity that you won't use?"

Whatever offer you get made from that big tech company, it will look really big compared to what you are making in the midwest, but WILL leave you poorer once you get out here. It will be functionally a step DOWN in your quality of life, and thus a low-ball offer. Choose carefully. Maybe even do your research and be able to counter with a higher offer that actually reflects the COL here."

bayarea,3dyh2g,merreborn,10,Mon Jul 20 16:39:14 2015 UTC,"Also, don't just look at the list prices of homes.  Most people do this --scan Redfin or some such, and think they'll pay that list price or less, since that's how it is in the rest of the US.      Here you need to add at least 20%, as most homes go for over the asking price.      That said, it's not automatically bad to move here.  With the right job, it can make sense.  Know though that you will undoubtedly have a lesser home than in the midwest.  Depending on the salary variance though, you'll probably have more money for other things like travel, car, etc.  Make your decision accordingly.       For a single guy like myself, coming here has worked out well, and I was (just) able to buy a condo.  With a family though, I'd be hesitant.  Even a small single family home in a decent school neighborhood can easily require 400K plus of combined income."

Not only is the monthly payment higher, but the market is so hot right now that people who can qualify for a loan are getting beaten out by people who can pay with cash or have a large down payment (way higher than 20%).  So even if you can afford the monthly payments on a $1 million 1500 sq ft house, merely having $200K saved for a down payment may not be enough.  So if you want to buy a place, your salary needs to be high enough so that you can save up a ridiculous down payment.  Also, realistically, most people don't buy a house.

bayarea,3dzoy7,finkydink,2,Mon Jul 20 20:57:03 2015 UTC,"Yelp is a great tool and it doesn't really work where I'm from because no one uses it.  My sense is You may want to split the Job into carpet removal, floor refinishing, and painting separately because people tend to specialize and if someone is bidding on all the work at once they will probably subcontract out any bit of the work they don't want (while taking a cut). That costs more but it may be worth it to you."
bayarea,3dzoy7,Brostradamnus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:41:08 2015 UTC,I didn't realize carpet removal and floor finishing could be separately done. I already have painting done by a different person. Home ownership is scary.

Lordy lordy stop the presses and make room for the feel train.  For the record, average wages are a joke meant to convince idiots to follow other idiots.  A couple millionaire move into a town with a bunch of blue collar workers making 35-50k a year, and your ""average wage"" is going to fucking sky-rocket.  It's the most pointless figure there has ever been in this conversation about the rising cost of the bay area, or any city for that matter."
bayarea,3dv9hn,normanlee,15,Sun Jul 19 20:26:43 2015 UTC,"From a Yelp Review:  Honestly, when I first heard about a place called ""Porno Palace"" I was pretty scared. However, its just a nickname given by the Oakland locals because of the rather interesting and unique décor of the restaurant. (seemingly porno looking posters on the inside walls).

bayarea,3dv9hn,pain_perdu,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:46:26 2015 UTC,"That's one of the more common reasons I've heard given, but having been there quite frequently a few years back, I can't say I found anything about the decor very scandalous. The posters inside seem like pretty standard movie posters with graffiti all over them. But I guess that's just all it takes sometimes for a nickname to stick."
bayarea,3dv9hn,mantrap2,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:38:19 2015 UTC,Not porn pictures even.  Honestly a lot of movies are advertised in Asia with that style of painting (yes they actually paint movie posters and murals).
bayarea,3dv9hn,andee510,12,Mon Jul 20 00:28:32 2015 UTC,"Like others have said, it's called that because of the posters on the wall. I used to go there the time, but we called it Porno Bar. We liked it because you could ask for an ashtray and smoke inside (not legal, but no one cared).  We stopped going there a few years ago because a friend of mine was murdered outside by a drunken idiot. Vince was a good guy, and we've never been able to go back after that."
bayarea,3dv9hn,Difluoromethane,9,Mon Jul 20 00:26:56 2015 UTC,"Holy shit, condolences. How'd it happen?  E: I guess it's this? http://www.dailycal.org/2011/08/07/hayward-man-convicted-of-fatally-shooting-former-uc-berkeley-senior/  That must have been horrific :("
bayarea,3dv9hn,andee510,11,Mon Jul 20 01:25:57 2015 UTC,"Thanks. It was really shitty because it was a situation where everyone had too much to drink, and one tough guy thought he was a gangster. Anyways, I just can't ever go back there. Sucks because we used to frequent that place."
bayarea,3dv9hn,Sublimotion,2,Mon Jul 20 02:10:46 2015 UTC,"Never knew him, but I remember seeing him around school for a year or two and was a bit shock to learn it was him. So it still kinda hit me a bit despite that.   Though the last 2 times I went there recently, I do notice there isn't much of that ""ghetto baller"" wannabe crowd like back then. My guess is that trend/mentality has kinda phased out with the younger generation."
bayarea,3dv9hn,iDuLicious,7,Tue Jul 21 04:16:52 2015 UTC,Such a big name for something as little as posters on a wall. You gotta give it up to the marketing team on this one.
bayarea,3dv9hn,The_Battler,-5,Sun Jul 19 20:58:06 2015 UTC,You think you're cool huh
bayarea,3dv9hn,MagicPistol,5,Mon Jul 20 06:37:14 2015 UTC,"Not only the posters, but I think they had a lot more pornographic images up a long time ago."
bayarea,3dv9hn,Ophasnoclue,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:21:10 2015 UTC,Porno Palace? It's called Porno Bar.
