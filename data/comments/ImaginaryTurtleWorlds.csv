Its carapace forms the vault of the heavens, while its plastron is the foundation of the Earth—particularly the Indian subcontinent. When the Hindu gods churned the ocean of milk (the Milky Way) to create many things and beings, they asked Kurma to dive to the bottom to support the mountain they used for a dash, with the great serpent Sesha-Naga as a rope."

Also in yurtle the turtle, they are on earth, so they have the gravity of the earth, but in this case the world is on the back of a turtle, so it would be like stacking worlds on top of one another until they fell over like the story. So I think you can stack turtles infinitely because there is no gravity being applied on them so nothing would make them fall over?"
ImaginaryTurtleWorlds,3d5t4y,EStork11,3,Tue Jul 14 06:46:37 2015 UTC,"When a stack of turtles collapses, the stack becomes a pile.  A pile of turtles is a fairly-stable construction.  .   Turtles gone out for a roam  like piggybacks to get back home.  Stacked way up high into the sky,  they look just like a turtle pie.  So if you see them on your track  remember that a turtle stack  puts all the weight on four small legs,  stuck out the sides like little pegs.  So please be careful, don’t cause a scare  or stack will become a pile right there,  as turtles tumble down into a heap;  a pile of turtles for you to leap.  So tiptoe round ‘cos there’s a lack  of turtles who know how to stack,  instead they all just to waddle round  with four feet planted on the ground.  But stacking turtles, that’s a treat,  a thing I hope one day you’ll meet.  To see the joy that turtles feel  if they can keep an even keel  while building stacks to look about  should make us want to jump and shout.  But remember not to scare this treat,  if Stacking Turtles you should meet.   Stacking Turtles"

ImaginaryTurtleWorlds,3beoal,ConfusingDalek,9,Sun Jun 28 15:09:06 2015 UTC,"It's actually very simple when you get used to it.   The rules basically just say that when you come here for the first time you are required to delete every post and comment you make in here, this is simple because you have not posted here before which is against rule one and is therefor not allowed. Because you deleted whatever content you posted here you have therefore broken the rules and your next post will be removed by the mods. We mods really can't keep track of it all ourselves so you will need to do it yourself or you will have broken another rule which will mean you will be punished by you.  Anyone who deliberately breaks the rule will be required to feel severe shame, if the person does not actually follow this rule they will need to ban themselves by removing all content they post here. Just remember to make sure you keep posting so you don't break rule 1 again which would mean you would have to remove your next post, which would be a shame.  But really, this rule is basically just sort of more like a kind of guideline than it is a rule, in the sense that it is enforced very strictly and breaking it will result in serious punishment (acted out by the user breaking the rule).   I hope this helps you understand our rules better. I know the way they are currently written down in the sidebar is very confusing, I've tried to get them changed to something more clear like this comment. But the head mod /u/Lol33ta is a very serious and uptight person and is very strict about the way this sub is run. This is also why we are not allowed to use puns in our titles and only don't get fed on Thursdays.  If you have any questions feel free to ask."

ImaginaryTurtleWorlds,3beoal,Luteraar,7,Sun Jun 28 17:50:59 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure why you're still confused, but let me put it this way:    The way we try to run this sub is primarily based on the views the Spanish philosopher José Ortega y Gasset had on the pre civil war Spanish education and it's need to be reformed in order the successfully bring forth everyone's full potential. While these works are not his most famous, nor most influential writings and were mostly comprised on articles in local newspapers and letters to his friends, they are very popular among various Mediterranean private schools, internet forums (like us) and a couple of cultists.   We enjoy his other works too, and some pages in our wiki were inspired by his views on reality and existence, but most of us don't fully agree with his works after 1947 because we feel WWII has severely influenced the general tone of his writing.  Some people have also compared our style of moderation with Bushido, mainly because the way we deal with rule-breakers and their punishment. And while I very much agree rule 1 bears a lot of similarities with the way disgraced noble warriors in feudal Japan were often dealt with (I'm sure you see why), I don't personally like the comparison because the Japanese had very controversial views back then regarding some issues we take quite seriously."
