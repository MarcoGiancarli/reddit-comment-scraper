Charleston,3e4n3b,Seamannator,2,Tue Jul 21 22:40:00 2015 UTC,Thanks for the heads up! I'm surprised that they're not playing in Jacksonville.  http://sufjan.com/

Charleston,3e2w7n,behughes,26,Tue Jul 21 15:22:42 2015 UTC,Bundle the trip by going to firefly distillery as well.  It's about another 10 minutes down the road and you can do the liquor tasting (for a small fee) or wine tasting (also a fee).  Sometimes they have food available for purchase as well on the weekends.
Charleston,3e2w7n,bimmerman1998,10,Tue Jul 21 15:54:30 2015 UTC,"Or bundle the trip with the Charleston Tea Plantation, which is also nearby. All you can drink tea plus a trolley your around the plantation. Makes for a good half day."
Charleston,3e2w7n,HectorPootin,6,Tue Jul 21 19:30:25 2015 UTC,This combination makes the trip worth it.
Charleston,3e2w7n,Downhill_Sprinter,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:17:13 2015 UTC,"Don't do the wine tasting. The liquor is pretty good though, they have a partnership with buffalo trace distillery. Agree, bundle in the tea plantation as well."
Charleston,3e2w7n,tanandblack,7,Wed Jul 22 05:42:57 2015 UTC,Go for BBQ before at JB's and it is worth it
Charleston,3e2w7n,ThatFluffyBunny,3,Tue Jul 21 17:41:46 2015 UTC,"Agreed, love me some JB's! Just note that they're a wed-sat operation."
Charleston,3e2w7n,gman0009,5,Tue Jul 21 21:36:49 2015 UTC,"It is really big, it is free, there's nothing to do, it takes 10 min to look at. I would say yes. But don't take a whole day to do it. However it is just a tree, but if you like trees..."
Charleston,3e2w7n,Bearwitness5,3,Tue Jul 21 15:48:23 2015 UTC,It's certainly worth seeing at least once in your life.
Charleston,3e2w7n,lazzeri,5,Tue Jul 21 16:09:42 2015 UTC,"Absolutely worth it!!  I make a point to take guests visiting town there and every single one is amazed by it.  While it is ""just a tree"" the sheer size of it is awesome.  Also, you could get a fantastic brunch at the Fat Hen if it is on saturday or sunday."
Charleston,3e2w7n,bicman3,3,Tue Jul 21 16:58:52 2015 UTC,"The Angel Oak is gorgeous and a fantastic way to spend half an hour, but I don't know if I'd drive all the way from Columbia to see it. However, some of my other favorite things in town are in that area. The drive is very scenic and you can totally make an afternoon of them all!   Go to lunch at the Tomato Shed on Main Road. Get the tomato pie and grab some chocolate zucchini bread for later! Head to the Angel Oak for a few minutes. See the Charleston Tea Plantation, sample some free tea and grab a box or two to take home with you. Their Earl Grey is my favorite. (DON'T go on the trolley tour, though. Waste of $10).  Run out to Irvin-House Vineyard/Firefly Distillery (their tasting rooms are right next to each other). Two tips: Even if wine isn't your thing, make sure to try the grape juice at the vineyard. It's delicious. :) Also, if you don't want to get completely bombed while you're there, but want to do both tastings, I'd suggest sharing them with someone else. They don't mind if you do it that way.   All of this will take maybe 4 hours. Great, CHEAP way to spend an afternoon."
Charleston,3e2w7n,misslurk,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:07:29 2015 UTC,Definitely worth it! I've never seen a tree like it! Take the others' suggestions and pair the trip with a stop at Firefly or Charleston Tea Plantation. I live in Cola and can give you suggestions on things to do there if you're interested!
Charleston,3e2w7n,Torqueso,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:03:01 2015 UTC,It IS just a big tree. But it's really really big. And really really pretty. Pictures don't do it justice.
Charleston,3e2w7n,Caladriel,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:32:25 2015 UTC,Here is what you do. Bundle it with something else. The tree really is quite spectacular if you have any appreciation for nature. I was really skeptical about it but I'm quite close and I was pleasantly surprised by how cool it was. Unfortunately there isn't really anything to do other than be wowed by it for a bit so don't expect it to take more than an hour out of your day.
Charleston,3e2w7n,doctorcrass,-1,Tue Jul 21 23:05:47 2015 UTC,"Well, it's just a tree. It's a bit more fun if you're stoned out of your gourd."

Charleston,3e3jxw,nazihatinchimp,3,Tue Jul 21 18:07:00 2015 UTC,"I would think 45,000 would be a good ballpark for your minimum for entry level. Check out glassdoor.com though."
Charleston,3e3jxw,AceHiStation,3,Tue Jul 21 18:23:14 2015 UTC,Glassdoor says 75k. I feel like that is high.
Charleston,3e3jxw,AceHiStation,2,Tue Jul 21 18:23:57 2015 UTC,"I would have guessed depending on the companies you would be applying for you would range from 45,000-70,000. I started in an entry-level consulting/programming role at Blackbaud about 10 years ago at 43,000 FWIW. So I guess based on time 50,000 is probably a more accurate minimum. 75,000 seems very high though, so I'd definitely take that if you got an offer for that!"
Charleston,3e3jxw,67726e,2,Tue Jul 21 18:31:10 2015 UTC,"Unless you have have some extensive non-professional background, or knowledge in a very high demand niche, expecting 75K for entry level (that is, assuming 0 years on your resume) is very high. Here is the entire breakdown of my 4 years and what I've made:  [Company #1] 1 1/2 years (10 up to 16, paid hourly) - Spent as an intern, was doing the same thing I did at that company as a salaried employee 2 years (~55K/year) - Basically would have been making that at 1 1/2 years with if not for budgetary constraints when I left school and went full-time. 2 1/2 years (~75K/year) - At that point my boss felt I was being paid commensurate with my skills. I never asked for a raise, these were given to me mind you, so its possible I could have commanded a higher salary, but like many of us I was skittish about salary when starting out, I just said ""Sure, that's plenty of money for a 20 year old, not gonna rock the boat""  [Company #2] 3 years - Left for a startup, basically took an overall cut in benefits, but pay stayed the same.   [Company #3] 3 1/2 years (~80K) - Left #3 because it was a shit show. Currently employee #1 at a startup, doing everything from architecting the systems to systems administration. Personally, I feel a bit underpaid at this position, especially given the hours and skill at this point, and my pay will be upped once we're making actual money (product launch yesterday!)  Of course keep in mind there are different tradeoffs to be made with different companies. At Company #1 we had a bonus pool, so one could get another 5K-10K on top of salary. At the startups, there is equity/options (pay attention to the vesting period). Then you have time-off to consider, the trendy thing is ""Unlimited Vacation"" which, for lots of places, is just a way to keep PTO off of the books in an effort to save money. The culture of the company will dictate how much you will take off in practice, either the policy was some MBA trying to cut costs or your higher ups truly care and want you to not burn out. You'll probably have the implicit expectation of 2-3 weeks of actual time off. Then you have the intangibles, like do you have a flexible schedule, can you work remotely, and does your boss have a boat :)  I know a handful of people who recently graduated from CofC and have recently (or are still looking) and I've heard low-ball offers as low as 35K, but the typical range seems to be 50-55K. A few months back I asked my boss what he would consider a typical range for a fresh graduate, with maybe a 6-month internship and he said basically expect anything in the 50K range.  My path/experience was also slightly atypical. I moved here straight out of highschool and had a paid internship while attending CofC, which I left during my second year and went fulltime salaried. I'm one of those ""been programming since middle school"" cases, and had done some freelancing in high school even, so I wasn't a fresh graduate entering the workforce with a BS in CS, thus your mileage may vary. Hopefully that gives you a fairly decent idea of the market."

Charleston,3e4txg,Red_Raptor,-1,Tue Jul 21 23:56:22 2015 UTC,Wal-Mart!!!!
Charleston,3e4txg,savv01,4,Wed Jul 22 01:20:59 2015 UTC,Doubtful. I believe the city has said they won't let a Walmart downtown.  Perhaps Target though. It's a little nicer and there isn't really one nearby.
Charleston,3e4txg,rayray21,0,Wed Jul 22 01:31:04 2015 UTC,Heard a well placed rumor that it's Whole Foods.
Charleston,3e4txg,Whinedanddined,2,Wed Jul 22 02:12:33 2015 UTC,It's not.
Charleston,3e4txg,imagineskyscrapers,0,Wed Jul 22 02:19:29 2015 UTC,Definitely too close for a Whole Foods or Trader Joes but I'd buy a Harris Teeter or Walmart Town Store any day considering their growth lately.
Charleston,3e4txg,Whinedanddined,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:37:17 2015 UTC,"Honestly, the logistics of any major grocery store chain would be too difficult. There isn't any great place for deliveries. There's the side dock, but a store like Harris Teeter is getting multiple large truck deliveries a day. It would be too difficult. Not to mention parking. Even with the garage, you need somewhere for employees to park."
Charleston,3e4txg,imagineskyscrapers,0,Wed Jul 22 02:47:29 2015 UTC,"Very true, but how the heck do H&Ms trucks get in there!? Employees can take garage spots as they do for half the Ann St garage.   I can dream, can't I??? 😀"
Charleston,3e4sx0,reverendrambo,5,Tue Jul 21 23:25:45 2015 UTC,No thanks. Let's not go down this path. I'm fine with renaming the street if another large street is renamed after SC's only connection to the White House...  We all hate Hitler but pretending he never existed is idiotic.
Charleston,3e4sx0,SouthofBroad,3,Wed Jul 22 00:41:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I agree. If our sins outweigh our worth, then we shouldn't name any streets after anyone."
Charleston,3e460u,stephgotschall,2,Tue Jul 21 20:37:56 2015 UTC,West Ashley seems like a good area for that price range :) look for houses to rent out of though. Usually a bit cheaper.
Charleston,3e460u,Rodhlann,2,Tue Jul 21 23:28:09 2015 UTC,"If you want to live downtown and the 700-900 represents your part of the rent then it should be pretty easy to find a nice place with a roommate or two.

Charleston,3e0zlx,imagineskyscrapers,18,Tue Jul 21 03:04:19 2015 UTC,"I think this is a good first step. The plan looks a little too harsh and broad as it is currently written, but I am glad the city is doing something to address this.   For a city that is as concerned with tourism and appearances as our city is, seeing panhandlers at every intersection really makes us look bad.   I can't even say that I feel bad for the pandhandlers, because there are resources available to them in the form of outreaches, shelters and other charities. I have seen comments from others saying that many of them aren't even truly in need, but simply exploiting generosity of motorists for easy money. I don't know how true this is, but the way things are right now should not be acceptable to the general public."
Charleston,3e0zlx,bozboy204,10,Tue Jul 21 04:22:10 2015 UTC,"It's true - I've been hit up for ""bus fare"" here plenty of times only to see someone get cash from a few people, walk off, get into a car and drive away. Another time I stopped at a light behind someone at shift change. The driver got out and took the sign, the person holding the sign got in and drove off."

I always got hit up by this bald, mid-30s guy at the corner of Meeting & Calhoun on the way too and from work. He would always have an MUSC wristband on and spin some yarn about getting dropped off by a friend and having an expired bus pass. I fell for it the first time, but a week later was at the same spot and tried the same story. That man single-handedly killed my charitable nature."

Charleston,3e0zlx,munch_the_gunch,3,Tue Jul 21 13:36:20 2015 UTC,Totally saw a white kid in his early 20's out begging downtown. He had a full sleeve of expensive tattoos. His overweight gf sitting there on the curb watching him had a face full of piercings and was smoking cigarettes. So 2 able-bodied people would rather go out and ask for handouts instead of maybe working for it and learning not to spend their money on stupid shit. Made me mad.

Charleston,3e0zlx,battlethroat,6,Tue Jul 21 12:39:42 2015 UTC,There are other methods for fundraisers for them.  See: boyscouts outside lowes selling popcorn.  I'd imagine organizations could also apply for an exemption permit for a particular day for legitimate events as you mention.
Charleston,3e0zlx,bigDIII,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:58:17 2015 UTC,What about the other groups that do this same thing?  I remember in college running toll roads for my fraternity at some of the popular intersections to raise money for charity.  Certainly we didn't have any special training and quite honestly it was the fastest way for us to meet fund raising goals (granted it was a LONG day).
Charleston,3e0zlx,onizaru,0,Tue Jul 21 15:50:01 2015 UTC,"This is one of the first things that I thought about. You could get around it by stating that you need specific emergency training or would need to use emergency vehicles with flashing lights, but people love to give to firemen so much that simply putting some red and whites in a parking lot with obvious men walking around with boots and you'll get people stopping in. Heck, I love to take my son up to firetrucks if they are letting kids inside and around and and I'll definitely throw them some cash, probably more than usual."

Charleston,3e0zlx,dirtyseaotter,-3,Tue Jul 21 05:58:05 2015 UTC,Yes! Please move the panhandlers from the stop lights to the dimly lit parking lots/garages for our safety.  Why not setup toll booths with those big coin catching funnel things so the panhandlers can sit in the shade and greet drivers safely?
Charleston,3e0zlx,tisokan,11,Tue Jul 21 11:26:22 2015 UTC,"Because we shouldn't eg people on to panhandle.  A lot people who do it are faking it anyways, not all of them of course."
Charleston,3e0zlx,dirtyseaotter,-8,Tue Jul 21 13:26:37 2015 UTC,No one would dare fake being poor or homeless for profit.  They have real problems and the best way to help them is to setup roadside panhandler toll booths.

Charleston,3e0sal,ICreepsItReal,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:01:06 2015 UTC,We are looking for a small to medium size dog. We prefer small. We are looking for a younger dog (like less than a year old) but are willing to make exceptions for the right dog. Ideally we'd like a yorkie puppy. We would also consider other small breed dogs and shelties (medium sized dogs). I'm just trying to figure out the right places that I should be looking and the right people to contact. Thanks!

Charleston,3dy6n5,munch_the_gunch,4,Mon Jul 20 14:30:14 2015 UTC,"This is a great guide. I think you can pick up a copy at Half Moon Outfitters.   One of my favs that's easy from Mt P, is taking Gadensville Boat Landing (about 2 miles past HWY 41 going north on 17) to Capers Island. It's about a 45 min paddle, but you need to time it right and not leave or come back at dead low tide."
Charleston,3dy6n5,gman0009,2,Mon Jul 20 19:25:57 2015 UTC,I learned the hard way about that launch at low tide.  Some muddy hands and some cursing though and I made it out...   ...barely.  My wife and I saw a pilot whale once out near Capers doing that run.
Charleston,3dy6n5,CantBeatPie,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:22:06 2015 UTC,"Oh wow, I didnt know there was a whole book about it. Thats great! I live just a couple of miles away from the Gadsdenville landing. I'll definitely check that out when the tides are right."
Charleston,3dy6n5,LordBlumpkin,3,Tue Jul 21 13:35:10 2015 UTC,"Head up to Awendaw area, near the Buck Hall recreation area are some solid spots to launch out (especially the one at the end of the Palmetto Trail (Awendaw Passage). Bring bug spray though!  A lot of that area feeds into the intracoastal water ways which you could paddle out to Bull Island or Capers Island for some overnight camping, if you're into that."
Charleston,3dy6n5,Forgainst_it,2,Mon Jul 20 15:20:15 2015 UTC,Just checked it out on Google earth. It looks pretty awesome up there! I'll have to give that a shot next weekend. And it's legal to set up camp out on those islands?
Charleston,3dy6n5,LordBlumpkin,3,Mon Jul 20 17:19:53 2015 UTC,Yes.  Camp on the beach if you want to live (bugs).
Charleston,3dy6n5,LordBlumpkin,2,Mon Jul 20 17:39:03 2015 UTC,"Definitely set up shop on the beach, the bugs are unbearable this time of year (it's better to go on a abnormally hot weekend in like January/Feb).   Legally, you need to contact DNR that you are planning on camping on Capers and get a pass, which is super easy to do, but I've been out there a couple times without and never had any problems.  Happy Paddling!"
Charleston,3dy6n5,CantBeatPie,2,Mon Jul 20 17:45:10 2015 UTC,"Another note: if you are planning doing an overnight trip, I'd consider launching out at Gadsdenville Public Boat Landing. It's a nice, ~2.5 mile trek to Capers from that location."
Charleston,3dy6n5,Al_Grain,3,Mon Jul 20 17:49:42 2015 UTC,Sol Legere boat launch (off Folly Road out before Folly Beach) to the north end of Kiawah on the Stono is a nice paddle and if you go near low tide you stand a good chance of seeing dolphins strand feed along the north bank of the Stono.  I usually time it to ride the tide out and back using the Snake Island tide prediction.
Charleston,3dy6n5,Al_Grain,2,Mon Jul 20 23:19:31 2015 UTC,"If you're looking for a good workout, the Edgewater Park Loop via Coburg Creek is a fun and easy one in West Ashley.  Drive down Wappoo Rd to the bridge before Edgewater Park, park on the far side of the bridge and hop in by the power boxes on the Stono River side.  If the tide is coming in start out on the creek side, if the tide is falling (going out) start out on the Stono side.  This is to make it easier to make it through Elliott Cut.  DO NOT DO THIS ON A SATURDAY OR SUNDAY.  The Elliott Cut portion of this route is arguably the most dangerous 1/8 mile of water in Charleston.  Its a good ride on a weekday when traffic is slow, but on a weekend there's too much traffic and its not safe (unless early AM).  Anyways, Coburg Creek hits the Wappoo at the South Windermere neighborhood, that's how you make the loop around Edgewater Park.  Kind of crazy to think that neighborhood was once a part of James Island.  PM me if you'd like more info, I've dug up some fun history on Coburg Creek and its role in WWII and as the Intercoastal Waterway up to the 30's."

Charleston,3dtzc2,Clemalum07,2,Sun Jul 19 15:02:24 2015 UTC,"There is a 1/8 mile dirt track in Sumter but I personally never heard of sprints going there due to its size.  All the tracks around here have been shut down and demolished for housing developments.  We use to have a 1/4 mile asphalt track in Summerville as well as a 1/4 mile dragstrip in Moncks Corner which was awesome but like I said houses and that.  If you don't mind the drive there a 1/4 mile dirt track in Savannah, Georgia still runs on Saturdays but other than that I am not sure.  Funny how when I lived in San Diego I could take a 45 minute ride to an awesome 1/2 mile dirt track and watch the world of outlaws.  I move back to the South were racing is more prevalent and there's only one dinky dirt track an hour away.  If you're just in need of the sights and smells of the track Mrytle Beach has a nice 1/2 mile asphalt track."
Charleston,3dtzc2,colonel_claypool,3,Sun Jul 19 15:59:27 2015 UTC,The track off cypress gardens road between Summerville and mocks corner was only 1/8 mile. Still sucks losing it.
Charleston,3dtzc2,cthompson07,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:21:22 2015 UTC,That's right it was only 1/8 mile my mistake. It was sad to see it got torn down there was some good racing at the ole Cooper River dragstrip.  I loved watching people race their car they drove to the track;  By their third or fourth run the motor or drive train would just take a shit on them haha.  My Uncle lived behind Summerville Speedway and use to drive his Thunder and Lightning class car up to the track.  Sad to see these tracks I spent a good deal of time at as a child gone now but prosperity will ensue.
Charleston,3dtzc2,colonel_claypool,2,Sun Jul 19 18:10:36 2015 UTC,"I was surprised there aren't more racing attractions down here as well.  In Ohio there were numerous 1/2 mile and 1/4 mile tracks that would host big shows like the Outlaws.  This weekend was the Kings Royal at Eldora, a show I'd go to almost every year, which really has me wanting to go.  I'll look into the track in Savannah, the 1/4 mile tracks can be more entertaining than the half miles.  I'm also looking at making the trip to Charlotte for the Outlaw finals... watching the sprint cars, late models and modifieds in one weekend sounds fun."

My first World of Outlaws race I watched was in Perris, California about forty five minutes north of Oceanside, California(San Diego County).  I seen people wearing googles and pouring their beer into cups with lids and thought to myself what in the hell is wrong with these people .  I should have followed their lead instead of looking at them like they were nuts.  The other classes slung a little clay but nothing too serious but the Outlaws did not fuck around haha.  I had a good 1/4"" of clay in the bottom of my beer every time I took a swig and I was covered in it head to toe by the time the checkered flag came out.

Charleston,3dsf2y,Whinedanddined,2,Sun Jul 19 15:09:08 2015 UTC,"I ran it in 2015 for the first time. I'm probably not a good judge of how crowded it was because I was in a seeded corral (40-45 min), but the race itself was organized with corrals, efficient packet pick up the days before, etc.   One hint if you run it and are local is that you can pick your packet up in the 2 weeks before the event by going to the Bridge Run Store on Shelmore Blvd in Mt. Pleasant. Saves you from going to the expo!   The course is lined with bands and musical acts- The reggae band when you get off the Ravenel was the BEST! They were really pumped for the runners and from what I understand, are at that same spot every year.   At the finish, I saw tons of food and snack items, but I also saw people taking bags and filling them with muffins, fruit, donuts, etc :(. I do hope there was enough for everyone.  If you don't want to do the organized run, just go run the bridge from parking in Mt. Pleasant. You can't run the course anytime, as the actual race course takes you down Meeting Street and the end of the pedestrian path takes you down East Bay, but it's fun to just run and walk the bridge anytime (and it's FREE!)."
Charleston,3dsf2y,ProudPatriot07,0,Mon Jul 20 00:56:24 2015 UTC,"Since the Ravenel has been open, you can run almost the entire course whenever you want. Running the bridge with tens of thousands of other people is what makes it The Bridge Run."

Charleston,3dpm5w,Tinalynn12991,13,Sat Jul 18 05:43:12 2015 UTC,You really don't need to be concerned. Charleston is really very safe and very tolerant compared to many places in the south. Safest and soberest are close by would be mount pleasant (very yuppie) but would require driving to get anywhere interesting. West Ashley would be cheaper rent. Downtown is great but I love to drink.  MUSC has a good nursing program. Don't know if it's difficult to get in.
Charleston,3dpm5w,Colonel_Froth,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:16:58 2015 UTC,Wow thank you so much. I'll defintitley look into mount pleasant although west Ashley seems like the way to go as of now.

Charleston,3dpm5w,elephantstudio,7,Wed Jul 22 06:19:54 2015 UTC,"Daniel Island is stunningly beautiful but it's a kinda Stepford Wivesy, expensive, mostly white, & conservative type of area. It's a bedroom community with one restaurant bar that everyone there hangs out at. Almost everyone dresses like they're about to go golfing or boating. Nobody goes there for anything else socially unless there's a good concert at the tennis stadium.   If you're a liberal young couple and you enjoy the arts and good food, I'd give a serious look at West Ashley & James Island. Park Circle is also a very hip area, kind of like Brooklyn before it became overly gentrified. The best thing you can do is spend some time and check out a bunch of the neighborhoods. Look at where all the places are that you would picture yourself hanging out or working and make your decision that way."
Charleston,3dpm5w,whatyouwere,3,Sat Jul 18 12:33:01 2015 UTC,"Came here to recommend Park Circle too. Lots of restaurants and things to do, but not overly wild at night. And one of the most liberal areas in Charleston, but I honestly wouldn't see y'all running into intolerance problems in any of the more populated areas."
Charleston,3dpm5w,thelazerirl,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:54:32 2015 UTC,"Park Circle also has a lesbian bar, Deja Vu II, that has THE BEST wings by Rita on Thursdays. I go there as a straight man and it's great."

Charleston,3dpm5w,MrFahrenheit39,7,Sun Jul 19 02:46:46 2015 UTC,"As far as I know Trident Tech still has a really good nursing program as well in case MUSC is super backed up.   As far as location West Ashley is pretty equidistant to most things Charleston has to offer. There are some rougher spots in town, but overall it's very nice and I've never had any issue being out late at night in the area.  I don't have a ton of anecdotal evidence to support it, but people love their dogs here just like anywhere else. So I think for the pet sitting you just have to get out and advertise strongly where ever you guys decide to stay and then strong word of mouth will get out about you."
Charleston,3dpm5w,pacifictrim,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:23:52 2015 UTC,"That's good to hear about pet sitting.

Charleston,3dpm5w,elephantstudio,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:10:54 2015 UTC,"I'll give it to you straight... MUSC is tough to get into for other medicine-related professions. I don't know about nursing but as a med school, PA school, etc., it ain't no cake walk. I can only assume the nursing program won't be a cake walk either. Everyone in the state wants to go there so it's quite competitive. Then add in all the people applying from out-of-state, and they get tons of applications. They really like to consider SC residents first and foremost as well so establishing residency here beforehand will certainly help.  Trident Tech certainly seems like a great option, too! Just don't want to give you any false hopes that you'll for sure get into MUSC."

I can't think of whether I've seen any pet sitters, but I've seen a few pet bakeries (homemade biscuits, etc) so that's a pretty good indicator of where you'll find a population willing to go for a sitter."
Charleston,3dpm5w,Aktor,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:27:09 2015 UTC,Lol. We have communities up here that aren't so accepting but we just do our best to avoid them. Good to know there's some options down south too.

I can give you a ton of information on schools and decisions. Lgbt community is coming along great down here. I am liberal myself so I love knowing we are growing in population (although my in-laws would disagree!) Daniel Island and Mt. Pleasant are considered the top tier areas of Charleston and the most expensive. I don't think you can go wrong with any of those areas even west Ashley. My wife and kids love this area specifically for the restaurants. Night life area is mainly downtown but sporadic in West Ashley, Summerville, mt pleasant and James island. Let me know if you have any other questions and welcome to the area!"

I'm gonna take a look at trident tech and if I have any questions I'll definitley pm you. How's the job market there and if you don't mind me asking, what's the starting salary?"
Charleston,3dpm5w,Caadar,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:51:31 2015 UTC,Trident usually has a year waiting list but they have one of the more respected programs and it can be a hell of a lot cheaper than some other places. The nursing market always has jobs available even though the schools down here are graduating at least 100 students every May. So that's probably 300 graduates every year fighting for open positions. It can be tough right after you graduate. It took me two months to find a job after graduation! Hope this info helps.  If you have any other questions let me know!

Charleston,3doldo,speedsterRR,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:39:54 2015 UTC,"Something tells me Charles Rivers Laboratory is harvesting 1/3 of these horseshoe crab's blood; returning them to the ocean; and it's not enough blood left to keep them alive creating these death beaches. Growing up, always thought commercial crabbers and shrimpers were accidentally killing/drowning them and throwing the carcasses back into the ocean to float up on to the beaches... it has now hit me that a beach full of horseshoe crabs couldn't die from shrimping boats. Every year the local beaches have dead horseshoe crabs in large masses scattered along the beaches. From what DNR and some newspaper articles have explained is the female die after mating season as well as water pollution problems. There are more pros than cons to killing horseshoe crab for there blood because the blue blood can and will eventually save a lot of human lives, but got a gut instinct that Charles Rivers Laboratory here in Charleston is dumping the crabs back into the ocean and a majority of them are not surviving. I'm not against it because the outcome of harvesting these crabs out weighs the cons, but it would be interesting to dig deeper?!"

I've dealt with feelings of anxiety and depression in the past. I made it clear to Dr. Kollar that I wasn't interested in drugs. He offered me a solution that resolved negative ""self-talk"" through cognitive therapy. He also helped me improve my overall well-being through lifestyle changes. I've been depression-free for over 2 years now, and I contribute that to the concepts and methods introduced to me by Dr. Kollar. Everyone's situation is inherently different.  I cannot say that mine would work for everybody else.  But I would encourage anyone with problems to continue exploring solutions to help better themselves."

Your eyes roll in anticipation of yet another out of towner to awkwardly hint at the fix they desperately want: chemical, flesh or otherwise. They start justify what they want before saying it, ""Im not a bad person"", ""I want to experience local culture, and history y'know"", ""I need it, bad, and I dont know where to find it."" They sigh, and one final subtle thought becomes speech, ""Besides, Im the customer, and you want me to be happy right?"" and there it was, the magic password of the hospitality and tourism industry, well that and the implied tip that would accompany the fulfillment of the eventual request. Nodding and leaning forward, you ask what it is they need. ""A flag,"" their eyes dart back and forth to check for eavesdroppers, ""dont make me say it, you know,..of the, rebel variety."" Your mouth opens in shock, you have no idea where to get one. ""To Reddit!"" you exclaim, as the hunt begins.

Charleston,3dg8ht,ihavesixfingers,3,Thu Jul 16 00:57:13 2015 UTC,I have heard Classic is one of the more reputable companies.  Some of their drivers have masters in history. That being said you will not be able to choose your route with any company. The routes are randomly assigned prior to departure. If you have a specific area you are interested in touring you might be better off with a walking tour. Also some of the companies give there employees free tickets to give away each day. So with 8-13 you might want to walk down market find the sales people for the carriage company not third party. You might be able to save a few bucks good luck.

Charleston,3dduu6,Noseplug547,6,Wed Jul 15 14:29:39 2015 UTC,"Do you have a chest freezer?  If not, get one.  Then I recommend looking into buying a beef side (which is half a cow) from Cordray's farms.  You can also do beef shares( 1/8 a cow) which is about 80lbs of meat for about $350.  But with the shares, you don't get to decide how and what you get.  Which is why I go with a beef side.  Right now, they are sold out.  But going into 2016, you could get on their list.    A beef side is about 300lbs of meat at around $4/lb.  You tell them how you want it cut.  If you like 2in ribeyes, you can get it sliced that way.  My wife and I typically do that once a year.    All of Cordray's cattle are pasture fed (ie grass fed) until about 2-3 weeks prior to slaughter and they are fed grain to fatten them up.  Additionally, all the cattle have been born and raised on that farm.  You know where the cattle came from and they have always done that except when they opened many many years ago.  With that said, grass fed beef does taste different so I would recommend eating some prior ordering this huge amount.  It is also leaner so you don't cook it exactly the same way you would typical grocery store corn fed beef.    Another farm where you can get larger orders of meat is Legare Farms.    The primary thing is that you want to do it in bulk to lower your costs.  Buying it in 10lb increments is going to cost an arm and a leg and you likely aren't getting all the cuts of meat you want.    http://www.cordrays.com/cordray-farms-beef.html  edit:words"

I figured the path I went to start with is going to be the more expensive option, but we do get chicken, pork and beef.    I read that you need to use a bit more oil when cooking grass fed beef or it will dry out.

It's reasonably close to everything on your list, being just off Johnny Dodds Blvd.  The homes are leased through a rental company, so there isn't a typical leasing office on the property.  We rented through Charleston Rental Properties (I think).    Other places in that area that you may want to consider would be Paces Watch, Hibben Ferry, or Watermark.

Charleston,3dbqrb,RaunchyTacoBowl,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:03:34 2015 UTC,"The Park Circle area is great, especially if you're working on the Navy Base (about a 2 minute drive). A lot of cool bars and restaurants for a little neighborhood, pretty close to all the shopping centers in North Charleston (though not sure about good grocery stores around there), and pretty much the center of everywhere you'd want to go in Charleston. Being close to both I-526 and I-26 it's very convenient for getting around. There are a lot of young professionals living in that area - I know of 3 friends living there and they love it (one with a young daughter).  There's also Mixon Place which is a newer development right down the street that seems pretty cool, but I don't know anyone that lives there and it is a bit more sketchy over there (you'd want to be as close to Park Circle/""downtown"" North Charleston as possible).  Avondale (and really anywhere around there like Byrnes Downs and South Windermere) is also a great area, and has more nice retail establishments close by (and good bars/restaurants) than Park Circle. Park Circle definitely feels more industrial in the surrounding area even though there some cool places in the tiny ""downtown"" of North Charleston on Montague Ave, whereas Avondale/Byrnes Downs/South Windermere feel much more suburban and have more conveniences like grocery stores and retail shops. It does seem like both of these locations  are pretty high in demand, but if you can find something in either area, I think you'd enjoy it.  HTH and good luck!  EDIT: more words"

There is a building which had been in major construction for 4-6 months now and just recently they have given the residents a notice saying that due to the construction it is no longer livable. Living next door to this building has been a pain in the ass due to construction vehicles and workers being douchey and leaving cigarette butts everywhere. They also are adding a supporting beam to all balconies right now as well.  So yes there is some construction going on.   I can say that it is VERY quiet, everyone has a dog, and residents are mostly friendly. It's a very young atmosphere 20-30ish. I think it's a tad over priced for what it is but given I've lived everywhere around charleston/NCharleston I'd say it's my most enjoyable living experience so far.

Charleston,3dbqrb,zeeginganinja,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:40:50 2015 UTC,"I live in West Ashley and love it! I'm 3 miles from Avondale, 8 miles from downtown, and 15 miles from the beach. Drive times to those places can vary depending on the time of day. Just stay back from HWY 17 and you'll be in the safer areas.   My opinion on Avondale, it's a great area concerning safety and proximity to things but it's really only houses and they can sometimes be in pretty sorry condition.  But the 10 mile long Greenway connecting to John's island is right at your back door as well as kayak drop in spots.   Mt. Pleasant is a nicer community but, from what I've seen, it is more populated with families. But it's still a great place with lots of access to restaurants, bars, beaches, and downtown. Also a very fit community. People are always kayaking, paddle boarding, and jogging :)  If you'd like, feel free to PM me with a list of places you have found and I could do a drive by and give an unbiased report of the area :)"
Charleston,3dbqrb,unusualtomato,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:33:46 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much! I might just take you up on this. I am a little hesitant on renting a house, but that was all I found in Avondale as well. I also don't know how far away from the little town center of Avondale I would want to go to be close enough to enjoy it.   Thank you!"
Charleston,3dbqrb,Forgainst_it,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:05:38 2015 UTC,You're so welcome! Please just let me know :) I live at Hawthorne Westside and love it. It's only about an 8-10 minute drive to Avondale and have taken an uber home before for $7. There's several different apartment complexes around us (Woodbridge is in this area). Hope that helps to give you an idea on proximity!
Charleston,3dbqrb,zeeginganinja,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:47:28 2015 UTC,"Would you consider subletting? It might be smartest to sublet an apartment for a few months to get a feel for the area. Mt P is very different from, say, Avondale."
Charleston,3dbqrb,kramejam,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:28:25 2015 UTC,"I think it would be hard to sublet with two people. I also won't have much time to move stuff around after I start work.   How are they different, if you don't mind my asking?"
Charleston,3dbqrb,tellevee,-3,Wed Jul 15 01:29:58 2015 UTC,"Mount P is very much filled with little blonde moms in their lululemon driving SUVs to take their kids to soccer practice and stop at Whole Foods or FroYo on the way home. Avondale is more eclectic and a mix of a bit of everything, and West Ash is cheaper but can get sketchy quickly."
Charleston,3dbqrb,kramejam,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:38:54 2015 UTC,"Well I don't have kids, but I am blonde! Haha  I've been trying to look around Avondale but haven't found many available apartment complexes."

Maybe not the mainstream choice, but I like it."

Charleston,3d78bf,srbumblebeeman,-1,Tue Jul 14 18:03:18 2015 UTC,Careful. Check the reviews online for this one...
Charleston,3d78bf,imagineskyscrapers,2,Tue Jul 14 19:27:57 2015 UTC,Most of the online reviews are decent. At least 3.5/5 on most of the sites.

Charleston,3d78bf,imagineskyscrapers,3,Wed Jul 15 00:18:07 2015 UTC,"An honest opinion of Brecks is you get what you pay for.  The steaks are not overly tasty, they could use some help in the seasoning department.  But the steaks aren't too tough and they are Juicy.  If you use the steaks as a vessel to transport steak sauce to your taste buds it's great. They still have the steak for 2 deal... 2 salads, 4 sides and 60 ounces of steak for 30 dollars."
Charleston,3d78bf,dabubby007,2,Sun Jul 19 17:45:52 2015 UTC,"I did, actually, and most of the negative ones were about service or new staff (and few bad ones, at that). I've never been to this place but I'll say that it certainly won't be ""Hall's pretentious"", but Hall's is overpriced and overrated regardless."

Charleston,3d4ipi,stefeyboy,3,Mon Jul 13 13:36:40 2015 UTC,A good bit of places seem to be working on this already but I can't stress it enough. Bikes. Bikes Bikes bikes BIKES. More bikes equals less cars. Driver education needs to go hand and hand with infrastructure to increase bike traffic.
Charleston,3d4ipi,onizaru,5,Mon Jul 13 15:07:08 2015 UTC,That only helps downtown. It doesn't help with commuter traffic which is the larger problem.
Charleston,3d4ipi,imagineskyscrapers,9,Mon Jul 13 15:25:47 2015 UTC,"with a bit more proper infrastructure it'd improve a 5-10 mile radius around downtown too. It's not going to help those who live in summerville and work in mt.p, but it could help those in west ashley commuting to downtown."
Charleston,3d4ipi,bpwnz,3,Mon Jul 13 15:29:10 2015 UTC,Not necessarily. I live downtown and work on Daniel Island. My office has a locker room and showers and if there was a safe way for me to commute I'd do it a couple of times a week.
Charleston,3d4ipi,Sunburn79,2,Tue Jul 14 01:46:58 2015 UTC,Some sort of ferry from downtown to daniel island would be the only near feasible fix for that. Or my dream bicycle bridge under 526....
Charleston,3d4ipi,bpwnz,2,Tue Jul 14 18:46:17 2015 UTC,"I know. A ferry would be amazing.   You can also go up 17 to 41 to Clements Ferry which is a doable 30 miles, but again it's horribly unsafe and at that distance I'd probably only do it once or twice a week."
Charleston,3d4ipi,Sunburn79,2,Tue Jul 14 20:07:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah we rode 41 this weekend, so bad."
Charleston,3d4ipi,bpwnz,2,Tue Jul 14 20:10:09 2015 UTC,I saw that. 100 miles in that heat is crazy. Full on beast mode. Nice big loop on the map though haha.
Charleston,3d4ipi,Sunburn79,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:14:43 2015 UTC,I'll take that along with a bike bridge under the James Island connector.  A decent bike path from Folly @ Hwy 17 all the way to Folly Beach would be awesome. Any reduction in road traffic along that route would only be a good thing.
Charleston,3d4ipi,schicksal_,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:38:02 2015 UTC,"The planned changes to the Legare Bridge is one of the worst traffic ideas that Charleston has had in a long time. You know what does not help traffic at all? Removing an entire traffic lane so that a few hundred bikers have an easier time. Spending the amount of money it will take on a bridge who's lifetime is up (they plan to have it replaced in 4-6 years) is also incredibly irresponsible.  Sorry bikers, you guys are doing your part and deserve some safety and a better road system, but the number of bikers who will benefit from this in no way justifies the cost or worsening traffic that it will cause."
Charleston,3d4ipi,bythog,3,Mon Jul 13 16:23:58 2015 UTC,"The removal of the lane comes with changes to the roads it dumps into that should make it a pretty traffic neutral change. The chokepoint on the legare inbound has always been at the end of the bridge, not on it.  I can agree only a small group will benefit at first. hopefully though it leads to an expansion in cyclists who really do need at least one safe way to cross the ashley, that sidewalk is sketchy to ride across and the james island connector isn't much more fun."
Charleston,3d4ipi,bpwnz,6,Tue Jul 14 18:49:27 2015 UTC,"I'm not familiar with this particular project, but there is always a bit of a chicken and egg situation with bike commuting and infrastructure. Philly built out it's bike lanes and saw a huge rise in bike commuting."
Charleston,3d4ipi,bikePhysics,2,Mon Jul 13 21:20:43 2015 UTC,"All those people on bikes are no longer using roads. It so incentivizes others to use a bike instead of a car. Been shown time and again in other cities, and we're no different."
Charleston,3d60en,Rodhlann,5,Mon Jul 13 20:12:55 2015 UTC,"First, congrats on the job with Booz Allen. Second, North Charleston is a a nice area, particularly like the Park Circle Area and farther up near ashley phosphate area, North Charleston gets a bad rap and there are some very nice affordable areas in North Charleston you just have to kind of figure that out your self.  Third, There are some great eats in North Charleston particular off East Montague, check out Sesame Burger, BBQ Joint, Madra Rua, theres a newer Mexican place in there, Park Pizza is good for take out. Fourth, $900 a month might be a little tight depending on what area you want to live and commute from, but i don't think you will have any problem meeting that budget, hopefully someone else can pitch in on suggestions as the only apartment complex i have lived in is Mixson and i wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
Charleston,3d60en,communistwookie1,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:19:33 2015 UTC,That's actually really helpful as Mixson was one of the main complexes I was interested in. Seemed like a great location. Thanks for the food spots too.
Charleston,3d60en,communistwookie1,7,Mon Jul 13 21:30:28 2015 UTC,"Mixson might be ok in a few years, but the whole time i have been here its been constant construction, apartments are flooding, lots of flat tires out in the parking lot from combination of pot tholes in the parking lot that washes away everytime it rains and contruction workers leaving materials/tools everywhere. Dog shit everywhere, seriously so many people don't seem to understand how to pick up after their dog, Apartments are nice at first but longer you live there the more of the cheap construction materials and bad workmanship shows up. They must of seriously took the lowest bid. Most of all its rather expensive for living in a construction zone. To renew the lease they really pushed the rent prices up, I can't imagine paying what they wanted to renew the lease, definitely a much better deal to be a new resident rather than keeping the ones they already have."
Charleston,3d60en,Herrwichser,2,Mon Jul 13 21:37:08 2015 UTC,"The thing I don't get about Mixson is that for the price they want for an apartment, you can literally rent an entire house 2-3 blocks away. I know because I did."

Charleston,3d60en,Evrybdywangchung,2,Tue Jul 14 02:47:24 2015 UTC,"Hi neighbor!   +1 to Mixson being okay. We moved here in October and had an excellent deal, and the apartments fit right in to what we were looking for. We haven't been hit with the construction as bad as the other buildings but its had me worried about everything else. We've had issues with our dishwasher flooding, and our fucking sink fell through because they only used adhesive and no supporting brackets. Don't get me started on the parking lot, it is excellent astronaut training.  People seem to have problems with the management but all of my issues have been maintenance related so they shrug their skinny arms and pass the buck.  Maintenance is on point though, those guys fucking rock, especially considering how much literal shit they put up with.   We won't be renewing when our lease comes up, especially knowing how high its going to increase for a small as hell 1 be which were paying 1k for after the utilities and other fees."

My Sink has fallen through probably 2 or 3 times, and their fix for it looks terrible, its barely hanging in there now. Dishwasher sucks and doesn't do a very good job but haven't had any issues with it, Parking lot is a joke, i don't know what they are doing with it, they were doing a pretty good job at keeping it  ""repaired"" but i think they have just given up on it.   Maintenance guys are definitely on point, put in a work order and they have it fixed the next day and are very friendly/professional.  Front office folks never seem to really know whats going on or when something will be taken care of.   For what its worth my Rent went from $927 to i think it was $1077 i think? Plus all the rental fees and trash fee's and all that crap they like to throw on which is just way to much for what is being offered."
Charleston,3d60en,NevEP,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:40:09 2015 UTC,"Lived in Mixson from April 2013-May 2014, came here to say this. The mortgage payment on the 4bedroom/2bath house I bought after leaving Mixson is cheaper than rent for their 600sqft 1 bedroom/1bath apartment.  Bent a rim in the parking lot it was so bad, got them to replace it. Had a water leak in my ceiling (was on the top floor) and they fixed it and gave me WalMart gift cards for the inconvenience."
Charleston,3d60en,zeeginganinja,2,Wed Jul 15 01:09:19 2015 UTC,"I lived at Windjammer years ago and hated it, the management sucked and the units are ancient. They did construct a new building while I was leaving, and I have friends who live there and are happy. Beware that in most locations, you are a chain link fence away from the ghetto (I heard shootings a few times) and there were a few car breakins. Oh and if you do end up considering it, drive in the complex anytime during rush hour and try turning left. Easily will add 5-10 mins to your commute if some people are doing the same ahead of you."

Charleston,3d60en,nerrinc,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:34:30 2015 UTC,"I've been renting a 2 bedroom 2 bath there for 980 + utilities (you're forced into having a Comcast TV package, FYI) but it's not terrible. Compared to living downtown it's downright cheap. They just recently rewired, resided, repainted, and re-screened the porches. They also rebuilt the deck and resurfaced the pools (they only go to about 4-5ft deep), the main one has a nice grilling area and cornhole and all that. The ""gym"" is pretty small, and the two times I visited it seemed like half the machines were in some state of disrepair.  The interiors could use some work, and the repairs from the previous tenants damage are shoddy at best. Once while putting on my shoes I leaned on a wall, palm flat against the wall and a half-baked patch job failed and caved in a chunk of the wall... goodbye deposit. The staff there is also kinda clueless in my opinion. During the renovations I tried to find out when my building was due to be rewired so I could plan my week since I work from home and having no internet is not exactly an option. When asked, they didn't know when the work would be done, who would be doing it, who to contact for information, or who I might contact to figure out who to contact... suffice to say I don't hold them in high regard.  Unfortunately, every one of the complexes in West Ashely along Sam Rittenberg seem to be of similar quality. Colonial Village at Hampton Pointe was the midget amongst dwarves. I've lived in Mt. Pleasant, Downtown, and here recently in West Ashley in about 6 places now. My advice is find something that minimizes driving if you're going to be traveling during rush hour as it's only gotten worse over the years, and if possible try to rent from someone who actually owns the property or otherwise from a small management company. The most responsive landlords I've had were owners or an individual manager who didn't have a huge number of properties on their plate. My experiences renting from a corporate owned and operated property feels a lot like getting internet service from Comcast. It's not (that) terrible, but you're just gonna hate cutting them a check every month.  If you're really looking at West Ashley, you can find some hidden gems if you have time on your side, either a house or condo that is not priced to gouge but of good quality and a good owner. Same goes for downtown, but like buying a car the worst time to look is when you have to look. Oh, and if you did pick West Ashley, avoid 17 at all costs during rush hour."

Might not be too bad since your coming from ATL, but just a heads up.  * Weather can be extremely humid.  * Personally, I feel like it's been a while since Hurricanes have been an issue here, but I wasn't downtown when some of the big ones hit. * Speaking of Downtown Charleston and weather, it floods down here constantly. Just be prepared if you or your wife plans to be Downtown for work or whatever. Pros * Things are generally pretty close. If you want to go to the beach, or downtown, or find a nice restaurant, it's pretty convenient. * Amazing food and beer. There are numerous restaurants and breweries, and new ones seem to pop-up all the time, with so much variety. I love when I get opportunities to try new restaurants or new breweries. * Seems like there are always events going on. To name a few things, there are Riverdog baseball games, CofC basketball games, live bands/concerts, Movies on Folly beach, beer/wine festivals, and food festivals.

If you're looking for something more 'career-oriented,' the technology industry in the are as starting to boom. Since Boeing set up here, it's attracted a lot of smaller tech companies, a lot of which are some promising start-ups. I work in marketing and found a great gig with one of these startups, so there's room for a lot more than just tech folks. People have only just started noticing charleston, it's still early so people haven't moved here yet.

Is the Monument coming down next?  If not I fail to see the point in removing the flag.  Now, I could get behind the argument that a historically accurate battle flag be flown over the monument (the flag that was flown was actually the battle flag of the Army of Northern Virginia under Robert E Lee).  It would have been more appropriate to fly the Bonnie Blue (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonnie_Blue_Flag) which was flown by the cadets that fired on Fort Sumter or the Confederate Stars and Bars or some other flag the soldiers actually fought under in this state.  But I guess reason has no place in today's knee jerk public opinion cesspool that is up in Columbia."

Charleston,3co40b,Andy_Glass,2,Thu Jul 9 21:22:25 2015 UTC,Tax breaks that don't add up. Basically we give them free money because they're a large brand. The idea is that more smaller companies will sprout up to support them that will in-turn contribute taxes. Ironically most of the jobs created both 1st and 3rd party fall well under the liability for state taxes (that is they are liable only for a fraction of what people think). Thus we're hemorrhaging tons of cash for a name brand.
Charleston,3co40b,SwallowedBuckyBalls,2,Fri Jul 10 14:59:40 2015 UTC,"More workers mean more people migrating in. More people buying and spending, more people working, more tax revenue."
Charleston,3co40b,imagineskyscrapers,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:16:18 2015 UTC,I highly doubt that the 20-30k a year jobs created are spending nearly enough to offset the incentives we're providing.
Charleston,3co40b,SwallowedBuckyBalls,2,Fri Jul 10 16:18:36 2015 UTC,"I think you're a little off on the payrate there, pal. We're obviously not hemorrhaging money considering things are still getting done. Albeit not quickly, but hey, it's the South."
Charleston,3co40b,imagineskyscrapers,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:20:14 2015 UTC,"I'm actually not that far off. The state salary average is only $35k.  Additionally,   Manufacturing accounts for less than 5% of the establishments within the state. Yet they reap the vast majority of incentivizations. The manufacturers are generating 20% of the GDP for SC almost a quarter of the jobs depend on exports Most of which is un-taxed or extremely reduced. 80% of the manufacturers are small - medium sized companies with less than 500 employees, many of which aren't eligible for the same benefits brought to the big players. in 2008 Foreign controlled companies employed over 60,700 workers or approximately 1/5th of the total manufacturing. In conjunction with free trade agreements, and international zones within the state, you can damn well bet that they're working those loopholes too.    We rely too much on the ""big players"" and are giving excessive incentives that if applied to other demographics such as our small business / startups growth efforts in the state, would yield far greater tax revenues, gross spending, and migration of new residents.    Manufacturing isn't the best hedge bet, we're re-creating the textile industry fiasco all over. It's inevitable that for the sake of bottom line, manual tasks that can be automated, will be automated.  And when they are, not if, we've got a burden of debt that hasn't been repaid and an increase on reliance of our already beleaguered social services."
Charleston,3co40b,SwallowedBuckyBalls,2,Fri Jul 10 18:59:49 2015 UTC,"$39,500 is what I've seen.  But, you can't take average salary and apply it to the manufacturing companies. Plenty in the food and bev industry pull that number down.  http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes_sc.htm#00-0000  Hence my original question. I'd like to see some job titles and their salary.  I think what you're getting at is the same conversation we've had on this sub before: investing in education vs. waiting for high tech to swarm in. I believe we agree on that. I'm sure their offering packages to high-tech companies, but the high-tech companies don't want to come to a place without a large talent pool. We need to invest in education yes, but we need to solicit for some as well. Do they even build new universities anymore?"
Charleston,3co40b,imagineskyscrapers,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:47:12 2015 UTC,"I think as part of the packages it should be required they outline exactly the jobs they're creating based on positions / salaries. Plus many of them included in the verbiage was to create up to which of course means they could fall well short.   My tone isn't directed at you, it's more the frustration in the myriad of conversations i've had at the state, county, and even city levels within SC.   I'm proactively trying to bring and train talent here in the state, with employees in the $100K+ range, as well as manage a non-profit and continue to contribute to the various schools. All of my employees contribute back, yet the state feels our worth, our tax paying worth, isn't worth equal or similar treatment. That's what I hate. Because we're not a global conglomerate that can fund politicians moving up the geo-political ladder, we're of no use.   The worst part is they always talk about how they support Disabled Veterans and that's the states focus. I call bullshit, as a Disabled Veteran owned business, with multiple veterans, unless we're a big name they won't listen to anything we have to say.   It's just numbing when you have states to the north and south of us moving miles ahead in addressing these issues.    --- Maybe we'll move our HQ back out of state."

When you consider a lot of them move from Seattle / Long Beach it's not bad at all.  It all adds up... when we moved here we bought a house that was a short sale, so it might have resulted in one less foreclosure in the city. I cook Indian food and like beer, so when India Spice and Craft Conundrum opened up they have another customer. That x 10,000 people or more adds up."

Charleston,3co40b,NedRyerson_Insurance,-3,Thu Jul 9 18:26:34 2015 UTC,"But hey, the state government is creating jobs!  Of course, the majority of locals that get jobs get very low pay.  Most of the high-paying positions are transferred in from other locations.    And the state will totally make up (a very small fraction of) the lost business tax income by taxing the employees.

How much tax revenue did SC get from Boeing ten years ago? None?  How much income tax did they get from those engineers and managers when they worked in Washington or California? None there as well.  It all comes down to your priorities: is Boeing having less profits worth both fewer jobs in SC and less tax revenue for SC?"
Charleston,3co40b,SwallowedBuckyBalls,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:23:06 2015 UTC,Your argument would make sense if it wasn't costing us money up front. We're giving them taxes and low cost loans to lure them in to offset taxes they would pay for 5-20 years. Very few of them contribute taxes at all. They pull the ole GE tactics at the corporate level and the jobs created rarely pay either (State or Federal) due to income levels.   It's a sham.

Charleston,3co40b,SwallowedBuckyBalls,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:15:27 2015 UTC,"Also look at the ""$30 million deal closing fund"" what the hell is that?   The state had a private fund of $6 million for non-profits and accelerators that was funded through a tax credit for donators. They're actively pushing that out the door though because it's too much.   For ""insert big name here"" If their incentives are 10.4 million a year for the first 2000 jobs, that's $5200 a year in incentives outside of the loans and grants that we're providing. I'm hard pressed to believe that each of those jobs will recoup the $5200 in taxes within the state. Maybe i'm too skeptical.  ""The tax credits reimburse a company for its capital expenditures — for land, buildings, site development, pollution control equipment or infrastructure — for projects that create new full-time jobs that also provide health-care benefits for S.C. citizens, Skipper said.""  I have spent close to half a million in facilities, development, and infrastructure this year.

We help each other out - anything I've ever needed, they've been more than willing, and me the same toward them.  I absolutely love my neighbors.    Although I've only lived in SC, I've traveled all over our great country.  I have nothing but positive things to say, and experiences from living in Charleston, but even moreso in the area I live now (I've been in my current home in MP for ~2 years).

Charleston,3cg0gy,CookiesandCandy,3,Tue Jul 7 16:56:47 2015 UTC,Depends on your definition of affordable.   How soon? Is outdoors an option? Some of the parks around the area have fairly reasonable rental rates for the outdoor shelters. Some of the all-indoor buildings at the parks are a bit pricier depending on when the event is held so they might not be an option.
Charleston,3cg0gy,admrltact,2,Tue Jul 7 17:00:50 2015 UTC,"Affordable is subjective, I know. Really I'm just looking for a list of places because I'm literally blanking on anything. $500 or less for three hours?  Early September; I can do later but since everyone's coming from out of town (maybe, who knows if people will actually come) I was trying to make it as convenient for my guests as possible.  It'd have to be a really special outdoor space. I'd worry about the heat, and it's not my preference. But I won't say never."
Charleston,3cg0gy,admrltact,2,Tue Jul 7 17:05:55 2015 UTC,"Indoors, you might be able to get a meeting/conference space in many hotels around the area, especially if you set up a guest block there.   The hotel we had our wedding block  (in Charlotte though) gave us a meeting room to use for the rehearsal dinner free. Most hotels dont advertise the prices online because they tend to scale it by what the event is (just dont say the word wedding, or reception). Most hotels in the area have some sort of meeting space, whether it meets your capacity may be a different question. Check out the hotels in/around the North Charleston PAC / Collesium, Ive been to events at both the Holiday Inn Express and Charleston Plaza Hotel."

They were friends with the owner, so it may have been an exception to their rules.  And I have no idea how much it'd cost if they did allow it.  If you have some out-of-towners that would want to stay at a B&B, and you could get them to book there, they may be more likely to do it."

Not sure if it would fall in your budget including their catering, I think the one I did had soup and a salad and buy-your-own-alcohol so it didn't seem like it could have cost too much.

Charleston,3cg0gy,lillylover9,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:36:03 2015 UTC,That's a bit larger than I was guessing for a baby shower. It may end up being more than 500 for 30 or so people.

Charleston,3cfsla,danceswithsquirrelz,3,Tue Jul 7 16:06:23 2015 UTC,I live within a mile of park circle and commute to summerville for work.

Charleston,3cfsla,imagineskyscrapers,2,Tue Jul 7 20:00:11 2015 UTC,You must be back in one of the neighborhoods deep off of main roads. I live off of Patriot and it takes me 35-50 minutes to commute to Mount Pleasant (depending on the number of idiots driving).
Charleston,3cfsla,bruthaman,2,Tue Jul 7 20:54:53 2015 UTC,"I can confirm that driving down Dorchester while school is in session is a nightmare.  As a matter of fact, Ladson Rd., Palmetto Commerce, and Ashley Frustrate are equally as bad.  I have sat for an hour several times on Dorchester trying to get from Wescott to 526."

Charleston,3cfsla,bruthaman,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:38:39 2015 UTC,"I use it daily. There just isn't a way to connect with 526 or 26 where you don't sit in traffic for 30 minutes or more.  The only other option is to leave the house before 6:30, but then I'm at the office 2 hours before I need to be there.  The residential growth has been uncontested for years, and now we are realizing why it is important to invest in infrastructure. Maybe one day we will get commuter rail service, or more park and rides to assist.  A man can dream."
Charleston,3cfsla,sovietshooter83,2,Wed Jul 8 15:04:25 2015 UTC,"That's just so weird. When I used to take Patriot to PCP or Ladson, down 26 to 526 to Daniel Island, it took me 35-45 minutes. If traffic was bad because of idiots, maybe 50, rarely over an hour. Now I'm at a longer distance and it's the same times except I'm headed all the way down 26 to the Ravenel."
Charleston,3cfsla,bpwnz,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:37:52 2015 UTC,"I've been traveling it for 8 years, work in Mt. P, and it has become much worse over the past 2 years.  Sometimes traffic at Joseph R. Pye will back up to Wescott Blvd., which is 10 minutes before you've even left the neighborhood (7:00-7:30).  Then,  if you take a right on PCP, the light at Ashley Phosphate will back up almost to Glass Pro. That light alone will cost you 20 minutes, no exaggeration, and Waze doesn't pick up that time accurately.   Ladson is the path of least resistance, but takes you further out of the way.  You can also get hung up at the school after the tracks.    The only hope, is for the completion of the new exit being added between University and Ashley Phosphate.   Usual travel time is 45-50 during the school year. And over an hour if taking Dorchester or Ashley Phosphate."

Your best bet for nightlife will probably be on King St.  As far as food goes, if you're looking for something high end / classy check out Oak Steakhouse (expensive, but delicious). Stay away from Hyman's as there is much better seafood elsewhere for the price.  If you like comedy, Theatre 99 on Meeting street has improv nights Wednesday, and during the weekends.  Check out the Charleston Wiki for some more information on things to do. It's a great jumping off point.  Sometimes the best experiences downtown happen when you just wander and explore.

Charleston Power Yoga is okay, the Mt P location is kinda tiny and some of the instructors can be snooty. Its more expensive and there's always some random chick not following the class and just doing inversions the whole time. Also been to Jivamukti Center, which is less of a physical workout and more spiritual, if that floats your boat. Either way, most of the smaller studios offer cheap trial months or intro classes, so try them out and find one that works for you!"
Charleston,3cdhfc,zeeginganinja,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:59:08 2015 UTC,"It's not in Mt. Pleasant, but the best studio I've found for the price is Charleston Community Yoga in Avondale/West Ashley. They have a wide variety of classes and the instructors are great. Depending on where you live in Mt. Pleasant, it may not be a bad drive for you as it is close to downtown. Most places let you try your first class at a discounted rate or you can buy a single pass or a few trips to try a few classes and see how you like it. I wasn't a big fan of Jivamukti or Power Yoga."
Charleston,3cdhfc,ProudPatriot07,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:42:21 2015 UTC,"Jivamukti is a great, small studio. They frequently have High 5 classes, which are drop ins with a $5 donation. Great to just check the place out! They also have a location downtown and have social events and vegan potlucks (:"

Charleston,3cb6w9,imagineskyscrapers,0,Mon Jul 6 18:25:06 2015 UTC,I read this before I posted. It doesn't say how much or what type. It mentions cans and brushes. I guess I am gonna just have to wing it.
Charleston,3cb6w9,imagineskyscrapers,6,Mon Jul 6 18:30:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that was more informational for those that don't know anything about it. I think you'd be fine with some exterior paint. You can probably get a few of the smaller sample sizes from Lowe's pretty cheap. Buying more than that seems like a waste since someone can just paint over it 15 minutes after you leave."
Charleston,3cb6w9,Smitty500,-1,Mon Jul 6 18:58:08 2015 UTC,Yeah I am not wanting to spend too much on it. I am thinking maybe a big container of white and a couple sample sized containers of the other color to write with.
Charleston,3cb6w9,johnpatrck,3,Mon Jul 6 21:08:00 2015 UTC,So many people stop to paint the boat they leave their supplies there behind it. Rollers are the best way to go. All the paint you need is there just buy you some new rollers and maybe a smaller brush

Charleston,3c92aw,xxej,11,Mon Jul 6 01:09:21 2015 UTC,there's an inn at middleton plantation. very close to downtown (15-20 min) but i'm not sure about prices. definitely worth looking into though because it's on the plantation and you could take a tour of the grounds and the main house too
Charleston,3c92aw,midgle,6,Mon Jul 6 01:24:46 2015 UTC,"I second this. The rate when I stayed over this past winter was about $130 a night, and its more expensive during the warmer months. However, this place is amazing... The rooms are fantastic. Very modern. Each came with a fireplace, one wall was made entirely up of windows, and GIANT TUBS!! Free breakfast was aiight. You also get a pass into the park. I plan on going back soon."

Charleston,3c5mp5,MoOsEsc2,4,Sun Jul 5 01:05:09 2015 UTC,I got my degree in Physics from The Citadel and now I'm Electrical Subsystems Engineer working DoD contracts. Check out the Charleston Defense Contractors association. Tons of them offer short term internships and student opportunities. I know it's not exactly research but it's another option I would highly recommend.   If you're looking solely for research opportunities I could give you some names of Citadel professors you could contact. There's a space physicist there working with Xcor Aerospace on sending a telescope into the upper atmosphere on a commercial space flight. They also now offer minors in Aerospace Physics and have a new wind tunnel for research and teaching. That's probably the closest you could get to what you're looking for.
Charleston,3c5mp5,Citadel2012,2,Sun Jul 5 02:06:25 2015 UTC,Yea that would be awesome! Im really looking just for research. Im on a co-op right now so the iternship is covered.

Charleston,3c3xnn,lazzeri,4,Sat Jul 4 16:29:32 2015 UTC,It is actually illegal for someone who is not a property manager (doesn't have a PM license or a Real Estate license) to manage a third-party property in SC. You may actually have some legal recourse there. If they are not licensed and not an owner of the property they could be in some pretty serious trouble.

We have little kids too, and always hit the beach at like 8am and rarely have any problems.  Spend a couple hours, grab and early lunch, then head home for baths and naps around noon.  I'd suggest a schedule sort of like that.  Evening is pretty easy too.  If the weather is pretty, the city is really family friendly.  Take a walking tour around the peninsula, and especially Waterfront Park.  There are big swings, the kids can splash in the fountains (pack a change of clothes!), and you can often see dolphins.  There are tons of food choices everywhere, so just stop where something looks good.  Wander the historic district and find little secret gardens and treasures.  James Island County Park has a waterpark and fun trails and outdoor things, which the kids would probably love.  Unfortunately it looks like you may be in for some rain.  If that happens, your daughters would probably really enjoy the Children's Museum of the Lowcountry and/or the SC Aquarium.  They just added a tank where you can touch sharks!  Here is the Charleston City Paper event calendar for the 4th.  Worth a look to see what sounds appealing.  My little guys will sleep before the fireworks get really going, so I can't offer much help there.  And for an adult night out, you should really treat yourself to an excellent dinner.  The DISH Top 50 is a great list to choose from, though everyone has their own favorites.  When my husband and I go on a date our favorite activity is to just wander the city.  We window shop down King Street, hold hands along the Battery, pop into some fun place for a drink or dessert or music, just see what we can find.  Charleston is super walkable and really good for that sort of thing.  Enjoy your stay!"
Charleston,3bn0z5,Sketchbooks,2,Tue Jun 30 16:03:35 2015 UTC,"Ding damn. Good answer! That list of restaurants is intensely comprehensive.   It is probably worth noting that many restaurants are going to be completely booked. Make reservations, or just be prepared to have to wait for a while.   Hope you have a great time!"
Charleston,3bn0z5,patriche,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:51:12 2015 UTC,"Thanks for this awesome reply!  One clarification regarding the traffic issues, going early, etc... are you speaking more specifically for the 4th or would that true for any day this coming week?"
Charleston,3bn0z5,Sketchbooks,2,Tue Jun 30 17:04:32 2015 UTC,"It will definitely be worse on the holiday weekend- all the beaches are.  If you go Thursday you'll have less trouble even if you arrive later, and probably also Sunday morning when people are recovering at home or going to church. But the ""go early or evening"" routine is our standby anytime we head to the water."
Charleston,3bn0z5,joe4mayor,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:34:31 2015 UTC,"I suggest a visit to the Angel Oak. It's free and just a neat thing to see. Also, every Wednesday night there is a barn jam at Awendaw Green. It's an outdoor music venue where you BYOB but it's totally kid friendly. It's a bit of a drive if you're staying on James Island but it's really fun. It costs 5 bucks to get in and they have a variety of musicians play. Another really fun thing to do with your kids is go to Sky Zone. Trampolines all day long and it's pretty diverse with age groups so you and your kiddos can have fun."

Charleston,3bkhuu,shitterplug,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:16:51 2015 UTC,"I believe if you park for less than 15 minutes @ St. Phillip Garage there is no charge.  I am not 100% sure, but I was not charged when I parked for about 10 minutes earlier this year.  15 minutes is probably not enough time to stand in line, order, and get back to your car.   Chipotle does have online ordering where you can set a pickup time and go directly to the register when you arrive at the restaurant.  You could probably get in and out and back out of the parking garage in less than 15 minutes with this method.  However, if it takes over 15 minutes, parking is only 1$ for up to 30 minutes so it's not too bad anyways and you don't have to worry about parallel parking!"

Charleston,3becnr,palmettomaids,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:13:02 2015 UTC,"awesome, appreciate it.  I hit a high spot in the road an I think the tow hook or undercarriage hit it and I jarred something loose or broke something so I've been chasing down the issue which it seems like its misfiring or stumbling. Its just not making any power, don't have any codes, replaced the plugs, plug wires, had the timing checked, replaced the AFM, TPS, waste gate, checked the clamps and had the vacuum/intercooler system checked for leaks and haven't found a problem yet. I have a feeling it might be a boost/vacuum leak that was missed but trying to rule out any misc issues it might be."
Charleston,3becnr,palmettomaids,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:49:32 2015 UTC,"Does it only misfire when you start to build boost or throughout the whole rev range? IF it is only misfireing when you are building boost i would check for boost leaks, you very well could have tore an intercooler coupler. I would suggest changing the coupler on the hot side pipeing going from the piping to the intercooler, before you do anything else. Even just a small tear in one can get much larger under boost and then shrink back when not in boost.   Shoot me a pm with your contact info and tomorrow i will take a look for those parts and i might have a few coulpers laying around as well."
Charleston,3becnr,schicksal_,1 point,Mon Jun 29 03:13:34 2015 UTC,"I'm not really sure that it's a misfire or not, its really hard to describe but it has a distinct different tone in the exhaust and almost sounds ""bubbly"" like a Subaru to a point.

Stops downtown for Ice Cream, rides up and down King Street a few times, then takes 17 to Main Rd, and on into Kiawah...    Here is hoping that maybe they can squeeze all 4 people into that big-ass 747, and make one direct trip down 26, into downtown.  I'm sure Biden will want to stop and take all the pictures and stop at 2-3 Marble Slabs, but hopefully Obama plays the dad role and tells him to keep quiet and relax until they get downtown.    They can do this and keep the obstacles for the rest of us to a minimum...  But I'm not sure they will."

Charleston,3b2wrs,imagineskyscrapers,2,Thu Jun 25 15:22:42 2015 UTC,How? Seriously how is that ok? I know tax dollars go to the government to help foot the bill for others but how is it ok for me to help pay someone else's bill for water? Thanks for the response
Charleston,3b2wrs,imagineskyscrapers,3,Thu Jun 25 15:31:58 2015 UTC,"It's just the nature of some of the systems in the complex. I think it started historically with houses that were rented out but had one system for power/heat/water and no way to monitor the individual use. It's pretty common in a lot of complexes. I remember being in one complex and when rates were elevated, they started sending out letters about conservation to get the numbers down."
Charleston,3b2wrs,inthrees,2,Thu Jun 25 15:58:29 2015 UTC,"I fully agree with your sentiment on this, in a visceral emotional sense, but logically this latest bill you've gotten is just a rent increase. (and a variable one, at that.)  See, you also paid a share of the old aggregate water bill each month, just like you will going forward, except it was rolled into the price of your rent.  At some point the owner/management of the complex said ""I have n units totaling z square footage, the average water bill for the complex is x dollars, add 15% wiggle room and a share of that bill based on sq footage needs to be reflected in each unit's monthly rent amount.""  So two months ago your rent payment had that automatically included. It was out of sight, out of mind, but it was definitely in there.  Now you have this new bill to pay. (And I'm assuming, no reduction in rent.) Add the bill you just got to the monthly rent price and decide if that apartment is worth that total per month. If not, move. And be sure to let them know why you're moving. (Without being a dick about it, unless you are just really sore over it. Just... ""I very much dislike the new water billing arrangement. It's a variable rent increase, and I can live elsewhere cheaper."" or something similar.)"
Charleston,3b2wrs,inthrees,2,Fri Jun 26 01:34:28 2015 UTC,Oh I'll be moving in October when the lease is up. The building is as old as me and has zero insulation. I dealt with it cause I'm lazy and didn't feel like moving. I'm now paying 750 a month for a one bedroom that causes me to have a 300 a month light bill during the summer. This was pretty much the straw that broke the camel's back. Lol.
Charleston,3b2wrs,spacemanspiff30,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:48:57 2015 UTC,"So more like $1100, depending on what your water bill is now, including the electric bill and water bill.  Yeah screw that. For that kind of monthly you can be in a much larger apartment with better insulation, newer construction, etc."
Charleston,3b2wrs,spacemanspiff30,1 point,Fri Jun 26 08:19:31 2015 UTC,Were utilities included in the rental agreement and changed after the fact but before the lease ran out?
Charleston,3b2wrs,orangeandwhite2003,2,Fri Jun 26 12:41:12 2015 UTC,"No, I resigned the lease and they told me I'd be paying the water bill as of July. I was ok with it because in walterboro my water was only 30 every 2 months. I'm not ok with having zero control over my water bill, just being at the mercy of the apartment's community."
Charleston,3b2wrs,spacemanspiff30,1 point,Fri Jun 26 13:04:51 2015 UTC,"Damn, might have had something there otherwise. If you agreed to it though, you're kind of stuck with it. I don't think it's fair, but it is what it is. It sucks, but there's not always a legal remedy, or one worth pursuing.   As I tell my clients all the time, principle is expensive. That being said, if you want to PM me we can discuss a little further and maybe I can take a look at the lease for you and see if there still might be something there."

Lap swimming is from 7:30 am - 11:00 am & 4:30 pm - 7:30 pm. I think they close earlier on Fridays. $2 to swim if you tell them you live downtown. It is easier to get your own lane if you go in the morning.   There is also a indoor pool in West Ashley called W.L. Stephens. Its 50m down and back. It is $2 to get in I think. I dislike this pool because there are less lanes and I don't like the the shorter distance.   source: i life guarded for the city for 3 years and I swim laps at least every other day at MLK.

Regardless of how people feel about him and his confederate flag wearing mask, the man is brilliant and a great writer.  I can remember many of his editorial things on 96 Wave - I'd be totally against whatever it was he was talking about, and by the end of his 3-4 minute diatribe, be on his side.  He's very smart and incredibly articulate.  This is a pretty big deal - good on him for growing up and admitting his mistakes."

The fact that he kept that job for as long as he did, and was able to fight the liberal mindset that runs that operation says a LOT about his intelligence.

Charleston,3ayeyp,tristamgreen,3,Wed Jun 24 17:24:12 2015 UTC,"i don't know if he was  necessarily fighting them, i always thought that the city paper was great for having the opposite viewpoints right next to each other and neither were editorialized too heavily."
Charleston,3ayeyp,wisertime07,3,Wed Jun 24 17:27:01 2015 UTC,"Well, I remember when Tara Servatius was writing for them - and Chris Haire would post comments to her article disputing what she was writing about.  That seemed in especially poor taste.    Maybe it used to be better, but here lately, it seems like the CP is about as open-minded as The Daily Show.  They seem to have a ""This is my (Chris Haire) viewpoint and if you don't like it, don't let the door hit ya on the way out"" attitude.  But that may just be more a reflection of their commenters (especially in the last year), and not the staff..  I dunno."

I'm open to most viewpoints, but I identify more with the right than the left.    I do still pay attention to The City Paper occasionally, but more for social activities (mainly the music scene).  Every now and then though, I'll find an article which inspires me to write a comment - and always, I am downvoted into oblivion.  And downvote me all you want - that's fine, but at least reply and let me know your viewpoint and why you disagree.  Who knows, maybe you'll persuade me to change my position.    But those people don't do that - the majority of the commenters on there are beyond delusional, and instead of debate, just would rather try and bury any comment which they're told is against what they're supposed to support.  That's incredibly frustrating."

MY fear is that we don't do anything at all, throw our hands in the air, and say ""Well, what can you do?""  I'd rather much more sweeping progress with regards to systemic racism, cracking down on hate groups, and the like.  But since I'm never going to get that, I'll take the progress I can get.  In this case, the removal of the flag."

I claimed removal of the flag was a good thing, but it addresses an issue of this particular mass shooting. If we're purely defining our problem as 'every few months wackos go on killing sprees' then what does taking down the flag do? Different issues, different fix required. Wish I could say I had real solutions to offer for either of those problems, but I don't."

Charleston,3aydhg,imagineskyscrapers,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:24:37 2015 UTC,They might want to get other municipalities in on that too because I doubt that all 9 will have funerals and be buried within the City of Charleston.  So far as the incoming trolls go I wish I had half a clue. There's no winning... normally you ignore a troll to get it to go away but that still leaves them there making the friends and family of the departed miserable. Maybe the best way is for them to get zero media coverage since that's the kind of attention they seem to want the most.
Charleston,3aydhg,schicksal_,4,Wed Jun 24 14:59:55 2015 UTC,"I believe 8 are in Charleston and the other in North Charleston, so, yes, definitely agree that North Charleston needs to jump on that quick, if they don't have something in place already.

However, I think you'd be better off taking a nice long walk... maybe even hang out on a towel/blanket for an hour or more, but in the end, getting rid of the sand and sticky and sleeping (or more) in a clean comfy bed might be a better bet.

Charleston,3azl64,OneSixteenthRobot,10,Wed Jun 24 19:46:56 2015 UTC,TL;DR College of Charleston has jumped on the bandwagon concerning the confederate flag on the capital grounds.
Charleston,3azl64,SakaguchiQuackers,3,Wed Jun 24 22:45:35 2015 UTC,"That and they didn't really say anything. It literally just says ""since 9 black individuals were shot and since other people have suggested it""  Really comforting, BOT"

McConnell later said to this reporter that the two-thirds vote was meant to insulate the flag for some time from further debate. And so it did for 15 years, until a Confederate-flag loving gunman cut down nine of God’s children at church."
Charleston,3azl64,robywar,1 point,Thu Jun 25 02:13:56 2015 UTC,"I've mixed feelings about the flag, but I'm more concerned by the mentality behind the flag's removal. I honestly don't have much of an opinion on the flag itself. I've lived in South Carolina my whole life. Some people say it's a racist flag, some people say it's about state rights, etc.   It's just a tad bit alarming how quick we are to remove the flag due to the shooting. Before the shooting, you hardly heard about the confederate flag. You'd just see it on some truck and think they must be pretty southern. Now as a result of the shooting, people are calling a witch hunt on the flag, and I'm not sure how to feel about such a rash reaction. If history has told us anything, it's that rash decisions like this can be dangerous."

Also, you talked about starting a family with one income but are looking for a house starting at $300,000? If you don't mind me asking, what are your jobs? My husband and I have pretty good jobs, make over $80,000 per year, and are very comfortable in out 4 bedroom house we just bought for $160,000.

Charleston,3b0lfh,Limiate,6,Thu Jun 25 18:44:27 2015 UTC,"I tried to be as helpful as I could but go back through your questions and read them as if someone was asking them about Santa Monica... they're really broad and the Charleston metro area is pretty sprawling and close to 700k people. Maybe if you narrow this down a bit we can be more helpful?  What I'd recommend is just don't get into a long term lease so after you have a feel for the area, you can move to where you think you enjoy Charleston... the good news is, it's pretty awesome all over.   My husband and I are both in our mid-twenties and are planning on starting a family soon. We're both from California and do not know anyone in the area. Is it easy to make new friends around our age? What is the best way to make new friends?   I moved here 13 years ago and got a whole new group of friends that are a mix of locals and imports like me. I'd say just do whatcha do? Go out for beers, join a sport, go to festivals. There's nothing in particular other than just being friendly. This sub has some pretty cool/friendly people too - so you might want to say ""Anyone want to do X?"" and you might end up with some new friends!   Do a lot of people go to church every Sunday? Is there a good community surrounding church?   Yes and then they all go out to brunch afterwards. Did you know that one of Charleston's nicknames is the Holy City?   Is it a good city for young families? Are there a lot of other young families (around our age that also have children) living here?   Absolutely. The Charleston County Parks have some pretty amazing stuff for kids to do too - check out the water parks to beat the heat!   Are there any cities/areas/neighborhoods that we should be wary of or steer clear of?   Yes, like all cities even the Charleston metro area has some sketch. Different people have different opinions and the sub-cities that make up the Charleston metro area have their different areas; it'd be helpful if you let us know what you're wary of already... shouting college kids? Murders? Applebeas?   What are some of the better neighborhoods to live in?   Someone interested in being downtown is going to have a different answer than someone who wants to be near the beach... who will have a different answer for someone who wants a short commute to their job... this is a really broad question. Tell us what you're looking for in a neighborhood... Charleston has been around for 400+ years... that's a long time in America for neighborhoods to evolve ;)   What is the rent like in these areas?   Same rule as Santa Monica - the closer to the water, the more the rent goes up.   We don't have any kids yet, so we are hoping to rent a studio/one bedroom for a few months until we buy a home. Most of the apartments I've seen in the Charleston/Mt. Pleasant area go for anywhere between $650-1,800/month for a studio or a one bedroom, but I found some apartments for rent in these cities for as low as $500ish/month (for a studio). Is that pretty typical, or should that low of a price per month raise red flags?   I just helped a co-worker relocate from Boston. He found a decent place  for a mid-20s bachelor downtown for $750/month - it's a shared house. While I was helping him look, it seemed like many things posted at the $500/month were too good to be true and had intentionally incorrect addresses.   From what others have told me, Charleston itself is the nicest area to live in. Is it a pretty quiet downtown area, or does it get pretty loud and rowdy at night?   Downtown isn't just one area. Certain streets are going to have drunk college kids roaming around on them at night. Others will have drunk tourists. Some get filled up with water when the tide is high. Others will be nice and quiet. I'd say look into the Hampton Park area for downtown accessible but family friendly area.   Would this be a good place to live with small children?   I take my nephews there? Not sure what that qualifies for.   What are some areas/neighborhoods outside of the Charleston that are also accessible to downtown and safe? We're looking for somewhere you would feel safe walking alone at night.   Just look at crime maps and such (https://spotcrime.com/sc/charleston) and maybe ask on here once you've done some narrowing down of what you're looking for.   As I mention above, we are hoping to buy shortly after getting a feel for the area. We are hoping to buy a 3-4 bedroom home in the 300/350K range. What sort of housing can you get for that price range? What are the public schools like in these areas?   300-350 will get you nothing near the water, something outdated and maybe 2.5 bedrooms close to the water and pretty nice if you're a ways away from the water. Your square footage will increase dramatically if you continue away from the water. If you hit mountains you have gone too far.  Do most homes have pools in the backyards? Are there public pools?  I've mostly seen community pools in my existence here and I'd attribute some of that to being the loamy soil and distance above sea level as part of the issue. Many neighborhoods have community pools.  Do alligators really get into your home, yard, and pools?  I had a friend lose a cat to a gator that was in the drainage pond behind the house she was renting. You see gators on golf courses and hear about them on the news. Home/Yard/Pools? No.   How are the pre-schools? How long are the waitlists typically?   Plenty of choices. Montessori schools are available - if you're not familiar, google away. 6 months from what friends experienced.   How are the private schools generally? Around how much does it costs to send a child to private school per year here?   Can't help here but I imagine some google-fu would help. The high school kids I've interacted with seem like your typical hormone charged teenagers worrying about teenager stuff. None of them seem like bumbling idiots.   My husband does SEO, marketing, content writing, and web development and has a bachelor's degree in English. Is there a good market for that?   Check out Blue Acorn.   Is it generally a pretty walkable/bikeable city?   Charleston? Walkable, yes. Bikeable... it can be dangerous but the city is trying. Most of the surrounding area is the same way. Getting to other regions via bike is challenging as everything in the area is separated by water... which means bridges. The only major bridge with a dedicated pedestrian/bicycle lane is the Ravenel Bridge from Charleston to Mt. Pleasant.   This may be a silly question, but coming from California surfing is a pretty common sport, and since Charleston is right on the water, is it a common sport there as well?   Yes. Folly Beach has the washout. Isle of Palms has decent breaks at 5th and 23rd. Chest/shoulder high. Nothing amazing but it'll push a longboard or 5'7+. Every now and then you get something a fish tail can tear up.   What is the weather like year-around?   June to September. Heat, humidity, meltyness. When I first moved here, it sucked. Your body adapts. The humidity becomes one with your soul.   It doesn't look like it snow frequently, but does it snow occasionally? When it doesn't snow how cold does it get?   30F is usually the bottom point of the temp in winter. It flurries annually-ish. Last time it snowed and you could make a snowman was 2010?    I've heard the summers are pretty hot and humid between June-August. What is that like?   You know when you get out of your car and walk into work? It'll feel like you took a hot shower in that time. It's hot and doesn't cool off much at night. You'll get used to it and laugh at other states that claim to have humidity.   Are there really fireflies during the summer?   Yes but not in the city... well firefly vodka from Wadmalaw Island... but that's different.   Is the ocean warm during the summer?   Yes. Bathwater. Get past the shelf for cooler water but watch the rip tides.   What sorts of things do people do in the summer to beat the heat?   Sit in the AC ;) Pools/beaches. Eat ice cream. Drink cold beer. Avoid push up contests. Wear sandals - even to fancy places because Charleston is awesome.   Are there any swimming holes/lakes/rivers that are a popular place to swim?   Isle of Palms, Sullivan's Island, Folly Beach. Trophy Lake. Ashley, Wando, Cooper river. Dozens of inlets/creeks and on and on and on.   What about the other seasons?   For me, the sweet spot is March - Early June and Late September to Halloween. That's the good stuff. After that when I first moved here I wore a long sleeve t-shirt and wondered why everyone was cold. After my body adapted, I start getting my scarf out when it goes under 65F.   What do people do for fun, or places that people go to nearby?   EAT. Omg the food. Go Karts. Riverdogs (baseball), Stingrays (hockey), Battery (soccer), New Year's Day Polar Bear Swim, cheer for people running in the Cooper River Bridge Run, go Bill Murray hunting, check out the latest bar, stalk your favorite food truck, attend Spoleto (you missed 2015), go to Myrtle Beach and do tourist trap crap, go to Savannah and get confused that you're still in Charleston, play golf, play soccer, play disk golf, go crabbing, go mudding, play paintball, hunt deer, hunt gators, go upcountry and go explore the Stumphouse Tunnel, go to the Windjammer and listen to Darius Rucker, go to the Folly Pier and shag (dance!), watch the Citadel cadets walk around in packs, eat the Xiao Bao Biscuit okonomiyaki over and over again, get ice cream at Marble Slab with all the horrible shit your inner 12 year old wants, hold hands on the bridge while years of racism melts away, read about Charleston's amazing history, go see the Angel Oak, go to Awendaw Green and listen to music, go see Elise perform, go to a show at the Music Farm, go volunteer at MUSC Children's hospital, walk around the Tanger Outlets and shop, go to the haunted hay rides at Boone Hall Plantation, go to Charles Towne Landing, go to Magnolia Plantation, go to Mepkin Abbey and walk the grounds, take a carriage tour downtown..."
Charleston,3b0lfh,Limiate,2,Thu Jun 25 01:21:03 2015 UTC,"What are some good things to do in the area (or nearby) for young families?   If I didn't do enough above... Skyzone. Monkey Joes. Charleston County Parks (waterparks are big in the summer). Movies in Marrion Square. Ice Skating at the Ice Palace. The Beach!   Are there nice parks to go to?   Absolutely. James Island County Park is amazing! The dog park is fun, so is the climbing wall. All the Charleston County Parks are great.   How do people typically dress/what's the style like? For example, people that live in Portland, Oregon are known for dressing in muted tones, lots of layers, ""hipster"", etc.   Anything will do but I personally see Rainbow sandals as my signature item of Charleston. The Charleston colors from rainbow row (pastels) are popular in dress and you'll see ""low country"" style items such as fish belts (literally belts with fish on them), monogrammed dress shirts and a few things of southern style come out in the dressier places.   We don't have a dog yet, but are hoping to get one soon. Do a lot of people have dogs? Are there good dog parks/places to take your dogs?  Yes. Charleston is dog friendly. Dogs on boats! Drive thrus have dog treats.  What kind of music do people listen to?  All types. The Charleston Coliseum had Willie Nelson and then the Performing Arts Center had Beck. The Southern Ground Music Festival is on Daniel Island Yearly. I saw The Crystal Method do a show at the Plex before it got torn down. Bare Naked Ladies, Cowboy Mouth, Pink, Price... we're on the venue-ish list.   What do you like? What don't you like?   Like  I love this city. It's big enough to have big city stuff without big city problems. The people are amazing. I feel like this is a good place to raise a family and I can have a long term career here. I've lived on both coasts, the midwest and the Northeast and I like Charleston the most.  Don't Like  Lack of public transportation. Uber has helped but the bus system is a joke. Congestion is starting and it's only going to get worse as the urban sprawl and ribboning continues. The banjo starts to play when you talk to certain people - especially when you get out of the city.   Any additional information on the culture, the people, the area, etc. is also appreciated.

Is there a good community surrounding church?  Is it a good city for young families? Are there a lot of other young families (around our age that also have children) living here?  Yes to all four of these  Are there any cities/areas/neighborhoods that we should be wary of or steer clear of? Most of North Charleston  What are some of the better neighborhoods to live in? There are a lot of new home areas being built, especially out in the Dorchester/Berkeley County area. I'd take a look at Cane Bay, Carnes Crossroads, The Ponds, and then Nexton in that order. I prefer more inland areas over Charleston county for various reasons, but Dorchester 2 is arguably the best overall school district in the Lowcountry, and home prices are usually half of what they are in Charleston County. Plus, insurance costs are much cheaper.  What is the rent like in these areas? Depends on what you area really looking for. I'll say this though, if it's under $700, cross it off your list immediately. The further you get away from Mount Pleasant and the peninsula, the lower your rent will get and the more space you'll have, generally speaking. Between rent, utilities/maintenance, etc., I'd say keep it around $1,000 for a one bedroom apartment. Anything over $1,200-$1,300 and you are getting bent over.

We're looking for somewhere you would feel safe walking alone at night.   There's no way I'd raise a child in downtown, but that's just me. Numerous reasons why not, just imagine typical urban problems on a smaller scale. Some parts of North Charleston, Summerville, and Berkeley County are great. I've already mentioned them. As for specific areas: Cane Bay Plantation (elementary, middle, and high school at the front of the community, grocery store and other stores as well, about to have a huge YMCA within the next year as well), Old Trolley Road is pretty nice albeit the newest homes are going to be at least 12-15 years old, Ladson Road is improving, The upper end of Dorchester Road is good, particularly near the Ponds. Nexton is new and its infancy but will be a great place to grow and raise a child (opening a new elementary school there this fall), lots of solid places on old orangeburg road as well, and the foster creek road corridor is really nice as well.  As I mention above, we are hoping to buy shortly after getting a feel for the area. We are hoping to buy a 3-4 bedroom home in the 300/350K range. What sort of housing can you get for that price range? What are the public schools like in these areas?  *Depends on where you buy, size, and age of the house, and neighborhood amenities. I'd start with the communities I listed above because they are well within your price range and offer good-great schools. The best elementary and middle schools in the area are the Rollings School of the Arts in Summerville. The best high school in the area - one of the top 10-20 in the nation - is Academic Magnet which is a magnet/charter school. Pretty much the only place you'll have to worry about a bad public school is in north charleston, downtown, and out in the boondocks of John's Island/West Ashley. *  Do most homes have pools in the backyards? Are there public pools? Some older neighborhoods do have a several homes with pools, but a lot of the newer neighborhoods I mentioned have them as amenities.  Nor that I am thinking about it, I forgot to mention Wescott Plantation. Really nice place.  Do alligators really get into your home, yard, and pools? *Lol no. You may hear one story a year about that and it's usually someone that lives in or near a swamp. *  How are the private schools generally? Around how much does it costs to send a child to private school per year here? Depends. Most of them aren't going to offer you anything better than what the better public schools offer. Now if you are living in a bad school district, then yes they are worth the investment, but I already mentioned the three best schools in the area and they aren't private. I'm sure some Porter-Gaud or Bishop England grad will try to persuade you otherwise, but its all hype. The faith-based schools, they are almost identical in quality to the average public school with the obvious differences.  My husband does SEO, marketing, content writing, and web development and has a bachelor's degree in English. Is there a good market for that? *Somewhat. Tech is just now really becoming a sizable industry in the charleston area, so he has a chance to get in before it becomes a crowded field. *  Is it generally a pretty walkable/bikeable city? Downtown Charleston? Generally speaking? Yes. However you can walk a quarter of a mile and go from a really nice neighborhood to a really bad one really quick. So yes the peninsula (downtown) is walkable, but it's a do so at your own caution kind of thing. The out lying areas are great for walking for recreation and such, but you can't really commute to work via walk unless you work in the area.  This may be a silly question, but coming from California surfing is a pretty common sport, and since Charleston is right on the water, is it a common sport there as well? *Not really. There are some people who do it and half seem to be transplants from elsewhere. We have more of a boating/fishing culture here. *  What is the weather like year-around? It doesn't look like it snow frequently, but does it snow occasionally? When it doesn't snow how cold does it get? *Not too dissimilar from California, but our hot is hotter than your hot and our cold is colder than your cold. It typically snows once every 4-5 years in the Charleston area. The Midlands and upstate get it pretty much every year.  Typically it only gets down into the 20s, but there are always a couple days a year it'll creep down into the teens. *   I've heard the summers are pretty hot and humid between June-August. What is that like? Are there really fireflies during the summer? Is the ocean warm during the summer? What sorts of things do people do in the summer to beat the heat? Are there any swimming holes/lakes/rivers that are a popular place to swim?  It's hot as hell, that's how it is! lol. No seriously, it's so hot and humid, the air sweats. Yes there are lots of fireflies. And yes the ocean water gets pretty warm. As for beating the heat, get in the water, any water. Lots of people to go to Folly Beach or IoP for the ocean, Some do the Ashley River or head inland for the Edisto River at Givhans Ferry or up to Lake Marion. We do have 3 small waterparks in the area which are nice. You can get a yearly membership for under $100 a person and that gives you access to all 3 waterparks and the parks that they are a part of.  What are some good things to do in the area (or nearby) for young families? Plenty of parks, the aquarium, plenty of restaurants of all cuisines, and several movie theaters and such. Lot of YMCAs in the area that have youth sports leagues. We do have three minor league teams in baseball (RiverDogs), hockey (Stingrays), and soccer (The Battery). If you visit and Charleston and have the time, I recommend catching a ballgame at The Joe (home of the Riverdogs), especially if you can catch a game that starts at 3:30-4. You'll thank me later. We have the North Charleston Coliseum and Performing Arts Center which get several concerts/events/shows a month. When the Gilliard reopens downtown it usually hosts a steady amount of events. Summerville has the Flowertown Festival every year the same weekend the Cooper River Bridge Run is happening. We have Spoleto every year too. Daniel Island hosts the Family Circle Cup tennis tournament every year, and they have a few concerts over there each year. Lots of smaller towns inland have their own little streets festivals (Such as the Grits Festival in St. George). Plenty of stuff to do in Charleston.  Plenty of people have dogs and yes there are plenty of places to take them - the RiverDogs even host a ""Dog Day"" at the ballpark, which is cool.   *As for music and clothing, that varies. Ladies dress in anything from sundresses to t-shirt and jeans. Most guys here are comfortable in a t-shirt/Polo and jeans/shorts. Not a lot of hipsters in Charleston. A lot of the older generation that live in Downtown will wear their Sunday best most days of the week so don't be shocked if you see a few ladies in downtown on a Tuesday afternoon looking like they are heading for Sunday morning service. Speaking of which, Charleston is pretty diversified religiously. Obviously Christian denominations are the hefty majority here, but we cover most of those denominations too - Baptist, Methodist, A.M.E, Lutherans, Presbyterians, Episcopalians, Catholics, and so forth. Several different subsects of the Jewish faith present as well. Not sure about Buddhists or Hindu faiths, but I'm sure they have their own little clique as well. *  The food here is absolutely amazing and probably more diverse than you expect. We have the best barbecue on this planet down here - make sure you get mustard based sauce and not that crappy north carolina vinegar stuff or that ketchup based silliness. We have a lot of good seafood too (Try a Lowcountry Boil/Buford Stew). There are a ton of hole in the walls that have great barbecue (especially inland up in the upper portions of dorchester county and out in the holly hill area, it's worth the trip), great seafood and outstanding southern food. Charleston is a great place to live and as long as you pick the right place, you'll absolutely love it!"
Charleston,3b0lfh,Bromethei,0,Tue Jun 30 04:32:49 2015 UTC,"We don't have a dog yet, but are hoping to get one soon. Do a lot of people have dogs? Are there good dog parks/places to take your dogs?   Charleston's fortunate in having quite a few public dog parks and a really nice dog culture for the most part.   My favorite parks for my dog are James Island County Park, which has a dog park area complete with a lake for the pooches to swim, and Wanamaker Park, which has miles of nice cool wooded trails as well as an off-leash area.  There are also dog-centric events organized in the public parks, like Yappy Hour at James Island and Dog Day Afternoon at the Wanakmaker water park.  It's a good town for our canine friends.  :)   Do alligators really get into your home, yard, and pools?   Depends on where you live but yes, it does happen.  Do not let your dog swim in retention ponds, creeks, or really any body of fresh water you're unfamiliar with unless you can be sure it's alligator-free, they usually leave people alone but will eat dogs."
Charleston,3b0lfh,bimmerman1998,0,Thu Jun 25 17:21:54 2015 UTC,I'll help out a little.  check out charleston works for jobs maybe.  downtown is only 1 mile wide x 7 miles long. so you can walk and bike almost anywhere. if you are a novice bike rider then you can just stay on the side streets and you will be fine.  public schools are some of the worst in the country here so you should look in to the private schools. im not from here so i cant give you much more info about that. but there are plenty of private schools in the area.  where shorts and sandals everywhere.  it never snows.  The MLK pool is an Olympic sized pool downtown. There is a smaller one in West Ashley.  The south is very religious in general. Charleston is also called the Holy City. There are Churches everywhere. In fact there is a law that you cant build buildings taller then the church steeples downtown (there are exceptions).   The East Side is probably the most dangerous hood downtown. I lived there for a year and did not have a problem. More and more college kids are moving to that area and things are getting better. Its really not that bad at all tbh. The east side also has many affordable apartments.  James Island or Mount Pleasant are probably good places to raise a family. I live in Mount P but i think James Island is cooler.

John C Calhoun supported something that's terrible but acceptable in his time. He was a vice president and therefore meaningful to South Carolina. He's not standing on top of slaves in this statue, it's purpose isn't to push hate. The flag used to be a symbol of state's rights and now is only a symbol of hate. One deserves to be destroyed and the other doesnt. How about instead of vandalism, get the community together and try to force the local government to change the statue, to Dr. King for example."

Is it, then, not certain that if something is not done to arrest it, the South will be forced to choose between abolition and secession? Indeed, as events are now moving, it will not require the South to secede in order to dissolve the Union. Agitation will of itself effect it, of which its past history furnishes abundant proof--as I shall next proceed to show.""   John C. Calhoun, March 4th 1850.  He died March 31st, 1850.    Did he say something within those 4 weeks to rescind this?  Also, no one says Lincoln was a saint or a spokesperson for racial equality.  He did, however, end slavery in the United States of America, so he gets a bit of a pass.

Charleston,3au4td,imagineskyscrapers,3,Tue Jun 23 19:27:22 2015 UTC,It hasn't seemed to affect our tourism much or the fact we rank so high as a friendly city. It looks more like people are trying to make issues out of non-issues.   If people really want change in mentality of the south they should focus on education.   Removing statues and flags will not fix the underlying problems.   It's akin to finding a pile of shit on your floor and hiding it with a rug and calling it clean.

Charleston,3aqojw,safety3rd,10,Mon Jun 22 18:56:46 2015 UTC,"I think its a fair and honest question to ponder, and for that reason I personally think it does have a place in the sub. I mention this only to contrast it with the folks coming in over the past few days dumping links filled with rhetoric and no actual approach for conversation.   I tend to agree with u/Al_Grain (I think). I think socio-economic condition is a bigger driver for most things outside of what you listed, where cultural ties/needs drive what you did list. Race of course plays a role in determining both of these attributes.    In Charleston specifically, I would wager that there are not many places segregated due to Jim-crow esque ""you dont belong here, get out"" mentality.  I've not seen it occur (though, I'm not a CHS Lifer), and I wouldn't want to be somewhere that did. That said I'm a white dude, and this is not something I'd frequently be on the receiving end of - so I could be completely wrong. I would be interested to hear other experiences.  I've been the only white guy in restaurants in predominantly African American neighborhoods and I've always been welcomed. It can be a strange, uncomfortable experience if you've not been in that position before - and you know what it's ok if you're honestly willing to try."
Charleston,3aqojw,admrltact,4,Mon Jun 22 21:43:35 2015 UTC,"As a hispanic in MP, Ive gotten that ""you don't belong here"" attitude when I first moved here. I'm originally from LA and used to people just not caring enough to hate on you. In all honesty, i've learned to dress a certain way when I'm around town so I don't get that attitude towards me. When I first moved here I'd go out in pj's or my laziest outfits and there were a few times when I'd come home crying because the attitudes towards my presence was so bad. My husband is white so he'd try to make a joke out of it, it wasn't funny or fun to me at all. He doesn't or would never understand what it's like to get treated like you'll never be up to someone else's level because of the way you look. I've never felt so horrible about myself. Like I said, I've learned to dress a certain way when I go out so I don't get it as much as I used to. And may I add that it's a plus that I don't exactly look hispanic? Isn't it sad that that's exactly how I word it and say it to people who ask about it? I lived in West Ashley before coming to MP, miss the semi diversity that was there.   Edit: edited. :P"
Charleston,3aqojw,aintitso,2,Fri Jun 26 06:27:28 2015 UTC,"Thank you for sharing your experience. I hope being able to voice it has given you some relief,if only minor.   You mentioned WA being semi better, do you find MP the norm for the entire CHS area, or the exception?"
Charleston,3aqojw,admrltact,5,Fri Jun 26 11:07:01 2015 UTC,"In all honesty, it's nice to get it out. Not many people realize that charleston is not as awesome as they think it is with people getting along racially. Yeah, it's not terrible but there's definitely a tension they like to ignore. I want to say its the norm, but I feel semi bad admitting it. I think it really depends on where you are. There's not that many hispanics here in general or races other than black and white. My best friend is visiting from LA and was surprised that there is no diversity here. I have made a hispanic friend who grew up in Charleston, too. She can admit that there is no equality of any kind here. I brought the subject up to her after a couple of bad experiences with the people here, I wasn't sure if it was just me and even she had some to get angry about. She does look more hispanic than I do though. I'm fairly light skinned and olive toned, usually mistaken as Middle Eastern and/or Mediterranean."
Charleston,3aqojw,aintitso,1 point,Fri Jun 26 11:23:37 2015 UTC,"Your experience is your experience, you shouldn't feel bad for feeling the way you do.   I think a lot of folks definition of racism goes back to high school units on civil rights. That kind of active aggressive action that were fought against is exceedingly rare now so ""its all better"", but all other tension is explained away or somehow justified as anything but racism.  Its also less clear how to change it. I'm hoping the recent outcry against the flag is an indication that people are thinking about it a bit deeper about considering how actions impact others.  While not perfect by any stretch I do feel Charleston is much further along than other places I've lived and visited in the south. My hope is to help make it better."
Charleston,3aqojw,admrltact,2,Sat Jun 27 00:56:09 2015 UTC,I would like to second the socioeconomic issue. Specifically the schools play a huge factor. I volunteer and the differences in schools in the area is startling. There is a cycle that is occurring in the poorer schools and it traps people in that socioeconomic level especially in north Charleston. Many of the schools have high african american or latino populations. For example: high school kids unable to read and write and too embarrassed to get help and being passed year after year. Its nuts and its sad and it needs more attention than its been getting.
Charleston,3aqojw,chromarush,7,Wed Jun 24 20:15:18 2015 UTC,"I think what you're discussing is called ""De Facto"" segregation. I'll keep my social commentary to a minimum but in most communities everyone seeks out and spends time with people with common interests, backgrounds and socio-economic status.    What it really comes down to is how you treat people you don't know. In Charleston I feel that for the most part we try to do our best to be helpful and kind to our neighbors and visitors alike, regardless of race."

I'm Australian, and we were in Charleston 2 years ago on a road trip down the East coast of the USA. My mum and I were out walking, got hopelessly lost (neither of us had phones), and stumbled upon this church about midday on a Sunday.   We walked inside and asked for help, and immediately had at least 10 people jump up and offer to help. One lady, I believe her name was Janet (Jenna, Janae maybe?) walked us all the way back to the house we were staying at, 2 miles away. I'd completely forgotten about it until I saw this beautiful little place on the news a few days ago.   You have some real beautiful people down there in Charleston. You should be proud."

Charleston,3arysc,TotesMessenger,-4,Sat Jul 11 21:04:48 2015 UTC,"Actually. The confederate flag was associated with southern rednecks since the 1970s from the dukes of hazzard t.v. show. After that, it was adopted by all southerners and became associated with ignorant and racist small town boys. So modern day perspective has no knowledge of what the southern flag actually stood for. It reminds me how in the public perspective, black people are seen as violent and like to steal. In both cases, a few bad apples spoil the whole bunch."

There is no such thing as a ""southern flag"" either, as many people from the south do not identify with the confederate flag. My point is that you are incorrect in saying it has not been associated with racism for a very long time. If you search ""history of the confederate flag"" I am sure you could confirm this."
Charleston,3arysc,patrickincola,-3,Wed Jun 24 01:17:47 2015 UTC,"Many people in the southern central states carry the flag daily. On licence plates, tee shirts. I never said that it hasn't been associated with racism, it has (a few bad apples). I said that only in recent knowledge it has been changed. It was originally a banner for America to be run by individual states. Plantation owners wanted to keep slaves because they were making money hand over fist. Yankees wanted to free the people but could only do it if there was a central government/army. It wasn't about race, it was about the direction of the nation, liberty for all, or corporations (hint)."

But either way, that flag hasn't meant anything to charleston, or the Carolinas until days after the shootings happened. It bothered no one for decades, maybe a century. We've established that it has been associated with racism years after the civil war, you may have a fulcrum of it being racist to begin with. But it bothered nobody all these years because the flag meant nothing to Charleston. This whole subject is like going out and dating an ex girlfriend because it's easier than dealing with things. From This, and other posters' line of thinking, we should also get rid of the slave market, right? It is the most glaring symbol in town.."
Charleston,3arysc,Rush-into-the-fray,2,Wed Jun 24 04:14:08 2015 UTC,"Hi there.  Fact-checker, reporting for duty.  The flag was placed on the capitol building in 1961, in a gigantic middle finger to the Civil Rights Movement.  People have been trying to get it taken since then, in varying numbers and degrees of effort.  In 2000, a compromise was struck where the flag was to be moved from the Capitol building to a spot on the Statehouse grounds.  People, both black and white, continued their efforts to have it removed from government property.  That movement is only coming to the forefront now because of the shootings, yes, but that doesn't mean they weren't happening."
Charleston,3arysc,Replay1986,-5,Thu Jun 25 14:55:58 2015 UTC,A giant middle finger to the civil rights movement? Is that the official statement? There are organizations strictly for helping the black cause. Why weren't they involved?  Not enough effort was made until now. This just looks like an embarrassed white effort. You and I both know there was no division among charlestinians even with the flag up. I personally have no skin in the game. We can erase the bad parts of history all we want.

Charleston,3amfu3,ChurchOfAbortionism,25,Sun Jun 21 19:44:41 2015 UTC,"I know how I feel about the statue and this defacement, to me, is extremely offensive. The Confederate dead should be left in peace. These men born later or earlier would have died in other wars preserving the ideals of America.  Blaming an individual soldier doesn't make any sense. Honoring those that would stand between their country and war's devastation and commemorating their sacrifice is important to me  Many of these men were sold ""that old lie"": dulce et decorum est. They went to their rest serving honorably. Essentially their blood was spent to line the pockets of a morally bankrupt system.  I'm sure many were racists and hated blacks and wanted to suppress them. That's not the issue here. We honor WWII veterans who, with a segregated force, probably had similar beliefs.  Perhaps it's my perspective as a graduate of The Citadel. Seeing one of my classmates' names on the war memorial for ""The War on Terror"" near those who died in the ""War Between the States"" was pretty sobering.  So maybe it's out of ingrained respect, a belief that the dead should be left to their rest, or the view that young men shouldn't be led to their deaths by the powerful for personal gain..."
Charleston,3amfu3,angryundead,3,Mon Jun 22 01:01:31 2015 UTC,"To me, this is like defacing a Nazi soldiers memorial. The difference between this and every other war is that the other men died overseas defending our country and constitution, not defending their right to own slaves (or have the liberty to exercise state rights, even though it derived from the legality of having slaves). As someone who is not black and has no history of my people being enslaved, I can't even imagine what it must be like to walk around and constantly see symbols reminding me of when my people were oppressed, especially a celebration of that time. I salute every soldier who fought to defend the US constitution but these people did not, plain and simple. I agree that the dead should not be disturbed, but I definitely think the ""glory"" of the Confederacy should be remembered in museums, not public squares."
Charleston,3amfu3,patrickincola,3,Tue Jun 23 13:50:37 2015 UTC,"To me, this is like defacing a Nazi soldiers memorial   I'm not sure what you mean by ""Nazi"" soldier. The Wehrmact was both a volunteer and conscript body of troops. I'm sure many of those men were forced or coerced into fighting and did so under the law of their own system. If I saw a memorial to the Wehrmact soldiers who died I would bow my head and say a prayer: war is a terrible thing.   ...defending our country and constitution...   Many of those men, as well as those of the Confederate states, would have believed that they were fighting for home, country, constitution, or way of life.  In the end many would have been fighting to just make it home alive.   ...soldier who fought to defend the US constitution...   These are men who would have done so excepting that they ended up on the wrong side of a geographical line. Firm in their beliefs that they were doing the right thing. I think our intervention in Vietnam, Iraq, and Afghanistan is wrong (though some good has resulted) but does that mean that I place that guilt on individual soldiers, sailors, and Marines?    ...but I definitely think the ""glory"" of the Confederacy should be remembered in museums, not public squares.   There is nothing on the defaced statue that speaks to the ""glory"" of the Confederacy but, simply, to the men who defended Charleston from attack. Charleston, a city like many others full of civilians, on Sherman's march to the sea.  I would understand if, like your Nazi example, it was adorned Confederate regalia or at all bold in its iconography. But if it is then I just don't see it.  Further the Federal government later both approved funds for the marking and maintenance of Confederate graves as well as considering the Confederate soldiers veterans for the purposes of pension. In light of this, which I did not previously know, I'd say this is a more serious defacement than I initially thought.   I can't even imagine what it must be like to walk around and constantly see symbols reminding me of when my people were oppressed...   This is the only thing that gives me pause. I feel like monuments like this, perhaps smaller and simpler, are fine but more ostentatious displays of iconography that has been both used for hate and repeatedly interpreted as hateful are not. It's a fine line.  Is this ok? Is this? What about this or this? And, finally, this?  Where does it end? How many people need to be offended? Do I need to worry about people becoming more educated and then becoming offended? Should I plan for what will be offensive in 2115?  I don't want to radiate hate at other people. I'm fine with the flag at the capital coming down so long as it is replaced with some battle standard of the state of SC that those men fought under.  I'm not fine with vandalism, which is a crime, and I'm not fine with removing statues just because they have the word ""Confederate"" on them."
Charleston,3amfu3,angryundead,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:59:55 2015 UTC,"I am going to address these based on the quotes:   Yes, the German soldiers were literally referred to as Wehrmact. Nazi symbolism, however, is banned in Germany, so I think you might be bowing your head with some disagreeable people at that specific memorial. A memorial to all German soldiers who have died in battle seems like a much more appropriate monument considering the embarrassment relating to Nazi Germany. I guess you aren't embarrassed that white people enslaved black people here? I don't know you so I clearly can't say.  I never met any confederate soldiers so I can't say anything regarding their thoughts. All I can do is build my opinions around facts. I wouldn't be shocked, however, if many soldiers in many wars were there because they felt like they were defending their livelihood or something, not because they agreed with the overall stance of the war.  The difference between those wars and the civil war is that all of those soldiers fought to defend a constitution that states all men are created equal. The confederate nation and the people who fought in its name did not, no matter their beliefs. This is a fact. You seem to be in direct communication with these people though since you can predict their thoughts and opinions(""who would have done so..""), so please have them send me a message to clear it up.  The fact that a statue remembering fallen soldiers specifically from the confederate nation is a confederate flag in everything but the image. Remembering all of the fallen soldiers in SC, as opposed to singling out the ones that address a divisive issue, is an easy and thoughtful approach to not offending people.  If you feel passionate about the confederacy, there are many museums that remember that history vividly. The bottom line is that 28 percent (27.9 since we are nitpicking) of this state is black and we have to respect history and what it means to EVERYBODY in this state. It ""ends"" with people understanding that we live in 2015 South Carolina, not 1960 SC where one can be proud they don't care if they offend a significant portion of the population and not think twice about it. You should plan to live in a modern society where an emblazoned badge of ignorance makes a person look foolish, not justified. If people become educated and then become offended by what they see based on their education, it seems like the ignorant people are just mad they can't maintain their ignorance.    SC has a beautiful and lucrative history and the half-hearted recognition of history just continues to tarnish its reputation. Why can't people just take down the offensive symbols, compromise on less overt displays of heritage, and start focusing on the fucked up state government here? Oh thats right, people are still too worried whether or not they will be able to maintain their ignorance of other people they live around in a couple years."
Charleston,3amfu3,patrickincola,2,Tue Jun 23 17:13:14 2015 UTC,"Because I enjoy the back-and-forth I'll continue, point by point.   I'm not embarrassed that white people owned black people. I wasn't involved of course and I don't think about it in my day-to-day. I think of it as a terrible chapter, of which there are many, in human history. As far as my reasons go for honoring those Wehrmact soldiers, as I said, war is terrible. The expenditure of lives for the aims of those who cannot find another way is terrible. I remember them not necessarily for their sacrifice but for the fact that it didn't have to be. We agree here. I'm sure there were Union troops who bitched about dying for ""darkies"" or some other time-appropriate slur. I was a cadet at The Citadel, a knob, on 9/11. I know, first hand, how easy it is to get kids to go to war. I was ready to grab a rifle and kill brown people despite having no real opinion on it before that day. I say ""who would have done so"" simply because of statistics. Over three thousand men from South Carolina were casualties in WW2. I'm not sure what else to say here... in this statement you tell me that we can't know what Confederate soldiers fought for but that the Union (and other) soldiers ""fought to defend a constitution that..."" I guess you could have a few of them send me a message as well. (I guess because the Union's cause was right and just then all soldiers were doing good without deviation and that since the Confederacy's was bad they were all bad to the last man.) I'll take ""...is a Confederate flag in everything but the image..."" as part of the problem. We get to this in point #5 though. As far as the rest goes I'll take The Citadel's Memorial to the Honored Dead as my pattern: it lists, grouped by war, all of the dead cadets and alumni of The Citadel. Is that offensive? What if we move the list of Civil War dead ten feet to the left? Twenty? One Hundred? I don't feel passionate but I do feel a connection through The Citadel's Long Gray Line. It's where my viewpoint on this issue comes from. I cannot let these men be forgotten or dishonored. There's a lot of stuff to unpack here so I'll just conclude...   I don't want to offend people but neither am I willing to remove everything that someone finds offensive. Removing some things from state grounds, I'm willing to admit, is fine. Especially when such a significant portion finds it offensive. I'm not going to stand on tradition or some such to keep them there... but there is a limit.   You should plan to live in a modern society where an emblazoned badge of ignorance makes a person look foolish, not justified. If people become educated and then become offended by what they see based on their education, it seems like the ignorant people are just mad they can't maintain their ignorance.   This should probably read a little differently mainly in that I have to account for the future beliefs of others. You might call something a ""badge of ignorance"" when I've never even heard that point of view.  I guess a lot of it comes down to how we even begin to define ""offensive.""  We agree on one thing though: our state's government is beyond fucked and this, overall, is a distraction. It's one reason I'm not too fired up (more than posting on the internet) about it. Well, that and this vandalism being a crime.  I've got serious suspicions, but no time to do the research, that many of the issues the southern (former Confederate) states face with regards to the Federal government, education, this ignorance issue, and many other things stems from the Reconstruction. It's also really easy to romanticize the underdog story of Johnny Reb against those Yankee interlopers.  That's just my two sense.  What I really want is my college to just get left alone."
Charleston,3amfu3,angryundead,3,Tue Jun 23 18:39:22 2015 UTC,Very well said.
Charleston,3amfu3,wisertime07,3,Mon Jun 22 01:35:29 2015 UTC,"I have mixed feelings about confederate statues in general, but I don't think defacement or removal is appropriate.    A few years ago I took a trip to Wittenberg Germany. On the main city church they have what is called a Judensau, (Jewish Sow). The wiki doesnt quite describe the context fully, but in medieval period it was installed as a mockery of the jewish people. During some festivals (it wasnt clear to me whether it was christian or jewish, or both) the local rabbi would be forced to climb a ladder to kiss the statue.   Now given the long offensive history of this statue, an argument could be made to remove it. Instead, the church had a memorial installed right below it that memorialized those affected by anti-semitism and some plaques explaining the history.   I think this is a balanced approach that could be applied to confederate memorials. We leave them not to glorify the cause, but to remember what that cause cost us."
Charleston,3amfu3,admrltact,7,Mon Jun 22 22:27:27 2015 UTC,Get out of here with that logic.  There's no place for that.  I think we're supposed to just vandalize and paint over all this stuff until the history books forget that there ever was a Civil War.

Charleston does a great job of honoring it's African-American heritage, but it also STILL has all of the Confederate Memorials put up under Jim Crow.  IMHO we should take down this statue, the statue of John C Calhoun in Marion Square and the other memorials to people who defended slavery and segregation and replace them with memorials that reflect the brighter aspect of Charleston heritage (Robert Smalls, Francis Marion, etc).

Did you know that Abraham Lincoln was a racist? He was a member of the group called American Colonization Society who's primary goal was to ship African-American slaves back to Africa so that we would have a pure society.   ""In the language of Mr. Jefferson, uttered many years ago, ""It is still in our power to direct the process of emancipation, and deportation, peaceably, and in such slow degrees, as that the evil will wear off insensibly; and in their places be, pari passu [on an equal basis], filled up by free white laborers.""  Wow, deportation!  and  ""I have no purpose to introduce political and social equality between the white and black races. There is physical difference between the two which, in my judgment, will probably forever forbid their living together upon the footing of perfect equality, and inasmuch as it becomes a necessity that there must be a difference, I, as well as Judge Douglas, am in favor of the race to which I belong having the superior position.  Wow, whites are superior!  So few people have any real reference to the social issues of our country. We were built on racism. Not just white and black, but Italian and Irish, White and Chinese, etc, etc...  Most of our heroes of our past were racist in one form or another."
Charleston,3amfu3,Palmettojcm,5,Mon Jun 22 02:28:14 2015 UTC,Yeah but the narrative they learn in school doesn't cover that so it didn't happen.
Charleston,3amfu3,msudave54,2,Mon Jun 22 16:00:14 2015 UTC,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln_and_slavery#Colonization It's not reasonable to compare Lincoln quoted out of context to Calhoun quoted in context.  The Liberia movement was not FORCED deportation.  It was voluntary.    Moreover, Lincoln's view on the matter changed after the Civil War.  No one is perfect, but Lincoln was simultaneously improving himself and the world around him. On the other hand, Calhoun became MORE of a fire-eater as he aged.  The most racist things he ever said were in the latter years of his life.  For example: ""Many in the South once believed that slavery was a moral and political evil. That folly and delusion are gone. We see it now in its true light, and regard it as the most safe and stable basis for free institutions in the world."" Regarding slavery (1838), as quoted in Time-Life Books The Civil War, vol. 1 (Brother Against Brother), Time Inc, New York (1983)"
Charleston,3amfu3,Rush-into-the-fray,-9,Tue Jun 23 01:05:03 2015 UTC,"People who forget the past are doomed to repeat it. Slavery is the part of the past that the narrative makers want you to remember, and be sensitive of. The part they want you to forget is, the real reason for the civil war was the north wanted one big government, the south wanted each state to think for themselves. It ended up being a round about compromise. Until recently where the people want the government to control everything, just like Russia. Oops, too much information. Resume prerecorded internet stimulation program codename Reddit, in 3,2,1.."
Charleston,3amfu3,reggieb,17,Sun Jun 21 21:06:13 2015 UTC,"This is an argument made very commonly in the south, that slavery wasn't the reason for the Civil War, it was state's rights. ""The right of the state to have it's own individual culture, and beliefs,"" as you put it. Unfortunately, this doesn't jive with historical fact. The best source that we have for the reason that states seceded is the words they used to explain the secessions.   Declaration of the Immediate Causes Which Induce and Justify the Secession of South Carolina from the Federal Union:   ...These ends it endeavored to accomplish by a Federal Government, in which each State was recognized as an equal, and had separate control over its own institutions. The right of property in slaves was recognized by giving to free persons distinct political rights, by giving them the right to represent, and burthening them with direct taxes for three-fifths of their slaves; by authorizing the importation of slaves for twenty years; and by stipulating for the rendition of fugitives from labor.... ...We affirm that these ends for which this Government was instituted have been defeated, and the Government itself has been made destructive of them by the action of the non-slaveholding States....They have encouraged and assisted thousands of our slaves to leave their homes; and those who remain, have been incited by emissaries, books and pictures to servile insurrection.   A Declaration of the Immediate Causes which Induce and Justify the Secession of the State of Mississippi from the Federal Union (Seriously, the second sentence of this one is all you need to read)   Our position is thoroughly identified with the institution of slavery - the greatest material interest of the world.   Alabama   And as it is the desire and purpose of the people of Alabama to meet the slaveholding States of the South, who may approve such purpose, in order to frame a provisional as well as permanent Government upon the principles of the Constitution of the United States   Georgia, again, second sentence:   For the last ten years we have had numerous and serious causes of complaint against our non-slaveholding confederate States with reference to the subject of African slavery.    and there's more, as to why they don't like Lincoln:   The party of Lincoln, called the Republican party, under its present name and organization, is of recent origin. It is admitted to be an anti-slavery party.   The Georgia article is really long, and pretty much all it's about is slavery.   Texas:   WHEREAS, The recent developments in Federal affairs make it evident that the power of the Federal Government is sought to be made a weapon with which to strike down the interests and property of the people of Texas, and her sister slave-holding States...   Virginia:   ...the Federal Government having perverted said powers not only to the injury of the people of Virginia, but to the oppression of the Southern slave-holding States...   So yeah, they couched it in language about violation of the constitution that the states had entered in to with the federal government, but the violations to which they were referring were the attempts to abolish slavery, and to help slaves escape. It's 100% revisionist history to say that all of that wasn't about slavery."
Charleston,3amfu3,msudave54,8,Sun Jun 21 22:53:42 2015 UTC,"It's also worth noting that the fugitive slave law was a MASSIVE violation of the ""state's rights"" for the Northern states.  The South never really believed in state rights.  They believed in Southern Rights."

Charleston,3amfu3,Rush-into-the-fray,-5,Sun Jun 21 23:41:03 2015 UTC,"We are saying the same thing but from different angles. The plantation owners wanted their state to have it's own individual rights. Mainly because the abolition of slavery would disrupt their unprecedented profits(sort of like we're doing now with free trade agreements, slave labor in china). Slavery was the backbone, but not the actual cause. The plantation profiteers forced a civil war. Which reminds me, anyone that owns an Apple product has supported slavery. Apple being the new version of a plantation owner. Those who forget the past are doomed to repeat it. I'm just full of uncomfortable truths."
Charleston,3amfu3,muchcharles,9,Sun Jun 21 23:58:58 2015 UTC,"""The south wanted each state to think for themselves""  The white part of the south claimed to want that; numerically, at the time, South Carolina was predominately African-American.  You are leaving out their voice and their preferences.  They didn't have control of the state at the time, but neither did the patriots in the american revolution.  Loyalists could have made that same argument: just let each British controlled colony think for itself, under the British-colonial legal structure.  No one would buy that as ""colony rights"" if it disregarded the will of the colonists."
Charleston,3amfu3,Rush-into-the-fray,-2,Sun Jun 21 22:12:47 2015 UTC,"That was one of the consequences if the south had won.

If they were bad, then America as a whole is bad. Don't misunderstand, I hate slavery and I'm glad it's gone from America."
Charleston,3amfu3,muchcharles,8,Sun Jun 21 22:02:52 2015 UTC,"America's argument for independence from England relied on appeal to natural rights of persons (which for governance they, we now believe wrongly, excluded women and slaves).  South Carolina was minority white at the time of the civil war. It relied on suppressing natural rights and dehumanization of blacks to make this ""states rights"" appeal.  ""States rights"" meant, the rights of the whites of the states.  If you let slaves vote, slavery would be abolished, because slaves were a majority in South Carolina.  Similarly, if you let white men vote before the revolution, King George's monarchy in the states would be abolished."
Charleston,3amfu3,DonnieNarco,13,Sun Jun 21 22:18:22 2015 UTC,"LMAO people actually believe this.   The new constitution has put at rest, forever, all the agitating questions relating to our peculiar institution African slavery as it exists amongst us the proper status of the negro in our form of civilization. This was the immediate cause of the late rupture and present revolution. Jefferson in his forecast, had anticipated this, as the “rock upon which the old Union would split.” He was right. What was conjecture with him, is now a realized fact. But whether he fully comprehended the great truth upon which that rock stood and stands, may be doubted. The prevailing ideas entertained by him and most of the leading statesmen at the time of the formation of the old constitution, were that the enslavement of the African was in violation of the laws of nature; that it was wrong in principle, socially, morally, and politically. It was an evil they knew not well how to deal with, but the general opinion of the men of that day was that, somehow or other in the order of Providence, the institution would be evanescent and pass away. This idea, though not incorporated in the constitution, was the prevailing idea at that time. The constitution, it is true, secured every essential guarantee to the institution while it should last, and hence no argument can be justly urged against the constitutional guarantees thus secured, because of the common sentiment of the day. Those ideas, however, were fundamentally wrong. They rested upon the assumption of the equality of races. This was an error. It was a sandy foundation, and the government built upon it fell when the “storm came and the wind blew.”  Our new government is founded upon exactly the opposite idea; its foundations are laid, its corner- stone rests, upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery subordination to the superior race is his natural and normal condition. This, our new government, is the first, in the history of the world, based upon this great physical, philosophical, and moral truth.   Confederate Vice President Alexander H. Stephens, March 21, 1861."

The arcade kinda sucks and the games will eat your money half the time. They do have a bar and food that is decent for a bowling alley. Also beware that at some point at night, I think around 9 or 10, they change it to night bowling and they play rap with corresponding music videos that are NSFW if you have any little ones with you."
Charleston,3agowu,zeeginganinja,2,Sat Jun 20 00:56:28 2015 UTC,I second Ashley Lanes. Also check out Sandpiper Lanes on Ashley Phosphate. It's super nice on the inside. Three games + shoes =$11/pp

Dylann Roof may have researched his political position beforehand and may have known no one would be carrying there. It's been publicized that he had been planning this for a while.  While there may be a tiny sliver of truth to what he said, it's still very inappropriate to say. Just shut your mouth and let the friends and families of those killed grieve. This guy needs to lose his job over this."
Charleston,3ahs5w,bleedRnge,2,Sat Jun 20 13:17:21 2015 UTC,"EDIT: Okay, maybe not :-/  What's ironic is that if a more strict law supported by Rev. Pinckney was on the books to conduct criminal background checks in SC (which was shot down by the SC Legislature and the NRA), the shooter may not have been able to purchase a gun due to his past criminal activities, and that, also, would have prevented this tragedy."

Charleston,3ahs5w,eugenemah,5,Sat Jun 20 14:45:41 2015 UTC,"I think that initial information was false. They have since said that they gave him birthday money, and he himself bought it. However, it's probably the case that even with background checks he would have been able to buy a firearm."
Charleston,3ahs5w,mc_hambone,1 point,Sat Jun 20 14:58:36 2015 UTC,"He was given a firearm as a birthday present, which is illegal. SC law also prohibits felons from purchasing firearms , so the gun he used was purchased illegally as well, based on his history of meth and cocaine abuse. The gun he used  was not the birthday present gun. Gun control wouldn't have stopped this, he would have found a way to get a gun either way."

I do find it funny so many people are getting so defensive about white racism. When a black person commits a crime, he represents the entire race. Community leaders are expected to speak for him and talk about the issues in the black community. And they do. When it's a white person? Oh heavens no. It's far past time leaders in the white community stand up and condemn these acts that keep taking place and admit there are definitely problems in the white community that need to addressed. That doesn't mean anyone is trying to paint all white folks as racists. The arrogance and denial are appalling right now."

Guns actually are safe. No amount of legislation, laws, or restrictions is going to stop someone from killing someone with a gun.  And, by the way, I don't even own a gun. I don't think I ever will. It isn't my thing when it comes to home defense. But that doesn't mean people should have their rights infringed, or absurd ideas be allowed to be perpetuated."

Charleston,3a8jb6,popahopadopolis,8,Thu Jun 18 03:37:58 2015 UTC,you have to wonder...hate crime?
Charleston,3a8jb6,Sunburn79,15,Thu Jun 18 04:42:36 2015 UTC,"no, more like white guy going into sacred holy place of non white people and killing children with no obvious motive."
Charleston,3a8jb6,tonguesplitter,4,Thu Jun 18 07:13:02 2015 UTC,It was at the most historic AME church downtown.  My guess would be a dispute since it was late meaning a specific gathering like a party or something that people in the African American community would have known about.    I doubt it was a hate crime but the church is by far the most well known African Methodist Episcopal church in the city.
Charleston,3a8jb6,czarrie,10,Thu Jun 18 03:03:02 2015 UTC,The church's reverend was quoted as saying that Wednesday nights are usually prayer service and bible study.
Charleston,3a8jb6,bythog,11,Thu Jun 18 03:39:41 2015 UTC,"The news just said they are looking for a white guy. Doesn't necessarily make it a hate crime, but definitely makes it a possibility."
Charleston,3a8jb6,zeeginganinja,5,Thu Jun 18 03:06:39 2015 UTC,It is now being investigated as a hate crime per P&C.
Charleston,3a8jb6,RadioHitandRun,1 point,Thu Jun 18 04:32:49 2015 UTC,"Of course a newspaper would do that. Until we have witness testimony (I think a few survived, no?) or the murderer's reason we can only speculate hate crime, among other reasons."
Charleston,3a8jb6,FemaleSquirtingIsPee,5,Thu Jun 18 04:42:42 2015 UTC,African American churches typically do have Wednesday services. Thought that was common knowledge.
Charleston,3a8jb6,EdibleFeces,3,Thu Jun 18 02:26:27 2015 UTC,"Frequently, those churches have rehearsals at night for choir, or other events. They do it at night because it's not as hot in the churches."
Charleston,3a8jb6,nerrinc,-6,Thu Jun 18 02:35:02 2015 UTC,"It was bible study, not a party.  The victims were black, the assailant was white.  Probably not a hate crime, right?"

Charleston,3a8jb6,ChefBoyRD69,7,Thu Jun 18 04:38:42 2015 UTC,"It was a specific place were random people would not be, its not a shooting at a bar.  It is safe to go downtown, better than many of the surrounding areas."
Charleston,3a8jb6,Transknight,5,Thu Jun 18 03:19:52 2015 UTC,It certainly wasn't a few weeks ago where people were randomly attacked downtown by a mob of people.
Charleston,3a8jb6,ChefBoyRD69,-11,Thu Jun 18 02:54:41 2015 UTC,That was a contained incident as well
Charleston,3a8jb6,SDAdam,7,Thu Jun 18 02:57:55 2015 UTC,Contained to what?  It was in the streets at more than one location....
Charleston,3a8jb6,ChefBoyRD69,-6,Thu Jun 18 02:35:21 2015 UTC,It was just their walk home its not totally random attacks happening in multiple places. If that makes sense
Charleston,3a8jb6,SDAdam,3,Thu Jun 18 02:11:09 2015 UTC,"So you're saying that because it happened in a specific place it's not random? That's not how it works. Being attacked on your way home is the definition of a random attack. Just because later you can say ""at this time there was only one isolated incident"", doesn't mean it's not random violence."
Charleston,3a8jb6,ChefBoyRD69,-2,Thu Jun 18 02:28:55 2015 UTC,Im saying all of the random attacks happened at the same time the whole city would be less safe if it was many random attacks over like a month id be more scared.  Im not trying to say its not random im just replying to the original commenter saying it could be alot worse.
Charleston,3a8jb6,zeeginganinja,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:33:13 2015 UTC,"Ahhh, I see what you're saying. Random acts of violence aren't the same thing as an unsafe environment where violence is permanently a fixture in places. That makes sense, sorry I didn't get what you were saying at first!"

Charleston,3a8jb6,FirstWaveMasculinist,-4,Thu Jun 18 04:01:05 2015 UTC,So you're saying the suspect knew the victims personally?  That's your bet?

Charleston,3a8jb6,welfarecuban,2,Thu Jun 18 04:08:40 2015 UTC,"shootings like this dont happen where the guy has a specific number of people in mind, it's ""as many as possible before someone stops me"" and guns kill people much faster than knives, and it's a lot easier to take down a man with a knife than a man with a gun."
Charleston,3a8jb6,cthompson07,-22,Thu Jun 18 04:22:57 2015 UTC,"Another mass shooting, in a gun free zone. Can't carry by law with CWP in a church. Hope everyone is ok."
Charleston,3a8jb6,welfarecuban,12,Thu Jun 18 04:52:00 2015 UTC,"Under SC law, whether concealed-carry is allowed or not is up to the church.  There is no blanket ban; it's the decision of the church itself.    See: Section 23-31-215 (M)(9) of the South Carolina code."
Charleston,3a8jb6,tke_226,-8,Thu Jun 18 04:42:10 2015 UTC,"I know, but I was under the assumption the shooter didn't get around to asking permission. Criminals don't follow laws though."
Charleston,3a8jb6,cthompson07,5,Thu Jun 18 04:13:27 2015 UTC,Usually it's not an individual thing; the church would have its general policy and that would be that.

Your best bets are going to be apartments in the Mount Pleasant area near the foot of the bridge or West Ashley in Avondale. both options are within 15 minutes of MUSC on good days, should be near the upper limit of your budget, but no promises on the big dogs, newish buildings, reviews online, or not being near/on a 'highway.'"
Charleston,3abgcx,nebent,1 point,Thu Jun 18 19:33:41 2015 UTC,You are going to need to make some compromises. New in charleston means expensive or far away and NOT big dog friendly. Not on the highway? Probably not new then. It's an old city without a ton of free space downtown and the rent is relatively high in the area. Just the way it is. North charleston is great for dogs and staying close without being stuck in the middle of tourists. Downtown has some new buildings but not awesome for big dogs and the rent can get up there quick. Look at elan downtown and maybe look at mixson in north charleston as a compromise.

Charleston,3a9kbf,nazihatinchimp,8,Thu Jun 18 14:07:59 2015 UTC,"He targeted the church because of it's historical significance, not because he thought Charleston was more racist than Columbia.  I agree that we have a race problem, just like most cities in America, and especially in the South. I also think it's important for us to realize that attending a few vigils and donating a little doesn't undo the injustices that the black community faces here in Charleston, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't still do those things. What it does mean is that in addition to helping with the immediate situation we should also be trying to address the long term inequality that our city is built upon."

Charleston,3a1491,reverendrambo,9,Tue Jun 16 17:52:38 2015 UTC,"I think the chance to see someone in person rather than online video allows you to get a different perspective.  Yes, it will be a presentation, a demonstration perhaps, but so much more so is any sound bite or video clip.   An in person event will allow you to witness how he moves, how he talks, and all of the before and afters of events. Who knows what could happen. He could be really great on the stage but be a complete asshole once he's off it. Or just the opposite, he could be incredibly candid and personable and give a genuine impression of caring for the people, not the company.  I by no means am sure who I want to be president, but if I am in town with no other obligations and a candidate is coming to speak, I'm going to be there. I want to get my own taste of who this person is, not someone else's edited and spun description."

All applications start online.  Initial HR interviews are almost always over the phone.  Then if a second interview is requested be willing to fly out.  In healthcare, go directly to the employer's website or any myriad of job seeking sites such as careerbuilder, indeed, glassdoor, etc.  Craigslist is even a good place to look.  Realize also that this is a time consuming endeavor with a low application to callback ratio.  Plan on completing 5-10 online applications a week.  For large institutions it can take three months to be contacted for an interview after the application is submitted.  This is why you don't want to ever terminate your employment before having an accepted offer in hand."

Charleston,3a442x,nagolchi,2,Thu Jun 18 02:58:49 2015 UTC,"Try to avoid applying to online job postings directly, instead try to contact the hiring manager/HR reps who are responsible for them. I've found that interviewers are far more likely to consider an application that's already found it's way into their email/voicemail. The easiest way to stand out from the stack is to not be in it at all.  Naturally, you should expect to live as a one income household for a few months after the move. It's just really unlikely that you'll both find positions at exactly the same time.   Finally, I'd caution you to be really mindful of county/district lines when you're looking for a place to live. The quality of schools varies wildly."

Charleston,3a3po2,clumsywords34,1 point,Wed Jun 17 00:14:25 2015 UTC,i dont have to live downtown i am really looking anywhere around downtown. i have done enough research to know that downtown is out of my price range.
Charleston,3a3po2,HannahEBanna,2,Wed Jun 17 00:41:26 2015 UTC,"I live in West Ashley and the apartment complex I live in is $815 for a 2 bedroom (plus $45 for cable, which is required), minus the utilities. I think they have some studios/one bedrooms for around $700-750+. Look around in West Ashley down Ashley River Rd. near 526. There's tons of apartment complexes out there that are on the lower end of living costs in Charleston. Here's a map: https://www.google.com/maps/place/1+Westchase+Dr,+Charleston,+SC+29407/@32.8148282,-80.0316169,16z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x88fe7c5fefc8617d:0xe68f5c590a9fcddc. It's not the nicest area and some of the buildings are older, but that's why it's cheaper. It's not scary, though. My sister lives in a nice, new building in West Ashley and her 1-bedroom is about $950/month, with prices going up every year.  One bedrooms come at a premium cost, obviously. So if you're budget is tight, then maybe consider living in a shared house downtown. I know it's not ideal, but Charleston isn't exactly cheap these days."
Charleston,3a3po2,ibooger,1 point,Wed Jun 17 14:07:11 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend West Ashley - it's close to downtown, without the downtown prices. My two-bedroom apartment is $820 a month, and includes water. I'd look around there."

Charleston,39z12j,sticksnstonesluv,7,Wed Jun 17 21:20:22 2015 UTC,Commute is fine but I know people who have worked there and 95% of them hate their lives. It doesn't pay terribly well and they say the work itself is shitty. But its a job.
Charleston,39z12j,zeeginganinja,3,Wed Jun 17 22:33:22 2015 UTC,"I worked there a few years ago.  I'm not going to publicly air my grievances on here, and it's been my understanding that depending on which department you're in, it can make or break your job and how you visualize that company.  Let's just say I did not enjoy my time.  If you'd like more info, feel free to PM me.    Personally, I'd look elsewhere."
Charleston,39z12j,wisertime07,4,Thu Jun 18 00:24:11 2015 UTC,"As with any company, the employee's experience will depend on the job.  Engineer at a software company that has major deliverables based on commitments to customers? You're going to be crushed just about anywhere. Customer service? You're going to be crushed just about anywhere. Entry level out of college with a liberal arts degree? You're not going to make a ton of money anywhere.  Charleston is a competitive market and it isn't super expensive to live in compared to major cities so a company with decent culture, in a town where the weather is amazing 10 months out of the year typically has no problem attracting candidates and a lot of them are willing to make less money to live here.  Take responses about any company with a grain of salt as the complainers are always the ones to be the most vocal on any topic. If you get an interview go in, get a feel for the company and the team, ask a ton of questions, negotiate if you get an offer and then make the decision that's best for you.  I'd give all of this same advice for any company."

Charleston,39x38w,JohnnyBaseballSC,7,Mon Jun 15 14:41:05 2015 UTC,"I like Harris Teeter the best, it has a really good selection, and I love the Express Lane service (shop online, pick up at store, or they deliver if you live close enough - costs $5). I think they're the most expensive, but they do have good sales. I've found if I meal-plan based on the sales then I don't spend a lot more than other grocery stores.   Bi-Lo is cheaper for most things. The stores themselves vary a bit more, like the one by Tanner Plantation is pretty nice, the one on Remount is not. I'm not sure about the ones out near Summerville.   Publix is in the middle. Their birthday cakes and sub sandwiches are the best though."
Charleston,39x38w,NevaehKnows,2,Mon Jun 15 15:05:58 2015 UTC,"Agree completely.  Teeter is the best quality, BiLo has the best deals, and Publix is off in their own world, but still has some quality products. If you're all about saving money, go to BiLo.   Best meat IMO is at Trader Joes."

You'll have to do some googling and visiting to figure out your favorite. The Summerville farmer's market is pretty great. They're also getting an Aldi up in Summerville soon. You will not want for great or cheap food around here."
Charleston,39x38w,misslurk,4,Mon Jun 15 20:00:55 2015 UTC,"Publix is my favorite.  Their store brand items are great and with their sales I'm able to keep my bill pretty low there.  Bi Lo can be cheaper, though.  Harris Teeter is expensive, but they tend to have the widest produce variety."

Charleston,39txh7,vtpilot,1 point,Sun Jun 14 21:20:37 2015 UTC,"As good as this sounds it can be easily faked.  A couple years back I was looking at renting a house and found the perfect one exactly where I wanted to live. The listing looked great, it had a ton of pictures of the house and I did a quick drive by and everything matched up.  I contacted the owner and they said they were being transferred out of town for work and had been trying to sell the house for a while with no bites and decided to sell it.  They said there would be a for sale sign out front but they'd pull the listing as soon as a renter was found.    The deal seemed too good to be true so I started digging around and pulled the tax records and found that the owner's name was Bob Slumlord.  All correspondence went to Bob.Slumlord@gmail.com, the address he gave out for the security deposit had the same name, everything matched up.    On a whim I drove by again and the next door neighbor was there and I chatted her up about it.  She seemed kind of surprised by the story and as we were standing there a car pulled in.  I figured it was a realtor or something but the neighbor flagged her down and she came over.  Turns out it was the owner of the house.  The short version of the story is house was in fact for sale and there was a pending contract on it.  They had never listed it for rent, someone had grabbed all of the pictures off the MLS listing, created an email account with the owners name and did everything else in their power to make it look legit.

Charleston Grill & OAK are probably the ""best"" as far as employment quality.  Steer way WAY clear of Grill 225 or that whole building in general.  Find one person that worked there that doesn't have a horror story..  Cypress is beautiful but it seems your resume must do the speaking for you to even catch an interview.  Blossom < Magnolias < Cypress All one group, in ascending fashion of dining level starting at casual upscale.  Honestly, after 12 years of this I've learned it's not what you know in this industry but who you know.  Having someone to put your foot in the door makes a world of a difference.  Grab a job anywhere for now and get the feel of the town and listen to what people have to say about certain places.  Everywhere has a certain niche that you'll want to be able to fall into.  The Macintosh is hiring right now.. younger professional staff but upscale feel - gets pretty busy.  I'd love a job @ Fulton Five.. but there's a reason there is zero turnover there."

Charleston,39r4hw,LunchGuns,1 point,Sun Jun 14 00:18:17 2015 UTC,"Just do the interview and if they give you an offer go from there? You can always negotiate. I dont know how it is for their company, but mine you interview and if they decide to give you an offer it goes through HR, so they dont even know during the interview (besides a range). But, once you get the offer you can counter and try for better money.  If this is your first job out of school, I'd expect high 50s, to mid 60s, which is about the norm for entry level engineers."

Charleston,39ns0c,Natiplin,5,Sat Jun 13 02:00:46 2015 UTC,"motorcycle or bicycle?   if bicycle:  battery2beach: A charleston moves initiative. The stretch from Downtown to Sullivans through the old villiage is really enjoyable. The trip out to folly is not as enjoyable with little shade and lots of traffic. this one isn't exactly exploring but worth putting up here for anyone else who comes along.  francis marion national forest loops (bottom of the page for maps): several different distances of  paved routes. everything past 33 miles just adds more miles of pine trees so i'd recommend that route over the others. It takes you through awendaw up into the forest and then back on the moderately scenic guerins bridge rd. All of the distances start and end at seewee outpost/awendaw green and with the exception of very short amounts of time on hwy 17 to cross into the forest the roads are very quiet.  the national forest is also criss crossed with gravel/sand fire roads but they can get remote and rough. I'd recommend getting out there and getting a look at the roads before getting too far off the beaten path.  palmetto trail - moultrie passage: it's an hour outside of town but offers miles of dirt/gravel on top of the dikes that form the lake. Offers great views but not much shade. I make regular trips up to do a modified version of this trail. Easily my favorite place to ride in the area.  the section before the moultrie passage is the swamp fox passage through the national forest. It's a root filled narrow singletrack trail best riden on a mountain bike with suspension.  bear island wildlife management center: even furthur outside of charleston and a bit rougher than the lake but it's an awesome place to ride. It's a series of dikes connecting small islands through a bird sanctuary. That website says 4.5 miles but there's much more than that to be explored.  Those are the first few routes that come to mind. I've never really ridden daniel island past cainhoy rd. I'm sure there's some interesting remote areas out there though.   if motorcycle, still go to the forest."

Charleston,39o3bw,moving_possible,9,Sat Jun 13 03:48:31 2015 UTC,"Really? Only a day? A shame.. Tell you what.  I tell this story constantly and it's ever changing but I'll give you a few markers to consider.  A day means to soak in a few important sights; not grab the full concept that ""Charleston"" stretches from Johns Island to Summerville to Mt. Pleasant.. (a good point to make though, there certainly is a stretch to greater Charleston)  Consider you're visiting Charleston at the beginning of our summer, and it get's pretty humid.  I know you're toting the little one around but the things you need to see to ""fall in love"" are outside so come prepared for 90º and 110% humidity.  With that said..  Angel Oak Tree HUGE Oak tree.. Pictures don't do it justice.  Middleton Place Plantation If I recall, the oldest upkept organized garden in America.  Absolutely beautiful.  Walk downtown! I might suggest either after an early dinner or before noon just to help with the temperature.  King St. will involve a lot of shopping, restaurants and bars.  Calhoun St. acts as a divider so think North of Calhoun is Food > Shopping and South of Calhoun I'd say is the opposite but they both have their mix.  Market St. is where the old slave market was held and is now a high-end flea mart in a sense? People selling their unique goods.  It too is also surrounded by said food and shops.  The real walk though? I'd say start at Broad & Meeting.  Head to the water.. now you're at historic battery surrounded by old crown Victorian homes that are structured on the water.  After a circle around the park, walk down East Bay St. along the water giving you an elevated view of Rainbow Row.  Once you get to Broad St. again, hang a right towards the water and walk through the waterfront park.  Follow under the trees just pass the pineapple fountain and you'll find a large circular marble slab.  Prop your little one up with you in the center of the circle and have her shout at the water.  The acoustics will throw her for a loop ;)  Continue to the pier.. have Dad run left onto Vendue St to grab some Gelato (it's on the right of the St.) while you relax in the shade on a large swing for the three of you.  Head back up to East Bay and hook up on Market St. for a Carraige ride through town.  Maybe she can nap while you grab a quick history lesson.  As stated above, the culinary scene in Charleston is gobstopping.  Seventeen years in and our list of places to try only grows.  Given the day, enjoy some brunch.    Foodie? I'd say go to The Macintosh, american fare.  Something simple yet amazing?  Hominy Grill.  Want that pizazz and elegance?.. the giant buffet @ Grill 225 should set you straight.  Lunch?  The choices are boundless but.. Butcher and Bee is a quick in and out (grab a rickshaw!.. matter a fact, grab one whenever you need to go more than three streets.  They take what you feel is fair.)  Kitchen 208 has a nice flair to their menu.  I'm all about the burgers at Poogan's Porch.  There are over 600 independently owned restaurants in Charleston.. and 90% of them are fantastic.  Dinner?  What's the cuisine!?  Better yet.. I'm a professional server @ a destination restaurant.  It's a nice spot, but your little one is welcome.  I'd love to show you the real key to the city.  It's called hospitality.  People asks what's the draw?  It's the warmth that the people here offer.  Friendliest city for a reason.  It's not a means to advertise.. it's a guaranteed experience to take home with you.  Click on my account name and on the right hand side - send message.

Folly Beach and Isle of Palms are by far the most popular, but locals like to frequent Sullivan's Island to avoid all the tourist. The Holy City offers a lot as far as local cuisine as well. The Food Network has been to something like 30 restaurants in local area. http://www.tvfoodmaps.com/s3/SC/Charleston Where will you be interviewing?

Take the free trolley to the Visitor Center, and walk down King St. Make a left and head towards waterfront park (you will be able to take pictures, see Mt. P, and the Ravanel Bridge).

Charleston,39l5b2,iRipDabs,9,Fri Jun 12 14:23:47 2015 UTC,"Since there isn't alot of elevation in Charleston, our river currents tend to depend on the tides which I'm sure you know aren't nearly fast enough for any white water. I may be wrong but I have been in Charleston for over 20 years and have yet to hear of any rapids. I think the closest place that you'd find suitable is somewhere in the upstate or maybe around Columbia. Perhaps try tubing behind a boat?"

Also (and this isn't being snotty, just pointing it out!) the reason this is called the Lowcountry is directly relevant to why there isn't a whole lot of whitewater opportunity. You can be 30 miles away from the beach and be only 15-20 feet above sea level.  Your closest parallels are probably going to be surfing and water skiing / tubing. Something like that? If you hadn't included Charlotte in your question my first answer would have been ""North Carolina.""

Charleston,39dwmz,bethisimo,8,Thu Jun 11 02:33:23 2015 UTC,"I'd be extremely cautious about trying to cross the harbor in a kayak to get to Morris Island.    Personally, if I were you - I'd try and put in at the Pitt Street Bridge - there's a kayak launch right where people park (at the creek that runs parallel with the road/bridge on the left).  From there you're pretty close to the ICW and harbor.  On a calm day, it's doable - but I wouldn't be all determined to make that trip.  Go out, take the kayaks to the mouth of the harbor (right behind Sullivans, at that launch) and gauge the waters before you commit to paddling all the way out there.  It's farther than you think, and it's going to probably be kind of rough."
Charleston,39dwmz,wisertime07,1 point,Thu Jun 11 14:32:36 2015 UTC,"Wanted to follow up and say that we took your advice and chose a different paddle, but spent a day on the north end of Folly's. After seeing the harbor, I'm glad we took your advice; the surface was calm at the time, but I can't imagine what the current was like. Thanks again!"
Charleston,39dwmz,wisertime07,1 point,Wed Jun 24 13:13:49 2015 UTC,"Yea, it gets nuts.  I've only kayaked a few times down here (I'm from the upstate and did it much more up there).  Down here, I stay in the creeks, or if I'm in big water, it's somewhere protected.  I've got a 20' Scout Center Console - it's made to bust through the water, and even that - on a windy or day with a lot of traffic, we'll get soaked in the boat.  So yea..  it can get rough, and extremely dangerous if you're unfamiliar."

Charleston,39dwmz,safety3rd,3,Thu Jun 11 11:51:40 2015 UTC,"You options would be open areas- ocean/ intercoastal waterway ect. The other option would be creeks/ marsh which in my opinion are much more interesting. For an easy couple of hours there is commercial/ crowded shem cheek. The rentals are right there and you could put in paddle and grab a bite to eat. If it were me, I would rent a couple of boats and head up 17 from Mt P. and put in here and paddle towards capers isle. Be sure to ride the tides. ebb on the way out and flood on the way in  edit: If you really want wildlife and a good deal more adventure and willing to travel a little further, look into the Santee Coastal Reserve canoe trail. Lots of birds and gators (and biting insects). It's about 45 minutes north of Mt P on Hwy 17. You probably won't see another person on the trail. Its a magical place  Edit 2: Also something interesting to experience if you are into it is the evening bat flights. Rent a boat for 24 hrs and go out at dusk into the marsh creeks. Paddle backwards to park your boat into the marsh grass parallel to the creek and open a beer. Watch the sunset and moonrise and get ready for the show. Depending on the tide, your head will be around level to the marshgrass and your body even with the grass line. The bats will skim the grass and dive to skim the water right in front of you. It's incredibly cool and something few people see."

Charleston,39dwmz,Sketchbooks,1 point,Thu Jun 11 22:53:32 2015 UTC,"I wanted to follow up to let you know that we ended up taking your advice - we put in at Gadsdenville and paddled out to Caper's Island. Future paddlers should keep in mind that the canal right at the boat launch is shallow even at high tide; we (and a few other paddlers) had to carry our kayak back a small distance ~1 hour prior to low tide in the evening. Our unavoidable time frame meant battling ebb on the way in, which was moderately strenuous in the canals and strenuous (and stressful) on the ICW. It was a fun paddle (and exactly what we wanted) for in-shape paddlers, but I wouldn't recommend for anyone looking for an easy paddle. Thanks again!"
Charleston,39dwmz,Al_Grain,2,Wed Jun 24 13:18:39 2015 UTC,Great- It is a beautiful place. I hope you were able to view the birds and dolphins. Shame about your timeframe- the tides are no joke.

Charleston,398328,TweetPoster,1 point,Wed Jun 10 10:54:37 2015 UTC,"I understand it perfectly well, but when I must get somewhere, I have little choice but to drive through it. This usually means that I drive around like a mouse in a maze, hitting dead ends and making dozens of u-turns trying to figure out which streets and intersections aren't under a foot of water. It doesn't help that my car has a dumb intake modification that sits 3 inches off the ground, so anything more than a puddle is a no-go. Took me an hour to get from West Ashley to upper King this evening.   What I don't get is how people get their cars stuck in the middle of a flooded intersection. If there is standing water, you don't know how deep it is. That means you don't try to drive through it, you turn around and find another way."

After you are done you can see better but you are really sensitive to light and you have to use eye drops regularly for a month or so. If you go this route make sure you pay the little extra for ""vision for life"" so if your eye sight diminishes in the future the adjustment is free.   I have had no complaints with Dr. Solomon. I actually dont remember what it is like to wear glasses (I used to have -7.5 contacts). Which still baffles me."

The nurses are wonderful, you get to pick the music for your procedure, and they have teddy bears for you to hold during the procedure. Little touches like that make everything that much better. They were having a special the month I had mine done ($250 off each eye, I think?). It couldn't hurt to ask if they'll have another special coming up."
Charleston,394i3k,Redbaron67,2,Tue Jun 9 19:49:15 2015 UTC,"Another positive review for Solomon! I'm about 3 years in with no problems. If I recall correctly, the consultation appt to assess your eyesight and determine if you're a good candidate for LASIK is free. They've offered deals for patients with astigmatism before while trying out new procedures. I remember when I went to the room for the procedure Dr. Solomon had me look at a clock on the wall and asked if I could tell I the time. No way, not with my -4s. ~ 5 mins later we're finished, I sit back up from the table and he asks me again if I can tell the time. Holy shit. It was a little blurry right after surgery but I could see the clock easily well enough to read the time.

There's a reason for all of that though, teaching there is difficult to say the least given the makeup of the student demographics.     James Island Charter High School also has somewhere in the neighborhood of 30 teachers not returning next year, I'd try for there before North Charleston."

Charleston,38xhiu,ms_smooth,1 point,Sun Jun 7 20:08:34 2015 UTC,"It can be difficult to move to a new area and get a hospital job with no experience, even with a BSN.  I would suggest applying to hospital jobs but also opening up your search to include skilled nursing facilities, rehabs and other facilities outside of the hospital setting.  Once you are established in the area and have experience as an RN, it will be much easier to transition to a hospital position.    I do not work at any of the local hospitals (I work for the state), but I know several nurses at MUSC who are happy there.  One moved from NY for her position but she already had >2 years experience in the ER.  I haven't heard many good things about Trident but I've heard that Summerville is better.    Hope this helps a little.  Let me know if you have any more questions :)"

Charleston,38xhiu,Halome,1 point,Mon Jun 8 15:23:23 2015 UTC,"One nurse I know parks in a parking garage and walks the rest of the way to the hospital.  Parking downtown can be tough sometimes.  I'm not sure if they have employee dedicated lots/garages or not.  It would obviously be easier if you lived downtown as opposed to commuting from West Ashley, Mt. Pleasant or North Charleston."
Charleston,38xhiu,firkin_slang_whanger,1 point,Mon Jun 8 16:20:39 2015 UTC,"This is all information based on my job hunt last summer/fall, by likely still relevant. I had just moved here, took me 3 months to land a gig. Not for lack of try, but the nursing market is saturated here. You have a mild leg up with a BSN (I was a new grad ADN finishing up my BSN online), so I hope it goes better for you.  Trident only hires new grads twice a year from what I understand in their nurse residency program (new program from what I hear). MUSC has their own new grad pool to pick from so count your blessings if they even call you. Roper only hires new grads on a handful of med/surg floors. Same for East Cooper.  LTC you will only hear back from of you walk up and hand then your stuff in person, but even then they never seem to be hiring RNs, only CNAs. VA doesn't seem to consider you unless you have at least a 3 years of experience (or 1 year of experience and know someone).  Build your expectation up to search wide cause better to be employed gaining experience and commute then pondering what's wrong with you everyday because you're not getting hits. I was putting out dozens of aps a day, trying to network, even went to nursing conferences at Roper. The only hospitals that gave a second look were over an hour commute. That said, I've been commuting to Beaufort since November. The drive isn't miserable and I mostly escape major traffic. 3 days a week and 4 to recover make it more tolerable. I actually absolutely love the unit I'm in, the vast majority of my patients, and people I work with.  Big tip I wish I had thought of earlier, but while searching for employment, see if you can volunteer your time at some of the free clinics in town. They survive on volunteers, the community desperately needs them, looks good on resumes, and the other volunteers can help you network if you do good work.  Good luck in your hunt, keep your chin up, and feel free to contact me of you have any more questions!"
Charleston,38wj0o,MarburgDE,6,Sun Jun 7 12:49:29 2015 UTC,"Also not part of your question, but jobs here may not be easy to come by.

Having a car, or in my case a motorcycle, is basically must to be on time unless you have no shortage of money and can live and work directly in the hottest downtown.  The place is pretty and warm, but it also gets too warm.  It's kinda hard to go on about all the things that frustrate me, so if you wanna ask here do that and I'll answer more specific points."

My girlfriend and I met in Richmond VA and she also hated how we needed a car do do anything  What are your thoughts about living in America?

Urban planning, or the lack of it, health care, education, bureacracy, social services, poverty, workplaces laws, all that.  You have to tell her how much less time off, vacation, perks, breaks and sick leave, if any of those, she will get here where they are optional and not mandated like France. She'll have to work way harder and put in way more hours and most likely not get rewarded for them at all.  I own a business that I ""manage"". At this point it is on autopilot pretty much.

Charleston,38wj0o,wintermuteSC,1 point,Mon Jun 8 14:33:51 2015 UTC,yeah I hear you the vacation time is going to tough to get used to...i'm getting around 30 days per year right now..and the whole healthcare issue also blows since I pay almost nothing here... but I'm also hoping on getting a decent job when I get back...but European IT salaries are awful compared to the US so i'm hoping that will compensate a little bit...  For the bureaucracy issue no country can really be worse than France right haha? My girlfriend got her Bachelors over 2 years ago and still hasn't gotten her diploma yet...its been sitting on some guys desk...  When you say you like it here but the country sucks...what do you mean? You like it in Charleston but the US sucks or vice versa? Just curious because I really get a mixed response from all my colleagues who lived in the US for an extended period of time.....some would die to go back...others think we are some pseudo 3rd world country...and as an American I'm always interested in hearing the good and the bad from an outside perspective
Charleston,38wj0o,wisertime07,2,Mon Jun 8 14:47:02 2015 UTC,"I love it, I like staying here and I don't want to move back. But I still look at it as a sorta 3rd world country, and still get daily frustrations with the lack of some basic services or the politics, or the urban sprawl, or the shitty roads, list goes on.   It's a love-hate relationship, if that makes sense.  European higher paying jobs don't pay as much when compared to the bottom, as a stark contrast to the US where your IT job is easily five or eight times the amount that the cleaner lady makes. On the other hand, the true slums are nowhere to be found and you also need less of that money for essentials, such as health care or getting your kids to school."

Charleston,38smg2,Sunburn79,1 point,Sat Jun 6 14:42:58 2015 UTC,The same can be said for Park Circle / N Chuck

It was a sonic boom - there was a fighter jet that flew over - I heard that noise linger for a few seconds and then the boom. I work in a large office building and it shook the whole structure.

Guessing he went supersonic over the atlantic on the way in and then slowed down before he went over downtown. Just took that long for the boom to catch up to him so he was gone by the time people heard it.

He usually keeps a small but affordable supply of used cars in great shape to buy, but obviously there's no on-site financing. it's not his business though so he's not going to screw you. I bought a 1998 Golf from him a few years back for $3200. It was well maintained and in good working order. I kept it 2 years until the AC went out and it would have been $1500 to fix and decided to finally get a Wrangler instead :)  May be worth a shot: http://www.hudsonsimport.com/usedcars/  As far as interesting things, tomorrow at Marion Square for the Farmer's Market will be a great start for you!"

You will never find a decent car for that price at an auto-dealership around here. I looked high and low for a couple weeks. Plus you have to pay about $400 in taxes if you buy from a dealership whereas about $14 if you buy off of craigslist.
Charleston,38qi6i,tidalrip,1 point,Sat Jun 6 13:38:22 2015 UTC,I would look for a compact/economy Japanese car with high miles. Something like a Corolla/civic/Sentra. Will give good mpg and not too likely to need repairs. If unsure of its integrity you can ask seller to bring to a mechanic to inspect at your expense which might be around 100. If they aren't willing to do that then probably not worth buying anyway.

He has one parked on Dorchester in front of the community thrift store as of a week or so ago. Anyways, ended up with an 01 Civic LX for $2200 in October of last year. Has 180k miles and works beautifully. You can definitely find a decent car on Craigslist but it may take awhile."
Charleston,38qi6i,exposur3,1 point,Sat Jun 6 15:53:53 2015 UTC,Your best bet is to find a private seller. A dealership has to have mark up to make money. So you'd probably be getting a $500-1000 car at a dealership for the price of $2500 . I've almost always done well keeping an eye on craigslist.

Charleston,38lv27,laurynforeign,23,Fri Jun 5 01:42:36 2015 UTC,"I am not a lawyer but I do have some experience with evicting tenants. First off, there is no such thing as a 24 hour eviction. To be a legal eviction, the landlord has to file a notice with the magistrate court, which gets processed and delivered to you after a week or so. That gives you a deadline (30 days I think) to either leave or go to the magistrate yourself and request a hearing. If you leave, well, you get 30 days to make your plans. If you request a hearing, they will set a date for it, and then at that hearing a few weeks later, you either get to stay at the apartment, or if the judge approves the eviction, then you have another 30 days or so (depending on the judge) to make plans. An eviction process is extremely long and drawn out, so the landlord is hoping to scare you into leaving now so that they don't have to go through with it.  The whole sublet thing complicates matters though, since I'm not sure who legally counts as the landlord: the property manager with whom you have no agreement, or the tenant you are subleasing from. Do you still have a copy of your lease agreement?  Here is my honest take on it: I think the dude you are subleasing from is impersonating the property manager. An actual property management company would know the laws and would send out their eviction notice form letter, not a scary !! power off in 3 days !! letter scratched up in Microsoft Word. I imagine that the dude realized that has legal obligations as your landlord and is trying to run you out. Remember, if he can't scare you out, he has to go through the weeks-long process of legal eviction, and he will be stuck in his lease until he deals with his subtenants. One thing I would do is determine who pays for the electricity. It is illegal for a landlord to shut utilities off (and change the locks) while there are tenants living there, even if they are going through the eviction process. I don't think he realizes that, by taking you on as a subtenant, he is legally responsible for keeping your lights on, even if he doesn't want to. Definitely contact the actual property manager tomorrow because I highly doubt it is them. Even if it is, you are protected by law from being dumped in the street just because someone doesn't want to rent out their apartment anymore."

Charleston,38lv27,shitterplug,4,Fri Jun 5 01:45:45 2015 UTC,"As /u/hyenaste has pointed out, there is no such thing as a 24 hour eviction notice. People are protected against this sort of thing so that they don't end up homeless because of an irresponsible landlord.   That being said, having an official eviction filed against you is not something you want on your record. So make sure you talk to the landlord quickly about the situation. If the landlord is actually dumb enough to change the locks on you, just call the cops and let them sort it out.   Two last things. Take video evidence of all of your belongings as they are in the house. Give yourself hard evidence that shows you have an established living space at the location. Second, and maybe this goes without saying, but do not rent from this house any longer.

Charleston,38lv27,SakaguchiQuackers,2,Sat Jun 6 02:01:20 2015 UTC,I got bad news for you. $300 is crazy cheap and it's very likely the landlord is stoked about raising to something like $600.

If you turn into the complex with the soccer and baseball fields & park, you'll find the trail entrance at the back right corner of the complex. The entrance takes you straight into the woods. Definitely the best trail I've found in the area."

As far as charters go, they seem to be more willing (at least from what I've heard) at trying to partner you up with another group that maybe doesn't have a full boat.  That's something we need to look into - if we could get 8-10 peeps on here, we could do a Reddit day on the Teaser2.    Lastly, our friend /u/Al_Grain created the sub /r/charlestonfishing.

To be honest I do not like staffing agencies at all but they got me into a company just as some people were leaving and being moved around so it gave me the freedom to show them (the company I'm working for) my skill set and ability to move up. But I agree for all staffing agencies that they are all worthless to some extent and do take a lot of money when you're the one working and have to go through a 'probation period' to be hired on full time and it's never the amount of time agreed on."

For just a summer job that shouldn't be a problem."

I highly recommend bring pictures with you as well. Doc Williams is most likely the shelter nearest you.  As for what you can do, I recommend placing her litter box and anything that would smell like her outside of your new house, I.e. bed, toys, so on. Putting food out is also a good idea, but be careful as it may attract other cats and animals Placing a sign in your front yard with a picture of her is also a good idea. Cats sometimes will run off for weeks at a time and return unexpectedly. For that reason don't give up hope if you don't find her right away. I hope she returns home soon!"

Charleston,37zew9,Morella_xx,1 point,Mon Jun 1 04:03:48 2015 UTC,Putting a bike rack (assuming you have a bike) on your car would allow you to park a bit further away and reduce the time spent going from car to work and back. At least for decent weather days that might be an option.
Charleston,37zew9,redbirdjr,1 point,Mon Jun 1 11:58:44 2015 UTC,"$20 probably isn't worth it to save 15 minutes back and forth walking unless you earn $40 an hour or so, or if you have to wear a business suit or something in the summer.  Monthly at a parking garage (charleston place on Hasell, about a block from the market) was around $100, but I think it might have been tied to my apt.  Still, I would think you could find somewhere with a monthly payment of considerably less than the $400 a month you are paying now ($20*5days*4weeks)."

Charleston,37xe7o,bpwnz,9,Sun May 31 21:42:54 2015 UTC,search around this subreddit for 'moving' and or 'neighborhood' and you'll find we've beaten this subject to death. Not sure what your industry is but you may check around for jobs before you commit. Some fields can be quite competitive to land jobs.  Atlanta and Charleston are very different places. It'd be easier to list the differences than the similiarities. I'd do a bit more research before putting in my 2 weeks notice if i were you.

Charleston,37xe7o,calmbreeze91,11,Mon Jun 1 13:09:20 2015 UTC,"In regards to you wondering if that is a good idea... Well, I would say no. There are just too many people coming in to the city and there is competition with everything from housing to jobs to parking etc. I really would recommend you have something lined up before you make the jump. Not trying to scare you off by any means, but I do want to give you a realistic point of view here.   Neighborhood wise, south side of the peninsula is pricey pricey, north side is up and coming but price will depend a little on where you are. Downtown as a whole is generally safe with a few exceptions (line street, president/nunan/Sheppard, Romney street). West Ashely is great, but I'm not familiar with all of it and there are a few different areas to take a look at. North charleston has park circle which is really one of the hottest places right now, but outside of that north chuck can be dangerous. Mount pleasant is exploding outward faster than it can handle and its traffic is only going to get worse. Daniel island is the ""new"" mount pleasant and has a more yoga mom feel to it. Idk what else to say, I'm sure I've forgotten something so please add stuff."

Atlanta is great, and not nearly as dangerous as I was told, as long as you stay on the east side of the metro. (Gwinnett County has the best food/culture and good public transportation for suburbia.)  I live in North Charleston, and my neighborhood (Colony North) seems to be a safe spot in a town with a bad reputation. I've never felt unsafe walking, even at night, but traffic is a little unsettling, even compared to ATL. I found a room in a share house through Craigslist and was able to come down here less than a month later."

Charleston,37pwsy,canibuyatrowel,2,Fri May 29 13:47:20 2015 UTC,What about hiring someone to help with some of the things he does? If you hear over to r/entrepreneur ride along you'll see stories of people making a lot of money in the cleaning business. Maybe there are done pointers you might find to help make your current situation better as finding a job might take longer.
Charleston,37pwsy,DAM9779,1 point,Fri May 29 14:20:29 2015 UTC,"I appreciate your advice! Yeah, he's done that before, but people come and go, and he honestly is at a point where he just wants a change of career, a change of pace. He's willing to put in the work to change careers, as daunting as it is, no matter how long it takes, because he's just so burnt out in this line of work, he doesn't want to do it anymore. He does make a decent amount right now - the cleaning business can be really profitable, but he's willing to cut his salary in half if he has to, and I'm willing to cut out any unnecessary things out of our budget, just so that he can breathe better, feel better, and be happier. I love him so much. I just want him to feel content and less stressed, and all signs point to selling off the business and finding something closer to a 9-5, working for someone else.   I really appreciate the tips."

We hadn't given thought to a professional resume writer, but as my husband created this company from scratch out of high school and built it to the point it is today, he's going to need help translating that into a resume that highlights why his experience makes him valuable. I don't think we could do this efficiently alone, so this is something I think we will definitely utilize, and pay for - it sounds incredibly worth it. Thank you for the well wishes - I truly appreciate feeling less alone in this conundrum all of the sudden, as tips like this reveal a little more light at the end of a tunnel!"
Charleston,37pwsy,scottymtp,2,Fri May 29 14:51:51 2015 UTC,Would he be willing to sell the company? PM me if you feel more comfortable.
Charleston,37pwsy,zeeginganinja,1 point,Fri May 29 16:47:14 2015 UTC,"He would be thrilled to sell the company. He has built it to a pretty successful operation, and currently makes enough from it to support two households fairly comfortably (ours and his ex wife's). He has a bunch of contracts and equipment and has had the company appraised, but I'm not sure what the number is off the top of my head. Do you know of someone looking to buy a commercial cleaning business?"
Charleston,37pwsy,yeasthomebrew,2,Fri May 29 18:01:49 2015 UTC,"Well if I were not planning on moving to Clemson in a few months, I would strongly consider it! I'd still be interested in learning more about the company and its financials if you had any data. It could be the opportunity I've been looking for.  For the past two years I've thought about entering the market, but work overseas always got in the way. I do own the domain MaidInCharleston.com too :)    I've followed /r/Entrepreneurridealong pretty consistently. It's basically about setting up service companies with easy booking online. Cleaning companies dominate that sub though. You also might have luck selling there."
Charleston,37pwsy,yeasthomebrew,1 point,Fri May 29 18:28:32 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the tips! I can't see how it'd be an issue sharing the basics here - the company currently pulls in around $10,000 a month on contract cleaning from 15 contracts and $15,000 in non contract sales monthly. So together, $25,000 a month coming in, but of course thats before any expenses are taken out, most of which are taxes and payroll. So it's a well-established profitable business and is worth a good bit, though I forget off the top of my head what it was appraised for last year. He has extensive contact lists and crazy amounts of equipment as well, of course.   It is a commercial cleaning company, specializing in pressure washing, window cleaning, and janitorial contracts - there are no maid services here or small jobs that you'd typically book online like that. I appreciate the tips!"

The buyers took a risk, paid a high price (17 mil), and assumed they could later sell it at a premium.   Building a road through a 60 ft strip of sand dune that is critical bird habitat, and is eroding from both sides doesn't seem like it should get permitted... But clearly there is some weight being thrown around here."
Charleston,37l2z5,Dr_Leo_1964,11,Thu May 28 12:25:14 2015 UTC,"I agree that this is a frivolous feel-good law that will do little to nothing.  But seriously, IOP is the only beach (other than MB - and that's another story) I've ever been to that seems to have a problem with plastic bags floating around in the water.    I've visited nearly every beach along the east coast and IOP always seems to stand out as having the most trash (like I said, except for MB).  I'm sure it's tourists that don't give a shit, but still.  Have some damn pride, people.    I hate laws - especially ridiculous laws like this.  But nobody is responsible for themselves anymore - that kid that threw the bag in the water - he's got mild autism or some spectrum disorder.  His mom has ADD and his dad is suffering from PTSD from that time he got a ticket for having a brake light out...  Tell him to pick up the bag and next thing you know, you're apologizing on the news for being a racist or something...    It sucks, but I can't help but feel I agree this law may be a good idea."

Charleston,37l2z5,imagineskyscrapers,5,Thu May 28 13:37:49 2015 UTC,"Well, with the jetties and currents and things, it's hard from bags to float from farther than say Sullivan's Island or so, and make it onto the beach on IOP.    And as far as bags, it's mainly little Dorito's bags, Subway bags, cellophane wrappers from Little Debbie Cakes, empty Capri-Sun drinks - things of that nature.   That being said, a plastic bag ban won't stop most of the trash like that from ending up on the beach I guess.    Maybe you're right - start fining the shit out of the people leaving the trash."
Charleston,37l2z5,wisertime07,4,Thu May 28 14:04:36 2015 UTC,"Definitely. If beach trash is an issue, hire some folks to patrol and hand out tickets. IOP would rake it in."

If you don't like plastic bags floating around, enforce litter laws, don't ban bags from the stores when 99% of the public do fine with them. Many reuse these bags for small trashcans, etc.. Is this New York State? Because SC is not a nanny state."
Charleston,37l2z5,imagineskyscrapers,-5,Thu May 28 12:57:32 2015 UTC,"Just because this is SC doesn't mean we can't adopt sensible laws that will promote environmental awareness.

WHY the hell does she burn her garbage? I can only guess she doesn't recycle either. I expressed my concern with how she is impacting the environment, and she never bags my stuff anymore - if everyone took a small step towards reducing their waste, we wouldn't need to BAN bags. Bring your reusable bags and this wouldn't be an issue. If I forget mine in the car, I just push my cart out and unload... no biggie."
Charleston,37l2z5,imagineskyscrapers,2,Thu May 28 14:18:56 2015 UTC,"Sensible laws   Have you not read up on recycling? Land fill space is not at maximum. Only aluminum and some plastic recycling is actually economically feasible. The rest just makes you feel better. It's a waste of money. The number of trees in North America hasn't changed in 100 years.  The sensible law is already on the books. Ticket someone that leaves a bag behind. That's the litter law. Banning plastic bags at the two stores that offer it on IOP won't change anything. It will never go anywear in the tourist market of Charleston, so what's the point. Enforce the litter laws."

Just because you feel it might help doesn't mean it will. Most of municiple recycling is a farce when you look at the stats. People that believe shit because they feel it without reasoning are idiots. Let's start with stopping that BS at the lawmaker level. I didn't move out of New York State to encounter the same bullshit moronic over - nanny crap somewhere else.  You want to stop plastic bags on the beach, all 1% of all litter they are?

I can still go to the Moonlie store on Market and get a plastic bag, it won't solve the problem. I live in Dorchester country. If I want to bring a plastic bag from Teeter on Dorchester, I will. I wont leave it there because I'm not an asshole. But I could based on this dumbass law. If littering laws were enforced, I couldnt. You new to logic?  Banning plastic bags on IOP doesn't reduce 1% of the ljitter, it reduced.00004% of the litter. Not everyone gets their plastic bags from IOP. Most dont.   You're a dumbass that rushes to ban based on nothing but passion. Perhaps use your brain next time.

We have an adapter for the car but it broke between our last float and when we went this weekend so we had to plug up our pump to the outlets in the bathrooms near the playground at Givhan's Ferry State Park. Also, the other info in the rest of my post is mostly correct. I said it takes about 3 1/2 hours but it took us almost 5 hours this weekend. We went Sunday and Monday. Another floater pointed out that they like to wait until the water is at 4 feet but we went at under 3 feet and we were fine. You can check the water level here: http://water.weather.gov/ahps2/hydrograph.php?wfo=chs&gage=GIVS1  Here is my post from 2 weeks ago:   Yes one of my favorite summer activities! You can drink while floating on the river as long as you don't have open container at either of the landings. Here is a post that I put on here last summer: I just floated the Edisto river for the first time a few weekends ago. It was very relaxing and there are tons of people floating so it made us feel a little safer. We have floated a different river quite a few times so we have a list of stuff we usually bring. First off, bring two cars. One to park at the landing where you will be getting off and one to park at the state park. The recommended route for people who haven't floated before is Givhans State Park to Masservy Landing. Here is a website with the route listed: http://www.tubingtheriver.com/edisto-givhans-to-masservy/. Givhans- (746 Co Rd S-18-30, Ridgeville, SC 29472) to Masservy (Boat Landing Rd Ridgeville, SC 29472). I recommend leaving a few towels in the drop off car. I have a tube with a built in cooler. Buy a somewhat sturdy tube such as the River Rat which is sold at Walmart. The $5 tubes are a little flimsy but are good to hold a cooler. So here is the master list of what we bring: A decent float, sunscreen, cooler, and possible float for the cooler (or buy an inflatable cooler from walmart), ice, beer, water, etc. food (we usually bring a sandwich and chips), a waterproof container for keys, phone, etc., towels for the drop off car, a small rope to tie floats together. This route took us 3 1/2 hours. Try to get on the river no later than 3 to avoid being out there when it starts getting dark. Beer needs to be kept in the cooler while you are at the state park but can be opened once you're on the river.

Charleston,37lhvy,iamuptonogoodiswear,2,Thu May 28 18:26:59 2015 UTC,"They've stepped up the enforcement out there the last few years. If you're caught flicking a cig into the water, leaving any trash out, or girls are caught floating topless you will get a ticket. I don't know how often the enforce it, but I know they'll post up in the middle with binoculars from time to time and ticket you when you get to the bottom. Also, be sure not to drink or be seen with booze in the initial public park/beach. There's a ramp location a quarter mile away from the public park entrance where we transfer all the booze to the tubers. I wish I knew more and could be descriptive, but I'm typically not leading the pack on those trips."

Charleston,37luw4,patriche,2,Thu May 28 19:32:44 2015 UTC,"Here is my post from 2 weeks ago:   Yes one of my favorite summer activities! You can drink while floating on the river as long as you don't have open container at either of the landings. Here is a post that I put on here last summer: I just floated the Edisto river for the first time a few weekends ago. It was very relaxing and there are tons of people floating so it made us feel a little safer. We have floated a different river quite a few times so we have a list of stuff we usually bring. First off, bring two cars. One to park at the landing where you will be getting off and one to park at the state park.

Charleston,37hnr4,bpwnz,2,Wed May 27 19:17:19 2015 UTC,I was going to comment on the cars thing as well. It would be nice if they could put a lot outside of the park (maybe renovate the one for the old Rainbows stadium?) and then keep cars out.

The duck fat fries I will say are very good though. But I paid over $20 for a sandwich, drink and fries. That's a bit too pricey for me. At least when I think of a sandwich and fries.  How much are their burgers? I don't think I even looked to see if they made any."
Charleston,37hdhj,imagineskyscrapers,2,Wed May 27 18:27:16 2015 UTC,"Their duck stuff is pricey, but then again duck itself is pricey to begin with. Anyways, the burger is $8.50, can go higher if you add bacon, cheese (charging extra for cheese is a pet peeve of mine, but whatever), pork belly. Here is the menu."

Charleston,37hdhj,mc_hambone,1 point,Thu May 28 01:19:08 2015 UTC,medium well for me has always meant slightly pink. The burger I had was well done. And I mean done to the point where I could taste burnt pieces all over it. There is a big difference here.
Charleston,37hdhj,heavilyarmedclown,4,Thu May 28 06:11:05 2015 UTC,"I dig Sesame, but have only been to the North Charleston and Mt. Pleasant locations. I would recommend the MtP location.  Try and get the specials at Poe's. I find they are the only ones consistently delicious.  Matt's is delicious.  Butcher & Bee is delicious. I've heard Coleman's is great. Some say Melvin's makes a good burger, but my experience with BBQ joint burgers is that they are plain covered in mayonnaise.  Charleston Burger Company in West Ashley is tasty. They take their time making it, so be prepared to wait, but it definitely is delicious.  Montreaux in Summerville is worth a shot. I enjoyed mine there for lunch after a round of golf. The Hell Burger at Page's in MtP is tasty.  If you don't mind chains, Smashburger in Summerville is also delicious. Better than Red Robin or overrated Five Guys.  Update us on your tastings!"
Charleston,37hdhj,zeeginganinja,2,Thu May 28 10:24:29 2015 UTC,"I love Montreaux!! I live in Summerville so I go there on occasion. I love getting the smoked BBQ chicken sammich. The BBQ sauce is insane.  I've Smash burger as well. Many times. I live just behind the one in the Ville. While I like their burgers, I love the fries so much more. Smash Fries. Dear god I can't get enough.  I've also been to Melvin's, but I went for a pulled pork sammich. I thought it was pretty damn good. I think most people prefer Home Team or Swig & Swine over Melvin's for pulled pork here, but I enjoyed Melvin's mustard base far more."
Charleston,37hdhj,patriche,3,Wed May 27 17:41:25 2015 UTC,"Melvin's is hands down my favorite ""shitty"" burger. Not quite in the league of the better burgers in town, but fantastic in it's own simple way."
Charleston,37hdhj,patriche,2,Wed May 27 18:12:53 2015 UTC,"If you're in Summerville, go try the burger at Graze which just opened in town.  Oh, and B&B is seriously worth a visit. Some friends and I do burgers and BYOB there on occasion for lunch."

I have a technician come to my house at least once a month. I have also gone through 4 modem/router combos they provide and they lost one and charged us for it, even though we can't get another unless you let them have the old one. But yea Comcast is literally the WORST isp I have ever had the displeasure of using. We also only have Internet btw."

No matter who you go with, always call local apartment complexes in your area (if your not moving into one) and get their rep for cable provider. They will have a private person not in the call office that will give you a special price not advertised."
Charleston,37g599,SakaguchiQuackers,1 point,Wed May 27 19:26:44 2015 UTC,"We had Comcast in West Ashley. One month they thought we ""had a leak"" because we used like 10% more data that month than in previous months (my wife started working from home is why) so they sent a technician out--while we were home--and put a throttling filter on our cable and internet which reduced it to being useless. We couldn't even watch TV without half of it skipping.  They didn't check if we were home. They didn't call. They had it purposefully throttled so that we would call and have a tech come check out the apartment. The only problem was that they didn't even communicate that throughout their system. For 3 days they couldn't figure out what was wrong remotely and refused to send a tech out to look at it for 10 days. Only after 4 days of constant calling did someone finally stop by on his way home to check it out and instantly saw the problem and fix it.  For those 4 days of outage they only credited us $4. Comcast blows."
Charleston,37g599,wisertime07,2,Fri May 29 07:46:04 2015 UTC,"I had comcast for a year at an apartment and it took several days just to get it set up. It was smooth sailing after that until I moved. I scheduled for setup, which was a week out, and they cancelled without notice. I rescheduled after calling because I stayed home from work and they never showed. Guess what? They didn't show, again. So now it's been weeks since I moved and I still don't have service. I called to cancel and they talked me into scheduling another appointment. So I waited and waited with no Internet and an online assignment due and they cancelled the appointment a third time without telling me. I called and after being transferred relentlessly I was finally able to cancel. I called WoW and I had service within two days and I haven't had any issues."
Charleston,37g599,Megmonster5,8,Fri May 29 15:06:25 2015 UTC,"I would definitely recommend Wow (formerly Knology).  I think we might have lost service once (for a few hours, max) in the ~6 years we've had them.  We pay for a slightly upgraded plan and get 30down 5up for ~55 a month after taxes/fees etc - not some gimmicky promo rate, thats the actual rate, you very well may get a better rate for your first year or two.  We had Comcast for ~3 years before and Wow/Knology is wayyyy better.  Comcast crashes all the time, and their service (internet and customer) stinks"
Charleston,37g599,atzenkatzen,2,Wed May 27 12:32:02 2015 UTC,"I really didn't want to get Comcast, glad to hear all the good stuff about Knology. We pay $74 bucks a month for 15 down 5 up in Bluffton, and that's a ""promo rate"".  Ready for the savings!"

They have faster options than most ISP's in the area.  I pay $125 a month for cable TV + 100MB/20MB per month and you don't see me complaining about it.

Charleston,37ck9b,imagineskyscrapers,1 point,Tue May 26 23:38:36 2015 UTC,"No, I know they all come from a local florist in the end.  The issue is you're paying a middle man for nothing.  Those companies take huge cuts, and in the end your bouquet comes out much smaller and cheaper than it'd have been if you just call and pay the florist direct.   I swear, I've ordered flowers a zillion times, going through those companies has always disappointed me, versus just taking a minute and calling a local florist and telling them what you want and how much you want to spend.  No comparison at all.  Florists themselves are sort of outspoken about the fact they don't really care for those companies as well, since they also cut from their bottom line.  It's just an unnecessary and costly service."
Charleston,37ck9b,wisertime07,1 point,Wed May 27 02:01:49 2015 UTC,"I would have thought so, but can I make deals with the local florists?

I'm not paying $65 for two dozen roses, when I don't think they are worth half that much."
Charleston,37ck9b,imagineskyscrapers,2,Wed May 27 02:21:55 2015 UTC,"Yea, it's been my experience(s) that yes, you'll always get not the even the same - but better deals if you call them directly.  Admittedly, I don't usually order just straight roses personally.  But yea - any special I've seen online or on the radio, you can get better by just calling them.   I guess I order flowers 5-6 times a year for someone or another.  I learned long ago that comparing just bouquets I've seen that I ordered, I dunno - I seriously am always disappointed when I've ordered from one of those companies.  You might get the ""$30 for 2 dozen roses"" deal, but they'll be small flowers that should have been trashed yesterday or something.  Just my experiences."

Charleston,3787pg,og_the_so,4,Mon May 25 19:13:03 2015 UTC,I work there. Different teams operate differently and have their own mini cultures. For instance the team you are applying for is a team that has shift work because cybercrime can happen any time of the day or night. Those guys and gals are on the front lines of investigating different attacks/non-attacks and can get very busy.   Personally I really enjoy it there. After working in defense I would never go back by choice. There is a lot of work to go around but the work you do has impact. There is not busy work that doesn't serve an end. I like the people here a lot. It doesn't have the cool aid feel of some other places.    If you want some more info feel free to PM.
Charleston,3787pg,chromarush,1 point,Mon May 25 20:33:04 2015 UTC,Any entry level jobs or internships for a motivated CCNA trying to get his start in networking?
Charleston,3787pg,wingjosh,2,Wed May 27 00:14:07 2015 UTC,"We don't have anything currently. I'm not aware of a lot of commercial places that have internships  or entry level for networking/system administrators (grouping this together since they tend to go together - sorry if this isn't exactly what you are looking for). I know Blackbaud takes on interns but I think they are more development but check out their site.  I know the CDCA sponsors internships look up their web site. SPAWAR also does internships but typically you have to be over 18 and enrolled in school.  If you have a degree or some years of schooling you could apply in the DoD contracting sector and likely go for an entry level position but its going to focus on more system admin type work. Thing to remember about defense contractors is many of them would love a junior person if they can qualify you on paper because they can often charge a prearrange rate, pay you a little less for being entry level and make more profit on the contract. So have no shame in applying. A lot of people locally start in defense contracting work and move to commercial once they get their feet under them. Sparc is a great local company to check out and one of the most humane environments for defense work, they are working on expanding their commercial work as well but its still a small part of their business. Seriously go through the CDCA website and just look at all the local companies and search the jobs on their sites, there are a bunch. Likewise the Digital Coordinator has a bunch of commercial focused companies listed, check them out.  For more hands on networking look up the next Tech after 5 event. Bring a business card and you get a free beer. Some good conversation and recruiters show up as well.   Sorry for grammar and not linking sites. I'm on mobile."
Charleston,3787pg,chromarush,3,Wed May 27 02:15:27 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the great info. I'll check out all of those things. I'm 25, have a little school under my belt, but mostly self taught. Went zero to CCNA in six months. Getting my A+ certification in a week or two mostly because it's easy and I have the money set aside. Any experience I have in Tech would be from my own pursuits (virtualization, malware removal, running cable, and home networking). I know with my limited qualifications starting with a networking job will be tough, but it won't deter me from at least trying to look. I'm just really hoping to avoid answering phones at a help desk. My networking teacher at Trident used to work for SPARC and enjoyed it, maybe I'll start looking there. Anyway, thanks again for the great info. It is much appreciated."
Charleston,3787pg,wingjosh,1 point,Wed May 27 03:03:47 2015 UTC,Keep plugging away! It can be really difficult when you first start out but don't give up. Maybe mingle at the Sparc Hackathon . Another great event to meet people at would be Barcamp CHS. Also might want to start following the Charleston South Carolina Linux User Group mailing list. There are a lot of lurkers on there. Might also be an ok place to post for advice. Lots of very smart people on there and lots of lurkers from a lot of great local companies.

What you need to figure out, is where you want to live when your daughter is old enough for school. The Park Circle area can be good for young couple, but having grown up in Charleston County Public Schools, I can't recommend it to anyone else.  If I had to recommend somewhere... I say to take a look at Hanahan. It's in Trident's back yard. And if you end up staying there for a few years, it has some of the better schools in the area."

If you are planning on going to Trident and then CofC find somewhere affordable that is close to 26 so you can hop on it to get downtown. The other main issue is childcare and then schools. I believe the best school district in Charleston is Dorchester 3 which is in Summerville. I know your daughter is 2 but unless you plan on renting you have to think that far in the future. There are plenty of wonderful pre-schools, but they do cost a lot of money. There are also great private schools as well and almost all of them are religiously affiliated. But yes, job first for one of y'all so you aren't starting off on a bad foot. Good luck!"

Charleston,36t7ky,Tangiemax,2,Thu May 21 22:44:51 2015 UTC,"SCUMP (South Carolina United Mt Pleasant) tends to win. A lot. The kids also border on that line of not enjoying themselves/ making it seem like a job. SCUMP plays their players up a division for most games - until they go to a tournament and them they play in their age appropriate division.   My son tried out with them a few years ago, and I was not impressed with the military like feel of the club.  Kids didn't seem to have a lot of fun - it was just work.   We're with DISA (Daniel Island Soccer Academy) now and my son loves it. It's fun, the coaches encourage the players, and it's highly competitive."
Charleston,36t7ky,rayray21,3,Fri May 22 01:32:20 2015 UTC,"The United Soccer Academy club, formerly SCUMP, is more about winning and preparing kids to play at the next level then they are about having fun as far as I can tell.  There are some kids who really enjoy that environment and when you are on a good team then they will probably really enjoy the winning that comes with it.  They are pretty political and if you end up with the wrong coach then the whole experience can be ruined, but I think it's like that anywhere.  DISA which is based on Daniel Island is a good alternative.  Fairly close to Mt. Pleasant, and it is run be Ed Khoury who has fantastic connections in the local soccer community and abroad and is a great person to be around.  Beyond that you have Cainhoy which is an up and coming club and they play most of their games in the Mt. Pleasant area.  NASA which just got bought out by GSP will be a very solid club in a few years, they are based out of North Charleston and have ties to Bayern Munich.  That usually doesn't amount to much but it's better than nothing.  They don't have much at the older age divisions right now, but for a young player it might be a good alternative."

Charleston,36qywr,Kingcotton7,12,Thu May 21 17:41:43 2015 UTC,"Those are some hefty assumptions you're making. I have seen no mention of the race of this individual in this article about the standoff, nor in any of these comments in this thread, except yours.  Regardless of what he may or may not be guilty of in the past, he is currently behaving in such a way that he is being treated as dangerous individual. Whoever this person is, he has been in negotiations with the police for much of this time, and reportedly these are hostage negotiations. This ought to be resolved right now if this person was Innocent Average Joe. He may not be the person who attempted to kill the BCSO deputy (you're correct, that is for a fair trial to decide), but this person is acting in such a way that is putting his own life and the lives of others in danger.  This person is just a suspect, yes, but due to the nature of what he is suspect of, and due to his behavior today, he is being treated as a dangerous individual who has shown the ability to harm police. All precautions are necessary to protect the lives of the public around this situation, the lives of the officers involved, and the life of the suspect.  Edit: The suspect just exited the building and fired on police, who then returned fire and killed him. Sounds like his right to a fair trial was not important to him."

Charleston,36o1hg,Unimarobj,10,Wed May 20 19:59:48 2015 UTC,"I earned my /r/charleston flair organizing the 2013 meetup at Gene's Hauffbrau and helped with the 2014 at The Alley but I wasn't able to attend. I'll be happy to help organize this year if we can all figure out a time/place again.  The things I remember being important are - let's not make it all about getting wasted face but some people want to... so yeah... a venue with decent food, drinks and options to play games (pool, darts, arcade etc) isn't a bad scene and it's also nice to have an area we can kind of hang out in. Also the location seems to generally be ""central"" which means different things to different people.  Time was also an issue as some people worked during the day, some had to go to work at night, so I think the consensus was to do late afternoon.  I'd also like to suggest doing some sort of icebreaker this year or some way for everyone to bring something to share about themselves because it can be a little weird getting together with a ton of people you don't know and just saying ""oh did you see this post..."""

Charleston,36omkj,laurynforeign,6,Wed May 20 22:23:21 2015 UTC,"The stakes are higher... Stronger currents, bigger waves, tides. More variables to take into consideration... Many of them can be used to your advantage with careful planning.  That boat is going to be pretty short, you usually want something that will track better. That being said it should be fine on more backwater areas. And always wear a PFD"
Charleston,36omkj,tidalrip,4,Wed May 20 22:45:41 2015 UTC,"My buddy and I went to Bulow Landing on Monday and had a blast. I would go around slack tide (2 hours before and after low/high tide) to minimize effects of current. He was in a 6' white water kayak and I was in a 12' recreational. It was a lot easier for me to paddle, but he was definitely able to handle the current.   Just make sure you wear a PFD and keep an eye out for oysters along the shore line if you don't want to tear up your hull. There aren't any other laws besides PFD that I know about.   I would recommend heading towards the east (right of the dock) and going out to the bridge and back is about 3.5 miles.  It's a great route with low boat traffic, wind protection, and very scenic. Hope you enjoy!"
Charleston,36omkj,SmurfJerker,3,Wed May 20 23:39:22 2015 UTC,"Bulow is great. We've kayaked there a lot. You can go west also back into the canals of the old rice (or tea) plantation also depending on whether the tide is coming in or out. As far as laws, PFD definitely, and a rescue whistle. They will ticket you around Charleston if you don't have a whistle attached to your PFD.   Another easy place to go is James Island County Park. They have a kayak launch in the lake. It's kind of limited but sheltered and a safe place if you don't know the area. Most of the big water you're going to need a 14' or longer sea kayak to be safe. The park has classes and trips where they supply the kayak and an instructor/guide. I've gone on a few trips where I felt totally uncomfortable and I have an 18' sea kayak. You definitely need to have someone with you that knows the area. My GF is an instructor at the park, so I have a built in guide. But trust me. I would be scared shit-less if I was out there and didn't know what the tides and winds were doing. It can be very dangerous, really.   Also contact Sea Kayak Carolina. They have group trips and have a Meetup Group where they have trips and classes. http://www.meetup.com/The-Charleston-Sea-Kayaking-Meetup-Group/"
Charleston,36omkj,eloflin,3,Thu May 21 02:21:30 2015 UTC,"Thank you! All of these answers were very helpful. I'm definitely keeping my distance from the ocean until I get more experience.

Charleston,36omkj,dirtyseaotter,3,Thu May 21 07:09:46 2015 UTC,DNR once told me you are supposed to have a whistle too.  I would suggest kayaking different spots along the Stono River.  Lots of sandbars with people hanging out on weekends around low tide.

Charleston,36omkj,calmbreeze91,1 point,Sun May 24 23:17:08 2015 UTC,Well I'm new here too but I saw some kayakers on Shem Creek the other day
Charleston,36omkj,wisertime07,-3,Wed May 20 22:37:21 2015 UTC,"As a boater - PLEASE stay out of Shem Creek unless you have just the slightest inkling what you're doing.  And this isn't to accuse OP of anything, but I can't come through Shem Creek without having kayakers (and moreso paddleboarders) horsing around, just hanging out in the middle of the channel, fighting, getting in the way and overall just being a nuisance.  I don't understand it.  Last weekend as I'm pulling my boat onto the trailer, I had 2 paddleboarders paddle between my (moving) boat and my trailer 5-6' away.  Something like that happens every time I'm in the creek.     Btw OP, go to the Pitt Street Bridge - there's a kayak launch spot on the left, right past the gate.  Very calm creek with no traffic to at least get some experience in the tides and currents.  It has a detailed map of ""the kayak trail"" around there right at the launch.   Also, I would suggest getting a tide table or downloading the free SeaTow app, which will tell you the tides every day.  Launch when it's nearly dead high or dead low tide.  Pay attention to which way you're going so that you can have an easier trip back to where you started (if you launch in Shem Creek at dead low tide, head toward the harbor.  By the time you're tired, you can ride the tide back in toward the ramp.)"
Charleston,36omkj,fishnjim,1 point,Thu May 21 17:47:31 2015 UTC,"could not agree more.  Also, there are two sets of laws on the water.  The most important set of laws to remember is the law of tonnage.  If there is another vessel in your vicinity that is larger than yours then - stay clear, way clear.  The day is coming when something really unfortunate is going happen in Shem Creek with the paddlers.  Every single time I'm there I see near miss after near miss and I have to thank goodness for some VERY alert bote captains.  One more quick thing not particular to Shem Creek but, if you see a bote anchored and people on said bote are fishing, it is NOT an invitation to stop by for chit-chat and scare fish away- off my soapbox now and back to work."
Charleston,36omkj,wisertime07,1 point,Wed May 27 16:09:25 2015 UTC,"Yea, I knew I'd get downvoted for my post, but it's the truth.  I've spent my entire life on the water, but only recently bought my first boat.  It's a huge responsibility that I take very seriously - but most people don't seem to care.  I've had my boat in Shem Creek maybe 5 times since I purchased it and every time I see paddleboarders messing around, getting in the way and generally acting invincible.    You're right though - something tragic is going to happen in that creek and a boater will be charged for something that possibly isn't their fault.  Why DNR hasn't stepped up and started ticketing paddleboarders or teaching them how to behave on the water is beyond me."

Charleston,36p006,jack-tripper,4,Thu May 21 17:14:10 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure the entire ocean front side of the island is open to camping, there's plenty of cool spots out there to set up.  We usually camp more towards the middle of the island so we're not awakened by curious site-seers and frat boys at the crack of dawn.  There's no easy way to get to the middle of the island by boat, most people tend to drop off at the inlet between Caper's and Dewey's island so be prepared to carry all your gear to your site.  It's not that bad of a hike but it always cracks me up to see people dragging big camping stoves etc a mile from their boat to the campsite.  You need to get a permit from DNR to camp out ther.  They're free, just call the Charleston DNR office and they will hook you up with one over the phone."

Charleston,36jfzf,ctsmith76,4,Tue May 19 21:52:48 2015 UTC,"If you are required to give 60 days notice, they are required to give at least that much before increasing rent.

Charleston,36jfzf,imagineskyscrapers,1 point,Tue May 19 23:47:47 2015 UTC,Bingo!  It is about a 20% increase.  Is that typical?  Maybe we should add that to the Charleston sub FAQ for other newbies.
Charleston,36jfzf,imagineskyscrapers,4,Wed May 20 01:20:49 2015 UTC,"It started in late 2013. Taxes were increased in MtP and property values continue to shoot through the roof. Let me guess...the Boulevard?    Even the cheaper properties like those under Darby shot up. Some retail locations had to back out because rent there was going up as well, or so they claim.  I don't know much about property management to give you solid advice when it comes to rent, but if I was in the same situation, I'd tell you to buy. If you can manage the down payment, you can invest in property that is going to continue to increase as long as you take care of it. That's exactly what I did upon the advice of a friend's realtor mother. Some may disagree and have other great plans as well, though. Best of luck to you."

Charleston,36dluh,Catchyoul8r,1 point,Mon May 18 15:28:22 2015 UTC,"I don't know about groomers as I haven't taken my dogs to any recently; last place I went was petsmart to have my golden bathed (only bathed!) and it was over $100. So I'd say not there, at least.  As far as boarding it's helpful to know what you expect to be paying. I work veterinary emergency and there are two boarding facilities I would not recommend but as I can't speak officially for my company I won't post that publicly.   You can look into pet sitting, as well. Often it's the same cost or less expensive to have someone come into your home while you are away and take care of your pets. It's less stressful on the pet (usually) and they mostly maintain their same routine. A few of the girls I work with still do pet sitting and I can connect you with some names if I get dates/etc. if you are interested. These are also vet techs so I doubt you'd be in any better hands, especially if they are special needs dogs.  Let me know!"
Charleston,36dluh,bythog,1 point,Wed May 20 19:47:43 2015 UTC,Well my dog stays kenneled when I'm not home so I'd hate for him to be in there 22.5 hours every day when I'm gone. I'd looked at some places that let your dog come stay with them like at their home but it seems so pricey.
Charleston,36dluh,bythog,1 point,Fri May 22 17:09:39 2015 UTC,"Pet sitters live in your home while you are gone. Your pets would only be crated while the sitter is at work or out socializing, etc. At a boarding facility they are essentially crated 24 hours a day...  Prices vary. I can ask my co-worker what she charges, but if you have mediums sized or larger dogs it's probably cheaper to have a sitter."
Charleston,36es99,runningfish007,3,Mon May 18 20:44:46 2015 UTC,"Sorry, OP, but there is no way I would live downtown. I lived downtown for three years in multiple locations before finally moving off of the penninsula and I haven't been happier. In my opinion, downtown is way too overpriced and the parking situation will make you pull your hair out. Sure, I miss the convenience of walking to everything that is downtown, but I live out in West Ashley now and everything I need (including grocery stores) is all within a mile of my apartment. There is no way I would commute back and forth from downtown to Goose Creek every day. It doesn't seem like it's that far but it is a haul even for me in West Ashley when I can easily jump on 526 near my apartment and be there in 30-40 minutes. Gas adds up and wear and tear on your car adds up. The first time something happens to your car good luck getting way up there. Plus being your age I just wouldn't be able to justify sharing a tiny bedroom downtown with college students when you could pay for your own place in another area for half the price. My two bedroom, 1.5 bathroom apartment in West Ashley is only $860 a month. These are just my opinions. If you can justify spending that much then go for downtown."
Charleston,36es99,Comrade_Soomie,5,Thu May 21 15:47:01 2015 UTC,$1600 should find you a pretty nice 1 bedroom downtown. I love living downtown and it will be much easier for you to meet people if you're walkable to everything. Take a look at the CofC Off Campus Housing website. Your commute to Goose Creek will be relatively brutal though I would imagine.
Charleston,36es99,AceHiStation,4,Mon May 18 21:05:36 2015 UTC,The commute will be easy.  Consistent 30 minute each way because he will be driving the opposite way of most people during rush hour.
Charleston,36es99,jiml78,2,Tue May 19 12:28:28 2015 UTC,I can confirm this! I did it for a little bit. It was pretty satisfying driving in zero traffic while seeing everything build up on the other side of the interstate.
Charleston,36es99,thingsisay,5,Tue May 19 13:02:58 2015 UTC,"It really depends on what you want. I live downtown because I work and go to school here. Its a little pricier and for smaller places, but I can go almost everywhere on my bicycle or on foot. I really just take my car over the Ravanel to go to Trader Joes. Now you would have to commute to Goose Creek, but taking 26 up isn't too bad. I used to go often to pick up/take home a friend at the navy base. Check out places above the crosstown too. The Hampton park/Wagner Terrace area is pretty awesome, and a huge revitalization project is about to begin on Huger St. The neighborhoods north of the crosstown give you some space from the commercial districts and the weekend craziness of downtown.  I've also heard VERY good things about Park Circle in North Charleston for people in their upper 20s-30s. Its closer to Goose Creek than Mt. P, so I definitely recommend you check it out.  I've heard great things about Mt. Pleasant. Good food, good roads, nice neighborhoods, and the bridge is much more accommodating to bikers and walkers than the Ashley river bridge.  It all really depends on what you do. If you're socially active and want to go out at night, you'd be MUCH happier downtown. Yeah you have to commute up to work, but you'd never have to deal with getting home after going out on a Friday night. Or better, you can host your friends. However, if you want lots of room for personal hobbies, a yard, or just don't see yourself coming downtown more than once a month, get a place outside of downtown.   If you have any questions about downtown just pm me. I'm not much help on places outside of here but I'm very familiar with near every neighborhood downtown and may be able to help you decide."
Charleston,36es99,savv01,2,Mon May 18 22:52:05 2015 UTC,"God, I feel terrible for even suggesting this, and it goes against almost everything I believe...  But, at your age - single guy, likes walking around to bars and things - and you're okay with paying ~$1600/month in rent, then you should look into The Boulevard (On Coleman, in MP).  It's pricy (IMO) but caters to people your age, lifestyle and in that rent range.  And I live pretty nearby and walk through there pretty often - the ""scenery"" is top-notch."
Charleston,36es99,wisertime07,1 point,Tue May 19 13:35:40 2015 UTC,Thanks everyone for your suggestions. I'll be tooling around Zillow and Trulia lookin at those areas. Sorry for disappearing from my own post but the interwebs at my buddy's place has been crapping out (damn Comcast). I'll let yall know how it goes.
Charleston,36es99,bpwnz,1 point,Wed May 20 23:13:26 2015 UTC,Everywhere you're looking has a rough commute to goose creek. You'll be heavily reliant on the i26 corridor which can become an hour delay at the first sign of an incident. If you're commuting in rush hour i'd highly recommend test driving some routes before settling down.
Charleston,36es99,seanc92,3,Tue May 19 14:30:15 2015 UTC,Untrue. Living downtown he will encounter zero traffic to or from work 99% of the time.   I can't speak for Mt Pleasant but I'm pretty sure traffic is also easy if he's commuting to goose creek. Going north is easy. Commuting South is the issue.
Charleston,36es99,sailor_doctorwho,1 point,Thu May 21 21:14:37 2015 UTC,"Legends at Charleston Park Apartments are very nice and only a 10-15 minute drive to goose creek. Near lots of stores, grocery stores, and restaurants but gated community. Very nice place and well under 1600/month even for the 3 bedroom."
Charleston,36es99,TheGearWars,1 point,Tue May 19 20:35:40 2015 UTC,"I have lived downtown for 6 years, wouldn't recommend living anywhere else, especially if you're single. $1600 should allow for a nice one bedroom downtown. There are many crappy places and overpriced units listed, because the good ones are rented within a week. Just keep your eyes open."

An emergency situation requiring swift action to prevent imminent danger to life or serious damage to property, or to forestall the imminent escape of a suspect, or destruction of evidence. There is no ready litmus test for determining whether such circumstances exist, and in each case the extraordinary situation must be measured by the facts known by officials"

Our city is turning into a war zone with the daily robberies, shootings, and mindless violence.

Charleston,361xy1,maxwellsmart84,3,Fri May 15 13:07:07 2015 UTC,"it can get sketch quick- Park Circle is a GREAT area but just outside not so much.  I would recommend getting roommates if you want to live downtown and then looking at Waegner Terrace/Hampton Park near the Citadel.  You are a bike ride to anything downtown, equal distance from all the beaches and in a great neighborhood (with its own great places to go).  You can get some awesome houses if you can find 2 more with plenty of space and yard. I know someone looking in that same price range, in the same area.   EDIT- forgot to mention to PM me if you want me to forward you his contact info"
Charleston,361xy1,bythog,1 point,Fri May 15 13:21:37 2015 UTC,There's a lot more to North Charleston than just Park Circle. The areas off of Greenridge Rd and between there and Otranto are just fine. The area off the end of Ashley Phosphate/Dorchester Rd is pretty nice (behind the Publix) and is much closer to the airport.
Charleston,361xy1,HannahEBanna,3,Mon May 18 18:54:50 2015 UTC,I've had friends stay at the hostel downtown for a couple of weeks while they were apartment hunting. Maybe you could do that so that you can get a feel for the area and figure out where you want to live.

Hanahan is nice, as well as Park Circle. West Ashley isn't a bad drive to the airport and rent is cheap there, plus it is generally safer than N Chas. With a budget of only $750, though, you may want to consider looking for a roommate or subletting for a few months because many complexes that you will find online for that price will not be the nicest or safest."

Perhaps the data were incomplete."

Other than that,  $750 is a difficult price to find for rent. You aren't the only person moving to Charleston. Demand only jacks up the price. On the flip side, there are some large apartment complexes being in Downtown and Mount Pleasant. Apartment Guide says Charleston has the largest growth of apartments.

Charleston,35yku4,korndog42,-1,Fri May 15 00:27:04 2015 UTC,It'd be nice if someone with money would donate towards the medical residents at MUSC. They are the ones making $4/hour and working 100 hours a week. That and maybe helping the hospital upgrade its phones that don't have multiple lines or a hold button. Imagine a bunch of doctors waiting around a single phone for a call. That's at MUSC right now.
Charleston,35yku4,89blazer,1 point,Fri May 15 03:43:07 2015 UTC,"Whoa. Is there no 80-hour limit for them yet? Or maybe that's just enforced as an average over four weeks.  Starting my medical career at MUSC in a few weeks, and I'm super excited! But it hurts to hear stuff like this. If it makes you feel any better I don't think residencies pay their residents much anywhere."
Charleston,35yku4,crmullins,0,Fri May 15 03:44:35 2015 UTC,"Starting salary for a resident is 48k. There may be an 80 hour work limit, but that doesn't take into account the time needed to write notes and do other paperwork. Plus, if patients keep coming in you can't just leave.   I hear they are required to give 3 days off a month and one of those can be a day you're sleeping after an overnight. Residency is slave labor."
Charleston,35yku4,89blazer,1 point,Sat May 16 20:14:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah I agree there's a lot of room for improvement in how the medical system treats residents. I'll reserve my harsher judgements until I have more than a handful of connections who are actually in them, but I believe you.  Do you think it's worse than normal at MUSC in particular?"
Charleston,360pqa,tinyredballoon,6,Fri May 15 02:49:46 2015 UTC,"Biking is the THE BEST way to get around downtown. Driving gets a little more nutty everyday... parking is such a nightmare. IMO, most things downtown lie somewhere in the ""too short to drive, too long to walk"" radius, thus, biking is perfect. If you're not a seasoned city biker, maybe avoid Calhoun, East Bay and Meeting. Be safe, have fun!"
Charleston,360pqa,young_is,7,Fri May 15 07:26:14 2015 UTC,"Downtown, doesn't seem to bad. I ride my bike around the neighborhood and places close to me, where traffic is minimal. However, there's no way in hell I would cross any bridge, other than the Cooper, in Charleston on a bike. I won't let the kids ride their bikes out of the neighborhood, unless they ride on the sidewalk and yes, I tell them to get off their bike and walk it when there's a pedestrian coming their way or if they need to pass a pedestrian.   I just don't trust the drivers here and with Spoleto around the corner, it's going to be even more drivers not paying attention to the road. Please wear a helmet and please be aware at all times. I've known several people killed while riding here in Charleston. Statistically, I know more people who died in cars, but just please be extra careful here on a bicycle. Most drivers here are courteous and will try to give you as much room as possible, but I've seen drivers hugging the bike lane while going 50 in a 35."
Charleston,360pqa,dawhoo,3,Fri May 15 04:23:56 2015 UTC,"The real danger of riding on the sidewalk isn't from running into pedestrians as much as it is from cars turning across the sidewalk, like driveways and parking lots, and not looking on the sidewalk for bikes. This can be at its worst when the cyclist is riding against traffic. Here is a video for example (nobody gets hit in this)  Now if your kids are small children then, no, I wouldn't suggest they ride in the street. Just that they should take caution while on the sidewalk."
Charleston,360pqa,onizaru,1 point,Fri May 15 06:25:01 2015 UTC,"I tell them to watch for what they shouldn't expect, but you're right, I need to tell them to walk their bikes across the intersections too.

Charleston,360pqa,bpwnz,3,Fri May 15 13:24:10 2015 UTC,"From my experience, biking isn't too bad downtown. Most stuff is within a reasonable walking distance, so biking isn't bad. Biking during peak traffic is a struggle in some areas though. Parking has recently been increasingly enforced, so s sure to use designated parking sectors for bikes. Our police patrols with bikes in the downtown area quite regularly, so that should indicate something for whether or not it's worth a go. The best areas would definitely be down south in the historic section, they're beautiful and quiet. Just be mindful of traffic laws and avoid sidewalks and the cobblestones!   You should have a good time."
Charleston,360pqa,Mapkar,3,Fri May 15 03:13:36 2015 UTC,"I live downtown and bike to work and around town as much as possible. I love it. From my experience, drivers give room. For me, I avoid the main drags like Calhoun, Coming, King (between Calhoun & Spring), Meeting, Ashley, and Folly Road – any of the two-way or one-ways that have faster speeds. Bring a helmet & a u-lock. Watch out for opening car doors from parked vehicles, since there's a lot of on-street parking. Also, King St. only allows bikes to be locked up on city racks. Here is an interactive bike map that shows you where they're located, as well as bike lanes: http://gis.charleston-sc.gov/interactive/bike/ You'll have a blast!"
Charleston,360pqa,bluenun456,2,Fri May 15 15:26:22 2015 UTC,"Charleston isn't really like a big city where traffic is always at a standstill and you have to bike.

I use a scooter for my downtown adventures which works out great."
Charleston,360pqa,shitterplug,2,Fri May 15 10:43:43 2015 UTC,"I'm interested in this as well. Also, how is bike theft?  Rampant?  Should be good with a u lock for an hour or so?"
Charleston,360pqa,finkleneinhorn,3,Fri May 15 11:11:41 2015 UTC,"Locked up you're generally good, especially daytime in trafficked areas.  But - theft is as much an issue here as anywhere else."

A lot of people bike downtown but personally I'd be terrified to. They weave in and out of traffic like crazy people. I come from a very bike friendly city and, though the bikers are still crazy there, I felt safe on all but the busiest roads. I rode my bike everywhere for 6 years, barely touching my car. Here, I fear for my life riding 8 blocks to work. Drivers don't understand how to drive around cyclists, not to mention there is zero infrastructure for bikes. There is a bike lane on the road that goes from where I live in North Charleston to downtown, but the first and only time I tried to ride down it with my husband, he ate pavement crossing a shitty old railroad track.  So, I guess it depends where you're coming from and what you expect....but ""bike friendly"" is a description I would NOT attribute to Charleston."
Charleston,360pqa,heckyesgainesville,1 point,Sat May 23 02:48:24 2015 UTC,"ok. Appreciate this. Especially since you have experience in a super bike-friendly city. A little realism never hurts. I'll most likely bring the bike along and see how I feel, maybe just use it here and there."
Charleston,360pqa,Chs2014,-1,Mon May 25 18:50:05 2015 UTC,"Biking downtown is mixed. Below Calhoun St, is very bike firendly with alot of accessible less traveled side streets. Above Calhoun is very dangerous, more congestion and lack of awareness from people driving cars. If you do a search within the last 3 years of moped/cycling deaths, all of them are above Calhoun St."

Charleston,35y8se,vurtkonnegut-,9,Thu May 14 14:48:44 2015 UTC,"If you want feel like a local, float down the Edisto. Bring 2 cars (park 1 in each entrance), drinks, and old worn shoes. The water is getting warmer, I'm headed there this weekend.  Boozing on the river is permitted, but make sure to have your drinks in a cooler or you could face a fine of $250 a brew. Oh, yeah, sunscreen and food are a pretty good idea, too. And make sure to bring a bag for your trash."
Charleston,35y8se,Chs2014,4,Thu May 14 17:16:55 2015 UTC,"Yes one of my favorite summer activities! You can drink while floating on the river as long as you don't have open container at either of the landings. Here is a post that I put on here last summer:   I just floated the Edisto river for the first time a few weekends ago. It was very relaxing and there are tons of people floating so it made us feel a little safer. We have floated a different river quite a few times so we have a list of stuff we usually bring. First off, bring two cars. One to park at the landing where you will be getting off and one to park at the state park. The recommended route for people who haven't floated before is Givhans State Park to Masservy Landing. Here is a website with the route listed: http://www.tubingtheriver.com/edisto-givhans-to-masservy/. Givhans- 33.030183,-80.390521 to Masservy- 33.000185,-80.405388. I recommend leaving a few towels in the drop off car. I have a tube with a built in cooler. Buy a somewhat sturdy tube such as the River Rat which is sold at Walmart. The $5 tubes are a little flimsy but are good to hold a cooler. So here is the master list of what we bring: A decent float, sunscreen!, cooler, and possible float for the cooler (or buy an inflatable cooler from walmart), ice, beer, water, etc. food (we usually bring a sandwich and chips), a waterproof container for keys, phone, etc., towels for the drop off car, a small rope to tie floats together. This route took us 3 1/2 hours. Try to get on the river no later than 3 to avoid being out there when it starts getting dark. Beer needs to be kept in the cooler while you are at the state park but can be opened once you're on the river.

Thursday - Afternoon - walked around town to get familiar.  Ate at T-Bonez for lunch.  Drove to Angel Oak Park and got there by 4:50, 10 minutes until close!  We were able to get a few good pictures, although disappointed that they had to have like 10 large signs surrounding the tree saying do not climb/carve the tree & do not move the sign.  Went to Costco for an ABC stop (they don't sell that in VA).  Walked around Queen St and stopped at Poogan's Porch for dinner.  Actually was able to sit out on the porch.  Great time, great food although my shellfish and grits was a very small portion.  Friday - Carriage Tour, Fleet Landing for lunch, Market, Nap!, SouthEnd for Appetizer, Vendue Rooftop bar - very nice atmosphere!, Hank's for dinner and Closed for Business for drinks late night.    Saturday - walked around Marion Park (Spoleto festival), shopping on King St, residential area walk, toured the Calhoun Mansion ($16/ticket is wayyy to steep.  Liked the history on the home, hated that alot of the tour was talking about the owner's (since 2004) collector items throughout the house.),Rainbow Row, Charleston's crab house for lunch (great soft shell crab sandwich), nap!, Vendue again for drinks, Blossom for dinner - great food.

And if you get into that pattern with your wife, it's a great time for sexy time"

Charleston,35rjis,ten_fingers_obrien,8,Tue May 12 22:32:56 2015 UTC,I always recommend Sullivan's Island. People drink on the beaches but they are smart about it. I saw someone get a 1000 dollar fine once for doing it so drink at your own risk.

In my experience of drinking on Sullivan's (>50 times including all major holidays) it's very difficult to get caught if you have a functional brain. Just use generic containers and since you can see them coming from a mile away put the drinks down (or hide them) when the cops cruise by. We've never been questioned or even 'eyed'.

Charleston,35ncpc,Ebil_shenanigans,5,Mon May 11 22:34:30 2015 UTC,"I'm also a nuke (just finished prototype) and my advice to you is this; don't lease. On your salary you can easily afford a $20k loan at anything around anywhere around 6%. With your credit score, you can probably get something around 1 or 2% with navy federal, or usaa. Even then, the dealership might beat their financing if they have a promotion going on or something.   I had a car coming into the program, but I've helped several friends buy their first cars here (I'm 24, so I came into the navy pretty financially stable). They've had luck at Carmax, Mount Pleasant Chevy, and all of the dealers on Rivers Ave before the 26 split. Stay away from uncertified used car dealerships like Chiefs or any small roadside dealers that are similar.   So here is why I would like to convince you to buy instead of lease. If you lease you're probably going to end up paying $250-400 a month with mileage restrictions and a larger insurance bill. If you buy you'll probably get a similar monthly payment with the ability to trade in/sell the car that you own when you're ready for a new one. If you're familiar with the leasing process and are set on that, then go ahead, but it's not as great of a deal as it seems.   If you have anymore questions, either about the program you're in, Charleston, or buying a car in general, feel free to PM me."
Charleston,35ncpc,R0oskie91,2,Tue May 12 12:41:42 2015 UTC,"It's also worth noting that if you have USAA there is an auto buying program that you can access. it works a lot like any other classified site, except the dealers have been vetted more by USAA.

A conservative 3x multiplier (it's 5x in Detroit MSA) on indirect employment means that we're really looking at least 6,000 new jobs in the area.  That's 6,000 more cars going to/from a place of employment everyday. Not to mention those workers have to live somewhere, and they have families, too, that create more traffic."

Charleston,35l0x1,Protuhj,3,Tue May 12 04:21:26 2015 UTC,"It won't affect the traffic so much.

Charleston,35kbfg,Chs2014,2,Mon May 11 14:14:30 2015 UTC,"Thanks for replying! $1800 would be pushing my limits as far as the budget is concerned. I absolutely do prefer the urban feel and either not having to drive to work (public transportation here? maybe?) or having a short drive to work and being able to come home and walk to restaurants and shopping.   I'm actually getting ready to head over, so I'll have the rest of the week to check out Mount Pleasant and the peninsula a little more thoroughly (MP gets brought up fairly often, specifically)."

Charleston,35jfn3,nebent,2,Sun May 10 23:26:09 2015 UTC,"I've known a few people that lived there and like it quite a bit.  Convenient location, well kept up, nice neighbors that I've seen.  From what I recall, the construction defect was that non-treated lumber was used to build the porches throughout the entire complex.  They condemned all of the porches and had to rebuild them from scratch.  There are good values in there, and I've noticed prices rising.  I see 1 bd/1 ba starting around 125, on up to the most expensive I've seen was a 3/2 with a garage for 190.  Quite frankly, I wish I had jumped on that 3/2 with the garage, it could have been excellent rental property.  I have a coworker that lived there  a couple years, I'll ask her experience tomorrow.  Cheers"
Charleston,35jfn3,Al_Grain,2,Mon May 11 02:25:57 2015 UTC,"I have lived in 5 different units here. This is one of the best values in Charleston.  The lawsuit was because the contractor that did the work of renovating these places (they used to be apartments) used framing lumber (non-pressure treated) to build the porches - all of which have been rebuilt in the past year and a half.   There really aren't any problems. Maintenance does a good job of staying on top of things. There is a patrol officer here on Friday and Saturday nights, as well as frequent drive-throughs by CPD.  All of my neighbors have always been very cool. If there was an issue (which there have been - e.g. barking dogs, music, cigarette butts) I've just knocked on their doors and talked to them about it and the issue always gets resolved.  There are a lot of MUSC students and young professionals around; think mid 20's to early 30's. The pool parties are a blast.  Shoot me a PM and I'll answer any questions you have.  Good luck!"

Places there are either too hoity-toity (PAC, Music Hall) or just not built for music (see the over-bassed Music Farm, mid July, with 250 people packed in like sardines and passing out from heat stroke). Pour House does okay, but it's a little too small to bring in those top acts that aren't big enough to fill the PAC, or simply wouldn't want to play there. Having an audiophile build a musician centric venue that could comfortably house a 300 person standing-room crowd (and by comfortably, I mean you don't miss half the show just trying to get back to the bar through a horde), I think it could be really successful in pulling those artists that always seem to skip Charleston on their way to Atlanta.

That's what it'll take.  IMO:   Improve the CS/CS-related education in the area and raise salaries to be competitive in the greater southeast region.  Which is to say, train good employees and retain/attract existing talent. Create higher density live/work areas and improve public transit. Foster a better tech culture, which there is already effort underway. Have the VC in the area actually invest in tech instead of real estate or whatever.  Boomtown raised their series A and had no local investors involved. Enact policies in local government that facilitate the change required to put things on the right path."

During my time at a tech company locally, they will pay to bring talent in from out of state, but the companies' needs are just too small. Companies that need a large UI/UX teams are too small to offer up the cash and benefits.   I mean... that describes running any business anywhere.  You want to buy something or hire some people but can't afford it yet.  But generally speaking, CHS tech salaries are comparatively low considering the local cost of living.   We need to copy whatever Greenville is doing.   I wouldn't call Greenville a shining example to follow, either."
Charleston,35bugd,palmettomom2609,1 point,Mon May 11 23:37:37 2015 UTC,"I guess my main point is: don't come to SC and expect CA salaries. It's just not going to happen. They will never be able to compete with that, nor Austin."
Charleston,35bugd,palmettomom2609,2,Tue May 12 01:30:27 2015 UTC,"That isn't what I'm saying.  I'm comparing cost of living adjusted salaries.  Obviously you won't make $200k in the Charleston area, but that's at least in part due to cost of living.  Here's a quick comparison.  CHS vs ATL metro areas.    $50k in CHS is equivalent to $49k in ATL.  Effectively the same.  (source).  Software Developer (Java) with a related degree and 5 years experience:  CHS median is $69k.  ATL median is $76k.  (source)  Metro Charleston has a higher cost of living, but a lower average salary for an average tech worker when compared to Metro Atlanta.  And the scenario I set up was fairly mediocre.  Atlanta has a much wider salary range, while Charleston's pay band was much smaller.  If you're a talented person, you have a much higher salary cap in Atlanta than Charleston.    My main point is: why would someone with talent ever go to SC in the first place when the salaries aren't competitive?  It would have to be a non-career-driven decision.  Salaries need to be cost-of-living-adjusted competitive or the tech industry will just have a huge brain drain."
Charleston,35bugd,firkin_slang_whanger,1 point,Tue May 12 15:30:16 2015 UTC,"Oh yes, definitely, but there is also another chicken vs. egg scenario going on there, IMO.   why would someone with talent ever go to SC in the first place when the salaries aren't competitive   Because. Charleston.  That sort of demand also generates the scenario where they CAN pay less, because they have 100 applicants trying to get a job and move here. I'm not saying the growth is exponentially greater (particularly because every freggin' magazine/research firm says the same thing about 100 different cities), but when your supply of workers is high and your demand is low...  Also, some people have devalued money for whatever reason. I knowingly took a cut coming here because I wanted to live here. Some people let careers drive their residence. Some just want to live where they want to live.  All of the above, certainly don't help the market here."

And its expensive.  And salaries have to be higher on average in order to afford to live anywhere nearby.  SF companies also have thousands of applicants but that doesn't drive things down.  Same thing with Charleston, except salaries don't keep up."
Charleston,35bugd,Andy_Glass,1 point,Tue May 12 18:29:20 2015 UTC,"San Fran is hard to use as a comparison. It's one of the most expensive places to live in the US. Housing costs there are astronomical. Gentrification and property values have been in such a way, that there have been proposals to split the state up into 8 different states. I would not consider here to be anywhere close. Not to mention, you have a talent pool that stays there and is readily available. You can pay for top talent because your applicant pool has PhDs from across the globe and results to back it up involving bleeding edge technology. You also have companies with gigantic revenue streams. You're not going to pull in those fantastic numbers with non-profit software with low VC investment, low-revenue service industry time management software with historically poor buy-out decisions, or behind-the-curve HIE software and high turnover.  But as you can see, that entire paragraph revolves around the two most important items in your above post: capital (VCs) and education. I think we are making the same point, but I love the discussion."

Charleston,35bugd,inventorjoe,2,Fri May 8 22:18:37 2015 UTC,"The Alley is pretty good, it's a row of about 10-12 arcade games from various eras (Donkey Kong/Pac-Man/Galaga to X-Men and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles) as well as one or two pinball games, and skeeball and arcade basketball. Definitely wayyyyyy better than driving all the way to Myrtle Beach. Last time I was there, most of the arcades were in pretty sad shape.  If he's just interested in playing older arcade games, The Alley is the place. If he's looking for the ""arcade experience"", it might not be exactly what you're looking for."

The food was just ok, and I'd rather just get chicken strips from chic-fil-a. On top of that they pushed their cane sauce on me so hard after I asked for honey mustard (about 5/6 different times of me says ""no, I want honey mustard"" while ordering). I got my food, and guess which sauce they gave me? I realize it's no big deal, but was just another thing on top of their food which turned me off of them.  However I am a fan of Hubee D's and was sad to see them leave their long point location (now just in West Ashley)."

Charleston,35bugd,eugenemah,1 point,Sat May 9 07:47:23 2015 UTC,"Very interesting point, on paper the area isn't diverse. We consistantly win awards for being polite and accepting. But behind closed doors, do residents really want it? (I would say the majority doesn't, but no one will admit it). I also think Charleston is still regarded as the ""Old South"" to a lot of people, and that's why you don't see a lot of diversity."
Charleston,35bugd,niorec,1 point,Mon May 11 19:30:18 2015 UTC,I mean I grew up in big cities my whole life and have been in Charleston only two years. It's something I definitely miss and have had to adjust to not having. There's a lot of value in having pockets of different communites and cultures in the city.
Charleston,35bugd,eugenemah,2,Sat May 9 11:25:29 2015 UTC,"I know I may be in the minority here, but I'd love for Charleston to finally have high rise buildings.  I know, I know, people love the Holy City for it's steeples, but still, as much as Charleston's been growing lately I think it would help out in the long run, plus I like skyscrapers.  Mainly it's a personal thing...      Edit: No, it's cool, downvote because you disagree, that makes total sense.  My bad for not saying what you wanted."
Charleston,35bugd,Chs2014,21,Sat May 9 12:32:16 2015 UTC,"I think Charleston should retain it's historic downtown, but could look into developing an ""outer downtown"" like Canary Wharf in London or La Defense in Paris."
Charleston,35bugd,noodlez,1 point,Sat May 9 12:56:25 2015 UTC,"There's a lot of opportunity for growth that doesn't involve messing with the historic areas.  Charelston wouldn't be Charleston without downtown.  For example, West Edge (http://www.westedgecharleston.com/).   The area does need a higher population density, though.  Charleston has a problem very similar to San Francisco's.  It would be really cool if we learned from their problems.    Especially considering the local push to make Charleston a tech hub."
Charleston,35bugd,hayleylander,1 point,Fri May 8 22:20:33 2015 UTC,"West Edge looks cool, I didn't know about that development. Since it's near the tall MUSC buildings I don't think too many complaints would pop up about it.  Practically every city in the US wants to become a tech hub though, so I would be wary of using that as a point of distinction."
Charleston,35bugd,TheGrillSgt,2,Sat May 9 01:03:12 2015 UTC,"Absolutely true and I'm not saying CHS is going to necessarily make it there.  But its something the city is pushing for and actively funding/endorsing (see: Charleston Digital Corridor).  Wikipedia even lists tech as the city's second largest industry.  To walk down the path, to make the attempt at becoming a tech hub, you need to do certain things.  Higher density is one of those things.  Edit: see Google's whitepaper about how to grow a tech entrepreneur ecosystem; density is one of those key ingredients."
Charleston,35bugd,powerlloyd,3,Mon May 11 19:12:14 2015 UTC,"I don't know if 6-7 stories counts as high-rise, but it looks like denser development on the Neck is finally coming: http://www.abcnews4.com/story/29016442/westedge-development-to-change-charleston-horizon"
Charleston,35bugd,TheGrillSgt,7,Mon May 11 20:13:23 2015 UTC,"Growth is good, and density like high-rise buildings are great. We'd be much better off having dense buildings near employers than sprawling subdivisions 40 minutes commute each way.  High rise buildings may not be appropriate south of Broad, but allowing developers to site them along upper Meeting would be great for the neighborhoods."

Charleston,35bugd,TheGrillSgt,-1,Sat May 9 17:02:21 2015 UTC,I can tell you now that that will not be happening anywhere near the main downtown peninsula. Charleston will be doing a major push on preserving it's historic districts and I think it's fantastic. We are known for our historic districts and shouldn't be letting high rise buildings take over. We already have an eyesore of King and Calhoun now but anything high rise will hopefully be pushed elsewhere.

If you're super concerned about the situation but definitely going forward, you can also let someone know where you're going and set up a contact time so if they haven't heard from you by that time they call the police with your location (just don't forget to check in).   You might also want to do some serious searching/googling on the address to see if it pops up somewhere as a rental before, if it's been posted before and looks legit, it might be that much more likely.  Edit: you can also check the address on https://www.crimereports.com/ to see if the location is sketchy or not, if you haven't done something similar already."
Charleston,35cper,omegaorion,2,Sat May 9 01:30:23 2015 UTC,"We have a realtor who we've been working with, but on a lark checked out Craigslist and saw this place about 10 minutes after it had been posted. All of the flags are there: asks for cash, seems to be about $100 cheaper than it should be, wanted to make sure we did not bring a realtor... My plan is to leave the cash in a car, where my dash cam will be running, and then do any transactions in front of said car. It's not a good plan, because you can clearly see I have a dash cam, but it's all that I have. We did Google the hell out of the location and the person, but everything there seems to be legit. It just feels like we're walking into a trap. Although, it could be my many years of living in really, really shitty areas.  Edit: 0 Incidents shown. Cool link. Thank you."
Charleston,35cper,illiana89552,3,Sat May 9 01:37:17 2015 UTC,"It could easily be a scam.   I was looking for a home to rent on Craiglist a few months back, found something perfect and affordable. Got a lot of cryptic messages from the landlord, and then wanted my deposit wired to a third party bank account? When I went to see the house in person, there was a realtor sign in the yard. After contacting them, i was notified it was a scam when someone takes photos off the realtor website and makes a Craigslist post about it.   Lesson learned, if it seems to good to be true, it probably is!"
Charleston,35cper,illiana89552,2,Sat May 9 01:43:07 2015 UTC,"That's just the thing, they never asked for any money up front. What they wanted instead was for us to look at the house and see if it was something that we wanted. They did say that they only wanted to deal in cash and only with people who did not have a realtor, but there are good reasons for both of those. all of the correspondences could have been written by anyone's Grandma. She did everything but forward me a racist joke from 1998 with clipart added to the bottom. I don't know, we can't pass it up, but its a three hour drive just to find out whether or not this person is full of shit."
Charleston,35cper,Forgainst_it,2,Sat May 9 01:47:20 2015 UTC,"That just seems really sketchy.   This may seem wrong, but if it's located in one of the better to-do neighborhoods in west Ashley, I would guess it's a set up.

Charleston,358nbn,imagineskyscrapers,3,Fri May 8 00:51:20 2015 UTC,"Out of the main three that group owns Magnolia's is the only one I haven't eaten at regularly. From what I've experienced at the other two (Blossom and Cypress), however, I can't say that Raskin is definitely wrong. She does seem bitter, though, and I wonder if she might have an agenda other than just writing a review.  Cypress is good. It's not great, but good. I do think it is overpriced for what you get. The service has always been great for me and their burger nights are a great value. I enjoy Blossom more; they are the cheapest of the three and I rarely have difficulty getting a good seat at a good time. My wife and I only really go for a few of their dishes (calamari and she-crab soup, mostly) so that may also skew how we see the restaurant as a whole.  As to your question itself: there are a number of good southern cooking restaurants here. If you don't mind god-awful waits and the worst kind of humid heat...then Martha Lou's Kitchen is awesome. There are typically only two people working there at any one time and they switch off cooking duties so there is always a long, long wait to get your food. Service is slow but only because they gals working are so personable and talk to everyone. The food is usually bang-up. They have some of my favorite collards in town. One final word of warning: they pre-lemon their sweet tea. This came as a shock to me as there is no warning that they do so and I don't care for lemon in my tea.  Nigel's Good Food in North Charleston has been pretty good the two times that I've gone. They do a little twist on a lot of their dishes but it's still good. Their whiskey cream sauce is good; it could be utterly fantastic but they are very heavy-handed with salt. Even when I asked for very light salt it was very salty.  Virginia's has a good brunch in a Southern way. Not too fond of their dinner.  I used to like Jestine's Kitchen but what they did to their staff a few years ago has turned me away from them."
Charleston,358nbn,bythog,1 point,Fri May 8 14:55:30 2015 UTC,"Great post.  Interesting take on Raskin. I find her to have high standards and believe that she should in a foodie town such as Charleston. I think others avoid criticizing staples such as Magnolia's, but those places need it; they are charging a premium and sitting in the strip on Bay: they need to be excellent.  Martha Lou's is on my radar for sometime this month for lunch. And you have successfully convinced me to get Nigel's Good Food. Is it as good when you take out?  Virginia's and Jestine's was disappointing for me and unfortunately my experience was showing out of towners those restaurants. No wonder Virginia's is often empty for dinnertime.  I think Hominy deserves a mention. It's probably my favorite and you can't go wrong for any meal. Looking forward to their new chicken restaurant."
Charleston,358nbn,bythog,2,Fri May 8 15:38:57 2015 UTC,"I've only been to Nigel's twice and finished my meal both times. My wife had their fried chicken wings and said they were awesome. She's also had their peach Kool-Aid like drink and loved it.  I think I'm one of the minority that doesn't really care for Hominy. When I was a wee lad I remember the food being really good. The last 2 times I was there were in the past two years, and I didn't care for it. The food itself isn't bad, but it isn't deserving of the crazy high praise it gets. Their shrimp and grits is outrageously overpriced for how mediocre it is. Hominy feels and tastes like what a restaurant from up north would be, if they had no experience really cooking southern food and just got the first recipes they found on the internet."

If you are not local, pushed to the side. If you are over qualified, pushed to the side. It's very competitive, because everyone now wants to live/work here. My best advice is look up the qualifications for the position and hit some of those points in the cover letter.

I can't really say I understand all facets of these topics in Charleston, but I am willing to share and hope others will too.  I hope others with their unique perspective will share, but also be willing to identity their own background to show multiple sides of your question.  The biggest divide in Charleston I see is more economical and wealth driven.  The city is separated by that, it happens that divide also creates an apparent racial separation too [which is an even larger discussion].  With that said, I have found that Charleston is one of the more liberal cities in SC (for what that is worth), with only maybe Greenville surpassing us.  I am sure there are a plenty of jerks waving their confederate flags, but on a day to day, I don't really see that stuff.  It is much worse in the rural parts of the state (Walterboro, Bamburg, Allendale, Ridgeland) than in the cities.  Before you move here, you definitely need to come visit and see for yourself.

It's really a city divided between the haves (the majority of Mount Pleasant, Daniel and Sullivan's Islands, Isle of Palms, and certain parts of Summerville and downtown Charleston), the have-somes (West Ashley, Goose Creek, Hanahan), and the have-nots (North Charleston, the rest of downtown). As OP (of this comment thread) stated, economic divide strongly correlates with racial lines.  I'm Asian-American, and yes, people have talked shit to me, completely unprovoked. I also grew up in Alexandria, so I'm very familiar with the DMV. I will certainly say that racism is much more rampant here vs. back home; however, it happens everywhere.   Things are also still fresh from the Walter Scott shooting here. There is a decent-sized Hispanic population here; they tend to be concentrated in North Charleston and a good number of them work in landscaping or hospitality (to be fair we have a HUGE hospitality industry).  Just like anywhere else, there are no absolutes. The days of the confederate flag flyin', wife beater wearin', yeehaw redneck are dying, as younger, more educated peoples move-in or grow up here.

I hear SC as a whole is more on the conservative side.  What's the biggest industry down there? I've seen a ton of jobs listed for the field I'm currently in, and they all pay pretty well, but it looks like there are very few homes under 125k available (which is what we're looking for)."
Charleston,351y4v,Forgainst_it,7,Wed May 6 13:25:26 2015 UTC,"Hospitality is probably the biggest industry in Charleston.  I work in Higher Education which is pretty specialized, so I'm not real aware of the overall job market.  What work are you in?  I believe you will be able to find places to live with that, but it might have to be in Goose Creek, West Ashley, etc.  I lived in Goose Creek as a child and it has grown up quite a bit.  SC is pretty conservative, but that doesn't mean everyone is.  SC is one of the states being dragged into the current century, and many people want to make sure it happens.  This is the home of Stephen Colbert, and people who are LGBTQA are now able to get married, and at least we aren't Mississippi.   If you get a chance, check out Greenville too"
Charleston,351y4v,dirtynutsack,0,Wed May 6 14:22:25 2015 UTC,"Ah yes, rising against gay marriage is also a big put-off. Right now, I'm in a county in VA that is the home of the ""show me your papers"" law, which is odd because we have more Hispanics here than anywhere else in VA so obviously it didn't work LOL -- I digress. I can't deal with racial profiling and the bible thumpers and pure lily white conservatism. It's just not for me.  I'm in the legal industry - staff, not lawyer. My husband, however, is in the restaurant industry (cook) so he should be fine wherever we go. It's me I'm worried about."

Charleston,351y4v,sooncome,4,Sun May 10 03:23:31 2015 UTC,"but it looks like there are very few homes under 125k available (which is what we're looking for).     If that is your price range, you may not end up in an area that you like. The further you get from downtown, the cheaper the houses, but with that comes lower quality areas. There are some very ghetto areas around North Charleston.    The cities like Mount Pleasant and James Island (which are around downtown) are where most of the people live who have moved here from up north or wherever. Everyone is pretty laid back for the most part because everyone just stays on the beaches or rivers. Areas like North Charleston, Goose Creek, etc. (further away from downtown) are mostly inhabited by people who were born and raised there, so there isn't nearly as much diversity. The racism of which you speak is more likely to be found there as well.    Reading your comments ITT honestly doesn't make it seem like you would enjoy it here. Charleston loves its history, downtown is filled with churches, the people are generally conservative, and almost everyone has guns. The diversity comes from the people who moved here, not the people born here."
Charleston,351y4v,workpuppy,10,Thu May 7 03:05:48 2015 UTC,"First, let me put your mind at ease and say that there are lots of happy people here from all nationalities.  Second and maybe someone can shed some light on this, I have never fully understood the value in proactively seeking out (almost trying to force) diversity in terms of ethnicity or gender.  I was recently at a local conference celebrating equal opportunity (which I definitely value and understand) where the president of a relatively large organization presented her years long campaign to hire employees such that her organization (percent composition-wise) matched that of the surrounding tri-county area in terms of ethnicity and gender.  Everyone cheered, but I knew this organizations cost had risen significantly and couldn't help but think this was a possible waste of resources...  Anyway, just thought that since it is related to your home selection criteria, someone here might have some insight."
Charleston,351y4v,CKitch26,3,Wed May 6 14:13:44 2015 UTC,"Asian-American here and I can say that on the surface its racially tolerant. Behind closed doors, though, it seems as though the economic divide breeds a racial ignorance that's almost appalling. Its not necessarily confederate flags, but more like the old plantation owner mentality where being white and white-collared is the standard. Any deviation from these norms is almost considered peasant-like if you will. This is an excerpt of my friend's walking adventures in Charleston:  ""I swear, I wouldn't be so nervous if they weren't always hitting on me, and dressed in those big baggy clothes."" ""that's most black guys.""  Its an old-fashion city with an old fashioned culture and mentality. People are segregated by financial borders, but it spawns racial ones as well. The standard spring-colored suits of the elite rich have been replaced with salmon colored chubbies, boat shoes, and sunglass lanyards. It is what it is. You get starred at if you're different. If it were a culturally diverse area like New York or Florida, no one would bat an eye. Its not bad, but be prepared.  Please don't downvote me. lol. Also, originally from Florida."
Charleston,351y4v,castithan_plebe,5,Wed May 6 16:49:29 2015 UTC,"I'm also Asian and I've not encountered any form of intolerance or ""racial ignorance"". I was born here and have been in Charleston for at least a few weeks every year of my life (dad was Army, I moved a lot when younger).   Charleston is honestly one of the most tolerant cities I've lived in. Racism was much worse in North Carolina and SoCal. The part of Georgia I lived in was almost exclusively white so not much to speak of there.  A lot of racism is going to be found by your peer groups. Also, don't go out looking for racism; if you aren't scrutinizing every little word then you'll find much less."

Charleston,351y4v,burningsensation,-1,Wed May 6 17:59:52 2015 UTC,"Racism is there, but its usually only talked about behind closed doors or between drunk frat bros. Compared to DC, it is a much more racist and racially segregated place."

People think I look more Mediterranean/middle eastern than hispanic so that has helped me, sad how I had to word it that way. I have heard comments a lot against Hispanics. My husband is white and has had people talk negative about hispanics. I love charleston's history and architecture, I came here for school (Historic Preservation) but I am not very fond of the people here. There aren't many locals, keep that in mind. I'm originally from Los Angeles, born and raised and diversity has been a huge part of my life that is not here at all. People come and go, there are more whites than colored. And depending on the area more colored than whites. There is no in the middle. Cost is a lot cheaper of course. And i will point out that if you're not dressed well, you get googled at. I've had instances where I came home crying because I felt so out of place. I moved to Greenville first and I loved it there a lot more than here. It is growing a lot more and fast, though.

I know there are people in every city that probably think that way about one race or another, but if Charleston has that majority opinion.. not gonna work."

Charleston,351y4v,burningsensation,8,Wed May 6 14:10:55 2015 UTC,"That guy's about as full of shit as it gets.  Yes, there are people who are like that here.  But they are in the vast minority of people in the city and the area at large.  You're never going to escape idiots in the world, they exist.  You can elect not to associate with them, but we don't live in some enclave that time forgot.  I've lived in Montgomery, AL; small towns in Texas; rural and metropolitan areas in Virginia; Orlando, FL; and rural Georgia in my life.  I've experienced the gamut of good and utterly senseless when it comes to race relations.  Charleston's one of the most mellow cities in this regard that I've ever experienced.  I wouldn't have elected to live here as long as I have if it were any different."
Charleston,351y4v,tristamgreen,-1,Wed May 6 13:38:54 2015 UTC,I don't think he's full of shit. On the peninsula at least the prevailing white attitude is somewhere between racist and ambivalent. Maybe it's better in other areas like west Ashley.

Charleston,351y4v,tristamgreen,7,Wed May 6 13:49:29 2015 UTC,"Compared to Virginia Beach, which is where I lived...I mean I guess it is mostly comparable?  I lived near the Oceana NAS and I was in high school so of course I was somewhat more naive to the average goings-on of the world, but I never had a problem with anyone nor did I see problems between people in VAB when I lived there.  Now...compared to Montgomery or the town I lived in Georgia?  Hoo.  Charleston is a paradise.  Bottom line, and I cannot assert this enough - you're going to find jackholes anywhere you go in the world.  Racists, bigots, morons, they're going to be everywhere you look.  You cannot hide from them, but rather it's up to everyone individually to put and end to their bullshit by straight not tolerating it."
Charleston,351y4v,burningsensation,-5,Wed May 6 13:53:59 2015 UTC,"Here's some facts and one of my observations after living here for 3 years (and desperate to leave): SC has the highest rate of domestic abuse in the nation, the schools in downtown charleston are terrible unless you put them in a mostly white private school, and most people here, from bow tie dandy to dishwasher, adamantly refer to the civil war as ""the act of northern aggression."""

Charleston,351y4v,reversemermaid,-2,Wed May 6 14:14:50 2015 UTC,"Bunch of reasons, one of the main ones admittedly being newly far away from everyone I know and working with people much older than me. That feeling is amplified by my disgust for many aspects of the culture, however. How casually everyone takes the racism and classism. How low income housing is slowly being bought, torn down, and turned into high income, pushing the poor and nonwhite into the ghettos of north charleston to be policed by mostly white cops while a few miles away the children of millionaires sun themselves on folly without a care in the world. The rampant, stupid drinking all around downtown (and I went to a party school, too), and the thick headed stupidity I have encountered time and time again for 3 years. In a visit to NYC recently I saw more people reading there in a day than I have seen in my entire time here. I'm sure if you are from here an know the places and people it's easier to find the redeeming qualities, but as a transplanted northerner there's a whole lot of stupid and horror to sift through before you find the good bits."
Charleston,351y4v,burningsensation,9,Wed May 6 14:25:00 2015 UTC,"It's obvious you don't like Charleston, and that's fine, but it also doesn't sound like you've made any effort to move outside of your comfort zone. Charleston is one of the most culturally vibrant cities in the entire state, there is literally something for everyone. Art, dance, music, theatre, design, technology, food, sports, novelists, intellectuals, stoners, entrepreneurs, star wars cos-players, yogis, climbers, indie game developers, whatever you call the people who meet in hampton park every week and sword fight, permaculturists, makers, inventors, explorers, golfers, metaphysical believers, comedians, acapella groups, amateur astronomers, investors, board gamers, runners, arabic language and culture enthusiasts...   Any place you go is going to be what you make it. If you want to be miserable here, you're welcome to be, but the problem is your attitude, not Charleston. For every closet racist, there are 50 brilliant, funny, tolerant people, you just have to find them. If you're having a tough time finding them, PM me some stuff you're into and I'd be happy to introduce you to some like-minded people. Seriously."
Charleston,351y4v,reversemermaid,3,Wed May 6 15:08:28 2015 UTC,I'll keep this in mind...  I wonder if it's easy to make friends with other parents in Charleston. One of my biggest problems with DC is everyone is a SAHM (even if we could afford it I wouldn't want to do that though) so I have nothing to talk to them about...
Charleston,351y4v,tristamgreen,10,Wed May 6 14:50:15 2015 UTC,"most people here, from bow tie dandy to dishwasher, adamantly refer to the civil war as ""the act of northern aggression.""   I stand corrected.  This guy is as full of shit as it gets.  You need to stop basing your views of the area on what you've seen on Southern Charms."
Charleston,351y4v,burningsensation,-3,Wed May 6 14:24:01 2015 UTC,"That's the thing though, to some extent Southern Charms is charleston, at least when it comes to the movers and shakers. Someone above said that the town is divided into haves, have somes, and have nots. This being the genteel South, much of the haves who are those movers and/or shakers come from old money. I mean, Thomas Ravanel? The guy whose last name is literally one of the main bridges leading into town? How would you feel if the biggest douche on jersey shore owned you and the land you were on? If you're a ""have some"" who doesn't live downtown then you don't see the worst of it, but downtown the very rich and very poor (and black) are relatively close to each other, and living very different lives. Looking at it, it feels like not much has changed since segregation."
Charleston,351y4v,Catchyoul8r,5,Wed May 6 14:36:12 2015 UTC,I did some work with a camera guy from Southern Charm. I can tell you that it's 100% fabricated drama from a group egotistical out-of-touch spoiled kids. It is in no way reflective of Charleston (or even their true lives).

Charleston,34tk4a,PapaBrice,6,Mon May 4 13:15:18 2015 UTC,"Lol - great seats, and I don't doubt you got a foul ball.  But be careful - most foul balls right there are usually of the 100mph variety!  You definitely have to stay on your toes when sitting around there.    Played baseball for 15 years, love the game and love those seats...  But I also love my teeth, so I tend to sit a little further down the first base line."
Charleston,34tk4a,wisertime07,5,Mon May 4 13:59:23 2015 UTC,"Oh I didn't say how we got it, it definitely flew straight past my head at the speed you described.  It would have hit someone if they were behind us, but it hit the seat, bounced of that to hit my gf in the back, hit the seat behind her, then hit my hand.  We are ok, the chair took the worst.  I am definitely getting a glove though for next game."
Charleston,34tk4a,boydboyd,1 point,Mon May 4 14:18:35 2015 UTC,Every RiverDogs game that I have been to has had an instance of someone getting creamed in the face due to their inattentiveness combined with a foul ball.  The last one had to leave her seat for first aid.
Charleston,34tk4a,boydboyd,4,Mon May 4 15:41:26 2015 UTC,"I told my girlfriend before the game, that she would have to pay attention cause foul balls could happen.  She told me ""oh well you will catch it for me.""  I said if it was up in the air and slow yes, but she would have to look out for herself too.  She said I was being a jerk, then when it happened, she shut up about that and got what I was saying.  I'm glad neither of us got hit to the point of injury."
Charleston,34tk4a,almostahero,2,Mon May 4 15:53:34 2015 UTC,"I'm glad no one got hurt.  I take my daughters (13 and 10) to RiverDogs and Stingrays games when I can afford it. I always, always, always tell them that they need to pay special attention.  I don't want them to be adults and clueless and go with friends to a game and have their faces messed up for the rest of their lives because of not paying attention at a sports event."

Charleston,34slnq,OlfactoriusRex,7,Mon May 4 05:15:07 2015 UTC,"Living in Charleston is probably too far of a commute for work in or near Columbia. I had to do it for a few months and it's just under two hours … each way.  No bueno.   Either place will probably be a bit of a culture shock, depending on how long you've lived in AK. Charleston is booming at the moment; a look through this sub and general Internet research should give you an idea. I'm not as familiar with Columbia but my experience is that it has a bit more of a provincial atmosphere but also has a nice college-town vibe as well."
Charleston,34slnq,Maximus_Aurelius,3,Mon May 4 06:08:38 2015 UTC,"I live in Columbia for school but in Charleston over breaks. The commute between the two would be very long to do every day, though I had a professor that did it.   My experience in Columbia is mostly college centered, but I can say that the city has lots of fun things to do. You can find something to fit whatever your interests are, dancing, fishing, sports, whatever. The city seems very college oriented, but I'm also biased in saying that.   The housing situation is interesting. Because there are so many college students around places like apartments are very expensive. Example, I share an apartment with two other people and we all pay $600 per month, so $1800 total. This is at a middle tier apartment complex. Renting a house is much cheaper. I don't know anything about purchasing a house in Columbia.  The traffic is bearable. Its awful on football game days but that's only a few days out of the year. The roads are terrible, straight up. There are lots of trains.  The food in Columbia is delicious, plenty of places to choose from. Example, there are at least 4 bbq joints within a 5-10 minute drive. All are great and each with its own flavor, atmosphere, etc.  Let me know if you have any other questions about Columbia, I'll do my best to answer them."
Charleston,34slnq,ll_TopGunner_ll,2,Mon May 4 06:55:03 2015 UTC,Charleston is about 2 hours from Columbia so i don't see how it would work unless she has some sort of job where she is on duty for a few days and then off a few days.
Charleston,34slnq,Caadar,2,Mon May 4 06:06:06 2015 UTC,Piggy backing everyone else - The drive between Charleston and Columbia is not fun. I have alot of fans who live in Columbia and love it.  Definitely a college city with USC there.  [edit = spelling]
Charleston,34slnq,brasqo,2,Mon May 4 12:35:13 2015 UTC,"I would not suggest commuting. I-26 can be a nightmare. Do what we all do, live and work in Columbia and visit Charleston on the weekends.   Columbia is a great city. You can find almost anything you need/are interested in. It's not as booming culturally as Charleston, but decent variety of dining choices, a growing craft beer/spirits industry and with USC you've got tons of other educational/entertainment/sporting events some of which are free. While USC is in session traffic can be heavy. Mopeds everywhere and walking students who don't pay attention to cross walks. Football game days can be even worse, but it shouldn't be a problem unless you live near the stadium.  Once the semester is over it's pretty easy to zip around town, Columbia is a bit of sprawl so things can be spread out.  Quite a few media outlets located right in downtown Columbia. WIS, FOX, ABC.  Housing wise, I'm single and currently rent a 2br duplex in Shandon for $725/month. Other areas will vary, but that's about average from my research. You should be able to get a 3br house for $1500/month probably less."
Charleston,34slnq,the_silver_spaceship,2,Mon May 4 15:04:46 2015 UTC,"That commute would be too long. Orangeburg is about halfway between Columbia and Charleston and close to Congaree Park, but that's not a place I'd suggest moving to. I grew up in Columbia and can tell you that it's definitely improving from when I lived there. They've been adding better restaurants and bars recently, and just got a new music venue in town to fill the hole from when the last one closed. I think they took a note from both Charleston and Greenville and are trying to re-vitalize. It is a college town, but not exclusively. It's a capital city, too, so there's plenty of all types of people, young professionals included.   Cost of living in Columbia is cheaper than Charleston, too. So, that's definitely something to consider. I see my friends renting a decent 3-bedroom house for $1000/month there, while I rent a tiny, dingy 2-bedroom apartment here for $1200 here. I recently moved outside of downtown for a cheaper and bigger place, but now I have to deal with commuting and all that, which is a huge downside for me as I hate traffic.  I say move to Columbia and visit Charleston on the weekends when you can. Columbia might not be by the beach or have quite the number of high-caliber restaurants as Charleston, but it's decent and improving."
Charleston,34slnq,jiml78,2,Mon May 4 15:07:20 2015 UTC,"Here is my suggestion.  You can live in Jedburg, SC  It is about 40 from downtown Charleston.  Really close to Summerville, SC.    You would be about 1 hour from the Congaree Park side of Columbia.  That commute would not be terrible.   You would be able to buy a lot of house and land in the Jedburg area."
Charleston,34slnq,Forgainst_it,2,Mon May 4 16:05:06 2015 UTC,I-26 is brutal.  Don't commute from charleston.  The news market for the columbia station is the smallest in the state I believe.  My friends that worked for the news stations (3 of them) have all moved on because the market was small.

There also appears to be a reasonable number of retirees and families (hello!), so that's another bunch of Tricare eligibles. Fort Jackson also isn't too far away. This is also a Prime area with an MTF and no shortage of primary care options.  Couldn't find any more specific numbers unfortunately. Hope that helps."

Charleston,34jwxk,Chs2014,6,Fri May 1 20:46:41 2015 UTC,"I would say, very big. We have all branches covered either in the Charleston area, or surrounding areas (Beaufort..etc)."
Charleston,34jwxk,Chs2014,3,Fri May 1 20:30:48 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the input. Sometimes it's hard to tell how large a force is consistently present, because of all the civilian employees."
Charleston,34jwxk,angryundead,4,Fri May 1 20:47:29 2015 UTC,"Honestly there's so much, we have a VA hospital, Citadel Military College, SPAWAr...etc (We were actually a BIG target  from the USSR during the Cold War.)"
Charleston,34jwxk,DeltaOneCharlie,2,Fri May 1 20:52:55 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure how much of a potential customer count The Citadel provides. The ROTC (Military Science) instructors and their staffs are all active duty (so... say... 30) and portions of the administration and faculty are retired. Be generous and say there are some 100-150 people covered under that umbrella.  Then there are the active duty students. This would be the Navy's S2A (STA? Seaman to Admiral) program and the USMC's MECEP (Marine Enlisted Commissioning Program). I think that covers quite a few students. At least 60 if not more.  There are a few cadets, here, and there that are in the Reserves or National Guard. I think that figure is easy to find but I'm not sure that they would be eligible for whatever we're talking about.  Then there are cadets that have scholarships (commissioning contracts) with one of the armed services. I'm not sure how their healthcare is provided.  A note on SPAWAR: that's a ton of civilians. Some are retired military (of which there is no shortage in he greater Charleston area) but I'd just be aware of that fact.  Edit: as a major air mobility base, major port, and we had a submarine (?) base at the time, yeah the USSR would have had Charleston as a high priority target."

Charleston,34jxrp,belousugar,5,Fri May 1 20:10:36 2015 UTC,"I'm from the Boston-area, as well, though I found the drive to be closer to 17 hours.  Charleston, itself, is not that much cheaper than the northeast, though you don't have to go as far out of town to find cheap stuff. Of course, that puts you further away from the downtown goodies.  It's easy enough to make friends but you do have to go out. Do meetup.com or something if meeting strangers in bars isn't your thing.  Yes, lots of medical down here, will be nice to line up a job ahead of time. That said, I came down and took a year off (intentionally) before even starting to look for a job. If you have the means, go for it.  And it's not as Mass-liberal, but still pretty good and doesn't have a deep south feel (as it may have been portrayed to you.)"

Charleston,34jxrp,shakinghand,10,Sat May 2 02:41:01 2015 UTC,"Moved from Rochester, NY...  Yes, no more snow here and maybe a day or two of ice/sleet, and that's pretty much it. If you don't like humidity, this isn't the refuge you're looking for, however. It feels like a warm blanket to me after coming out of A/C all day, so I can appreciate it (or I'm at the beach and don't give a hoot about it because of the water).  More people should try something new and different. Good for you.  It's not necessarily a lower cost that is associated with the South. The average plate price downtown is over $25 and houses in the good areas can be expensive. Browse the housing and rental market over the internet. I know New England tends to be the worst, but still, it all depends on what you're used to and what you're looking for.  Isn't Boston near the ocean? Our beaches are much better because the water gets warmer, though. I remember driving out to Sunrise Beach in Marshland, MA just to see the beach there though.  Ages go all over the place here. I wouldn't say it's full of a younger demo because there are transplants and retirees mixed in.  Get a job before moving anywhere, period. The market isn't like that anymore, anywhere.  Friends will come naturally. If you are an ass, then it will be difficult.  Do not come here with strong beliefs and overtly spew them at people. It's pretty liberal here but people don't care what it was like in MA or the North, people don't care what you ""did back in"" your ""home state"". Come here ready to leave things behind. Be nice to everyone. There are plenty of transplants here that may sympathize with you, but they change as time goes on living here. People have complained after moving down here, but it's pretty obvious that they are one of the following:  A) Didn't do a LOT of research about the area before moving here B) Is an asshole C) Won't shut up about ""back North""  PS - All of the above I knew before I moved here. I cannot stress enough about research research research. Start regularly looking at the local news (P&C, Live5), immerse yourself in cultural texts, check out the wealth of threads here and citydata.com, and visit as much as you can. A weekend vacation is not the same as moving your life. Also, people have downvoted this because it's asked every day. Once and a while you'll get responses, but it's just weird that people don't do their research and see the wealth that's already out there. No need to apologize, just make sure to do your due diligence."

I'm confused now, are we talking about Baltimore or these teenagers? You keep ignoring this is about race as well. It's interesting you can only empathize because you are in a similar situation as a lot of poor blacks. But you don't seem to understand its not only about being poor, its about being black in America. The police don't care your social class they look at your skin and decide your a ""savage"" that needs to be institutionalized.   I can't comment on each of those teenagers lives but they were definitely affected by the police in some way. It's Charleston. Is this why they attacked random white people? Maybe, but I don't think so. Seems the instigators (the smaller group within actually attacking people) are actually just delinquents. Just like the rioters in Baltimore were a small part of the protestation taking advantage of a situation. Then you have a bystander effect of the other kids looking at the bad ones destroy stuff. The fact remains If the police came when they were supposed to less people would be hurt. That's what they are paid for."

I'm talking about this incident, the Baltimore incident, and any others of similar events with similar catalysts. Yes, it is partially about race, but by acknowledging that, it can be seen as legitimizing that race is important when we all know it shouldn't be. Frankly, I do believe it's more about money than race. The rioters think that the reason they're poor is because they're black, when in reality, it's simply because they were always poor. It's racism on they're part in perceiving actions as racist when the color of your skin isn't the only thing you can be judged by. The police judge everything about your appearance.

Race will always be important because for 400 years it was all that mattered. As such we've developed a black culture, sorry that is dependent on race. And how blacks feel is that it demeans the struggle our ancestors had to go through if we act like ""race"" doesn't exist. It sure as hell existed for them.   Frankly, I do believe it's more about money than race. The rioters think that the reason they're poor is because they're black, when in reality, it's simply because they were always poor.   And what is the reason they were always poor? Because they were black. Please research housing and job discrimination. Is your memory really so short that you forget this country was segregated for 100 years? There were very little career opportunities for blacks to move up and less now since you need a college degree to be lower middle class. Where the hell do you expect this money to materialize?    It's racism on they're part in perceiving actions as racist when the color of your skin isn't the only thing you can be judged by. The police judge everything about your appearance.

You don't see middle class and rich blacks out participating in rioting, they're at the peaceful protests, if anything.   Haha,  you really don't understand. The poor blacks don't even know why they are angry, just what they've experienced and that there is no hope for them.

Charleston,34ahj0,Elogotar,2,Wed Apr 29 20:38:43 2015 UTC,"I don't think all of your post is actually sarcasm and if I'm right, that /s is just going make it harder for people to understand what you're trying to say. Anyhow, I empathize with both sides of this dilemma. I may be white, but I'm in the same boat as most of the rioters probably are. I work retail, barely make enough to get by. Can't afford to get medical checkups, let alone see a dentist. I want to go back to school, but can't figure out how I'd be able to do so and still work two jobs when I can't afford to get a car. I feel like the world is holding me back and that the only way you can get ahead is if you're already there. I also don't trust the police. I've been treated quite badly in the past by some for no particular reason. I've seen all the videos and media coverage of crimes committed by people we trust to protect us. A part of me wants to go outside and rage about it as well. The thing is, you have to know that beating people and destroying things indiscriminately hurts innocents. If you hurt innocent people, you're no better than what you're raging against."

Charleston,347ss6,Bahahablast,2,Wed Apr 29 01:13:40 2015 UTC,"The thing is though, the completion of 526 is only going to ease traffic for a very short while. Very short.  As soon as the highway is completed the expansion and development of Johns Island will go into overdrive... as if it wasn't already going at a ridiculous pace, and note too that this kind of expansion could serve as the poster child for unfettered, no-oversight, urban sprawl. These neighborhoods all empty out onto single lane roads, River and Brownswood, Murraywood are all on a fast track to heavy traffic in the short term...two to three years or so.  Anyway....That's why the big-wigs that want the highway done want it, because they profit from the development. They'll say ANYTHING to get public support no matter how absurd or untrue. They own the land, or they are the developer or a contractor of some sort with a finger or more in it, looking for a profit.  Within just a couple of years, instead of single or dual lane gridlock it will be 4 lane gridlock.  Look at the bigger long term picture folks.  On the surface it sure looks like the thing to do but when you have a few more facts available, then not so much.  If you're an islander... go look at the townhouse sibdivisions popping up all over the island. They cram homes so tight together you can't ride a bicycle between them. It's a lot of people in a small area of land.  The cottages off of Maybank... the middle and low income housing on Brownswood at least two projects right now, maybe more, other new developments off of Murraywood, so on and so forth. They're all over and more in the works.  It's great for business for me... but ultimately, eventually it will cause me to have to move away. I just hope my property value goes up and not down."
Charleston,347ss6,SCphotog,2,Wed Apr 29 17:27:01 2015 UTC,"Based on the South Carolina Department of Transportation’s calculations, the project would save commuters less than 40 seconds, on average, from James Island and West Ashley, and about four and a half minutes from Johns Island.  WASTEFUL SPENDING"
Charleston,347ss6,Chs2014,8,Wed Apr 29 02:06:02 2015 UTC,"It's not about decreasing commute times, it's about alleviating gridlock and congestion. A single accident on 526 or 17 during rush hour shuts the city down currently.  I agree with your other comments, we would be best off investing in alternative transportation, but we should be clear about what the 526 completion is really about."

Charleston,347ss6,Chs2014,2,Wed Apr 29 01:49:03 2015 UTC,"Commuter Rail is 5-7 times more expensive...  Not saying it's not a good idea, just that it is a tougher nail to attack and a decade out."

Charleston,347ss6,Chs2014,2,Wed Apr 29 02:04:39 2015 UTC,"more than $300 million   So we don't disagree. Read between the lines.  Don't get me wrong, but this was also the same time period in which many believed that the railroad company on the west side of the neck would lend their tracks to commuter rail. This was before they said, HELL NO, citing the money they can make on commercial and industrial purposes far exceeds the benefits from commuter rail.   What needs to stop is the disguising of future development and a destruction of a ""view of the swamp"" as a re-allocation of funds towards something else. Future development is GOING to happen and it's not going to be stopped. Planned developments have already been approved on John's Island, on James near the Savannah Highway, and pending HUGE development off of Bee's Ferry. It will be a problem to evac in the future, mark my words. But I'm afraid that might be the case in multiple locations in the metro."

Charleston,3423fh,Bahahablast,4,Mon Apr 27 20:32:01 2015 UTC,"I live down the street from one of the popular food trucks in Charleston and it seems like more work than I expected. The guy has a food truck, two trailers, 3 or 4 fridges/freezers, 15 tanks of propane, a large grill that gets pulled behind the truck, and AT LEAST 20 large coolers. He is out in the truck and garage cleaning, prepping, and cooking most hours of the day and there is always a mountain of garbage on the street for pick-up.  That being said, I would try and get a partnership with a place that gets a high volume of traffic that does not serve food.    large businesses for the lunch breaks  a local brewery that doesn't serve food  the flea market in Ladson  a parking lot out on folly during the summer contact every event that comes to Charleston such as festivals, concerts, mud runs, car shows, 5ks, release parties etc   I assume the hardest part would be coordination and prep work. If you are setting up at a large concert, you would probably sell to 500 people (have no idea just a guess).  You would need to order your food weeks in advance, prep all the meals, and pack all supplies you would need during. Now imagine the coordination and prep work for taco Tuesday at a brewery, lunch break for Boeing on Wednesday, River dog game on Thursday, DMX concert on Friday, food truck rodeo at Marion square on Saturday, and Folly Beach on Sunday."

Charleston,3423fh,tidalrip,2,Tue Apr 28 12:56:12 2015 UTC,I went to the food truck festival a few months ago. If you could find the event page that will give you a good idea for what trucks/cuisines are established in this area. Which could help you find a niche market to cater to or something that fits your style.    I also know they swing by some of the tech companies downtown like Boomtown once a week. Good luck!
Charleston,3423fh,tidalrip,3,Tue Apr 28 05:24:58 2015 UTC,Agreed. OP needs to have a pretty original idea for the cuisine. There's a reason that ones like Roti Rolls have managed to stay around for so long. You gotta give people something they haven't seen before.

Yes it wouldn't be hard to spend $1M getting a restaurant open. Food trucks, however, are a great way to build reputation with relatively low up front cost. They can lead to brick and mortar down the road if successful.  Again, you're going to spend 80k up front on marketing, licensing, and insurance?  I did some estimates about starting a food truck a while back... the problem I ran into wasn't up front cost but having such a narrow margin on just keeping it going... either needing high volume sold or high cost per item."

Charleston,3420df,Catchyoul8r,3,Mon Apr 27 18:05:06 2015 UTC,Hey! To be honest it's pretty difficult to find a good crew compared to other cities. I'd say get involved with Chs Pride or the Charleston Blockade games/events. My partner and I are around the same age (27 & 26) and live downtown so feel free to PM me!

Charleston,33zaoe,ninjabrer,3,Mon Apr 27 01:14:31 2015 UTC,I've seen a few people bring hammocks to Marion Square. I didn't know they were banning hammocks :/
Charleston,33zaoe,Ruupasya,5,Mon Apr 27 03:20:46 2015 UTC,I think it's because people are hurting the trees with slacklining and hammocks on the battery. I hope they put in some poles or anchors to accommodate people who want to.
Charleston,33zaoe,Caadar,3,Mon Apr 27 06:37:19 2015 UTC,That would make sense. Why ban something awesome when providing the appropriate public accommodations would solve the problem?
Charleston,33zaoe,Ruupasya,4,Mon Apr 27 13:36:29 2015 UTC,"I'm not anti hammock, but can we not hang them from the Holocaust memorial?"
Charleston,33zaoe,Ruupasya,1 point,Mon Apr 27 13:46:21 2015 UTC,"I actually haven't seen anyone do that. What is the Holocaust memorial, anyways? What I've seen is the metal bars and fabric on the ground in the middle. When I first moved here, I thought maybe there had been something in the middle that had been temporarily taken away. Then I thought maybe the fabric were supposed to represent blankets covering the mass graves. Now I have no idea what it's supposed to be."
Charleston,33zaoe,fontinalis_kk,2,Mon Apr 27 13:59:52 2015 UTC,The fabric in the middle is a Tallit - a Jewish prayer shawl. I'm assuming the bars of the memorial represent the imprisonment of jews.
Charleston,33zaoe,Ruupasya,1 point,Mon Apr 27 15:18:27 2015 UTC,"That makes a lot of sense.  I kept coming next up with a lot of crazy theories for why it looks the way it does, like maybe the homeless people were sleeping in it. There should be a plaque to explain."

Charleston,33yvpq,vivadixiesubmarine,1 point,Sun Apr 26 23:04:16 2015 UTC,"Hey, downtown worker / inhabitant. Sort of a broad question and I'm drunk, so a very broad answer with more specific answers. Prepare for  Hotelception. We'll work on the title. Hotels / Hotel area -- If you are just looking to sleep somewhere without any bells or whistles, look at the days in on meeting street. About as dead center in the heart of downtown as you can get. There is a Holiday Inn on the marina or something and that is fairly downtown as well. If you have no $$ cap or want to treat yo' self, Vendue Inn, any b&b downtown, Market Pavilion Hotel, Zero George, King Street Inn, etc etc. There are no hotels near the bad part of town, save the Meeting Street Holiday Inn (i think it's a holiday inn, corner of meeting street and woolfe). If it's Air B&B, PM me because it's extremely situational. It's a small city. Downtown you can walk anywhere. Even North Charleston is far away and generally undesirable to vacation in. Hope this helped."

Charleston,33v52o,Underwaterpeanuts,6,Sat Apr 25 22:45:45 2015 UTC,"I'm not aware of any rules regarding hookahs on the beach, but drinking will get you a hefty fine.   As for crabs, if you're streaming your own crabs, there are plenty of places like Marvin's, Crosby's etc... Restaurants to eat steamed crabs in are a little trickier. Crab is not the most popular of restaurant seafoods in Charleston. There's the Charleston Crab House which I think is bleh. You can take a ride down 17 and get steamed blue crabs at Ravenel Seafood, but don't expect fine dining. Expect country and crabby. Charleston is more  known for shrimp (whose season should be just opening in a few weeks) oysters (whose season should be just closing in a few weeks) and extremely fresh fish - especially from the snapper/grouper complex. Bowens Island is a great place for shrimp and oysters, anywhere downtown is great for the fishes. Cheers!"
Charleston,33v52o,Jinkiees,1 point,Sat Apr 25 23:59:25 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice! If crab is not one of the most popular choices of food, what is? And what places would you suggest"
Charleston,33v52o,MrDickford,7,Sun Apr 26 01:32:13 2015 UTC,"I'm going to jump in to emphasize Bowens Island. That's where I bring anybody who's not familiar with the area. You can get a a good sampling of Charleston seafood, including a shrimp boil or a tray piled high with oysters, while having a beer overlooking a beautiful view of Folly Island and the surrounding creeks. If you're downtown I'd suggest Amen Street for your seafood needs, but I will always recommend Bowen's Island to anybody and everybody traveling to Charleston."
Charleston,33v52o,Migz968,6,Sun Apr 26 02:13:10 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately you are kind of in between seasons for the best (in my opinion) Charleston staples. It's too late for the great oysters and too early for shrimp and blue crabs.   Maybe go to one of the many seafood companies around Shem Creek in Mount Pleasant (or any local seafood market) and ask what's fresh and local.  As for beach rules (and I'm only an expert on Isle of Palms), so long that is just tobacco, there are no rules prohibiting hookah from being smoked on the beach"
Charleston,33v52o,imagineskyscrapers,3,Sun Apr 26 01:58:19 2015 UTC,"FYI Shem creek restaurants serve frozen seafood, not local. They all know this and admit it to one another but hide it from outsiders.  You probably already know this, just stating for the record."

Server pay is $2.13/hour but paychecks pretty much always go to taxes, so you'll essentially live off of tips alone.

Charleston,33r77w,whatyouwere,1 point,Sat Apr 25 18:12:00 2015 UTC,You'd be amazed at how many venues they tried to secure. All the ones they had in the past are no longer options. Every time they'd get close to a great new option something would throw a wrench in the works at contract time. The goal is for this one to get the ball rolling again and get back to the scale and impact the event had 4 years ago!

Charleston,33oyvk,tybaltknight,7,Fri Apr 24 08:59:32 2015 UTC,"I am one of 22 veterans who has spent the last week paddling from Columbia to Charleston, to raise awareness for PTSD and veteran suicide. We reached the harbor yesterday and overnighted on the USS Yorktown at Patriots' Point. This morning we cross the harbor, & circle the peninsula. We'll end our journey slightly after noon, using the incoming tide to help us push up the Ashley to the Citadel boathouse. After a welcome and lunch, we will be their guests for this semester's final Friday parade.  As you probably could guess, there's 22 of us to represent the 22 brothers and sisters in arms we lose to suicide daily. In the course of the past week, it's been staggering to find out that every single one of our group -ranging from Vietnam-era through still-serving OIF/OEF/OND vets- has struggled with isolation and thoughts of self-harm. One of our guys survived an attempt just a few weeks before joining us on this trip. If our hard work causes even just one veteran to put down the gun and pick up a phone, it will have been a complete success to me.  This trip is also intensely personal for me. I was born here and grew up along the Cooper and in lakes Marion and Moultrie. The day I returned from two tours of convoy security duty in Iraq, I drove from Ft. Bragg, got off I-95 in Santee, took off my boots and put my feet in the lake, then had lunch at Lone Star.   I fought my first battles with PTSD here in Charleston. Had to break up with a girl living in an apartment over King Street because the sound of diesel delivery trucks all night caused terrible nightmares and flashbacks. I finally had to leave town completely because there was never not an excuse to drink, and the drinking was making my PTSD so very much worse.  I live in Columbia now, so this trip was a no-brainier for me. I've enjoyed every step of the way, from the send-off under the Gervais Street bridge to the quiet at Santee State Park, the history at Strawberry Landing and Chapel, and the wonderful folks cheering from the deck of the Yorktown as we pulled in yesterday. I felt like coming back here, like this, was a final way to say ""Fuck you!"" to the Post-Traumatic Stress that ate a decade of my life and caused me to need to leave this gorgeous city like a thief in the night. I'm glad to be back, more so that I'm returning on my terms and bringing an entire flotilla of my brothers in arms with me.  If you're downtown, you'll probably catch a glimpse of us as we paddle around the peninsula this morning. You might also catch some of us celebrating tonight. There's talk of a downtown bar crawl. I'm too old for that mess. I'll just go have supper with my parents, who still live in Summerville."

You've accomplished so much.  First, my father is a vet.  I personally know of the struggles. Second, I lived in Columbia for eons and paddled the Saluda, Broad and Congaree quite often. I never did, but wanted so much to paddle the Blue River Trail (which obviously you just did) and spend a couple of nights on those river banks.  As I'll be traveling over the bridge a couple of times today ....I'll keep an eye out; honk my ass off should I catch you guys out there. Once again, congrats, and let's grab that brew!"

I'd stay away from the flea market honestly. If you do end up going there, don't go in the flea market to find good games. Most of the vendors inside know the value and you won't find anything good. If you're not concerned about prices find the vendor booth named Castle Keep, I believe. Stick to the outside and you'll find some good stuff.   Only places I know that sell what you are looking are in Columbia. If you want, you can look through my submitted and find my post detailing video game stores in S.C. I need to update it soon.

The parking lot is a joke, everytime it rains it turns into pot hole city, there is dog shit everywhere, people leave their trash out over the weekend and attracts bugs. Lots of smokers when it is a non-smoking community (Woudn't really bother me if people had the courtesy to walk away from the buildings which a majority do, but i have a hard time leaving my windows open on nice days as people right below me love to smoke right up on the building trying to be sneaky).

I think they host a semi-regular night at Frothy Bread, though I've never been. Supposedly the owner is pro-gamer so you might be able to bring your own and play even outside of the established game nights.   The other events they do are typically at a local library or cafe.

Sometimes you'll see bigger shows played at the North Charleston Colosseum but I definitely prefer seeing shows at family circle cup if I have the option. It's a tennis stadium so it's a lot smaller. It's pretty much impossible to find a bad seat there.   Other smaller venues like Music Farm, Windjammer, and Charleston Pour House are also great places to see shows. You can catch bands that are up-and-coming or some of your favorite artists from back in the day. There are a lot of additional bars around town besides these three that also have live music during the weekends.   We also have the occasional music festival. Last week was Spring Jam in Mount Pleasant and every year we have the Southern Ground Music Festival which is a lot of fun too.   One of my friends writes a music blog which contains some information you may find useful: Disco Teepee. She's much more knowledgeable about the local music scene than I am.

Charleston,33ca3g,Al_Grain,4,Tue Apr 21 20:13:31 2015 UTC,"As a property owner in the neighborhood behind that old K-Mart,  I naturally have an opinion on this and have been closely watching the development take place.  I've never seen a notice inviting the community to take place in planning/zoning discussions.  I regularly watch people test drive vehicles down my residential street while kids play, dogs wander and homeowners walk.  I also enjoy the sweet sound of test drivers flooring it on the open stretch of Wappoo Road between Capri Isle and Edgewater Park while the rest of the community tries to enjoy a peaceful evening of fishing/crabbing from the Wappoo Creek bridge.  My neighborhood is the alternative to test driving a car on traffic-beleaguered Savannah Highway and the volume of test drive traffic is increasing.  I didn't know about the Honda dealership moving to that space across 17 from the Mini dealer as the article references, but was under the impression the new building on the corner of Markfield and 17 (between IHOP and the former Black Bean) is a Kia dealer.  Of course all of these are Hendrick.  The old KMart building is going to be the service/repair center for many of Hendrick Dealers.  I had heard a rumor of a portion of the space being made into a test driving track to keep customers off traffic-swamped 17.  Guess that's not true if they're going to park a Honda lot there.  Thoughts:   I hate to say it, but these new dealerships are probably going to be an improvement over the K-Mart and its underutilized paved space.  That place was rough! I had hoped, dreamed, wished and prayed for Trader Joes, mixed use commercial development or something to contribute to the community, but yet again West Ashley's main thoroughfare is relegated to giant sales lots. West Ashley's highway 17 is in the current traffic crunch that Mt. Pleasant's highway 17 was enduring a decade ago, and we're not seeing any plans to rectify that like Mt. Pleasant has.   You kids stay off my lawn!"
Charleston,33ca3g,NevEP,2,Tue Apr 21 17:00:47 2015 UTC,"Might be on the Kia dealership, I think I was confused on where the Mini dealership was going.  Never saw a zoning change sign either but it's possible they did not need one to do what they wanted to do.    The mixed use idea would've been great and is what I was poorly alluding to as doing something more interesting with the site.  Oh well.  Hendrick is at least a strong business and will keep that spot occupied and in much better condition than Kmart ever did.  The what could've been is tough though.    Good luck with the traffic, any chance you guys have speed bumps in your neighborhood?"
Charleston,33ca3g,aintitso,1 point,Tue Apr 21 20:44:11 2015 UTC,"The zoning was GB, same as Kmart or any other general business in the area.

Charleston,339xq5,rudderrudder,1 point,Mon Apr 20 23:29:44 2015 UTC,Is Brian Hicks writing a ponderous 2 pages worth of material to make a point that can be made in a few sentences a mistake?
Charleston,339xq5,imagineskyscrapers,7,Tue Apr 21 00:10:04 2015 UTC,"No, fair enough - it's not. But it is something a good editor could help fix.   I know that I'm judging them on a curve but I think that's reasonable. It's a dying industry in a small town. If they can't get credit for winning a Pulitzer Prize then they never will."

Charleston,339xq5,HangerSteak,-1,Tue Apr 21 01:19:43 2015 UTC,"I'm aware, but it speaks to the entirety of the paper itself. Anyone who has read more than a few articles from it knows what I'm talking about. Just because their editing team paid closer attention than usual for a media hyped up story, doesn't detract.  Now I did read the series when it was published, but I just couldn't get past the thought that it was taking advantage of the media blitz. It would have been so much more respectable to see it before any celebrities were caught.  But alas, what other options do we have for local print and hard hitting news?  What I do challenge others to do though, is get their news stories in RSS feed. See what happens is when an article is published, but completely unfounded and ridiculous, and it gets pulled from the website. But RSS feeds hold it and you can see the paper in all its glory.  I do utterly respect them avoiding becoming another branded USA Today feeder, like all the rest, though.  Can't beat Raskin though. She's a pro."

Charleston,3315fx,yeasthomebrew,6,Mon Apr 20 15:33:52 2015 UTC,"Perhaps they could educate on how to safely use the hammocks and lines in a way that won't damage the trees instead.    I'd hate to have a flat ban, because while I don't personally use these items myself, I love that the park is alive with people using them.   Before I saw these popping up in that area, it was just a place for tourists to walk awkwardly through.  Now it feels like one of the only green-spaces in the city that can be accessed and used by everyone."
Charleston,3315fx,StabbyKaji,2,Sat Apr 18 15:22:29 2015 UTC,"I agree with you. I can see where they're coming from with the ban, especially when I see people using the thin ropes to hang their stuff. Wider webbing is less destructive and an educational program would be better. If that didn't work and the damage was clearly occurring, then a ban might be appropriate. But, it's not necessarily a great first move.   The addition of dedicated poles might be a nice addition of they can be done in a way that fits in aesthetically."
Charleston,3315fx,Caadar,4,Sat Apr 18 15:48:44 2015 UTC,"Personally, as a hammock owner, I have mixed feelings about this. On one hand, hammocks are great for relaxing and if used properly aren't likely to damage any trees. On the other hand, I see people hanging these things off of some very old tree limbs, and often they're not even using the wider webbing straps to protect the bark."
Charleston,3315fx,tisokan,3,Sat Apr 18 14:40:33 2015 UTC,"Just set up poles for hammocks and slacklines and save the trees. Like the article says they have a slackline park at James Island county park.

Charleston,331rft,dagrami,3,Mon Apr 20 17:35:48 2015 UTC,"If you want a great water view, but you can settle for not fantastic but pretty good food, I'd suggest Fleet Landing. As someone who lived in Charleston for a while (and still comes here for work), I wasn't overly impressed, but I took some out-of-town friends there and they loved it, mostly for the view. You literally sit right out over the water. I think they take reservations, and I would highly suggest making one. If you just walk in there on a Friday or Saturday, you'll be waiting for a couple hours.   Bowen's Island has great views, but it's basically fried seafood on paper plates. It's damn good, but people either love it, or feel like they've been ripped off.   Shem Creek, like you said, has some good views. Never been to the restaurant you mentioned. I have been to Water's Edge, which I'd give a 7/10 for food. Don't bother with Red's. Shit food and shit service.   I went to The Boathouse on the Isle of Palms quite a few years ago, and I remember it being pretty good. But google rates it as a 3.4/5 so, eh. You also aren't guaranteed a great view there.   Damn, all this restaurant talk is making me miss living in Charleston."

Water's Edge is a TERRIBLE value for average food. Red's is a good daytime lunch stop. Shem Creek Bar & Grille is another bad value for dinner and the food is below average.  I like Bowens Island, but as dagrami said, it is literally fried seafood on paper plates. The food is good, and it has a waterfront view, but the setup is not going to blow your mind.  I like Fleet Landing. Cool atmosphere, good food, on the water.  Hank's downtown has amazing seafood, but there isn't a waterfront view.  The Fish House in Mount Pleasant has what you're looking for but I've heard mixed reviews. Might want to research that a little bit.  Sullivan's on Sullivan's Island has great seafood but you're a block away from the water."

Charleston,32y0br,brasqo,3,Fri Apr 17 20:47:03 2015 UTC,You'll never see Google Fiber downtown due to maintaining historical integrity.  Unless they're able to establish the infrastructure without disturbing anything.  There's no way comcast/time warner will allow them to just march in and utilize their trenches...  Price of living in a historical city I guess.   I'd love it here though.
Charleston,32y0br,Caadar,1 point,Sat Apr 18 00:55:27 2015 UTC,This was going to be my response to this. Google fiber isn't going to go to downtown Charleston because of the costs of sticking to historical standards.
Charleston,32y0br,PapaBrice,2,Mon Apr 20 08:22:03 2015 UTC,Here read up:  https://fiber.google.com/newcities/  I imagine we won't get it because of the existing infrastructure and age in charleston.  I could see a lot of fuss being made about it even though the benefits of fast internet would be amazing.
Charleston,32y0br,LazyGirlGamer,5,Fri Apr 17 18:01:26 2015 UTC,I can see that being a problem too. It's a shame. Google Fiber would motivate me to move out of Summerville and into Charleston honestly.   I'm waiting for Nexton to build houses and hear reviews of Home Telecom there.

Charleston,32v663,jiml78,1 point,Fri Apr 17 18:40:24 2015 UTC,So I can comment on Tri-county roofing.  I had a leak around my chimney that one roofing company failed to fix.  A handyman (no fault of his own because he said it wasn't his expertise) couldn't fix.  Tri-county came out and ripped everything down and fixed the root cause which was a bad flashing job done by previous roofing company.
Charleston,32v663,HeatherSolos,1 point,Fri Apr 17 15:03:08 2015 UTC,That's the same issue I have. It is the flashing around the vent on the roof. The builder did a crappy job of installing them and it will now cost me$700 to fix. The flashings are easy to install if the roof itself wasn't damaged.
Charleston,32v663,HeatherSolos,1 point,Fri Apr 17 15:12:34 2015 UTC,"Yep, cost me about $800.  They did a tear down of about 5-6 feet all the way around the chimney (including siding) and redid everything.  Took one guy all day to get done.  But hasn't leaked since."

I can't remember the name of his company half the time though.  Have you thought about peaking into Home Depot and Lowes as well? In the least you could ask the pro-desk or front end of either and get set up for one of their contractors to come out and take a peak as well for no/little charge.

Charleston,32owlq,philbob84,3,Wed Apr 15 15:07:35 2015 UTC,"Can someone help me understand why there is even a vote?  Is there some federal or state law that says every year they must vote on becoming a union if the NLRB petitions for it? Does it require a majority of super-majority vote to become a union? Can you abstain from voting, and if if so does it count as a total in the majority calculations?"
Charleston,32owlq,scottymtp,2,Thu Apr 16 11:46:19 2015 UTC,"To petition the NLRB to hold a vote, a certain percentage of the group that would form the possible union must sign and submit a card asking for a vote to be held. I believe this is around 30% or so. You cannot abstain, only yes/no votes count. The decision is based solely on the total vote count, not the absolute size of the group. If only 3 people voted, and 2 voted ""Yes"" and 1 voted ""No"", this would form a union that would represent all ~2500 people. All you need is 50.1% of the people who voted to say yes to form a union.  This is done to discourage either side from screwing with the legitimacy of the vote itself. It's being held at a well advertised time(s) and place(s), and Boeing has spent a ton of effort/money on a ""Let Your Voice Be Heard - Vote No"" campaign.  tl:dr - The NRLB called a vote because enough Boeing SC mechanics asked for them to, you only need a simple majority to form/not form the union, and abstaining does nothing - only yes/no votes are factored into the final decision."

Charleston,32owlq,electr0fryin,3,Sat Apr 18 00:43:10 2015 UTC,"Huge exaggeration on their part.  For the last year, they've been consistently visiting people's homes and then all of the sudden, they get threatened at gunpoint 5 days before the election?  It's a pathetic excuse.  They need to produce the police report if this is true."
Charleston,32owlq,Karadion,1 point,Sat Apr 18 05:38:50 2015 UTC,I've heard rumors of that but never anyone that directly got visited. They only would have had addresses from either prior Vought employees or referrals. The petition with the NLRB gave them a full list of those eligible to vote who currently work there and their addresses. That was probably the primary reason behind the petition in the first place.
Charleston,32owlq,electr0fryin,2,Sat Apr 18 13:11:33 2015 UTC,I talked to Wren from the P&C and he stated that the IAM would not release the police report.  The supposed incident was in Moncks Corner.  The police won't release the police report because Wren stated that they are not really cooperative with the media given Berkeley County's habit as of late.
Charleston,32owlq,Karadion,1 point,Sun Apr 19 00:34:04 2015 UTC,"Property Information are public.  The IAM been here for a year off Dorchester Road and they were working off pro-union employees' information.  Plus the forum that Boeing uses is pretty easy to use which you specify the job classification and code.  It can give you a dump of the ENTIRE list of all the workers associated with their job code and worker location.  From there, you have to do property searches on them.  The IAM brought in 150 employees and volunteers to start visiting worker's home in the last two weeks when they got the ""Excelsior List"".  One worker I've already talked to had been visited 8 times.  Most workers in general already had 3-4 visits even if they were told ""No"".  The whole idea behind it to gauge worker's approval and the approval responses were low.  Assuming they're doing 2 people teams working 14 hours a day for 14 days at a rate of 1 home per hour per team,  you can make up to 14000 visits in two weeks.  There's nothing illegal about the reason why they're withdrawing the vote.  I've already asked Wren and Segrist to find out if the IAM did file a police report.  If they haven't, then their story is BS."
Charleston,32owlq,Karadion,1 point,Sat Apr 18 20:51:56 2015 UTC,"I guess that makes sense. If you know employees at boeing, it's pretty easy to find the tax records and thus their address. Never thought of that. Thanks for the info."
Charleston,32owlq,electr0fryin,3,Sun Apr 19 00:49:10 2015 UTC,I have worked at a union plant for close to 5 years now. If there is a union there you do not have to contribute. You can be as active or inactive as you want. But the truth is they fight for fair wages and reasonable hours. If anyone is wondering i pay about 88 a month to the union and i make 27 or so an hour.
Charleston,32owlq,oystersyoufuck,3,Wed Apr 15 23:48:16 2015 UTC,However that's one side of the coin.  The other side of the coin is that the union determines what your wages and benefits are going to be including any job arraignments even if you're not represented by them.  The employer cannot bargain individually with a worker who is not represented as they are required by law to only negotiate with the bargaining unit.  Got a management problem?  Union.  Want a salary increase?  Union.  Want.... Union.
Charleston,32owlq,Karadion,3,Fri Apr 17 04:13:50 2015 UTC,Yeah i agree. It is limiting. I just wanted to get my piece out there. Seems to me that in sc at least the union is looked at negatively.

Charleston,32lqjy,bpwnz,6,Tue Apr 14 20:20:24 2015 UTC,"Good advice, thanks.  I've got the kettle in which we'll melt the aluminum, but lifting it out of the kiln area and then pouring it into an ant hill will take at least 2 people to maintain a safe distance from the liquid metal.  I've melted aluminum and brass before, but nothing quite this big (10+ pounds). I'm not sure how long it will take, could be a couple hours to heat up and melt down the cans. The pour will go pretty fast, and then we'll wait a while for the cast to cool before digging up the sculpture, maybe half an hour.  I figured there might be another person or two interested in seeing how the process works. I'm very concerned about safety; we'll do a couple dry runs first, and won't do anything that puts you or myself in danger."

Charleston,32hrxr,og_the_so,1 point,Tue Apr 14 03:17:00 2015 UTC,Awesome. How did you guys do? I was competing for the citadel. We spent 2 hours trying to properly configure our asa which caused our systems to be down at the start for a long time. But our system was up for awhile while everyone else was down because our asa was blocking a lot of inbound traffic...but it wasn't enough to come back....oh well haha
Charleston,32hrxr,the_brizzler,1 point,Tue Apr 14 03:28:06 2015 UTC,"We were told that by 1:30 we were in the 3rd position. But after the nuked everyone's ASA with the ANY:ANY rule we fell behind on services and injects due to lack of knowledge and came out at 6th.  Up one spot from last year and I was told we beat the Citadel, I think I heard yall came in either last or 7th. It was a tough competition. Our whole team, except for me and our team lead, were 1st or 2nd semester students. So we are happy all in all.  Everyone did great nonetheless."
Charleston,32hrxr,og_the_so,1 point,Tue Apr 14 03:37:12 2015 UTC,Yea that bomb took everyone down pretty hard.  Yea we did terrible.  The guy on our team who was suppose to be the ASA guy had to take our systems down for nearly 2 hours in order to stand the system back up.  The guys unplugged a bunch of cables and couldn't figure out how to reconfigure everything so we had to make a deal with the red team to stand our system back up...once they did that we were doing pretty well...but we were so far behind at that point it was pointless. That is pretty good for 1st and 2nd semester students.  A lot of that stuff requires pretty advanced knowledge to be effective...plus those systems have so many holes in them that they set you up for failure.  I'm the only guy on our team that isn't doing a cyber security minor...I am more of a software engineer and build mobile apps...but know a little bit when it comes to security.  Offense is definitely more fun!  Good job at the competition.

Second, their VERY FIRST words are ""The time is now"". Third, they claim to be living in apartheid and talking about ""fighting back""  2) This is probably the dumbest place to protest at  3) This is definitely not the best way to go about doing it"

Charleston,32h586,zeeginganinja,10,Mon Apr 13 19:34:35 2015 UTC,Exactly. I'm sure it was met with a giant eye roll and everyone just went back to sipping their $9 mimosas.

Charleston,32h586,doctorcrass,9,Mon Apr 13 23:31:51 2015 UTC,"What exactly is the goal here? Yelling semi coherent angry slogans at people at a restaurant. In the ideal outcome thought up by the protestors what did the restaurant full of people take away from this demonstration?  During the civil rights movement, something like a sit in made sense. If black people were denied the right to dine somewhere they protest by dining there anyway. That sends a clear message. Yelling at a mixture of random charleston residents and tourists at a restaurant and then leaving kind of makes no sense.  Maybe they should bring signs and such to a police station?"

Charleston,32g1ox,scottymtp,6,Mon Apr 13 14:36:07 2015 UTC,The Citadel has an on campus Tailor Shop that is open to Civilians. They are very good at what they do and could probably turn your suit around in a short amount of time. Just call them up and ask.
Charleston,32g1ox,XectriK,2,Mon Apr 13 16:02:12 2015 UTC,"I'll second this. I've never used it since graduation but for all I know they're the biggest shop in Charleston. Consider that they tailor new uniforms for over 700 new cadets, in 3-4 style as, every year.  It also might be a busy time of year though. People needing uniforms fixed up or resized for graduation in a few weeks.  Worth a shot."
Charleston,32g1ox,angryundead,3,Mon Apr 13 16:23:55 2015 UTC,I'd call M. Dumas or even Men's Warehouse and explain your situation. They both have in-house tailors that are free for suits you buy from them.

I bought one at Belk in Mount Pleasant and took it to the place listed below, Hemline Alterations.  I told the lady who owns it my situation and told her I would pay her additional to have it done in 48 hours.  She came through for me and really didn't charge that much to alter the entire suit.

Try to look for College of Charleston subleases. It's a lot easier to go out downtown when you live there, and your roommates may either connect you with people or want to hang out with you.

Charleston,32c5gb,DJBunBun,1 point,Tue Apr 14 07:20:21 2015 UTC,I would check Craigslist for subleasers in the downtown area. I've found it best to live downtown or at least close to it in Mt.pleasant or West Ashley. You may end up with cool roommates. There are soccer and tennis clubs you could join. Go to Charleston social club and try to sign onto a kickball team or other sport as a free agent.

Charleston,32e476,redhistorian,4,Mon Apr 13 01:11:56 2015 UTC,Your options would probably to bus tables at a restaurant and work your way up. Unless you know someone it is unlikely they will pay you to learn to be an electrian . Charleston is a popular city and jobs can be difficult to come by especially down town. In the city a one bedroom will run you 700$ to 1200$. Their is a party scene here so if you are looking to grow up it also might not be the best place. Not trying to be negative but just trying to be honest. Best of luck what ever you decide.
Charleston,32e476,taytay9955,1 point,Mon Apr 13 01:50:19 2015 UTC,Thanks for the help!
Charleston,32e476,bearsick,5,Mon Apr 13 04:35:54 2015 UTC,"Charleston is just not the kind of place you can move to and expect to find a job. If you have not been extended a job offer in Charleston do not come here unless you are willing to start in the restaurant service industry. Jobs here do not pay fairly. Rent is overpriced and the infrastructure is completely backward for the size of the city.   I make 13$ an hour and that is enough for me to live. However I am worth at least 25$ an hour given my skill level and experience and for that reason I am leaving the city and changing careers.  Literally anywhere else in the state is a better bet for a tradesman of no skill level. Try around Charlotte, the metro area, Greenville, anywhere in the Upstate for a better lifestyle."

Charleston,32e476,bpwnz,5,Mon Apr 13 04:43:05 2015 UTC,"In SC I think cost of living is cheaper away from cities. Charleston is the perfect storm of tourist town, limited space, and high taxes that makes it very difficult to live comfortably without a good paying job. Moving here with nothing to market yourself and no job plan would be a mistake."
Charleston,32e476,atzenkatzen,2,Mon Apr 13 10:58:08 2015 UTC,You'd want to find a job then move. Charleston can be an expensive place with lots of competition for good jobs.  Maybe checkout Santee Cooper's programs and see if there's something for you. https://www.santeecooper.com/careers/programs-internships/index.aspx  It's a solid hour outside of downtown but the area is home to many industrial parks and larger companies. You might have luck looking around online for entry level openings.

I've noticed that in EVERY article I've read on every site goes out of their way to say the WHITE officer that shot the BLACK man. Reducing the victim to nothing more than his race is dishonoring him and accomplishing nothing. Bah!

The NAACP wants more transparency, and the protestors want to end police brutality.  Not all of NCPD officers are CPR certified, and reports are showing that no CPR was done on the victim.  Since the Ravenel Bridge has over 76k cars crossing a day, it's the perfect place for media attention. I just hope things don't get out of hand like people burning Ladson and parts of North Charleston.  It's a white on black crime so expect the usual jokers to keep stirring the pot.

Edit: I guess I'll just have to expand on this since I'm noting a consistency in your comments about this incident. I'll just start off with the fact that you are either ignorant or willfully denying that other people experience the world in a different way than you. That's okay, there's plenty of reason for that. You have never experienced genuine prejudice in your entire life, neither have I; but I know what it looks like.   I listen to when people tell me about it. I can see the shock on people's faces when I was ordered out of my car off Line street, at midnight, surrounded by six cops and milky-white military me stood in front of the cruiser and told the cops to fuck off. If I was anyone else I'd be in jail, or dead, for the last three years.   You likely believe that we all live in the same world and get treated the same as everyone else. This is absolutely not true. We do not live in the same world and just have mistaken perceptions. We live in our own worlds, directed by many things such as upbringing, gender, and race; these things affect what we do and how our words and actions are taken by others."

Go spread out on Ashley Phosphate or something.   Second, this would make sense if the cop was simply ""being investigated"" or something. But he is being punished for what he did. Why protest this? You're not going to get him double punished. You're not going to bring Walter Scott back.   And you do bring him back, he'll just be a zombie. You're just going to have to put him back down.

The road out to it from 17 (bennett's point rd.) is a pretty drive with some DNR controlled properties on either side that are free to stop in and walk around.  Then there's the entire francis marion national forest to the north of mount pleasant. If you stay off 41 and 402 you're officially in the sticks. The forest has far less to see because it's mostly federally protected pine trees and swamps, but it's quite tranquil.

Charleston,31vfsd,bpwnz,10,Mon Apr 27 13:15:24 2015 UTC,"I think you're missing the part where they're doing this to keep charleston an enjoyable vacation destination. Having overlapping events that bring the city to a crawl is not the way to bring people back.  NOTHING in the article mentions wanting less people to come. What it does mention is making the city more usable and friendly when they arrive.  Honestly this seems to be long term thinking. Looking at ways to keep charleston a functional city without losing it's charm for tourists before it's too late and we're forced to pick one or the other.  Your submission title is just bad. They don't want to 'limit tourism.' Matter of fact, the article never uses the word limit in any form."
Charleston,31vfsd,bpwnz,-1,Wed Apr 8 14:00:23 2015 UTC,"""The number of such events would be capped at its current level, and all events — no matter how long-running — will have to reapply each year for consideration.""  It's not wanting less people to come, it's artificially limiting the number of people who want to come. Maybe a million visit this year, maybe their actions cause 1.1 million people to visit next year while 1.2 or 1.3M would have come if other planned events had been allowed. It's still artificial restriction. (number completely imaginary, just illustrating a point)  Why would they want to cap the number of events? How big does something have to be to be considered a public event? Who decides who's on this board and what do they use as criteria for granting requests?  I've lived in five different states over the past 10 years. Other cities would spend hundreds of million of dollars of taxpayer money to try to get what the city of Charleston is trying to artificially limit: frequent events/conferences/cruise ships and a flood of visitors.  I wasn't in town the weekend of the bridge run, but my guess is they closed down some of the lanes and traffic was nightmare for a few hours. It's completely understandable that the city would look carefully at the times they shut down the only link between Mt P and downtown...this proposal seems to be much broader than that."
Charleston,31vfsd,imagineskyscrapers,8,Wed Apr 8 15:30:21 2015 UTC,"I don't read it as not wanting people to come. I read it as making sure the city can offer the best experience to all when they're here. If you're trying to get to/from your cruise ship on bridge run day that's not going to be a good experience.  As for capping the number of events. I'd be interested to know the exact count of how many events we currently have. Seems to be no shortage. Maybe i'd disagree with the limit if i knew what it was, or who it was going to affect, but form the article all we can do is speculate.  I'd say from my reading of the article the point isn't to limit tourism, but to allow for sustainable growth in tourism."
Charleston,31vfsd,bpwnz,6,Wed Apr 8 15:51:09 2015 UTC,"Aside from the weekend of the Bridge Run and the ship docking, what overlapping events do people remember? I don't remember any others. I get limiting the overlapping events, but I will always find a rush to regulation based on recency to be idiotic (see: New York).  I think the ideas in the article are pretty humdrum and tame. As long as it doesn't ban my ability to find free parking, allows Union Pier to be redeveloped, I don't give a hoot what they want. Banning King and Meeting liquor licenses is fine, it just pushes for new centers like Morrison, Upper King, Wagener, or the west side. You're not going to prevent the people from coming, but you CAN spread them out."
Charleston,31vfsd,imagineskyscrapers,2,Wed Apr 8 16:02:41 2015 UTC,I am against the alcohol restrictions/early bar closings. They seem completely counterproductive.
Charleston,31vfsd,bpwnz,6,Wed Apr 8 16:04:46 2015 UTC,"At first, I felt the same way. But if you think about it, it pushes for new downtown hot spots. Think about how Morrison is going to be a year from now. HOT! Think about the area around Food Lion.  Eventually, you'll have something at the other end of the Bridge to Nowhere. It pushes development elsewhere is all.  I don't like their reasoning, it won't do what they want it to, but it will have other consequences that I see as good."
Charleston,31vfsd,imagineskyscrapers,0,Wed Apr 8 16:57:38 2015 UTC,"Very true, but it's not like that area wasn't growing already. Seems like the bars up that way have established a good rapport with the locals and left areas like king for tourists and college kids.  No matter what charleston does we're going to see growth on the peninsula of all kinds. It can't be prevented, but it can be prepared for. Really excited to see mention of improved cycling and pedestrian facilities downtown. Most of the year that's the best way to get around. If we could combo that with some park and ride and a trolley system maybe that predicted doubling in population won't kill charleston."
Charleston,31vfsd,shitterplug,2,Wed Apr 8 17:05:27 2015 UTC,"I seem to remember a lot of Morrison area news popping up right around the time of the moratorium (new BBQ place, Home Team, etc.) but then again, the booming of the area with Blue Acorn, SiB, and Edmund's Oast is also a good reason for development there."
Charleston,31vfsd,imagineskyscrapers,1 point,Wed Apr 8 17:12:05 2015 UTC,Have you honestly tried getting around downtown when events are going on? It's a fucking nightmare. It even fucks up upper King when you have all the damn food trucks doing their events all over the place. There is just too much shit going on in this tiny ass city during the summer.
Charleston,31vfsd,imagineskyscrapers,3,Wed Apr 8 17:49:30 2015 UTC,"From what I've experienced and read, most people downtown are completely naive and illogical, that's the only way I can explain it."

I feel like the Ferguson stuff and the incidents in NYC have sent a message out to police departments that they will be absolutely crucified if they don't act swiftly and properly. I just hope this doesn't swing the other way at some point and ruin a good officer's life who was in a situation that warranted deadly force.

He later claimed the victim took the stun gun from him and was attempting to attack him."
Charleston,31t55y,AlexEatsKittens,3,Wed Apr 8 01:05:09 2015 UTC,"I can't reasonably remove the other thread, as they both have visibility. I heard about it first on national news. Fucked up this has happened so close to home, I hope it doesn't start stupid shit."
Charleston,31t55y,pbmainiac3,0,Wed Apr 8 08:22:58 2015 UTC,"If you watch the video further, he picks it back up about thirty seconds later and puts it back on his belt, right about the 2:00 mark.  If we're going for complete transparency. There's an obvious struggle between the officer at the very outset of the video, which the camera captures the last second of, before the victim begins to run away and an object is thrown or discarded behind the officer by the victim or the officer. This object is later retrieved, brought over to the body, dropped, then picked back up about thirty seconds later.   The video clearly shows the officer calling in shots fired, the suspect took his tazer. WELL before the moving of evidence occurred.   While I don't believe it's a good shoot, I don't think it's a slam dunk case that the officer was trying to ""plant evidence"". Seeing as how he made the claim before he even started looking for where his tazer ended up."
Charleston,31t55y,monkeiboi,13,Wed Apr 8 02:01:28 2015 UTC,"Regardless, his life was no longer in danger so there was no need to shoot. And that is sketchy as fuck dropping it down next to the guy even if he did pick it back up. Why did he pick it back up? Remorse? Doesn't want to get in trouble for that too? Or maybe he realized he was recorded and and didn't want to get screwed harder? Non the less, he shot a man in the back as he was running away. That should be enough to warrant an unlawful furring of a sidearm."
Charleston,31t55y,fetus_muncher,-5,Wed Apr 8 02:47:27 2015 UTC,"Like I said, I don't think it was a good shoot.  I think it was more gray than black and white though. There WAS a struggle for the officers tazer. That's indisputable. I can screenshot it for you if you like. The video shows that just as clearly.   However, I don't view the victim as a lethal force threat where the officer started shooting, and neither should he have."

Charleston,31t55y,monkeiboi,4,Wed Apr 8 21:08:10 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure you can see the wire from the taser when the man turns to run in the beginning of the video. So even if the cop thought the guy got the taser and ran, he's running with a taser that has had it's cartridge spent. Not to mention you can hear the taser clatter to the ground behind the cop."
Charleston,31t55y,Giggles10001110,-3,Wed Apr 8 03:58:30 2015 UTC,"If he had shot while he was still in his face, it would have been justified.  Tazers basically become stun guns after the cartridge is fired, so it's still a viable weapon Using a incapacitating weapon on a cop is lethal force assault, pepper spray, tazer, stun gun, etc."
Charleston,31t55y,monkeiboi,1 point,Wed Apr 8 04:22:43 2015 UTC,"Considering there's a video of the officer shooting an unarmed man in the back as he tries to run away, I'm not really sure that it matters a whole lot whether the officer tried to ""plant evidence."""

Charleston,31t55y,5lowpitch,5,Wed Apr 8 06:17:27 2015 UTC,"Why do we put people in jail for missing child support payments? The guy reportedly ran because he didn't want to get sent back to jail, which is understandable.  We have the world's highest incarceration rate and more people serving time than any other nation on earth (we're 1/4 the size of China and India).  I can't help but think criminalizing everything is a big factor in these encounters."
Charleston,31t55y,imagineskyscrapers,6,Wed Apr 8 08:16:32 2015 UTC,"I don't necessarily think long-term prison time is a solution, but what do you want to do with deadbeat dads that don't contribute for their children?"
Charleston,31t55y,5lowpitch,4,Wed Apr 8 13:27:25 2015 UTC,"How does jail help anyone???  Spend the money that we'd use to incarcerate them and forward it to the family. Put a lien on his house, garnish wages, take any tax refunds, etc.  Putting someone behind bars costs a lot of money to taxpayers, and also comes with a lot of fees ad court expenses for the person in jail--money that doesn't go to the kid. Surprisingly, going to prison doesn't help the deadbeat hold a job or increase their wages to a point where they're able to contribute more.  Nothing about sending nonviolent people who don't need to be separated form society to prison makes sense."

Charleston,31t55y,wisertime07,0,Wed Apr 8 16:14:25 2015 UTC,"Not to hijack this thread and detract from an important and needed conversation, but we jail people over child support because there are a LOT of deadbeat dads, and in most situations it's the right thing to do.  Not to mention, it's rare that dads are jailed for this.    My sister was married to a guy who skipped out once their daughter was born.  Literally within weeks of his daughter being born.  My sister took him to court and I think she was awarded $300 a month or something.  That's a small price to pay, considering the costs involved in raising a child - beyond the $300/month, she agreed to provide everything else for her daughter.  And guess what?  He never paid a dime - not one cent, while making over $100k a year.  His $300/month grew to over $30k in the decade plus that he avoided all attempts to be a father.  He was briefly jailed over it, but turned loose after a few hours, arguing that he couldn't afford the $30+k and that by jailing him, he was taking away from providing for his other/""real"" family he had since created after leaving my sister.   Keep in mind that my sister wasn't some fling or one night stand - she was married to this man for 3 years prior to having her daughter.      Long story, but my sister remarried a good man and he wanted to adopt my niece - but because my niece legally had a dad already, he couldn't do it.  So, my sister brokered a deal where her ex-husband could relinquish being legally called my niece's father, in exchange for absolving him of the debt he owed.  He immediately signed the paperwork and just like that - basically ""sold"" his daughter for roughly $35k.    There are a lot of pieces of shit out there like my ex brother-in-law.  And that's the reason why deadbeat parents are rightfully jailed for nonpayment of child support.      *By the way - I'm a man as well, not some militant woman.  But I've watched the system step on women (and men) who are taken advantage of by people who took a part in creating a child, and then disappearing.  It's garbage.    Sorry for my rant."
Charleston,31t55y,5lowpitch,2,Wed Apr 8 13:48:15 2015 UTC,"I appreciate hearing your story, and I take responsibility for originally hijacking the thread... I think we all agree Walter Scott's death is a tragedy. I don't think this is too off topic because he was reportedly trying to flee because of this exact issue.  My issue isn't with trying to force deadbeat dads to share in the support, I just can't imagine how jail time would be the best solution in any back-payment situation.  If the guy owes money, there should be other ways to collect: liens if they own a house or car, garnishing wages, confiscating tax refunds, seizing solely-owned bank accounts, etc. In the majority of situations the guy just plain doesn't have any money or assets, and there's not much you can do. Putting them in jail doesn't help them hold a job or increase their earnings in any way.  Jail should be for violent people who need to be separated from society. We supposedly abolished debtors prisons centuries ago, but have kept them in many ways. Incarcerating someone is horribly expensive and doesn't advance any goal of making restitution for their infraction."
Charleston,31t55y,wisertime07,1 point,Wed Apr 8 14:24:59 2015 UTC,"I can agree with that, in most cases.  But like in my sister's case - the guy had several of his own businesses and did a lot of under the table electrical work.  He made great money, but he was good at hiding it also and always seemed to just break even on his jobs...  In situations like that, I don't know what else you can do.    For the most part though, you are right.  And getting child support payments modified is nearly impossible, so there are situations where a reasonable payment becomes insanely high, because of a loss of a job.  That type of stuff isn't fair.  But I've seen the abuse of the system first hand, and at least in my sister's situation - that guy should have been jailed - still should be jailed.    Overall though, this is a terrible situation and something that I'll remember for a long, long time.  I've got a lot of friends that are police officers and are really good guys.  I tend to believe their side and this is the first time I can remember honestly feeling bad for believing what was truly a lie.       The video doesn't explain how they ended up back behind that building.  I am sure there is more to it, and still can't believe that Scott was a saint.  But that officer's actions are completely inexcusable and he needs to be held responsible for the death of that man - in my opinion, a First Degree Murder charge is the absolute correct call."
Charleston,31t55y,Blusuit27,1 point,Wed Apr 8 15:21:02 2015 UTC,"Lawyer here. It happens more often than people know. Recently, a child support case out of Oconee County reached the US Supreme Court (Turner v. Rogers, 131 S. Ct. 2507, 180 L.Ed.2d 452 (2011)). Long story short, SCOTUS disagreed with the idea of jailing people for child support arrearage as an enforcement tool, but said they were within their rights to do so SO LONG as the Court complied with due process by doing four things: 1) informing defendant that his ability to pay is the ultimate question at a contempt hearing; 2) Providing defendant with a new financial declaration form; 3) provide an opportunity for court to question defendant based on his new financial declaration; and 4) that court make express finding that defendant had ability to pay and chose willfully not to.   Despite this ruling coming out in 2011, I've had 3 instances where family court in Berkeley County specifically where they are continuing to jail people without implementing this system of checks and balances to ensure due process is complied with.   Not to mention this is tantamount to debtor's prison, which the English abolished before we were even a nation...  90% of the time its not even the caretaking parent bringing these non paying parents into court and threatening to lock them up - the Clerk of Court does it! Why, you ask? B/c the parents agreed to make payments thru the court system, and you guessed it, the court tacks on an additional 5% to each payment. They want their share of the money."

Looks like this guy got the physiological stop which is the bullets destroying so much of your insides you don't work as a human anymore."

Charleston,31rlp1,zeeginganinja,11,Tue Apr 7 16:54:48 2015 UTC,"Out of all the Charleston restaurants, how come we don't have a    Local Moderately Priced Good   Seafood place?  We've got tons that are 2 of the 3, but none that fit all of them..."
Charleston,31rlp1,slowloadinggif,5,Tue Apr 7 18:54:42 2015 UTC,Get thee to Seewee Restaurant!
Charleston,31rlp1,tellevee,1 point,Tue Apr 7 22:29:24 2015 UTC,"Ehh..  Admittedly, there are a few places on this list that sort of fit these requirements, but SeeWee (to me) isn't one of them.  I used to love that place - LOVE that place.  I've been going there for 20+ years.  But the last few times I went, the service was beyond horrible and the portions were tiny.  I've worked in restaurants forever - if you're busy, I get it.  But when it's just 2-3 tables of people and the waitresses are all busy smoking outside or whatever, that's when I have a problem.  The last two times I went, I actually refilled my own drink and got my own silverware and cocktail sauce myself, while the waitstaff watched.  That's just terrible service, and I haven't been back."
Charleston,31rlp1,slowloadinggif,1 point,Wed Apr 8 14:43:44 2015 UTC,I haven't been in a couple of years myself. Bummer to hear that service has gone down!

Charleston,31rlp1,imagineskyscrapers,4,Tue Apr 7 19:14:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's actually a good point. I don't know why there isn't at least one place that just serves straight up Calabash style at a good price. Surprisingly the best seafood platter I've ever had in Charleston was at Saffron. I don't know if they still serve it, but it was only available once a week when they bought it all fresh.    Check out Marvin's on Dorchester Rd, IIRC it probably fits your three criteria. But it's more of a takeout place than an actual restaurant."
Charleston,31rlp1,HangerSteak,2,Tue Apr 7 21:05:30 2015 UTC,"Marvin's is good. I eat there a lot. Pretty cheap as far as seafood goes too. But you're right, there is no where to eat in the actual place."
Charleston,31rlp1,niorec,0,Wed Apr 8 12:42:19 2015 UTC,I do not understand what 'Calabash style' seafood is but I have heard it a few times recently. I grew up 1 mile outside of Calabash and there was never a style associated with it?
Charleston,31rlp1,Throwaway42288,4,Tue Apr 7 23:12:29 2015 UTC,"Are you asking me a question or informing me that you're unfamiliar with Calabash's association with seafood? If you've only heard it a few times recently yet grew up there I'm not sure what to tell you. I was born in Myrtle Beach and have known about Calabash seafood my whole life.    edit: a person below pointed out that I didn't actually tell you what Calabash style seafood is. It's fried seafood that is very popular in the town of Calabash, seeing as how there are numerous restaurants clustered in a small area of the town that all serve fried seafood in a similar manner, thus the type of seafood takes its name from the town that has popularized it. Here is a webpage that explains what it is. Sorry if I sounded rude or anything. I was just confused by your statement because I wasn't sure how you grew up one mile from a town famous for seafood yet didn't know that it was actually famous for seafood."

Charleston,31rlp1,SCphotog,7,Tue Apr 7 17:33:57 2015 UTC,This is fair and accurate.   Many of our restaurants are way too expensive when considering the food they serve and the atmosphere and service they provide.  It's jacked up for the tourists I'm sure... but is that how we want to... or should treat the people that visit here?
Charleston,31rlp1,Elogotar,3,Tue Apr 7 20:19:43 2015 UTC,Let alone the people who actually grew up here.
Charleston,31rlp1,powerlloyd,3,Tue Apr 7 20:52:00 2015 UTC,"Could not disagree more. The prices at Charleston restaurants are not ""jacked up for tourists"", but rather a reflection of level of talent and execution, and quality of product you are receiving. This particular article is The Washington Post claiming Charleston as one of the top dining destinations in the COUNTRY. Every year a handful of Charleston restaurants make the James Beard short list, and quite a few have won Beard awards. That is no small feat, a James Beard award is the food equivalent of an Oscar. You're not just paying for fancy food, you're paying for access to the highest quality product, produced by professionals who are competing at literally the top of their field.   I've paid WAY more at restaurants in larger cities for half the level of service, atmosphere, and food I can get in Charleston. It's all about perspective."
Charleston,31rlp1,imagineskyscrapers,2,Wed Apr 8 04:04:58 2015 UTC,I agree with this post 100%.

Red Orchid in West Ashley has great chinese food.  Dragon Palace on Daniel Island is also good, although Red Orchid is my favorite.  Also, the Oriental Cuisine on Rivers (or Formosa's in Goose Creek; same family and recipes with slight differences) is great Phillipino food.  Asian is one of my favorite genres of food and these have been long-time favorites."
Charleston,31wlds,n2chs,0,Wed Apr 8 18:52:22 2015 UTC,"Depends on your life experiences. If you grew up fed with a silver spoon and went to an all white private school, them you will have a culture shock. If you grew up in an urban environment, can treat everyone with respect, and accept diversity (you will be ok).  Bottom line, you're moving to an area where people have lived for generations, mixed in with cofc hipsters/young professionals.  It use to be a big dangerous area (back in 2010 with the Eastside Possy), but gentrification has taken its toll, gangsters got put in jail, new cops were hired, and new money has been moving in flipping homes and renting them out.  Further north past Line/Nassau is still pretty hot. But Columbus is safe, you will also be in a prime area (tons of new development, bars..etc)"
Charleston,31wlds,Chs2014,2,Wed Apr 8 19:05:38 2015 UTC,"Hmm, looking at a place right between Line and Nassau"
Charleston,31wlds,Chs2014,1 point,Wed Apr 8 19:20:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's a hit or miss. If you drive down Line, you will see homes that are boarded up and a lot of homeless people live in them (it's sad). Last year a lot of drug related shootings occured within the perimeter."
Charleston,31wlds,Chs2014,1 point,Wed Apr 8 19:25:27 2015 UTC,I definitely grew up in the former environment but live as if I grew up in the latter.  Just wanted to make sure it would be safe for me and a young woman to live in and walk to and from the university area.

Charleston,31t4ya,snowwhite394,2,Tue Apr 7 23:27:50 2015 UTC,"If you use Palmetto Parking, make sure it's worth the possible headache. I've used them in the past and wouldn't recommend them, unless they changed their customer service model.    If you forget to put up your permit, it's a boot and $30 for removal, even if they are familiar with your vehicle. They issued mirror hanging permits that broke frequently. I had another coworker whose hanger broke and fell off. Boot and $30. And then you have to pay for another permit.    I can understand the inconvenience of having to send out someone to remove a boot because you forgot to put on your permit. However, they keep a record of which cars hold permits, down to year/make/model and license plate number, so they have access to information regarding whether or not your car is allowed to be on the lot. Permits are also non-transferable, so if you have a permit but your car is not listed on the contract, you can be booted.    Their contract also states that parking is first-come, first-serve and permits only allow parking for one location, so if you have a permit and the lot is full, you're shit out of luck, because if you go to another lot you will be booted. Also, parking lot maintenance was nonexistent."

Charleston,31nfiw,GoldenSunTaxi,1 point,Mon Apr 6 21:04:58 2015 UTC,"I'd say party bus is the best option. You can try uber/taxi but good luck getting 5 to pick you within a reasonable timeframe of each other -- you may be able to get 2 of those huge van taxis but still long odds. THEN for pickup.... forget about it! Uber will be surging - probably anywhere from $60 to $120 per car to get you back to IOP - with prices like that limo/party bus seems a lot more reasonable, eh?  I guess a possibly cheaper option would to plan ahead with a cab company. Call them all soon and tell them your situation. See if they allow scheduling ahead of time and get quotes for each way."
Charleston,31ormt,lasko25,2,Mon Apr 6 23:40:20 2015 UTC,"Stay at the beach. If you can get a spot, make it Folly, just because there is a night scene there. Save on drinks and hit up a liquor store for wine and cocktail ingredients. Get your fill of food on downtown trips and come back for a nightcap and the ocean breeze. It's cheaper over all, you won't feel like you're throwing money away on a small downtown hotel room, and you get the best of both worlds. So many hotels downtown are just that: hotels. Most hotels, you'll forget you're in Charleston after you check in. The good ones that have that awesome Charleston feel run you as much as a beach house. If you're worried about driving sloshed, are you really going to get tanked every night? Try some select bars and a few cocktails. Save the sloshiness for a walk on the beach and a spacious barrier island beach house.  I'm not telling you to be cheap necessarily, but understand money disappears quite easy downtown, on par with a large metro. I see it downtown when Joe Dad, Mary Mom, and Stevie Son go from menu to menu looking for cheaper restaurants. Charleston is not podunk, chefs and mixologists come here from around the country. The rent makes up for the rest. Staying downtown is nice, but I'd rather you come to love it, want more, and come back many times. Staying in both is another option, but harder to book less than 5 nights in a beach house.   I'm beach biased though, I proposed on the beach and moved here because of the beach."
Charleston,31ormt,imagineskyscrapers,1 point,Tue Apr 7 04:20:24 2015 UTC,"Awesome. This is helpful. I'm beach biased myself but I found some cheaper rentals downtown that had me swayed. Folly is the place to go? Isle of Palms looked very Myrtle Beachy which turned me off a bit. Not too worried about drinking out every night, definitely more concerned on cost/convenience. If we'd stayed at the beach we'd add a rental car to the mix for sure, was thinking we'd save on that if we stayed downtown but how walkable are things really? What would an uber to and from the beach/grocery/whatever run us every time we needed something? Now I need beachside suggestions :)"

Poe's on Sullivan's is great, but if you don't want to hike it all the way to Sullivan's, that's fine.   Sesame in mt pleasant has a great burger, similar style to Poe's, and they make their own ketchup that's lovely with the fries they serve.   Downtown, I'd go to hom."

Our land lord is pretty non-confrontational as well, could she have been trying to passively ask y'all to pick up all the stuff so they can clean the backyard? There is literally and figuratively shit everywhere.   Is she passing that fine on to y'all or other residents or just telling y'all to clean up?"
Charleston,31gdn7,Barrent,6,Sun Apr 5 11:57:46 2015 UTC,"The landlord may also just want the communal area kept clean and clear for liability issues. I lived in a place once where other tenants would keep random pieces of trash furniture they brought home and smothered in the nastiest smelling spray paint in the back. Problem was they kept it under the window-mounted AC unit for my room, so I got to sleep in a room reeking of paint all the time. Did I mention everyone else in the building was too lazy to clean after their dogs, so there was a constant cesspool of feces getting sucked in as well? That was only if no one had emptied the bucket they normally dropped the shit in. Issues like these are health and liability issues for everyone, especially property owners, so I'm not surprised your landlord said something. Really though, everyone in a community, even a small apartment building, has a responsibility to respect their neighbors' basic living rights. Before that appartment, I considered it common fucking sense and  courtesy not to store a bucket of dog shit soup under someone's AC. I was wrong.

I have one friend who has them and likes them. I have no experience.   I just called at the end of my promo period and they extended my promo for another year, put me on the next speed tier (18mbps) and my costs actually went down ($45/mo). Despite paying for 18 down and 1.5 up, I consistently get 22-24 down and about 4 upload, with a ping of ~.30. Its never slowed down like Comcast does.  Plus, their customer support  speaks English and is knowledgeable"
Charleston,318rhf,EZmacaroni,2,Fri Apr 3 12:03:12 2015 UTC,"ATT has some fiber in the area, which should obviously be your first choice. I'm not sure if it's in west ashley, but it's worth a check.  Otherwise, I've been using Comcast for the past two years and they've been OK. No major issues, and the cost seems to be a little better (for me) than ATT offers. Using a wired connection, I've always gotten the speeds that I paid for."
Charleston,318rhf,Khannal,2,Fri Apr 3 00:14:50 2015 UTC,I loved Uverse but moved to where it was unavailable. Comcast screwed me over and over again so I went with WoW. I play League and don't have any issues. I highly do NOT recommend Comcast.
Charleston,318rhf,SCphotog,2,Fri Apr 3 10:30:00 2015 UTC,"Prices (some) people have quoted they are paying here are within or under the first year of service. It's more expensive after the first year or first 6 months, depending on which plan you buy into, and which carrier.  Generally, from what I've been able to gather, Comcast and Uverse both advertise near to the same download capability, while Uverse has about half the upstream.  Some of this is dependent on where you are... Uverse is what AT&T calls both their fiber and their standard DSL service.   If you can get fiber... I'd assume it would be a ton better.  Even with lower bandwidth, DSL, if you're close to the phone company's CO, has a lower latency potential. Mileage will vary of course.  If you play latency specific games this could make a difference... but it's a shot in the dark unless you have a way to test them side by side.  My parents have the WoW service, and it does all they need, though it seems to go out fairly often."
Charleston,318rhf,redstoneman79,1 point,Fri Apr 3 12:51:51 2015 UTC,"I'm in west ashley. Att just upped their service to 25mbs which I have.

So while you can have many connected, if the kids are watching programs on their tablets or tv, somethings being recorded and the so is watching a video. And you wanna watch a game The weakest link gets the boot.  Att Hotspots are limited.  Xfinity are everywhere.  But Comcast is the worst customer service out there."

So I called back and explained what happened and this agent told me there was no record on my account of me cancelling my cable. I got angry and asked how thats possible. She said that the first agent probably didnt want to take the hit on her scorecard for losing a customer so she lied.

Charleston,318rhf,Zellgadiss,1 point,Fri Apr 3 12:26:46 2015 UTC,Just throwing it out there for you and anyone else.  Go with WoW if possible.  Better customer service by far.
Charleston,318rhf,bitterdick,1 point,Fri Apr 3 16:26:18 2015 UTC,"I subscribed to Comcast when I first moved to town last summer and lived with it for about 4 months before switching to AT&T UVerse (the fiber kind).  I had really crappy variability in speed with Comcast, and it was somewhat more expensive than what I could get with AT&T.  When I switched to AT&T, I ended up with 3 cable boxes, ALL of the premium channels, a consistent 45mbps of rock solid internets with lower latency than I had with comcast, for about $40 less than I was paying for one of Comcast's crappy x1 dvr, HBO only, and their 50mbps internet that rarely exceeded 20.  If it's available, I'd pick the U-Verse fiber anytime over anything Comcast offers.  I did, however, have a lot of trouble getting AT&T's website to work properly when I was ordering my service.  I as the first tenant for my apartment number, and their website didn't want to recognize it as a real address.  I had to call in to get it setup, which was a pain, but was worth it.  If you want to see if you can get fiber service, just pick different apartment numbers at your address to see if they have the 45mbps offering.  They don't seem to label it as FTTH, but the 45mbps service is only available through fiber.  A good rule to live by is anything but Comcast, except AT&T 12mbps UVerse DSL."

Charleston,30v4m4,Parkedcarwashit,15,Mon Mar 30 23:21:04 2015 UTC,"I can tell you with certainty that the CPD would investigate this hit and run. If it happened in the city of Charleston, Team 7 will investigate the incident. If they have a backlog, it could be 1-2 weeks. If the person who hit your car is from out of state, make sure you give the CPD, or whichever local PD, a call today or tomorrow and ask for an update. Have your incident report # ready (probably starts with a 15-). If the other party skips town everything may take a little longer.  Call your car insurance company if you haven't already! This is a very important and often overlooked step. They can gather evidence as well for an independent investigation. This could be more important than the police investigation because it will lead you to compensation. The police findings can bolster your claim.  Is there surveillance video available from the hotel parking lot, or any grounds nearby? Scope out the location and do any legwork that may help your insurance company or suggest any details to the police that may help their investigation. Assume everyone is trying to help you until you are sure they are not.  Also, since the person who hit your sister's car may have also been a hotel guest, they may have been unable to give you any more details beside that person's Tag# and description of their car. The insurance company, or a lawyer, if necessary, will be able to get more information from the hotel.  Most important step: Write everything down now! Everything you remember. Every single detail – be meticulous. Include case #, tag #, policy #, claim #, times, dates, names, addresses, everything! As you get further from the event, details will become fuzzier. If you write it down now, you will have clarity whenever asked about anything from this incident, whether it be to lawyers, police, or insurance companies.  Under no circumstance should you speak to the other person's insurance company, should they contact you. Be very polite, but tell them you'd like them to speak to your claims adjuster, or you are getting an attorney, or give them your attorney's info. Once you have a case # and an insurance claim with your insurance company, let them handle the other parties. You have to be tenacious and watch what you say.  Don't hesitate to get a lawyer if you run into any trouble. In fact, you may be wise to contact a few for free consultations to shop around. If your sister has to be out of state for future proceedings, they can handle the minutiae.  Finally...don't forget to keep it cool. I was trembling with rage dealing with this in the past. Staying cool when speaking to anyone involved will go a long way!!"

Charleston,30t4qa,Sunburn79,4,Mon Mar 30 14:25:31 2015 UTC,"Most people pushing for a dedicated bike-pedestrian lane across the northbound U.S. Highway 17 drawbridge might have thought the project is a done deal, but that’s not necessarily the case.  Meanwhile, a new survey of cycling in downtown Charleston underscores the demand for a better crossing over the Ashley River.  While a public meeting on the change has been pushed back from March to late April or early May, the project is still on track, according to county project manager Richard Turner. “We’ve got a lot of folks headed in the right direction now,” he said.  That public meeting will include simulated models capable of analyzing the traffic impacts of removing one of the four lanes.  The most recent study indicated that could add an additional 13 seconds to morning commutes, but Turner said the county is collecting new traffic counts to update that calculation.  “The biggest complaint we’ve heard is, ‘What is this going to do with the traffic?’ ” Turner said. “We need to address that in the public meeting. ... We’ll actually play a little video.”  The county plans to bid the project in two phases.  This spring, it will seek a contractor to rework the bridge’s off-ramp that leads onto Bee Street.  That project — widening the ramp to two lanes — will help traffic regardless of whether a bike-ped path is built, Turner said.  This fall, County Council is expected to consider issuing the contract for the path itself.  Council Chairman Elliott Summey said he has heard arguments both for and against converting the lane, and he will be interested in seeing the county’s study.  “I’ve never voted on it, so this is going to be all new for me,” he said. “When I see this study and I see the design, I’ll do like I do with everything else — go with my gut.”  Councilman Joe Qualey, who represents James Island and who previously supported the bridge’s lane conversion, said he now has concerns, particularly with 300 new apartment units being built at Albermarle Road and 1,000 more on Maybank Highway.  He also noted that the island suffered massive congestion Thursday morning when one lane of the James Island connector was closed down.  “All those things have given me great reason to pause and reflect,” he said.  Turner said the design work is focusing on whether a retaining wall is needed on the West Ashley side and how the lane can be built to ensure the continued functionality of the opening deck of the drawbridge.  Those answers will affect whether the price tag rises much above the current $2 million estimate.  Finding a safe bike crossing of the Ashley River has long loomed as a top goal for Charleston Moves, a cycling and pedestrian advocacy group, but it’s a goal that has been elusive so far.  Charleston Moves has worked recently with the Charleston Civic Design Center on a plan for improving biking downtown.  At least 858 online surveys have been entered, with more than 1,150 different routes mapped out.  Almost 20 percent of all those trips crossed the Ashley River, and that raised the eyebrows of Charleston Moves board chairman Tom Bradford.  “The concentration (of responses) is obviously downtown, but the surprise is 19 percent of the responses are from West Ashley,” he said. “There’s a constituency there that’s eager for this.”  The county previously spent about $430,000 studying a plan to build a cantilevered lane off the bridge before concluding that there was no way that could work without ending its ability to open as a drawbridge.  That turning point occurred in 2011, when the county and city instead chose to pursue a lane conversion.  Meanwhile, Charleston Moves hopes a new downtown bike plan — one that outlines a minimum grid of bikeable streets and networks — can be finished this spring and presented to City Council this year."

I don't know of any existing precedent to say that they're so dangerous as to warrant a prohibition.  This feels like an abuse of authority. If it's within the bounds of what the FAA has made legal, I don't see why they'd want to stop people from flying at the festival.  After all... it's more publicity for the fest and the town itself.  Last note... FFS, stop calling them drones. It's not a drone."

One of my dream jobs at the moment is to get into a position where I can do drone camera operation for video and events.  The sad part is that at the same time, I'd hate to see some random dude throw one into a kid eating an ice cream cone. Living in Charleston, I'm sure everyone here knows the joy of a professional photography who spent $1000 on a DSLR. I don't find signs like this as distressing when I realize those same guys could easily do the same with a camera drone."

But I kind of put the axe to that for the time being. We lived in upstate NY and couldn't take it anymore. I have my geeky side myself, I work as a Head Web Developer for a company in West Ashley.  I can honestly tell you that it has been the best decision I have ever made moving down here. So many things to do and to see compared to where I used to live.  We live in Summerville ourselves. It was between Mt. P and Summerville as they have the best schools around. Mt. P is just too much out of our price range, so we decided on Summerville instead."

I've lived in NH my whole life, and this year had the most brutal winter I can recall. I'm definitely ready to be done with the snow.   Since we just had the baby, we're going to be splitting a two-unit house with my folks for a little while, until we've gotten more established in the area.   Summerville is an awesome town, I really like the size of it and it has a lot of roads that I'm going to love taking the motorcycle on.  Nice to meet you!"

One day while we were driving back to NY it just hit me. I wanted nothing to do with driving back to NY at all. I just realized how much I hated living up north and wanted to move down here. It only took a few months and bam, here we are now.  What part of Summerville do you guys live in?"
Charleston,30hlnn,shallowrecover,2,Fri Mar 27 14:54:50 2015 UTC,"I don't really know Summerville well enough to answer that yet, but it's the area north of the country club if looking at google maps.   Yeah, on me and my fiancee's last visit, we were walking around the neighborhood and just both sort of realized at once that we wanted to stay. I got flown down about three weeks ago for a job interview, and I remember stepping out of the airport and feeling the combination of 73 degrees and slight ocean breeze. Going home was a struggle!"

I've never heard the actual name/ scientific name of these guys, but the name I was taught as a kid was "" 'Skeeter-Eaters"" named so because they actually have no interest in humans and, as the name implies, eat mosquitoes and other small pesky insects.  so in other words, yeah there are some giant mosquito like things buzzing around, but other than the fact that they look gross they're actually good  harmless (so far as I'm aware) to have around. so if you don't mind seeing them, just let them chill and do their thing.   Every mosquito they eat is one less that's biting you. And in Charleston, that goes a long way  edit: apparently everything I was taught as a child is a lie. /u/shitterplug has informed me that the European crane fly (his source) is incapable of eating anything in its adult form.  edit 2: If you are picky about your lawn looking nice they can be major pests if too many of them are around.  edit 3: I'm bad a reddit... the source was from /u/Dr_Leo_1964.

Charleston,30gpyv,autowikibot,1 point,Fri Mar 27 11:23:28 2015 UTC,"Crane fly:       The crane flies are members of the family Tipulidae of insects in the order Diptera, true flies in the superfamily Tipuloidea. Cylindrotominae, Limoniinae, and Pediciinae have been ranked as subfamilies of Tipulidae by most authors,  though occasionally elevated to family rank. In the most recent classifications, only Pediciidae is now ranked as a separate family, due to considerations of paraphyly.   Crane flies are found worldwide, though individual species usually have limited ranges. They are most diverse in the tropics, and are also common in northern latitudes and high elevations.   The Tipulidae sensu lato is one of the largest groups of flies, including over 15,000 species and subspecies in 525 genera and subgenera.  Most crane flies were described by the entomologist Charles Paul Alexander, a fly specialist, in over 1000 research publications.

There's Hampton Park on Ashley/Rutledge Ave downtown.  There's a few fields over in West Ashley Park that already have goals set up most of the time.   There's also a field in West Ashley behind what used to be Food Lion (and I think a Ryan's used to over there?) on 61. I think that's public access as well. Not sure though  e: oh! and there's also a field down by the aquarium that my friends and I would use sometimes. Not sure if that's still available.  e2 : There's also a dog park down by colonial lake downtown that a couple of my friends have used before  e3 : There's also the fields over between the Ashley river and Lockwood Drive right above the Ashley River Memorial Bridge

As of now we want to rent and once we get to know the area a lot better eventually buy something.  I know a lot of places are beautiful and I might just be super paranoid cause im use to NJ having so many bad areas.  So we are just trying to learn what areas to avoid altogether down there.    Thank you for any feedback you can provide us.

Charleston,30e4gn,CKitch26,1 point,Thu Mar 26 18:09:18 2015 UTC,"I'm a homebrewer (I checked out r/Charlestonbeer) and prefer to spend times outdoors at the beach or  kayaking. Miss living near the beach as the wife and I left Brunswick GA a few years ago. I prefer something thats laid back but not boring. I'm currently in Augusta and work in Aiken and I find it really boring here.   The job that I may take is about 45 minutes outside town, so Id be in the suburbs which is fine."
Charleston,30e4gn,CKitch26,1 point,Thu Mar 26 18:18:59 2015 UTC,"Aiken native here. You'll like the change of pace in Charleston. Contrary to those places, though most of the houses downtown aren't insulated because of their historicity. This of course only applies if you want to live downtown but I have the past 4 years and it's the most troubling part in terms of cost of living (due to heating/cooling).  You'll find more outdoor opportunities here than you will anywhere in the state so you're good there. If you own your own kayak or boat, it'd be even better so that you can take it out whenever and wherever you want, though. Renting from the various companies around can get costly.  In terms of the likeness to Savannah, it is similar in architecture, but only downtown. James Island, West Ashley, Hannahan, and Mt. Pleasant are closer to what you would think of as a normal city.  Other than that, we have a pretty big (and growing) craft beer scene which I'm sure you saw at /r/charlestonbeer. The climate is typical of what you'd find in the south just with a bunch of humidity in the summer due to the coast (not sure what Brunswick is like). The lifestyle is kinda what you want it to be. There's tons of ""festivals"" (food and wine festival, international film festival, charleston fashion week, lowcountry oyster festival, etc.) which essentially happen year round so there's tons of opportunities to do things, but nobody will judge you for choosing not to or to lead a less immersive lifestyle.  On the negative side, I find that there's a higher prevalence of roaches/beetles that take up residence in houses in Charleston than in Aiken and Augusta. I think this is fairly limited to downtown, but I'm not sure.   I hope this helps!"
Charleston,30e4gn,bpwnz,2,Thu Mar 26 18:47:38 2015 UTC,"Thanks, and yea, currently living in an older house here in augusta that was build in the 20's, with original wallpaper and everything. Our power bill in the summer and gas in the winter is outrageous (300$ a month) just to keep it at 80 in the summer and 60 in the winter (never comfortable). We're really preferring something newer with better insulation that has a large kitchen. Our current kitchen is a claustrophobic's nightmare.   Craft brew culture in Augusta is depressingly nonexistent. The only place I know of around here is in Aiken."
Charleston,30e4gn,bpwnz,2,Thu Mar 26 19:06:03 2015 UTC,"Yea, you're going to want to move somewhere off of the peninsula. Most places downtown have small kitchens and little to no insulation.  And yea, even in Aiken it's pretty dismal. Nothing like what you'll find here"

We know Charleston is supposed to double in size in the next decade, yet there is no plan to expand roads or plan for the growth.   Take the airport for example. Years ago, Denver realized its growth potential and had a smallish airport (Stapelton). It was close to downtown. Instead of just giving it a small build-out, they moved 20 miles further away and built a monster airport. It was big for the time but it kept the city and state far ahead of the growth trends."

And beyond that, when he started the midnight bar ordinance, he essentially raised and lowered property values arbitrarily, since the ordinance was placed on the BUILDINGS, not on specific companies or stores.  A building that once housed a bar became exponentially more valuable when that was enacted, compared to a building that may be far nicer and in a better area, but housed, lets say a bank."

Some of the controversial things he's done as mayor are: taking over James Island and incorporating it into Charleston, placing government sponsored public housing below Broad St (which was a horrible idea) so the poor can live with the wealthy, he was the main factor in establishing the midnight ordinance, pushing the idea to close down one lane of Ashley Bridge so cyclists can safely cross from WA (imagine the traffic in the coming years...yikes!)"

Richmond does have some more northern characteristics, mainly being that the city just isn't as friendly.  You don't notice it as much living there, but when you move away and go back, people definitely lack that southern charm and that welcoming feeling.  You notice it just in every day interactions with people.

I would look for large businesses in the Summerville and North Charleston area, including Trident Technical College, because I never hear places going up there. Other places that I see having trucks rarely are downtown, MUSC, Midway in Mount Pleasant (really anywhere in Mount Pleasant), and Trident Medical Center. I would also ensure that you're set up at a brewery as often as possible on Fridays and Saturdays. There are ones popping up all of the time. A new one is going in on Meeting St. North, another right off of the Meeting St. Exit off 26 near Rutledge Cab Company and another in downtown Summerville.  Food:  One food truck that used to exist but went the way of the dodo that people loved was a mac & cheese truck. There was also Cory's grilled Cheese that eventually set up shop in WA. Both missed (who can travel to WA for lunch all of the time). Other styles that you just do not see anywhere that might do well: Chinese/Thai, Italian, Wings, Hot Dogs, Taco/Burritos (the only ones we have are stationary for the most part in North Charleston), all-out burger place, offering all deep fried items (even desserts), or bar food (without the beer), but with TVs outfitted on the truck so people can watch multiple when the games are on."

Charleston,303be2,demondeachem,11,Tue Mar 24 03:42:55 2015 UTC,"I come from LI, so here's my perspective:  In NY, the roads are crazy. People swerving across lanes, pulling out of parking lots in front of you, cutting you off on the parkways, etc. All of this happens, but you can see it coming if you've live there your whole life. People in NY could be called ""bad"" drivers, but in my opinion they are highly skilled drivers who just don't give a shit. You have to be good at driving to not die on the roads in NY. In that sense, NY driving is sort of controlled chaos.  In SC, some people drive just like they have no fucking idea what's going on. Ive seen people stop on interstate merge ramps-- the long, never ending merge lanes, not the tiny little parkway merge lanes like in NY.  They do things with no consideration for the flow of traffic, like when an ambulance is coming from the other direction on a divided highway, they slow down to a crawl as if the EMT is going to jump the median and turn into the woods right in front of them. Its dangerous. Many drivers here are bad not because they are selfish and don't care about you, but because they are stupid."

Charleston,303be2,waxingpsychotic,0,Tue Mar 24 23:22:48 2015 UTC,"This is a good summary.  I've driven in commute times in Philly, NYC, Boston, and Charlotte and they are all worse than here. I think people report it being bad here because they are used to much less. Growing city = traffic no matter where you are.  The highways and routes are designed poorly, sometimes because there is no money, sometimes because people have hard ons for their ""view"" of a swamp. The metro here can do much better with a few more highways and an outer loop.  Here you will see people slowing a little too much (wayyyy overly cautious) or riding your ass (because they think pushing is a valid form of assertive driving). People riding the left lane no matter what speed, accelerating way too slowly, letting people turn in front of them even when there are people trying to get through on right of way, and people in and out of lanes without clearance are also other things you will see.  I think people exaggerate on drive times, 15 minutes is a great commute time but with the average commute time around the metro less than 30 minutes, I'm not sure what's the big deal. I'm biased however. I've driven 35-45 minutes for a commute for most of my life. I love to drive and I love talk radio.   Accidents do not occur every day, and yes when they do, there's a back up, mostly because people just SIT THERE IN THE GODDAMN LANE and not move out of it because they think that mythical law about not moving the car applies. If traffic bothers you terribly, to  the tune of more than 15-20 minutes is hell, live where you work. Don't listen to others when they say certain commutes are better between areas (Mt. P is screwed in a few years). 30-45 is reasonable. I've never stuck for more than 80 minutes and that was because I made the dumb decision to take 4 different shortcuts that I knew nothing about. Also, Waze helps and it does depend on when you go."
Charleston,303be2,demondeachem,3,Tue Mar 24 15:14:44 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  The road infrastructure here is in big trouble with population growth far outpacing new road construction.

Those cities are obviously huge with large amounts of traffic on and off the interstate.  For the most part though, traffic there flows.  Charleston is more or less a small city.  Nothing but gridlock at all times.  The traffic report sounds the same every single morning.  Wreck at this interchange, this bridge shut down, this bridge shut down, traffic now moving onto this highway, etc.  Tons of people moving into a very confined space so it's not getting any better.  I moved to my neighborhood five years ago and we were on the very far end of Mount Pleasant, what some would almost consider the boonies.  Now it takes me 15 minutes just to get out of my neighborhood and I'm a 1/2 mile from the exit.   You want to see a nightmare?  Be on the Ravenel bridge at 4:45pm last week when a seven car wreck happens that stops four lanes of traffic cold with no break down lane to move in to to let six emergency vehicles through.    The city and the surrounding areas are just growing very quickly and there's a finite amount of work they can do to relieve the traffic problem.  I imagine most smaller cities that are growing are experiencing the same problem.  It just gets frustrating and annoying.  Also, the slow lane/fast lane dynamic doesn't seem to exist here."

Everywhere else is pretty okay, though it does get backed up in spots, especially on I-526 and Hwy 17 (basically the only roads in and out of downtown). It helps a lot if you can be a little flexible with your commute as traffic is a hundred times better during non-rush-hour times."
Charleston,303be2,linz_in_the_sky,1 point,Tue Mar 24 06:29:31 2015 UTC,"Interesting and good to know. Looks like if we move there, we'll have to get somewhere close to work. Thanks!"
Charleston,303be2,Fazaman,2,Tue Mar 24 03:43:21 2015 UTC,"Get as close as you can. Traffic here is awful. There are a few points along the interstate that there will definitely be an accident every single day. Heaven help you if they're cutting trees, the interstate will be a parking lot."
Charleston,303be2,redbirdjr,2,Tue Mar 24 13:13:20 2015 UTC,"we'll have to get somewhere close to work.   Not necessarily. Depends on which direction you are from work.  A (normally) 15 minute drive from Mt Pleasant to North Charleston (526 west) at 8am would take maybe 20 minutes. That same 15 minute drive from the Summerville area (26 east) would take 30+ minutes from volume delays. I'm in Goose Creek and my commute takes me down side streets to near 526 and my commute can range from 15 minutes to 40, vastly dependent on if there's an accident on 526 (because most the traffic in my direction is headed there) or not. If I wait 30 minutes, there's no traffic to speak of. So, it all depends on where work is, and what time you need to be there. Outside of rush hour, for a New Yorker, there's no traffic."
Charleston,303be2,johnpatrck,2,Tue Mar 24 17:03:23 2015 UTC,"I'm originally from the Boston area. Charleston isn't so bad, comparatively. Also, the decision as to where to live (making for a reverse commute, if possible) weighs into it. I go from roughly downtown to North Charleston each day - opposite from the major traffic flow."

Charleston,303be2,aintitso,2,Wed Mar 25 02:32:38 2015 UTC,"I just wanted to thank everyone for the comments. If we do end up heading down to work/live there, we'll be making informed traffic decisions!"
Charleston,303be2,Guio,1 point,Tue Mar 24 14:25:39 2015 UTC,"In my humble opinion, in Charleston it's all about where you're headed and when.  Traffic is extremely directional.  I live downtown, commute everyday to Goose Creek, and experience almost zero traffic.  People moving in the opposite direction must spend half their day in their car..."
Charleston,303be2,golfpinotnut,2,Wed Mar 25 02:30:40 2015 UTC,"From LA, wouldn't compare it to Charleston traffic. There's the hours you should avoid and downtown is a mess in general. Can't say more past the peninsula towards Summerville because I'm not there as often."
Charleston,303be2,the_brizzler,2,Tue Mar 24 15:38:31 2015 UTC,Buy a dash cam.    Charleston drivers are very unpredictable.  I had my first accident here in Summerville (I didn't cause it) and I'm from Miami / Puerto Rico.
Charleston,303be2,Halome,2,Tue Mar 24 16:22:37 2015 UTC,"I grew up in Charleston, and had a really cool summer job where I had to drive marine supplies all over the low country, from Wadmalaw Island all the way up to Wando.  I ""sat"" in traffic day after day.  But I grew up and ""graduated"" to life in Atlanta.  Now, when I go home to visit my parents, I just laugh when they complain about traffic.  Spare me.  You guys don't know what heavy traffic is."
Charleston,303be2,hlacalc,2,Wed Mar 25 02:11:04 2015 UTC,"I use to live in San Diego, San Antonio, just North of New York City and a few other major cities.  I moved here a little under 2 years ago and people talk about traffic here like it is horrible.  I have yet to see ""traffic"".  It does get busy around rush hour, but it is very short lived and just slightly slower moving.  My commute is 30 minutes without traffic and maybe 45 on a bad day.  One time it took me an hour to make my morning commute but only because a cop car got into an accident on the highway.  Downtown can get a little nasty during rush hour because the roads aren't built wide enough for parking and through traffic in most places, but once you are outside of downtown it is pretty smooth sailing.  Moving to Charleston will more than likely be a nice relief for you with regards to traffic."
Charleston,303be2,HeatherSolos,1 point,Wed Mar 25 03:11:11 2015 UTC,"Coming from Chicago, I echo most sentiments here, not bad at all in comparison. It has its unique issues, but I drive 62 miles one way to work (3-4 days a week) and it takes me nearly the exact same amount of time to get to work as it did driving 20 miles in/around Chicago so it doesn't even phase me. I think the biggest take away is as long as you either live within a few miles of work, work the opposite direction of the flow of traffic, or simply work something other than a 9-5 job - you're golden."
Charleston,305jjg,hlacalc,11,Tue Mar 24 17:36:05 2015 UTC,MUSC has a good housing directory for apartments downtown. Much better quality of life than West Ash IMO
Charleston,305jjg,zeeginganinja,2,Tue Mar 24 19:46:47 2015 UTC,"+1 totally agree... Parking is a disaster for a commuter at MUSC, garage parking is expensive and not guaranteed (huge waitlist). The Horizon Project is taking over the free lot, so employees will be forced to scramble. Pay a little more and prevent stress."
Charleston,305jjg,Chs2014,5,Tue Mar 24 19:48:15 2015 UTC,"I'm telling you this as a native, you are looking too far out! Downtown living is what you should be looking for. At least for the 1st year, so you get a handle of the area. Craigslist and MUSC (private student) listings will help you. If you need help deciding if an area is safe downtown, just ask it here."
Charleston,305jjg,Chs2014,2,Tue Mar 24 18:09:35 2015 UTC,"I'd disagree. Most everyone I know that works downtown (including residents at musc) commute from outside of the city. Your dollars go a lot farther in west ashley than they do downtown.  That said i'm not too familiar with these complexes aside from visiting one or two of them, hopefully someone else pops in that is.  edit: yes, please downvote instead of offering a reasonable reply..."
Charleston,305jjg,bpwnz,3,Tue Mar 24 18:34:06 2015 UTC,"I won't downvote as you attempted to give a valuable insight to someone, but....  I drive past MUSC 5 times a week coming from Mount Pleasant.  It really isn't that great, long parking lines, very few spots, crazy traffic to try to get anywhere close to there.    Commuting from Hibben Ferry wouldn't be too terrible, looking at a 20ish minute drive, even with a bit of traffic. I would prefer this over West Ashley, unless you were looking into Avondale (great area, close proximity).  Coming from Element bay?  Buckle your seat belts, that can be a solid 40minute drive between 7:30 - 9am (I lived 5 minutes further out, passed the sign every day for 2 years).  Sav Highway is insane most hours of the day, and the lights aren't synchronized so there is little to no flow of traffic.  Stop go the whole way.  You can always try Glenn McConnell or 61, but those do take just SLIGHTLY less time, with equally bad traffic.  Living downtown is the best alternative here.  Easily get to work, hopefully by bike or walking.  Avoid most/all traffic.  And even if you drive, at least it is a 5 minute drive and a 10 minute parking excursion!  Just my opinion of course, but I have driven all of these routes for at least 5 months out of the year each."
Charleston,305jjg,gliz5714,2,Tue Mar 24 21:53:10 2015 UTC,"Thanks. Great thoughts. I guess it depends on on often hlacalc will be working 8-5.  Personally I do 30-45 commutes every day, and while it's less than optimal it allows me to live where I want to live and work where I want to work. I realize some people wouldn't/couldn't do that."
Charleston,305jjg,bpwnz,1 point,Wed Mar 25 13:13:50 2015 UTC,"Yea, I agree.  Some people don't mind driving more than 20 minutes.  For me, I like to cut down the time in the car, so that limits where I can possibly live.  Although some people love audio books and podcasts, and driving 40 minutes is the perfect amount of time!"
Charleston,305jjg,gliz5714,2,Wed Mar 25 17:08:27 2015 UTC,"Lived in Elements at Carolina Bay for 3 months, corp apt.  Gym is great! Not many people there so can get to most of the equip.    Pool is nice, get's lot of use though mid-afternoon lots of kids.  Evenings adults for the most part.  Staff does a great job with social events, they publish a monthly calendar and you can check out bikes to ride around the area.    Most fun stuff close, a few miles from apt. places you should check out  Green Goat and Triangle Char Bar.  Hidden gem Angel Oak.  Apt complex is super pet friendly, have a dog grooming station and a fence off doggie ""playpen"" or somesuch.      HWY 17 can be a challenge in the AM but get an early start.  Any questions about Elements, let me know."
Charleston,305jjg,robchez,1 point,Thu Mar 26 02:36:33 2015 UTC,"Hey thanks everyone for the insight. I appreciate your advice, and glad I got to hear both sides of the fence.   We are going to be down there in early April to check everything out. Personally, I have no desire to live in any type of ""city"" atmosphere, my wife on the other hand loves Brooklyn living. That being said, if a complex like Element bay exists downtown, I have no issue paying for it. I work from home and my salary will remain the same, her salary will be increasing from 0. My housing costs here in NY are almost 4x what I've been quoted so far at the above 4 places.  Typically dwellings in ""downtown"" areas are SMALL, and I like my space. I also ride a motorcycle as my primary mode of transportation (weather permitting), so I'd prefer to not deal with the traffic. As a bonus, I have no desire to go downtown, I like the beaches and country riding whenever I can get it, so I will likely be riding the opposite way of traffic.  I guess my mind can change when I am down there in April. I'll let you all know where we end up."
Charleston,305jjg,feekul,2,Tue Mar 24 22:08:21 2015 UTC,"I would take a look at James island. The commute is better then west ashley and it is a more laid back atmosphere then mount pleasant. Check out the quarter deck, meridian place, and riverland woods."
Charleston,305jjg,Chs2014,1 point,Tue Mar 24 23:47:22 2015 UTC,"Outside of downtown you will hit tons of traffic. But believe when I tell you that most of the homes downtown were built pre 1900s, so it's very common having 400-500 sqft bedrooms (you will be hard pressed to find this elsewhere). If you want space, downtown is the answer."
Charleston,305jjg,zeeginganinja,1 point,Tue Mar 24 22:20:28 2015 UTC,Downtown apartments small? I lived in downtown Charleston for years and never had a small apartment. Small closet? Yes. Small apartment? Not at all.
Charleston,305jjg,turnk,1 point,Wed Mar 25 01:07:08 2015 UTC,"I lived at Ashley River Apartments for two years. I moved for a change of scenery and their rent got too high. It is a nice safe little area though. The complex itself isn't really secluded and is next to a few busy roads (including one that leads to a hospital... meaning ambulances at all hours) so if you need complete quiet to sleep, might not be for you.  That being said, that was really the only downside I had at that place. The staff is super helpful, organized and prompt."
Charleston,305jjg,tellevee,1 point,Wed Mar 25 01:30:15 2015 UTC,"Alright, it appears I have much more studying to do. The housing directory was fairly helpful, but more geared for students. Plus a lot of places were not pet friendly. :-(  I have started to fill up appointments for my April visit, and will wait a bit til I get closer to fill up some of the ""craigslist"" finds, since those tend to rent out quickly after posting.  Thanks again, I cant wait to be back in the south. It's been 15 years since I have lived here. Appreciate all of your tips and advice. My wife especially thanks everyone as well. She's not a ""redditor"" but often reads over my shoulder."
Charleston,305jjg,blackjesuit,1 point,Wed Mar 25 04:17:05 2015 UTC,"Hibben Ferry is garbage. The management will wine and dine you to get you to sign the lease, then they couldn't care less about you. Cockroaches everywhere, tiny apartments, paper-thin walls, and dog shit everywhere."
Charleston,305jjg,TheLoneMoroccan,1 point,Thu Mar 26 03:27:46 2015 UTC,"I have friends that live at Element, and I've visited multiple times. It seems to be a lot of young working professionals. They've got a nice pool, and the apartments are top notch. I know they do a lot of events for their residents, like having a social gathering at a bar (they'll even buy your first drink) and bringing food trucks into the complex. If I were planning to stay in Charleston, I'd consider living there next."

Charleston,302imz,wingmanly,2,Tue Mar 24 00:56:14 2015 UTC,Isn't commercial drone use still illegal?  Be careful with that ad.  Good video though.
Charleston,302imz,Ftyui6,2,Tue Mar 24 11:43:39 2015 UTC,It is unless you hold a Commercial pilot license or have an FAA exemption.
Charleston,302imz,Ftyui6,3,Sat Mar 28 09:20:12 2015 UTC,"No money was exchanged for that video.....it's my own drone.  Anyways, good luck finding a cop on Folly that will regulate that!"
Charleston,302imz,wingmanly,2,Tue Mar 24 12:40:21 2015 UTC,"This is the wrong attitude to have. I know the FAA is slow about creating regulations, but there is a reason air travel is so safe. As a local pilot, please at least review the proposed FAA guidelines. We frequently fly over Folly (on the way to/from JZI). I think it's within 5 mi of the airfield, so technically illegal. To me, as long as you're not on my final approach or climb out, I'm largely ok with some violations of the 5 mi rule, but please just stay below 400 ft. I'd really rather not take a drone to the face at 100+ kt. We often do low level practice maneuvers around area landmarks such as the lighthouse over there."
Charleston,302imz,dirtyseaotter,1 point,Sat Mar 28 09:30:24 2015 UTC,"Ftyui6, I appreciate this comment.  I have read the proposed guide lines.  I was unaware that Folly was so close to an airfield.

Charleston,3018v2,AlexEatsKittens,1 point,Mon Mar 23 18:58:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the decent number of play houses are one of the few things to do in Charleston that don't require drinking. There's also the symphony."

Charleston,3018v2,zeeginganinja,7,Tue Mar 24 10:42:08 2015 UTC,"I have a few suggestions from someone who doesn't drink.. But Charleston definitely is a drinking-oriented city, particularly in the evenings. Some things I've found: improv at Theater 99 (call ahead for tickets!!), ice skating at Carolina Ice Palace, sports events (Stingrays and Battery are in season now), bowling, ghost tours, hookah bars, movies.. Yeah, that's about it. Sometimes you can find performances at the N Chas Coliseum, and Spoleto has more options when that rolls around. But all in all, Charleston isn't the greatest city for sober entertainment options."

Charleston,3018v2,Rhyno08,1 point,Mon Mar 23 19:48:45 2015 UTC,"Definitely take classes.  I have a lot of friends who do improv there (through the theatre community) and they're really welcoming nice people.  A bit pricey, but definitely worth it.  Speaking of theatre, google charleston theatres if you're into shows like that."
Charleston,3018v2,zeeginganinja,4,Mon Mar 23 20:15:35 2015 UTC,"Even though I enjoy Charleston, I think that this explains why I wasn't in love with it like so many people. I'm just not huge into the drinking scene. Its fun every once in awhile but it's too expensive to enjoy."
Charleston,3018v2,Rhyno08,3,Mon Mar 23 19:55:58 2015 UTC,Yeah.. I definitely liked Charleston wayyyyyy more when I drank. Now it just feels a bit small and like my weekends are very repetitive.
Charleston,3018v2,zeeginganinja,2,Mon Mar 23 20:31:46 2015 UTC,"When I was living there, I would change it up by exploring the beaches and nature parks and stuff.

Charleston,3018v2,Chickdey,2,Mon Mar 23 21:39:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I kind of got that feeling already. Bars are more fun with a group, but drinking and talking to one person all night, even if it's my wonderful husband, puts me to sleep pretty quickly. Thank you for all the suggestions though! I think I will look into some more tours. Ghost tour could be entertaining, maybe if it's later at night there won't be a bunch of families."
Charleston,3018v2,mrburnside,3,Mon Mar 23 18:31:51 2015 UTC,"There is one tour that's adults only.. I think through Bulldog Tours. It talks about the history of prostitution and ""rated R"" activities in the city, it was a good one! And no kids."

Charleston,3018v2,Megmonster5,2,Mon Mar 23 23:25:27 2015 UTC,"Not so much of a suggestion as an anti-suggestion.  This weekend is bridge run weekend.  When I used to live downtown this was probably my most dreaded weekend.  Traffic gets terrible and most restaurants are slammed.  That being said, with the huge influx of people this weekend, there are lots of tourist activities (when they aren't booked) available.  This is the weekend we would usually go somewhere out of town for a bit.  Now that we moved to Summerville, Bridge Run weekend is also Flowertown weekend and although it isn't nearly as many people Summerville doesn't offer too many more attractions other than Flowertown itself (not saying it doesn't have anything else)  TLDR Lots of stuff going on this weekend, but everything is going to be packed because of Bridge Run."

Charleston,2zq791,onelasttime,-12,Sat Mar 21 03:11:19 2015 UTC,"A preface: I cannot speak for tourists. Otherwise...  You seem to want special attention because you ride a bike...not going to happen. That's absolutely ridiculous. I like riding a bike. I think the ability to get around on a bike is cool. But roads are not designed for you, so placate massa. Ride by the rules of the road or shut the fuck up. You're not special.  Bicyclists, which are not the same as cyclists, are great, but they also are known to borrow too much from the entitled generation/crowd. And honestly, those people need to be mowed down like an Occupy Wall Street protest. Not saying you're one, just saying you're not ENTITLED to bicycle, just the same as someone is not ENTITLED to drive. Follow the rules of the road and we're all good.  Cyclists are a different story. I respect some. I don't respect those that ride in the road when there is a perfectly designed alternative (like a fucking footpath/bikepath designed for you off of the road like Palmetto Commerce Parkway). That just irks me. These assholes need to be knocked into the adjacent swampland and go missing for a few days. If I was riding a bike down the PCP, why the hell would I not get on that bike path and ride in the street? Why would I not try and be nice to the majority and not be a complete asshole and ride in the street for no fucking reason? I do not get it."
Charleston,2zq791,waxingpsychotic,8,Sat Mar 21 03:18:24 2015 UTC,"That ""bike path"" on Palmetto Commerce is a sidewalk, for pedestrians not bikes.  Here is a refresher for how the law is written:  SECTION 56-5-3430. Riding on roadways and bicycle paths.  (A) Except as provided in subsection (B), every bicyclist operating a bicycle upon a roadway shall ride as near to the right side of the roadway as practicable. A bicyclist may, but is not required to, ride on the shoulder of the roadway in order to comply with the requirements of this subsection.  Many of those cyclists choose to ride in the street because the sidewalks are much harder on the very thin tires they ride on.  There is also not always a paved way onto a sidewalk from the road, this is true on PCP as well, and many bikes are not designed to go off roading.  Further more, the law says that they are allowed to be in the road......  BTW, PCP is double laned in both directions with very little traffic, is it really that difficult to change lanes and pass a cyclist without wanting to drive them off the road?"
Charleston,2zq791,bruthaman,-5,Sat Mar 21 12:12:53 2015 UTC,If you read the actual plans for PCP it's the 4 foot wide riding and walking path.  The same is expected for Future Road and the same for Weber Industrial Road.  Use it.  I do change lanes because I don't want to get sued by one of you faggots.  But it doesn't make you not one of the assholes.
Charleston,2zq791,waxingpsychotic,7,Sat Mar 21 15:22:59 2015 UTC,"I don't have a bike, just have respect for others who have the same rights to use the road as I do in my car.  I am quite certain that someone who thinks those asshole faggots should be run off the road and into the swamp would not understand that they live on this planet with other individuals, and that you do not in fact have any greater rights than others to use a road as you believe it should be used.  Regardless of the PCP plans, that does not change how the law reads, and they still have the same right to use that road in the way the law allows."
Charleston,2zq791,bruthaman,-5,Sat Mar 21 17:46:37 2015 UTC,"I will never run anyone off the road.  But you thinking that some aren't better than others is naive. Not talking race, nor religion. If I knew a cyclist, I'd be making fun of them constantly. It's the American way!"
Charleston,2zq791,waxingpsychotic,2,Sat Mar 21 18:07:41 2015 UTC,But you thinking that some aren't better than others is naive.   I disagree. Cyclists aren't better than motorists just because they cause less pollution and require less public space for storage.

Charleston,2zq791,waxingpsychotic,2,Sat Mar 21 20:40:52 2015 UTC,"You seem to want special attention because you ride a bike...not going to happen. That's absolutely ridiculous.    Personally, I don't do much cycling these days, nor even own a bike (whereas I do own a car).   More importantly, I was not pleading for special rights for cyclists - just the opposite, I was pointing out the double standard that exists against cyclists. Cyclists are the only legal group of road users whose very existential legitimacy is tied to their behavior in common rhetoric. As far as I can tell, they are large numbers of scofflaw pedestrians and motorists (whose misbehavior is almost always far more  dangerous in spite of often seeming more subtle) but no one suggests that pedestrians or motorists should be prohibited from large portions of the transportation system (freeways notwithstanding).   But roads are not designed for you, so placate massa.    Using the past to dictate current transportation policy would be a mistake. The streets of downtown Charleston sure as hell weren't designed for cars, but we have no problem letting them dominate there.   Bicyclists, which are not the same as cyclists, are great, but they also are known to borrow too much from the entitled generation/crowd.

Why would I not try and be nice to the majority and not be a complete asshole and ride in the street for no fucking reason? I do not get it.   I've never seen anyone make a distinction between ""bicyclists"" and ""cyclists."" In the cycling and transportation communities, the terms ""commuter cycling"" and ""recreational cycling"" are used to differentiate in the way I think you're getting at. You can use words however you like, but I don't think that's generally the accepted terminology."
Charleston,2zq791,onelasttime,-6,Sat Mar 21 19:51:22 2015 UTC,Use /s if you're going to be sarcastic. No one said anything about the past. There is a difference. Bicyclists are those using bicycles as a mode of transportation.  Cyclists are girly men in tight shorts riding for exercise.

(I'm assuming you're referring to another comment, since there was nothing sarcastic in the one you're replying to here)   No one said anything about the past   For any given road, the design of the road occurred in the past.

Charleston,2zm75y,superrad102,3,Thu Mar 19 23:20:58 2015 UTC,"It has been an experience, and I have done some really fun things but I really love Charleston. I forgot how hard winters are!  I am still finding my groove here.  I moved in November. I am prone to anxiety and there is no better place to just mellow out than Charleston.  I worked in Mount P, and if I had a bad day of work I would just go for a quick walk on the beach.  I really miss that.  Once the weather warms up I am excited to take advantage of more of the parks."
Charleston,2zm75y,inventorjoe,2,Fri Mar 20 01:36:03 2015 UTC,"Agreed - I'm from MA originally and spent time in both Boston and Providence (and Portsmouth and Portland) and realized I like small cities more than living out in the country and more than the big cities. But there are sacrifices. I mentioned the lack of Portuguese food. It just means I make it at home. There is no where on the planet that's a paradise - whether weather, economy, bugs, or something else - you just have to find a place that has what you want and that it's not the place that sucks - it's just not what you want.

We plan to return sometime later this year.  Just not in the heat of the summer.  My question is about the television show Southern Charm.  It does NOT put that group of Charlestonians in a good light.  I cringe at most of them.  And, yet, I continue to watch.  It's a guilty pleasure.  Do you fine the people represented in the show are typical at all for young (and not so young) partiers of Charleston?  Your city looks lovely in the show, and the restaurants look good."
Charleston,2zm75y,ro4snow,6,Thu Mar 19 22:38:40 2015 UTC,"I've only seen one episode, but it represents the people of Charleston about as much as Paris Hilton represents the typical New Yorker ... just my opinion."

Visible, but small. Like anywhere else there are poor, middle-class, and wealthy and, through some volunteer work I've done down here, I've had the opportunity with some of the wealth there are some very philanthropic folks and I'm sure they're not pleased by the image some of these people cast on the city and native Charlestonians. The show is still a guilty pleasure for many here, though. I haven't seen it (no cable and little time to watch), but I wouldn't judge the people anywhere by what you see on TV. But, yes, the city is beautiful and the restaurants are great!  Thanks!"
Charleston,2zm75y,ro4snow,-2,Fri Mar 20 00:34:56 2015 UTC,"This will simply explain how the show is different:  All alcohol is paid for by the show.  I think many of us would not resist an open bar with friends. And we'd probably look pretty stupid, too.  The show is also setup. My place of employment enjoys happy hours at one of the locations they filmed at last year and they were telling them what to talk about.  Nonetheless, I find the show entertaining!"
Charleston,2zm75y,waxingpsychotic,2,Thu Mar 19 22:42:03 2015 UTC,"Ah, good info.  I'm surprised the production company has enough money to keep that crowd in alcohol!  I guess it is like every other reality show, where conversations are set up and situations are contrived.  It is entertaining, but if I were any of them, I wouldn't be proud of my behavior.  But I don't understand why most of the reality television performers would be on any of the shows."

Charleston,2zhubm,niamhellen,18,Wed Mar 18 22:54:26 2015 UTC,"I'm a young woman who got married to my husband very early, and enjoys spending tonnes of my Summer days at  the beach.  I also am from England, have been to and lived in over 5 countries, own 2 successful businesses in my early 20s, love big cities, am not religious nor do I eat meat or really like southern food. I won't hunt or fish and god kill me if you ever catch me in paisley or wearing a monogrammed purse.  I still LOVE Charleston. Yes there are some ""boring"" people here, but you have to spend more than 6 months anywhere to find your people and to find the specific places you like.  Being worldly, independent, and the most not-southern person ever, and genuinely feeling that Charleston is my ""home"" are not mutually exclusive to me. The place you live becomes what you make of it, and it didn't take much for me to love it here."
Charleston,2zhubm,Pseudonova,17,Wed Mar 18 19:15:48 2015 UTC,"This article has carried it through with far more snark than Charleston deserves, but after living there for 7 years, I totally feel where she's coming from. I didn't hate Charleston, but the points she raised all struck a chord with me, especially when it comes to natural diversity. After you've seen countless identical swamps and beaches, it all just becomes kind of... meh. If you aren't into killing things, and can't afford a surfboard or canoe, it gets boring.   As far as cultural diversity, I don't think it is a lack of cultural diversity that is the problem, but a strong resentment of diversity where it exists. People who are lifers don't play well with others in my experience.  Her friend archetype sounds just like all the people I hung out with. I was able to carve out my niche and get to know a ton of great people, but that does require one to actually try new things and be flexible. It doesn't happen in 6 months.   She's way off on the food though. Yes, there are a stupid amount of identical southern food restaurant. But there is a ton of other stuff too! McCrady's, FIG, The Grocery, Halls, Stars, I could list a ton of places that aren't ""southern"" food and are world class restaurants. You'll find whatever food you desire in Charleston. Hell there's even an Ethiopian place now. Food and bev. is the best part about Charleston, so she should get out there and look. And don't be so quick to judge the folks who would be able to spit in your food."
Charleston,2zhubm,czarrie,18,Wed Mar 18 20:05:17 2015 UTC,"As a lifer ...   I've known a lot of people who don't like it here, there's a lot to not like. The summers are damn near unbearable. Public transportation is laughable. Pay vs cost-of-living here is tough unless you bought your home 15 years ago. The beaches are crowded with bad parking, poor access and the water looks like a septic backup - it's actually really clean pollution wise though. Almost everything here is more expensive than any place nearby - even groceries cost more in Charleston! And don't even get me started on mosquitoes, roaches, and pollen.   But as someone who was born, raised, moved away and returned -  I love Charleston. Because I was born here, most of my friends are 'from' here as well, but I've met a lot of people who moved here from somewhere else. I'm actually amazed by the number of people I meet out who when they find out I'm from here, I'm the first person they've met from Charleston and they've been living here for years.   Landscape diversity - dead on correct - tis flat and marshy. As far as cultural diversity goes, you couldn't be more wrong about the ""not playing well with others"".   In general, you're not going to see a lot of Indian, Japanese, Filipino, Iranian or others at the $8 a drink bars downtown and in general, not at any bars. But I went to school with a lot of Filipino, Iranian, Korean, Guatemalan, Puerto Rican and Vietnamese. I've eaten more lumpia than grits, more kimchi than collards, and more tadik than banana pudding. Diversity is here, but it's more in the background than a highlight. I can easily see how most people new to Charleston wouldn't see it, mainly because it's not downtown. If you grew up in almost any part of Charleston, other than the penninsual, I am willing to bet you know enough Tagalog to know when the girl at the movie theater is talking shit about her boyfriend. You probably know some Farsi too and know that the best croissants you'll ever have are made by the Agapours and remember when his wife was on town-council. You probably first had kimchi in your elementary lunch room where you traded it for that octagon pizza or tatter-tots (I hate tatter-tots). And you know how awesome a bowl of hot rice, a raw egg and some soy sauce can be for breakfast. I make better carnitas and arepas than you've probably ever had, unless you're from Venezuela, because aerpa flour isn't easy to find here. Most of the schools I went to growing up, being white was the minority, but we were poor and maybe poor people just make friendlier neighbors. I didn't have most of these experiences on playgrounds or lunchrooms, but at people's houses. I loved all the things I wouldn't have seen otherwise, I'm still not a fan of the duck blood pudding - sorry Mrs. Suarez!   Maybe, I'm the exception, but from my experience, all of the people I know aren't just open to other cultures and experiences, they crave it. And if you're poor and from Charleston, there's really not much of a cultural difference between being white or black, other than how likely you are to be pulled over after dark."
Charleston,2zhubm,mddawso,5,Thu Mar 19 00:08:28 2015 UTC,"I'm on board with the niche assessment. You have to really make your own group of friends if you come here as an outsider ...and typically those will be outsiders. I moved here four years ago from MB and while it's certainly much more alive than the Grand Strand, for such a big metro it's very easy to feel incredibly isolated."

Charleston,2zhubm,HangerSteak,16,Wed Mar 18 23:53:37 2015 UTC,"In this case I think the furor is due to the general tone of of her 'article.' It's not hard to imagine with comments like this (among many)...   How do people sustain themselves here? I guess they have kids. But what about the rest of us who never made “wife” an end goal?   that some people are going to take offense.  I'll quote what I said down below as my final take away....   Charleston isn't right for everyone, but blaming the shoe because your foot is the wrong size is stupid.   edit: stop downvoting the above comment. It's a good question."
Charleston,2zhubm,inventorjoe,8,Wed Mar 18 20:29:53 2015 UTC,"There's a difference between saying ""this place isn't for me"" or ""I don't fit in here"" versus listing reasons why a place sucks, especially when half of the reasons are completely subjective and the other half are nonsense."
Charleston,2zhubm,inventorjoe,8,Wed Mar 18 20:44:26 2015 UTC,"Did you read the article? It just amounted to her bashing Charleston. It's fine if it's not for you, but she pretty much complained about everything about Charleston instead of just understanding it wasn't her type of town. Not to mention, that many of the things she said, simply aren't true and come from a very secluded view of Charleston. Saying there's nothing to do here, and the food is all southern food. That's just silly. I'd be completely ok with someone not liking this place, as I have my own dislikes."
Charleston,2zhubm,HangerSteak,4,Wed Mar 18 20:46:55 2015 UTC,"Who's getting angry? We're just refuting her points. There are commenters on the blog being idiots, but I've never read a blog post that didn't have stupid comments."

And I gave my own reasoning up there as to why the article could make people mad. It generalizes not only the city but the people who live there. Instead of saying that she couldn't be happy or make a life for herself here, the author instead says that there's something wrong with the city or the people and that's why she's happy to leave. People don't like being told there's something wrong with where they live because where you live tends to reflect on you as a person. Not to mention that the people are one of the main reasons she wants to leave, and by lumping most people here together, she is stating that there's something wrong with Charlestonians in general.    Does this answer your question as to why some people would get angry or take offense?"
Charleston,2zhubm,Protuhj,3,Wed Mar 18 21:05:53 2015 UTC,"Some people don't care what anyone thinks. Some people care greatly about the opinions of others. Most people are a mix between the two. I'm not ""angry"" because of what this person wrote but I do take some offense to being told in no uncertain terms that there's something wrong with the place I grew up.    It would be like if I moved into your neighborhood that you grew up in and loved. Then I told you that your neighborhood sucks, that your neighbors suck, and that I'm moving out because I can't stand to be somewhere so terrible and surrounded by terrible people. You might say ""I don't know you and I don't care what you think"" but it's not very hard to understand that the person living next to you would think, ""Hey, I like where I live and I like my neighbors! Fuck you, buddy!"" But like you said, to each their own. Hopefully I answered the question well enough that you might understand this behavior a little bit better in the future."
Charleston,2zhubm,HangerSteak,6,Wed Mar 18 21:08:08 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I'm not angry, just rustled.   As someone who also grew up here, most of it is just completely wrong. I have no idea where she was living, but it isn't any place I've ever lived in Charleston. I grew up in Chicorah, Union Heights, Hannahan, and James Island. Hell, most of the people I know who've lived here for years don't even know where Chicorah and Union Heights are other than strip-clubs and chemical plants.

Any type of food, I can think of a restaurant I prefer here over that type of food in Atlanta. Now, have I eaten EVERYWHERE? no, but I guarantee this girl hasn't either if she is saying southern food is her only option.   Furthermore, her argument about being able to travel an hour or so and visit other places....well, there is a little town called Savannah that's what, an hour and a half away? I love Charleston, but Savannah is a much prettier city I think, and there's tons to do there. You could also hit up Columbia (god forbid) in about 2 hours if you wanted to check out something more ""city"" like.   But honestly, this just sounds like someone wanting to bash something popular. Her statement about hipsters here being boring kind of gives that away....I bet this person hasn't been anywhere outside of downtown by these statements, and that's not anyway to judge a city (by one part of it).  OH, and dating? well yes, girls outnumber guys here. It's NOT a good place for straight women to date. It's a good place for straight MEN to date. Whoever told her differently is an idiot.  *oh and one other thing, people here are very active. There are always things to do (so much so, that I find myself planning weekends where I'm not doing anything instead of the other way around). The weather makes it so easy to go outside. Join a kickball team, go see a sports game (hockey, baseball, etc), go rent a kayak, go camping, go check out a festival somewhere (we seem to always have one going on)...we have trivia leagues, we even have skeeball leagues...or just google ""charleston events""...honestly if you run out of things to do, that's entirely your own fault."

To me, this is what makes us beautiful. You know what isn’t like that? Charleston.  People here don’t even like to leave their own island, never mind posses a sense of adventure to get out of Dodge for a bit. But they sure do like going out on a boat. Every. Single. Weekend.   Given those two quotes, I take it the lack of diversity she encountered came from a lack of personal adventure on her part. If you don't leave the well to do parts of downtown you're only going to get what you get out of charleston. Personally I know very few people who own boats, and even fewer who dress like those pictured in her article.   In addition, I made a dire error when reading about the demographics of the city. When it said 100,000 people, I didn’t realize I’d move from a city of 7 million people in Atlanta to 100,000 residents scattered about historic Charleston and multiple islands.   That's just a lack of understanding of what population density is/means... She should be embarrassed, not angry."

If you disagree with anything anyone has posted, they're obviously a racist.  They debate one of your postings, they're racist as well.  You're nothing more than a militant troll on a power trip.

Charleston,2zhubm,slowloadinggif,-6,Wed Mar 18 19:27:39 2015 UTC,"""Many"" students constitutes what? That there exists a population that can be considered many? What criteria are you using? In any case, it's exactly 80% white and 90% male. That's not that diverse. And yes, that exactly looks nearly all white to me when the next significant group is only 7%.  And I never said it's white.

The most evidence I see are some girls wearing t-shirts with their letters on them, or at the beginning of semesters guys coming to class in ties and jackets.  I don't even see much in the way of greek life activities.  And yes, it is a majority white population, but there's students from so many different areas of the country (or other countries) that there's a huge culture variety.

If there are two applicants applying for a <insert field here> position, one with 2 years experience and one with 5 years experience, guess who's getting hired and who's not. When you live in a desirable place, this is what any job market is like. People want in and the filling of positions gets quite selective for professional positions.  Let's look at that 60% you mention. Did they make the incredibly stupid decision to move here before getting a job? Or did they make the incredibly stupid decision to get a tech degree and stay here? People should really study markets before they get into anything.  Also, in my experience with the tech industry here, there are plenty of jobs. You just have to learn the market in order to get your foot in the door. For example, Benefitfocus is always hiring and has tons of positions available, adding more and more each day. They don't advertise it well and they don't hire efficiently. But if you know to get hired at a temp service first and work there when they beef up temp labor in September, you'd land a job there in February.  I'm sorry, but I've been around the block to know the ""I've submitted my GLORIOUS RESUME everywhere and I never get a callback"" is utter bullshit. If they want you, they'll hire you.

Pretty solid beer selection, though everything is $1-2 more than you'd like, but worth checking out. Closed For Business - though I'd recommend daytime not evening as it gets annoyingly crowded. Proof The Craftsmen Mellow Mushroom - Best downtown beer selection, bar is upstairs, also have an outdoor patio   Also, Edmunds Oast is definitely great as /u/Collardgrace indicated, but it's not in the heart of downtown.

Charleston,2zgjmo,GahWtf1336,7,Wed Mar 18 12:08:52 2015 UTC,"Bring a [black?] umbrella and do the cemetery/gate walk downtown -- a cloudy day would be very fitting for it. Grab those boiled peanuts to-go, and drive to the Angel Oak tree on Johns Island. The drive is as much of a destination as is the destination itself.  Schedule a ghost or pirate tour if you're looking for museums. They will show you some neat places downtown, like Anne Bonny's house, the small slave and torture museum, and the old dungeon. Again, a raincoat or umbrella may be necessary, but a perfectly fine activity for Charleston in spring. Or just drive. Find the scenic highways and the majestic oaks with hanging Spanish moss will be impressive in itself. Ideas are Hwy 61 West Ashley to Summerville, Riverland Drive on James Island (close to Folly -- and there's a really awesome county park you could visit for $1 on that road), or Longpoint Rd. in Mt. Pleasant that takes you to Boone Hall Plantation (also a county park on that road with beautiful marsh walks). Charleston lends itself to outdoor activities, so finding rainy day options are few and far between, unless you're just up for a progressive dining experience through downtown."

Charleston,2zef48,Halome,6,Tue Mar 17 22:03:05 2015 UTC,"I think I-26 and I-526 can be fixed by a simple action.  If you are driving in the left lane and there are more than 2 cars behind you, instant ticket for impeding the flow of traffic.     As it stands now, people will camp in the left lane going less than the speed limit.  This results in having to pass these morons in the middle or right lane which is dangerous and shouldn't be required.  Left lane is for passing"
Charleston,2zef48,jiml78,2,Wed Mar 18 12:04:34 2015 UTC,I agree the people just toodling along in the left lane don't help the situation and the frequency of this has lead to another issue where drivers don't even provide an opportunity for somebody to get over. I've been driving 10-20mph over the speed limit in the left lane when another driver comes barreling down on me and merges to the right to pass me before I ever get a chance to move for them.
Charleston,2zef48,DruPDrawers,1 point,Wed Mar 18 13:54:16 2015 UTC,"Keep right unless you're passing no matter what - pretty simple. Be attentive - if you're actively passing, but you see someone barreling down on you then put on your blinker on to let them know you'll get over when you can."
Charleston,2zef48,danceswithsquirrelz,1 point,Fri Mar 20 16:17:13 2015 UTC,A directional to show intent to get over goes a long way in any situation. You shouldn't just be riding in the left lane almost ever.
Charleston,2zef48,faildata,1 point,Sat Mar 21 14:56:47 2015 UTC,"Dude, arbitrarily made up rules aren't going to change a thing; people slow down because merging is a human process that takes some guessing between the drivers of each car. You can't just demand that people just step on it, reaction times have finite limits on them.  We need reliable and frequent bussing in the morning for people who commute. That takes cars off the road."
Charleston,2zef48,enjoyscuriosity,2,Thu Mar 19 05:31:19 2015 UTC,"No where did I say the merging issue is solved with my suggestion.  Btw, it isn't an arbitrary rule.  It is currently the law.  If you are driving down i-26 I'm the left lane with 5 cars held up behind you, you can be ticketed.  It just isn't enforced.  To see a million examples just drive to Columbia.  People think the left lane is for anything but passing.  My suggestion is for relieving huge backups on the interstate outside of rush hour traffic."
Charleston,2zef48,jiml78,-1,Thu Mar 19 09:41:08 2015 UTC,"Law makers fucking suck. Congress is filled with a bunch of fucking idiots less than ourselves. ""oh, this will fix it, give them tickets""-no. W need to put buses on the fucking road!"
Charleston,2zef48,enjoyscuriosity,2,Thu Mar 19 12:16:23 2015 UTC,"I hate to break it to you but the left lane is for passing.  If you camp in the left lane, you are part of the problem.  You are impeding traffic.  This has nothing to do with Congress.  Congress isn't making SC traffic laws.    As for your buses comment, you obviously have zero clue about mass transportation.  Charleston is the epitome of sprawl without highly dense populations.    A bigger busing system is not going to solve shit because people in Charleston are not going to take the bus.  Except in the downtown area.  The area is too spread out.    I hate to tell you but the only thing that is going to save us is automated cars.  Getting drivers out from behind the wheel will greatly solve the problem.  We have some of the worst drivers in the country."
Charleston,2zef48,jiml78,-1,Thu Mar 19 12:24:11 2015 UTC,"| Charleston is the epitome of sprawl without highly dense populations.  No, Charleston is the epitome of shitty commute times because of an ass load of cars on the highway. And of the mass sport that we call ramming cars into the ass of the next one directly in front of us. (I mean fucking really, how do you even fuck that up? And so disastrously bad? There a wreck every week. Multiple times a week even. Shit dude, and EVERY FUCKING SC driver has to  stop and look OMFG if we had bus drivers this shit wouldn't happen, because they would just mash the gas.)   And why are you coming to the defense of the city or congress?! I hate traffic and I hate congress. If you don't want buses, you've clearly never lived somewhere where traffic is visibly affected by public transportation. Public transportation is fucking awesome when it works, no one rides Charleston buses because there's like two, they have funding enough just to cart around the retards of the city, and barely any else.   Automated cars are way the hell away, buses are now, that's why I want them. Google has the best engineers in the world, they still have problems that require human intervention, and it's really freaking hard to solve the shit they're trying to solve. Automated cars have been here, why do you think they haven't been adopted yet? Because you know what it would take to get those legalized? An act of Congress. Which isn't going to happen! So, buses."

Your argument is ""buses"".  That is enough to know you don't have a clue what you are talking about.  We do not have the population density to support a robust public transportation system using buses.  Automated cars are about 10 years out.  But they are far more viable than your unsupportable ""buses"".    There is an economic reason there aren't more buses.  There is no market for it.  If there was a market to make money with buses, we would have buses."
Charleston,2zef48,jiml78,1 point,Thu Mar 19 17:45:58 2015 UTC,"Dude, You're probably just a lifer, and this kind of bias is exactly why we don't have public transportation!  Visit Seattle or Dallas or New York and you'll see how much of a difference buses make. Logical argument? Yeah, because Charleston is some bus immune city, where if we actually had buses that would arrive regularly and help people commute to populous destinations people would just obstinately sit in traffic instead. More like everyone here would rather sit in traffic than bother giving a shit about politics long enough to solve a problem. I bet it just gets so fucking bad that the city is forced to fix it. Then everybody will be like ""Damn we should have done this a long ass time ago"".  The absence of a product doesn't prove much if anything at all outright. That's like saying if the IPhone wasn't it means that there's no market for that technology, it's akin to ""if there is no rain then there's no clouds argument""-it can be vacuously true dude."

I have traveled all around the world.  I personally love public transportation.  Do you actually think we are Seattle, Dallas, or NYC?  Seriously?  Again, POPULATION DENSITY.  You obviously have no idea what those two words mean.  As to your final argument about the iPhone.  There are tons of companies that run bus systems.  We don't have one because there isn't a population to support it here."
Charleston,2zef48,jiml78,1 point,Thu Mar 19 18:07:40 2015 UTC,"There is a commute problem, we don't need a huge population. Who would prefer to sit in traffic? Riding a bus saves time and money!

Charleston,2zef48,enjoyscuriosity,4,Thu Mar 19 18:09:30 2015 UTC,"This won't change overnight. It will get worse, trust me. Tourism is king here, so resources are spent downtown. (That's why it's so frequent you see a cop pull someone over just as they break the law downtown). Lack of resources and money for hwy patrolling. Plus the IDGAF attitude we have here in Charleston."
Charleston,2zef48,Chs2014,6,Tue Mar 17 23:40:42 2015 UTC,"I don't know that it's resources, I think you were closer with attitude. When an officer watches a blatant infraction and does nothing, they're not lacking resources,  they're just not doing their jobs."
Charleston,2zef48,AlexEatsKittens,4,Wed Mar 18 02:27:12 2015 UTC,"I would also argue that the reinstatement and proper regulation of vehicle inspections would help immensely. Some of the shit I see on the roads broken down, blocking traffic, etc would have NEVER passed back where I'm from. Everyone talks about how they got rid of it because the system was so corrupt but that's no excuse. Reinstate and clean up a lot of the shitbox vehicles and maybe people will be more cognizant about maintaining their vehicles and not snarling traffic because it's barely running."

Charleston,2zef48,waxingpsychotic,5,Tue Mar 17 23:30:58 2015 UTC,I think the people rubbernecking should get a ticket. 526 was stop and go yesterday because of a minor accident that wasn't even blocking the road. It's so stupid it doesn't make sense.

Charleston,2zef48,wingmanly,1 point,Wed Mar 18 11:40:20 2015 UTC,"I agree completely, that is the heart of the problem. I've watched so many traffic infractions with a police officer in sight result in nothing that it doesn't even really surprise me anymore.  I've wondered about this, and the only thing I can come up with is that it's because this is a tourist town and the cities don't want to sour people's opinions or experiences by giving them tickets. Perhaps they expect they'll get more in tax revenue from repeat visits than they would from a traffic citation. A lot of tourists are from small cities and really can't handle driving in even our mild traffic, but the rest is pure conjecture.   This is really a public safety issue and something we as citizens of the area should be holding our police and elected officials responsible for."

Charleston,2zemdy,Chs2014,5,Tue Mar 17 23:02:56 2015 UTC,"This sub really pushes Park Circle and Avondale a lot, but I'm a huge fan of downtown. You actually have a bit of a leg up on a lot of apartments because some of the nicer ones won't rent to undergrads. If I were you, I'd be looking in Harleston Village or SOB. There are quite a few good parks for dogs around there - Cannon Park on Rutledge, the big fields on Ashley Ave at Broad, the dog park on E Bay, and Colonial Lake. $1500 will get you a nice place down that way, and its walkable or bikeable to everything."

Charleston,2zemdy,danceswithsquirrelz,2,Wed Mar 18 01:54:13 2015 UTC,"For some one single and street smart Park Circle area is amazing as far as events going on, and easy walk or bicycle ride to east montague, easy commute to the tanger outlet area, and I dont know what traffic is unless I'm stupid enough to leave north charleston towards summerville or towards downtown during rush hour.  That said if you are looking for more of the city feel and being down town close to everything might be a better fit for what you are looking for."
Charleston,2zemdy,communistwookie1,2,Wed Mar 18 00:22:38 2015 UTC,"I'd say Avondale could work for you, especially if you look in the Byrnes Downs neighborhood - can definitely get a 2BR with a yard for the dog and an easy walk to the bars/restaurants, a quick drive downtown, and it's easy to get to 526 to get to NC."
Charleston,2zemdy,redbirdjr,1 point,Wed Mar 18 02:08:21 2015 UTC,"Depending on where in Avondale you don't even ever have to take 526 depending on where you work. Since most rush hour traffic is concentrated getting on and off of 526, I actually find it faster and less blood boiling to just take St. Andrews to Sam Rittenberg/cosgrove and hop on 26. Staying on the St Andrews side seems to avoid the bulk of the Ashley River Rd congestion too. Of course this isn't fail proof, but I find myself hating my life less than when venturing on to 526."
Charleston,2zemdy,Halome,1 point,Wed Mar 18 14:52:41 2015 UTC,"If you're on the south side of 17 (such as where I am in Byrnes Doens) it can be a royal PITA to get over to St Andrews, so for me the 17 to 526 (reverse commute from everyone going into downtown) is actually pretty easy. YMMV depending on the time of day, I'm sure."
Charleston,2zemdy,redbirdjr,2,Wed Mar 18 15:03:55 2015 UTC,"Aah yeah, I didn't even think of that, when I get stuck that way I'm usually on 171 already coming the right way from the park so I just see the glob getting on to 17 for just a little bit and it's tolerable. I always forget not many of the residential  streets open up to an intersection, let alone one with a signal too. I Can see that being crappy.  I actually live in the neck right now and commute south. The pleasure of working nights with a bit of a commute means if i don't leave my house right at 4:40 or earlier I'll hit the 526 offramp stack up to 17 plus the line of people going home on Johns Island.  I'll still take them over being suspended and stuck in the air on 526 for undetermined amounts of time, hah.  I"
Charleston,2zemdy,Halome,2,Thu Mar 19 05:29:37 2015 UTC,"While I agree with many that Park Circle is probably a pretty balanced blend of active but introvert friendly for you based on what you're saying, I actually think leaning more to Avondale would be good.  Reasons: you're single and you've got Charleston Community Yoga right there. Lots of those ladies are from the area or hang out around and most are friendly, lovely, and potentially single (if you're open to that).   More importantly though- your dog!  A lot of the best dog friendly areas are right there!  It's near the green way and the bike way.  You can take your dog to the swimming pool .  The James Island County Park with the dog park right there.  Folly is not too terribly far.  The Barrel is fairly close by (often has a higher girl:guy presence too!)  So even if you're not more on the social side you've got a lot more options in the vicinity to get out and you have not only an ice breaker with your dog but a buddy to hang out with and avoid that potentially awkward feeling of being a party of one."

Charleston,2zdp72,Ifeex,3,Tue Mar 17 18:55:24 2015 UTC,"The schools are pretty good, Hannahan high has plenty of sports and extracurricular activities if you have any kids around that age. Watch what side you live on. The north Charleston side can get pretty sketchy, stay towards the Goose Creek side if you can. It's a good location. Rivers Avenue is a short drive away with anywhere you want to eat and the typical shopping stores. It's not the safest place to live, but not the most dangerous. The cops are hard asses (and making the National news recently with arresting a drunk sheriff)."

However, if you work in West Ashley, Downtown or anywhere near the coast, the traffic to and from will make you lose your faith in humanity. What are you looking for specifically?"

Charleston,2zdp72,zeeginganinja,2,Tue Mar 17 19:44:38 2015 UTC,"I've met a couple of Boeing folks that live in Tanner Plantation and they seem to like it.  It's a nice area, but Rhett to 526 can get pretty busy in the mornings and evenings.  If you're most interested in proximity to Boeing then I think you could do worse than Hanahan.    Just stay away from Remount!"
Charleston,2zdp72,rainwaterh,2,Tue Mar 17 19:38:47 2015 UTC,"boring and cheap.  you're very close to both i26 and i526 so getting in and out is easy.  schools are better than the immediate surrounding area (because you're in berkeley county)  there's no restaurants or anything in hanahan itself, but you're a short drive to park circle or tanger  very convenient to trident technical college and the airbase  it's worth noting that none of this actually applies to the Tanner Plantation development off north rhett. It's a bit further from everything and prone to traffic choke points that don't effect ""old hanahan.""  I lived in hanahan for many years, if you have any particular questions feel free to ask."
Charleston,2zdp72,onesidedsquare,2,Tue Mar 17 21:13:00 2015 UTC,"Its not a bad area to live. Cheap because its far, the schools are decent, less sketchy than N Chas and less trashy than G Creek, and a bit boring yes. Not a far drive to North Charleston where you can access the mall and all the chain stores/restaurants you can imagine. A bit of a drive to downtown but not bad if you won't be working there and just go on the weekends. Too far if you want to be a beach bum, summer traffic will put you about an hour from Folly and 45 from the others."
Charleston,2zdp72,Chs2014,1 point,Tue Mar 17 19:43:00 2015 UTC,"Good information, thank you! I figured it couldn't be too bad of an area, considering I haven't seen anybody mention it here."

Charleston,2zeh28,waxingpsychotic,4,Wed Mar 18 00:19:35 2015 UTC,"Also, funny point, but if you're on a moped outside of downtown, it's probably because of your terrific wonderful ability to score DUIs!"
Charleston,2zeh28,zeeginganinja,5,Wed Mar 18 03:32:49 2015 UTC,"James Island or West Ashley would probably be a good fit for you. Anywhere in North Charleston will have you 45+ to Folly Beach, which is where people surf. And like someone else said, mopeds are legal here but the traffic doesn't really respond well to them.. Pretty much the only people who use them are doing it out of necessity (ahem, DUI)."
Charleston,2zeh28,danceswithsquirrelz,2,Wed Mar 18 01:34:22 2015 UTC,Sounds like you need to live downtown. Park Circle is right down the road from Boeing but it would be a long commute to Folly for surfing. Downtown would give you an easy work commute against traffic and is a lot closer to Folly (and the other beaches). Not to mention it would be a lot easier to go out and make friends there.
Charleston,2zeh28,Sara0322,1 point,Wed Mar 18 13:03:08 2015 UTC,any place off of Dorchester Road will be good if you're going to be doing the moped thing. It's a pretty long road lots of apartments and sub division.   Most of which is 45 mphs.  Straight shot to work. No turns. So u won't get lost.  What makes u want to live I  charleston so bad if you have never even been here before?  Where are you coming from?
Charleston,2zeh28,sethninja13,1 point,Thu Mar 19 02:36:41 2015 UTC,I doubt I'm going to be riding a moped judging from what other people have said. Thank you for the advice.  A fresh start in a setting completely different from anywhere else I've lived.

It only takes her maybe ten minutes or so to drive to and from work. I work in park circle and it takes me about fifteen or twenty minutes.   Folly beach is about 45 minutes away but it's a fairly simple drive.  I'd always be down to hang out when you make it out here. I'm a 24 yr old dude.

If you want to volunteer best place I would try is their website or contacting them by phone/email: http://scaquarium.org/strp/.

Do not think about commuting in a moped, it is extremely dangerous and drivers do not like them very much.  The roads are extremely poor and it takes SCDOT a while to repair pot holes.

Charleston,2ze7wz,Chs2014,2,Tue Mar 17 23:43:53 2015 UTC,"*edit- I didn't intend on this being so long, sorry! I need to go to bed...  Agree with Park Circle, and try to stay to the east side of it. Might go without saying if you're familiar with the area, but avoid Pine Crest on McMillan unless you're desperate and can't afford much.   The crime in this area is notorious, but inside the complex it's not as rampant or violent as right outside it. It usually isn't random either; I've yet to hear of something happening to the folks keeping a low but friendly profile. Seems to work for my husband and I thus far. As a matter of fact, my phone fell out of my gym bag the other day and had my debit card in it - when I returned, a teenager from across the parking lot ran it over to me. He had me call his grandma so she knew it made it back to the right person(I've never formally met the lady, but I've kinda gained a reputation with the little kids as the ""nice skinny white lady with the friendly dog and the zoo"", so that helps I guess.)  Not sure where in CCSD you're gonna work, but you get a valuable experience in perspective for many of the kids at the schools if you end up here, so there's a twisted positive from it. The company in charge is trying to make positive changes but there's LOTS of work to be done with only so much staff so expect no remorse when you move out if you are constantly reporting little stuff. The buildings are old, just take pictures when you move in of everything and document it all. If you it's cheap and can fix it yourself, just do it to save your sanity and your stress.  PS- Pro-tip for any old rentals in the area: No matter how clean it looks when you move in, bleach/seal/caulk/ and treat every crack and crevice in the place(EVERY! Especially cupboards!) before unpacking to keep the unwelcome pests from driving you insane come the cold season. They are inevitable but significantly easier to manage if you suck up the $50-60 for the supplies, and you'll sleep better at night!"

Charleston,2zbimc,Redbaron67,1 point,Tue Mar 17 12:31:00 2015 UTC,Last time I was there Triangle got rid of wings and now do drumsticks instead.
Charleston,2zbimc,wisertime07,2,Tue Mar 17 13:07:13 2015 UTC,"Yea, you may be right - I've gotten them a few times and it's a big bowl with 4-6 big ""wings"".  But to me, wings are drumsticks and actual wings.  I know - that's not really correct, but...  Yea - I think you're right.  They are good, but also a little larger - and probably not wings.  So, those probably don't count.    While we're on the subject of Triangle though - I forget what night it is, but Friday or Saturday I think, they have ribs for $1-$2 a piece.  That's where it's at!  As a huge bbq enthusiast and someone that spends way too much time perfecting his own barbecue recipes, I have to give Triangle credit for those things.  Tender, huge, meaty, cheap and delicious - about all I can ask for."
Charleston,2zbimc,Redbaron67,2,Tue Mar 17 13:15:14 2015 UTC,"The part that gets me is wings are suppose to be white meat, not dark meat......I love dark meat chicken but it was a little weird getting a bowl of drumsticks."

The McClellanville Shrimp Festival is cool, but it always falls on the same day as the Dragon Boat Race, so it loses out.  Aquapalooza used to be fun, before Joe squashed that.  I guess I need a definition as to what constitutes a festival around here.  But from now until the fall, our calendar is filled with awesome events."
Charleston,2zbh37,zeeginganinja,2,Tue Mar 17 12:33:23 2015 UTC,First I'm hearing of this AquaPalooza. What did Joe do to get that off the planner?
Charleston,2zbh37,t0mmski,2,Tue Mar 17 13:27:40 2015 UTC,"Well, it was a big music festival on the water - they take/took place nationwide and ours originally used to be at Morris Island and featured 6-8 bands playing on a barge they'd set up just off the island.  The partiers of MI had as much (or more) to do with it as Old Joe, but he basically decided no more of those shenanigans would be taking place on Morris.  They eventually moved it to the Wando River, off Daniel Island.  We went one year and it was a mess - the current was crazy strong and with no beach, everyone was just anchored and boats were banging into each other.  People were pissing off boats (where are they supposed to go?) and the drunks got out of hand.  I don't believe they had one last year and I haven't heard anything about one this year either.  Sad, those first couple years were a LOT of fun."
Charleston,2zbh37,zeeginganinja,2,Tue Mar 17 14:40:24 2015 UTC,"Love Spoleto. Such a great opportunity to see amazing acts, most small cities that are Charleston-sized never offer arts on that level.

They will still swarm around you but they won't crawl all over you. When your skin is no longer oily apply it again. I like this method because it's natural.  Also check out Thermacell.

No point of the peninsula is below sea-level; that is a myth propagated by carriage operators and will not die.      Here is an interactive map that shows approximate elevations and what flooding/tides will do to those areas.

That being said, I was only suggesting using it as a tool to compare elevations and not get into a climate change battle.  Since elevation is (for the most part) static, it means no difference as to whether 1' of water comes from heavy rains, storm surge or rising seas - nor whether those changes come in 24 hours or over the course of years.

An annual horse race in February attracted thousands of spectators.  During the closing days of the Civil War, the area was used as a prisoner-of-war camp. More than two hundred Union soldiers died in the camp and were buried in a mass grave at the site. Almost immediately after the hostilities, the bodies were exhumed and properly reburied. By late April 1865, a white picket fence on which was written ""The Martyrs of the Race Course"" had been erected. On May 1, 1865, thousands of people, mainly newly freed blacks, processed to the site, and members of the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry marched around the site. The graves were decorated, speeches were offered, and celebrants enjoyed picnics in the area. This has been cited as the first Memorial Day celebration."

Living downtown without a car isn't a big deal since the main bus lines can take you out of downtown if you want to go to places like Walmart or to see a movie or whatever, but in the area you're looking at the closest grocery stores would be BiLo on Spring and Meeting streets and Harris Teeter on East Bay. Both are a decent walk, especially if you're carrying groceries. But it's doable.  Good luck, and welcome to Charleston!"
Charleston,2yy17h,wd3war,4,Fri Mar 13 20:09:51 2015 UTC,I lived downtown at Queen and King in. 2013 and I literally never move my car except the drive home to visit my parents who lived about two hours away. I exclusively use my bike to get to work and do groceries. I probably drove a total of 200 miles that year in the city. It is 100% doable.

The other downtown options for grocery stores are either BiLo on Meeting St between Columbus St and Line St or the Food Lion on King St between Romney and Grove. Both of those are pretty far and not as clean/extensive as the Harris Teeter.   I'm curious as to what you were seeing in terms of the parking situation, a good amount of places around there either have driveway or street parking.

Charleston,2yy17h,my_candy_is_free,1 point,Fri Mar 13 20:18:44 2015 UTC,"The house we looked at. (7 montagu on zillow, which is adorable and my favorite) literally says 0 parking available. Is it cool to park on the street? I'll probably have to fight a college kid or pay for a garage."
Charleston,2yy17h,my_candy_is_free,1 point,Fri Mar 13 20:24:38 2015 UTC,"Hmm, being on Montagu Ct is a little trickier. Fwiw you need a parking permit to park longer than an hour on the street so the spots are usually filled with locals rather than tourists. That being said, since you're down that alley I'd imagine that there's less of a guarantee that you'd find a close parking spot every day. I'm not really sure, that's just my initial two cents"
Charleston,2yy17h,Tarmaque,0,Fri Mar 13 20:29:57 2015 UTC,"I assumed if we decide on a car, we would have to schill for a parking garage."
Charleston,2yy17h,dawhoo,1 point,Fri Mar 13 20:33:41 2015 UTC,"Usually if you live downtown, you can get a street permit for the district your apartment is in and be able to park on the street without a time limit as long as you are in that district. I would ask the landlord if there are permits available for that property."
Charleston,2yy17h,seanc92,1 point,Mon Mar 16 20:35:39 2015 UTC,"There's a small local grocery on the corner of Pitt and Montagu St.  If the same guy still runs it, he will stock items that you request.   Parking permits are required for onstreet parking, but they're cheap and gives you access to several blocks to park, which if you don't drive frequently, parking farther away will be a plus, because that area floods when it rains hard at high tide.   Local tip for living and shopping downtown, get a ""P-Tag"" so you can park in loading zones"
Charleston,2yy17h,NYC19893,1 point,Mon Mar 16 02:30:02 2015 UTC,"FYI, 7 Montagu is in the middle of college-rental central, so you'll likely live around a bunch of college kids since it's so close to campus. Might not be an issue, but you should know."
Charleston,2yy17h,bpwnz,0,Wed Mar 25 15:05:11 2015 UTC,I live on montagu as well! Moved here in January. Parking isn't bad. I hope you end up living there! It's absolutely beautiful.
Charleston,2yy17h,bpwnz,2,Sat Mar 14 01:31:52 2015 UTC,"I live downtown and don't have a car (not for lack of want due to some extenuating circumstances). The only problems are going for groceries, beach and the movie theaters. You can do all of those with the city bus but then your on their schedules.  Edit: I use bike as primary transport but if you get a car you depending on the area need a residential sticker to street park"
Charleston,2yy17h,wisertime07,2,Sat Mar 14 01:27:30 2015 UTC,"Plausible but not practical.  College kids can get away with it, but with a weak public transportation network here you'd be limited to walking and riding a bicycle. Even then you'd be constrained to the peninsula for all practical purposes. Cutting you off from a lot of retail & recreation in the surrounding areas.  tl;dr You'll want a car."
Charleston,2yy17h,wisertime07,2,Fri Mar 13 20:33:14 2015 UTC,"I figured. I guess it wouldn't be so bad for my so to have a car. He likes driving, but I never even bothered getting a license :("
Charleston,2yy17h,t0mmski,3,Fri Mar 13 20:36:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, charleston is an car city for sure. Even from downtown it's difficult to do something as simple as spend a day at the beach without a car. You can ride bicycles fairly easily from downtown out to sullivan's island, but toting everything you'd want to spend the day out there, then back, would be pushing the limits of what most people would want to do."
Charleston,2yy17h,arghyematey,1 point,Fri Mar 13 20:47:01 2015 UTC,"It's doable - get a Schwinn Meridian (trike) - it has a basket on the back and it's big enough to carry pretty much anything you need.  We've got Uber, the busses and the rickshaws.  That being said, you are going to eventually want a car - things are going to come up that'll require you to drive to West Ashley or Mount Pleasant and it's one of those things - you won't need one often, but when you need a car you need a car. Be careful though, it does flood down here - especially where you're looking at.  You probably want to get a small car, but not a car that's extremely low to the ground.  (Maybe a Sol, little Scion SUV or a small truck or something.)"
Charleston,2yy17h,arghyematey,2,Fri Mar 13 21:33:57 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the awesome reply! I had a bike I did some grocery shopping with and liked it, but we're looking into getting a car. If we're looking at a residential park area (c1?) does that mean only we can park on that street or will we have to fight for a spot?  This is making me just want to buy a condo with a parking spot."
Charleston,2yy17h,dawhoo,3,Fri Mar 13 22:07:35 2015 UTC,"No, I'd find a house - if you can find one that you like and within your price range.   I'll be honest, I live in Mount Pleasant, across the bridge from downtown.  But I'm only 5 minutes away and am down there almost every day.  Coming from NY, you're going to laugh at our traffic and parking situation - it sucks (to us), but it's feasible and realistically not that bad.  Plenty of spots offer monthly parking and you can get stickers from the city - if all the college kids find a way to do it, it can't be that difficult!  But as far as the specifics of what a ""C1"" sticker grants you, I honestly am not sure and don't want to give you false information.    When you buy into a condo though, you're going to be stuck with regime fees that can (and will) climb with little or no notice.  I've got friends that have condos and love them, but I have more friends that have condos that hate them.  Also, I'm not aware of many decent condos in the price range I think you're looking for - at least in the downtown market.  Most of them are more the luxury condos with water views, targeted toward the older crowd.  Find a house - you'll love it.  And look over toward Hampton Park area as well (where lots are larger and the houses all have driveways) - our downtown is pretty large and extremely varied - you'll find something you'll love, I promise!"

Charleston,2yy17h,ASACschrader,1 point,Fri Mar 13 23:36:40 2015 UTC,"You will want a car in Charleston. How else will you get to the beach???   Other than that, like others have said, you can absolutely live and work downtown without driving but the grocery store locations are tricky. you could still do it though... Just get a bike and go 2-3x per week. A bike is very helpful in Charleston anyway."
Charleston,2yy17h,tellevee,1 point,Sat Mar 14 02:31:04 2015 UTC,"It never occurred to me that people in charleston go to the beach regularly. I've only really paid attention to Downtown. Which beaches are best? My husband used to sail competitively, is sailing culture strong there? We may want to look into getting into a yacht club if they aren't too exclusive."
Charleston,2yy17h,ICreepsItReal,2,Sat Mar 14 03:54:00 2015 UTC,"Since somebody else knew more about sailing than I did, I will just comment on beaches.   I used to frequent Folly Beach. That is more of the party beach- that's where the surfers go and a lot of the college students so it can be a little more rowdy. I personally enjoyed the view of the area that we called ""the dunes""- if you take a left and follow that stretch of beach all the way down it can be a little more quiet and you can see the abandoned lighthouse. Don't swim there at that particular spot though, the beach drops off VERY quickly and the current can be kind of brutal. (I fell off the drop off once when I was in college, during a science lab field trip- it was kind of scary)  Sullivan's Island is another very nice beach and it is a lot quieter. Folly and Sullivan's are the ones that are closest to downtown- there are some other ones like Isle of Palms and Kiawah that I never went to (and now that I think about it, I don't know why I didn't go check them out....)  Another thing worth mentioned is that besides fishing, shrimping is a REALLY fun way to spend the day. I'm not familiar with any good shrimping spots in Charleston, I used to shrimp in Beaufort which is only an hour and half south, but you should definitely try it out.   Cars are also nice for road trips, speaking of Beaufort. Beaufort is really pretty, especially Hunting Island State Park's beaches, the Chapel of Ease on the way out to Land's End, and downtown. Savannah isn't too far away either and is absolutely worth a visit as well.   I'm so jealous that y'all are moving there. I don't live there anymore but I miss it so much."

Check out Charleston Community Sailing or just go down to the docks and talk to people on Wednesday nights for races, somebody always needs a crew. There is a yacht club for everyone in Charleston. Carolina Yacht Club is exclusive...the rest are just fun groups."
Charleston,2yy17h,shitterplug,1 point,Sat Mar 14 05:14:36 2015 UTC,"Thanks! My husband used to be on the junior Canadian sailing team so he has connections in various yachts clubs, but he sold his boat when he moved to New York. I can't deny that's a huge pull of why he's excited about charleston. He's going to ask around for friends to write him recommendations.

Charleston,2yy17h,borderwave2,1 point,Sat Mar 14 14:15:11 2015 UTC,"Don't move here without a car. You're doing yourself and your bf a huge disservice because you won't get to experience all of the amazing stuff that isn't in Charleston proper but accounts for the reasons we stay. You need a car to see the Angel Oak, or drive to Sullivan's Island for a Saturday, or go bar hopping in Park Circle. I would've left within a month if I didn't have a car."
Charleston,2yy17h,shitterplug,1 point,Sat Mar 14 04:26:08 2015 UTC,This may seem odd or out of the ordinary but nobody has suggested a moped or a motorcycle...something with big storage. That solves your parking and grocery problem.  I parked in my friends apt downtown with my motorcycle once and it wasnt that inconvient.

Charleston,2yy17h,gare_it,1 point,Sat Mar 14 14:43:11 2015 UTC,College kids do it all the time fairly easily!   And a bike/moped with a basket/trunk will be more than enough for the store for 2 people.   I did it across the river in MTP for a year so you should be able to handle it in Downtown. Just watch out for crazies.
Charleston,2yy17h,my_candy_is_free,1 point,Sat Mar 14 14:33:07 2015 UTC,"I imagine its doable. Alot of people have scooters/mopeds. All the cool kids have a honda ruckus lol. Only problem I could see is if you wanted to branch out on the weekends such as go to the beach and exploring the area and whatnot. Downtown is beautiful and very historical but you'll definatly want to visit Mt. Pleasant, Shem Creek, various gardens such as Magnolia Plantation, Boone Hall, the Yorktown, Isle of Palms, etc.   Edit: But also, once you meet people and make friends who have cars...there you go lol."

Charleston is small, but in the event that you need to go to North Charleston or something, a bike won't cut it, and our bus system is shit. I commuted with one for a year. Worked great. Outside of Charleston you'd definitely need a car, though. You really need to realize how small the downtown area is."

Charleston,2ytkj8,communistwookie1,1 point,Thu Mar 12 22:17:29 2015 UTC,What kind of photo? If you join a gym you usually get your picture taken. Do they require you to provide them a picture of yourself for membership?    Edit: a comment in a Charleston City Paper article states that when you submit an application you have to provide a photo which is bizarre but pretty transparent. I'm guessing that it's not possible to just apply in person which would make the reasoning for a photo pointless.
Charleston,2ytkj8,HangerSteak,2,Fri Mar 13 05:54:11 2015 UTC,"My family has been members since they opened, we love it. Yes, they ask for photos when you join, and you have to have a ""sponsor"" (current member write a short note saying they know you). That does sound a little pretentious, I know. No one's told me they've been turned down, so I don't know how ugly you'd have to be in your photo to be rejected.   We have little kids and it's a very kid friendly place. The owner is a single guy (as far as I know) and I think he saw it as more of a hip single people hangout when he opened it. There's still that population, but it's probably 60% families now and they have social events that are geared for both singles and families. They had a Santa brunch, an all-day 4th of July party, that kind of thing.  The monthly rate for families is $115 a month, and that includes yoga & other fitness classes. They're having an open house thing this Sunday, they're having mimosas and snacks and tours of the club: https://www.facebook.com/events/1549662025295090/"

I can not speak for these people but I could almost guarantee you that if you offered them a good job at a company they would most certainly deny it. They either grew up homeless and it is all they know or they have been so for such a long time that they would never want to make the transition back. Does this make it our responsibility to take care of them?
Charleston,2ymb7f,theninetyninthstraw,2,Thu Mar 12 02:59:04 2015 UTC,"Very frustrating. I've heard of some cases where the people have had huge medical cases/bills and lose their job/home that way. It's frustrating when you want to be compassionate to someone who is willing to work and actually needs a hand vs people who have decided to make panhandling their ""profession"". I especially feel this way about vets. If you've protected our country, you deserve my respect and willingness to give a hand when you need it, but people who are using this as a ploy are so wrong. How do you know who is a vet and who isn't? I've resorted to trying to give bottled water and bags of chips when I see someone on a corner instead of money, but, yes, this is indeed frustrating!"

There were also quite a few car break ins in my time there.  The units are also older, mine had awful carpet and the AC was always broken.. One day it leaked so much that I came home to find the ceiling caving in! Management sucked about it. Again, they have probably changed management since then as most of those complexes do.  Do you really have your heart set on a complex, though? Charleston has so many great and affordable properties that are soooo much nicer than any complexes."

Charleston,2ymloh,redstoneman79,1 point,Wed Mar 11 03:17:33 2015 UTC,"Wildwood of Stinson has a units for rent.  Townhouses, pool, 2 bedrooms.  And has a gate you have to access to get in.  It backs up to the Greenway too.  One way in and out so no traffic."
Charleston,2ymloh,bozboy204,1 point,Wed Mar 11 04:55:28 2015 UTC,"I have lived in Plantation Oaks for about 6 years. The office and maintenance staff do a pretty good job overall. When I've had maintenance issues the response time has always been on par with the urgency of the request.   The apartments are pretty standard, nothing spectacular, but nothing bad either. They do include a washer and dryer in the units, which is nice. As far as I know the complex does not have a problem with crime but I would still recommend requesting a second floor apartment so the screened in porch isn't accessible to anyone besides yourselves. The rent is a little on the high side, but in the same range as other apartment complexes of similar quality.   Overall I would say my complex is above average compared to the other choices you are considering. I don't intend to move anytime soon."

I mean, it's not the most spectacular but it's so cheap and pretty decent! It's no worse than other apts I've lived in at a higher rent. Yes we've had little palmetto bugs crawl around but we catch them and it's no big deal imo. More of an annoyance than a deterrent. And come on, who isn't annoyed with some aspect of their apt? Idk maybe I have low standards for apartments haha. It's not the best but it's cheap and decent. Ooh also it's right by the interstate so it's a great location!! One of the reasons I love it."
Charleston,2ymloh,youngstatue,1 point,Thu Mar 12 00:10:49 2015 UTC,"I just got back from an apartment shopping in the area over the weekend! I will be making the move from NJ in June!  Windjammer was almost immediately crossed off my list as the staff was visibly hungover from a ""long Sunday"" and the place was a lot more run down than the online pictures showed. Also there appeared to be feral cats running all over the place.   Personally, after visiting both Woodbridge and Ashley River apts, I would be fine with living in either of them. Both had friendly staff and seemed to be well kept, both had washer/dryer hookups (although Ashley River 1bd 1ba apts have the tiniest laundry room off the kitchen).   If you're looking in West Ashley and dead set on it I would also check out Middleton Cove! The price is competitive and its backed up to a marsh which is really quiet. However, it's right on Ashley River Road (or whatever 61 is called there) and the traffic was god awful at 10AM on a Monday.   What I have on my West Ashley list is Middleton Cove, Ashley River, and Woodbridge. They all seemed to have very helpful staff and the facilities were in good condition. I was surprised that ALL of these places have a trash compactor at the front of the property that you must DRIVE your garbage to, while the Windjammer offers to pick it up outside your door daily for ~$25/mo. (Where I'm from we get to drop it down a chute and listen to it explode into a dumpster 70ft below)  From my first visit to the town I learned that you really will end up driving everywhere you need to go if you live away from downtown. That being said, depending on where you work, there may not be THAT much of a difference in selecting other neighborhoods to live in. I had limited my search to West Ashley, but now two places in North Charleston are higher up on my list: Waverly Place & The legends.   Make sure to ask all the apartment complexes about preferred employer benefits, The Legends offer a 3% discount on rent for some employers and most offer discounted application fees.  Finally, more than half of the places stated that their rates change from day to day based on the market so just because the apartments may jump outside your budget over the summer months does not mean they won't get cheaper when you're looking to make the move.  If at all possible I would recommend making the trip to visit Charleston and see apartments in person if you've never been before!"
Charleston,2ymloh,HeatherSolos,2,Thu Mar 12 01:12:16 2015 UTC,"Waverly seems nice, but if you didn't experience the joy that is Dorchester rd at rush hour, I'd at least give the commute a dry run during the actual traffic before signing.

Charleston,2ye7nx,Aktor,2,Mon Mar 9 12:01:48 2015 UTC,"One of the biggest things when I moved back from NYC is there is no reliable public transportation. Carta is the bus system but I have had mixed luck with it at best. Most people drive. Cost of living is much less expensive but it is harder (not impossible) to find the kitchy dives that have that magic combination of  inexpensive and delicious. Explore, I don't know if you are looking to buy but maybe rent for a few months and really get the lay of the land before committing to anything. Also people tend to smile at you for no particular reason (do not be alarmed)PM me if you would like suggestions or more info. Welcome to Charleston."

Charleston,2yaiv4,JohnnyR2211,5,Sun Mar 8 02:14:55 2015 UTC,Hometeam's chicken and sides are very good. Can't remember what their pork barbecue is like.    How long has Swig and Swine been in business? Never heard of it.
Charleston,2yaiv4,HangerSteak,3,Sun Mar 8 02:43:43 2015 UTC,It's next to the Glass Onion. It's been maybe a little under a year. I like the BBQ much better than Home Team. It was fresher and of better quality meat.  Then again BBQ is a subjective thing and I do still love Home Team.
Charleston,2yaiv4,exposur3,4,Sun Mar 8 02:55:57 2015 UTC,"I'd have to agree, although that's just based on their pulled pork, sausage & sides so far. I need to get back in there and try some of their other meats. I went to Cumberland Smokehouse (where Moe's Downtown use to be) the other week and was pretty impressed - really good brisket and the sauces might have been the best that I've had in town so far.  Of course, what I'm really waiting for is the opening of John Lewis' new place, he's coming from Austin to open it up near Edmund's Oast from what I hear."

Charleston,2yaiv4,Ridonkulousley,2,Mon Mar 9 23:17:59 2015 UTC,Moose's is closed now. I never got to try it myself which seems like I missed out.

They were running their food truck for weeks and should have a new brick and mortar in the next year.   You only missed that spot, not Moose's altogether, it will be back (per them)."
Charleston,2yaiv4,Ridonkulousley,1 point,Sat Mar 14 01:56:32 2015 UTC,"Oh nice. I just went to Kellys. It was actually quite good. I heard Moose's was even slightly better than that. So I can't wait to see them come back. I thought it was much better compared to Home Team and Swig & Swine. I kind of felt like both of those places are damn near the same thing. I remember them having exactly the same sauce selection. None of it really blew me away. I've only been here for 6 months now, so I don't know if they are affiliated with each other or not."
Charleston,2yaiv4,shallowrecover,1 point,Mon Mar 16 13:40:41 2015 UTC,Moose's meat is better but only 1/2 to 1/3 the sides. So its a trade off but when they cut the brisket for you at Moose's it is hard to want to eat anywhere else.
Charleston,2yaiv4,Chs2014,1 point,Mon Mar 16 17:33:13 2015 UTC,Oh nice. I will have to give it a whirl when I get a chance. Thank you for letting me know. I appreciate it.

Summerville has the sawmill branch trail, which isn't terribly scenic but is a nice place to run.  In Mount pleasant there's the olde village out to the Pitt St. Bridge for one of the best views in charleston. Also the ben sawyer bridge out to sullivans has a multiuse path along side the road that can be nice.  Then of course there's the bridge.   Don't forget the fantastic county parks system we have.

We all have our specialties.  Would anyone be willing to join up one of these weeks?

In looking at /r/Nashville, they've configured AutoModerator to do a weekly post w/ some of those links, allowing people to discuss them. Might try and go that route."
Charleston,2y1xlx,suggst65,4,Thu Mar 5 21:36:21 2015 UTC,"I agree the wiki needs some help. I think the challenge is finding a way to organize it. Downtown has so much going on that if your category was ""Best fancy place in CHS"" you could easily get 20 places downtown and be missing out on a few great places from off.  Alternatively, we could sort by geographic area (like we do) and lose the categorization - which would be a bit more important for areas that have more than 1 place.   I don't know if its possible within the markup we have - but it might beneficial if there was a way for the visitor to choose the geographic area(s) to pare down the selection (maybe check-boxes, or a radio button), with the default set to show everything categorized by type (pizza , beer, and so on).    Regardless if thats an attractive idea or not - it looks like the most active threads of late have been debating ""The best ____"" in town. Perhaps turn this into a weekly/twice weekly thread and use it to populate the wiki with mods or organizer picking the topic  I like the idea of other weekly events too, but as a fairly unartistic person I dont know how much Id participate as a submitter; definitely would as a voter."
Charleston,2y1xlx,brand0n,2,Fri Mar 6 14:01:30 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the feedback! Would love help on the wiki, I basically compiled what is there now based on recommendations on older posts. I'll try and find some time this weekend to spend on breaking up the content into some sub-pages.  I might be able to use link flair for something like the geographic area - here's a result of playing around with it on my test sub... the idea would be to allow the submitter to select their flair, or a mod to apply/edit."

They have an excellent restaurant on the roof, it's quite popular with well to do locals. It's also only a block or two from the popular pineapple fountain, and part of the battery. Going the other direction, you have some of the oldest churches in Charleston.   I can't speak to the size or condition of the rooms, as I've never stayed there. However, the price, and what I've seen of the place, suggests that shouldn't be an issue."
Charleston,2y5sxz,autoadmit,3,Fri Mar 6 18:40:57 2015 UTC,"I think the balance is interesting and I think the cities you compare it to are perfect for ""grass is greener"" comparisons. I personally love Charleston, have lived here for almost 10 years, and have bought my first property here a couple years back. I spent years 3-6 of Charleston debating the move to NYC.  A lot of what you describe is what makes the people of Charleston great. My least favorite part of Charleston people is that there are a lot of people in a complacent state in their lives. I would imagine the amount of people living check-to-check in Charleston, or even worse building/sustaining credit card debt, is significantly higher than the majority of cities similar in size/cost of living.  I am always inspired when I meet people in bigger cities that are approaching their careers aggressively which is not usually the case in Charleston. If you spent 10 years here with the beautiful women that are very approachable and typically well-dressed, you likely would begin to long for the city girls that are ambitious with their career choices and may come off as less approachable. It is a tough balance and I think one that I am best able to handle by living in a place I love in Charleston, but making a trip to NYC/SF/LA a few times a year.  I specifically think it is interesting how different your average conversation goes in each city. Charleston everyone just wants to talk to fun positive people. NYC people want to talk about money and what you do. DC people want to talk about politics and who you know. I don't know LA and SF enough to describe those."

Park Pizza is great for carry out or delivery if you are in the Park Circle area.  They also have great salads and the pizza selection is great.

The only problem I ever had there was one time they served me some uncooked pepperoni bites, which they promptly took care of. Other than that, I've always liked that place as a quick lunch stop. Much better than the Thai place or Chinese place in the West Ashley shopping center with Food Lion (excluding Bushido's, but that's apples and oranges)."

I bet it will be good pesto, with the pine nuts substituted for pecans. That sounds good."" Nope, their definition of pecan pesto, is my definition of pulverized pecans; no basil to be found.   So what I paid $10 for was a cheese pizza with pecan powder on top of it. I will never go back, other people have to of had better luck but there was nothing else on the menu that interested me."

I haven't made it out to Bowen's Island in many years, but I hear it's good also (can't confirm though).

Charleston,2y1xf7,stevewhitmer,5,Thu Mar 5 19:27:40 2015 UTC,"I was curious what parts of the city or suburbs would be ideal for people our age?   Depends on what you like to do. I think this list will be relatively cheapest to more expensive.    Many people start out in North Charleston. It's made for transition because of the Naval School here so there are a lot of apartments and plenty of stores until you find what you like.  West Ashley is a beautiful suburby area and specifically Avondale is very attractive to people because of the restaurants and bars at a very livable price.  More expensive places are Daniel Island (it has a lot of families but is a very well planned community.) Mount Pleasant toward downtown is just amazing but pricey. You can walk a lot of places and if you can walk to Shem Creek or the bridge it is absolutely lovely.  Downtown has a LOT going on. A lot. We may have a lot of tourists but the city makes a point to be quaint and cater to the people who live here.  Isle of Palms, Sullivans Island, and Folly Beach are great if you like the beach. I think Folly is more bohemian in nature compared to everywhere else. It's traditionally had a lot of young people because you could drink on the beach but that changed a few years ago.    Is it financially viable to for young people to live in the city, or would we be better served looking outside in some of the more rural areas?   This is completely dependent on what you make and want to spend and if you want to be in traffic. Serious. When you check out these areas just use google maps to get an idea of traffic at rush hour. Each place is very different. I have some friends who chose to live/work on Daniel Island and they just stopped using their car and were very happy. It's hard to tell. If you are just getting used to the area it's hard to go wrong with West Ashley Avondale area.   What would be some big draws for younger people moving to the area?   Shem Creek, beach, kayaking, surfing, fishing, Second Sunday on King St., small theaters with great productions, the convention center in North Charleston hosts great shows (broadway, concerts, and standup), a bunch of microbreweries, some of the BEST food anywhere (especially downtown), Music Farm, Food tastings, Wine Tastings, the Art Gallery Walk, oh... you said you like golf and there is lots of that here too.    Are there actually a lot of transplants in Charleston, or has the internet lied to me again?   There are a lot of transplants here. It is part of why the area is considered so liberal compared to the rest of the state. There are a lot of reasons for this like the Naval Nuke school, the Air Force base, as well as tech companies recruiting to the area. There also is a really crazly lot of people who have migrated from Ohio. It apparently irritates the ""Natives"" (you'll see a bunch of bumper stickers. There is a whole ""Go Back to Ohio"" thing that the natives think is funny... but it's getting droned out as more people move here. http://gobacktoohio.com/"

Charleston,2y1xf7,bpwnz,2,Thu Mar 5 20:42:00 2015 UTC,"Sorry you've been downvoted. I promise we're a lot nicer in person. I'm going to cherrypick a few of your questions.   I was curious what parts of the city or suburbs would be ideal for people our age?    In no particular order: Downtown, West Ashley, James Island, Park Circle (north charleston), Mount Pleasant. You really can't go wrong with any of those being 25 and owning a car. Really is going to come down to your budget and how close you'd like to be to your job.   Is it financially viable to for young people to live in the city, or would we be better served looking outside in some of the more rural areas?   Going to depend on your budget. Downtown is pricey unless you're willing to have a few roomates (even then...)  That's not to say you have to live in a 'rural area.' The greater charleston area is pretty expansive and includes 3 of the 4 biggest municipalities in the entire state.   Any of that tailored towards people new to the area? She's into the art scene and all that, and I'm a beer, baseball, golf, and movies guy. From what I've seen there's a lot of breweries popping up.   There's an art scene, rapidly growing beer scene, minor league baseball team & golf courses everywhere.   Are there actually a lot of transplants in Charleston, or has the internet lied to me again?   Lots of transplants. Hard to hold it against them though, if i wasn't born here i'd certainly consider living here too.  Hope that helps some. Come visit sometime."

Diplomatic union action nor striking for several days/weeks has done anything to fix the 55+ student to teacher ratio, insufficient supplies, and inadequate facilities, etc etc... striking is hard to do in good conscious for urban educators if it means forcing working parents to find arrangements or take off work to be home with their kids when school is out. The kids suffer, while the bigwigs laugh at the unions demands while simultaneously reviewing their fluffy plans for things unrelated to education.... and the cycle of continues.  I imagine that down here among these other things, they feel it's just an additional deduction from their already insufficient pay check with no benefit."
Charleston,2xzaxy,Fleur_de_Drink,3,Thu Mar 5 02:51:58 2015 UTC,"New Yorker here....moved to downtown Charleston last July and love it.  I'll PM you my number...feel free to ask any questions you may have and I'll answer the best I can.    cool vibe and a good drink selection   Two options came to mind based on your description and location:  Cocktail Club is a personal favorite.  they have an amazing drink selection, really chill music, and great ambiance. Will get a bit crowded later at night (but not clubby). Have a bar area, a patio, and two living room-esque areas. Love this place  You could also try out Rarebit. Great liquor selection. Known for their Moscow Mules (every female friend from Charleston says that this is one of their favorite drinks of all time). Plus they have good food too. Smaller than cocktail club and no patio."
Charleston,2xzaxy,5trudel,2,Thu Mar 5 16:23:18 2015 UTC,"First, the hotels downtown are relatively expensive. There's a La Quinta Inn that's very nice right across the bridge in West Ashley that's 5 minutes from downtown and is usually under 100 bucks. Upper King street has really fun bars. Since you'll be alone though the most fun you can have may just be sight seeing. Hit up King Street, Market St, and everywhere south of Broad. You'll be in heaven if you love taking photos.  Now, you need a cab. Green Taxi is a local favorite cab that's safe and reliable. There's also a new service Called SCOOP, and it's completely free. (It's pretty cool, they just promote through advertisements in the car), but SCOOP stops at midnight so don't call them after last call.  So what's your preferable nightlife choices? I may could give some specific ideas."
Charleston,2xzaxy,thatguyinstarbucks,1 point,Thu Mar 5 04:18:43 2015 UTC,"I've been eyeing the La Quinta because like you said, the rate is very good. Do you have any idea how much a cab ride would be from there to downtown?   For the bachelorette party that I'm meeting up with on Friday, we're staying around Upper King (on Cannon, I believe) so I think I'm going to take my extra night there to scope out some cool places for us to hit up the next couple nights. As far as nightlife choices, for myself personally, I prefer more low-key spots. I'm a wine and/or bourbon girl, so any place with a cool vibe and a good drink selection is ideal for me. Since there's only a few of us single girls, I'm not sure the group will be looking for clubs, but if you have suggestions that aren't too pretentious, that would be great.   Does Charleston have Uber? I'm a New Yorker, so Uber is very familiar to me. Thanks for recommending SCOOP -- do they pick up anywhere?"
Charleston,2xzaxy,thatguyinstarbucks,2,Thu Mar 5 04:41:13 2015 UTC,"I couldn't say for sure if Scoop picks up from the La Quinta; I haven't used them off the peninsula; it's worth a call just incase . Also I wouldn't be a good estimate of cab fares, only that it's more expensive after last calls. Charleston does have UBER! Alot of my friends are UBER fanatics, so there's a demand.   If you're looking for ""classy"" drinking spots, you have ..   ""Kaminskis"" is a place that specializes in killer cakes and deserts in downtown Market St, but they've stocked an impressive bar complete with a menu for desert martinis. One of my favorite places for good conversation and drinks, though it can get loud (but still intimate). ""Republique"" is a double sided bar space (half inside, half out); its a sort of club vibe on one side, but the outside typically has incredible live music on Friday and Saturday. On mid-king St. There's some good classy wine bars in the floor of the Charleston Place hotel, in between Market St and King St. (Side note, you'll also find the nicest free restroom on your bar hop in the lobby of this hotel)  ""O Ku""- this is a sushi bar/bar-bar. Some of the best damn sushi downtown and it also has a pretty great drink menu. I'm thinking a its a great night for a girls night out; has a black dress Vibe but it feels welcoming to aspiring alcoholics. I'm not sure how much you girls want to spend, but the restaurants south of aboard St. are all delicious, and most of them have a good bar along with it.  Have an Appetizer, drinks drink, and bail to the next place is my typical order of business.   I hope I helped a little bit with all this; there's so much downtown to explore that having to see it all in one weekend seems difficult.  There are a plethora of college bars on Upper along St that I spared putting on here, but you'll know them when you see them. But the places I posted above are my personal favorites for a less intrusive sort of night out."

There are occasionally games on Wednesday nights, but those are usually reserved as make up days when weather or other circumstances cancel a Sunday game.  During the summer the Charleston rec department has a coed soccer league as well a 6v6 league.   Mount Pleasant has a rec department that holds co-ed games during the week. The games usually play at 7 and 9 PM on weekday nights.   There is arena soccer in West Ashley on Farmfield road. The arena is outdoors, but played with walls. Games play on weeknights and there are coed and men's divisions.   Summerville Soccer Club had a small sided adult league that played in the evenings, but I don't know if it still runs.   As far as competition, the CSL has 4 divisions with the top two being fairly competitive and the bottom two being more recreational. MPRD coed league is more recreational than competitive.

Charleston,2xf8fw,waxingpsychotic,4,Sat Feb 28 17:22:33 2015 UTC,I am actually bummed they aren't building a better terminal and making it possible for bigger ships to leave out of Charleston.  The current class of carnival ships are not appealing and the new terminal does nothing to bring in a better class of cruise lines.
Charleston,2xf8fw,jiml78,1 point,Sat Feb 28 14:39:21 2015 UTC,"While I agree that Id love a terminal that supports classes, the fantasy class does draw some appeal for people looking for a less crowded experience. It wouldn't be bad to bring in higher quality ships that are smaller in size - but then again that seems to be the opposite trend of the ship builders."
Charleston,2xf8fw,admrltact,1 point,Sat Feb 28 23:11:22 2015 UTC,"Sorry but if you have traveled on Celebrity's solstice class, you would understand that more passengers does not equal more crowded.  I have been on the size ships leaving out of Charleston (specifically the fantasy) .  The buffets are overcrowded and suck.  These ships are really only good for people who have never cruised before."
Charleston,2xf8fw,jiml78,1 point,Sat Feb 28 23:32:58 2015 UTC,"Not everyone can hit celebrity's price point. I've been on a few classes for carnival, I've enjoyed the fantasy class more than some of the larger classes. We sailed the fantasy last fall and the quality\diversity had improved since our last sailing on a sister ship. Where I think the fantasy class shines is the staff, and its ability to hit smaller ports  Crowded may have been the wrong word, and true the larger classes have appeal. I'm just saying don't completely count out demand for the little ones"
Charleston,2xf8fw,admrltact,1 point,Sun Mar 1 00:01:27 2015 UTC,"No doubt about the price point.  I personally am a family guy, I am not looking to party.  And generally the Carnival crowd is like the Walmart crowd.  Nothing wrong with it, but I am not looking to get shitfaced on a daily basis and the Carnival crowd is looking to do just that.  I have been on the Carnival Dream and I felt it was a nightmare.  I have been on Royal Caribbean Cruises with the same amount of people and I have been on Celebrity Cruises with the same amount of people but the difference is the ships.  The ships are designed in such a way that it doesn't funnel people into the same places.  For instance, the Celebrity Solstice class ships have stations in the buffet.  Not everyone is funnelled into the same line like the Carnival Dream.  But yes, not everyone can afford Celebrity's price point, but I would love to be able to sail out of Charleston instead of Ft. Lauderdale or Miami.  I see that there is nothing that those two areas provide that Charleston can't do better.  EDIT:  I just personally find anothing appealing about the iternery or the ships sailing out of Charleston (Nassau and Freeport suck)"
Charleston,2xf8fw,jiml78,1 point,Sun Mar 1 00:28:59 2015 UTC,"Absolutely agree, more options would be great. It looks like carnival is adding some non nassau/freeport itinerary this year. We did grand Turk in October and its probably my favorite port. Looks like they have one with the Dominican republic now too. I'd imagine as Cuba opens up that it could add a few stops easily accessible from Charleston in a 5 day loop.   Honestly I think the distance is why most lines aren't as interested in CHS, its 2 days at sea to get anywhere but nassau/freeport."

Yet somehow you've managed to flip it around and have your anti-cyclist rants downvoted to oblivion.   Mapmyride.com   Go there. I used to (no longer) live at an apartment complex on Rivers Point Row on James Island. Find me a ride of any reasonable distance that I could have done without a main road. I was bounded by Folly and Camp Roads. Camp was busy as narrow, and it lead to Fort Johnson, which was narrower and busier. Because assholes like you exist, I'd take Camp to Fort Johnson, and cross Folly just to get onto Riverland. After all, Riverland is a clearly marked ""Scenic Byway"" with signage alerting driver's to the presence of cyclists. I always felt a little safer back there. The ultimate goal was just to get onto River Road on Johns Island. But, to do that, I'd have to take the connector. So despite what you say below, I didn't ride on main thoroughfares just ""to piss other people off."" I did it as a last resort, as minimally as possible, to connect otherwise safe-feeling roads.  One last thing. There's no such thing as a ""car"" lane on a road. You can disagree with me, but you'd be wrong. You'll no doubt have some reply that you've convinced yourself is witty. But I recently took off from CHS in a single-engine prop plane. Only seats for 4 people. There wasn't a tiny-plane lane. We were smaller and slower, but we used the same runway as the big boys. That runway, like roads, is designed for the maximum (largest, fastest) traffic that might use it. And by engineering it to those standards, it also suffices for smaller and slower aircraft. Sure, there's room for cyclists to improve. Despite being a small plane, we had to play by all the same rules. The FAA is finicky about rules. But get off your high horse about ""car lanes."" No such thing, brah.   tldr; /u/waxingpsychotic is the kind of guy that says he's fine with cyclists in bike lanes, but probably opposes the creation of bike lanes. Psychotic indeed."

I do disagree with you. And you disagree with me. But at the end of the day, the law is on my side, not yours. So while we disagree, I expect you to fall in line behind MY position, and not entertain yours.

I always aim for quiet roads when out riding, but when you're trying to get somewhere occasionally there's no option but to hop on busy thoroughfares.

The equivalent to cycling in the road is peeling labels off of canned goods and taking them to the checkout counter. Sure, you know what you're getting, but you're a prick to everyone around you, especially the ones behind you. Pick a real form of exercise instead of something that instantaneously makes you an asshole next time. Get off the road."
Charleston,2xdhoo,waxingpsychotic,11,Sat Feb 28 05:01:13 2015 UTC,"i'm confused how i'm not entitled to ride my bicycles on the same roads you're entitled to drive when headed to whatever it is you do for recreation.  I do try to avoid the busy roads. I do stop at every stop light/sign. I do signal turns, yet for some reason you'd like a video game to simulate killing me? Bad drivers getting in accidents cost you more time a week in traffic than cyclists do. Stop lights, road construction, broken gas lines... as a driver around charleston I encounter all kinds of annoyances. Yet people out enjoying charleston in a way you've never tried seem to be your biggest enemy.  I hope one day you'll get to enjoy the sights and beauty charleston has to offer at a bicycle's pace, til then please just don't kill anyone.

I appreciate your avoidance of busy roads or even roads that aren't thoroughfares, but my point stands. I don't give a shit about road costs. I am fine with you enjoying the views, but I can enjoy the same with the window open. Just understand that when you are riding in the road, you are an asshole. Move, or just accept the fact that you are an asshole.  Plus,  bottom line: I will never take advantage of anything at the expense of others. Have some consideration."

Second, in neighborhoods you can't gain the same momentum that you would on main thoroughfares. Now, you're assuming all who choose to take this path is a pretentious ass. A given, I should automatically assume the same of you because somehow, somewhere down the line you failed to see how the law works and of how important it is to bring awareness to bicycles and the riders thereof.  In closing, I am not one of those ""spandex wearing..."" who rides 60 miles a day; you're dealing with a thrift store, cut off shorts and raggedy assed bar wearing t-shirt w/ a $75 1978 Nishiki.

CofC.... and without speculating, you and I both know what college kids do to homes in a college town. I'm pretty sure they would be out of business and/or sued if they took deposits without justification. If anything they seem to be doing well, lots of homes rented. The only flaw is the company seems understaffed with the amount of homes they manage, so calls aren't returned quickly. But if you walk into the Wentworth st office with a complaint, they are more than willing to help. Renting from the landlord can be a horror story too. At least with a property management company, you can always physically reach them when problems exist. Craigslist is also full of scams, plenty of people have lost deposits to homes downtown. Be cautious."

Charleston,2xdrg3,wisertime07,1 point,Fri Feb 27 19:34:28 2015 UTC,"Avondale is in West Ashley - it's on 17 and roughly in the area around the Magnolia Rd & 61 intersections.    Park Circle is North Charleston - on a map, look for the big circle where N. Rhett and Montague meet.    Both of those areas are considered more the hipster bar scenes.  Avondale is a little higher priced, as far as homes, than the Park Circle area.  The crime is a little lower in the Avondale area (Park Circle itself is fine, but the areas surrounding it are a little sketch).  Both have a pretty cool, comparable vibe though."

Pleasant, which are considerably more expensive. We live in West Ashley and really like it so far. It's got a small-town feel, but there is still plenty to do.   The traffic is a breeze compared to Tampa, but can still be annoying during rush hour. I haven't had any problems finding decent beers, in fact there are some great local breweries that I enjoy. The food culture is awesome, but you will miss the latin food of FL. There are always tons of events happening and downtown is always good for nightlife (similar to downtown St. Pete, but with the Charleston vibe). It seems there is always live music playing somewhere. Right now there have been multiple oyster roasts happening every weekend (food, music, beer) and I have been promised many more festivals and outdoor events to come in the Spring.  The sense of community is awesome! I have never been in a place where people are so pleasant to be around. Everyone you meet is really nice and welcoming. I have found it very easy to make friends and get involved with local happenings. The company my husband works for is very involved in the community and I think the people here really take pride in supporting one another.  I am a true Floridian at heart and I miss it because it's home, but I am very happy to have moved here and I think it was a great decision.

Downtown is more expensive but it is easy to get around on foot or your bike if that is your taste plus second sunday on King St is awesome. James island and Folly beach is where i grew up so if your looking to look for somewhere lower key I am a big fan of JI. The craft beer scene is also exploding here. Some notables include Holy City, Freehouse, Coast and Westbrook, but they're a few others around the city worth trying.

Then go to a jam at Awendaw Green Go to Acme Cantina for breakfast and order the pimento cheese grits then drive down to Breach Inlet between IOP and Sullivans, park and walk around.

Someone here said go to Poe's.  I completely agree with this, but here's what you do.  Read some Edgar Allen Poe poetry on a cold  Saturday night.  Get up early on Sunday, go to Sullivan's Island, visit Ft. Moultrie, walk on the beach, and ""open up"" Poe's on Sunday when they open -- 11:00 a.m. (pro-tip: if you arrive at 10:45, you'll be the 10th one seated).  Walk on the Battery, and do it often. Start up on East Bay, and walk all the way down to Meeting Street.  Cold nights are awesome. Walk back up and explore (Meeting, Church, etc.).    Read ""The Lords of Discipline."" Go watch the cadets parade at the Citadel.  Explore their campus from Hampton Park all the way over to the river.  Splurge on the great restaurants of Charleston when you can. FIG.  McGrady.  Husk.  There are others, but these are my favorites.  Drive out on Bohicket Road to Kiawah Island.  Visit the Angel Oak while you're out there.  If you're a golfer, play the Ocean Course at Kiawah, and find someone to get you onto Yeamans Hall Club (look it up).    Go to Drayton Hall, Middleton Plantation, Cypress Gardens.  Go to Mepkin Abbey.      Go to the offices of Old South Carriage Company on Anson Street and find a tour guide coming off duty.  Arrange for him or her to give you and your SO a private walking tour.  Trust me on this one.    Go see a show on a fair evening at The Windjammer.    Go to Spoleto.  Often.  Buy a tie at Ben Silver.  Find the College of Charleston in Spring.  Take a walking tour (combine with your Citadel tour if you're feeling sprightly.)  One Saturday afternoon, go visit all the great churches (e.g., French Huguenot Ch., St. Phillips, St. Michaels, Circular Congregational Church).  Pick your favorite , and go to church there the following day.  Go see a show at Dock Street Theater.  Someone else said this ITT, but buy a chicken neck, a 5-gallon bucket, a 10-foot strand of nylon rope, and find a dock for crabbing.  One hour at high tide should yield you enough blue crabs for dinner for 2."

I'd like to add few things in general about The Citadel campus:   Anyone can come on campus. It is a public university. I know it looks like a military base but is not. Walk or drive on. Parking can be tight, especial on event weekends or during parade. You can ask the cadet on guard for help or instructions but that duty is pretty miserable. (And they aren't given much direction on where to send people for parking anyway.) the Corps parades, with a few exceptions, at 4pm on Fridays. There is a Twilight parade at like 5:30pm. There are also a few times that parade is on Saturday. These occasions include Parents' Weekend, Homecoming, Corps' Day, and Graduation. For the event weekends check The Citadel's website for event schedules. You can see the barracks, pipe band, Summerall Guards, or just watch parade. The Citadel provides cadet-lead walking tours before parade. I don't remember the details offhand. In the warmer months (Feb-Oct) wear bugspray. The gnats on the parade deck are vicious. There is a Citadel museum if you like history. Some good Civil War stuff in there. Leave the Knobs alone. Having someone talk to them while out on campus will just make them nervous. You'll know which ones are Knobs. Campus highlights: Summerall Chapel, Mark Clark Hall, Padget-Thomas Barracks (though I'm partial to Watts).  The static displays on the parade deck are nice too. The fire the howitzers (and sometimes black powder cannons, depending) at parade.  I love the sound when they use full rounds.   When you're done with that check out the Old Citadel on Marion Square. It's a hotel now. Place gives me the heebies. My parents have stayed there a few times.  Let me know (OP) if you have any questions."

Charleston,2x4vvr,kalleerikvahakyla,9,Fri Feb 27 20:49:13 2015 UTC,"Want the authentic Charleston Experience?  Here are some tips:   Post signs on your lawn about high taxes. Write and complain to Post and Courier about poor roads and reduced services. Have a business related to tourism. Complain about cruise ships. Whine about traffic on 526. Vote against Mixed Used residential zoning. Write about southern hospitality. Be rude to tourists. Get a house on the beach. Never swim. Talk about loving the downtown. Never actually walk there, just drive everywhere. Boast to everyone about the historic nature of the city. Live in a sub-development in Summerville, shop in Walmart. Don't cross the interstates. Having a Law Degree, working in Food and Beverage. Wear  Holy City Brewery shirts, hold a PBR.   Those should get you started."

Charleston,2x6rpi,redbirdjr,2,Fri Feb 27 01:59:50 2015 UTC,"Well, some you can go down to Shem Creek or head towards Folly Beach - there are some fish sellers right next to the docks. There are also a few other shops (such as Crosby's) that aren't right on the docks, but get their fish fresh. Of course, it's easy enough to get a license and do your own fishing from one of the piers or do some crabbing.

Charleston,2x2tit,naoseidog,8,Wed Feb 25 04:35:17 2015 UTC,"As someone to moved to Charleston from literally the middle of nowhere (low cost of living), Charleston has a high price of living.   Zillow.com will give you a good idea of prices in different neighborhoods and should make it easy to compare Mt. Pleasant to James Island. Good luck!"
Charleston,2x2tit,illiana89552,3,Wed Feb 25 07:10:57 2015 UTC,"It's all relative to what you're used to. I can definitely see how the cost of living would seem high if you're moving from a very rural area. On the other hand, I moved down here from DC and the cost of living to me seems unbelievably low.   I completely agree that Zillow is a great place to start for doing price comparisons. It has certainly helped me a lot through the years."
Charleston,2x2tit,RogelB,1 point,Wed Feb 25 18:25:59 2015 UTC,Thanks guys. Zillow is where I shall look.
Charleston,2x2tit,scottymtp,11,Thu Feb 26 04:29:25 2015 UTC,"No you shouldn't have any problems for a typical 3br 2+ba. Obviously different area command different prices. I'd say in Mount Pleasant, you would expect to pay $1300-$2000 depending on the location and features. For James Island, I'd imagine you would be maybe $300 less or so in that range."
Charleston,2x2tit,RogelB,1 point,Wed Feb 25 06:41:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's definitely possible. I live in a 3 bedroom + 2 bath house with a fenced in backyard in Mount Pleasant. We have three dogs and the rent is only $1,350 per month. We founds ours on Craigslist but you really have to stay on top of it to find a good deal."

Charleston,2x2tit,Chs2014,6,Wed Feb 25 18:36:51 2015 UTC,"If you move to Summerville just north of Charleston, you can live like a king!  My wife and I just moved from Mount Pleasant where we had a 2 bedroom 2 bath apartment with a 1 car garage for $1300, which was much lower than most residents were paying because we moved in the day after Christmas.  They tried to raise our rent to $1550, so my wife and I bought a house in Summerville.  Our mortgage is $435 a month for a 2 bedroom 1 bath house with a 1 car detached garage.  So pretty much the same thing but for a third of the price.  We put 6k into it and it is just as nice as our place in Mount Pleasant now.  If you are willing to move just north of Charleston, prices drop dramatically.  I wouldn't recommend North Charleston, but Summerville is nice."
Charleston,2x2tit,lukmcd,8,Wed Feb 25 07:18:41 2015 UTC,I would only recommend this area if the OP wants to save money but sacrifice living in the middle of nowhere. The traffic and overpopulation in Summerville will put the OP in severe depression when commuting downtown or toward the beach. So I would recommend that the OP splurge a little for convenience and status.
Charleston,2x2tit,waxingpsychotic,6,Wed Feb 25 14:44:06 2015 UTC,I don't know about the status of living in town but I wholeheartedly agree that the traffic is a misery here. If you are going to be commuting during typical hours. LIVE BY YOUR JOB.   I would much rather live in James island with the hippies and weirdos. But I live in MP because I am not of a mentality to let me deal with stop and go traffic
Charleston,2x2tit,lukmcd,5,Wed Feb 25 14:49:02 2015 UTC,Wait a couple of years. I love that MtP residents (I was one) are in denial about their future traffic situation.
Charleston,2x2tit,waxingpsychotic,3,Wed Feb 25 15:02:06 2015 UTC,Oh it's bad here. But riding on 526 everyday would be soul crushing for me. I would much rather live elsewhere but I am 4 miles on the blacktop from my job maybe 1.5 as the crow flies. I don't routinely deal with traffic but I don't leave here during rush hour
Charleston,2x2tit,AlexEatsKittens,-1,Wed Feb 25 16:28:38 2015 UTC,Try Philadelphia
Charleston,2x2tit,Chs2014,2,Wed Feb 25 16:38:46 2015 UTC,"Indeed. There are tens of thousands of apartments being built here in the next year or two. Traffic is already much worse than it was a few years ago, in two more it's going to be brutal."
Charleston,2x2tit,AlexEatsKittens,0,Wed Feb 25 15:29:48 2015 UTC,"Please, there's nothing worse than what's coming outta Summerville: NEXTON, over (10k new homes, right on I-26) + the 75k population boom coming from Berkeley County. There's no denying you will suffer more.  Imagine your beach commute time during the spring/summer when all is said and done. Also imagine that time with the new parking restrictions put in place, double whammy."
Charleston,2x2tit,waxingpsychotic,4,Wed Feb 25 15:55:36 2015 UTC,"Oh, don't get me wrong. I'm happy to pay the premium to live in Mt P for its location and amenities,  I'm just also well aware it's being rapidly over developed."

Anna Knapp where it cuts down to two lanes and the interchange with 525 are the worst part, and they're not that bad. It's mostly just the number of cars and more so the number of bad drivers."
Charleston,2x2tit,Smurph269,0,Thu Feb 26 00:29:21 2015 UTC,"I see it backed up around 17 towards downtown. Tonight it was terrible, but I see it backed up on the bridge every day at 5.30."
Charleston,2x2tit,danceswithsquirrelz,2,Thu Feb 26 00:47:04 2015 UTC,You can probably find a house to rent in that range in Mt. P but it will be a rip off. I pay about $1300 for my mortgage in Mt. Pleasant and people in my neighborhood with similar houses are renting them out for $2500+.  Also I had a lot of trouble finding condos/houses that would rent to pet owners.
Charleston,2x2tit,jrlemay,2,Wed Feb 25 17:29:25 2015 UTC,"I know I'm late, but here's why this got a bit heated.  A lot of people outside of Mt. P love to hate on it because they think it's too expensive and therefore think if you live there you must by snooty. This is why Summerville was somehow brought into this even though you asked about places right off the Peninsula. Most pick between those 2 and those that pick Summerville vehemently defend their choice to live out there. I won't go into Summerville other than that it's way less expensive, you'll have bad traffic getting to and from work, and are lucky to get to a beach/downtown within 45 minutes. (But you don't even care since you're not considering it)  NOW, to your actual question - actually, it seems like you have a good amount of correct responses.   I'll just give you my situation:  My wife and I are 26 and rent a nice apt. in Mt P - 2bed/2bath for $1200 (maybe a yearly $100 or so for your pets). We're close to everything and our James Island friends come to Mt. P or meet downtown.  I've seen PLENTY of houses that fit your criteria for rent as well.   Feel free to PM me if you have any questions."
Charleston,2x2tit,unusualtomato,4,Thu Feb 26 16:02:48 2015 UTC,This calculator will give you a more quantitative view of the changes in cost of living.
Charleston,2x2tit,waxingpsychotic,4,Wed Feb 25 14:52:08 2015 UTC,"Seems to be in mount pleasant average of $600-$700/room in a house. You should check out west ashley, its really up and coming with good people and a lively area."
Charleston,2x2tit,Chs2014,2,Wed Feb 25 16:05:09 2015 UTC,"For the record, I live near Summerville and commute to the beach every week. No depression. I appreciate the value and not having to worry about higher insurance premiums.   Traffic is relative. Not sure how it is in Wilmington,  but it is something to consider. I laugh when people talk about traffic but are just in a rush to get home to stare at a wall. I love driving and my satellite radio subscription only helps. But I'm probably the exception.   Also, there is no difference in status.  Some downtown think they live a higher class but they will eventually learn their lesson one way or another. Some people are just still living on high school rules when it comes to public perception.   I agree, zillow is a good easy indicator. Best of luck!"
Charleston,2x2tit,the_brizzler,0,Wed Feb 25 14:55:26 2015 UTC,"Oh come on it's definitely a status thing + convenience. If I met complete strangers one said they own a home in Mt.P and the other said Summerville. Automatically you can assume the Mt.P is more wealthy, and has a great job that pays well. There's no denying.   You can't own in Mt. P working with low wages, in Summerville new homes go as low as 200k."
Charleston,2x2tit,joe4mayor,2,Wed Feb 25 15:26:18 2015 UTC,"Why would someone care about status? Also, why should anyone care much less what a stranger thinks of their social status? If a person is going to judge me based on where I live and not by the person I am....then I probably don't care to associate myself with that person anyways."
Charleston,2x2tit,the_brizzler,0,Mon Mar 2 17:15:11 2015 UTC,"Automatically you can assume the Mt.P is more wealthy   Yeah, because it's impossible to live in mt.p and be in severe debt... lmao."
Charleston,2x2tit,Chs2014,1 point,Wed Feb 25 16:13:23 2015 UTC,Good point. I have heard a lot of people refer to it as Mount Plastic. Many people in Mount Pleasant are more concerned with their social status and keeping up with everyone else....and so much so that they will spend well beyond their means.
Charleston,2x2tit,joe4mayor,0,Mon Mar 2 17:17:57 2015 UTC,"Well if that occurs, then the home owner has to foreclose his/her home and move to Summerville.   But if you look up foreclosures: A lot more in Summerville than Mt.P these days :)   So I guess the folks in Mt. P are managing their ""debt"" well."
Charleston,2x2tit,Chs2014,1 point,Wed Feb 25 16:25:14 2015 UTC,"Managing their debt is exactly what many of them are doing. I've got friends living in Dunes West sending their kids off to college without a dime of assistance because they don't have a dime to offer. Their homes and cars aren't barely worth what they owe on them and they've got debt everywhere you look.  Your assumptions will get you in trouble one day for sure. While statistics can support the broad generalizations you spout, making decisions based on those assumptions is a dangerous game."
Charleston,2x2tit,waxingpsychotic,-2,Wed Feb 25 16:50:42 2015 UTC,"The few people  you know doesn't speak for the majority. Buying a home is usually the single biggest investment in your lifetime. If you look at housing trends: the percent increase in home values in Mt. P vs Summerville is like comparing night and day. Thinking logically: buying in Mt.P will get you more in the short/long term than buying in Summerville.  I'm a realist, and the OP has to know the differences between the two places."
Charleston,2x2tit,Chs2014,2,Wed Feb 25 17:01:32 2015 UTC,"We aren't dumping on Summerville, but we do already have some friends in both the Mount Pleasant and James Island areas.  Being that I am moving to a new place we are looking in those areas so we can have a few familiar faces around."
Charleston,2x2tit,waxingpsychotic,-1,Wed Feb 25 19:12:46 2015 UTC,"Depends on your bills, TBH. I see a lot of people driving around in BMWs that have shit jobs, they are just terrible with money.  I don't have to tell you about foreclosures as well. Also, I take it, you're not at the point in your life where ""status"" means nothing. You'll get there."
Charleston,2x2tit,Chs2014,-5,Wed Feb 25 15:32:59 2015 UTC,Status is everything. Having a good reputation and being well known opens all doors in life. You have much more opportunities in life with money and status. But we all think differently don't we?
Charleston,2x2tit,waxingpsychotic,0,Wed Feb 25 15:39:14 2015 UTC,"money and status   Yup, still a lot to learn"
Charleston,2x2tit,waxingpsychotic,-1,Wed Feb 25 16:00:14 2015 UTC,good to know thanks!
Charleston,2x2tit,waxingpsychotic,4,Wed Feb 25 16:05:54 2015 UTC,"LOL @ this thread, they always turn out the same way. I wish it would be more about many areas than just two.  It's all relative, but I wish people would stop with the pushing of MtP and pushing of Summerville all of the time. Those are only important if someone's looking for the best schools. Take schools out of the question and you have each area to look at, sometime at better deals/value than either of them.  MtP is a great place to live. Convenient access to the beach and stores if you hate driving or your schedule is packed. If not, you're paying a premium for property, a premium for insurance, a premium for tax, etc. Summerville is a great place to live. Takes longer to get places but you're not paying a premium for property, insurance or taxes.   Traffic needs to be taken out of these discussions. Stop telling people ""traffic is great in MtP, so live there"". Aside from the fact that you base life satisfaction on traffic (really?), MtP is in for it in a few years. So many housing and apartment developments coming and the town can only approve more to make up for their budgeting mistakes. Summerville isn't safe from traffic either. It will get worse as well. The point is, it's relatively bad everywhere. But if you're from Philly, LA, or San Fran? This is nothing.  James Island, John's Island, Hanahan, West Ashley are all great places to call home as well. Each place has their bad neighborhoods, of course.  If you base life satisfaction on traffic, though, instead of looking in Charleston, look up psychiatrist in the yellow pages."
Charleston,2x2tit,waxingpsychotic,2,Wed Feb 25 17:42:51 2015 UTC,We are just looking in Mount P. and James Island because we already have friends in the two areas and I believe that will help my transition in the move.

Charleston,2x2tit,waxingpsychotic,2,Wed Feb 25 19:28:14 2015 UTC,I know! That's what I'm trying to avoid. It's funny to me how s9 many people hate on mt pleasant though.
Charleston,2x2tit,Chs2014,2,Thu Feb 26 04:04:43 2015 UTC,"Mount Pleasant was an awesome place to be for me. I love it, but when we were starting to look to purchase, you really feel like you're going to get ripped off. Convenient, yeah, but it wasn't worth it for me. The value wasn't there, but I'm a picky buyer. Plus, I work in Mount Pleasant. I get the best of both worlds."
Charleston,2x2tit,waxingpsychotic,2,Thu Feb 26 04:24:13 2015 UTC,"I completely get it. I really appreciate your responses. We are just looking to rent to begin, who knows where our jobs/lifestyle may take us! I'm just graduating uni. Also, it's just that we have to be super close to the water bc of my boyfriends boat/ job. So that's why we were looking in mt pleasant/james island, we're young and we're renting for now"
Charleston,2x2tit,Chs2014,2,Thu Feb 26 04:38:41 2015 UTC,Where did you rent in mt.p? How was your experience? Rent cost? Do you have pets?
Charleston,2x2tit,waxingpsychotic,0,Thu Feb 26 04:39:59 2015 UTC,"We rented in Watermark and it was pet friendly, but the price has surely gone up. If you want to Google apartments in Mount Pleasant and check out which locations look good, I'm pretty familiar with all of them. I did quite a bit of research on them before moving there. Now I'm even more familiar because I know the area."
Charleston,2x2tit,waxingpsychotic,2,Thu Feb 26 04:55:16 2015 UTC,"Yep, they are all going up. I live in Harbor Pointe (which is walking distance to the Ravenel) ..the least expensive complex (that I know of) in Mt P. The location is perfect but since that 65K sq ft commercial building is going up across the street, they've decided to renovate the joint aiming for the professional. I'm glad for the neno's because I'll be coming in under the gun as an already established lease holder. New tenants? Probably 200-300 jump /month."
Charleston,2x2tit,wisertime07,-2,Thu Feb 26 22:13:50 2015 UTC,Let's hope they keep you at that rate when the time comes for a new agreement. I have heard tenants at the Boulevard were in for a $400 jump back when it was getting finished.

You have made a poor investment choice by selling your home in Mt. P for Summerville (it's ok to be bitter). How often does the average person living in Charleston County visit Summerville (non work/friend related visit)? Maybe 2-4X a year, it's just sprawl mixed in with strip malls)"
Charleston,2x2tit,enjoyscuriosity,-1,Wed Feb 25 19:27:47 2015 UTC,"I didn't sell in one and buy in another. I rented and then bought. Actually bought in a future hot spot (around Ingleside), so not worried about my investment. I can walk to my golf courses and my son to school. Sounds like a great spot.  Perhaps invest in a personality rather than computer time in mom's basement?"
Charleston,2x4sxz,charleston402,2,Wed Feb 25 17:46:07 2015 UTC,Since you are involved with this program would you mind explaining more about it?  For instance from city website:   Charleston funds are secured through long term restrictive covenants which determines the property resale value and the income level of the subsequent buyer.    Does this mean you are obligated to sell for a predetermined price to a 50-120% median income level buyer?    I ask because $175k seems steep for 900sqft in that neighborhood.  Recent sales suggest much lower.  So this program seems to be trying to inflate home costs/values in target areas.  Is that your impression of the program?  Thanks
Charleston,2x4sxz,dirtyseaotter,0,Thu Feb 26 13:44:15 2015 UTC,"The sales price is calculated based on the median income of Charleston County. The max allowable sales price for me is calculated by determining the percent change in median income from the date I bought the house to the date I list the house and multiplying the original sales price by the percent change in median income. I do not think the program is inflating house values at all. I am currently under a contract for a home in similar condition three blocks away for a much higher per square foot cost. Although the east side may look rough there is a great deal of activity going on as far as new permits, and sales etc. For the area in general price is between 175 and 200 square-foot is reasonable. The actual sales price to the buyer will be considerably lower than 175. For example, when I purchased the house the city kicked in slightly over one third of the price. That means a new buyer has the potential for paying around 115."
Charleston,2x4sxz,Chs2014,0,Thu Feb 26 21:15:51 2015 UTC,"Also, I am required to sell to someone who make between 50 and 120% of the area median income. The goal for this restriction is to make sure that the house stays open quotation marks affordable and no one is able to buy it and flip it. Real estate prices in downtown Charleston are increasing rapidly and this restriction forces the home price to grow no faster than increase median income."
Charleston,2x4sxz,maya2113,1 point,Thu Feb 26 21:18:24 2015 UTC,"After 10 great years, I am selling my house. I bought it through the Homeownership Initiative that the City manages. It's a great little house in a very safe, quiet location that is still super convenient to everything downtown.

Charleston,2x4sxz,Chs2014,1 point,Thu Feb 26 23:56:57 2015 UTC,Thanks for the heads up! Don't you think that that area is changing though? There are more restaurants and bars opening up around there. Might it be a good idea to invest in an area that's coming up for a greater return down the line?
Charleston,2x4sxz,maya2113,0,Fri Feb 27 03:53:20 2015 UTC,"I think that area will be the last to turn around. NoMO (north of morrison) will be next. Then North Central. That area of the Eastside is the most dangerous area on the Peninsula (The seller is claiming it being safe, but someone was killed last xmas, 1 block from his house). Definitely not family friendly, and will be difficult to find someone to rent it for profit. You can find better deals elsewhere, the price is kinda jacked up to the extreme. Plus it's so shady that they didn't put the correct sqft!"

It took them about 3 days to figure it out, but they got to the root of it and only charged me $200 (more than reasonable), where I was figuring I'd be in for closer to $1k.  They could have charged me 4-5x what they did and I'd have paid it - and like I said, I work on cars and have a pretty good understanding of what I'm doing.

Go to the assessors office first to find out the amount, then to the payment place  4) take your property tax receipt, insurance proof and title to the dmv (Lockwood) and pay registration, sales tax and get your new tag/title.

Charleston,2wzyvi,xbrand2,2,Tue Feb 24 16:02:18 2015 UTC,A fire broke out in one of the apartments upstairs and then spread to the one next door at around 5:45am yesterday. James Island and Charleston County Fire Departments responded and had the fire under control in about an hour. Unfortunately by that point Big John's had received some fairly major smoke and water damage. Thankfully nobody was injured in the fire. The renter in the apartment where the fire started was not home and the renter next door woke up when he smelled smoke. I'm fairly certain he was the one who called authorities to respond to the fire. From what I'm told the damage to the structure is fairly serious. I would be surprised if Big John's was back open any time soon. I hope they had good insurance.

Then when someone tells you a Queen joke you can act all pissed off and tell them you are from the UK and make them feel awkward.   Here is one to start: I saw a Queen tribute act last night.

My other friend is David Higgins and he does an amazing 2 piece with him on the keys and a drummer.. He plays cocktail club every thursday and biergarten every wednesday so you could maybe hit him up at one of those gigs. He could prob work a deal out depending on his booking availability.

Homes on the market here are moving very quickly and I don't think the two sites can keep up.

Charleston,2wlh6a,Smitty500,2,Sat Feb 21 00:28:29 2015 UTC,"to save yourself trouble in the future, save ALL documents you get from them about repairs, and if you have something that you're worried about, like a sound or something, make sure it's stated on their sheets with a note from the technician. I've had a few sounds that aren't normal for my car that they say IS normal and I've made sure they note it so if it turns into something major and they say it's not under warranty I can say ""I've had this in X times and you've said it's fine and it's obviously not"". You gotta protect yourself because they don't want to do major repairs because it takes up a bay in the shop when they could push oil changes and tire changes through and make more money per hour. I'd tear it apart and repair it myself but it's still under warranty."
Charleston,2wlh6a,Smitty500,2,Sat Feb 21 02:02:27 2015 UTC,"As someone who can fix the majority of car problems himself.. This is exactly the reason why I do as much work as I can by myself. All of that could have cost you less than 500 bucks if you bought the parts and did it yourself. That 80 dollar ""headlight restoration service""..can be done for about 20 bucks with a kit from autozone, 12 bucks with some cutting compound, or 4 bucks for some abrasive toothpaste. That O2 sensor is probably 30 bucks and they're not that hard to replace. What you're paying for is labor.   All of those fluid services you could have done yourself for about 30-40 bucks.   Did you tell them ""here's my car,  fix anything you find""? Because that seems like this service. If you tell them that, they're going to find every little thing and blow it out of proportion. You should have had them show you everything they found in person, and then had them break it down between parts and labor."

As far as neighborhoods, Cannonborough/Elliotborough, Hampton Park Terrace, Ansonborough, Harleston Village, French Quarter, Wraggborough, Radcliffborough. Wagener Terrace is a little far north.

You can search for jobs on their site and contact them, but I don't know the official process for getting a resume seen by them.  I think they mostly hire engineers through her company, though. You could try contacting them I suppose. They're pretty much the middle-man. They sort through tons of resumes and decline a lot of them, but then pass on the promising ones to Boeing. You do have to understand that a lot of people want to work for Boeing and a good amount of them have a lot of experience. So, they can be choosy in who they hire.

Unfortunately it's extreemly rare and on a case by case basis.    If you do not see a job requisition that clearly states ""or equivalent experience"" your application will be automatically rejected (no one will see it at all) if you don't have a degree.  The only way I've seen job reqs written with that statement are when someone is a currently a contractor on site and does exceptionally good work.  If the position they are currently working in gets more headcount and they want to hire the contractor who doesn't have a degree they will work with HR to write ""or equivalent experience"" on the posting.  Those postings are public though so anyone can then apply for the job, and they have to interview several people before offering a position.  So it is theoretically possible to find a posting that says ""or equivalent experience"" and get an interview and be offered the position.  It's just honestly highly unlikely."

I always figured people called in fake bomb threats and then just immediately hung up. Staying on the phone for 5 minutes and talking in circles saying the same things repetitively seems pointless. I guess he just needed someone to talk to/attention.   Secondly, I guess police can't track phone calls like they do in the movies. Seems like if he was on the phone that long talking about bombs they could blue light a cop to his location if it was a landline. If he used a cell phone why hasn't he been caught yet? Those are always tied to a person these days."

Charleston,2wd343,lazzeri,1 point,Thu Feb 19 03:05:25 2015 UTC,"First of all, why do you want to live here?   Second, call centers here don't really pay.   Charleston is pretty tiny, which is one of the reasons it's considered a hidden gem. I'm a transplant, I've been here 5 years. Personally, I love it, but I love it for different reasons than a lot of the people who want to stake a tent here. People visit downtown and instantly fall in love, but they never actually experience Charleston. Housing is pretty affordable in the greater Charleston area, but neighborhoods can go from good to ghetto in half a block. As I've seen multiple times, people move here for the atmosphere, then end up working dead end office jobs and live in Summerville or Ladson. Their view of the city gets shattered and they're miserable. This city really is a fly trap. You should really think about moving here. In a sense, Charleston is a city of 'expats', everyone is from a different state. Exnatives? All I'm saying is to be absolutely sure you want to be here, don't let the tourism centralized charm blind you."

Grab a few sides (they are awesome), some wine, and either cook it at home or have them cook it up for you on their green egg. You'll pay 30% of what you would at either Hall's or Oak, have a better meal, and not have to put up with either place."

The service at both places is top notch and Hall's is the friendliest restaurant in Charleston. I've had issues with service at many other places in Charleston so it's nice to be able to have a place that isn't overly-stuffy but also takes service very seriously."
Charleston,2w110d,angryundead,3,Mon Feb 16 19:28:49 2015 UTC,"I don't know what you mean by ""put up with.""    The fact that Hall's is overcrowded, loud, and overpriced. It's also entirely too dark, although that is a preference of mine. Oak is better, but still pricier than it should be.  I've had much better service in most of Charleston's restaurants. I don't get how you can say it's the friendliest because I had the exact opposite experience. Tommy Hall is a good greeter but comes off too fake. Aside from Circa I haven't gotten the ""overly-stuffy"" vibe from any other restaurant; Circa's service was also the best I've had anywhere, and that near a holiday."

Wait times were often longer than necessary, the waiters had to ask several times our orders (but the place is incredibly loud), and they mixed up plates on a few people at our table. Not bad, really, but not as good as other places. McGrady's, Hank's, Circa, and even Cypress all have better service."

Edit: If you want a steak or chop, you can't go wrong with either. If you are looking for a fancy meal at a premium, go for FIG, McCrady's, Stars', or The Grocery. The variety and execution is so much better. But, yeah, if you just want a hunk of meat, I totally get it. Those are the places to do it."

Charleston,2vzd8l,cheeto-bandito,0,Mon Feb 16 20:08:49 2015 UTC,I have to have a significantly higher speed than the average bear (~20Mbps up/down) for work. Also Comcast has bandwidth caps on every connection in Charleston. As streaming shows becomes more and more popular then more and more people are going to start to notice.
Charleston,2vzd8l,jiml78,5,Sun Feb 15 17:55:22 2015 UTC,"Are you on business class or residential? Are you working from home? You can get business class service in a residence.

Charleston,2vzd8l,waxingpsychotic,2,Sun Feb 15 20:28:03 2015 UTC,"Do you know anything about comcast business class?  For residential, class, you are correct.  However, if you pay the increased amount for business class, you do not have data caps.  Comcast sucks.  And there aren't any good options around here outside of Home Telephone who services very few areas.    But you are just incorrect with your statements about business class."

If you switch to BUSINESS class, they have no limits?  How do I know?  Because I switched from residential to business class because of that EXACT reason.  business.comcast.com  It isn't a different package, it is a whole different class of service.  You cancel your current comcast service.  Sign a contract for two years.  And pay more.  There are TONS of companies here in Charleston that use Comcast business with zero limits on data.    EDIT:  If you call residential customer service, you will get the exact answer you are stating.  However, give business class comcast a call.  And you will find out what you can do.

I always had random people knocking on my door, heard gunshots occasionally, the laundry room shut down for 2 weeks because someone stole all the quarters out of the machines, and I got all four of my tires slashed the week before I moved out. Some friends of mine told me they had their townhouse broken in to 3 times. I stuck it out because I was too lazy to move and poor, but I would explore different places if I were you. James Island is further from downtown, but there are some nice apartment complexes there. If you want to stay in West Ashley, try looking at some places closer to Avondale or toward bees ferry off of 61. Avoid Orange grove road (which is right next to townhouse village condos). Hope this helps!"
