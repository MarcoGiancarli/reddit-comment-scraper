According to Corporal Buell of the ISP Fort Wayne Post at 2:02 p.m. Saturday, July 18, an email was sent to area law enforcement agencies with information on a suspect to ""Investigate for terrorist threats - threats of copy cat of Chattanooga ...,"" according to the email, which was posted to Facebook by the spouse of a recipient. Nineteen-year-old Tanner Lee Harrington, who is listed as living in Fort Wayne according to his Facebook profile, was wanted for questioning by police for allegedly making terrorists threats. According to Buell, Harrington, a member of the Indiana of the Indiana National Guard, was initially reported as a missing person. Buell said Harrington's family stated he left a note in Arabic that it was believed stated he would commit an act similar to the attack on Chattanooga. The translation of the note has been determined, by the FBI according to Buell, to not make that direct statement. ""The FBI did say the information was written in Arabic, but it did not translate to that statement,"" Buell said. As of 8 p.m. Saturday, Buell informed The Leader Enterprise that Harrington and his vehicle had been found. ""Right now they have found the car and him in Tennessee,"" he said. ""It looks like it is a kid that didn't want to show up for drill. ""This was initially investigated as a terrorist threat; however, the FBI has found that to be unfounded. It is being entered as a missing person in possession of a stolen vehicle charge."" The investigation into the incident is ongoing.

He can be a gruff guy at times if you get on his bad side, but pay your rent on time and don't cause trouble for your neighbors, and he's super cool. He has a ton of apartments in and around West Central. Find them online here: http://www.liveinwestcentral.com/  Another guy that has a number of properties has a website here: http://oldwestend.com/  There are a number of other landlords in West Central that only own one or two properties. Take a drive down Berry and Wayne, and be sure to check down the side streets for For Rent signs.  You won't be in the ""heart"" in West Central but pretty stinking close and cheaper than apartments near, say, the corner of Wayne and Calhoun. When I lived in West Central I was able to bike and walk to virtually all the downtown events, and it's a beautiful area.  I now live in Lakeside, which is just outside of downtown to the NE across the river from the Three Rivers Apartments. We still ride and walk to a ton of places since the trails run right through the area along the river/Edgewater Avenue, and the rose garden nearby is great. We wound up getting a home instead of renting, but there are a lot of places for rent along Lake and Columbia. Honestly, though, I wouldn't live directly on those streets because of traffic. I'd check out the side streets, or parallel streets like Rivermet. (Mike Anderson owns several properties in Lakeside too, and there are a number of other landlords as well.)  Hope that helps!

Co-Starters at ArtLink is awesome if you have a business idea and need to know how to get started. Groups like the Millennial Leaders Alliance and Young Leaders of Northeast Indiana are great for networking, getting to know the city better, and helping out some cool projects.

The perception of Dupont being in a low crime, easily accessible, area should make it a great selling point.   But you have people who think downtown is some sort of amazing mecca and not a shit hole of one way streets, shitty parking, and close proximity to an area that produces the most crime in the city.

fortwayne,3dfune,Utipod,1 point,Thu Jul 16 09:17:37 2015 UTC,"I used to go there, until their techs started, as far as I can tell, lying to me (though take that with a grain of salt - I haven't exactly compiled a series of expert opinions on the subject).  Last time I went there, I asked them to check a whistle I've noticed when the car is warming up in the cold (which I suspect is just a leaky vacuum hose - the rubber is probably contracting in the cold, exposing one or more pinholes in the rubber and breaking its seal, and then the hole seals when the rubber heats and expands as the engine warms). They said my plug gasket was leaking horribly, they could smell oil burning off the engine, they could see it splashing on the belts, and there was oil splashing everywhere, and what I was hearing was the belt squeaking from the oil, which means if I didn't pay them over $600 to fix it right now, I'd lose my timing belt.  Funny thing is, I did the last oil change myself and I checked the car for oil leaks when I took it home that day and there are none. There's no oil smell or anything. The drain plug and gasket were brand new at the time. My oil level hasn't gone down at all since the oil change. They just made that up - those problems simply don't exist on my car. It does have a very minor leak or two from the pan, which I'll fix eventually, but absolutely nothing like the guys at Bob Thomas told me.  The time before that when I needed work done was when I lost my brakes. They're supposed to inspect brake hoses during their ""works"" oil change (they had done the last one), and three weeks later, my brake hoses wore through and I lost my brakes going 45 mph down Coliseum. The mechanic I had fix that showed me the old hoses, which were worn through, and they said that had to be nothing but neglect. Bob Thomas tried to explain with ""we inspected them, but they must have just burst, that happens without warning."" Those hoses didn't burst. There were layers and layers of old fraying in the underlying mesh. That, I'm sure, was just forgetfulness. It sucks, but I'm not mad at them for that one. I also can't blame their response, given that it didn't occur to me to take the old part and bring it in when I talked to the manager at Bob Thomas. They had no proof to work with, and their response is totally understandable. Still sucks, though.  I've switched mechanics and I've found A1 to be my favorite, and they've charged me half of what Bob Thomas estimated for the same work. My e-brake was stuck, and they tore apart all the rear brake hardware, lubed it, and rebuilt it all, plus did a coolant flush, for a grand total of $320. Bob Thomas wanted closer to $700, but at least they had the same diagnosis, so I'll give them credit for that.  A1 also offered to do the work the morning following my call to them. Their schedule seems pretty open most of the time, but they do close fairly early. From personal experience, I would highly recommend them to OP. A1's website.  I'm not crazy anti-Bob Thomas Ford North, but I wanted to share some crappy experiences in case OP, currently considering themselves stranded in Fort Wayne, decides they're the place to go. Bums me out, because the guys there seem genuinely nice when you talk to them.  EDIT: Typos."

I got a new car semi recently and haven't had to go back. I had no idea about the new techs. Maybe if a problem arises I'll check out A1. Bob Thomas wanted $500 to change my brake pads on the old car, I bought them myself for $50 and had my girlfriends dad do it for free lol. Idk where they get their outrageous prices.

Since you've got dogs and again going to assume active dogs maybe not a central area rental only because there's not a lot of rentals with larger back yards. Southwest is nice and includes all the neighborhoods west of 69 roughly from exits 305 to 302 (and technically even south). You've got lots of homes available to rent but depending how far west you go you get further from shopping/food/gyms etc. Northwest is a little more ambiguous as I think it extends past what feeds into Northwest Allen schools. North of at least cook road and west of Coldwater, again roughly. Similar to SW maybe newer overall. Other area I've spent time because friends live there is Stellhorn and Maplecrest area. Lots of shopping and older homes you could rent cheaper.   If it were me 15 years ago single no kids I'd rent in the Windsor Woods, Holly Ridge area off DuPont and Lima.

Anyway, gigabit is being tested in North Carolina right now, should be available in Fort Wayne eventually if you want it badly enough, just gotta be patient... Though my understanding is that we'll probably see 500/500 first before the floodgates REALLY open. 150/150 is the top speed we're pushing right now in Fort Wayne, though the price increase is a bit more than the jump from 50/50 to 100/100."

Really nice little park, but watch the 3 yr old, if you really want to lose a hand here you can.  Auburn is a nice trip during the car auction weekend, although a bit expensive these days. The ACD museum downtown is neat too, preferably a different time.  We're planning on going to Angola this weekend for the hot air balloon event ""Angola Aloft"" for the first time this year - will report back.  Last year we did an Amish farm tour in Shipshewana that was pretty good, the kids got to milk some cows and enjoy fresh milk & ice cream afterwards.  There's the theme parks, Indiana Beach, Fun Spot Park (edit: sorry this is closed now), even Paige's Crossing can be a nice afternoon depending on the kid's interests. Cedar point is huge now too, feels more like Disney, every sq. ft. is filled with stuff, lots of things for kids of all ages. But it's a bit of a stretch for one day, I'd prefer to stay overnight and do two.

Probly something like a new gpu or similiar, they haven't released too many details. It will be an organized tourney, I believe they are doing BO1 for most matches and BO3 for the championship. Someone told me that there has been quite a few teams for CS:GO signing up so the turnout should be decent, although I have no idea how good anyone else will be. The event isn't actually until October but the registration will be full within the next month most likely. We now just need 1 more player so add me if interested. Steam profile is linked in original post."
fortwayne,3bzx7j,RushingRocks,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:45:53 2015 UTC,I'd also like to add that we aren't really going to be practicing as a team. We just need a 5th who will show up so we can compete in the tournament. Essentially its just going to be a laid back pug type of team.

If not, I've had some good experiences with Ehlerding.   For a used bike, that's a pretty common issue. It could be that the carbs need cleaned and synced. There should also be an idle adjustment screw on the carbs that could need a little tweaking. I'd play with that adjustment screw and see if that solves the problem. Easy enough to find out where it is on your bike by using Google. Also, I'd recommend investing a few dollars into a repair manual for your bike. The ones from Clymer are fantastic, and can save you tons of money.   Good luck, and welcome to the club!  Edit: if the bike is older, having to use the choke/open up the throttle when you first start up the bike is incredibly common. Sometimes those old engines just need to warm up. Mine takes a good 5-10 minutes."

fortwayne,3b3hpd,TheStonedTrex,10,Thu Jun 25 19:16:01 2015 UTC,2 big ones that are worth the drive are Pokagon (45min) and Chain O' Lakes(35min). Also Chain O Lakes rents kayaks and canoes and it can be super fun to navigate through their little lake system. Check it out man!

fortwayne,3b4jpx,lilacattak,3,Thu Jun 25 23:17:27 2015 UTC,"I'm really only familiar with downtown, but here are some suggestions:  The Deck is a very popular, outdoor spot in downtown. If you are into live music at a dive bar check out the brass rail. They have great shows and usually post them on their facebook page if you want to check them out before. Skeletunes is relatively new, divey as well, and also does live music. CS3 is on south calhoun. They have the ""tiger room"" and do a bunch of different shows down there. They also have a great outdoor patio. If you are more into pub-style try out JK ODonnells, good pub, good beer, okay food. Columbia Street downtown is a younger crowd (at least it used to be when I used to go). It's kind of a college-bar type feel. Also a college-bar type feel is pedal city, its another outdoor venue. It's very bro-tanks and backwards hats. O'Sullivan is... well it's O's. Not sure how to describe it. Cheap drinks, people like the pizza. Usually busy on the weekends. Thursday night they do ""Tronic"" which is EDM music."
fortwayne,3b4jpx,rrkrueck,1 point,Fri Jun 26 13:37:55 2015 UTC,Sunday funday at pedal city. It's an outdoor beer garden with fun activities and live music starting at 11 am. Check it out!

My little brother was a kindergartner at Haley last year, and his teachers continuously taught about God. Us being an athiest household never mentioned God to him, and he comes home telling us that God will ""make us in trouble"" if we do bad things."
fortwayne,3b2lsu,SirAstraeus_,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:39:37 2015 UTC,I think you should go ahead and report the teacher if you haven't. That goes against the rules of FWCS because the teacher isn't supposed to interfere with certain topics including religion in the first place. The teachers are supposed to let children think for themselves and not interfere with those topics at all.
fortwayne,3b2lsu,XxMicheleMessxX,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:37:44 2015 UTC,"We would report it, but everytime we've had to report anything to any of our schools, everyone in FWCS gets super shitty with us. My brother is switching to Croninger which is supposedly better so fingers crossed."

Apparently the woman went to a center for rape victims that night and the police station shortly after. I heard it happened between 3 and 4 in the morning on the 23rd.    After speaking with others today I have heard there were 2 other girls around the same area that are saying they had run ins with a short, bald man with a goatee (they also said he had a tattoo on his left arm I'm now hearing) that night. One said a man started following behind her on the sidewalk and asking her to stop and talk to him. She started cursing him out and when she went to her door she quickly looked behind her and he was gone. The other woman also had her house broken into, around 11pm on the 22nd, but I haven't heard any other details."

Tons of great Jesus and Mary paraphernalia to enjoy while you eat tongue tacos.   George's International Market is just across the street, and has the best burritos in town.   Is The Italian Connection on Taylor a hole in the wall? If so, best pasta in town. Homemade noodles are a lost art. Only open Thursday - Sunday, I do believe.

Their menu is probably online. Barbecue is never cheap.    El Amish is about 2.50 per taco.   George's burrito is (I believe) $6.50 for the monstrosity you shouldn't finish in one sitting. Or do.

He made many contributions that were crucial to the early development of all-electronic television.  He is perhaps best known for inventing the first fully functional all-electronic image pickup device (video camera tube), the ""image dissector"", as well as the first fully functional and complete all-electronic television system. He was also the first person to demonstrate such a system to the public.   Farnsworth developed a television system complete with receiver and camera, which he produced commercially in the firm of the Farnsworth Television and Radio Corporation, from 1938 to 1951, in Fort Wayne, Indiana.

That's a huge step in a young person's life, but know that you are not alone. It might not feel like it sometimes, but there are lots of straight people out there (Yes, even in Fort Wayne.) who don't have a problem one way or the other about your sexuality and support gay issues.
