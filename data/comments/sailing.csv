Most modern cats have rounder, more buoyant hull shapes and utilize self tacking jibs. The Tornado has by far the most submersible bow volume of all racing-geared cats and still has a self tacking jib. It helps to get the bow out of the water as much as possible when tacking. In a racing cat, if the skipper doesn't make a tack he is doing something wrong. Often times it's being too aggressive with the rudder and slowing the boat."

sailing,3e4s21,ramse,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:27:07 2015 UTC,"This includes manhandling the boat around the dock as you learn the sometimes challenging art of docking.   I know a guy that installed stern and bow thrusters to get a better handle on docking. He just lines himself right up with the slip and then straight in.   To learn quickly, you need that instant feedback.   I think I'm too slow of a learner. That instantaneous feedback of smaller boats caused me to completely forgo sailing for 14 years. It wasn't until we lost the cottage and had nothing to do in the summers that sailing returned 3 years ago. We came across a good deal on a 8000lb 29ft fin keel sailboat and it's brought sailing back to us."

I went from a laser 15 years ago to a 30 foot S2 I paid cash for (I dont want to wreck it)   I videoed the first docking attempt.. it was comical. I was trying to dock it like it was made out of glass. (4 attempts and freaking out.) Now I dont even throw fenders out sometimes. I just creep up.. jump off.. and boss mode that 30 footer.   oh yeah and I just single handed saturday in 15 kt winds 18 miles out in Lake Erie and then came back.   It was awesome.

Some of the older Capri 22's I sail don't have the jib sheets run back to the cockpit so I either have to jump back and forth (leaving the tiller swinging free) or don't use the jib.

The smaller are a 150% and a 110%. I would probably go with one of those if you were single handing.  All said, I've seen it done. Our weeknight races always had a guy out in his Shark with just him and his dog (who didn't seem like a great trimmer...), he never did well in the races, but he definitely got around the course.

sailing,3e3eum,Zurrojil,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:52:07 2015 UTC,"The water will indicate several things about the wind, i've mainly done coastal cruising and a fair bit of deep water cruising, but my experience with dinghy's is fairly limited (only laser's and Nacra 5.0's)  The water will indicate the wind strenght (or speed). You can see this through little ripples on the water, the closer they are together the stronger the wind is in that particular area, and they will move downwind. You can also see this through the foam ""caps"" I think is the English word.   As previously mentioned, the wind direction will be shown on the water by ripples, or sometimes waves (depending on wind strength)  moving downwind, (going away from the wind).  This link: http://imgur.com/FvL8zHa will give you more information on the way you can judge wind by looking at the water conditions.  Another way to keep track of the wind bearing is by looking at your sail(s)!. If you're on a reasonably straight line and your sails are flapping (if that's the correct English word) and are no longer ""full"" of wind, or less full of wind; it could indicate that the wind has changed direction or strength. From there you can look at the water and see what's up."
sailing,3e3eum,simple2fast,2,Tue Jul 21 19:22:27 2015 UTC,"So the water is really important because it tells you the future, not the present.  It shows you then wind that is coming towards you but hasn't arrived yet.  So in gusty and shifty conditions, the water is your #1 source of info.  For reviewing the current conditions, vanes can be helpful.  Often a mast top vane is helpful.  I also like to have a few bits of yarn around the boat.  If your boat has shrouds, a few 6 inch pieces of yarn can be helpful.  But also your sail, it's shape and flappingness (luffing).   Put some tell tales on it:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnOO5Z0zOfs  There is often a difference in behavior of the wind between the top of the mast and the level of the mainsail boom."

I know for a fact that we are coming down for Wurstfest 2 in november at Lake Canyon, and we should have about 8-10 boats on the line.    Just a suggestion...not dissing the J boat at all."

sailing,3e0lsy,vtjohnhurt,5,Tue Jul 21 01:10:16 2015 UTC,"The only instance of ""Piracy"" when we were on the boat in the sense of ""People boarding my boat to steal stuff"" occurred in the U.S., at our home mooring on Narragansett Bay, RI.  This was years before we left cruising.  Right before vacation our kids had their Jr. Sailing awards night at our yacht club, and rather than go home to come back to the boat to leave early for vacation, we decided just to sleep aboard after the party and leave at the crack of dawn off the mooring.  Around 0500 I was awakened by some noise near my head.  Our boat has an aft master cabin where we sleep, it is close to the dinghy davits.  I got up, grabbed a big mag-lite and headed on deck to find some kid up on our boat trying to untie our dinghy.  Now, our dinghy hangs on davits.  The davit handles are tied to prevent them free spinning.  We have a safety line connecting from the davits to the lift bridles.  And [b]another[/b] safety line running underneath the dinghy, you know just in case the davit wires AND the backup lines break, or the lifting bridle breaks.  In broad daylight when you know what is there it takes a few minutes to un-secure it all.  Apparently these nitwit kids had been stealing dinghies to joy ride them and decided mine looked like a good one.  In the dark, they would have needed an hour get all my belts and suspenders off.  So I appeared on deck in my boxers with a bright light and shout ""Hey, what the f*** are you doing!""  The kid takes one look at me and scrambles overboard into a dinghy his friend has waiting.  The irony of course is we rarely ever slept on our mooring, too much noise from the waterfront restaurants.  They just picked the one night a year we were there.  That's it.    15,000 miles of sailing and halfway around the world from there and the only other thing we've had stolen (or attempted to steal) was the kill cord from our dinghy engine.  They caught the kids a week or two later.  There was a rash of dinghy thefts by these idiots, and eventually they stole one and ran out of fuel in it and got nailed."

Take some lessons, or make some friends at the marina, or crew for some races.  You should know exactly what you're doing before you set foot on your own boat, because on your boat you have to be the skipper.  If the skipper doesn't know what he's doing, that is a dangerous boat.  If you don't like people, you can just buy a small dinghy for a few hundred bucks and learn to sail that.  It's more technical and time sensitive than these larger boats, and most of the skills you learn will translate well to a larger boat with some adjustments.

There are a ton of large boat sailors who don't know how to handle things like weather helm in a strong gust downwind in heavy air - learning that in a dingy will be very beneficial. I learned it in an opti (in this example, the hint is that at a certain point you simply cannot overcome weather helm. It is sobering to hold the tiller with both hands and watch the water stack against you on the other side, feeling it start to crack, and realizing the wind is telling you that you cannot go further to the lee.

The range really sucks on electric systems when you compare them to internal combustion options.  The size and weight of an electric system that will move the boat 100 nautical miles will be massive compared to a diesel engine and fuel.  Aside from the size and weight of an electric propulsion system, recharging with no shore power will take a long time and that is if you have a bunch of pricey solar panels.  I would say that these concerns are mainly for cruising, where you want the option of motoring for extended periods of time.  Lastly, I would say that for all of the additional headaches like batteries, wiring, and charging systems, you wind up paying an additional dollar premium compared to IC engines.   TLDR: Electric is more expensive and less capable than traditional engines."

The reason why it doesn't really work is as others have suggested, battery power. The energy density of batteries is just not close to fuel yet so the resulting weight of batteries needed to achieve reasonable range is absurd.   However, and this is a big however; if you solely use the boat for day sailing as in you have shore power every night and you also primarily sail the boat as oppose to rely on a motor in worsening conditions, then an electric motor could make some sense.  It's pretty friggen cool to be able to control the thrust with a bluetooth smartphone.  Anyway... it's kinda a no go right now on electric motors for a live-aboard/cruiser. If you want to know more shoot me a PM and I'll refer you to some sources to show you the math and why it can't work, until batteries get better anyway."
sailing,3dz93l,benjaminafarmer,3,Mon Jul 20 20:31:40 2015 UTC,"I bought a Good Old Boat last season that had been re-powered with an Electric Yacht system. The motor works well, but the configuration is inconvenient at best for my use as a weekender. I keep her on a mooring (in Chicago's Monroe Harbor) which means that the only charging option I have at the moment is a portable generator. As others have stated, the problem is keeping the batteries topped up and you definitely pay the price in weight or range. I'm currently researching solar charging options and I'm optimistic that it will get better once the sun is charging the batteries. If I had shore power available it probably wouldn't be as much of a hassle. My experience might be a good guide if you plan to use your boat for cruising.  I decided at the end of last year the smart thing for me to do was spend this year's project money on a used outboard (the prior owner had fitted her with an outboard mount, probably for the same reason) and treat the electric as a backup/geeky hobby. This setup works well enough since I now have long-range option that everybody in the yard knows how to work on, but I can still mess around with the electric system. If you have the need to motor for long distances or in weather I wouldn't recommend going fully electric. I'm also not sure if you'd really save any money after you buy the motor, batteries, charge controller, and solar panels.  FWIW, I think Electric Yacht now has a hybrid option that can attach to a diesel motor and work sort of like a hybrid car."

sailing,3dur7l,t3bow,2,Sun Jul 19 17:52:13 2015 UTC,"Which way does your prop walk?  It may be sucking you right back into the dock at low speeds, in which case reversing a little during push off may ameliorate that.  Spring lines are handy for this sort of thing, as you've said.  One technique...have the dock hand untie the bow line but keep it on the cleat, untie the other lines.  Put it in forward in idle, in theory your stern should kick out a little bit.  Make sure you have a fender forward.  If you have a second person on board you can also do this yourself, loop the bow line around the cleat and have the crew on your boaw hold it."
sailing,3dur7l,SailEvenstar,4,Sun Jul 19 20:18:43 2015 UTC,"cars turn such that the back of the car tracks INSIDE the front of the car.  Boats turn such that sterns track OUTSIDE of the track of the bow. Sailboats tend to ""spin"" around the keel which in below the center of the boat.  Think about how the rudder pushes the stern. (unless you happen to have a rudder in your bow ).  Ok!  So probably do exactly like you did before with a dock hand.  But be patient. Wait until the bow has completely cleared the boat in front of you. New engage the engine with the rudder amidships to go straight forward.  Now it's likely that just process of pushing off the bow will STILL cause the stern to come in toward the dock. But it will be slow.  Ok,  but how to do this without a dock hand to push off the bow?  You need to learn the art of the spring line, and specifically a doubled up spring line.  A spring line is a line which either goes from the bow after and comes to the dock near the stern (bow after spring line) or from the stern forward to the dock(stern forward spring line). The purpose of these is to resist forward or backward motion by the boat (NOT you may not to keep to close to the dock).  And the reason you double them up is so that you can release one end and pull it thought cleat on the dock and take the whole length with you.  So the easiest approach is to bow spring line as SailEvenstar has indicated.  Put the boat in gear forward (at idle), and spin the wheel to push the stern away from the dock. (Note, you can also spin the wheel the other way to hold the boat against the dock until you are ready to move ).  Once the stern has swung completely clear of the boat behind you, reverse away from the dock until you are clear enough to then go forward again. this technique works in strong winds and currents.  Here's a stink pot using the technique:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twzQeqOTvX4  You can also do the stern forward spring, and back down.  You can usually swing the bow out.  However you will have far less force doing this, so this technique will not work well in strong winds or currents.  As as with all boating, make any mistake you want, just do them very very slowly.  good luck"

sailing,3duq3a,drummtrip,3,Sun Jul 19 17:42:49 2015 UTC,"I have a 34' boat in Annapolis - you probably dealt with more extreme currents and conditions around Cape Cod than on your planned trip down the Chesapeake.  The water can get a little choppy and confused around the mouth of major rivers, especially the Potomac. Quite a bit of commercial ship traffic, and the barges don't always stay in the channel.   There is cell phone coverage virtually everywhere so its easy to keep in touch, check for weather, and monitor for ships using an app like MarineTraffic.   Not advised to just jump in for a swim in the summer without checking for jellyfish.  If you have some time to explore on your trip south places I have been and recommend checking out are the Choptank River (great creeks and anchorages and also access to Oxford and St. Michaels, although you'll need a dinghy to access St. Michaels from the Choptank side),  Solomons Island, Tangier and/or Smith Island.  Onancock on the eastern shore of Virginia is a nice little stop too.

Unlit, out all the time, and on a dark night you won't really notice until you are right on top of them.

However, not to diss the story, but it seems improbable.   Humans can really accomplish very little without cooperation ( this is why preppers are so mentally deluded ) without the resources available from a nearby civilization, it is improbable that those without experience or resources could accomplish what the story tells.   Further, one cannot build a complete boat with nothing but sand either.   One could build a cement boat, but one still would need trees for mast, yard, boom, and blocks.  Additionally you would need plants to fashion a sail too."

I found a great website where an guy was living somewhere near Nepal I believe and wanted to build a handmade ship. He had money and man power. The blog was very interesting but I think after a certain amount of time he gave up or ran out of money or something. That led me to study up on dry docks and also keel construction. Ship building is very complex and societies have been built upon it with generations of craftsman passing on skills and knowledge. I have concluded that there's no way in hell the story is true, yet I still wonder (and post on reddit haha) if it could be true."

The boats they used then, say 100 years ago, were likely very close to what was built a thousand years ago in the same areas.  Also, remember parables, or historic stories exist to tell a story and teach a lesson.  The point is not really could or could it not be done but what the actual meaning is to the reader or recipient.  In that way, truthiness is not really the important factor here.

With the right knowledge, patience, and a team of strong hands, people can do a lot of really cool stuff.  This guy is building a boat out of steel with only the help of 1 or 2 people (or alone) most of the time.  If you're next to a forest, building a boat out of wood is difficult but achievable for a handful of guys.  I want to clarify that I don't think it happened the way your story describes, but I don't consider it something that could be disproven.  What's more improbable to me is the rest of the story and how it ever came to be known.  I didn't hear the part where there was any inter-continental commerce going on during that 1000 year civilization's time, so how did anyone in Europe know that family survived the crossing?  Once that family left in their ship, there's no way for the people staying behind to have any idea what's going on with them, let alone their ancestors for 1000 years."

So head out into the woods today with all the new gear and supplies you want, and then in 2023, when your tent and clothes and everything else is in tatters, then start the process of learning the ages-old craft of building a ship. After you get the ship built, how are you going to push it into the water?

sailing,3dv0at,enuct,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:14:17 2015 UTC,"The Kon-Tiki took 101 days to travel 4300 Nm. The distance between Jeddah and Seattle (two cities I pick at random for illustration purposes) is something on the order of 15000 Nm.  At Kon-Tiki (ocean current) speeds, that's about 352 days. But Thor Heyerdahl had a good idea of where the ocean currents were and could control his raft to some extent. Let's say our adventurers couldn't and add a 25% penalty to their journey time, for a total of 440 days.  A non-stop trip for 16 people would require a minimum of 3 liters/person/day, for a total of 21,120 liters. Let's assume much of the food is harvested from the sea (fishing). We know that Roman Legionaries carried a day's worth of water with them on the march. Let's say that was 3 liters. Our travelers would then have to carry 7,040 skins of water with them. But perhaps they cut that in half by collecting water from rain. That's still 3,520 skins of water.  That's a more or less direct, non-stop voyage. However, the route could take you through Indonesia, past Australia, up the coast of China and hugging the Bering Straight. Which means you could essentially do much of the trip within sight of land (the Indian Ocean crossing would be the longest open ocean leg).  All of which simplifies the supply problem, but opens up a different problem. Namely, with all that land going by, why would you stay on a raft for more than a year (more like two+ with stops) when you could get off any time?"

It is completely accepted that all of the Americas were settled by people whose ancestors walked across that patch of land.  Saying that they didn't go south of the Yucatan has no basis in fact that I can find.  Shortly before the Vikings started raiding the northeast, the Asians started exploring the southwest.  They didn't have boats* in 10,000 BC, this didn't start until a few hundred years after Jesus did his thing.  Anthropologically speaking, the Easter Island folks are fresh off the boat.  Edit:  I mean to say, they didn't have boats that could cross oceans.  Certainly they had hollow logs, but real navigation didn't happen until about 1000 years ago."

sailing,3dr95m,andrewembassy,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:22:39 2015 UTC,Well there was the one at the start of the race several weeks back and then the one a race or two after on south lake. Looked like a boat tried turning around the buoy and ended up getting caught by the wind forcing it to turn all the way around into oncoming traffic. As I recall it was the pj themed race and their boat was decorated pink.
sailing,3dr95m,tristanjones,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:37:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, our accident was a couple weeks ago at the beginning of the race near the east side of the lake; we tacked to port and would have gone well ahead of the 70' sloop but for some reason they pointed up and didn't see us until it was too late. Luckily we escaped with a bent stanchion and torn genoa."

With such a wide variation in skill level and boat ability, it seems to help spread people out more. Some of the more dicey situations I've experienced occur when folks end up significantly losing speed or ending up in irons around a mark, resulting in a clusterfuck for lack of better term. So long as there is decent wind and a sufficient length start line, folks tend to not hit eachother... for the most part..."

sailing,3do89s,flavorizante,2,Sat Jul 18 14:43:28 2015 UTC,"I'd take that Brazillian barquentine up front.  She'd straight smoke the others on the upwind leg.  Full-riggers can't sail closer than about 60° to the wind; but that fore-and-aft rig on two masts will let the barquentine point a lot higher, and thus cut a much shorter course.  She'd have to tack less often, too."
sailing,3dqary,semininja,2,Sat Jul 18 12:13:56 2015 UTC,"TL;DR: Buy this one instead, or one like it.  So, if you have a trailer, launching a Hobie is pretty easy.  You can step your mast and hoist your sails while on the trailer, and you're ready to drop it right in the water and sail.  If you want to car-top it, that is a much bigger procedure.  You'll have to disassemble it, the Hobie is just shy of 8 feet wide which is much wider than your car probably is.  You'll need to buy or build some kind of frame to keep it all together and keep the weight spread across your roof, because the hulls are a good 100 pounds each.  Getting launched will probably turn from a 20 minute trailer procedure to a 1+ hour assembly.  I don't know you, but looking forward to a lengthy assembly would be enough effort to discourage a lot of people from deciding to sail today.  I think most importantly, not having a trailer really hurts your resale possibilities.  For the price of $1000 (if I remember correctly from your other post), you should get a trailer included.   I just looked at craigslist in what I think is your area, and this was the top result for Hobies.  Just the first bit of the description ""The hulls are solid and water tight, the tramp was replaced in 2013"" means this is a solid purchase at $1100 with trailer included.  You can almost always find a Hobie for sale with a trailer if you look around."
sailing,3dqary,POTUS,2,Sat Jul 18 21:03:02 2015 UTC,"The price of the boat I'm looking at is actually only $600, and I found this as well. I'm going to see if that guy will take $150 for just the trailer."
sailing,3dqary,POTUS,2,Sat Jul 18 22:22:08 2015 UTC,"Just watch out for the hull condition and the trampoline.  Hulls go soft and the cat's no good after that at all.  Tramps rot and have to be replaced, and that'll cost $300.  Also lots of people in my area try to sell trailers that they don't have paperwork for, and you end up with a trailer that you can't get tags for.  This is fine if you already have trailer tags, because you can just sneak your tags on whichever trailer is hooked to your car and nobody can tell the difference.  But if you don't have tags, and you don't have paperwork, you can't get tags.  The listing I linked covered all my look-out-for bases for Hobies, at least if the guy is telling the truth (which they usually do).  If I were looking, and if none of the other ads had all those bases covered*, I'd be at that guy's house with cash tomorrow.  *:  I didn't look at any other ads"
sailing,3dqary,vreten,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:30:47 2015 UTC,"they get pretty heavy, so unless you have 3 of 4 people you will need wheels or a trailer to launch.  I bought a random boat trailer for a couple hundred and then bought more pieces to make it fit the sailboat (brackets, rollers etc).  You probably would need to break it down into pieces to put on top of the car, just from the weight, and make multiple trips."
sailing,3dqary,RoccoRacer,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:58:12 2015 UTC,"1) I've often thought about car topping my hobie, but I think it would have to be upside down for it to work. And the mast is going to be longer than nearly any vehicle. Make sure you red flag it.  2) I'm not familiar with the Detroit area. If you don't have a trailer beach wheels would be a good idea, but now you've got a lot of stuff on top of your car.   3) All cat trailers I've seen have rollers at the front and rear for each hull. Otherwise its just a basic A-frame trailer.  side) My 16 is a 1974 model and I think its heavier than the newer ones. I have a hard time flying a hull even soloing without hiking out. With crew even in 20+ knots I've never flown a hull. Unfortunately I can't quantify the weight."

Get wood handle, it feels nicer, is easy to maintain, and one should always have a familiar piece of wood to touch when things get dicey."

Of course, the screws are Torx, so not a quick fix unless you happen to carry a specialty screwdriver set with you wherever you go.   As the thing that holds the knife together, I would expect a better system than miniature torx screws, and maybe a little bit of locktite."

Crowdsourced stuff on Active Captain would seem to be more timely and up to date.  I don't know cruisers that navigate by AC, but I know some that use it as a tool to find out where they are going.  The biggest problem I have with Waterway Guides though is they are very limited in geographic scope.  I left their range in 2012 and haven't been back.   In the mean time I'm creating a lot of new entries for the parts of the world we are in for others on AC."

In general I'd agree with you on the printed guides, but their new Waterway Guide Explorer app (similar to AC, but more accurate I think) is pretty awesome. And it's now also integrated with the iNavX chartplotter (what we use on our boat) so that you have all that info at your fingertips on your chartplotter.  Anyway, given the apparent fact that the boaters are the actual customers WG Explorer - whereas marinas are the actual customers for AC - I'll stick with WGE.  Hopefully, WGE will get reviews integrated soon. When that happens, I think the debate will be over."

The only issue is that Australia is an expensive place to buy a boat, so there may be enterprising Australians also after the same boats.  $30k isn't a lot of money for a cruising boat, but you should be able to find something in the 30' range.    It might be worth checking the blogs of people who are there and contact them directly to put feelers out.    Where do you plan to go?

sailing,3dn7f8,FluffyBunnyHugs,3,Sat Jul 18 16:41:51 2015 UTC,I spent a lot of time in Costa Rica.  In particular on the east coast of Costa Rica as my home away from home.

sailing,3dn7f8,PirateGumby,2,Sun Jul 19 16:51:44 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't recommend it without preparation  Firstly, learn to sail in a range of conditions.  No wind, 40kn winds and everything in between.  Next, start by sailing for a full day - set out at sunrise, go until it's dark.  Then I'd suggest extending those trips later into the evening, building up to a full night.  You want to get a feel for how well you make decisions while you're short of sleep.  This way you can begin planning the trip and looking at a map to work out ""ok, from x to y is a 4 hour trip - I can do that, stay the night, then go to z tomorrow"".   Always have a backup plan - if things turn to shit and you need to find somewhere safe, you want to be familiar with finding shelter and dropping anchor, or worst case, riding it out at sea."
sailing,3dn7f8,PirateGumby,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:19:23 2015 UTC,"I have no intention of jumping into this without lots of careful planning.  Right now I'm just musing over a day dream but if it seems like something I'm actually capable of I'll begin taking my planning more seriously.  I've done some basic research into sailing but have yet to take the time to start learning. Just hoping to get a little insight from this community  at large and draw on the collective wisdom and experience. I'm good at living in a small space,  working long days and even now live a pretty minimalist lifestyle.  Ideally my plan would be to have a permanent residence on the east coast of Costa Rica and be able to sail along the coast back to Charleston."
sailing,3dn7f8,PirateGumby,2,Fri Jul 17 18:45:43 2015 UTC,"It's certainly do-able.  As mentioned, start out by learning to sail.   Keep in mind that ""B.O.A.T"" is actually an acronym for Bring On Another Thousand - they are cheap, especially if you're planning on living aboard.   Once you know how to sail, I'd suggest getting involved in some racing.  A race like the Newport - Bermuda will give you a good idea of what's involved in multi-day journeys, as well as the sort of craziness that can be thrown at you.  Seek out the unpleasant jobs during a race.  Things like fixing toilets, cooking meals.  Things that you will have to do on a daily basis.  Work out if you get seasick or not.  Have fun! :)"

sailing,3dn7f8,SailEvenstar,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:05:27 2015 UTC,"I've got a friend who is doing that in the Med and a few other friends who have worked on boats.  To start out, in any job on the boat, you pretty much have to get STCW certificate : http://www.stcw.org/training.html  It's not mandatory, but it is expected for most crew and you'll have a hard time getting any job without it (or a local equivalent).   Then, I'd look at doing some other general/basic seamanship courses.  On most boats, it's pretty much expected that you will have an official role, but also help out and do other jobs as needed.  So doing a course on basic engine servicing or something like that would certainly help.  After that, there is a lot of luck involved.  A lot of things come down to 'friend of a friend'.  Expect a lot of work for very low pay.  Some boat owners or boat managers are downright assholes, some can be really nice people.  Keep in mind that you may be spending a lot of time in very close proximity to these people - be careful who you sail with.  I've heard stories of minor incidents blowing up to the point where someone held a knife to the throat of another person.  I had a friend who was bashed with a winch handle by another guy because he didn't wake him up when they saw land.  Being out at sea for a long time can seriously do strange things to your mind :)   Not trying to put you off - just be aware of the reality of the situation.  A lot of people go into this industry with expectations of glamor and a relaxed environment.    There is absolutely nothing relaxed or glamorous about fishing turds and tampons out of a blocked toilet, while out at sea and crashing through waves, because some idiot didn't read the large print, bold lettering notice that said ""ONLY TOILET PAPER TO BE FLUSHED"".  Been there, done that.. and I don't even work on boats!  Good luck :)"

sailing,3dn7f8,tkaraszewski,2,Fri Jul 17 18:47:10 2015 UTC,"A lot of that answer depends on what the word ""budget"" means to you.  Not to be snide, but to some people a ""budget"" is $1,000, for others $100,000.  For others it is simply a division of how they will spend whatever it takes.  So to figure out what you can and will afford and back fill from there.  Yes it can be done.  We left the U.S. East Coast and sailed through Panama, one country South of Costa Rica.  There are a lot of ways to get from Point A to Point B by boat - in our case we did it over a year working our way from the BVI's to Trinidad then sailing across.  You can do it with lots of stops, or in long stretches straight at your target.  We spent our time in the Eastern Caribbean so I can't tell you much about the Northern parts you'd sail through on your path.  Step one is get out and sail as much as you can, make sure you like it.  Take lessons, check notice boards at yacht clubs looking for casual crew, put a notice up at clubs that you will crew for people - this is racing generally, not cruising, but you will get time on boats and learn to sail.  If you start meeting sailors and boat owners and helping them you will start getting invites too.  There are cheap boats out there that are offshore capable rugged, tough little beasts and there are really expensive boats I wouldn't take out of VHF range of the coast.  As a way to commute from one home to another...I'm not sure that's how I'd do it.  But we sold everything on land and moved onto a boat full time.  Horses for courses, everyone's desires are different - my preference was for more boat, zero houses and full time on the water."
sailing,3dn7f8,tkaraszewski,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:26:43 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for the response.  I'm sure there would be more efficient ways to get from there to here but what an adventure that would be.  Hitting all those ports along the way must have been the adventure of a life time.  As far as budgets go I'd be some comfortably  in between the 1000 and 100,000 marks.  That tough cheap boat I could sail around the world is exactly what I'm going for.  I'm a minimalist in a lot of ways now and would essentially want to sell of my home and possession to live on the boat full time if I can.  I'll start looking into sailing classes and crewing a race to see if I have what it takes.  Would love to chat and hear more about your journey. The part of Costa Rica I want to settle in is very close to Panama so your trip would likely she'd some valuable insight.  Thanks again!"

Do they have the typical cape dory pad eye style chainplates?  If so you wont be as bad but with a typical through deck plate you can damage the plate or at a minimum break the seal and cause leaking.  On a properly fitted chainplate there is a gap between it and the deck all the way around so you are flexing against that and the sealant there."

sailing,3dj5qm,somegridplayer,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:25:56 2015 UTC,"you'll rip a stanchion out of the boat even easier using it to spring a boat.   Well after over 10 years of doing just that I guess your perdition is somewhat incorrect.   Also the cyclic loading of a dock line on the stanchion will compromise the seal to the deck allowing water to penetrate the deck core softening it and making it even easier to tear out of the deck.   Yes if you tied the line to the top of the stanchion that may be the case, but tied it to the base will do no such thing, as it is just as secure as a cleat on the deck and in the case of the stanchions on the boat that I sail on, even more so considering the reinforcements that have been put in place.  This is what the base of the stanchion looks like.  Thus attaching the lie to the base would in no way be able to compromise the deck in any way, as the force is perpendicular to the bolts, therefore you are only dealing with shear stress.   But this is where you'll assure me you've over bored all the holes and filled them with epoxy and rebored the holes to fit the bolts and bedded in 5200 and have backing plates atleast an 1"" over all dimensions on the backside in G10 which was also bonded to the underside to improve strength right?

sailing,3dj5qm,FlickrPaul,0,Sun Jul 19 15:47:24 2015 UTC,"Yes, you keep referring to that standard stanchion base, that doesn't make it any less susceptible to working the bolts and causing core issues. Why don't you just take pics of the installation?"

When you understand that the force on the bolts is a shear load and as such is just as secure as a cleat you will be well on your way to understanding.  The load is ~2cm above the level of deck, so to insinuate that there is load that would compress the deck is a failure at understanding how loads work.   Yes, you keep referring to that standard stanchion base, that doesn't make it any less susceptible to working the bolts and causing core issues.   The based of the stanchion sits on a stainless plate that is ~10% larger than the base of the mount.  Four bolts go through that and on the underside there is another stainless plate.  The funny thing is the reason there where reinforced was because someone got a bit aggressive one day role tacking the boat and bent a sanction and the owner being an engineer decided to beef up the base to prevent any damage.   Why don't you just take pics of the installation?   Pic  If you look at the base you will see the plate/s."

sailing,3dfv1m,zach84,4,Wed Jul 15 23:07:31 2015 UTC,"Stay in school and go racing as much as possible.  Depending on your nearest club there'll probably be boats who need crew and are willing to invest time and effort in training if you reciprocate with enthusiasm, hard work etc.  Racing is the best way to learn to sail IMO, and probably the cheapest as you won't have to pay directly for lessons. Or you could skip all that and just browse the ads on the crew boards to suit your availability.  (crewseekers.net, crewfinder.com etc)"
sailing,3dfv1m,Torstenau,3,Thu Jul 16 03:25:51 2015 UTC,"Great advice.   for years I volunteered crew Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday night races from the time I was 13 to my 20's.

Transfer to a school that has an intercollegiate sailing team, a club team, not one with a varsity team that cuts people. I was very lucky in the fact that my college's club team did not charge dues most of the years I was there, had a generous budget from the university, and had a professional coach that would come to practices and meetings. Our team practiced at a local yacht club. People at the yacht club needed crew on their dinghies and larger boats. One thing leads to another and you'll find more and more crewing opportunities if you've got the right disposition and skills."

sailing,3dfv1m,shockalock,2,Mon Jul 20 00:53:37 2015 UTC,"Well, there are a lot of ways to learn to sail.  It really doesn't need to be expensive.  Your college might have a sailing club which is a great way to get started.  I assume that you are looking to crew on a regular cruising sailboat or yacht and not some sort of super-yacht.  Once you know how to sail, you can pick up crewing positions on yachts that are doing ocean crossings or being delivered from one place to another.  Once you've done a few, word will get around that you're good crew.  The pay will vary.  At first, you'll be lucky to get your plane ticket and food covered.  With more experience, you might even make a small stipend.  Once you are experienced enough to be a delivery captain, you'll make a bit more.    You aren't going to get rich doing this, but you'll certainly find adventures!"

You may as well buckle down community college while you're doing this.   Apart from skill and talent, one of the most important things that will land you on different boats is networking. Think of sailing as a career."

Stay in school, own a boat eventually after you've learned a lot.   Stay in school, learn as much as possible from beer can races and good crews. Taking lessons from friends is better than paying for lessons, but you must be hard working, do favors, arrive early and help prepare the boat, and be social!   I always tell people circumnavigation the world is someone telling you they are a rookie and they want to climb Mount Everest. Start small and cheap and grow from there."

A beer can race is a very informal race that still challenges the skippers and crew to compete, but not in a really competitive environment that has a lot at stake (although some would debate my definition).  Racing allows you to push yourself, your boat and your crew and the learning curve is steep.  A side benifit is that once you get this under your belt, you've also established contacts with people who have the same interest, and you can then network to take it as far as you want...up to and including buying your own boat.  Have fun."

sailing,3dfv1m,SailEvenstar,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:08:07 2015 UTC,"1) Finish school.  Seriously, get it under your belt and done if you are partway there.  Nothing to do with sailing, everything to do with regrets when you haven't finished it.  I've known a lot of people that have said ""I wish I'd gone to college earlier"" or ""I wish I'd finished school"", and still haven't met anyone that said ""Boy am I sorry I burned those four years of my life"".  You will be happier in the long run and better able to make your own dreams happen if you have an education.  It may be that you are in the wrong school and the wrong program however, that bears evaluation.  2) As advised, seek out the sailing team at your school if there is one, it is probably a ""club"" that will stick anyone with commitment on a boat - even if you never sail for the A squad in a regatta you will learn a ton at practice.  3) Where you end up locally - obviously near the water, look for crewing opportunities on weeknight and weekend races.  Many boats evaluate commitment and can-do attitudes as much as skill.  A rockstar sailor that shows up late for dock call and misses half the events and all the practices will be much less welcome than someone that shows up in the spring to wetsand, makes every race and practice, and shows up for races with sandwiches or beer  but still is mastering the basics.  You won't have a key job on the boat right off, but you will learn if you are perceptive - and people will teach you.  4) There are off shore crewing opportunities in North America at rally times, when people are leaving en mass for warmer climes at the end of hurricane season for example.  As a n00b you won't get paid, and they may not want to fly you to the boat (or back to the states) but you will get fed on board and have a place to stay for a while on either end of the trip.  When you are experienced crew you may get people to fly you back.  Someplace like Hampton, VA in early November/Late October when the Salty Dawgs and Caribbean 1500 are leaving there are couple of hundred boats doing this.  Though crew positions need to be locked up earlier, there are crew finder sites to help for both Rallies.  5) Lessons if you can swing them.  ASA or US Sailing boat offer good courses.  Becoming a yacht crew on a small boat is, as others have said a ""networked"" type of thing.  There are many cruising couples on 40-60 foot boats that are looking for an extra pair of hands.  Sometimes this is only for the major passage (e.g. Galapagos to the Marquesas), sometimes they are looking for someone to stay with them if the dynamics work.  On small boats these generally won't be paid positions; depending on the boat you may be expected to kick in for food, or at least booze (which is expensive out here!) though that may vary wildly by the boat you are on.  You'd be expected to contribute like everyone else, take a share of cooking, cleaning, maintenance and chores and to look after yourself and your assigned space.  In turn you are getting a place to stay on a yacht cruising in paradise as long as you get along with the boat owners.  It's not a ""job"" per se, its more like you're a room mate in a house, so you will still need your own money for incidentals, clothes, etc.  For those type of positions cruisers out here are looking for experience with sailing as well as secondary skills like cooking or other life skills.  Newbies have it tougher, as nobody wants to babysit a barfing skill-less crew member that instantly becomes a liability instead of an asset.  Another thing to keep in mind about crewing - you are at the mercy of others somewhat.  If you sail to country X and it doesn't work out and the owner asks you to leave, you are now in country X with no place to stay.  You need to make sure whatever happens that you have a way to return and take care of yourself and funds to cover it if this happens.  In some cases Country X (like French Polynesia) may require that you have means to leave before you enter by taking a security deposit or bond in the amount of a plan fare; the boat owner isn't likely to want to put this up for you unless you've agreed on it in advance.  We saw this happen with a crew member on a remote atoll in French Polynesia - it was a mutual split as owner and crew hated each other.  But as the crew member didn't have a boat and can't pick up and go, he was left sitting on a dock in Fakarava.  Nice place, but not over run with cheap hotels and youth hostels.  He got lucky and found a ride from Fakarava, the boat owner left the atoll and singlehanded the boat to his next stop.  Good luck!"
sailing,3dfv1m,shockalock,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:22:22 2015 UTC,"See if your school has a sailing team. You may be surprised. It'll be dinghy racing but it's tons of fun and you can network through those members to help you out. Also, starting off in small boats can be just as good as a yacht, it's just different sized boats with different placement of equipment. By being on the team, you can learn tons but get a break from school without dropping out. You don't need experience to join a team (usually)."

For TV you would try and cut it down to general travel shots: look at the views, hikes, and dives.  You add only the occasional brief shots of life on board and maybe some storms thrown in to add drama.  No boat work, we want magic stress free travelling hotels  In the end I think Patreon is probably ideal for a lot of these content creators on Youtube.

The competition in the charter market of yachts around 60' is cripplingly strong (i.e. people sell their homes to buy a yacht to run as a charter business, only to go bust a few years later), and from there it's only a small step up to 100'."

sailing,3df1it,Imagine25,3,Wed Jul 15 19:34:31 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you've gone over it pretty carefully -  Typically there are a couple of quick tests that you can do yourself:   Run your hands all the way along the all the wire.  If you get snagged on a bit of wire strand sticking out (usually called a ""fish hook"") then you should consider replacing it, otherwise barring something obvious it's likely OK.  If you don't fancy catching wire in your hands, a soft cloth works (microfiber polishing clothes are great for this).  A single hook often won't stand out if you just look  it over visually. Go over the fittings with a magnifying glass (really).  They are held on by compression, squeezing the wire, and if there is any evidence of cracking then the compression will likely be lost and the fitting will come off.   You didn't say if this was salt water or fresh, but in fresh water fittings last a good long time - most the rigging on my boat is 40 years old and doing just fine, though I've replaced a few bent turnbuckles over the years."

sailing,3df1it,texasrigger,2,Wed Jul 15 21:09:23 2015 UTC,The standard for yachts (on the sea) in the UK at least is at least once every 10 years.
sailing,3df1it,texasrigger,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:44:50 2015 UTC,"Stainless rigging will start to age out at 10 to 15 years and although you get a little more life in fresh water it won't be much.  Swage fittings (standard fittings but not what is on your hobie) is work hardened through the process of swaging.  After that it is subject to cyclic loading throughout its life (even vibrations from wind blowing through it at the dock) which hardens it more and more until the metal fatigues.  In salt water these tiny failures then start crevice corrosion and they go to hell but even in fresh they are subject to the loading.  IF the swages are ok then the next point of failure is the cable.  External broken strands are easy to detect but internal ones are harder.  Sometimes you can feel the distortion in the cable caused by that.  Imagine taking the wire out of the back of a spiral bound notebook and pulling it as straight and as hard as you can.  You'll still feel a little ripple to the cable.  That feeling with cable is a red flag.  IF the wire is ok the next point of failure is the fitting itself but it's rare that this is where you first notice problems.  The two notable exceptions are mechanical terminals (norseman, stalok) that are very old and aircraft forks that will crack at the fitting due to an unfair lead (one half of the fork takes all the tension while the other half is in compression where they are designed to share the tension load equally)  Now to answer your question.  Hobies use nicropress terminals.  These are soft copper sleeves and are not subject to the same problems as the stainless so you typically don't see problems at properly applied terminals.  However, kinked wire = bad wire.  If you can't work out the kink by hand it's time to condemn it.  Edit:  Forgot to mention with conventional rigging (in my personal experience and in the experience of other riggers I've talked to) the upper fittings are MORE likely to develop problems than the lower fittings.  This directly contradicts the conventional wisdom of most boat owners but it's true nonetheless."
sailing,3df1it,bplipschitz,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:39:39 2015 UTC,"Seeing as how you are a pro rigger, I will take your advice as the way it is.   I would rather spend the $200~ now than push it a couple more months.  Its better to get new wires than lose the mast.  ><  One more question for you, where would you recommend I order new rigging?  Does anyone out there make an ""84 Hobie 16 standing rigging package""?  I was thinking of going with http://www.murrays.com/02-0204-.html.   Should I go with the marine eye?  Or the double swaged thimble? Is the 1/8"" wire sufficient?  Or should I splurge and get the 5/32"" wire?  I get the impression I want uncovered to better detect issues in the future, is this true?    Do you have any recommendations on how to measure the standing rigging if I need to order custom sizes?  I know Hobie has changed the lengths of their rigging over the years.  I assume I have the older length rigging, as I am pretty sure I have the older style Jib.  It would be nice to be certain of this though.    Sorry to assault you / this forum with questions.  The only sailing club is 5~ hours away and this is my only resource.

Wouldn't hurt to try.  Ninja edit:  Also, those fittings don't say stainless steel.  You might want to check on that.  If they're not stainless, they are absolutely the wrong choice for your centerboard."

Install the thimble on one end, the button on the other, and feed the button end up through the bottom of the boat onto the winch.  Then you just attach the thimble loop to the centerboard (in my case it's a swing keel), and you're done.  And you saved yourself $50 on a tool that you'll use once every few years at most."
sailing,3dfduw,POTUS,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:29:15 2015 UTC,"This is an option too but it would require to remove the pin on the centerboard to slip the thimble through it. But I want to redo the lifelines too so I was thinking of permanently keep this tool, it if can work on SS"

sailing,3dfduw,POTUS,2,Wed Jul 15 22:40:36 2015 UTC,"I get that.  But this is something you want to do right.  If something breaks, either the thimble or the sleeve you couldn't quite crimp properly because you couldn't get the torque on it, then that 250lb centerboard is going to fall while you're out on the water.  It's not going to fall at a good time like when it's on the hard, it will do it as soon as you go to lower it or raise it.  It's your call.  But I don't think taking that pin out is going to take more than a couple minutes."

But then once you read a few blogs and watch a few videos, everything just falls into place one piece at a time.    That centerboard pin is just another piece.  I'll bet you a beer once you put a needlenose plier on those cotter pins and pull the sucker out, you'll realize just how simple the job is going to be."

Another time I heeled so far over the Pirateer took on water and the cockpit was 3/4 full of water (and I forgot my bailing bucket) so it was a very slow return to port.   My experience crewing larger boats taught me a lot about efficient use of headsails (I crew the foredeck) and helped shore up my terminology but there was nothing mind-blowing that I felt I had missed or was doing wrong 'all this time'.   Ultimately, if you start small there are very few sailing mistakes you can't recover from. The wind and the waves will tell you whether or not you did it right. And if you did it wrong, recover, learn, try again."

sailing,3dcsqa,Ratoret,11,Wed Jul 15 06:56:45 2015 UTC,"You have to realize that you're basically asking 'how can I get paid to do something that everyone else pays for'.  There's a lot of competition, so charter skippers can pick and choose. Typically they'll pick the most attractive, perky girl they can find, and she'll spend her time cooking, cleaning and looking after the guests (while sailing on a nice boat, somewhere equally nice). She's probably happy to do this for free for a month or so. When she gets tired or short of money, the skipper could either pay her just enough to stop her leaving, or find someone else who is willing to work for free.  Charter skippers generally don't sail too hard, their boats are set up for small crews and the guests are usually happy to lend a hand with the fun sailing jobs, so they don't need much help.   The same sort of supply/demand rule applies to all sailing jobs, whether it's instructing or deliveries. If there's a large pool of equally qualified people, and the job is fun, you won't be paid much (if anything), won't have any security and might have to be friends with the right person to get it.  Source: I spent 6 months as an unpaid charter skipper. I loved it but left when it started to feel like I was just working for free.

sailing,3dc87v,127fascination,6,Wed Jul 15 03:27:09 2015 UTC,"I've done most of my offshore solo. You have an auto pilot and, as mentioned in other comments, you don't need to constantly tack - the wind offshore is generally pretty steady (and, if/when it finally changes, you need to wake up).   As for collision - the older way was a radar detector - an alarm that would go off if another ship running radar came within X miles of you. The new way is AIS.   The only time you're seriously sleep deprived and super busy is approaching/leaving large ports. Oh - and storms - and there's almost no excuse to getting in major storms these days (weather reports)"
sailing,3dc87v,wiseleyb,5,Wed Jul 15 04:24:39 2015 UTC,A lot of them don't sleep for extended periods of time. I heard a guy on a podcast say he sets an egg timer for every 20minutes when he sleeps so he can look around and go back to sleep.
sailing,3dc87v,kmo9e,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:46:18 2015 UTC,That's normally when they are close to last (I.e shipping) or weather systems are changing rapidly. Once they are out into oceans they can sleep for longer periods 1h30 - 2hrs depending on their natural sleep cycle. They have done a lot of research into sleep science to determine the optimum time.
sailing,3dc87v,Quagers,2,Wed Jul 15 09:04:43 2015 UTC,"As far as driving the boat, they use highly tuned autopilots, which work together with all on the other instruments onboard to maintain a high speed at a controller setting. As far as sleeping goes, short spurts of sleep, ~25 mins enough to hit REM for a few. And collision avoidance is all AIS and radar based. Also most of these boats are designed/sailed for reaching, so tacking and gibing aren't a concern while they're sleeping."
sailing,3dc87v,Sld109,2,Wed Jul 15 05:31:11 2015 UTC,"One of the Class 40 guys was posting on SA about his Transat race, he noted that they had done their first gybe of the race at 1800nm or something. As for collision avoidance, for a large part of the trip there is noone around. when there is another boat, chances are it will have AIS on and be picked up by the collision sensor. When they are coastal they need to keep a much stricter visual lookout, catnaps only"
sailing,3dc87v,rantifarian,2,Wed Jul 15 06:18:17 2015 UTC,"The soundest strategy for a single-handed sailor would be to use the Trade Winds. If everything goes well, you'll be running downwind all the time, no need to tack.  The soundest strategy for collision avoidance is AIS and Radar, which can be configured for proximity alerts. Being awake 24/7 is not a sound strategy. You might as well sail drunk, your reaction time and decision making will become seriously flawed, there are also reports of hallucination. You need sleep but that doesn't go well with your responsibility to have a lookout at all time. It's a trade-off either way. Luckily, the odds of hitting another vessel on the Atlantic Ocean are pretty low because of its sheer size."

sailing,3d9lfh,kmo9e,9,Tue Jul 14 17:02:43 2015 UTC,"Actually we were on a little barrier island, but the wind was blowing us into it, so I had to anchor off the back.

I think the draft was something crazy like 18- 20 inches so beaching was not a problem. The Hunter is also know for a wide beam which makes the living area a lot bigger then one would think.

Pay $10 to launch instead of >$300/month moorage, easy to clean the bottom, and as a sailing buddy of mine says ""nothing goes to wind like a 4x4"".  Of course, the trade off is at the slip I can show up, spend 15 minutes getting ready, and head off, whereas I'd either need to store it in a boatyard or spend a couple hours rigging every time I want to sail."

I did beer cruise in 2008 in my Catalina 22 when my boy was small.  Then twice more on chartered boats. My 3 cruises this year were on my Cal 29', perfect size to single handle, any bigger I would need crew to help me out.  The 29 does not make the trip cooler in the heat, but it does give everyone a little more room to spread out compared to the 22.

Most sailing does not really require fancy knot work, and like anything practice at the basics is important. Being able to tie a bowline whilst under pressure and KNOW it won't come loose is very valuable, as is being SURE you won't get a  granny knot rather than a reef knot!   Of course there are speciality rope work that is fun as you go deeper (whipping, splicing and other knots) but they are most certainly not required."
sailing,3daxxd,fragglerock,5,Tue Jul 14 22:08:13 2015 UTC,"Being able to tie a bowline whilst under pressure and KNOW it won't come loose is very valuable   When I used to teach sailing, I would teach my students to tie a bowline with their eyes closed, and also behind their backs.  Sometimes when you need a bowline, you need it FAST. You should be able to tie one in your sleep."
sailing,3daxxd,Guygan,4,Tue Jul 14 23:10:56 2015 UTC,"Actually that's a longer list than I normally recommend.  You got knots, bends, and hitches.  A knot is tying a line to itself and for the most part it falls in to either a stopper (figure 8) or a loop (bowline).  A bend is tying two lines together.  For that you have a sheet bend (structurally identical to a bowline) and reef knot (although this is more for tying two ends of a line together).  A hitch is tying a line to something.  If the pull is perpendicular to the load a clove hitch and if it's parallel then use a rolling hitch.  Those are broad categories and there are exceptions to every rule but knowing one or two out of each (knot, bend, hitch) will carry you through 99%.  I tie literally hundreds of knots and splices but fall back on those basics for nearly everything."
sailing,3daxxd,texasrigger,3,Tue Jul 14 22:20:44 2015 UTC,"Those ought to cover you pretty well.    There are some varieties on HOW to tie those that are helpful, in different situations.

I didn't describe that well, and probably can't describe it well without going and finding a post, and doing it while making notes..."

sailing,3dbnha,Guygan,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:06:54 2015 UTC,We would probably get a small lift off of our dock. Laser 2 would be the perfect boat as well but I cant find any boats for sale. Where would be a good place to look?

sailing,3dbnha,rantifarian,2,Wed Jul 15 22:41:34 2015 UTC,"It will be soft, no doubt about it. We raced a new i420 for 3 years, it was noticeably softer by the time we were done. i420s of that vintage I sailed were so soft that the centrboard case would flex up and down when you sheeted on, and the hull would pop in when you pulled rig tension on.   If you want to drag the boat up the beach, something like a Hobie 14 or 16 is your best bet. Any monohull dinghy with a hint of performance (like trap and kite) will not deal will with living on a beach, whereas hobies and a lot of other old beach cats are designed for it"
sailing,3dbnha,ep1032,2,Wed Jul 15 03:00:12 2015 UTC,what does soft mean?
sailing,3dbnha,rantifarian,2,Wed Jul 15 03:23:43 2015 UTC,"The hull becomes more flexible, basically. Older i420s are notorious for it, when you try and pull on full rig tension they will often get little crease marks in the hull running down from the chainplates.   If you sail a new, stiff hull and and older one side by side you can notice the difference in feeling as you hit a wave, the newer boat feels sharper, whereas the older one will feel (comparitively) like it is wiggling over and through the wave. Think of a high pitched cracking verse a low pitched juddering"
sailing,3dbnha,ep1032,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:54:29 2015 UTC,Does it matter for anything other than feel?  Does a soft hull imply that it is more likely to break up in really heavy water?
sailing,3dbnha,rantifarian,2,Wed Jul 15 04:36:51 2015 UTC,"It is slower, as the flexing hull absorbs more energy. The hull is not likely to break up, but it is softer due to micro cracking in the resin, so the structure is weaker as a result  It matters more in i420s as you can't get enough rig tension on, which is pretty critical for upwind speed"
sailing,3dbnha,rantifarian,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:40:40 2015 UTC,"So you actually see a large, and noticeable speed drop?  I'm surprised.  That would explain why a guy in another thread was saying a softer hull is bad for deep ocean boats (I guess it'd take another week or so to cross?)  Does this mean you can basically test to see the age of a hull by speed testing a boat against known speeds for others of its type?"
sailing,3dbnha,rantifarian,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:58:03 2015 UTC,"the speed difference would only be noticeable at the front of a competitive one design fleet, not at cruising level of trim. More along the lines of a boatlength a minute, rather than 1/2 a knot or something like that.  You can tell how hard an i420 has been used by how much rig tension you can pull on. We sailed 3-4 days a week in the tropics for 3 years, and by the end of that we were struggling to get it to hold 40 or whatever number it was on the loos gauge. Another year or two of good use would have had it maxing out at 37 or 35 maybe, and degrading until it was pretty rooted like our old club boat that couldn't get above 25  I don't know what the bloke in the other thread was talking about, maybe how stiff the boat was in terms of ballast ratio or something? That is more the sort of stiffness people talk about in terms of offshore boats"
sailing,3dbnha,rantifarian,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:41:22 2015 UTC,"What I meant by soft was more water logged, maybe I'm not using the right word? Would simply being soft as you describe it be a reason to not buy it?  Also, beach boat may have been misleading. We will likely get a small lift to put next to our dock to raise it out of the water, so it wont be staying on the beach. We have a decent amount of beachfront but not a whole lot of depth, so no where to really put a multihull."
sailing,3dbnha,Guygan,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:15:10 2015 UTC,"I don't think there are many places for a 420 to absorb water, if there are any at all, so it shouldn't be waterlogged.   How big are you? An older 505 or even a flying Dutchman may be a better boat, they are world's more robust than a 420 and will last pretty well forever if you take care of them. The FD would be best for a couple of adults in the larger size, the 505 should be fine provided you aren't tiny.  I am a bit confused what you mean by lots of beach front but no depth? Do you mean the beach is long, but only a couple of metres from the start of the beach to high tide line, or that the area is shallow?"
sailing,3dbnha,dhmmjoph,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:07:06 2015 UTC,"I am about 5'10"" 150lbs, my dad is maybe 180? and my brothers are lighter than I am. I'll look into the 505 and FD, thanks.  We have 80-100 feet of beachfront that backs up to a pretty steep hill. We have a cottage on a flatter part of the hill (it gets steep again up to the road) then stairs down to the beach. Then a boathouse and pump house and two docks take up some space. Also we have a small break wall to collect beach, so it will be 20+ feet of depth on one side and a few feet on the other. Basically just no room to have a cat on the beach all summer. Here is the view from the deck of my cottage, you can't see the beach but I hope it gives you an idea of what I mean."
sailing,3dbnha,texasrigger,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:42:25 2015 UTC,"Ahh right, I see what you mean, not a lot of space there.  Given your family is average or lighter, probably look more at the 505 than the FD.

It'll also give you a somewhat better chance of understanding Portuguese, which is spoken in some surprising potential waypoints on a circumnavigation – Mozambique, for example, and Macau. Spanish would also help if your circumnavigation takes you through the Phillipines.  In theory, French would be helpful in Vietnam and much of Africa, but the French spoken by the guys I know from various places in Africa is not intelligible to Americans who have learned French as spoken in France.  I'd throw in Malay/Bahasa Indonesia, as well, because it's a fairly simple language that you could easily encounter on a circumnavigation."

sailing,3d9avl,reyomnwahs,2,Tue Jul 14 15:27:46 2015 UTC,"In his second book, Baldwin talks a bit about his knack with languages. He says he has a passable ability to speak four or five languages, none of them fluently, but enough to have basic conversations / buy stuff / etc, and that while he probably sounds like a buffoon, it's been really useful. I'd say that approach isn't a bad one - if I were doing a circumnavigation I'd probably buy as many language CDs and the like I could and work on learning the basics of the next destination during each passage.   I personally speak fairly bad High School Spanish and even worse Middle School French, but when I've been in-country it usually is enough to get by, and I pick things up pretty quick - to Baldwin's point the ability to pick things up quickly may be more important than a specific language."
sailing,3d9avl,SailEvenstar,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:32:56 2015 UTC,"Depends where you want to go, of course.  My wife and I speak French, which was very helpful in the French West Indies (St. Martin, Guadeloupe, Martinique) and all throughout French Polynesia.  Spanish would have been helpful in Panama, my son speaks a little but I didn't know much going there.  By the time we left a few months later I could give instructions to a cab driver or order something at the meat counter in a grocery.  Most people had some English.  In the Galapagos my pidgin Spanish from Panama helped a lot.  Since leaving there though I've probably forgotten all of it, and really brushed up on my French in FP.  A LOT of people speak English though, so we've never been completely unable to communicate, and even then modern technology is a help.  I conducted a lengthy discussion with a Panamanian technician with the help of Google Translate and our smart phones.  Given my experiences so far I'd think French was the better choice for us, but I will probably change that if we ever cruise South & Central America more."

We considered an O'Day or other boat with a molded fiberglass cockpit and more of a cuddy or cabin, but when we saw the Highlander in person we knew it was for us.  The cockpit is very deep, harder for the kids to fall out and they're well below the boom.  We took a test drive yesterday and found the boat very stable and forgiving.

sailing,3d7uew,everyday-scientist,2,Wed Jul 15 01:56:59 2015 UTC,"Here is the explanation of what happened to the boat (which is named Shameless) from the boat's skipper.   On Saturday, July 11th, Shameless, J/22 # 536 experienced a near total sinking event. After rounding mark 5 of the third race of the Aspen Open Regatta, Shameless was hit by an approximately 60 kt. gale force wind. While no wind instruments were aboard, several experienced sailors that were on the course were consulted, and the consensus was that the wind was in the 50 to 60 kt range.   The wind on the previous leg from the weather mark to mark 5, (the leeward mark) was approximately 25 to 30 knots. After dousing her spinnaker, Shameless rounded mark 5 carrying only the mainsail. Within 10 seconds of rounding the mark the gale hit. Shameless was on port tack and was knocked down to leeward. The mast was in the water and the boat was sitting fairly stable on her starboard gunwale. Normally in this situation the boat would right itself and point up to windward, however, due to the intense wind pressure on the bottom of the hull the boat continued to roll into a ""turtle"" position, upside down. The force of the wind on the keel continued to roll the boat until she was on her port gunwale. By this time, water had begun entering the cabin through the companionway and the boat began sinking by the stern. As the sinking progressed I ultimately positioned myself near the bow because that was that was the only part of the vessel still above water.   By this time, rescue vessels had arrived from the Aspen Yacht Club and began pulling the crew from the water. I estimate that there was 12 to 18 inches of the bow still above water when I climbed aboard the rescue boat. The crew was taken to the Aspen Yacht Club where we re-united and dried ourselves out.  Much of the boat's loose equipment was picked up by rescue boats and brought back to the AYC. Among the equipment returned was the sails, cabin cushions, toolbox with tools, cooler and various other items.  Unbeknowst to the crew, a private motor vessel from the Aspen Yacht Club had attached a line to the bow ring used for pulling the boat onto a trailer and towed the boat into shallow water near Freeman Mesa Beach. Upon learning of this, some of the crew and other AYC members utilized two AYC vessels in an effort to salvage the boat. By attaching a line to the starboard spinnaker turning block and using the buoyancy of the RC boat ""Waterbed"", we were able to raise the boat a considerable amount, although not enough to get the companionway above water. We then took the jib halyard and passed it to another motorboat from the AYC and they backed away from the boat which then brought the companionway above the lake level. Several of us then proceeded to bail out the cabin with a 5 gallon bucket that is kept aboard the boat. Ultimately, the boat floated off the rocks and was towed back to the Aspen Yacht Club."

But in lighter conditions it should be manageable. What type of water are you sailing on?   Overall, the 20 is a big boat with a lot of power. I always go out with another experienced sailor to crew or skipper. Usually both of us have our hands full. For $1k though, if everything seems ok condition, its probably worth it. Worst case, you can sell it for the same or more."

sailing,3d7572,Chaos_Spear,3,Tue Jul 14 01:25:05 2015 UTC,"Foreyard.  A ""yardarm"" is the part of the yard outboard of a lift.  A ""fore royal yard"" would be a yard on a fore royal mast: traditional sailing rigs often have masts in multiple pieces - the foremast is forward of the mainmast (the tallest one) and the bottom piece is traditionally just called the foremast as well.  On top of the foremast is the fore topmast.  On top of that is the fore topgallant mast.(pronounced t'gallant mast)  On top of THAT is the fore royal mast.  That's where you'd find the fore royal yard, with the fore royal sail on it.  Source: I've been working on Tall Ships for about 6 years now.  Edit: I'm assuming that the forward mast is shorter than the after mast, judging by their relative placement on the boat."

sailing,3d6bl2,oldhaggus2,4,Mon Jul 13 21:31:41 2015 UTC,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but doesn't the jib, as well as the main sail, produce lift? I prefer easing out on the main since it is the bigger of the two sails, thus being the more powerful and responsive.  I would find it troublesome, as a skipper, to have the jib eased out on the boat. I would be sacrificing the use of the tell tales and consequently speed in order to keep the boat down."
sailing,3d6bl2,Mr_Potato_Man,4,Mon Jul 13 22:19:28 2015 UTC,"I personally never dump the jib to gain control of the boat. That's what's mainly pointing your boat upwind, not your rudder, so you want to keep that secure as much as possible.  What I do when the boat isn't under control is judge my action by the surrounding wind. If the wind is consistently heavy then it would be best to start pinching/feathering because dumping that main won't do much. You might as well take advantage of that heavy wind. But if it's just a really heavy puff.. then it's best to ease out the main until the boat is under control again then start slowly easing back in when you pass the puff. Hope that helps."

sailing,3d6bl2,lazy_midshipman,2,Mon Jul 13 22:15:43 2015 UTC,Main is faster to dump. The jib also powers up the mainsail.
sailing,3d6bl2,texasrigger,2,Mon Jul 13 22:21:54 2015 UTC,"TLDR: Ease/Hike/Trim. Opti-tier shit.  Jib helps get height, or ""pointing"". If you dump the jib you're gonna slow way down, and the boat's still gonna be overpowered. Pit the jib where the telltales are streaming on both sides, and lock it off (winch/cleat, idgaf what boat you're on)  Mainsheet is what you use to depower. If you're overpowered, on any boat worth a damn, make sure your sail controls are maxed out. Outhaul on to flatten the sail, vang on to tighten the leach and pull the boom down, and cunningham on to flatten the main's entry. Also, your halyard should be at full hoist. This blades out the sail and makes your lift more efficient.   The analogy I like best is the difference between the wing on a jumbo jet and a fighter jet. You need lift on both, but since the air is going over the wing on the fighter so much faster, they can afford a thinner, faster wing.   Next, look at your standing rigging. If you're consistently sailing in heavy air, put a couple more turns on your shrouds. big difference.  Feather up in puffs and microbursts. You gain extra height you wouldn't otherwise, which helps a lot when racing. Put some backstay on to flatten the sail even further. I bet you don't have runners though ;)  Dump the traveler. that's an easy fix, just pop the line out of the cleat and the boom will drop fuckin' fast. Still overpowered? Ease the mainsheet."

sailing,3d6bl2,SailEvenstar,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:27:56 2015 UTC,"Probably main? I really only sail lasers so don't take my word on it. Here's why I think so, though.   Letting out the jib will move your Centre of Effort backwards, increasing weather helm. Since you're already overpowered and have leeward heel, you'll now have crazy weather helm and have to compensate a lot with the rudder, slowing you down.   If you ease on the main, the CoE will shift forwards, increasing lee helm and reduce your leeward heel, as your sails have less power in them.  Instead of doing either though, hike harder! Tighten sail controls (outhaul, cunningham first, then vang) and hike your legs to death. You know it's been a good time sailing when you purposefully avoid stairs for a few days afterwards :p"
sailing,3d6bl2,rantifarian,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:20:41 2015 UTC,"Dump the traveler first, if that is feasible and you have a decent traveler setup.  If you can't dump traveler (like on a Laser) or its not enough then ease the main a bit.  I'd never dump the jib to reduce heel.

sailing,3d4puv,oldhaggus2,2,Mon Jul 13 21:54:56 2015 UTC,"Some days it is just too damn hot to be out there without risking heat exhaustion, and it is a pretty dangerous thing IMO, as your decision making gets poorer as it gets more severe. Saying that, I have never called off a day sailing because it was too hot, I just took more care  Getting really regimented with the water is a good  idea. Start by drinking plenty before heading out, making sure you are fully hydrated and over your hangover from the previous night. It is bloody hard to catch up on a hangover on a hot sunny day.  Set yourself a target and make sure you stick to it. 600ml every 2 hours maybe, or even every hour if it is a really hot day. Stick to the schedule, and make sure you catch up if you fall behind.  I have drunk 8 litres of water in a single hard day in the desert, a co-worker drank 12 a few days later.  You can go through a lot of water in bad conditions. If you are drinking epic amounts of water, some electrolyte replacement might be a good idea. We usually had one with lunch and one about 3pm on the stinker days, just electrolyte replacement powder, not the sugar filled sports drinks.   Don't drink too much booze, especially early on in the day.   Wear long sleeves and a breathable hat, like the horribly ugly shit fisherman wear. Make sure you have a collar, and that it is popped. Worth looking like a bit of a tool for no sunburnt neck. Long, breathable pants are a good idea, although I can't stand wearing them sailing personally."

The spinnaker pole is also longer than the distance from the mast to the forestay, which helps with most hammocks.  On my boat (Pearson 28-2, the J is a little shorter than a Catalina 30) there is just barely enough length to get a Hennessey camping hammock under the spinnaker pole.

sailing,3d2ub4,Shinysideshiny,1 point,Mon Jul 13 09:32:43 2015 UTC,"Lasers? They're the most popular dinghy class worldwide. Most certainly not training boats.  They were designed as daysailers that could be car-topped, so people could keep them at home and take them to the lake/river/sea for the day and not spend an inordinate amount of time rigging or derigging. They were inexpensive and easy to sail.  Because they were so accessible, they became ibcredibly popular. People started racing them. Then people starting making improvements to race them better. Then everybody starting racing them. Then those improvements became necessary to be competitive in racing them.  There are three different rig classes: full/standard, radial, and 4.6. Radials are smaller than full rigs, and typically raced by women. 4.6 is the smallest, and is typically raced by those just stepping up from Optis.  I'm not personally a fan - there's a lot of really finnicky stuff that you need to do to push enough performance out of them to be really competitive, there are design improvements that need to be made but can't/won't, and they're not built to last. As a rec boat for puttering around a lake on a decently breezy day? Sure. As a high-performance racer? No thank you."

sailing,3d1h5e,Thjoth,3,Mon Jul 13 02:37:56 2015 UTC,"English is a Germanic language and defaults to the normal Germanic pronunciation of -sch- when it's in the middle of a word regardless of the language that the word comes from.  Look at how it's pronounced in the German words schlaff, schnee, or schnaps.  So, when the word ""bruschetta"" comes across, it gets the Germanic pronunciation as well.  When sch- is at the beginning of the word, it defaults to one of two pronunciations.  The normal Germanic one like ""Schnaps,"" or the alternate Germanic one that has been deformed over the years into ""school"" or ""schooner.""

There are many other words in English usage that are spelled with ""sch"" that follow different rules.  One example would be ""eschew"".  The fact that ""schooner"" is pronounced one way does not make it a universal rule.  When you make that assumption, you're assuming just as much as a person who assumes that it should follow the same rule as ""eschew"".  Essentially you are calling other people idiots for doing the same thing as you are doing, i.e. making assumptions about pronunciation rules that involve extending a rule from one cultural origin to another.

I started with an old Barnett butterfly from the 70s with trailer for 600 bucks. After sailing it for a year, I felt ready to move up to a better sailing dinghy, a brand new Laser Pico (5K with kickass trailer).  I am weight limited by a small car so once my skill level is at a comfortable enough level, I will probably buy a small cruiser on the cheap and learn on that.  Then one day after many years of getting my chops in on freshwater and many times bareboating in saltwater, then I will be comfortable going whole hog.  So advice?

You don't start with a 50 as that would be like taking someone who doesn't even have a learner's permit yet, and then getting in the seat of an 18 wheeler and driving cross country.  Start with a small daysailer. Then move up to something like a large daysailer or pocket cruiser ( 22 feet and under).  Next move up to a midsized boat in the 20 range (max 30).  Once comfortable, you can know if you need to jump up the extra 10 boat feet to the 40.  Remember that boat prices get more and more expensive and fickle from maintenance the higher you go.  Best to ease into it.  I know too many folks that immediately jumped into a big boat and make alot of expensive mistakes.  Alot easier to stomach on a smaller boat."

I like nice beamy boats with quite a bit of body to them. Slow, but stable! However, you can't say that something from the 20s or 30s that is an ocean racing boat isn't a blue water vessel! Long, thin and fast with a long stern overhang. Uncomfortable as all hell for a crossing, but definitely a ""blue water boat"". However, look at most of the MacGregor line and we can all say ""better keep to the coasts or lakes in that"".    I think a good hull shape is critical. Nice deep, full keel (for traditional boats, some of those dutch boats with side boards are great blue water vessels). It might be prejudice, but when I see a sexy shape underwater it goes a long way towards the ""blue water"" definition for me."

Long, thin and fast with a long stern overhang. Uncomfortable as all hell for a crossing, but definitely a ""blue water boat"".    Interestingly, this contributed to us holding the cup for so long.  Challenging boats had to cross an ocean to challenge whereas our boats were built to be coastal.  Those longer overhangs were built to workaround design rules at the time that were limiting waterline length.  Long overhangs produce a much bigger boat than what the waterline would suggest.  They weren't viewed as bluewater boats at the time, it was purely for performance.  If you look at the boats built in that same era by the same designers for seaworthiness you have a very different shape."

No engine, no lifelines, no nothing.  Despite that it's been around the world (multiple times), visited the arctic, been iced in in Antarctica, and still won numerous classic boat races.  It all comes back to quality of construction and intention of design."
sailing,3d1btl,Sloppy_Omelette,5,Mon Jul 13 02:24:30 2015 UTC,"""Blue water"" means different things because of the different areas people sail, expectations of amenities, expectations of speed and handling, safety requirements, and of course budgets.  Some people want boats where you batten down the hatches and wait out storms, while others watch radar closely and because their boats can often go 300-400 nm a day, they can avoid the worst weather for the most part.  That speed might mean some boats can go out while others have to stay at anchor.  With performance often comes not just cost, but some instability.  Some people want a boat that no matter how stupidly you handle it you can never get it to turtle.    If you are going to sail in northern latitudes, a catamaran might not be the ideal design, but in shallow areas the very stable boats with huge drafts will hit stuff.  A catamaran might provide room that some people require if they are going to spend long stretches on a boat, while others are ok with being in a tiny box with just a watermaker, nav equipment, and a propane stove.  If you specify I want to:  Sail which regions  How many people  Experience  Room/ Amenities needed  Budget  And so forth, someone might be able to say which brands will be the best fit, otherwise it is kind of a useless question."
sailing,3d1btl,rantifarian,3,Mon Jul 13 06:11:28 2015 UTC,"I would point first to draft, and second to freeboard.   The best blue water boats I've been on are extremely well balanced, able to carry sail neatly while not requiring a helmsman for balance."
sailing,3d1btl,GooglesYourShit,3,Sun Jul 12 22:04:50 2015 UTC,"For me, the boat must be still able to make way in 40+knots in any direction, and be able to handle 60+ under sea anchor or drogue.   There must be a crash bulkhead in the bow, and the rudder gear must be sealed from the rest of the hull with a proper bulkead (not full of wiring and plumbing holes like some manufacturers)  The galley, chart table and at least 1 bunk must be useable in seriously shitty seas too.   It must be somewhat easy to sail: balanced helm, reliable method hods of sail handling and reefing, a sane deck layout (looking at you ior winch farms).   I think criteria such as long keels and cockpit enclosures are more of a distraction from what you really want offshore: a boat that can do whatever you ask of it without question."
sailing,3d1btl,sumactrebla,5,Mon Jul 13 02:27:14 2015 UTC,"To me, the biggest factors are size, ease of use, ease of navigation, and having the proper facilities to allow you to live aboard for days or weeks at a time without having to return to a slip or marina of some sort.    Size, typically meaning a larger beam and larger keel (which you can't have without more length), because larger boats handle rough water better than smaller boats, and a larger keel typically means more ballast, and more control in higher winds.  Also less likely to get pushed about by currents.  You never know quite when the seas will turn on you, so you need a larger boat that can handle those freak moments.  Second, ease of use really means ease of sailing.  Can all sail controls be accessed from the cockpit?  What about an autopilot feature?  If a freak storm or windy moment comes in, can the sails be lowered quickly and efficiently, all from the cockpit?  This is more of a safety concern, because getting out of the cockpit to lower sails in a storm is a recipe for disaster.  Also, being forced to have someone man the tiller at all times (meaning no autopilot) can also lead to some tired crew, and tired crews make mistakes with navigation or ship handling.  You don't want that.    Ease of navigation typically includes GPS, or at least a chartplotter.  I'd also throw in weather instruments for safety.  You want to know where you are and where you are going, and know what the conditions will be like along the way.  Again, it all comes down to safety.  When you are hundreds of miles from land, you don't want to be getting lost or going in circles.    Lastly, proper facilities would relate to sustainability, ie can the vessel sustain life for up to several weeks at a time?  This typically requires a proper head, a watermaker (as well as a freshwater tank), storage for food, as well as solar panels or backup battery supply, or a generator with extra fuel.    You would also want some sort of life raft and emergency kit on a blue water vessel.  Again, it all comes down to safety.  If your boat catches fire or starts to sink, you need to be able to communicate with rescue and survive on the water until rescue can arrive."
sailing,3d1btl,c1g,2,Mon Jul 13 02:34:03 2015 UTC,"I think the expression ""blue water capable"" is arbitrary and overused,often by those who are trying to sell the dream (and their rotten old boat) to the inexperienced.    I like the term ""seaworthy"" instead. Although the definition may also be somewhat arbitrary, it has a more precise meaning in my mind. The difference? A ""blue water boat"" might have been designed, constructed, and marketed (40 years ago) to individuals as a vessel capable of navigating offshore. To be ""seaworthy"", I think a vessel must not only be well designed and constructed, but must be outfitted and maintained to a high standard. She must be prepared for her intended use.  Everyone else has already chimed in regarding their ideal characteristics for a vessel sailing offshore. Whichever terminology you prefer, I think that meticulous maintenance and preparation are just as, if not more, important than the design and type of vessel.  As recreational boaters, I think we must take responsibility for our own safety, especially as we venture offshore and choose to put ourselves in potentially dangerous situations of our own creation. No matter how large or expensively outfitted, vessels that are not maintained by knowledgeable and committed crew should not be considered ""seaworthy"". Ultimately, like any other tool, boats will function as extensions of their operators."
sailing,3d1btl,PhinMak,2,Wed Jul 15 01:48:49 2015 UTC,"sturdy, heavy keel, maybe a ketch keel. Larger fresh water tanks. Beamy. good construction."
sailing,3d1btl,rantifarian,2,Sun Jul 12 21:33:39 2015 UTC,"One of many attributes to consider is the ability of the boat to ""right"" itself in the case of a knockdown or turtle.  As a general rule, heavy full keeled boats will more easily bring themselves back to normal than those with ""shoal draft"", ""fin keel"", or some other high-aspect keel.  I'm used to calling this ""righting momentum"" but wikipedia calls it the ""metacentric height"" or ""limit of positive stability"".  You'll notice that these full keeled boats have a larger wetted area (surface area under the waterline) and are slower than the speedier modern racers that look like a saucer with a stick for a keel with a bulb at the end.  This is discussed at length in Seaworthiness: The Forgotten Factor which you seem to be able to get in hardcover for about $4 on Amazon.com...    Worst-case example:  tri and catamarans.  Once they're upside down, you'll need a crane. I've heard that racing monohulls may be unstable at even 90 degrees (knocked-down).  Take a look at Alden schooners for examples of hull and rigging designed specifically for long distance ocean cruising.  (Supposedly will right themselves at 170 degrees or more.)  Schooners have less sail area than similarly sized Marconi/cutter rigged boats, but they have 2x or more the number of sails.  Means easier to handle with fewer people... can adjust the number and kinds of sails being flown without dealing with complications of reefing... and staysail schooners can have sails the same size before the foremast and also between the main and foremast. Benefit of redundancy, etc.  There are a number of additional attributes in the DESIGN (as opposed to CONDITION) of a boat I could think of, (anything from size of the portholes to size of cockpit scuppers to accessibility of the chainplates to systems on board), but I think that stability is a good place to start."
sailing,3d1btl,glambx,2,Mon Jul 13 03:55:31 2015 UTC,"Angle of vanishing stability and limit of positive stability are common ways of describing the point where the boat would rather stay upside down than right way up. A Gz curve is a graphical repreaentation of it. Very few race boats will turtle at less than 100 degrees, and plenty of offshore race boats will have an avs above 140 degrees.   I have seen some truly bullshit claims for stability online, and wouldn't trust a number unless I knew where it came from, particularly for old boats like the Alden schooners."
sailing,3d1btl,texasrigger,2,Mon Jul 13 05:30:43 2015 UTC,"This one is easy.   All 316 stainless fittings High point of vanishing stability (ie. she'll self-right quickly after a capsize) Thick hull with encapsulated keel, and high displacement/length ratio Appropriate ground tackle (ie. will hold in 50 knots, average bottom conditions) Redundant, oversized standing rigging Heavy weather canvas with appropriate reefing options   Electronics, tankage, and domestic habitability can vary greatly, but without all the above, it ain't a bluewater boat.  edit Regarding equipment, spares spares spares.  Spare impellers, blocks, halyards, pumps, autopilots, cables, gaskets, and so on.  EPIRB, SOLAS liferaft, and SSB/satellite are good indicators.  Good solar array and wind turbine.  If you see a Rocna that's two sizes too big, it's an offshore boat.  Jacklines, dead giveaway.  Double-downwind poles?  Probably spends a lot of time in the trades.  One of the most critical elements is the captain.  The competent captain will a) not let schedule dictate his/her actions when it's unsafe to do so, and b) understand how the boat will react to various conditions and demands."

sailing,3d25f6,FlickrPaul,2,Mon Jul 13 01:18:18 2015 UTC,"And I am saying, having done it both ways on mutiple boats (foils, furlers, or hanks) many dozens of times over the span of over 25 years it doesn't necessarily make it any more difficult.  It depends more on boat make, set up, and crew work.  Real world example - on a J24 you have seperate leads for jib and genoa.  It's faster and gets weight off the bow quicker if the sheets are already attached to the sail and just quickly run through the leads from for to aft than it is to take the time to run them from back to front and then have your bowman take the time to tie them on.  Conversely, on the Hobie 33 we run the jib sheets through both the forward jib leads and the aft genoa leads to get a fair lead to the winches.  In that case it's way better to untie the sheet and reeve it out of the jib lead and retie it to the new sail if switching up to a genoa.  It depends entirely on boat design, setup, and crew."
sailing,3d25f6,texasrigger,2,Mon Jul 13 01:59:55 2015 UTC,"What happens when a sheet breaks though? With dual sheets you just tack over and quickly run a change sheet, losing only the time you spend on the non favoured tack upwind. With this you are going to have to go bareheaded to get the new sheet on.  Dual sheets with soft hanks is the only sensible solution on any boat bigger than a j/80."

Every J24 I have sailed on has had hanks for the jib, so not sure how you would do a peel, as that is what I am talking about here.  That said, it would mean you would have to keep your jib sheets attached to your headsails and as such create a huge mess of lines during headsail changes along with additional weight.  So back to my original statement, doing a peel would be harder dealing with another set of jib sheets as a posed to using the existing ones."

It sounds like you are talking theory whereas I'm trying to relay personal experience and my whole point is that it doesn't NECESSARILY introduce a problem and that other factors play a bigger role.    As for a J24 peel, yes it's not a peel per say, just a quick headsail change.  You hank on the new sail under the old (take off the bottom hank or two) and get everything ready to run.  Drop the sail, strip it off, swap the halyard, hoist.  It can be very fast but you are right in that it's not a peel."

It's not uncommon to change headsails throughout a race or to move sheets above a spinnaker pole. Dealing with threading and unthreading a 60 foot line is a hassle compared to two 30 foot ones. Also, looping it like that may slip at the wrong time.  Thick lines are easier to handle than thin ones. You can get a better grip when trimming or setting during a tack. I have two full sets, one thin for light wind, and another thicker for heavy air.  It may look cleaner, but it's not preferred for racing. Tying proper bowlines (left or right) for the appropriate sheet to avoid binding on the rigging, and proper tacking procedures is good."

Holy shit, are you preparing for armageddon?), bowlines should work. Soft shackles are the new gucci thing, so get an eye splice and put those bad boys on.

sailing,3d0oz0,Deep_blue__,8,Sun Jul 12 15:11:39 2015 UTC,"I'm in the marine service industry and have seen the consequences of a cheap boat way too often.  As a percentage, maybe 10% of ""deals"" are actually a deal.  Maybe less.  More often than not you are buying someone else's headache. The biggest problem is that if a boat is cheap enough then the cost of a survey is too great a percentage of the buying price so they don't get one meaning the buyer has to make judgements they aren't qualified to make.  Examples of problems that require special knowledge, tools, or experience to detect:   Bad chainplates -They have a working lifespan of 20 years.  Older than that?  Almost certainly bad.  And what if they are glassed in like on Island Packets or Ericksons? Water intrusion in to deck, transom, or rudder.  Delamination hasn't begun and the deck isn't soft yet but the timebomb is ticking.  Do you know how to detect for that? Bronze thru hulls look good?  Because if the boat has electrolysis issues bad enough the zinc will leech out of the alloy leaving the metal fittings very brittle and porous. How's that stainless fuel tank?  They frequently start developing pinholes at about 30 years.  Is the boat older than 1985?  Can you get to the tank to replace it or was it built in to the boat before they put the deck on. What sort of rigging does it have.  Depending on location you can get 10-15 years out of it but fittings vary.  Mil spec aircraft forks (the only rigging component  with a military spec) are terrible.  Would you know why and what to look for? Boat up to current standards for sanitation?  How expensive/easy is it to get it there? Sail cloth showing any bright yellowing?  What does that mean?   Etc.  Every system has it's pitfalls.  About the only time you truly see a good deal is if the boat is selling due to divorce or illness.  Anything else should raise alarm bells."

The boat was 32' or so and recently had about $6000 worth of work put in to it and I think it was on the market for something ridiculously low like $4500.  Sight unseen I'm guessing that someone ended up with a money pit, sunk a lot of good money into it and still has a pos boat.  The size, recent investments, and selling price coupled with the fact that he was seeing the listing (private, not brokered) 2500 miles away all suggested that.

sailing,3d0oz0,g4r4e0g,2,Sun Jul 12 15:17:35 2015 UTC,"Watch the listings. You tend to see the same boats come up again and again and again. If you see that, there is almost certainly something wrong with it. ""Cheap"" means something different to different people. Can you repair everything in the boat? Fibreglass gets soft after a while, gel coat is not actually waterproof, wood swells and steel rusts. If you can confidently replace a swing keel, ""Cheap"" is going to mean something different than if you expect to bring it into a boat yard to get fixed when something goes wrong.    Really, if you have to ask the question, you probably should be looking at something better.  So many people get a ""cheap"" boat and then realize the refit is going to cost more than the purchase price of the boat it isn't funny.   However.. on to deals!  You can find them.  Your best bet is to find someone who is selling their boat because they can't keep it or it was a parent's boat who died and they are selling it. The other place to get a good deal is to go down to a cruising stop over and shop around there. The other common thing that happens is people buy the boat, take one trip in it, realize that it is NOT for them and then fly home with the boat up for sale. However, ""cheap"" is always going to be relative.    Also, question WHY it is cheap.  Remember, in the US environmental fines transfer with the boat (unless that has changed) so you might be buying a big ass fine as well as a boat.  Also check that it wasn't smashed in a hurricane and recovered or something along those lines.    EDIT: If you have $325,000CND I can point you to a great deal on a 65' ocean going boat rigged for single handed cruising sitting off the coast of BC now (owner is now too old to handle her). That is ""cheap"" for something along those lines. As I said, it is all relative."

Once you see the projects that other people have going on, you'll begin to understand what the significant maintenance items are.  Also, if people offer to show  you around their boat, always accept and ask lots of questions.  I would also recommend responding to ads by asking brokers for a detailed inventory and/or survey report.  Every time I look at a survey report, I learn something.  Read the ad narratives about why the boat is for sale.  Become familiar with the verbage and terminology (it's funny after you do this for a while, you'll begin to pick up on errors... like a recent ad indicated that all the sea-cocks and thru-hulls had been newly ""bidded""... I have no clue what that is, but I know what rebedding a thru-hull and sea cock is)  If you look at enough pictures of used boats for sale, you'll begin to pick up on the vintages of gear.  Shop around in the cruisers forums classifieds and you'll start to understand what gear is really expensive (water makers, life rafts, engines, winches, etc.).  This help you look at a boat's inventory and determine if it's just superficial or contains really important, expensive items."

Over the course of 84 days he sailed some 4,100 miles (6,600 km) before his progress was thwarted by winds and currents. Vihlen was able to approach to within 6 miles (9.7 km) of Miami on the night of June 20 but he was pushed back to sea by offshore winds and the currents of the Gulf Stream. The United States Coast Guard launched a search for the sailor on the morning of June 21 at the request of his parents. He was first spotted by a party aboard the First Edition, a boat owned by Fort Lauderdale publisher Ted Gore who gave Vihlen food and water. Gore offered to tow Vihlen to shore but the sailor refused. Vihlen and April Fool eventually were taken aboard the United States Coast Guard Cutter Cape Shoalwater and then Vihlen transferred to the fishing boat Sea Wolf where his son and wife were waiting for him.

sailing,3czqow,YourMomsAVaper,4,Sun Jul 12 09:54:37 2015 UTC,"If you truly want to work abroad, get your American (or corresponding countries) MARINE certification in boat related occupations.  For America it is ABYC certifications.  Electrical, Rigging, Fiberglass Repair, Coatings Specialist, Diesel Mechanic.  While people are abroad, they are much more likely to want someone working on their boat who has certifications from their respective country, or another country in which they respect.  If you are cruising the Indian Ocean, or the coast of South America, how do you know the gent working on your boat truly knows what he is doing?  Short of the fact he works in a boat yard, you don't have much to go on, especially if communications are shaky because you hardly speak the local tongue.  The problem you might run into here, is that a lot of countries (rightfully so) have laws against people working within their borders without work visas.  What I found while cruising Mexico and Central America, was that Americans, Brits, and Aussies would come across local VHF asking for boat assistance in harbors, offering coconuts and drinks.  This always meant money (typically American dollars) but the local authorities were known to monitor VHF looking for people doing unauthorized boat work.

sailing,3czknj,FluffyBunnyHugs,2,Sun Jul 12 17:29:12 2015 UTC,"I don't know anything about the Chrysler.  The Catalina and Venture are both swing keel boats, boat about the same size, both have about the same below-decks space, same sail area.  And yet, the Catalina is 50% heavier.  That's because it's much more solidly built.  Heavier is usually better in terms of sailboats, it means the boat is physically stronger and it also gives you a little more staying power when pushing through waves.  The Catalina also has a lot more ballast, so she'll stay more upright and your wife will do less screaming.  Neither of these are boats that you're going to want to sail to Hawaii or anything.  But for inshore and lake daysailing, both of them are fine. The Catalina is just the most fine of these choices.  The Catalina also has the best reputation and therefore the best resale chance (and value).  Oh, and that 15hp motor is more than double what that boat needs.  You can still use it, but you'll be running at like 1/4 throttle all the time.  You don't want to run that engine at full throttle, the transom is not designed for that much power.  With any swing keel boat, the first thing you should do is replace the keel cable.  I don't care if the guy says he just changed it, just shell out the $10 for a new cable.  Do this before you take it out the first time.  The alternative is to risk having the 800lb iron keel fall and slam into the hull, which is guaranteed to cause a leak at the pivot bolt and can do a lot worse."

sailing,3czknj,reyomnwahs,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:59:09 2015 UTC,"My Venture 25 dripped a little, but only at first.  You can (and should) replace the pivot bolt and seals about every decade.  While you're doing this you should inspect it to make sure that the surfaces are all smooth so you get a good seal.  If you do it right, you should be able to completely eliminate any drips.  Before you buy it crawl down in there with a flashlight and take a look at the fiberglass around the pivot bolt.  If it isn't flat, that boat has had some problems, like probably the swing keel falling.  If it just looks like the rubber seal is cracked, then a replacement will probably fix you right up.  As long as there's no fiberglass damage, then I wouldn't consider these kinds of things to necessarily impact the selling price.  These are just to be considered normal maintenance, and as the new boat owner you should probably do them now regardless of the previous owners habits or claims."

Probably the only safety concern I'd see on smaller trailer sailors would be water ballast, in that forgetting to fill or close the ballast tanks can lead to capsize (not applicable to any of your candidates). Performance wise, the Catalina 22 has one of the more active cabin boat racing classes. The Venture was designed as a compromise, to be light enough to pull with a small car. Because of that, performance isn't great, and at least with the original sails, rigging, etc, quality of hardware isn't great either.   That said, trailer sailor owners have the luxury of using their garages as boatyards all winter, and I've seen several Ventures that were heavily upgraded. That might be the case with yours - everyone here is basing their opinion on a stock V21. I think yours might not be stock - if it was I doubt you'd see it as being the same as the C22, unless the C22 you looked at what was beat to hell and back."

sailing,3czeqi,whilstiam,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:02:19 2015 UTC,"That boat is getting on in years, so check out the fiberglass carefully, particularly the foredeck, the transom around the rudder mount, and underside of the hull, for cracks and delamination.  Also check the shroud chainplates.  If the hull has cracks, delamination, or fittings which have pulled out, you should probably keep looking.    Check the condition of the centerboard and centerboard gasket.  The gasket can be changed, but it involves some work.  The rudder hardware on some of these boats was subject to breaking, so check it carefully.   Lines and most small hardware on these boats can be replaced easily, but spars, covers, etc. may be expensive to replace.  New sails are easily available, and occasionally used sails can be found - they just take money.  Other checks would be the same for any boat - condition and quantity of all the other things will determine the value.  If possible, step the mast, secure the forestay, and unfurl the jib.  Raise the mainsail, and check for proper fit.   This will give you a chance to check the condition of the sails, and to have the previous owner show you what is included and how it works.  It is annoying and expensive to find out later that the parts you have don't work together.  Assuming it has a spinnaker, you need to check the sail, the lines, and the hardware.

Is the new step sound, with no rot, softness, or potential for future water damage?  If the mast was over tensioned, were the chainplates damaged at the same time?  Second, the conversion to Harken roller furling and a wire luff jib is a good modification, and not cheap.  But was it not completed because it didn't fit?   That is probably the reason, and further modifications may be necessary to make it fit.  Make sure you understand what it will take to make it right, or you may be getting into more work than you care to take on.   Good luck."

The article does say yes, its less effective in stable, non-shifty wind. The key is to keep a very flat boat. Its less of a 'high skill' and more of a boat handling tactic. Bow down is less complicated, more just hard work that only pays off if you CAN keep the boat flat. To practice I would recommend not trying to speed race anyone, but instead just workout alot it handle the boat, then go out in heavy, shifty wind and RACE people to see how quickly you can get from shift to shift."

sailing,3cybzm,apathy-sofa,2,Sun Jul 12 00:29:38 2015 UTC,What is the difference between this and footing?
sailing,3cybzm,pseud0nym,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:00:49 2015 UTC,"So.. I am finding this a bit confusing. My experience of sheeting out and then bearing away slightly on the upwind leg has not been positive. The mantra has always been ""FLAT FLAT FLAT"" for me. In heavy winds if they mean it is better to sheet out a bit and bear away than luff.. okay, that I buy. But I think I would need to see it in practice to understand exactly what they were getting at. The rest of the time I would think you would want to be up as tight as you can with the sails as full as you can as flat as possible.  Perhaps they mean putting a bit more power into the rig at high wind speeds?    Anyhow, someone mentioned waves.  Body movement through waves on a Laser is critical to maintaining speed. You want to move back as you come up the wave to pop the bow over, and then move forward over the top of the wave to get you back down. Not as easy as it sounds at a full hike.    Would love to hear more about this technique. Anyone actually use it?"
sailing,3cybzm,pseud0nym,2,Sun Jul 12 16:34:39 2015 UTC,"As the article said, bow down is very hard to do physically as the sail has more power, making you need to hike harder... But as you gain speed it becomes slightly easier as your apparent shirts forwards. While now down, you go so much faster that your velocity made good towards the mark is faster than the vmg in pointing mode, close hauled.  What you said about waves is contradictory to what I learnt - torque forwards into the wave, and back out of it. This keeps the boat flat, minimizing disturbance of wind flow over the sail. Could you explain why you do it your way?"
sailing,3cybzm,pseud0nym,0,Sun Jul 12 17:11:04 2015 UTC,"As I read the article some things stuck out at me. For one, he talks about weather helm. You really shouldn't be having weather helm at all when heading up wind if you're keeping the boat balanced. In fact, you should be using the heal of the boat to steer! The tiller itself should be loose in your hands. Every bit of energy used by the rudder to turn the boat is energy that isn't being used to drive the boat forward. So it is making me think that this is another method to deal with big winds. The talk about the apparent wind shift seems to me to say you are still close hauled (Block on block).     However, that last two inches or so of traveler doesn't really pull the sail in any more. It bends the top of the boom down and flattens out the sail. So I can see sheeting out to get a bit more power, assuming that isn't going to knock you over. It is the bearing away part that I am not seeing how it will help.  If you are in high winds and luffing to keep the boat flat..well that isn't good.  Better to bear away a bit and gain more speed with a fuller sail. If you are going fast, you are going to bear away a bit anyhow as your apparent wind shift forward.    Anyhow, the article seems to assume that people are healing excessively and not keeping the boat flat in the first place. For me, that is the number one critical thing. A flat boat is a fast boat and the flatter it is, the faster you go.    For the waves.  The first move back is to pop the bow up over the wave so it doesn't dig in. The move forward is just as you get to the top to break the water tension on the stern and pull the boat up and over the crest of the wave. Hopefully that will get you onto a bit of a surf and you can move back and ride the hill on the way down.     EDIT: Thinking about this some more. I think I know what they are taking about, it just never had a name when I was racing competitively. We would pop the block upwind so that it doesn't pull the boom down and bend the mast. That gives you more power as it doesn't flatten the sail. Where I am really confused is on the bearing away. Yes, if you go faster you will be bearing away as the apparent wind shifts, but you are still close hauled. The difference is you have a fuller sail..."
sailing,3cybzm,pseud0nym,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:24:28 2015 UTC,"You don't have your sail block to block as you bear off; have it a few inches out. To prevent the boom from going straight up, you have to crank the vang. This keeps the boom down, and lets the sail go out instead of up when you sheet out. Having a high power sail (more cup) doesn't matter anymore, as you should already be going fast enough to maintain speed with flatter sails. This is why flat boat is important, because as soon as you get weather helm you'll head up, lose proper trim, and lose speed."
sailing,3cybzm,pseud0nym,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:58:50 2015 UTC,"But if you are getting weather helm you either have your center of effort behind your center of lateral resistance so need to adjust your sails or you are healing excessively in the first place. That is where the disconnect is happening for me. In either of those two situations you need to either adjust your sail controls or flatten the boat rather than bring the ""bow down"" and using a technique to overcome it. To my mind, properly adjusted sails and a flat boat should come first...   So what am I missing?"
sailing,3cybzm,pseud0nym,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:03:34 2015 UTC,"This is why you try your best to not get weather helm. Read the article again, I think you are missing some key points and it's confusing you"

What I am reading sounds like ""do the basics and use good seamanship"" rather than a technique. Again, it is the bearing away that I am not getting. If you are going below close hauled, you are losing ground even if you are going slightly faster. Above it, you are taking power out of the rig and going slower."

Here's a good video explaining it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AAlymBNRTQ  By bearing off into bow down mode, you go faster. So much faster, that the fact that you aren't pointing as close to the mark doesn't matter; you're moving faster towards the mark that you would be on a close hauled course."

sailing,3crf9j,waypointli,2,Fri Jul 10 04:16:03 2015 UTC,"Thanks for posting this blog. It is an exciting read! I'd love to ask some questions if I may.  If you had encountered pirates on your journey you'd probably blogged about it. How did you decide which routes were safe to travel? Were there other dangerous situations?  How did you prepare for the journey? When did you buy your boat and sell your van/house/other stuff? Did you even sell it or did you keep it or rent it out?   How and when did you tell your children? How did they react? Are they going to attend a ""normal"" school in a few years?  From reading your blog I assume you are a developer. How was working on a boat possible, particularly without restricted internet?"
sailing,3crf9j,Bonig,2,Fri Jul 10 17:12:33 2015 UTC,"Fortunately, we did not encounter pirates until now. There were some scary situations though. Before the Moroccan coast are a lot of fishing boats without AIS and they have a special technique of fishing. They shut down all lights and suddenly switch them all on. So it was frightening at night when suddenly 100-200 feet from us lights went on like on a Christmas tree. The Venezuelan coast is known for piracy, so we always kept about 80 nautical miles off coast.  Preparation for the journey started about 7 years before, but only mentally. We started reading books, sailing as much as we could with the limited time available. However, the real preparations started 6 months before we left on Christmas 2013. We finally decided to do it. We bought the boat in July 2013 without money and paid it off on a monthly basis. I did not work on the boat before February 2014. I did some ‘brain wash’ on the children already some time before. Looking at images and movies with sailing boats. We took  Adam (the older one) already sailing at the age of 3 months for the first time. When we decided to go, we told the kids. They liked it. We want them to attend normal school for the interaction with other kids not for the school as learning institution. They learn so much on the boat. No school can catch up on that. But interaction with other kids is rare. I am an entrepreneur, but yes, I do some developing. Internet is an issue. Sometimes it is to get crazy. Internet works except when you most urgently need it. Or it works but not for Skype (Martinique). Or it just does not work. On the Atlantic I was coding and learned that debugging without Internet was even better than with. One has to start thinking and not just searching for a solution. I never got so much done than during my night watches on the Atlantic."

sailing,3csi7t,sinisterpurple,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:59:32 2015 UTC,That seems kind uf unnecessarily complicated.  Why install another diesel motor when you could just take power from the main engine?

sailing,3csi7t,DR0TH,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:15:00 2015 UTC,i agree.. but it depends on the type of fasteners used to clamp the hoses to the thru hull fittings.. using something stronger than worm drive hose clamps.  but also something that won't cut the hose when pressure builds and it expands.

sailing,3cpb93,yellowfin35,4,Thu Jul 9 19:09:16 2015 UTC,What type of sewing machine do you need strong enough to go through sail material    These are done on an industrial machine but you'll be surprised what a home machine can do.  Years ago I made some corsets for costume pieces on a home singer (she and I both sew).  Those were multiple layers of heavy duck with muslin lining.  One of the biggest issues is getting the material to feed through.  Sail material is so slick a home machine just doesn't grip it well.  I think the best starter machine for most people is an LSZ1 from sailrite.  They are pricey but can handle basically anything you'd need on a boat canvaswise.  Labor is about half the cost of canvas work so if someone's quoting you 2 grand or more for canvas it'll pay for itself.

sailing,3crbgl,Qwertyth,2,Fri Jul 10 09:56:10 2015 UTC,"I found a Laser II on craigslist for a pretty good deal with no trailer though. It came from a yacht club that was downsizing their fleet or upgrading or whatever. I like the Laser II a lot, but it's a little difficult to run single-handed.  That boat you have linked is super clean. If you think you'll enjoy it, I'd say pull the trigger."
sailing,3crbgl,DrGeorgeTompson,3,Fri Jul 10 18:14:45 2015 UTC,"Difficult to run single handed but not impossible. Story time:  My brother and I were taking sailing lessons at a yacht club near my grandparents cabin. The last few days the weather was crap for sailing. No wind at all. Dead calm. So our instructor says, ""race in the next weekends regatta for dingy's and if you do well, I'll pass you.""   So we agreed to his terms and next week came to play. It was a hot day and the wind was perfect. The wind was nice and steady and just about the speed where white caps start to form but not quite. We met our instructor at the dock and picked out our boat. He told us that my brother and I had to compete in at least two races each taking the roll of captain. Sounds good, so off we go.   I took the rudder the first races and my brother took the next. At the end of the second race my brother looked at me and asked, ""aren't we going back to the dock?"" Stupid question I thought, the races came one after the other so as soon as the one we were in finished they would start the next. ""I don't think there's time; why?""   He looked at me and grimaced, ""cause I really need to take a whiz."" At this point we were about 500m from the dock. I can see the last boat has rounded the last buoy and is heading for home. ""We won't make it."" I say to him. He's not pleased. ""Just go over the side."" I suggest ""no one can see us."" He thinks about that for a moment but it's a moment too long, a motorboat slow wakes it behind us and waves at us two boys not knowing the predicament one of us is in. ""Could you turtle the boat?"" He asks. I think a moment and remember we are still being evaluated; turtling the boat so my brother can sit in the water releasing his stream of yellow into the deep blue is counter to our goals of passing. ""You'll have to hold it.""   The warning born blasts and we start on our tack back to begin our third race. I time it perfectly and just as the horn blasts again we reach the start/finish line at a full clip and steal the wind from a few competitors at the line shooting out front. ""Fuck yeah!"" I cheer. My brother smiles, but doesn't cheer. ""Just...wait I'll figure something out."" We're tacking up wind now a few good tacks and we round the first buoy. Beam reach baby...we are fuckin' flying. My brother, isn't happy though. ""Fuck...just...uhhh...go into the auto bailer"" I say to him. He winces in embarrassment. ""People will see!"" He groans. ""Nah...just make it look like you're fixing something there."" I shuffle my butt up towards the bow and he wriggles to the stern.   He's kneeling now facing our competitors behind us. Thank god for our lead. He pops the auto bailer and starts to go. He's taking a long fucking time though, I have to jibe back soon or I'm going to get caught in shore breezes. ""Uhh bro you almost done?"" No answer, ""I've got to jibe...now"". No answer. ""Ok....just...make sure you're out of my way."" No answer but I know he's listening but concentrating on not tipping over as he pees into our boat. ""Jibing"" I call out. I crank the rudder and it hits him in the ass but he doesn't move as there is still a trickle coming out. I grab both the jIb sheets and main sheets in one hand and flick them out of there clears simultaneously. Quickly I swing over to the other side as the boat slowly turns down wind. ""Duck"" I yell and my brother does it just in time as the boom swings violently over his head. I reef in the jib in two long tugs and do the same to the main. The sails catch air and we are flying again. My brother looks back at me ""pheewwww"" and we laugh.   We ended up getting second place on that race. The extra tack cost us in the end but I have a hilarious story that I can bring up.   TL:DR I sailed a laser Ii single handed in a race while my brother pissed into the auto bailer."

(boat lengths)   The leeward boat that you are overlaping does not give you room, what do you do?   Depends on the size of the boat and how deep the owners pockets are.   Are you supposed to cut behind the guy screwing yourself or are you allowed to forgo the mark?   Yes cut behind, and no you are never allowed to miss the mark."
sailing,3cr3v4,FlickrPaul,6,Fri Jul 10 03:33:40 2015 UTC,Depends on the size of the boat and how deep the owners pockets are.   Rule 14 applies.  You do not play bumper boats. Just protest the guy and ask for redress.
sailing,3cr3v4,Hellvis,0,Fri Jul 10 12:57:55 2015 UTC,"You can't ask for redress unless your boat breaks. You just go around the other boat then protest him, and take whatever place you get"
sailing,3cr3v4,SkiMonkey98,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:32:53 2015 UTC,"No, that's just one situation in which you can ask for redress, and probably the most common one."
sailing,3cr3v4,Hellvis,2,Sun Jul 12 03:42:02 2015 UTC,"Overlap happens when the first boat enters the zone (three boat lengths from the mark) so if you established overlap ""right before the mark"" you didn't have any rights there. Assuming you had established overlap before the zone and were the inside boat you are still bound by several rules and the two you really need to worry about are 14 (no contact) and 28 (rounding all the marks). If you force the issue and contact does occur it gets a little messy. Other boat was infringing but if you had an out at any point (or the mark wasn't also an obstruction meaning you could escape to the wrong side circle back around) you can also be infringing. Best bet would be to go behind the give way boat and flag them for rule 18.   Also there is nothing in the rules about calling for room, you either have it or you don't. Generally it's good to communicate but definitely not required."
sailing,3cr3v4,code08,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:49:10 2015 UTC,Thanks so if your best bet is to just to go behind them what happens if there are several (lets say 4) boats all overlaping. Youre the innermost but the guy next to you wont give you the right to round. They obviously fouled but what if that move screws you so that you are now behind the two boats you where ahead of that didnt foul.
sailing,3cr3v4,code08,2,Fri Jul 10 15:08:26 2015 UTC,"In extreme cases I believe you can protest this and ask for redress after the race but I don't think I've seen that happen ever. Even if you back off a little to let the immediately outside boat go in front of you (avoiding contact) all the other outside boats still have the responsibility to give you enough room to make a seaman like rounding. Remember that rule 18 activates when the first boat enters the zone and if you gain/lose overlap after that point it doesn't change who is in the give way position.   The only times this happens to me in real world situations are one of the two situations: the give way boat can't give way because of further out overlapping boats not giving way or the overlap was questionable with disagreement on when/if it happened.   If there is significant overlap I'll push the issue but in a big group like that you have to be aware that you are putting your boat at risk of a collision. I doubt you would ever be found at fault for anything if some bumping happened but just be aware.  If my overlap is slight and I see there is going to be a huge group at the mark I'll go with caution and slow up so that I can have a smooth, fast rounding. You'll be coming off of the mark faster than all the others (sometimes even passing the boat that infringed you) with the option to tack away from the mess that is probably still ongoing at the mark.   The only times I've lost multiple places due to mark room infringements in a big group was when I was already towards the outside of a group which I probably should have avoided in the first place."

My GPS said we were coming in to the channel but the depth sounder was reading low and getting lower. It was my first indication that something was wrong - turns out that the GPS was giving me an incorrect position and I was headed directly for the breakwater. If I hadn't had the depth sounder I could have ended up on the rocks. As it happened, though, I was able to slow down and find my way back to safe water."

sailing,3cqhv2,braksandwich,2,Fri Jul 10 04:01:14 2015 UTC,"Agree with all comments below.  Additionally:  1. Depth sounder is separate from outside signals. If GPS signal is lost (unlikely I know) then you still have local instrumentation. Allowing for fixes on paper charts (I assume you carry these too). 2. Common navigation tool for limited visibility sailing. Allows you to follow contours on charts.  3. When sailing in tidal areas, helpful to know where the deep water is to get in or out of the tide.  4. Probably most importantly F-27 is a fast boat, hitting the bottom at top speed because your GPS was miss representing where you were could still smash your board."

Much more up to date than the Govt charts  in shallow water  Much of the Bahamas is a thin layer of d sand over coral rock. If you are anywhere near running aground,  slow down or raise the centerboard.  There is very little tide in the Bahamas, so depths on hard bottom are remarkably accurate.  Good to have when a front blows in and your protected anchorage becomes a lee shore at night. (Out islands mostly)  Cheap and easy to install, especially on a trailerable."

""by the time it would tell me the water is too shallow, I'll already be on top of it"" - well, if you're sailing around with your boards up all the time and you draw a foot, maybe. But it's more important NOT because it's telling you the water is too shallow in your immediate position, but as a data point for accuracy of your charts (they say X, does your depth sounder say X or Y? is your chart a half mile OFF possibly? the depth sounder can give you a clue)."

sailing,3cmkda,DeKiller,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:41:03 2015 UTC,The issue was communicated prior to the race. As I was on bow at that time i was trying my best to make sure everything worked in best order on the bow. I had tried several things to get that pin moving. The pole and mechanism itself was old and fucked and I was trying my best to keep it moving.

sailing,3cmkda,CupLB,4,Fri Jul 10 11:26:27 2015 UTC,"I learned foredeck hands-on from day one as a teen on a competitive boat, and I had more than my share of screw ups as I was learning the way. I wouldn't give it up despite that you're gonna take all the shit if something goes wrong.  My best story is my skipper was trying to train me to fall back and pull on the jib line on tacks to accelerate the trimming time when the sail had to come in.  I couldn't get it right for his sake, and I ended up having him up front trying to show me. I flubbed it again to his estimate. Annoyed,  he decided to take matters into his own hands, and I ended up with a 200 pound man pressing down on top of me grabbing the sail - and if that wasn't bad enough, I got pushed up the boat enough that the winch handle was perfectly in line with banging into my head a few times as the trimmer was instinctively trying to get past my big head in the way. Took a few knocks to realize I had to put my head down so it could pass while the Trimmer, the skipper's daughter, looked apologetically down at me.  Good times."

I learned to sail 16 years ago, was given this boat by a local hoarder (seriously) shortly after and sailed the crap out of it for 4 years. Then life happened and got in the way. When we put it way in 2005, we didn't know it would be such a long time before taking her back out. Surprisingly, the boat is in pretty damn good shape. The hulls were dirty, but solid. The tramp was mossy, but whole. The sails were actually kept indoors and are in the same shape they were left in. All of the stainless parts, blocks, travellers, etc are in great shape. The only real damage was the lines.  (begin non-copy/paste)  After replacing the lines with a kit from saltydog marine, we realized the rudders wouldn't lock down.  Luckily, we put the boat in about 20 minutes down the road from Megrews - the 2nd oldest hobie dealer in the USA!  We stopped by, got some awesome help from the folks who work there, and got the cam replacement kit.  After we replaced the cams (serious PITA) we were good to launch.  And launch we did!

sailing,3clgur,aussydog,5,Wed Jul 8 20:51:16 2015 UTC,"Not a Bluewater sailor but I do have some opinions and what is the internet for if not for random strangers opinions.  Most of this is first hand or based on long conversations with bluewater sailors.  1)  Literally a son of a son of a sailor.  Grew up sailing and racing with big plans of moving aboard and cruising.  Life intervened, got married and had kids.  Still heavily involved in sailing though.  Active racer, professional rigger.    2) I'm a strong advocate of the small boat.  35' or under.  I think most people overboat.  Expenses go up exponentially as boat size goes up.  You have the initial purchase, maintenance, insurance, slippage, etc.  Budget horror stories almost always feature a larger boat.  There are many many smaller boats that are very capable offshore boats.  Do your research and find one that fits you and is comfortable for you and don't get hung up on size.  IF budget is a big concern and IF you are only comfortable on a larger boat then maybe this isn't for you.  3)  Monohull.  Safer and in my mind more comfortable.  Easier to find slips, easier to anchor, etc.  4)  I don't believe in financing ever (anything - I am almost 40 and even run my own business and have never had a credit card or car payment).  That said, I've been party to other people doing it.  It's considered a luxury item and therefore harder than a car (necessity) or house (investment).  It will have to be insured and older boats (most boats on the market) can be hard to insure.  Dealing with a broker can be a big help.  7) Drugs until they get their sea legs.  Once your body adapts you'll be ok.  8)  It's a truism in boating that it's long periods of sheer boredom punctuated by short periods if sheer terror.  That said, most people I have talked to describe just falling in to a routine after a certain point and then the days blend together.  In otherwords, there is probably a bigger psychological hurdle going from one day out to three days out than from one week out to two weeks out.  All I can help with."
sailing,3clgur,texasrigger,2,Wed Jul 8 22:56:18 2015 UTC,This actual helps. I appreciate your opinions.   Do you feel that a <35' monohull would be capable of a transatlantic or transpacific navigation? Or does it really depend on the boat?

At the time they were doing it the average bluewater boat - the REAL bluewater guys - was 32'."
sailing,3clgur,Baranyk,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:37:46 2015 UTC,"That's very interesting. 32ft huh? I suppose it's in keeping with the up-sizing of everything else. The average home where I live has gone from 1100 sf to 2200 sf in just the last 25 yrs. Myself, however, I've got a little 800 sf home that will be paid off in only 3 more years. My taxes are tiny, my heating/cooling/electrical costs are tiny, and it's generally just a better way to live. in my opinion    I could totally see how there would be a corollary with sailboats. I was watching a video last night where a guy in Vancouver BC was explaining what it's like for him to be a live aboard on his sailboat. One of the things he talked about is how he was worried about how much space he would have, and how after a few months his mindset changed from the space feeling tiny, to feeling comfy/cozy.   here's the part I'm talking about"
sailing,3clgur,strolls,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:03:14 2015 UTC,"If you consult 10 sailors, on any matter you will get at least 11 opinions.  So before asking questions, the best thing to do is read this subreddit (and related blogs, articles and subjects) for a year, by which time you'll have developed opinions of your own.  I'm not saying that you should never ask questions here, but if you read this subreddit for 6 or 12 months, googling things you don't understand and asking when appropriate ""could you explain that, please"", then a lot of your questions will never arise."
sailing,3clgur,strolls,2,Thu Jul 9 12:16:23 2015 UTC,"I understand what you're saying. I've found that in general opinions provide a launch point for discourse. There's nothing wrong with that.

Since your response was mostly just a criticism and not particularly helpful to me as such, could I politely ask you for at least a blog or book recommendation then?"
sailing,3clgur,strolls,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:47:52 2015 UTC,"In addition to what he said, get out on the water. Depending where you are, there are any number of clubs that rent or charter keelboats. Go check them out. Hang out, maybe take some classes (less for the paperwork, more for the networking!). You'll rapidly find your likes and dislikes."
sailing,3clgur,coleinthetube,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:53:36 2015 UTC,"I've been looking into classes. A long time ago I took the Whitesail I to III courses with my brother. So long ago that I believe they no longer even call it that. lol The instruction I got then has stuck with me. (I find excuses to tie bowline knots whenever I can lol).   Locally they have these courses pegged at around $600 per person for a basic cruising course. (both classroom instruction and 3 days on the water included in that price). I'd like to know if this price is what's ""normal"" but unfortunately there is no competition, so it wouldn't really matter if it was or not.   As far as I can tell; until I get some sort of competency requirement a bareboat charter a isn't even an option.   I've been toying with the idea of purchasing a smaller cruiser locally and taking it out for weekends for a season or two. There is a very large lake 1hr from where I live and checking kijiji I have already been able to find a number of boats for very reasonable prices. Hmmm...maybe this is exactly the way to go. I could get my feet wet (pardon the obvious pun) and see how the s/o handles it."

(both classroom instruction and 3 days on the water included in that price). I'd like to know if this price is what's ""normal""    That sounds reasonable to me.  It looks like RYA certificate courses are about £100 per day here.  When tallships.org do last minute discounts (maybe 2 weeks in advance) on their Challengers, I think they charge about £75 a day, and I know of another nonprofit who charges £50.  Obviously these prices vary, depending on factors.  The standard advice on here is ""walk the docks, offer to be railmeat; be reliable and available for races and you'll get loads of offers"", and I think training courses are seen as expensive or a rip off because your buddy can ""teach you the same thing"" for nothing.  IMO that doesn't take into account the costs of running a business, insuring a boat and bringing it up to code, and it doesn't account for the fact that a professional qualified instructor should be able to teach you much better than your buddy - teaching is a skill, and it does make a difference to how quickly and how well you learn."

I looked into what they charge for membership, storage, and slip fees at the yacht club they teach out of and now I'd say the price is actually quite reasonable. This might be just what I need. It gets me in the water. It gets me educated. And it gets me to be able and try my hand at a larger sailboat (larger than a dingy that is lol) before making any long term life changing plans."

sailing,3clgur,Im_Cynical,2,Thu Jul 9 13:52:20 2015 UTC,There is a very fine line between criticism and feedback. Perhaps I misinterpreted your intentions.  So is there no blog or book you would recommend? Someone else has already recommended Crusing in Seraffyn which looks to be a great resource. Another commenter linked me to [Bluewaterboats.org](www.bluewaterboats.org) which also seems like a great source of information. Do you have something you could add to this?
sailing,3clgur,Guygan,3,Thu Jul 9 14:21:19 2015 UTC,"All the blogs and books I would recommend are the ones that I learned of by doing as I )suggested already.   Lest you think this a hostile response, I quite enjoy the Mollymawk blog and there's some excellent technical articles on MorgansCloud (evade the paywall by googling the first paragraph, then you'll be able to read it when you visit the page from google).  You should be reading huge amounts, analysing it and deciding for yourself what's crap.  I don't particularly like bluewaterboats.org. It describes itself as ""a project to build an encyclopaedia"", but it appears to be just one bloke's opinions. You may see disagreement with those opinions in the comments, but the comments are a mess - you have to wade through  ""I just got one of these and am moored in Galveston"" and ""I have one of these and it's for sale (2 years ago)"" before you get to ""she sails better than described above and has a decent PHRF"".  More importantly, bluewaterboats.org promotes a particular archetype of ""the ideal cruiser"" - not  necessarily a bad one, but Relapse (more) and La Vagabonde show it's possible to take quite a different approach.  Many of the models listed on bluewaterboats.org had production runs of a few dozen (50 - 200) hulls over the course of decades, so do not come up for sale often - I believe it's best to decide the two or three primary features that define the boat you need, and then remain flexible about everything else."
sailing,3clgur,texasrigger,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:49:38 2015 UTC,"Awesome. Bookmarking. =)  Thanks for the great info. I do very much appreciate it.   I have read ""some"" but in all honesty I've spent perhaps a little too much time just reading/watching lifestyle type blogs like La Vagabonde vlogs and s/v Delos vlogs. They're both great for showing what cruising has to offer, but they offer little in way of actual information. (Obviously the vlogs are more for entertainment than for education.)  I do sincerely appreciate the links and I apologize for being snippy after interpreting a perceived attack."

sailing,3civ6w,bplipschitz,6,Wed Jul 8 18:30:31 2015 UTC,"This stuff always makes me think of my dad's traffic school story - back when you had to go into a classroom with an actual instructor.  His instructor analyzed accidents as a series of individual causation factors, such as    tuning the radio talking on the phone distracted by scenery arguing with a passenger another driver making a mistake etc   None of these on their own would normally cause an accident, but when multiple are allowed to occur simultaneously the likelihood of an fatal accident skyrockets.   Applied to sailing (not specifically this video), the list becomes something like:    being the only experienced skipper on the boat not wearing a life jacket / harness improper equipment maintenance drinking / under the influence exhaustion adverse conditions hitting your head etc   So the issue I take with this propaganda is that simply wearing a life jacket won't magically solve your problems - but being aware of all the factors at play and actively minimizing them is how to truly be safest at sea.  tl:dr - it's an advertisement for high end life jacket / harness equipment, not a PSA"

sailing,3chxzc,hvyhitter,3,Wed Jul 8 13:11:52 2015 UTC,"Yup, hugely worthwhile.  Especially the anchor light, if you haven't done that one yet.  I actually built a LifePO4 pack for the dink, from scratch.  I packed it all into a Minn Kota trolling battery case.  The pack runs about 12.8V under 60A of load until it reaches 10%, and voltage drops off quickly.  It's 100AH, yet weighs only 31lbs.  I installed a HouseBMS on it to protect it from overcharge/undercharge (500A contactor) and installed a little volt/time/ammeter right on the case.  I also put a nice 350A anderson connector on the side and have one on my portable inverter and the ship's house bank so I can link it into the ship's chargers (or use for an extra emergency 100AH), or bring along a little 2kW 120V power station.  All in all it cost me about $1,000 to build, plus $350 for the trolling motor.  On my heavy 12' gull dinghy I can easily make hull speed (4 knots) and it settles in around 38A, so a theoretical range of about 8-10 miles at top speed.

sailing,3cgg69,Canadasjg,2,Tue Jul 7 18:43:47 2015 UTC,Looking to speak with interested students or inidivudals that have done a year of sailing for high school or university. Did you like it? what were the benefits? Are you thinking about going?
sailing,3cgg69,astron-12,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:44:46 2015 UTC,"Last fall I spent a semester with SEA (www.sea.edu). It was amazing! Far and above the most valuable and enjoyable few months of my life during which I completed the most rigorous academic curriculum I've ever faced, learned practical seamanship, and grew closer to my 20 classmates and 15 crewmembers than I would have thought possible.    My program began with a one month shore component during which we got most of the classroom stuff out of the way: classes in Maritime history, oceanography, leadership, seamanship, and marine policy. After that we had a week to join the ship in Barcelona.  We sailed from Barcelona to Mallorca, had several days in that port, then to Cadiz for another port stop, then to Madeira, and finished in the Canaries.  Our Ship was SSV Corwith Cramer, a 134 ft steel brigantine, and we students were the body of her crew.  Watches were comprised of seven students, a professional deck hand, and a scientist and stood either 8 or ten hours a day sailing the ship and collecting oceanographic data.  My only complaint is that our ~2000nm journey wasn't nearly long enough.  tl;dr  I did it, in University, I loved it and would absolutely recommend it.  The benefits were twelve hours of credit toward my Environmental Policy major at my home university in addition to the obvious benefits of bluewater sailing. I'm thinking about going again as soon as I get the chance."

sailing,3cgg69,Shannog,2,Wed Jul 8 13:17:30 2015 UTC,"My 5 Questions: How long did you attend high school on board and with how many people? What was your overall experience like? Would you recommend this experience to others? Why or why not? What were the amenities on board? How did you feel about the staff and fellow students?    I actually did class afloat this year from September to the end of May aboard the three masted topsail schooner Gulden Leeuw. There were 52 students on board, 8 faculty, and 9 professional maritime crew including the cook and cooks mate and the engineer.  We did two hours of day watch and two hours of night watch each and rotated watch times about every three weeks. On top of watch we did up to five hours of classes each day. In between class and watch we had idle time and were free to do whatever we wanted (mostly spent napping due to lack of sleep) unless we were needed on deck for whatever reason.  My experience was wonderful, going into it I hadn't sailed a single day in my life and I ended up developing a great passion for the sea and sailing and it is now a sport that I have decided to pursue. A friend that I made on the boat and I are actually going to be competing in some off shore races throughout the year.  At first it was incredibly overwhelming learning how to sail, living with 70 strangers, and doing schoolwork all while being forced to stay up for two hours in the middle of the night each, but you get into the routine and eventually thrive. I was also really scared that the maritime crew was going to be super mean and military like, especially since I went into it having no idea what I was doing, but they ended up being some of my greatest friends on the ship. There it's more of a family atmosphere on the gulden leeuw and we had a lot of fun blasting music on deck having dance parties and talent shows and male beauty pageants, there's really nothing traditional about the ship at all.  Going into it I was expecting to enjoy the traveling aspect of it more than anything, but I actually loved being at sea more than being on land, don't get me wrong, we went to some incredible places, but there really is nothing like being on the water and seeing nothing for miles and miles with nothing but the sound of the wind and the squeaking of the blocks. We sailed in the English channel, the Mediterranean, crossed the Atlantic twice, the Caribbean, and the Baltic sea.  Class afloat was one of the most meaningful experiences of my life and I look back on it as something that changed me in a very profound way and I could not be more happy with my decision to do this for my first year of university.  As for the amenities on board, the sleeping situation was kind of crazy. We had a big compartment below deck filled with triple decker bunk beds. One room, 52 teenagers with a ""wall of death"" separating the boys and girls. Attached to this room was two heads and four showers and the galley. Everyday we got three meals and a snack between lunch and dinner, and every Sunday we got dessert :)    The student crew was very close even though we were separated into smaller close friend groups. There were times where the relationship between us and the faculty was pretty shaky due to all of the strict rules and the fact that they have to enforce. But by the end we were fairly United. The maritime crew was really close with the students and treated us very well as long as we weren't lazy and actuality helped out with maintenance and sailing maneuvers (my favorite). As for the other students, they were great for the most part. A few lazy kids who only wanted to travel and had no interest in sailing whatsoever were pretty frustrating, but other than that I made A lot of really close friends that I'll probably have for the rest of my life.   I would not recommend this program to everyone, it's very hard work and at times can be incredibly grueling but it's an amazing experience that I wish more adventurous people had the opportunity to participate in.   If you have any questions let me know. I can also send you some pictures if your interested! (Sorry if there's typos, I typed this whole thing on my phone)"

I work at a youth sailing camp, and we have three Hunter 140 daysailers, one of which has a roller-furling jib.  It's incredibly convenient for our purposes as the mast stays up all summer, and the attachment system consists of a simple, sturdy pin and split ring at the base of the furling spool that makes stepping no more difficult than the other 140 masts.  The only hurdle for us is explaining to the kids how the roller furling jib differs from the other boats' jibs and how to operate it."

sailing,3cht3b,mbetter,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:29:05 2015 UTC,"Marlinspike helps with tight knots and can open or tighten a shackle with a hole in the knob.

Other uses: chipping ice, spearing food, shotgunning beers.  Edit: spike needs to be locking on a folder, otherwise it's beyond useless."

One thing I really loved about that boat was the fact that I could throw it on a trailer one day, take it off the next, sail on the ocean or in a lake and run the bow right up onto a beach to hop off and go exploring. People say what they will about the MacGregor 26 is it is true that they don't sail as well as some other boats but honestly I think they are much more versatile than anything I have come across.  When I was selling it,  one of the interested buyers was getting a boat to do the great loop in ."

sailing,3cdq1p,enuct,2,Tue Jul 7 07:15:17 2015 UTC,"15K for a Mac26 just seems like insanity to me. I don't wanna bag too much on these boats because if people sail them and enjoy them that's great. I own a Mac25 that I'm parting out, and a Catalina 25 I sail and cruise on regularly. Despite the shorter LWL the C25 has twice the cruising comfort of any Mac IMO, with a marine head, real plumbing, two sinks, and better sleeping accommodations.   I think you just haven't looked at enough boats yet, or you're overthinking the motorsailor thing - any 27' or under sailboat mast can be stepped down, and you can put a 15HP outboard on anything, the Macs just tend to come with largish outboards. There are lots of other swing keel options out there, too - O'Day, Catalina, Hunter, to name three that are far better built."
sailing,3cdq1p,reyomnwahs,2,Tue Jul 7 23:23:35 2015 UTC,"The Macgregor 26 has another thing going for it, critical to doing the Great Loop: the mast is deck-stepped, and can be lowered by a single person in about 20 minutes.  There are all kinds of rivers and canals with air draft restrictions, and unstepping a keel-stepped mast can be a nightmare.  I did a solo ""circumnavigation"" of Lake Ontario aboard a 26X a couple years ago, from Montreal to Hamilton and back, over the course of a month.  It was awesome.  Haters gotta hate.  Here's what I just posted in the other thread:  I owned a 26X for a few years, and have fond memories of it. I put about 2000 miles under her centerboard.   It's simple. There isn't much to break, but it's comfortable enough to spend a week aboard (or even a month, as I did a couple years ago). It's trailerable. You can take it to places that keel boats can't access. Then you can tell your keelboat owning friends what a beautiful lake you were on last weekend. It's fast when it needs to be. You can't outrun storms, but you can make it in before dark. It's ""strong enough."" Seriously. I've been out in 10' seas, 40 knots of wind. You need to use common sense, and be an experienced helmsman, but it's not as delicate as people make it out to be. It's great in close quarters, as you can vector powerful thrust thanks to its steerable, massive outboard. It's easy to winterize. It's easy to step and unstep the mast, allowing you to explore rivers and canals keel-stepped boats are a pain to get through.   I now own a much bigger, much more capable vessel. But I do miss my old 26X, and how quickly I could get her out on the lake for an afternoon/evening sail.  One thing I would caution: nothing ruins a trip like a marginal or failing autopilot.  Plan on spending at least $2-3k on the steering system and a good, solid helm pilot with spare parts.  A gas generator or lots of solar is also important, as the outboard alternators are useless for keeping the house batteries charged."

sailing,3cdaeq,Imagine25,4,Tue Jul 7 01:25:22 2015 UTC,The side of the trailer that is closest to the camera actually has framework that extends vertically so that the cat doesn't sit flat. It was strange to me when I first saw it but after some research found out they are called tilt trailers and are made that way because of trailer width regulations in most states. Its actually unnecessary in Montana where Im at but the trailer was originally from California where I guess it was needed.

sailing,3ce27n,fsm_follower,5,Tue Jul 7 04:42:49 2015 UTC,"The Dashews' boats always have washers, driers and fridges, and I believe they're liberal with their use of hot water.  One of the Amazon reviews for their Offshore Cruising Encyclopaedia describe it as ""everything you probably can't afford in a cruising yacht"".   TBH, I think this is a reflection on how loaded the Dashews are, more than it disproves the Pardeys' philosophy.  I think you can temper the Pardeys' advice - I think going engineless and shitting in a bucket are unnecessarily extreme - but the principles are basically sound.  The Gamble estate sale on Bruce Roberts' brokerage page is a heartbreaking testament to ""go now"", and I regularly find other examples which validate my Pardey-like sentiments."

I would agree that the lack of head seems like a bit much.  I envision myself having one, but knowing that if it fails I would resort to a bucket until I reached a decent port rather than call off a part of my trip until I could bring in a specialist (not to mention I could always learn how to repair the damn thing too!).  Could you clarify what you meant about the Gamble estate sale on that page?  Are you talking about the boat that is partially complete who's contact has the last name Gamble?  Also any of those examples that validate their sentiment that you can share?"

A working head may have been somewhat expensive in the 70's, but you can now pick up a Jabsco manual head on Amazon for $160... so I don't think it's worth skipping this type of ""luxury"" any longer. The same goes for outboards.

Here's another example - he wasted the last of his active years building and now he's probably too infirm to enjoy the voyages he dreamed of. He's luckier than Gamble, who died before finishing his boat.  I suspect that dreaming and tinkering is the primary pleasure for some of these self-builders, but if they wanted to actually sail then they'd have been better off buying a secondhand 30' or 35'er and just getting on with it.  There are a few boats on the market at the moment which appear very well-cared for at remarkably low prices.

sailing,3ce27n,kriotas,3,Tue Jul 7 23:05:52 2015 UTC,"There's a reason 99.9999999% of cruising sailboats have engines.  If you talk to cruisers long enough you'll start meeting some who've met the Pardeys while cruising.  Many will tell you that they've watched them being towed in and out of anchorages by other boats.  A decent engine isn't a requirement, but it's a huge convenience and can increase your safety margin and your comfort.  12V refrigeration costs about $1k, a used outboard about $1k and a decent head about $200 including plumbing.    At this point, I think they're just trying to make a point.  A more balanced book is Beth Leonard's Voyager's Handbook.  It's amazing and very complete."
sailing,3ce27n,strolls,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:15:40 2015 UTC,"I will take a look at that book, thanks for the recommendation!  Having the motor for entering harbors ect. seems immensely useful, all of the docking I do with keelboats is under power.  I certainly would want to avoid a set up where I needed to run a motor for some amount of time per-day just to keep the batteries full to operate other equipment.  Though solar and wind together could help with this."
sailing,3ce27n,191h4h8rhfGU8r73f3jF,2,Tue Jul 7 18:26:00 2015 UTC,"Having an engine and enjoying its benefits don't make you dependent upon it.  You shouldn't be idling the engine to charge your batteries, as diesels like to be run under a decent load.  Having said that, the power consumption of modern devices has fallen, as solar panels have become more efficient, so you shouldn't need to run the engine for this often.  I recently read a comment by someone in the med - he gets up in the morning to find his batteries low but the solar starting to put out a trickle, by midday the batteries are full and the fridge is humming. I think his solar installation is medium sided."

sailing,3ce27n,reyomnwahs,3,Tue Jul 7 21:47:10 2015 UTC,"I think the answer is somewhere in the middle. Definitely there are far too many people who rely on $20K worth of instruments in a $50K catamaran and end up wrecked or hailing the Coast Guard at the first sign of trouble. Here's one example off the top of my head.   On the other hand, I don't think you need to shit in a bucket and live without electricity. Refrigeration and A/C are probably luxuries that may be more trouble than they're worth, though.   The fact that so many people were inspired to go cruising because of the Pardeys is a testament to either their marketing acumen or their message, I'm not sure which, but I think many might not be there without them. On the other hand, they and Fatty Goodlander are probably to blame for so many dudes in pareos, and that shit is just out of hand. Some credit for the whole small and simple philosophy should go to the Hiscocks, too, though.   Personally, my favorite regular people budget cruising book, by far (and I've read several books by the Pardeys) is Voyaging on a Small Income. Also be sure to check out James Baldwin's Across Islands and Oceans. He inspired me a lot more than the Pardeys did, personally.   BTW, check out /r/sailingbooks. This post would have been great over there, and it needs more content.   On motorlessness, I'm striking a balance there by running a tiny electric motor and a solar panel. It's enough to get me in and out of the marina - one little secret the Pardeys and others seem to downplay is that there are TONS of places you just can't sail or scull into, and half the time engineless sailors end up having to beg for tows in strange harbors."

Not to mention getting out of congested waterways under nothing but sail in anything like a reasonably sized liveaboard would seem to be overly difficult without an engine.    What is surprising to me is that we are still using them to drive the powertrain of the boat! Seems that the new batteries from Tesla for home power plus a generator and a small electric motor (which, in reverse, can generate power as well) would be an ideal solution for boats. They have been doing it on icebreakers for ages as an example."
sailing,3ce27n,reyomnwahs,2,Tue Jul 7 19:40:12 2015 UTC,http://oceanvolt.com/ they generate power to recharge the batteries when under sail by using the motion of the propeller spinning in the water (bad for speed but good for the environment)

sailing,3ce27n,reyomnwahs,2,Tue Jul 7 21:03:36 2015 UTC,It's fantastic but stupid expensive when compared to solar panels or wind.
sailing,3ce27n,kriotas,0,Tue Jul 7 22:42:14 2015 UTC,You aren't going to really get much power from the area you can put solar on most boats (and solar should be part of the equation to prevent the generator from running so often) and the best way to generate from wind would be to generate power from the prop running backwards as the boat moves forward through the water.  There isn't just enough place to put up a windmill on a boat.    You are going to be running the engine anyhow to charge the batteries for your electronics and refrigeration as well as to make hot water (or any water through an RO system). There is no need to propel the boat at those times so there isn't really need for a 150HP engine to drive a prop at the same time. So you have to look at the expense for the same effectiveness. You would be saving on fuel costs as you would only need to generate the power you are using rather than having a big engine running up to temp just to warm up water for a shower.
sailing,3ce27n,pseud0nym,3,Tue Jul 7 23:40:51 2015 UTC,"Whoa. How many amp hours do you think you need? A lot of people get by with around 200 a/h or so, and 200 watts or so of solar. Wind, I'm with you, it's actually fairly inefficient and the price per watt is 1.5x that of solar. In my case, I have 400 a/h, one 100 watt panel, and low enough usage that it's been fine. No genny, no (gas) motor.  Again, the prop method is a great idea. It's just wicked expensive in practical terms so far, just as Torqeedo is another great concept with terrible pricing and atrocious execution."
sailing,3ce27n,kriotas,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:04:19 2015 UTC,It is totally common for cruisers to get enough power from solar that they never need to run their engine other than for propulsion.  Is there a sailboat with a 150 hp engine?  Maybe some megayacht. Most have 30-50 hp.  No point in more.
sailing,3ce27n,pseud0nym,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:17:46 2015 UTC,"Is there a sailboat with a 150 hp engine?    When I think ""liveaboard blue water boat"" generally I am thinking in the 55-75' LOA range. 100HP to 150HP are pretty common on the boats I have been looking at. Not saying you can't do it smaller. Regardless, running an engine that is designed for driving the boat for auxiliary reasons is more than a bit of over-kill at any size.    As for solar. If you can get your power from that, even better! The generator is there for when that doesn't happen for some reason. The batteries can store power from solar just fine as well! The more power you can draw from alternative sources, the better off you are. The other advantage of driving the boat using an electric motor on generated energy is that you aren't going to twist your prop shaft or mess up your engine if the prop get tangled and they are far simpler and easier to maintain. Plus they can be used to generate power from the wind, rather than just keeping you up all night cranking away doing nothing (assuming you don't have a folding prop)."

sailing,3cd5tc,jeffrife,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:56:04 2015 UTC,Id like to see a pick of this boat..   if it is a snark.. dont paint it.   If you are near cleveland or toledo I am wondering if you have my old boat.
sailing,3cd5tc,hvyhitter,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:07:59 2015 UTC,It is a snark sunflower.  It has a new sail that is red.
sailing,3cd5tc,hvyhitter,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:27:05 2015 UTC,"I knew it.. the ""styrofoam coffin"" as people I took out in it used to call it. I loved that boat. 20bucks is a steal. It didnt come painted or with a plastic hull that is how they were made. It will teach you precisely how to sail. I not pilot my own 30 foot cruiser 20 years later and it came back to me like a duck in water.   buy it.. dont paint it. Consider it a displacement hull and dont worry about the speed.   also when you tip. I tipped a lot enter through the back. You wont be able to get on the side. If you ever lose the centerboard pin just use or make a wooden doorstopper thing.   also the pin for the rudder.. 10 penny nail works just as nice with no slop.   Yea.. buy it. When you cultivate your love of sailing you will buy something else and then you will already know how to sail it. Definitely must buy. Dont worry people talk about boats that are 100 grand boats and dont like them. You will never get away from the talking.   I see a 35 year old on a snark I am going to probably talk him up and see what is going on with them."

Too much tapping of the camera against my hat, etc.  I had to normalize the audio in SoundForge in order to get the volume up to -6dB so my talking could be heard.  But I do want some sort of audio from sailing, since music only seems like it is missing one of the elements of sailing.  Was your audio not usable? or did you just eliminate it for simplicity?"
sailing,3cclca,KnifeAndPlate,4,Mon Jul 6 21:27:31 2015 UTC,The mast doesn't only bend backwards at the top but also forward in the middle. This stretches the center of the sail horizontally thus flattening it.
sailing,3cclca,dancewalking,4,Tue Jul 7 03:27:11 2015 UTC,See diagram.
sailing,3cclca,tkaraszewski,2,Tue Jul 7 01:45:55 2015 UTC,"So, my only knowledge of this is for fractionally rigged boats - I have no idea how the rig of a masthead boat behaves with regard to bend.  On a fractionally rigged boat, you have to consider the forestay. When you pull on the down on the vang, you pull (through the leech of the sail) on the mast at the head of the sail. This pulls the top part of the mast back, but because the forestay is attached much lower, it acts as a pivot, and the lower part of the rig bows forward. This stretches the sail fore-to-aft, helping to flatten it and move the draft forward.  On my boat as well as many others, the backstay is adjustable, so the rig can really be bent back and the main flattened as a result."
sailing,3cclca,synalx,3,Tue Jul 7 00:06:26 2015 UTC,"Good response. It isn't really possible to bend the mast with a masthead rig (which explains why most new boats are fractional). You can induce mast rake, but that isn't the same as bend. The vang still works to flatten the sail, take twist out of the leech and depower, but not as well as on a fractional rig."
sailing,3cclca,hockj,2,Tue Jul 7 04:12:01 2015 UTC,"With a masthead rig, you will use other controls to induce/reduce mast bend. The biggest for me is babystay, as it pulls directly on the centre of the mast forward. You can also use runners/checkstays to tune the draft while going upwind, but they MUST be left off while running, as you may invert the mast."
sailing,3cclca,SkiBigLines,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:49:02 2015 UTC,"Yes, the baby stay acts like a fractional forestay if you happen to have one. For example, I only have a masthead forestay, single in-line upper shrouds, single lowers, and an adjustable back stay. Tensioning the backstay only induces rig tension on a boat with such a layout (mast rake is set by the forestay). My boat is not rigged for performance racing."
sailing,3cclca,hockj,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:52:46 2015 UTC,Kicker certainly does bend the mast and is completely normal!
sailing,3cclca,FlickrPaul,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:54:43 2015 UTC,"It is bending the mast, but it is doing via the leech of the sail so the most it will bend will the at max leech tension. (ie flat)"

You'll find that everywhere besides the U.S. uses it as the standard.  A basic navigation course like day skipper at the least will help with chartering.

Learn navigation like a boss. What if your gps dies?   If you're looking for a list:  At least day skipper with practical. Yachtmaster coastal or offshore are good to shoot for.  Be able to pick up a MOB  Nav lights and Colregs  How to read weather forecasts and plan accordingly.   When to reef etc.   Anchoring, mooring, passage planning.   Radio protocol  Boat handling is a given  Most (of the theory at least) can be picked up fairly quickly through day skipper. I know Sunsail and Warners used to use that as their minimum to charter bareboat. Show them your logbook, they may take that as experience. You may still need to do a quick checkout passage with one of their skippers before the let you loose.   I might have some RYA books on a hard drive I can send your way if interested.

Your rigging is a breeze, the sails last forever (and are easy to make yourself), keep working even when ripped (lashing battens together), and prevent you from ever having to carry storm sails or ghosts.

I really like the javelin model because of how open the cockpit is, and because it only draws 3 inches.   The bigger boats with a cabin are nice, and with small kids I may want them for my kids, but when my dad would take me and my cousin when we were around 5, he used spf50, and that was in SC and we just ate watermellon and loved how fast it was.    fast foreward a couple years pops gets a 25mcgregor with a cabin. This boat got be back into sailing because when I hit about 13 all I could think about was wake boarding. The 25ft is cool because you can have a major party while riding, but sailing is just not as good.   I would get a boat with a retractable centerboard. and if the winds get too strong, drop a sail. we paddle our 16ft oday about a half mile (with wind assist) to launch and have done it just about everyother day this summer.   my dad got this book back in the long ago, so there is probably a new version, but I have been reading it a lot lately because I am getting ready to get a live aboard while I finish my degree this fall.   ""Surveying Small Craft""  [third edition] Ian Nicolson  --this book has saved me from 4 bad boats, and has got me a 2/7ths price reduction on my hopeful.   TL;DR figure out which model of boat you want. I reccomend the oday javelin (out of 15+ experience), then get the book, then use Search tempest to search for this boat, then contact them with good questions, and dont be afraid to travel to get a better boat. It is very much a buyers market, everyone always has OBO. remember that.  if you want one of those, get the owner to take you on a test sail."

We went into west marine and we met 3 nice couples there. I did it because I wanted to plant a seed in my wifes head about sailing.   Well she was like. ""Those people were so nice"" and then I started looking at cruisers. Started doing some reading.   and well having a nest egg of cash didnt hurt either.   Flash forward to March.

""We should up our budget by 3 (It was at 8000 first)   Went out and picked the most expensive boat we saw but the one that picked us.

I am getting ready to go down to the boat to organize my tools and shoot part 2 of my ""Double Spring line"" movie I promised this place months ago.   I go upstairs to tell the wife I am going to the boat. I didnt think to ask her. I see her up in the bathroom doing her hair and makeup.   ""What are you doing?""   ""I was getting ready so that we could go to the boat? Do you want to go to the boat?""  So.. funny how far we have come.. We have a dock, we have a boat we CANNOT trailer without permits (it is too big) and we are joining a Yacht Club next year.   I figured I would tell you MY story how I went from buying a small trailerable boat to getting a boat that I did.   JUST in case you were similar to me.   However check my other post.   That highlander is amazing. I love that boat and the community around it.   One thing for sure.. Price and quality are DIRECTLY proportional. There are really ""No good deals"" from what I saw.   I think you would be fine buying an off brand boat too. The parts on it are all readily available. Winches, pulleys, blocks, lines you can buy all that stuff and fiberglass is fiberglass.   If you buy a name brand one or a popular boat (Like a highlander) there will be a ton of guys who know your boat and know the nuances of the boat."
sailing,3c9lw5,hvyhitter,2,Tue Jul 7 11:25:18 2015 UTC,"Here's an example of one that's a bit more expensive:  For Sail: Highlander 20'  This looks very well equipped, lots of pictures and the seller seems very knowledgeable.  It looks like it's really more of a racing boat though, it has very large sails and I'd worry we might be biting off more than we can chew; or at the very least buying it would be keeping it out of the hands of someone who would use it to its full potential.  The rigging seems a lot more complex.  I don't even know what those cranks are for at the base of the mast (are those for the halyards?)"
sailing,3c9lw5,J109,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:06:22 2015 UTC,ok.. I race highlanders so I know these boats. I was going to suggest a highlander and that is why I asked what is your budget. This boat would fit PRECISELY what you are looking for. The highlander is an amazing boat. It really gets up and goes. It is very stable and a very capable rig. I also happen to know a lot of guys that own them too and they ALL know how to tweak them.   SO funny you got to a highlander. If you would like I could put you in contact with a guy that is an expert   highlanders are the bomb.. That one is a VERY nice example too.   I am from Highlander Fleet 14 out of Edgewater Yacht Club in Cleveland.
sailing,3c9lw5,decknoises,2,Tue Jul 7 11:15:24 2015 UTC,"We're seeing the Highlander Thursday.  The owner has three and is or was president of the area's Highlander club.  He got this one in iffy condition and spent the last year fixing it up, replacing core and re-rigging it.  He also customized the trailer with a longer tongue and a support for the mast.  He seems pretty passionate about the boats and I'm guessing his asking price is less than he's put into it.  It seems like this could be the boat for us, but I'm definitely going to go through everything with a fine tooth comb."

Finding a good deal on a used catamaran trailer could be a long wait, and a new trailer is worth more than the boat.  The boat itself seems fine, though.  A Hobie 16 was my first sailboat.  Start out when the winds are light, and you pretty much can't fuck it up."

sailing,3c7uoe,Sld109,2,Sun Jul 5 19:04:51 2015 UTC,"If you can find a light boat trailer with a narrow wheelbase (the wheels have to fit between the hulls, not outside) you can convert it into a cat trailer. Get two 2""x2""x8' galvanized square steel tubes, large square U bolts and the roller things. All those are a few bucks at a trailer shop, but not an insane amount.  Or, call the local hobie shop and see if you can pick up a trailer. In Texas a decent trailer is $600 to $1000, sadly.  So it's not really an insane world-beating price. It's ok, if the boat is solid, the mast is good (no dents, and bonus points if no comptip), the tramp is good, the hulls are hard, and the sails are good. If it fails any of those it's not a good deal.  A H16 is a great first boat, so go talk to the guy, see if you can talk him down some, and find out what happened to the trailer. Call the local sailing ship, look on Craigslist, see if you can dig something up. Good luck!"
sailing,3c7uoe,K_S_ON,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:13:33 2015 UTC,Can you tell me why a comptip is a bad thing? I'm not sure the info I found on it explains that. Just curious.
sailing,3c7uoe,K_S_ON,2,Mon Jul 6 03:35:16 2015 UTC,"It was a liability cover Coleman put in place when they owned Hobie (a comptip will explode and not kill you if you raise the mast into a powerline like a dumbass). It's not a huge deal, but a comptip is heavier, flexes more, and is less strong so you can't reef the sail, if you ever want to, the top slug will pop out. So it actually makes the boat less safe. Most H16 sailors never do reef, but I used to take mine out in lots of wind reefed, it was a great boat in 25 knots with the jib and reefed main up.  Anyway, a comptip mast is measurably worse for sailing and is worth less. I'd avoid it if I could. I don't know if they're still required to race in a H16 fleet, I guess that would be one reason to have one."

But to me, that argument could be applied to most cars people buy - they are not good racing cars, nor good for hauling lumber, so why buy them?   Most people don't buy their cars for either racing or hauling lumber. They buy them to drive to work and pick up groceries and take their kids to school.  People buy sailboats, presumably, because they like to go sailing.   So yeah, people buy cars that are bad race cars because they are good at taking kids to school. People who want to go sailing buy boats that will be good at sailing.  Buy whatever you want, but the M26 is a horrible sailboat. If you just want a floating camper, buy a powerboat, it's a million times easier to trailer and it has more interior space. Why bother stepping and unstepping a mast every time you want to put a boat in the water if you don't care if the boat can sail?"

sailing,3c72jd,texasrigger,4,Sun Jul 5 15:25:11 2015 UTC,"By modern standards sailing ability=windward performance.  The mac has the following:  Tons of windage (surface area catching wind not actually doing work) thanks to the high freeboard required for standing headroom.  Ineffecient, low aspect rig.  The mac has a short mast relative to size.  Thats to make it more trailerable but it's also dictated by it's very small and primitive rigging which was made to be cheap and easy to step.  Ineffecient hull shape thanks to non-existant keel also necessitated by easy trailering and motoring.  Add those up and you have terrible windward performance.  Nobody notices off the wind performance other than being slow.  That's why gaffers have a modern reputation for being bad sailing despite being a much better rig for off the wind than a modern bermuda rig.  Edit: formatting and typographical errors.

sailing,3c72jd,texasrigger,3,Sun Jul 5 18:17:57 2015 UTC,"can point to its specific flaws   Bad rigging, cheap construction, problem prone rotary steering system, problem prone rudders.  Difficult to walk around on (going forward of the cockpit), high freeboard makes it awkward to/at dock.  Binnacle is cheap and not very stable.  Zero feedback on steering.  Over-motored (yes I know that's the point) increases cost and maintenance.  Those are apart from it's qualities as a sailboat which I discussed elsewhere.  Source:  I have worked on a half dozen or so over the years.  That's a combination of my direct observations and conversations with the owners."
sailing,3c72jd,somegridplayer,4,Sun Jul 5 18:30:16 2015 UTC,"Slow, can't point, terrible sa/d, relies on water ballast causing awful righting moment for starters. Its neither a good sailboat, nor is it a good powerboat either.   What are your goals? Why not a sailing dinghy (dyer or the like) and a nice powerboat, or a nice sailboat and a whaler or the like?  Compromise makes boats suck."
sailing,3c72jd,tkaraszewski,2,Sun Jul 5 15:54:42 2015 UTC,"it can sail   You can stand in a canoe holding up a beach towel and you can sail. That doesn't make it a particularly good sailboat.  Try and find any similar-length sailboat with a worse reputation than a MacGregor 26. I don't think you can.   But yes, it's both slow and unsteady, among other things."
sailing,3c72jd,POTUS,3,Sun Jul 5 15:57:11 2015 UTC,"What people don't often specify in their MacGregor hate is the water ballast.  The later MacGregors (post 1996 I think) are all water ballasted.  This is a water tank in the bottom of the boat, below the water line, that is filled with a few hundred pounds of water.  This is an effective ballast so the boat is a capable sailor.  But it's not a comfortable sail, because water ballasted boats start to heel very easily before the water ballast has any weight to it.  So, basically, the boat leans over more than a more traditional keel boat.  In addition to that, a MacGregor is about half the displacement of most any other boat of a similar length.  This means that every wave will toss the boat around twice as much as most any other boat of a similar length.  Both of these are a big advantage for a trailer.  You don't even need a full size pickup to pull a Mac 25, you can pull it with a mid size SUV or pickup, basically anything with a towing package.  But everything is a compromise.  Getting a Catalina 250 on/off a trailer is a huge pain in the ass and you'll probably need a crane.  Getting a Mac 26 on/off the trailer is something you can do all by yourself in about 20 minutes.  The Catalina is by far the superior sailboat, in a different league than any Macgregor.  But pulling it out of the water more than once a year isn't practical.  Bottom line:  If your budget and lifestyle require an inexpensive trailer-sailor, a MacGregor is the right choice.  You will absolutely be able to sail in it well enough, once your family gets used to the idea that leaning is not the same as dying."

And I am, truthfully, less than enthused about the MacGregor now.  But I appreciated the detail that he provided, explaining why to a novice like myself - in searching for opinions, most people (not yourself) seemed to formulate them without ever sailing the boat, and were based on walking by the boat at the dock.  Honestly, I see the MacGregor like a sailing equivalent of an RV - a shitty thing to drive, and likely easy to criticize as 'not like real camping with a tent and a canoe in the backcountry' - but they serve their purpose for a small family who wants to get out of the city and enjoy nature, but not prepared, or wanting, to have the ultimate camping (or sailing) experience.    But I wanted to know exactly how much I have to compromise to get there - if the MacGregor does not sail as well as a Catalina - I can live with that.  But if it wobbles from side to side, flopping about whenever there is a +15 kt wind - that sounds like a deal breaker, and an uncomfortable way to spend a weekend.

I put about 2000 miles under her centerboard.   It's simple.  There isn't much to break, but it's comfortable enough to spend a week aboard (or even a month, as I did a couple years ago). It's trailerable.  You can take it to places that keel boats can't access.  Then you can tell your keelboat owning friends what a beautiful lake you were on last weekend. It's fast when it needs to be.  You can't outrun storms, but you can make it in before dark. It's ""strong enough.""  Seriously.  I've been out in 10' seas, 40 knots of wind.  You need to use common sense, and be an experienced helmsman, but it's not as delicate as people make it out to be. It's great in close quarters, as you can vector powerful thrust thanks to its steerable, massive outboard. It's easy to winterize. It's easy to step and unstep the mast, allowing you to explore rivers and canals keel-stepped boats are a pain to get through.   I now own a much bigger, much more capable vessel.

sailing,3c5wlu,Guygan,1 point,Sun Jul 5 03:27:05 2015 UTC,"Is there a limit then on the sheet width for a particular block, or are all sheets around 7-8mm, and therefore work in most blocks?"
sailing,3c5wlu,Guygan,1 point,Sun Jul 5 04:20:06 2015 UTC,The specs on a given block will say what size lines they accomodate.
sailing,3c5wlu,thatirishguy,2,Sun Jul 5 11:20:16 2015 UTC,"1) I would check out some of the big sailing shops and look for a One Design section for Sunfish. It will be mostly racing stuff, but lots also stock ""recreational"" cheap parts that aren't race legal. You should get the right idea for measurements, i.e. look up a sunfish line kit and see what line size and lengths they use.     2) I recently bought stuff for my Laser on www.apsltd.com and thought they were pretty good, large inventory. There are probably better deals online if you are in the know, but boat stuff can be tricky to find deals on.    3) I would do the opposite approach of what you're thinking, and get padded sailing shorts. They make all kinds out there since boats like ours or just sitting a rail is hard on the rear. I decided to get Zhik Deckbeaters. Not cheap, but they are fantastic and can be worn under other shorts depending on the situation."
sailing,3c5wlu,texasrigger,2,Sun Jul 5 04:07:43 2015 UTC,"Most if these have been already answered but here goes some general info:  Sunfish sheets are 8mm I'm sure.  Little known fact:  rigging is so steeped in tradition that most stuff (including European made boats) is still imperial based.  It is only very recently that metric has started to creep in but even then it's frequently limited to descriptions only.  So in the case of a sunfish it's probably 1/4"" (6mm) for halyard and 5/16"" (8mm) for the sheet.  Blocks (pulley is a landlubber term) are measured by sheave diameter.  I think 57mm is fine for up to 3/8"" line (going by memory, check the specs) but ratchets run one size smaller typically because of the sheave profile.  2:  The only time a special anything is made for a boat it's because there isn't an existing thing on the market that'll do the job.  That drives up production cost.  Because of that, all boats use off the shelf products wherever possible.  So, no if it looks like a normal block on the spars then it is a normal block.  That said, I was remembering sunfish halyards being run through a cast plastic cap on the mast with no block aloft.  It has been years though...  3:  Dinghy shorts is what you are looking for.  Extra:  If you take the tail of your halyard from the cleat, wrap it around and over the gooseneck, and then back to the cleat you are creating a rudimentary vang that works wonders for those boats."
sailing,3c5wlu,texasrigger,1 point,Sun Jul 5 13:35:50 2015 UTC,"Thank you, that all helps quite a bit.  After reading about the halyard/vang trick, that may be some of why I was having so much trouble running.  On your reply to 2, yes it is run through a plastic cap at the top, and on mine it is an absolute bitch, especially since where I am I have to wait until i'm in the water to raise the sail.  Would there be anything wrong with tying a block up there to run the halyard through instead?  Thanks again."

sailing,3c2xk3,doublemazaa,7,Sat Jul 4 07:13:39 2015 UTC,As someone who is new to sailing can someone explain this p?  To me it looks like they parked too close to shore during high tide and as the tide went out the keel hit the bottom and the boat turned on its side.
sailing,3c2xk3,jradasaurus,16,Sat Jul 4 12:20:13 2015 UTC,"Hey,  To be fair you're part right.   The two boats anchored off for the night went to sleep and the wind swung around as the tide dropped. They found themselves aground then thier engines couldn't get them free and cut out. The tide was still dropping and they ended up like this.   This could've been avoided with a little foresight and good planning. For example: checking tide times and wind forecasts and Anchoring a more suitable distance from the shore.   If you're interested in how we got them free I'll write that out below!   I started work at 830 this morning and was informed by my boss to go check it out and find out what they were happy for us to do as far as helping out.   We looked, had a joke, discussed and decided to leave it for the tide to come in.  So at 1300 we went up with two motor boats. The tide had risen and the larger boat (which has a smaller draft (the Red and white one in the picture if it's not clear what I mean) ) was able to get it self off on it's own motor. The smaller (which had a greater draft) was still grounded too much to get off on its own.  So we had my motor boat attached to the yachts main halyard and the other motor boat pull from the front! The boat easily came loose then I had the joy of raising the anchor. All I'm sweltering heat that I'm still not use to!!   P.s. Sorry if there are any format or grammar errors, I'm on mobile also if this isn't as clear as I'm hoping it is, mobile is to blame as well."

sailing,3c2xk3,FlickrPaul,2,Sat Jul 4 19:19:47 2015 UTC,"I've seen it done before where the boat actually ran aground and there wasn't a lot of room (they were in a marina). So along with the motor boat pulling on the halyard they had 6 people sat on the boom, with the boom at a right angle to the boat (like you'd have it if you were on a run).   Yeah that was pretty funny to take pics of. I'll try and find them but we're talking a few years ago, several changes of phone and lots of new pictures since then.

T'would be a chuckle trying to explain how your boat got halfway up another boats mast. :D   In many cases it is heavier, but because the top of the mast is further away from the center, the boat pulling has a massive advantage, thus it could never happen.  Though what can happen, is if the bottom goes from shallow to deep really quick, the sail boat will accelerate as she rights herself and you can have collisions if you are not far enough away, which is why you add to the length with a spin sheet or two, so you have a better angle and keep the boats a safe distance apart."

sailing,3c2xk3,Badgerisbest,2,Sat Jul 4 16:25:06 2015 UTC,"No big deal.  Other than the fact they were rafted and the contact between the two boats caused some damage, the fact they were grounded by tide means nothing.  Most people don't realize, traditionally we didn't have boat lifts.  Most of the time a lift is not readily available.  All boats need to be able to withstand this position for maintenance when the boat is unable to make it to a boatyard.  If they did this separately, they could have lied and said they were doing maintenance on the cheap and wouldn't have broken the second rule of sailing:  Look good doing it."

Also, heeling on two wheels doesn't seem like a very good idea to me, so I'd probably have to start the project by shelling out for a trike. It's all too much for me at the moment.   The only reason this is happening is because it seemed like a somewhat useful half-measure. The ""low-hanging fruit"", if you will.  Any thoughts on how to squeeze a little extra performance out of this admittedly crude design?"
sailing,3c1vnt,K_S_ON,2,Sat Jul 4 12:50:54 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry if I sounded like a dick, I was typing fast before I went to bed.   A small fore and aft sail further forward will work better. The heeling won't bother you, I bet. In fact, your current rig, with no way to dump the sheet, is far more dangerous. What if you have a big tailwind and you need to stop? I don't think furling it up will work with any pressure on the sail.   I would certainly start small, and I'd use cheap as hell components until I knew what I was doing. Very light tarp material or shower curtain or light nylon, something like that, and double sided carpet tape and cheap grommets from the hardware store and bamboo and big zip ties. For ideas on cheap sailing rigs, this page is ancient but excellent:  http://www.thecheappages.com/  You can see in this:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J36Sr9lXS_w&spfreload=10  that even with a crappy taped up sail made of plastic he can sail with the wind well ahead of the beam. That's a huge advance over a square sail. I don't think I'd put the sail behind me, but I haven't done this so I can't swear to it not being a good idea. It appears to be based on this:  http://www.vsv.cape.com/~harharb/windbike.html  You can see in this:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdfE4-hjrWA  that even though that's a pretty big sail in pretty good wind and the center of effort is very high up, he's not having any trouble with too much heeling force. I think you're fine there.  If it was me I'd make a tiny junk rig out of polytarp and bamboo and put it in front of me, high enough that I could duck under it, attached to the stem of the bike in some way that doesn't bork the steering, then work my way up as I understood it.  Anyway, good luck! And report back, I'd love to see how it works out."

In this particular bay there are two lines of mooring buoys, so about every 4th or fifth boat is on a buoy and the boats in between have their anchors out. To keep them in a nice line each boat is also tied on with a stern line to the boat across from it, then winched nice and tight. The opposing forces of the anchors/mooring buoys and stern lines make for a nice stable raft. We also make a circle raft which is much less stable and dependent on weather, generally only for an afternoon to let guests swim and have a good time. Let me know if you have anymore questions!"

You can see a number of lines out in the photo, either to anchors or mooring buoys."
sailing,3bzklr,mgrave22,3,Fri Jul 3 14:42:00 2015 UTC,Difficult to say from this picture but I would say that the catamarans on the left and the upper line of yachts have their anchors out. The yachts on the lower line are attached via rope to trees or rocks.   To form or leave this formation would require a fair bit of organisation and communication. What probably happened is that the lower raft was formed by sending out dinghies with lines and then the upper raft was formed by anchoring and then tying up to the opposite raft.   If you're in the lower raft you're kind of stuck unless you're at the end. The upper raft should have a fair bit more freedom to leave.

It can be done by one person.  However, they have a roller that mounts to the binnacle and I've seen damage to the binnacle from prying against it.  They have a rotary motor boat steering system.  It offers zero feedback and is terrible for sailboats and the cheap pot metal is prone to problems but it's fairly cheap to replace.

It's very common on all trailer boats really.
sailing,3c0gqt,texasrigger,1 point,Sat Jul 4 00:32:38 2015 UTC,Acceptable lake boat.  Not really suitable for salt water.  More or less a powerboat with a mast.

sailing,3bzpuu,mctaggert,1 point,Fri Jul 3 13:40:06 2015 UTC,"You should replace it.  It's not too hard to do, as long as there's decent access to it. Get a replacement cap. Drill a hole in the old cap and put a screw in it and use that to pry the cap out. Clean up the hole, put sealant on the new cap and tap it in. There's tool to do it, but a wooden dowel about the size of the inside of the cap works too.  If you just need a temporary fix, I'd clean it up and patch it with a piece of metal and high temp epoxy, like J-B Weld or something similar from the car parts store."

My dad grew up on the water as his dad was a Navy Frogman (predecessor to the SEALs) and was an experienced seaman.  My dad was about 13 he says, so about 1964, and they were coming in at night towards South River in a pretty nasty storm.  All at once it intensifies, the boat takes on water, and it goes under (I can't remember what they were sailing at the time) with my dad, his brother, and my grandfather dumped overboard about 2 miles off of Thomas Point Lighthouse.  My dad says he can remember seeing nothing but the lighthouse and the swells being pretty intense as they swam (and were pulled by my grandfather) to the lighthouse, but with my grandfather being such a strong swimmer and so well trained in such situations, he got them to the shoal safely where they rested and waited for help.  When my dad tells the story he says he didn't feel very scared even as a boy because he understood the intensity of some of the missions and training his father had been through.    What a great memory for my dad to have of his father, and one of his last; my grandfather was killed working as an operator for the cia in africa later that year.  RIP."

In the UK we are very lucky that anyone can own and sail a boat without qualification, and it only takes a few people getting in to trouble for not taking the time to properly being taught how to sail for the rest of us to lose that privilege.  However, if this is your learning to sail plan, then I suggest you reconsider. If the boat is in the Solent already, stay there. It is a much better place to try to sail than the Thames estuary, and there is plenty to explore. For a beginner you learn thick and fast, and you are in safer water than if you start exploring the coast."

There have been many, many occasions when these powers mods didn't give a fuck what their subscribers wanted, and determined to run their subreddits their way instead.  It's ok for these power mods to be dicks to other people - it's only when it's done unto them that ""working with the community"" is important.  If you don't like being a mod, then don't do it. This is the power mods posturing about how important they are.   Frankly Reddit should have just announced a new rule that subs must be publicly accessible to be eligible to be amongst the defaults.  Reddit should have added a couple of new defaults, removed a couple of the closeted ones, and announced that they won't be rushing to implement the new rule too hurriedly, but they will continue to do so over the next few weeks."

But difficult. Expect to flip. Lots. Don't bring electronics and wear a bathing suit.   You can also consider a very small sailboat like 18 - 22 ft if you have a place to put it. It's more like other larger sailboats, whereas dighys and sunfish are kind of a mix between like sailing a windsurfing board.

Here's how... You check your local sailing mag for race days in your area (Here in SF we have Latitude 38, brilliant rag...). Dress in layers and go down to your Marina/Yacht Club with a cardboard sign that reads, ""RAILMEAT FOR HIRE"" or ""WILL SAIL FOR FOOD""... seriously, I mean this... This is literally how I got into the sport and I've had a blast ever since... See, these guys that get the big boats NEED people to run them. It's a challenge racing a 40ftr. single handed! Even if you're a Noob we always need weight on the rail, makes the boat go faster! Be honest with your Skipper about how much experience you have in sailing and he'll put you in the right spot on board. My first few times out I was the Beer Man / Rail Meat... still had the time of my life. As a beginner you need to listen to all the more experienced sailors on board, don't be afraid to ask stupid questions, learn to tie a bowline and above all... DON'T FALL OFF THE BOAT! Also try to have a thick skin as some Skippers can be rather loud when giving orders. Don't take it personal, it is what it is... If you find yourself getting seasick do not be afraid or embarrassed to hurl, we've ALL done it and you usually feel tons better afterward. I cannot stress the importance of a PFD. That would probably be the most costly part of your gear for right now (a good one is around $120 - $150) but it is a MUST HAVE and you need to get in the habit of wearing it ALL THE TIME. Sea water is really cold and wet clothes are really heavy, not good for your health at all. I've got more tips but not enough time for now... Best of luck to you!!"

The Hadron (1065) is slightly faster than a laser (1088) - at least, on average over the races that count towards the yardstick.   I also do not know how a planing hull vs a displacement hull would affect these formulas.   I think you can only use them to compare like-with-like. It might tell you that a planing hull is faster than a displacement hull of the same length, but it's not going to tell you whether a 49'er can beat a J-class yacht because it's too dependent on the course and conditions.

sailing,3bxsez,enuct,2,Fri Jul 3 01:40:15 2015 UTC,Just find one that has more BTU's than you need and fits your space requirements. The reason you want a stronger unit is they aren't designed to blow the exhaust up and out a hatch the way we'd use them on a boat.

I attached a small board under the rear side of the ac so that it would sit level resting on a forward facing hatch just aft of my mast. (30 ft sailboat). I had to make up sort of a 14"" wide, elephant trunk shaped downward pointing funnel out of 1/4 inch builders stiff styrofoam. It points/goes down into the boat a few inches below the cabin ceiling. The styrofoam was shaped by cutting long slits then curved and held together with duct tape. The AC was fairly useless until I did that because otherwise the cold air just collected in the open hatch area in front of the AC.  To make it easier to handle, I cut out a couple of the air conditioner side ""vents/ribs"", so I could gear a good grip on both sides near the top of the AC. I also need to wrap a bit of tarp around it tightly to keep out Mosquitos. It isn't the prettiest thing, but it WILL freeze you out of the boat.

On battery, it would be killer.  The powerbank has enough storage to run the AC for 10 hours.  It is also cheaper and a hell of alot lighter then using Deep cycle batteries.

AC are alot less expensive and need much less crazy wiring.  That and on a 30 foot boat, I would think you would have an AC circuit run already so no need to over complicate the electrics.  I am interested for the powerbank because of how it is surprisingly inexpensive compared to the deep cycle marine batteries in an equivalent bank.  I would much prefer 500 lbs of batteries vs a ton.  Powerbank is AC to my knowledge and already has gear for running battery chargers and connecting solar, diesel generators, wind, tow behind, shore power, and all the other stuff sailboats use for juice.  Unless he only uses the airconditioner at dock, then ignore me as you could get away with one of those portable ones you can get for 500 bucks with all the fancy hepa and such and avoid all the expensive marine stuff.  TLDR: the best airconditioner in the whole world is useless if you can't run it for an hour without having to ruin your batteries."
sailing,3bxsez,gravshift,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:09:40 2015 UTC,"but you wouldn't run AC while you're out. You have hatches and windsocks. AC is to make it more comfortable at the dock, a Tesla system also doesn't seem cost efficient (especially for the weight added) and batteries don't last forever. While the weight may be ok on a 46+ft boat it wouldn't be on something under 30."

sailing,3bwaxp,reg-o-matic,2,Thu Jul 2 18:54:13 2015 UTC,"Well you are going to have to do some sailing to get from place to place! I was merely asking because you can get anywhere in the BVI's in one day's sail, but some of those would be longs days.   In your case I would recommend the following:    Depart Road Town and sail to the Bight on Norman Island (2.5 hr sail). Plenty of mooring balls available  - I really liked to be in Kelly's cove, on the outside edge of the Bight, where it is a little quieter and there are fewer boats. From there you can take your dinghy to the caves, visit the Willy T for drinks, or both. Next day, sail up to Manchioneel Bay on Cooper Island (3 hrs). You probably want to get there by 2pm to make sure you get a mooring ball, as holding can be iffy in the grass beds there. On your way out of the Bight, stop at the Indians for probably some of the best snorkeling in the islands. Cooper is also right next to Salt Island, which doesn't really have any good overnight anchorages, but you could stop there on your way to Cooper. Salt Island has the wreck of the HMS Rhone so that may be worth a stop.  Get an early start to the morning and sail up to the Baths on the Southern tip of Virgin Gorda (1.5 hrs). Get there early as it can be crowded later in the day and you might be waiting a while for a national park mooring ball. Spend about 2 hours exploring the caves and grottoes (you can see just about all of the park in that time), then sail back downwind to Peter Island (2.5 hrs). If you are confident in your anchoring ability, anchor in Little Harbour, one of my favorite anchorages in the BVIs. There's not much to do ashore there, but it is quiet and pretty. If not, pick up a mooring in Great Harbour. There is good snorkeling around the edges of the bay. You can also dinghy to shore and walk through the high-end resort to Dead Man's bay, or if you brought nice clothes, go out for a VERY expensive dinner at their restaurant.  Sail back across the Drake Channel to Road Town to return the boat (1.5 hrs)."
sailing,3bz7qu,BioGeek,5,Fri Jul 3 10:05:10 2015 UTC,"My reply to Liz:   Liz, I can understand why you’d be upset with that reply from Scuttlebutt and I think the professional side of the sport especially, does have a lot of room for improvement when it comes to gender equality.  On the other hand, I think you’re projecting and assuming quite a lot here. Firstly, what exactly do you find negative and demeaning about being ‘wet and wild’? Personally I think ‘wet and wild’ sounds very fun and positive, whether in a sexual, or non-sexual context.  Secondly, what exactly gave you the idea that the title was sexualised? From a neutral point of view, that title works in a non sexual context (I assume you’ve seen ‘wet and wild’ water slides at theme parks before), but you chose to assume the worst. Perhaps that is also why Scuttlebutt replied so brashly.   I think there are many valid battles in the sport when it comes to equality. This isn't one of them."

If you can't handle a little wordplay around a boat's name, then get out of the sport. Maybe take up militant activism instead.  I sail on an awesome boat with roughly a 50/50 gender mix - and we all love it. Despite being a fairly serious and intensely competitive program, we have each other in stitches of laughter on every leg of every race, with sexual innnuendo and ribald comments being the norm. From BOTH genders. A feminist like the writer would have cardiac arrest before the first mark, if she came out with us, and I could imagine she'd be a total ball ache to sail with for that reason.

sailing,3bro64,bricolagefantasy,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:59:58 2015 UTC,"I wonder if it can be designed to go even faster.  what is the rule of adding rear paddle/flap extension? sort of like little water sky that extend the hull lift a little.  The rudder is certainly sticking out of the hull. Can't we not say this paddle is just little weird rudder?  So, at very high speed, the boat really have longer apparent hull.  kinda like this, the rear paddle (sorry this was the closest thing i can think right now.)  http://www.space.com/5978-europe-aims-entry-spacecraft.html  I would also definitely put a little camera on the top of mast. then have little eye viewer in helmet.

But don't let that worry you, cause it's also tons of fun. You'll probably need another person to sail it with you. If you're social, you can bring along 3 or 4 other people.  This boat will be fast and fun.  If you end up sailing it a lot, sailing on monohulls will be boring. Even smaller cats will seem kind of dumpy."

Thanks for the pdf, I've been trying to figure out how I was going to step the mast and figured I'd need a couple of people for the job as it doesn't seem doable alone or without machinery. How big or expensive of a job would it be to buy and rig a jib?"
sailing,3btl1h,mctaggert,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:39:15 2015 UTC,"I'd see how much original equipment for the jib is on the boat and piece it together from there. Is there a halyard block on the mast? Any jib sheet leads on the beams?   For a jib, I'd look for a used Hobie 18 or Nacra 5.8 jib to use.  I'd also look at the set up on those boats for ideas on how to rig the jib.   Hobie 16 jib gear will also be plentiful and maybe less expensive. The H16 jib might also be big enough too."
sailing,3btl1h,Kaberu,2,Fri Jul 3 01:31:52 2015 UTC,"My only experience with a cat is briefly on a hobie 16, and racing against Hobies, Inters, and Prindles in a mixed class race (with me on a monohull). They seem really slow to tack but amazingly quick on a reach. You generally stand attached to a harness as opposed to hiking on the rail. It's a good distance to go from one side to the other compared to monohulls, especially when going from hike to hike on a tack, so be quick in heavy air. Some types seem more prone to pitchpoling if you aren't paying attention, but I don't know about a sol cat specifically.  Just be sure you have your righting line attached!"

Very low drag when the wings are in 'ground effect'.   Nope, they're not wings in that sense at all. They're only there so you can get your body weight further from the center of the boat. Easier to keep it upright.    Can it be sailed without foiling?   Of course, you have to be sailing at least 7 knots in order to even begin foiling.

Can you take a hacksaw or a grinder to the existing one, and leaving it in place get it to the point where you could drill two holes and install something like this:  http://www.apsltd.com/hardware/replacement-sheaves-sheave-boxes-exit-plates.html  edit: Failing that, do everything you can to minimize friction between the sail and the mast.  Clean everything thoroughly and lubricate with something like Mclube.    It's possible to the tube has a groove worn in it now making even more friction.  Not sure what to do about that except my idea above.    You could rig up a 3:1 at the other end of the halyard but be sure to minimize all the friction you can before that so you don't break anything."

Just the cable halyard is $100 from a different part of the site, so I'm not goign to bother trying to find out how much a whole new masthead would cost.  My plan is to use a grinder and remove the cable from the bent tube it is in now, and then to install a sheave like you referenced on the side of the mast.  I'll need some sort of sleeve / bracket to keep the cable from bouncing off the sheave accidentally.  I have a friend that has a metal lathe so I might be able to convince him to help me make one."
sailing,3brjws,Charles_W_Morgan,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:36:28 2015 UTC,"I don't think you will be happy with something on the side of the mast.  It needs to be on the centerline in order for the head of the mainsail to articulate properly.  If it's always pulling to one side it can't do that.  If you can remove the tube, can you install a sheave where it was, between the sides?  Or is the tube mounted externally.  Maybe I don't have a clear idea of how the tube is attached, but I am thinking like the picture, but with a tube instead of sheaves.   If you can get the tube out and sheaves installed, you'll have more room so won't need a custom made wire to replace the halyard.  You can use low stretch polyester rope which should be less than $1/foot."
sailing,3brjws,Charles_W_Morgan,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:04:49 2015 UTC,"Yes, that is another option, just stop using the wire rope and switch to a low stretch rope, but then I still need a sheave of some sort at the top."

The core to core splices were a little tricky since it's my first time doing that type of splice.

sailing,3bn3kr,rantifarian,2,Wed Jul 1 17:07:45 2015 UTC,Wouldn't recommend taping them together.  On the risk/reward scale you are risking a trip aloft to string a new halyard vs an extra two minutes to do it right.  Tape up the tip of the wire then take some twine and stitch through the lay of the wire and through the new halyard end to end.  Take several passes.  Then wrap a small amount of blue masking tape over the transition to keep the ends aligned.  You can pull on it all you want and you won't inadvertently pull them apart.
sailing,3bn3kr,gpforlife,2,Wed Jul 1 02:08:58 2015 UTC,"Plastic coating on lifelines is generally frowned upon, asbit hides and in some cases accelerates corrosion. Making up swaged stainless  1x19 lines is actually pretty easy, and lots of places hire out swage tools. If you go for synthetic lifelines be very careful about chafe inside the staunchions, your old lifelines have probably created burrs that will cut your new spectra to shreds.   Wire to rope was used to reduce halyard stretch  before modern synthetic ropes were readily available. You should be able to replace it with good quality dyneema with no problems, although check your masthead sheave, once again for burrs and chafe points from the old wire.   Check the size of your masthead sheave too, it may only be big enough for wire, not rope. In that case you will ha e to strip the cover off the new halyard for the same length as the wire, attach a thin mouse line like vb cord to the sail end of the halyard and pull it through, then attach your new stripped halyard end and pull it through before doing your end splices."
sailing,3bn3kr,texasrigger,2,Tue Jun 30 21:21:43 2015 UTC,"Used to be a rigger. Agree with this post.   Steel lifelines should be uncoated. If you want to replace them with steel, get a rigger to do it. Swagging sucks and if you've never done it before, you can crack the fittings, or use the wrong dies and get a bad swag. Plus, it really doesn't cost that much. When you pull the boat at the end of the season, pull the lifelines and send them to Thomas Hardware. That, or do it yourself and use synthetic line. That's pretty easy.   Definitely don't use the wire rope nonsense. That shit is the devil. You may need to replace the sheave is you use a smaller diameter line so it doesn't jump it."
sailing,3bn3kr,texasrigger,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:11:43 2015 UTC,"Replacing the sheave is probably a good idea anyway, they are cheap, and it makes life much easier when the main goes up and down without binding on a shitty old sheave.  I agree that getting someone else to do the swaging is best if you can afford it. It usually isn't too expensive either, but I know a lot of people on /r/sailing are on a pretty tight budget, and home job swaging will probably be better than coated steel."
sailing,3bn3kr,rantifarian,2,Wed Jul 1 00:20:40 2015 UTC,"If you're going to do it yourself, find a good rigger's manual on the subject. However, I'd really suggest hitting up a rigger in the offseason and at least get a quote: http://thomashardwarecompany.com/"
sailing,3bn3kr,texasrigger,3,Wed Jul 1 00:54:42 2015 UTC,"Quick quote - most lifelines I've seen work out to about a $100 or so a wire depending on if you are reusing any turnbuckles or pelican hooks.  A wire for these purposes is a stretch if cable with a fitting on each end.  The expense is in the fittings and the labor, not the cable so the length only has a negligible effect on cost.  3/16"" type 316 stainless 1x19 is only a buck a foot or so.

sailing,3bn3kr,rantifarian,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:38:58 2015 UTC,Don't confuse a true swage and a crimp.  The typical do-it-yourself fitting are the handy crimp fittings from Johnson.  They have no where near the longevity nor the tensile strength of a true swage fitting.  Real fittings require something like a hydraulic wire technik machine to do in the field.  I've never heard of anyone willing to rent something like that out as they are several thousand dollars.  Edit:  Looked up the numbers.  Handy crimp generate up to 70% of the strength of the wire on 7x7.  It will be less on 1x19 and that's IF properly applied.  Another rigger I apprenticed under years ago has a story about pulling one out in a boat by hand.
sailing,3bn3kr,texasrigger,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:01:01 2015 UTC,"Crimp is a better name for what I was trying to describe.  Given that the current lifelines are coated steel wire, they are almost certain to be crimped rather than swaged, so they will be of similar strength to the last ones, just less likely to have corroded to nothing under the plastic.  I did a few crimps that could be broken by hand when I was first learning, they were usually pretty obviously shit from a quick visual inspection. A couple of goes on some scrap wire and I had it sorted and never had any trouble, although that was only dinghy rigging.   I was looking at the breaking strength on 3/16"" wire rope and noticed a few stores selling 7x7 as lifeline material, whereas I have always used 1x19 as I hate meathooks on lifelines. Any thoughts on why they reccomend 7x7?"
sailing,3bn3kr,Quagers,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:08:46 2015 UTC,"7x7 is the standard cable on coated lifelines.  All it offers is extra flexibility which in some applications is a good thing.  The wire isn't as likely to kink and can generally accomodate gates easier.  I'm with you in that I like uncoated 1x19 better but I don't have a major issue with coated.  The additional diameter of the vinyl coated makes the lines much more comfortable to hike against.  The order of failure in most rigging is typically swage, then cable, then fitting so iffy lifelines can normally be condemned by careful inspection of the swages before any real risk of the cable letting go.  That said, I'd be awfully nervous of any lifelines older than a decade regardless of how well they hold up to inspection.  I'm a firm believer that bad lifelines are much worse than no lifelines.  There's no reason to believe the coated stuff is crimped on based on it being coated alone.  Look for tool markings on the sleeves:  No tool marks - rotary swaged (production loft stuff, frequently original)  A pair of raised ridges or sets of ridges that run the length of the sleeve - Wire teknik or Kearny type swager (smaller lofts, never production work so certainly not original)  Evenly spaced ridges perpendicular to the sleeve - johnson or hayn handy crimp fittings.  Do it yourself stuff.  If you just have a loose fitting in hand you can tell if its a handy crimp or a swage by looking at the wall thickness of the sleeve.  There's more than twice as much metal in a swage sleeve.  Sorry, got a bit longwinded there."
sailing,3bn3kr,VowOfScience,2,Wed Jul 1 04:38:05 2015 UTC,"Coated lifelines are not allowed in Aus for any boat under survey, and the OSR forbids coated as well for racing, so they really are quite unpopular here.

sailing,3bn3kr,SkiBigLines,1 point,Wed Jul 1 05:48:32 2015 UTC,Here in the US coated lifelines are still the norm with probably  80 % of the boats using them regardless of boat type or value.  Of course I can only speak anecdotally here but I personally haven't seen cable failure in coated lifelines and I inspect rigs professionally so I've looked at a ton of them.  They are also not allowed here under ORC but neither are synthetic.  Edit:  Clarification - I haven't seen cable failure at a spot other than at the swage fitting.

The wrapping pattern is designed to cause the termination to tighten as the conductors pull against each other.

The Western Union Splice is made by twisting two ends of a wire together counterclockwise 3/4 of a turn each, finger tight. Then, using needle-nose pliers, the ends are twisted at least five more turns, tightly. The cut off ends are pushed close to the center wire.  ""Short tie"" and ""long tie"" variations exist, mainly for purposes of coating the connection with solder. The longer version may aid in solder flow.

sailing,3bp2k5,thrownshadows,2,Wed Jul 1 02:01:51 2015 UTC,Sixty degrees off the wind would be to have your bow pointing 60 degrees from where the wind is coming from.  The one thing I would add is to start on port tack so that you will heave to on starboard tack; you are technically still under way so this gives you rights over port tack sailboats.
sailing,3bp2k5,IvorTheEngine,1 point,Wed Jul 1 11:32:01 2015 UTC,"Yes, that sounds right.  Each boat has a different balance point, but you should be pointing higher than a beam reach.

sailing,3bnkvb,Zaquiri,2,Tue Jun 30 19:59:33 2015 UTC,"You don't ""need"" full keels for oceanic passages, the only difference in a fin and a full keel is the fin keel will be a little more sensitive. I suppose if you ran over a whale the fin may be more susceptible to damage but honestly the fin not a deal breaker. You want to look at how much ballast the boat has and solid construction. Essentially the full keel is good for ocean work because  1. They are typically built heavier 2. They are slower/ require more wind to reach hull speed  The fin keel will be more manoeuvrable, faster and require lighter wind to reach hull speed. So in a storm you will get blown around more easily. But if you find a fin keel boat that is solidly built and on the heavy side the only real disadvantage is having to pay more attention to the helm because it can turn faster on you.

sailing,3bnkvb,hvyhitter,2,Wed Jul 1 10:54:00 2015 UTC,"a 1980s catalina for 5000 is probably going to be a mess. My first one was. (The one I got surveyed and rejected.) In MY opinion for a 1980 catalina or any 30 footer in sailing condition. Expect 12,000 as a minimum. I found almost a DIRECT relationship between price and quality of 30 foot boats made around 1980. I wouund up paying 20,000 for mine and I CANNOT be happier."
sailing,3bnkvb,jeffrife,2,Tue Jun 30 18:28:25 2015 UTC,"DIRECT relationship between price and quality of 30 foot boats made around 1980   I have noticed the same thing. What's nice is that is the listing price. As a buyer's market we always have the ability to walk to the next boat for sale that fits our needs, so we can always bargain a bit.  At the same time, I'd almost rather purchase a decent boat for $5-10k and then put another $10k into it that way I know the quality of the equipment. What changes did you make to your $20k boat after purchase or did you sail away ""as is""?"
sailing,3bnkvb,hvyhitter,2,Tue Jun 30 18:36:32 2015 UTC,"As is. 3 months later. I replaced the radio in it because the FM part died in a lightning storm. I have taken the boat out about once every 2 days ever since. Motoring and sailing.   repairs wise.. or added equipment. I havent done anything to it other than take the hailing port off and putting Cleveland, Ohio on it. (14 bucks) I like first year with a big boat and this thing has been rock solid. I had some electrical problems with the tank sensor but it was just unplugged.   That was it.   THAT is what I am talking about. I am SO glad I bought a better boat and paid more up front.  Im sailing the piss out of that boat.   I have a whole raymarine chart plotter, wind, depth and all in one thing, plus autopilot.  8000 bucks to add that. I would have NEVER put that on myself.   This boat has a fridge. (Wow is that important) I wouldnt have put that on either.  I thought I was going to add a bimini but the dodger is perfect and the traveller makes a good bimini almost impossible."

A lot of what we have found for what we want (or think we want, 28-36') is around 1985-1995 age range and we know a lot have been well-maintained but are unsure. This listing seems pretty sweet to us http://www.nortonyachts.com/boats-for-sale-deltaville-virginia/sailboats-for-sale/hunter-326-2003/ as does http://www.boattrader.com/listing/1986-Catalina-34-102486673 (actually our fav for the price/amenities).  We've pored over various articles and have talked with some more experienced people but still are undecided. Some suggestions have come in the ~25' range but I am 6'2"" and we have a kid so room to stretch out and some space for friends would be a plus.

sailing,3bnkvb,Gl3g,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:38:52 2015 UTC,I read once that the smallest sailboat you want for cruising is one that can comfortably hold a dingy on the deck. It makes sense to me. Think where you can store a dingy on the deck when you are looking at boats.
sailing,3bnkvb,rantifarian,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:16:37 2015 UTC,"I would say between 28' and 32' is a pretty good range.   Much smaller than 28 and the tradeoffs between speed, storage and tankage will get hard to balance. Above 32 the money starts going up very quickly, particularly for maintenance, and one person doesn't  need much more room unless you have too much crap onboard"
sailing,3bnkvb,rantifarian,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:37:29 2015 UTC,"Should I be looking for a ""full keel"" boat? Aside from that, what should I be checking out before pulling the trigger. I obviously want to make sure the engine runs, that the sails are in good condition, that the deck is solid, and then have a surveyor check the hull. Anything else?"
sailing,3bnkvb,rantifarian,1 point,Wed Jul 1 05:06:06 2015 UTC,"I wouldnt worry so  much about getting a full keel boat as getting a good boat. You don't want a super thin racing keel, but something like an S & S 34 style keel will give you most of the benefits of a full keel with better performance and the ability the reverse into a slip.  With the sails, they will be your primary engine. If you are going for a cheaper boat, chances are the best you will get will be half rooted sails. I would personally consider buying a cheaper boat with rags for sails and replacing them with new ones from a reputable loft. Standing rigging goes in the same category, if you are heading offshore you should really consider replacing all the stays and getting a once over by a rigger. very few cruising sailors replace their rigging as often as they should  Engines are pretty handy for getting in and out of marinas, but a lot of people get by without them. If you go without, in a smaller boat especially, it is quite a lot of weight and space that can be used for other things. I know of one bloke cruising southern south america in a 28'er that uses a sculling oar when he cant sail  Solid, dry hull and deck are important, good rudder and bearings, prop and stuffing box etc. Electronics can be added as you need them, most of them are wants rather than needs anyway."
sailing,3bnkvb,hvyhitter,2,Wed Jul 1 06:02:08 2015 UTC,Sounds good. I definitely want a strong inboard diesel. I also definitely want a VHF and Chartplotter. I can probably do without radar or AIS.  Would the keel on this Catalina 28 be acceptable for being 75-100nm offshore?
sailing,3bnkvb,rantifarian,1 point,Wed Jul 1 06:22:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, nothing wrong with that keel for however far offshore you wanted to go. Whether the rest of the boat is the best choice for you is another question. Beds running across the boat are great on one tack, on the other they can get a bit claustrophobic, and there is no nav table or decent space to mount radio, gps etc  100nm is not really that far offshore, it is just over 1 day at 4 knots. The chances of you having to weather a significant storm at sea is pretty small, unless you ignore weather forecasters."
sailing,3bnkvb,Zaquiri,1 point,Wed Jul 1 07:24:29 2015 UTC,"The concern with that rudder is that it could be sheared off.   a Skeg (something in front of the rudder to protect it from impact) is considered superior.   know that they CAN be sheared off pretty easily and not having a skeg is something that some would argue would not make that boat ""Blue Water"" capable. You will probably be fine but you should consider the ""What would I do if my rudder sheared off and have a plan"""
sailing,3bnkvb,rantifarian,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:54:11 2015 UTC,"I read bob perry stating somewhere that a lot of ior skegs were essentially held  on by the rudder, rather than the other way around as the distorted geometry made it hard to get any real strength in it. I would prefer a well designed, strong spade with a sealed area for the rudder bearings over most skeg rudders i have seen   Having a plan for losing tbw rudder is a good idea anyway"

sailing,3borcx,Goardo27,3,Tue Jun 30 22:38:16 2015 UTC,"Google lee board and lug rig.  You also need a rudder, but if you have an oar, you can lash it to the transom.  Use cheap or salvaged plywood, 2x4 po' boy lumber for the mast, rip a 2x2 out of one for a yard (or use a closet pole) and boom  and cheap yellow poly rope for lashings and rigging.  If the hull is deep enough, you may be able to sail up wind a bit without the lee board, but it will prob perform better with one.  You might also google duck punt for some rigging ideas."

sailing,3borcx,Sld109,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:52:05 2015 UTC,"If you want the boat to sail anywhere but downwind, you will need to add a keel, which pretty much sinks your idea of 'not altering the boat in any major ways'.

sailing,3borcx,mayoriguana,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:49:43 2015 UTC,All that I need is a square sail that will sit some how in the boat without being drilled into the frame. All I'm doing is going downwind for about 4km to the nearest bridge.

But today, what with the mandatory zebra mussel inspection, I believe you wouldn't be able to pull that off, since the inspector looks all over the boat while checking for potential mussel habitat.  They'll likely deny an inspection sticker to a boat that has a two stroke outboard, even if it's stowed below."

sailing,3bkc9i,kynde,6,Tue Jun 30 07:02:29 2015 UTC,"More like 12, bit faster reeching. Obviously to windward the sail plan is horribly inefficient so tacking angles are huge and she's ~150 tons all up so sub 15 knts doesn't really get going. But once she does  nothing stops her. We ran aground on the training day at full speed, boat draws 5.3m by the time we stopped we were in 3m of water. Took 4 hrs to get off, very embarrassing.   For reference we finished the race in about the same elapsed time as the leading First 40, however having to short tack out the Solent really hurt us, if we'd had more space we would have been a bit quicker."

sailing,3bkc9i,thunderofguns,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:01:41 2015 UTC,She is unbalanced and it has a negative impact on her sailing. I haven't had a chance to calculate her lead but I know it's too high with the Coe too far forward. Suggesting Eleonora is an exact replica of westward is an insult to herreshoft and  you are giving far too much credit to Ed kastelein by saying a leaky boat with a cheap interior is lavish.  If you would like I could point out a few ways Eleonora  could be made quicker. Just send me a message.
sailing,3bkc9i,Quagers,2,Tue Jun 30 20:51:08 2015 UTC,"The Rig and hull are exact replicas, so if her COE is too far forward, so was Westwards. All the extra weight, any build issues don't change the fact that the hull and rig are the same or where COE is.  I'd also questions how you know so much about the sailing characteristics of a boat which was fundamentally altered in 1937 and sunk in 1947, down to its balance and COE."
sailing,3bkc9i,thunderofguns,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:58:01 2015 UTC,"I don't have the rig plans of both boats on me, but you can see from pictures the rigs are different. Westward had a longer boom and bowsprit which is very evident when looking at photos.  You can also be very sure that westward wouldn't have become famous and been so fast if she didn't balance, it just wouldn't have been competitive. The designers from that period of yacht design where very very talented and making yachts on the very limit of what technology allowed, which is why I can have a very good guess at the characteristics of westward. I have also read first hand accounts of many yacht races in the 'big class' period and can promise you the sailors where very good, a poor handling boat wouldn't have been raced for very long without something being done.   Eleanora has her good points. You were very lucky to have sailed on board, and I am pleased you enjoy sailing on a classic. But I please don't assume Eleanora is  such a great boat. Westward would have been so far ahead of Eleanora you wouldn't have known she was racing.    I've just check westwards sail area  against Eleonora, westward was 1252 m sq whereas Eleanora  is 1115 m sq. not very exact"

sailing,3bl7bj,FlickrPaul,9,Tue Jun 30 12:15:29 2015 UTC,"Off the coast of Guatemala in October (bad time of year, we learned). 5 day passage. Wind dead during the day, but at 2pm big black walls of thunderheads stacked up on shore. At sunset the pressure drops and the wall of squalls hits the boat like a fist. 0-45 kts in 3 seconds. White-out conditions with sideways rain. Probably 4-6ft waves, stacked. The rig is vibrating fiercely. Autopilot dies, so I'm outside with lab goggles and a headlamp trying to read the compass so we don't point at the shore. The lightning starts. The nearest bolt hits the water a baseball's throw away from the boat. I'm sitting directly under the boom holding the tiller, waiting for the strike that goes down through my head. By accident I'm looking out over the water when the closest lightning strike hits. The flash and the bang are simultaneous, which is extremely startling, my eyes get overwhelmed, and my vision goes black. I'm blind, bucking, heeled over, 1/2 mile from shore, rain pelting my face like hail, just trying to keep what I hope is a straight line without broaching. After half a minute, my vision slowly returns.   And then it ended. Wind died again the next day, calm and sunny. Then 2pm rolled around, and the black wall reared up over the mountains waiting for sunset to release it on us again.  Good times."
sailing,3bl7bj,weezthejooce,7,Tue Jun 30 20:31:15 2015 UTC,"For myself it was aboard my old Macgregor 26X.  We were in a hurry and powering along at 15 knots, ballast empty.  The wind was astern for most of the day and for about an hour at the end, we were exhausted and just not paying attention.  As we cleared some protection the full force of the wind caught up with us, probably another 10-15 knots apparent (up to 30 true), and we found ourselves in quite large whitecapped seas with nothing to keep the boat upright.  We stopped and attempted to fill the ballast, but the motion of the boat made it very difficult; water would run out as the boat pitched.  I debated calling a pan-pan with our position - just in case - but a hastily invented technique of plugging the forward vent during upwards pitches seemed to be working.  After 5 or 6 tense minutes we managed to get the ballast full and make for an anchorage for the night.  A small craft advisory had been sent out during the day, but we didn't hear it over the engine noise.  Still, our lack of situational awareness put us in quite some danger and I think that was the scariest moment I've gotten myself into."

I once took her out in a 40 knot Southerly across a ""sound"" between Amherst and Picton, with 50 miles of Lake Ontario fetch building 8-12'ers overnight.

sailing,3bl7bj,heartbeat123,4,Tue Jun 30 15:50:57 2015 UTC,"Not very dangerous, but the creepiest experience I've had so far is in our Tanzer 22 in the middle of intense fog on Lake Ontario.   The water temp was about 10C and the air was in the upper 30s (it was the beginning of August). The wall of fog moved in around 11am and did not clear until 8pm. We could just barely see beyond the bow and it was dead calm, like glass. We had just passed a freighter preparing to leave the concrete plant near Port Darlington when it disappeared in the incoming fog. We were motoring at about 2 knots so that we could listen for the freighter and hear anything else coming our direction.   We decided that the best way to avoid a large freighter was to stay closer to shore and the shallows. A nuclear power plant is also near Port Darlington. It has a fairly large, but poorly marked marine exclusion zone. As we neared the plant (the hum of which overpowered all the other noises in the fog), we headed out deeper into the lake to clear the zone. Remember that we could only see a couple feet in front of the bow. When I thought we were far enough (at the same depth when we cleared the plant a couple days before), I turned back toward the west.  All of the sudden, the water in front of us appeared to be violently boiling from below. The depth gauge read about 50ft and it was hard to comprehend what could turn flat water into a sudden cauldron in the middle of Lake Ontario. As we passed over, I realized we were motoring right over the warm water outflow of the power plant. The warmer water rose straight to the surface, and it created enough turbulence to push the boat around. In a day of even light air, this outflow would probably be barely noticeable, but on flat water when all my senses were already heightened from trying to keep the boat on course by compass alone and listening for every little noise for fear of impending collision with a lake freighter, it was scary as hell. Again, not dangerous, but creepy."

That sucked, and I was very happy that I didn't have a detachable keel to worry about. We thankfully were able to keep stern on to the sea and after a period of crapping ourselves, we got a bit more water and bounced over the bank. Fortunately there was no damage to speak of.  My crew misjudged the depth, I didn't double check. Ultimately it was my responsibility."

They did a half hour weekly show that was kind of a reality tv format. During each leg they had live check ins with the boats and had guests with previous racing experience. These lasted 10-15 min.

And that may prove difficult, as the hull may not be able to handle the added stress.  You're also going to need a brand new mast, and re-cut the sail to add a bolt rope. A Laser II mast would work, you'll just have to add a mast-head halyard.  To be honest, this is a pretty serious project. And it won't be cheap. It's probably easier (and potentially cheaper, depending on where you live) to just buy a single handed boat that already has a kite on it (such as an RS Vareo), or one that can have one added easier (such as a Contender)"

There's gonna be more lateral force on the glass than it was probably built for. I guess it depends on how he envisions attaching it, but I still think reinforcement would be a good idea."

If you have a junky old Laser, it might be a fun project."
sailing,3bkgmv,crashorbit,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:46:38 2015 UTC,Looks to me that a stub from a broken mast and a bit of clever machining/welding will give you a hook where you can fix your kite rig.

sailing,3biulz,strolls,3,Mon Jun 29 16:29:44 2015 UTC,"I think I had a positive impression from FindaCrew.net when browsing them a year or two ago, but I find premium membership there is about the same price.  I'd have to have very strong personal references before I'd shell out that much to send an email.  Aren't there any Facebook groups?  I think the pricing of these services probably reflects how damn hard it is to connect with suitable sailors - I think maybe they can charge a fee because people are desperate, not because they're good value.  I'm reminded of the OKcupid blog post, ""Why you should never pay for online dating.""  Jill Dickin Schinas has written quite a bit about crew finding - I'm not saying you're in the same category as someone with no sailing skills, but if her first article doesn't do so, I think maybe her followup one conveys the difficulty and importance of finding companions with compatible personalities.   Personally, I'd write to the 100 largest marinas and sailing clubs on the east coast, asking them to pin a flier to their noticeboards, before I'd spend $200 a year on a website subscription.  For myself, I'm resigned to spending money on professionally guided trips and on lessons.  The proprietor of a yacht delivery company posted on another forum this week that all his crews have RYA yachtsmaster qualifications. If even his deckhands have qualifications, think of all the experienced sailors you're competing with just for the unpaid slots."

I am however looking at buying a 27-30' yacht for my brother to do bluewater sailing and looking at Pearsons, Nor'sea 27s, etc.,"

You are looking at the low end of the spectrum.  Items like this can easily cost more than the boat. That said, you can probably sail around very happilly on a less than shipshap cheap fiberglass cruiser. I have. But you asked about seaworthiness. All these boats have crossed blue water before, but it takes money to fit such a boat out for it safely."

sailing,3bhuyb,Ferrytraveller,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:14:34 2015 UTC,Dude if you don't know you should learn.  That's maybe the most basic question about buying a boat.  Boats are expensive and they stick with your for a while.  They are hard to get rid of.  You need to know what you want and take your time because there are a lot of super shitty boats in the world.    Seriously.  You need to learn how to sail a small boat really well and research the bigger boat you might want.    Read the craft of sail.

Be a bit conservative going downwind, trying not to go too far downwind as the boat will rock easily. Keep angles a bit closer to an open reach and be decisive when gybing, meaning -again- stay away from flat out downwind angles until you get a hang on balancing this boat.   Also, simple tip: try to keep the sheet more or less clear as you go. It's easy to entangle it somewhere during tacking and gybing, which means you end up in the water."

sailing,3be499,rushur,6,Sun Jun 28 12:04:15 2015 UTC,is he not practicing this on purpose as a racing technique?  -less wetted surface  -standing so he can employ his legs  -loose vang so the leech pumps
sailing,3be499,RoyYourBoyToy,2,Sun Jun 28 15:18:56 2015 UTC,"With a vang that loose, the sail shape is awful and instead of powering up correctly, the sail will billow and make it extremely hard to both steer and not deathroll.  If he had enough vang on, he would want windward heel going downwind. Not because of wetted surface area, but because it brings the center of effort directly over the center of resistance, making the helm neutral."
sailing,3be499,TheCrazySquirell,1 point,Mon Jun 29 03:50:17 2015 UTC,"He's not, the vang actually broke, HOWEVER he often has the boat looking like this normally minus the loose vang, you only need to loosen it enough to get the leech pumping, anymore and it's wasted energy."
sailing,3be499,knowledgewhore,2,Mon Jun 29 11:24:15 2015 UTC,"This is the correct way to get downwind really fast, he's sailling by the lee (boom on ""wrong"" side) with the center of effort in the sail in line with the center of lateral resistance of the boat (daggerboard)."
sailing,3be499,TheCrazySquirell,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:47:17 2015 UTC,"He could be at the bottom of an S turn, but the technique is ineffective because his vang is so slacked that the top batten is no longer parallel with boom.  When he completes the bottom turn, he would be releasing the sheet to the stop, and the flick of the battens would be similar to a legal pump."
sailing,3be499,knowledgewhore,1 point,Sun Jun 28 19:03:25 2015 UTC,"What? Sorry I'm a a little confused here, ineffective because the batten isn't parallel to the boom? wat?"
sailing,3be499,TheCrazySquirell,2,Sun Jun 28 19:07:57 2015 UTC,"To go fast in a laser downwind, usually with a little swell, is to use a technique called ""s-turning"".  It is the combination of heeling the boat, flicking the sail, and using the rudder as little as possible. To keep the boat stable during this maneuver, the leech of the sail must be in line with the boom.  Specifically the top batten.  When the boat is stable, you want the leach to spill a tad bit (the batten is pushed forward) and the skipper takes the boat to a by-the-lee course.  At that point the boat is past dead downwind."
sailing,3be499,knowledgewhore,1 point,Sun Jun 28 19:38:21 2015 UTC,"the leech of the sail must be in line with the boom Do you mean a different part of the sail? I'm kinda get what you mean now but when I asked the ""batten isn't parallel to the boom?"" question I meant more along the lines of what would a batten being in line with the boom do since the battens are slanted slightly down on the sail and by having the kicker loose you only increase said angle."
sailing,3be499,TheCrazySquirell,1 point,Sun Jun 28 19:47:40 2015 UTC,"It's hard to explain without doing hand karate.  The top batten flicks back and forth. In the picture, the top batten is blown forward, and spilling the leech.  Increasing vang tension would bring it aft, while the boom goes down."

The angle grinder/cup-brush combo was too aggressive, as was another attachment which was supposed to be especially for gel-coat.  My 5"" power sander was a pain because of the chine of the hull.  In the end, I went with my trusty Bahco carbide scraper (mine is like this, but I think there is a newer model now), which required a bit more elbow grease, but does a really nice job."

The important thing about scrapers is that the cheap-ass wall paint scrapers that have a bent piece of iron there as a blade don't do shit. You need the kind with a really hard blade. And Bahcos have amazing blades and really cut through the layers. Of course it took a while, but with that scraper it worked out a lot faster than I had anticipated.  On mine I didn't have to go all the way to the gelcoat as we hit a really well done layer of epoxy which we just sanded one the old antifouling was gone and then painted a few more layers of epoxy primer on it and antifouling after that.

""Good enough for light air lake sailing"" is a dangerous mentality.  That said, yes you are right to be cautious but it sounds like the guy is a motivated seller.  Sails and rigging are relatively cheap on a boat that size but you need to make sure the hull and deck are sound.  No soft spots unless you and looking forward to fiberglass work.

sailing,3b9tc2,Karma_Killz,3,Sat Jun 27 15:05:54 2015 UTC,"You are way off.  That's a 42' but so it's nearly 50% longer.  That's at least double the cubic volume.  Everything scales way up.   Way heavier, way more materials, much larger engine, sails, rigging, etc.  Large systems like ac and generator.  Comparing a boat in the 30's and a boat in the 40's is not apples to apples."

sailing,3b9tc2,texasrigger,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:12:44 2015 UTC,"I'm not a big fan of this particular layout, but I'd expect a lot more interior space in a 40' over a 30', on deck and particularly in the cockpit.  Not shown in the photos in that listing is the Pearson's second double berth - you can see it in this photo of another boat of the same model.  IMO it's that second berth that makes larger boats worth the money - having the extra space to retain some privacy if friends cruise with you, and to store shit when you're on your boat longterm.  Obviously, you'll always find people circumnavigating on 30'ers, but it looks to me like having the extra few feet would make serious voyaging a lot more comfortable.  The current market, though, I have a 40' boat bookmarked which is at least as nice as that, listed at $50k. I think that's the second price reduction in a few weeks, as my bookmark says $60k."

sailing,3b7tcv,dpg5q,8,Fri Jun 26 17:44:40 2015 UTC,"What we did right:   We got really lucky with the crew we brought with us. My fiance and I knew everyone, but none of the other couples had met each other before. Turned out everyone got along splendidly and we couldn’t have asked for better crew chemistry. Don’t underestimate this point - the trip would not have been nearly as successful or fun for everyone without this. BVI Yacht Charters was great. They were significantly cheaper than the Moorings and Sunsail, and even though the boat we chartered was 8 years old, it was well-maintained and almost everything worked great. As I mentioned, we did have that one issue with the deck shower hose, but aside from the initial confusion about our water, was not a big deal. The charter base staff was also very helpful, and they made the check-in/check-out processes easy and quick.  Provisioning - we were prepared with a shopping list which made it quick and easy to get what we needed the night we arrived, which meant that we were able to get an early start the first day of the charter, and also that we didn’t waste much food. Ordering beer and water from Caribbean Cellars was also a good choice as we got a better price and didn’t have to carry all of that liquid to the boat.  We had a good balance of locations in our itinerary, and we got to see a lot of different places and still make most of the must-see stops in the BVIs. You can’t get to everything in just a week, but I am happy with what we got to do and see.    What I would do differently:   Almost all of the problems we ran into (other than the minor issues with the boat) were because we were rushing around. Some of that was because we wanted to get to anchorages early to make sure we got mooring balls, but some of it was just trying to fit as much as possible into the trip. SLOW DOWN! You will make fewer mistakes and have a better trip overall. More confidence in my anchoring ability would have also helped my anxiety about getting to anchorages early to pick up mooring balls, too.  I was really excited to use the trolling rod that I rented, but we ended up only using it one day. I was just too busy focusing on the sailing to be able to deal with it. Fishing off the stern at night with my travel rod was more than enough, so I will skip the trolling rod rental next time.  I really liked the flow of the counter-clockwise-around-Tortola itinerary, but in hindsight, it would have been much easier to go clockwise. The winds shifted halfway through our trip and it meant that half of our sailing days were upwind slogs.  The Baths on Virgin Gorda are much cooler when you visit by boat - there appeared to be plenty of mooring balls still available mid morning, so I would take that route next time. On the other hand, taking a taxi allowed us to stop at Hog Heaven for lunch, which was a real treat.  We probably could have used a little less bottled water, but I suppose better safe than sorry. Not everyone needs to know how to sail, but I would have given a little more instruction to the crew about how to operate the dinghy, as it would have afforded people a little more independence, and made me worry less about crew going ashore by themselves.    Resources I used to prepare:   I studied online charts and cruising guides to familiarize myself with the general layout of the islands and to create some potential itineraries I read forums extensively, where I picked up on some great information that I wouldn’t have seen otherwise. /r/sailing, and CruisersForum.com were both helpful, but TravelTalkOnline.com seems to be the most active and best forum for sailing the BVIs.  I read a lot of blogs and guides to get a better idea of what we would need in terms of provisioning, and to evaluate the different options of where to get different things.  Once I knew what kind of boat we were going to be sailing, I tried really hard to familiarize myself with the details. I looked up owner’s manuals, watched Youtube videos and just tried to learn as much as I could beforehand so I would have something to build off of during the boat briefing.    Thats about it! It was a great trip and all of us can’t wait to do it again. Overall it went surprisingly well for our first bareboat charter, though we did learn a few lessons and got some great experience."

sailing,3b7tcv,nicwolff,2,Fri Jun 26 19:18:20 2015 UTC,"I submitted a sailing resume listing my qualifications in a bit more detail than the paragraph I included above. They deemed that fine, and I presume since I was knowledgeable in the boat briefing they didn't need any more assurance. Generally they want you to have experience on a boat that is within 5 feet of the length you are chartering, and if they have any hesitation (or rather their insurance has any hesitation) they may ask you to do a checkout sail, or request that you take a skipper for your first night.   In my case I was expecting (and was ready) for them to really grill me or ask to see my certs, or to do a checkout sail, but they didn't need it and we just headed out."
sailing,3b7tcv,hvyhitter,3,Fri Jun 26 20:12:00 2015 UTC,"Great summary! My wife and I did a very similar charter at the beginning of April: we took a brand-new Oceanis 35 from BVI Yacht Charter for a week, also through LateSail. And we also found the team there helpful and responsive, especially when the cockpit engine control panel died and we had to return to base for a replacement – which took them less than 20 minutes. The boat was so clean, it was like we sailed it off a boat-show dock. And the dinghy and its outboard were new too, which after having some hard starters on previous charters was a repeated pleasure.  The main difference in our float plan was that we skipped Jost and spent two days on Anegada, which was spectacular – so different from the other islands in geology and mood. It has 3/4 the area of Tortola, with about 1/100 the inhabitants! The reef around the island and the shallow channel to the one mooring field keeps larger monohulls out but it's a catamaran parking lot. The beaches are gorgeous and empty, and the bar by the dock is full of loquacious locals and cruisers.  We spent our first and last nights on a mooring in Great Harbor on Peter Island right across from Road Town, and walked over to the resort for happy hour and dinner – expensive but it's nice to ease back into elegant society at the end of a cruise, especially on a smaller boat!  We spent one night tucked behind Saba Rock. Hog Heaven on Gorda is not to be missed just for the view – but did you meet the friendly tomcat?  This was our third charter, and a lot more laid back than our first two out of St. Martin and around Anguilla and St. Barts, where the winds and waves are right off the Atlantic and the mooring balls are few and in sad shape..."

Based on the Youtube of wicked salty however I am thinking we might skip the other Caribbean and actually spend a week in the Bermuda area. Good write up however. Got the brain thinking about a lot of things.   Ive considered taking the ASA 104 and Ive told the instructor my sailing resume and he told me. ""I would test you right out of 101 and 103. It will be review for you. Right now my most pressing thing to learn is Sail trim. i am self taught.. sure.. I know how to sail but sail trim is something Id like to see and learn. Ive never had formal instructions and there has to be more to it then. ""Make sure the telltales are pointing straight back or that the inner and outer ones are both streaming backwards.   I always feel like a noob when sailing because of that.   so that being said.. which ASA class takes on THAT the best?"
sailing,3b7tcv,Jewnadian,2,Fri Jun 26 23:59:33 2015 UTC,"It's an awesome experience... I like to joke that it ""ruined"" all other kinds of vacations for me. That said, definitely do the BVI's first. They are the #1 cruising area in the world for lots of reasons, and they are perfect for your first charter. The Bahamas (which I assume you mean instead of Bermuda) are great too (especially the Abacos for beginners) and though I haven't chartered there yet, I can't imagine them being as good as the BVIs.   As for the ASA classes, I think 103 covers sail trim in the most depth, but honestly, I wouldn't take a class just to work on that. Sail trim is something that I think you learn best simply through more time on the water, experimenting and adjusting as the conditions call for it. You can always go out and do some figure 8 drills, trimming the boat through each point of sail and using tacks or jibes so that you travel in a figure 8 pattern.   104 touches on some advanced sailing mechanics, but really the focus of 104 is on ""seamanship."" Gaining an understanding of boat systems, what to do in different emergencies, anchoring in different conditions and using different techniques, and more advanced navigation."

sailing,3b7byv,farmerstone,1 point,Sat Jun 27 04:06:56 2015 UTC,"8 Meters are fantastic boats, always gorgeous, but a funny size. You see all of the International Rule boats are lead mines, deep, and narrow. A 6 Meter is great for around the bay and around the buoys, and a 12 Meter can sail anywhere. They were even used for offshore racing for awhile, but the 8 Meter isn't quite big enough for the big seas. Working bow on them is tricky too. A 6 meter, IOD, shields are all small enough that you can do the leap from mast to forestay, and a 12 meter is beamy enough that you can wobble up, but a 8 meter has the scary narrow run up. Best strategy, run for it and hope you make it."

Thanks for bringing the Atlantic up though. I sail in that class and they look similar but not quite close enough. The immediate giveaway for me was the backstay, and then of course there are a bunch of other things when you look more closely.   BTW the boat pictured, 142, is very active in the fleet still. This is a very old picture but the boat itself (or at least that hull number) is campaigned very successfully out of Cedar Point Yacht Club on Long Island.

Someone close to him was telling me he was very sick and  he quite possibly was affected by it on his way back from soldier key.   Knowing biscayne bay it's quite likely he encountered a big wake that knocked him off his boat. What makes me wonder is why he did not have his life jacket on while operating the boat. For a high level sailor like that it's second nature to step on a small boat with a life jacket on.

sailing,3b8seb,Ashipsailed,2,Fri Jun 26 22:07:49 2015 UTC,"David Seidman's The Complete Sailor  I think this is such an amazing book - nothing in it lacks explanation.  Seidman explains the principles of sail in such a well-structured way - I am quite staggered by how well he has organised his book, and the sequence of subjects, to achieve this.   It starts out talking about the wind - the directions it blows from, and the strengths of the Beaufort scale - and then talks about points of sail - sailing downwind, into the wind and on a beam reach. And so on… each topic is the next in a logical progression, and each builds upon the last.  I've read two or three other beginners books and have started on some more advanced ones, and none of the others have achieved the clarity and simplicity of this work. You will want to build upon it by reading some other works, too, but I think The Complete Sailor will nurture an insight to the mechanics of sail."

Hopefully it affects how people design, build and check their keels and affect what possible emergency scenarios are considered in training and readiness. Besides that my takeaway is this: Often you can do everything 'right' and something wildly unexpected to you (and to general knowledge) can happen. Thus it is wise to be as conservative as possible in all things when out of touch of rescue. At least if something does happen you will have a better chance of survival. In no way do I blame the crew or skipper at all in this incident but in hindsight I found myself thinking, ""Go to Bermuda"", ""avoid the higher latitudes and possible stronger weather"", reduce sail and slow down, ""make sure you have some sea dye marker on you in case you're in the water.""  Perhaps it would have made no difference, perhaps it could've."

The author of this, yet again, op ed goes on to talk about the crew was ""well trained and knew what they were doing"". Ok, but where's the commentary on if they had a weather router, or if they didn't, for making poor routing decisions?

""Therefore, we are recommending that flight crew training be improved, particularly in the area of identifying the cracking sound that comes just before failure and also in using the escape hatches and parachutes after the wings fall off.""  I would be more comfortable with saying that he standard and design should evolve to make boats safer. Because obviously this boat had repeated groundings, who knows how good the survey was so determine the damage, and who knows how well the boat was repaired.  So to lower the risk of damage, poor surveys and bad repairs, the standard and design should evolve.   It would be interesting so know the total number of 40.7's built and how many of them had keel failure.  And find out what percentage of the total that represents.  I myself know of  three 40.7's that had this problem.  And then relate that to to automotive industry and see how many failures of a design in their world would either drive a design change or a recall."

sailing,3b6ixw,hvyhitter,4,Fri Jun 26 11:07:20 2015 UTC,"Good job replacing the air filter.  You'll want to keep a spare on-board, just in case.  Here's an ultra-basic rundown of the diesel engine concept: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTAUq6G9apg  Transmission fluid lasts a good while, but you should pay attention to its condition.  Good tranny fluid is translucent red, so if it looks black or too dark or has particulates in it, change it out.  You won't hurt anything by changing it and you could use the experience.  This image gives you a sense of the colours: http://mazda3revolution.com/forums/attachment.php?attachmentid=15113&d=1371369650  Most motors have a service manual produced by the manufacturer for use by mechanics, so if you're looking for references, this is the Bible.  I think this is it: http://j30.us/files/2qm15_servicemanual.pdf I recommend you print it out and keep it on-board.  You need to learn how to bleed the fuel lines.  They get air trapped in them and your engine will have a facility to help you get this done.  Search up Youtube, or maybe it's in that manual I just linked to you.  There's a joke about diesel engines: ""A diesel engine only needs three things to operate: fuel, fuel and fuel."" Most problems experienced underway come from dirty fuel, a blocked line, a bad filter...something like that.  Is your fuel tank filthy?  Are your lines clean?  Are your filters fresh? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETfjGSnmCeg https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyIfCmjDB2Q  KEEP SPARE FUEL FILTERS ON BOARD!  Also the tools required to change filters and bleed lines.  A glow plug's job is to warm up the cylinders in cold conditions so that when the piston compresses the fuel-air mixture, it gets hot enough to explode.  You just hold the button down for a few seconds, release and immediately crank the engine.  Glow plugs last a good long time.  The other thing that catches people is the cooling system.  Your diesel is water-cooled, and that water comes from the outside, i.e. the lake or the sea by way of a thru-hull.  Once it has done its loop around the cooling system, that water is ejected overboard via another thru-hull, above the waterline.  When you start your engine you want to make sure that water is coming out!  Otherwise your engine is overheating: shut it down!  Usually the problem is that the intake thru-hull is clogged with some crud.  It's worth checking up on that, making sure the intake is clear, etc.  Some people keep baby diapers on board to deal with bad spills quickly and neatly.  Rags and latex gloves are good, too."
sailing,3b6ixw,suryastra,2,Fri Jun 26 13:15:05 2015 UTC,"Couple things: That engine doesn't have a glow plug. It actually has a hand crank that you can use to start it in a pinch. To bleed the fuel line, use the thumb pump next to the oil dipstick and loosen the philips screw on top of the fuel filter housing (the filter is front strbd and looks like a hanging Twinkie) and pump until all air bubbles and foaming is gone. To change the filter, I use a big channel locks wrench on the notched ring at the top of the Twinkie bit. After changing, you'll have to bleed it, and it will take a little while for the throttle to clear its throat even after pumping out the air manually. Just keep giving it gas and it'll smooth out.   There are 2 zincs in the engine that need to be replaced off and on, esp if you are saltwater cooled. They're behind big square bolts, one in front and one in back.   Finally: alignment is super important! Watch the place where the transmission meets the prop shaft while underway. Is there any vibration at all? If so, get a feeler gauge and set aside a day to realign the motor to the shaft. We lost our trans output coupling in the islands because of unaddressed poor alignment. Good luck! I love that motor."
sailing,3b6ixw,weezthejooce,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:51:46 2015 UTC,"I have the 2QM20 engine, the 20hp version of OP's engine, so hopefully I can add some info.    In regards to the fuel filter change, don't forget about the primary (larger) fuel filter!  To change it, you shut off the fuel at the tank so no new fuel is entering the fuel lines (my boat also has a smaller shutoff valve just above the filter.  Close those, and unscrew the wing nut at the bottom of the filter housing to drain any diesel in there.  CATCH THAT DIESEL, or else its going in your bilge.  Next you unbolt the housing from it's holder thingy, my bolt is on top, and pull the housing off.  Catch any diesel that may dribble out.  Replace the paper filter element and any o-rings that came with the filter (don't forget the big one underneath the housing holder thingy that the housing bolts to) and just lightly rub some fresh diesel on the o-rings before bolting everything back together.    With this filter, my filter is lower than the fuel tank, so the filter will self prime as soon as I open the fuel valves again thanks to gravity.  If yours is higher than the engine, you can fill the housing up with fresh diesel to prime it, or use the fuel pump in the tank.  Someone else will have to speak on this, though, I've never had to deal with it.    Then with the secondary, you just loosen that ring that screws the housing onto the engine (I used a flathead screwdriver and a hammer to gently break it loose, those grooves on the ring are handy, then I unscrewed by hand).  Catch any fuel that dribbles out, then replace paper filter and o-rings like the other one.  Reassemble, then you loosen the highest bolt on the filter housing.  Don't take it off, just loosen it, and then you will find a little lever/pump by your oil dipstick.  Press that until just clean diesel comes out, no bubbles, and then close the bolt back.  Filters are now changed."
sailing,3b6ixw,GooglesYourShit,2,Fri Jun 26 17:23:33 2015 UTC,"I had a 2QM15 on my boat for a few years. Some other points, in addition to /u/suryastra's excellent post:  Raw water impellers - have several spares on board. They can fail without warning, and then your engine isn't getting the cooling water it requires. Diesels are built like tanks, and pretty much the only thing that can really damage/destroy them is overheating. Don't let that happen!  Your engine also has a zinc, which most owners neglect to change! Mine was frozen solid after probably 15 years of use - I actually couldn't even get it off. Yours is probably better off - keep it that way.  Have fun - the 2QM15 is a solid engine."
sailing,3b6ixw,synalx,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:15:08 2015 UTC,good news.. so you just put a wrench on it and take it off correct?   I just added a zinc to the prop shaft. The previous guy never had one. I am only in Lake Erie however so who knows. I added one. I will see what it looks like at the end of the season. Ill also check out the zincs. (I THINK there was two if I read the yanmar manual correctly.)
sailing,3b6ixw,JETEXAS,2,Sat Jun 27 11:12:01 2015 UTC,"50f to 100f seems like a big temperature swing, but it's not really in the case of an engine. 10w-40 should have you covered with no problem. Where it starts getting tricky is when your temps are swinging above and below freezing, but then you would probably want to use a block heater to bring the engine temp up before trying to start it."
sailing,3b6ixw,GooglesYourShit,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:42:44 2015 UTC,:) today it is 56 in Cleveland. Yesterday it was 70. It DOES get to high 90s ALL the time. but good to know about the oil. Thank you for the reply it is REALLY REALLY helpful.
sailing,3b6ixw,damandsire,2,Sat Jun 27 11:10:19 2015 UTC,"OP, I have the 20hp version of your engine (a 1978) and I have some advice.  Don't forget the impellers that help move water to cool the engine.  It's good practice to keep a few on board in case one fails, and change them every few years.  It's an easy swap, you just unscrew the cover (round metal part with two hoses attached to it), remove the old impeller, grease up the new impeller to help it last longer, and reinstall.    If you have an owners manual for the engine, it is a wealth of information.    Other than that all you need to worry about is oil, oil filter, fuel filters, occassionally your tranny fluid, and occassionally your air filter.  That's it.  Throw some fuel injector cleaner into the tank (I use Heet) which also keeps your fuel tank clean, and you're good to go.  Running some Seafoam cleaner through the fuel tank wouldn't hurt either.  It seems to have helped my engine out.    Your engine does not have glow plugs, it heats via compression only.  It may need to crank longer in cold temperatures, and be sure to let it idle for 10 minutes or so if its cold outside, but that's it.    Edit: Also, regarding oil type for these engines, Delo 400 15w-40 or Rotella 15w-40 are the two most often used and will serve you best.  Honestly I view either as pretty much the same.  I personally run Rotella simply because I couldn't find Delo 400 (found it after the oil change; typical) and I like to keep me oil type consistent so for now I'm stick with it.  The Delo 400 stares at me every time I walk through Walmart, though, and you won't go wrong with it.  15w-40 is the best all-around weight for it, too.  I live in Tennessee where it gets in the upper 90's in the summer and into the teens and single digits (F) in the winter, and have never had an issue with this engine."
sailing,3b6ixw,gremblor,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:28:22 2015 UTC,Yanmar actually recommends the Rotella 15w-40 for all diesels now.
sailing,3b6ixw,gremblor,1 point,Sat Jun 27 06:52:34 2015 UTC,Thank you friend. Seems I have to figure out this fuel filter thing. I knew that about the impeller (I do NOT have one on board.) The previous owner has damn near everything else on board however. He did indicate that he replaced the impeller last summer and he said you should be good for at least 2 years. The thing he doesnt realize is I use my boat like mad. He had 267 miles on the boat in the 5 years he used it. (That is from the Raymarine system that cannot be reset. Ive already gone 100-120 miles :) in 2 months and i a BRAND new at this. Thank you for the information.
sailing,3b6ixw,texasrigger,2,Sat Jun 27 11:09:01 2015 UTC,"I have only a few small tips for regular operation.  Clean up your engine compartment so the porcelain is all shiny. That way, when you inspect your engine, it's immediately obvious if something is leaking.  Check these before you go out: * fuel in the fuel filter is nice and clean looking. It should be a deep pinkish red color. * the antifreeze bottle is filled to the ""cold"" line. If it's not, top it off. (And find that leak) * oil is at the correct level via the dipstick test.  Track your hours in a logbook, then change the oil when it gets to 100 hours, or annually, whichever is sooner.  Your diesel typically only wants to run at a set RPM. Look it up in the operator's manual (you can find this via google). Don't cruise at other throttle speeds. (It's ok to go slow in the marina, or while you're idling to warm it up, etc, but don't run it at 1/2 throttle for an hour or more)  If your boat has an alternator, then you'll have a throttle kill line near the engine controls. Don't turn it off by the ignition key; always use the kill line, or you can blow out your alternator.  Good luck!"
sailing,3b5eu7,okiedokiealky,5,Fri Jun 26 02:54:50 2015 UTC,"Pure speculation here, but there are a few factors. Check the age of those hulls.  My guess is the seemingly unreasonably cheap ones you're seeing are older.  And yeah, that size-range was popular for families.  Also think of the desperation level.  The bigger the boat, the more it costs you in mooring fees, so the sooner you get clear of it, the better."
sailing,3b5eu7,suryastra,4,Fri Jun 26 03:14:32 2015 UTC,"The market is flooded with 20-40 y.o. fiberglass boats, in the 20-30 ft range.  A big part of the reason that they are so popular is because that's about as big as you can go without becoming difficult to trailer."
sailing,3b5eu7,Chaos_Spear,3,Fri Jun 26 06:01:19 2015 UTC,"Is this just because there are more of them?   Few things:   They are boats on CL. (they are for the most part the cheaper ones,  you will see different prices if you go to a broker, as they will be much newer and in better condition) Fiberglass, it created a boom so there is lots of not so well taken care of inventory to be found for cheap. The smaller boats are most likley newer and in much better shape."
sailing,3b5eu7,FlickrPaul,5,Fri Jun 26 03:15:30 2015 UTC,From what I have seen a poorly taken care of boat will often cost you as much as the original purchase price to fix.
sailing,3b5eu7,assi9001,3,Fri Jun 26 12:49:09 2015 UTC,Yea the boats I'm seeing are pretty much all from the 80's. Is that old for a sailboat? Sorry if it's a dumb question I'm very new to sailing.
sailing,3b5eu7,FlickrPaul,4,Fri Jun 26 03:20:12 2015 UTC,"Not really, provided it has been well taken care of.  I race a boat that is an 29ft 1981, but that boat is covered and dry for 7months of the year and gets gone through stem to stern each season.  Also about to come into to the market, but a bit more than 2X what you are seeing for prices."
sailing,3b5eu7,reyomnwahs,2,Fri Jun 26 03:39:18 2015 UTC,"Not only is 80s not old for a sailboat, 70s and early 80s boats are going to be a lot more overbuilt than their Reagan Recession and post oil crisis counterparts. Going 90s will get you some design benefits but for the most part 70s-80s (and refitted or well-cared for 60s) boats are a helluva deal."

sailing,3b5eu7,tordek1265,3,Fri Jun 26 21:29:54 2015 UTC,You arent asking any dumb questions and you let me know if someone harasses you here. I am 99% sure this place is filled with awesome dudes and ladies. Fiberglass has stood the test of time. even a 1980s boat is still very viable if taken care of. Even if they werent a lot of them can be restored. I will attempt to answer your questions in this thread as best I can because I just went through the whole process and I DO know a lot about sailing but I knew nothing about buying a boat.
sailing,3b5eu7,hvyhitter,3,Fri Jun 26 10:48:17 2015 UTC,"I am looking for 25' boats in that price range as well, specifically ones that can be trailered back to my house to save on the cost of winter storage.  There are a lot of crappy boats that you want to stay away from in that range, but there are some well kept ones as well.  Try checking out the book Inspecting the Aging Sailboat by Don Casey.  Might help you judge some of them for yourself."
sailing,3b5eu7,tordek1265,2,Fri Jun 26 03:38:28 2015 UTC,something to think about. Anchorage can be cheap. Shop around for storage. Trailoring a boat means you wont use it as much. I am down on my boat daily because I got it right in the middle of between work and home. I thought this way initially and then I went to 30 footers. Of course I have a wife and 3 kids and dream of cruising lake erie. I am not sure what your goals are.   Here is a tip from me. Dont be shy.. offer 20% less than asking price REGARDLESS of the price. Expect to pay 10% less after negotiating. I learned that is the NORM in sailboats.   Oh yeah and look at 20+ sailboats before you buy.
sailing,3b5eu7,robi2106,1 point,Fri Jun 26 10:51:03 2015 UTC,"I was planning on keeping on a mooring during the season, and only using the trailer to store it during the winter, rather than paying to have it hauled out and stored in a yard."
sailing,3b5eu7,muyuu,3,Mon Jun 29 17:43:42 2015 UTC,"I just bought a 15' Coronado for $500 on CL.  1967.  I'm the 3rd owner.  I have the very first bill of sale, the original owners manual, parts list (weep at the prices for a main sail... $150) etc.  The boat is pretty rough, but considering that it is very similar to the Olympic 470 class, this boat should be a lot of fun to sail.  Of course, this is a dinghy class boat, and a significantly old one at that."
sailing,3b5eu7,hvyhitter,3,Fri Jun 26 06:38:38 2015 UTC,"These boats are the least affected by fashion, obsolescence and market segmentation - all of which play on the seller's part and against the buyer. GRP hulls remain serviceable for ages with minimum maintenance. Older boats remain at the market for a long time and the market growth cannot keep up with this. As a result newer makes almost don't do ""utilitarian"" boats at all, they go for racers and high end yachts which is also what is overwhelmingly being marketed. There's a massive divide between what's marketed and what you mostly find in the water.   This is also why the British yachting industry suffered a severe cull in the mid-90s. Older Westerlies, Parkers, Moodys, Corbys, Hunters, Sigmas, etc remain in the water. It's also the reason why smaller new cruisers are mostly pointless and racer/cruisers are a lot more common."
sailing,3b5eu7,hvyhitter,3,Fri Jun 26 09:07:08 2015 UTC,20-30 foot boats are more to maintain. They are more to get dockage for they cost more in general.   Here is the most important question I can think of. What is your goal? For me I have a family and a wife (who I like a lot) and I wanted to cruise lake erie in preparation for crusing the world some day. For me 30 foot was the minimum. I also want to race smaller boats. So I really need 2 boats to accomplish my goals? Do you want to just day sail? Do you want to overnight and go long distances? These are all important. We here in the sub can guide you torward boats that are in your price range but finding one that meets your sailing goals is the most important.   It doesnt take much. Hell you could start with a small Opti for 1000 bucks. Simple day sailing that is forgiving. You can find these ALL over. Hell you can buy them for 800 dollars.   What is your goal? Dont focus on price yet..   another thing that was strange. I found there were NO deals out there. I looked at around 20 boats within 100 miles of home. Price and quality were VERY VERY proportional. I had a budget of 8000 initially and we tripled that budget and got an amazing boat with many features and the condition was FAN tastic. at 2 months in I am EXTREMELY happy.
sailing,3b5eu7,IvorTheEngine,2,Fri Jun 26 10:55:15 2015 UTC,"I really want to live aboard eventually, but for now I'd love to just go on adventures for maybe a week at a time and camp out on the boat. I don't think I'd do much racing because I'm not very competitive. Thank you all for the kind replies this is an awesome sub!"
sailing,3b5eu7,bigfig,2,Fri Jun 26 16:12:45 2015 UTC,yeah my quick opinion.. go for something 30+ foot range.   and if you can.. look at a center cockpit boat. The amount of space in mine feels a LOT bigger than a regular 30 footer. I am going to do a youtube post of my boat inside soon. I had one before but I want to edit it better.
sailing,3b5eu7,sloopy_sails,1 point,Sat Jun 27 11:13:55 2015 UTC,Okay sounds great!
sailing,3b5eu7,reyomnwahs,3,Sat Jun 27 12:33:26 2015 UTC,"The small, expensive boats that you found are probably racing machines, so it's not surprising that they're expensive. They're probably much newer and have very high specification equipment.  It's a bit like asking why racing cars cost more than a minivan when they don't have as many seats.  Also, a small boat without heavy ballast can be towed by an ordinary car, launched by hand and rowed or paddled instead of needing an expensive engine. If you're only doing day-sailing and can manage without a cabin, you get a lot more space in the cockpit. Most 25 footers can only comfortably take two or three, the same as an open boat of half the size."
sailing,3b5eu7,rektALproLAPSE,3,Fri Jun 26 11:22:48 2015 UTC,"I read somewhere that as you double the size of the boat, you square the cost to upkeep.  For a used boat that is not trailerable, I would venture that the purchase price is almost negligible compared to upkeep.  Which, if you think about it, explains some of the ""odd"" trends you are seeing.  I don't think I can summarize all the things I have learned to look at here, and frankly I took the easy route and hired a marine surveyor when I bought my boat.  What did I find with my ""sweet"" 30 foot boat:   engine thermostat housing almost corroded away no zinc in the heat exchanger needed a new raw water pump oil pan scary rusty, new oil pan will be at least $500 hull good, but doing a bottom job this year anyhow cockpit needed new epoxy and hair crack repair compass has a HUGE bubble (okay minor) pulpit needs reseating lifelines need replacing needed to re-do the electrical panel most everything electrical on the mast needed repair something going on inside the rudder, will probably replace when I scrape together $2000.

If I were doing it, I'd look for a full keel boat with beefy rigging in good shape and some kind of autopilot, be it a wind vane or electric with spare parts and a good battery charging solution. I'd have a sat tracker and an epirb, and maybe an AIS with an alarm to warn about other ships. I'd also choose to take crew, because exhaustion can be a killer. These are all based on my individual tolerance for risk and my experiences with comfort on long passages.  Once you get there, how do you plan to get back? That's the harder trip to my understanding, and it usually requires waiting for late summer to lessen the chance of storms off the PNW. If you haven't read Jimmy Cornell's World Cruising Routes, I'd recommend you check it out. Also, forums like sailnet and cruisersforum are populated with old salts who have done this trip.

Or even move to the Pacific NW and buy a boat, then you can skip all that Panama Canal stuff...  Lake Travis ain't no ocean."

My only suggestion is that you can leave sooner if you crew on someone else's boat. The idea is nice to solo sail,  but the reality is mucho $$$.   Pm me if you want a boat to do Mexico to Hawaii.

sailing,3b3186,kriotas,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:43:48 2015 UTC,"Yes I have a Monitor windvane on mine. It works great. The windvane is essential but so is a tiller pilot. That's the problem, for a boat that big with a tiller the tiller pilot doesn't work well in bad weather. The tiller is tough downwind when steering by hand and you got a large following sea. The windvane works great for that but if there's no wind and big waves then it sucks."
sailing,3b3186,csmithers,1 point,Thu Jun 25 23:30:45 2015 UTC,"For a time I was working on a tiller leverage system for my electric pilot that would work like a sideways teeter totter and increase the force of the pilot by pushing at the tip of the tiller. My 30ft fin keel boat with a tiller had much the same problem where following waves spanked it too hard. Gave up on the design after an initial test because I sold that boat, but I think it would have worked after I flipped the orientation setting of the pilot."
sailing,3b3186,bigfig,1 point,Fri Jun 26 00:21:55 2015 UTC,You can set up the tiller pilot to push and pull on the monitor windvane (instead of the vane itself).  The servo-paddle will then multiply the force of the tiller pilot.

sailing,3b3m87,audentis,3,Thu Jun 25 18:45:06 2015 UTC,"If you have to get it undone(halyard, afternoon dock line, anchor) a great way to finish a cleat off is by taking a turn or two around the base of the cleat.

So many people don't understand the fact that it is not only important that you tie the line to the cleat securely, but also that you tie it in such a way that it can be loosened quickly when you need.  The best way to learn this fact is to single-handedly leave the dock in a breeze.  That's when you realize that the idiot (possibly yourself) that thought he was so smart by making locking turns three times on the cleat is now responsible for your boat yawing out of control off the dock when you are struggling with the stern line after spending a minute each on the bow and spring.  The right way to tie a cleat is: once around the base, criss, cross, lock. If you do it well, it never gets stronger than this, only more complicated to undo."

It seems like if you tied one this way, the standing end loading and unloading would cause chafe at the point where it ""touches itself"" before being cleated. Whereas in a properly tied cleat hitch (the first picture) the line doesn't rub against itself when the standing end moves."
sailing,3b3m87,synalx,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:59:48 2015 UTC,"Cool, so to summarize the article - it depends, most of the time not necessary, can be an alternative to more turns for slippery/small lines but requires caution to undo under load.  Personally, I'll stick to the normal way of tying it."
sailing,3b3m87,synalx,-2,Thu Jun 25 23:08:12 2015 UTC,"Always take a full turn around the cleat followed by as many crossing turns as you like.  With enough crossing turns you don't even need a hitch (it was even considered very bad form to hitch it back in the belaying pin square rigger days) but it's generally considered good practice these days to include one with todays lines.  However, if that hitch was ever found to have drawn tight you probably dont have line sized appropriately to the cleat and probably should have had another crossing turn.  Side note - line to cleat proportions is 1/16th of line diameter to 1 inch of cleat so a 6"" cleat takes 3/8"" line.  I realize that has nothing to do with your question but I thought I'd share anyway."

sailing,3b1mqb,paranoidinfidel,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:40:26 2015 UTC,It's been a long time since I used an RV head. However boat heads are designed to be exceedingly efficient as you have an rather limited supply of water to use. I'd imagine RVs would have a similar issue. That's not to say that I haven't been on (larger) boats that have an automatic flushing toilet but I hear they tend to be expensive and wasteful.

I have traveled to the Caribbean the past few years on and off, and over time and after being on enough boats, I was like ""hey, I should learn to sail,"" and thus began the process of doing exactly that.  For me, in coastal Texas, finding an ASA school was easy enough, and I've already completed my 101. I had a great time on the water actually working the sheets and tiller. I'll be back on the water doing it some more in a few weeks.  Try to find a class, and as others have suggested, a club that you can volunteer to crew with. Sometimes the schools have clubs, so you'll get to sail with your instructors for free after class."

If there's no learn-to-sail see if you can get an associate membership with a club that does regular races.  Show up to the social events and beg some skipper to let you on their crew.

A little while later, I bought my own Sunfish (used) and started taking it out on my own. It's very basic sailing, but it's still sailing - I got out on the water and got a chance to experience the joy of harnessing the wind, and that was all it took to fall in love with the experience."

(My own re-post) Want to sail for FREE? Here's how... You check your local sailing mag for race days in your area (Here in SF we have Latitude 38, brilliant rag...). Dress in layers and go down to your Marina/Yacht Club with a cardboard sign that reads, ""RAILMEAT FOR HIRE"" or ""WILL SAIL FOR FOOD""... seriously, I mean this... This is literally how I got into the sport and I've had a blast ever since... See, these guys that get the big boats NEED people to run them. It's a challenge racing a 40ftr. single handed! Even if you're a Noob we always need weight on the rail, makes the boat go faster! Be honest with your Skipper about how much experience you have in sailing and he'll put you in the right spot on board. My first few times out I was the Beer Man / Rail Meat... still had the time of my life. As a beginner you need to listen to all the more experienced sailors on board, don't be afraid to ask stupid questions, learn to tie a bowline and above all... DON'T FALL OFF THE BOAT! Also try to have a thick skin as some Skippers can be rather loud when giving orders. Don't take it personal, it is what it is... If you find yourself getting seasick do not be afraid or embarrassed to hurl, we've ALL done it and you usually feel tons better afterward. I cannot stress the importance of a PFD. That would probably be the most costly part of your gear for right now (a good one is around $120 - $150) but it is a MUST HAVE and you need to get in the habit of wearing it ALL THE TIME. Sea water is really cold and wet clothes are really heavy, not good for your health at all. I've got more tips but not enough time for now... Best of luck to you!!"
sailing,3b3eop,Guygan,1 point,Fri Jun 26 04:05:46 2015 UTC,"You said you live in Philly. Lived southern NJ across river for 17 years, moved to San Diego 3 years ago. Here's places I used/know about:   Across the bridge: Cooper River Yacht Club (NJ) - Small Boats on a lake, weekly racing, with member ship you get classes and access to small boats (Sunfish, Laser etc) very nice park setting.  And you can store your boat there.  They have women only sail races on Sunfish boats on some nights. Weekends they have other types of small boat sailing. They also periodically go to the shore and visit some other yacht club for a big 'at the shore sailing' trip. (Been 3 to 4  years since I was there, things may have changed) At the River: Liberty Sailing Club / School (near the ben franklin bridge) You learn to sail with heavy river current - Large Keel boats, last time I visited the boats where beat up did not like the river current. NJ On the river: Riverton Yacht Club - On the river, you must deal with strong river current. PA Rental Boats: Marsh Creek Lake Boat Rental (east, past King Of Prussia) small boats on a lake at state park - rent by the hour. Sunfish and giant 2 person plastic root-mold trimarans, no real classes but you can act like an idiot and have a lot of fun and have a picnic at a really nice park. They also have other paddle boats. Super Highly Recommended:  Contact ""Nelson Marine Basin"" Big Keel boats -in Toms River area. They are in Island Heights, and ask about sailing schools - The Nelson Sailing Center was hit very hard by Sandy - I don't know if they survived or not [I moved from NJ to CA 3 years ago, I rented from them for +8 years, everything from 22ft to 38ft keel boats] Jenny Nelson who ran the place is fantastic. Great classes, easy access to a great area to go sailing for the day. NJ Sailing School (Brick NJ) keel boats on small superbusy* river area.

Honestly, I have no experience with any type of boating (meaning that I've been allowed to ""drive"" but have never done anything more extensive).  I've been out on a few outboards for fishing and have enjoyed it.  Sailing is something that I've always wanted to learn about and try, but just have never known where to start.   So sorry if I seem overly ambitious and extremely naive."
sailing,3b3eop,strolls,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:18:30 2015 UTC,"Start off with a sailing school, there is nothing better than the introduction in a practical sense.  Plus you won't have the habit of thinking you know what you don't know by having read a bunch of stuff that a beginner doesn't really need to know.  Sailing is very simple to learn, yet takes a lifetime to master.  Check out the following web sites: http://www.ussailing.org, this is the site for US Sailing, which is the  national governing body for sailing in the US.  Also the American Sailing Association, which is a competing organization, http://www.asa.com  I went with US Sailing instead of ASA because the school in my area was a lot better IMO and because there seems to be more credibility with the certifications that US Sailing offers being recognized by charter companies.  Look for a class where the introduction is about 10 hours over 2 days, that pace gives you plenty of practice and also gives you that second day when you've processed what you learn in the first day.  I am just about to finish my second course, basic keelboat, I have 10 hours to go this weekend.  This will be my 30th hour on the water in a little more than a month.  I had no experience before that.  At this point I feel confident enough to take out a small boat (22' daysailor) in conditions of 5-15 knots at high or low tide.  I can handle the boat by myself and perform all of the basic maneuvers.  So I guess if you take my experience for an example that is what you could expect."

For instance, long distance racing in the Gulf of Mexico versus Long Island Sound wouldn't have the need for the same kind of boot.  If you're more in the north, an actual sea boot would be a worthwhile investment. I personally use the Dubarry Ultima, and my feet have never been wet or cold; that includes into the Atlantic in December. Dubarry offers a couple other boots, and a lot of the guys I sail with use a boot from Dubarry; no one has any complaints.   Zhik also offer seaboots, and one of the guys I sail with loves them. They're more of a sneaker than a boot, so they're not as cumbersome, and he says they still keep his feet warm.  Musto and Henri-Lloyd are two other well known offshore suppliers with boots, however I don't have any personal experience with them.  Offshore Boots  1.Dubarry  2.Zhik  3.Musto  4.Henri-Lloyd  As for dinghy sailing, Gill and Zhik have a couple choices, depending on what you're looking for. Musto offers some lighter options for dinghy's as well; they're more of a warm weather deck shoe than anything. Which, again, if you're sailing in warmer weather is probably all you need.  I personally use the Trapeze Boots from Gill, however they are a little thick; so if you're sailing in warm water and weather, your feet are gonna be warm.

It has a ton of weather helm and drives the bow down in heavy wind, so it makes me think the mast is too far forwards or the sail is rigged a bit off.

You're correct that you should move the halyard up the yard some. You can also move the gooseneck back on the boom; this will move the sail forward, which will reduce the weather helm in heavy air. That's a long boom and the Sunfish has the worst rudder in the world, so they have to tweak it to keep from overwhelming the rudder in any kind of wind.  Since you're not class racing, an easy answer to weather helm is to make a slightly bigger/deeper rudder."

Assuming the weather's warm - capsize drills are fun and teach an important skill.  I wouldn't do that on colder days.  Pair up the boats and make them sail circles around each other.  Lots of tacking and gybing.  Try having them sail the boat standing up windsurfer style to work on balance.  From the chase boat, throw floating sponge balls or tennis balls at random places in the water and have them collect as many as they can.  Let them have squirt gun water fights - they need to maneuver for position, and control the boat while working the water gun.  At the end of the day, the guy who has his gear packed up neatly gets first choice of boats for the following day.  Second guy gets second pick, and so on.  You get veto power on anything that's not ship-shape enough - and that person goes to the back of the line.  Have them pair up and switch boats on the water.  Or a competition where the person who switches boats the most times in five minutes wins.  (You can only switch with any other skipper once.)  These things are supposed to be fairly tough right?  ""Flag football"" sailing?  Each boat gets two streamers taped to the transom and other boats try and get close enough to steal them.  Not so sure about this one, since it might lead to more collisions as one boat's trying to get to another boat that's trying to get away - as opposed to the switch boat drill where they're trying to cooperatively get together...  Try to sail without rudders (this is a light air drill)  You get the idea - fun frivolous stuff.  I'm sure you'll think of refinements and more ideas."

sailing,3b16fu,4d2,3,Thu Jun 25 18:33:31 2015 UTC,"I tend to follow a progressive approach where I build sailors up to sailing on a race course. I teach optimists so I start them off on a figure 8 course, tacking back and forth around two buoys perpendicular to the wind, then switch it up by introducing gybing with a ""hot dog"" course (same two buoys, but now it's one tack and one gybe vs two tacks).  I introduce a third mark in the middle and gradually move it upwind so they start to learn upwind sailing. From there they progress to a proper triangle course with an upwind mark and a reach mark and then I teach them a starting line. From there it's all racing, rudder less sailing, backwards sailing, Chinese fire drills, and physical training.   I think that about covers it. If you want more ideas I'd be happy to help."

sailing,3b16fu,Firebar,1 point,Thu Jun 25 13:04:15 2015 UTC,See how tightly and quickly they can do circles around a buoy. This is a good drill for making tacking and gybing an instinctive action rather than something they have to think about each time.  A more advanced drill is to have two buoys and make everyone run figure eights around the two. It's a good for handling in tight conditions and learning right of way. Of course it can go horribly wrong and end with boats colliding so this is more of an advanced beginner drill.

sailing,3axwc2,ijon_cbo,2,Wed Jun 24 11:28:49 2015 UTC,Any docking maneuver looks like a good idea when its dead calm out.  Different story when there is 10 knots pushing on the outboard side.
sailing,3axwc2,knowledgewhore,1 point,Wed Jun 24 23:07:40 2015 UTC,"I just finished a book on docking after having a rough time docking in some 15-20 knot winds. I am learning to use the wind better to help me dock, but definitely agree, if the wind is pushing you directly into the dock at exactly a 90-degree angle, it's pretty tough - more often than not it is a little bit of an angle, though, and you can try to use that to your advantage."

sailing,3axwc2,hvyhitter,2,Wed Jun 24 15:24:43 2015 UTC,oh Im just trying to think of how to make a line that holds enough when I am motoring away and then releases quickly and cleanly when I have hit that point at where I am clear of obstacles and underway is all. Im learning and trying new things videos like this are helpful so when I practice I have something to try.

sailing,3axwc2,hvyhitter,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:27:14 2015 UTC,Yeah i havent done this yet.. my dock is leeward and the wind is usually off my bow. I have an end slip and trying to figure out how to back out and then turn to port is my thing. Ive got a high freeboard boat and the wind really does a number on me. It is confidence really. I havent hit anything yet even remotely. I know spring lines around the cleat at the stern are the way for me to spring around the dock. Your post is actually getting me to think about how to do it. perhaps if i use an Aft spring line and do the loop around the stern most dock cleat.. I am wondeing if I cannot just reverse and back up into the main channel then from there motor away. That is something to try.   Thanks for the post to inspire ideas.
sailing,3axwc2,Ynot_pm_dem_boobies,2,Thu Jun 25 10:08:37 2015 UTC,"A couple big bumpers and some practice, you'll look like a pro. I found a great technique to dock my 30 footer easily by myself. Hooked a long line on my aft cleat and ran it in front of my forward stay (balance point on other boats may be different, I experimented) then outside of lifelines back to Stern this is all to port, but whichever side you dock to works. As I come into the slip, when I get to the dock I loop the line around either a cleat or piling (the one you would usually tie your Stern line to) I then bring it back and secure it to the aft cleat. I put my boat in forward gear at idle, and because of where the lines are secured, she lays her port side against the dock where I can calmly hop off and secure my lines, then hop on drop her in neutral and cut the engine. Looks bad ass, at least feels it. Note: if there is a cleat in the right location mid ship, you could start with a line there as opposed to starting in the stern and looping around something."
sailing,3axwc2,hvyhitter,1 point,Thu Jun 25 12:13:01 2015 UTC,oh I htink you are the guy that told me this method.. I am using this all the time. People ARE amazed too. The guy that told me said he got it from a Tugboat captain.   Double spring line is what I call it!
sailing,3axwc2,hvyhitter,3,Thu Jun 25 15:33:38 2015 UTC,"as /u/Ynot_pm_dem_boobies pointed out. this technique is called ""on slip"". you can also choose two different cleats on board your vessel.   might not work on dockside cleats that are very full, but in that case just look for anything else to wrap around, like one of the bollards, that the dock is mounted on, or any poles (light, power..) on the dock.   This is also very useful for motoring out of a box, when you are moured bow-to-dock. just put a long line on slip around the cleat on the dock to your windward side, and then have one crewmember slipping that line in hand, so in a sidewind-situation you have an additional line, with which you can pull your boat straight (correcting for sidewind) in the box while motoring slowly out.   when motoring slowly, you have less control over the boat and its direction, esepcially backwards with the wheel-effect, and if you dont have a bow-thruster, you can align your boat with this while motoring out of the box to avoid touching anything."

Only frustrating thing is leaving the dock line behind and trailing off the dock, just as was done in the video.

If solar, use a proper MPPT regulator. Same idea.  Shore power problem is the opposite.  NO ferro-resonant (""analog"" ) chargers if you are plugged in for long periods of time.

sailing,3ayma6,Captn_Aubrey,2,Wed Jun 24 17:24:40 2015 UTC,I've been looking at charter trips for next year all week. Would you recommend who you went through?
sailing,3ayma6,jeffrife,2,Wed Jun 24 17:25:06 2015 UTC,"We went through Sail Caribe. It's really your only option in the SVIs although we did run into one Conch Charter boat in Vieques.  While the staff was very friendly and knowledgeable about the area, the boats did have some issues. I plan to do an entire post about it, but here's a few highlights:  Our dinghy stopped starting the first day. The captain on call suggested we dump the water trap in the fuel filter. It started after that but ran like shit the rest of the week. It made for a real headache, and if we hadn't had two other boats with working dinghies with us, we would have insisted they either come fix it or replace it.   The air-conditioner in our salon was dumping condensation down the stairs like a waterfall before we even left the marina. The charter reps were like, yeah, we know, but we don't have a replacement drain pump. It had obviously been doing it for a very long time because the wood was completely rotted out on that corner of the couch where it was leaking. When that compartment flooded the second night it shorted the breaker on all of the AC units, so we switched that breaker off and just ran the cabin AC units the rest of the trip.  One of the front hatches was glued shut because it leaked everywhere.  The electric winch for the main sheet would stick on in high mode.  The electric windlass stuck on while dropping chain. I finally pressed up in hopes it would stop, and it popped the breaker.   Either we picked up A LOT of seaweed in two days or nobody cleaned the strainers before we left the dock because we had to clean both an AC strainer and an engine strainer.  The glass sliding door in the companionway didn't latch, which made it impossible to lock the boat.   But at least we had it better than the crew on the Lagoon 450 who had a leaky water tank and lost half their drinking water. Their generator water pump was also leaking like a sieve, which caused their bilge alarm to go off about every ten minutes and their generator to kick off about every 30 minutes.  I'm waiting on feedback from the crew of the Jenneau as to what, if anything was broken on their boat."

With only your main your boat will want to steer into the wind.   With only your jib your boat wil want to steer away from the wind.   So reef both your sail and your jib for the best sailing experience.   Also try steering with your sails one time. Let go of your rudder and tighten on loosen your mainsheet. Or tighten or loosen your jibsheet. Try backing your jib (tighten your jibsheet in the ""wrong"" side). And just see amd feel what happens  Sorry if there are some weird words here.

sailing,3axb00,strolls,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:06:58 2015 UTC,"Actually, letting it swing freely makes for a great indicator of what your boat is doing.  The goal is to get the boat sailing straight with the unattended rudder amidships.    Pull in the main, watch the tiller swing down (bow moves up).  Ease the main, tiller up (bow down).  Vice versa for the jib.  This is insanely obvious in a boat like a J24 - in fact the sails have much more authority over the steering than the tiller does."

sailing,3axb00,fragglerock,3,Thu Jun 25 10:15:58 2015 UTC,"I'm also in SF. My progression is main + jib, reef the main, reef again, then furl the jib. I have a J/30 though, which sails well under just the mainsail. I've crossed the slot in 40 knots with a double-reefed main (eased way out to spill off a lot of air at the top).  I try to avoid sailing with just the jib up in heavy air. It seriously messes up the boat balance and it's dangerous because it's always trying to push the boat down - I prefer a bit of weather helm so the boat rounds up if it's overcome by a gust or anything."

sailing,3axb00,mypantsareonmyhead,1 point,Wed Jun 24 07:24:30 2015 UTC,"this is absolutely spot on. Many people furl the jib and keep the main up, when in some boats you get better balance with the main down and only the jib up. I know for the Atlantic class that I sail in that the main is so large, and not able to be reefed that the preference it to sail with jib only."
sailing,3axb00,fprintf,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:58:04 2015 UTC,"It really depends on the boat, a modern cruiser will sail better under main only because the jibs are smaller so the rig is set up to drive from the main.  I have an older boat with a very large overlapping Genoa. Its on a roller furler so if its a bit windy and I'm feeling lazy ill just use the Genoa. It sails beautifully as it was designed to have a big Genoa so drives off that most of the time.  Try different set ups and find the feel for your boat, they do sail differently on different courses with different sail combinations so its up to you to work it out."
sailing,3axb00,monkfish24,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:24:50 2015 UTC,"It depends on the boat.  My 27' Starwind sailed pretty well with only the main, but if I tried to go jib only, the wind would push the nose around way too much.  On the Oday 34 we can go jib only from a broad reach through a run, but never really sail with only the main.  Using both with the appropriate reefing is probably best."
sailing,3axb00,JETEXAS,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:50:54 2015 UTC,"As others have said, it all depends.  Downwind, the boat will be more stable with headsails only.  Upwind, you want to find a balance that results in about 5-10 degrees of weather helm (never lee helm).  This means that there's a few degrees of rudder required to keep the boat from pointing further into the wind.  Some weather helm increases the lift to windward and ensures that a gust will round the boat up.  Lee helm can be dangerous as the boat will bear off in a gust and get laid down broadside to the wind."
sailing,3axb00,kriotas,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:14:29 2015 UTC,"We usually go in this order as the wind increases (someone correct me if I'm wrong):  Full Main, 155% Jib Reef Main, 155% Jib Full Main, 105% Jib Reef Main, 105% Jib   But we don't get much chop or winds that high on our inland lake."
sailing,3axb00,SolusLoqui,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:29:09 2015 UTC,"Jib only is typically a bad idea - keeps you from balancing your boat and it can leave you dangerously out of control.  Always raise the main first, jib second, and drop them in reverse order (jib first, main second).    Your main alone makes your boat act alike a wind vane and makes your boat want to weathercock to irons (point into the wind). Your foresail is out at the bow of the boat and it wants to push your bow away from the wind and run down.  A balanced boat is when you get these forces in perfect opposition and the boat sails a straight line with no rudder inputs.    Depending on design, a boat without a jib will be very slow to tack.  This is because as you swing through the tack, the jib on the new side will power up and push the bow down and through the turn.  Without it, your boat can wallow in irons for some time, possibly even failing to tack."
sailing,3axb00,cyancynic,2,Wed Jun 24 19:40:10 2015 UTC,"It depends on the boat and the sail plan. The boat that I race on sails in very overpowered conditions best with jib only. So your advice that jib only is typically a bad idea is not necessarily correct - I'm even trying to qualify it with your ""typically"" statement, because I've never seen anything that would make that true for most of the boats I've sailed on. Generally speaking most boats will sail better with the main only, and they will tack just fine because the main causes the boat to round into the wind. Just don't be lazy about tacking or you'll get into irons and then it is difficult to get out of them."
sailing,3axb00,fprintf,1 point,Wed Jun 24 23:00:33 2015 UTC,"I would guess that the boat you race on isn't really what I would call 'typical' (what is it?) and lacking boat type info - I went with what works on my very traditional boat.  And, of course, head sails alone when on a long mid ocean run under stable conditions just make keeping the boat running easier - no surprise jibing or anything like that."
sailing,3axb00,cyancynic,1 point,Wed Jun 24 23:12:45 2015 UTC,"Sailing on one sail only can be a pain in the ass and I would dare to say even dangerous when you need good maneuverability.   Of course main only gives good control at upwind angles, but in older boats mains were a bit smaller so you lose a lot of horsepower. Sailing genoa only gives you less control on upwing angles and more on downwind angles.   So  1) If you need to move quickly out of the way (changing direction, accelerating, stopping suddenly), you need two sails. If you want to have a balanced helm, use both sails.   2) If you are lazy and your journey is mostly On reaching to beating angles, use main.   3) If you are lazy and your trip is mostly reaching to downwind, use the genoa.   Same applies for sailing in constricted spaces when you have lost your engine."

sailing,3au75l,FluffyBunnyHugs,7,Tue Jun 23 15:40:53 2015 UTC,"there are few things more satisfying than sailing upwind against a tide through moored boats, finely to the docks, dropping the sails at just the right time, and turning a 27ft boat into your slip with barely a walking momentum.... so that you simply step off the boat, and take your time to throw down the lines, as the boat just comes to a stop before the lines have a chance to hold it, and before the wind takes it back.   Docking under sail is one of my most favorite things to do. Of course a lot of harbors are terrified and think your motor must be broken.."

They meet the needs of how a lot of folks use their boats: reasonably priced daysailing and weekending boats with a lot of space to entertain and stretch out when you're overnighting.  They're set up with white sails because most folks never feel a need or desire to set a spinnaker.  They might be a little more tender than some other designs with a deeper keel or more weight at the end of a bulb - but any boat can be overcanvased in a blow and a prudent sailor knows when to reef.  Go with the boat that appeals to you - don't be scared off by ""internet wisdom."""

sailing,3avhos,vuanvan,7,Tue Jun 23 20:53:56 2015 UTC,"Oh my first ELI5. All modern commercial and recreational boats, from the late 70's on have to be certified with max stability ratio. There is a stability curve that diminishes as you heel to a degree of angle and then a curve called a vanishing angle of stability once the boat has exceeded the max stability ratio. Think of a circle with 360 degree marks. As the boat rests in calm seas it is at 0 degrees. Different countries use different methods. This is a generality and you can ask ABYC to supply you with the information for your particular boat model (production boats).   A Typical Powerboat will peak at a Max Stability Ratio of around 50-55 degrees. A sailboat (keel dependent) will peak out around 65-70 degrees. Now the tricky part there is in most cases with a sailboat it is not the boat design that makes the boat ""turn turtle"" but the sails aloft that act as a sea anchor to turn the boat over after filling with water.  But the one thing a powerboat does not have is a self righting option when it reaches the vanishing point of stability. That is where the deep keel will be pushed by the waves or gravity to self right the boat. A sailboat can still act against the vanishing angle at 130 -140 degrees and right the boat.   The other part is the boat construction. Now I know many power boaters will disagree but, most coastal cruising and ocean cruising sailboat are designed with more structural integrity via thicker hull, glassed in bulkheads, lower freeboard (space above the water) low cabin overhead. Power boats (non commercial) are not typically designed for ocean going where you would most likely encounter a large enough storm.   That being said, A 70 foot powerboat yacht would most likely be made to cross oceans just as well as a 70 foot sailboat. The 70 foot powerboat will be faster to outrun any potential foul weather and the sailboat would certainly be more adapt at being able to handle/ manage a large storm condition.   Hope that helps.   Edit: spelling. Me spell pretty."

sailing,3avhos,mayoriguana,2,Tue Jun 23 21:09:57 2015 UTC,"Think about the geometry of both boats.  Motor boats have shallow, smooth bottoms that plane out of the water to reduce drag when the boat is under power.  Not so great for stability when the boat isnt moving.  Sailboats generally have a keel under the boat that is extremely heavy and deep.  This prevents the boat from getting pushed over when the sails are up, but will also serve as a righting force to keep the deck pointed upwards in stormy weather."

sailing,3avhos,tkaraszewski,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:56:20 2015 UTC,"Aren't many motor boats planing hull boats? I would think a sailboat is a better bet to survive in a storm than a motor boat.  Given a displacement hull of a sailboat, you have a chance of the boat righting itself if it capsizes.  In a motorboat if the hull gets swamped it might just sink. A lot of sailboats can still float if they get full."

sailing,3av9p8,Firebar,2,Wed Jun 24 00:22:20 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure the question is about how the sails should be stored, but about the subconscious effect upon buyers.  I think that maybe if the sails are ready to go then it makes buyers looking at a boat think of the boat as ready to go in a positive way.  If the sails are put away properly then maybe it has subliminal negative effect upon potential buyers, making them think of the boat as not ready to go.  Maybe I'm overthinking it, but in sales and marketing there are all sorts of ways that consumers behave in ways that most of us wouldn't expect. Maybe the broker has good reason."
sailing,3av9p8,strolls,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:49:58 2015 UTC,"For me personally I'd rather see sails stored how they should be stored, unless I'm well aware that a boat is in regular use. Same with waterlines, I'd like to see a clean hull on a boat I look at. They're little things that shows that it's been cared for"

sailing,3av9p8,SkiBigLines,1 point,Wed Jun 24 00:56:08 2015 UTC,"One design: off, all others: on and likely hoisted. But depends on what I'm buying the boat for. J24 advertised with a brand new suit? Let's see them in a bag, as long ad they've got buttons they're good. 30yo Catalina with multiple recent owners? I want to see the sails aloft and set to see if they're cut 6 feet short (it happens) and the price needs to be taken down.   All this being said, you can be damn sure I'm gonna crawl into every inaccesible crevice in a boat imw going to buy, as well as inspecting all the necessary gear (safety, nav, anchor, rig, sails) before I buy it.   Sails on and harbour stowed makes it look more like a sailboat though."

Oh absolutely, no question of that.  I'm assuming the hypothetical boat would be surveyed, sea trial, and all of that so ultimately you'd see the sails on and in use.  I was just curious about first impressions."
sailing,3av9p8,enuct,2,Tue Jun 23 20:18:14 2015 UTC,"First impressions wise, I would have my boat polished, with the sails harbour stowed and covers on, as usually that looks better, and more ""sailboat-ey"""
sailing,3av9p8,SkiMonkey98,2,Tue Jun 23 20:48:33 2015 UTC,a boat that the owner takes the time to wax every year is usually pretty well taken care of in terms of maintenance. If the boat is oxidized I imagine there are probably other things the person skipped as well.

sailing,3av9p8,JETEXAS,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:53:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I should have been more clear initially.  The assumption is that the sails are correct for the boat and that the boat would be sea trialed prior to purchase so the sails would be seen and even used.  I like them off because:   They can be rolled out and inspected on the ground. Exposure to UV has been kept to a minimum (wont have to get the sacrificial cover on the furler restitched, etc.) Functional parts on the boom can be easily evaluated (outhaul, reef lines, etc.) Indicates that the owner is taking care of everything (providee that that's the reason the sails are off and not because they are hiding anything)   The general consensus seems to be sails on though."
sailing,3av9p8,robi2106,2,Wed Jun 24 17:31:54 2015 UTC,I guess I'm just not used to buying boats nice enough for all the inspections and sea trials. When I bought my first one it came with five sails in bags -- only two of them fit the boat.

sailing,3ates6,guzzti,1 point,Tue Jun 23 10:46:41 2015 UTC,"Hello !  I can't help you with the ""how to find a crew"", but maybe you should have a look/ask on /r/sailingcrew ?  About the equipment, do you have all the security equipment as well (inflatable liferaft,  flares, etc.) ? And, in case of electronic equipment failure, do you have the maps of the various regions you'll pass by as well as some navigation instruments ? You should have the maps of the streams too, that can be quite strong around England ! I consider these as a must-have...  As for anchoring techniques, and more generally sailing techniques, I consider this as my bible, but then again the french version is update regularly while this one is now 20 years old and will not talk about GPS (which are useful when you anchor to know whether you're moving or not) for example... The main thing is to be sure that the tide will not be too low at some point, to leave 2~3 times the max depth of line, not to stack it up while lowering it (so keep moving backward) and to aim for safe bottom (sand, sludge, avoid slippery bottom, and rock so that your anchor does not get stuck).  I hope this will help, but I'm also looking for other answers as I am thinking about a long trip too !"
sailing,3ates6,artymort,1 point,Tue Jun 23 13:25:58 2015 UTC,"Thank you, will pick up the book at first chance.  I have all the basic equipment - dinghy, flares, harness etc.  The only equipment (I think) I lack is a radar. Im buying a radar reflector soon, but haven't figured out if I should buy my own radar yet.  Maps are also on my list, if anybody have good tips on where to get good free ones (or good but not pricy ones) I'm grateful for pointing me in the direction.  Where are you based and thinking about heading?"
sailing,3ates6,simple2fast,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:11:09 2015 UTC,"With AIS and a chart plotter, I feel that radar's advantages have gone way down.   That said, radar doesn't require the other vessels and/or the charts to be both functional and accurate.  WRT safety equipment (flares, rafts,etc ).  Check the dates!!!!  I would consider an AIS transceiver ( meaning transmit as well as receive ).  Checkout all the traffic in your area:  http://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/home/centerx:9/centery:64/zoom:9"
sailing,3ates6,Ynot_pm_dem_boobies,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:05:38 2015 UTC,"Nice, I was thinking that radar wasn't as necessary as my old man is saying.  All safety equipment is bought, and reserves are budgeted for. Do you have any experienced with safety harnesses vs. A climbing harness?"
sailing,3ates6,Ynot_pm_dem_boobies,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:09:29 2015 UTC,"I only used my radar a couple times when I cruised my sailboat, that being said it was an add on to my simrad Chartplotter, and was fantastic when I used it. There was definitely an extra feeling of security with it. For spending that much time on board invest in a good battery bank, I love 6v golf cart batteries, and a source of renewable energy, solar, wind, or even better both."
sailing,3ates6,masgrada,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:42:25 2015 UTC,"Any recommendations on solar panels? I have been looking at some, but most seem like dubious stuff from china that will break, scratch or crack quickly."
sailing,3ates6,masgrada,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:18:16 2015 UTC,"I have a pair of 100 Watt Renogy I believe that I bought off Amazon. Mine are mounted hanging off the rails around my Stern pulpit.  They seem sturdy enough  no matter what you have to be careful. I would like a larger boat next where I could put an arch over the cockpit to mount to. So with 200 watts solar through a 30amp controller I was very happy, it was a package off Amazon or eBay. I am in the US so I can't speak to availability for you. Just shop by reviews, and depending on  the amount of sun, I really like wind because it can generate 24 hours if the wind is blowing.  Do a Google search on sailboat power requirements, you can find tools to estimate how much power you need, basically: size of battery bank in amp hours - (amp hours used per piece of equipment ) (hours used per day) for all electronics + power generated from engine wind and or solar. Much better explanations written."
sailing,3ates6,simple2fast,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:36:27 2015 UTC,"Good point with the wind, but at a quick glance they seem a bit expensive.  Do you, or maybe /u/masgrada have any experience on how long the battery life is ""prolonged"" with solar panels? I really doubt I would need more power than for 5 days, so let's say 8 days for a nice buffer. Is it an alternative to just switch batteries and charge them up whenever I'm docked, and then let the solars prolong them, or is 200w solar enough?"
sailing,3ates6,theageofnow,2,Tue Jun 23 23:50:18 2015 UTC,"Really depends on quite a few factors. Mainly, how much electricity you use and how much the sun provides. It would be up to you to calculate that. Many rely solely on solar alone, so it's definitely feasible to prolong indefinitely."
sailing,3ates6,theageofnow,1 point,Wed Jun 24 00:28:53 2015 UTC,"I've been looking into this quite avidly as of recent. The best it seems is a super light weight flexible panel by Renology. They have great panel kits specifically for boats, 100-400watt. 200watt (2x100watt) would be the easiest to wire as it has one controller.   People seem to have put them through their paces and even dropped them overboard but keep on ticking. At 1/8 or less the weight of regular panels it's definitely the direction panels on boats are headed."
sailing,3ates6,theageofnow,1 point,Tue Jun 23 23:19:54 2015 UTC,I would buy a marine safety harness for all deck work. The tether point is such that if you have to get towed behind a boat you have a chance to keep your head above the water.  A climbing harness will have you being towed sideways through the water.  ugly.  For rig climbing I think a climbing harness is more appropriate. So probably both :-(

sailing,3as4jk,Quagers,1 point,Tue Jun 23 07:17:36 2015 UTC,"Pretty much this but if you're really struggling on the beat, you can raise the dagger board to reduce heeling force. You'll slip sideways but your boat will be more stable."
sailing,3as4jk,evlenler,4,Tue Jun 23 19:52:31 2015 UTC,"Remember your sail controls! You want a nice flat sail in heavy winds (basically you are bending the mast and boom into a shape more like the sail when laying flat. Don't forget what this does to your center of effort however! Tighten down, but keep the boat balanced. Also keep in mind the wave conditions. Cats tend to catch wind under the tramps and start to actually fly. What that means is you slam down into the water to a dead stop. That can be a bit of a shock to the crew when they find themselves suddenly looking DOWN at the top of the mast as they swing up on the trap and pitch pole the boat over on top of them (if they are lucky). So try and keep at least one hull in the water at all times. In the laser, when you start go to over, release the JIB to get yourself back up. Feathering the main will help, but what is pulling the boat over is the jib. Pop that and you should go back up assuming you aren't too far gone already.    On the safety side.  Never head out when people don't know you are out there and make sure you have a time to meet up with them to check in. If possible, make sure there is a rescue boat available and you take someone experienced in high winds with you on the boat. Wear GOOD life jackets (none of this blue and white or black shit.  You want a DOT approved life preserver) and, lastly, no drinking before getting on the boat. Alcohol and high winds mix even worse than drinking and boating usually does.  Lastly, have fun!  High wind sailing is a blast and there just isn't anything else like it out there."
sailing,3as4jk,pseud0nym,2,Tue Jun 23 16:05:47 2015 UTC,"Use your sail controls to depower the main And rig, hammer a bunch of boomvang on and play lots of mainsheet.

sailing,3as4jk,SkiBigLines,2,Tue Jun 23 09:54:12 2015 UTC,"Check this video out!  Keep the boat level. In strong winds (maybe 20 knots and more) when sailing upwind, you can't sail block-to-block. Hold your angle, and sheet out a little.  Your upwind angle is the speed, and sail is the power.  30 knots is hardcore. It's my fourth year sailing Laser Radial, male now, and it's the first year I could say I can handle winds of 20 to 30 knots.  (Sorry for my english)"
sailing,3as4jk,TheRealRube,0,Tue Jun 23 13:06:33 2015 UTC,"20kts is high winds? Oh man.. I have raced in up to 40 in my full rig laser and been out in as high as 50 (popped all the battons out of the sail when tacking and bent the boom into a pretzel). 20 for me is perfect ""medium wind"" sailing!

sailing,3as4jk,pseud0nym,2,Thu Jun 25 06:38:49 2015 UTC,"Probably depends on the sailor. And I'm not so good with knots, because I preferably use metre per second (m/s). My perfect conditions are 4-6m/s of wind with big waves!  There must be differences around the globe too. Not too much wind in Finland, compared to Australia for example."
sailing,3as4jk,TheRealRube,2,Tue Jun 23 16:40:33 2015 UTC,"Easy way to think of Knots. They are double of the wind speed in KM/Hr. So a 50kt wind is 100KM/Hr of wind speed. I actually have to convert into knots to get an idea of wind speed as that is the only way I really know to measure it.    It very much depends on the sailor.  I am long and lanky so I want a heavier medium wind that allows me to use my height and the my ability to get my weight outboard to its greatest advantage while still being not overly heavy (I am ""ideal"" weight and height for a laser at 6'2"" and 175lbs). If I was a big chesty guy, I would want very heavy winds where the extra weight outboard makes a big difference and isn't slowing down the boat. If I was a little guy, then I would be dreaming of light wind sailing where I just blow past the bigger guys whose weight is slowing the boat down.   I live in Alberta so am jealous of your sailing conditions. Inland. When we see thunderstorms we all head to the lake cause we know that is the only time it is going to blow like snot!  You get really good at tracking the storm cell to insure you aren't in the danger path of lightning.  Almost all our wind here is storm driven.  That is why the Alberta Sailing Team has ""Pray for Wind"" as their motto written on their booms. lol"

My advice, beyond cranking on the controls, is to hit the gym if you can! Quads, core and arms, especially arms.   One thing that helps me is to sheet with my knee. Hike off your back foot, pin the sheet to your forward knee and use your quad muscles to get those last couple of inches. Make sure your vang is fully cranked as well, so the load on the mainsheet is all side-to-side and you're not working to use the sheet to pull down too much on the boom. To do this, pinch up, oversheet the main, and crank on the vang while you're oversheeted.    Also, know your limits. If you get to a point where you know you won't be able to right the boat if you flip, it's time to head in."

Why do you think I only did it on an inland lake with rescue avalible, aware and ready to come and get me if shit went wrong? Had I not been a carded sailing team member, they would not have let me out on the lake at all as it was closed to the public due to the conditions.  The second time I was out in similar conditions was during a race and a line squall came up lake Diefenbaker at the Western Canadian 16 and unders, and most of the guys out had to abandon their boats out on the lake. Not sure what the exact wind speed was that day but the tops were blown off the waves and the lake was flat and white due to spume and spray.     That was an easy one to win!"

sailing,3as4jk,Quagers,-2,Tue Jun 23 20:33:19 2015 UTC,"""Screenshot"" lolololol! Sorry there kid, but it doesn't work that way. We didn't have webcams or digital cameras 20 some years ago nor would I have bothered to take the screenshot if I had. Probably the same reason I was training for the Olympics and you were not. I was out there for shits and giggles, not trying to make random people on the internet think my dick is big.    So, you are going to welch. Figures. I have provided you a method to easily confirm my statement with a phone call. Looks like your word isn't worth shit. Do you always welch when you lose a bet?"
sailing,3as4jk,pseud0nym,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:40:11 2015 UTC,"Wow, calm down, just making an observation that people exaggerate the shit out of wind on the internet, you included. Have a look on youtube, I see peoples laser videos claiming 35knts, even 40knts and most of those are exaggerated, but no one is even claiming 50knts. I don't care how much ""Olympic training"" you've had, 50knts will blow you on your arse with the sail fully eased, that or snap the top section, they are pure survival conditions.  Yeah I'm gonna send some random guy on the internet money because of the word of some other random guy. Don't get me wrong, I believe that you believe it was 50knts or even your mate.  You know nothing about me, so going down the personal insults route is a bit dumb. I've sat on a jury boat with an anemometer as an actual 50knt squall came a laser nationals fleet and flattened every boat, many of them on Olympic Campaigns. I've been in offshore races when 50knts have blown through shredding carbon fibre sails, I imagine the shit that laser sails are made of would last less than 5sec.   50knts is no joke."
sailing,3as4jk,fprintf,-1,Tue Jun 23 21:37:36 2015 UTC,"I am aware of people exaggerating.  They weren't sailing at Glenmore which is one of the only small lakes in the world to have a full time, on station life boat rescue service and weather monitoring station. I knew exactly what the conditions were that day.     I don't care how much ""Olympic training"" you've had, 50knts will blow you on your arse with the sail fully eased, that or snap the top section, they are pure survival conditions     Yes, they are survival conditions. No it will not ""snap the top section"" immediately (it can, but so can a much lighter blow). However, as I mentioned it does have a tendency to bend them quite markedly. Which is why I used an old sail and old spars when I did it.     Yeah I'm gonna send some random guy on the internet money because of the word of some other random guy.     You were the one offering the bet. I simply took it.  It is up to you not to welch on commitments you, yourself made.     You know nothing about me, so going down the personal insults route is a bit dumb.     You already went down that road or do you not think calling someone a liar is an insult? Get your head out of your ass.     I've sat on a jury boat with an anemometer as an actual 50knt squall came a laser nationals fleet and flattened every boat, many of them on Olympic Campaigns.     Oh, so you do know that people do sail in those conditions!  Nice of you to admit it. However, if you actually read about what I wrote I described what happened when conditions approaching those happened in a race situation. Glenmore is a very special and unique case or I would not have gone out in those conditions in the first place. I also prepared for them BEFORE I went out and wasn't sitting in a boat on a race course on the edge of what I can hold on to in order to go as fast as possible. I am not, for instance, generally going to stop, head into irons and then sit on the boom to really flatten the sails down in the middle of a race at that level.      I've been in offshore races when 50knts have blown through shredding carbon fibre sails, I imagine the shit that laser sails are made of would last less than 5sec.     ROTFL. You blow out the sail but you are going to need a HELL of a lot more wind than that to shred a laser sail. It did however blow out every batton on the sail when I tacked. Something you would actually know if you had bothered to actually read more than the first line.    So you are wrong. I do know something about you. You don't bother to actually read what people write in response to you.    If you don't want people to call you out, don't make stupid bets after insulting someone. If you play the game, don't bitch when you get hit back. If you don't want to be called a welch, don't make bets you don't intend to keep. It really is that simple.    This is, however, is the first time I have ever had a sailor welch on a bet. You are unique in that regard. Normally sailors can be taken at their word."
sailing,3as4jk,TheRealRube,2,Tue Jun 23 22:11:03 2015 UTC,"Or you could do like my skipper does when he sees it is windy outside the mouth of the harbor: ""that's it boys, too windy for me today, we're going back in""... the fuck?!?! I just drove an hour here to go sailing and you decide to pack it in, but only after I've lost a chance at a crew spot on another boat.   Seriously the best way to keep the boat from capsizing is to feather the boat into the wind in the puffs. So assuming you are going close hauled, let the boat round up into the wind a little bit so the sails just start to luff. This will depower things and keep the boat from heeling further. Of course if it is shifty or you take things too far you can cause yourself to tack, so be judicious in your feathering into the wind.   We often do this on our ridiculously overpowered Atlantic - meant for low wind conditions, when it is over 20 knots the thing is a beast, so in order to keep making way upwind you spill lots of air and still need to feather into the wind to keep the water from coming over the gunwales."
sailing,3as4jk,karates,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:56:41 2015 UTC,"When sailing single-handed Laser, its not so good idea to feather into the wind. It'll kill the speed, and you'll find yourself in irons. The right thing to do is maintain course, sheet out a little, and then sheet back in at the right moment.  Must be different on bigger boats with bigger sails and mass though.  Edit: Apparently I didn't read the question properly.. I thought she sailed the common Laser, but she said Laser 2"

sailing,3as4jk,fnordsnord,2,Tue Jun 23 17:05:43 2015 UTC,Going straight downwind while sailing a laser in high wind is pretty crazy.  The tiller is much more sensitive to what you do with it and the boat can start rocking violently

sailing,3aqiz4,sciencebum,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:01:23 2015 UTC,"Once, the Wednesday night race got honked at in the Duluth harbor, and the coasties came out to talk to the committee boat.  I don't think there was a ticket, and it probably helped that the committee boat was manned by a cute girl who did the talking.  I was almost close enough to overhear, and could see nothing physical was exchanged.  Another race I saw them come out and herd boats to the other side of the harbour for shipping traffic.   Other than that I might have seen them come out once or twice after a honking, but I don't know of any tickets, maybe just a stern talking to.  Same race the next year we were warned to stay away from shipping.    I'd bet if the coasties had anything else to grab on to like a DUI they'd take it.     I'd guess 1 in 10 or so honkings rouses the coasties.   Usually there is associated radio chatter, the freighter or the bridge will request them. It seems to have to do with the situation.     My worry is it is getting to be too much and there will be some sort of enforcement action in the future, but if getting honked at is fairly normal, then maybe there is no worry."

sailing,3aknth,aurora-73,5,Sun Jun 21 03:25:42 2015 UTC,"Looks like there's a handfull of issues there.  The reef tack shouldn't be pulled down per se.  Instead, it should be restrained both vertically and horizontally by hook or lines and then the halyard tensioned against it to get your luff tension.  No need to go to a winch like pictured.  That bottom most picture concerns me because you aren't getting a fair lead from the grommet.  You'll rip it right out of the sail that way.  Your reefed sail should look exactly the same as an unreefed sail.  No weird wrinkles."

sailing,3aknth,phaederus,1 point,Sun Jun 21 09:37:55 2015 UTC,"In the set ups I'm used to the tack grommet (cringle) is kept against the back of the mast and winds up above the other slugs, not hauled past them down to the boom. This allows halyard tension to be applied for a good reefed sail shape. The grommet also has to be on a hook or lashed against the back of the mast to resist the pull aft from the reefing line going through the reef clew. Both of these are important to get decent sail shape when reefed, you want it flat and the draft kept forward. Sailmakers usually put fewer slugs on the luff in this area so that the slug stack doesn't wind up too high and cause other problems."

But you must not have that slug higher than the reef luff tack point. That slug needs to be dropped out of the stack to make it work properly.  I repair these things for a living and can advise that if you're in fresh conditions and need to reef, you WILL come to grief with that set-up. And you don't want to tear sails in fresh conditions. It all goes really bad really quickly.  Can you send me some pics of the gooseneck itself? Looks like there are on stag horns there at all? There must be a better way..."
sailing,3aknth,texasrigger,2,Sun Jun 21 09:50:56 2015 UTC,Sailmakers usually put fewer slugs on the luff in this area so that the slug stack doesn't wind up too high and cause other problems.

sailing,3aknth,thrownshadows,1 point,Sun Jun 21 11:59:59 2015 UTC,Makes me wonder if perhaps you should remove those slugs from the track when reefing.
sailing,3aknth,SkiBigLines,1 point,Sun Jun 21 12:04:00 2015 UTC,"Quick solution would be to attach that slig with bungee instead of webbing, and run the tack line all on one side of the sail, instead of straddling the mast.   Every reefing system is different, get a local rigger or racer to take a look at it. I've been on my current ride for two months, 7000nm and we're still playing with the reef system..."
sailing,3aknth,hobbycollector,1 point,Sun Jun 21 16:34:29 2015 UTC,"One solution is to reef less. I realize the standard advice is to reef early and often, and certainly when the winds are above 30 that's solid advice. I don't get much of that around these parts, though I used to reef and go to the jib instead of genoa whenever I got white caps. After learning more about sail trim through racing, I pray for whitecaps now.   This whole spring I have not removed the genoa, nor reefed. One thing is to use the traveller properly. Bring it above the centerline to keep the boom centered over the boat in lighter winds (less than 15-20).   Then when puffs increase, you can sheet out the traveller while keeping the mainsheet hard. This keeps the main from luffing as quickly, as it is sheeted in tight, but rotated so it doesn't have as much heeling moment. It also closes the slot and keeps the sail flat.  Keep the vang tight in this case. After the puff, bring the traveller back windward.  Finally, in really strong winds you can let the genoa cars back astern, and ease the vang and the mainsheet while keeping the traveller to windward to some extent, all of which puts twist in the main/genoa. Twist takes the heeling force forward instead, in addition to accommodating the fact that winds aloft are a different direction than winds near the water."

I'd eschew the fiberglass cloth and go with an ever-so-slightly thinned out fiberglass resin poured straight into the crevice. Then C-clamp the two halves back together and let it set up good and hard.    If you look at the deck there area ton of bubbles. Is this delamination? How can I address this or should I not worry?    Yeeeeaaaaaa .... :/ that is technically delamination.... but I'd generally just refer to it as bubbling (large sections of two materials becoming unstuck from each other, that I might refer to as delamination.)  How flexible is it? Does it easily squash flat, to deck level? Or does it squash inward, below surface level (indicating subsurface rot?)   I'm of two minds for a solution:  You can try poking holes in opposite ends of the bubble and injecting fiberglass resin into it, then placing a heavy weight upon it until it sets. Effectively gluing the bubble back down and helping to preserve the deck surface, or,  You can cut out the bubble entirely and patch/fill the spot. But that might produce an overwhelming desire to paint the entire deck. Which introduces a whole host of aesthetics and future maintenance issues. :)"

You can then apply gel coat, if the repair wasn't structural. You can fix the bow delamination by injecting thickened epoxy. I use west systems and their additives. Use a large clamp and clamp the deck shut after applying epoxy (please make sure the hull is dried out before using bonding agents).  As far as the bubbles go, this is an old boat, and it's not worth the trouble of peeling everything back. If you want to address it, drill a small hole into the bubble (don't go through the hull!!) And see if water comes out. If it does, buy another boat. If you don't want to do that, there are good YouTube tutorials to show you how to fix gel coat blisters"

Absolutely chip away that Bondo, and then take a Dremel and sand the edges with a rough bit around the damaged area so there aren't any sharp edges (think hill instead of cliff shape). You could do fiberglass, but I would just repair it with gel coat or marinetex. It's easier and it will look better, and then you can sand it smooth and repaint. If you feel the damage is structural (ie the hull bends there) then use the fiberglass.  As far as the deck separation, there isn't a ton you can do about that. You could try MarineTex and then clamp it. Fiberglass won't mold well to that shape, so you'll end up with bubbles around the crack and then it won't do you any good anyway..   I don't know what you could do with the bubbling. I've never seen that before. I wouldn't worry about it too much.  I'm a Laser racer, so if you need any more help or parts let me know.

sailing,3agqz8,hilomania,1 point,Sat Jun 20 06:13:51 2015 UTC,I've been sailing since I was 5. I capsized al the time on purpose. With my own children: first thing I taught them was how to recover from a capsize (We do this on each new boat. I actually ended up selling a boat because it was non-recoverable without outside intervention). When they had friends we always first did a capsize test so they wouldn't freak out if it happened. With this type of experience hot weather becomes an excuse to capsize. (So does waking your brother up!) I just put some life jackets on them and of they went on adventure. (And later with girls and nowadays with girls and beer.). They've made it so far...  I've rarely capsized my cats. I've pitch poled them a bunch of times. Hitting the stays can hurt. I use a righting pole and when not racing I carry a jug at the top of the mast.

If you are prone to sea sickness there are two positions you want to be in, on deck or horizontal in a bunk with eyes closed. And you want to minimise time spent between those positions.  Other than that it comes down to the person, I am fine during the day but will guarenteed throw up the first night of every trip, after that I'm 100% fine. Learn how it is for you and work around it, seasickness is an incredibly personal thing and everyone reacts differently. Personally I go heavy on the drugs (stugeron) for the first 48hrs of any trip and after that I'm fine."

sailing,3ag1y8,Quagers,3,Fri Jun 19 21:34:45 2015 UTC,"Stugeron is a UK brand name, the active ingredient is Cinnarizine, it might be called something else in the US. Main side effect is drowsiness but it varies by person, it's not that bad for me and actually helps me sleep when I'm off watch.  Sea sickness comes from confusion between the messages your vision (the cabin isn't moving) and your inner ear (I'm moving all over the place) sends your brain. Lying on your bunk with your eyes shut let's your brain focus on the signals your ears are sending and shuts off those from your eyes."

Just chew it in your mouth for a little while and you feel slightly better.  I think it's more just the spicy sensation in the mouth than any chemical change in the stomach."

It probably sounds awkward but works well for me.  There's a cleat on the mast so once it's up, I can cleat the halyard off and it will work like a temporary forestay.  Then I can take my time getting the real forestay attached (has a tube furling jib with a hyfield lever for tensioning and can be tricky to get right)."

Very early fiberglass boats used to have very suboptimal designs. Obviously it depends on the particular model and the deal you get, but I wouldn't go earlier than 80s - there's just no need. There are around 30 years old now.  Take for instace Westerly boats. The difference will be that of the Berwick (70s) vs the Fulmar (80s and early 90s), or the Centaur vs Griffon. MASSIVE difference and much superior boats in basically all respects."

It seems there is a trend towards marinas being certified ""Green Marinas"". This concerns you in that the removal, collection, and disposal of old bottom paint is tightly controlled. This may mean they require you to use special equipment, or that they don't even let you touch bottom period. http://www.scottmarineservice.com/ is the only place I've found so far that explicitly advertises self services. Another thought though, is the boat living on the trailer or in the water? This may change your anti fouling needs. Also while a boatyard would have a lift and stands, if the boat is coming and leaving on a trailer, it doesn't necessarily need to be a boat yard.

sailing,3aff75,Hellvis,2,Sat Jun 20 12:47:56 2015 UTC,"It's just that we have higher standards. Racing with blown out sails sucks a lot more than just sailing around with them, so racers tend to ""need"" new sails more often."

sailing,3aff75,natethejustok,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:02:52 2015 UTC,"It really all depends on what needs to be fixed initially. If you have everything in working order, then factor replacing lines and sails (depending on how much you sail) every few years. If you decide to not class-race either, then the sails can be pretty affordable and roughly the same price from Intensity Sails."

You check your local sailing mag for race days in your area (Here in SF we have Latitude 38, brilliant rag...). Dress in layers and go down to your Marina/Yacht Club with a cardboard sign that reads, ""RAILMEAT FOR HIRE"" or ""WILL SAIL FOR FOOD""... seriously, I mean this...

Even if you're a Noob we always need weight on the rail, makes the boat go faster! Be honest with your Skipper about how much experience you have in sailing and he'll put you in the right spot on board. My first few times out I was the Beer Man / Rail Meat... still had the time of my life. As a beginner you need to listen to all the more experienced sailors on board, don't be afraid to ask stupid questions, learn to tie a bowline and above all... DON'T FALL OFF THE BOAT! Also try to have a thick skin as some Skippers can be rather loud when giving orders. Don't take it personal, it is what it is... If you find yourself getting seasick do not be afraid or embarrassed to hurl, we've ALL done it and you usually feel tons better afterward. I cannot stress the importance of a PFD. That would probably be the most costly part of your gear for right now (a good one is around $120 - $150) but it is a MUST HAVE and you need to get in the habit of wearing it ALL THE TIME. Sea water is really cold and wet clothes are really heavy, not good for your health at all. I've got more tips but not enough time for now... Best of luck to you!!"

I raced yesterday, will pleasure sail Monday, race Wednesday, and race again next Saturday. I race twice a week regularly and can pleasure sail just about any time I want to. All for the price of bringing a few cans of beer to the boat. You can do this for free, and it really is that easy.

All of this was of the inboard side of the cleat mounted on the boom. If you set it it up just right the loose end hangs down right in the middle of the boom... right in front of you.

sailing,3ad2rr,SwankierTiger,7,Fri Jun 19 03:11:42 2015 UTC,"Keep weight forward as much as possible when beating in light winds. Shift weight back when wind increases.   Don't try to point too aggressively. If you are lacking speed, bear down a bit.   Don't hit the rudders aggressively when tacking or you will stall. Make a smooth turn. Once you are close to going into irons, release the main completely to stall it and trim the jib all the way in. Keep going until the jib has back winded and pushed the boat to the other tack. Once you are approaching your beating angle, pass the jib to the other side quickly and sheet in. Once the jib is powered and the boat is moving forward, sheet the main SLOWLY into position.   Travelers in both sails are your best choice to ease power. Use them a lot.   Tacking and going on the wire can be clumsy. But you already did 420s so you should be fine.   If ever your extension gets in the way during tacking or jibing, let it hang on the back of the boat and retrieve it later."
sailing,3ad2rr,Pastelitomaracucho,4,Fri Jun 19 04:54:04 2015 UTC,"One tip I can offer is with tacking.   Back wind the jib to help you turn through the wind during a tack, and with the main sheet out about a foot, keep the jib back winded until the batons on the main sail switch to the opposite side then proceed as normal.   You'll figure it out!"

You're used to spinning a dish, you're now trying to turn two knives. To tack, head up, blow about two feet of mainsheet as you pass head to wind, and keep the jib cleated until you're on the new tack. Then blow the old jib sheet, sheet the new jib sheet, then slowly sheet in the main as you get going. It's really easy to sheet the main too soon and haul yourself up to sitting in irons.  To go to windward, foot, don't pinch. Keep your weight forward, get the bows in. But not too much or you'll dig in and pitchpole. Set the traveler about 6"" from center and play the sheet (this is easy mode; if the wind is moderate, the sheet controls the top of the sail, the traveler controls the bottom, have fun).  Just reach back and forth for an hour to start, that's a lot of fun and it will get you used to the boat.  If you go over, try to get on the bottom hull when you're on your side, grab the righting line or the tramp and pull. If it's windy and you don't come right back up, be patient. The boat will windvane around until the mast is into the wind, and the wind will blow you back over, but it will take a minute or so.  Honestly, unless it's really blowing it's an easier boat to sail than a 420, you should be fine. Have fun!"

I believe we have a time limit on how many years it could be in the yard without touching the water just so we don't end up a boat graveyard, but as long as the storage fees are paid, that's pretty lenient.

sailing,3aau55,PocketHobbit,9,Thu Jun 18 16:30:52 2015 UTC,"From a sailing standpoint? Not terribly difficult. From an affordability standpoint? Difficult as hell.  Cruising is cheaper when you don't move. The boat doesn't break, you aren't paying for fuel, you have been somewhere long enough to learn the best ways to provision, you have local friends to help you solve problems, etc.  When we went cruising I thought I wanted to circumnav, now I am less certain. It isn't that I wouldn't like to cross the oceans, but rather that I think I would enjoy a different type of cruising more. We covered 10,000 miles in 18 months. I don't regret the pace, but the next trip will leave more time to explore each place we go.  Anything is possible (and broke people sail all over), but the vast majority of cruisers are not the $500/month type. We tried and failed to keep that budget by a massive margin. At times our fuel cost exceeded that budget. It wasn't realistic for the adventures we wanted to be able to pursue. I think long term cruising can be done safely with $1500-2000 a month. Just don't have time restrictions. But like anything this is hugely dependent on the individual. Do you want refrigeration (I did)? A nice RIB and outboard (check yes again)? Self steering (absolutely for us)? Canvas (definitely)?  We had friends with none of those things who lived cheaply, moved slower, and loved their trip. They certainly faced more hardship and danger than we did. It can be done with almost nothing, but I don't think most want that trip when balanced against how long they could sail in the Bahamas or Mexico in a smaller area and have some of the luxury items (or be able to fly home when you need/want to)."
sailing,3aau55,engeleh,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:58:13 2015 UTC,"As far as gas goes, isn't it easier to be under sail power more when you're offshore? Obviously some days are totally flat, but when you're crossing the pacific it would seem that fuel costs would drop significantly."
sailing,3aau55,IanSan5653,2,Sat Jun 20 22:30:43 2015 UTC,Yes. There is more wind offshore but you spend less time on passage than you do in the places you go. This has held true for every cruiser I know. One way to decrease costs is to sail a simpler and smaller boat. Fuel cost goes down along with repair costs. The majority of cruisers motor more hours than they would admit.
sailing,3aau55,engeleh,3,Sun Jun 21 08:36:48 2015 UTC,"I calculated a 5 year circumnavigation at 300k including the cost of the boat.  That was factoring in some comfort, extra safety stuff, back ups of essential equipment, an emergency fund and a modest amount of money to see the sights at the ports of call."

sailing,3aau55,somegridplayer,3,Fri Jun 19 07:41:18 2015 UTC,Maintenance cost goes up exponentially with boat size.  A circumvavigation on the scale of the Dove (26 I think) or Serafin (22 feet?) is a different animal than a big boat.  It can be done on the cheap (relatively) and it regularly is but it takes a very different boat (<35') which in turn takes a very different type of person.

I had a 1994 26S which is a swing keel, water ballast, non motor sailor. Super light weight but could sail in light to moderate off shore conditions. I sailed all over the Tristate area, trailering it to each location(Hudson River, Raritan Bay, Lake Hopatcong). I also trailered it from New Jersey to Key Largo and sailed it out to the reefs with no problems. Great Boat to learn on but it does have its limitations.

sailing,3aaby0,fisheyez,3,Thu Jun 18 16:36:05 2015 UTC,"I really don't want to bag on specific boats, but having owned both, the C25 is a much sturdier and better sailing boat than a Mac 26 or 25. Rigging, tackle, fiberglass, everything is 2x heavier-built than the 26. Also means the C25 is heavier to trailer, but you can trust it in a storm.  I'd check out C25s, O'Days, and older (80s or so) Hunters, all in swing keel flavor. And I'd be leery of trusting water ballast."
sailing,3aaby0,reyomnwahs,1 point,Thu Jun 18 16:41:48 2015 UTC,as a comparion a Mac26 has the same size rig as a Catalina 22. They felt about the same to me on the room as well. Catalina/Cal/Hunter/O'Day all have really good boats in that size range. I'd check out The Hunters/Catalina's and O'days.  There are Oday 25's with that have a small keel and retractable Centerboard (i feel it's a bit nicer than a swing keel) but that's my own opinion.
sailing,3aaby0,enuct,2,Thu Jun 18 22:28:15 2015 UTC,"Your requirements match a huge number of boats, which is a great thing! Now instead of searching for a particular brand of boat, you can look at most 25 footers, most of which can make it down the ICW, and most of which are trailerable.   If I were looking at boats that size for the ICW, I would try to find one that has a retracting keel... Which will help with trailering, and exploring the shallow areas of the ICW."

sailing,3aaby0,twrodriguez,3,Thu Jun 18 18:09:49 2015 UTC,"An S2 7.9 is a much faster boat (and more expensive). Compare phrf numbers on the boats to get an idea about sailing qualities. I've always been a fan of them. They have a big heavy keel that goes straight up and down into a big trunk inside the boat, so the interior isn't as pretty as a lot of boats, but it's focus is on sailing. The draft is 13"" centerboard up.  http://sailboatdata.com/viewrecord.asp?class_id=517"
sailing,3aaby0,Gl3g,2,Fri Jun 19 21:47:58 2015 UTC,for cruising I think the S2 27 or 8.0 would be better. The 7.9 is easier to trailer sure but the layouts are so much better on the others.
sailing,3aaby0,enuct,2,Thu Jun 18 22:30:18 2015 UTC,"The Lindenberg 26 is awesome.   Sails good, wide which makes it stable, easy to move around on and roomy, 6' head room, can handle 8' seas, sleeps 4.  No worries about getting brained by the boom.    Faster boats are always better than slower boats.  Always check the PHRF, lower is better.  Avoid swing keels and water ballast.    Outboards are cheaper to repair or replace than inboards, but not as nice to use.    Favor a bigger cockpit over a bigger cabin, more people spend more time in the cockpit than in the cabin."

sailing,3aaby0,gsasquatch,2,Fri Jun 19 01:49:26 2015 UTC,"I've sailed on 4 different 20' swing keels, 1 of them extensively, and they never inspired a feeling of confidence.    It was my impression that it would be possible for them to roll, they seemed tender.   I think it had to do with the keels being steel and not lead or  It might have been the low quality and small size of the boats as much as the swing keel.   The high PHRF like 220+ made them not fun.    The idea of going out in 5' waves and 20+ knots was terrifying, whereas it'd be no problem with a fixed keel, even of similar size.  I've seen 30+ kts and 10' waves in a 22' fixed keel, and after the initial fear I started to enjoy it.  I broached once in a 20' lift keel, a U20, but I still felt more confident in that boat as it was wider, faster, and better designed than the 20' swing keels I was on.   The only other keel boats I've broached on have been two different J24, and I still have confidence in them.   Maybe a broach in a swing keel would have changed my feeling on them.     In a dagger board dinghy, I just take it as part of the game.  I'd just rather not sail on a swing keel.   I haven't tried the Cal 25 or the S2 7.9, which I think are bigger swing keels, they may be fine, esp. if you intend to be out in shallower water.   Where I sail I'm generally in 30+ feet of water and I leave my boat in the water for the season, so I like the fin keel.  One of the biggest problems I had with the fixed keel was the expense of the travel lift, which I mitigated by going to a J24 which can be single point lifted by a crane."

sailing,3aaby0,enuct,2,Fri Jun 19 13:28:05 2015 UTC,"It might depend on the trailer, check to see if it can slide off the back.    I tried it for the first time this past spring after helping someone else do it.    I needed a deep ramp and a trailer extension.  Even so I still submerged the rear truck bumper.   When the boat is on the trailer, the waterline at the bow is about chin level,  I needed to get the bow into chin deep water.  I think I'll hire the crane to retrieve though."

It might need significant repairs, but with a Fireball, that should be easily inside your abilities. It takes a bit of learning, but really, once you know how to put on a coat of urethane, you have most of the skills you need! They just take a bit of work, but are not all that hard to maintain.  Getting a cover for them will really help keep the upkeep to a minimum.    Joining a club will be your best bet. There will be people there who will know what you need and will likely even come and see the boat with you if you ask nicely and perhaps buy them a beer.  Sailors are a very welcoming crowd and a vital knowledge resource for people at all levels.    Put up some pics.  I would love to see them.

sailing,3a68bf,PocketHobbit,8,Wed Jun 17 15:32:47 2015 UTC,"I'm a firm believer that the best classroom is a race course.  It's very cause and effect and you can learn WHY things are done which in many ways is more important than HOW.  Find a local club and make yourself available as crew.  In this area showing up with beer is frequently more important than showing up with experience.  Ask questions, pay attention.  Recognize what you don't know and if someone is doing something differently than what you expect then find out why.  If you can, get on a ""race boat"" (J boats, etc.)  The owners of those are generally (really speaking in big generalities now so please nobody be offended) financially invested in doing well and so should hopefully have also invested in the knowledge to do well.  This is opposed to a cruiser who is just wanting something fun to do with their boat.  Sailboats will still move in the right direction even if trimmed and handled very badly so it's possible to end up on some old salt's boat who has 30+ years of experience who just has a textbook's worth of bad habits and badly understood principles.  It's not the absolute fastest way to learn but it's the best and it doesn't cost anything.  A single summer of racing will give you more experience and knowledge than most coastal cruisers and daysailers have."
sailing,3a68bf,texasrigger,3,Wed Jun 17 16:11:50 2015 UTC,I could not agree more.  You will learn more about sail boat handing in different conditions racing that years cruising around the bay.  I would find a active fleet of one design boats; a one design that doesn't need a lot of work and go racing with them.
sailing,3a68bf,jdubes,6,Thu Jun 18 00:05:20 2015 UTC,"So, there is usually 2 schools of thought on this question.  School 1= Take classes, read books, go to yacht clubs and volunteer to be crew.  School 2=  Buy a cheap boat, grab a pfd, and go learn how to sail.  I'm more of a school 2, kind of guy.  Buy a cheap 2k-5k boat and just get out on the water.  I learned more this way then all the club races, books, and classes could have taught me when I began.  Now that I have the basics. The classes, book's, and racing just improves my sailing."

Get a mainsail only boat like an old Sunfish, Laser or Banshee (or any of hundreds of others) and just sail the shit out of it.  The experience you gain here will serve you well no matter what you sail in the future.  If a local yacht club or marina has a ""fleet"" of a particular boat, get one (or rent one) of those, and talk to all the folks who sail them.  They'll give you great tips and advice.  Also sail on other peoples' keel boats -- it's a whole different level of sailing."

Pros for crewing on a bigger boat: You'll learn a lot fast about how to make a boat go up and downwind, and you probably won't drown.  Cons: Racing can color your view of sailing forever. You end up thinking that going out, rounding marks and coming back are all there is to sailing, and just going out sailing around starts to feel like it's not 'doing anything'. This is bad.  Pros for buying a cheap dinghy: You'll learn a lot, no one is yelling at you, it's fun, far less chance of burnout, you'll get into exploring your local area and dorking around in a way that racing sailors almost never do.  Cons: Far more adventure, you might flip the boat, break something, drown, die, or be late for dinner. You really do have to plan and think a lot, you're essentially re-inventing sailing for yourself. If you break something or drop the mainsheet in the middle of the lake you have a long paddle home.  Pros and cons each way, take your pick. Good luck!"

But it does seem like a known failure mode. Lots of club racers never do anything on a sailboat but race."
sailing,3a68bf,CLevelIdiot,2,Wed Jun 17 18:52:40 2015 UTC,"The ""Buy a boat and just sail it"" is an alright school of thought.  It's good to go out with a friend who owns a boat as well, bring beer, be ready to work and learn.  That being said, the ASA 101 course is pretty solid, and would give you a lot of sailing confidence and experience in a pretty quick amount of time for roughly $300."
sailing,3a68bf,tkaraszewski,1 point,Thu Jun 18 05:09:19 2015 UTC,"Pay for intensive lessons. Go somewhere like this, and schedule as many lessons as closely together as possible.  Once you've run through enough courses that you feel like you've got a handle on all the basics, join a yacht club and befriend an avid racing skipper, and crew on his boat as often as possible. This will teach you finer points that intro lessons won't."
sailing,3a68bf,KaitlinNCSU,1 point,Thu Jun 18 06:01:01 2015 UTC,"First, have you ever sailed before?  More than a time or two?  If not, I'd suggest trying to volunteer for a local sailing club as crew during their races.  The skipper and experienced crews will teach you a lot, and you may make friends to take you out more often than just for races.  I would just hate for you to buy a boat and not have the time or drive to sail it, especially with all the frustration of just learning.  After you have some experience, I would suggest buying a boat and some learn to sail books.  Read about the basics, then go out and practice.  Don't be afraid of messing up because that is how you learn. If you are looking for a mid-size boat, don't forget to learn some basics about motors.  I have more trouble with the motor than the sailing!    A lot of used sailboats are in your price range.  You'll have to consider if you want a dinghy, mid-sized cruiser, or a mid-sized racer.  A dinghy will teach you the most and is the easiest to launch every use, but I find it can be uncomfortable to sail after a couple of hours.  You will definitely get a workout!  By mid-sized boat, I mean anything from 19-27 foot.  These are great sized boats for lakes or sounds.  Some mid-sized boats are designed for cruising, and will have a relatively comfortable cabins.  Others are geared towards racing, like J-boats, and will move a lot better on the water.  There are a few boats that work well for both racing and weekend or overnight camping, such as any Catalina Capri or Sport.  My family has a Catalina Capri 25, and it truly is great for a long day of sailing, and for our small club's races.    Another option that I think may be better for a new sailor is to 'lease' a boat.  I've seen ads like this on Craigslist every once in a while.  You'll pay half of the dock and boat fees for the year, and have the right to sail it half of the 52 weekends.  Another option is to split the cost of a boat (and dock, if needed) with a friend."
sailing,3a68bf,canuckleballer,1 point,Mon Jun 22 13:04:00 2015 UTC,"Take a couple lessons and then hop on a race boat. Odds are the skipper of the race boat won't give you much time on the tiller, and the lessons will give you some tiller time, a good understanding of the ""why things work"" when sailing and the rules of the road. Then you won't be that idiot motoring along putting up his sail cutting in front of all the sailboats sailing out of the harbour."

sailing,3a4t23,Knights_of_Napier,25,Wed Jun 17 05:56:31 2015 UTC,"yes, yes I have.. here's the news report  The news got a few things right, there was a dog, there was a man, I did take my kayak to shore..... so now for.. the rest of the story.  I was vagabond cruising in a little 24' sloop and after a week at Ocean Springs municipal marina I headed out to visit Horn Isl before I turned east, after snagging a few crab traps I got to the island just before sunset and laid hook, made dinner and went to sleep. I woke up to a nasty chop and blow and spent the next 48 hours catching up on sewing as I couldn't take the dog to shore.  The weather changed and the wind clocked NW so I moved to what I though was a more protected anchorage, I was wrong, (20/20 I should have gone to the gulf side to have the isl windward, but  I was new and stupid). Turns out I didn't have good enough ground tackle for the grassy shit I dropped hook in.   At about 1 AM  when I awake to the thud thump thump THUD of banging the keel into hard stuff, I'd already sealed the fuel tank and leashed the rudder so when I went into the shore even though it was big gnarly shit the vessel was prepared.   I radioed that I was getting beat into the surf on Horn Isl, (not a mayday or PAN PAN , just a statement that I was getting beat into the shore) the only respondents was USCG telling me to get a life jacket on, broadcast a cell number and give them my location.   So the boat gets tossed in 6' breakers and I broke Chapman's rule by abandoning ship by stepping down into the surf with my dog and bail out bag in the kayak, we got to shore soaked to the core with a dry, fully charged cell phone and a bail out bag.   USCG had several birds in the air rescuing other folks nearby, I got lifted off Horn Isl at about 03:30 and flown to Mobile AL, I got less embarrassed about crashing when I saw the air speed indicator showing 60 kts to hover. 3 sailors died that night, but not me. I hitch hiked to Pascagoula, got a car lift from a commercial fisherman to the sail boat marina via fair du ponce, there I got lunch from some random sailors that couldn't head out that day so were picnicking on their deck when I walked up. The sailors gave me a lift to Ocean Springs and 4 days later when the storm subsided I got a lift to Horn Isl and recovered my boat with help from a local that owned a boat towing business.   I stayed 10 more weeks in Ocean Springs, fantastic folks, wonderful marina, best place I've ever taken a $10 per day slip."
sailing,3a4t23,dirtyPirate,3,Wed Jun 17 06:38:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah 60 knots with normal/undersized anchor in an unprotected anchorage, probably without enough rode, in unknown/non-optimal ground conditions. There's almost 100% certainty of dragging.   I was down in La Paz Mexico and it was 45 gusting 50 but the holding was great where I was and I had 10 to 1 out on an all chain rode and a way oversized modern style anchor. I took the dinghy ashore and went to the bar. I think I still have sand in my eye from that storm."

I had some experience in surf at that point and it was a medium protected anchorage so not that crazy. 50 knots is not quite enough to flip a dinghy with a motor on it simply through the wind only, let alone with you in it. Plus when you're going with the weather you're in the troff going with it so it acts as a screen."

sailing,3a4t23,dirtyPirate,5,Wed Jun 17 22:01:35 2015 UTC,"Caught in a popup storm on a 24' keelboat while inland lake sailing with an inexperienced group of friends. Peaked at 40kt winds, 5-6' waves in about 8 minutes.  Broached and took on a lot of water, lost one crew overboard but was able to get back to the boat before it righted and took off again. Most crew had fallen to the low side in the broach and weren't able/didn't know to get high as quickly as possible. About 10 seconds after we righted, the boat went over again, this time fully capsizing between water below deck and crew weight.  First thought was ""guess it's not impossible to capsize a keelboat"".  Two of us were able to get to the keel and right it (in hindsight, just another bad decision in a string of bad decisions).  Unfortunately, the deck hatch had broken off and the second all of the water in the cabin went forward, there was no saving it.  The boat went down like we were in a movie.  One of the most surreal moments of my life, standing on the stern as the bow disappeared and the mast shortly after while surrounded by 6 people and a debris field. Three more seconds and the boat is gone and we're all just floating in the middle of this storm.  It happened so quickly that we were only able to grab a handful of life jackets. I was able to grab onto the empty cooler. Another was able to snag the rudder. The storm cleared fairly quickly after that and we started swimming for shore about 1,000 yards away.  There is a rescue service on our lake but the radio went down with the boat.  The waterproof cellphone holder failed and no one was able to hear the air horn.  Poor visibility meant we were passed by 4 boats in the distance (including the rescue boat) before a 5th motorboat came to our rescue.  They were only able to hear us because they had be been run aground by the wind and while the guys worked to push the boat off the bottom, one of them thought they heard screams.  In the end, all hands were accounted for.  The only injury was mild hypothermia.  The boat rested comfortably in 40' of water for a month before it raised and refitted.  The skipper learned not to try riding out/outrun a storm. And I will always keep extra life jackets within arms reach.  Most legitimate near death experience of my life."
sailing,3a4t23,rsch,5,Wed Jun 17 15:43:37 2015 UTC,"Not me and not very serious, but I still get a good laugh out of it. My brother had a friend in school with him. This friend brought a crappy old paper tiger for cheap. He then spent a lot of money making it seaworthy again. So one day they decide to go sailing in the harbour. everything was going fine until they capsize. Turns out the boat wasn't so leakproof after all, and it was filled with water so they couldn't get it upright. During this time they managed to drift into the shipping lane, taking turns to rest on the boat so it didn't sink faster. Fortunately for them the harbour master saw them and towed them to shore. He asked what they did and the reply was ""We're students at the Maritime School""."
sailing,3a4t23,kati_pai,6,Wed Jun 17 10:09:20 2015 UTC,"(short version. Remind me that I write down the full version when I have more time)  We got dismasted while sailing through the night from Norway to The Netherlands. First we tried to send a pan-pan distress message via VHF channel 16, but quickly realized that this wouldn't work with the antenna that is normally on top of the mast now in the water. Then we tried to use our mobile phones but we were to far out of shore. So we started shooting flares. A ship appeared to come our way, bet then resumed its course. Later, a warship from the German Navy found us. They directed a German rescue boat to our position which towed us to Cuxhaven. While being towed the mast that was hanging alongside snapped in two. The day after we arrived in the harbour, we made an emergency rig from the lower part of the mast and motored all the way back home."

sailing,3a4t23,loltidderkcuf,1 point,Wed Jun 17 12:05:36 2015 UTC,"Pan-pan:       Three calls of pan-pan are used in radiotelephone communications    to signify that there is an urgency on board a boat, ship, aircraft, or other vehicle but that, for the time being at least, there is no immediate danger to anyone's life or to the vessel itself.  This is referred to as a state of urgency. This is distinct from a Mayday call, which means that there is imminent danger to life or to the continued viability of the vessel itself.  Thus ""pan-pan"" informs potential rescuers (including emergency services and other craft in the area) that a safety problem exists whereas ""Mayday"" will call upon them to drop all other activities and immediately initiate a rescue attempt.

One of her first days of sailing ended with an embarrassing rescue.   She was so proud of her little boat that she bought one of those yachting caps, the kind with Captain embroidered on the front. As she was sailing that day she capsized her boat right in front of a US Navy destroyer that was returning from a deployment. She was having difficulty righting her boat when the Navy Harbor Patrol came up to investigate and clear her out of the way. The destroyer actually had to back down and stop in the middle of the bay.   The guys on the Navy patrol boat took her aboard, and seeing her cap, rendered honors  and jokingly told the destroyer ""we have the captain aboard"" over VHF.

Numerous attempts involving boat hooks, kitchen knives, and duct tape to cut the line failed, as did attempts to bring the line up to the surface with a grappling hook and a winch.   A visit from the coastguard left me fearing for my boat (they nearly rammed me numerous times - regular keystone cops).  I waved them off, picked up the phone, called vessel salvage/diver service who said they could get Vessel Assist to bring them out and free the boat.  I spent about 4 hours in this predicament and the boat's motion was so awful I lost my lunch at one point (and I'm not prone to seasickness at all).  Eventually, boat showed up, diver splashed in, sixty seconds later surfaced and yelled ""you're free - fire it up!"".  I started my engine, headed for the gate, escorted by the Vessel Assist boat (well, he had to go same way and wanted to get paid).

sailing,3a4t23,chipthechip,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:55:51 2015 UTC,"Sort of.  I was not rescued myself, but was responsible for 3 others needing to be rescued when a boat I was in command of sunk.  I was in my early 20s and lived in a rural community in East Texas on a river downstream from a dam.  From time to time this river floods the surrounding area when the lake level gets too high.  I was one of the people who always stayed through these things and helped make sure everyone was safe (with this single notable exception I guess.)  Mostly this was using my little jon boat and outboard to make sure things like propane tanks got tied to trees and did not float away, chase away looters, ferry in groceries to those to old/sick/stubborn to evacuate, bring the occasional news crew in to film a spot for the local news, etc.  Anyway the waters over the road varied in depth and in some places were even dry.  This is an area that is heavily wooded save where it was cleared for roads and homesteads.  This meant I could not simply drive the boat down the roadway underwater.  Instead I put in and would pick people/things up at a bridge that normally spanned a creek that fed into the river.  I could then travel down the creek to the river then cut up the river and come in on the other side of the hill that made the dry area blocking boat entrance/egress.  Well, I was bringing in several days of grocery for several households just roughly an hour before sunset and had the boat all loaded with one other person that was helping me.  At the bridge two other residents were looking for a way in.  Normally I would have just made my run then came back out for them…however this particular run was VERY late in the day and since the trip in/out was just over 30 minutes each way I knew by the time I got in, unloaded, and made it back out sundown would have occurred.  Navigating the flooded forest out into a swift flowing river out of its banks and back into the community in the dark was just far too dangerous.  So I agreed to take them in.  After a brief argument over whether they would wear life jackets (they did...because I refused to crank the engine without everyone on board in a PFD) we got ready to head underway.  The boat was seriously overloaded and should not have been making this trip.  Our rail was maybe 3 or 4 inches above the surface.  However, I could not bring myself to leave people stranded overnight.  The confidence and foolishness of youth decided I could handle it. Ok so we get going and about a quarter mile into the creek/wood our accident happens.  Like most of these things it was not a single thing but a series of actions and reactions that summed up resulted in a near disaster.  I generally drove the boat through the edge of the wooded area that at normal levels would have been above and edging the creek bed as the thick brush and trees helped to slow the flow of water a bit and make things a bit more manageable.  However, there was one little dogleg part where the brush got so thick I had to cross almost perfectly perpendicular to the flow of the water to get to the only navigable path on the other side.  This was the most dicey part of the whole trip and I was very respectful of how dangerous it was even though I'd made the run literally hundreds of times. Well after taking a look and checking for anything floating in the current that would give us trouble I started out into the creek channel.  Almost exactly half way across things went bad.  First a submerged log below the surface and aimed just aft of the beam rotated just enough that I saw it in time to make a hard turn toward it so it hit us more or less head on rather than broadside.  The log struck us and shoved us over onto some brush near the edge of the channel.  (I'm oversimplified for brevity) Next one of my passengers decided to help get us off the brush by leaning overboard to ""push it down.""  Remember how I said the boat was overloaded?  This is where that little piece of poor decision making almost got deadly.  When the guy leaned over the side it pushed the rail under the surface.  The boat instantly filled with water and sunk right beneath us in seconds.    After a really hectic 45 seconds or so that felt like literal hours we got everyone safely clinging to trees and out of the swiftest current.  Here we now had a dilemma...it was going to be dark soon and no boats would be going in or out.  We are roughly a quarter mile downstream in a current that Phelps could not swim against. (Probably 7 knots or so)  Knowing that there was no way in that cold water we would survive the night, we came up with a desperate plan.  Thankfully, it worked.    I basically swam, climbed, drug myself along underwater brush from tree to tree…a few feet of progress at a time all the way back to the road where we put in.  I then ran up the road about a mile and used a phone to call for help.  Other neighbors, the local sheriff and the Texas DPS managed to get boats in the water and to the three people clinging to trees and everyone made it out.  The groceries were lost. What I learned from the whole ordeal: While the advice “you are capable of more than you think” is great for most…some of us are so comfortable with risk the inverse is true.  There is a fine line between confident and foolhardy. PFDs.  They save people. If you think “it will be OK as longs as X does not occur”…seriously question if it is OK.  Life in general and boating specifically is risky, and it is all about managing it…but know when you are taking chances you should not. Make sure your passengers know what to do in an emergency.  No, you can’t cover every contingency but you can at least cover the basics.  For example, when I take people sailing on my boat after the usual warning about the boom, holding on to something when out of the cockpit, and how to use the head I give a quick overview of 1) what to do if someone falls overboard and 2) what to do if that someone is ME.  I show them how to start the engine, read the location off the gps, key up the VHF on 16, and release all the sails."

The kite is set from the cockpit, as all the controls are led to the bulkhead.    We sail with a total of 4 crew.  On a SET: Position1 takes the kite out of the bag and feeds the tack out while position2 is trimming the tack line.  Next, P2 starts the hoist while P1 moves on to getting the bow sprit extended.    P3 is trimming the jib, and moves to trimming the Spin after the set.   Meanwhile P4 is yelling, drinking beer, and making the boat turn.  Obviously the most important and stressful position on the boat!"

sailing,3a2fxc,Markol0,6,Tue Jun 16 18:27:34 2015 UTC,"Night sailing is fun! Everyone I ask tends to remember the first time they did it! There's no trick to it, just go out at night (in familiar waters at first) and go for a sail. Use your GPS as backup, but you really want to learn what to look out and how things look at night. Hint: get a RED flashlight or even better headlamp so you don't kill your night vision. Night vision takes 15-20 minutes to establish itself, you don't wan to lose that! (I have a cheap energizer LED lamp that mounts on my forehead. First click is red, then 4 clicks (with eyes closed) to switch it of.)  I consider blue water sailing to be easier than coastal sailing. While the weather could be bad, modern weather forecasting should do away with most of the issues here. Blue water is big, no obstacles or other idiots around."
sailing,3a2fxc,hilomania,3,Tue Jun 16 21:06:29 2015 UTC,"Couldn't have said it better myself. Red light headlamp makes a night experience much more enjoyable. You're gonna have crew, so should have one because one person with a white light will blind everyone they look at.  If you have a smart phone, look up Twilight app.  It will allow you to red-shift your screen and make it excessively dim.  Save your night vision."

sailing,3a2fxc,ruthlesscredditor,2,Tue Jun 16 19:49:36 2015 UTC,Agreed. There are online quizzes that you can take that just show the lights in motion and you need to figure out what's going on. Worth trying.

sailing,3a2rlb,Guygan,3,Tue Jun 16 21:12:57 2015 UTC,"C-Clamp is not holding the rudder on. It is keeping the rudder up. (Prindle's have a crappy system with an uphaul line into a V-groove that is supposed to keep your rudder up.) This line always slips and drops the rudder. I just put a small cleat on the tiller arm of mine. People use different methods, this is by far not the worst I've ever seen. Boat looks in good condition. It is also an excellent donor boat for a trimaran such as a Strike 18."

They last and last. I am redoing all of the lines on my Nacra right now and spent around $200 from Murrays marine. Great source for small cat parts. I loved my prindle, it gave me many years of great service. I sold mine in near mint condition to my friend for about 1k. but because I knew it was going to a good home. With three sets of sails, and if the hulls are not soft, and you don't have to replace the standing rigging or tramp, this isnt a bad deal. The small things are cheap and easy to fix."
sailing,3a2rlb,Lost_in_the_world_,2,Wed Jun 17 03:54:56 2015 UTC,"From the pictures you provided I'd say the cat is in good condition. Some of the lines should be replaced and some work needs to be done on the stern but nothing major. The hull and the sails seem to be perfectly fine and shouldn't require much, if any, work. Assuming there isn't any cracking where the stays attach to the hull this should be a good buy. Just be sure to check the quality of the blocks. Those are pricey to replace.   Have fun out there!"

Don't. this is probably the most relevant subreddit.  regarding the boat i would go see it if i where you and check it for soft spots. see if there is anywhere on the boat where you can push the glass-fiber inwards.  The rudders look surprisingly fine and i can't seem to find anything overly alarming in your pictures, but i would still check the crack in pic 9 to see if it is just a crack in the gel-coat or if the glass-fiber inside is damaged.   Also check out what condition the sails.  and lastly i would like to ask what you want in a boat ? because cats in those sizes handle a lot differently based on the different designs."

sailing,39ytmp,seablizz,1 point,Tue Jun 16 00:23:08 2015 UTC,"As a hopeful future sailboat owner, I have always wondered what was keeping people from stealing sailboats.  For example, I have sailed on multiple board with the same padlock combination (""SAIL"" in numbers).  Often times the padlock on the companion way is the only security measure between a thief and the keys to starting the engine.       How hard would it be to case a boat, realize it was only used on weekends, and sail away into the dusk on a Sunday night, and have 5+ days until someone realized the boat has been stolen.   With some planning, the thief could acquire some used sails ahead of time.  Put sail numbers that matched a similar make and model of boat, and get decals with a name and reg numbers that match the sail number.  This all seems like a lot of work for an inexpensive boat, but how about a valuable boat.    I'm just rambling, but it has always had me thinking about the measures I'll take so that my boat does not get stolen."
sailing,39ytmp,reyomnwahs,2,Mon Jun 15 22:44:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, agree. It's so easy to do I'm surprised it doesn't happen more often. Wouldn't likely be able to clear into anywhere internationally, but even just taking the boat three or four states over would probably enough for it never to get found."
sailing,39ytmp,tkaraszewski,2,Mon Jun 15 22:48:47 2015 UTC,"I literary have a $60k boat sitting on a trailer in a parking with nothing at all keeping anyone from hooking it up to a truck and driving it away.   There's zero resale value for a stolen one design boat, though. It would be immediately obvious where J/70 #371 came from and who was the rightful owner of it as soon as it was offered for sale or entered in a race. It's easy to steal but hard to do anything else with once stolen."
sailing,39ytmp,seablizz,3,Tue Jun 16 02:18:13 2015 UTC,"I agree there is zero resale value for a one design boat as a whole for racing purposes.  However, there is normal stolen boat resale value for non-racing purposes.  Further, if the fleet is that strong that the stolen hull with be noticed, there is probably a nice market for used parts."
sailing,39ytmp,SchoonerKat1,1 point,Tue Jun 16 03:00:43 2015 UTC,"I suppose it depends on the boat. My boat was sitting on the market for at least 8 months (I think) before I bought it, so selling it (in general) seems hard.... selling it as a stolen boat seems even harder. Provided when I was buying, I mostly looked at boats in a local brokerage, but as the buyer I looked up stuff on the boats online. (Sanity check: the boat I'm making an offer on is documented with the coast guard to the person I am buying it from).  Steeling a boat to part it out seems a lot more likely. And I feel like you could part-out a used boat for more than you could sell it. Sounds like a pain in the ass though.   I think why people don't steal boats (or not very often) is because there are way better things to steal, like bicycles."

Almost certainly not anything related to GPS, there's no reason to put a gps antenna on a mast.  All you are required to have is an all around white for anchor and a steaming light for operating under power.  If you don't already have conduit in the mast for the wiring NOW IS THE TIME.  Installing PVC conduit is a very easy do it yourself job and will cost less than $20 bucks."
sailing,39xy1f,texasrigger,1 point,Mon Jun 15 21:35:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah.  In the picture it's difficult to see it, but I actually cut two different ""cords"".  There was one cord for a light, with a positive and a negative.  But there was another cord that had the make up of something like a coaxial cable... like from an old tv... that you run from the cable line in the house to the back.  I'm pretty sure that was the ""GPS"" line... I'm referring too... actually what I mean to be saying is VHF... but my experience is much greater with GPS rather than VHF.  Hence the slip up.... but heck I don't know.  There is an antenna on the mast head so that's why it's my guess.    Regarding conduit, oh yeah baby... that's for sure.  Thanks for the tip.... I am planning on doing much more than just that....  As I said before.  I really want to get good at taking down my mast and putting it back up, therefore it was/is important for me to have the proper tool.  I think the A-frame hoist thing is going to do it for us.    Currently the primary reason for taking down the mast is transport.  We are about to head to the other coast...... yeah seriously.  Today I have been working on the wheel bearings on the trailer."

sailing,39xy1f,texasrigger,2,Tue Jun 16 00:45:09 2015 UTC,"Technically there is some loss but probably nothing you'd notice.  Replace the coax while the mast is down (replace all of the wiring in the mast while it's down if it's in your budget) and then put a connection in the cable so you can disconnect it easily in the future.  IF the standpipe is easy to run wires through (I'm not looking at your picture, just going by generalities) then run the electrical and coax in that first and do your connections in the boat near the mast (bus bar for wires, see below for coax).  If it isn't then do your connections in the mast.  Use a pair of PL59's with a barrel connector between then (can't remember the designation on those)  Plug connections on the wires are fine.  Use dielectric silicone on everything and then tape it up.  Also don't forget stress relief at the top ends of the wires.  Also, make sure the mast and step have a good drain."
sailing,39xy1f,FlickrPaul,1 point,Tue Jun 16 01:04:01 2015 UTC,Right on.  I'll certainly put all the stuff on and do all the work while the mast is down.

I'll definitely have to take a look at this.  Again thanks for all the tips!

I've done this with J/24 which is close to your dimensions, and i needed a 20 foot pole attached to my truck to push the boat on the trailer into the water.  Then you need the same pole to pull the boat from the launch area.  It's possible just don't forget that siting on that trailer the boat probably needs 5-6 feet of water to float off the trailer.  Macgregor 25's have a swing keel."

sailing,39x0mt,Survove,3,Tue Jun 16 18:17:43 2015 UTC,There are a few ways I know of and probably million more and better ones.   My Marina is across the lake from a large coal terminal so me and my dock mates are frequently washing our boats just to try and keep up with the usual things plus a thin layer of coal dust.   Obviously you can go to Something-Mart and buy non-skid deck wash plus a firm synthetic bristle brush and make a huge difference. Yours doesn't seem that bad so I think you'll have quite a bit of success just going that route. Everyone has their own preference but you should be good with just about anything. Price is always a concern and they seem to vary wildly. Star-brite and 3M both make cleaning products that are readily available in most stores that have any sort of marine or auto/marine section.   Since I have the coal dust issue I power wash the hull and topsides of my boat once at spring commissioning day and again around mid-summer. I use an electric (no gas powered tools allowed by Marina rules) 1600 psi power washer with a rather neat rotating wand tip.  This makes a big difference on the really dug-in grime. Just be careful of your registration stickers and your vinyl. The pressure washer will take them off. Don't ask me how I know this.

I've also heard that the MacGregor boats are more prone to cracking and failures than other builders, but I haven't seen that for myself. People will say that plastic is harder to repair than fiberglass, but that's just because they don't know one material like the other. G/flex epoxy system by West will take care of nearly any problems with the plastic hull. As for the design, the boat is quick and open, easy to sail and beach. Problems include smaller foils which stall out too easily, so maintaining flow is important. The boat is heavier than a 420, but also sturdier and more comfortable for adults."
sailing,39unjw,Chaofawn,3,Sun Jun 14 22:50:24 2015 UTC,"Pick this apart at your leisure...  Here's my advice... (My own re-post) Want to sail for FREE? Here's how... You check your local sailing mag for race days in your area (Here in SF we have Latitude 38, brilliant rag...). Dress in layers and go down to your Marina/Yacht Club with a cardboard sign that reads, ""RAILMEAT FOR HIRE"" or ""WILL SAIL FOR FOOD""... seriously, I mean this... This is literally how I got into the sport and I've had a blast ever since... See, these guys that get the big boats NEED people to run them. It's a challenge racing a 40ftr. single handed! Even if you're a Noob we always need weight on the rail, makes the boat go faster! Be honest with your Skipper about how much experience you have in sailing and he'll put you in the right spot on board. My first few times out I was the Beer Man / Rail Meat... still had the time of my life. As a beginner you need to listen to all the more experienced sailors on board, don't be afraid to ask stupid questions, learn to tie a bowline and above all... DON'T FALL OFF THE BOAT! Also try to have a thick skin as some Skippers can be rather loud when giving orders. Don't take it personal, it is what it is... If you find yourself getting seasick do not be afraid or embarrassed to hurl, we've ALL done it and you usually feel tons better afterward. I cannot stress the importance of a PFD. That would probably be the most costly part of your gear for right now (a good one is around $120 - $150) but it is a MUST HAVE and you need to get in the habit of wearing it ALL THE TIME. Sea water is really cold and wet clothes are really heavy, not good for your health at all. I've got more tips but not enough time for now... Best of luck to you!!"

sailing,39tnc2,jeffrife,2,Sun Jun 14 18:32:40 2015 UTC,What would a laser sailers one look like
sailing,39tnc2,Fus__Ro__Dah,10,Sun Jun 14 19:07:07 2015 UTC,"Crunches, crunches, Crunches, cry.....  With that much hiking out, you need a strong core"
sailing,39tnc2,jeffrife,3,Sun Jun 14 19:14:26 2015 UTC,"Quad exercises too, for endurance on high wind days. But mostly core"
sailing,39tnc2,Fus__Ro__Dah,2,Sun Jun 14 19:42:11 2015 UTC,Most definitely.   As I'm fixing up my laser I'm starting T-25. Hopefully in a month or so I'll be set and the boat will be ready
sailing,39tnc2,jeffrife,1 point,Sun Jun 14 20:32:13 2015 UTC,"For basics, there's no massive amount of athleticism needed. As long as you can throw your weight around and are conscious of what you are doing, it is perfectly doable to do have a balanced boat, have good roll tacks and gybes, and proper heel in light to medium wind. I'd say sailing is a sport of skill rather than athletic ability. That being said, there is no doubt being in shape makes all maneuvers much easier."
sailing,39tnc2,frojoe27,2,Sun Jun 14 20:38:47 2015 UTC,"It most definitely is about skill more than athletic ability, however, you still should build a strong core if you plan on hiking out constantly. Hiking takes a toll on your back if it's weak and you don't do it properly"
sailing,39tnc2,Fus__Ro__Dah,1 point,Sun Jun 14 20:41:45 2015 UTC,"True, but athletic ability is becoming far more important at the top end of the sport to the point where having a bunch of strong guys and a few sailors to use their manpower effectively isn't far from reality."
sailing,39tnc2,frojoe27,2,Mon Jun 15 01:31:41 2015 UTC,"I completely disagree. In places like Volvo Ocean Races, it no doubt is good to have some strongmen, but if they do not have a good understanding of the sport the team will not do well. I have no doubt that every single person on the crew of the Volvo boats have a deep understand of the sport. Especially on boats where there isn't a crew of 17+, like HP dinghy racing like 49ers or even small keelboat racing like mengels 24, athletic ability is not nearly as a factor for the team than how good a sailor's sailing ability and understanding is. Strength only really matters on some smaller HP boats and the larger ocean and off shore racers; anything in between, it's not a huge factor."
sailing,39tnc2,Fus__Ro__Dah,2,Mon Jun 15 02:05:52 2015 UTC,"I should have ended my sentence with ""on some boats"". I stand by my statement that athletic ability is becoming more and more important in sailing, but only certain boats at the top end need athletes above intellectual sailors. Thinking AC72,  Rambler 88, Comanche, etc. Those crew members need to learn their roles in the team of course, and are surely great sailors, but they just couldn't cut it without being strong."

sailing,39tnc2,Fus__Ro__Dah,1 point,Mon Jun 15 02:56:12 2015 UTC,"You might not have seen the top laser sailors upwind. Most definitely extremely physical in anything that is not sub-6knots flat water. They need to pump their bodies once at each wave and make it count. Any break or less than full pump means they are losing ground to the others.   That being said: core (abs) is crucial. Another thing is the Iron Chair in which you sit against a wall with legs and hips doing 90 degrees with the floor and walls, and you just sit there until you break. 30min is respectable time while doing this.   Cardio is also crucial to enable to pump your body upwind all the way., so do one that reinforces your leg muscles for double the benefit."
sailing,39tnc2,Skiffbug,1 point,Mon Jun 15 02:02:48 2015 UTC,"For competitive racers, I completely agree that athletic ability is important, but for just casual racing or just practicing I think you can get good performance without rigorous training. Hence why I said ""for basics""."

It's an all year round season, sailing 6 days a week, and often trying to keep lean as hell, good way to get injured and sore  For someone looking to get started, heaps of core work, both static and dynamic, lots of overhead shoulder work, pulling in any direction, grip strength and a bunch of quad and hip flexor stuff. No need for super specific exercises, just a properly designed programming of free weights aimed at the areas above"
sailing,39tnc2,xXEhOkayXx,1 point,Mon Jun 15 08:14:01 2015 UTC,"When my friends and I used to race in lasers we had a pretty consistent work out that we would do every week day morning before sailing (we were all 15-16 then, so modify this as you see fit). Start with running (idk how often you run so go as far as you can). Endurance is important in a laser, so do not skimp on running. Next up are variations of pull ups, push ups, and crunches. We would go for three sets each: 5-10 pull ups, 15 push ups, 15 crunches, repeat. You can switch around your push ups with jump/clap push ups, triangle push ups, one-arm (do sets for both arms), or what ever else you can think of. Crunches can be modified as well by extending your legs out and bringing them to your chest (same can be done while doing pull ups, which is hard but pays off). After those you can do super mans, wall sits, and jump squats.   tldr: Lasers require the use of every part of your body for extended periods of time especially in heavy air. Run, work out arms, core, and legs (especially quads)."

sailing,39uws9,Heelioz,7,Mon Jun 15 00:15:09 2015 UTC,"Back wind the jib. The trick for tacking a h16 is to not jam the rudders over hard at first, but to keep the same force on the tiller until the you reach a 45 degree angle, and then don't wiggle it at all. Once the boat is into the wind, ease the main at least a foot (30cm?) Keep the jib back winded until the main ""pops"" over, then switch the jib. Keep the main out until the boat picks up speed then SLOWLY sheet in the main. If you get windward helm (the boat wants to turn into the wind) you are sheeting in to fast. You really have to use the sails to steer, which is hard because the jib is tiny. if you get stuck in irons, push the tiller and the mainsail out to backwind the main while turning. The side the main is on is the side it will stay on after getting out of irons. Nope. That's h16s. There are something call anti pitch pole foils which help as well as sitting/traping  as far back as posable. Once the breeze is above 14 knots I am always as far back as posable. I have foot straps attached to the hull so only one foot is on the trampoline frame while traping in these conditions. Another thing that could help is stiffer rudders. If youbhave the old plastic lexan rudders they tend to bend and make the bow move up and down while turning. EPO's drasticly help avoid this, but are expensize. You can avoid capsizing if you burry a bow by easing the main, and heading up sharply, but you have to be quick. If you are capsizing, make sure your mast is 100% sealed. As this will prevent a turtle 95% of the time."

sailing,39uws9,desertsail912,2,Tue Jun 16 11:25:43 2015 UTC,"I have had a hobbie 16 is what i do and it always works. In two of the videos in the other comments i see that they keep the jib locked the entire time, for some reason that has not worked for me... But just in case it does not work, try the following.   1) First get a good speed and slowly turn into the wind while keeping as much speed as possible. Dont turn it more then 45 degrees, if you turn it too fast then your making the boat go slower because you twisted the the rudder too fast the water will be pushing against the rudder too hard which will slow down the boat. Once you get into the wind and the sails are flapping, unsheet all the sails and the momentum should push you over just a little over going directly into the wind where you can start sheeting in the jib sail slowly, as soon as it catches then pull in the main sail. What helps is some times manually pushing over the jib sail, some times the sail batons gets stuck with the mast.    If you get stuck when you are directly into the wind (as you are saying you have problems) you can make the boat go in reverse. Yes in reverse. This has saved me many times. Once you are directly into the wind and your sails completely unhooked, literally turn your rudders the complete opposite direction, 100%. This will make the boat go in reverse in the direction the rudders are pointing at and once you slowly start moving towards the other side, start pulling in your jib slowly and turn your rudder slowly to the other direction while catching the wind. Once you are getting a little speed pull in your main sheet and you're set. Just remember when you turn the rudders completely it will take at least 15 to 20 seconds before you see the boat going in reverse, so give it a little time, it goes slow but it will move.   2) If your boat is digging to hard into the water you need to let go of your jib sail a little and problem solved.   Hope this helps."

sailing,39qw2h,hypnotoad23,3,Sun Jun 14 01:55:47 2015 UTC,Bakewell-White 37ft? Looks like the new Anarchy down in Auckland. Just a guess. Looks similar and they were out in these conditions yesterday. Edit: looks like its her (reading the sail number) https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/proxy/0310v9mSACGACbm4OpqsUXq3QaDzjkjshhGwvWkb_gNm9_EjnZHiTfPpOLKH6f0luUhaonocJTedI7PTS3z4LKoF1dgS5mc3xqePHEmRlIpgNkmoJRdcGi9Jb_BxUK4cggzYwS8=w336-h438-nc

sailing,39t6q8,drakeParagon,1 point,Sun Jun 14 15:11:32 2015 UTC,I appreciate your participation here in the sailing subreddit and your videos are completely enjoyable. my wife and I have watched all the current generation videos and it was funny. I remarked to her. I dont know if they are a couple I have been watching really close and I havent seen ONE ounce of PDA. This episode I saw it. :)   I have two questions for you.    Sailing couples. Ive watched tons of videos Ive met a bunch of sailing and powerboating couples now since buying my boat. Do you think Boating brings couples together? Or are couples that boat together just closer? My wife and I will be married 20 years this october and Sailing has been probably the first hobby that her and I have enjoyed together. I think it is enhancing our already existing relationship. Is it the teamwork aspect? I was interested in what you think about this because I am sure you have met a bunch of sailing couples that are out doing it.  I ask this question because I am sure it is eventual that we will be out on an ocean. (Probably not in the next 10 years but you really never know) You crossed oceans. Im sure you have seen the videos and experienced it live. What do you do with those freak waves out in the middle of the ocean? Is there ways of avoiding them? (Are there weather reports out there via ssb that you pick up?) I am sure the best laid plans can and do go awry sometimes.    Thanks for increasing the length of your videos. 38 minutes was amazing last time. I think my wife and I are going to become patreons. It is just we just paid cash for our boat and my engine in my car just needed to be replaced to the tune of $5200.00 so our savings has taken a hit recently. (freak oil problem killed my engine) So there is you guys. We are going to buy the Wicked Salty crew dinner on the wife and I and these two new guys I just caught (Seadog Cooper). The latter need a financial kick in the pants to make more movies!  You three are our favorites. Keep it up and happy sails.
sailing,39t6q8,hvyhitter,2,Mon Jun 15 10:38:34 2015 UTC,"I spent the last few years crewing on boats by myself, but recently acquired a boat with my girlfriend with the plan/dream of cruising the world. (Check out or series Three Sheets to the Wind if you want to see how that is progressing)  Boat ownership has definitely brought us together as we constantly have team projects that we work on together. It has also presented MANY challenges (haha) that most 'normal' couples wouldn't experience that really test the strength of your relationship. We don't live-aboard yet, but plan to in the near future when we really start moving the boat south.  I have over 30,000 sea miles from my various crew positions and have never really seen a massive freak wave out of nowhere, so they are extremely rare. They say that one in every seven waves is bigger, but I've never really seen them more than double the average. Obviously though, during a storm they are all huge and you just try your best to avoid sailing during storms. To get weather at sea, we would get GRIB updates using Satellite phone. There are also various SSB weather updates you can use. We followed the Pacific Puddle Jumpers nets when crossing the Pacific for weather (if not just to hear another voice, haha)."
sailing,39t6q8,ShaunSailing,2,Mon Jun 15 12:19:42 2015 UTC,"Oh man (red face) I forgot about you when I named my top 3. My wife and I watch yours too with GREAT interest. Ive got plans to meet you out in Lake Erie if you come cruising by. Ok, here, Ill pay your first night transient dockage at Edgewater marina if you come by on your way to the Atlantic. I will be updating my youtube channel soon (you can see the marina etc. Nicest one in Cleveland if you ask me 8 foot stone floating docks. The wifi sucks on the dock (5 meg down) but Ive got a hotspot with unlimited data. You are free to use that as well.   I need to redo my videos. (I cleaned them all off yesterday because they were unedited garbage) It was your comment somewhere else that guided me in the direction of where to look for software. I just found the JOY of creative commons music! Wow.   I videoed my first docking attempt with a 30 footer. It was bad. Originally I cut it all out and just edited it so it looked like my 50 mile journey ended with a nice smooth approach and then a smooth dock. I made 2-3 passes before I kinda rammed it and jumped off. (while my dad was ""yelling"" to ""Turn the boat"" so now that I owe this place a youtube video of this awesome single hand technique I can make a larger better video)  I also have my Amateur radio license and will probably be doing ARRL field day from the center of Lake Erie. :)   Happy sails man."

Happy sails!"
sailing,39t6q8,ShaunSailing,2,Wed Jun 17 02:34:45 2015 UTC,"Hi hvyhitter,  Thank you so much for welcoming our participation in the sailing subreddit!  My humblest apologies for not being able to reply sooner.  We have spent the past couple of weeks with very little internet access and have been pretty much cut off from news of the outside world as we sailed up the west coast of Ireland.  A few days ago we arrived in Oban, Scotland and tomorrow we're picking up Adam (remember from Season 1?) and his wife Kristi who are flying in from the States.  They will help us to sail on to Faroe.   We're really looking forward to filming another video series of this adventure!  For a month we'll have 2 sailing couples aboard! :)   It's been 21 years since I've lived on land, and in that time I think I've met more couples living aboard boats than I have living on land. :)  It's an interesting question on whether boating bring couples together, but I'm not sure how to answer...  I think that if a man and a woman are really meant to be together then it doesn't matter what they're doing.  And if a relationship has problems on land, then going to sea is definitely not going to fix it.    It does help immensely that both Monique and I love the lifestyle we've chosen...to live on a sailboat and spend our lives exploring the planet, immersing ourselves in other cultures, each year calling a different country home, and most importantly making friends.    Freak waves in the middle of the ocean...   The times of my life when I've been the most scared have been when trapped in the worst storms far offshore.  There are lots of ways to try to avoid heavy weather, like sailing shorter distances between landfalls, only sailing at the right time of year when the probability of encountering a heavy storm is less, having a weather router via single side band radio or satellite phone to guide you while at sea, and I'm sure many more.  Usually we can make at least 100 nautical miles towards our destination in a 24 hour period.  So we estimate that a 1000 nautical mile voyage would take 10 days.  Before pushing off we always wait for a safer weather window, but weather forecasting is only really accurate for approximately 3 days out.  After that the chance of bad weather increases.  My personal philosophy has always been to have a boat that is designed and equipped for heavy weather as much as possible.   I believe that a skeg hung rudder is about 1000% times less likely to be ripped off than a spade rudder.  I believe that a very heavy displacement full keel hull can heave to in heavy weather far better than a lighter displacement fin keel hull.  I love our Jordan series drogue.     If we get trapped in the worst storm imaginable hundreds of miles away from land then we heave to, put out the drogue, and go down below and pray that it won't be long before the storm passes over us.  It will eventually pass.  Congratulations on paying cash for your boat!  There's no way we could ever go cruising if we were in debt."
sailing,39s9zp,GnarlyBear,1 point,Sun Jun 14 07:05:05 2015 UTC,Their videos are by far my favorite sailing videos. Does anyone know of other channels that are similar besides Sailing La Vagabonde?
sailing,39s9zp,Leynal030,1 point,Sun Jun 14 21:04:13 2015 UTC,This is interesting enough as they go through the Panama canal and they guy once tried a solo round the world speed sail.
sailing,39s8k6,IsailSunfish,4,Sun Jun 14 06:42:26 2015 UTC,Nice system. And the music really suits the boat!
sailing,39s8k6,mypantsareonmyhead,2,Sun Jun 14 06:46:55 2015 UTC,That looks about as ready to reef as a junk rig sail. Very cool.
sailing,39s8k6,-Anders,2,Sun Jun 14 08:46:27 2015 UTC,I would like to see the roller part on the gaff. That way you still have access to the boom along its length and not just the sail.
sailing,39s8k6,Rab1515,2,Sun Jun 14 13:58:17 2015 UTC,"Tricky to do with a lug sail though, the first roll would foul the halyard attachment.  Ditto for the gaff span on a typical gaffer.  Unless it rolled inside the spar, which could be a lot of weight aloft. I can also envisage it being a good thing to have access to the roller mechanism at the tack in case of jamming."
sailing,39s8k6,scoobertron,2,Sun Jun 14 15:28:54 2015 UTC,"It's the same system Matt Layden used on his sharpies. For now I'll stick with slab reefing on my balanced lug. (Nothing to go wrong really, and it takes me seconds to reef.)"
sailing,39s8k6,hilomania,2,Sun Jun 14 18:15:36 2015 UTC,"That's what I was thinking too, looks like the reefing system Matt used on his Paradox design."
sailing,39s8k6,K_S_ON,1 point,Sun Jun 14 22:40:06 2015 UTC,"a same kind of system is used by us by waterscouts on a lelievlet. if you pull back on the boom you can turn the boom. its a bit weird to discribe by words, and i can't find a picture"
sailing,39s8k6,pyropocalypse,1 point,Sun Jun 14 20:33:49 2015 UTC,Roller booms used to be pretty common on marconi rigs in the mid sixties through the late seventies.  Most have been converted to slab reefing but there are still a few out there.
sailing,39s8k6,texasrigger,1 point,Sun Jun 14 22:06:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, was just reading Eric Allcard and had read Trekka before that. Both had roller furling booms and it seemed like they were super handy for singlehanding. Always wondered why folks stopped making them."
sailing,39s8k6,reyomnwahs,1 point,Mon Jun 15 23:11:27 2015 UTC,"For a couple of reasons I think.  First, I'll get the controversial statement out of the way:  All main furling systems are terrible.  They are huge compromises to gain convenience and in my experience it's not a big gain in convenience.    With a roll up boom you dont get a good reef shape generally.   There are also practical limitations.  End boom sheeting only, no vang, limited outhaul options.  They only really work well(ish) with a bolt rope sail.  Modern roll up booms overcome most of those problems with the roll up mechanism housed in an oversized boom (in boom furling) but those are heavy and cumbersome and the sail can bind on the boom rolling it in an out.  Back to my initial statement.  Mainsail roller systems just don't work well."
sailing,39s8k6,texasrigger,1 point,Tue Jun 16 00:40:46 2015 UTC,"That's about what I figured, and you seemed the right person to ask. =)  The in-mast furling on Hunter and Beneteau also looks wicked complicated, although at least it wouldn't have much effect on sail shape, presumably."
sailing,39s8k6,reyomnwahs,2,Tue Jun 16 00:56:56 2015 UTC,"In mast systems really aren't complicated.  In effect they are similar to jib furlers except the line wraps around a screw shaped piece rather than a drum.  The foil is very similar and just floats in the mast.  The problem is that you need a very flat sail with vertical battens or a hollow leech to furl well so you are starting with a compromised sail shape.    The mast has to be straight as an arrow for them to roll well which is particularly bad with Hunter and their B&R rig which likes a bent mast.  80% of problem furlers are on mast that aren't tuned well for the furler.    The mast and gear are heavy.  One time I had two masts in the yard, both 62.5 feet long and both off of cruising boats.  Rigged up the conventional mast weighed 600 lbs.  The furling mast was 1200 lbs.  Worst is safety.  Any sail handling system where you can't get a sail DOWN in a couple of minutes is a real liability.  Most in mast furlers require fiddling with access plates, hard to reach shackles, etc."
sailing,39r2dd,FlickrPaul,5,Sat Jun 13 22:43:22 2015 UTC,...you use an old snow shovel handle for your tiller extension.
sailing,39r2dd,Guygan,7,Sat Jun 13 22:44:03 2015 UTC,I don't think that's a shovel handle. I've seen tiller extensions like that before.
sailing,39r2dd,thatsailingguy,3,Sat Jun 13 22:46:28 2015 UTC,"I was there when it was built, it is a shovel handle from a Big Foot shovel."
sailing,39r2dd,pseud0nym,6,Sun Jun 14 00:06:53 2015 UTC,"There are tiller handle's like this though so It's not super obvious. That said I've used all sorts of things as extensions, a good broom handle seems to be my goto."

sailing,39r8s4,chrispt,1 point,Sat Jun 13 23:45:24 2015 UTC,"It's a single trap dinghy with no spinnaker, at least as I used to race it some years ago. Usually the crew traps out and the skipper drives from the cockpit, and usually the skipper runs the mainsheet and the crew the jib, although one good boat I knew had a big guy as crew and a small woman as skipper, and he ran the mainsheet just because he was stronger.  It's a nice boat, but for me at least the reason to buy one would be if there were a C15 fleet nearby to race. If not, I think a Hobie 16 or similar beachcat is a lot more fun, just as a day sailor for blasting around on, and not much more money or trouble.  Where are you? What kind of sailing do you want to do?"
sailing,39r8s4,K_S_ON,1 point,Sun Jun 14 02:36:59 2015 UTC,"We are in Richmond, Virginia sailing on a lake here. We'd like something that not only could we race but could also cruise around the lake. The guy is selling it for $1200."
sailing,39r8s4,K_S_ON,1 point,Sun Jun 14 15:44:48 2015 UTC,"$1200 is ok if it's a good boat with good boards and sails in an area with a C15 fleet, or at least it would be a pretty good price in the Dallas area, where I used to sail them.  OTOH, in your area for not much more money:  https://richmond.craigslist.org/boa/5063227504.html  Faster, more fun to sail, probably at least as much racing available, more parts available, holds resale value at a predictable rate.   Is there a C15 fleet near you?"
sailing,39r8s4,K_S_ON,1 point,Sun Jun 14 16:23:31 2015 UTC,I'm not aware of a fleet nearby. I think one of the clubs here does a lot with Flying Scots. We do a lot of Portsmouth racing on the lake so I could still race.
sailing,39r8s4,K_S_ON,1 point,Sun Jun 14 16:31:36 2015 UTC,"I would imagine a FS would be twice the price or more, so that's probably out of your budget. If you want a dinghy to race Portsmouth, the C15 will be fine. It's a nice boat, I enjoyed crewing on them. Take a good look at the cb, rudder and sails; pretty generic advice, but still good.   Good luck with it!"

To do it correctly you do a continuous line splice, a very easy and quick job but as an alternative the article showed strippin back the covers a certain distance, stitching the cores together (very badly) and then taping the hell out of it with silicone tape making a stiff, ugly, bulky connection that is pretty much guaranteed to foul on almost everything it's supposed to run though."

sailing,39llkx,somegridplayer,1 point,Sun Jun 14 18:07:35 2015 UTC,"""covered with finlets"" what?  They're between 2nd dorsal and caudal fins of tuna, they're not covered in them. And they reduce drag, not aid in the creation of lift."
sailing,39llkx,apathy-sofa,0,Sun Jun 14 19:32:42 2015 UTC,"So run along about a third of their body, which represents substantially more of their body than the tubercle portion of a pectoral fin to a humpback.  And yes, while they do reduce drag, they do also create lift:   Magnuson (1970) proposed that the finlets direct water across the pronounced central caudal keel of tuna and thereby contribute to any lift forces produced at the keel.  ... Alternatively, the data presented here on the timing of finlet movement relative to tail motion suggest an alternative, interesting possibility for thrust enhancement by the finlets. The finlets reach their maximum lateral excursion as the tail is decelerating during the second quarter of the tailbeat to one side (Fig. 11). Flow directed across the caudal peduncle into the midline of the tail could add momentum to the center of the vortex forming at the tail (V2 in Fig. 12). The addition of relatively high-velocity fluid to the developing vortex will increase circulation and thus increase net thrust.   http://jeb.biologists.org/content/203/15/2247.full.pdf"
sailing,39llkx,somegridplayer,1 point,Sun Jun 14 20:04:17 2015 UTC,"Ctrl-F Lift doesn't make you right. They thought that they had some impact on the caudal keels tuna have (relatively minor impact) but their major use is  they reduce vortex induced drag at the tail therefore increasing thrust.  1/3 of their body?

sailing,39llkx,apathy-sofa,1 point,Sun Jun 14 20:27:32 2015 UTC,"It's not finding the conclusions that makes me right, it's the evidence gathered by the scientists that does.   I read the extent of the article, and understood it. It is clear from it that finlets likely produce lift, albeit indirectly, in addition to reducing drag. If you disagree with the scientists then you should take it up with them.   And yes, the distance along a tuna's length that has finlets is about a third of its overall length. What figure do you come up with when you examine an image of one? 40%?  I know you're too dug in here to admit that you made a mistake, even though nobody expects you to know the finer points of fish propulsion (something that nobody knows all of). And the fact that you're attacking my motives rather than discussing the issue gives me even less hope of this being a productive exchange, as do your pointless down votes (obviously nobody else is following this exchange).

sailing,39npyo,jmartyg,2,Sat Jun 13 03:33:57 2015 UTC,"It looks like the bottom block for your backstay is pointing the wrong direction. The clam cleat should be pointing inwards so you're not reaching around to adjust it.   A simple starting point for rigging a boat that size would be to adjust the side stays so they are somewhat slack on the leeward side when your're pointing in wind that is in the upper limits of what you're wanting to sail in. I'm unsure if it's fractional or full rig, so if it's fractional, keep the forestay about the same as the side stays, so that way when you tighten the backstay, it will flatten the main. (think of it like pulling the string on the bow and arrow, the bow being the mast and your bowarm being the forestay.) If it's full rig, I like to have the forestay even a little looser than that, so I can pull the mast back with the backstay to get more control on the leading edge of the jib.  On a fractional rig, the backstay is used when going upwind in big air to flatten the main and change the center of effort of the main. It generally doesn't do anything with the jib(as your forestay is already tight). If your boat is well tuned, it is used most to control weather helm.  On a full rig without a babystay, it's used to stiffen the whole rig and reduce wind spillage when going upwind. There is not as much control in a full rig backstay than in a fractional.  As it seems your spreaders are not raked, but your lower stays are aft of the mast step, so you may be able to have the back stay very slack when needed.  Backstays are best slacked when going downwind to get the mast as tall as possible."
sailing,39npyo,Guygan,2,Sat Jun 13 13:50:24 2015 UTC,"This is WAAAY too much info for someone who is new to sailing, and is just trying to learn how to put their boat together.  OP: although this is good info, ignore it. All you need to do is make sure that the mast is straight (fore and aft, and side to side), and the stays should all be snug. You won't need to do any adjusting of the backstay when you are just learning. Just snug it up. As the others said, turn the block around so that the line leads towards the cockpit just to make your life easier. Inspect the line in those pulleys carefully for wear and damage, and replace the line if needed."

As with anything sailboat related, find out if the boat was raced (more than likely, that is what they are built for) and if so how hard... if it was at all a champion at any point it has been raced pretty hard. It might be just fine, especially if the price is right.   Personally I love the V-15. Great little boats for man and woman, or adult and child (or sometimes children).

sailing,39n6o2,FlickrPaul,1 point,Sat Jun 13 03:39:42 2015 UTC,Like yardstick? If yes I think its just a multiplier for the time sailed. Sorry if you meant something else
sailing,39m6o4,I_would_hit_that_,1 point,Fri Jun 12 18:39:22 2015 UTC,Only 1400 nautical miles.  I wish I had the time budget for that kind of trip.
sailing,39mjn3,its_treV,3,Fri Jun 12 20:09:25 2015 UTC,"I am not trying to bust your bubble, but this is exactly the wrong boat to LEARN on...if it was a car, this would be a Lotus.  Fast and nimble...not much room to make a mistake.    Expensive Square top main that can not be reefed, the skinny fin keel that needs speed to start functioning, a Carbon Fiber Rig...man I could go on and on...  A J22 or a J24 are great boats to learn on, this is a boat to race.  Sexy little boat, but it will bite you....just like a tiger."
sailing,39mjn3,TheShaytoon,3,Fri Jun 12 20:32:41 2015 UTC,"I am not trying to bust your bubble, but this is exactly the wrong boat to LEARN on   I read the submission headline as sarcastic."

sailing,39mjn3,sol_robeson,1 point,Sun Jun 14 13:30:33 2015 UTC,I'm not alone!
sailing,39lkgv,jeffrife,3,Fri Jun 12 16:11:45 2015 UTC,"Nope.  The Ranger 33 weighs around 11K pounds, and that is some serious weight (not including the trailer).  The Silverado could probably tow it around the yacht club yard, but it would not be able to stop it on the road.  I have a V8 F250 that can trailer 10K pounds, and I sometimes get nervous stopping the 5K boat behind it."
sailing,39lkgv,TheShaytoon,1 point,Fri Jun 12 16:23:09 2015 UTC,"Ok cool, that shoots that idea in the foot. Not buying a new truck to tow the boat, haha.  On to looking for lighter boats. Thanks!"
sailing,39lkgv,tkaraszewski,1 point,Fri Jun 12 16:25:52 2015 UTC,Hobie 33.
sailing,39lkgv,simple2fast,1 point,Fri Jun 12 16:33:27 2015 UTC,"Hobie 33   Thanks, I'll look into her! I believe there is a Hobie 30 currently in 2nd place at the R2AK and it's getting beat to hell but doing awesomely!"
sailing,39lkgv,SkiMonkey98,3,Fri Jun 12 16:38:10 2015 UTC,"depends on how fast you want or need to drive that 5 miles.  Weight of towing vehicle most allows safe stopping and turning.  But if you go 5 mph the whole way, you could probably safely tow with any of those.  I guess I would choose whichever of those towing machines is heaviest.  There is another factor which is tongue weight.  The vehicle has to support the tongue weight whilst still keeping enough weight on it's front wheels for control.  It's probably pretty cheap to run a large truck for 3 hours."
sailing,39lkgv,POTUS,2,Fri Jun 12 16:36:03 2015 UTC,It's probably pretty cheap to run a large truck for 3 hours   Hadn't considered that. Probably a couple hundred if that and it would only be twice a year
sailing,39lkgv,POTUS,1 point,Fri Jun 12 16:40:23 2015 UTC,If it's only twice a year you can definitely pay either a commercial boat mover or someone with a big truck to haul it.
sailing,39lkgv,atypicalbnc,2,Sat Jun 13 01:02:08 2015 UTC,"How often would you need to move the boat?  I don't think it would cost much to have it towed, certainly less than a truck loan payment."
sailing,39lkgv,JETEXAS,2,Fri Jun 12 17:31:29 2015 UTC,Twice a year and about 5 miles
sailing,39lkgv,JETEXAS,2,Fri Jun 12 17:32:13 2015 UTC,"Call any tow truck company.  It'll probably cost you $50 or $100.  You'll probably spend more at the marina doing the haul out/launch and all the preparations.  Hell, there would probably be someone at the marina that you could slip $20 to to haul the boat all of 5 miles.  Easy money for him, easy win for you."
sailing,39lkgv,thatsailingguy,1 point,Fri Jun 12 17:35:31 2015 UTC,Good point. A case of beer goes a long way around my parts for getting stuff done
sailing,39lkgv,reyomnwahs,2,Fri Jun 12 17:40:05 2015 UTC,"At $2/mile for a 9.5"" beam boat (looked up the going rate), I think you have the best idea. I'm sure there is a min amount though"
sailing,39lkgv,reyomnwahs,1 point,Fri Jun 12 17:36:43 2015 UTC,"The sailing club I'm in uses F350s to tow our boats each year. Our heaviest boat is a 11.5k pound NY 36. Factoring in trailer weight, we're just hitting/exceeding the limits for the truck."
sailing,39jckc,tripnull,6,Fri Jun 12 03:14:04 2015 UTC,"Are you familiar with the ""Catalina Smile"" problem on some of these boats? Definitely something to check."
sailing,39jckc,sciencebum,6,Fri Jun 12 05:02:36 2015 UTC,That's a pre 1988 issue.
sailing,39jckc,TrojanThunder,2,Fri Jun 12 05:16:23 2015 UTC,"Luckily, the one I'm interested in is a 1996."
sailing,39jckc,texasrigger,4,Fri Jun 12 05:57:44 2015 UTC,"Glad you like the 30!  That's a great value for the dollar and catalina is about the only make of boat where you can get parts, rigging, etc. directly from them which is huge for a first boat owner (a big part of my job is tracking down or fabricating obscure parts so being able to find them yourself means you don't have to pay someone like me)  That boat is available in a couple of different configurations.  I'd recommend standard keel and rig but it's just a preference.  I'm also glad you are spending a little money now on a boat ready to go vs. spending ALOT of money later trying to restore a cheap boat.  GET A SURVEY!!! and get it done by someone with a good reputation."
sailing,39jckc,texasrigger,2,Fri Jun 12 13:14:10 2015 UTC,"Yes sir! I am in the process of scheduling a survey for it now. I am prepared to spend a couple thousand pulling it out and getting a thorough survey, even though the couple that owns it have really taken good care of it."
sailing,39jckc,JETEXAS,2,Fri Jun 12 14:34:30 2015 UTC,Wise man.
sailing,39jckc,edzstudios,3,Fri Jun 12 15:00:21 2015 UTC,I feel like every 3' of length on a sailboat is the equivalent of adding another bedroom to an apartment. It makes a big difference.
sailing,39jckc,sam_bg,3,Fri Jun 12 13:06:05 2015 UTC,"I just bought a Catalina 30 mk III (same as your boat if it's a 1996 model).  My wife and I will be living on it as we sail down the east coast to the Bahamas. It's a great boat and because it is so popular, resources/knowledge/parts are easy to come by.    A few things to watch for:   the Catalina smile (separation between the keel & hull).  Mostly an issue in older boats, but still possible on the mkIII Compression block rot/failure - The C30 has a deck stepped mast, and the load is carried by a compression post down to a block glassed into the hull. If water gets through the glass, the block will rot and the mast will start to sink.  Check the front of the bilge (where the block is) for signs of deterioration or cracking from the mast compression.  Again, more an issue on older boats, but check it anyway.  Deck hardware: As with any 20 year old boat, it is entirely possible that there are leaks at through-deck fittings.  These should be addressed immediately else they can lead to core-rot.  We just replaced & rebedded all the stanchions on our 1994 Catalina 30.  That was a royal PITA - the stanchions are not easily accessible.  Required removing a lot of trim/cabinetry and cutting away pieces of the headliner to get access to the stanchion bolts. Also rebedded the traveller, which was much easier.   Steering quadrant cover - on our boat the panel covering the steering quadrant with the inspection port for access to the emergency tiller was never properly sealed and had completely delaminated. The entire core was soggy and rotten.  Just today I finished carving out the old rotten core, and cleaning the fiberglass in preparation for re-coring and re-fiberglassing.  I would suspect other mkIIIs may have similar issues (if the panel was not sealed properly)   Don't let all that scare you away though - all boats have their issues, the C30 is a great vessel.  we love ours!"
sailing,39jckc,sam_bg,2,Sat Jun 13 04:05:17 2015 UTC,"I hope the offer pans out for you!  Did you find a lot of the boats listed in 48° North weren't also listed in Yachtworld and Craigslist? I'll be looking in about a year, so it's good to hear where served you well.  Do you know where you'll moor your boat? I'm hoping to secure a telecommute job before I buy a liveaboard boat in order to open up my possibilities.  If you decide to take additional ASA classes, I highly recommend San Juan Sailing in Bellingham. I recently took 103 & 104 up there. Both were great."
sailing,39jckc,rektALproLAPSE,2,Fri Jun 12 06:25:27 2015 UTC,"I actually found that 48° North had a larger selection of nice sailboats while being a little more on the expensive side, and craigslist has a bunch of shitty, beat up, boats. In fact, every boat I went to look at that was over $20,000 from craigslist was beat to hell. Maybe it's different when you get above $30,000.    I am looking at mooring in Everett since my brother wants to go to school there, but I would REALLY like to moor Kirkland, since the whole town is on the waterfront.    I will be looking to take the upper level ASA classes later in the summer, so I'll check them out, thanks!"
sailing,39jckc,jarvis513,1 point,Fri Jun 12 14:41:00 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Good info.  The city of Kirkland prohibits liveaboards. So does the city of Kenmore. If either one allowed liveaboards, I might already be living aboard, since I work in the Juanita area."
sailing,39jckc,texasrigger,2,Fri Jun 12 20:16:31 2015 UTC,"cat30 '82 owner here  great little boat, and spending a few nights on it is nice. I definitely would need a more comfortable berth matrial  though. are you going to be in a slip? If so, you'll like it I think.   My only complaint is the angled floor in the galley. I love to cook, and it annoys the shit out of me."
sailing,39jckc,SchoonerKat1,4,Fri Jun 12 06:41:50 2015 UTC,"I had excellent luck replacing the V berth mattress for $50.  I watched craigslist very carefully for a used latex mattress. I found a cal king, used in a guest room, with a thick pillow top cover on both sides. When I stripped the cover off, I was left with new, unmolested latex foam. I cut it up with a turkey knife, and covered it with some cheap material.  Best improvement to my boat in 2 years."
sailing,39jckc,woodycanuck,1 point,Fri Jun 12 13:03:45 2015 UTC,Most mattress companies will make a custom spring mattress as well for that real bed feel but of course that's more money.
sailing,39jckc,enuct,2,Fri Jun 12 15:04:03 2015 UTC,"Just going to say that you can get loans on older boats, it's just harder. I got a loan on a 1980 custom cold-molded race boat (with heavy modification).  Both Key Bank and Banner Bank (in Washington which sounds like you are) don't have an age limit on boats they will loan on. I ended up going with Banner Bank and am so far quite happy with them."
sailing,39jckc,jahf1sh,1 point,Fri Jun 12 09:46:02 2015 UTC,"You mentioned some sailing simulators in your last post. Can you point me toward ones that are on the more educational side? I have found a few simluators, but they seem geared to racing and competing against others."
sailing,39jckc,jahf1sh,1 point,Fri Jun 12 14:56:13 2015 UTC,"Cat30's are good boats, I raced on one for a long time. Hope you enjoy it, I am still drooling over my 30footer."

sailing,39jckc,GnarlyBear,2,Fri Jun 12 14:50:36 2015 UTC,I worked in a marina with a high live aboard population. Try to go somewhere that has decent showers that are close to where you will be moored otherwise it is absolute hell in the winter. There were some very miserable looking people stomping through the rain in flipflops and a towel.
sailing,39jckc,BFoskett,-8,Sat Jun 13 01:52:47 2015 UTC,I looked at a few 33'-35' ships   No you didn't.

sailing,39k5l8,planeray,5,Fri Jun 12 08:08:10 2015 UTC,those are quite cool.
sailing,39k5l8,yomamato,1 point,Fri Jun 12 13:39:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm into them."
sailing,39k5l8,Craption,2,Sat Jun 13 13:48:28 2015 UTC,"Is there a fashion forward sailing specific brand? People seem to wear either the classic 'yacht club' or beachwear look.  I'm talking about cruising wear, not utility clothes for storms etc.  Guess I'm thinking of how the surf brands have a good mix of utility and social fashion."
sailing,39k5l8,GnarlyBear,1 point,Fri Jun 12 12:04:17 2015 UTC,Sperry has everything from the classic boat shoe to flip flops to converse looking shoes to running shoes. Adidas also has some running shoe type boat shoes that aren't bad.
sailing,39k5l8,JETEXAS,1 point,Fri Jun 12 13:40:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah but even they don't have a modern aesthetic.  I am thinking of a Nike in golf comparison. When they entered the market they took the clothing to a more athletic design which all other brands had to step up to.  I would love to see Billabong, Dakine etc get into sailing gear. I know lots of general fashion is suitable but its always nice to have a niche brand in a sport you are interested in."

sailing,39k5l8,hvyhitter,2,Fri Jun 12 21:22:50 2015 UTC,"Those do look ridiculous.   Ive bought 5 pairs of boat shoes in the past 3 months.   Gold Cup Sperry Topsiders (My first pair the insole came apart right in the middle and it rolled down and was uncomfortable) I returned that pair and the new ones they sent me. I could see they were going to do the same also there was a huge flaw in the stitching in the front of the left shoe right on top. You could tell the person who sewed them like screwed up. I returned them for credit.   I got some sperry topsiders that were tan canvas and had anchors on them on clearance. I kept them. They cut the back of my heel but I am sure they will be nice when they break in. (whatever year THAT is)   As a follow up to my sperrys I decided to get a pair of Sebagos.   WOW is that leather hard. I did the 24 hour salt water thing too. Still hard.. still cutting into my heel. Not comfortable to walk around in. HOWEVER the grip on my boat deck is AMAZING.  So when these break in I am sure I will love them.   Now to the best ""Boating"" shoes I have that feel like I am walking on a cloud. grip the boat perfectly. and are cool and comfortable. straight out of the box.   Got one pair on a clearance price. I think 20 dollars shipped   http://www.crocs.com/crocs-mens-santa-cruz/10128,default,pd.html?cid=261&cgid=men-footwear#start=1  THEY ARE AMAZING. So I bought another pair.  Yup.. Crocs.   Here is a pic of my enjoying them.   http://i.imgur.com/ovuFMa6.jpg"
sailing,39k5l8,muyuu,2,Fri Jun 12 13:06:18 2015 UTC,Might give them a shot.
sailing,39k5l8,hvyhitter,1 point,Fri Jun 12 14:59:33 2015 UTC,I swear they are the most comfortable shoes I have ever owned. They have a thick sole too. So if you slam your foot into a block or something it just absorbs it. SO soft and comfortable..  I went to my boat at lunch (2 hour lunch break oops) and had my shoes on at lunch.   completely changed my view of crocs. I think my hate is those plastic ones that have no backs. Ugh.   Let me know if you wind up getting them and liking them.

sailing,39hfmy,iamnotadoghumanhybri,2,Thu Jun 11 23:27:00 2015 UTC,"Please focus on the safety portion!   Many years ago at the beach with family and a friends of family family. They had a Hobie that had been dropped off the trailer somehow. Had some holes/faults in the glass. Supposedly was fixed.   Late in the week weather breaks and the Cat gets launched from the beach. Nice breeze, sun is out, two adults and a gaggle of kids. Surprisingly everyone had jackets on. Get Cat cranked up and are running 15+ knots EASY a couple hundred yards from the beach. Downwind pontoon is digging a bit as we are keeled over and hauling the mail.   Having an amazing time remember it so clearly. As we were running, suddenly I'm airborne. A second or two later refocus on the situation and realize I'm airborne and have hang-time. I can almost see my house from here! Eventually I hit the water and remember how long it took to swim back to the boat (which is now fully capsized, mast reaching for the bottom.  Turns out the fiberglass in the pontoon fractured and catastrophic failure. It opened up immediately filling (at 15+ knots) with delicious Atlantic seawater. Pontoon went from floating to concrete-filled sea anchor. When it stopped turned the Cat into a catapult. As we were all sitting on the high-side it flung us a long ways.  I remember at first being confused but determined to make it back to the boat to help or at least not be a problem. Once my little brain a wrapped itself around what had happened? Then I was absolutely terrified."

sailing,39jop4,texasrigger,1 point,Fri Jun 12 11:50:09 2015 UTC,The topping lift for the boom was still attached. Could it be one for the spinnaker?
sailing,39jop4,texasrigger,3,Fri Jun 12 14:31:47 2015 UTC,Spin pole topping lift.  J24's don't have any spare spin or jib halyards.  The mast wont accomodate them.
sailing,39jop4,texasrigger,1 point,Fri Jun 12 15:21:51 2015 UTC,Do those run through the mast?
sailing,39jop4,thatsailingguy,2,Fri Jun 12 16:04:29 2015 UTC,"Yep, pole topping lift is an internal line.  It enters the mast above the spreaders but well below the jib and spin halyards."
sailing,39jop4,Survove,1 point,Fri Jun 12 18:16:01 2015 UTC,"I am pretty sure the one on the J24 I raced was internal, it's to lift the pole for the spinaker."
sailing,39jop4,svzephyr1981,1 point,Fri Jun 12 17:48:56 2015 UTC,It's gotta be for the pole.  Is there also a block on the deck for a foreguy?
sailing,39jop4,texasrigger,1 point,Fri Jun 12 18:14:54 2015 UTC,"Pics?  Although unlikely, some racing boats have an additional line down the front of the mast which is used to change the shape of the mast while racing.  There would be a fitting on the foredeck for it."

Undo those screws on the stainless strap at the bottom of the mast.  Get some additional purchase from your block & tackle system (masts weigh more than you think), give the step a few taps with a BFRH.  I bet it's just sitting on the step & corroded."

On my O'Day 23 it couldn't weight more than 65 pounds (maybe 30 kilograms) Do you think I'd have any problems just taking a saw-zaw to the step?  My primary concern is that the mast doesn't sit flush on the step but rather inserts itself somehow into the step or deck.  Any thoughts?  Okay, just checked out the strappy thing with screws at the base of the mast.  Hmm... should have thought to take that off sooner.  Good idea.  Perhaps the step sits inside of that mast, and those screws hold it on... I don't know.  I'll definitely remove those screws."
sailing,39hrw8,bplipschitz,2,Thu Jun 11 21:22:13 2015 UTC,"The mast on my Hunter 26.5 is deck-stepped, and sits on an aluminum extrusion that fits up inside the mast a couple of inches.  Easy to get corroded if your is similar, I would think."
sailing,39hrw8,jdubes,1 point,Thu Jun 11 21:40:25 2015 UTC,Wonderful!  Thank you for this bit of insight.  I was concerned that the piece that it sat on may fit up inside it.  I'm going to look into prying it off... first get the screws off.
sailing,39hrw8,POTUS,1 point,Thu Jun 11 23:13:58 2015 UTC,Make sure the mast isn't connected and change your block setup. See my note above.
sailing,39hrw8,POTUS,2,Sat Jun 13 03:08:35 2015 UTC,"Take that strap off. If it still doesn't move, a pry bar is a better alternative to cutting things. Get the tip of the pry bar under the mast and lever it if you can, or tap it with a hammer to wedge it under.  Heat would also be preferable to cutting. Not too much heat, but a good heat gun will expand the mast off of the step and possibly free it.  Cutting would always be my last resort."
sailing,39hrw8,jdubes,1 point,Thu Jun 11 21:45:42 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice.  I'll definitely try the prying and banging first.  I don't have a heat gun, but I'll check harbor freight and see if they have any good deals."
sailing,39hrw8,jdubes,3,Thu Jun 11 23:16:01 2015 UTC,"I would probably do the stupid/risky thing and try a propane or Mapp torch. You can get one at Lowe's for a few bucks. This could get too hot, though, which risks seriously weakening the mast or maybe even cracking it. On the other hand, if it is just frozen in place by friction or corrosion, this is almost guaranteed to work. I'd never suggest anyone else do it, but I don't like when an inanimate object tells me ""no""."
sailing,39hrw8,jdubes,1 point,Fri Jun 12 00:18:35 2015 UTC,"I think you and I may have the same feeling about inanimate objects talking to us in negative manners.  I would never tell someone to start cutting away at there mast because they are trying to get it off... but i'm totally considering it.  I think the idea of a cheap torch may come in handy.  I agree risky... but I'm a cheap ass, and feel the risk is small compared to the reward.  Thanks for the ideas, and encouragement.  If the wright brothers, and other men of history listened to all the inanimate ""No's"" the world just wouldn't be the same."

You can't pull enough with that single Home Depot block. I had plenty of corrision at the base of my mast as well.  This is what i bought.  This is funny, i even had the same blue rope.

Argh..... none of them had a problem thing like you are showing.  And I don't have time to order one.  So I just bought 3 more pulleys, and some clips, and another rope.... this time a pretty yellow one with black strips  (it was in the same tub as the other two ropes I bought from them).    Anyways I built my own 4 fold purchase block setup.  Here is a picture:  I'm quite confident it will work.... however I didn't get a chance to try yesterday.   Now you are actually exciting me with this thought of being able to simply get it lifted using the purchase system.  I told my wife yesterday that perhaps this would make it possible alone... and now you are confirming the thought.  I'm really getting excited and hoping that I can lift it off.  I also got a big dead blow hammer to knock the hell out of the mast step once I get a good amount of tension on the lines.  I'll let you know how it goes.  Thanks a lot for your help!"

sailing,39hrw8,texasrigger,1 point,Sat Jun 13 23:33:19 2015 UTC,"One very important thing to note, you will need a fairly long piece of rope to cover the 4 purchase blocks.  I can't remember exactly by the rope was either 100 or 200 feet.  I used clothesline rope.  I've lowered and raised my mast at least 10 with this setup."
sailing,39hrw8,texasrigger,1 point,Sat Jun 13 17:27:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I figured with the more pulleys I'd definitely need more length.  I actually just bought 3 3/8''-100foot ropes from home depot.  10 bucks a piece!   Thanks for the reminder though!"
sailing,39hrw8,tkaraszewski,3,Sat Jun 13 23:32:11 2015 UTC,Put some heat and spray lubricant on the bottom of the mast then jiggle the fuck out of it and it should come off. DON'T CUT IT
sailing,39hrw8,tkaraszewski,1 point,Thu Jun 11 23:07:56 2015 UTC,"Right on bro.  I'll give that a go first for sure.  I'm hoping that I can take off the screws and that the step is actually inserted a bit into the mast and hopefully that is just corroded a bit.  But still, If I can't get it off like this, how much damage is it going to really do?  If I need a new mast completely or a new step?  They can't be too bad, can they?"
sailing,39hrw8,TheShaytoon,3,Thu Jun 11 23:18:06 2015 UTC,"That step is a cast aluminum piece that is lag screwed to the deck.  It has a lip that will extend 1"" to 1 1/2"" in to the mast.  There shouldn't be any fasteners holding the two together, it's simply a slip fit.  It is not unusual at all for corrosion to stick them together.  I would NOT cut off the step as it's difficult and expensive to find a replacement.  Increase the purchase in your tackle and take it down to the winch on your mast.  If it still wont budge and you have to cut it cut through the mast about 1 1/2"" above the deck.  Once the mast is down cut the mast back another 1/2"" and make your cut absolutely square.  Remove the old step from the deck and cut the old bit of mast off of it with a hack saw.  Fashion a wood (mahogany, white oak, or teak) that is 2"" thick to regain what you lost on the mast.  When you are ready to put it all back the wood goes first and then the step gets screwed down all the way through the wood in to the deck.  You'll probably have a little PVC stand pipe in the middle that will complicate things slighty but it's not a difficult job."

I will certainly follow your advice, as it makes lots of logical and systemic sense, and you seem to be that expert I was looking for.   I understand everything that you said, except this one part: What does Increase the purchase in my tackle mean?  Does that mean to lower the tackle with a line?  Does it mean to lower the line attached to the tackle?"
sailing,39hrw8,TheShaytoon,1 point,Fri Jun 12 15:47:21 2015 UTC,I was just recommending that you increase your lifting power and try that first to see if it will break loose.  Wouldn't do a torch there as some have recommended as the aluminum will conduct the heat right to the fiberglass but some whacks with a mallet might help break up the corrosion and free it.  The cutting I suggested is last resort but it's not a big deal if you have to resort to it.  Standby and I'll post a pic of one I did recently.
sailing,39hrw8,TheShaytoon,1 point,Fri Jun 12 17:56:40 2015 UTC,"Understood.  Thank you very much.  I explained the idea to my wife, and she agreed.

sailing,39hrw8,dubbgs,1 point,Fri Jun 12 17:59:16 2015 UTC,I believe I have an old step at the shop so you can picture how it looks in there.  You can use a wood compound mitersaw to cut that mast really square once you have it down. That's why I suggested cutting that last half inch off once the mast is down.
sailing,39hrw8,admiralranga,1 point,Fri Jun 12 18:20:27 2015 UTC,"Understood.  Thanks for the advice.  My plan is to setup a purchase and get some leverage on the mast.

sailing,39e6hr,ambww4,5,Thu Jun 11 12:12:54 2015 UTC,"I think we're going to start seeing them placing way higher as the legs get shorter in Europe.  The long ocean legs really haven't been good for them, but they frequently win or place higher up in the pack in the in-port races.  They're seriously some of the most aggressive sailors I've ever seen during the in-port races.  I'm not sure why the long ocean legs have been so particularly hard on them, though.  I don't know if it's an experience issue or a mental/physical stamina issue or what."
sailing,39e6hr,Thjoth,2,Thu Jun 11 13:39:45 2015 UTC,"I think it might be the aggresivenss, in part, that is their downfall on the longer legs. They take really creative risks that sometimes pay off (in this leg, for example, when they went further off shore). These risks can pay big, but strung together over a longer period of time, more are likely to cost than pay.   It is clearly not a matter of boat handling (they have proven that in the in-port races) or stamina. This leg, while short, was brutal. I think it is mostly a strategy problem. They are genius strategists, but consistency might pay more than genius on the long legs."
sailing,39e6hr,hockj,3,Thu Jun 11 14:09:09 2015 UTC,I believe they said one of the issues is they don't really have a set skipper. That has been causing some tactical issues on the longer legs.

sailing,39e6hr,markus_b,2,Thu Jun 11 20:48:17 2015 UTC,"As much as I like the sentiment, in long haul ocean racing it is a significant factor, both because of the size of the sails that have to be trimmed/furled/set and because of the weight of the gear that has to be moved from one side of the boat to the other every tack (referred to as 'stacking').  Because of that, all-female teams are often allowed extra personnel to compensate.  The male teams in the VOR have 8 sailors plus an onboard reporter.  I believe Team SCA has 11 sailors plus their OBR."

sailing,39g8ae,everyday-scientist,3,Thu Jun 11 16:22:29 2015 UTC,"I think the answer is very obvious: you help if you can do so without putting yourself or others at risk. This could mean carefully approaching the person in the water and pulling them out, standing by and observing until the person is rescued, or at the very least monitoring 16 in case they issue a distress call.  To simply sail away isn't an appropriate option.  At least your skipper warned other boats. Many simple MOB stories end with the person in the water getting chopped up by the prop or hit by the hull. A MOB can go from something funny to deadly."
sailing,39g8ae,IvorTheEngine,3,Thu Jun 11 18:04:55 2015 UTC,"I think the correct thing to do in that situation would be to turn on the radio and make sure everybody knew.   That way you'd be able to check that someone was going to rescue the MOB, and that other boats knew to watch out and not run him down or get upset by the rescuer blocking the river - and you could offer to hang around in case they needed help. For example if you had a swim ladder or dinghy or just a strong crew, and the other boat didn't, it might be much easier for you to rescue the MOB.  BTW it wasn't necessary here but you're supposed to issue a mayday for a MOB before you've given up hope of finding them - you can always cancel it.

I think plastic boats are naught but plastic toys whereas wooden boats are possessed of a soul and a personality.  And much as it takes more than one date to discover a person's personality, it takes more than one sail to plumb the depths of personality of a wooden sailing vessel.  I think she will have a very kindly motion under sail.  I think you'll enjoy her most if you always have two other folks with you when you go out for a sail.  I think she's sitting very low in the stern and it'll behoove you to find out why sooner rather than later. I also think you'll do well to keep careful track of the rate of water accumulating in the bilge - and investigate promptly if that changes.    But mostly - I think that just as redditors accumulate meaningless ""karma points"" for posting and writing on the web - you'll accumulate  ""sailing karma"" merely by taking her out for a sail in the afternoon where people can see you, and those folks will watch and daydream with envy.  ""Look at that lucky bastard..."" they'll think.  And their eyes will focus off beyond the horizon and they'll imagine casting off docklines and gracefully setting off for parts unknown, gently powered by a sternward breeze of 8-10 knots....  Best of luck with your new vessel.  I envy you the looks but not the work. :-)"

sailing,39io8o,Survove,3,Thu Jun 11 23:58:56 2015 UTC,"There are also some benchmark boats that are used as reference points and are rated identically pretty much anywhere.  You are right though about a skilled boat in a specific area causing the local clubs ratings to be skewed.  To combat this you compare many different ratings in many areas to come up with your local number and throw out the clubs that have ratings that are at the extremes.    To complicate matters, the PHRF system is somewhat broken for newer sport boats.  For example, a Melges 24 is in effect two different boats depending on conditions (a bit of a pig in light air or a sreaming machine in a blow) and applying one rating to them as a catchall just doesn't work very well.  Some clubs won't even rate a boat like that."
sailing,39io8o,texasrigger,2,Fri Jun 12 13:23:30 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately you can end up with what we have here with several J105's, Melges 24's, and Hobie 33's which all rate more or less the same but need very different conditions to sail to their rating.  PHRF is far from perfect but it's simple and easy to use."
sailing,39io8o,texasrigger,2,Fri Jun 12 19:23:13 2015 UTC,Too small a community to do that here unfortunately.  Not enough boats on the water to split the fleet that much.
sailing,39io8o,texasrigger,1 point,Fri Jun 12 19:28:57 2015 UTC,"Our local 'Wet Wednesdays' basically run, Farr 40s, Other, Cal 20s; in that order.  I don't think the PHRF system was ever intended to encompass all boats. Splitting the fleet is always nice when you have enough.    And as you say MADE (good name btw),  there are days when the winds will just favor certain boats.  I believe this is why they put in place an average over several races.    This is all very statistical, but I wonder how much personal judgment goes into ratings appeals."
sailing,39io8o,somegridplayer,2,Fri Jun 12 21:26:37 2015 UTC,"The correct answer is buy a J/29 MHOB, throw a stupid amount of money at it, collect all the pickle dishes because PHRF is broken as hell."
sailing,39io8o,somegridplayer,1 point,Fri Jun 12 21:30:03 2015 UTC,"I have to agree with you that it's not a perfect system, hence the post.  I believe the idea of the rating system is to not make a money game out of the sport.  If we were talking about professional racing, then the system is out of the question."
sailing,39io8o,tkaraszewski,1 point,Fri Jun 12 21:43:42 2015 UTC,"But it has made a money game out of racing. You throw tons of money into fairing the bottom, tons of money into string sails, high tech sheets and halyards. None of which affect rating."
sailing,39io8o,tkaraszewski,1 point,Sat Jun 13 06:42:37 2015 UTC,"That's not how PHRF works. The ratings are effectively arbitrary and based on past performance. your rating is not 0 because your boat is equally as fast as some theoretical boat, it's 0 because your boat kept beating the boat that rates 5.  Besides, the notion that any boat does a mile in a particular time isn't accurate. in 20 knots of wind, my boat sails upwind at 6 knots and downwind at 14.  I also rate 114 in San Francisco, but 117 in New England."
sailing,39io8o,TheShaytoon,1 point,Fri Jun 12 18:40:37 2015 UTC,"I've come to understand that the ratings differ geographically.  Different clubs/organizers will assign various ratings to identical boats.  This is how I understand it:   Boat ""Juliet"" has a PHRF rating of 150 Boat ""Oscar"" has a PHRF rating of 125   They both race a course of 1nm with identical times. Essentially Oscar owes Juliet 25 seconds for that mile and Juliet would win by -00'25"".  So as you say, it is based on past performance.  A boat's rating can be moved up and down based on its performance over, lets say, the past 5 races.  Juliet may have a more skilled boat but after 5 races there would be an adjustment to either move Oscar up to a rating of 150 or Juliet down to a rating of 125.    There must be some statistical process for these calculations."
sailing,39io8o,FlickrPaul,1 point,Sat Jun 13 06:26:08 2015 UTC,"Sort of. PHRF ratings can be adjusted based on nothing more than a skipper or appeal that they be adjusted (and the handicapper agreeing). They are also often chosen based on existing numbers in other fleets. Obviously, one design boats are just assigned the same ratings as their sister ships.   My boat is rated 114 in Monterey bay because that's what they were rating j70s in San Francisco Bay.   If your curious about how a boat is rated, you can actually talk with your handicapper."
sailing,39io8o,somegridplayer,2,Sat Jun 13 11:13:25 2015 UTC,"NEVER should the phrf rating be adjusted for the crew of a boat.    If so two OD boats would have to have different PHRF ratings...  PHRF ratings are different in parts of the country due to sailing conditions, just as /u/tkaraszewski stated.    Sportboats should not be rated under PHRF as /u/texasrigger correctly stated."

The weight of the chain keeps the pull of the anchor low, so it doesn't pull it out of the ground.  You could always go up one size on the anchor and add the chain just to make sure you won't drag ever again."
sailing,39h2w5,JETEXAS,1 point,Thu Jun 11 18:32:51 2015 UTC,"Definitely more chain is needed for your anchor. You want at least 20ft to go with your Danforth anchor.  How do you set your 2 anchors?

After a quick look on amazon I found a Lexmark claw anchor (same style as bruce) at 22lb that would definitely hold you and is just $64.  The other thing to consider is your chain. In my opinion, you don't have enough and I would add a significant amount of chain.   Also, polypropylene is not the best line to use as rode. Get a good nylon rode. Polypropylene weakens fast in a Florida sun. It also floats, which is not good for an anchor line."

sailing,39h2w5,fnordsnord,1 point,Fri Jun 12 00:46:41 2015 UTC,Bruce anchors are the way to go.  Fluke anchors are designed to easily release which a shift in wind direction will cause.
sailing,39h2w5,CaulkusAurelis,3,Mon Jun 15 02:03:09 2015 UTC,I'm with /u/jetexas:  More chain.  LOTS more chain.  It doesn't sound like you are using NEARLY enough chain.  I'd ALWAYS have at least a boat-length of chain on the rode for starters.
sailing,39h2w5,SchoonerKat1,2,Thu Jun 11 20:49:47 2015 UTC,"Rode diameter will not stop dragging.    Definitely add some heavier chain, , and some additional  length of the chain will help, but you might be better off switching to a Bruce style anchor and using the fluke as a spare.    The fluke anchors tend to break free when you swing too far, and thunderstorms will shift the direction and (obviously) the strength of the wind. The flukes also tend to ""load up"" with mud, and do not reset well on their own.    I sailed around ( and aground) in Port Charlotte on the west coast, so I feel your pain..."

sailing,39h2w5,mctaggert,1 point,Fri Jun 12 16:19:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah I think the chain makes a huge difference. But 11 ton cruiser with a full keel puts a lot more strain on the anchor. Though, the full keel could actually be good because the boat swings with the current more than the wind and doesn't make sudden movements? I don't really know...  Yeah, my boat (40' but only 6 tons) would not appreciate 100' of chain either. I haven't actually tried to anchor my boat largely because it's new to me and I haven't gotten the chance yet. It has the bare minimum anchoring gear required by racing rules (or very close to that). I'm debating about making the boat a cruising rode, but I don't have a bow roller let alone windlass or chain locker. I'm only 5'2"", I had enough trouble getting the 35 lb Danforth + 15' chain down the companion way and stowed (I don't have a lazarette). So I'm hoping my current gear works well enough."

I dragged all over in a 24' 6,000 lb fixed keel till I set up Two prepped #30 danforth anchors, both with 50' of 3/8 chain, one on 300' of 1/2"" rode the other on 170' of 3/4 rode. I'd lay out the one with long rode and set it almost at the bitter end, then I'd set the shorter one and feed rode as I pulled 150'  of the long one. I fastened both to the bow and even in tidal currents I finally held fast. The anchors were 180 degrees apart both with 50' of chain and 150' of rode, my swing was about 100' in any direction.  It's total overkill but I got good sleep ."
sailing,39h2w5,texasrigger,2,Fri Jun 12 01:12:08 2015 UTC,"What brand of fluke anchor are you using?  Some cheap fluke anchors are merely designed to LOOK like a Danforth or Fortress brand anchor, but do NOT perform like one. There's a lot of design that goes into making a fluke anchor that works well.  If you are not using an actual Danforth or Fortress brand anchor, I recommend that you try one before switching to another type of anchor."

sailing,39gzsm,0rangexc,3,Fri Jun 12 12:18:00 2015 UTC,"Ideally you want a friend who has a boat and no one to sail with.  If you just want to get afloat, volunteer on race day. You don't need to know anything, just to be willing and friendly.  If you want to get to the point where you can sail and own your own boat, book a course and you'll learn a lot faster.  People do just buy boats and go for it, and many are fine, but most of the people who get into trouble are also in the group. There's a lot to learn, and you can't always rely on help arriving.  Also, if you're young and agile, I'd recommend starting on a dinghy and working up to bigger boats. You're closer to the action on a smaller boat and not distracted by all the complex systems. You'll feel like a sailor rather than just someone on a boat in a week or two rather than months."

I live in Arizona, which might make it seem like I'm insane, but there's a method to it. My gf's family has a place in San Carlos, so I can get there frequently. I'll be taking a course in July, and if I manage not to be cooked to a cinder, I'll get my basic keelboat certification. After that, I figure I'll look into acquiring something small, beginner-friendly and trailerable.   Any suggestions the old salts might have for a beginner like me or OP would be appreciated."

sailing,39esrz,still_dave,2,Thu Jun 11 16:46:13 2015 UTC,"Its made for sitting in a slip or on a mooring entertaining, not sailing. Note the giant arch of retard that allows the foot of the main to attain a low orbit. Along with the awful freeboard of needing an elevator to get down to water level.  I'm sure down below there's few to no grab handles to make getting around near impossible unless you're in full padding and planning on flying your way around."
sailing,39esrz,somegridplayer,4,Thu Jun 11 16:57:37 2015 UTC,"You're correct in that it's not designed around long term blue water sailing.  You're incorrect that it's not designed for sailing at all.  It's just designed for easier day sailing, specifically for places like the Caribbean and the Med.    That arch gives you a ton more room in the cockpit and reduces the number of lines and pulleys you have to dodge while moving around.  It also reduces the risk of you or your guests getting brained by the boom in a surprise jibe.  Also, in today's world of furling mainsails, it's not like you'll frequently have to reach up there to do anything.  I haven't had to try climbing into one personally, but it doesn't seem like there is that much more free board on this boat than on most other boats out there.  And if you look at the interior pictures, pretty much every surface has a deep lip on it that makes it easy to grab and hold onto.  I'll admit, I do like Beneteau as a company, and often find myself coming to their defense.  That's partly because I grew up around them, and partly because I like their design language and philosophy.  They have certainly had to make some performance compromises in the name of comfort and looks, but that's the area this boat is designed for."
sailing,39esrz,still_dave,-1,Thu Jun 11 17:18:03 2015 UTC,None of the items I listed were blue water sailing specific. They were common sense.  The only time you'll see that in the carib is under the ownership of sunsail etc (which caters to the lowest denominator).
sailing,39esrz,somegridplayer,4,Thu Jun 11 17:27:02 2015 UTC,They'll be very popular charter boats.  True.  Have you ever sailed on one of these?
sailing,39esrz,still_dave,3,Thu Jun 11 17:38:38 2015 UTC,"They are one of the biggest models out there for charter. I've taken one in Sardinia, friend is taking one in Mallorca next month and I know there are a load in the Caribbean.  There is loads of cabin space, and yes, they aren't the most exciting to sail but there easily get you from mooring to mooring in comfort and minimal fuss."
sailing,39esrz,GnarlyBear,0,Thu Jun 11 23:06:02 2015 UTC,"Which in addition to being cheap, rugged, and not a big loss if damaged is why charter companies use them. They're made to accommodate people who barely sail. If it wasn't for the fuel costs in the med or carib, it'd be all powerboats."

sailing,39esrz,somegridplayer,2,Fri Jun 12 10:40:49 2015 UTC,"What do you consider sailing then?  These tour the entire Med, Tyrrhenian, Adriatic and Aegean seas in a single season which is enough diversity for most.   Some models (older) are quite light and known for not being the most stable in very rough seas but who is crossing the Pacific or Atlantic on a regular basis?  Most importantly, who says there is one way to enjoy sailing? I wouldn't wear running shoes if I was going for a hike but I would wear trainers for a day's walk in the park."
sailing,39esrz,GnarlyBear,2,Fri Jun 12 09:02:55 2015 UTC,"It's a boat aimed at the charter market. It's for port hopping and bay anchoring... no big deal. A lot of people do just that. Frankly if I take friends or family on a charter I'm not going to race, and if it blows over F6 I'm not going to take them wave riding.  More than ""bad"" it has a purpose. I go sail a 49er with my mate sometimes, and I can see myself chartering something similar to this in the Med. It depends on the crew really. For ""casuals"" it's more about the sea experience and the tourism than sailing per se."

sailing,39esrz,joaozecchin,1 point,Sat Jun 13 00:04:06 2015 UTC,How do these boats compare to Bavaria?
sailing,39esrz,strolls,1 point,Fri Jun 12 17:13:25 2015 UTC,"Bavaria, Beneteau and Jeanneau are all targeting the same market, all selling hundreds of boats a year, many of them to charter fleets.  They're all in the category described by a British sailing forum as AWB's - average white boats.  There clearly are differences between them, but substantially they're all trying to achieve the same thing, and all built the same way.  They're all European sailboats - moulded fibreglass, fairly light and with bolt-on fin keel, so they can tick the cruiser-racer box. They all have in-mast furling as standard, with a ""performance"" package as an option. They all have a bathing platform at the rear.   All 3 companies sell boats with modular arrangements of cabins, each available either with the maximum number of cabins, sold in the millions to charter fleets, or with two cabins knocked into one, called the ""owners cabin"" layout. A 35' will be available with 2 or 3 cabins, a 45' with 3 or 4.  Each company sells some club racer models, typically named ""Fast"" or ""First"" or something like that.  Personally, I really like the look of Jeanneaus - all their boats share a similar design language, and to me everything seems to be in the right place and fit right. Other people will say the same about Bavs or Benes.   There are surely people who will argue that one of these marques is better-built than the others, but there's no comparison - for better or worse - with a Hallberg Rassy 412 or full-keeled Taiwanese GRP from the 70's."

sailing,39bpru,shack_dweller,2,Thu Jun 11 02:32:14 2015 UTC,"The best way to get measurements would be to have them take a picture of the existing hatch boards lying on top of a grid.

sailing,39bpru,svm_invictvs,1 point,Thu Jun 11 14:44:28 2015 UTC,That's a fantastic idea!
sailing,39bpru,svm_invictvs,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:35:26 2015 UTC,"After a bit of research online, it looks like these would not be economically feasible to build and sell. In either aluminum or stainless steel, the material cost is around $200. This doesn't include welding consumables like argon and filler rod nor does it include my time. It took me about ten hours to build but I'm sure I could get it down to about 4 or 5. I would value my time at at least $20 an hour. So we're looking at around $300 for a set of boards around the size I built for my boat. I'm not sure many people would pay that much for simple hatch boards they could build on a table saw themselves out of scraps of wood. What do you think?"
sailing,39bpru,0OKM9IJN8UHB7,2,Thu Jun 11 20:07:21 2015 UTC,"I dunno, this is sailing. There are boatloads (see what I did there?) of folks who wouldn't think twice about dropping $300 to pimp out their boat.   The guy who helped me reposition my boat last weekend bought a 40' Jeanneau two years ago. I don't know if he'd want SS hatch boards, but $300 ain't shit to him. I don't know what he paid, but a new 40' Jeanneau is $250k with nothing on it.  I just got mine (used, mind you), so I've got $1000's to go before I'd jump at hatch boards, but I could see spending $300 if it was in the slush-fund and there was nothing pressing on the horizon.  As far as materials go, did you look at bulk purchase? That might cut down on cost, but it would be an up-front risk."

sailing,39bs97,marklar4568,1 point,Wed Jun 10 18:20:40 2015 UTC,I would have turned up and immediately dumped the jib sheets. I don't know if I would have dumped the main or not. It's pretty dangerous to be trying to get to foredeck to recover the jib with the boom swinging wildly.

sailing,39bs97,somegridplayer,1 point,Wed Jun 10 18:40:14 2015 UTC,"It sounds like your turn-rate was a bit slow.    The rudder sounds like it cavitated (lost flow), when that happens, we  give the rudder a couple of quick back and forth pumps to re-establish flow."
sailing,39bs97,TheShaytoon,3,Wed Jun 10 18:37:04 2015 UTC,I think you meant that the rudder lost flow by stalling.  Cavitation is when bubbles interfere with the flow because extremely high pressures cause them to form in the water. It's usually only an issue for propellers when over-powered.
sailing,39bs97,and_one_more_thing,3,Wed Jun 10 19:37:15 2015 UTC,"I am by no means a hydro physicist.  You say it stalled, and not cavitated, I will say you are correct.  Here is why I did call it cavitating instead of stalling, and please correct me so I know better.  When the rudder on My particular boat loses flow, we are at the upper speed range (12-16 knots).   I just assumed that the disturbance on the trailing edge was, for a lack of a better word, sucking air down and the air bubbles caused the loss of flow.    My usual understanding of a stall is a result of not enough flow over the foil.  Happens when we are going super duper slow...."
sailing,39bs97,TheShaytoon,3,Wed Jun 10 20:10:50 2015 UTC,"That would be aeration then.  Your rudder has a high pressure and a low pressure side.  Sometimes the low pressure can be so great (when your doing a big maneuver) that its less work for air to be sucked down from the surface than for wa.  This screws any flow you have and it stalls the foil (a stall just indicates the foil rotated and lost lift, its definition is independent of fluid velocity).  This can happen alot if you turn an outboard really quick- the low pressure sucks air down to the prop and all the sudden the engine RPM's go through the roof and the thrust drops off."
sailing,39bs97,sailerboy,3,Wed Jun 10 20:18:06 2015 UTC,So the right theory but the wrong choice of words; I can definitely live with that.
sailing,39bs97,TheShaytoon,2,Wed Jun 10 20:19:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I should have been more clear that you were right, the other fluff was more for anyone else strolling through the thread."
sailing,39bs97,sailerboy,1 point,Wed Jun 10 21:58:21 2015 UTC,"A stall happens when a foil is at too high an angle to the flow, and instead of flowing smoothly over the back (or top if it's a wing) the flow detaches, breaks up and becomes turbulent. It can happen at any speed, but generally means you're pushing it too hard.  http://airwarrior.afkamm.co.uk/Aerodynamics/stall.gif  Aeration also happens, when the low pressure becomes so extreme that it sucks air down instead - which is why many boats tuck the rudder under the hull away from the air."
sailing,39bs97,IvorTheEngine,1 point,Wed Jun 10 21:35:58 2015 UTC,"Besides reducing sail area before getting myself into that situation, what should I have done to regain control more quickly?    De-power the main by releasing the vang and dropping the traveler,"
sailing,39bs97,FlickrPaul,2,Wed Jun 10 18:42:42 2015 UTC,Why the traveller instead of the main sheet? Does it make a difference?
sailing,39bs97,IvorTheEngine,2,Wed Jun 10 21:39:47 2015 UTC,"Actually you do both, but traveler first, then sheet.  Using the traveler first can help you keep the main flat while at the same time reducing power.  Now that said, if the vang is not eased it does not make that much of a difference other than it being easier to get the main back in.  So the big thing you need to do if you want to depower a main, is 1st dump traveler, then vang, then sheet."
sailing,39bs97,FlickrPaul,1 point,Thu Jun 11 00:53:17 2015 UTC,"Were you sailing backwards? It sounds to me like you came up into the wind, stopped, then started moving backwards at which point the rudder was acting in reverse. I can't see how else the bow could pass back and forth across the wind like that.  In hectic situations like that, I've found that firing up the engine is a fast and easy way help to regain control while I go drop or reef the sails. Another option is to heave to while you go reef the main.  Turning too far into the wind can be dangerous when it stops the boat, especially if the sails are trimmed in tight: the wind inevitably blows the bow down and the sails fill in again, but it's like starting a car in 5th gear. You cannot gain speed quickly enough to hold the bow up, so it continues to blow down until you find yourself broaching."
sailing,39bs97,and_one_more_thing,2,Wed Jun 10 19:28:56 2015 UTC,"I've found that firing up the engine is a fast and easy way help to regain control   It is, but it's also really easy to forget to check for lines in the water when you're stressed, and then you have a real problem!"
sailing,39bs97,IvorTheEngine,1 point,Wed Jun 10 21:38:41 2015 UTC,"In a hard broach - you definitely want to depower everything - release both sheets and vang. But if you know in advance that you're going to be overpowered, you can prepare by railing the backstay, putting jib cars all the way back, and railing the vang. You can sail effectively by staying very close to the wind - effectively pinching - and keeping the luff of your main stalled. That way, you can keep moving through the water fast enough to maintain steerage way. If you let yourself get to the point of broaching and you dump your sails, you usually stop quickly and heel, which will inevitably stall your rudder. If you're going to be reaching while overpowered, you need to drop your jib. It's nearly impossible to reach when you have too much sail area forward, because you'll typically have too much lee helm that cannot be reduced by dumping the main."
sailing,39bs97,ilikebigboats,1 point,Wed Jun 10 19:44:03 2015 UTC,First thing to do in any broach is to blow the vang.
sailing,39bs97,mbetter,1 point,Wed Jun 10 20:04:56 2015 UTC,"If you had to pick one action, isn't it more effective to blow the mainsheet? Blowing the vang allows the top of the sail to twist away, but leaves the foot of the sail still presenting a large area to push the boat over. Blowing the mainsheet allows the entire mainsail to rotate out of the wind."
sailing,39bs97,and_one_more_thing,1 point,Wed Jun 10 20:28:10 2015 UTC,"If you're pinned downwind, blowing the mainsheet with the vang on will just turn you further downwind with the sail still fully loaded. Blowing the vang will allow the boom to rise and depower the main."
sailing,39bs97,mbetter,1 point,Wed Jun 10 21:26:19 2015 UTC,"If the clew is in the water, the boom can't swing out any more, so the vang is the only way to depower any part of the sail."

Documented vessels do not display their official numbers on the outside of the hull, but are identified by the name and hailing port. The application for documentation must include a name for the vessel composed of letters of the Latin alphabet or Arabic or Roman numerals and may not exceed 33 characters. The name may not be identical, actually or phonetically, to any word or words used to solicit assistance at sea; may not contain or be phonetically identical to obscene, indecent, or profane language, or to racial or ethnic epithets. Once established, a vessel's name may not be changed without application, fees, and the consent of the Director, National Vessel Documentation Center. There is no rule against duplication of names for documented vessels, so hailing ports are helpful in identifying vessels."

sailing,39984w,SeaCadet175,2,Wed Jun 10 10:52:11 2015 UTC,Good thoughts but it depends how easy you can change the outhaul on the boat.  Light to moderate wind: For upwind I'd keep it so that you can fit two fingers between the bottom of the mainsail and the boom when pushing it sideways (parallel line to the water). For downwind fully open.  For heavy wind; crank it fully for up and downwind.    EDIT: Oh also I'd slap a tiller extension on it
sailing,39984w,Biggestnacho,2,Wed Jun 10 11:06:42 2015 UTC,"Upwind in light air you want the outhaul tight to flatten the sail and maintain attached flow over the surface. If you loosen it too much the sail is too baggy and it stalls, but ever class has their own tuning guide that tells you where to set it."

sailing,39984w,planeray,7,Wed Jun 10 13:29:37 2015 UTC,"Looks like you had a great time regardless - not gonna pick on your speed as I spent 10 mins on the weekend paddling in place before accepting a tow from someone :P  Just out of interest, what's the yellow and black flecked line coming off the end of the boom for? A really long outhaul that's only halfway on or something?"
sailing,39984w,LandlockedPirate,5,Wed Jun 10 06:02:10 2015 UTC,"I had one of these as a kid.  Actually the outhaul is that cable that comes out up by the gooseneck and has a blue line going through it then down to the deck. On the back of the boom the cable comes out and goes to that little 9"" track or so with the hook on it.    It looks like maybe they couldn't figure out how to release the outhaul, and instead just used the yellow/black flecked line to extend the hook so it reaches the sail and then just let it dangle?  Couple rigging notes Op   Put figure 8 knots at the end of all your lines so they can't go back out all the way though the pulley/cleat The tiller should go under that rope on the back.  That's so if you drop it it stays within reach. Release the outhaul (blue line) and hook the sail to the end of the boom on the hook, then pull it back in, get rid  of that yellow/black rope. Use that tiller extension and sit farther forward. I'm not sure as yours is a bit different than mine was, but I think your vang is upside-down."
sailing,39984w,IvorTheEngine,1 point,Wed Jun 10 12:26:19 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice! Regarding the outhaul, it is actually connected to the blue line like you describe, but when I first put my boat in the water I have the yellow and black line tied to the leech of the sail.I use that line and the free blowing sail to give my boat enough speed to get away from the dock and other boats, then I can turn upwind and clip the sail into the boom and pull the blue rope to tighten the outhaul. When I'm done on the lake and headed  back in I can unclip the sail from the boom when I get close to the dock so that I am not under as much power coming in. I use the yellow and black line again with just the sail to get the last bit of the way to the dock and I'm good. I just don't know any better way of rigging the sail effectively."
sailing,39984w,brojbro,2,Wed Jun 10 13:21:23 2015 UTC,"Thank you! The yellow and black  rope is actually the only way I've sufficiently found to rig the boat under wind. Because of the sail configuration you have to have the sail on the mast when its on land, and I don't want the boom swinging around madly in the wind. I tie the yellow and black line to the end (is it the leech?) of the sail and use that and the rope to get away from the docks until I can clip my sail into the end of the boom. It helps with coming in as well because I can turn the boat upwind by the dock, unclip the sail from the boom, and then just slowly sail in using the free flowing sail and the rope in my hand. It's not pretty but it's the best way I've found to do it. I'd happily take advice or instructions on a different way to rig it."
sailing,39984w,tsailn,4,Wed Jun 10 13:12:36 2015 UTC,"Lasers are similar, and they have the hook on one end of the rope, and the other lead forward along the boom to the mast. That way you can leave it slack to depower the rig, then pull it in without having to touch the end of the boom.  Also, get into the habit of wearing a PFD/buoyancy aid. One day the wind will get up while you're on the water and you won't want to go back for it, or you will have left it at home. Boats can blow down-wind faster than you can swim and no one can tread water for ever. Even if you're a really good swimmer, set an example for the kids who aren't."
sailing,39984w,Wilawah,2,Wed Jun 10 16:07:46 2015 UTC,"I have a PFD with me every time I'm on the water. I actually have 3 in the boat with me in these pics (two under the blue bag that stay there usually for when I have friends in the boat) and then I have a ski vest in the blue bag that sits near the daggerboard.

Parceling is wrapping rope or cable with something (like wrapping a parcel)  Traditionally it was done with strips of material soaked in tar but friction tape is the modern equivalent.  It's purpose was to help waterproof the rot prone line.  Here it was used as a base for the service to help keep things from slipping around since everything is just held together with friction.  Service is wrapping rope or cable with a much smaller line.  It too was originally for waterproofing but it has many many uses.  Here it was used to provide a layer of protection from abrasion (rubbing) .  The eye was made big initially but was tightened with a round seizing.  A seizing is a very strong way to bind two pieces of line together using another, much smaller piece of line."

sailing,39635r,jeffsnff,2,Tue Jun 9 15:59:14 2015 UTC,"Lowes rope isn't going to be the same quality or even type that you'd use on a sailboat.  Mostly what they have is braided nylon.  It's not nice to work with in your hands, the nylon strands can actually cut you if you're using any real force.  It also stretches a lot, and has about 1/10 the breaking strength of a real polyester sta-set rope.  And it's slippery, so knots can try to work themselves loose if you let them.  West Marine will have some remnant rope that you can get fairly cheap, and I've gotten some good deals on ebay finding 100 foot lengths for <$20 in small diameter rope."

sailing,39635r,C-O-N,2,Tue Jun 9 18:04:44 2015 UTC,Okay?  Go ahead and compare the test strength of Lowes braided nylon rope with New England Sta-set of the same diameter.  It's about a factor of 10 difference.
sailing,39635r,furbowski,2,Tue Jun 9 19:00:11 2015 UTC,I didn't say the ropes were comparable I said the material is.  Junk braided line is a hollow (typically) nylon/polypropylene blend that gets its diameter from a non load bearing filler.  It's strength is in the cover only and that cover is poorly made.  You also see different ratings in line.  Working load and breaking load are vastly different things and shouldn't be compared.  Hardware stores show the rated working load whereas marine line is generally advertised with it's ultimatebreaking load.  Hardware store line is generally crap I just didn't want people to think that nylon is so much weaker than polyester.
sailing,39635r,jeffsnff,1 point,Tue Jun 9 19:16:28 2015 UTC,"Correct me if I'm wrong here, but polyester line is preferable in every major task on a sailboat over nylon line, because it has less stretch, better abrasion resistance, better heat resistance, and better strength retention when wet.  Right?"
sailing,39635r,K_S_ON,3,Tue Jun 9 21:11:23 2015 UTC,"No, anchor lines and dock lines should be nylon for the stretch (shock absorption).  The 8 plait shown is a nylon line.  Polyester is best where you don't want as much stretch.  However, many other materials have their own place as well.  Polypropylene, UHMPE, etc."
sailing,39635r,furbowski,1 point,Tue Jun 9 21:45:27 2015 UTC,I use nylon rope if I have to rig up a preventer. The streachyness acts a bit like a shock absorber if you do something stupid which can save your boom.
sailing,39635r,rantifarian,2,Wed Jun 10 09:43:03 2015 UTC,"splicing up 3-strand  line is pretty easy. Use line with a softer lay, one that will open up more easily. Hard-laid line is stiff and hard to work with.  The ultimate hard lay is wire cable, and the true modern masters of the craft can do neat splices in 21-strand steel line. Of course your first few splices will look like crap, you will be learning a new skill.  But it's not that hard to do in softer 3-strand line.  And once you start working with rope, call it line. :)"

I learned this one several years ago usung a set of written instructions (not even any pictures) from a guy with the manufacturer.  As a sailor you only need to know a handful of knots despite what the books tell you.  One from each category of knot will do you.  Hitch - tying a line to something fixed - clove hitch.  Used for cleats, tying up fenders, etc.  Knot - tying a line to itself - this category you need to know three.  First, as a stopper you need a figure eight.  To tie around something you have the reef knot (square knot).  To put a loop in a line you need a bowline.  Bend - tying two lines together - sheet bend which is structurally identical to a bowline.  Sure there are some specialized applications like anchor bends but those five (and one is a duplicate) are all you'll NEED."

Would be better than stuff that lowes has. Throw it in a bucket and let it soak with liquid laundry soap or whatever. Then it's at least not green and disgusting. Though typically you don't attempt to splice already worked line (at least double braid anyway) if you want to practice splicing. But should be great for practicing knots and whippings.

sailing,396tzm,TempCK,1 point,Tue Jun 9 17:55:43 2015 UTC,"Did you have specific questions?    A lot of standing rigging is similar between most boats in that class that I know of, with some variations.  Like, is it partial or masthead rigged? (I think it's masthead)  Single spreader with just one upper and one lower shroud? (I'm guessing yes based on mast height)  Standing rigging is a pretty important thing to get right, but there isn't a lot of variation.  You'll have to figure out exactly what lengths you need, but in the end it all comes down to the same 1x19 wire (probably 3/16"") with the same fittings at the ends.  Are you asking about running rigging (sheets and halyards)?  Chances are, a boat that old is going to have a few owners worth of modifications on it, and they might really impact the running rigging.  In general, though, if you even halfway know what you're doing, running rigging is okay just to do however you can best figure out.  As long as it isn't going to pull a fixture out of the hull or grab a passenger and take them overboard, you can work with trial and error.  Get a few hundred feet of 5/16 sta-set and go down to the boat and see if you can find places to put it all.  This guy seems to have a bunch of Cal resources, but the specific owner manual you want is I guess a hard to find item."
sailing,396tzm,POTUS,1 point,Tue Jun 9 20:58:39 2015 UTC,"It is mast rigged for the main and partial on the head sail. More was looking for the shrouds. It has a single spreader with one upper and lower shroud but also has (not sure if it is original) some cableing going over the spreader and then rivited back into the mast. The boat was in super rough shape and we ended up having to strip just about everything off the mast, and the previous owner doesnt remember much on its rigging. Also not sure how much tension needs to be on the shrouds. The halyards should be pretty straight forward though we ended up replacing all the blocks (it still had a wooden masthead block in it but it had rotted away). I saw that site but it seems that this particular model (shoal keel with a swing keel on it) was one of the less common ones they sold. I guess I didnt have anything too specific, just if anyone knew any general resources for it."
sailing,396tzm,POTUS,1 point,Wed Jun 10 13:16:36 2015 UTC,"On a boat that size, don't worry too much about getting a lot of shroud tension.  What's most important is that you tension evenly so that the mast stays straight.  You'll be able to see if you tension for example one lower shroud, the mast will start to curve away from that side.  Just stand on the deck looking up the mast and have a helpful hand make adjustments until the mast is straight.  You should be able to tension the whole rig by pulling the main halyard forward to set the fore stay.  I'm not sure what you mean about a cable going over the spreader.  Both ends of the cable are riveted to the mast?  Maybe something added to keep the spreader in place while trailering.  Doesn't sound original to me, but I don't have any experience with Cal boats.  What's critical is to identify the 6 important lines:  4 shrouds, fore stay, and back stay.  Once you have those in place and adjusted, then the mast isn't going anywhere and you can consider your standing rigging pretty safe."

sailing,393mg9,Ziggy_Baby,11,Tue Jun 9 02:19:28 2015 UTC,"Other people have posted the proper way. The gripe with this is that you can't undo this with one hand, at least not easily or quickly. I don't really know about the knot in the photo, but you also don't want this knot to self tighten under tension and become hard to undo, since its almost certainly a temporary hitch.  Its also important you take a wrap around the cleat before the hitch so that the line doesn't shoot out under tension when you release the hitch."
sailing,393mg9,laxatives,5,Tue Jun 9 06:42:16 2015 UTC,"The last crossover with the tail should not go perpendicular to the last wrap, but parallel instead. Like this.

sailing,393mg9,astoswine,3,Tue Jun 9 02:37:09 2015 UTC,How do you even end-up tying that? Seems like slipping a half hitch on each horn....  which is way to much work. I wonder if quickly while docking they tied the first... and then later did the final hitch and coiled the line??

sailing,393mg9,SchoonerKat1,1 point,Tue Jun 9 13:38:49 2015 UTC,"It's especially helpful for halyards, because you can tie the hitch and keep the halyard tight at the same time."

sailing,393mg9,SchoonerKat1,1 point,Tue Jun 9 18:28:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I don't necessarily do a full rounding; it depends on where the line is coming from. For example, if the clear is vertical you never want the final hitch to be on the bottom, so it's a half loop if it's from the top and a full loop if it's from the bottom."
sailing,393mg9,fprintf,1 point,Tue Jun 9 19:05:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that is exactly how I would do it. And I guess with docklines I usually tie just like a halyard with the hitch being away from the horn the line is coming in on.  Though lately I have been using my bow and stern lines also as spring lines, so actually I think I have been doing full rounds to orient the line correctly to go back up to be a spring."

I swear he just wasn't taught the proper way to do it 50 years ago when he learned about boats. It's a bit like people who weren't taught the right was to run toilet paper over the roll.

sailing,393mg9,perspectiveiskey,2,Tue Jun 9 01:49:31 2015 UTC,Well supposedly it produces more chafe points so the dock lines wear out more quickly. It also looks messy and takes slightly longer to do and undo.

Funny enough, it's been mentioned here in the ""wrong way"", but the way to reduce chafe is to add one extra turn to the hitch (if you don't believe me, try it and look: the live end of the line will rub more against the knot itself than onto the cleat).  Regardless though, the last loops of the hitch are not under load, so the more chafe argument is not valid.   It also looks messy and takes slightly longer to do and undo.   I think this is true: it looks a bit messier. But then again, some sidewalks have non whole number of slabs between two stops signs..."

While I agree that there are some really good knots, and learning those are a good idea, using ""the wrong knot"" has rarely ever been an issue.  I have been attacked (verbally) at times for using the wrong knot when I actually used a much more secure version that the ""expert"" in question didn't know.    People need to chill.

This knot will hold and you will probably never be in a situation where you need to undo it fast in an emergency. So you could go 50 years without it biting you in the ass.  However, once you get out into open waters, even though 99% of the time it would still be fine, you have to be prepared for that 1% of the time when the SHTF. If I have to untie 15 cleats due to some emergency, and they are all tied different ways, it is going to take me a lot longer than if they are all done in a predictable, consistent and easy to do way. The way that is pictured here, even if they were all tied this way, would take longer to untie than the proper ways to do it.  You should always do it the right way so it is the right way if and when you have to handle it in an emergency. Also, always doing it the right way helps you do it the right way when under the stress of an emergency.

sailing,393mg9,frojoe27,0,Wed Jun 10 11:59:57 2015 UTC,No one got the mistake so far. You NEVER put a hitch in an anchoring cleat. You can't undo the thing in case of a falling tide when the line comes under tension.
sailing,393mg9,hilomania,3,Tue Jun 9 13:59:37 2015 UTC,How can you tell this is on a fixed pier and not a floating dock?
sailing,393mg9,ijon_cbo,0,Tue Jun 9 13:09:58 2015 UTC,Doesn't matter. Wave action can make it impossible to undo a hitch as well.
sailing,393mg9,GeeBee72,2,Tue Jun 9 14:19:26 2015 UTC,And the hitch is the wrong way around.
sailing,393mg9,hilomania,2,Wed Jun 10 21:38:45 2015 UTC,That only applies if you're anchoring in an tidally affected area.  You put a hitch on a cleat when on a lake to stop the possibility of the cleat hitch coming undone if the boat is pitched during wind or boat wake.
sailing,393mg9,deadlypinfish,1 point,Tue Jun 9 13:20:31 2015 UTC,"No, you wind the left over line a few times around the cleat. It's not just tides, wave action can also make it impossible to undo a hitch on a cleat."
sailing,393mg9,urlmichael,0,Tue Jun 9 14:05:28 2015 UTC,I do similar wrap around once. Then make a loop and twist it 180 place on cleat. Loop again twist place on other side. Repeat once more if necessary

sailing,393mg9,reyomnwahs,2,Tue Jun 9 06:34:32 2015 UTC,"I disagree. If you need to get away fast, the correct way to do it, is to put the line ""on slip"", so you have a line running through the cleat, around it and back on board. that way, you dont need any assistance from shore to get going and nobody needs to leave the boat to untie."

sailing,395w30,tiberiusgv,1 point,Tue Jun 9 18:48:16 2015 UTC,I guess I more meant the jacket to turn you over face up... Type IIs turn some unconscious users face up (not that you would want to use one). I think you would be better off with a inflatable collar vest (with performance of type II) than with a kayak style vest. That's all. But affordable inflatables are all type III (I think).

sailing,395w30,reyomnwahs,2,Tue Jun 9 15:05:10 2015 UTC,I wouldn't be too worried about going in on a keel boat in a casual race. You can always re-arm an inflatable anyway.  Also I feel like you are more likely to actually wear an inflatable.  Provided on the rare occasion I wear a life jacket I wear an inflatable that is older than I am and god knows if it works. That reminds me I should jump in tonight with it on and see what happens.
sailing,395w30,tiberiusgv,1 point,Tue Jun 9 18:41:34 2015 UTC,Hey thanks for the information. I am so grateful for all the responses. Do you have any suggestions on inflatables to check out? And you should definitely test that inflatable you use :) thanks again
sailing,395w30,TheShaytoon,1 point,Tue Jun 9 19:17:31 2015 UTC,I'd probably just get something like this one for your purposes. Should be super comfortable to wear and keep you floating until you quickly get pulled out of the water. If I was going to get a new life jacket I would probably get something like this because I care about having a harness to hook into jacklines (though I'd probably get something a bit nicer for the sake of not getting west marine brand).  Edit: Seems like ebay may be a good option. http://www.ebay.com/itm/WEST-MARINE-Offshore-Automatic-Inflatable-Life-Vest-with-Harness-/151704666006?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&hash=item23524d7f96

Rearming kits aren't expensive anyway (it's just a CO2 canister like a BB pistol has).   I bought this Onyx and have been happy with it.

sailing,395w30,strolls,5,Tue Jun 9 16:00:02 2015 UTC,Honestly Never go used when it comes to something you are using to save your life. How much is your life worth (used to sail in Chicago and that 'lake' is about a thousand times more dangerous than any ocean I have ever been on). I would recommend if you are on a budget West Marine here which is a cheap option that allows for the option of a tether. If you aren't using a tether there are other cheaper options. If you are willing to fork over the cash the cadalliac PFD would be the Spinlock deck vest with integrated safety harness but its north of $300.   Tl:DR Never buy used equipment if you are trusting your life on it. Save if you must for quality gear.
sailing,395w30,SchoonerKat1,2,Tue Jun 9 14:20:10 2015 UTC,You are totally right about not trusting my life on something used. Maybe my thought was that somebody wouldn't sell a PFD if it was useless.

sailing,3928gh,Bleue22,1 point,Tue Jun 9 04:27:39 2015 UTC,"I see more and more roller furlers on main sails, boom or mast furlers.  Anyone out there with experience on these?  Are they reliable?  Can you furl quickly in heavy airs?  Do they affect sail shape overmuch?  Would you trade that in for a classic two or one line tack reefing sail?"
sailing,3928gh,tkaraszewski,4,Mon Jun 8 21:10:12 2015 UTC,"The in-mast mainsail furlers are awful. They jam all the time, they require an enormously thick mast, and they prevent you from putting battens in the main."
sailing,3928gh,Sld109,1 point,Mon Jun 8 22:27:17 2015 UTC,"They had a bit of a wierd sail shape, because they have no battens they need a really straight leech. And the mast causes massive windage issues."
sailing,3928gh,texasrigger,1 point,Tue Jun 9 02:05:09 2015 UTC,"In mast furlers are absolutely terrible.  They are heavy and unreliable.  As someone who works on them for a living, it would be a deal breaker for me if I were buying a boat."
sailing,392v64,sloaps,2,Mon Jun 8 21:21:31 2015 UTC,"Bring the mast down and make sure the masthead is all clear if you're not sure.  Stepping the mast on a 16 should be no problem, so this shouldn't be a big operation.  Those swages on the halyard wire like to get caught up in the works up there.  Also, make sure you're not standing right under the mast, there is a catch at the top of the mast for those swages and you need to be standing forward as you pull the halyard to clear it."
sailing,392v64,POTUS,2,Mon Jun 8 21:56:19 2015 UTC,"When hoisting the main stand back from the mast almost with your back to the bridles. The main should hoist fairly easily. Once you get it all the way up as tight as possible walk the main halyard into the center front of the mast and let off easily. You should feel the swag catch at the top. This is what holds the main up, not the bottom of the halyard on a cleat. With the main held up by the swag bring the main halyard around the starboard stay and cleat it off. You want the main halyard behind the stay to help the jib battens from catching during a tack. I specified having the main on the starboard side because there should be additional hardware on the port side of the mast specifically for hosting the jib halyard.  I have this exact mast configuration."
sailing,392v64,tiberiusgv,2,Mon Jun 8 22:43:53 2015 UTC,"Thanks, /u/POTUS and /u/tiberiusgv .  I've used that method on both of our Hobies, and the one without the reefing swage/stop goes up without issue.  That one also has the single-sheave, I believe.  So they're nearly identical.  I typically raise the last 5 or so feet of halyard while standing 5 to 10 feet forward of the bow/jib chainplate with the leverage of the hook on a trapeze harness - just sitting typically raises the main on the other Hobie at that point and saves my hands.  I'll definitely take the mast down next weekend, run the halyard through a few times and see if and where it catches."
sailing,392v64,rantifarian,3,Mon Jun 8 22:54:15 2015 UTC,"Rather than pulling the rig, why not pull the boat over and have a play with it all rigged up. More likely to be able to replicate the problem that way"
sailing,392v64,KuriTokyo,2,Mon Jun 8 23:47:19 2015 UTC,"Yes, I would put the boat on it's side and try pulling the sail up by hand. It will eliminate the halyard and only leave the track as the problem."
sailing,392v64,The---Bishop,2,Tue Jun 9 01:12:55 2015 UTC,"Look for mud at the top of the mast in the track; I've certainly seen Hobies that have flipped get dried mud up there. The sheaves can be replaced easily; they often get grooves, flat spots, mud, etc. Sometimes the wire halyard jumps the sheave and is running beside it, not over it. +1 on the ""flip the boat on its side before you take the mast down."" With a helper, this should take 30 seconds (although unstepping the mast isn't too difficult either). Age, friction, salt, maybe missing stitches along the bolt rope can all cause you issues. When I worked at a rental shop, sometimes it would take 2 people to get the Hobie mains up -- one pulls the halyard, the other stands in front of the mast and reaches around to push up on the last batten or two. Hobie mains are heavy (say, compared to a Prindle) because you're lifting the boom as well as the sail for the last bit. If it's just age and friction (not a bad sheave or a dented track), try sailKote."
sailing,392v64,K_S_ON,2,Tue Jun 9 01:33:56 2015 UTC,"Flip the boat on its side and take a look for mud, etc. Get a bit of green scrubby pad, roll it up to a little bit bigger than the bolt rope, stick it on a popsicle stick or something and work it up and down the groove with some dishwashing soap to clean out any grot. Lube with silicone sail track spray, or rub the bolt rope with hard bar soap (some people hate the silicone spray, YMMV).  I think it's better to flip the boat than to pull the mast down, it's easier to do and you can see where the sail is catching if you pull it up by hand."

Wind was light at the start but then picked up to a consistent 25kts and the waves picked up. Worst part was from the windward mark to Catawba island, where it was a broad reach with 6' waves pushing your rear quarter. Lots of rounding- up on this leg, and this is also when CH 16 started blowing up... I think the tally was 3 broken steering/rudders, 1 dismast, and then the MOB. When we saw the helos deployed we knew the outcome would not likely be good but hoped for the best... Like many others, we blew up our Genoa but we're able to limp in under main alone (still going 7kts with only reefed main) and finish. Many calls to sailmakers today I bet.

sailing,391u96,Sailohio,1 point,Tue Jun 9 05:35:14 2015 UTC,30-70 miles depending on which class you are in. Usually short chop but as of about 1am we were experiencing some big swells

Waves at a mid-lake buoy off Lorain were about 3 feet at the time, and the water temperature there was 59. Daytime water temperatures at Toledo and Cleveland were 63 degrees and 53 degrees, respectively.   So not brutally cold, and just shy of Force 4 winds. A good reminder it doesn't take much for the right set of circumstances to line up with an MOB. Tether in any weather, seems to be the best advice.

sailing,3903cr,enuct,1 point,Tue Jun 9 17:10:52 2015 UTC,"I am confused in that, It is a tough boat and I'd certainly sail it coastal ( I have the T2 ) I don't imagine it'd be very comfortable out on the ocean. It has the high freeboard and almost everything going for it. I think it'd be a very bumpy ride comparatively to something with much more waterline. I don't know how the other 27s handle I'd assume very similarly. I do know the T2 performed extremely well in the half ton races though."

I'm headed to the marina in a few days, happy to go sooner if someone here is interested in this boat and would like me to do caveman-style (un)survey.  Lack of a trailer is the main sticking point. That said, trailers can be found, and there are also transport services, etc. I believe I have seen this boat in the yard, and don't recall it looking rough at all, and pics look good. I actually own a trailer capable of transporting this boat, and if you're not far (and own or can get a big ass truck), maybe we can figure something out.  Anyway, somebody here buy this damn thing before I do. Already have two boats and divorces are expensive."

sailing,38zmw5,SkiMonkey98,2,Mon Jun 8 22:40:56 2015 UTC,This so much! I feel like most 22' boats don't have 3 comfortable berths (enough space and small amount of privacy) or anywhere enough storage space.
sailing,38zmw5,SchoonerKat1,3,Tue Jun 9 00:52:49 2015 UTC,"I looked at a lot of cat 22s and 25s when I was searching for a boat. The 25 is definitely better suited for traveling the east coast with 3 people but there was no way I wanted to deal with launching and stepping the mast on a boat that big. Also, the 25 is a lot heavier and i wouldn't risk pulling it with my normal sized suv.  Take a look at your vehicles trailering capacity and then the weight of the boats you are looking at and your decision may be made for you. Good luck."
sailing,38zmw5,decknoises,2,Tue Jun 9 03:19:21 2015 UTC,"Upvote for pointing out that if trailer-ability is a priority, you should probably consider your tow vehicle first. I've towed a number of boats in this category with an older midsized truck, and there has been a wide range of experiences.   All the other problems with rigging (assuming deck stepped mast) are fairly easy to figure out; it's the getting-to-the-water..."

Thanks for the advice."
sailing,38zmw5,rantifarian,2,Thu Jun 11 19:26:32 2015 UTC,"I can raise/lower the mast on my Venture 25 (predecessor to the Macgregor 25) by myself, by hand.  I can also pull it behind a Toyota Tacoma without any trouble.  I think the mast height/weight is about the same, but the Catalina is double the displacement, and more trailer weight than my Tacoma is rated for.  The Catalina is also a much nicer boat, so there's that too."
sailing,38zmw5,cd66312,2,Mon Jun 8 11:51:38 2015 UTC,"Raising and lowering the mast is all about the setup. I could raise the 11.5m triple spreader alloy rig on the hot trailer sailer with no assistance, although it was faster with help. We could go from packed up for long distance travel to on the water in about 45 minutes with three who knew what we were doing, and that was about a pretty big and complex trailer sailer. If you are interested i can try and describe how we had it setup, but without photos it may be more confusing than helpful  I imagine the mast section is pretty heavy on the Catalina and other similar cruisy boats, so you will want a gin pole to make raising the mast easier. If you can find a boat that has been trailered regularly, rather than just at the start and end of the season you will probably get a better setup."
sailing,38zmw5,shortsailco,1 point,Mon Jun 8 14:12:01 2015 UTC,"I've been doing some thinking and I'm now starting to think that I'd like to keep the boat on a mooring.  It will be more expensive, but immensely more convenient, which will undoubtedly lead to more use.  I am still looking at trailerable boats though, because being able to pull it out of the water myself at the end of the season will still save lots of money.  And storing it at my house will allow me to work on it during the winter."

However, if you take it as an exercise in patience it's easier.   Have a master plan, but tackle it one step at a time.  Don't look too much at the big picture or you might get discouraged.  Also,  it will help you in avoiding shortcuts that will bite you in the ass in the future. Do it once and do it right the first time. As bulletproof as you can  It only gets easier,  don't worry.

That limits your risk if you find you need to return it.  From reading the online reviews of these - it looks like the folks who are buying them are not even installing them on boats?

sailing,38wqjj,somegridplayer,2,Sun Jun 7 14:16:00 2015 UTC,"Depends on how you use your boat, and how much you can tolerate leaks.  For a vessel that's going offshore and a leak will be dripping on your face while you're trying to sleep, depriving you of much needed rest and creating an unsafe condition - you NEED the high value high strength ports.  For a vessel you use on weekends in protected waters or near shore that already has a few leaks that you've never bothered even to fix - you can probably justify saving some coin on the less expensive parts."

sailing,38uk6s,Imagine25,6,Sat Jun 6 23:16:37 2015 UTC,I guess this might be a bit hard with 3 people but don't be afraid to fly a hull it will reduce your drag significantly. Also when you go out on trap in higher winds you are going to need to straighten out you body a lot more to get that extra leverage.
sailing,38uk6s,Cramved,2,Sun Jun 7 03:11:30 2015 UTC,"Our aim that day was to let our guest have fun.  He didn't have a wet-suit and the water is still pretty cold in our area.  So I was a little hesitant to push it too hard and get a hull out of the water.  I am still not super sure on exactly where is the best trim and what point of sail is best for hiking out either.  After this thread, I discovered I have a problem with the main being off.  However, it was areally good learning experience with higher winds.  Next time I feel pretty confident with just 2 people we can push and get those hulls out.   If we flip then, no problem!"
sailing,38uk6s,NZZQ,4,Sun Jun 7 04:22:57 2015 UTC,"Usually you hike when close-hauled or on a close or beam reach, but the impetus for hiking is necessity, not just point of sail. Focus on correct sail trim and just start hiking when you need to."
sailing,38uk6s,AllDaySesh,4,Sun Jun 7 16:40:33 2015 UTC,"16's are way fun, I raced these for years with my dad.  Get it down to 2 people on board, crank in the sails, fly the hull and get your ass on the trap...good times.  To tack the boat you basically leave the jib sail alone until the wind gets on the other side of it, wait for the main to catch the wind, then switch the jib over.  If you stall in a tack you can also backwind the jib to push the boat around.  I'm noticing a bit of a gap in the main sail where the boom meets the mast.  I believe either the sail isn't all the way up or your down-haul for the boom isn't set."
sailing,38uk6s,jtioannou,2,Sun Jun 7 04:02:52 2015 UTC,Thanks for the tip!  We will make sure to double check that we are getting the sail up all the way and the down-haul pulled in hard enough next time.

sailing,38uk6s,crashorbit,3,Sun Jun 7 03:16:28 2015 UTC,"Get that jib in, and let that hull fly!  In all seriousness, though, here's my two cents:   Keep your jib sheeted in as hard as you can all the time. Set your trim using the travelers. Hobies are designed to sail slightly heeled over - it's why the hulls are shaped like that. I've found the smoothest angle to be when the windward hull is just skimming the water. When you're trapezing, don't hold on to that handle on the wire. It gives you a false sense of security. It won't stop you from falling forward or aft, and hanging onto it means you're not leaning out the way you should. Hobies don't handle three people well. It's fine if you're just cruising around, but if you really want to let the boat stretch its legs, get some weight off of it. As I (and someone else) said elsewhere, when tacking a Hobie, you have to let the jib backwind to pull the bow out of the no-go zone.   Also, super important to keep in mind: sailing a catamaran is VERY different from sailing a monohull! A lot of the tricks you learn to get a Hobie to do what it does best will NOT work on a dinghy. Some may work on keelboats, but multihulls are a completely different animal.  Have fun, and good luck!"

I've just posted to /r/sailing Tips on tacking a Hobiecat [Youtube], as a response to your post.  It's such a great video (not mine) that I thought it deserved a thread of it's own.  Edit: Changed link to correct reddit thread."
sailing,38uk6s,robinson217,2,Sun Jun 7 03:29:47 2015 UTC,"The trick to tacking a Hobie is to let the jib backwind a bit to get your bow through the wind. Break the sheet as the boat starts to turn, but hold it for a second until you're facing the right direction. Then bring it over. Your tacks won't take as long, won't kill your speed as bad, and you'll be able to accelerate out of them quicker."
sailing,38uk6s,LostxinthexMusic,1 point,Sun Jun 7 04:11:06 2015 UTC,"Just sailed my Hobie for the first time this weekend. What do you mean by ""back wind""? Can you put that in novice terms? My tacks were pretty ugly. The jib battens kept hanging up on the mast and I would have to go grab the bottom with my hand and help it past the mast, at which point it would fill and the boat would instantly start accelerating.  I flew the hull a few times, but only for a few seconds at a time. I don't have trapeze wires, so I was just sitting on the edge. When the hull would lift I almost always chickened out and let the main sheet out a bit and it would plop back down. When you are flying a hull do you cleat the main sheet and use the tiller to adjust, or do you keep the main sheet in your hand un-cleated and make adjustments?   Thanks."

sailing,38uh4a,davemchine,3,Sat Jun 6 22:49:28 2015 UTC,"Depends on what you want your wood to look like.  If you like the finish of wood, go with the oil. (pretty simple, clean wood and apply as needed)  If you like it to look like glass, go with the varnish. (bit more of a task, multiple coats with sanding between each coat, so the work you did to sand all that wood, you need to do ~8 more times, have to make sure weather is clear is doing outside work, etc...)  IMO, areas that get touched, grabbed or stepped on get varnish, areas on the internal structure get oil.  Both require annual maintenance and with varnish every 3-5 years you will need to strip down to bare wood and build up your coats again. (8-10)"

The primary considerations will be the level of effort you want to put in now (varnish high, oil low), the work you want to do on an ongoing basis (varnish should last at least a year depending on where you are, oil only a month or two), look (varnish is a film finish and oil just makes the wood look new/wet) and how much work you want down the road (stripping varnish to redo is serious work, reapplying oil is pretty easy).  Then there are considerations for what type of film finish (traditional oil based spar varnish, two part varnish, Cetol, Epoxy then varnish...).  The list goes on and on so be prepared for some research."
sailing,38tnt0,the_thorn_of_camorr,1 point,Sat Jun 6 18:48:44 2015 UTC,Does anyone know how this compares to a 420?
sailing,38tnt0,Biggestnacho,2,Mon Jun 8 11:23:29 2015 UTC,420 is lighter and faster upwind and straight downwind (because of the symetric spinnaker)  the vago is better on reaches with the genny up and can point pretty high in light wind with the genny up.
sailing,38vbfh,johnbentley,3,Sun Jun 7 03:25:48 2015 UTC,"Jibe.   It's obviously depends on the boat. Generally they're so light, they're easy to get caught in irons.   If you must tack, plan early, keep at a beam reach or even further from the wind to gain speed, and plan to tack right through to a reach on the other side.  Keep tight control on the sheet and the tiller as you're tacking so you can take advantage of the any back winding and keep it trimmed as soon as it hits the other side of the sail.  A second of flapping main sail can push you back into irons. Use your mass to keep the boat as level as possible during the tack.   Usually this will keep enough momentum to pass through irons.  First time I was out on a small hobie cat, we were told never to tack. I tried it right away, got stuck, had to rock myself free. Second attempt went much better, only because I kept up my speed by avoiding staying close to the wind prior to the tack.   They were small enough boats that a 340 degree turn with a jibe was often faster than even a well planned tack.  They just spun on the spot with proper sheeting."

It's used as the tracker for the Lake Ontario 300 race that I've done the past couple years and it's awesome to be able to send a link to family and friends to follow you on a race, or to watch other boats you follow as they race if you aren't involved. Also to be able to go back after the race and see where you gained and lost by being able to follow all the boats at once like that.  it's also always funny to go back after it's all over and see the few people who forgot to turn in their trackers and you can see them heading home after the race ends.

Depends on what you're looking for, family vacation, quiet secluded ports or the more active areas etc. Not familiar with the long island and western Connecticut stops but I grew up in Narragansett/buzzards bay.   Newport is always a good stop if you're looking to do touristy shipping or hard drinking, might be hard to find some space as it gets crowded on the weekends.   We always stopover at cuttyhunk island, nice quiet harbor, very peaceful. Stop for a swim at tarpaulin cove on the way to or from martha or woods hole.   The quickest way to ptown once youre out of the canal is a straight 15 20 mile shot across the bay, can make for a long day depending what you're sailing on. If you're looking to get an early start on that, wake up in onset harbor, the closest point to the west entrance to the canal. I would warn that the entrance to this harbor is VERY difficult to navigate if you catch it on the wrong side of the tide. Easily could find yourself getting sucked toward the breakwater at 5 knots with the current. Peaceful once youre in there, but not much to do."

I don't want to rush, but I don't think it will be as relaxed as the previous trip, when I had more days and less distance to cover.

Being confident with your ground tackle is essential when cruising, because you can't always get a mooring. When you know how to anchor properly and safely, you will gain confidence and sleep well.   I keep my boat at Mt Sinai (just East of Port Jeff) and when we go East, usually drop anchor at Duck Island Roads (outside of Westbrook CT) for the first night.

sailing,38oqao,vigilantecat,1 point,Fri Jun 5 17:10:52 2015 UTC,"For example, the biggest complaint against the modern water-ballasted Macgregors is that they are very tender.  It only takes a 10 knot breeze to push you over to 30 degrees."
sailing,38oqao,POTUS,2,Fri Jun 5 17:09:56 2015 UTC,Is the Macgregor S less tender or the same?
sailing,38oqao,gravshift,4,Fri Jun 5 21:38:01 2015 UTC,"The very nature of a water ballasted boat makes it more tender.  An iron ballast, like any Macgregor 26D or before, is always pulling the boat upright with its full weight.  If you move the boat 1 degree off level, the keel will pull with 600 pounds to try to get it level.  Water doesn't ""weigh"" anything until you get it above the waterline.  So when you tip a water ballast 1 degree, only the portion of that ballast tank that is above the waterline will pull the boat upright.  Probably, that amount is zero, so only the width of the beam will push the boat back to level.  Only once you get a significant heel will you get enough of that ballast above the waterline that it can make a difference.  Another important note about water ballast tanks is that they are inside the boat.  They are below the waterline, but not far below.  An iron keel is probably 4 or 5 feet below the waterline.  The additional distance below the waterline gives the keel a much greater level of torque to pull the boat.  So water ballasts are usually about double the total weight of an equivalent iron ballast, while still leaving the boat tender.  I think the 26S is a swing keel.  That's a full iron keel that swings down away from the boat.  It's actually quite well ballasted and really stiff for a small, cheap, trailerable boat.  The keel swings up (on a winch) so that you can motor around in shallow water and/or get the boat up onto a trailer.  The trade-off is that the keel is now a moving part.  It's pinned in place with a through-bolt through the hull, which can leak or even break if you don't keep it in service.  The boat is also small and light for its length, so it bobs around on the waves more than other boats in its class.  There's also not a lot of head room in the cabin.  Neither class of boat can sail in less than 5 feet of water.  The water ballasted boat has a lifting centerboard to keep the boat from drifting sideways.  The swing keel does the same thing, and also ballasts the boat.  Any moving done with the keel/centerboard up should be done with the engine.  Whether this kind of boat is right for you is a personal choice.  Even though the water ballasted boats are a bit tender, they stiffen up when it really matters, so they're fully capable sailboats.  Swing keels are stiff the whole time as much as any equivalent fin keel.  But overall the whole class is less seaworthy than a fixed keel.  So you have to decide if you want a boat that's more seaworthy, or more versatile with shoals and trailers.  Edit:  No, maybe the 26S is water ballast?  In that case it's tender.  I am seeing it both ways on the internet, so you'd have to find out for yourself with a particular boat.  If it has a water tank to fill up before sailing, then the boat is going to heel quite a bit."
sailing,38oqao,POTUS,2,Fri Jun 5 22:17:15 2015 UTC,I am just curious as I am an inland sailor right now and the water ballast is the difference between getting a cabin boat or a daysailer.  I am not buying an f150 to tow around a 5000lb Hunter.  Won't be for a while of course.
sailing,38oqao,gravshift,2,Fri Jun 5 22:32:35 2015 UTC,"Well, then I think your choice is between a water ballast and a swing keel.  The water ballast is what's in production now, and for some good reasons.  But if you are going to have anyone aboard who is not a sailor, she probably won't be comfortable with the amount of heel.  The stiffer swing keel of the older boats make it much more family friendly.  I pull my boat with a Tacoma, and I can sail with my wife aboard without any screaming.  My first time on a 26S*, even I was a bit nervous with the amount of heel in even a little wind, and that amount of heel all the time makes for an uncomfortable ride that could otherwise be avoided.  *: Now I remember, the 26S is definitely water ballast."

These dealings resulted in a loss of public money, estimated at a minimum of $600 million and the insolvency of several large corporations.  Bond and Connell were major contributors to the party in government, the Australian Labor Party and its remarkable fundraising structure, the John Curtin Foundation.

sailing,38n6pp,FlickrPaul,2,Fri Jun 5 10:50:39 2015 UTC,"Most weekends I teach dinghy lessons at my sailing club on the SF Bay, here are some random tips from my experience.   Capsize. Seriously. Teaching capsize recovery as early as possible usually eliminates any trepidation students might harbor and boosts their confidence.   Talk through the maneuvers, and have your students be able to describe the procedure. When you're an experienced sailor the basics like tacking and gybing become natural and we forget what's really involved because the checklist of things to do is hard wired. For new students it's not. For example, when tacking give the student a mental checklist like:  Ask if crew is ready. Make sure everyone responds. Check over your shoulder. Call out the maneuver. Push the tiller away from you. As the sail comes over the boat calmly switch sides. As you go to sit on the opposite side and the boat is through the wind, switch tiller hands behind your back and straighten up.   In a lesson before having a student make a manuver for the first time in that lesson, have them first recite what they are going to do. Fill in what they left off. Watch them closely as they make the maneuver so you can see what tips they need. For new students, work the sheet for them when they tack. Once they seem to have it down then have them run the sheet as well.   You're going to have to spend a lot of time looking backwards at the student, so if there are other students aboard make sure they know that they should be looking out for traffic and calling it out.   When students are crewing, get them to hike out. If the wind makes hiking out unnecessary, hike out yourself on the lee side so you can get your students out over the rail.   In cold water or weather (which probably isn't much of a problem on the sound in summer, but anyway), bring an extra hat. Just a small cap you can fold up and stuff in a pocket. If a student starts to get chilly, give them the hat. It can make a big difference.   You can never practice man overboard drills enough.   Once someone has a basic tack and gybe down properly, make them do circles as tightly as possible around a buoy until they are exhausted.  This will transition the student from having to think about making the maneuver to that muscle memory autopilot stage.   Don't forget that communication is one of the most important sailing skills. Announce everything you are doing, and make sure the students are doing the same. Get them to speak confidently and loudly."

He said if you turn power on it and it clicks. That is it working so it is still good.   He also said they will NOT work out of water.   so.. you probably didnt need to replace it. (The new one is probably nicer)   On the first boat I rejected someone painted over the transducer too. He said. ""It is clicking so I am sure it is working""   I thought that was interesting.   ""When they go they dont click anymore""   Thanks for the After effects tip.

They are a little brighter white than the yellowish (manila?) main sheets.   Thinking about the forces on those traveler blocks: If the main sheet is being pulled under tension, the traveler will be pulled in the same direction.  Perhaps releasing tension on the other side of the line will allow the traveler to move, thus shortening the main sheet and moving the traveler to windward at the same time."

sailing,38ismy,wakenbike,2,Thu Jun 4 17:00:43 2015 UTC,"To expound on your question a little more, that budget sounds doable for sure. If you are willing to be frugal you can reasonably expect to spend around 5-800 a month on food and other such necessities. Just do your research on what kind of boat you know would be good for the trip and then be patient and search search search. You WILL find a great deal out there if you look high, low and patiently. You may need to be willing to travel to purchase as well. But find a solid boat and if you buy for 6k, plan on using about half that amount again to outfit it appropriately. Not always, but its a good rule of thumb so to speak. The cool thing about sailing is that if you run out of money, meet up with some other sailors who need help and use your knowledge to help them. They will return the favor for you! Its a community of people looking for and loving adventure. Pay it forward and it will all come back around to you! Good luck out there and maybe we will see each other out on the water someday!"

sailing,38ismy,tkaraszewski,2,Thu Jun 4 17:57:24 2015 UTC,"As a general expectation, if you buy the boat for 6k, expect to put another 3k into it to get it the way you want it. Like I said, not always that way, but a good way to be prepared once you make the purchase"

sailing,38ismy,Rhody401,2,Thu Jun 4 17:40:16 2015 UTC,"My friend bought a 23' Hunter for $1500 in early spring of 1995.  Transporting it home, a trailer tire blew, he jackknifed on the highway and the two cradle arms went through the hull.  The insurance company totaled it, he bought it back from them for like $50, and learned to fiberglass.    He gutted the boat and rebuilt it at the boatyard.  I and another friend helped.  Having never been on a sailboat before, I gave up my job, my apartment, put everything in storage but what fit in a duffle bag, and the three of us launched from Portsmouth, New Hampshire bound for the Caribbean.  The Hakuna Matata carried us down the seacoast, we goofed around a lot, and the trip, sadly, ended in Ocean City Maryland when the fist mate ran off with a girl.  Our keel depth prevented us from taking the ICW, so the next leg would take us out to sea for at least two or three days, and the captain was not confident enough in my brand-new abilities to undertake that leg with just us two.    We weathered a storm with 12 to 15 foot swells.  We came in to the Trump Castle marina at night - oh the lights of Atlantic City!  We hunkered down on a mooring in a NYC marina while police helicopters circled overhead and gunfire sounded out across the water.  We met interesting sailors from around the world.  We caroused.  We were hobos of the ocean, and it was one of the richest times of my life.  I have three regrets.  The first is that one day, out of sight of land, my towel was blown from the rail and I made the split second decision not to jump in after it.  I miss that towel.  The second regret is that I did not do everything in my power to convince Cap'n to continue our quest to reach the Caribbean.  The third is that I did not keep a daily audio journal."

sailing,38ftos,jtunjdevil,7,Wed Jun 3 22:53:03 2015 UTC,"Here's my advice... (My own re-post) Want to sail for FREE? Here's how... You check your local sailing mag for race days in your area (Here in SF we have Latitude 38, brilliant rag...). Dress in layers and go down to your Marina/Yacht Club with a cardboard sign that reads, ""RAILMEAT FOR HIRE"" or ""WILL SAIL FOR FOOD""... seriously, I mean this... This is literally how I got into the sport and I've had a blast ever since... See, these guys that get the big boats NEED people to run them. It's a challenge racing a 40ftr. single handed! Even if you're a Noob we always need weight on the rail, makes the boat go faster! Be honest with your Skipper about how much experience you have in sailing and he'll put you in the right spot on board. My first few times out I was the Beer Man / Rail Meat... still had the time of my life. As a beginner you need to listen to all the more experienced sailors on board, don't be afraid to ask stupid questions, learn to tie a bowline and above all... DON'T FALL OFF THE BOAT! Also try to have a thick skin as some Skippers can be rather loud when giving orders. Don't take it personal, it is what it is... If you find yourself getting seasick do not be afraid or embarrassed to hurl, we've ALL done it and you usually feel tons better afterward. I cannot stress the importance of a PFD. That would probably be the most costly part of your gear for right now (a good one is around $120 - $150) but it is a MUST HAVE and you need to get in the habit of wearing it ALL THE TIME. Sea water is really cold and wet clothes are really heavy, not good for your health at all. I've got more tips but not enough time for now... Best of luck to you!!"
sailing,38ftos,RenHoeX,1 point,Thu Jun 4 05:13:59 2015 UTC,Do you have a recommendation for a PFD in the $120 - $150 range?    I've been wanting to get a decent inflatable with a harness for a while but they seem to be $200 and up.  Is that the type you'd recommend?
sailing,38ftos,liflo,1 point,Fri Jun 5 23:35:30 2015 UTC,"I use an auto-inflatable because I'm usually on the foredeck so I have a Mustang that cost $200 at a sail-expo. A lot of my other crew friends seem to like the Spin-Loc because of the freedom of mobility. Mine does seem a little constricting at times but if I'm offshore I'd like to keep my survival rate as high as possible. None of us recommend the float jackets, too bulky and hot. All vests will have a different feel based on how YOU intend to use it. If you're just railmeat then those full on vests are great because you can lean the float material against the lifelines for that long distance comfort. If you're always grinding the jib you're gonna want something that gives you good arm mobility.   It's a great question to ask and get opinions on. Good luck on your search."
sailing,38ftos,RenHoeX,5,Sun Jun 7 20:48:16 2015 UTC,"I know most people will say to ask around your yacht club. But, mine is on the bay and they only sail on the bay. So that won't work.   You need to start somewhere with big boats, its gonna be tough to get on an offshore race with zero experience. Ask around and start getting used to big boats.  Also, you never know what kind of connections the guys you sail with may have. Taking the attitude ""they only sail around the bay"" is the wrong thing to do. Yes, none of the boats at your club may do offshore/distance races, but that doesn't mean the sailors don't."
sailing,38ftos,rossco-dash,2,Wed Jun 3 23:03:24 2015 UTC,"A lot of people that race don't own just one raceboat. There are several guys here that race S2 7.9s, Melges 24s and Big Beneteau's. So race on the bay and you'll probably run into a couple of these guys. Or find someone that does know one of them. I swear the ones here are all over the country every other weekend for a different race."
sailing,38ftos,enuct,1 point,Thu Jun 4 01:59:39 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure about where you are located but in most places I've sailed the number of offshore racing boats is quite small in comparison to the fleet in port.  I recommend you research the offshore races in your area and identify boats that participate regularly. Some races need the boat to be delivered to the port where the offshore race will start and this is where you can both crew and learn the boat. Most boats would be delighted to have you as a delivery crew and that's almost a guarantee into the race crew selection process - so long as you fit in of course.  As an example, we have a list of 18 for a crew requirement of 8 and last Saturday we raced with 5. Believe me, most boats are shorthanded..."
sailing,38ftos,oldestswingerintown,1 point,Wed Jun 3 23:27:01 2015 UTC,Most clubs have a posting board (either online or at club) where people can post as crew and boats post looking for crew.  As you will need to start sailing inshore before someone is going to take you offshore.

sailing,38ftos,invisty,1 point,Thu Jun 4 00:18:19 2015 UTC,"Try and see if there is casual racing, usually called beer cans. People are always looking for crew and it can let you learn bigger boats in an environment with less expectations."

sailing,38eeug,gravshift,6,Wed Jun 3 19:32:41 2015 UTC,"Central NC Lakes.  Specifically, Jordan Lake and Kerr Lake.  Jordan Lake Pros:    Close to home.  10 minutes away from my house That's where my boat is trailered, so... I don't have to step the mast every time I launch. Overall everything is just easy getting out on the water, I can be out with the sails up within an hour (or less) from deciding to go.  Single handed. Water warms up quickly.  It was already reasonably comfortable to swim there mid-May.   Jordan Lake Cons:   It's fairly small.  The area bounded by low bridges is about one square mile of water. Flooded timber.  The lake is a dammed river, and there are still remnants of the pine forest that was there in the form of actual trees sticking up out of the water.  It's well charted and visible, but still off putting. There's no sense of adventure.  I know every inch of the accessible part of the lake.   Kerr Lake Pros:   Much bigger lake.  I can spend half the day or more sailing in one direction, even with favorable winds. Lots to see, lots to do, parks and docks and launches all along the lake, etc. Always something going on, sailing clubs, races, etc. Deep enough to not be a concern at all.   Kerr Lake Cons:   It's an hour drive from where my boat is kept.  Dragging a 25' boat behind a truck for an hour is expensive. Have to step the mast to launch.   The next step is Pamlico Sound, which is about 2.5 hours away from me.  That has all the pros and cons of Kerr Lake, but scaled up.  And it has better wind generally.  I haven't actually made the trip yet, though.  That's on the plan for later this month.  My boat:  Venture 25"

This summer I plan to explore more of the lake by spending a night on the boat for the first time.  The wind near miles 19-16 is often light, so I'm tired of seeing the same parts of the lake!

Pros: Chicago is probably the largest American city with such a strong sailing culture right in the city. Many Harbors and boaters make for great festivals and shows right on the lake. Best skyline around. The backdrop you sail against is gorgeous. Pull up next to northerly island and take in a concert from the lake or enjoy fireworks off navy pier twice a week.

I sail in the Solent in the UK (between the Isle of Wight and Southampton) the spiritual home of yacht racing.  Challenges  Biggest challenges are easily the tides, at peak it can run at 5knts and the difference between aggressively hugging the shore and tacking a few boat lengths early can be as much as 1-2knts. We once had an American tactician on who asked why one our primary instrument displays shows the depth at all times, he soon understood. Running aground is an occupational hazard.  Other than that the two big things are commercial shipping, Southampton is one of the busiest ports in Europe and all that shipping comes right through the main race area and a vicious short chop which develops in wind against tide conditions.   Pros  One of the most tactically challenging and varied race areas in the world (ok I'm biased). Centuries of tradition, some awesome pubs, great parties, a good community also crucially only an hour from London.   My boats  All OPB (other peoples boats) spent a couple of seasons on this.

sailing,38fp5h,stazy,1 point,Fri Jun 5 01:19:52 2015 UTC,"First, there are typically 4 crew (these are the names I learned, so): skipper, chute (spinnaker), boards, and jib. The skipper helms the boat and controls the main, obviously. The chute and the boards crew are in charge of flying the spinn on the downwind legs. The chute is also in charge of controlling/ sheeting the spinnaker. The boards are in charge of the dagger boards, and the jib, well, they control the jib.   The skipper sits at the helm, followed by the chute, then the boards, and finally the jib at the bow.   The boat will most likely be laid out, rigging wise, similarly to a 420. Main sheet will be blocked to the spine, and the spinnaker sheets will be on the deck of the boat, usually where the chute sits. The board lines will be apparent, and if not ask! The jib, depending on whose boat it is, will be a continuous sheet or 2 separate jib sheets.   Some advice I can give is, regardless of your position is to keep your ears open and you head on a swivel. Always do what the skipper asks; do it quickly and correctly. If you have any questions, ask your skipper or the other crew on the boat. Most importantly though: have fun with it. Racing Es can be terrifying at times but they are righteous boats to race and when they are sailed properly are a blast! Good teamwork/ communication will get you bullets! Cheers!"

It was an absolutely beautiful boat, the owner had blown a tranny on the port side and it was fucked. When we were removing it we unattached all the engine mounts and everything. Then since we didn't have a big enough lift we had to hire these outside our business crane operators. So we strap it up and everything get of the Viking and stand back while the lift the engine out. There was one guy standing about five feet from the engine in the cabin but he was safe. So there lifting, lifting, lifting, then when there just above the gunnel, we here a large clang metal break sound, the hook at the end of the crane failed and the engine fell on the gunnel basically destroying the whole side of the boat. I literally stood there in absolute awe, had no clue what to do or how to proceed. I looked over at the head mechanic, he was also just staring not knowing what to do. We ended up cleaning everything up stripped the engine where it fell, the block survived, but everything else was fucked. Insurance came, the claims men almost declared the boat unsalvageable but somehow it passed, like I shit you not, half the transom and the freeboard area were all just gone, with carnage everywhere.

When I was the head instructor at our junior sailing program I was also in charge of maintenance. We had a pretty old fleet of 420's I had been nursing along and we finally got them to replace the fleet over a few years.   When it came time to retire the first two boats the hulls were junk but we wanted some of the hardware for spare parts. These particular hulls didn't have access into the tanks, you installed a porthole yourself if you ever had to get in there. We never had on these 2 so I couldn't get to the back of the deck hardware to undo it. The other problem was disposal of the hulls, it would be expensive to throw something that big away at the dump.  Time for a little fun. I ran home and grabbed some long pants and longsleeves, safety gear, and my chainsaw with my oldest chain on it. First I cut out all of the hardware we wanted, then started cutting the hulls into 3 foot chunks. Had both boats in a small pile within 30 minutes and I was itchy for about a month but that was a lot of fun.  Came back the next summer to find someone had cut a small hole in one of the bows turning it into a birdhouse and mounted it on the side of the repair shed, thought that was pretty cool."

Recently I had my 29 foot Lancer sailboat pulled out in order to replace a couple of through hulls and clean off the bottom. As the engine had been running kind of warm, one of the through hull fittings to be replaced or at least cleaned was for the engine water intake. Mounted around the intake, of course, is the large screen that keeps junk out of the intake. Standard stuff. It's only grated at one end, with the other end being enclosed, which means that you have to aim it towards the bow so that water can actually be ""scooped"" up the intake.   The last person to install it had aimed it towards the stern.  Needless to say we flipped it back around and pointed it the correct direction. The engine cooled much more effectively after that."

sailing,38d4ah,WhatLine,3,Wed Jun 3 21:08:05 2015 UTC,"Pulled my 1960 King's Cruiser out onto the hard to do some work on the bottom. Work took longer than anticipated so she ended up drying out for a couple of weeks.    Background: The King's Cruiser is of a ""Modern"" Carvel hull design whereby the white-oak planks butt up against each other and rely on the natural swelling of the immersed wood to seal them together. No cotton packing nor red lead required.    So, I finally got the work done, time on the marina crane scheduled, got her strapped up, lifted, swung out and lowered into the water. Got one strap removed and realized... she's sinking. Fast!  I jumped on board and poked my head into the cabin and saw that, within mere minutes, water was already above the floor boards of a 2' deep bilge. O.O  We frantically struggled to get the strap we'd just removed back under the keel and the crane began to lift the boat back out of the water.  Water sprayed out from countless seams everywhere as the boat began to empty.  After much thought and dawning solidification of the understanding of just what Carvel planking really means... I ended up rewiring my two bilge pumps, borrowing a third and purchasing a fourth and had the crane lower her back into the drink until the in-rushing torrent was just barely manageable by the four pumps running full tilt. And there she hung, overnight, strapped to the crane, dipped in the water, suspended precariously between sky and muddy ocean bottom.  By the following evening she'd sealed up maybe 30% of her leaks and could maybe once again float on her own, maybe just barely, with 4 pumps running full bore. But I was faced with a tough dilemma, because the lone crane was expensive and I was already holding up other haul-outs; do I leave her in the water without support and hope she 1) doesn't sink and 2) continues to seal her seams? Or do I pull her back out onto the hard and figure out some other solution whilst she continues to dry out, exacerbating the problem?   I decided to leave her in the water and entrust providence and luck to see her through to health.   It turns out it was a good choice. She did seal up over the next couple of days and I was able to decommission the two new pumps, replace one of her older ones with a higher GPH rating and remount/rewire the whole shebang with knowledge learned from the ordeal. After about three weeks to a month she'd returned to her normal seaworthiness of a light weeping into a wet bilge."

If you or anyone else is ever in a similar situation (having to purchase pumps overnight) I recently figured out that a small agricultural pump will shift 10x - 20x the amount of water a bilge pump will.

sailing,38d4ah,mbetter,1 point,Wed Jun 3 21:16:13 2015 UTC,"Section 3. Modern carvel methods of article  Carvel %28boat building%29:       Traditional carvel methods leave a small gap between each plank that in the past was filled with any suitable soft flexible fibrous material sometimes combined with a thick binding substance. This caulking would gradually wear out and the hull would leak. Likewise when the boat was beached for a length of time the planks would dry and shrink so when first refloated the hull would leak badly unless recaulked – a very time-consuming and physically demanding job. The modern variation is to use much narrower planks which are edge glued instead of caulked. With modern power sanders a much smoother hull is produced as all the small ridges between the planks can be removed. This method started to become more common in the 1960s with the more widespread availability of fully waterproof glues such as resorcinol (red glue) and then epoxy resin.  Modern waterproof glues, especially epoxy resin, have caused revolutionary changes in both carvel and clinker style construction. Whereas in traditional construction it was the nails that provided the fastening strength, now it is the glue. It has become quite common since the 1980s for both carvel and clinker construction to rely almost completely on glue for fastening. Many small boats, especially light plywood skiffs, are built without any mechanical fastenings (e.g. nails, screw bolts) at all as the glue is in fact far stronger.

sailing,38d4ah,SchoonerKat1,3,Wed Jun 3 21:58:29 2015 UTC,"Ah, the standard plugged marine head repair would be the worst one. Here is the full scoop:  we were in the starting sequence 3-4 minutes to start (I own a 29' race boat), when one of the crew popped out of the companion way holding a small handle and said ""Does this usually come off when you flush?""  Well, my concentration went down the toilet right there and then.  As the preparatory signal sounded, all I could think about was what was the contents of the toilet bowl, would it spill out as we heel over on the upwind legs and can we finish the race before the first bathroom break is requested by another crew member.    Anyway, we ended up finishing without any major spills, the contents of the bowl was appropriately disgusting and fixing the head turned out to be quite a puzzle (don't you just hate how everything you ever need to fix on your boat is a bitch to get to).  After trying just about everything we could think of, one of my crew members simply unbolted the whole head from the floor, capped off the hoses and handed the whole thing up through the front hatch. We poured the contents overboard (sorry fishies), doused the whole unit with bleach-water and I took it home where we had to take it all apart to fix it.  Why wouldn't we just buy a new one... good question, but there comes a point when you invest so much time into trying to fix something, that you would feel like a complete loser if you broke down and bought a new one.    So there, probably not the worst repair experience but certainly the shittiest one ;)"

Even though I had tied it off with 10 lines (all held), the pilings it was attached to broke loose and it ended up getting in a fight with a Morgan 38. Needless to say, it lost, leaving a 10 foot gash at the hull/deck joint along the port side. You could see in to the balsa core on the deck and there was plenty of sunlight in the main cabin. The gash went all the way to the chainplates.  The insurance company totaled the boat and the salvagers took it. I thought they would take it away, melt down what they could get out of the keel and salvage the engine, but instead sold it back to some old dude that wanted to live in the marina where the boat was. I think he paid maybe $1,000 for the whole thing.  When I went back to the marina about a year later (to my surprise) I see my old boat floating there with someone obviously living aboard. The gash on the side had been filled in with what appeared to be West System, snot and straw. The guy didn't use any form or template in creating the repair. He also didn't bother to finish the job. The epoxy was just thrown on, never faired, and they guy was too lazy to even bother painting it to protect it from UV. I swear it looked like the glue from Who Framed Roger Rabbit? was holding the boat together.  In my life, it has to be the most shoddy repair I've ever seen on a sailboat, especially in an area that takes load. I suppose the boat will never leave the marina, so the guy probably doesn't mind faded gelcoat and the sharp edges of the epoxy."

sailing,38d4ah,SchoonerKat1,2,Wed Jun 3 15:47:15 2015 UTC,the skipper I sail for was a few hours into an offshore race and felt something up with the steering as it was not responding properly. He opened the hatch to have a look at the rudder mechanism and it was not something that could be fixed at sea so he pulled out of the race. He then takes it to a mechanic and finds out that whoever serviced it previously (before he bought the yacht) put one of the bearings in upside down and only 2/12 bolts securing the rudder were tight. While he and the crew were depressed about turning back it could have gone very wrong if the problems started to show later in the race.
sailing,38d4ah,Sailingwife,1 point,Wed Jun 3 17:08:07 2015 UTC,"When we bought our boat the mast always leaked down into the cabin when it rains hard.  Still does in fact, and it is wearing away at the wood floor. So when walking around West Marine I saw a mast boot, I thought this would solve all my problems.  After removing several layers of duct tape from the foot of my mast, I was surprised to find it already had not one but 2 mast boots on it.  So I removed these two perfectly good boots, and put my new one on (poorly).  And so after all that incredibly sticky effort I still have the exact same leak, maybe slightly worse."
sailing,38d4ah,SchoonerKat1,1 point,Wed Jun 3 17:12:51 2015 UTC,Leaking around the mast can be a tricky one.  To be fair they usually leak rain water into the bilge... but hopefully not onto floor boards.
sailing,38d4ah,texasrigger,1 point,Wed Jun 3 15:51:42 2015 UTC,half of one nice teak and holly board is a total loss.  no idea how to fix the leaking.
sailing,38d4ah,texasrigger,1 point,Thu Jun 4 21:56:56 2015 UTC,"That's too bad :( What have you tried? So it sounds like it's leaking down the out side of the mast?   ""The best way to fix a leak is with a tarp""  First you need to identify exactly where it's leaking. It may just need some calk. I would probably head down on a dry day and carefully wet different areas with a hose to try to identify the source of the leak."
sailing,38d4ah,strolls,1 point,Wed Jun 3 14:12:02 2015 UTC,"It is a mast that goes all the way through the deck, and down into the bilge.  It is for sure leaking at the deck though as you can see it dripping inside.  So must be on the outside of the mast somewhere at the foot.  When we replaced the mast boot we filled every track, and hole we could see with calk, but it didn't seem to make a dent.  Maybe it would help to build some kind of umbrella device over the foot?"
sailing,38d4ah,IvorTheEngine,1 point,Wed Jun 3 16:17:57 2015 UTC,"(Yeah I assumed it was a keel stepped mast... otherwise you wouldn't be having the problem :P) I wonder if it could be water leaking in else where into your deck and then exiting around the mast into the cabin? What is your deck construction? (It's normal to have rain water run inside the mast and into the bilge if you have internal run halyards, but obviously not on the outside of the mast dripping on the floor boards)"
sailing,38d4ah,strolls,1 point,Wed Jun 3 20:59:46 2015 UTC,That's a bit scary of an idea.  I don't know how I'd even check if it was soft under the fiberglass without out the mast. I will take a closer look this weekend.

sailing,38f02g,Biggestnacho,2,Thu Jun 4 18:31:53 2015 UTC,You don't need a winch. On the Melges 24 we have a cunningham system (hooks into the halyard) that pulls down on the main halyard to give it the extra tension so I would suggest you try that out first.

Also you usually need to get some cunningham tension in order to get the main really tight.  Depending on the type of boat, you sometimes really need to crank on the genoa to get it tight enough, try having someone pull on the forestay when you try to get the genoa up the last little bit.  Sails could just be blown too."
sailing,38f02g,SchoonerKat1,2,Wed Jun 3 22:41:15 2015 UTC,"It doesn't seem to be all the way up the track, no.  I should check to see if it is fouled, maybe take the foot of the sail out and try running it up.  Great tip with the forestay I'll have to try that!  Thanks!"
sailing,38f02g,WhatLine,2,Thu Jun 4 02:52:25 2015 UTC,Sounds like the sails are blown to be honest. When you hoist get someone to stand back from the boat (on the dock) and make sure its right at the top. If so talk to a sail maker about getting them re-cut (or getting some new ones if you are feeling flush).

sailing,38elpv,Sld109,3,Wed Jun 3 18:42:06 2015 UTC,"Get a good degree with a decent paying career options... then buy a boat. That's what I did.    I get that you are 18... but why in the world would your parents let you dump your college savings away on a boat?   But, if you are going to by a boat. Obviously first you need to figure out what fits your needs and what is in your budget.    Comfortable cabin with light and ventilation. Being able to stand in the cabin is important. Enough storage for what you need to bring. You will want at least one sea berth. Like a snug quarter berth that you can't fall out of. A galley that you can securely use while underway is important (should be able to wedge yourself in so you don't get thrown).  A small protected cockpit would be good to stay dry and if your cockpit gets swamped it will be manageable.  A sail plan that is well laid out that you feel comfortable sailing with two people. The more you can stay in the cockpit the better.   Get out there and look at a bunch of boats for sale. Even ones that aren't quite what you want. You will learn things from looking. Things I would look at:   If the deck has a balsa core, stomp (gently) around on it looking for soft spots on the deck wear the balsa is soaked.  Take note of general maintenance quality and quality of any visible repairs.    Turn all the winches to see how they feel - you don't want to replace winches. Move other deck hardware if possible.  Look at the engine - is there a bunch of corrosion? and lots of oil leaking... probably not good. Ask to start the engine if possible, a diesel that starts nicely is a good sign. How many hours does it have? How does that compare to the typical lifespan of said engine (you don't want to have to replace the engine within the first couple years of owning the boat). Also stay away from saltwater cooled engines - I don't think any of them work at this point. Also, consider how hard it will be to get parts to fix the engine (if it's something rare). Find the chain-plates and the look for rust. Also check for leaking at stanchions. Pull up the floor boards and check out the bilge. If it has a lot of oil in it from the engine leaking... probably not good. Ideally a bilge should just have a small amount of nice clean rain water in it and not a lot else. While you are there make sure the keel bolts aren't rusty - if the boat has keel bolts.   If the boat just seems ""damp"", I would move along. There are a lot of good used boats for sale.     There are a million more things. But if you find something you want to buy, hire a good surveyor to survey it (you'll need the survey for insurance anyway).   I recently bought an old used 40' sailboat as a young person (21), feel free to PM with any questions you may have. I'm in Seattle so not too far away from a perspective standpoint. I've grown up cruising in the San Juans and Gulf Islands."

sailing,38elpv,SchoonerKat1,1 point,Thu Jun 4 00:45:26 2015 UTC,No problem! I guess the other thing to think about is what all you need to outfit a boat for ocean sailing if you are going to do a crossing and how much that will all cost. Also looking at selling prices for similar boats if you are going to make an offer.  Also you can read lots of reviews about various boats and what they are good for online.  I like using sailboatdata.com as a quick reference for general information about a model of a boat.

sailing,38elpv,enuct,2,Thu Jun 4 15:30:07 2015 UTC,"I think university is a mug's game, these days.  A lot of debt, and what does it get you?  If you buy a sailboat now and clock up some miles, in 2 or 4 years you'll be able to sit your Yachtsmaster and qualified to work in the charter business or on superyachts.  Working in yachting is probably not as well paid as a doctor or in silicon valley computer engineering, but it's a heck of a lot better than working as a barista or in a supermarket because degrees have become devalued these days, or because you chose a subject you hated and you dropped out.  There's no right answer - some will tell you to get a job and work hard, others will tell you to follow your dreams.  What I would say is that you need to be as /r/FinancialAdvice as you can, and recognise that your savings are a nest egg you should be husbanding - it's ok to spend money on a boat if it's going to save you money on rent, but you need to be aggressive in spreadsheeting your income and outgoings, and you need to be putting money in the bank wherever you can."
sailing,38elpv,Guygan,1 point,Fri Jun 5 19:38:25 2015 UTC,Yeah everyone is saying university is the safe option but I agree with your idea that it's not as safe as people think.

After a length of bead is put down, use aforementioned wooden implements to smoothen, remove excess etc... I immediately lay down fiberglass or carbon tape after doing this and finish with epoxy impregnation in one shot. (And I cut my own tape from cloth on the bias.

The effects of your inputs are so much more obvious they are a far better training tool in my opinion.   If you're scared of getting wet you can start in something in the 20 foot range(sail newport was a good suggestion) but if you try to learn from scratch on a 40-50 foot boat your going to have a bad time and I would guess never get very good.  Edit: If you just want to be a marginally useful crew to get on a boat then feel free to ignore this, but that's not really learning how to sail in my opinion. If you actually want to learn how the whole thing works not just a single position then start small."
sailing,38f5jl,SchoonerKat1,2,Wed Jun 3 22:12:51 2015 UTC,I feel like you can get pretty good at sailing small keel boats in the 24-27' range. But totally agree with the small sentiment. I have a 40' boat and grew up on a 35' boat (though I do have a sad sailing dinghy). But the boats I'm most interested crewing on are in the 24-27' range (with good skippers).

The best training I have found is on a dinghy, where my actions had immediate results. This helps build in muscle memory. Muscle memory and experience helps keep your ""real"" boats afloat.  Then again, maybe you can't swim or don't have the capability of righting a capsized dinghy. Then by all means learn on what you're capable of sailing.

sailing,38f5jl,jeffrife,2,Thu Jun 4 06:05:34 2015 UTC,"Like seriously show up at the marina. If there is a dock where boats that are being splashed from the dry yard are being tied that is a good spot (though those boats may have less spare space).  If there isn't a clear dock to go to, you can just try walking docks and looking for boats prepping to race. I would head down about an hour before the start.  Having appropriate gear for the weather and a life jacket is key. You don't need anything fancy, but you should have shoes that have non marking soles.  Also be honest about your skill level so the skipper knows what to expect. It's totally fine if you don't know what anything is called or how anything works... I just need to know that so I can teach you. And I would edge towards more casual races to start.   You can always find facebook pages and what not for local crew registries and try to get a ride that way.   Honestly, if someone walked up to my boat wanting a ride saying they had no experience, if they had proper gear, asked nicely, and looked like a reasonable human being I would oblige if I had space.  I would really only turn someone down if they seemed like a creep/ass, or there was just no space, or weather was intense and I didn't want the stress of a passenger.   Sailors are mostly pretty friendly people... so just be brave! Worst thing that could happen is they say something like ""Sorry we don't have anymore space"". Just don't walk up to the fanciest boat you can find with semi pro crew. Go for your normal folk.   edit: a word edit 2: Honestly, if I was just going for a day sail with friends (and it wasn't some sort of special occasion), I would probably pick up a random person looking for a ride as long as they met the conditions above."

sailing,38f5jl,madroaster,2,Thu Jun 4 12:58:38 2015 UTC,"There are many ways, few were mentioned below - befriending someone with a boat and/or sail dinghies are both great ideas.  Trouble is that dinghies don't seem to be as glamorous as keelboats (although you would learn much faster sailing on them, so if you are young and agile, I highly recommend them) and befriending someone with a boat might be easier said than done.    So here are a few other ideas:   Pick a few marinas and post something along the lines ""willing to help with boat maintenance and clean up in exchange for sailing lessons.""  Heck, I would call you up if I saw a note like this - trust me, most boat owners always need help with maintenance! Approach local sailing schools with the same offer.  Choose smaller schools which are active, but not quite established yet.  Most of them are a one-man operation and might be happy to stick you on a boat if a paying student cancels in exchange for free labor.  Racing - although it does sound crazy to try to learn how to sail by joining a race, I have done it and so did many other sailors I know. As long as you are reliable, flexible, easy-going, show up on time and bring beer to share, skippers will be happy to have you.  To get introduced, contact organizers of local races. Again, smaller clubs will be more accommodating than large fancy yacht clubs. Check out this link about crew positions, so you have some idea of what to expect http://www.ebsailing.ca/racing/crew-positions/  check out boat co-ops, boat shares, boat partnerships in your area.  Most of them have waiting lists (at least in our area they do), but there are new ones opening up every now and then. Visit boat shows and ask boat-reps if anyone needs help with boat deliveries. Boat brokers take boats from place to place all the time, they often hire a skipper but it's nice to have a spare set of hands.  If you offer free help and bring some references, you might just luck out.   Hope this helps to get you out on the water.  Good luck."
sailing,38f5jl,kev-lar70,2,Thu Jun 4 07:39:07 2015 UTC,"As many others have said, race. This is what I've done and I have learned far more than I could have on my own. I race twice a week (occasionally a third weekend regatta) do the odd pleasure sail, and I help with maintenance and repairs. The only money I've spent has been beers for race nights and gas to get to the marina.    It's my second season now, and I've raced a LOT. I have gained a tremendous amount of experience in lots of weather. I've also learned so much about boat maintenance and repairs that will help when I have my own boat. It has been fun and educational, and best of all, free.  Others have recommended it. I have done it and can vouch it really is as easy as going to a boat club and asking around. I got on board my first day, first try. Get racing!"
sailing,38f5jl,Guygan,1 point,Tue Jun 9 16:11:22 2015 UTC,"Call the yacht clubs, and find out when they have off-the-dock races or something, or see if they have a crew wanted list.  Maybe some Adult-Learn-to-Sail programs.  You don't have to be a member to crew for someone else."

sailing,38f5jl,StrikingEarth,1 point,Wed Jun 3 21:30:06 2015 UTC,"Find all the groups that have sailing races (usually quite a few and often many are not part of a yacht club). Several racers will usually always be in need of deckhands for these races, and the cost is usually a six pack of beer to be had after the race is over. If you're willing to travel, look in Mass, CT, NY, all the surrounding states.   If you're looking for overnight passage, you should look into working as a deckhand on ferry, tug, or other boat. These companies are always looking for deckhands, and the experience needed for some routes is minimal. As a plus, you will get paid instead of having to pay. Talk to local fishing guides and tour boat operators too., If they can't use you, they might know someone who can."

sailing,38f5jl,condor57,1 point,Wed Jun 3 23:18:17 2015 UTC,"The cheapest way to get on a boat without getting on one via knowing the right people is, starting off on a basic dinghy course, then a crew course on a yacht then some sort of Day Skipper course. (I'm from the UK I'm not sure about the qualifications available in the US).  Once you have the right qualifications you'll be able to hire the cheapest bareboat for a weekend somewhere nearby. Short of buying a cheap trailer sailor or crewing for free that'll be your best bet."
sailing,387zvh,JETEXAS,4,Tue Jun 2 14:36:23 2015 UTC,"Climbing accenders are the best method I've seen, secure, quick, and you can have someone tail you from the deck with a second halyard or help you up.   Edit: here are some of the advantages...  Really small and stowable Don't need a second person Inexpensive (relatively anyhow) Safe"
sailing,387zvh,engeleh,5,Tue Jun 2 20:19:36 2015 UTC,"From the thumbnail, I thought you were chased up the mast by a giant snake!  This method looks pretty good - I guess you could use an ascender device on a fixed line to do it safely solo.  As always with a gadget there's always a question of the number of times you're going to use it every year, and the number of years before you think it might need replacing for safety's sake - but if the only option is paying the boat yard to do a job it could pay for itself in the first job!"
sailing,387zvh,IvorTheEngine,3,Tue Jun 2 16:11:17 2015 UTC,"When I get my spinnaker halyard mounted it will be outside the mast, so I should be able to tie one end of it to my harness and then run the other end through a descender, and take up slack as I climb. That way I don't run into the issue where my wife leaves me tied off to run to the bathroom, and I'm stuck up there until she gets back."
sailing,387zvh,texasrigger,2,Tue Jun 2 16:20:59 2015 UTC,"Never ever trust a completely external halyard with your life.  I've had more than one spinnaker halyard block fail on me.  The block is out of sight and out of mind and can't be inspected until you are already up there.  The only time I trust a spin halyard is when it dives into the mast.  If the block fails I'll only drop a few feet before it fetches up on the exit.  Sure, 3 feet of freefall and I'll be convinced I'm dying but it's better than 50 feet of freefall."
sailing,387zvh,engeleh,1 point,Wed Jun 3 02:56:38 2015 UTC,A lot of boats only have external halyards... I use two.
sailing,387zvh,texasrigger,1 point,Wed Jun 3 06:51:02 2015 UTC,"I mean completely external, as in hangs from a block external to the mast like a spin halyard from a crane.  Halyards that go up over the masthead are fine."
sailing,387zvh,texasrigger,5,Wed Jun 3 12:26:47 2015 UTC,"Rigger here, go up masts daily.  I use a 5:1 tackle that I haul aloft with an existing halyard.  The halyard is always tied to the upper block.  I never trust a splice I didn't make (for a reason).  The halyard is tied to a winch with a bollard hitch.  No one in the history of ever has accidentally untied a bollard hitch so I'm comfortable knowing it wont be touched.  I wear a petzl climbing harness, generally in combination with a VERY traditional bosuns chair (wooden plank with ropes).  I secure myself with a mountain climbing harness.  There are many many advantages to this set up.  It's about as safe as it can be and it's very versatile.  The only downside is that 5:1 requires a lot of line which can be cumbersome.  My next set will be 3:1 with a ratcheting block.  I made one for a customer some time ago and really preferred it."
sailing,387zvh,hafilax,3,Wed Jun 3 02:51:42 2015 UTC,"I always got winched up the mast in a bosons chair on a halyard. I went up lots of masts because my father was a yacht broker, I was always small and light and he is afraid of heights."

sailing,387zvh,Ivebeenfurthereven,6,Tue Jun 2 15:49:50 2015 UTC,This method looks more dangerous than a bosons chair.
sailing,387zvh,0OKM9IJN8UHB7,9,Tue Jun 2 15:56:30 2015 UTC,"Can't see why - provided you still wear a harness and have a crewmember keeping you tight on a safety halyard. Ideally, two.  It's just 1000x easier to climb with your own legs than let someone else on deck do all the work by winching, especially if you're shorthanded instead of carrying a full ship's racing complement of winch gorillas."
sailing,387zvh,enuct,2,Tue Jun 2 16:04:18 2015 UTC,"In my (limited) experience, if your halyard winch is well lubricated, it's really not that hard to winch a light (under  200lbs) person up."
sailing,387zvh,JackleBee,2,Tue Jun 2 21:50:31 2015 UTC,Yea but lets assume you're installing something and have to go up and down several times. Nothing beats a mast ladder in that situation.

sailing,387zvh,4rest,2,Tue Jun 2 16:19:16 2015 UTC,"Just FYI, people in free climbing still always uses a harness and a second guy to belay - free just means no tools lick a pick. I think you mean ""free solo"", which is climbing without safety ropes."
sailing,387zvh,Guygan,3,Wed Jun 3 11:30:40 2015 UTC,"When I climb I'm wearing a harness with a line that is being winched up just like a boson's chair. The difference is that the person winching me only has to take up slack, not carry my entire weight. It would only be more dangerous if you were to climb with no harness."
sailing,387zvh,Judzies,1 point,Tue Jun 2 16:01:19 2015 UTC,"When I go up in a chair or harness I do the same thing. I climb, they pull up the slack. No need for a freaky ladder or big muscles on deck."

I use Linux, OpenCPN, RTLSDR plugin, and 3 of the dongles. I receive AIS, and can monitor channel 16 VHF and of course receive OTA weather fax.  This can be done in Windows 7 (others I am sure but have no 1st hand knowledge), without the VHF 16 monitor mode.  A search of RTLSDR on Amazon will reveal a wealth of hardware.  Its a European digital TV tuner & FM radio that can be controlled and repurposed.  I bought 5 of the dongles for less than $100, and less then another $100 on antennas and parts and whatnot.  There is also a Linux distribution called Navigatrix that allows SSB radio control and WX scheduling, along with a host of other sea worthy items.  Hope this helps."

Old school wx with paper is impossible to beat, I'll give you that.

Even after cleaning the hull down to the gel, I couldn't find any evidence of blister repair.

A flood like this used to be one of the things that fertilized the ocean, and big floods were taken in stride.  When I was a kid, there was no sewage treatment, and nutrients went straight into the bay, either dumped or leached from septic tanks. It was a green mess, and would probably be classed as a biohazard today. I learned to sail in it, and any little nick immediately turned into an infection.  In the '70s we got treatment plants, and the difference is incredible. When we have a few low-wind days, you can see 8 or 10 feet through the water.   There's still a lot of nutrients in the sand though. One of the researchers wanted to see if the fresh/brackish interface of the groundwater lens move with the tide,  but there was so much nitrogen in the sand it actually had a higher ionic content than the seawater."

You might want to drill a few pilot holes into the bottom edge of the rudder and let sit for a week. If you can put a bucket or anything under to see amounts of leakage, that would be better. If nothing comes out/ or very little weeps out, I would say you are safe. Fill the pilot holes with epoxy, cover with interprotect, bottom paint and go sailing. If you do see a sizable amount, more than a a tablespoon per day (rule of thumb)/depending on rudder size, you need to let it sit and ""dry out."" If it is really wet and you see a few tablespoons every day for more than a week, you may need to rebuild as the fiberglass has lost most it's strength with a rotten core."

sailing,385af3,rantifarian,1 point,Wed Jun 3 01:45:25 2015 UTC,"I think dinghy manufacturers can amortise the extremely high cost of the tolling for alloy rudders over a lot more boats. Given the much greater size and loads on leadmine rudders, it seems unlikely to be a good choice. Extruded alloy rudders are also restricted to a constant section, ie a square bottom, which is less efficient than the elliptical sections used by most performance based boats"

I thought Jenneau did alloy on big boats though.
sailing,385af3,FlickrPaul,1 point,Wed Jun 3 02:08:21 2015 UTC,"Extruded foils have an aerofoil section, but a square planform. I was referring to the tip treatment, the bottom section of the rudder should be tapered or elliptical when viewed side on.  I know a few of the french builders do alloy rudders, but they are usually fabricated with a structural framework and then alloy skins over the top. Very labour intensive"
sailing,385af3,rantifarian,1 point,Wed Jun 3 02:53:23 2015 UTC,"I would probably explore it being a prep issue first. But, drilling in is probably the thing to do. I would first drill into the blisters to see if there is moisture in the core behind them.  Potentially you could also drill along the bottom edge of the rudder to see if there is moisture there (to asses how water logged the core is if you think that could be an issue). Good luck!  My rudder has a blister that I have yet to deal with. Nice thing about rudders is that that are separate from the boat and can be replaced (and upgraded!). I find that a comforting thought.

They are 14+ , they are teenagers and want to be treated like young adults. I'm not really sure if playing educational sailing games (whatever that may be) is the best strategy for holding their interest. Honestly I was a sea scout because there were boys in it (I'm a girl) and wanted to get out in boats away from my parents (which backfired when my dad ended up skipper, ha).   Though, toy/model sailboats on a reflection pond would be fun. If you could somehow get a couple of rc sailboats and let the scouts (maybe do teams from a cost standpoint) race them on a pond or something. Both learning and fun should occur.   Edit: Also just non rc model sailboat that will sail could be good from a learning standpoint.  Set them on a trim and try to sail them to the right direction... etc."

I guess your best bet would be to go along and ask the club when you get there. Absolutely the best way to learn is to build your practical and theoretical knowledge hand-in-hand. You probably don't want to do too much theory on the direct fundamentals beforehand, because once you get on the boat a lot of what you've learned will go out the window as you'll initially be focusing on boat handling the vast majority of the time. Videos would certainly be a great way to get an idea of boat handling before you get on the water, as these concepts are very hard to learn from a book alone as there are many controls to a boat and understanding how they relate to one-another without visual aid is mighty difficult. Information that is less about boat handling and more about related topics like boat construction/repairs/radio/meteorology/navigation would be appropriate to read in-depth. Understanding the aforementioned topics will also be crucial to a safe passage while offshore.  Your long-term goals seem entirely reasonable. Make sure you've done a few thousand miles of coastal sailing and been through a few survival situations in your offshore boat and within range of assistance before you head out into the unknown.   If your budget is small and lessons/rentals are expensive, consider taking a few lessons, then buying a small one-man monohull dinghy(a few K for a quality model) and a PFD to learn the fundamentals of sailing on your nearest lake. A few years of dinghy sailing is a great low-cost approach prior to moving onto larger yachts. Going from a dinghy to a keelboat is a lot easier than having minimal practical experience and getting onto a keeler."
sailing,385o2o,invisty,2,Tue Jun 2 01:26:41 2015 UTC,"Dinghy sailing is the best way to learn, so you have the right idea there.  However, you need some basics before you get on a dingy, so you don't get into trouble - at minimum, you need to know how to tack/jibe, how to depower (ease main sheet), what to do when you capsize and generally how to get from A to B and then back to A.  32 is not a bad age to start.  Sounds like you like reading about things, so do read all you can and watch videos.  However, many concepts will only start to make sense once you have done them on the water.  The google map of the local club someone posted seems to have a lot of sailboats.  If you have time but not money, post a notice at the marina entrance that you'll help with boat maintenance/cleaning for free in exchange for some sailing time on the water.  As a boat owner, I know that I always look for help with maintenance.    Another thought - ask the club if they hold local races.  If they do, ask to be put on the crew list.  Show up on time, help to set up and put away the boat, never cancel last minute and bring beer to share and you'll be on your way to be the most favorite crew whether you know how to sail or not.  At 32, you are young enough to learn a ton about sailing by helping out during races.  It's certainly not for everyone, but many of us who love to sail and have or had limited budget, started out as crew on raceboats.   To find out what you are getting yourself into, here is a little write up on some of the crew positions http://www.ebsailing.ca/racing/crew-positions/ .  Do completely ignore all this says, if you hop on a cruise boat.  If you want to help out on a cruise boat, learn how to make tasty snacks and mix beverages :)  Hope your dream works out.  Sounds like you have it all planned out.  I recommend that you speed-track your learning a bit, so you can do your Caribbean adventure at 42 - a much more fun age to share tight space with a bunch of crazy sailors.  Happy sailing!"
sailing,385o2o,WhatLine,1 point,Sat Jun 6 06:42:43 2015 UTC,"I would get a small dinghy to sail in a near by body of water so you learn about sailing first hand before you take the plunge into keel boat sailing. You would not have to spend much to find a use dinghy in decent shape, Heck I got my laser for $800 and it sails like a dream."
sailing,385o2o,Cramved,1 point,Tue Jun 2 14:37:28 2015 UTC,"Buy a cheap little dinghy and get started with that ASAP. All of the stuff like navigation, anchoring, planning trips etc will make a lot more sense viewed with the experience of actually having sailed, even if it is in a laser or sunfish. If you buy a cheap <$1000 boat, you should be able to sell it on at roughly the same price, and you will have a great time. Crewing for other sailors is also a great option, and is usually close to free. Finding a local sailing club and asking around will give you pointers on what is available in your area  Dinghy sailing is a very good way to learn the fundamentals of sailing, as there is nothing to hide your mistakes, but making those mistakes isn't a big deal, you will just end up a bit wet. Big boats have keels, winches, wheel steering, all of which dampen the feeling and response from the boat, and if you break something it costs much more.  Planning this sort of thing long term is great, but IMO the most important part is to get started straight away. Too many people fall in love with the idea of sailing, and read lots of books, follow lots of blogs, when they could have been on the water"

sailing,37z9xt,kmo9e,9,Sun May 31 20:54:23 2015 UTC,"This was last week (late May).  Took 9 days total averaging 8-10 hours of sailing each, plus one overnight.  Total distance was 572NM.  Air temps were 40-55F out on the water, usually 60-70F as we approached shore.    The great lakes have about 20% of the world's freshwater.  I have a foot pump to draw ""sea water"", which I use for drinking water: no filtering, no boiling.  I've heard there are some mild tides on lake Superior, but I've never noticed them myself.    Depths are regularly > 200 feet, though obviously some reefs to look out for too.   Lakes smell like... well... water with no salt.  You definitely know you're sailing, but it doesn't have that characteristic smell of being on the sea shore."

Just North of the passage & Hog Island, it was over 30kts for about an hour.  Here in this picture it was probably 20.  Though, I agree, there should be more white caps if that were the case.  I must have taken this shot in one of the lulls or lees.    The waves get big, but only if the wind is really running in a consistent direction for a long time. There are no tides or long current swells to add to the waves.    Crew was reefing and setting sail every 5 minutes."
sailing,37z9xt,ubetchya,2,Mon Jun 1 05:18:55 2015 UTC,"You may well have had 20+ or even more on your anemometer. With very low water temperature, and a very tall mast (I think you're a bit over 70 feet?)  the wind shear (difference beetween surface wind and wind at your masthead) can easily be 15 knots this time of year.   As you mentioned cold temps in the middle of the lake and warm near shore reinforce the idea of major wind shear.  It creates some pretty incredible sailing conditions when this happens."

For the most part (if you can) move your jib car forward to close off the top of the sail.

Get some telltales on there, and put them in enough places that you ensure that the entire vertical profile is pulling properly.  Also if you have time in the leg, consider easing the halyard just a TINY bit. The danger on this is that you cannot then tighten it for an upwind or reaching leg when there is pressure on the sail,  or that you simply forget to do so."
sailing,37yn28,simple2fast,1 point,Sun May 31 15:51:19 2015 UTC,"From my limited experience: For a beam-reach or broad-reach, imagine there is a boom attached to your jib and make it parallel to your actual boom (assuming you've trimmed the main and your tell-tales are flying properly). If you're running down-wind, let the jib out until you've created a deep pocket in the sail, while still keeping your jib tell-tales flying. Always be careful when running as the boom will try to jibe since it's on the bitter edge of back-filling (especially in heavy seas where wave action messes with sail pressure).  This is a decent graphic for mainsail trim: http://imgur.com/3pr1094"
sailing,37yn28,pacificsun,1 point,Sun May 31 17:24:12 2015 UTC,"Fly the ticks on the jib. Testing often by  easing  till they drop , then trim in so they fly. That's it . Period. Someone else said same earlier."
sailing,37yn28,ibeboatin,1 point,Mon Jun 1 18:19:58 2015 UTC,"From a beam to a broad reach, don't worry about the inside telltales.  If you're flying both inside and out, your sheet's too tight.  On a port tack, you want the green straight back and worry less about the red."
sailing,37zaux,hoddinr,1 point,Sun May 31 17:52:59 2015 UTC,I always loved the look of cat rigged boats. The seem to be so roomy and simple to sail. Never sailed them except for sunfish and optis

sailing,37zqmt,Hellvis,3,Sun May 31 22:52:21 2015 UTC,I have sailed a few times. Once at a sea cadets camp and few times more recently with my brother. Both boats were dinghy's. I feel confident sailing but I am most definitely a beginner.

I can't tell which builder that is, those stern cutouts don't look like any ones I'm familiar with but it could be an early Chubasco.  I'll hop on what Guygan said, if you have questions or need pictures of one that's rigged, let me know.  I'm happy to snap pics of the other boats at the club for reference.  If you get me the hull number I can look it up and see what I can find out about it.  It should have a measurer's certificate."

Even the ones that don't won't usually change because they won't change a mold, hardware can change depending on what is cheapest at the time of the build but that doesn't change how a boat looks. Every single boat has something unique to it, even if it's unique to that builder. designers change sure, but I can tell a cherubini hunter apart from a modern or a sunfish apart from a phantom. Could be that I've grown up in a boat yard and started racing in my early teens."

sailing,37zqmt,POTUS,1 point,Tue Jun 2 03:01:47 2015 UTC,"Ah I don't think that's the original sail.  That's definitely a 70s boat and that sail number is from a boat built in 1983.  Worth a shot though.  Usually the hull number was inscribed on the top of the centerboard trunk.  It's probably under those wooden strips, otherwise it'd be on the stern but I don't think they started doing that till much later."

This is a very unusual arrangement for tangs, at least in the US.  It's a Dutch made boat, not sure of the make.  The tang is, in function, almost like a double jaw toggle.  The fitting isn't at all a typical marine eye.  It's thin like an aircraft eye but with a much bigger pin than would be proportionate to an aircraft eye.  Has anyone encountered anything like this?  As a side note, this stuff was all in good condition but the much newer, conventional forestay has a failing swage (big crack in it)  Despite everything being in good condition the eyes were poorly sized relative to the pins.

Being that old it's very possibly a DIY one and the quality of the build can be basically anything. I can understand that some people might want it as a stepping stone, but nowadays how much more expensive is it to get a proper Miracle, an old Bosun, a Wayfarer, or something of the sort? any of these is going to sail sooo much better. Ok let's imagine you want something you can launch alone comfortably: maybe an old Miracle or a Topper Vibe? I understand that £150 will be tough to beat though."

Wound up buying #3.   Im a sunfish, laser, snark 420 sailer from 20 years ago. I just bought a 30 footer.   It is getting a LOT easier.. Docking was MYSTIFYING!   Why when I put this boat in reverse doesnt it TURN!   well it does a little in neutral.   I guess I could write a big long post.. but.. go find one you LOVE... get a survey (yea It costs a lot but you dont know what you are looking at yet. I paid for 2 surveys myself the first boat sucked) I learned a lot from the surveyor however.   It is great.. I got to my boat at 8am this morning.. fixed a small plumbing leak (tighted supply lines that were obviously not tightened down good at launch. ) and left the boat at 6..   It IS as awesome as you think it is going to be.   I dont understand the whole.. best 2 days is buying it and selling it days.. I have a blast every time I get on her.. When I walk down the dock and I am almost there.   That is mine!   yea.. so.. Im sure that didnt help cure the bug at all.   Go for it.. After all is said and done.. it wasnt that hard a process it wasnt that BIG of a deal and the boat is a lot better than I thought it would be."
sailing,37vxuf,hvyhitter,2,Sun May 31 00:25:22 2015 UTC,"That's awesome, congrats on the new boat. I've never worked with a boat surveyor. I would assume it would be kind of the same information you get when buying a home. Just...you know..more boat-e.   How much does a good boat survey run? Also what was it about the first boat that ended up sucking and turning you off on buying it."
sailing,37vxuf,hvyhitter,2,Sun May 31 13:09:19 2015 UTC,"Yup same as a home survey (Ive had 2 done and they ALL have missed major things when buying a home so I take surveys with a grain of salt. Boat ones are the same)   I found survey prices to range 400-800  I paid 250 the first time because we got to the deck and it was totally soaked inside. The mast step and chainplates BOTH had serious problems. We stopped the survey partial way through and he said you want to stop now I wont charge the 600 I will just charge you 250.   There was a big stress crack on port side of the keel. I had looked at this boat numerous times and I thought all I was going to have to do to the bottom was sand and repaint it. I cant believe I missed that. There was also a big repaired damage mark on starboard. (We are talking a hole a foot wide circle. I didnt see that. ) This all came out in that survey. (of the boat I rejected and walked away from. My kids, me and my wife were in LOVE with that boat and I was getting  30 foot hunter for about 4500)   Now Ive learned that the boat PROBABLY would have been ok. but it had no features. I learned ""Everyone uses autopilot"" and this boat didn't have that either. I also used brokers too. (Generally that means they start at 27 foot and up. You cant get a broker to handle a boat smaller from what I saw. Dealing with a broker was just easier. I paid cash for the boat. They did all the title work. The called me when the boat was mine. I put 10% down.. the boat was HELD.. no one could sell it from under me. It was a MUCH better feeling.   The second survey (FULL) same guy was 600.   that being said. I NOW know I could look at a boat myself and pretty much figure it out. I might get an INSURANCE survey now which is just for someone to insure it. I think it was worth the 600 to get the boat surveyed. It DID save me from buying that first boat. I am VERY VERY happy with the final boat I bought. It is very well made and is in great shape. Ive had to mess with a few things but these were all things that needed to be tightened because the people that launched the boat didn't do a great job of putting everything back together again.   I only paid 20k for my boat but boy is it in great shape and has a TON of extras. (mostly added by the last owner)   another thing I saw when looking at boats. There seemed to be NO deals on boats. Boats SEEMED to be priced exactly to how good a shape they were in. Our original budget was about 8k for a 30 footer. I went and saw from 5000-28k boats.. turns out I fell in LOVE with one I wound up getting for 20500. (Was priced 24500)"
sailing,37vxuf,SchoonerKat1,1 point,Sun May 31 14:00:24 2015 UTC,"Boat surveyors usually charge by the foot. It least in my area they charge around $18-20 per foot. I was pretty impressed with the surveyor I hired. He combed over every inch of the boat, the haul and hang for the inspection of the hull was pretty nerve wracking. The survey ended up lasting a full 8-9 hours (including a short demonstration sail) and I got a long write up of the findings a few days later.  It was kind of scary to pay $800 + another $500 to the yard to see if the boat was worth buying... But, it is a super well built boat and had no real issues (previous owner is another surveyor). The offer I made was enough under asking price that the owner said it had to be a go/no-go survey (no price negotiation), but didn't find anything expensive that needed fixing. So it all worked out great and I have a very lovely boat that was previously very well maintained (and upgraded). I feel like there is a lot to be said for the quality of work and maintenance previous owners have put into the boat."

It's been more like sailing on a river than a lake.  We were on vacation when all the floods hit and just went out last wednesday for our first sail in an (almost) full lake.

Then I owned a Santana 22, an Express 27, a J/70, and maybe soon (fingers crossed) an Islander 36.  The hardest boat I've tried to sail thus far is a Laser 2. I still don't know how to jibe a symmetrical kite on a tiny unballasted boat with the crew on a trapeze. Somehow people want me to go sail a 505 now, though.  In my experience, bigger boats are actually a lot easier to sail than smaller boats. There are other things to lean about, like anchoring, and motoring, but I feel like those things are easier and less hectic to learn than the actual sailing part."

If you can stand sailing with others it can be a great experience and cost you literally nothing.
sailing,37vxuf,rantifarian,1 point,Sun May 31 19:08:28 2015 UTC,We bought an 1984 Catalina 22 swing keel on a trailer.  Tons of learning around areas of a boat that can degrade over time was learned from hull blister to swing keel pivot pins to rigging to rudder failure and anchoring.  I cannot overemphasize learning as much as you can about anchoring.  I say all that to stress that you can leap to a 30 foot fixed keel stuck in the same body of water or you can learn (pay for stuff to fix) on a much smaller boat that costs less to fix so that when you do jump to that bigger boat you can recognize one that is equipped properly and has been maintained well in the areas that it should be.  Having the trailer is great as sailing on an inland lake is tame compared to bucking across Corpus Christi bay.  If you do wind up on Corpus Christi bay I would suggest a wise investment in a SeaTow membership prior to going out there.   So my word of advice is to get a trailerable sailboat and learn at a much cheaper rate for a couple of years before you leap into a bigger boat.  I bought my boat off of craigslist for $2500 boat trailer and outboard.  I have since spent around $4000 fixing or upgrading so now I have $6500 in the boat but I feel confident I could sail anywhere except the open ocean.

They are good boats however ill just list my issues with them... Unless I'm racing it gets really boring after a while if I'm sailing by myself. Having only 1 sail is also a bit boring (again, unless I'm racing). I'm tall and lanky so I have a hard time keeping a full rig flat also. Personally I would go for something like a 420 or the rs 400 (may be out of price range). I actually don't sail my boat often but instead crew on a laser vago.

sailing,37t6j5,AskMeAnyQuestion,12,Sat May 30 04:45:29 2015 UTC,"Seattle to San Fran is probably one of the most grueling sails if you do it anytime outside of late August and September. The wind and weather can change in a matter of hours and you have no where to run. They call it the ""Black Run"" for a reason and you only do it once by choice or twice by force ( unless someone is paying you). Even during prime weather windows it can be a hard passage as the swells come wNW and the wind comes due West making confused seas and steep waves.   Usually in most places, if bad weather is apparent you can find a safe harbor within a few hours. There is NO safe harbor to enter if the weather turns poor anywhere from Neah Bay to San Fran. There are bad sand bars at every harbor entrance and to try and shoot the bar during poor weather is a recipe for disaster. (Shooting the bar is a term meant for timing the large breaking waves and trying to sneak into the harbor between sets)  Most get at least 200 miles off the coastal shelf before turning south from the Salish Sea. The weather is a little more steady and the waves at not nearly as steep that far out. I know it may sound weird but the deeper the water, the better the conditions.  Doing it in a cat of any size would not be a problem if the cat is made for blue water sailing. Not a racing multi but something like a Gemini with a open bow would be no problem. Just need to prepared for poor conditions."

If you're stuck on the West Coast, LA-south is better: LA to San Diego, San Diego to Mexico. In the right time of year, even LA to Hawaii is an easier trip, although getting your boat back can be a pain.  If you're stuck starting in Seattle, I wouldn't know—the Seattle folk can chime in on practice overnight/weekend runs they do to work up the experience.

sailing,37t6j5,damandsire,2,Sat May 30 15:56:18 2015 UTC,"I would recommend doing the west side of Vancouver island. Plenty of great little harbors and anchorages to pull into. You can navigate up the inside passage which will be great experience testing your navigational skills then turn south and go along the Vancouver island. You will have fog but you can do short 30-50 mile hops between inlets and anchorages. Do this in September. August is known as ""fogust"" and you might have very little wind but socked in fog.  Another option that many sailors in the area do to get ocean experience is the NOAA marker. The head due west out the San Juan de fun a and go 260 nmiles due west until you reach the marker, then turn around and come home. You will need to tack the way there but the sail home would be nice and easy."

The J or L style foil they have now is simple but effective, and is best for larger boats that cannot react to puffs as quickly as say moths or similar small boat.  The J or L foil lets the boat slip sideways in event of a puff, which is a great de-powering tool for bigger breeze."
sailing,37ptl8,johnbentley,1 point,Sat May 30 02:52:29 2015 UTC,Those sensor wands are amazing piece of design. Presumably they are correcting both side to side heel; and fore-and-aft balance.  I'd like to see this working on a trimaran or catamaran with conventional sails.
sailing,37ptl8,bricolagefantasy,2,Sat May 30 10:02:33 2015 UTC,I doubt those wand will last offshore sailing. It moves and vibrates so much. It seems like a flimsy mechanical system to survive open ocean.  Maybe if it changed to optical or radar sensor type.
sailing,37ptl8,johnbentley,1 point,Sun May 31 02:45:36 2015 UTC,"Yes,  it seems like a very breakage prone mechanism. Unsuitable for cruising.  It's not only the wands but the foils the wands are meant to effect, that's moving about. So I think considering an optical or radar sensor is a good idea to play around with but probably only half the solution.  But as is, and ignoring breakability, the wands seem to be perfectly tuned to move the foils about accurately. An amazing idea even if it turns out to have limited applicability."

sailing,37rvpu,moneyor2,18,Fri May 29 21:59:37 2015 UTC,"Red flags:   You've never sailed or boated offshore. You may not like it. At all. You may get horribly seasick and spend 2 weeks wishing someone would kill you. That's how bad seasickness can be. Dude will be using a ""new to him"" boat. In other words, untested in a trip like this. Dude is a stranger. He might be a creeper. You have no idea if he's competent, or if he will panic when he has to make decisions that will save your life, or kill you, if things go wrong. Dude has never crossed an ocean before. Enough said. The ""one other girl"" may be a pro, or she may be a basket case. Again, your life may be in her hands at some point. Three people is a VERY light crew for that trip. Ideally you want a MINIMUM of two people on watch, 24/7. You won't be getting much sleep.   EDIT:  MORE red flags:   ""It is a custom built boat, so there is no maker or model (clearly someone built it but I don't know who). it is an all wood boat, with gel coated fiberglass OVER wood hull."" You are trusting your life to a homemade boat. Don't do it."
sailing,37rvpu,Guygan,3,Fri May 29 22:21:44 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much. Like I said, I have been raised my entire life on boats on lakes and rivers. I have boated in the ocean before but for small trips, nothing big. Never sailed.  I appreciate what you are saying about him being a creeper. I realized that the most important part of this is the crew you are with.  Why do you need two people on watch?"
sailing,37rvpu,Guygan,7,Fri May 29 22:57:10 2015 UTC,"Because it often takes more than one person to sail a boat that size. You need more than two hands. Also safety - in case something happens to one of you, like a man overboard situation.  There's also the cynical but true reason: in case one of you falls asleep while on watch."
sailing,37rvpu,LateralThinkerer,3,Fri May 29 23:00:50 2015 UTC,"This - it gives you someone to talk to (or at least to gloat over if they fall asleep).  All these red flags are valid.  Also as someone afflicted with boatfixing-itis, the ""Fiberglass over wood"" may or may not be bad news.  He may have gotten a rotten wooden boat, glassed it over so it wouldn't leak and be sailing off to his (and your) doom.  It may be homebuilt, which may or may not be any good.  Or it may be something else (Mexican fishing and diving skiffs are glass over wood and are built like tanks).  Why not volunteer to crew the shorter trips he has planned?  It's an added expense, but reduces the blind date factor.  Alternatelystart somewhat smaller - there are a lot of cruise/races down the West Coast (the Baja HaHa comes to mind).  There may be something like this in your area.  See if you can get a gig on one of those boats - beg if you have to - and see if it's really for you.  If it isn't, the misery will be short and you can take a bus home.  If it's really really awful they can put you off and you can drink beer on the beach.  That thing about seasickness - it's real.  Meclazine FTW."
sailing,37rvpu,rantifarian,3,Sat May 30 04:03:23 2015 UTC,"Seasickness is a horrible thing, and a good adage I have heard is that everyone gets seasick, all that varies is the conditions that cause it. We had 2 crew vomiting for 16 hours due to a confused swell and wind chop combination, both were very experienced, neither had been seasick before. Another night race we had 6 dinghy sailors, all very experienced, in small boats in daylight, all reviewing their dinner over the side. Time on power boats on lakes unfortunately means piss all when it comes to evaluating how seasick you will get offshore"

There was a stressful section for 30 or so miles where the water gets pretty thin and narrow, before open ocean again, and the release od tension after passing through the straits relaxed me more than it should have. Luckily we were just motor sailing under headsail, and there was plenty of searoom, but it's easy to see how a long blink could have made a big mess"

Because there is one thing that I do not see on that list.   The owners credentials, as what you are on is important, but it matters way more who you are on it with.  An old customer built wooden boat with a narrow beam and full keel and an under powered motor makes me almost puke just imaging how shitty it would be.  That said, if you have the funds, go to Cali and spend a couple of weeks on the boat before you make up your mind, but before you go, watch Deep Water and when you get there see if this guy is another Crowhurst, or is he more of a Moitessier de Cazalet."
sailing,37rvpu,vigilantecat,2,Fri May 29 22:45:40 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much for the response. He was saying how good of an advantage it was for having a full keel, because it meant it would be much harder to tip. I didn't even correlate that that also means it will be much slower.   He has sailed to the Virgin Islands multiple times with others but never by himself. This will be his first major trip."
sailing,37rvpu,assi9001,1 point,Fri May 29 22:54:47 2015 UTC,"The full keel could make it harder to tip, but that's just one factor. Others are ballast, form stability, and a million other things. The narrow beam will make the motion rolly. The sail usually helps steady this, but if you are going downwind, not so much."

sailing,37rvpu,jibstay77,6,Sat May 30 09:42:10 2015 UTC,"I didn't see an autopilot on the equipment list.  I wouldn't make the trip without at least 1.   You'll need good quality foul weather gear, an inflatable PFD/harness, and your own Personal Locator Beacon.   Does the boat have solar, or another way to charge the batteries, other than the engine?"
sailing,37rvpu,Techwood111,1 point,Fri May 29 22:46:35 2015 UTC,It does have a solar hookup. We have inflatable PFD's but still need PLB's.
sailing,37rvpu,whiteandpastry,3,Fri May 29 22:53:08 2015 UTC,"Some form of autopilot is key. Hand-steering for 3 weeks, with a crew of 3, would suck."
sailing,37rvpu,WorldSailorToo,1 point,Fri May 29 22:56:40 2015 UTC,"Having done it for nine days with a crew of three able-bodied men, I honestly don't know if we could have done three weeks.  We did have quite a bit of weather, but still...  A fourth on that sail would have made it a lot easier, at a minimum."
sailing,37rvpu,assi9001,2,Sat May 30 03:40:21 2015 UTC,"An ocean crossing can be done safely, but it takes a lot of preparation, knowledge, training, etc. So many things can go wrong, and you're completely on your own out there. If you lose steering, are de-masted in a storm, one of the through-hulls starts leaking, the engine dies (and your ability to de-salinate water with it), you collide with something, the boat catches on fire (particularly bad because you can quickly be forced into the sea if you don't get it out), you have to abandon ship, etc... then you need to have the knowledge, skills, equipment, and practice to deal with (troubleshoot, repair, etc) those issues. You also need to know and trust that the skipper is able to make good decisions in rough seas to prevent being knocked down by breaking waves, to rescue you if you fall overboard, etc. You also don't want to have to rely entirely on the skipper for your safety, because he might become injured or lost.  Start thinking about ""what if"" scenarios. You should be able to identify preventative measures and mitigation techniques for when anything you can imagine goes wrong. Also think about multiple things going wrong simultaneously. For example, what if someone leaves a faucet on in the forward head, draining your fresh water tanks, and then the engine dies so you can't de-salinate drinking water? Prevent it with regular (hourly?) inspections of faucets as part of the watch duties. Mitigate it by carrying extra potable water in separate containers that are only for emergency use.  I wouldn't commit to the voyage without gaining some sailing experience on your own and also with the people and the boat you'll be sailing with under controlled conditions. Take some sailing classes and start reading everything you can about cruising, focusing on safety at sea. Give yourself a year of this, and then you'll be in a better position to decide for yourself how risky any particular voyage is."
sailing,37rvpu,thunderkitty600,3,Fri May 29 22:52:03 2015 UTC,"This could be okay. Or not.   Some info you neglected to include:   Hawaii is the destination, where does the passage start?    You say the skipper has ""sailed to the Virgin Islands with family a few times"" but again don't include where these passages began - if from San Juan, Puerto Rico this is a so what, from Miami a bigger deal, from Providence, R.I. nonstop, a serious passage.  And will the skipper be gaining some experience with this boat before you get aboard?  The passage from the west coast of the U.S. to Honolulu is a pretty pleasant ride, presuming a departure in late June/early July.  This year is an el Nino year, so there will be more tropical weather than usual.  What heavy-weather gear/preparations does he have? Does he have weather-fax capabilities? Forecasting experience? HF radio? Life raft?  I met cruising couples in the Pacific who struck me as just plain lucky to be there alive.  But they did just fine learning as they went.  I met an 18 year-old kid who caught a ride in Panama with an oldish German skipper who had the bad grace of dying 10 days into a passage to the Marqueses.  The kid was a never-ever.  He made it to Nuku Hiva with some radio assistance.  So. Anything is possible.  They say that God looks after drunks and sailors.  So if you're not a drinker, you might want to take it up :-)"
sailing,37rvpu,WorldSailorToo,1 point,Fri May 29 23:00:18 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the response. The passage starts in San Diego. He sailed to the Virgin Islands from the East Coast (Northeast).  He will be spending almost two months on the boat, training with other sailors and taking it up and down the California coast.  He has a life raft. I am not sure about the rest of the heavy-weather gear or weather-fax capabilities. I don't think he has forecasting experience.  I am just having trouble understanding how technical this ride is. I obviously know there is a large amount of variables in the ocean that are out of your control but, I wasn't sure if this was something that can be learning in a couple months and sailed successfully."
sailing,37rvpu,AngMoKio,2,Sat May 30 00:15:54 2015 UTC,I don't see an EPRIB on the list...might be handy if shit goes sideways.
sailing,37rvpu,bjm00se,1 point,Sat May 30 02:48:11 2015 UTC,"if you hit a good weather window, and get a little lucky, its a relatively pleasant 3week+ ride out there. If you have a weather fax (like a furuno 408) you can get notice if there are storms and their predicted paths and adjust your trip to avoid them (maybe heave to for a day, or run the engine in no wind) to let them past you or get ahead of them. A mechanical auto-pilot and AIS would be a good idea as well..."
sailing,37rvpu,tkaraszewski,1 point,Sat May 30 01:31:59 2015 UTC,"Open ocean sailing is mainly boring given you make passage in settled weather - take lots of reading material. Still, not everyone will find the uncertainty of no 7-11 just down the street comforting. The big thrills during passage are fresh bread hot from the oven, a fresh-water rinse after your salt water shower (every 3rd day), the day you turn to your lay-line, successfully making your daily radio sched, and the day you see your destination rise above the horizon.  Count on several pieces of gear breaking, running out of something that you thought you had plenty of, being annoyed by things that would never have bothered you back in port. Life at sea is both a joy and a tedium.   I'm glad for all my open ocean miles but know that I still have a lot to learn.  But one thing I never had to learn is how to man a helm for weeks at a time.  My boat has both a wind vane and an autopilot.  Racers will hand-steer for weeks on end, but there are usually many more than 3 aboard and most are highly experienced sailors. Ask about self-steering. It's important.  There's lots of good advice in this thread.  Consider it carefully and decide what works for you."
sailing,37rvpu,rantifarian,1 point,Sat May 30 05:17:36 2015 UTC,"He will be spending almost two months on the boat, training with other sailors and taking it up and down the California coast.   Better.  That boat needs some serious shakedown time (and so does the skipper.)  The best case is if he sees some seriously crappy weather on his 'practice'.  He will probably succeed I think.  The problem is the 'probably'"
sailing,37rvpu,Techwood111,3,Sat May 30 08:08:58 2015 UTC,"There's already lots of good advice on this thread.  The sailor and crew is always more important than the vessel.  (Though a good sailor will quickly appraise a vessel and take a pass if it's not in good enough shape.)  There's a long tradition in sailing of fairly creepy old dudes who think they're gods gift to women trying to get young women to go sailing with them.  The best opportunities to go sailing come to those who live in sailing locations, San Francisco, San Diego, etc...  Once there, you can get on local crew lists, hang out at sailing clubs, get introduced to sailors, get introductions to competent sailors from other competent sailors, and so on.  Here's the thing: you can evaluate the skipper for the two week interval before you leave - but if you start losing confidence - he's going to put a great deal of pressure on you to make the trip.    ""Hey, you committed to make this trip.  You can't bail on me now.  I'll be short handed.  I've spent all this time training you.""  and so on.  So even if your better judgement tells you at the end of the shakedown period to bail - it won't be easy to do so.  It might not be a bad trip - it might be great.  But there's very little to go on to tell you one way or another.  And really bad trips tend to start like this, with too little information, too little experience, and old untested boats.  Do you feel lucky?"
sailing,37rvpu,rantifarian,1 point,Sat May 30 01:59:51 2015 UTC,Thank you very much for the response. It seems like I definitely need to re-assess all the information.
sailing,37rvpu,Mallemer,2,Sat May 30 15:13:57 2015 UTC,I like this story about sailing the double handed Pacific Cup on an Express 27.  What you think might happen might not be what actually happens. Better be prepared.
sailing,37rvpu,Techwood111,2,Fri May 29 23:51:21 2015 UTC,"I would not sign up to this trip without   A: Thoroughly inspecting the boat, and viewing the surveyors report from the last time it was hauled out or seeing the boat hauled in person  B: going on at least a three day shakedown sail with the other two.  Three weeks is a long time, both for serious weather systems to develop, and for serious crew interpersonal problems to develop. With only three and no Otto to help, it will be a fatiguing trip, and people get grumpy and make stupid decision when they are tired. If you are all barely competent on the boat to begin with, when shit hits the fan 2 weeks in there will be problems.  I would recommend at least 1 person, but preferably all three has done theUS Sailing Safety at Sea course, offshore with practical level. I have done the Australian version twice now, and they are a seriously good course. A number of cruising sailors from my club made significant changes to their boat setups after the course, and two even lost quite a bit of weight after realising they were too fat to climb in a liferaft. Quite a few studies have shown that in stressful situations people revert back to old habits, if you get the training and do some practice you will have the right skills to fall back on  If you can't do the course, spend a couple of days practising safety drills, including man overboard and retrieval using the sling (everyone must be able to drive the boat in a MOB situation), using lifejackets in the water, including taking them on and off, using storm sails, setting up the drogue, using the emergency steering."
sailing,37rvpu,senavonod,2,Sat May 30 00:36:04 2015 UTC,"I second the SAS course, especially the ISAF version.  I've been mocked on here before for preaching safety, so you're venturing into dangerous waters, rantifarian.  I guess a fair question to ask OP is, ""Is this a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and are you willing to risk it being the last-in-a-lifetime experience?""  While I completely, totally agree with training, preparedness, proper equipment, shake-downs, inspections, and the like, some people sometimes are willing to take bigger chances for the thrill.  Certainly lesser prepared crews have completed longer journeys; the odds of survival are definitely in their favor, but the chance of peril in the outlined situation is a whole lot higher than most, and one I'd personally decline."
sailing,37rvpu,hvyhitter,1 point,Sat May 30 03:48:50 2015 UTC,"A lot of what is in the safety at sea course is pretty common sense, and very experienced offshore racers and cruisers may well already practice most of the things taught. Indeed a lot of the content is taken from the experiences of offshore racers and cruisers, and quite a few sailing deaths. I think a lot of people seriously overestimate their personal experience levels though, and particularly their experience with serious situations on boats, so they ridicule the course thinking they will learn nothing of use. I have never had to use a liferaft or flare, and honestly doubt I ever will, but if the shit hits the fan I have done it before and so have a much higher chance of not setting the boat on fire with the flare, or braining myself on the inflation tank on the raft. If people want to mock me for that, so be it. One of my mates was on a boat that sunk during a race, one crewmember was lost and body never recovered. He has told me if they had a few onboard who had done something like the SSSC, his mate would probably still be alive."
sailing,37rvpu,Pluto61,2,Sat May 30 04:25:21 2015 UTC,The main thing I took away from my SSSC was to take just as much care to ensure everyone else on the boat is as capable and equipped as me. I'll happily not sail with anyone who will (genuineky) mock efforts to have a safe ship and crew. Particularly a skipper.  One of my SSSC instructors recounted the Coroner investigating the 98 S2H being astonished that the first time most of the sailors in that  race had seen a life raft was in 60kts and 10m seas. Really worthwhile course even for the most experienced.

It takes a lot more than two months of learning and experience for the skipper to make that trip safely. In two months he will barely get to know his own boat. Combine that with a very inexperienced and short handed crew and you guys are asking for serious trouble. What happens if you encounter serious weather offshore? Or there is an electrical problem and your GPS goes out? He should have at least one very experienced person on board with multiple offshore trips and the boat hauled out and surveyed by a professional before I would even consider. There are always people looking for crew - check out Latitude 38, crewseekers, even Reddit. This isn't an incredible opportunity and your gut feeling is right, don't do it."
sailing,37rvpu,rantifarian,2,Sat May 30 07:28:21 2015 UTC,"Well sounds like a bad idea.. Id echo the sentiments in this thread. There is a lot of well written and smart replies in here.

Something in there I saw and it might be a sailor tendency is adventure and looking at ""Danger"" and going.. ok well I gave it a pretty good look and it might be dangerous but I am going for it.   I share what other people said about the boat. If it was a Benetau 36+ or something new.. fine..   so what we say here MAY not dissuade you. So.. Ill give you some pointers if you arent going to listen to us. (Which an adventurous sailor may read all this and still go.. Thanks for the help.. but I WANT to do this.   so.. here are MY tips for things for you to research and figure out if you are going to do it regardless.    These two people. Id get to meet them REALLY well. Id have dinner with them together. Id do that more than 3 times so they get used to you and they start acting like themselves.. Are those two romantic ? Are these people STRANGE personalities.    if your spidey senses go off about that at all I would stop pursuing this trip. Any HINT of something bad, I would only say that once you get out on this boat that is only going to get worse. So.. figure them out.   Start looking at the boat.. is it homemade? Are the fittings on properly? Does it look sketchy? It sounds sketchy kinda.. But what do I know from 3000 miles away and some pictures.   Get to know the people.. THEN get to know the boat. You have time to do both.   It also concerns me that you dont have experience. You are relying a LOT on their skills (You kept saying what skills HE says he has) Dunno.

sailing,37rvpu,AngMoKio,2,Sat May 30 09:40:20 2015 UTC,"Groucho Marx said he wouldn't join any club that would have him for a member, a funny joke. But the truth in it is you should not crew with someone that would let an inexperienced beginner like you be 1/3 of an undermanned crew on an untried voyage with an untested boat.  Your life is too valuable and the risk too great, sign on with an experienced crew where you can be just a learner, or gain experience over time yourself by learning sailing near you. Don't put your life in the hands of someone who would put their life in your hands, when you aren't ready for it yet, and you know it. No specifics of boat or preparation offset the fundamental illogic of such a risk. Stay safe while you learn."

He was a test pilot back in the days when being a test pilot was a seriously lethal job and when asked ""how did you survive while so many others didn't"" his response went something like ""I prepared hard, those who had the gung ho attitude of 'kick the tiers, light the engine and the last one off the runway is a sissy' didn't last very long"".  I feel, from what you have described, this trip sounds like a 'gung ho, everything will he fine, don't worry about it, hoist the sails and let's crack on' kind of trip. Ocean crossings are dangerous, even simple injuries and issues that wouldn't be a big deal on land cab rapidly become a big deal. I feel the risk to benefit ratio isn't very good with this boat and crew. Your call.  Edit: can I just add that I don't want to piss on your bonfire.

sailing,37swv1,Q_without_a_U,3,Sat May 30 03:11:50 2015 UTC,"Not hard at all.  Tacking is weird, but that's about it."
sailing,37swv1,Guygan,2,Sat May 30 03:14:36 2015 UTC,Do it. I hardly knew what I was doing on a phantom (like a sun fish) when I sold that and for a H16. So worth it!
sailing,37swv1,tiberiusgv,1 point,Sat May 30 03:34:49 2015 UTC,I always liked the phantom a bit more than a sunfish.
sailing,37swv1,enuct,2,Sat May 30 03:37:26 2015 UTC,"they are loads of fun, getting used to the tramp and righting will be the only real change. I'd love to have another hobie 16 though."
sailing,37swv1,enuct,2,Sat May 30 03:38:21 2015 UTC,"It's fairly easy to make the switch. I'd say take the opportunity!  The main differences when sailing a (small) catamaran:   Tacking is more critical. The dual hulls resist heading changes more than a monohull. So if you don't tack correctly it's easier to end up in irons. In another respect tacking is easier ... there is a less pronounced heeling as the sails go from one side to the other. So there is less urgency in terms of side to side boat balancing. Sitting on the side is less painful on your arse. You are not sitting on some thin boat edge, as on most small monohulls. Righting can be more difficult. To illustrate the problem. Most of my cat experiences have been on a hired Dart 16 where the righting line was rather thin. On one particular occasion, at the end of a tiring sailing session, we capsized near rocks, with the current and wind threatening to take us onto the rocks if we didn't recover in a timely fashion. In these circumstances two problems became pronounced:   The combined weight of myself and my crew required a great deal of waiting on the line for the righting moment to take effect; and It was difficult for me, and impossible for my crew mate, to hold the wet thin line for the required amount of time.    The only solution available at the time was to tie a loop in the righting line so my crew member could hook in (we both were wearing trapeze harnesses).  As an owner of your hobie 16 you'll be at liberty to try a few other solutions. A thicker righting line, or a righting line with knots tied at intervals (???) perhaps.  I've not trialed the following solution but carrying a pair of prusik loops each (two for each crew member) has the potential to work well, whether used in conjunction with a harness or just something you can use to get a better grip on the righting line with your hands."
sailing,37swv1,johnbentley,1 point,Sat May 30 09:13:26 2015 UTC,"You forgot, don't bear away in a breeze."
sailing,37swv1,somegridplayer,1 point,Sat May 30 10:17:56 2015 UTC,"You mean, don't bear away in a moderate to fresh wind without depowering the sails first?"
sailing,37swv1,johnbentley,2,Sat May 30 10:36:12 2015 UTC,Depower ALOT first. Otherwise you're in for a big surprise.
sailing,37swv1,somegridplayer,1 point,Sat May 30 10:39:15 2015 UTC,"I'm not conscious of a special requirement for this over and above what you'd do in a dinghy.  I'm a low time sailor, so perhaps that accounts for some of my capsizes ;)"
sailing,37swv1,johnbentley,1 point,Sat May 30 11:24:56 2015 UTC,"Sort of.  The cat, being faster, generates more apparent wind.  In a monohull dinghy, when on the  wind, a reaction to a puff is to ease and head up.  Or even just head up to the point of pinching...  But in a cat, heading up can generate more apparent wind and increase heel and send you over.  Conversely, while on a hot, deep reach, you depower by easing and steering down.  Steering deeper decreases the apparent wind.  Heading up (Heating it up) increases apparent wind and powers up the rig.  TLDR - depower by easing the sheet(s)"
sailing,37swv1,bjm00se,1 point,Sat May 30 15:39:41 2015 UTC,Easing AND steering down does nothing. Pick one.
sailing,37swv1,themindlessone,2,Sun May 31 23:43:42 2015 UTC,"Dooooooo eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeet!   You will go into irons, you will pitchpole and righting the boat is harder. But its totally worth it."
sailing,37swv1,Pastelitomaracucho,1 point,Sat May 30 19:00:05 2015 UTC,The biggest adjustment will probably be figuring out how to sit on the tramp ;)
sailing,37swv1,Bump3rs,1 point,Sat May 30 03:14:59 2015 UTC,"It is much easier going from a mono dinghy to a cat than any other transition. Just expect a few swims, particularly during bearaways. Remember the fundamentals, like steering the boat with sails, and controlling the leech tension and sail shape with the mainsheet and you will be fine"
sailing,37swv1,rantifarian,1 point,Sat May 30 12:06:28 2015 UTC,"If you buy a used hobie 16, make sure the mast is airtight.  Eventually, you'll turtle the thing.  A turtled 16 can be righted by two folks of reasonable size - unless the mast leaked and filled with water.  Then four people aided by a powerboat can't do it."
sailing,37swv1,bjm00se,1 point,Sat May 30 15:43:39 2015 UTC,"I read my other posts, and I don't by any stretch mean to discourage you from doing it.  Sailing a cat is a lot of fun.  You'll learn some new skills, but I'm guessing you're up to it. :-)"
sailing,37swv1,bjm00se,0,Sat May 30 15:46:46 2015 UTC,righting is hard. Make sure whatever you buy has a buoy atop the mast to stop turtling. The only big difference in sailing will be a higher chance of pitch poling and a difficulty tacking. watch out for the pitch pole and practice tacking and you will be fine!
sailing,37o0u2,larsenf,2,Fri May 29 01:29:00 2015 UTC,Very nice. Do you have any other pictures? I bought a Santana 21 at an auction for $132 and put in almost a season of intermittent work to get her ready for sailing.

Our club has 3 of them and the freeze/thaw cycles from leaving them outside is what causes the cracking.  Hunter had a recall/replacement on a lot of them until they just washed their hands of that material and went back to good old fiberglass."

sailing,37p04s,Magnumi,2,Fri May 29 07:08:30 2015 UTC,Why is wind speed being measured in m/s and boat speed in knots?

sailing,37p04s,jeffrife,2,Fri May 29 15:06:09 2015 UTC,"We were going on a short 2-3 hour cruise. I did not see it necessary to stow the fenders for that.  I don't have fender holders currently, so I would need to untie them and stow them below decks.  I'm sailing at Pyhäselkä. It's in the lake dirstrict of Finland and has great possibilities: https://goo.gl/maps/O7rt1"
sailing,37p04s,SirTang,1 point,Sat May 30 19:56:58 2015 UTC,"Awesome looking place to sail. Trust me, if I'm out for 20 minutes, 3 hours, or the day I pop my fenders and place them in the cabin. But as I said, it's just a personal peeve of mine and I like busting people's chops over it. To me, and this is my opinion, it always looks sloppy or lazy to me when people leave them on. Its a ""motor boaters"" thing to do, leaving them on."

sailing,37p04s,jeffrife,1 point,Sat May 30 04:34:30 2015 UTC,"In a beer can race in my area a good number of boats leave their fenders on (and dock lines, and neglect to bring their outboards up).  We usually make fun of them, sometimes yell things at them if their fenders are dragging in the water... In retrospect, it's not half bad of an idea given the general chaos and cluster-fuck the race usually is."

Don't sweat the fenders that much, but do close the upper part of the companionway hatch. Good way to fall through to the cabin when you run forward to take care of something. Trust me, I uh, know a guy that did that one time. Ahem."
sailing,37qkid,7Pedazos,2,Fri May 29 16:36:34 2015 UTC,Keep saving your money and get the Sunfish. It sails like a real boat and actually has a resale value when you are ready to move up. If you take care of your Sunfish you will be able to sell it for as much as you paid for it so essentially it was free to use as a learning tool. That makes it an investment not a purchase. When you are ready for a bigger boat there will be plenty of buyers and you can keep the experience.
sailing,37qkid,FluffyBunnyHugs,2,Sat May 30 14:39:29 2015 UTC,"My dad got a Kool cigarettes Snark when he was a teenager. He was very experienced sailing sunfish boats at camp. He jumped in the snark and hauled ass downwind to the far side of the lake, where the boat stayed because he couldn't make it cover ground in any direction besides straight downwind. He left a note on it that said ""free"", then walked back to his car."
sailing,37qkid,robinson217,2,Sun May 31 02:15:48 2015 UTC,"Haha, that might be the most persuasive argument so far."
sailing,37qkid,Guygan,2,Sun May 31 02:24:30 2015 UTC,The Snark isn't a boat. It's a styrofoam beer cooler with a sail that just looks like a boat.

sailing,37qkid,enuct,1 point,Fri May 29 16:56:38 2015 UTC,So what does that mean for the experience of using it? How will it differ from a Minifish?
sailing,37qkid,enuct,2,Fri May 29 17:05:20 2015 UTC,"Snarks don't really sail, their daggerboards don't help much either. I had more fun trying to fill it up with water than sailing it. You're probably better off looking for an old AMF Puffer/O'Day Widgeon. I loved the Widgeon so much more than my puffer though. As a teenager I jumped around a whole lot of those dinghy's until I got my hands on a laser. That I still have.   I always had another person with me on the laser and it's been fine, the sunfish is a little more cramped but it still wasn't terrible. You may enjoy the snark, the only one I had fun on was the sea skimmer. I was using a Scorpion Sail on it, it did better with the lateen rig than it's sloop."
sailing,37qkid,enuct,1 point,Fri May 29 22:08:12 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply. Could you explain what you mean by ""they don't really sail?"" I've heard they do poorly in decent wind, and are so light it causes problems. But this one is 110 lbs-ish fully rigged. Will that overcome some of the common issues with snarks?   Also, the guy would have it rigged with a Sunfish daggerboard (and sail), if that makes a difference."
sailing,37q6by,jeffrife,2,Fri May 29 14:59:44 2015 UTC,Alerion Express 28.

sailing,37q6by,bjm00se,1 point,Fri May 29 19:19:20 2015 UTC,It would seem to meet your stated goals if you've got the coin and having a trailerable boat isn't part of the requirement.  Since you started out talking about your dad's V21 I tended to think you wanted a trailerable also.
sailing,37q6by,bjm00se,1 point,Sat May 30 02:37:56 2015 UTC,"Well, the trailer is nice,  but we moor our boats a don't travel with them, so not really necessary. It's nice when doing repairs or storing them in the boat yard (about 500 yards from the waterfront)"
sailing,37q6by,enuct,1 point,Sat May 30 02:46:39 2015 UTC,"you could do a whole lot worse.  alerion express 28 is a classic looking boat that's lightweight, well canvassed, has a modern design, and performs well.  It's designed for sailing, rather than partying and overnighting at the dock.  But there's a tiny bit of room down below."
sailing,37q6by,enuct,2,Sat May 30 03:18:25 2015 UTC,"I have a Cal 27 T/2 (this is the mk2) , they are a bit heavier and faster than a Catalina 27 but a little less luxurious inside there are several different Cal 27's but they all perform about the same. Are you looking to trailer the boat or keep it in a slip? An S2 7.9 is ""trailerable"", The older cherubini Hunter 25 and 27 are good boats too. I am a big fan of the hunters but some people aren't.  If you want something a lot more classic look into the Pearson Ariel/Triton or a Cape Dory."
sailing,37q6by,enuct,1 point,Fri May 29 21:49:50 2015 UTC,"The Cal 27 is very intriguing. I'm starting to look at a few configurations of this ship and she looks great. Fast, nice lines, roomy enough for one or two people to go ""boat camp"" for a few days."

It was a fun experience, that said I did really miss the headroom of a regular configuration. As for performance I race it every week and do very well.

If I was looking for something for racing in that size I'd probably go with a Catalina only because we have a huge fleet of them that race together here and there are parts readily available."

sailing,37q6by,reyomnwahs,2,Fri May 29 21:22:14 2015 UTC,"Haha. It could be 65', but I think it is in a 70' slip. I think it's a sloop. It's too ugly to look at long enough to remember details. But MacGregor 70s exist. Here is one that is a ketch. I like the claim on the page saying:   ""Most will agree that this is one of the best looking sailboats ever built.  It is a show stopper.  Under sail or power, or when you pull into an anchorage, the boat will be the center of attention.  Most boats, with their conventional styling, come and go virtually unnoticed... """

From the pictures I'm seeing it seems that their interiors aren't really that great. But hard to complain about the water line you get with a 65' boat. But, I think I will stick with my beamy once IOR factional sloop with open transom."

sailing,37q6by,bjm00se,1 point,Fri May 29 22:14:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, there does seem to be a lot of positive stuff about them.  And the ones sans pilot house are pretty nice looking. I'm impressed that people report single handing them with ease. I can't really imagine single handing my 40' boat... But that's Largely because I have running check and back stays."

sailing,37q6by,Guygan,1 point,Fri May 29 21:29:47 2015 UTC,My sea scout ship had a Ranger 26 at one point.  It was a good little boat. It was a fast little boat even with funky sails that didn't fit it right. Here is a review of it. We added a standard head with a holding tank and y-valve to ours... and discovered the balsa in the deck with pretty soggy. But the one we got was pretty neglected and donated to us for free.  Santa Cruz 27s are great boats.  Fast and super light! They don't have a head though. There is a nice little fleet of them in my area (which is not at all your area).

Should be on the bottom side of your price range... which I guess is nice. If I got one, I'd probably put clutches in on the cabin top and run all the halyards aft to the cockpit. Doing that I think it would be a good boat for single handing."

sailing,37q6by,reyomnwahs,1 point,Fri May 29 19:53:41 2015 UTC,"Dragon (keelboat):       The Dragon is a one-design keelboat designed by Norwegian Johan Anker in 1929. In 1948 the Dragon became an Olympic Class, a status it retained until the Munich Olympics in 1972. The Dragon's long keel and elegant metre-boat lines remain unchanged, but today Dragons are constructed using the latest technology to make the boat durable and easy to maintain. GRP construction was introduced in 1973 and the rigging has been regularly updated.  The Dragon Class is actively represented in over 26 countries on 5 continents. There were 1444 boats registered in 2004 and the number of boats built has averaged 45 per year. There are many more which are used for day sailing or cruising. The World Championships are held in every odd year and the European Championships are held annually. The Gold Cup, which can only be held in certain specified European countries, is unique in that all six races count without discard. It is held annually and often attracts over 100 entries, usually starting in one fleet.  A strong Class Association manages the class rules carefully to ensure safety, high quality and uniformity. Spars and sails have a wide range of adjustment during racing, allowing a skillful crew to optimize the boat for any conditions. Crew weight limits, and restrictions on hiking out allow the Dragon to be raced successfully by a range of ages and genders. It is possible to trail the Dragon behind many four-wheel drive vehicles. It is often dry-sailed. It may be raced against boats of other classes, employing a Portsmouth Yardstick handicap of 986  or a D-PN of 89.5.

Ordered another starter, disassembled and cleaned the carb more than once, and now it's finally running great. I've read that disconnecting the fuel line and running the engine until it quits whenever there's a possibility that it might sit for awhile can help keep fuel from sitting in the carb and gumming up, but I can't say from personal experience yet whether that works."

Do make sure you know your coastal nav though.  As I said, on a clear day you can see your destination the whole way, but on a not so clear day you can end up not seeing land in any direction half way over, on rare occasions you'll get a thick fog where it is just white in all directions...but in most cases it is a comfortable, easy crossing."

sailing,37nay3,GooglesYourShit,3,Thu May 28 22:03:46 2015 UTC,The west systems website has a few very good guides on using epoxy in particular. The Gougeon brothers on boat construction (about halfway down that list) is a great foundation for you
sailing,37nay3,rantifarian,2,Fri May 29 01:41:18 2015 UTC,This guy's channel has a lot of really good info on fiberglass work.
sailing,37nay3,POTUS,2,Fri May 29 00:34:26 2015 UTC,"The image doesn't show up. Not seeing how it attaches at the rim though, for a gap that wide, I'd probably use some plywood that's 3/8 or 1/2"" as the core material. In my opinion it makes everything easier to be able to build your shape ""dry"" first, then add the glass shell to it to keep water out and make it nice for painting. If you're worried about it flexing, you could add a rib to the underside out of wood or a metal strip screwed/glued in place. For the glassing part, I use west system epoxy, but you could also use the cheaper poly resin if that's more your speed. For west system, I'd use slow hardener in a 1:5 ratio (stir your mixture for 45 seconds and make sure it mixes very well). This gives you a working time of around 15-20 minutes in warm weather, which means do LOTS of prep before you start. Paint epoxy onto the wood in a clear coat and let it soak in. Apply another coat if necessary within a couple hours to make sure there's plenty at the surface, and fill any voids in the wood with thickened epoxy. Then lay down your glass (precut and measured with a little wiggle room to snip off later) onto your wetted down wood. Note that glass doesn't lay well doing inside 90 degree angles, so for ribs for instance you'd need to lay a fillet of thickened epoxy (peanut butter consistency) first to round out that angle. Now that your glass is laid down in the wet epoxy (or resin), pour/paint more resin on the top and work it into the fibers with a brush or flat plastic scraper until the glass goes clearish. If you have a wood substrate, a thin uniform weave of cloth is probably fine to add strength. If you go the mold route, you can use heavy weave or mat, but mat is hard to soak in. Make sure you lay wax paper anywhere you don't want to stick. Once the glass is laid and soaked, squeegie off the excess resin and let it cure for a couple hours. While it's still finishing its cure, apply a skim coat of epoxy/resin and a fairing material (talc baby powder works pretty well if you're cost conscious, or you can use the official west stuff). Spread this across the glass weave with a plastic/rubber putty scraper and get it as smooth as you can. Sand and paint to finish. Wear nitrile gloves and buy buckets, mixers, measurers, scrapers, and chip brushes. Resin is a similar process to epoxy, but you have to figure out the right ratio of resin to catalyst, which I always just eyeball a few drops, to varying results. If at any point you leave this process overnight, you'll want to sand with coarse grit the next day before you resume laying resin or glass. Clear as mud?"
sailing,37nay3,weezthejooce,1 point,Fri May 29 00:56:11 2015 UTC,"Not totally sure about how to answer all of your questions. But I would use some two-part marine grade epoxy resin that meets your temperature and drying time requirements. West System is a decent brand.   Balsa wood is pretty standard for cores in boats' decks. But for a hatch just using marine grade mahogany plywood may make the most sense for you. I think that would provide more strength. I wouldn't use a mold. Though potentially you should bag it.    As for fiberglass, I'm not totally sure. But I would probably use a plain weave fiberglass tape sold at a boat store for repair purposes. I don't think you would really need anymore than one layer, but you will need several coats of epoxy. (Maybe someone else has better input on this).  As for painting it, you will want to use marine uv resistant topside paint. I like Brightside (http://www.yachtpaint.com/usa/diy/products/finishes/brightside-polyurethane.aspx). If you use a glossy paint you will probably want to put strips of non-skid on it.  Or you could paint the top with non-skid paint with something like KiwiGrip.  Honestly what I would do (because I'm lazy) would buy a piece of carbon fiber honey comb sandwich panel and make a hatch out of it. Using carbon fiber tape or fiberglass tape and epoxy to attach the seems and thickened epoxy to fill in the edges of the honeycomb. And then painting it in the same way. Several hatches on my boat have been replaced with this stuff. At a 1/4"" thick it's super strong and weighs hardly anything.  Also it does not take screws well... want to bolt things through it. Not cheap though.  Also, I might head over to /r/composites if I were you. They would probably be the most helpful."

Mainly because of a heavier keel and less sail to make it more stable for easier touring. The interior is also very touring oriented. The custom line is what you would expect- custom. You can get a racing boat, a caravan or anything in between. They're also highly customizable post-purchase. I know of two people that put on gennaker beams later on. Decent sailing all-round.

sailing,37igv7,whiteandpastry,3,Thu May 28 20:51:44 2015 UTC,"http://spinnaker-sailing.com/online-courses/lesson-3  I'd like to add that even if you have right of way, the skipper of the other vessel might not know the rules as well. If you collide, in my opinion you messed up even if you had right of way."
sailing,37igv7,kriotas,6,Thu May 28 23:11:08 2015 UTC,Not just in your opinion.  Rule 17 says that you aren't allowed to stand-on until you collide.  The stand-on skipper must take action when it becomes apparent that the give-way vessel isn't taking sufficient action.
sailing,37igv7,starcitsura,3,Thu May 28 12:44:58 2015 UTC,"Generally the number one rule is avoid collisions, well in advance, and make your avoidance obvious and deliberate."
sailing,37igv7,kmo9e,3,Thu May 28 16:28:04 2015 UTC,"When under sail, yes with a few buts. Get the hell out of the way for an aircraft carrier would be one of those common sense moments."
sailing,37igv7,0bi,2,Thu May 28 14:43:25 2015 UTC,"In Dutch maritime law, 'professional' vessels have right of way over other vessels. Such as fishermen actively fishing, a chartered ship (if they are properly recognizable as such), a ferry etc.  This in addition tot what jeffrife just said."
sailing,37igv7,kriotas,2,Thu May 28 16:28:25 2015 UTC,"Sailboats (when sailing) have right of way a lot of the time, but not all of the time.  Anybody skippering any boat really has the responsibility to learn the collision regulations."
sailing,37igv7,SchoonerKat1,2,Thu May 28 12:15:44 2015 UTC,"Only under sail. And not in shipping lanes and such. Really the boat with less maneuverability has right away.  So large vessels with low maneuverability have right away. Also, if you're in a sailing dinghy you should probably stay out of the way, as you have more maneuverability. I'd be pretty annoyed with a sailing dinghy that was dinking around in the fairway thinking they had right of way as I was trying to motor out of the marina.  A very simplistic view is bigger boats have right of way, boats under sail have right of way over similar sized boats under power.   Interestingly, landing seaplanes have the least right of way.  Also, it would probably be a good idea to go read your state's laws regarding right of way and such (probably found on the website for parks and recreation)."
sailing,37igv7,MouthBreather,4,Thu May 28 16:18:01 2015 UTC,"We give right of way to large ships like that, typically. I can't remember the rule but large commercial craft that are less maneuverable than us have right of way."
sailing,37igv7,kriotas,2,Thu May 28 19:05:00 2015 UTC,"There is no rule that gives large commercial craft right of way.  You do need to give way to vessels using a Traffic Separation Scheme or who are constrained by their draft, though."
sailing,37igv7,MouthBreather,4,Thu May 28 11:03:20 2015 UTC,"""Maneuverability Is Key! Sailboats under sail generally have right of way over most recreational powerboats, because sailboats are assumed to have more restricted maneuverability than powerboats (for example, a sailboat cannot turn and sail straight into the wind to avoid a collision). But by the same principle, sailboats must give way to any boat with less maneuverability. This means that usually a sailboat must give way to a large ship. If you sail offshore or at night in fog, it's a good idea to have an inexpensive AIS system on your boat to help you avoid collisions.""  http://wow.uscgaux.info/Uploads_wowII/095-45-01/Rules_of_the_Road_for_Sailboats.pdf  Is this not the case?"
sailing,37igv7,kriotas,2,Thu May 28 16:20:32 2015 UTC,"That document you linked to has a few issues with it.  The biggest issue is that it implies that the skipper gets to use judgement on who is more or less maneuverable.  That's dangerous since different skippers may have different opinions.  Although this principle may have been used to create the colregs, the colregs are the law and must be followed.    Unless the large ship is in a traffic separation scheme (marked on your chart) or constrained by draft, it needs to give way to a sailboat.  Usually, a large ship is moving much faster than a sailboat and it is actually very easy for them to tweak their heading a bit whereas the slower sailboat might not be able to get out of the way even if they tried.  If you're the stand-on vessel and you're not standing-on, it makes the job of the give-way vessel much more difficult."
sailing,37igv7,MouthBreather,1 point,Thu May 28 16:36:49 2015 UTC,"Gotcha... I think I'll still give right away to the USS Midway, however."
sailing,37igv7,kriotas,1 point,Thu May 28 16:50:46 2015 UTC,"LOL.  Yeah, given that she's tied to a dock.  Military vessels don't have any special rights in the colregs, but local country regulations usually allow a ""safe zone"" around them to be enforced due to concerns about security.  You'll usually get visited by a guy in a fast boat if you don't get out of the way of a US warship underway.  I have had a Canadian military ship (training ship) give way to me while I was sailing.  I got to speak to the guys on the bridge later.  The captain had used it as a way to teach how sailboats move when going upwind (tacking)."
sailing,37igv7,MouthBreather,2,Thu May 28 16:52:27 2015 UTC,"Got curious and looked up COLREGS.    (b) A sailing vessel underway shall keep out of the way of:  (i) a vessel not under command; (ii) a vessel restricted in her ability to maneuver; (iii) a vessel engaged in fishing.  So what is ""a vessel restricted in her ability to maneuver"" defined as?- (i) A vessel engaged in laying, servicing, or picking up a navigational mark, submarine cable or pipeline; (ii) A vessel engaged in dredging, surveying or underwater operations; (iii) A vessel engaged in replenishment or transferring persons, provisions or cargo while underway; (iv) A vessel engaged in the launching or recovery of aircraft; (v) A vessel engaged in mine clearance operations; (vi) A vessel engaged in a towing operation such as severely restricts the towing vessel and her tow in their ability to deviate from their course.  A vessel engaged in transferring persons, like a ferry?   It seems like the COLREGS back up my original assertion.

This close inland, and frankly to me it looks like the midway was docked or anchored, commercial shipping has the right of way.  This is moot though, military ships have the right of way in all situations.  They are as beholden to avoid a collision as any other ship, meaning even if they have the right of way if it's demonstrated in admiralty court that they did not attempt to avoid a collision they are liable, but military ship always have the right of way.  If you're curious, when two sailing boats meet, the boat on the starboard tack has the right of way, if both are on the same tack, the boat to starboard has the right of way.    I really don't think the midway was moving though, the mast would have bent, the sailboat would have listed freeing the mast, the nets/banner would have ripped...  although I'm struggling to see how the sailboat could get his mast stuck if the midway was still."

It's only 50 miles or so on paper, but it's open ocean with waves and storms, through a very heavily trafficked shipping route, and against the powerful gulf current.  You should probably start by going sailing, and actually finding out if it's something you enjoy. Plenty of people have bought boats, refit for ocean cruising, left the harbor and then realized they'd made a horrible mistake and the life just wasn't for them.  Once you do that, take your lessons - keelboat classes to learn to sail, coastal cruising and navigation classes to prepare for longer journeys. Try to do the trip a few times on someone else's boat before you take your own.  And enjoy!"

Probably a good case of 'secondary drowning' in your future.   Maybe it's better than nothing at all, but as TBF suggests, jacklines are relatively cheap and will dramatically improve your maneuverability and safety."

This is a good read:  http://www.sailnet.com/forums/gear-maintenance-articles/31448-offshore-log-check-your-lifelines-save-your-life.html  Essentially, we're talking about a force of 800+ Newtons against a lifeline, because your mass is multiplied by your acceleration (F=ma). That's an 80 kg man accelerating @ 9.8 m/s2 but my physics memory is baaaad, so it could be less. But there's a reason why most rock climbing gear is rated at least 8 kN and usually 15 kN. That's 15,000 Newtons.  Regardless, most lifeline systems won't be able to take that amount of force: the stanchions will almost certainly fail and any clasps will break. If there is corrosion on the lifelines, they will break as well.  So maybe it's an exaggeration to say they are ""useless,"" but I certainly would never trust my life to them."

sailing,37gg4o,adaniel28,4,Wed May 27 13:17:00 2015 UTC,"If you have a university or college near you, check with them.  I know the university clubs I have been a part of have been significantly cheaper than other clubs in the same area.  It may also be possible to find a non-profit community sailing organization or chapter of a national scouting or recreation organization that could meet your needs.   Also, if you just want to get a handle on basic sailing on a protected lake, you could probably pick up a small board boat (Sunfish, Laser, Zuma, etc) for as much or less than you would pay for one season at the club you mention.  These boats are generally rugged, super fun, and are a good gateway to sailing in general. Maintenance is much cheaper too.  Since the boat is not stored in water, generally, you can get by with cheaper paints and don't have to worry about UV damage to the same extent.  You also avoid many of the other costs associated with a large boat, such as storage and mooring fees.  You do have to consider some realities of board boats, however, such as their lack of carrying capacity and the fact that you will get wet.  I definitely support your idea of trying out sailing on a lake first.  Lakes offer a sheltered, fun, dynamic, and warm training ground where you can really get your skills and instincts honed prior to taking on bigger water and a bigger boat.  Also, if you do get a boat such as a Laser or Sunfish (both of which are class boats) you may be able to find a local racing organization that could offer you a support network and more sailing resources in general.  No matter what you decide to do, I would caution you against trying to go it on your own, especially if your goal is to do blue water sailing at some point.  There is no substitute for learning from sailors with years of experience."

sailing,37gg4o,SchoonerKat1,2,Wed May 27 15:59:09 2015 UTC,"There is a lot of convenience in having a boat in the water as opposed to trailering it and having to step the mast every time you want to go out, etc. $200-300 a month is about what it costs to keep a 24-26 boat in the water (at least where I am). Getting out sailing at least once a week is a nice thought... but doesn't necessarily happen. So if you get out a couple times a month... $200 a month doesn't seem too bad to me. On the other hand you could probably find a 24-26' boat for a few thousand dollars (price depending on what you) that you can trailer and keep in your yard for free if you have the space... but there are a lot of little costs that add up quickly and a big time sink into maintenance.  The nice thing about the club boats for until you know what kind of boat you want to get yourself, their maintenance is not your problem. You can spend all of your boat dedicated time on sailing as opposed to spending a bunch (realistically most) of it on maintenance."
sailing,37gg4o,reyomnwahs,2,Wed May 27 16:49:17 2015 UTC,"If there are no other clubs nearby that are alternative options, I think that while the price isn't great this is still a good way to get started and get learning without outlaying (comparatively) a lot of cash.   You could pick up a small dinghy (if you can find one) and get started that way, but you'll miss out on the community and other people to learn from.   Whether trailering or putting in a slip, a larger boat (or equivalent of the 22 footers the club has) is gonna put you a lot further back than $2500, and probably more than $2500 a year in maintenance.   I would look at this as a convenience fee to allow your family to try out the sailing life without saddling yourself with your own boat just yet, and then reevaluate in a year. Worst case, you're still coming out ahead over buying a boat outright.   I do think their fees are wicked high, mind you. The large and very active club in my area is $80/year for an associate membership (use all facilities, use their rental boats for IIRC $60/day, crew races, but no storage of your own boat at the club) and ~$1200/year for full use of the facility including storage and use of the hoist."

sailing,37gg4o,WhatLine,1 point,Thu May 28 07:02:56 2015 UTC,"$600 for the classes is a fair price, $2500 a year to be a member of a club is crazy.  Most of the clubs I know charge around $500 to join and then they charge a per-use fee.  That way, if you sail a lot, you pay more, if you sail little, you pay less - much more fair.  22 foot sailboars are also not that impressive.  You need a mix of smaller and larger boats, so if you wanted to stay overnight with your family, you could actually fit in.  Might be your location doesn't justify a larger boat, but having variety is nice.  Large lake should also have a dinghy club.  If your kids are older than 5, they will love sailing dinghies.  Sign them up for classes and soon you'll be learning from them.  If you want to learn how to sail fast, you should also try out dinghy sailing.  You need to be in shape or at least relatively agile and not mind to get wet every now and then for dinghy sailing, but once you learn, they are a lot of fun and skills are directly transferable to keelboats.  Anyway, I would not pay $2500 to join some club unless I had a lot of time on my hands and could sail at least twice a week."

Possibly, but again, not when you are mixing it with water and cleaning your Laser with it. They aren't listed on the label, because they are not ingredients, and as such, are not found in the product under normal circumstances.

sailing,37dto0,Sketa066,4,Tue May 26 22:13:32 2015 UTC,I want to try a 49er.... without spending that kind of money :\
sailing,37dto0,syphen606,3,Wed May 27 02:16:59 2015 UTC,Compared to most yachts they are truly cheap to own. You can also try a 29er as a stepping stone. With their new powered-up configurations (29erXX) they are not far off.  This is /r/sailing where people own 40 footers and 50 footers. Now that's expensive.
sailing,37dto0,muyuu,2,Wed May 27 11:25:44 2015 UTC,"There are a lot of cheap second hand 14' skiff hanging around in peoples backyard. They are off the pace in OD racing, but will still be a blast to sail"
sailing,37dto0,rantifarian,3,Wed May 27 04:15:03 2015 UTC,I had a 1990(?) Cross III I14 for a couple years but it was certainly no 49er in performance.   I know a few people who are campaigning 49er's at a fairly high level and their campaign costs are high. I could afford a 49er but not the breakage and costs associated.

There is a cross 3 for sale on the USA website at the moment for $1300, and a few late 90's early 2000's Bieker 3s for sale on the Aus website for $5000ish. Neither will beat a 49er around the track, but they will be 90% of the speed and a good place to develop skiff skills and get a feel for if the investment of a 49er might be worth it"

sailing,37dto0,rantifarian,2,Thu May 28 00:11:19 2015 UTC,It's basically a tall dolly with big dock wheels on it. I just wheel it out deeper and it floats off.

sailing,37dto0,rantifarian,1 point,Thu May 28 02:56:59 2015 UTC,We probably should have built it so that it was pointing out to the lake instead of into shore. We always have to turn it a lot to get it pointed into the wind and then it's hard to get off because the back is higher than the front. It'll get modified when I take it out in the fall.
sailing,37dto0,smellslikedonkey,0,Thu May 28 13:44:03 2015 UTC,"You can get a used 49er for 5 grand if you really hunt the classifieds during the off season.  Still a lot of money for what's basically an overgrown dinghy, but hey.  If you really wanted, you could probably build your own for about 4-5k, but I don't know if the 49er class allows home builds or if it has to be from an officially licensed supplier."
sailing,37dto0,Thjoth,2,Wed May 27 03:50:44 2015 UTC,"49er is single manufacturer one design - no home build. I don't think you could home build one for that money anyway, once you build the hull, foils, buy a rig and sails, buy all the hardware and rigging, I reckon you would be approaching 10k."
sailing,37dto0,rantifarian,1 point,Wed May 27 04:13:35 2015 UTC,"I don't know what the rig would cost, but the hull can't possibly top $2000 in material cost by itself.  Even overestimating the materials, it's hard to get that high.  It's a rather simple hullform and no complex finishing beyond paint is needed (which is where the price skyrockets on larger boats) and at only 4.9 meters of length, you're talking 20 yards of carbon fiber at $20 a yard so around $450 by the time you ship it, and crosslinked PVC-60 foam is $80 per 48x96"" sheet and 10 of those ($800) would have you more than covered.  Then epoxy resin with the relevant hardener is around $130 a gallon and I'd guess that you'd need about 3 gallons for this whole thing so that's another $390, we'll call it $400 for the sake of simplicity.  So right there we're at $1650 in materials for the hull and I've probably overestimated the material by enough to build one and a half of them, including all of the small composite parts.  I don't know what the wings and tiller and other detachable parts are made out of so I can't really estimate those, but let's say it's about $500 for a really gross overestimation, so that's around $2150 in physical hull material.  The most difficult part of the whole hull would be getting it put under vacuum after you're done with your layup, so renting a good vacuum pump and buying breather/bleeder, seal, and release films would probably cost $400 on the hull.  So that would nudge the total hull investment up to $2550.  I have no idea what the rig and fittings would cost, but surely they aren't in excess of $7000.  I can't find a source for mylar sail material but every other type of mylar I've ever seen has been really cheap.    At least half the price of a new boat is eaten up in labor. It would  likely  take the home builder about 300 hours of hands-on time to crank out a hull like this, and even though it would be substantially less in a production setting, there are still a lot of man-hours going into creating these things.  Even if the factory only took 150 hours of hands-on worker time (which is probably an under-estimation), if you're paying your workers enough to feed their families and compensate them adequately for their expertise, you're looking at close to $4000 in labor overhead alone on every hull just for the guys on the floor putting the thing together, not even thinking about the engineers with 6 figure salaries.  Add $2200 for materials and call it another $4000 material-cost and $2000 labor cost for the rig and the company is over $12,000 invested in every vessel before they even try to sell it for a profit.  That's the great strength of the home builder, you can use yourself as slave labor to dodge that particular gigantic cost sink that the company has to put into the boat."
sailing,37dto0,Thjoth,1 point,Wed May 27 22:18:07 2015 UTC,"All the prices I have here are straight of the Canadian 49er website. In Aus it is even pricier.  If you are buying non-class sails from a decent sailmaker, you might get away with $3000 for all three. Class sails in Canada  Mainsail: $2025  Jib: $1075  Kite: $2200  High modulus carbon dinghy masts are fucking expensive, particularly ones as highly developed as the 49er ones. For a fully rigged mast $5250. The three tube sections alone are $4400 if bought individually.  $1200 for a centreboard, $800 for the rudder, $400 for the rudder box.  Think of the control line fitout, high tech sheets and halyards, lots of harken blocks and cleats. There is at least $1000 in that, and probably much more, I haven't fitted out a dinghy recently.  Carbon everything else, like tiller and extensions  A complete boat is $32,575. Getting it down to half price by building what you can at home would be impressive. If you want 49er performance, you cannot make the mast and sails at home. If you don't want 49er performance, build something at least marginally designed for home construction like a 14' skiff"

Plus because it has some give you can still use the helm, it's just got a bit more resistance.

It would take up a fair bit of space, but if motion was really bad I would think it would take a lot of the edge off. I'd think a slightly diagonal mount would be best, so that it compensated for both forward and lateral motion."
sailing,37e1j2,POTUS,2,Wed May 27 00:03:43 2015 UTC,"Just a bit of physics here, if you mount it diagonally, it doesn't neutralize both axes of motion. Actually it doesn't neutralize either in that case, it would only do whatever component is perpendicular to the axis of the hammock. So you will pretty much still feel every wave that isn't perfectly parallel to the hammock.  Mounting it along the length of the boat, like from mast to forestay, is the best choice because the boat's lateral motion is usually 5 times or so higher, so that is the preferable axis to neutralize."

I'm saying diagonal but mostly fore and aft, sort of NE/SW if you will. That said, you may be right, straight fore and aft may make the most sense.

I've always been told 5:1 for chain and 7:1 for mostly rope rode (but that is not always practical, also not sure how excessive that is). Also I'm a huge fan of snubbers...   But for the anchoring dispute thing.  From any kind of official or practical stand point there is no real ""right of way"" (at least in this part of the world, I'm also on the Sound). But, this kind of interaction appears to me to be an inevitable hazard of sharing our water ways with other boaters.   Always running into these kind of issues on my parents' boat.  It's a 11 ton boat with a (cutaway) full keel. When anchoring in about 30' water usually we drop all 100' of heavy chain, and then add some nylon rode after that to get the scope to 5:1 and then put the snubber on. The problem is we swing with the current while most other boats will swing with the wind. Also people will try to anchor pretty much exactly where we dropped our hook because they just don't understand how much chain/scope we have out. They never believe us though when we try to tell them. ""Yeah right"" is a pretty typical reaction.   The only thing you can really do is not get too hot about it and pull up your anchor and move if you feel like you need to to be safe.  edit: Just to be clear. I don't think you were in the wrong. And I think being anchored first gives you priority... but thinking that won't really do you any good."
sailing,37cmag,SchoonerKat1,3,Tue May 26 19:09:36 2015 UTC,"Normally I would use more scope but it was kind of tight, the weather was calm, and there wasn't much of a tidal swing so I went with it.  I've yet to drag with this anchor even at 3:1 (lunch stop) but we'll see...  Your story sounds familiar ;-)"
sailing,37cmag,kriotas,2,Tue May 26 19:27:40 2015 UTC,"3:1 is very common in the summer in the PNW.  The anchorages are sheltered, have good holding, are deep, and are very, very crowded.  The net effect is that it's safer and more polite to use 3:1 or at most 4:1.  Also, you can fully expect to have intersecting swing circles in a crowded anchorage.  This is only an issue when some are on nylon rode and some on chain, as in your case.  You were totally in the right and did nothing wrong.  He came in later and it's his responsibility to move.    A boat on all chain will just swivel around the point where the chain touches mud until the wind gets up a bit.  He probably could have just turned on his motor and stretched his chain out away from you a bit and been fine."
sailing,37cmag,SchoonerKat1,1 point,Wed May 27 17:07:50 2015 UTC,Good point about just stretching the chain in the other direction. That probably would have been fine.
sailing,37cmag,enuct,1 point,Wed May 27 17:55:20 2015 UTC,Yeah. Sometimes you just don't have the room to swing for more scope for sure. I guess people will be assholes right? Also not totally sure why you would be mad at someone for dragging if they actually were dragging??
sailing,37cmag,SchoonerKat1,3,Tue May 26 19:35:27 2015 UTC,"Most people have no clue, I use 7:1 as a general rule. I have a proper anchor and plenty of chain for a boat of my size (20 feet+ 150 ft rode). I often run into fleets of powerboats on just one hook. I try to stay as far away from them as you can, but that doesn't always work."
sailing,37cmag,SchoonerKat1,2,Tue May 26 19:50:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think 7:1 is probably more correct.  I feel like anchoring can turn into so much of a social game of avoiding other boaters.   On a longer cruise I almost think the best solution is to stay out of the marine parks on the weekends and be in town to avoid all the weekenders that don't know what they are doing. And return to the popular anchorages during the week when the only other people out are experienced cruisers who actually know how to anchor."
sailing,37cmag,ambww4,2,Tue May 26 20:08:39 2015 UTC,Agreed on the game of avoiding other boaters!

sailing,37cmag,kriotas,3,Tue May 26 18:27:22 2015 UTC,"I've been in a similar situation, also in the Salish. One thing that is super useful in a crowded anchorage is tying a fender to your anchor with a short length of line. The length of the line should equal the water depth at high-high tide, and is tied to the crown (many anchors have an eye here).   This has many features: 1. You (and others) know where your anchor is, and can see if it is actually dragging. 2. Boats coming in are less likely to set their hook next to yours. In fairness, nobody knows how much rode you have out - you could have have 7:1 scope, or 3:1, and in 30' of water that's a difference of 120'. 3. It makes it easier for whomever is at the helm to motor up to the anchor when weighing. 4. If the anchor gets stuck, pulling on the trip lines pulls the anchor out backwards, unhooking it."
sailing,37cmag,SchoonerKat1,2,Tue May 26 21:19:39 2015 UTC,"Please don't do this!  All this does is provide another hazard in the anchorage.  In a crowded anchorage you will have overlapping swing circles.  It's perfectly reasonable for my boat to end up floating over your anchor.    Now I might snag your float on my rudder or prop.  When I snag your line, I may not notice.  I could damage my transmission at the same time as I unset your anchor.  Now we're both in trouble.  There are also many stories of people coming into a crowded anchorage and then tying to the ""mooring"" that is actually somebody's anchor float.  Now both boats will end up on the beach unless you're on board to stop them.  anchor floats have their place in very foul ground, but they have many drawbacks."
sailing,37cmag,apathy-sofa,2,Wed May 27 17:12:03 2015 UTC,"I haven't had anybody pick up my trip line (thinking that it's a free mooring or something), probably in part because my buoy is red and clearly labeled ""Cassiopeia's Anchor"".   Trip lines don't prevent overlap, they just limit it to less than your circle's radius.   As to how much circles should overlap, that's the very problem that the OP experienced. These two boats had largely overlapping circles but different types of ground tackle, different ways of laying at anchor, and probably different scopes, and that was trouble.   If everyone swings approximately the same way then it's great to overlap - now we can fit a load of boats into the anchorage and everyone is happy. Otoh, if I'm in an anchorage overnight and expecting a big tidal change and/or wind to arrive, I might reasonably put out 7:1 of chain (less a 30' nylon snubber) and hoist a riding sail. Not to be a jerk, but because I'll need to sleep.   Now if a boat comes up and sets her lunch hook just upwind from mine at 4:1, there will be trouble as soon as there's a shift. But they didn't know it - they're just tucking in for a couple of hours and appear to be far from that old cruiser downwind, and I'm ashore so can't say anything. They had insufficient information to anchor safely. And in a way, that's my fault.   This is exacerbated as the anchorage fills up. A catamaran arrives and anchors, and their bottom shape and windage means they're dancing to their own music. Someone deploys a stern anchor. Boats arriving late try to squeeze in rather than find another anchorage. Now nobody is going to get a good night's sleep once the wind fills in and the big ebb starts. A trip line wouldn't solve all of the above, but it would sure help a lot.   Trip lines, like everything in sailing, have pros and cons. There's a big spectrum of acceptable behavior here, which is one of the things I love about sailing. I don't like coming in to a full anchorage either, but on the anchoring-safety-to-anchorage-density spectrum, I'm somewhere on the safety side."
sailing,37cmag,SchoonerKat1,1 point,Fri May 29 15:22:45 2015 UTC,"This is a very well reasoned response.  Thank you for taking the time.  I absolutely agree with you in principal that everybody's lives would be easier if we knew where each other's anchors are (we could also add a note for anchor type and setting power so we can tell which are likely to drag :-).  The problem is that adding twenty prop fouling hazards to a small anchorage with twenty boats in it is creating a whole new problem.  If there was a way to do it without creating a new hazard, I'd be all over it!"

If their vessel behaves atypically from having all chain, they should learn how to plan for that when they anchor.  That said, shouting rarely helps a situation. I know they started it, but if you can deescalate and resolve such things calmly it will work out better. Maybe if you'd said the right thing that guy would be your new best friend right now."

sailing,37cmag,kriotas,1 point,Tue May 26 19:15:50 2015 UTC,"If their vessel behaves atypically from having all chain,   You can use a shorter scope with a chain rode, which is desirable because you'll tend to swing less.   This is because an anchor's resistance is to sideways pull - chain's greater weight will set it deeper in the water, whereas nylon will tend to pull taut and thus upwards.  I'm struggling to articulate an eloquent explanation, but the section of Seidman's The Complete Sailor that covers this is as excellent as the rest of the book.  It's neither OP's fault that he had to use more scope, nor is it abnormal that a boat with a chain rode would swing less.  Chain is better but more expensive and a nuisance to stow."
sailing,37cmag,LearnByDoing,2,Tue May 26 20:09:05 2015 UTC,"The boats in the anchorage have the right of way of course, and your chain out ratio seems reasonable, but in these situations being technically right doesn't really matter, and there's nothing in the description that constitutes a smoking gun about one or the other being the inconsiderate party.  I'd say you were right but there's not enough information here to say for sure.  Some people are never happy so don't worry about it, but sailors are a small community so generally speaking you want to make every effort to not make enemies."
sailing,37cmag,boulderdrop,2,Tue May 26 18:27:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah I went out to their boat later on to apologize (just for the yelling...) because I'm not in the business of making enemies of people I will probably see again.

All chain rode is a thing for cruising boats, especially in our neck of the world. But choosing ground tackle that doesn't include nylon, imho, is bad seamanship as it's very hard  on the boat without having the benefit of nylons shock absorbing quality (snubbers are the alternative).  Generally is chain for the length of the boat, then the rest is 3 strand nylon. I use 5:1, on a j24, but more freeboard could easily require 7:1. 3:1 is a lunch hook and shouldn't be trusted at night imho."

But I don't use reefing nettles, I use shock cord to bundle the sail. You know those balanced lugs to really crank the downhaul down right? Also when reefed you want to let your halyard down so your sails' center of effort gets lower. In order to do that and keep your yard from flopping about you would tie a loop around the yard and the mast; or re-rout the halyard around a block and the mast. Piccup Pram is a great single person camp cruiser. Where are you located?"

Roger that on letting the halyard down when reefed.  I did the route halyard through the loop around the mast and yard.  I had to make wooden roller doughnut thingys around the halyard to get it to go up and down the mast smoothly.    It isn't obvious since I have one reef in but I believe I will need to make a taller mast since the boom is about deck level.  I'm in central texas and planning on doing the Texas 200 in a catalina 22 with this pram as the dinghy.

Slap them wherever you need light, save your house batteries. I have a ton of little LED lanterns too. I hang one from the mast when night sailing (in addition to running lights) so other boats can see I'm under sail, Ball bungees have a million uses. Sail ties, better than rope for a boom tent (they have some give so the tarp doesn't rip), tie your halyards off to keep them from clanging. My daughter used one as a hair tie the other day. Good 15 amp battery charger (not a trickle charger). I can charge my house and aux batteries in a few hours at the marina. Even if you have solar, genny, etc, it's handy and doesn't take up much space. $40-50 from an auto shop. As long as it supports deep cycle (edit: make sure it has a button for AGM/Sealed Lead Acid/Standard, and know what kind of batteries you have), you don't need a ""marine"" charger. Wind scoop. I got one for $40 on eBay. Hang in front of the forward hatch, directs a ton of air into the cabin, cheaper than A/C. Camp / backpacking stoves. I have a little butane one like Korean BBQ joints use and a tiny JetBoil clone. Takes almost no space, great for quick stuff like coffee or a can of soup, gives you a backup if the galley stove fails. Scented (but not stinky, stuff like ""linen"" and ""mountain breeze"") candles. Kills the bilge and head funk, or at least masks it, plus it's better light for hanging out in the cabin at night, and for the sexy times. Yo yo fishing reels and a small fishing kit. Hang one or two from the stern underway, at anchor, at the marina. Let dinner catch itself. Oh, and a Mora and some other good multipurpose knives. And a skillet. And cornmeal. And Tony Chachere's. Single serving snacks - the small Pringles containers, other chips, nuts, Clif bars, etc. Big bags spoil and get moldy in the damp as soon as you open. Singles keep a lot longer.  Should go without saying, but a shit ton of rope / line / etc. Keep some good yacht braid and dockline on hand, but buy a couple 50' rolls of the cheap diamond braid stuff from a big box store, too, it'll do for temp lashings and general use. Camp buckets - collapsible canvas buckets that pack down small. Ton of different uses. Wet Naps, Baby Wipes, or similar. Easy cleanup of dishes and silverware, countertops, bird shit, humans, etc. Trap-Stik. I hang one from the boom and one from the bowsprit when I'm docked. I kill a few hundred wasps, dirt-dobbers, and other bugs every few weeks. My marina started carrying them in the chandlery after they saw the carnage. Milk crates.

Getting the voltage and current rates correct for temperature battery type and charge level will ensure they last much longer than just whacking a single setting auto charger on.

Plenty of chargers at AutoZone and whatnot do that. Just don't want some poor schlep paying extra for the word ""marine"" on the box.   Just curious, what is the value of a shore power cable directly on the charger? I plug shore power into the boat's shore power inlet, then flip the breaker on, charger goes into a 110v outlet. Do you mean you have some kind of box that autoselects between shore power/solar/genny? That's cool if  you do, but I bet it cost more than my boat.

The PO got reeaaalll excited about his battery and charging setup, and appears to have bought the most expensive parts available (we have the receipts).

For those who are not aware, red light allows you to keep you night vision because you eyes are only accepting a small sliver of the visible spectrum which minimizes miosis pupal dilation.  Switching to the opposite end of the spectrum, blue, will have the same effect on the eyes.  The key difference here is that the blue light spectrum simulates daylight.  It will keep you awake.  If you have to be up for a night shift and need to stay awake, look for a blue lit headlamp."

Precooking wet type meals (stew, pasta with sauce etc) and vacuum sealing them in individual portion bags before freezing is easy provisioning. All you have to do is drop the while bag in boiling water until hot, then pour into a bowl.

The problem is that everything on the mast will be about an inch lower.   Can you live with a boom that is an inch lower? Probably, not sure how tight that boat is.   Do you have an inch of adjustment in your stays? Unlikely, you might need to cut them down and have them re-swaged.  Will you be able to get the jib tight enough after taking an inch off or will it be hitting the block at the top?  I don't know enough about that boat to tell you what will be a problem, but taking an inch off the mast is going to effect a lot of things so you need to carefully look at what will be effected. Then you can decide if you can just cut the bottom off or if another repair is better."

Cut it to length (absolutely square) and then raise the step (mahogany block) to regain the lost length or just make up new rigging that is the new correct length.  If one stay broke then all the others are suspect unless there's a very specific reason that one failed.  Depending on where you are rigging may have a lifespan of only ten years or so.  Absolutely do not weld it.  You will destroy the temper and GREATLY weaken it.  Source:  Am a rigger.

sailing,37c3n3,enuct,1 point,Tue May 26 16:56:40 2015 UTC,"My boat still has all the foam in it.  It's a huge pain in the ass if you want to actually have any storage at all.  My boat has big 4-foot long foam blocks under the cockpit, and smaller blocks under the front v-berth.  Keep in mind, the only time the foam does anything at all is when the entire boat is full of water.  The foam is supposed to provide ""positive flotation"" so that the boat doesn't drop to the bottom.  It might well be upside-down, and all your stuff is likely either lost to sea or waterlogged, and you would still need to be wearing a PFD to be safe.  But at least your boat is bobbing at/near the surface waiting to be towed to shore."
sailing,37c3n3,POTUS,1 point,Tue May 26 19:10:46 2015 UTC,"The flotation on the Macs was 100% marketing IMO, it was only there to make newbie sailors feel less nervous - the reality is next to no keelboats have positive flotation, and yet somehow they all manage to be fairly safe.   You're lake sailing and will almost always be in sight of the shoreline. Even if by some fluke you start taking on water it's gonna take time to go under.   One red flag is that unless the flotation was yanked out for another reason, it's almost always pulled out because it gets rotted, often due to to leaks or just general neglect.   The only other comment I'll make, just to be that guy, is that the Macs are not fantastic on fit and finish, nor build quality, and don't sail terribly well either. In the same general class of boat, f you can find yourself a San Juan 21, a Catalina 22, or an O'Day 23, you'll get a helluva lot more boat than the Mac 22.  I don't know the asking price, but I'd personally say in fair shape with trailer, something under $2K is about fair market, and I'd probably be looking to pay around $1500 or less. Closer to $3K will easily get one of the other boats I mentioned, and I see SJ21s for less than $2K all the time, and they sail great and are way overbuilt compared to the Mac.   I actually own a Mac 25 in addition to my Cat 25, so don't think I'm saying this just be a snob, I just want you to have a fair sense of what you're getting into."

I guess it kind of depends on how much stuff you want to be able to put in it.   Probably unwelcome thoughts. The fact that it's a MacGregor is enough that I wouldn't buy it or think about buying it.

Anything other than white will heat up and hasten the deterioration.  If it is already weak (probably) you might think about grinding down into the fiber and adding a few layers of glass+epoxy especially around the mast.

sailing,379btb,klikhalno,1 point,Wed May 27 02:55:46 2015 UTC,"If the boat is not set up correctly you end up with the jib halyard roughly parallel and very close to the furler.  When furling the halyard can get thrown over the foil and bind everything up.  If it's bad enough it'll bind so badly you'll torque the wire itself.    Because the wire is made of two layers that are counterlaid the outer strands can unlay lengthen and the inner strands can tighten and shorten bringing all of the load on the core and instantly weakening the wire by half.  Because of this, any damage seen near the top fitting basically condemns the forestay even if it's new.  I've had to replace a forestay with two hours if sailing time ob it because of this.  The good news is that it is completely preventable.  Install a halyard restrainer on the front of the mast.  They pull back on the halyard opening the angle between the halyard and the furler.  It's a do it yourself job if you are comfortable aloft and the part will run you 30$-75$ depending on brand.  Inspect for forestay damage while you are aloft.  MOST furlers are improperly installed.  That said, not every brand of furler requires one but most do.  I believe Harken, Hood, Schaefer, Furlex, and Selden all do."

sailing,379btb,texasrigger,2,Tue May 26 01:11:44 2015 UTC,not judgemental at all.  I've been sailing for about 6 years. I learn a little more every time I sail and I learn a lot more every time I break something!
sailing,379btb,Pastelitomaracucho,1 point,Tue May 26 01:12:33 2015 UTC,A stiff furler in itself wont cause damage to your forestay as it is floating around the stay.  You could tweak the bottom end I suppose but I've never personally seen it.  Damage like what is pictured can only be caused by a halyard wrap which really can only be prevented with a halyard restrainer or on some mastheads a sail pennant.  The halyard needs to be at least 10deg relative to the forestay.
sailing,379btb,texasrigger,2,Tue May 26 02:59:35 2015 UTC,"Rule number one: if its stuck, for the love of what is holy, do not brute force it! Do not use a winch or any other force multiplier where you shouldn't."
sailing,379btb,_Mister_Pickle_,1 point,Tue May 26 03:22:35 2015 UTC,"On an unrelated note, swap your wire halyards for line if your masthead will comfortably accommodate it.  Wire has a number of limitations and is just not needed anymore with the lines on the market.  Some old boats had very narrow sheaves and wont take line but most will.  Boat maybe 30-32 feet? (Just a guess, hard to guess wire scale from that picture)"
sailing,379btb,Firebar,1 point,Tue May 26 03:09:01 2015 UTC,I've seen this happen on a j 70. There could be a pin at the base of the headstand to prevent it from spinning with your furler. That could be the problem.
sailing,379btb,svzephyr1981,1 point,Tue May 26 06:12:03 2015 UTC,"There's an awful lot of abrasion damage to the big tube section, and the strands on the wire look like they've been cut through and then the remaining bit yielded. I'd check up there for the sharp bits and other damage."
sailing,379btb,kynde,0,Mon May 25 22:52:02 2015 UTC,"Something very similar happened to my boat.  The jib halyard wrapped around the forestay, and because I took a winch to the furler control line (not smart - it should always be moveable solely under human power; if it is on a winch, something is very wrong), I was able to cause the halyard to wrap enough to cut through the forestay.  There's an anti-wrap part that can be (and should be) installed on your forestay.  It keeps the jib halyard from being able to cut through by wrapping around.  Here's a link with a picture of what may have happened to you:  http://northwestrigging.com/marine-products/furlers/  Here's a link to an anti-wrap part:  http://www.westmarine.com/buy/harken--esp-halyard-deflector-unit-0--14133839"

sailing,3785bq,rossco-dash,3,Mon May 25 19:55:48 2015 UTC,It didn't take away from hitting 16 knots so we were ok.
sailing,3785bq,somegridplayer,6,Mon May 25 22:14:54 2015 UTC,16 knots in a J/29? So you trailered it?
sailing,3785bq,FlickrPaul,2,Tue May 26 11:51:11 2015 UTC,"Thinking same thing.  Fastest I have ever gone on a 29 was 11knots (on GPS) and that was on a surf in a 25knot gust, with 9 people packed in the stern.    I was trimming and remember asking the driver hows the helm and he replied ""what helm?"".  After the race and talking with other boats in the fleet, we basically concluded at that speed there is so much turbulence the rudder has little to no bite.  So I would have to see some type of proof to believe 16knots."
sailing,3785bq,SchoonerKat1,1 point,Tue May 26 21:47:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I don't believe a J/29 could hit 16 knots surfing down wind.... under any reasonable conditions. And certainly not going 16 knots in that photo close hauled... water line is not going to let that happen.   I would believe that the apparent wind speed in the photo was 16 knots."

sailing,37a65d,TheShaytoon,1 point,Tue May 26 19:49:25 2015 UTC,From what I've heard they are a cheaper class to buy into and have a substantial class size. I don't know how true this is other than a glance at listings. There is also the melges 20. In the end it's all a matter of personal opinion on which boat fits the potential owner best.
sailing,37a65d,enuct,1 point,Tue May 26 19:57:37 2015 UTC,"The J70 has only been on sale for 3 or so years, and while they do have a rather large number of boats, the cost of a used boat is VERY high compared to a M24. You can pick up a competitive M24 for less than $25K, while a used J70 is about $45K.    I've raced both, and can admit that the J70 is great for someone that wants to get started in a OD sportboat...But boat for boat, the M24 is more comfortable, bigger, and more powerful.  In light air, the 70 sits like a tired dog.  The J70's success is also due to their class and how the rules were developed...only 2 people allowed to hike, only allowing dacron sails, and such.  I give them credit.    The M24 class is trying to implement some of the same rules.  Changes are happening, and you can totally see a resurgence of the class."
sailing,37a65d,TheShaytoon,1 point,Tue May 26 20:16:19 2015 UTC,"I can say there are two m24's here, and two b25's. There is not enough for a OD class so they race in a PHRF Fleet against two laser 28's and a Hunter 335. There was a Corsair 24 in the same fleet for a shortwhile, they quite often do very well in the light air we have. Often under 5 knots."
sailing,37a65d,enuct,1 point,Wed May 27 00:11:17 2015 UTC,"Not saying the boat is a move up, but the fleet is taking off in North America and some of those people are coming from M24's."

sailing,37a65d,TheShaytoon,1 point,Tue May 26 21:29:32 2015 UTC,"The melges 24 is a significantly more expensive boat to campaign, with smaller fleets, and it requires a linebacker to trim kite."
sailing,37a65d,tkaraszewski,1 point,Wed May 27 04:24:04 2015 UTC,"I am not sure how significant the difference between the campaigning costs are... The M24 sails might be $800 more, but that's about it.   Both boats require a crew of 4, so travel and regatta fees will be the same.   We mostly race in inland lakes, so the winds are maybe not as wild as the coast, so we don't always use the linebacker to trim the kite. Not going to lie, our normal crew is made up of two linebackers."

sailing,3759qi,harrison_kion,1 point,Mon May 25 17:03:53 2015 UTC,"I've yet to sleep aboard my Venture 21 and I've had it for 10-15 years. I need to setup a weekend trip through the C&D Canal and back. They're solid boats and have a nice PHRF rating (mine is 252).  Your's is looking good! It takes a lot of elbow grease, but they clean up nicely"
sailing,3759qi,jeffrife,1 point,Wed May 27 16:52:24 2015 UTC,"Mine was basically a bare, filthy hull when I got her last year.  This was my second overnight.  The first one was rough because the keel pivot bolt was leaking enough for the bilge pump to come on every hour and wake me up.  This one was a little rough because the kick-up rudder has a little play which knocks against the housing with every wave.    I've done 100% of the work myself so far, including making that rudder from a block of HDPE, so now I'll make it fit snug so it can't rattle.  On the immediate list is a boom vang, I find that the main sail is touching the spreaders on anything past a beam reach.  And I think I'll do a single-line reefing system, since I pretty much only sail singlehanded right now.  And I really want to do a roller furler, but that's another level of money and I haven't decided if it's worth it yet.  Next month I'm hoping to sail across the Pamlico Sound to spend a couple days in Ocracoke."
sailing,3759qi,jeffrife,1 point,Wed May 27 17:46:16 2015 UTC,"I have the same problem with the keel bolt for the first day or so until she swells in the water. Sounds like you're right on track to getting her back into full commission. Do you just have a working jib for her or a genny as well? When I started I only had a 75, but mine really started to sing when I bought a 150. I'd take my Venture over an O'Day Mariner any day. I need to look around to see if anyone has a 25 because I'd love to see the difference between her and my 21.   including making that rudder from a block of HDPE   A great right of passage for these boats, haha. I had to fashion mine in the first year as well as it was split. I injected epoxy, but it was in too bad of shape overall.  By the way, your sheet is getting wet ;-)"
sailing,3759qi,jeffrife,1 point,Wed May 27 17:54:11 2015 UTC,"Yes, I realized when I got back to the boat after taking a bunch of pictures with the beach, sunset, etc. that the sheet was in the water.  I figured someone would say something here.  I've got the 75 jib which you can see lashed on deck there, and a 135 genoa.  I don't sail much with the genoa because it tends to need help going across the deck, it gets caught on the gooseneck bolt.  When I have any kind of second hand (with thumbs) on the boat I'll fly the genoa, otherwise I just use the jib when I'm alone.  Mine didn't come with the original rudder at all.  The previous owner had tried to make one himself.  He chose to use 2x4s and lead weight at the bottom to keep it from floating.  The damn thing weighs 100 pounds.  I never did try it out, the HDPE rudder was the first project."
sailing,3759qi,jeffrife,1 point,Wed May 27 18:32:07 2015 UTC,gets caught on the gooseneck bolt   Sad to see they didn't fix that problem. I had to put a tape cap over it and that still only works 75% of the time. It always catches when tacking around a mark in a race.

sailing,376cy3,reyomnwahs,3,Mon May 25 06:31:10 2015 UTC,"So great post.. but.. How does one learn? What ideas do you have for that. (like more detail)  I saw today that winds will be 16-24 kts. Ive got a brand new 30 foot S2 that I know NOT to take out because I am NEW to the cruiser world. I also know I cant dock leward of more than a 10 kt wind either. Im learning.   Here is the weather today   Memorial Day A chance of showers and thunderstorms, mainly after 3pm. Partly sunny, with a high near 80. Breezy, with a southwest wind 14 to 21 mph. Chance of precipitation is 30%. New rainfall amounts of less than a tenth of an inch, except higher amounts possible in thunderstorms.   LOL Nope..   Ive got HUNDREDS of hours on Lasers, Sunfish, and quite a few on 420s. Most of that time was a youth.. screwing around seeing how many different ways I could flip the boat.   Can I turtle it? (YES) now can I right the boat.. (yes) Cool. Did I lose anything? Nope.. no wait.. where is the bailer? (Ok Ill tie it down next time) ALL that experience... and.. 20 years later.   I can tell you this.. It doesnt translate well to a cruiser. AT ALL.   I guess it is good that I have started (about 15 % done) reading the Chapmans book cover to cover. The chapter on piloting a auxillary powered sailboat is coming in SUPER handy.   So many goddamn nuances.   like the boat I bought has Lazy Jacks.. Turns out fouling them when bringing up the main is a big problem. Funny thing is from trial and error I think I figured out how to handle that. (then watched videos and found out I was doing the right thing.)   Ive got millions of questions that I dont think I am going to be able to read in a book.   How do you stow the lazy jacks when underway?  Do you remove that sail bungie thing from the boom that holds the sail when you are going out to sail or do you wrap it up under the boom with the lazy jacks?   How do you properly flake a sail before bungieing it together and putting on the sail?   Should I be adding anything to diesel fuel when I get a fill up?  (Stuff grows in Diesel? Who would have guessed that)   Should I continue trying to single hand it? Or should I have my crew (Wife and 3 kids) there to learn too?   Shit.. maybe I WILL take the ASA 101 course. Im thinking 103 might be perfect. I know the names of the major things and got the concepts.. Who knows.   I was sitting there staring at my cruiser yesterday and thinking to myself. I wonder if I made the right choice? Then I slapped myself.   This big ass boat has got me stymeyed a little. The amount of days I can take it out is pretty low because the winds of early summer around her seem to be pretty kick ass.   I gotta buy a life vest too..   Should I get one of those auto inflatable ones or one of those day sailing ones that look like body armor? I am opting for the latter but I dont think that makes sense.   I DO know that I want a PFD that inflates and gets my head out of water IF I was to knock my head and get knocked out and dropped into the water. That I KNOW I want.   I dont know.. I dont think yelling at the new guys is going to be that helpful some of us WANT to do this and we dont really know where to get the help.   The guy you were staring at probably got caught with a partial weather report and got stuck in it. There has been days Ive looked at hourly weather reports and seen that I shouldnt have gone out and I didnt. He had 3 friends with him.. so at least he was trying to assemble some crew. (That is better than me. I am singlehanding it because I dont really know anyone available and I dont want to put my wife or kids life on the line.   Id say he learned something on that sailing day he probably learned a LOT and it sounds like he didnt break himself, his boat his crew or anything else.   That DOES sound successful. No?   And I am sitting her laughing like an idiot because I have a   ""Captain Awesome"" shirt however I have NOT worn it on the boat yet. (nor will I)   lol"
sailing,376cy3,hvyhitter,4,Mon May 25 10:56:23 2015 UTC,"Shit.. maybe I WILL take the ASA 101 course. Im thinking 103 might be perfect. I know the names of the major things and got the concepts.. Who knows.   Heh, so, despite this rant, I bought a C25 without knowing how to sail, and figured I'd just ""wing it"". My wife made me take ASA 101 before I had the boat ready for the water. I got ridiculously lucky and the other two people in the class dropped out, so I had a 3-day one-on-one class. If it weren't for that, and the fact that I met several helpful people at my marina who gave a ton of pointers and went with me on my first few sails, I would probably have made a lot more mistakes than I have (and I've made hundreds).   If you feel like you're past 101 (and it sounds like you are) you can sit just the exam and get the cert. If nothing else, the ASA certs are good to have if you want to charter a boat someday.   Should I get one of those auto inflatable ones or one of those day sailing ones that look like body armor?    I bought this one: http://www.amazon.com/Onyx-Co2-Automatic-Vest-Universal-Adult/dp/B0032ALK36/. It's a lot less than the Mustang and as far as I can tell the main thing it doesn't have is a built in harness / d-ring for a jackline, which isn't something I necessarily need at this point. Also recommend buying one for the spouse, if she's comfortable she'll enjoy going out more.    I dont know.. I dont think yelling at the new guys is going to be that helpful some of us WANT to do this and we dont really know where to get the help.   FWIW despite being tempted I didn't yell at them, I gave them as many tips as they were willing to listen to, encouraged them to wait for lighter winds, and wished them luck.   I think what bugged me is they seemed so convinced they had it all figured out, and that's just not how you learn. I've met people who have been sailing for 30 years who will describe themselves as newbies. I think that's the right attitude to have.  Oh, and nothing wrong with the pirate shirt, just have to be aware it doesn't magically impart sailing skills. =)"
sailing,376cy3,hvyhitter,2,Mon May 25 15:45:57 2015 UTC,"So im sitting here on the boat like I said.. winds are gusting 25 (a guess because I am too lazy to turn on my instruments in the cockpit.) or more in nice puffs. Some guys like 4 of them just went out on their boat ""Incommunicado"" I watched em with the binocs for about 20 minutes until they went out of site. Last I saw they had their genoa unfurled about 75% and the genoa was on the port side of the mast and close hauled. (They should have been on a run and the wind was off the port side stern too. So.. I guess we will see what they do. I heard their outboard motor go past me and leaped on deck to check it out.   heh..

The same principle applies with sailing.    30 foot S2  Breezy, with a southwest wind 14 to 21 mph   you mean 12-18kts right?  That's perfect! (except for all the power boat jackasses out on a long holiday weekend), And you're on one of these? that's just enough wind to get that big heavy boat heeled over, she's 5 tons.... TONS man, and 40% is 4' below the waterline, you're not going to get 10,000 laid over in the water in less than force 7+ winds.  Order the ASA 101 book, read it on the boat (maybe before you leave the slip, or before you get the the last channel marker, at least read chapter 1 by the time you have the main twisted around the lee shroud), take a buddy that sails in races and get out on a day that has a small craft wind advisory, that's when you'll get her over 20 degrees and gurgling through the water!"

I've sailed with my dad on his Hobie cat all my life and even though my dad does most of the work on his boat I learned a lot of the basics of sailing and have a good feel for it. I've had my boat about a month now, a Pearson 31, and have been probably too bold with it for my experience level but how else do you learn? I just got back from my first long sail that was roughly 200nm round trip, I ended up motoring most of it (sailed probably 30-40nm) because the winds were light and the Detroit river can have a decent current, but I made it. Used charts on my laptop and GPS on my cell phone to navigate and dock at an unfamiliar marina in the dark for the first time. I also got into my slip at night too which I've never done, it can get tricky when your draft is 6 feet and a little too far left or right will get you stuck at 1am. Besides that and almost getting ran over by a freighter in the middle of the night, I had a great trip. A little nerve racking at times, but a great trip."
sailing,376cy3,hvyhitter,3,Tue May 26 20:17:19 2015 UTC,"I just noticed you were the EXCELLENT person that told me about not taking my wife and kids out the first time.. Your story still resonates with me.   Well Ive sailed it 6 times now and I DID finally take them out Saturday.. just for a small one mile motoring trip where MAYBE I would put up the main for a little while. The weather WAS good. My middle child went down 15 year old girl who loves sailing and I gave her the rundown on making knots. How to tie a line on a cleat. How to attach a line to the cleats on the boat. She threw the line to the boy her age on the dock (despite being nervous as hell and he was ""Cute"" ) it was pretty cool. I got out about a mile out. put the boat in irons and took the main up.. sailed about 15 minutes and my son said ""Dad there is red fluid on the cabin floor by the nav station""   So.. had my wife steer a course with the motor after I dropped the sail and started the engine back on. I went down to assess. The fuel tank gauge sensor cut out in the tank rubber seal failed and when the boat was leaning to port the diesel was pissing out of the gasket.. Oh well aborted sailing mission..   Was a good day.. no one got sick except for my 7 year old who was bopping around in the cabin with her life jacket on.. Everyone else liked it. No major incidents and I already threw out the rubber gasket and permatex sealed the gas tank cutout. So about ready to give it another go next weekend maybe. Winds are nuts today.   Great post! I hope some good exchange of info comes out of your post.   I know you have been in my head the whole time I have had this boat. ""Learn your boat first then bring the family on it""   I guess I am progressing JUST like you.   it is 7am.. I think it is time to go down to the club and start meeting people. (sailors)"
sailing,376cy3,dirtyPirate,1 point,Mon May 25 11:09:05 2015 UTC,"Meh, anecdotes.... not everyone needs to be born onto a sailing dink then spend countless hours practicing, some folks are just naturals and without ever taking a class have made some fantastic voyages.   Some folks are just lucky idiots, I can usually spot them due to their heads covered with hair that's not grey.

Some people learn faster than others, but practice and experience is how we get good. See Gladwell's ""Outliers"" and the 10,000 hour rule.   I read a lot of voyaging books too. I think some people gloss over the hard parts, maybe because they have a higher tolerance for hardship, while others are brutally honest, like Webb Chiles and Serge Testa, but I personally have a hard time buying that anyone ever just hopped on a sailing yacht and fumbled their way through and got very far, even if that's what they claimed."

sailing,375xa3,somegridplayer,1 point,Tue May 26 14:19:34 2015 UTC,"Read up on how to use your PFD.  Learn all the basic boat parts and terms.  Be sure to ask what you need to bring on the trip.   So far as knots and stuff the main one is knowing how to tie down to a cleat, both on the boat and on the dock.  Sounds like great fun. Maybe a bit slower than the plane flight but quite a bit more adventure."
sailing,374o2u,lichlord,3,Sun May 24 21:08:24 2015 UTC,"Good question. Ill give you my limited experience on the subject.   I doubt you will be able to keep a 30nm pace a day for 10 weeks.   I have a friend that circumnavigated Lake Erie and that alone (7-8 ports) took him 5 weeks SOLID and he only had one engine problem that was fixed in the next port after one tow.   I dont know.. sounds VERY aggressive. So aggressive what is the point? Are you going to have any fun at that pace.   Im not saying you CANT do it. You probably can. I just think an average of 30nm day for 10 solid weeks is going to get old.   I just did a 50 miler from Catawba to Cleveland. It was 100% uneventful and.. really it wasnt even that fun truth be told. I was going to rename my boat ""Odyssey"" based on the journey but it was pretty boring."
sailing,374o2u,hvyhitter,2,Sun May 24 22:49:44 2015 UTC,That's pretty much the advice I was looking for. My overland trip averaged about 180 miles per day and I'm glad I didn't go faster.  I've only sailed on Lake Michigan and Lake Erie so I'll need to figure out how early you can reasonably expect to be on Superior. And it sounds like taking my time and leaving the boat along the Huran coast over the winter would be first plan.
sailing,374o2u,hvyhitter,2,Sun May 24 23:12:18 2015 UTC,"Glad that is somewhat helpful.  I think another factor that is relevant now that I forgot to mention is wind. I was out on the lake today and it was kinda gnarly too. You said you had limited exoerience like me. Today there were some parts where I saw some 4-6 foot waves on lake erie and I was on a race committee boat and I was like. ""Holy shit"" those are big waves. Then I started to say to myself. I wonder how my 30 footer would handle them. (Probably a TON better than my psyche the first few times) That was my guess. So I guess you have to factor that in as well. I listened to a buddy talk to me about how we went out of Cleveland torward Leamington and was tickled because he was making 3 kts. I was doing the math in my head.   30 nm is 10 hrs at 3kts..   Very interesting."
sailing,374o2u,woolamaloo,2,Sun May 24 23:22:39 2015 UTC,"I love the idea. It's not impossible – just nearly so. You couldn’t do it without skipping over lots of great stops just to cover miles. But that’s not so bad if that’s your goal. You’re allowed to do it for whatever reason YOU want to do it. But, you’re going to HAVE to like the long days. By looking at your South American trip, you can handle it.   The way I’d plan it would be to pick out the major stops. Use this site to figure distances: http://map.openseamap.org/ Then, look for bail out ports along the way. You can plan time for each leg using a rough average speed of 4 knots which should generally be a reasonable average number for your 30 footer. I often average 5+ knots when cruising but I plan with 4. If those day lengths make sense to you, then go ahead and keep planning.   When I’m cruising, I want to see the ports. I basically plan on a minimum of two nights in each port. If it took me more than 6 hours to get there, that second day is as much for recovery as it is to see the port.   I think it’s possible - that with luck - you can get to from Chicago to Quebec City in 10 weeks and still see some great ports. It’s about 1,300 miles minimum if you skip Lake Superior.   But Duluth? Seriously, that's a haul. If your goal is the St. Lawrence, Duluth adds another 800+ miles (400+ each way) to your 1,300 mile trip.  If I had to include Superior (and I think I would) I’d go up past Sault Sainte Marie and tuck my bow into some gunk hole in the eastern end of Lake Superior for a few days. I’d leave Duluth for its own trip.   Let’s do some math.   We’re going to make a lot of simplifications. We’re just starting to plan, after all. 1,300 straight line miles + the 200 mile round trip to get Lake Superior water under the hull. Let’s add another 200 (just because) = 1,700 miles. (All miles are nm.) Average boat speed is 4 knots. 1,700/4=425 hours. If you limit yourself to sailing during the day and entering and exiting ports when the sun is up, we’ll plan on 10 hour (40 mile) sailing days. You’ll have 43 days of sailing about 10 hours a day. That works out to 6 full weeks of 10 hour days. Since you have 10 weeks, you can stay in about half your ports for a recovery day and to look around.  That’s a pretty rough schedule.  Here’s another scenario. You do it almost all as “crossings.” Chicago to Mackinac nonstop. (75 hours at 4 knots) A few days in Mackinac to recover. Mackinac to Sarnia. A few days to recover. Etc… With this, you’d be travelling 96 miles per day when you’re moving and zero miles when you’re recovering. As long as you took fewer days to recover than you did to get there, this would be quicker. You MIGHT get it down to five weeks. Of course it’s MUCH more dangerous because you’d have to leave the helm to sleep.   What it would take is a combination of the two methods. But you’re probably still looking at 6 hard weeks minimum if you’re really pushing and not taking recovery days.   But of course, all of this is fiction. You’re not going to get 10 weeks of perfect weather. One week-long storm on Lake Erie will grind things to a halt. Cruising to a fixed schedule is the most dangerous way to do it.   I don’t want to dissuade you. This is about what you want to accomplish. This trip is about the freedom to do it, isn’t it? That’s why I’d want do it. But it would be a bastard of a trip – in 10 weeks. Would I want to do it in 20 weeks? Yes, please.   How about take 10 weeks to go as far as you can? Then, winter the boat where ever you made it to. Come back the next year, take 1 week to prep the boat and go another 9 weeks. I’ll bet you’d make it easily then. Or, if you want to return to Chicago, go as far as you can in five weeks and turn around.   Here's a great website from a Torontonian who did something similar one summer in a 22 footer. http://www.brucedesign.ca/cruising/GreatLakes/tgl_introduction.html He went to the Bahamas on a later trip. It's a great site. I've read through the whole thing several times. You should definitely start here.  If you’re still thinking about doing this – good for you. You’re probably insane – but I’d want to meet you if you came through Cleveland. Visit this site. http://www.solosailors.org/ They have a lot of information that would help you.  P.S. I’m the guy who told hvyhitter about leaving on a weeklong trip out of Cleveland and was happy to be doing 3 knots. I left a little before dawn in gusts of 25 and 4 foot waves on my nose. It was nothing to be worried about but at 3 knots, I was barely going to make it to a strange port before midnight. But in those conditions, it was the best I could hope for. You’re going to have a lot of days like that."

sailing,374o2u,rantifarian,2,Tue May 26 20:32:51 2015 UTC,"What is cruising speed for your cat 30? I'm guessing 4 or 5 knots? You will only want to sail 5 or 6 hours a day, otherwise it starts feeling like hard work, so say 20-30 miles for a sailing day. You will find places you want to stay for longer than overnight, and will provably end up sailing 2 out of three or 5 out of 7 days at best. Working it out, a total trip of between 900 and 1500 nautical miles is easily achievable without pushing yourself. If you have the skills and inclination, a 36 hour passage (6am one day to 6 pm the next) will get you 144 miles at 4 knots, so you can really extend your range with a few solid pushes  Open up Google earth and have a look at the rough distance for where you want to sail, and you will get a feel for if the trip length is even within the ballpark numbers."

You could spend two full weeks in the north channel, another one in Georgian bay, and there's the thousand Islands, put in Bay, Presque Isle, etc, etc.   Are you trying to enjoy the great Lakes or conquer them in 10 weeks? You could easily make it through in 10 weeks.    You would have to get another person for the transit through the welland canal (three able adults minimum). To make it in 10 weeks, you would likely need to do some overnights--so three or four people is a good idea.    Get some books on cruising the great Lakes. Have fun."
sailing,374o2u,markus_b,2,Mon May 25 01:48:09 2015 UTC,"Just to give you some data points from some of the cruises I've conducted.   A two week sportive holiday cruise in the Caribbean with relatively rapid 42ft Benetau boats: 400 miles. We sailed every day, but one and had a few hours a shore here and there. We do conduct one-week 'mile' cruises, with the emphasis on teaching and getting some mileage (the offshore permit requires documenting 1000 miles sailed). A in a 'good' week we would be able to go 250 miles. Everyone would be tired by the end of the week and ready for a vacation :-). A similar cruise in the English channel over two weeks was 450 miles.   Looking at your trip: Chicago-Duluth is around 800 miles (4 weeks). Duluth - Georgian Bay is 600 miles (3 weeks), Georgian Bay - Kingston, 800 miles (4 weeks ), Kingston - St-Lawrence Bay, 700 miles (3-4 weeks). You'll spend 15 weeks chasing miles and not having time to sight see.  As this is your first endeavor I'd go explore the northern part of lake Michigan, if you dash there in one go its already a couple of days (200 miles). In general I'd start easy, with some easy day-trip size hops along the coast north. After a some days you can decide for some long hops, sailing in the night can be absolutely marvelous. You'll need a minimal crew (4-5) as you'll need always somebody topsides on the lookout and your boat probably does not have an autopilot."
sailing,374o2u,shiny_hublot,1 point,Mon May 25 19:17:35 2015 UTC,I think maybe Chicago-Kingston and then at the end you can put your boat up somewhere in the St. Lawrence or Lake Ontario.  If you want to meander I wouldn't go faster than this.

Sailing in reference to current is described as upstream/downstream and wind is upwind/downwind.  But uphill/downhill is both. E.g. We live in San Diego and Catalina Island is a popular sail, but getting there is always referred to as an 'uphill' sail because you are not only going against the prevailing winds but also the California Current.

sailing,373jzb,bigtips,2,Mon May 25 05:03:40 2015 UTC,"Common sailing term meaning sailing against prevailing winds, current and/or tide.    It is possible to sail uphill though.  Tides are actually ocean wide 'mounds' of water where the water surface bulges upward and is pulled around the world by the sun/moon interaction.  In open water, as the tide wave (not tsunami) passes, you sail up one side of the hill and down the other.  You never notice though.  In the case of tidal currents (not so trivial), the tide wave passes by some restriction (bay mouth / pass / strait, etc) to the water.  The wave piles up outside the restriction and, because gravity, a current forms to equalize the higher water level outside and lower level inside.  When the tide wave has passed and the 'mound' in the ocean has gone away, the bay now has a higher surface elevation than the open water and a current forms in the opposite direction to re-equalize the levels.  Sailing against these currents is actually uphill, from a lower elevation a higher one.  Wind can also cause an elevation change by piling up water at the entrance to a restriction or a shore.  If you sail up a river, you are sailing uphill.  That said, while you can sail uphill, the current is the only thing that affects you.  The elevation change is totally insignificant."

sailing,37188j,jmartyg,2,Sun May 24 00:03:54 2015 UTC,"Yes and no. The boat wasn't taken care of for a long time and most of the fiberglass core was waterlogged. I put plates under most of the deck fittings but never wanted to mess with the mast step. When the mast fell it was actually because the whole mast step tube had delaminated from the deck and the bottom of the hull rather than the mast just puncturing through the side of it.  But hey, at least the boat was free."
sailing,37188j,jmartyg,5,Sun May 24 00:06:55 2015 UTC,"Hey. Here is a go forward plan. (far from the best) Grab a power tool to cut out an inch inside the seam for the original repair and take it all out. Have a good look where the step broke free from the bottom of the hull and see if there are any cracks. If it looks nice, then cut out the rest so it's flush with the deck. If not, dig into the bigger cracks then laminate a layer or two of glass in. Prop the boat vertical, stern down to let it drain for a week or month or however long you can. Don't be scared to cut some holes in the stern to help. If you can, put a heater or fan on the wound and dry it out. You can then either make your own replacement part using tin cans or bottles for a plug shape(check the diameters), or buy a replacement step(like the ones that's already there). If you plan on really driving the boat, use West System, or if you're not, a Bondo kit will suffice. If you want, feather the seams(recommended). Build up, sand down, build up, sand down. If you want to make it gelcoatish, mix in an interlux color with a brush on coat of epoxy."

Grind off the deck to match the plate (doesn't look like you'll have to open up the socket ... that's been done for you by the wind), drop the tube in the hole and bond the whole thing together.   Fugly as hell, but cheap and quick.  You'll be back on the water and it'll probably outlast the rest of the boat."

Stayless boats arent anything new (Catboats have been a thing for 200 years), and are personally what I see as the future now that carbon fiber masts at cruiser size arent that different in cost to traditional aluminum.

It's ""PepitO"", an O2 designed and built by Mick Boudreau.  It's a pram, similar to an opti but 20"" longer and with a shallow V bottom and faceted forward transom (think extremely blunt bow).  It's designed to carry a stock opti rig or its own full sized stayed marconi rig.  The sloop rig has most of the controls of a full sized boat.  The entire rig is collapsible and will stow in the boat.  The construction is of glass over foam but only weighs in at approx 70 lbs.  Even if you cut it up with a chainsaw it would float.  I think he's entertaining the idea of finding a builder to put them in production.  It's intended as a step up from an opti and big enough to carry an instructor and child or two kids."

When you first get it if you can its worth wearing it and your kit in a pool to feel what its like to wear.   The Life Jacket you have linked claims to perform to the EN396 Standard http://www.mullion-pfd.com/products/product-standards/en-396  With the Tethers I like the 3 (EDIT: Corrected) hook version for a number of reasons, but it MUST be used correctly! See the MAIB accident report on the Yacht Lion.   If you can spare the time, effort and money you may (this is a theory I have) be better off making a harness line from dyneema, with lengths tailored to you, the double action hooks at the line ends and a whichard or tylaska that can be released under load at the end you clip to yourself. This comes from the Lion, and a person I know, where being able to release their end of the harness would have been very useful.  Regarding Jackstays I think that Dyneema would be fine, but check it carefully for UV degradation and Chafe. The standard webbing lines come ready made for a variety of boat lengths."

For anyone wondering, the Lion accident report: https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/media/547c6f8940f0b60244000023/Lion.pdf    Terrible to read, but I can't figure out why you say the 2 hook is preferable? It seems they suggest the 3 hook is better as you eliminate the unsecured period when moving the hook. Did I miss something?    I agree a DIY solution is probably best, but with safety equipment I'm very hesitant to take on the job. Also I would need to source a sewing machine. Too bad none of these solutions offer a snap shackle.. Perhaps I could replace just the fitting"

When upright, to do this, the beam of the boat would block the wind from the sail (slipping the sails into the lee of the hull) and I would lean as far outboard on the hiking strap as possible. Essentially, leveraging the force of the wind against the sail area of the underside of the hull and the weight of the sails and rigging against my weight on the hiking strap. I wish I had a picture to prove this but I would have been too busy at the end of the hiking strap with the helm in one hand and pumping the mainsheet (stalling the sails in the lee of the hull) with the other.

So if you're ever able to contact him, and he needs an emergency way to self steer the ship, you can run your jib sheet through some blocks to the wheel or tiller, and then trim the jib such that it applies to correct tension to keep the ship on a course.  If the boat deviates the sail will tense or luft and the rudder should compensate and bring the boat back to course.  This isn't super precise, and you'll need to trim the rigging to move the force center away from the keel, IE make sure the rudder has a decent angle to it to keep it on course, so the rudder adjustments make a real difference.  If there's no jib, you can rig the forestay sail (genoa) the same way, though you'll likely have to take it in quite a bit as the pulling force on the sheets on a reach or broad run can be quite high."

sailing,36wm37,POTUS,8,Fri May 22 22:48:02 2015 UTC,"Forward - Wheel - Power.  So you're pulling out of the slip, you throw it in reverse (no throttle), back out cool as a cucumber on a hot summers day ready to sail your Catalina 30 like you're Team Alvi-fucking-medica... Meanwhile all the other boaters in the slips are sipping on their drinks and eyeing you.   They're judging you... is he/she attractive? Do they know what their doing? Secretly, inside their bored tortured souls they actually want you to forget ""F-W-P"", for they desperately need a distraction from the absurd impulse buying they just indulged in at West Marine.   Regardless, you back out perfectly, like you would back a car out of a parking spot. The bow pulpit clears your neighbor boat (by at least a body length) and you remember this stupid post and ""FWP"". You put it in Forward. You turn the Wheel. You give it Power. You motor away like a champion."

People usually get distracted by the landscape and conversations. it's usually the crew who gets distracted and forgets to trim the jib. But the skipper can also get distracted which can result in accidental gybes.
sailing,36wm37,IvorTheEngine,1 point,Fri May 22 20:15:01 2015 UTC,"There are common mistakes made at all levels.   I teach 8 year-olds and spend most of my time reminding them that if the sail flaps, they need to pull the tiller towards themselves (i.e. turn away from the wind a little). Until they get that simple rule, they spend half the session going nowhere.  Other common mistakes are facing the wrong way when tacking, trying to pull the mainsheet with one hand, leaving the daggerboard down when they sail into the beach, rigging the boom upside down (you have to redo everything and it's not obvious until the end), and worst of all, leaving to get changed at the end and expecting their parents to put their boat away."

PT isn't one of those areas.  2) The fact that you posted payment in beer as a possibility implies you probably aren't in the category of financial winner to start with. Rule number one in Boat Club is bring cash. Rule 2 is bring some more. In fact, boat is actually an acronym for the 1st rule of Boat Club: Break Out Another Thousand.  3) Certified asa? Get a USCG 6-pack at least before ever mentioning certs to anyone for any reason ever unless you just want to come off as a pencil neck who should stay the hell away from my boat.  Advice: Go to Pt Hudson and go on a boat tour. http://www.pugetsoundexpress.com/  If you want to sail, you have to be serious about it. That means being useful and bringing resources. You can exclude being useful or bringing resources, but only by compensating to the extreme with the other.   Being useful means more than showing up with your dick in your hand and some confused ideas. Savvy?"

He lives on less than my friends treading water in nyc at ceiling'd jobs, but he has to stress during hurricane season, he has to spend a lot of time working on his boat and becoming a renaissance man of repair, he spends his money more often on teak and solenoids than alcohol. But then he posts a video of dolphins riding his bow crest and his sacrifices and hard work are undermined with a few words from someone who is not particularly happy with their own lot."

You're conflating ""not poor"" with ""rich."" It partially reflects upon the sad state of the world, but it really says more about his alternative lifestyle. A guy with the same money would not be called the same if he spent it on a house or family (probably couldn't afford both without continuing to make that money.  The luck is not that he has money; it's that he had enough privilege to imagine an alternative to the life most people lead.

Everyone get up to the neck in depth just to have these things. They really do not own shit.   This guy had to easily amass 200K+ (and maybe much more) to afford what he is doing. I know very few people (only one by the way) that have been able to pull that off just by being a normal middle class citizen. Everyone ""owning"" assets are just paying off loans.   Back in the day made that decision: either buy a place or the boat. He went with the boat, leaving us to live on rented places for the next 16 years, but giving us a unique lifestyle that allowed to live the happiest moment of my life. I will always thank him for that.   Now I am getting close to the age where he bought his first boat. I have a Masters Degree, a proper job and I have 5000 Euros in my bank account.

I know very few people (only one by the way) that have been able to pull that off just by being a normal middle class citizen.   Then you should get to know more people. I have a friend who lives on his boat off his 10k/year US pension (27 feet). The friend with a 53 hasn't lived onshore in 15 years. He started living when he had a 23-ish feet (bought when he was around 15), and worked his way up from there doing charter work and brokerage all along.  Can't afford your own? That's completely reasonable. It has become a privilege of the wealthy OR passionate to own a boat AND rent/own a home. That's why my friends who own boats don't own or rent homes. You can buy a solid 27 for under 10k US - that's less than a year of rent."

sailing,36ru8k,hypnotoad23,3,Fri May 22 08:50:05 2015 UTC,"The sock stops the sail from filling before it is fully hoisted. The priblem with big boats is that the masts are huge and so it takes a long time to hoist spinnakers and if they fill before they get to the top it's even harder. You used to just tie rubber bands around the sail to keep it snuffed until it was hoisted then crank on the sheet to break the bands and deploy, but the latest rule book made banding illegal. So now bags like this are becoming more popular.  The way it works is that zip runs the full length of the bag and is broken at the bottom. You then hoist the sail inside the bag and tie the bottom of the bag to the deck. When you pull the sheet the bag unzips all the way to the top deploying the sail and droppung the bag to the decj to be collected. It's fansatsic at getting big sail deployed easily, but it's a pain in the ass to pack abd pretty much impossible to do while underway."

You could spend years learning everything about navigation, you can learn everything from using a GPS to using the stars and a sextant, but most of the time you are going to use a chart plotter. Also you can take a free course in charts from a number of organizations. The United States Power Squadron taught the one that I took when I was 15. It did not make me a world class navigator but I could do what I needed at the time and it laid the ground work for my higher up education on the subject.   There are limitless, unique weather situations.  Depending on how you spend you time (day sail vs cruse) you probably will have decent weather, (the way to learn is just to sail, storms make better sailors)   If you knew everything there was to know about engines, you would build your own, better engine, then sell it to us. But if you understand the basics you will be fine in most situations. Read your manual cover to cover and make sure you have every tool you might need when you need it.   100 years ago Currents and Tides were almost entirely local knowledge. Now we have the internet. Whenever you are sailing somewhere you are unfamiliar with, look online.  seamanship, get proficient and you can do most things, you will get better as you go along.   To answer your question you do not need to focus on any one of those things, you must learn the basics of all of them. After that you learn as you go, you will learn about your vessel and how she behaves in different circumstances.   over time you will learn something that you can not learn from a book, For example on a long trip where I am using water I have to rethink how I stow cargo because as we use water the bow gets lighter but the stern does not because the head tank is in the back.

In my mind everything is either a bowline, a half hitch, or a overhand knot. A bowline and its variations and a sheet bend are all essentially bowlines. Two half hitches and clove hitches are made of half hitches. Stopper knots and reef knots are overhand knots.  I tie bowlines, stopper knots, two half hitches (and clove hitches), and maybe a cleat hitch every time I go sailing.

You can read the specs here. One thing the specs fail to mention is how much freaking fun this boat is. And fast! It is my dad's boat. He spent the winter fixing her up: repainting, adding some floatation, patching up some of the fiberglass and re-building the boards. This was her maiden voyage.

sailing,36pdfw,nevereven,2,Thu May 21 06:29:55 2015 UTC,I've got an old Lippincott. How do you mount the outboard? Do you have a kick up rudder?
sailing,36pdfw,apathy-sofa,2,Thu May 21 10:47:41 2015 UTC,"The outboard is mounted in a cutaway on the aft deck with a bread pan fastened inside. If you do this, get the long shaft outboard. We opted for the short shaft, because the engine is primarily used on a tender for his bigger boat. It works ok on Tèa, but barely.  In chop it cavitates pretty bad.   The rudder does not kick up, so to get ashore you have to pop the tiller off, lift the rudder from the pintles and swing up the keel. At that point you can motor right up to the beach and then tilt up the motor itself for your landing."

Some other ships local to the area have large old boats though (even up into the 60-65' range, both sail and power) that a kid definitely could not fix. So, that probably depends upon the area.

(My own re-post) Want to sail for FREE? Here's how... You check your local sailing mag for race days in your area (Here in SF we have Latitude 38, brilliant rag...). Dress in layers and go down to your Marina/Yacht Club with a cardboard sign that reads, ""RAILMEAT FOR HIRE"" or ""WILL SAIL FOR FOOD""... seriously, I mean this... This is literally how I got into the sport and I've had a blast ever since... See, these guys that get the big boats NEED people to run them. It's a challenge racing a 40ftr. single handed! Even if you're a Noob we always need weight on the rail, makes the boat go faster! Be honest with your Skipper about how much experience you have in sailing and he'll put you in the right spot on board. My first few times out I was the Beer Man / Rail Meat... still had the time of my life. As a beginner you need to listen to all the more experienced sailors on board, don't be afraid to ask stupid questions, learn to tie a bowline and above all... DON'T FALL OFF THE BOAT! Also try to have a thick skin as some Skippers can be rather loud when giving orders. Don't take it personal, it is what it is... If you find yourself getting seasick do not be afraid or embarrassed to hurl, we've ALL done it and you usually feel tons better afterward. I cannot stress the importance of a PFD. That would probably be the most costly part of your gear for right now (a good one is around $120 - $150) but it is a MUST HAVE and you need to get in the habit of wearing it ALL THE TIME. Sea water is really cold and wet clothes are really heavy, not good for your health at all. I've got more tips but not enough time for now... Best of luck to you!!"

Skiff sailors seem to pick it up quicker however that may just be the speed and responsiveness. They are just an awkward boat to sail, with windward heel required upwind and the bouncing of the foils. Don't waste your money until you try one.   Also what do you consider enough funds... I've heard of people picking up a moth for $4k that needed another 2k before it could safely foil"
sailing,36pz1d,Sld109,3,Thu May 21 06:08:15 2015 UTC,"Hey there, I got my moth last summer, and it's been kicking my butt ever since.  I had a decent bit of experience sailing skiffs before i got the moth (my previous boat was an I-14) so I figured I would be up the learning curve a little bit.  Nope.  Nope nope nope.  It is not an easy boat to sail, and I still haven't gotten the hang of it yet.  From what I've learned about it, this is what you should do to get foiling:   Have a friend with a powerboat.  Just get them to tow you out to open water, and then reach back and forth until you get the hang of foiling.  Expect to crash a lot.  Don't expect to get it down the first weekend out. Find the local fleet.  Ask them to help you, and they probably will.  They were all in your shoes once upon a time too.  If there is no local fleet, use youtube. Practice as much as you can.  From what I've heard about it, once you get over the learning curve, it's like riding a bike.  There's just a huge learning curve. Be patient remember that you'll get there one day!   So far as mantienence goes, I haven't had too many problems.  I bought a home built moth second hand, so I was kind of afraid I'd have to do a lot of work on it.  I've really only had to replace a fitting or two, and that's it!  It's a small boat, so there's only so much that can break.

From him, learning to sail a moth can be frustrating at first but it is like learning how to any other sport that requires skills. If you can learn how to windsurf and how to kite, you can learn how to moth.   First protip: sheet in FAST as you become airborne. Apparent wind moves forward quickly and you build speed and you have to adjust accordingly.    I think nothing beats fast sailing. Of course you can sail fast in more forgiving platforms, but a moth should be amazing..."

sailing,36pidj,Guygan,1 point,Thu May 21 12:30:36 2015 UTC,"Soling:       A Soling is a class of open keelboat designed by Jan Linge of Norway in 1965. In 1968, it was chosen from among many other boats to be the men's triple-handed boat for the 1972 Olympics. The Soling remained an Olympic boat until its final Olympic appearance at the 2000 Olympics. Since 2008 the Soling is one of the Vintage Yachting Classes at the Vintage Yachting Games.  The Soling is a strong boat designed for any wind and sea conditions and is fun to sail. Fitness, sailing and team skills are basic requirements for good racing. The boats are made of fibreglass reinforced polyester and are one-design boats coming from an authorized single plug and mould, making competition as even as possible. Masts are made of aluminium alloy and the best known brand is Abbott, although Proctor, Børresen Bådebyggeri and other brands might be available in the market.  The lifetime of a Soling is long. Those produced in the early days still sail beautifully and some are still in competition (more than 30 years after being built). The average competition life of a Soling boat is considered 15 years making the Soling a perfect cost / benefit boat for racing purposes.

sailing,36pidj,planeray,1 point,Thu May 21 06:10:34 2015 UTC,"They seem a bit aggressive to me and perhaps hard for 8 or 9 year olds to drive (i.e. need more strength for rudder / lines), with an increase chance of capsizing / pitchpoling, and are more difficult to right. This is me coming from a position of sailing J boats, so I don't have any experience other than one brief ride, only perceptions from watching them from shore.  I would love it if the Hobie 16 was good for this purpose because the cost is reasonable and they look like ridiculous amounts of fun. I had the opportunity to try the Hobie Waves at a Club Med. They were fun, but the guys let me out on a 16 they had and that was way more engaging."
sailing,36pidj,POTUS,3,Thu May 21 13:52:39 2015 UTC,"If you're comparing it to a keel boat, sure, there's an increased chance of capsizing.  If you're comparing it to something that you can pull up onto a beach, a Hobie 16 is pretty stable.  If you're worried about pitchpoling, tie 2 milk jugs to the top of the mast and you couldn't keep it down if you tried.  Honestly the first thing I thought of was the Hobie.  You want to put 2 adults and 2 kids on it?  A dinghy is out.  You want to pull it up on a beach?  A keel boat is out.  Both of these are literally what the Hobie 16 is designed for."
sailing,36pidj,POTUS,1 point,Thu May 21 14:02:40 2015 UTC,"Thanks! What about the required strength / weight to sail the boat? Doable for kids? They certainly won't go out alone for a while (it's a big body of water to send kids out on without an adult) but I'd like them to be able to do most of the work.  Can you sail it with a reduced sail area (i.e. smaller main or no jib) to make it more forgiving for kids, or is it really not an issue?"
sailing,36pidj,Hellvis,2,Thu May 21 14:44:48 2015 UTC,"I never reefed the sails on mine, but certainly it can be done.  Less sail area = less chance of capsizing, less force to sheet it in, less speed, less pull on the rudder.  But if the wind is below say 6 or 8 knots, there's not too much trouble.  You'll be running circles around all the keel boats, but not pushing the limits of the boat.  I'm not sure a 9 year old can handle the boat solo or with another small child, but maybe with some experience he/she would know enough to know what he/she could get away with.  Certainly a grown man can solo the boat.  If you're worried about the kids having enough strength to keep the sheets in, don't.  They don't pull that hard, and when they do, the kids probably wouldn't want to be fully sheeted in anyway.  The better you can hold your sheets, the faster you go.  On most points of sail if they let the sheets go, the boat stops.  Same with the rudder, the 16 has a fair amount of weather helm in my experience, so if you let the rudder go the boat turns upwind and stops.  The only thing is that you're going to get wet.  Water comes up through the tramp onto your butt and off the hulls into your face.  If that's okay, then I don't think it's possible to not have fun on a Hobie 16."

sailing,36lpw4,Magnumi,5,Wed May 20 08:57:41 2015 UTC,Newb here... How do you raise the mast?
sailing,36lpw4,fromkentucky,5,Wed May 20 14:36:38 2015 UTC,Most marina's have a crane that you can hook up to at the spreaders to lift the mast and put it in place.
sailing,36lpw4,A-Hoy,1 point,Wed May 20 17:15:43 2015 UTC,Absolutely correct! This is the method I'm raising the mast with. Here is a picture from last year of the process being done. http://i.imgur.com/b0X7Rch.jpg
sailing,36lpw4,fromkentucky,2,Wed May 20 19:26:52 2015 UTC,"Actually I'm raising the mast propably tomorrow. There is a crane nearby that is used to hoist the mast up and then it's lowered to the ""shoe"" on the deck. After that the furlex is locked in place and the wires are setup so that the mast will stand straight.  During the winter the mast is lowered on top the boat as seen in the picture and then the boat is covered with multiple tarps. This helps protect the boat from snow and the elements. The mast forms a steep ""roof"" that the snow falls down easily. Image for clarification: http://i.imgur.com/rABJBhs.jpg"

sailing,36nmcm,-Anders,5,Wed May 20 18:37:44 2015 UTC,If I was choosing a new slip location I would choose based on the following assuming the your boat will fit and meets depth at any slip:   Close to parking - not fun to carry stuff to and from the car a long way. Location to the bathhouse and other amenities - self explanatory. Direction of the prevailing winds - If you sleep overnight on the boat it's nice to have the wind push the boat into the dock/bumpers instead of springing back and forth on your docking lines all night. I also think its easier to be blown towards the dock than the neighbors boat when docking. Floating dock - if tides or hurricanes are an issue I would never choose a fixed dock.   I wouldn't even consider the sailing/motoring distance to get out of the marina. Just my two cents!
sailing,36nmcm,A-Hoy,7,Wed May 20 19:02:45 2015 UTC,I would just add to this plenty of room to back out.  If you have a wall on one side running parallel to your slip and your boat doesn't back well you will hit everyone on your way out.
sailing,36nmcm,Sailingwife,3,Wed May 20 20:14:32 2015 UTC,"I like being out towards the end for a few reasons. For one creeping in all the way down the fairway while docking drives me nuts.  I really don't mind walking to the end of the dock, I actually really like looking at all of the boats.  It's quieter as you have less foot traffic past your slip. Also, I would avoid being close to the ramp, as they can be loud (depending)"

sailing,36nmcm,Alex--W,1 point,Wed May 20 20:42:30 2015 UTC,Quite a few marinas forbid sailing into or out of slips.  I would choose a slip facing into prevailing winds and with a right turn entry to facilitate use of prop walk in entry and exit. Also as close to shore and restrooms as possible. I walk and carry stuff to and from the boat a lot but I motor up and down the fairway a lot less and it is easier than walking

I don't love coming back in when it's been a long day / night and I'm ready to just get tied up and go to bed, but in reality it's only a few minutes longer than if I were tying up at the very first slip anyway."

I had to scrape and sand the entire bottom as it can hardly have been done anytime in the last 40 years of this boats life. It took a lot of work to get the boat ready for the water. With the help of our local sailing school we got the mast on and I think everything with regards to the standing rigging should be all good now. Hopefully we'll have a sail this coming weekend so we can see for our selves. :-) Bonus, a bit about sewing beanbag chairs for the boat.

It works like a champ. Need a small fan on the v-berth side to keep the air moving back there but it keeps my Catalina 25 plenty cool when it's in the 90s or hotter.   This year, I'm thinking about doing a built in mount. There's a couple people on the Catalina forums who have mounted a standard window A/C unit through the wall between the aft quarterberth and the aft locker, draining into the bilge. It's fine in the companionway, just a little bit of a hassle to climb over getting in and out.   Some people set window units up on the forward hatch, but I've been told by those that have that condensation dripping into the v-berth is a problem."
sailing,36jcye,willysmd,1 point,Wed May 20 18:07:51 2015 UTC,Thanks for your response. I am going to pick up a 5000 BTU window shaker and cut a hole in a piece of plywood that will fit in the companionway.

I made a simple screen for the forward hatch from a roll of window screen material and stick on velcro, and I take all the hatches out of the companionway and cover with a mosquito net. I also just bought one of those wind scoops for the hatch from this seller on eBay.   None of the above works if it's in the 90s, but for early spring and fall, it does the job pretty well, and has the advantage of also working at anchor."

sailing,36ic24,ajc1216,20,Tue May 19 16:33:06 2015 UTC,"One of the main causes AND side effects of shouting is the crew not sailing nearly as much as they should together.   How do you destroy your local phrf fleet or any fleet for that matter? Sail together. Constantly. Know the boat inside and out, practice tacks until your grinders are in tears. Gybes. Inside takedowns, outside takedowns, gybe takedowns, everything you'll ever do on a race course. You want every move to be muscle memory. You want your mast/mid bow/bow/pit to just look at each other and know what is coming. You want the back of the boat just mumbling to one another on what they think/see/feel. The guys on the rail should be telling the back of the bus about shifts/puffs/lulls, how long until its going to happen, and it should be calm notices, with thank yous after each.   Shouting happens because things are out of place, people don't know the boat layout completely, people in the way, people unsure of their job, things out of place. The only way to eliminate that is practice, get to know each other, know strengths and weaknesses.   The fastest boats are the quietest boats."

Every manoeuvre was another shout. “Get that bloody headsail up faster, you plonkers!   I think there's shouting and there's abuse, and the two are very different.  I shout when we're racing, because I'm a bowman 30 feet from a partially deaf skipper in windy conditions. When things go wrong, I sometimes need to convey safety critical information while I'm buried in a flapping spinnaker, and I need to know that the afterguard got the message. I think the urgency and energy are surprising to new people, and I see how it can be off putting.   The abusive tone the author is describing has no place in any interaction between anyone, especially teammates. You're not making the boat better, and you're hurting people's feelings.

I still remember going sailing with my family and playing with the (unloaded) single barrel 12-gauge shotgun that was meant to play the role of a flare gun. I'm not that old, only 31 right now,  but we used to bring that boat through Canadian and US customs all the time without really declaring it as a weapon since we didn't have any ammo. I think post 9/11 they're a bit more touchy about not declaring firearms. We eventually got rid of it because it got a bit rusty that we thought it may not be reliable as a safety device, black steel being not the best in a salt water environment."
sailing,36hjb1,enuct,1 point,Tue May 19 17:40:41 2015 UTC,Sounds like some good memories.  I can definitely attest that they are stricter these days.  I accidentally crossed the border and came back one time.  I was probably over the border for maybe 8 minutes.  They still pulled me over (which...they were super alert to even notice me crossing over...it wasn't at a normal border crossing) and could have put me in jail if they wanted to.  Your old shotgun sounds like my grandpa's.  It's made out of wire.

sailing,36hwuq,kapeman_,3,Tue May 19 14:45:54 2015 UTC,"As a Thistle sailor myself I can say that it will definitely work for day sailing with 4 adults.  I will say that if you plan on day sailing as the majority of your focus I think the Scot is more comfortable and relaxed experience, but if you want to eventually get into competitive racing the Thistle is the way to go.  The community is highly active and inviting and everyone I know would love to see another boat on the line.  Also the Thistle is an excellent boat for a smaller lake as the weight to sail ratio means that with relatively little to no breeze you are still moving and can get a plane going in as little as 12 knots. It is a really fun racing experience where 3 is the optimal crew but 2 can be just as competitive.  I have never been on a Highlander personally so I can't really speak to them, although I know they are of a similar yet larger design."
sailing,36hwuq,invaderluj,2,Wed May 20 08:54:34 2015 UTC,"Many clubs have old boats for beginners to hire, or buy very cheaply.   Even if they don't, don't get hung up on just buying one boat to do everything. You probably want something fairly old and cheap to learn on, so you don't mind a few knocks, and if you get serious about racing you want to spend quite a lot more to get something competitive.  At the back of the fleet, the boat doesn't really matter. It's more important that everyone enjoys their day out and wants to go again. If the whole family enjoys sailing, you'll go a lot more often than if it's just you and a reluctant crew."

sailing,36erxw,SchoonerKat1,5,Tue May 19 00:12:50 2015 UTC,"The new boat is starting to take shape. I got to the point where I have to choose the fabric for the bimini and dodger and I am torn between these two options. One is similar to the color of the hull (dark blue-gray) the other would be a grey. I don't known what would look better. Is the same color too boring?. Is the grey adding visual clutter to the boat?. Since this subreddit has been so supportive, I would appreciate the input of my fellow sailors. Thank you very much!"

sailing,36erxw,Captn_Aubrey,2,Tue May 19 12:32:51 2015 UTC,same colour looks good imo. i think it would depend on if you have cushions outside and what colour they have ( i would match the colour to them)  It might even turn that grey colour after enough sun exposure ;)
sailing,36erxw,aCSiain,1 point,Mon May 18 20:48:17 2015 UTC,"The color of the cushions is a blueish-grey. I think either fabric would combine.

sailing,36fyxy,vigilantecat,1 point,Tue May 19 02:51:03 2015 UTC,"This really shouldn't have been such a Herculean task, however it was really quite a bit of an undertaking.   The hard work of getting my girl a trailer birth is paying dividends.  I mean seriously, it saves me nearly 200 dollars a month to put her on dry storage on the trailer (as opposed to a dedicated slip, and of course later on I can store her in my back yard).  And the cool thing is when I want to go out I can call and let them know, and they will have the boat waiting on me when I get there, and when I get finished they will put her back!"
sailing,36fyxy,somegridplayer,1 point,Tue May 19 02:19:02 2015 UTC,So it lives on a trailer when not in use? I've heard of powerboats doing this. I guess no need to bottom paint then? Marine life that does attach itself to the bottom comes off way easier fresh out of the water than after it dries.
sailing,36fyxy,somegridplayer,2,Tue May 19 12:53:22 2015 UTC,"Yes exactly!  After they pluck it from the water, if you want you can spray it down with some fresh water to rinse off whatever you just picked up in the time you in.    Bottom paint definitely doesn't seem as important."
sailing,36fyxy,somegridplayer,1 point,Tue May 19 18:59:05 2015 UTC,Its a lot more common in places like Australia and France to dry sail boats. They have rack storage that includes lift fees. Far less common in the US.

sailing,36e3u1,reyomnwahs,2,Tue May 19 15:10:36 2015 UTC,"Props to you for being so open about messing up. We've all done it, some are lucky enough to have done it when they were young in 12 foot dinghies, most have done it when older in larger boats of varying degrees of expensiveness.   On the latest post, no really major tips about dealing with the wind blowing you around other than try to keep your nose into it if you can, wind on the beam is tough to fight, and of course as you learned make sure the outboard is locked all the way down and lowered as far as possible, otherwise it won't really push you forward.   I did the exact same thing in a big wind second time sailing with my family, and just about rammed a J/24 in the marina. I realized the outboard wasn't all the way down at the last second and just barely powered us out of it, but not before doing a 360 in a busy marina right in front of the breakwater.   On heeling around and having a hard time getting under way, if it was blowing 14-20 I would say you probably needed to be carrying a bit less sail area while you're still learning, perhaps tucking a reef in the main before you go out, especially when bringing the spouse along.   When you're first learning and single handing a fairly good sized boat, 6-10 knots of wind is about right for carrying full sail - yes, that's spinnaker or drifter weather for hardcores, but you're still learning. With perfect trim you'll on a run get to near hull speed, and mostly you'll be going along at 4 knots or so, plenty while you're still figuring things out.   It's been surprisingly blowy and gusty here in the midwest this month - I was out for my first long sail of the year in 18-25 kts and realized I didn't have any reefing lines rigged at all on my C25 tall rig. It was a bit dicey and I couldn't leave the tiller for a second, luckily I had my daredevil daughter with me who thought it was just great."
sailing,36e3u1,hvyhitter,2,Tue May 19 03:42:27 2015 UTC,"Thanks.  I figure everyone's made some pretty big mistakes, whether they admit to it or not.  Might as well put it to some use and share some lessons from it.  Plus it might be amusing to look back on my early mistakes once I'm an old salt lol.  You know, I actually wanted to reef sail, but I didn't see any reef points (not that I recognized).  I'm going to take a better picture of my sails and share them on here and see if someone can help me out.  I figure I can reef sail at the luff where it attaches, but I'm less sure about how to keep the leech side down.  Lol yeah the spinnaker is intimidating.  As you have suggested, I'm pretty happy just beating up and down the ohio with my main and genoa.  Lol sounds like a great time!  Have fun out there!  I know I will!

They may already have lines through them, or they may not and you'll just see the eyes.  This sail has 3 reefing points, yours probably has one (most factory sails only have one reef)."

sailing,36d71r,ThatsMrKoolAidToYou,1 point,Mon May 18 19:43:24 2015 UTC,"Well, like most non-dinghies the gooseneck is attached so you don't have to worry about the boom coming off like on a laser, and the mainsheet is used to pull the boom down when reaching/close hauled. The more you let out the mainsheet the more the boom can lift. Which is technically kinda how you should be adjusting your sails, but when the mainsheet is the only means of controlling leech tension it is you lose a lot of sail control and thus can't really maximize speed. My guess is op is on a pretty strict cruising boat."

sailing,36d71r,KDirty,2,Mon May 18 13:24:08 2015 UTC,"When on a downwind run like this, I like to remind myself which way I need to move the helm ahead of time.  That way if I see the mainsheet start to slack or the boom threatening to come across, I've already planned what direction I need to push the helm to stop the jibe.  With experience I'm sure it starts to come instinctively but I still look at it and make a mental note every time.    Accidental jibes seriously suck, but I don't think I'd rig a preventer unless on a long passage or in weird wind.  I'd probably rather zig-zag on a broad reach than run fully downwind for a long time anyway.    I'm still learning, though, so what do I know?  :-)  Have fun out there."
sailing,36d71r,KDirty,1 point,Wed May 20 20:13:29 2015 UTC,"It does look nice, but it tends to be aaawwwwwwful slow. I'd rather jibe back and forth, but it looks like maybe you were in an inlet where that might not have been possible.   Speaking of cutting back and forth, I know it's called ""beating to windward"" when you're tacking back and forth, are you beating to leeward when you're jibing? I guess I don't see why not but I don't think I've ever heard anyone say that before..."
sailing,36d71r,somegridplayer,1 point,Mon May 18 16:51:37 2015 UTC,"Is it?  I thought it was faster when sailing downwind/ push mode?  Still learning.  Either way, it was nice to at least know I was capable of doing it- and of staying on course enough to keep the sails full.  We weren't in an inlet or anything, but out on the Ohio River.  Plenty of room, but not like the sea or even larger lakes.  If I understand the question correctly: yes.  I'll sail with the wind on my port/aft quarter, then get close to the other bank and jibe so that the wind is coming from my starboard/aft quarter.  I was using the word the same as tacking, only downwind.  Is there something incorrect about this?  EDIT: ignore above paragraph beginning with ""if I understand""...I think I misunderstand the question.  If you're asking whether the term ""beating"" can be applies to downwind sailing, I'm afraid I don't know.  Maybe someone else can answer?"
sailing,36d71r,BrerChicken,4,Mon May 18 17:12:05 2015 UTC,"It's sort of a trade-off between speed and VMG. It's the slowest way to sail, because you can never move faster than the speed of your wind, because the sail is acting like a parachute and the wind is pushing it. When you're off the wind, the sail acts more like a wing and you can sail faster than the wind you're sailing on. The difference is that ""speed"" is not the same as VMG. Your boat may be moving faster if you're beating back and forth, but you may arrive at your location more quickly if you're sailing wing on wing because more of your velocity may be made good."
sailing,36d71r,BrerChicken,1 point,Mon May 18 17:45:40 2015 UTC,Makes sense.  That was one of the nice things about running that day: it was the first time I could actually just sail straight up the Ohio lol.  I wasn't heading to one bank or the other for once!

This is a similar technique:    http://www.skippertips.com/public/1246.cfm (Except he describes it as being done with crew)  I was taught pretty much exactly how he describes it.

sailing,36ahej,stazy,1 point,Thu Jun 11 13:54:55 2015 UTC,as an update. the camera is a DREAM for 150. It works great and does look as good as the GoPro Silver.   Two days ago I started training on how to reverse my boat into dock. I used the same spring line on the stern and midship cleat. My wife threw it and missed the first time out.   It did work however. I didnt have the camera mounted as it was supposed to rain and I left my camera bag in the car.   I also will be doing a how to steer in reverse video because that is working quite well and also needs to be shared.   Maybe I will do it tonight. Seas are going to be VERY calm and my bag is right next to me at work.
sailing,36ahej,gsasquatch,1 point,Thu Jun 11 13:59:41 2015 UTC,"I've read that one on skippertips as well as discussed it extensively on some other forums because no matter where I started the spring line my bow would still dive in to the dock.  So instead I attached the line to the midship cleat with a loop in the end and ran that back to a winch, which is actually pretty similar to this.  However, I like this idea better because I wouldn't have to tend the winch as well.  In any case, I await the video as well and I'm definitely going to try this."

Now that it's come up again, I have to ask.   Why is this necessary?  As opposed to just driving into the slip by proper control of forward, neutral, reverse, and the steering wheel.  I just line it up, give it a tiny surge in, then a quick reverse to stop, put it in neutral...and step off the side and hook up.   I'm a newer boat owner, so I know I'm not some beyond average driver.  What am I missing?"
sailing,36ahej,Thjoth,4,Mon May 18 02:49:40 2015 UTC,"OP may have a ""left-handed"" propeller meaning when OP goes astern the propeller turns clockwise, right-handed, causing the stern to swing to STBD due to opposite transverse thrust (paddle-wheel effect) away from the pier. Hence needing both springer and breast lines to come along side.  Personally, I just bounce off the dock box."

sailing,36ahej,T_Callahan,3,Tue May 19 03:55:26 2015 UTC,When I dock in a 7kt crosswind the bow moves to starboard.. a LOT so it makes docking hard since you cant control in reverse I have almost zero prop walk or not enough to make a dent in the windage for sure. . For me this way means I throw the rope and boom I am on the dock. locked.   for me.. mine are all about crosswind approaches the bow gets out of control (My boat has a ton of freeboard and moves a lot in the wind)   I now know why my previous owner had a docking system where you just drive the bow into this big padded V shaped thing.
sailing,36ahej,universrevinu,1 point,Mon May 18 13:43:07 2015 UTC,"All very well and good if you have a motor that you can easily and reliably reverse.  Mine does not have reverse or neutral it is making power if it was running.  I simply shut it off at the correct time.  Spinning it around to reverse it causes too much wiggle or stalls the motor.     Also, I've never had a wheel, and the tiller won't stay where you left it in the time it takes to get to the dock esp with my fat ass walking off the side.   With that setup my procedure has been to come in slow as possible kill the motor,  use the aft line to stop the boat, put a wrap on the end dock cleat and then go up and secure the bow line, already in hand in single handed docking.   If I undershot then I could use the bowline to pull the boat forward.    I used this on the old boat too where I did have reverse since the time to put it in neutral and blip to stop was often enough time to drift too far away from the dock in any sort of a cross wind.  Thirdly, this method works when coming in under sail or by sculling should the motor not be happy."

In small boats, the anchor may be thrown in the intended direction of progress and hauled in after it settles, thus pulling the boat in that direction, while larger ships can use a boat to carry the anchor ahead, drop it and then haul.

You'll probably spend at least the same amount every year in maintenance, and there might be a few very big costs (like really needing a new engine, sails and rigging)  That's pretty cheap for a lot of boat, which probably means that some people have looked at it and been put off by the potential costs, so he's reduced the price to make it attractive.

But in principle whatever kind of 29 ft. Cal it is should make it down the coast if properly outfitted.  But I don't think it would be a ""good"" boat for cruising down the west coast from a comfort/stability standpoint. I bet it is a Cal 29 (http://sailboatdata.com/viewrecord.asp?class_id=1065) looks right and the year matches (if the boat is a 73, Cal 29s were built from 71-74). Cal 29s have a bal./disp ratio of 41.88% (which is fine), but with the depth of the keel I would imagine the boat is not very stable... which isn't want you want for offshore cruising. Also I bit under canvassed in my opinion with a SA/disp. ratio of 16.93 (though not technically).   Another concern of mine is that it probably still has its original Atomic 4 gas engine... which I would avoid. I would aim for a boat with a fresh water cooled diesel engine (if the raw water cooled ones aren't all dead yet).  Personally, I would look for something with a bal./disp ratio of more like 45% and a deeper draft with a little more sail area (18-20 range). Also, I think if you really want to do long trips on the boat, a boat in the 35-40' range may be a lot more comfortable space wise. But then again I bought a boat similar to a Farr 40 (http://sailboatdata.com/viewrecord.asp?class_id=2946) to live on... so, my priorities may be all wrong. haha"

Not in it's current state, but Cal 29s are certainly capable of it. You will definitely need to do some repairs (at least some engine work, perhaps more) on the boat for it to be capable of a passage, but I'm personally not gonna dismiss it outright from a one paragraph ad and a fuzzy picture.   Deals are out there. People get in a bind, need to move, get ill, have life circumstances change, etc. And sometimes that means they dump good boats for a song. Sometimes people also have awful boats that they're trying to dump on another innocent victim. I've personally had both happen to me.

sailing,368l5a,travellerw,1 point,Mon May 18 00:17:16 2015 UTC,"Your answer is what i'm looking for. Any thoughts on how to be prepared for june 1st being the start of hurricane season? I'll be checking the radars up til then but I know next to nothing of this detail. Are there any books, websites, wiki pages you can recommend?"
sailing,368l5a,travellerw,1 point,Mon May 18 02:30:19 2015 UTC,"First off.. Hurricane season starts whenever the fuck mother nature says. Not June 1st. Some years its in May, others in June or July. You need to learn how to predict weather on your own. Sailflow, Predictwind, ect... Otherwise you will get your ass kicked (and possibly die).   Your skipper should know all this stuff and have the plan in place.. If not, you should bail.."
sailing,368l5a,travellerw,1 point,Mon May 18 06:03:29 2015 UTC,"Well, that's frightening. Thanks.   The plan has been to watch carefully and then hurry from puerto to the coast of florida. then stay along florida on the way up while continuing to watch the weather.   Predictwind seems pretty great."
sailing,368l5a,somegridplayer,1 point,Tue May 19 22:44:37 2015 UTC,"Maybe I was being a little dramatic, but I was trying to instill the seriousness of what you are doing. You guys have chosen a time of year that can be unpredicatable. Had you gone 25-30 days earlier, then its a cake walk.  Anyway.. Keep a carefull eye on the weather. Your plan to hug the Florida coast will leave you vulnerable to micro-bursts. Be very carefull of these as they can be very powerfull and are not predicatable. Be conservative and reef if anything looks unusual. Have backup ditch locations in case a storm comes up. Going up the coast will mean you have no ""sea room"", so you must have places to hide if shit turns south. You don't have an option to head out to sea as that will put you in the Gulf Stream.   My biggest piece of advice. DON'T BE IN A HURRY."

And a 38 is quite tiny. But I've read of others going smaller. The boat is an expensive little creature, even going bear bones as I am. Took 4 years of searching for a boat to get one I could buy. My reading of the time it takes to hurry around is about 2 years. Maybe 2 1/2. Cost to cruise monthly, 1500 to 2000 monthly. Much higher if you stop and do a lot of expensive sight seeing.

But, I am quite enamored with my 40' boat with its 13'4"" beam. Has lots of cabin space while still having a huge cockpit. Also, so much deck...

sailing,367seb,damandsire,1 point,Mon May 18 17:11:30 2015 UTC,"Sure, if you have time to wait for the right deal. I have a friend who purchased a Tayana 37 for 25k. A few weeks ago a valiant sold for 22k. If you are patient and know what you want you can always find the deal.   The breaker is going to be the maintenance to refit. New rigging on a 30ish size boat is a minimum of 5k if you do everything yourself. Sails 10-20k depending on where from. Need a reliable engine, rebuild 4-5k, new 10-12k. And that is just the bare essentials. Start adding in tanks, electronics, deck and sailing hardware, liferafts and other essentials and your 20k investment will be more like 50k.   Then you are back with the original argument, should you buy a boat for 20k that needs a lot of work or buy a boat ready to go for 60k.   Good luck."

sailing,366hxk,Techwood111,4,Sat May 16 17:15:13 2015 UTC,Its not a pump of any sort. Pumps have moving parts. Its an eductor.
sailing,366hxk,Adddicus,0,Sat May 16 18:58:41 2015 UTC,"No, it IS a pump; an eductor pump.  It pumps.  While it may not have any moving parts, it is a pump nonetheless.  Google, and ye shall find.  Too bad the parent comment got blasted as a result of this post.  Essentially every manufacturer and distributor calls them pumps."
sailing,366hxk,Techwood111,2,Sun May 17 00:49:14 2015 UTC,"And they would be wrong. A pump is, by definition, a device that moves fluids by mechanical action.

The charts are spot on for USA, Mexico and what I've seen of French Polynesia so far. The user interface is great and it can link to the rest of your systems with a multiplexor. Downside is that you have to pay for charts outside of USA.  Second to that, and I keep it on my iPad also, is SeaIQ. The ergonomics aren't as good, but this app takes any kind of charts. So you can load it with your homemade Google Earth .kap charts and they will work well.

sailing,364xek,Survove,20,Sat May 16 04:25:02 2015 UTC,"I learned this from an amazing sailing instructor who used to be a genuine super tanker captain.  1) Go to your bow cleat with your 60 foot line. (Better to do it with a cleat amidships, but not every boat has one.)  2) Tie both ends of your line to the cleat, make a bight out of the middle and bring it as far back as you can. It doesn't have to come all the way back to the cockpit, but should be a few steps away.  3) Come in slowly to your slip, under power.  4) When the first cleat on the dock is on your beam, leave the helm, go to the bight and drop/loop it around that dock cleat.  5) Put your helm over to the opposite side of your docking line (so your bow is pulling away from the line). Keep going forward.  Your docking line will keep you from crashing into the dock and your helm hard over will keep your stern against the dock. Now you can step off the boat, grab a bite to eat, take a poo, and your boat will still be where you left it. Eventually you'll want to tie the rest of your docking lines and cut your engine, but in the meantime, this is super handy and easy for a single-hander. It's also seaman-like as hell."

sailing,364xek,thirdbestfriend,4,Sat May 16 20:51:47 2015 UTC,"You just need enough dock line to go from your cleat to within a few steps of your cockpit x2 + enough to tie to the cleat. I'm usually in a 38' boat, so for me that's 60', but in a smaller boat, sure."
sailing,364xek,TrojanThunder,5,Sun May 17 00:08:55 2015 UTC,so with this advice I went out and got a 35 foot RED 1/2 inch line and hooked it up to the stern cleat AND the midship cleat..

Amazing boat to see sailing.  Though the article doesn't say it, and it's only rumors from some naval architects, when it was launched as Mirabella 5 it was too bow heavy.  They added another 10ish feet to the stern to try to counter-balance.  As they mention, the 10 feet is roughly where the plane stays today.

If you head up the Grenville channel, then you are unlikely to see much of any wind at all. If you take the ocean route, it is going to blow like snot. I have actually canoed that part of the trip before from Alcan Mills to Prince Rupert (we were actually coming from Prince George). It is going to be a grueling trip for the paddlers and rowers.

sailing,3650w2,pseud0nym,2,Mon May 18 03:03:55 2015 UTC,You don't have to go through the Greenville Channel but the first waypoint makes you go on the inside of Vancouver Island and go to Bella Bella.    Its not forcing you to go completely inland but you can't just go on the outside of Victoria Island and shoot straight across Queen Charlotte Sound
sailing,3650w2,PyroBebop,1 point,Mon May 18 03:33:45 2015 UTC,"oh! Then the other way around lol.  When you said Coastal I figured you were thinking heading up the outside of the channel. Through the channel itself it would be the rowers who would have the advantage.  I will say, there are almost no places to stop on that route.

Standing rigging every 7-10 years, running rigging every 2-3 years, give or take. Sail maintenance every 1-2 years depending on how much you sail. Topsides will need touched up every 3-4 years or so, brightwork once a year. All of the cost involved for these really depend on the size of the boat. If you're talking about a trailer sailor of around 25 feet or so, I'd ballpark maybe a grand a year or so to keep the boat in fairly good sailing shape."

If I have issues at sea I can more easily fix a two stroke.  The benefits that 4 stroke is the self oiling system and the longevity.  As far as the environmental concerns I'd say they are about the same, about negligible compared to the big polluters... but your point is still well taken and I agree with you.  Regarding you growing up with a columbia 26, did you have the outboard on the stern, or did you have it sitting in the cabin sole?  My cabin sole was fiberglassed up, but I think it would be way cooler to have it sitting in there.  Ever have any crazy things happen with the boat?

We kept the outboard on the stern and I guess the plan was to use that little compartment as an ice box but it was never very practical because it would fill up with rain water and dirt and it was always just easier to use a portable cooler.    The boat help up well until my father sold her (and that was for monetary reasons nothing to do with the boat).

sailing,361h0m,KuriTokyo,2,Fri May 15 22:58:04 2015 UTC,"You need to take all power draw into consideration. But for just looking at the fridge, average draw is about 5 amps off a 12 v battery gives 60 watts. It cycles about 40% of the time. So you need 576 watt hours of power capacity to run the fridge all the time. You need to put back in that capacity to not run the batteries down. A 60 watt panel with 10 hrs of light would do. Now, that's kinda simplifying it, and this is only for the fridge, but totally do able. Same principals apply with a new install or a retrofit."

Having said that, it does prove you know a lot of the basics. I don't think I would feel comfortable right now taking out a 20-something foot boat out by myself. I need more experience.  I think the best thing you can do, and I am trying this myself, is to get out on the water as much as you can and gain that experience so you will feel more comfortable handling just about any boat. The problem for me is that I don't have easy access to the water.  I am also debating whether or not to take a class for the ASA 103 this summer.  Best of luck!"

I am still a total NEWB, but I feel as though I can really connect the theory with the practicality now that I have a boat.  My plan is to go out with some guys who race, I was invited by two different groups yesterday at the boat yard.  Seems like a great way to learn from old pros, for free and have a lot of fun!  Then again my typical plan is to try to keep a healthy distance between myself and formal education.  Good luck bro, cheers."
sailing,35yxq1,IHateThisPartOfTexas,1 point,Thu May 14 20:06:19 2015 UTC,ASA 101 can be a great course.  It really depends on who is instructing.  The test really covers the basics you need to know.  I've seen some very good sailors built out of the program.  A guy I crew with only took 101 and has figured everything else out from there just by spending a lot of time on boats and learning from others.  The basic knowledge it teaches is a solid foundation.
sailing,35ywlm,Willard2566,8,Thu May 14 17:53:03 2015 UTC,Learn on the small boat. If you screw up and break something it is much cheaper to fix. You will really get the feel from a small boat and become an active part of the total.
sailing,35ywlm,FluffyBunnyHugs,6,Thu May 14 18:11:41 2015 UTC,"The bigger the boat, the more specialized the job.   On a sunfish, you do everything at once.  On a 30'+ racer there is a driver, tactician, main trimmer, jib trimmer, pit man, mast man, and foredecker.  On  boats with less people these jobs get combined, like driver+main trimmer, jib trimmer+pit man, foredecker+mast man.    On a bigger boat the jobs are more complicated because of the loads, like having two sets of spinnaker sheets or having someone grind and tail the jib sheet.   On a big boat though, the knowledge gets compartmentalized.    Every sailor worth his salt needs to have capsized a sailing dinghy a few times.  You can learn balance, roll tacking, sailing without the rudder, sailing backwards, and all sorts of neat tricks that are harder to do on a bigger boat.  The memory of these things can make you faster and smoother on the keel boat."
sailing,35ywlm,gsasquatch,2,Thu May 14 22:02:07 2015 UTC,I have capsized not a few times but many of times.  I must be a seasoned vet.
sailing,35ywlm,ArrogantB,7,Fri May 15 04:04:41 2015 UTC,Smaller the better. It's best to learn on a dinghy.
sailing,35ywlm,thats_no_spoon,3,Thu May 14 22:15:38 2015 UTC,"Generally I would say it is easier to learn with at least one other person on the boat with you. There are a lot of little things to worry about.  I'd also say that it is easier to transition from a dinghy to a keelboat rather than the other way around.  If you're choosing a boat to learn on, I'd recommend: 1) Larger blades (rudder and centerboard). Small blades are very unforgiving, and if there's any wind require you to use your weight and sails to steer the boat. Boats with small blades that I can think of right now are lasers and FJs. 2) Simple boats. It's much easier to be able to see exactly each line does. 3) Not a massive sail area for the size of the boat. While you can cruise in light wind, it's very easy to be overpowered. 4) A good size for whatver purpose you want. Yes it's good to learn on a small boat, but if you're looking to take other people sailing don't bring them on a laser or sunfish.  ... That's pretty much it. For youth the 420 is a great boat to learn on. It's very stable, has large blades, and doesn't have a massive sail area for the side of the boat. It's also used in many youth programs around the country and is very competitive, so it's easy to find both used 420s and parts.  For adults something like a Force 24 might be a good boat. We taught on those when I worked in Aus and it worked really well. Other than that a Daysailer is alright, but it's a very sluggish boat and hard to maneuver (or the ones I sailed on were just in awful shape)."
sailing,35ywlm,RoyYourBoyToy,5,Thu May 14 18:13:22 2015 UTC,"Depends what you mean by 'easy'  If you're on a big boat with lots of others who know what they're doing, you won't have to do much, and can learn at a nice easy pace. OTOH there are lots more things to learn (like how to operate the toilet, or engine checks), and you're quite insulated from the actual sailing. You won't get as much time on the helm, or do as many tacks per hour.  On a dinghy, you'll be on the helm pretty much the whole time (assuming you've got an experienced friend teaching you) and you'll instantly notice the affect of every change you make.  If you're young and physically confident, go for a small boat. If you're older, or just like to watch other people do things first, and then think about it before trying it yourself, a bigger boat might be more suitable."
sailing,35ywlm,IvorTheEngine,3,Thu May 14 20:18:29 2015 UTC,"I learned on a 25' in SF Bay. It was scary as hell. Try manually reefing under way in 20+ knot wind and waves. Not fun. Once you get your skills, transitioning to larger 32'+ was a breeze. All these navigation instruments, single point reef system, jib furlers, electric winches, bow thrusters! Practically living in the lap of luxury, and makes you appreciate the simplicity and knowledge of smaller boats that much more.   It pays to be able to do a lot of things manually so that you know how they work in the event electrical stuff starts failing."
sailing,35ywlm,Markol0,2,Thu May 14 19:30:38 2015 UTC,Thanks all! Great advice.
sailing,35ywlm,jtunjdevil,2,Thu May 14 21:00:26 2015 UTC,I would say learning on a dinghy is best. With small boats EVERYTHING you do affects the way the boat moves. With dinghy sailing you can really grasp the concept of sailing and how the boat actually moves.
sailing,35ywlm,_f0xjames,1 point,Sat May 16 03:49:05 2015 UTC,"most folks are saying small boats but i disagree. Getting a job on a tallship is where it's at, you start with the most basic jobs, (basically hoisting sails) and learn as you go. there are a bunch of other people to really take care of things, so the chance of something going wrong is very minute. as you spend more time on the job you'll learn more and more. it's important to get some time on a small boat too because the big ships can have so much going on that it's a little hard to wrap your head around, but it's really a great starting point. oh, and you get paid too which is great."
sailing,35z6jv,SunkJunk,3,Thu May 14 19:10:53 2015 UTC,"Good deal? Yes Good idea? Maybe/Maybe not  As long as there aren't any soft spots in the hull and you don't see any cracks or signs of integrity issues I think it's a good deal. If you don't know, the hulls are a sandwich composite of fiberglass/foam/fiberglass and sometimes the layers separate and can cause that section to be very weak. You can identify soft spots by knocking your hand against the hull all over and listen for a muffled dead sound compared to a solid knocking sound. It's been a while since I've looked at hobie prices but it feels like a good deal to me.   I bought a hobie 16 right out of college that was a fixer-upper for $500. It was a 70's hull and I repaired a few large soft spots in the hull myself. Couple different methods are described online but in the soft spots I drilled holes in the top layer of fiberglass being careful not to go through the second layer of fiberglass and used an expanding glue(Gorilla Glue) to fill the void and strengthen the area.  It was great and fun the first few times I took it out and it's amazing how fast you go compared to FJs and 420s if that's all you know. It became a hassle though because it was too much sail area for one 150lb guy unless it was really light air. My investment was only $500 but I think I would have rather saved that for car/house/maybe even saving for a moth instead.   Catamarans are great but they're not for everyone, it's certainly a different style of sailing and something that every sailor should try. I'd get some experience on someone else's boat to see what it's like before you go in headfirst and buy your own."

sailing,35z6jv,enuct,1 point,Fri May 15 18:02:25 2015 UTC,"I think that statement is flawed, I can have a 8 year old kid right a sunfish/laser on his/her own with very little difficulty. They may be lacking on the weight side but they can do it and understand it. A Multi-Hull is exponentially more difficult, especially if it turtles. I teach the sailing merit badge and we have lasers and hobie bravos and albeit the same principles it isn't the same level of effort."
sailing,35z6jv,somegridplayer,2,Fri May 15 22:42:17 2015 UTC,"And comparing an 8 year old to adult is horrifically flawed.

I was going to say that there's no good way to reef the main because of the halyard lock but it looks like people have added additional halyard locks and have made it work although that only seems possible with a composite mast tip. At least, that's what I'm reading from some forum. It looks like Hobie 16s built after 1986 will have one so you might be good on that."
sailing,35z6jv,K_S_ON,1 point,Fri May 15 12:21:07 2015 UTC,"No, use a halyard extension. And you can't do it with a comp tip, the slug will pop out of the comp tip if you try to reef it.

They are fast and fun. Easy to sail and easy to launch and land. If you want to get wet and go fast with little experience this is a great boat to do it on.  If you really want to go somewhere and even spend the night a 22-25ft trailer sailor will run the same price and be a lot more versatile.

sailing,35z6jv,K_S_ON,2,Fri May 15 04:03:43 2015 UTC,"For that price, it should be turnkey.  All gelcoat shiney, no soft spots, no cracks at the trampoline mounts, all blocks working smoothly, all lines in good condition, sails should be crispy and not bedsheet soft.  Make sure the mast is airtight.  if it isn't, when you eventually turtle it, you'll never right it.  However, you can really only do that by submerging it and seeing if it leaks out air.  Hobie 16 is best sailed with two.  If you're gonna be sailing on your own, it's not the best choice.  Unlike when sailing a mono, if you start to capsize, don't turn up into the wind.  That'll create more apparent wind and increase your problems.  Instead, ease sails and turn downwind."

Our business is failing and the sailboat, while enjoyable is just too expensive to store and maintain, let alone use.  It's financially prudent to pay off the loan and stop paying for marinas, insurance, etc.  She got a refit from 2012-2013 for a trip to the Caribbean.  Upgraded the GPS, new Raymarine radar, screens, AIS, EPIRB, etc.  Added Stainless Steel Davits, new (2013) Walker Bay RIB with mercury 8hp 2stroke, every rigging cable and terminal have been replaced as of 2014 (we broke the original headstay between the Turks and the DR).  We added a 2A spinnaker, replaced every line in 2013, added a 3 blade feathering prop, high capacity (100amp) alternator, 3000w inverter.  O and we added a Harken MK III when we replaced the rigging.  There is hardly an addition worth making that wasn't done, she's offshore ready and a shame to sell.  The only thing to add would be solar/wind power and a water maker, otherwise she couldn't be more loaded.  She could probably use new sails, they aren't torn or damaged, but definitely stretched, which isn't all bad, the 170 head-sail maintains a surprising amount of shape when reefed.

sailing,35tbqz,theshouldershrug,16,Wed May 13 09:51:44 2015 UTC,One of the best ways is to find a local yacht club (or sailing club) and see if there's a crew wanted / available list. The best kind of boat is one someone else owns.
sailing,35tbqz,Firebar,1 point,Wed May 13 10:44:09 2015 UTC,I will look into this.
sailing,35tbqz,Survove,1 point,Wed May 13 20:24:19 2015 UTC,"He makes a good point.  Joining a club introduces you to people who have the finances but still need a crew.  It's a great way to get experience on larger boats and skip on the expenses of owning one.  You mentioned in another reply that you were living in Manhattan.  The cost of keeping the boat is going to quickly exceed the cost of getting one.  But if you're going to get something small, I'd take the Laser over the Sunfish.  It'll give you a longer learning life."
sailing,35tbqz,Firebar,1 point,Thu May 14 00:08:04 2015 UTC,"This is mostly racing focused (that's what I mostly do) but it somewhat applies to cruising and deliveries too.   I would suggest checking websites or maybe giving the clubs a ring and ask if you could visit to see if you'd be interested. What clubs in my area (UK) have done typically is have crew wanted/available boards online with more stuff in the club itself. What you typically find is that organising club race crews is like herding cats, so even if you are not the most experienced person ever if you get reputation for being reliable and learning quickly you'll become in demand.  Another option is to look on Facebook, there might be a crew wanted/available page for your area. One of the chaps I know over here set one up mid last month and its got over 700 members and 50-60 opportunities. Lots come up at the last minute too, be ready to grab a bag and go sailing within 24 hours, being the one to say yes all the time makes you popular!"
sailing,35tbqz,IHateThisPartOfTexas,5,Thu May 14 02:52:29 2015 UTC,"Get a Laser or similar dinghy sailboat.  They're cheap, fast, forgiving and very difficult to sink (although easy to flip and right).  You can launch them anywhere, you'll never get stuck aground and you can fit two adults with camping gear on the bow if that's how you roll.  Also, in heavy air it's a great workout!  The things you learn in a small boat all translate to bigger boats, but not always the other way around.  I have a Laser, a 17' micro cruiser and membership to a fleet with 32'+ boats, and my Laser consistently gets the most action."
sailing,35tbqz,Green-and-Purple,1 point,Wed May 13 16:39:03 2015 UTC,got my v15 for $500 works great hull in good condition and gets on a plane up wind. Although storing gets expensive. Also if you buy a sailboat I would recommend replacing all the ring-dings pretty cheap and I recently had one break on the mast fell. No damage lost a pin but very inconvenient.
sailing,35tbqz,permalink_child,3,Thu May 14 02:39:12 2015 UTC,"When I lived in NYC - I took sailing lessons at age 24.  Wasn't even my idea - was my GF's idea at the time.  Anyway - the sailing thing was fun - and the GF did not last.  That December I went to a huge boating show (indoors) for fun - and discovered a sailing club i.e. just join as crew member - go out sailing.  Once spring came round - they even let me go out a few times to see if I liked the club for free.  I was hooked.  So I joined, eventually got permission to join with captain privileges so I could take my friends out sailing, met my wife there at the club and eventually got married.  We bought our own boat (used) and have been sailing it even since - 21 years on.  The boat has been the one constant in our lives over the years."
sailing,35tbqz,RenHoeX,5,Wed May 13 18:23:29 2015 UTC,"Here's my advice... (My own re-post) Want to sail for FREE? Here's how... You check your local sailing mag for race days in your area (Here in SF we have Latitude 38, brilliant rag...). Dress in layers and go down to your Marina/Yacht Club with a cardboard sign that reads, ""RAILMEAT FOR HIRE"" or ""WILL SAIL FOR FOOD""... seriously, I mean this... This is literally how I got into the sport and I've had a blast ever since... See, these guys that get the big boats NEED people to run them. It's a challenge racing a 40ftr. single handed! Even if you're a Noob we always need weight on the rail, makes the boat go faster! Be honest with your Skipper about how much experience you have in sailing and he'll put you in the right spot on board. My first few times out I was the Beer Man / Rail Meat... still had the time of my life. As a beginner you need to listen to all the more experienced sailors on board, don't be afraid to ask stupid questions, learn to tie a bowline and above all... DON'T FALL OFF THE BOAT! Also try to have a thick skin as some Skippers can be rather loud when giving orders. Don't take it personal, it is what it is... If you find yourself getting seasick do not be afraid or embarrassed to hurl, we've ALL done it and you usually feel tons better afterward. I cannot stress the importance of a PFD. That would probably be the most costly part of your gear for right now (a good one is around $120 - $150) but it is a MUST HAVE and you need to get in the habit of wearing it ALL THE TIME. Sea water is really cold and wet clothes are really heavy, not good for your health at all. I've got more tips but not enough time for now... Best of luck to you!!"
sailing,35tbqz,enuct,2,Thu May 14 05:09:16 2015 UTC,"Join someone to crew on Wednesday nights, Keep saving until you can also afford the storage of a boat. Between renting the cheapest slips and storing it on the hard it's about 1400 a year for a 25ft boat.   A lot of times people in the clubs will let you use their boat whenever you want if you become close friends. So don't stop dreaming of your own boat, just have fun on others for as long as you can. (nobody gets mad at you if you're the crew and the captain hits someone else)"

sailing,35sxmt,tallfellow,1 point,Wed May 13 08:41:44 2015 UTC,Time is the factor here. How long do you intend to spend on your sailboat?
sailing,35sxmt,tallfellow,1 point,Wed May 13 09:26:19 2015 UTC,"a day to a week at extreme most?  i've never sailed before, but i really want to. most people have told me to start of at around 20-25 feet for a first boat, and i'd love a friend (or two at most) to do it with me. i guess a week isn't really doable without a shower and a bigger water tank with 3 people? we really just want to hang out, have fun with the actual sailing, and well.. yeah. that. it really doesn't matter if it's that cramped.  to be honest i've never even been in a sailboat so all I have for cabin size is pictures which aren't really helping me."
sailing,35sxmt,Nachotime,15,Wed May 13 09:39:33 2015 UTC,"All depends on what you want to do. Spending the week on the boat doing day sails is one thing. Spending a week traveling from point to point is another. Think of it like the difference between camping in a campground vs backpacking.  In both cases you'll probably end up with a sloop rig.   In a 24' boat, you won't be able to stand up in the cabin. You'll have limited if any toilet facilities and probably no stove. Access to electricity will be limited. If you have a battery, it will be there for running lights, and maybe a dome light in the cabin.    At 30 feet, you'll have a head with a shower, there will be a galley with a 4 burner stove and possibly a tiny oven, you probably won't have refrigeration, but you'll have a cold storage locker.  The forward 'cabin' will sleep two, the main cabin will have two additional birth's a double and a single. If you're under 6' you'll be able to stand comfortably. You will have an inboard engine, it will probably be diesel. You probably will have hot water provided by the engine or when at the dock an electric hot water heater.  You will comfortably be able to sit 4 people at the table for a meal. You'll have electricity for lighting and ""entertainment"" a radio or a cd player while underway.  When at the dock you'll have access to 110 volt ac.   The 24 foot boot will be easily sail-able by one person, a second person could help. More than two people in the cockpit is going to interfere with your ability to sail effectively. More than 3 people is going to get uncomfortable quickly.   Sailing a 30 ft boat  will be possible with one person, but given your level of experience you will probably want to sail with a partner. Sailing with 3 or 4 aboard is much more comfortable, as the people not actively involved in sailing can spend time in the cabin and be comfortable.   You can probably find a reasonable, older boat for between 10,000 and 20,000 dollars. If you spend that much you will want to have the boat surveyed.   A boat of 22 to 24 ft can be anywhere from $1200 to $10,000.   if you just want to get your feet wet, and learn a bit before you commit to a large purchase a small day sailor like a laser for example could run from $1200 to $6500  Finally $270,000 buys you a brand new Jeanneau with 3 cabins for you and 5 of your closest friends to sail pretty much anywhere in the world.   Learning to sail, is going to be a skill you will always be able to improve. After a year or two of regular sailing you'll should have enough skill to begin to understand where your boat is strong and weak."
sailing,35sxmt,kelusk,4,Wed May 13 10:44:00 2015 UTC,"my wife and I are in the same position as OP and your post is really helpful and reinforced all of the research and mulling over that I've done.  thanks!   A buddy is giving me his laser in a month and I'll learn on that for the rest of the season (we live on the Chesapeake).  I'll also plan on taking a few ASA classes as well.   Then late next winter enter the market for something under 30 feet.  We'd rather not lay out a ton of cash to get our feet wet... Maybe finance the next boat but that's years down the road.  Do you have an opinion on the Pearson 26?  I've read a lot about it as being a good first boat and the $7k price point for a good condition boat is comfortable for us.  As for overnights, it'd only be me, the wife and the kid.  Maybe another couple minus the kid for a day sail."
sailing,35sxmt,Nachotime,2,Wed May 13 12:28:21 2015 UTC,Lasers are great fun and you'll learn quickly in one although prepare to capsize a lot and get very wet. Best thing about learning to sail in a dinghy is that it makes the actual sailing aspect on yachts a breeze as everything happens much slower and if you do go on to do yachting courses you'll be able to concentrate on the more technical aspects of yachting without having to devote to much attention to actually sailing one.  I'm not familiar with the Pearson 26 but a boat of that size seems practical for your needs. After you do a few courses see if you can find somewhere near you that offers a bareboat charter on the pearson 26 and take it out for a day or two and see how you like it before chucking all your money in on one.
sailing,35sxmt,kelusk,1 point,Wed May 13 13:27:24 2015 UTC,would you recommend me getting a small waterproof radio when I'm out on the laser?
sailing,35sxmt,Nachotime,2,Wed May 13 14:00:06 2015 UTC,"It depends on where you would be sailing from and how far you plan to go in the laser. If you're launching from a sailing club with safety boat cover then it's not really needed. If you're out on your own it's probably a worthwhile investment as if/when you move up to larger boats it's nice to have a handheld on deck to use instead of having to go below to where boat's large radio is.   In the US you don't need a license to operate a marine radio so you're sorted there but make yourself comfortable with radio procedure especially how to send a proper distress call/mayday, more info can be found at http://www.navcen.uscg.gov/?pageName=mtBoater  At my home sailing club we use this radio. It's 5 watts so it'll give you 3-5 miles range which is adequate for your intended use. Also it floats which is a big plus in something like a laser."
sailing,35sxmt,SpunkyChunkDunker,1 point,Wed May 13 14:27:09 2015 UTC,I have a marina in my neighborhood but won't be sailing out of a club.  most of my sailing will be alone but on a major river off the Chesapeake.  Thanks for the recommendation on the radio.

It'll comfortably sleep 4, 2 in the v berth and 2 on the table that drops into a bed. Me personally I prefer the cockpit. With a single hatch up front and no windows that open it can get a bit stuffy in the cabin when moored. I picked up a wind scoop and it's made a huge difference. 35 gal water tank was great for 3 people for 3 days. We kept bottled water to drink in a cooler and mostly used the water tank for filling up solar shower bags and washing dishes."

But, that size is probably going to limit you to more like weekend trips as the boat will lack necessities and stowage space."
sailing,35sxmt,Markol0,1 point,Wed May 13 17:39:01 2015 UTC,So you think about 2 days tops for a 25 foot boat for 2-3 people? I can live with that. Most I see have a bathroom which I guess is all you need for that time.
sailing,35sxmt,luke_s,3,Wed May 13 20:14:34 2015 UTC,"I mean, it's more that I think longer than that would be uncomfortable, not that it would be impossible.   I have done a lot of cruising (3-4 week trips) in the PNW on a Baba 35' just for your reference. Things to think about (in no particular order)?   holding tank size - there is a lot to talk about regarding holding tanks - but I'd estimate you would fill a 25 gallon tank in about 3 days with 3 people. So you need to be able to empty your tank accordingly. potable water tank size (+ space for bottled water if you don't want to drink from your tank water for whatever reason). Obviously you need to carry enough drinking water for your crew and water to wash dishes and potentially shower. If your boat has a raw water pump to the sink you can do some dish washing with salt water. And you can get a desalination system...  fuel tank size - A base line I like is that you should have enough fuel to be able to motor from where ever you happen to be to a place you can get more fuel. Depending upon how much motoring you do compared to sailing, realistically you probably want more. You can figure out how much fuel you need by determining the # of a gallons of fuel your engine burns per hour (1 gal/hour is pretty normal), your boats speed (probably hull speed which is related to the water line length and hull shape), and the distance you plan to travel (factoring in strong currents you could end up fighting is important). Having jerrycans to supplement your tank size is always an option. number of berths vs number of people - pretty straightforward other than when your quarter berths end up full of stuff and some is trying to sleep there... from my experience when cruising you end up with at least a full berth worth of junk, which usually means you have a full quarter berth (best place to store stuff), so if someone was going to sleep there, what do you do with the stuff at night?  storage space for both fresh and preserved foods - food is heavy and takes up space - yay! stowage for sails and other boat stuff like tools and stuff for repairs - depending on how many different sails you have they can easily take up a full berth. Hell, on my boat (40') I have a giant quarter berth filled with sails and a sea berth type thing behind one of the settees filled with sails (but I have a big boat with big sails...).  clothing and gear for your crew and what ever else you want to bring - how much does this all weigh and how much space does it take up? heat sources - depending on the climate you are in you may want heat at night (or it would be nice) and in the morning. Does the boat have diesel heater or does it only have electric space heaters? battery power - Does the boat have enough batteries to run cabin lights for a few hours at night? (and you better be able to run your anchor light all night). You can always add batteries if you have the space/can handle the weight. Solar panels are great for cruising to charge your batteries on a day you did not run your engine (assuming your engine charges your batteries).  fancy things - some people care about have refrigeration (more battery usage) and hot water and a shower on board. Personally I don't care about these things.  I'm against showering in boats (too much humidity added). Solar showers are great!    Sorry, this turned into a long response. I guess I don't want to say 25 is too small for longer trips, but personally I wouldn't want to be out in a boat that small for much longer than a weekend. Mostly because things you want for longer trips start to take up a lot of weight and space. And, being on a light little sailboat bogged down with stuff is no fun (also really impacts your sailing capacity). Also, most boats that size don't have enough head height in the cabin to stand.... and I think you really want to be able to standup in your cabin if you are going to be spending much time in it."
sailing,35sxmt,tallfellow,1 point,Wed May 13 21:54:03 2015 UTC,"I would not recommend anything more than day sails with 3 people in a 25'. It's just too cramped, and not enough creature comforts. There are not enough sleeping quarters. You barely all fit in the cockpit, and you are getting in the way of each other. After a full day, that gets annoying.   At 30' it's a whole new ballgame. You can actually go overnight, pretty reasonably to all sorts of places."
sailing,35sxmt,TheKert,1 point,Thu May 14 20:43:36 2015 UTC,What do you think about 2 people in a 25'? In your opinion could you last 2-3 days?
sailing,35sxmt,SchoonerKat1,1 point,Thu May 14 22:40:05 2015 UTC,"As long as you're ok not having a bathroom (beyond a bucket), no privacy, no electricity (not even enough to charge a cell phone), no shower, no sink (or yes sink, but no faucet,) and are comfortable being with that person within 10 feet of you at all times, yeah, I supposed it could work. I could probably handle such a trip with my spouse, or closest friend, but that's probably it. It's like camping/backpacking, except you're tied at the hip for the duration where even taking a dump is right in front of each other.  I should say that my experience is based on Merit 25 and J24 and Olson 25. Perhaps other boats have better creature comforts which would make it a different story."
sailing,35sxmt,tkaraszewski,1 point,Fri May 15 13:25:37 2015 UTC,"I think with the size though comes more stuff - a 50 foot boat doesn't have a bunch of empty space in it compared to a 24 footer.  Instead the extra space is filled with showers, kitchens, navigation equipment, a small work shop, washing machine and drier, desalinator, power for it all,  etc, etc.  All these things are typically adapted to work out at sea and hence cost $$$ - For example you don't just use a standard house toilet on a boat, because there is no sewer for it to be plumbed into!  Instead there needs to be holding tanks, pumps, etc.  Also when looking at boat prices you need to keep an eye on maintenance.  Things on a boat undergo a lot of abuse and live in a harsh environment.  They wear out and need replacing.  A $3000 boat may need new sails, rigging, an engine, painting and anti-fowling.  A $30k boat may have had a previous owner that has kept up with the maintenance."
sailing,35sxmt,permalink_child,1 point,Wed May 13 12:58:50 2015 UTC,"If I found a 3-4k boat that was in excellent shape, what would be the yearly upkeep? Excluding batteries/food/etc."
sailing,35sxmt,redUSAKA,2,Wed May 13 13:19:16 2015 UTC,"Annual upkeep is a mixed bag. What you'll need depends on your boat and what breaks. If you keep it in the water most of the year,  count on bottom paint every couple of years.  If you buy a used boat, sails are likely to be an issue. And I know you'll say, hey they are sails, they aren't torn, but your sails are your engine. If the cloth is weak, or too flexible, then you're not going to get the best performance from them.  Speaking of engines, engines need servicing, diesel mechanics are expensive.   If you put the boat away for the winter at the marina, count on a winterization package, and the cost of a cover. Electronics go bad, you may need a radio, or a chart plotter, or a GPS, wind speed, depth meter. Does the boat have radar?  Some sensors are buried in the hull and can only be replaced if the boat is out of the water. Some sensors live at the top of your mast.   Lines occasionally need replacing. hardware needs to be reset periodically. The list goes on and on. There's a reason they say the two happiest days of a sailors life are the day he buys his boat and the day he sells it.  Cushions may need replacing. You have a bunch of holes in your boat that let water in an out hopefully in a controlled way. These through hulls need to be periodically inspected and sooner or later may need replacing.   Is your boat trailerable? The shorter your boat, the more likely that you don't have to keep it in a marina, and so you don't pay a monthly marina fee.   Where are you going? How often are you going to sail? How much can you do yourself? What are you going to do when the boat floods while you're not around and the engine under water for 2 or 3 days. Is it corroded beyond repair?  10k for an engine replacement is not unreasonable.   Boats are often expensive and occasionally very expensive.  Or you can go a whole season like I did when I first got my Morgan and only spend the marina fee and the cost of the fuel ($45 for the season, out once a week most of the summer).   The bigger the boat, the more it's going to cost you. Smaller boats cost significantly less than larger and the point of significant expense increase is can you put your boat on a trailer."
sailing,35sxmt,drive2fast,1 point,Wed May 13 14:07:13 2015 UTC,Thanks for the info m8 really helpful.
sailing,35sxmt,tallfellow,1 point,Wed May 13 20:17:58 2015 UTC,"2-3 almost definitely. Beyond that, depends a lot on the model and how the space is used. The other comment that you could fit 4 easily is correct in many situations, but there's 24 foot boats where you really wouldn't want more than 3 people or it would be too cramped.   Length is a pretty major factor but I raced last year on a 33 foot boat in a race where at least a dozen boats were shorter, between 25-30 feet, and we were still the lightest by at least 500 lbs. There's just so much variety in designs that you really can't generalize based on just the length of the hull."
sailing,35sxmt,Vomberg,1 point,Wed May 13 16:26:42 2015 UTC,"Not only size but age of the boat.  I would say that most used older sailboats are going to be under 100k if not 50k. 300k price point is going to be a new boat. Boats like cars depreciate in value quickly, but unlike cars, old boats (well maintained) usually maintain a depreciated value (bottoms out somewhere in the < 100k price range depending on size)."
sailing,35sxmt,Pastelitomaracucho,9,Wed May 13 17:27:05 2015 UTC,So you posted a $3k sailboat. Here's one closer to your $300k mark.  Let me know if you can't actually tell them apart.
sailing,35sxmt,Pastelitomaracucho,3,Wed May 13 14:32:55 2015 UTC,Nice thing about a $3K boat - is that when you get tired of it or want to upgrade - you can sell it easily for $3K.   San Juan 24 is a very nice day sailor - generally was well built for coastal cruising and day sailing.  This one is probably already sold.   Also - first time sailors have these romantic notions of cruising the coast or heading to Catalina Island - and the reality is - if you even use the boat at all - it will be only after work or the occassional Saturday afternoon with a few beers and a few friends -  watching the sunset - and it will be a total blast.
sailing,35sxmt,Pastelitomaracucho,1 point,Wed May 13 18:09:42 2015 UTC,So you're saying a night or two stay inst doable on a 25 foot boat? Or are you saying people usually just go out for a Sunday?

sailing,35uzps,rantifarian,2,Wed May 13 20:26:48 2015 UTC,"Also useful if into hiking or skiing etc. (The PLB that is, the other one is useless there). I personally have this one http://www.kannadmarine.com/en/safelink-solo-plb which is internally identical to the McMurdo Fast Find 220. They're probably outside your intended budget, though you might find a good deal if you look hard.  They're designed to be worn and triggered manually if you go over the side, the AIS SART is a short range device that commercial vessels (by law) and some leisure vessels should be able to pick up. The PLB is a satellite based system which CG coordinates with.   If youre just day sailing with normal sized crews they're less important but there have been a few incidents recently where people were located thanks to these things."
sailing,35uzps,Firebar,1 point,Thu May 14 02:42:39 2015 UTC,"In the past I would have said the PLB was the best choice, but as more and more yachts have AIS for offshore racing they are becoming more useful.

sailing,35sqke,BatmanSandwich,3,Wed May 13 04:51:53 2015 UTC,"How in hell you get that money at 23?  I think you are quite spot on OP. Having a bigger boat means all the efforts are much bigger, especially if you are alone and looking to buy a older boat. I would say a 42footer is the best compromise, although there are some very seaworthy 35 footers out there.   Bigger means bigger marina fees, bigger sails, more antifouling paint, bigger repairs, etc etc etc.   For blue water sailing you need good acoomodation. Plenty of room for safety equipment, ergonomic deck layout so you can act quickly  when managing sails, no soft hulls, no blisters, no heavy corrosion, well kept engine, seacocks in place, keel bolts must be solid, sails in decent state."
sailing,35sqke,Pastelitomaracucho,4,Wed May 13 11:40:15 2015 UTC,"-What should I look for in a boat for blue water sailing?  Solid core, solid and functional rig design, clean engine, engine location where you'd prefer, no major blister problems associated with build quality, small cockpit incase you get pooped, keel stepped mast, comfort and function with the bulkheads (you wouldn't want a v-berth that's too short), a quarter berth would offer the most comfort sleeping at sea, no deckside anchor locker, full keel or atleast skeg protected rudder, Balance displacement ratio for when you broach, headroom is a serious consideration, above all beauty as it will be your home. That's your foundation, not including all the extra equipment you'd probably want as well (self steering wind vane, electronics, leds, solar, canvas..). S&S 34 would be a sweet boat..  -Is my budget realistic? I could go for something larger and more comfortable and spend a bit extra doing it up and making it seaworthy  Your budget is fantastic. Get the smallest boat you can live with to keep maintenance costs down. Keep in mind you might pick up crew here and there. Slip fees get exponentially higher per foot of boat.. Bigger drafts can limit where you can go too. Be thrifty, money comes and goes quickly. Maintenance, foreign ports, etc costs $$$$  -What are important things to consider in planning to live and travel on a boat?  What you'll come back to.. Would it be worth it..

A 45ft will have roughly double the volume and more than double the price of a comparable quality 35ft in the second hand market, and while there are relatively ""budget"" 35 footers, 45ft boats are generally high end.  I think it would be wise to stay small. 35ft or even less. For 1 or 2 people it's fine, and you can move up later with more experience. Stay small and keep comfortably within your budget would be my advice, if you need to ask in here it means you shouldn't buy a big boat at least yet."

Then hang around marinas and learn to race in some cruiser racer at your local club, still quite easy. Next hang around boat yards in a select few places (Cowes/Southampton in the UK) and do day work on proper raceboats. Hope that one day they are a man short and ask you to come out to race, do well in that race and be invited back, slowly work your way into the normal race crew.   All the time network like crazy, keep working your way in to bigger and better teams. You do this by word of mouth or by joining their shore team and being hoped to be asked to race. 99% of people will fail at this point and up till now you have been racing for free but if you are lucky someone might offer to pay you to go racing, likely on something shit but you accept. Do well on the paid gig, hopefully get offered more and better ones, now you are spending almost all of your time sailing not working in the yard.   Most of the gigs will be boring, pro bowman on some rich guys cruiser racer etc. but that's the reality of pro sailing, 99% of the 1% who didn't fail earlier will get stuck at this level. If you are lucky you will break into one of the all pro racing circuits, TP52s, extreme 40s etc. from there if you are good enough and lucky enough you may get picked up by an Americas cup team after 5/10 years.

Even costal cruising may take you out of coverage that your cell phone's antenna can pick up, so something like this product helps: http://www.thewirie.com/ You can buy them to pick up cell and wifi from miles off shore and make a local network around your boat. During longer crossings, you'll be too focused on enjoying sailing and navigating to care about the internet, otherwise you wouldn't be setting out for the next few years on a boat. I'd recommend just getting a Delorme or other text/location capable satellite link so you can send/receive texts and email and broadcast your location to a website or somewhere people know to look in case they haven't heard from you.   On a deeper note, if you're looking at adopting this lifestyle, then remoteness and connection to nature should probably be in your interests. If you're constantly plugged in to the internet, then you may miss the natural beauty that comes with living on the water. I just returned from 3 months in the Caribbean, it was a great chance to exercise a balance with work.

It's engaging and full of quotes that you'll want to print out and stick on your wall.   My favourite, which I apply to many aspects of life, sailing or otherwise:  Go on deck often, regardless of the weather. Many things are cured by the wind and the sea, if you stay on deck with them long enough. – Bernard Moitessier"

I can only imagine what it would be like if I am in the freezing waters and it is inflated and I am weighed down by many pounds of waterlogged heavy clothing.  Right now, I have a jury rigged rope crotch strap that I use to keep the vest in place.  But I would like something better fitting that is actually integrated with the vest.   I can't find anything at an actual store that has crotch straps.  And I am reluctant to order a 500 pound vest from england over the internet without any chance to see it or try it on first.

When slip holders stop paying rent and basically walk away from their boats altogether the Marina takes ownership of the boat and then tries to get rid of them ASAP.

Unless you luck into an unbelievable deal (which does happen but is very rare) project boats will generally soak up more money than a maintained boat that is ready to go.  If you save a grand at purchase it might cost you $1500 down the road.  Educate yourself about potential problems and the associated costs before you approach a boat so you can make an informed purchasing decision.

sailing,35izla,IvorTheEngine,1 point,Mon May 11 01:39:23 2015 UTC,"Totally depends on what you want to do.  If you are happy spending your time and money restoring a boat then go cheap: We paid around $2,000 2 years ago, and have probably sunk around $10,000 and countless weekends into her. I guess once the current round of repairs finishes she will be worth around $4,000-$5,000 in total. We love our boat, enjoy every moment of it, and have never once looked back. We knew whatever money we put into it would never come out again and just wrote it down as a cost of having a $2,000 yacht. In fact we just budget $600/month on it and upgrade things as funds become available. If she becomes unsafe to sail we simply miss out for a few months until we can afford to and can find the time to upgrade the critical component. It may be more expensive this way, but we are learning lots in the process, and every sail is an adventure!  If on the other hand you want to save some money in the long term buying cheap is a false economy - well maintained boats tend to be under-valued on the market, so find one and benefit from the years of good maintenance!"
sailing,35izla,Lojoe,1 point,Mon May 11 01:40:23 2015 UTC,"Do you think you might have been better off getting a loan for a $10,000 boat and paying it off over 2 years?"

sailing,35izla,SchoonerKat1,1 point,Tue May 12 23:33:07 2015 UTC,"I found that a 1980 30 foot sailboat you needed to spend about 12,000 and up to get one that would be in good enough condition to leave the dock with it. Now that is SALE price. So knock 20% off that price and you get about in the range (in my experience buying a boat. ) I spent a lot more than 12 but mine was absolutely loaded and from the time I have spent on it I can tell everything works now. Except for minor little ""Shakedown"" items."
sailing,35izla,theTopsail,1 point,Mon May 11 13:26:18 2015 UTC,"Personally, I would up the budget for a boat needing less expensive repairs (and get it surveyed). Or avoid repairs that need a lot of yard time (depending if that is going to be expensive for your situation). Getting a boat hauled out (not counting time spent in the yard) is already a few hundred dollars depending on size/location.   This is more for a larger boat than you are thinking (more like 40'), I can think of a number of people that got a boat for pretty much nothing, practically rebuilt the thing and maybe they dump 60k into it, where they could have gotten a functional comparable boat for 40k.   The sad truth about boat restoration is that you are going to spend more money fixing up a rundown boat, than buying a used boat in good maintained condition (unless you get amazingly lucky). Also, you can be sailing and upgrading a well maintained boat a lot sooner (which should be more fun?). Also, depending on the size and situation, you could spend significantly more than the boat is worth fixing it.   This all being said, I totally plan to dump 20k+ into getting a new racing main for my boat (which I just bought for 44k) in a couple years, so it's all relative and boat ownership is not a good economical choice pretty much no matter what you do. But awesome and hopefully brings you lots of happiness."

I might be able to get her to come out on a big cat sometime, but that'll mean hiring one (which is a plan of mine) up on a quiet waterway. Catch being, we've got a 6 month old now, so that suddenly turns into a much more complicated proceeding than before.  The time (and limited money) I'm spending on the boat is another major part of why she hates it so much. Time I'm on the boat is time I'm not spending with our daughter."

sailing,35dwxq,RandomGuySteve,2,Sat May 9 14:42:29 2015 UTC,It really depends on the boat and the conditions. On a beam reach you don't have much pitching (fore and aft movement) because you're abeam to the waves in which you would usually feel more side to side rolling if the boat weren't leaning on its sails. It seems way harder and scarier than at a dock but in reality it isn't too much different. IMHO Ratlins are a pain in the ass to climb in seas. On a halyard you just have to pay attention and not go off for a swing.

sailing,35eynl,justfred,9,Tue May 12 14:09:33 2015 UTC,"So basically there's two points that are a major concerns with a typical sailboat (bigger than a dinghy). The first is the point (or angle) of vanishing stability (typically about 125-140 on a monohull, 90 on a catamaran). That is the point where the boat, under normal conditions won't right itself. its much higher than most people thing but it just goes to show how important that big chunk of lead on the bottom is. Secondly there is the downflooding angle, the angle at which water will enter a non-self draining area (cabin, engine room, non-scuppered cockpits). This is typically higher than the point of vanishing stability (140-165) because of form stability meaning that because of the larger volume in the transom, will twist as they roll, lifting the companionway (usually first place to flood) out of the water to a certain point."
sailing,35eynl,Sld109,1 point,Sat May 9 19:10:11 2015 UTC,"Some graphs to illustrate your points:  http://www.wavetrain.net/boats-a-gear/471-modern-sailboat-design-quantifying-stability  http://i.imgur.com/xGC7vps.jpg  Some boats have no AVS, meaning they will come back up no matter what:  http://i.imgur.com/8S5uhfO.jpg  However an AVS of 160 degrees should be enough that the kind of conditions that will knock you upside down, will also bring you back up. Contessas are around 165 deg of AVS and they are renowned for coming back up."
sailing,35eynl,muyuu,7,Tue May 12 12:19:44 2015 UTC,"How far can a sailboat tilt before it will turn around or fill with water?     This 'tilt' is called heeling. How far a boat can heel without being swamped or capsizing (when the top of the mast touches the water) depends on the boat, but most can go further than you'd think. Most of the mono-hulls I've sailed will go past 45 degrees without issue, even small ones. Once or twice I got my catamaran to 90 degrees and had it come back down without any problems, but that's not a great way to get anywhere usually.    And what dangers are there when sailing?     The same dangers as on any boat mostly. The only added complication is the boom crossing the deck, and the possibility of getting tangled in some of the lines (heavily dependent on boat type again). As long as you pay attention to whats going on you'll be fine."

I only just got into sailing, but it's interested me for roughly half my life. They can lean a good bit, but under most conditions the boat will take care of you. When we got heeling really far on my first time, I thought it was exciting, but different people will respond differently to things"
sailing,35eynl,0OKM9IJN8UHB7,1 point,Sun May 10 03:36:16 2015 UTC,"Remember, typically speaking about 40% of the boat's weight is in the big lead keel bolted to the bottom. This puts the center of gravity near, if not under, the waterline. Furthermore, the farther you are heeled over, the less sail is actually in the wind. Even if you do get knocked down in a big gust (mast in the water) so long as the cabin was shut up tight, the boat often self rights, or will once you release the sails, often quite violently."

I don't know the area, but if you have to drive a long way around a bay, sailing could work. The main factor is going to be where you leave the boat at each end, and how long it takes to get there.   If you're willing to get a taxi or public transport one a month or so when you don't fancy sailing, I think it could work. Will you be commuting in the dark during the winter?"

Smith's Marina charges $20 to use the ramp, even for a Laser. I was just up there today. I've sailed down by the academy and it's really choppy in a little boat. For the record, Truxton's public ramp is only $5, but it's a hassle for me to get down there."
sailing,35ej45,dudeman7557,4,Sat May 9 15:58:24 2015 UTC,"First- realize that the best exercise program is one you are actually going to do.  Be realistic about your goals for each workout, don't be bummed if you don't progress as fast as you expect (or at all), and above all involve something you kinda enjoy.    Second- hiking is as much a leg workout as a core workout.  I know your legs start to burn first, but trust me, you don't want to start building a concrete foundation for a straw hut.    Okay, exercises first:   Ideally, squats- They require a good deal of core along with hitting all the muscle groups.  However, squats can be an intimating exercise because they require barbells, you need to learn the correct form, and there is potential for injury if you do them wrong.  If you gonna go this route, I would pick a barbell program for a beginner that also includes lifts like deadlifts and bench presses.  /r/fitness is a great resource for this and you should be easy to find some beginner lifting programs.  I would advocate strongly for you to spend the time and get involved with barbell training.  You mentioned you are also below weight for a full rig.  Picking up and putting down heavy things along with eating at a caloric surplus is the age-old solution to getting heavy and stronger.  You're probable young, so don't worry about getting fat because you cut (eat at a coloric deficit) very easily.      An option with a lower barrier to entry would be a bodyweight fitness routine: planks, wall-sits, side planks, reverse planks, any dynamic core exercise involving twists (bicycle crunches, elbows to knees, hands to each side), lunges, mountain climbers, and leg lifts are a few examples.  I know you're focused on hiking but I would throw in push-ups and pull-ups as well.  There is always /r/bodywieght fitness for more info.   Now, activities:    Riding a bicycle is possibly the most accessible activity that provides the most bang for you buck.  Don't worry what kind of bike, fatter tires are even better because they add more resistance.  Go find a hill, pedal up, ride down, repeat.  Go up and down a few time, rest, then rinse-repeat for an hour or so.  Skiing off-season also does a great job of cross training (with tele being even better), but that is kinda a whole other ball game unless you're from the southern hemisphere is not gonna help in the short run. Hiking (on trails)/running, preferably up things.  Go find some stairs or a mountain/hill and go up, down, repeat.  Bonus points if you grab a backpack and fill it with some weight.  Just jogging/running without any elevation change is certainly not bad for you and does great things for your ability to manage pain, but doesn't really hit the muscle group associated with hiking.  A good rule of thumb is if you can't make you quads hurt than its probably not helping your hiking Here is where I'll throw in Yoga because if you are serous about sailing you will realize the related nature that balance, coordinating, and strength play in your performance as a racer.  This is all right up yoga's ally.  Don't be intimated by any of the stereotypes or stigma surrounding it, find a class near you, wear normal athletic clothing, bring a towel and water bottle, and go have fun.  If that is not possible, check /r/yoga for some youtube videos of beginner routines.   Finally, you are probably young so go check out whats available and find what you like.  It could very easily be a mix and match of whats above along with other stuff."
sailing,35ej45,i-like-boatz,1 point,Sat May 9 18:27:45 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot for the answer! Quite helpful. Of course actually sailing is the most obvious exercise, but I only train about 6 hours a week (you were right about me being young... Therefore I don't have any money to spend on a boat or a club membership) and don't have access to boats outside of that. I was thinking of making a hiking bench...  Turns out I'm already doing quite well doing some of the exercises you suggested :) I bike a lot and spend ~3 hours a week working out, squats definitely included. I haven't been going to the gym that long, so I am still experimenting with sets/reps/rest cycles in all the exercises I do. I Was doing 3/15/30seconds, then 3/12/45s, now 3/8/60s squatting 200 lbs. I guess going for more reps less weight would be better? I was going to go back to 3/12/45 for mix of endurance and strength but if I should try something else.   Thanks again for the reply!"

You can find great info on sail trim, tactics, tune, etc. but for TEAM performance nothing beats time and practice together.

sailing,35dkxq,Quagers,3,Sat May 9 07:52:32 2015 UTC,"Disclaimer: my experience is in J80s, 24s, and 22s. However, that's heavy weather so you'll be in survival mode anyway.   Upwind: tight everything: stays, halyards, vang, outhaul, cunningham, mainsheet, and backstay. Your jib cars should be back to make a good flat slot and your jib strapped in tight. I personally would play the traveller mid-ship and lower in big sustained puffs (avoid weather-helm if possible) while playing the backstay in the smaller, less sustained puffs (J's, as a rule, love backstay). Have your pitman and jib trimmer hike like hell and call puffs and waves. Have the skipper sail a high mode to use the inevitable weather helm to your advantage.  Downwind: If you're going to use a spinnaker, which has a decent chance of ripping in that kind of weather, depending on thickness, be careful of the broach. Main should be out all the way and traveller to leeward. One crew member should be ready to blow the vang at any time. The trimmer might need main trimmer to grind on the winch. Skipper should focus on keeping the boat as close to DDW as (s)he's comfortable with considering sea-state and how much the direction of the puffs is varying. If you start to broach, turn the boat to leeward to shadow the spin. You should also let the tack of the spinnaker float off the sprit unless when you do it floats to leeward. In heavy wind, this helps you sail deeper by making the spin act a bit more like a symmetrical.  Hope this helps. Best of luck. Sail fast and sail safe!"
sailing,35dkxq,Red_Hot_Saulsa,2,Sat May 9 10:46:47 2015 UTC,"This downwind advice does not fit with how we sail the boats in SF Bay. We don't sail the boat DDW in heavy weather, and we don't let off the tack line in heavy weather. The boat is slow DDW. In 25 knots, you should be up and planing with 12-15 knots of boatspeed at an apparent wind angle of probably roughly 135 degrees-ish. Jib should be out with the kite at those speeds as well.  We only try and sail deep with an eased tack line when the wind is light and the boat won't plane."
sailing,35dkxq,tkaraszewski,1 point,Sat May 9 16:39:32 2015 UTC,Fair enough. This going to be off St. Francis?
sailing,35dkxq,Red_Hot_Saulsa,3,Sat May 9 16:52:34 2015 UTC,"The boat doesn't work with no kite downwind, the trim is all off. Also, nobody knows what the fastest way to sail the boat downwind with no kite is in 25 knots because nobody has spent any time trying.  But upwind, let the main flog if you need to. You'll definitely be sailing it with a bubble in the luff. keep the boat flat and head up in the puffs. Try to keep the jib working. Basically just strap everything on tight and point to keep the boat level-ish. Keep the boat moving through tacks, even if you come down a bit off the wind to keep speed up. This matters less when it's really windy."
sailing,35dkxq,tkaraszewski,1 point,Sat May 9 16:27:25 2015 UTC,"Just as an update,  It was team racing so organisers decide the sail plan 1 reef and no kites downwind.  With this set up we found the jib massively overpowers the main and the boat was pretty unbalanced. You have to keep the leech of the main tight to keep the bow up and so we were traveller down all the way to bottom of the track. You then had to pinch to keep control. If you flogged the main and put the bow down the jib over heeled the boat but also pulled the bow down rather than up as is normal when overpowered so you just slipped sideways.  This is completely contrary to any tuning guides but then non of them are written for reefs.  Great day sailing, completely exhausted now."

You see this with boats that are ""not for sale to us citizens in us waters""  Also, this is probably a charter boat beat to hell vs. the boat in Virginia which is a owner boat.  Check the engine hours for sure for a giveaway."
sailing,35d6ic,strolls,1 point,Sun May 10 05:41:33 2015 UTC,"I suspect all the Croatian boats have been chartered.  They're also frequently not VAT-paid - that affects EU buyers in a way that it doesn't affect Americans, but my concern is that Croatia might require a private buyer to pay VAT before sailing away. I have no idea whether that's a genuine risk or not, or even if Croatia has VAT.  I would like to take a look down there for myself, but I can't reconcile the condition of this boat, for example, with its price.  I, too, feel like it's too good to be true, but I suspect you could get a bargain if you're prepared to spend a few weeks down there, walking the docks.  The Adriatic seems to have a particularly high concentration of boats, and if you were to make lowball offers with cash, wouldn't someone bite eventually?  The best time to score a deal would be in the winter, when it would be a cheap place to stay."
sailing,35d6ic,eschew_umbrellas,1 point,Sun May 10 06:18:02 2015 UTC,I would also be curious about shore power. Is it wired for 240v?
sailing,35ankj,BioGeek,2,Fri May 8 14:49:25 2015 UTC,This is old right...Puma isn't even in this round of VOR
sailing,35ankj,night0wl,1 point,Sat May 9 00:10:48 2015 UTC,"Right, this is from 2013-2014"
sailing,35ankj,B5_S4,0,Sat May 9 05:16:36 2015 UTC,I don't get it. What am I missing?
sailing,35ankj,Vavat,1 point,Fri May 8 18:43:32 2015 UTC,For some sailors this video is full of interesting details and skills.
sailing,35ankj,i-n-g-o,1 point,Sat May 9 07:54:56 2015 UTC,Really? Like what?
sailing,35ankj,Vavat,1 point,Sat May 9 10:04:15 2015 UTC,"Well try to remember that the bow is probably dropping a few meters with every wave, you can kinda see him timing his movements between sail/stay positions so the floor won't drop out from under him while he moves. As for what he's doing, it looks like he's take the slack sheet on the code zero and bringing it around the forestay so the next time they gybe, instead of having to furl up they sail they can just let it go around the outside of the forestay and pull it in on the other tack. I'm not 100% sure why they would be going for that option,maybe its safer in those conditions, maybe its faster.         I was still hoping to see a bit more spray, the conditions seem pretty mild compared to what the VOR can bring."
sailing,35ankj,ThatsMrKoolAidToYou,1 point,Sat May 9 19:16:41 2015 UTC,"The bow wave is pretty stable, so sea conditions are moderate. From safety point of view there is nothing spectacular or he'd have strapped himself to a jack. It's a routine operation in mild conditions in broad daylight, and I didn't understand what's special about it. Hence the question if I missed something. Never mind I guess."
sailing,35ankj,Vavat,1 point,Sat May 9 20:20:28 2015 UTC,"In that case you didn't really miss anything, It's not the most exciting clip."
sailing,35bxl8,dinoparty,4,Fri May 8 20:58:50 2015 UTC,Err I'm not totally sure that's a good idea. The plastics used in blocks are much stronger than what a 3d printer can provide.
sailing,35bxl8,Sld109,1 point,Sat May 9 02:13:46 2015 UTC,They print stronger materials than you'd think: http://www.stratasys.com/materials/fdm
sailing,35bxl8,enuct,1 point,Sat May 9 18:39:01 2015 UTC,"Do you mean sheave? check defender, I don't have a J but that seems a bit high if you meant Sheeve."
sailing,35bxl8,texasrigger,1 point,Sat May 9 03:09:33 2015 UTC,"Long time J24 sailor here.  What do you mean by mast blocks?  Sheaves?  Step?  If sheaves, you can measure off the masthead directly.  The guy from zephyrworks wrote up an article on measuring and tolerances in a recent Good Old Boat magazine.  Admittedly I don't know anything about 3d printing but I've made a ton of sheaves over the years.  I turn them out if black delrin with a bronze hub."
sailing,357lsw,wahoosfishtaco24,3,Thu May 7 19:46:56 2015 UTC,How was picking up the mooring by yourself?
sailing,357lsw,numa_pompilius,1 point,Fri May 8 00:52:07 2015 UTC,"haha! I was so confused about the second loop... had no idea what i was doing. I think I tangled three mornings before someone in a dingy motored up and showed me ""the ropes""... dun dun tsss"
sailing,357lsw,numa_pompilius,1 point,Sat May 9 04:36:22 2015 UTC,I'm making the trip this September and honestly that's the only thing I'm sweating. I tip my floppy old man skipper hat to you.
sailing,357lsw,gusnyc,2,Sat May 9 23:51:23 2015 UTC,That is SO awesome!. You look so happy in the picture. Congrats buddy!. What are your plans for the summer?.
sailing,357lsw,cyancynic,2,Thu May 7 22:17:53 2015 UTC,"Thanks man! This summer I plan on sailing, recording music, and waiting tables to pay the bills!"
sailing,357lsw,drunkenMaster,2,Thu May 7 23:04:48 2015 UTC,"Well, one of them makes money, anyhow.  Congrats on the accomplishment.  I recall my first ocean trip from Sausalito out around the Farallons (double handed with my bud).  One of the greatest days of my life."
sailing,357lsw,gunexpert69,2,Fri May 8 15:21:22 2015 UTC,"I'm from Canada, and I remember my first trip vividly thanks to Catalina island. It was very dark and dreary for 6 days then the morning I arrived, the sky opened up over the island to welcome me. Keep sailing!"
sailing,357lsw,gunexpert69,2,Fri May 8 00:06:57 2015 UTC,i did that in my hobie cat about 4 years back!
sailing,357lsw,gunexpert69,1 point,Fri May 8 01:23:54 2015 UTC,Hahaha that's gnarly!
sailing,357lsw,kostcoguy,1 point,Sat May 9 04:37:47 2015 UTC,I also did Dana point from marina deal rey
sailing,357lsw,G--Man,1 point,Sat May 9 04:41:09 2015 UTC,How was it going around Palos Verdes? I had to move my boat from King Harbor to Cabrillo and we had to use the outboard to get around the hill because it blocked the wind. I would love to sail back around...
sailing,357lsw,d_fos,1 point,Sat May 9 04:46:00 2015 UTC,At that point I was probably 3/4 of the way to Catalina so it wasn't bad
sailing,357lsw,Survove,1 point,Sat May 9 04:47:14 2015 UTC,Oh gotcha
sailing,35at9y,glambx,5,Fri May 8 15:35:38 2015 UTC,"Never heard of cross-compatibility in radar and networked chart plotters.  And remember, nmea and nmea 2000 will not convey radar data.  I've only seen it done through the cat 5 style network cables.  Radar data is essentially video and not much else has the bandwidth.  Sorry I can't think of any helpful tricks.  Raymarine may offer a more affordable smaller mfd well suited to the helm. -former marine electrician"
sailing,35at9y,SoloSquirrel,3,Fri May 8 16:08:11 2015 UTC,"Nope, no way.  Radar is one of the last bastions of proprietary equipment that manufacturers are requiring you to buy a head unit that is the same as the radar unit.    There are ""hacks"" that exist.  The OpenCPN team have reverse engineered Simrad/Lowrance's 3g and 4g radars to work with OpenCPN software.  They have also done the same w/Garmin's radar.  Raymarine, however has not been hacked."
sailing,35at9y,night0wl,2,Fri May 8 20:30:17 2015 UTC,"I don't know for sure. That said, I've never been able to successfully get Raymarine electronics to play nice with anything else. NMEA 2000 is certainly better than the older standard, but while I love Raymarine's gear, I've always hated how tough it is to make interoperable with other gear. Make sure at a minimum your plotter supports NMEA 2000.  Be sure what you want to do is possible before you buy."
sailing,35at9y,engeleh,1 point,Fri May 8 16:07:21 2015 UTC,"I've got plenty of NMEA2000 interop between Raymarine and other gear on my boat.  It seems to work well.  I've also written custom NMEA 2000 stuff that easily talks to my Raymarine stuff.  Radars don't speak over NMEA 2000, they are generally either analog video or digital video over ethernet.  Raymarine A65/A67 is discontinued and often inexpensive and will talk to their digital radars.  I don't know what radar your C70 used."
sailing,35at9y,Alex--W,1 point,Mon May 11 22:12:43 2015 UTC,It's looking like I'll have to stay all Raymarine.  Ah well.  Thanks for the replies guys!
sailing,35at9y,hvyhitter,1 point,Fri May 8 17:14:43 2015 UTC,"I have the same C70 right at the helm.   http://i.imgur.com/rfUorZD.jpg That is my dad with me at the helm. LOVED this thing. Autopilot was AMAZING.   Used it yesterday with the ST60 system integrated. I used it on a 9 hour power, full sail, motorsail and then back to power. I was thinking about upgrading too BEFORE I used it. Now I love it and want to see how I integrate AIS into it.   if you have the RADAR unit (because the c70 is just the display unless I am mistaken)   I might want to buy it off you. I could use Radar."
