theworldisflat,3e6zzq,jtcribbs,2,Wed Jul 22 13:45:20 2015 UTC,Slightly faster?  A flight from L.A. to New York is over 8 hours.  Traveling from New York to L.A. is a 3 hour flight.  That is a little bit more than a jet stream my friend.

It includes all the space agencies everywhere, including the Russian and Chinese which have historically been somewhat unfriendly towards the US. And, of course, we have to include all their contractors like Thiokol and SpaceX with their thousands of employees who also have to be kept quiet.  We have to add in the US military, since they created and administer the GPS hoax. Plus all of their subcontractors. Plus telecommunications companies like Iridium, which spent billions of dollars on fake satellite launches to provide global communications. Add in all the people and companies that pay for satellite phones that obviously can't work.  We also have to add all naval and aviation navigators, both military and civilian, who have to pretend that GPS works in the middle of the ocean even though we all know it can't. Also, all of the surveyors of the last two centuries who hushed up the fact that Australia is three times further from Chile than we have been told. While we are on the subject, we also have to add in the airline and cruise industries that provide transport between South America and Australia. They have to keep thinking up imaginative excuses as to why the promised trips all have to be cancelled at the last minute.  Then there are all scientists from many different countries who spend extended periods of time at the South Pole, and have to keep posting fake videos of 24-hour daylight, and have to hush up the fact that you can't actually travel to the South geographic pole.  So, once you add in these few people, you can quickly see how such a conspiracy could be so thoroughly and carefully maintained. After all, if two people can keep a secret, it should be much easier for several million, right?"

Everyone else simply works toward completing their mission, but they would never guess their mission is 1/100th of a larger mission that they would never agree with. You make the assumption that literally every single person who works within these programs would say something if they knew something was wrong. That's an incorrect assumption to make.

They want complete domination of our minds to deceive us into doing what they want us to do; work for their luxury to earn the right to live in poverty.  On the other hand, if people understand they live in a snowglobe, it points to an all powerful Creator. That all powerful Creator pretty much rules out global warming completely. Once someone is open to an all powerful being who rules the universe... well there's only One who fits the bill and that's Jesus Christ. Not to mention, by the way, that faith in Him leads to a relationship with Him on a personal level every day.  Once people realize they are not irrelevant, insignificant, and this world is not an accident; suddenly a man becomes free. If a man has faith in Christ, then He has the power of God behind Him. God grants us the gift of freedom and strips us of our fear; something power-hungry people hate more than anything else.  It's all about your place in the world.

theworldisflat,3e0z5v,SwedishCommie,4,Tue Jul 21 04:41:00 2015 UTC,"Depends on the satellite.  Most of the really good photos are actually stitched together from multiple smaller photos, since the satellites are typically too low, and the cameras too narrow, to get the entire earth in one shot.  This particular image is actually 3 different ones put together.  This satellite, however, is about a million miles away, and each shot was of the full earth.  Additionally (and more relevant to this particular picture), most pictures that are useful for PR purposes, like the image there, have some unique things about them.  Every camera works on the same principal, expose a light sensitive surface toward your target for some amount of time, and save the result.  Too short an exposure, and the subject appears dim and indistinct.  Too long an exposure and your subject can appear washed out and, more likely, blurred.  So most of the photos have just enough exposure to get the earth and nothing else.  The earth is simply reflecting so much more light than the surrounding stars that there isn't enough exposure time for their light to be significantly recorded."

When the ISS passes over at certain times, it is actually incredibly bright because the sunlight reflects off of it. With amateur radio, you don't actually need to be able to see the light reflecting off of it though so you have even more good passes.  You want a pass that's going to have a maximum elevation of greater than 45 degrees above the horizon.  I use this antenna which is directional so it's fantastic for receiving satellite signals, but it's actually possible to get a weak signal using the built-in antenna on a handheld radio."

theworldisflat,3dyf9j,TheUnmashedPotato,6,Mon Jul 20 15:35:22 2015 UTC,"Tidal locking. The gravitational interaction of the moon and earth keeps it facing our direction. It's an effect that's always present between large orbiting bodies, but it's not always strong enough to keep a 1:1 tidal lock.  With Mercury the interplay between the orbital/rotational speeds and tidal forces between it and the Sun have ended up stabilizing a 3:2 resonance instead of a 1:1 - it rotates three times every two orbits around the Sun. Other planets/moons don't have noticeable tidal locking at all because the effect is too small.  EDIT: I'm now autobanned from posting for being subscribed to /r/TopMindsofReddit. Real great echo chamber you've got here, mods. How's your pretense of being open to honest intellectual discussion going?"

All it took was an understanding of simple geometry.  Go practice it yourself.  Team up with a buddy and see what angle the sun is at on a particular time for the both of use.  Use that number to predict the estimated circumference of the earth.  Not to mention your balloons would have to get extremely high for you to see the earth is in fact not flat.  But the lack on continents or a ring of Antarctica around the whole view would be able to show you that your claim is false way earlier into the process.

theworldisflat,3dytxy,OurJesuitPaymasters,3,Mon Jul 20 17:19:05 2015 UTC,"So the basis for the observation of ""no curvature"" is a camera still within the stratosphere looking straight out at this layer.  You cant distinguish the surface of the planet through the combination of haze, clouds, and air density.  While the math says you can see the curve of the Earth starting at about 35000ft, it also is not including the atmosphere and clouds that can (and in this case, did) obscure the view.  You're basically looking for a pronounced curve of the layer of ozone while still being within it and claiming it appearing straight is proof the earth is flat.  Funny thing about this though, if you compress it only horizontally, it will exaggerate any slight curve that might exist, but if its indeed straight, would still be so.  In this case, you can see the curve. See here from a screengrab of your video.  You can reproduce this yourself."

theworldisflat,3dytxy,SituationGang,5,Mon Jul 20 23:09:32 2015 UTC,"That is a fairly desperate denial on your part.    I dont even have to try to reinforce the curvature, Im tracing the horizon after horizontally compressing a screen shot.  The compression can only magnify what already exists, it cannot create a curve from a flat plane.  The contour ""filter"" only traces existing contour, which really shows how not flat (curved) it is.  The curve is visible.  The point stands for itself, the method is logical, accurate, and reproducible.  Again, I'm not sure why you're arguing this.  Your own belief of the flat earth model being a flat disc with an ice ring edge, as viewed from high altitude looking down, would still make the horizon appear to be CURVED.

I don't necessarily correlate their fake moon landings and space stations and zero g plane ""space station interviews"" to flat earth proof, but it does raise and endless stream of questions about the validity of a round earth. All the pictures, math about orbiting earth and escape velocity, astronomy, physics, etc. become suspect.  So if we invalidate all evidence of a round earth by NASA, which I personally think is a good idea, we're right back to the first half of the 1900's where people were actively trying to prove that the earth is either round or flat, hence boards like this have become relevant. The only problem is presently, because of NASA and their fancy CGI and giant pools, flat earth has an up hill battle where it won't even for a second be considered by agencies with the capitol/scientific minds to explore the possibility. Minus NASA, all evidence of a round earth doesn't look much better than what we have for a flat earth. It turns into another bedford level experiment, which after reading about the events surrounding it, basically sounded like this"

Case closed!"" Unfortunately, I think that those kinds of people are shouting so loud they are drowning out the reasonable people who are attempting to debunk it very thoroughly. In addition to the people shouting incorrect shit loudly, you've got so many differences between details related to the different flat earth ideas. One guy said it has a dome, another guy said it doesn't. Because they can't come to an agreement, it makes the flat earth theory seem invalid. I think as the flat earth theory becomes more widespread, we should expect to see less variance in the details between different flat earth models."

Hopefully we can focus on the shape of the earth only, because otherwise it might just be dismissed as a joke by people who might otherwise want to investigate it.  I think attempts at ""debunking"" both the flat and round earth theories are good because it forces a re-examination of previously held facts. I mean, think about how many old medical practices, practices that many doctors believed to be correct, have changed because people decided to push their knowledge further and be more inquisitive.

theworldisflat,3dtj9m,OftenStupid,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:11:30 2015 UTC,"I think I hear it, its saying 'Sublimator'.  ...the cooling system consists of a network of small diameter water circulation tubes that are held close to the body by a Spandex® body suit. Heat released by the astronaut’s body movements is transferred to the water where it is carried to a refrigeration unit in the suit's backpack. The water runs across a porous metal plate that is exposed to the vacuum of outer space on the other side. Small amounts of water pass through the pores where it freezes on the outside of the plate. As additional heated water runs across the plate, the heat is absorbed by the aluminum and is conducted to the exposed side. There the ice begins to sublimate, or turn directly into water vapor and disperses in space. Sublimation is a cooling process. Additional water passes through the pores, and freezes as before. Consequently, the water flowing across the plate has been cooled again and is used to recirculate through the suit to absorb more heat."

However, even on a globe, that would be impossible to see.  There recently was a photo taken from the shores of Lake Michigan in the state of Michigan.  It was of the Chicago skyline 59 miles away.  Here's the clip: https://youtu.be/9EiplfKXvUk.  Even the newscaster explains the photo is impossible and that what we are seeing is a mirage.  Do you believe that?"
theworldisflat,3dpfhk,Richie112663,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:12:57 2015 UTC,"As someone who is skeptical that the earth is indeed round, the fact that there are sunsets and sunrises where the sun disappears below the horizon is what keeps me from believing 100% that the earth is flat.  I think so much of why people believe the earth is flat (or even entertain the idea like me) is because because they trust what they see and can be proven by anyone, not just the misinformation some corrupt gov't sponsored ""space"" agency provides. (FYI I'm about as normal a.k.a. non-religious as you can get so Jesus n' friends aren't influencing my opinion)  And that's where, speaking for myself, visual proof conflicts. Every single object I've ever observed, both in real life and in photos and videos, gets progressively smaller and doesn't disappear behind the horizon. Everything- except the sun.  I've tried myself, with my zero science expertise, to think about how a sun could rise and set assuming a flat earth, and I can come up with some(two) feeble propositions:   As the sun moves away, it's simultaneously magnified by the atmosphere. A scientist who believes the earth is round might not consider this- they commonly say that even though the sun and moon look larger at the horizon, they are actually the same size. I think they're right, they are the same size visually, but if the earth had no atmosphere, the sun would get smaller as it neared the horizon. The actual sun rise and sun set, where it slowly sinks into the ground, are caused by atmospheric voodoo. Yup, that's as good as I can explain it. Well, maybe I could through out terms like ""superior mirage"" and link to this site, but I think even in that case the sun's shape would melt down into the horizon, looking like it was almost wearing a dress as opposed to maintaining its shape.   All in all, we really don't have any other reference for something like the sun, so we can't say. If it could be studied without previous scientific bias (the earth is round) or religious gooberness maybe it could be explained, and than once and for all the earth's shape will be known without photographs from fake space missions, but through real science (whatever the hell that is considering many times test results are bought and decided by corporations)."
theworldisflat,3dpfhk,anabolicbob,0,Sun Jul 19 08:50:52 2015 UTC,"Thanks for this. That could be a possibility that the sun gets magnified due to the atmosphere. I'm in the exact position as you wrt flat earth. I know without a doubt that NASA isnt telling us the truth. That much im certain.  I just had another thought. In the globe earth model, why don't we see rockets/aircraft's sink below the horizon as they move farther from the observer, provided, they keep a low/steady altitude."

theworldisflat,3dgrrm,metabolix,0,Sat Jul 18 03:50:52 2015 UTC,Yes of course. They don't look one bit that they are moving at 7 km/second. I get that space is a vacuum and hence no air resistance and such. But you can easily tell when something is in motion or falling at a very very high speed (like they are at the ISS).

I disagree with that idea as well. Being sure about whatever is on the other side isn't relevant to being sure that the earth is not a spinning ball. Not being able to adequately explain the black shadow that causes the moon phases doesn't mean the earth is a ball. It just means we have to, at this point, say ""I don't know.""

A benevolent, all-loving, perfect, omnipotent being shouldn't be making other beings suffer; surely he should move past it? Your perfect god, who you blindly worship, is holding the world hostage with threats of disease, famine, and ultimately pain and death, because we're all sinners. He's saying ""worship me or suffer"". Maybe tyrants throughout history making people bow down to them, under threat of torture or death, were doing the right thing, they were certainly doing the same thing as your god. Maybe all the murderers and rapists were doing the right thing too; your god clearly wants to inflict pain on the world, so those terrible people were actually just carrying out your god's will!

What made you think there was anything hard to explain here? I'm actually more interested in how you think it works.   how is it that they are the same size?   Coincidence. They're not exactly the same apparent size, just close.  Here's one for you - why does what stars are visible in the sky depend on where I am on the planet? Why can't I see Polaris in Australia?   EDIT: If your second question was insinuating that the sun should appear larger than the moon, it's simply that the sun is both larger and farther away. The apparent sizes being close is the coincidence, and the distance difference explains how the sun can be much larger than the moon and yet not appear that way from earth."

We can understand how fingers work and how the moon moves and what it's made of and how solar systems form without there being anything special about the moon, our star or your fingers. It just is.

The starmap hemisphere shown at 4:55 doesn't work either. The constellations you see in the sky should depend on where you are! If you actually look at the night sky from different places, you find that anywhere near the borders of that plane you can look south/out and see the south celestial pole, and near the center of that plane you can't see it at all! This animation also shows Polaris at the center of this hemisphere, yet Polaris isn't in the sky at all when you're in the regions near the border of the plane (the south). If this animation were right you should see all the same constellations from anywhere.   I suspect that what's shown is actually just the northern celestial hemisphere, and the southern one is completely missing. Where is it?

This ends up being a result of mapping a round Earth to a flat one. Just like you warp a round Earth into a flat one, you distort straight lines of sight into curved ones through the mapping. You also map the south celestial pole onto a circle all around the map - which is what your figure shows. Just like the south geographic pole is mapped to the circular rim of the flat Earth.  The problem with this mapping is that it wreaks havok with distance and direction for locations near the south geographic/celestial poles. It's not an especially useful mapping. People who support a flat Earth can pretend the problem this creates at the south geographic pole is all lies and conspiracy and that there is no south pole, but you don't have to go all the way to Antarctica to see the same problem in the sky.

Either:  -The footage wasn't taken in at Mcmurdo station (or it was but the station isn't actually in Antarctica)  -It was fake (in which case it's better than most Hollywood CG)  -The earth is round  If it could be proved beyond all doubt that the earth is round or flat, great, but until then I'm not a ""flat earther"" or ""round eather.""

It barely looks that way on first quarter, the shadow curve doesn't match how small it's claimed to be.  Last first quarter before full moon I also noticed for the first time that the angle of shadow on the Moon did not seem to match up with the angle of setting sun.  It was as if the sun should've been tilted 10-20 degrees higher in the sky.  I was in a park, and sphere atop a sculpture was also lit by setting sun with significantly different angle of shadow.  Also more of it's surface in sunlight and the moon was still tilted back in the sky slightly east, so the perspective was bizarre."

theworldisflat,3d452o,TheWalruss,-1,Mon Jul 13 11:07:55 2015 UTC,"The anti-crepuscular rays appear to emerge or converge from a vanishing point, occurring opposite sunset, and the ray edges are more diffuse or less defined than crepuscular.  That says to me they are originating from a long distance, at the vanishing point, and likely are reflected rays within the atmosphere, edge on, as the sun is setting and sending beams through the long dimension of atmosphere.  These are the reflected photons coming back at angles nearly straight back to the sun.  With great enough depth edge on through the atmosphere, and little cloud interference, they collect enough along the same paths and can emerge from a vanishing point on the horizon to a viewer further away.  IMO they are good evidence of Flat Earth because of this, because a great depth of atmosphere is reflecting the sun back along the same dimension.  On a curved Earth, the atmosphere depth would quickly thin out and disappear along this plane of sunlight shining into the atmosphere edge on.  Plus combining the fact that crepuscular rays often show themselves pointing downward, not just outward from a vanishing point at the sun, but downward to the ground as shorter rays, this says the sun is not very high above a Flat surface.  So both sets of rays prove Flat Earth."
theworldisflat,3d452o,jtcribbs,2,Mon Jul 13 16:22:42 2015 UTC,Any demonstrable math or other reference to back up your conjecture here?  Why don't we see a sunset behave as it would if the Earth were flat?
theworldisflat,3d452o,DethFiesta,0,Mon Jul 13 16:28:34 2015 UTC,"Sure, they are called Fresnel equations and used in gas interfaces, like gas lasers.  That website link doesn't demonstrate him plugging in the known refractive indices for the atmosphere at different altitudes, so he has no proof this sun distortion looks like this.  Plus if the sun was refracting through a curved atmosphere, how would his calculations come out for the variable angle of incidence?  There's no apparent distortion of the sun, just scattering and mirages along thermal distortions at ground level.  Refraction is not very noticeable phenomenon in the atmosphere"
theworldisflat,3d452o,jtcribbs,3,Mon Jul 13 17:09:07 2015 UTC,"Fresnel equations are used for light passing through surfaces, not through volumes.  The atmosphere is not a planar interface.  Did you get that from Dubay?  As we've seen before, that guy is not at all reliable.  And you are correct that Mr. Young did not plug in the refractive indices, but he certainly accounted for them.  And as you say, they don't matter much anyway.  ""Although the details of the mirages in this huge blank strip would depend on the density structure of the flat atmosphere, Newton's proof mentioned above guarantees that all sunsets in the flat-Earth model must have exactly this bizarre appearance. In particular, the enormous elevation of the false horizon depends only on the refractive index of air at the observer — a quantity known to many decimal places from laboratory measurements.""  Here is his approximation of the refraction on a flat Earth:  r  =  ( n − 1) tan z0 .   ""It's just proportional to the refractivity at the observer, and the tangent of the apparent (refracted) zenith distance.""  Because refractivity at the observer will vary according to temperature, moisture, and other factors his equation is left with only this variable left to define.  But regardless, the effect that would be seen would always be some amount miraged area between a false horizon and the astronomical horizon and a flattened sun.  So, as you can see, he did account for the refraction and provided only an approximate amount of miraged area that would be seen since the actual amount of miraged area would depend on conditions at the observer.  You are correct that refraction is not particularly noticeable -- in this case, the Flat Earth sunset (observed nowhere on Earth) will demonstrate a false apparent horizon, flattened sun, and miraged area regardless of the amount of refraction.  Solid proof that the Earth is not flat.  Unless you can prove Newton's ""Opticks"" were incorrect."
theworldisflat,3d452o,DethFiesta,0,Mon Jul 13 20:22:02 2015 UTC,"Fresnel equations are applied to gas-liquid and gas-solid interfaces.  The anti-crepuscular reflection is likely originating from water vapor droplets suspended in the atmosphere, thus gas-liquid reflection.  I don't get material from Dubay, got kicked off his board awhile back as everyone sees now he's paranoid."
theworldisflat,3d452o,jtcribbs,0,Mon Jul 13 23:21:30 2015 UTC,"That says to me they are originating from a long distance   That's what the OP was saying, isn't it? That this suggests that the Sun is far away?   crepuscular rays often show themselves pointing downward, not just outward from a vanishing point at the sun, but downward to the ground as shorter rays, this says the sun is not very high above a Flat surface.   EDIT: How can the anti-crepuscular rays imply a far Sun and the crepuscular rays imply a near Sun? What makes you think that both aren't accounted for by the same explanation - nearly-parallel rays appearing to converge at a distant vanishing point due to perspective?"
theworldisflat,3d452o,BoojumG,-1,Mon Jul 13 18:57:44 2015 UTC,"The anti-crepuscular rays are originating from a long distance within the long plane of atmosphere of Flat Earth...as reflected rays running at an angle directly back towards the sun.  In other words, sun beam enters atmosphere, photons run a long distance along Flat Earth atmosphere, then reflect directly back nearly along their original path.  And the perspective to witness this is as the sun is setting in one locale and looking 180 from that setting sun, the anti-crepuscular rays are emerging from tha horizon vanishing point, coming from many long distances where they reflected back towards you.    A Globe Earth would not have enough depth edge on into the atmosphere to gather enough reflected rays running nearly parallel together back towards the sun."
theworldisflat,3d452o,jtcribbs,2,Mon Jul 13 19:23:22 2015 UTC,"A Globe Earth would not have enough depth edge on into the atmosphere to gather enough reflected rays running nearly parallel together back towards the sun.   But what if it's a really big globe? A big enough globe would still work, wouldn't it? Do you have numbers to show that the Earth is not large enough to support this?  If you say something is ""not enough"" you have to be making quantitative comparisons between something, or you're just assuming your conclusion with no evidence. How do you know it's ""not enough""?  How much edge-on depth of atmosphere is ""enough""? If you don't know, then how did you reach a conclusion already?"
theworldisflat,3d452o,BoojumG,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:28:29 2015 UTC,"Well if you travelled on a tangential path through the atmosphere, you'd be at 11 miles high after 300 miles forward motion, that's how quick it should curve off.  So not a lot of linear feet of reflection there, maybe a good 150 miles at most.  On Flat Earth, this would be vastly farther, certainly 10 times that..."
theworldisflat,3d452o,jtcribbs,2,Mon Jul 13 19:46:40 2015 UTC,"But even assuming all the numbers you've given so far are correct, what made you think that 150 miles is not enough?  EDIT: I also did some quick checking and you made one mistake already, even without the glaring issue of how you decided 150 miles isn't enough. You're right that a vantage point 11 miles high has a horizon at 300 miles distance, but that means that a ray going tangential to the surface of the Earth goes through 600 miles of atmosphere at 11 miles altitude or lower (300 heading in, and 300 heading back out). So the part of the rays below 11 miles altitude that are in front of an observer near the surface of the Earth looking away from the Sun is 300 miles, not 150.  But again, even more importantly, what made you think 150 miles is not enough?"
theworldisflat,3d452o,BoojumG,-1,Mon Jul 13 20:28:35 2015 UTC,"Basically when you stand looking at about 10 to 20 degrees above the horizon you're staring into a depth of 150 miles or so, on par with a maximal depth that could even build up these reflected rays (on a curved Earth), as they reflect off tiny water vapor droplets and move through a relatively clear sky back towards you.  But staring into that depth above the horizon there's no indication any originate from that angle as well.  Anti-crepuscular only originate from the vanishing point, indicating it likely takes an immense distance to build up enough density of these rays, also the reason they are rare...need a good mix of tiny droplets for reflection and a long clear path length to move back again...probably this 1500 mile distance.  If they could build up in 150 mile path on Globe Earth, so many different angles of rays would emanate along the horizon rather like an ""anti-glo"" or ""anti-sunset"" opposite the actual sunset.  But the fact they are rays from a vanishing point means that have been traveling along, nearly inline across many points of origin, back into a very large depth, then the ray emerges from a vanishing point to a viewer..."
theworldisflat,3d452o,jtcribbs,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:34:30 2015 UTC,"But staring into that depth above the horizon there's no indication any originate from that angle as well.   I don't understand this statement. Please be more explicit in what you're claiming and how it relates to the argument. I'm getting lost in all the unclear ""that"" references and what you think the claim implies.   probably this 1500 mile distance.   Where did you get this number?   If they could build up in 150 mile path on Globe Earth   But you can have a 300 mile path in front of you below 11 miles altitude on Globe Earth. The ""if"" is an actuality.   back into a very large depth   How large? This is all still the same question. How did you determine how much depth is enough?  TL;DR How did you decide how much distance is needed for a significant ""vanishing point"" perspective effect?"

Shills love the inclusion of 'ad hominem attacks.' It's like I'm talking to a shill bot at times.   With regards to the South Celestial Pole, it is related to the Law of Perspective. Why is it that you can see Polaris, Ursa Major/Minor and other Northern constellations from every point on Earth all the way to the Southern Tropic of Capricorn?   Say 'because science' one more time..."
theworldisflat,3d1jck,DethFiesta,7,Mon Jul 13 14:48:32 2015 UTC,"Also, everyone in the Southern Hemisphere sees the South Celestial pole, right?  The South Celestial Pole is in the constellation Octans.  Well how is that possible when, according to your map, people in Chile, South Africa, and Australia would all see the pole looking south, and yet they would all be facing a different direction.  Flat Earth is so obviously wrong, unless you know, we all have eyes in the back of our heads and that is being kept secret by shills and masons."
theworldisflat,3d1jck,DethFiesta,3,Mon Jul 13 17:21:14 2015 UTC,"LOL, say ""shill"" and ""masons"" one more time.  Your attempt at explanation proves how little you know about this topic.  I could elaborate, but /u/KingKha has already demolished your argument."
theworldisflat,3d1jck,OurJesuitPaymasters,-2,Mon Jul 13 20:54:27 2015 UTC,I show him anomalies of space walk EVA's and brushed it off and referred me to a blog post from Discover magazine. Yeah. demolished.
theworldisflat,3d1jck,DethFiesta,3,Mon Jul 13 20:33:28 2015 UTC,It entirely depends on the content of the Discover magazine blog post.  And what does that have to do with the Round Earth?  The Earth's roundness has been known for millenia before NASA.  Why don't you tell me how people everywhere in the Southern Hemisphere can see Octans despite facing opposite directions?
theworldisflat,3d1jck,KingKha,0,Mon Jul 13 21:08:01 2015 UTC,"Why can't you see them from any point south of the tropic? Surely if the world is covered by a dome, the entire dome should be visible from any point on the surface, right?"

Here's a few questions for you.    Why is it that most astronauts seem to be masons?  Why is it that the apollo moon mission patches have a lot of occult symbology to it? It's a scientific exploration mission and they're putting occult symbols on their mission patch?  How did an occultist by the name of Jack Parsons, found JPL? Odd. Did you realize that the Big Bang Theory was created by a Catholic priest?  Why is it that to this day, no private citizen has been in low earth orbit still?  Why is it that there are a number of anomalies during spacewalks of what looks to be air bubbles coming out of space suits during EVA's?  When I google images of Earth, I only see composites/CGI.  When I google images of satellites in space I see even more illustrations. Gee golly I thought we had tens of thousands of satellites in space but see a very small number of actual images of satellites in space, the most notable being the Hubble telescope.  Why do I see more images of 'deep space' more so than I see images of the actual Earth? The most realistic photo of a ball shape Earth is from the Apollo missions. To this day, 40+ years after, that image is still being used in textbooks. Go figure."

Can you explain why? It's easy on a globe Earth, the Earth gets in the way. But why shouldn't you be able to see Polaris, which would literally be above the center of the flat Earth, from every point?   Why is it that most astronauts seem to be masons? Why is it that the apollo moon mission patches have a lot of occult symbology to it? It's a scientific exploration mission and they're putting occult symbols on their mission patch? How did an occultist by the name of Jack Parsons, found JPL? Odd.   What's the point? Who they are as people shouldn't matter as much as what they've done.   Did you realize that the Big Bang Theory was created by a Catholic priest?   Yes, a Belgian by the name of George Lemaitre. What's your point?   Why is it that to this day, no private citizen has been in low earth orbit still?   Obviously not true: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_tourism#List_of_flown_space_tourists   Why is it that there are a number of anomalies during spacewalks of what looks to be air bubbles coming out of space suits during EVA's?   Any footage of air bubbles?   When I google images of Earth, I only see composites/CGI.   You see composites from LEO because the earth is really big, so cameras don't capture it all in one shot. Composites are stitched together from multiple shots. Once you get further out, you can see the entire earth in one picture: Here's 10 such pictures.   When I google images of satellites in space I see even more illustrations. Gee golly I thought we had tens of thousands of satellites in space but see a very small number of actual images of satellites in space, the most notable being the Hubble telescope.   You can trivially look up into the sky and see satellites. There are even websites that tell you where to look: http://www.heavens-above.com/   Why do I see more images of 'deep space' more so than I see images of the actual Earth? The most realistic photo of a ball shape Earth is from the Apollo missions. To this day, 40+ years after, that image is still being used in textbooks. Go figure.   It's a very famous picture.

You're almost certainly going to dismiss any provided source because they are a shill, government, bought and paid for, free masons etc. so the problem isn't that there are no sources but that you won't except any source but what you like."

theworldisflat,3d1jck,OurJesuitPaymasters,4,Sat Jul 18 03:33:59 2015 UTC,"I've noticed a trend on reddit front page they are pushing images of the 'globe' Earth but attempting to make more realistic CGI composites at this time.   https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/3cfm8x/window_on_the_world_scott_kelly_iss/  Unfortunate that most individuals don't realize they're using fish eye lens to distort image of the Earth, or potentially fake Earth based on the image shown above in the reddit thread."

No images of the continents standing altogether on a flat plane. Just launch a balloon with a camera on it in the higher atmosphere, and take me once for all a photo showing a flat Earth (it's really easy to do so), and I'll be convinced."
theworldisflat,3d1jck,jtcribbs,-3,Mon Jul 13 08:26:04 2015 UTC,"How would there ever be a total Flat Earth image if we can only achieve 20 - 50 mile altitudes with rockets or weather balloons, where the atmosphere runs out?  That only puts the horizon out for imagery at hundreds of miles in radius...when the disk is likely a 12,000 mile radius."

You should see large chunks of landmasses spreading without curvature. You should see something observable. We have the technology to manipulate the genes of living beings. We have the technology to make atomic bombs. We have the technology to make internet possible. Don't tell me we are unable to take such a photograph."
theworldisflat,3d1jck,N546RV,-1,Mon Jul 13 17:39:15 2015 UTC,"The rest of FE groups across the Net reach hundreds and thousands of members now   I'm going to assume that you meant to type hundreds of thousands. I make this assumption solely to give you the benefit of the doubt in what I'm about to say.  The current human population is estimated to seven billion. To again be favorable to your position, I'm going to round ""hundreds of thousands"" up to 1 million. Using those numbers, your FE group members constitute 0.01% of the world population.  But that's kind of unfair. The vast majority of the population, living in undeveloped nations, isn't capable of being a member of an online FE group, so using the entire human population is really skewing things. I can't find any conclusive numbers, but a generic consensus from random Google results seems to think that the population of developed nations is around 1.3 billion. For the purposes of this discussion, I'm going to conflate ""lives in a developed nation"" with ""has internet access and thus could potentially be a member of an online FE group.""  Using those numbers, your 1 million online FE followers constitute 0.07% of people with internet access.  Less than 1/10th of a percent.  I'm not going to go personal here and call anyone a nutjob, but you are most definitely in the vast, vast, vast, vast minority of humans. ""Rare"" is a perfectly accurate term."
theworldisflat,3cyi8h,epistemologymatters,4,Sat Jul 11 22:54:12 2015 UTC,"I think there are true believers, but I would like to pose a relevant question to /u/SquareHimself or any other believer: Is there any kind of personal experience that would change your view on the flat earth hypothesis? Let me explain myself a bit: There are several experiences you could have that should definitely make the flat earth hypothesis really improbable (not to say plainly impossible) in your own mind. Allow me to cite some specific examples: *Taking a plane from Johannesburg to Perth costing $857.140 and counting the duration of the flight to be 9 hours *Going to Chile and then to South Africa and then to Australia and watching the night sky revolving around Sigma Octantis *Buying a compass, an astrolabe, or whatever other tool that would definitely show your direction in the sea, boarding a ship from, say, Argentina that headed south and reaching a point after the Antarctic Circle in the correct days of the years where you would be witnessing with your own senses a 24-hour day  I am not asking if you believe that any of these are possible, or if other people's experiences count for you. My question is hypothetical: Is there any experience that YOU could have that would change your view on the subject? Or even then you would not believe in your own eyes?"
theworldisflat,3cyi8h,jimbokz,2,Tue Jul 14 07:18:55 2015 UTC,"Sure. I wouldn't deny my own experience. I was reluctant at first to even consider the flat earth, much less adopt it; yet, clearly I have. It's going to be even more difficult to persuade me away from, but there are certainly some clear cut cases that would do so if they were a reality."
theworldisflat,3cyi8h,SquareHimself,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:49:27 2015 UTC,What evidence would be sufficient to falsify your position that the earth is flat?

Attach a downward facing GoPro, a front facing non-fisheye lens camera, and an altimeter.  This should do the trick. We should get a beautiful shot of Antarctica if the world is a ball. If not, we should get a shot of the edge."
theworldisflat,3cyi8h,trollfessor,4,Tue Jul 14 14:38:24 2015 UTC,"Amazingly enough, something like this has already been done, perhaps this exact thing.  A friend of mine was one of the people who worked on the project.    It was done in connection with some scientific project, I think it was something about studying the atmosphere, but I'm not sure.    In any event, I will ask him about it (if he's in town now, the guy travels all over the world filming stuff) and hopefully come back here with a link."
theworldisflat,3cyi8h,SquareHimself,2,Tue Jul 14 15:28:12 2015 UTC,Sounds good. Let's see it.
theworldisflat,3cyi8h,trollfessor,3,Tue Jul 14 15:39:48 2015 UTC,The guy went to the McMurto (spell?) research station at the south pole for the filming.  Surely there is something online about it.  This was something done by NASA and some universities just a few years ago.

theworldisflat,3cyi8h,jtcribbs,5,Tue Jul 14 14:40:54 2015 UTC,"Yes, there are definitely some true believers.  I have no doubt that the moderator is one.  I think that some folks who are motivated by a Biblical Literalist perspective are completely earnest in their belief that the world is flat.  Maintaining this earnestness does involve adopting many kooky beliefs (like the evil global conspiracy nonsense) but this is no surprise.  However, those who are basing their belief on science I am not so sure about.  I believe that they, in their heart of hearts, know that they are wrong as the evidence against the Flat Earth is far too overwhelming and they know it.  So what explains their continued profession of belief in a Flat Earth?    Robert Cialdini has an incredible book called Influence: Science and Practice that details all sorts of ways that people are influenced and how powerful some psychological and social psychological phenomena can be.  One of these is the desire for consistency.  Basically, once someone like /u/jtcribbs has declared loudly, publicly, and repeatedly that the world is flat, NASA is fake, and his opponents are shills there is literally no way to get him to admit otherwise.  No amount of evidence will ever elicit an admission of being wrong from someone like this.  Most folks who profess belief in the Flat Earth on this sub are psychologically bound to continue to do this even if they secretly know it is wrong because they don't want to endure the psychological pain of admitting they were wrong and having to be inconsistent in their pronouncements on the issue.  Simple as that."
theworldisflat,3cyi8h,DethFiesta,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:14:23 2015 UTC,Thank you!
theworldisflat,3cyi8h,jtcribbs,-3,Mon Jul 13 14:29:13 2015 UTC,"And yet, Flat Earthers have already considered both sides, and considered new FET ideas, typically staying up late many nights of study, all to finally come around to admitting they were wrong on Globe Earth for their whole life...  So they've already been through the ""I was WRONG"" process...what makes you think they can't go back?  Have you ever made the Sokratean Realization?  ""I know that I know nothing worth knowing""..."
theworldisflat,3cyi8h,DethFiesta,7,Sun Jul 12 18:19:03 2015 UTC,"I've never seen that quote written in the way you laid it out.  In English language text Socrates is usually quoted as having said ""All I know is that I know nothing"" or something similar.  This statement is generally considered ill-quoted because Plato's formulation of this saying in both the Apology and in Meno is considerably different.  Regardless, no philosopher takes this argument seriously as a statement on the unknowability of things.    The fact of the matter is that, before finding Flat Earth ideas, you never thought much about the Earth being round and you certainly never made loud, public pronouncements of it being Round so there is no psychological pain involved in rejecting the Round Earth.  But by adopting a Flat Earth you got the thrill of having some kind of esoteric, secret knowledge.  You felt intellectually superior for discovering something that 99.9% of people were too dumb or brainwashed to know about.  But not you!  You were one of the select, the elite with real insight into the mass deception and bumblings of science.  Now that you have shouted about this topic from the rooftops, something you never did with the Round Earth, declaring yourself wrong on the subject is out the question.  You never had an emotional attachment to a Round Earth by being a public partisan in favor of it and you left your belief in it behind willingly.  You are now a partisan for the Flat Earth though and are being forced to confront the idea by others who are able to demonstrate why your arguments don't work.  The first ""I was WRONG"" was not painful, it was a thrill.  This ""I was WRONG"" is indeed painful and embarassing -- so you won't let it happen.  This is why you can't face the facts squarely.  This is why you rely on conspiracy theories rather than provable science.    Let's look at a few examples:  Here you fail to acknowledge or even discuss the lengthening and shortening of days in the Southern Hemisphere though you admit this makes sense in the North.  Even the smallest bit of effort on your part would demonstrate that yes, the same phenomenon is true in the South.  You fail to discuss Lunar eclipses.  You completely failed to acknowledge that there is a South Celestial pole that is seen by, literally, hundreds of millions of people every night.  You received an excellent response to your first ""thought experiment"" and then in your 2nd one you claim you received no answer at all (""no answer comes the response..."").  Why is that?  Why would you out and out lie like that?  Because you can't admit the simple truth that you have been wrong.  And I understand that.  Few people can once they've gone on the record in such a hardcore manner."
theworldisflat,3cyi8h,OurJesuitPaymasters,-4,Sun Jul 12 18:46:12 2015 UTC,"Wow, so you were there over my shoulder and in my mind through 41 years of my upbringing on this Earth?  How do you magically do that?  Guess I have a guardian angel now...  I guess all these other folks from all walks of life are just now finding this new ""thrill"" like me, and it couldn't possibly be from the weariness of years and decades of being fed so much bullshit.  Nope, couldn't be that... https://youtu.be/lxo1YxvO7TU"
theworldisflat,3cyi8h,DethFiesta,7,Sun Jul 12 19:53:12 2015 UTC,"The problem is that what you think is bullshit isn't.  And yes, you get a thrill from having some super-secret knowledge and being smarter than all the world's scientists despite having no training in the relevant fields.  I can't read your mind, but I have trouble understanding how a person who is clearly of average-or-greater intelligence can simply fail to see how obvious things, like the South Celestial Pole, makes their entire FE worldview obviously horseshit.  The only thing I can come up with is a psychological refusal to even hear the plain-as-day evidence.  I'm being generous to you.  Most folks would just say you are stupid or crazy.  I don't think you are stupid or crazy, just psychologically defending yourself from embarrassment and pain."

However, perhaps in that culture questioning your religion is not possible or looked upon favorably?  I don't know.  If what you are implying by questioning me is that I simply adopted my faith because I grew up with it (and thus did not choose it or think for myself) then that would be incorrect.  As I've gotten older I've found plenty of things that I agree/disagree with when it comes to the Catholic church.

Why are we, as intelligent beings, wasting resources that could be devoted to reaching the world with the gospel so that Christ can return?  Is not the salvation of other people more important? Do you believe God has forsaken us and that we will go extinct? Do you not believe that He's coming back soon to take us away from here? What exactly is the purpose and what exactly could I possibly be missing out on in a flat world other than the idolatrous fantasies of the Chaldeans?  In fact, the simple understanding that our world is flat and domed brings the gospel much light and brings us a shield of faith. We know there are no aliens, therefor Satan couldn't pretend to be one. We know that the dome is the mercy seat upon which the Shekinah glory sits... and that none can see the glory of God and not perish. We know now that the dome is our protection from His presence, and at the time of the end the veil will rent in twain and all shall see Him. The Heavens shall disappear with a shout!

After this, I began to question my views on evolution and came to the conclusion that the evidence weighs heavily on the other side. The more I looked into the validity of the scriptures, the more they made sense. Science supports the flood, the exodus, intelligent creation, history, and more.  That said, [the real kicker is prophecy]. We've all heard the popular theories that are out there, but not too many of us have heard the truths that the reformers were aware of. The real story has been swept under the rug and suppressed. Furthermore, once you become familiar with the story you will realize even more than the entire book is prophecy. It's just plain amazing.  There is plenty of evidence for any seeking person to logically reach the same conclusion and many paths to do it. The Lord truly appeals to our intellect as much as Christ appeals to our hearts. The scriptures appear to the natural man as foolishness, but upon deeper review you will find treasures that reveal an intelligence beyond ourselves. It's in the details.  Only the Holy Spirit can anoint our eyes to see and we cannot rely upon our own understanding to ever hope to understand the scriptures. He reveals the truths to those who come to Him like children, not to learned men who approach them with pride.  If you've never really read the scriptures... well, you've only got one short life anyways, right? You're missing out on something huge. I would highly recommend starting in the book of John, then perhaps doing a study of Daniel. Ask the Lord to show you Himself and be honest that you don't believe.

It seems, after a quick Google search that Walter Veith may be deluded (not in the clinical sense, but in the sense that he believes in things that are not true). There are many people who believe that the holocaust never happened, that evil reptilian aliens have infiltrated our government, that the mood landing was a hoax, folks believe the government is spraying mind-control chemicals from planes, that 9/11 was a plot orchestrated by the U.S. Government, etc. These people can all make a case compelling enough to convince others that what they are saying is right, but it seems we would need something more to say it is true, no?

I've brought this up before. Their model makes real, testable predictions about distances between points on the globe. These distances are measured daily in practical terms, and so the predictions are tested multiple times daily. Therefore confirming one model over another should be a simple matter, and accepting or refusing a model should be a simple matter of seeing whether it is consonant with what the experiments show.  Essentially this whole discussion can be boiled down to the fact that the only isometries of the sphere map the sphere to other spheres. Mappings from the sphere to the plane do not preserve distance. Therefore any given planar map will make predictions of distances at odds with the spherical model."

Here is what destroys your little myth - NASA's finding can, and have been, replicated. During July of 1969, as Aldrin and Armstrong prepared to descend to the lunar surface, the Soviet's Luna 15 was already in orbit. It was able to image the surface, but crashed during descent. However - the data returned by Luna showed an identical lunar surface to that returned by Apollo. Did the two openly hostile governments collude together? And if so, how did the Chinese Jade Rabbit get in on the act?  Further - Luna 16 successfully landed and returned samples of moon dust in 1970. How (and why) did the Soviets fake their samples to exactly match those returned by the Apollo missions?  The same holds true for Venus. The Soviets were the first to the surface, with Venera 4. In all, the Soviets launched ten successful missions to Venus between 1967 and 1984. NASA also launched a number of missions to Venus, including the Magellan surface mapping probes. Again, both NASA and the Soviets returned consistent data.  The Soviets were also the first to the surface of Mars with Mars 2 in 1971. Since then, NASA has successfully landed a number of probes on the surface. The ESA currently has the Mars Express in orbit around the planet. Even India has a successful mars program. Again, all data returned by all missions is consistent.  It's the same with the Pluto mission. If the images are indeed faked, there is a chance that a later mission by a different space agency will expose that. Why would NASA take that risk?"

The ""space"" story is unlimited in its usefulness as a mind control device, also as a driver of technological domination of the human mind, enslaving it, such that people are no longer able to see the meaning of life.  It brings great distraction, demands for the materialism focus of science, and the constant pressure of fear can be applied from it's (space industry) technological understandings (i.e. fake nuke bombs on fake ICBM's, fake UFO's possibly showing up, fake asteroid threats, fake climate change threat on our ""Pale Blue Dot"", and of course a seemingly godless Universe in which humanity is ""dust in the wind"").  And the more specific answer on exoteric end goal here appears to me to be exactly what they push through the media and scifi and NASA...that humans will be travelling to ""space"" routinely, that society can be made high tech utopia (but more likely dystopian), family life erased and replaced with other futurism arrangements, transhumanism, etc.  The esoteric side is the use of ""space"" to distract humanity from the knowledge of the Fifth Kingdom, or what Christ called the Kingdom of God...the next stage in our spiritual evolution.  The ""satanic"" is not really one being, a Devil, but is the advanced rebellion of mankind, rebelling against the god(s) and seeking power over this physical Earth.  There are millions at all different levels of this rebellion, and their disciples, called many things...the Archons, the black priesthood, the black lodge, the illuminati, etc.  When you live and reincarnate on Earth you are learning to self-realize and gain control of your true Self, then enter the Fifth Kingdom of Unity.  But eventually, high in your development, you have the choice of entering this black lodge with the false promise of selfish power over your own little kingdom on Earth, fulfilling your desires, etc.  It's false because eventually the planet is always destroyed, the time for development is limited, and those who have left off to the Fifth Kingdom will do so and Judgement Day comes.  What becomes of the satanic?  They're set back eons left to start their development again until they finally get it...except knowing all that time they fucked up.  The true Hell.  So these guys know we're on this planet Earth until we figure  it all out and move on, but they'd like to get the place under their control as much as possible...turn it in to a prison for the rest of us, rather than the school that it is.

And yes: ive heard about so called 3rd celestial body that blocks the suns rays, that has never been documented or recorded or even seen or explained what its composed of and why it has no gravitational mass.

The cause we're given is not true, therefor we're all at a loss. The non-luminary, third eclipsing body is the best theory we've got.   Its called refraction and easily explained.    And indeed, during a lunar eclipse, the sun and moon are exactly 180 degrees apart in the sky. In a perfect alignment like this (called a ""syzygy""), such an observation would seem impossible. But thanks to Earth's atmosphere, the images of both the sun and moon are apparently lifted above the horizon by atmospheric refraction. This allows people on Earth to see the sun for several extra minutes before it actually has risen and the moon for several extra minutes after it has actually set. [How to See the Total Lunar Eclipse (Visibility Maps)]    As a consequence of this atmospheric trick, for many localities east of the Mississippi River, watchers will have a chance to observe this unusual sight firsthand. Weather permitting, you could have a short window of roughly 2 to 9 minutes (depending on your location) with the possibility of simultaneously seeing the sun rising in the east while the eclipsed full moon is setting in the west.  Sorry but stating that,    The cause we're given is not true, therefor we're all at a loss.    Is not an argument that the cause is wrong. It's simply an assertion without evidence.

theworldisflat,3csyel,KingKha,7,Fri Jul 10 15:39:49 2015 UTC,"SPOILER WARNING - I explain how rockets work. If someone wants to keep believing MSPaint doodles instead of basic physics principles, don't read the following.  Figure 1  In a rocket engine, combustion takes place in a chamber (the part in yellow). Gas gets very hot and wants to expand, but since it's confined to the volume of the combustion chamber, the pressure goes up. For an ideal gas, there is a simple mathematical relationship between temperature, pressure, and volume: pV = nRT. The very small opening in the back of the combustion chamber results in a very fast gas because you've got a lot at high pressure trying to squeeze through a small opening. After this, the nozzle widens to lower the pressure of the exhaust. But this doesn't slow the gas down at all, you've still got a stream of fast gas out one end of your rocket. Here are the forces acting on the combustion chamber and nozzle.  A fundamental principle in physics is conservation of momentum. The overall momentum of your rocket+fuel is 0. If you accelerate a lot of the fuel backwards, the rest of your rocket must be accelerated forwards, since the sum of both must still equal 0. This is the process by which a rocket operates.  In the atmosphere, rocket engines work optimally when the exit pressure is the same as the atmospheric pressure. The exit pressure is a function of the nozzle shape, and that's why there's no specific point at which rockets are most efficient. Different nozzle shapes are optimally efficient at different altitudes.  Now the assumed logical progression is kind of true but not really. Chemical rocket engines aren't ideal in a vacuum specifically because of underexpansion. But that doesn't mean they stop working altogether and the conclusion doesn't follow. If the rocket was going straight up, as long as it could accelerate faster than Earth's gravitational pull it could keep going forever (with infinite fuel).  Now things get mathy, so fair warning. The equation for rocket thrust is F = m(v+[(pe-po)/m]A), where m is the mass flow rate of the exhaust, v its velocity, pe the exhaust pressure, po the ambient pressure, A the cross section area of the rocket nozzle. You can see if po=0, There is still a non-zero thrust from the rocket.  Figure 2 is just more from Fig. 1  Figure 3  There is no such thing as a suction force in this sense. A vacuum doesn't exert a pull. If you have a balloon full of air, the air isn't getting sucked out of. It's getting pushed out because the pressure inside the balloon is higher than outside. Now you could say that all the fuel could get pushed out, but rocket scientists are quite clever and there's all sorts of pumps in engines to make sure it gets to the combustion chamber in a controlled flow, just like when you pinch a balloon and only let the air out slowly.  Figure 4  You will clearly note that a rocket doesn't need to push against anything. It works entirely by conservation of momentum. The same principle that lets it operate in an atmosphere will let it operate in a vacuum."

theworldisflat,3csyel,jtcribbs,-2,Fri Jul 10 16:28:20 2015 UTC,"Your figure 1 diagram/link is wrong...that red part with the exhaust gas coming out...yeah there are still action-reaction pairs (Newton's 3rd) of gas molecules colliding when exhaust gas meets any kind of medium there...gas, liquid, or solid.  In a .50 cal rifle, that red zone is meeting a solid case and bolt.  In a rocket, it's meeting gas.  In a vacuum, nothing, and those action-reaction force pairs inside the rocket are dropping faster than with atmosphere.  So less acceleration per time...rocket goes nowhere as compared to Cape Canaveral launchpad."
theworldisflat,3csyel,BoojumG,6,Fri Jul 10 17:26:55 2015 UTC,"That averages out to the arrow he shows though. Could you amend the figure he provided to be 'correct'?  Besides, the claim is that rockets don't work in vacuum, not that they would be more efficient if they were started in a large metal tube closed at the back end. Even if that's true it doesn't mean that rockets don't work in vacuum otherwise. You need to show that a rocket wouldn't work, not just that it would work less efficiently. /u/KingKha already said   Chemical rocket engines aren't ideal in a vacuum specifically because of underexpansion. But that doesn't mean they stop working altogether and the conclusion doesn't follow.    EDIT: I mean, look at the momentum argument. Hot, fast gas still comes out the back, right? That has momentum, doesn't it? Momentum has to be conserved, so if the gas is going backwards the rest of the rocket must be going forwards."
theworldisflat,3csyel,AngelOfLight,5,Fri Jul 10 18:23:56 2015 UTC,"Here is a simple experiment. Get hold of a supply of model rocket engines, 'C' or 'D' engines will work quite well. Arrange the engine so that it is flush against a pressure plate. Light the engine, and record the pressure applied to the plate during the burn.  Noe - do exactly the same experiment, but this time inside a hard vacuum chamber. Since solid rocket fuel contain nitrates (an oxidizer), it will still ignite and burn. See if it still produces thrust. We could then settle this dispute once and for all.  Why do the flat earthers not want to perform this experiment?"

theworldisflat,3crjgb,jtcribbs,6,Fri Jul 10 04:58:14 2015 UTC,"GPS equations are open source.  There's no mystery as to what goes on in the little boxes we use.  You can even build one in your basement.  We know the data that goes into them, and the equations that it runs them through to produce accurate results.  The system receives the coordinates from a transmitter, and derives a sphere of possible locations based on that data (the transmitter's location and the time it took the signal to arrive).  Because of the way the equations are structured, 4 transmitters are required to produce a useful result.  Here's the thing, we know where the transmitters are.  We have to know where the transmitters are, or the system wouldn't work.  You can't have multiple receivers using the same data and getting accurate locations, and still have a flat earth model.  You can't have the transmitter broadcast different data to different devices, because the devices don't communicate in any way with the transmitters; there's no way for a transmitter to know where the device is or that it's even looking for information."
theworldisflat,3crjgb,TheUnmashedPotato,-3,Fri Jul 10 05:15:51 2015 UTC,"The more I study into GPS myself the less I believe arguments like these...  Basically a cell phone tower is in the range of 800 MHz carrier frequency with only 100 watt radiative power from the tower. And we know cell signals can drop at tens of miles.  The max AM radio stations on 1 MHz are 50,000 watt radiative power and reach hundreds of miles.  The official GPS carrier frequency is about 1500 MHz with only 50 watt radiative power coming from 12,000 miles away! Makes no sense.  These GPS signals are likely one and the same source with cell phone towers, just different transmitters of frequency.  Cell towers also change their frequencies constantly.  It wouldn't be that hard for ground based broadcasts to mimic periodic ""satellite"" movement overhead if 99% of all GPS usage is likely in cell tower radii...  The deployment and release of mass GPS devices also overlaps with cell tower expansion worldwide.  And why are other nations now developing their own GPS if the original system is allegedly only 24 - 30 satellites necessary for full coverage?  I smell BS...  The other nations are likely deploying their own format on their cell network and controlling the ability to map locales and sell their official maps for their regions.  You can't necessarily even buy full maps of all regions of Earth if you take your GPS to other continents.  I mean that's a ridiculous notion if the system allegedly works ""globally"" from space the way they say it does.  USGS has mapped the whole world by now, then could easily overlay any of them to a signal received in the middle of Africa.  But that's not how the system works, the GPS devices very likely do not work all over the globe as they are cell tower based...

Since oceans are never perfectly level we use the Geoid for things like GPS and measuring elevation.  When you hear someone say ""Sea Level"" they are talking about the Geoid, not the actual surface of the water since that surface is constantly shifting up and down.

While the entire solar system is moving around the galactic center and the entire Milky Way is moving through space our planet's relationship with the Sun is the same as it was in ancient times.  Remember that one lap around the milky way takes hundreds of millions of years (someone correct me if I'm wrong -- quoting that number from memory).  Changes in the relationships between astronomical objects generally occurs over incredibly vast amounts of time.  The span of the last few thousand years is nothing when it comes to the age of the universe.  But you aren't quite correct about ancient sundials.

theworldisflat,3coon9,Angadar,3,Thu Jul 9 16:29:25 2015 UTC,"TL;DR: The angles we actually use are still the same, and only change over millions of years.  Plus, there were a lot of really smart mathematicians in the last 1000 years.  We have moved billions of miles in that time around the galactic disk, but the movement in the disk isn't used to derive any of the relevant things we use day to day (when is noon, for example).  Those are determined by much simpler relationships (our orbit around the sun, and occasionally the moon's orbit depending on which civilization you ask).  The cool thing about our orbit around the sun is that it's pretty stable.  There are some minor effects that cause the earth's rotation to slow a little, a our orbit is gradually becoming more perfectly circular, but these effects won't be noticeable in the time lines we're talking about (these effects take millions or, more likely, billions of years to have an appreciable effect.  That means that the mathematicians a millennium ago were working with the the same angels we're working with today.  As Dethfiesta mentioned, the exact mathematics used to determine the correct angles has been around for centuries.  Newer mathematics, like calculus, weren't strictly needed to find these angles (though some of the tools they provide can make it easier).  the geometry, algebra, and trigonometry was invented centuries (millennia in some cases) ago.  In the middle east, the fall of the Roman Empire and raids from Vikings weren't such terrible things.  They invented modern algebra (derived from Al Jabar, the reunion of broken parts) and vastly expanded humanity's understanding of the natural world.

On a sphere, the gravity caused by that sphere will pull everything on the surface of that sphere towards its center.  This is why people on the ""bottom"" of the Earth don't fall off -- everything is attracted to the center of the Earth.  So, water wants to settle as low as it can -- this is obvious and intuitively understood as the fact that ""water flows downhill.""  This settling as low as possible is the point of lowest potential energy. Well, where can water go to once it has reached sea level? That's as low as it can go, and because the Earth is a spheroid shape, to get as close to the center of the Earth as possible water curves around the globe.  In other words, water flows to where it is closest to the center of the Earth so that it has the lowest amount of potential energy.  Because the Earth is round, this means that the Oceans curve at the same rate as the planet itself, about 8 inches per mile -- too small a curvature to be noticed except at larger distances.  Hope that helps.  Someone might be able to provide a clearer explanation.  If you'd like me to elaborate on anything I would be happy to try."

The movements of these bodies are incompatible with a rotating sphere."
theworldisflat,3cpo25,TheUnmashedPotato,2,Thu Jul 9 21:07:29 2015 UTC,"The effect of asynchronous days doesn't have much to do with those, no.  However, earth's elliptical orbit, plus the axial tilt cause the analemma.  In fact, the fact that our orbit isn't a circle causes the east-west part, an the axial tilt causes the north-south part.  Polaris does have a parallax effect from the orbit, but the extreme distance makes it very minuscule (much like taking a few steps when looking at distant mountains doesn't make them move perceptibly).  The deviation is measurable, though, and comes out to about 8 milliarcseconds.  As for most stars, the closer ones do have measurable parallax, while more distant objects are too far away for this effect to even be measurable."

However, the axis the earth spins on is tilted.  During the summer, it's tilted toward the sun.  Here is a visual representation.  As you can see, since it’s tilted toward the sun, more of the northern hemisphere is lit up, hence more daylight.  The opposite happens in the southern hemisphere.  Since the earth’s axis doesn’t move that much over one year, in winter the opposite happens.  You can just imagine the dark and light areas reversed, and see that the northern hemisphere gets less light, and therefore has longer nights."

That circular arc should only see an angle of sun orientation in the sky, not a three hour gain of sun exposure.  Only 180 degrees along that arc are ever exposed to sunlight, and the rotation spans this in 12 hours constant."
theworldisflat,3chqrg,TheUnmashedPotato,4,Wed Jul 8 02:27:30 2015 UTC,"Actually, more than 180 degrees are exposed to sunlight.  Remember, the earth is tilted.  This means that the arcs are also at an angle as well.  Only on the equinox is 180 degrees of each latitude in sunlight.  And during the winter, the opposite effect occurs, the arcs being angled such that less than 180 degrees is in light.  Additionally,  the farther from the equator, the more pronounced this effect becomes until you reach the arctic circle, where it's possible to get the full arc into daylight (or night)."

So there's not really a timekeeping like what I'm saying, one reliant on the absolute orientation of the Earth in space...that only might come through a bit with the tilted orientation, but not fully.   This doesn't make sense. Sidereal time is the method that tracks ""absolute"" orientation to the degree that such a thing exists, and there's no weird relationship between 360 degrees in a circle and ~365 days in a year. 360 is just the number we chose to divide circles into, and 365 is approximately the number of solar days we see that it takes to complete a yearly cycle. It could have been 50 or 500 instead if the Earth rotated slower or faster while keeping the orbit the same, but that's not under our control. We could also have chosen to divide circles into 100 sections instead of 360, and that's just an arbitrary choice we've made. Sidereal time has nothing to do with the Earth's orbit - only its rotation. Solar time has to do with both.  I'm going to start over very simply and we'll see where you have a disagreement. This will be long, but it's because I see it's necessary to go into great detail. I wish I had a whiteboard to draw on for you.    At first, we know nothing about how the world works. We look at the sky, and things move! In particular you can easily see the Sun moving across the sky, and whenever the Sun isn't visible you can easily see the stars also moving across the sky in the same general direction. If you keep watching, they basically go in cycles! They return to just about the position they used to be in.  But when you time how long this takes, it takes the Sun (on average) about four minutes longer to return to its highest spot in the sky than it takes the stars to return to their original positions in the sky. You keep watching day after day, and yes, the stars return to their original positions faster than the Sun does, by about four minutes on average.  Let's give these time periods a name! We'll call the time it takes the stars to return to their original positions a sidereal day, and the average time it takes the Sun to return to its highest spot in the sky will be called a solar day.   If we watch for hundreds of days, we also notice slower changes in the precise position of the Sun at its highest point that repeat about every 365 solar days (not quite exactly). This also matches up with the seasons repeating about every 365 solar days! Let's call this a year. But if we've been paying close attention to the sidereal days as well, we note that the year is one sidereal day longer than the number of solar days.  This is all simple recorded fact. You don't need any model of the universe to get this far, just careful observation.    Now, let's see how a heliocentric spinning-globe model explains all of this. The Earth is a globe that is rotating, and that globe itself is also orbiting the Sun. If the Earth were just hanging in space with no Sun nearby and rotating by itself, we would still have sidereal days, and we could still watch the stars spin around in the sky. But now let's add the Sun, and have the Earth orbiting it as the Earth is also rotating on its own axis (counterclockwise as seen from the ""side"" of the orbit that the north pole is on, in this case). Here is a video animation showing the setup that I just found.  Now you can see in this video that after exactly one sidereal day has passed, the stars have all returned to their original positions in the sky but the Sun has not quite yet. Because of the Earth's orbital motion the Sun's apparent position in the sky has shifted, and it won't reach its highest point for an additional four minutes (and the spinning-globe-orbiting-the-sun model accounts for this perfectly if you assume a number for the angular speed of the orbit that matches with what we observe - that is, enough to go through 360 degrees in about 365 solar days).   The solar day is about four minutes longer than the sidereal day because the Earth is moving relative to the Sun! A year is how long it takes for the Earth to go around the Sun once. That exactly explains why the year is one sidereal day longer than the number of solar days!  Half a year after we started, you see that the sidereal day and the solar day have gotten half a sidereal day off, since the sidereal days have been going by slightly faster than the solar days. This means that if we started with the sidereal day and the solar days synchronized, they will now be opposite! At the beginning of that sidereal day the Sun will still be halfway through its previous solar day cycle! The Sun will be overhead at sidereal ""midnight"", and the Sun will be down at sidereal ""noon"". As we go through the second half of the year, they will slowly come back into sync as the sidereal days ""lap"" the solar days in their progress. After a year is complete, everything has returned to where it used to be, both the Sun and the stars simultaneously.  Now it's very important to note that humans like daylight more than nighttime in general since it's hard to see at night, and we generally care far more about where the Sun is than where the stars are. So we make the clocks hanging on our walls complete one full revolution every solar day. We don't care as much about whether the star Vega has returned to a given spot in the sky again as we care about whether the Sun is up. So if you hadn't heard anything about sidereal days or paid much attention to the stars, the only ""day"" you've ever heard of is the solar day.  So if you wait six months after some starting point and then ask yourself if the Sun is where you expect it to be, remember that the days that track where the Sun is in the sky are the solar days, and not the sidereal days. Saying that the sun's position in the middle of the sidereal day should be half a cycle off after half a year is certainly correct, that's exactly what the globe model predicts, and it's also what we see! But when you check whether it's the middle of the sidereal day yet half a year after you started watching, make sure you're looking at a sidereal clock and not a solar one. Mixing those two up would be a silly mistake.  Of course the Sun is up in the sky in the middle of every solar day year-round. That's what we decided that a solar day is, remember? It's simply the name we gave for how long it takes for the Sun to complete a short cycle. Just don't expect the stars to be in the same place at solar midnight every night all year long. They won't be. Their position at solar midnight will shift by about four minutes worth of stellar rotation every night, just like the heliocentric spinning-globe model predicts.     Please let me know where, if anywhere, something doesn't make sense to you. If you honestly want to understand I'll try to help."
theworldisflat,3chqrg,DethFiesta,1 point,Thu Jul 9 09:31:42 2015 UTC,"I did read through your long post, just haven't had time to reply yet, but thanks for giving the matter so much attention!  I don't like to type long replies so can only address one or two points...  The sidereal day is technically referenced day to day, like the solar day, and is nearly four minutes shorter.  But it's NOT an absolute position, a fixed orientation in 3D space, that the Earth returns to...if it were, then the difference when the rotation would reach the solar day return point would expand.  In other words, sidereal day is referencing from the star position tonight to the same star position tomorrow, and repeating again.  But even the distance stars most definitely change position over longer time and drift out of view as new constellations appear over the year, unlike the solar day hitting the local meridian every day at 24 hours.  So sidereal day is an approximation of the apparent return of stars to the same position night after night.  It's not some absolute position of Earth's ""rotation"".  The fact that it is an approximation says very much that the Globe Earth model is just that...a model, a more elaborate version of a 2D wristwatch modeling solar time.  So the Earth system doesn't necessarily look like this, a ball tilted and spinning around a central Sun.  It has been very tempting for centuries to see this model and think that if we could ""zoom out"" to space it would look like this.  And the model has had and can have so many other adjustments and tweakings to match the cyclical phenomena observed, which is another reason why it persists.    But models are not necessarily reality...and in Globe Earth, it marks the solar day as being more than a 360 degree rotation to get back to the sun's climax, which in and of itself is a hideous notion.  Okay for modeling, but bizarre for reality..."
theworldisflat,3chqrg,DethFiesta,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:17:13 2015 UTC,"But it's NOT an absolute position, a fixed orientation in 3D space, that the Earth returns to...if it were, then the difference when the rotation would reach the solar day return point would expand.   I don't understand what you're saying. What's ""the difference when the rotation would reach the solar day return point""?  The difference in the length of the sidereal day and the solar day is such that they would be back in synch after one year, with one more sidereal day having passed than solar days. Explain yourself in detail, and I think you won't be able to, because what you're saying is inconsistent.   In other words, sidereal day is referencing from the star position tonight to the same star position tomorrow, and repeating again. But even the distance stars most definitely change position over longer time and drift out of view as new constellations appear over the year,   Nope, you just did it again. You confused sidereal and solar days. The stars' positions tonight will be the same as the stars' positions tomorrow after one sidereal day has passed, which is shorter than the solar day. The position of the stars at solar midnight will shift every night, because it's sidereal time that tracks the stars, not solar. You really really need to get this one point: There is an entirely separate type of day called the sidereal day. Sidereal days are shorter. When I say that the stars will be in the same position after a sidereal day has passed, stop looking at the solar clock on your wall to tell what the sidereal time of day is. It's the wrong clock. That's a solar day clock.  The constellations shift their position over the year with respect to a given time on the solar clocks. Not the sidereal ones. I explained this in my post, near the end. This is exactly what a globe model predicts. Where constellations are in the sky during the solar night is what shifts. The solar time of day. Not the sidereal.   It's not some absolute position of Earth's ""rotation"".   Yes it is. The Earth spins, and we watch the distant stars move across the sky. When Earth has completed one rotation, the stars are back where they started. It's exactly how we tell what the Earth's rotational orientation is. Explain yourself. Even if you think it's the stars that are ""really moving"" and not the Earth, their relative orientation goes in cycles that have a period we call a sidereal day. It's just the name for how long it takes the stars to return to their original position in the sky. Even if you think it's the stars moving, this is obviously a rotation. How can the sidereal day be anything but the period of a rotation?   The fact that it is an approximation    Nope, we already disagree. The sidereal day is even more precise and consistent than the solar day is, because the sidereal day depends only on the Earth's rotation with respect to all the distant stars. If anything it's the solar day that is a bit of an approximation, because the Earth's orbit is noticeably non-circular. This makes some solar days actually shorter than others, but the sidereal days are very consistent. The Earth's rotation is slowing down, but only very very slowly.   it marks the solar day as being more than a 360 degree rotation to get back to the sun's climax, which in and of itself is a hideous notion.   I don't understand what you're saying. Please explain. I think you're still hung up on thinking that the number of degrees in a circle and the number of solar days in the year should be the same. I explained very carefully that there is no reason to expect that.  Please reread my post on these points, and explain what you're saying in yours. You don't seem to understand sidereal time still.  And since you've been dismissive before, let me make it very clear that when I say I don't understand you that I am NOT saying that I think you've got a point. I am certain that you are deeply confused about sidereal time. You're just also not explaining what you're thinking very clearly."
theworldisflat,3chqrg,TheUnmashedPotato,1 point,Fri Jul 10 06:45:36 2015 UTC,"The constellations shift their positions and even disappear and new ones appear over the year, correct?  By definition then, to any time reckoning, even sidereal time, they are not constant.  Night to night they appear to return to exact position and that is the ""sidereal day""...but as the nights move on these angles are changing until eventually a full constellation is gone.  So the whole sidereal timekeeping is an approximation, and it can still be an approximation and still return to near sync with solar time in one year because the whole pattern of star movement over the year is cyclical.    But the system doesn't really even do this...as there are accepted explanations for why astronomical years don't always sync properly, and of course Leap Year.  There's no exactness to sidereal time, you're just incorrect on that, it's because the star map is too dynamic, not a single Sun as reference.  However, the Sun is constant with solar time (and mechanical, electrical, and atomic clock time!), it hits climax on the local meridian every day...it reappears in that same spot predictably, every day."
theworldisflat,3chzy2,spiritmeetthesoul,7,Wed Jul 8 01:39:48 2015 UTC,"Okay, I'll take a crack at some of these.  He's curious about why, if the earth is rotating every 24 hours, we still see the sun at noon through out our orbit.  It was actually a fairly interesting explanation when I found it.  /u/jtcribbs actually had the same qustions here.  I had several responses, but it wasn't until the last of my responses that I finally found the correct answer.  He brings up a curious question about why airplanes don't have to compensate for the curvature of the earth, constantly tipping their nose downward to keep from flying off into space.  The answer is that the vertical force that keeps them in the air (lift) is regulated by the atmosphere.  As they ascend and the atmosphere gets thinner, the force decreases.  Planes can fly level with respect to the ground because they find an equilibrium between gravity and lift.  Why don't we feel 1000 mile per hour winds at the equator?  The atmosphere, after billions of years, has gained momentum from the earth's rotation, and now rotates with the earth.  This is also why helicopters can't simply float and wait for the earth to spin around them, the atmosphere keeps pushing them along with the earth.  How do we know what's in the earth?  Logical inference.  This one would take a whole thread on it's own, so I'll keep it brief here.  We can tell the density of the earth by making fine measurements of gravity, as well as examining magma when it does come up.  From this as well as our knowledge of chemistry, we know what the interior must behave like.  The details of geology can get pretty technical, so you can start a new thread if you want details.  Moon landings?  Retro-reflectors on the moon.  Special mirrors that were precisely made so they reflect light back to it's source.  There's a couple we left behind to do experiments with, and we still use them to this day.  I can't imagine how something so precisely manufactured would form naturally on the moon.  Again, there's more, but it'd be best to debate this in a new thread.  Cant feel the earth's spin?  Force is generated from acceleration, not from speed.  That means only if you change direction or speed (or both) do you feel a force.  Alas I cannot find it now, but someone on this board did the calculations of the net force on us from the earth's orbit and the galactic orbit to find they come out to just a tiny fraction of what we feel from gravity every day.  Temperature graphs show outer space to be hot.  Heat needs a medium to exist.  Outer space has some funky temperatures (extreme heat in sunlight, cold in shadow) but it works a little differently.  Since space is effectively a vacuum (nowhere is a perfect vacuum) the molecules that posses that heat are few and far between.  That means that there is little medium to actually transfer that heat to, or lose your heat into.  In fact, one of the biggest issues for any long term space journey (like to mars), is how to get rid of the heat out of the vehicle while traveling.  How can we see satellites at night, when they're so far away.  The ones we see are reflecting light.  Despite their size, the highly reflective surfaces of some satellites shine brightly and are visible.  This is similar to why pilots can see a light from a pen laser from miles away, despite it only being a few millimeters across.  How can the shuttle dock with the space station if they're moving so fast?  They are moving incredibly fast, but not relative to each other.  When it was still working, the space shuttle was intentionally launched into orbit in the same direction as the space stations orbit to make sure the speed difference between them wasn't too great.  This is the same reason a person can tight rope between moving trains or many other stunts you've seen.  Vacuums suck out fuel/rockets can't work in space.  Vacuums don't apply a force, the pressure of the material provides the force.  Additionally, the exhaust from a rocket isn't what provides thrust (it doesn't have to push off anything) it's the initial expansion when the fuel is ignited that gives thrust.  I'd love to go into more detail on this, but it'd be best in it's own thread.  Why don't satellites collide more?  The image he shows is misleading.  Those satellites are about the size of a car, meaning the earth in that picture is over 700 satellites across.  Additionally, because of their various altitudes, the space available to them is enormous.  Lastly, they are intentionally put in orbits that don't cross, or cross very little, meaning the chance of a collision is minuscule at best.  No satellites take photos of the earth.  Blatantly false, millions of satellite images exist from many different sources.  No Hubble pictures of the earth or moon?  Hubble was designed to take distant images.  It's similar to why you can't take good close ups with a telescopic lens.  ISS flickers.  Needs a better camera.  The effect you're seeing in that particular video is the rolling shutter effect from the camera.  I'll go into detail if you'd like, or you can google it, lots of good explanations on youtube.  Water doesn't curve.  The force of gravity curves it.  It finds the lowest energy potential it can in earth's gravity, since the gravity pulls in different directions at different points, the result will be a curved ocean, as seen from space.  Evolution.  I assume this is not a debate /u/SquareHimself wants in this particular subreddit.  If he does, I'll let him start the thread.  Atheism is a religion.  The rules explicitly state we don't deal with this one here, so I won't.  That's what I got for the first half.  If I can find some more time, I'll try to do his positive proofs that are presented in the second half.  Edit: Because I can't find a pen to write this down in real life, it's going here for later.  I went up to about 24:20."
theworldisflat,3chzy2,TheUnmashedPotato,3,Wed Jul 8 04:16:38 2015 UTC,"Here's the calculations for the rotation/orbit of Earth around the Sun/galaxy and the accelerations (-> forces) we experience due to this movement.  Also just to clarify your point on rockets in a vacuum, rockets work due to Newton's third law and conservation of momentum. The rocket-fuel system has net zero momentum before ignition, after burning the exhaust has mass and velocity travelling away from the rocket, and therefore momentum; due to conservation of momentum the entire system's momentum must remain zero and thus the rocket receives an impulse as well giving it momentum of equal magnitude but in the opposite direction of the exhaust."
theworldisflat,3chzy2,PM_ME_YOUR_TRINKETS,0,Wed Jul 8 09:58:59 2015 UTC,"There has to be a medium (an encounter with matter) in order for thrust to push a rocket along.  If there is no medium, you have a free expansion of a gas, in which no work is done: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_expansion  The conservation of momentum in a free expansion is just the gas molecules continuing to move on in their velocities away from the container they just exited.  Nothing, or rather miniscule, velocity is then imparted to the rocket as the gas has so much physical space to expand into.  The conservation of momentum in a normal atmosphere involves the high pressure gas molecules exiting which are then colliding and rebounding off the encounter with atmosphere (not much space to move), and now impacting the rocket as well, so rocket moves in the opposite vector.  The atmospheric gas molecules (or whatever medium, liquid it could be too), now have gained some of the original momentum as well, a vibrating and heated plume forms along the path of the rocket climbing."
theworldisflat,3chzy2,jtcribbs,2,Thu Jul 9 05:35:51 2015 UTC,"Free expansion:       Free expansion is an irreversible process in which a gas expands into an insulated evacuated chamber. It is also called Joule expansion.  Real gases experience a temperature change during free expansion. For an ideal gas, the temperature doesn't change, and the conditions before and after adiabatic free expansion satisfy  , where p is the pressure, V is the volume, and i and f refer to the initial and final states. Since the gas expands, Vf > Vi , which implies that the pressure does drop (Pf < Pi).  During free expansion, no work is done by the gas. The gas goes through states that are not in thermodynamic equilibrium before reaching its final state, which implies that one cannot define thermodynamic parameters as values of the gas as a whole. For example, the pressure changes locally from point to point, and the volume occupied by the gas (which is formed of particles) is not a well defined quantity.  A free expansion is typically achieved by opening a stopcock that allows the gas to expand into a vacuum. Although it would be difficult to achieve in reality, it is instructive to imagine a free expansion caused by moving a piston faster than virtually any atom. No work is done because there is no pressure on the piston. No heat energy leaves or enters the piston. Nevertheless, there is an entropy change. But the well-known formula for entropy change,     does not apply because the process is not a thermodynamically reversible process. For an ideal gas, the change in entropy  is the same as for the Joule-Thomson effect:       Image i - A free expansion of a gas can be achieved by moving the piston out faster than the fastest atoms in the gas.

theworldisflat,3chzy2,Angadar,1 point,Thu Jul 9 06:28:59 2015 UTC,"See here for an explanation on free expansion in space (tl:dr the free expansion experiment is done in a closed container, so the force in every direction cancel each other out.)   According to your 'interpretation' of momentum: if I stand on a skateboard, and throw an object (let's say a brick) one way, it is the brick pushing the air that drives me the other way? If so, how come that I will go faster when throwing the brick, instead of just pushing the air with my bare hands?"
theworldisflat,3chzy2,Toon_DB,0,Thu Jul 9 07:35:40 2015 UTC,"If you were in free, frictionless space, even more ideal then the skateboard, and throw a brick then yes you would move off in the opposite direction.  But what is expanding there?  Your arms.  What are they pushing between?  A brick and your torso.    If you were just moving your arms outward, in a free space vacuum, would you move?  No.  The expanding gas of a rocket translates conceptually to your arms in the scenario above, but the need to impact and push off a medium, the brick (can be atmospheric gas as well, as two gas phases of matter meeting up are two very high kinetic energy phases and will certainly sense one another and exchange momentum).  In a vacuum, if you were theoretically quick enough, you could hold a solid plate under the rocket nozzle, it would continue to move along and accelerate for as long as the solid plate was in close proximity to the nozzle (near full contact).  The gas then is pushing off a medium upon exiting and not fully a free expansion.  I think people have a hard time with this because gases are not visibly seen to be doing the tremendous amount of work they can do, even upon meeting another gas medium.  We only get a sense of it during explosions, like when a nat gas explosion happens on a house, solid walls immediately blown out.  Well, the expanding gas still does an immense amount of work on the surrounding atmosphere as well."
theworldisflat,3chzy2,jtcribbs,4,Thu Jul 9 12:19:36 2015 UTC,"You have no idea what you are talking about, do you?"
theworldisflat,3chzy2,Toon_DB,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:28:01 2015 UTC,"The gas expands in a chamber with one open end.  The gas has energy imparted on it by combustion.  Because of this, the gas expands in all directions.  Upon contacting the walls of the chamber, energy is imparted on the craft.  The exhaust from the craft is actually wasted energy that couldn't be harnessed.  Once a particle is ejected, it has no need to rebound back to the parent space craft to impart more energy, that energy is lost.  What's more, we know this works because we've done it in a vacuum."
theworldisflat,3chzy2,TheUnmashedPotato,0,Thu Jul 9 19:49:00 2015 UTC,"A gas expanding in a vacuum against an object or chamber with open end will have some momentum imparted to the object, but not nearly as great as if the gas is impacting another medium or solid mass upon exiting.  You can have an impressive movement if the mass to fuel ratio is made tiny, but actual rockets are not tiny.  Notice the Mythbusters use a Hotwheel car, lol...lets see them try it with a very tall vertical chamber, with significantly weighted rocket, once open to 1 atm and then sealed to vacuum...and actually measure thrust.  Too hard for those guys.  Just compare two forms of weaponry with projectiles...a .50 cal rifle vs. shoulder fired rocket launcher.  In the gun, the expanding gas pushes off the case and bolt, and if the gun uses blowback auto loading, then the bullet must exit the barrel before the case clears the chamber.  What does that mean?  It means massive pressure is pushing off the case and bolt (and your shoulder) to project the bullet.  In the rocket launcher case, the backend of the barrel is open and not made to blow your shoulder off with expanding gas.  But how does expanding gas now propel the projectile?  It has to push against atmosphere now.  And how?  It has to be a continuous stream of propellant as gas meeting gas still has a great deal of diffusion, unlike gas in a gun chamber.  So if you remove both of those, the continuous stream or the surrounding atmosphere, you do not have a  projectile going anywhere very fast.  From conservation of momentum, an expanding gas in a vacuum will impart some miniscule level of force to its chamber, but not nearly as great as exiting to a surrounding gas or liquid medium, or exiting to a solid gun chamber.  When NASA used to launch its big rockets with alleged human payload, they were so large because they were pushing to run horizontal on second and third stage far away from the coast.  But these things were ONLY running about 3000 mph at 10 mile altitude for 10 min. burn time...that doesn't get very far, but far enough from view at 500 miles over ocean.  In the case of the Space Shuttle, that thing would roll over and coast it likely, on hidden jets perhaps, landing at any number of TAL sites, Transoceanic Abort Landing (TAL).  Then they just flew that shit back on the 747, lol...that was the whole point of a reusable spacecraft...a fucking spaceship that was actually an airplane, hahaha"

The rocket equations used by thousands of amateur rocket enthusiasts, missile guidance systems, pyrotechnic engineers, and many other occupations predict precisely the opposite of your claims.  They don't take into account the viscosity of the medium the exhaust is expelled into, because it doesn't have any significant effect.  The predictive models completely ignore what you claim as the core principle to rocketry, and yet still produce demonstrably accurate results, verified thousands of times every year, all over the world."

It's a constant at launch...and all rockets do the same, hit high altitude and stall out.  Submarine missiles might launch briefly through a short distance of ocean, but that really isn't going to impact design when the ICBM needs to climb through atmosphere.  The reason that the public do not realize this, or pay much attention to it, is that the atmosphere is constant like I said (we cannot see full scale rockets perform in a vacuum), and two, actual rocket engineers DO KNOW these things stall out at high altitude.  That is why the space program is faked!  Also why they haven't been and are not going to inform the world about it, lol.  I mean the final Space Shuttle launch was $1.5 billion!

Most of this has been repeated here in other threads, so I'll try to limit this to discussions not already going on elsewhere.  If someone want's to reply to this with appropriate links, I'd be very thankful.  Additionally, for the purposes of this response, I'll try my best to run on the assumption that the earth is flat.  Only those things that are immediately and demonstrably wrong will be pointed out here.  As such, I probably won't be responding to several points.  I encourage many of the others who are reading this to take a different tack if they so desire.  North magnetic pole in the middle, south magnetic pole around the edge.  I'm going to assume I misunderstood what he was saying, and I invite someone to clarify this point for me.  No magnetic field has EVER been observed taking that particular shape.  No mechanism has been seriously proposed to explain how any magnetic field would take that shape.  It is simply not known to occur, and hasn't been recreated.  Again, I probably misunderstood him, and I await someone to correct me.  The Moon is self illuminating, and it's light has much different properties from sunlight.  This is blatantly false.  No one in this subreddit, that I've read, has directly made this claim, so I'm assuming this isn't part of the ""standard flat earth model"" as other claims like the center being the north pole.  We understand the properties of light, and basically NONE of the attributes he describes for either kind of light have been measured.  Sunlight is preserving and decreases combustion in a bonfire?  Moonlight is putrefying and increases combustion?  Basic measurements with  a prism, spectrograph or several other light measuring devices prove this to be painfully false.  I will, however, allow some benefit of the doubt, as he does stress that the brief topic isn't all encompassing.  I would love someone to address this in another thread with more details, and summarize what is assumed for the purposes of this subreddit.  The ancients seemed to all agree that the earth was flat.  They also thought women were property and less than men, bloodletting was a great cure all, and that disease was caused by fickle and displease gods.  I'm not sure what he's trying to appeal to with this argument, other than to help illustrate the design of the current model.

DethFiesta's response there: ""Great video, thanks for posting it. This thread is pretty old so I don't think your comment will get any views. If you want an answer I'd suggesting making your own post in this sub with this link. Also, I think calling Flat Earth a theory gives it far too much credit, given that a theory is something that can explain a large body of facts.

theworldisflat,3cfg7p,DethFiesta,4,Wed Jul 8 12:15:03 2015 UTC,"So every star is rotating around Polaris?  Then why don't we see Polaris in the video that OP posted?  They are clearly rotating around something, but it isn't Polaris. Why can't people in Australia even see Polaris? Why does the Southern Hemisphere see an entirely different set of constellations (besides the Zodiac ones, which are visible in both hemispheres, but crucially, at opposite times of the year) ?  Dubay is, at every turn, completely full of it."
theworldisflat,3cfg7p,DethFiesta,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:39:51 2015 UTC,"For everyone's convenience, I will put here the explanation given in the video. See it yourself, it has some graphs too: ""Scale, perspective and horizon. Earth is huge but the sky is even bigger. You actually see a pretty large chunk of it. The amount of the sky we can see depends on where we are and which way we're looking. The closer we are to the edge the lower our sky horizon is from each side. This is where the second circle on the horizon is coming from. It's because we see the horizon as flat, so the lines get bent with the perspective!!! So it looks like second pole, but in reality its just a massive perspective warp due to scale of the actual sky"" Then there is a very interesting explanation of the astrolabe and the problem that on the exact south pole axis no bright star exists (equivalent to the Polaris). I won't bother with the rest of the video (it's a guy not accepting photos as real, statements such as ""How can a photographer take long exposure photo of the night sky if he is standing on a spinning ball?"", and a clear incapacity to understand the relativeness of our velocity in the galaxy compared with the relative positions of the stars)  First of all, Sigma Octantis is indeed a tiny bit off of the south pole point in the sky. But the issue still remains: there is a point in the southern sky around which all other points revolve. There doesn't have to be a star on it (Polaris being on the equivalent northern point is a very fortunate event). The ""perspective warp"" theory does not stand. They would not revolve complete circles even if that was true (the FET explanation for the warp has to do with sky having a horizon too, which I will not even bother to question at this point)  Therefore, I still need an explanation for the south point around which all stars revolve 360 degrees.  PS. Saying that not everyone in the southern hemisphere sees Sigma Octantis (which is not true), does not also address the issue here. By the way, of course the stars rise from the east and set to the west on the southern hemisphere. And they are also upside down. That's how being on the ""down"" side of a sphere works.  PS2. If no well-versed proponent of FET comes forth to give me a well-standing explanation for this, I will be really inclined to accept that all of you guys are just trolls wasting our time ;)"

theworldisflat,3cfaus,spiritmeetthesoul,10,Tue Jul 7 13:43:47 2015 UTC,"There are no good answers, because as you said, traveling East or West will take you around the Globe Earth and you will come back to the same point.  This is also true if you travel North or South around the globe.  People have sailed around Antarctica, which is impossible on a Flat Earth.  But, if you accept the Flat Earth nonsense then you have to travel South to hit the ice wall, because in the FE model the North Pole is the center of the world and Antarctica forms a ring around the entire planet, which is ludicrous.  Pay no attention to the fact that Antarctic bases which are only a few miles apart on the Round Earth would be many times further apart on a Flat Earth and that people at those stations know quite well that they aren't vastly farther apart than shown on the Globe.  Never mind that the Flat Earth model can't explain why the Earth has a Magnetic field in the first place, since that requires the Earth to have an Iron core and to be rotating. How can there be ""North"" on a flat disc that can't generate any magnetism?  Never mind that no one has seen this magical ice wall that surrounds the entire Earth (although people post pictures of land and sea ice and pretend that a 20 feet high sheet of ice is some insurmountable obstacle).  Tell us -- why do you believe the Earth is flat?"

theworldisflat,3cfaus,PM_ME_YOUR_TRINKETS,2,Wed Jul 8 00:00:26 2015 UTC,"In the flat earth model north, for reasons not fully explained, will always be at the center of the disk, and south (again, not explained) will always be toward the rim.  Presumably you are using a compass to detect this, so you start walking east.  As you travel in a straight line, in the flat earth model, you should notice that your compass is now slightly off, so you correct your movement and keep going.  After some time, you should notice it's off again, so again you correct and keep going.  You should expect to repeat this process a large number of times, each correction gradually shifting you until you have completed a full circle.  This effect isn't observed to actually occur.  The big problem is that no mechanism for this occurring is proposed.  We have never before found a magnetic field that behaves like this, with a normal north pole and a doughnut shaped (toroidal) south pole.  Nor is there any explanation as to what is generating the magnetic field itself.  Additionally, the flat earth model suggests you will be traveling tens of thousands of miles farther if you do this in the southern hemisphere than in the northern hemisphere, which makes me wonder how any surveyor or road builder in Australia or South America never reported this finding."

Pardon my ignorance, but in a RE model, when you go east, at some point you'd have the same problem and would have to correct in a similar fashion...no?

theworldisflat,3cfaus,PM_ME_YOUR_TRINKETS,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:18:53 2015 UTC,"In a round earth you don't have that problem.  On a sphere (or anything basically spherical) you can travel straight in one direction, and the curvature of the plane you're walking on is what allows you to make the circle.  You never have to consciously change your course and, in fact, would want to keep going directly straight if you wanted to end up back where you started.  It's a little strange to think about if you haven't taken fairly advanced geometry courses.  To better understand exactly how a curved surface can alter an apparently straight path, I recommend googling ""ant on a Mobius Strip"".  I'll edit this post to include a good link when I have some more time.  To address your last question, ""...[when] does east become west...""  there is nothing inherent about the east or west hemispheres.  We have arbitrarily drawn lines on the globe and just said ""one side is east, one side is west"".  The line, incidentally, goes through Greenwich, England, home of the guys who invented the system.  You can imagine it as a line that loops down from the north pole, around the south pole, and back up the other side to the north.  The ONLY reason it's there is because the guy who set it up thought it was a good spot to work from.  While crossing these lines will move you from the ""western hemisphere"" to the ""eastern hemisphere"", the directions of east and west are still not affected, so you can keep going on your journey uninterrupted."
theworldisflat,3cfaus,BillionaireBob,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:50:04 2015 UTC,"Please don't take my explanation to be condescending in anyway, so far you have been very polite and inquisitive, I just want to answer your question in the most clear way.  I don't know if I fully understand your question, but no, you would not have to correct for movement like this on a spherical earth. Imagine yourself standing on the surface of a sphere. The point you are standing at can be defined by some meridian (longitude) and some parallel (latitude). If you walk east along this parallel across the surface of the sphere and keep walking east you will eventually get back to the exact point you started at without any correction. At no point along your journey does ""east become west"" if you're referring to your direction of travel. You start going east and you stay going east.  However, you could say that ""east becomes west"" if you reference your original point on the surface. Remember, we defined that location as the intersection of some parallel and some meridian. That original meridian traces out a semicircle across the sphere if viewed from the side. Exactly opposite your meridian is another meridian (I'll call it the antimeridian) on the other ""side"" of the sphere which forms the other semicircle which completes a full circle with your original meridian. Again, imagine walking east along the parallel from your point, eventually (when you are halfway through your journey) you will cross the antimeridian. After you cross the antimeridian you can be considered to be west of your original point (in the western hemisphere) although you are  still walking east.  It is fine to use the cardinal directions when referring to your direction of motion and if you are describing position with respect to some other position on the sphere, however, don't think that there is some universal quality of a sphere that strictly defines east and west.  TL;DR East never becomes west  EDIT: Politeness"

I know that there is a being of infinite wisdom who created me and cares for me personally. Not only this, but He loves every single one of us more than Himself.  I know that this world is a shell protecting us from His presence, though He longs for our company. He cannot come near us, for sin cannot exist in the midst of His glory and righteousness. He is shielding us from Him in His mercy to give us a chance to repent of our wrongdoing and turn back to our Father in humility. He has given us total control over our choices and granted us the ability to choose life or death. It's a choice!  There is something beyond this life and the vanity of it. When probation closes and all have had the opportunity to decide their own fate... the sky opens up and His glory appears. Those who are counted righteous by the merits of the blood of Jesus Christ are resurrected and translated into heavenly beings; given new bodies to live in His presence eternally. The wicked are resurrected later for the purpose of eliminating their existence for good.  He does everything He can, respecting your free will, to reach out to every single person and bring them to Himself. He doesn't wish that any of us perish, but that all repent of their sin and choose life.  Besides... what good is a legacy for a dead man? What kind of hope is that? I can't think of anything more pointless."

This interconnectedness is exactly why we must learn about the sciences in school.  By studying one, you gain insight into all of them.  You can't just reject a core claim and expect the rest of the system to make sense.  Each one builds upon and reinforces the others.    That's why ideas get so entrenched in science, because many disciplines all agree on their results.  By saying the earth is flat, you're not just rejecting astrophysics, you're rejecting the foundations of modern medicine, information technology, advanced computing, the construction of new plastics, how we locate oil and natural gas, and dozens of other disciplines that produce things we use every day, and yet require these assumptions to be true to work properly."

Half a dozen unique coding languages that were originally developed for astronomy have moved to many different sectors, from medicine to communication to industry, as their specialized nature finds a new niche.

Fictional paradigms exists constantly in all fields of science and are eventually usurped by more superior paradigms which again always contain some degree of fiction.

On a round planet the shortest distance is over Antartica or skirting the edges. But, according to the videos, you aren't allowed to make or request that flight and if you try to book it, either the seats will be filled or there's some other roadblock that seems perfectly normal.

They will state that these flights cannot be booked, or something else will happen to prevent you from actually boarding. Why don't they try and book the flight themselves, and see what happens? And if they get rebuffed, there is nothing to stop them from chartering their own flight across the Antarctic. Or borrowing a sailboat and traveling from Tierra del Fuego to Sydney, and physically measuring the distance themselves. If they do it at the right time of the year, they can even see whether there truly is a midnight sun below the Antarctic circle.  How about something simple. Build their own pendulum and see if it traces out a processional pattern. Or take detailed gravity measurements while traveling East and then West, and see if the Eötvös effect is a real thing. Or try and launch a model rocket in a hard vacuum, and see if momentum is actually conserved in a vacuum.  There are so many simple things that they could do.

Chemicals and elements emit fairly specific wavelengths of radiation.  Recording the spectra that is released from the radiation of an object, like infrared, will reveal specific bands that are and are not emitted.  From these, you can infer what elements were present in the object to produce that specific spectra.  Further applying known chemical properties, you can then begin to construct the compounds that would result from those elements, and begin to get an idea of the makeup of a particular object.  Once you have these insights, you can further extrapolate how these chemicals would interact (for example: forming gasses, or solid surfaces).  In fact this technique is how we know that other stars are pretty much made from the same matter we have on earth.

If they arent rotating as a sphere would rotate shouldnt you be able to pick up on that fact with a relatively inexpensive telescope over the course of one single clear night?   Why havent any flat earth advocates done this yet? This would provide absolute proof without any more doubts.

Just because you can't do the math doesn't mean that the math isn't accurate.  Remember that General Relativity made predictions.  Those predictions were borne out.    What predictions about the universe can Flat Earth theory make?  Our understanding of Gravity predicted the existence and location of a planet and found it.  Relativity predicted the bending of light and we found that too.  We've since observed gravitational lensing as well as time dilation.  General relativity is accepted fact because the math has been proven accurate and the predictions made by the theory have been borne out.

You are correct that relativity didn't possess a particularly solid experimental and empirical foundation until the corroborating data from the observed bending of light during the eclipse in 1919 provided valuable confirming data for Einstein's theory, but few physicists doubted its veracity. It was such an elegant and powerful theory, and explained so much.  Besides being philosophically satisfying and mathematically sound, relativity correctly accounted for anomalies observed in the precession of Mercury at perihilion, the phenomenon of gravitational red-shift in the light of distant astronomical objects, and gravitational lensing, observed by Eddington in 1919."

We know the Earth spins thanks to Foucoult's pendulum and more than 60 years of observation of the Earth from space, the Eotvos effect, and other data.  Even Michelson and Morley didn't claim their experiment disproved the Earth's motion.  What evidence can you provide to support that idea?  Surely the experimenters themselves would've seen that conclusion if it was indeed justifiable from their results.  Michelson-Morley only fails until you factor in Einstein's special relativity.  Once you have that, the null result is clearly the obvious one and poses no problem for the standard model, Earth's motion, or heliocentrism.  No one is discarding the results -- they jibe perfectly with our modern understanding.   Dozens of more-precise experiments along the lines of Michelson-Morley were conducted for decades after and they all reach the same null result.

Why don't you pose your question to actual astronomers at /r/askscience or any of the many astronomy related subreddits?  Methinks you don't care to actually grapple with the science.  I don't think I understand your question.  You haven't posed it very clearly.  Why, exactly, do you think the noonday sun should appear at noon six months later?  The tilt is only about 23.5 degrees. I think that you have fundamentally misunderstood the standard model.  The axial tilt takes about 23000 years to wobble.  The tilt does not cause seasonal change itself.  The Earth is tilted on its axis and this tilt wobbles slowly over millenia (this is why Polaris is slowly shifting and why Thuban was the pole star thousands of years ago, as evidenced by Egyptian star maps and borne out by math).  It is both the axial tilt and the fact that the Earth's tilt in relation to the sun changes over the course of the year that causes seasons.  When the Earth is on one side of the side during its yearly rotation, one hemisphere is tilted towards the sun and gets more direct sunlight causing Summer in that hemisphere and winter in the other.  When the Earth has traveled to the other side of the Sun the other side of the Earth is now the side tilted towards the sun and is enjoying its summer.  Is this another thing from Dubay again?  Because as demonstrated in your last post the guy is clearly ignorant or deliberately misleading, both of which should disqualify him in your mind as a serious thinker on this topic."
theworldisflat,3c5qa2,DethFiesta,2,Sun Jul 5 03:07:39 2015 UTC,"why does the noonday sun not gradually shift to appearing at midnight six months later, reversing its timing, and then shift back again?   It does - if you travel far enough North or South.  This is fairly easy to verify. Here is the TimeAndDate entry for the month of June for Quito, Ecuador. Quito is nearly exactly on the equator. Notice this entry:   June Solstice (Winter Solstice) is on Sunday, June 21, 2015 at 11:39 AM in Quito. This day is 2 minutes shorter than on December Solstice.   So, over the course of six months, the amount of daylight differs by only 2 minutes.  Now, look at Bismarck ND, at 48 degrees North. You will now see that over the course of six months, the amount of daylight changes by 7 hours and 20 minutes. And at Chatham Island, NZ at 44 degrees South, the difference is 6 hours and 37 minutes. Do you see the pattern?  St Petersburg, Russia is at nearly 60 degrees N. The difference in daylight between the solstices is now nearly 13 hours. At Ushuaia, 55 degrees S, the difference is 10 hours and 7 minutes.  See the pattern? The further North or South you travel, the greater the difference in daylight between Summer and Winter. Eventually, at about 66.5 degrees North or South, the difference becomes 24 hours. At the geographic Poles themselves, the sun only rises and sets once a year.  If you have a globe, you can easily do this experiment at home. Simply move a lamp slowly around the globe while also spinning it on its axis, and note which parts are in darkness and which have sunlight. It really is that simple."
theworldisflat,3c5qa2,AngelOfLight,3,Sun Jul 5 03:08:27 2015 UTC,"Technically, it does get shifted.  The problem is this: noon can be objectively defined as the time when the sun reaches it's highest point in the sky on a particular day at any location.  Since this measurement will automatically compensate for the earth moving around the sun, it's not really that useful to illustrate your point.  However, there is a definite measurement we can use, when the sun reaches the highest point anywhere on earth during a year.  In the northern hemisphere, we call this the summer solstice.  About six months later we have the winter solstice, or the lowest point the sun reaches.  The summer solstice occurred late at night (UTC) on June 20th of this year, while the winter solstice will occur early in the morning on December 22nd.  Since the earth's orbit isn't a perfect circle, it's not exactly 12 hours off.  The earth's tilt will eventually shift off it's current angle, but you're post is right that the amount of shifting we're talking about in our life time is negligible."
theworldisflat,3c5qa2,TheUnmashedPotato,0,Sun Jul 5 05:03:51 2015 UTC,"You're in denial of what the actual situation is:  from summer to winter solstice there is a full continuity of consecutive 24 hour cycles to which the noonday sun at summer solstice DOES NOT reach its midday height at what should be midnight rather than noon on winter solstice - even as the Globe Earth is allegedly spinning and maintaining its tilt around solar orbit.  This is what should occur, and yet no such thing happens."
theworldisflat,3c5qa2,TheUnmashedPotato,3,Sun Jul 5 05:25:58 2015 UTC,"But it does.  The sun is reaching it's maximum height at significantly different times from one solstice to the next, just as you'd expect it to on a round earth."
theworldisflat,3c5qa2,TheUnmashedPotato,-1,Sun Jul 5 05:35:29 2015 UTC,"In the Globe Earth model, the tilted spinning Earth ultimately IS our ""clock""...starting from a noonday sun on summer solstice what is allegedly taking place?  The Earth continues on its orbit, maintaining its fixed tilt, still ticking off its 24 hours.  That original noonday point is now more and more oriented away from the sun as Earth moves counterclockwise ( right-hand rule) around the sun.  When it reaches six months later, that same original noonday position should now be on the dark side of the Earth, what we think of as midnight.  It should be on the dark side then EXACTLY because the spinning Globe Earth is maintaining its tilted orientation and rotates on a steady 24 hour cycle.    In other points, at fall equinox, this original noonday position should be at what we think of as early morning, as it would be on the edge of the sun appearing over the spinning horizon.  In other words, if the Earth were a Globe, heliocentric, the sun's appearance should be ever-shifting with each 24 hour cycle of the tilted Earth in solar orbit - the Earth IS the clock in its fixed orientation in this model...an original set point of noonday position would never change in space, but the sun's relation to this position certainly would.  It's really mind boggling and shocking how really every person never catches this, even shocking to me that I never saw it before, but now I see it."
theworldisflat,3c5qa2,TheUnmashedPotato,3,Sun Jul 5 06:01:29 2015 UTC,"You are 100% correct, we should observe that occurring.  We do!  The Summer Solstice for 2015 occurred at 10:35 PM, UTC.  The Fall equinox will occur on September 23rd, at 8:20 AM.  The Winter solstice will occur on December 22nd 4:49 AM.  The next Spring Equinox will be on March 20th, at 4:31 AM.  Keep in mind that, since the earth's orbit isn't a perfect circle, we don't get a perfect 6 hour difference in the time (or even a perfect 1/4 of a year between them).  Edit: I re-read your question, and I hope this clarifies your specific question.  The time we use to track our day is an approximation.  Since the earths orbit isn't a perfect circle, and the earth's rotation doesn't sync up perfectly with it's orbit, the sun actually has some measurable variance in it's apparent movement.  We have approximated the sun's movement by creating a mathematical ""average"" sun on which to base our time.  Noon is therefore based off an approximation of the sun.  In actuality, true solar noon deviates quite a bit from our approximation, but we maintain our approximation because the math is much easier to deal with."

Yes perhaps all of these points are drifting in the mathematical fudging that officially takes place, but this is not what theoretically should be occurring.  If the Earth is a tilted ball spinning through solar orbit, immediately the day after the noonday summer solstice (as an arbitrary set point), the sun should begin hitting its climax in the sky later and later with every day.  And in six months time this original noon position will be completely in the dark of night, our clock and sun behavior totally inverted.  Yet NO SUCH THING occurs.

Bear in mind that a simpler approximation is used to describe earth's orbit mathematically in our clocks, since the discrepancy isn't too big at any time, and the math is much easier on the computers.  That means our numbers will vary a little from reality over the year, but should sync back up after a year.   The real meat of it has to do with the length of a day on earth.  If you define a day as the length of time it takes to sun to reach it's high point in the sky twice.  you'll get a figure that is almost exactly 24 hours.  However, if you define it as when the earth completes a rotation on it's axis, you get a figure that's about 4 minutes less.  Because the earth is moving on it's orbit in the same direction as it rotates, the sun appears in the sky longer than other objects, like stars.  If you measure just the rotations of the earth over a year (say by measuring stars or other distant objects at their highest), you end up with about one day more than you'd get by just counting noon's that pass.  If you measure things solely by the earth's rotation, the exact effect you're describing comes significantly into play, which is why the constellations appear to shift through out the year.  However, this time discrepancy with the sun allows noon to fall into a different pattern, which is the one we approximate on our clocks.  I hope this helps to clarify things.  Thanks for re-articulating your question so many times, it's not a simple concept that your typical astronomy course goes over.  If I still misread your question, let me know."
theworldisflat,3c5qa2,DethFiesta,2,Sun Jul 5 17:04:41 2015 UTC,"It is also worth mentioning that those 4 minutes less is why we add a leap year every 4 years, right?"
theworldisflat,3c5qa2,TheUnmashedPotato,2,Wed Jul 8 07:00:18 2015 UTC,"Actually, leap years don't have much to do with sidereal days (earth's absolute movement).  The calendars we use don't care about earth's actual rotation, just the sun's apparent movement.  As such, this discrepancy between sidereal days  and solar days doesn't factor in too much.  Leap years are caused by the fact that Solar days (based off the sun's apparent movement) don't sync up with a year.  The fact that we end up about a quarter of a solar day off every year is why we have a leap year."

Even CERN is this way, which why so many ridicule it and are suspicious of it.

""Societal comprehension"" is in no way a requirement for science.  Same thing with application.  Science is the quest to find and explain what is provably true, not to make people feel good about the world view they inherited from their parents.  The universe is likewise under no obligation to hold to only things which can be ""independently reproduced"" by non-professional scientists working alone.  Calling something ""more likely bullshit"" without any evidence for such is anti-scientific.  In short, your criteria for scientific validity are not in any way scientific.  I fail to see why Science should have to be underfunded and understaffed to be valid -- and neither CERN nor NASA created the modern science that the Flat Earth denies is real.  Einstein's greatest achievements were made in 1905 when he was not a professional scientist and was not part of any kind of scientific organization.

Why is there only a single hemisphere of stars instead of the two we observe?  Where is the rest of the Solar System and how does it fit in?  How does this model account for the tides?  The Magnetic Field?  Eclipses?  What force keeps things in motion?  If this was released as an interactive piece of software like Google Earth I'd be interested to check it out.

By the standard model our atmosphere would have to endure a 1000 mph spin and a supposed 67,000 mph force from us spinning around the sun and a 500,000 mph force catching up with the suns speed around the galaxy, so you are saying the atmosphere magically protects us from roughly 600,000 mph forces yet we can all enjoy stillness on days of 0 mph winds?  In this same regard, a vacuum would magically be protected by our atmosphere?  If you have ever opened a vacuum sealed can you will understand once a breach is made the vacuum is nullified yet we can supposedly pierce this back and forth with spacecraft and rockets? Now who believes in magic???"
theworldisflat,3c56cw,Angadar,7,Sun Jul 5 12:15:38 2015 UTC,"It doesn't matter how fast everything is travelling. Velocity doesn't impart a force, acceleration does. If you're in a car travelling at a constant 50mph, you won't feel like you're moving other than bumps on the road. You'll only feel a force when you accelerate/decelerate or turn, i.e. change your velocity.  The Sun moves round the galaxy at about 220km/s, imparting a centripetal acceleration of 1.9*10-10 m/s2, about 10-11 times less than what we feel all the time due to gravity. For the Earth around the Sun it's 5.93*10-3 m/s2, barely 0.06% of what we feel due to gravity. Finally, for the Earth spinning it's 3.1*10-2 m/s2 at the equator, 0.3% of what we feel due to gravity, and this decreases to zero towards the poles. The forces due to these tiny accelerations are negligible, hence why you don't notice them and we can ignore them most of the time.  The reason we don't feel the air whipping past at hundreds of miles per hour is because it also moves along with the Earth as it rotates.  There is no ""seal"" to be pierced when rockets go to space; there is no barrier between the atmosphere and the vacuum of space, it just gradually thins out as you go higher. The entire atmosphere doesn't float away into space because it's held down by gravity. Some gases can and do, though most of them are too massive to easily reach the speeds required. Hydrogen and helium, due to their low mass, can be hot enough (have mean kinetic energies high enough) that they can reach escape velocity and fly away into space."

Speed is not rotational speed. The Earth has an rotational speed of ~0.004 degrees/s, which really is not as fast as you seem to think it is.  2, 3, 4, 5. Speed is not force. They're not the same units and not the same thing, and cannot be compared. Speed actually really doesn't have much to do with force.

To be honest right from the beginning,  I am a round earth believer and I know that not all flat earth believers  are stupid (not everyone is parrotting nonsense s/he heard from a friend which read something on the internet what a friend saw on youtube).  I think this all is just part of a huge controlled disinformation campaign in order to make people resistant for the upcoming disclosure and the massive information dump which is to come linked to this. Because if one gets the masses to disbelief in science and get them to not being able to distinguish honest  and true science from fakes, then the masses also won’t  believe in disclosure and other true informations coming out. Lots of us are looking for informations, and at some point you will come across the illuminati & cabal groups, and if you are up to date you’ll probably know about the sphere alliance and the SSP’s.  It is obvious (at least to me and many others) that the cabal groups have infiltrated the conspiracy theorists and it seems this is all well prepared. People around the globe are slowly waking up and are realizing that somethings not right here.  People know that NASA, our politicians, the media, schools and what have you weren’t always truthful and honest.  So I believe that this huge disinformation effort is to discredit science with the weaopns of the conspiracy theorists. It is basically their last stand because they know if that doesn’t work they, the cabal group, will be history.  But no matter what,  this time they’ll lose anyway. I have read a lot about flat earth theory and in every forum, and on youtube etc.  at some point the flat earthers are fighting fiercly with the round earthers  about their beliefs. This tactic is old, very old and it seems to work on us almost every time unless someone notices it. Not only on this topic but also on many others. Get the people to fight each other so they don’t care about the one initiating all of this. I think what  we should focus on is prevent this useless namecalling, fighting, insulting and so on because aggression does not get you anywhere in this discussion. No one knows everything  and the one who claims to know everything is a liar. Only full disclosure is real disclosure and anything other than that will be orchestrated by the cabal groups. Its as easy as that. Technically we could be much further than we are at the moment and if the real full disclosure occurs we have to be able to distinguish the fake from the real thing."

theworldisflat,3bzzgr,SquareHimself,8,Mon Jul 6 01:17:55 2015 UTC,"Your density model requires some kind of gravitation to work.  The reason some things float and others sink in a fluid is related to their density, but requires gravity as well.  We'll use water to illustrate the point, but all these principals work with air.  Gravity causes fluid to be pulled downward.  This creates a pressure in the fluid that gets stronger the deeper you go down (because you have the weight of all the fluid above it).  When a buoyant object, like a boat, is placed in the water, it displaces a certain volume of the water.  However, due to Newton's third law, every action must have an equal and opposite reaction.  In this case, the water applies a force back against the object.  Since the water has a greater pressure the lower you go, the bottom of the boat is getting a more powerful force than the top of the boat.  If the boat displaces enough water (more than it weighs) then this force becomes enough to overcome gravity, allowing the boat to float.  This also applies to the air.  The boat doesn't displace enough air for the buoyant force to over come gravity, so it sinks in air.  The problem is, without some universal force pulling everything in the same direction, none of this would occur.  What's more, we know it wouldn't occur, because of the Vomit Comet, a plane that flies over the gulf of mexico to simulate zero gravity by free falling.  My own science teacher did experiments on this very topic for his masters degree.  We see that, when in free fall, convection (which is just buoyancy but within a single fluid) and other forces related to density don't behave in an orderly fashion, like we see when gravity has a strong effect."

That's not quite right. It's because the velocity it started with doesn't just disappear.  Suppose you're standing in the back of a moving truck (in an enclosed space, so there's no wind). If you throw a ball up, do you expect it to go backwards? No, because it keeps the forward velocity it got from the truck.  Similarly, a canon ball fired upwards keeps the horizontal velocity it had before. Rockets do too, which is why it is significantly easier to put a satellite into an orbit going east than going west.  However, once a satellite is off the ground and out of the atmosphere, it's no longer getting connected to the Earth. There's nothing to push it to stay with the Earth's rotation."

Here's a marksman discussing it with the relevant math.  The Eötvös effect must also be taken into consideration for high precision.  The Wikipedia Article on External Ballistics includes discussions of both of these phenomena.  These effects are subtle because the Earth turns slowly (hold a basketball in your hands and spin it so that it would take 24 hours to turn once....does that seem fast to you?) relative to the amount of time that a bullet or cannonball is in flight.

theworldisflat,3by6v9,TheUnmashedPotato,5,Fri Jul 3 22:14:33 2015 UTC,"The short answer is inertia.  If an object is on a spinning surface, it can gain momentum from that surface.  If you then launch that object, it retains that momentum, unless a great deal of energy is put into it to remove it.  For most of our day to day lives, the cumulative effect is pretty small.  We're rarely that far off the surface, and don't typically travel that far when we are.  This is why you won't see the Coriolis effect in a sink or toilet, the other forces at work are simply too strong.  The other thing to keep in mind is the atmosphere.  After billions of years, it has inherited the momentum of the earth's rotation, and continues to impart it on objects within it.  This is why airplanes don't get a boost when traveling against the spin of the earth, they still have to get through the atmosphere.  Unless an object significantly breaks free from the atmosphere, the effect can be mitigated.  Lastly, objects traveling directly with or against the earth's rotation won't be subject to the Coriolis effect.  I'm not sure where you heard that satellites passing over the poles don't move eastward.  In fact, the reason we place satellites in polar orbits is so they will pass over different parts of the earth.  These are best for any satellites mapping weather patterns or taking pictures of the earth itself.  As for the satellites, I think you got a simplified explanation.  We intentionally overcome the initial velocity to travel with the earth's rotation, which takes quite a bit of energy to accomplish.  Each orbit, the earth will spin under the satellite, allowing it to record a new area.  Edit: Misread the 4th paragraph in your initial post."

""Over the next decade, a new system called ADS-B (Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast) is expected to replace radar as the primary surveillance method for air traffic control  ADS-B will see aircraft work out their position using GPS and then relay data to the ground and other planes.  But, as with existing secondary radar, ADS-B coverage does not extend over the oceans.""  The radar fades at 150 mi., they use radio transmission of flight data from there on...the upcoming automatic ADS-B GPS system will not extend over oceans...meaning, they don't do that shit now.  GPS is only in the vicinity of coastlines and land based towers...  Plane and ship captains don't use GPS out over sea if they are using radar so much...there would be no point.

theworldisflat,3bwfd1,N546RV,3,Thu Jul 2 20:55:57 2015 UTC,"As /u/N546RV has explained, ADS-B has an input and an output. It receives GPS data automatically and, at regular intervals, transmits that GPS information using a radio transponder. Beyond a certain distance off shore the ADS-B system loses effectiveness because the transponder signal won't be received by air traffic control; this is similar to losing radar contact beyond 150 miles. However, this has no effect on the GPS subsystem; ADS-B is still receiving the satellite data and transmitting it via radio, but those transmissions aren't getting to the intended target(s).  ADS-B should not be confused with the GPS ""uplink"" discussed in the article, they are entirely different things. GPS uplink would presumably solve the range issues faced by current radar and transponders although, as the article pointed out, this method is quite expensive."
theworldisflat,3bwfd1,DethFiesta,4,Fri Jul 3 03:57:49 2015 UTC,"Yes. They are discrete systems, but ADS-B depends on GPS. The GPS receiver determines its location and passes this location to the ADS-B transponder, which in turn sends out a coded message containing the GPS position data. Then an ADS-B ground station receives that coded message and now someone on the ground can see the aircraft's location.  Out over the ocean, the aircraft is not in range of an ADS-B ground station. The GPS still determines its position, and the transponder still sends out its coded message, but with no ground station receiving the message, it's of no use to anyone on the ground.  The GPS receiver is still working, it just can't communicate its data to the ground any more."

theworldisflat,3bwfd1,TotesMessenger,5,Thu Jul 2 19:33:20 2015 UTC,"It seems lots of people are confused about the nature of GPS, not understanding that it's a receive-only system. A GPS receiver tells its user where the receiver is located. If that user wants to tell others where he's located, that communication is a separate operation from getting a GPS location.  ADS-B is simply a formalized system for relaying that GPS data from the GPS receiver on the aircraft to an ADS-B receiver on the ground. The radio reports that transoceanic flights make can be thought of as a really crude version of ADS-B, where the pilot manually reads his location over the radio.  The reason we can have transoceanic reports work but not ADS-B comes down to the frequencies involved. ADS-B transmits at 1090MHz, whereas transoceanic reports, to my knowledge, are made using HF radio gear, transmitting on the order of <30MHz. Lower frequency = better propagation, but lower bandwidth. So it works for scratchy voice reports, but not for the kind of full digital position data contained in an ADS-B message.  Edit: clarity"

However, there are theories explaining why people believe in unfounded things like ghosts, telepathy, and certain conspiracy theories.

If your theory requires you to say ""Gravity is fake, everything is explained by Density"" but you cannot provide any math on how Density explains the millions of observations that Gravity does, your theory fails.  Here's a list of observations, just off the top of my head, that the Flat Earth hypothesis cannot answer with any reasonable amount of accuracy:   The Earth's tides The Moon's Orbit The Earth's Magnetic Field The Eötvös effect The Sun's energy (most of them think it is 3000 miles away and small, LOL)   And on and on and on.

Of course, once you postulate a sun that is very small you have no way to explain why the sun shines, since at that size it would not be massive enough to generate the pressure needed to cause fusion. LOL.    The small, close sun only makes sense if you are OK not having an explanation for how stars work.  Which is more obvious proof of the failure of Flat Earth theory....it causes us to abandon almost all knowledge of the Cosmos.  In that sense it doesn't even qualify as a competing theory."

That's not true at all. Let's assume we don't know the true reason why the sky is blue. I claim that it's because the same molecules that make up water make up the air, therefore, since the water is blue, the sky should be blue. That's what we observe, so therefore it is true. You are claiming that, even though you suspect my theory might be wrong, because you cannot definitively give the reason for the sky being blue, your opinion is invalid and mine should still hold  as valid?"
theworldisflat,3boc6a,maplebar,4,Fri Jul 3 01:28:37 2015 UTC,"If no one knew why the sky was blue, hypotheses would be put forward based on whatever theories existed to explain light and matter in this fictitious world you are describing.  If neither hypothesis could be proven based on existing theory then scientists would say ""there are competing hypotheses for why the sky is blue and we need more data to decide between them.""  But in a situation like ours, where the shape of Earth is described and explained perfectly by the Standard Model of physics and accurate predictions (such as the time date and duration of eclipses, the day and night cycles for any location on the planet, etc) can be made, we have a clear winner.  There is a dominant theory that is adequate, mathematically described, and internally consistent with all experiment and observation that are germane to the shape of the Earth.  That theory is the standard model of physics.  You comment is describing a situation where we have competing hypotheses.  Overturning the Round Earth means coming up with an entirely new theory.  A theory is something quite different from a hypothesis.  Please brush up on the Scientific Method and the philosophy of science."
theworldisflat,3boc6a,f_leaver,0,Fri Jul 3 01:54:43 2015 UTC,"But you are demanding from those of us exploring the flat-earth notion that we explain immediately every single facet of the theory. Some of us don't have all the answers, but have enough questions to put the globe theory back on the shelf for further review. I'm hearing arguments from all sides until I decide one way or the other. Until then, I'm taking into consideration the fact that the government has probably lied to us about going to the moon, which means the shape of the earth is suspect. Yeah it's possible that we are on a globe and that they also faked the moon landing, but if they faked one, we have to ask ourselves where the deception ends."
theworldisflat,3boc6a,maplebar,4,Fri Jul 3 02:11:54 2015 UTC,"But that is how you overthrow a theory:  you outdo the previous theory's explanations for all the observable phenomena.  When it comes to science, providing a more complete set of explanations is THE YARDSTICK for a theory's accuracy.  For example, you can explain the different length and angle of shadows in different latitudes by assuming the sun is much, much closer to Earth than the Standard Model assumes.  And actually, the math works when you do that.  But then you can't explain why the Sun glows because your new Sun is too small to be massive enough to create the pressure needed to create the fusion of Hydrogen atoms.  The ""small, close Sun"" is able to explain one observation but completely fails to explain many, many others.  That means that explanation doesn't work unless you create an entirely new theory for why the Sun produces light and heat.  The standard model explains both the shadows and the sun's energy.  The Flat Earth can only explain one of those.  That's huge.  If your alternative theory is true, it will be better at describing EVERYTHING.  Just as Einstein's General Relativity was more accurate at EVERY observation that Newton's concept of gravity had once explained.  Einstein's theory of gravity dethroned Newton by being better at, literally, everything.  That's how we know it is more accurate.  Einstein explained everything Newton did and even solved a few problems that Newton couldn't.  Could, one day, the Flat Earth theory be complete enough to do this?  Sure.  But right now it doesn't seem like it because, as the example of the sun shows, throwing out one little thing of the standard model creates a TON of problems.  The standard model elegantly explains a bazillion observations and makes a million amazing predictions that turn out to be accurate (read up on the discovery of Neptune).  The Flat Earth model doesn't account for many observations at all and makes zero predictions.  You've got a ton of work to do to create a new theory that can match the standard model in the scope of explanatory and predictive power.  And, as a side note, saying that the Moon landing didn't happen is not the same as the Earth not being Round or even suspect.  The Round Earth was first proven more than 2000 years ago and the proof of it does not in any way depend on observations from space."
theworldisflat,3boc6a,f_leaver,-3,Fri Jul 3 02:36:06 2015 UTC,"My point is that we are all attempting to do the work by having these discussions. As a whole, I don't feel like people who believe in the theory have investigated all of these points you bring up. I agree with that. I encourage them just the same to find out solid, testable explanations for why things are the way they are. However, if this place has been artificially constructed for us to exist within, which I think the flat-earth theory implies, we may be witnessing technology that we simply cannot explain. But, as you might understand, just because we cannot understand or explain something, does not mean it isn't that way. It just means we do not know. It's certainly valid for someone to assert than an object isn't something without being able to actually describe what it is. Take a random object that I'm unfamiliar with and I can say ""I don't know what that object is, but I know it's not a toaster."" I'm using my understanding about toasters in order to debunk your claim that the random object you are giving me is a toaster. ""Well, what is it?!"" I don't know, but it ain't a toaster! The same holds true for flat-earth claims. It is entirely valid to assert that the globular theory flies in the face of natural observation without needing to provide an alternative explanation for the shape of the earth. As Sam mentioned in ""Earth, not a Globe"" predicting eclipses has no bearing upon the reality of the globular theory. Ancient civilizations that thought the world was flat were able to predict eclipses just the same. That doesn't mean anything."
theworldisflat,3boc6a,f_leaver,6,Fri Jul 3 02:50:28 2015 UTC,"The Problem is that most Flat Earthers are not thinking theory-level, they are thinking hypothesis level.  They assume the close sun because it explains the differing length and angles of shadows, but they make no attempt whatsoever to explain how this small sun would work.  They just say ""no one really knows what the sun is or how it works.""  So, in order to score a single point they toss out an enormous number of observations and centuries of physics.  That isn't good science.  In fact, it isn't science at all.  It is merely conjecture.  Your idea that ""just because we cannot understand or explain something, does not mean it isn't that way"" is not what is happening in this debate.  What is happening in the Flat/Round debate is that one side has a complete set of internally-consistent and empirically justified assertions.  The other side has a few conjectures and just says ""the other guys are wrong.  No one actually knows anything about the Cosmos.""  The Standard Model has REASONS for saying the Sun is 150 million KM away and is a massive ball of gas going through a process of creating heavier elements out of Hydrogen through nuclear fusion.  In science, empirically justified beliefs that are shown to be consistent with observation are ALWAYS preferred to conjecture that does not agree with observation.    ""It is entirely valid to assert that the globular theory flies in the face of natural observation without needing to provide an alternative explanation for the shape of the earth.""  That's true if you are just bullshitting on YouTube, but it is not  true if you are doing science.  When it comes to science, you must ALWAYS have a justifiable explanation.  ALWAYS.  Otherwise, it isn't science.  That is precisely why the Flat Earth hypothesis is not a scientifically serious conjecture.  There simply is not enough evidence. No scientist would adopt an unjustified theory which would require us to completely abandon many things which ARE backed by evidence.  It is not scientific, in any way shape or form, to abandon a theory with hundreds of years of justification and proven predictions for one that has no evidence or predictive power.  Your task, as I lay out in this post, is to do the science.  Because the Flat Earth is completely incompatible with the standard model, if you want to overturn Round Earth you must provide alternate explanations FOR ALMOST EVERYTHING IN PHYSICS to even be considered scientifically serious.  Period.  The Round Earth is not the product of just a couple of photographs.  It is an integral part of and inseparable from modern science.  Please read up on the Scientific Method and philosophy of science.  Edit: you are indeed right that the ancients could predict eclipses.  But they couldn't explain them.  The Standard Model both predicts with greater accuracy AND explains them, therefore it is a stronger theory than the model used by the Egyptians."
theworldisflat,3boc6a,maplebar,2,Fri Jul 3 02:59:34 2015 UTC,"No you don't. You don't have anything that comes even close to toppling a spherical earth and as mentioned above, if you want to topple it - if you even want a reason to believe in your theory in the first place - you need a theory that has a better explanation of reality, not one that has a much worse explanation with many more holes and impossibilities."
theworldisflat,3boc6a,f_leaver,-1,Mon Jul 6 02:18:40 2015 UTC,"My point is that IF this is all deception, it must have been a plan that developed over a few centuries at least. That would give them a few centuries worth of time to come up with their explanations for why everything is the way that it is. Then NASA came along and its sole purpose was to confirm these ""facts"" about the natural world. It makes sense that they've had time to explain away all of the holes in their theory. I'm new to exploring the idea and therefore, I haven't had the time myself to investigate what I think the sun and moon really are. I agree that the flat-earth theory should explain the motion of celestial bodies above us, but I as a poor man have no ability to explore that aspect of it. For now, I question what I can. Although I admit that I don't know the physics at a college level of understanding, I'm not concerned with that necessarily because I don't think it's something that I personally can offer an alternative explanation for. I'm concerned with the fact that the government has lied to us about many different things in the past...so I ask if the moon landing is among the deception. If it is, it's possible that the shape of the earth isn't what we're told it is. Of course, that doesn't necessitate a flat earth, but if we call into question the shape, we must go back to our observations of the world we live in, many of which are consistent with living on a flat plane."

Why for fucks sake would anyone go through the immense trouble and resources to pull off this unbelievable feat of deception? This involves thousands ans thousands of people over hundreds of years in a coordinated effort for what purpose exactly? Who benefits? Do you realize how utterly ridiculous this whole idea is?  Given what you say about the limits of your knowledge and understanding of science, I'm left with this big enormous question - why on earth would you even begin to doubt something so obvious that has so much evidence supporting it - when you don't even understand the evidence! It seriously boggles my mind.  Try watching the Mythbusters episode that addressed the myth that the moon landings were faked. Of course that was faked to and they're part of the conspiracy no doubt.  This is the problem with conspiracy theories like your in general, they're not falsifiable. What i mean by this is that no matter what anyone says, no matter how much evidence is brought to bear ob the subject, you'll always have an excuse to shut it down. ""I don't know enough"", ""they're also part of the conspiracy"" shuts down the debate and excludes any means of finding the truth of the matter. This is the exact opposite of how science works. Science works primarily by trying to figure out what would destroy a theory, what would prove it wrong and then trying to find exactly that kind of evidence. Only if you don't find this evidence is the theory considered to be true. There are many examples in the replies to this post of people giving you every opportunity to do just that but you and every other fool I've ever seen supporting this nonsense never bite. You never go for what could actually falsify - neither spherical Earth (because you can't, real scientists have already tried) nor do you look for what would falsify a flat Earth (tons of examples, many in this thread, with ample evidence supporting the falsification) for reasons that are unclear to me, but my guess is they have a lot more to do with psychology than anything else.  Edit to add: Name actual observations that are consistent with a flat Earth.

What is the probability that all of that would happen, and that it would also orbit in such a way that locks one side as perpetually facing us? It's just too unlikely to happen as a natural event. These kinds of coincidences indicate to me that we need to seek more answers about things that we've been previously convinced of. When NASA crashed the lunar module on the surface of the moon during the Apollo 12 mission, they said it caused the moon to ring like a ""bell"" or ""gong"" for up to an hour after the impact. The moon's surface has shown an unexpectedly high level of heavy metals. If it formed in an impact from the earth, its interior composition should be similar, but instead, it is remarkably different. So the moon has high levels of heavy metals on its surface, it has only 2% of earth's density, and when we crashed something on it, it rang like a bell for an hour.  I think these observations need further inquiry. We must question the nature of the moon and if we do so, it only makes sense to question everything else. After all, why should the sun be 400 times larger and further away than the moon, if nothing we were previously told about the moon is true? All I'm saying is it is worth more investigation."

Presumably you're talking about volume, and not density, since that's what the link you gave above was talking about. This statement actually makes complete sense.  The volume, V, of a sphere is given by the equation:  V = (4pi/3)r3  where V is the volume and r is the radius of the sphere. Using units that make the radius of the Earth equal to 1, you can plug that into the equation to get:  V = (4pi/3)(1)3 ~ 4.18  Using those same units for the Moon, you get:  V = (4pi/3)(0.27)3 ~ 0.08  If you compare those to find the percentage:  (0.08/4.18)(100) ~ 1.9%  So yeah, I really don't know what the big deal is here."

Now, you ask a certain number of questions that are interesting, and that also tickles the scientists. Hence the developpement of more precise models to understand the creation of the moon.    But these questions are questions only. They don't oppose to the current theory about the creation of the moon.

In the article you provide, the assumption is that the earth’s rotation is perpendicular to the orbit it takes around the sun.  If this were the case, then we wouldn’t have season, and everywhere would indeed have about 12 hours of daylight (the poles, as an exception, would be in perpetual twilight).  However, this isn’t the case.  The earth’s rotation is off set from the orbital disk by about 23 degrees.  This means that, at certain times, the North Pole is closer to the sun, and the South Pole is farther away.  This arrangement would be the Summer Solstice.   Because the earth is leaning toward the sun, the northern polar region is actually entirely in sunlight (in fact, any place that gets at least one day to total daylight is marked by the arctic circle).  The temperature change between the seasons isn’t caused by one hemisphere being closer to the sun, but rather it being angled differently.  Because of the tilt, the sunlight hitting the northern hemisphere has less atmosphere to pass through, allowing more energy to reach the surface, while the opposite is true in the southern hemisphere.  When the winter solstice occurs, the tilt is aligned in reverse.  Equinox is when the tilt is aligned perpendicular to the sunlight, which is much more akin to the model discussed in the article you posted.  I’m not sure I understand what they mean that “…regardless of tilt…” no place would get more than a day of sunshine (aside from the poles).  Surely if the tilt were 90 degrees, the poles would have months of daylight, followed by months of darkness.  I'd be thankful to have this clarified."

According to Piazzi the size of the Sun is in proportion to the Earth, as 329,360 to 1, the diameter exceeds that of the Earth 112 times. The Earth appears, as Biot says, by this statement, ‘a mere grain of sand, as compared to the Sun.’ This enormous expanse of light focused on a rotating ‘grain of sand,’ at the distance of 93 millions of miles, would cause the same season throughout it. The paltry few miles, in comparison that separates London from Cape Town could never cause diverse seasons, neither would the distance from London to the Riviera justify the difference in the climate that characterizes the two places.” -E. Eschini, “Foundations of Many Generations”   ROFL. Guess who doesn't understand the first thing about celestial dynamics. The distance from the sun is irrelevant. What causes the seasons is that fact that the sun's energy is dispersed over a wider area - something that could only happen on a spherical earth tilted on its axis.  Seriously - when my daughter was in fifth grade we did this experiment with a heat lamp, a beach ball and a thermometer. Why could not Eschini not do the same? It's not exactly complicated."

Now, tilt that square meter to an angle of 23 degrees, but make is so that the perpendicular projection is still 1 square meter. In other words, the hypotenuse is now 1.09 meters long, and that 1 kW of energy is now spread over an area of 1.09 square meters. There is now slightly less energy over the surface. As the Winter progresses, that 1 kW of energy is spread over an increasingly larger area. That's why the Winters are comparatively colder."

Any other vantage point from 89 degrees latitude downwards could never, regardless of any tilt or inclination, see the Sun for 24 hours straight. To see the Sun for an entire revolution on a spinning globe at a point other than the poles, you would have to be looking through miles and miles of land and sea for part of the revolution! Anyone below the 89th parallel could never witness the Sun for 72 hours, 3 whole revolutions, straight because to do so would be to assume you are somehow seeing “through the globe” and to the Sun on the other side!

The bridge itself curves at 8 inches per mile and maintains its height over the water.  Simple stuff.  But of course, your little ""gotcha"" here completely fails to answer my question.  Why are Surveyors taught to compensate for the Earth?  Why does their modern equipment have this function built it?"

The LPC is 38.442 km long to Earth’s 40 000 km circumference, so its deck ought to be 38.442/40000 × 56.55 113.1 m longer than a path along surface of the lake directly below it.  How much is that? 5.4 cm, or in other units, 2.1 inches 10.8 cm or 4.2 in.  tl;dr: Modern Marvels isn’t gospel, but their arithmetic checks out. “They should have to deal with 384 feet of curvature” is very wrong.  edit: As jtcribbs pointed out, I forgot a factor of two.

theworldisflat,3bf1s7,TheUnmashedPotato,6,Sun Jun 28 17:16:19 2015 UTC,"I have heard it claimed here that GPS is 'faked' by using fixed ground transmitters. (How this works out in the deep ocean is not explained). Of course, as you pointed out, anyone can construct and program a GPS receiver. The receiver works by calculating the time difference between transmission and reception of a minimum of four satellites. It's difficult to see how this can be faked using fixed transmitters.  Also - the number of satellites available to a receiver can vary between four and twelve. Unless the Powers are randomly turning transmitters on and off, it's difficult to see how this could be faked. And, of course, a GPS receiver can also determine its elevation using the satellites' calculated Time of Flight. Again - fixed ground transmitters could not be used to calculate elevation.  There is another problem. If it was possible to accurately calculate global position using fixed ground stations, why would there be a need to deceive the public at all? Why not simply explain how it really works from the get-go, and avoid all talk of satellites completely? This would have the advantage of being true, and there would be no real risk of anyone finding out that you weren't telling the truth."
theworldisflat,3bf1s7,AngelOfLight,-1,Sun Jun 28 19:17:13 2015 UTC,"You could run it from a network of high altitude weather balloons. which report their positions from radar and ground tower triangulation.  At enough altitude there won't be very much wind, so these positions would hardly change and easily manageable.

theworldisflat,3bf1s7,jtcribbs,5,Sun Jun 28 19:27:50 2015 UTC,"It would be fairly inaccurate, though. The balloons would have to know their precise location. Even if there is a slight wind, the stations would still drift over time. And unless they carried fuel on board, there would be no way to re-position them. And if they could be maneuvered, how would they know exactly where to go?  And again - if it were possible, why not simply tell the populace the truth? If a working GPS could be achieved by a collection of balloons, why bother with the whole 'satellite' ruse? What would be gained by telling a massive lie that could be easily uncovered?"

Line of sight from 20 mile altitude is a 400 mile radius, so the network of balloons need not be all that large...1000 worldwide.  They officially built the alleged satellite network from 1978 to 1994...so even just putting up 60 balloons per year would get them to the same network.  And keeping it going till now...that would be tremendous coverage.  The balloons would not even need on board propulsion, the whole network would be a moving cloud of distribution.  As to why lie, when you maximize your lies you maximize your budgets."
theworldisflat,3bf1s7,jtcribbs,7,Sun Jun 28 21:13:11 2015 UTC,"I don't know, an object at 12,000 mile altitude moving fast seems more difficult to track and tell it accurate positioning than an object at 20 mile altitude moving slow.   That's one of the advantages of orbital mechanics. Since there is no air resistance, the only force acting on the satellite is gravity. Once the orbit is established, it can be tracked and predicted with extreme accuracy. By contrast, a lighter-than-air object in the upper atmosphere would be continually subject to random air currents. It's position would continually be changing unpredictably. And - the balloons would have to be continually replaced due to the action of sunlight on Mylar.   The balloons would not even need on board propulsion, the whole network would be a moving cloud of distribution.   That wouldn't work. Each GPS satellite continually transmits its current location - which implies that it needs to know its own location with extreme accuracy. This is fairly easy to do with an orbiting satellite, because the orbit is very predictable. A balloon that is moving randomly would not be able to know its current location with any accuracy.   As to why lie, when you maximize your lies you maximize your budgets.   The problem is that also maximizes the chances that you will get caught in a lie. As every good grifter knows, the trick to telling a compelling lie is to keep it as close to the truth as possible. Also, I suspect that a balloon network would actually have a higher budget in the long run. The GPS system had a very large up-front outlay of cash - which went into getting the network of satellites into orbit. Once up there, however, the ongoing maintenance costs are fairly low. There is in fact a very small team of military technicians who keep the network running. They do things like monitor the network for anomalies and apply continuous adjustments to the onboard clocks to account for time discrepancies arising from relativistic effects.  Once in orbit, the estimated lifespan of each satellite is 7 to 10 years. Balloons, on the other hand, would need to be continually replaced at a much higher rate. Realistically, a balloon in the upper atmosphere would have a lifespan of no more than a few months. That could get expensive pretty quickly.  At the end of the day, it would still be far easier to simply tell the truth from the beginning. If you wanted to fake a large number of satellites, you would need a way to make 51 convincing rocket launches. Even if there is no payload, that would get expensive real quick. Plus, there are hordes of amateur astronomers who track rocket flights as far as they can. They would quickly notice if you simply abandoned the rockets right after launch. Add to this the fact that there are a large number of amateurs who make a hobby of tracking satellites, and you will quickly find that faking a GPS becomes a very complicated task."

The system could be more elaborate and yet cheaper than we are even envisioning here.  Could be transmitters on some balloons, some airplanes, some ground towers.  There already is the WAAS ground system which narrows the error to 3 meters from 15 meters.  Plus the 3D, altitude can be determined, and that seems more accurate from a network going from ground to stratosphere ceiling.  A satellite network is claiming to be a sphere 12,000 miles higher in radius than the surface radius, and is using coordinates from some fictional ""earth center""...I mean that would be complete modelling to get that center position, massive amount of calculation for terrain of a 3D surface before the advent of high speed computing by the mid-1990's.  If the network was just within the atmosphere, this ""trilateration"" seems easier across tens of miles at most...not a 12,000 mile high sphere sending signals to determine altitude in a lower sphere.  That's seems really convoluted.    Any of these systems can't bring down Flat Earth alone because there's too many other discrepancies...(i.e. there's no fucking way a rocket can even exit a vacuum a high altitude).  It all has to fit together and yet Globe Earth breaks down when you narrow into each area..."
theworldisflat,3bf1s7,jtcribbs,3,Mon Jun 29 00:05:03 2015 UTC,"There seems to be some misunderstanding of how a GPS device works.  The transmitters don't do any of the calculations, they simply provide their own telemetry data.  The GPS device itself is what does the calculations, simply solving a relatively straight forward equation for at least 4 different transmitters.  This equation produces a mathematical sphere around all four transmitters, and the intersection of the spheres is your location.  In theory, you could apply this network to any planet.  As long as the satellites have predictable orbits, you will have accurate ground positioning, even in a place no human has ever walked before.  As to your reference to rockets, they do work perfectly fine in a vacuum and without gravity (actually, the lack of gravity is a much bigger hassle), since vacuums don't apply any force to an object."

Would the face even appear to be horizontal itself?! That sounds dramatic but it has to lean some amount.  Think about how insane the ball is now.  :-/  The fact that you can see the mountains face on shows us there's no curve or leaning back.""  LOL.  Let's perform this supposed Round Earth take down, just for fun.    Take an approximate circumference of the Earth, say 24,900 miles, and divide that by 360.  You get a bit over 69.  So, if we saw something that was perfectly vertical from a distance of 69 miles away, it would appear to be tilted just a single degree away from us.  So, for the 130 mile away example the tilt would not even be 2 degrees off of vertical.  That would be extremely difficult to spot at 130 miles.  It certainly is nowhere near the hyperbolic statement made by that commenter.  Easy math is easy.  This guy thinks mathematicians are needed.

If the ship were travelling 24 hours a day, it would need to maintain a speed of about 95 Km per hour (about 50 Mph). The fastest passenger liner is currently the QE2 - wit a top speed of 30 knots (about 35 Mph). There simply is no way that a cruise ship could travel that distance in 22 days."

If that actually turns out to be incorrect, then that's fine with me, because I'm not some sort of Pangea zealot or whatever the fuck you're on about. I can accept if new observations come up that discredit that theory, no problem.  Now what really concerns me here is how you went from putting forward your thoughts in your first post in this thread with some decent counter points, to immediately attacking me and making up some stupid bullshit about some church of Pangea, as if that's actually a thing.

The continents still are one large landmass. They're all connected under the oceans, which are just giant valleys. The concept of pangea is hogwash. The continents do not fit together with their edges.  You were sold some grade-school bamboozle-ry."
theworldisflat,3b0hll,TheUnmashedPotato,2,Fri Jun 26 00:19:25 2015 UTC,"Sorry, what I meant was ""all or most of the parts of land that protrude above the surface of the ocean used to be connected in one large supercontinent and are now separated in some places by bodies of water"". Obviously yes they're still connected by land under the oceans, but I think it's pretty clear what I meant, but if you want to be ridiculously pedantic go ahead.  The continents do actually fit together; not perfectly, because you've got all sorts of effects like collisions between plates, subduction, erosion, and so on, but more or less. Here's a quick and dirty example I put together of how the Americas and Africa fit together. As I said above, it's not perfect, and the map projection distorts the shape and size somewhat of the landmasses somewhat, but you can clearly see that they do fit together."
theworldisflat,3b0hll,jtcribbs,2,Fri Jun 26 02:00:16 2015 UTC,"The model you're referring to is continental drift: the idea that the continents are moving around across the surface, deforming only lightly to erosion as they do so.   This is about 50 years out of date.  Modern theories actually follow ""Plate Tectonic"" models, which are now accepted and regularly utilized today.  You see, the modern model uses the assumption that the surface of the earth isn't made up of a singular surface, but of several cracked plates.  It differs from continental drift because the ocean's aren't simply an obstacle that the continents move through, they are actually supported by plates as well.  However, because the materials that form these plates are not uniform, the heavier oceanic plates tend to sink below the less dense continental plates.  Additionally, plate boundaries are typically marked by significant geological upheaval, such as mountain formation, earthquakes and even volcanoes.  In fact, there's several multi-billion dollar industries that require this to be true, or they would be unable to produce their products.  Oil wells and natural gas deposits, an many ores and valuable metals, accumulate in certain kinds of faults and fractures in a plate.  The most successful geologists in the world are able to accurately read these faults, and predict their path, giving the companies an idea of where to start digging.  Without this, it would basically just be random luck to guess where the next oil well or iron mine should be found.  It seems strange that this model is rejected here, as the basic principals should work, even if the earth was flat.  All it really requires is a knowledge of how various chemicals interact (which we prove in a labs across the world every year in front of millions of witnesses) and the presence of a gravitation force (which is experienced by everyone across the planet for all of history).  TL;DR: We know the continents move, the fact that some kinda look like they used to fit together is actually incidental."

theworldisflat,3b0hll,FantasyDuellist,0,Sat Jun 27 17:01:52 2015 UTC,"My own current working hypothesis is this (not some kind of collective Flat Earth theory):  there had been this old theory of the globe Earth called the Expanding Earth hypothesis in which the proponent was demonstrating how the continents of Earth all fit together like a spherical puzzle if the oceans are removed.  The Earth radius was then only 60% of the accepted radius.  I haven't worked on it but I suspect one could begin with this shrunken Globe Earth map and then open it back up to 2D to making adjustments to ocean distances that seem on par with known transportation routes.  People assume there's some absolute known GPS positioning of the continents from fake satellite data when there is no such thing.  There is accurate aerial dimensions to land and continents.  Island chains would help on the ocean adjustments as well.  But I don't think a correct 2D map can begin with the standard Google Earth type Globe.  That's a sphere model stretched out to agree with known oceanic dimensions, but also probably erroneous in places."
theworldisflat,3b0hll,DethFiesta,3,Thu Jun 25 00:20:17 2015 UTC,"You can indeed sort of fit the continents together like a puzzle, this is because they all used to be connected together in the past. It's generally that supercontinents like Pangaea existed in the past. I've just looked into the expanding Earth theory, and it does make sense; an expanding Earth could cause the continents to break and move apart. However, I find it's since been almost totally abandoned in favour of plate tectonics, which evidently works better.  I'm not sure what you mean in your second paragraph, you can't ""open"" a globe map up into a 2D planar map without distorting it in some way, regardless of the size.  GPS coordinates to calculate distances do exist, but are you just saying that they're made up and that GPS isn't actually real? You don't need to use GPS to calculate distances though, you can use triangulation or even a measuring wheel (although you'd have a hard with this unless you had an absolutely huge map, because you'd probably not make it very far) to measure the distances.  I'm sure the globe map as seen on Google Maps/Earth is probably wrong in some places, it's stitched together from lots of smaller pieces and there's definitely areas where the algorithm hasn't quite worked and things don't line up properly. I expect it's pretty close though, closer than any measurements on an azimuthal equidistant map would be."

For example, for an observer with a height of 1.70 m standing on the ground, the horizon is 4.65 km away. For a tower with a height of 100 m, the horizon distance is 35.7 km. Thus an observer on a beach can see the top of the tower as long as it is not more than 40.35 km away. Conversely, if an observer on a boat (h = 1.7 m) can just see the tops of trees on a nearby shore (h = 10 m), the trees are probably about 16 km away.

theworldisflat,3arsbw,maplebar,3,Tue Jun 23 00:27:26 2015 UTC,"The azithumal projection only gives a correct distance from any given point to the north pole. Therefore when they say you can use the azimuthal projection for  ""Maps of airline distances from a single city to several other cities""  They mean you'd have to make a brand new azimuthal projection centered around the city in question and go from there. To make such a new map, you'd have to use our existing geographic information, i.e., the spherical model.  The reason why you'd do this is because it's easier to put such a map down flat on a desk, send it as a single image in an email attachment, etc."

theworldisflat,3arsbw,maplebar,-3,Tue Jun 23 00:54:06 2015 UTC,You seem to have a grasp on air travel so I'd like to take this time to ask you some other questions that I've come across. Why is it that an aircraft wanting to go west cannot simply ascend and hover while the earth rotates beneath them at 1000 mph at the equator?
theworldisflat,3arsbw,youfuckingslaves,4,Tue Jun 23 00:56:59 2015 UTC,"Would it be easier if we used a helicopter as an example, since they're capable of hovering?  Your question is equivalent to saying ""if I want to run down to the end of the train, can't I just instead jump into the air and let the back of the train catch up with me?""  When you're sitting in your seat on the train, you're moving right along with it at 100 mph. Likewise, when your helicopter is on the ground, it too is rotating around at 1000 mph, along with the earth. If it wasn't, the ground would appear to be moving under it!  Jumping up into the air doesn't change that velocity at all. When you jump up in the train, now you're moving up plus moving along with the train at 100 mph. Likewise when you take off in a plane, you take off with that initial velocity that you had on the ground.  It all comes down to (Galilean) relative velocities. One way to look at the helicopter on the ground is that both it and the ground are rotating around at 1000 mph. Another way to look at it is that the ground is not moving with respect to the helicopter. Both are correct and amount to the same thing."

Again, let the same gun be fired, but in the opposite direction; and it will be found that the ball or other projectile will always go farther in the first case than in the latter.  If a person leaps backwards from a horse in full gallop, he cannot jump so great a distance as he can by jumping forward. Leaping from a moving sledge, coach, or other object, backwards or forwards, the same results are experienced.   These are all, strictly speaking, mostly incorrect, and provably so, although one can forgive the author because these are sort of common misunderstandings. In all cases, you should ask yourself:  what is my speed relative to the train?  what is my speed relative to the ground?"
theworldisflat,3as2e1,El_Fez,2,Tue Jun 23 01:32:35 2015 UTC,"The entire coastline is outfitted with research stations. Each station should send a team to travel the ground in a straight line to Amundsen-Scott Station at the south pole and meet there. If they can all travel to that spot by heading south and only south from their location, then it's a globe. As everyone else in the thread here mentions, the kicker is that the transcontinental journeys must bisect the continent through the south pole center."
theworldisflat,3as2e1,maplebar,3,Tue Jun 23 04:13:27 2015 UTC,"Actually they've done that.  The 1955–58 Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition managed the first overland crossing of Antarctica, with one team, (lead by  British Explorer Vivian Fuchs) starting at Shackleton Base with Sir Edmond Hillary's team on the opposite side of the continent at McMurdo Sound on the Ross Sea.  Hillary's party reached the South Pole on January 3rd, 1958 and Fuchs' team reached the Pole from the opposite direction on January 19th 1958. Fuchs then continued overland, following the route that Hillary had laid, and on March 2nd succeeded in reaching Scott Base.  Two parties from opposite ends, meeting in the middle."
theworldisflat,3as2e1,maplebar,2,Wed Jun 24 01:05:46 2015 UTC,"Look at this map of Antarctica. Look at the Shackleton Range, the Amundsen-Scott base, and the McMurdo base. On the flat earth model, that is like heading clockwise from the part near South America with the other person heading counter clockwise from the part near New Zealand. Amundsen Scott base could be in the middle. Looking back at the photo of Antarctica, I've found that many of the expeditions follow the same north-west to south route. I'd like to see an expedition that starts at McMurdo, heads to Amundsen Scott base, and then heads to the Mawson base (Australia). On the globe, that is no problem. On the flat earth map, if we hypothesize that Amundsen Scott is actually halfway between Shackleton and McMurdo, you would have to travel counterclockwise in order to reach the ""south pole"" but then you would have to continue traversing the rest of the circle until you came back around. I don't know. They are interesting theories but I can't know until I make the trek myself."
theworldisflat,3as2e1,maplebar,2,Wed Jun 24 05:01:41 2015 UTC,"The problem with doing it your way? That means instead of a journey of 2,158 miles and 99 days that the CTAE recorded, you have to go from here, alllllll the way around the globe to (about) here. While I have no idea how many miles that trip would be, I'm going to estimate that it's significantly longer than the 2,000-ish miles and 99 days that Hillary logged. You have to go half way around the globe.  The math simply doesn't stand up."
theworldisflat,3as2e1,SquareHimself,2,Wed Jun 24 05:29:21 2015 UTC,"That's right. I've been looking to the ""Earth, not a Globe"" book to try and resolve the flat earth arguments. He uses data from several voyages between different cities and concludes:   Thus from purely practical data, setting all theories aside, it is ascertained that the diameter of the earth, from the Ross Mountains, or from the volcanic mountains of which Mount Erebus is the chief, to the same radius distance on the opposite side of the northern centre, is more than 10,400 miles; and the circumference, 52,800 statute miles.   An ice ring 50,000 miles long would imply a much longer travel time than what is being reported on these expeditions. If you have the time and are good at math, his math is worth verifying by reading the chapter."

This phenomenon arises from the operation of a simple and everywhere visible law of perspective. A flock of birds, when passing over a flat or marshy country, always appears to descend is it recedes; and if the flock is extensive, the first bird appears lower or nearer to the horizon than the last, although they are at the same actual altitude above the earth immediately beneath them. When a balloon sails away from an observer, without increasing or decreasing its altitude, it appears to gradually approach the horizon.    ""Cause of Sunrise and Sunset"" -Chapter 9 from ""Earth, not a Globe"""
theworldisflat,3ar5a7,maplebar,3,Tue Jun 23 00:14:59 2015 UTC,"ALTHOUGH the sun is at all times above the earth's surface,   This is interesting: When the sun stays above earth's surface, then ""midnight sun"" should be everywhere.   it appears in the morning to ascend from the north-east to the noonday position, and thence to descend and disappear, or set, in the north-west. This phenomenon arises from the operation of a simple and everywhere visible law of perspective.    From my position on earth, the sun (like a flock of birds) should sink towards the horizon, this being a perspective phenomenon, fine. But the problem is the light coming from the sun: When the sun always stays above earth's surface, thereby also never sinking below the horizon - note BELOW - but it would still shine some light to every place on earth all the time. The perspective phenomenon would at most create a visible difference of the sun's size, much like a flock of birds looks much smaller when it is very far away than when it is over your head. Which isn't to observe with the sun. And it would at the extreme distance make the sunlight dimmer. But a little sunlight would always be there. Midnight would always be brighter than it really is 1 hour after sundown, because you can only have a black night with zero light from the sun. You can try this with a flashlight (or better, with a single white LED, then you can even get the proportions right) and a table: As long as the flashlight (or LED) stays above the table's surface, there is light on the table. you need to move it below the table's surface (thus *below) the horizon to put its light out. Or you need to put something between the flashlight/LED and the viewer - but as soon as you do that, the object that blocks the light from the flashlight/LED pretty much defines a new horizon. And the object needs to be at least the size of the lamp of the flashlight or the LED. In case of the sun, it must also be at least as high as the sun's altitude, 4000 miles. Is there anything this high on earth?"

theworldisflat,3ar5a7,TheWalruss,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:05:33 2015 UTC,"Why is Rayleigh scattering not a bigger influence on our sky?  The constant force of gravity appears more or less constant across the planet.  This means that the force that keeps the atmosphere dense toward the surface is constant.  What's more the height of the atmosphere can be estimated by weighing it.  The force that the atmosphere has seems to be constant, and degrade at a predictable rate as you increase altitude.  This degradation should put the end of any significant atmosphere at about 300 miles, meaning a vacuum would be beyond it.  If the atmosphere extended beyond it, the weight of the atmosphere should be greater.  Additionally, the atmosphere scatters certain wavelengths of light.  The more atmosphere that exists between a light source and your eye, the more this becomes apparent.  When the sun in high in the sky, molecules of oxygen and nitrogen interfere with the light, forcing it to scatter more.  This effect is much more pronounced in the blue end of the spectrum (about 16 times as much) which is why we see the sky as blue.  However, at sunrise and sunset there is too much atmosphere in the way, which causes all the blue light (and pretty that half of the spectrum in fact) to scatter away.  We know this because we can reproduce it in laboratories.  Here a man does a demonstration.  This specific demonstration starts at 32:00.  You can use this effect to actually estimate the distance white light has traveled, and even the composition of the atmosphere at well."
theworldisflat,3ar5a7,FantasyDuellist,2,Tue Jun 23 16:31:31 2015 UTC,"Gravity is nonsense. On a flat plane gravity is no longer a theoretical necessity.  I'm not sure why we would suddenly see more scattering on a flat plane than on a ball. You're saying yourself that the rate of thinning approaches a vacuum at 300 miles up, so it's not out of the realm of possibility that there is a near vacuum in the uppermost parts of the atmosphere ending with a solid dome at the furthest reaches.  It would make more sense to me that the light coming from the sun should be otherwise than it actually is if the heliocentric model is true."

The measurements made all still stand.  As to the atmosphere, it would seem reasonable to assume that beyond 300 miles, it would be at vacuum pressures.  As to the behavior of light, that is actually one of the most well tested and understood phenomena that exists.  It serves as such a useful tool in understanding virtually every aspect of science, that we have had to study it in great detail.  The best part is, most of the experiments we do with light can be done right on earth."

theworldisflat,3arozr,maplebar,7,Mon Jun 22 23:35:04 2015 UTC,The answer is: Perspective.  It's the same reason parallel train tracks appear at angles like /\   I thought we've already talked about vanishing points?
theworldisflat,3arozr,TheWalruss,3,Tue Jun 23 06:45:24 2015 UTC,"I'm looking one more time at the photo I posted and thinking about your train tracks example.    I agree that our perspective is what causes parallel lines to appear to converge at the horizon on a flat plane. I agree that we observe this in train tracks.  However, in the train tracks example, we are standing on the tracks themselves, our upright body is perpendicular to the tracks that we are viewing. It is this specific orientation (body being perpendicular to the parallel lines being observed) that produces the converging effect. In the photo I posted, that would be akin to the actual surface of the sun being visible at our horizon.  However, in the photo, we are looking at rays hitting the ground, but our body is parallel with the rays, not perpendicular, so in my photo, our bodily orientation with respect to the orientation of the thing we are viewing is different. In my photo, let's say that those weren't sun rays, but train tracks connected from the surface of the earth to the surface of the sun. We know the train tracks to be parallel, but would they appear to fan out in the same manner that these rays appear to be doing?   Edit: /u/Mr_Lobster please chime in."
theworldisflat,3arozr,TheWalruss,2,Tue Jun 23 18:24:37 2015 UTC,"Indeed they would. The light beams are traced from the sun, touch the cloud edges that define them, and continue to the ground.

theworldisflat,3arozr,TheWalruss,2,Tue Jun 23 18:39:06 2015 UTC,"To clarify my point, take two high powered lasers on a clear night. Place them 100 feet apart, with point A designated as the midpoint between the lasers. Stand at point B 30 miles away (I'm estimating that the horizon is 30 miles away. If you disagree, what number would you like in place?) so that the lights appear to shine toward you from the horizon. I agree that, although they are parallel, they would appear to converge on point A 30 miles away. Now, imagine that you stayed at point B, but someone took the lasers at point A, aimed them at the ground at point A, and raised their elevation a mile into the air (while maintaining the parallel structure), when the parallel laser lights reach the ground at point A would they appear to you at point B to be parallel or fanning outward like the rays in the original photograph?"
theworldisflat,3arozr,TheWalruss,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:36:11 2015 UTC,"I'm not following your laser setup, but think of it this way:  The rays connect widely spaced points on nearby Earth's surface to the sun, which is practically a point source. The rays, being light, are straight. There's no other geometry that makes sense than that they fan out from the sun's position in the image to the ground. They can't be parallel, or they either wouldn't connect to the sun, or they would be just a very narrow beam."
theworldisflat,3arozr,jtcribbs,2,Wed Jun 24 07:08:31 2015 UTC,"Look at this diagram and read the comment that explains why the sun's rays that hit the earth are parallel.

The photo I've posted looks just like that."
theworldisflat,3arozr,TheWalruss,1 point,Wed Jun 24 07:25:41 2015 UTC,"The photo you posted is from the Earth's surface, not from some point in outer space, so the similarity you see is superficial.   Parallel rays will look like a fan when they're aimed at you and you're looking toward their origin. This is a direct result of perspective. Again, think about railways.  Also, read this and look at the provided images.  Read this) for more information about perspective, especially with regards to multiple vanishing points. (Think about a railway going over a plain to the horizon, and crepuscular rays fanning down over the plain at the same time).  Finally, read this. This is the math used to draw 3-d scenes in computer games and visualizations.   The math is reversed for machine vision: the visible size for a feature of known real size directly translates to a distance from the camera. Similar math is used for triangulation: when a camera sees a feature in position X and can constrain the Y somehow (using a second camera and epipolar geometry, making sure the feature is in a plane by projecting a laser line, etc.), then the (X,Y,Z) world coordinate of that feature is known.  This isn't just theory - I do this for a living: 3-d image acquisition and visualization. It works in both directions.  However, it can't readily be used to determine the distance to the sun, so in this subreddit this discussion is really just academic."

In-fact as more fuel is drained, unless the pressure is increased, the rate of the fuel drain will actually decrease.  Modern rockets can function without gravity by making a sort of artificial gravity through acceleration.  Typically, a small amount of thrust is applied to the craft by some method (small tanks of pressurized air, or reaction wheels, depending on design) to force the fuel to a location where the pump is.  The pump then forces the fuel into the main chamber where combustion happens.  The resulting explosion propels the craft, causing an even stronger artificial gravity force, which allows the cycle to continue for the rest of the burn."

The exhaust is sent out the back and momentum p_exhaust. You must agree that the gas has mass and velocity and therefore momentum. Due to the principle of the conservation of momentum, the net momentum of a closed system cannot change and thus must always sum to zero in this case. Therefore some other part of the system must receive an opposite impulse and end up with momentum opposite that of the exhaust, that part being the rocket: p_rocket = -p_exhaust. p_rocket + p_exhaust = 0. As the rocket now has momentum, due to the impulse of the exhaust gas being sent away with some momentum, the rocket is now moving in the opposite to the direction of the exhaust gas, i.e. upwards/forwards."

But I know that even if that were possible, you would just claim that the whole thing was a big simulation designed to get you to THINK the earth was round.   But to answer your question,  here is the answer taken from the book, ""Geometry for Dummies"":   You can figure out the earth's circumference using a geometric formula that's over 2,000 years old! Contrary to popular belief, Christopher Columbus did not discover that the Earth is round. Eratosthenes (276–194 B.C.) made that discovery about 1,700 years before Columbus.  Eratosthenes was the head librarian in Alexandria, Egypt, the center of learning in the ancient world. He estimated the circumference of the Earth with the following method: He knew that on the summer solstice, the longest day of the year, the angle of the sun above Syene, Egypt, would be 0°, in other words, the sun would be directly overhead. So on the summer solstice, he measured the angle of the sun above Alexandria by measuring the shadow cast by a pole and got a 7.2° angle.  The following figure shows how Eratosthenes's earth measurement worked.  Eratosthenes divided 360° by 7.2° and got 50, which told him that the distance between Alexandria and Syene (500 miles) was 1/50 of the total distance around the Earth. So he multiplied 500 by 50 to arrive at his estimate of the Earth's circumference: 25,000 miles. This estimate was only 100 miles off the actual circumference of 24,900 miles!"

Many years ago I used to participate in some fairly rowdy debates with a collection of internet flat earth believers. They were at least honest in the sense that they would attempt to explain a particular phenomenon in the context of the model that they were defending. They were convoluted, and easily debunkable explanations, but at least they made an effort.  It seems that the go-to response of the FE defenders here is to simply deny that the phenomenon exists at all. My post from yesterday is a perfect example. Instead of attempting to explain how the Eötvös effect happens in a flat earth, our dear friend Square simply denied that it happened at all. It's sad."
theworldisflat,3agfb6,maplebar,1 point,Sat Jun 20 20:28:24 2015 UTC,"""Causes of Solar and Lunar Eclipses"" from Earth, not a Globe.  1) A solar eclipse is the result of the sun passing between the moon and the observer on earth.  2) The moon has been observed to rise above the horizon in an eclipsed state, even though the sun was also above the horizon. Many have said this was due to refraction, but he explains an experiment one can conduct to show that, while objects bend upward due to refraction, the shadows of objects bend downward in fact. He concludes that if refraction were having the effect described, it should do so by ""elevating the moon above its true position, and throwing the earth's shadow downwards, or directly away from the moon's surface.  3) The earth cannot be casting a shadow over the moon because there are countless reports of the moon displaying large amounts of luminosity during total lunar eclipses, some of the times with witnesses describing a fiery red glow. This is not possible in the shadow of the earth. Refraction or lighting effects cannot explain the red glow because a shadow is supposed to imply an absence of light.  He concludes that the moon is being obscured by a semi-transparent body, where the luminosity of the moon is sometimes still visible and is affected entirely by differing densities of whatever object is passing between us.   He then acknowledges the idea that his theories might suggest that the moon is self-luminous. He offers evidence to support that conclusion.  1) A reflector is something that gives off what it receives; a reflector near a hot object will reflect heat and one near a cold object will reflect cold. A reflector will reflect light in the color it receives it and will reflect sound in the same tone that it is received. If the moon is a reflector of the sun's light, ""no difference could exist in the quality or character of the light."" Some people say that the moon might absorb light, but as a sponge can only absorb until it's full, so will the moon absorb until it's full. After, it will simply reflect everything back in the same quality that it receives it.  2) ""The sun's light is generally, and in an ordinary state of the atmosphere, of an oppressive, fierce, semi-golden, pyro-phosphorescent character; while that of the moon is pale, silvery and gentle; and when shining most brightly is mild and non-pyrotic.""  3) He gives various examples of differences in character between the light that the moon produces and the light that the sun produces. ""Grapes and other fruits by long exposure become solid and preserved. Hence, too, fish and flesh by similar exposure become firm and dry. The light of the moon is damp, cold, and animal substances exposed to it show symptoms of putrefaction."" He gives a few more examples of the weird effects of moonlight.  4) It's known that when you leave coal out in the sunlight, it becomes useless. When you leave coal out in the moonlight, it actually makes it burn stronger.  5) Place a thermometer in direct sunlight and the mercury level will rise when compared to placing it in the shade during the day. A thermometer in direct moonlight has been observed to be colder than a shaded thermometer at night.  6) During the winter when the sun is out all day, snow will tend to melt. At night, the snow exposed to moonlight tends to become colder and harder. Even the snow that falls in the shaded areas obscured by moonlight is warmer than the snow in direct, constant moonlight.  7) If you focus sunlight through a lens or reflect it with a mirror, it will look bright and it will get extremely hot. If you try to do the same thing with the moonlight, it will get bright, but there will be no change in temperature. Other experiments reported that temperature actually dropped.  8) In ancient Sanskrit, the sun means ""creator of heat"" and the moon means ""the cold"" or ""cold radiating.""  9) The moon can't be a reflector of the sun's rays, because as a highly polished ball of silver, a bright light shining on it would only produce a tiny really bright portion as a reflection. Instead, we see that the entire surface is equally and intensely luminous. The only way you can claim a lunar eclipse is caused by a shadow is if you admit that it reflects the sun's light in the first place, and this shows that is is not a reflector of the sun's light, but a self-illuminous body producing light of far different quality to that of the sun's.  10) There are reports from the Royal Astronomical Society and the Academy of Sciences and plenty of other sources that indicate that there are non-luminous bodies in the sky. It's this invisible body that comes between the moon and the observer, causing the moon to appear to be eclipsed.  11) So many people claim that the fact that people have been predicting eclipses for thousands of years means that the globe theory must be true. Just because you can predict eclipses with remarkable accuracy does not mean that your theory about the earth causing lunar eclipses is true; the author can make the same correct predictions about eclipses while maintaining his theory about the earth being flat and there being another celestial body in the sky. ""The supposition that such calculations are an essential part of the Newtonian or any other theory is entirely gratuitous, and exceedingly fallacious and misleading. Whatever theory is adopted, or if all theories are discarded, the same calculations [necessary to predict eclipses] can be made."""

And indeed, during a lunar eclipse, the sun and moon are exactly 180 degrees apart in the sky. In a perfect alignment like this (called a ""syzygy""), such an observation would seem impossible. But thanks to Earth's atmosphere, the images of both the sun and moon are apparently lifted above the horizon by atmospheric refraction. This allows people on Earth to see the sun for several extra minutes before it actually has risen and the moon for several extra minutes after it has actually set.    refraction explained   Refraction is the deflection or bending of electromagnetic waves when they pass from one kind of transparent medium into another. The index of refraction of a material is the ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum to the speed of light in the material. Electromagnetic waves passing from one medium into another of a differing index of refraction will be bent in their direction of travel. In 1621, Dutch physicist Willebrord Snell (1591-1626), determined the angular relationships of light passing from one transparent medium to another. Air and glass have different indices of refraction. Therefore, the path of electromagnetic waves moving from air to glass at an angle will be bent toward the perpendicular as they travel into the glass. Likewise, the path will be bent to the same extent away from the perpendicular when they exit the other side of glass.    3) The earth cannot be casting a shadow over the moon because there are countless reports of the moon displaying large amounts of luminosity during total lunar eclipses, some of the times with witnesses describing a fiery red glow.

Refraction or lighting effects cannot explain the red glow because a shadow is supposed to imply an absence of light.   and again he is wrong:   The reason stems from the air we breathe. During a total lunar eclipse, the Earth lies directly between the sun and the moon, causing the Earth to cast its shadow on the moon. If Earth didn’t have an atmosphere, then, when the moon was entirely within Earth’s shadow, the moon would would appear black, perhaps even invisible. Thanks to Earth’s atmosphere, what actually happens is much more subtle and beautiful.   It seems as if the answers are there, but your guys just ignores them in favor of lala land,    Earth’s atmosphere extends about 50 miles (80 kilometers) above Earth’s surface. During a total lunar eclipse, when the moon is submerged in Earth’s shadow, there is circular ring around Earth – the ring of our atmosphere – through which the sun’s rays pass. Sunlight is composed of a range of frequencies. As sunlight passes through our atmosphere, the green to violet portion of the light spectrum is, essentially, filtered out. This same effect, by the way, is what makes our sky blue during the day. Meanwhile, the reddish portion of the spectrum is least affected.   its important to remeber refraction   What’s more, when this reddish light first entered the atmosphere, it was bent (refracted) toward the Earth’s surface. It’s bent again when it exits on the other side of Earth. This double bending sends the reddish light onto the moon during a total lunar eclipse. Depending on the conditions of our atmosphere at the time of the eclipse (dust, humidity, temperature and so on can all make a difference), the surviving light will illuminate the moon with a color that ranges from copper-colored to deep red.

theworldisflat,3agfb6,maplebar,1 point,Mon Jun 22 11:01:30 2015 UTC,"/u/papipapichulo This is why I asked you to go and read the text. You are arguing my summary of his points instead of going to the text and seeing for yourself what he argues. In the text he says:   The only explanation which has been given of this phenomenon is the refraction caused by the earth's atmosphere. This, at first sight, is a plausible and fairly satisfactory solution; but on carefully examining the subject, it is found to be utterly inadequate; and those who have recourse to it cannot be aware that the refraction of an object and that of a shadow are in opposite directions. An object by refraction is bent upwards; but the shadow of any object is bent downwards, as will be seen by the following very simple experiment. Take a plain white shallow basin, and place it ten or twelve inches from a light in such a position that the shadow of the edge of the basin touches the centre of the bottom. Hold a rod vertically over and on the edge of the shadow, to denote its true position. Now let water be gradually poured into the basin, and the shadow will be seen to recede or shorten inwards and downwards; but if a rod or a spoon is allowed to rest, with its upper end towards the light, and the lower end in the bottom of the vessel, it will be seen, as the water is poured in, to bend upwards--thus proving that if refraction operated at all, it would do so by elevating the moon above its true position, and throwing the earth's shadow downwards, or directly away from the moon's surface. Hence it is clear that a lunar eclipse by a shadow of the earth is an utter impossibility."

theworldisflat,3aebkw,SquareHimself,8,Fri Jun 19 14:26:55 2015 UTC,"Did you read the article? It does happen - it is a measurable effect. It was first noticed by Baron Eötvös himself during gravity mapping voyages conducted in the early 1900s. It was then confirmed by subsequent mappings. What's more - the predicted value of the change in weight based on the earth's mass and rotation speed happens to exactly match the observed effect.  If you are going to engage in debate, try to address the phenomenon itself. You can't just bury your head in the sand and dogmatically assert that it doesn't happen.  EDIT: if you think about it, this phenomenon, combined with the Coriolis force would logically have an effect on long range snipers. They would have to account for left/right deflection caused by the Coriolis force, as well as bullet drop/lift caused by the Eötvös effect. Guess what? This is exactly what happens to a bullet over very long distances."

Funny thing, Eratosthenes didn't calculate the shape of the earth: he calculated the relationship between the shape of the earth and the distance to the sun. For example, on a flat earth the sun is much closer than on a globe earth, which explains the angles of the sun's rays that shine through clouds.  So yes, that's the geometry I'm talking about. It proves that things that should be under the horizon on a globe are entirely visible, which is consistent with the earth being flat, and that the horizon we see as we gain in altitude, which stays at eye level, is consistent with the earth being flat.  Why were we lied to in school? I only found out about this last week, and I can't believe I didn't see it sooner. I really want to go to Antarctica now, or south, and see what's down there."

There are so many people making terrible arguments and there are just as many people who are saying seemingly contradictory things because they are hashing out the theory in their own mind.

Check my history /u/RubyCodpiece and look at the comment where I summarized the points made in ""Earth, not a Globe"" about the explanation for lunar eclipses.

Our Sky Maps for the Northern Hemisphere are also accurate.   And we can still zero in on these objects because they are light-years away.  Also, our telescopes DO account for the movement of the Earth, LOL.  You should learn more about how modern astronomy works.  When you move from one side of your yard to the other, why can you still see the same mountains in the distance?  Because the distance you traveled is incredibly small compared to the distance of those objects.  Same thing with the stars and the Earth.  That's like 3rd grader level stuff dude.   Try harder."
theworldisflat,3abghb,jtcribbs,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:12:26 2015 UTC,"If the Earth is rotating on its axis at 1000 mph and people claim this to be the cause of time lapse curved star trails on photography, then why is there no time lapse effect from the Earth's other velocity vector of 67,000 mph on its alleged solar orbit?  The star trails should be curved and also blurred and crossing over each other due to this much higher velocity on the immediate path of solar orbit."
theworldisflat,3abghb,Daedalus1907,5,Sat Jun 20 02:24:49 2015 UTC,"Star trails aren't caused by the velocity directly. It's caused by the stars passing through the field of vision of the camera. The further away from the source, the greater absolute distance you'll have to travel through the entire field of vision.   When the earth is spinning, it is directly spinning the field of vision of the camera. So if that the camera has a 45* field of vision, then an object on the periphery will move across the entire field in roughly 6 hours (24/4).   Lateral motion, on the other hand, is moving across the field in a manner that can be approximated by arc distance (2 x distance x sin(angle/2)). As stated previously, this means that the greater the distance from earth, the more distance the star has to travel in order to move across the FoV. Since the distance between Earth and the stars is so massive, they don't move noticeably across the field of view due to lateral motion in a single night."
theworldisflat,3abghb,jtcribbs,1 point,Sun Jun 21 02:37:55 2015 UTC,"You have it wrong.  The star trails are actual distances of camera perspective changing through time, not from the camera rotating on it's axis.  The camera rotating on its own axis would have no trails centered on Polaris but on the star dead center in the direction of the camera.  In other words, the star trails centered on Polaris ARE lateral movement, just curved supposedly through the arc of the Earth.  And there should be another vector if we are in solar orbit, and a dramatic one at that, yet this is absent."
theworldisflat,3abghb,Daedalus1907,3,Sun Jun 21 03:42:57 2015 UTC,"The camera isn't rotating on any of its own axis; the Earth is rotating and the camera is on a fixed position on the Earth. Tape your phone to a basketball, rotate the ball and that is a model of the phenomena I am talking about.  Polaris is the north star and is irrelevant to this discussion unless you are trying to reference a specific photograph (At which point you should share). What does it mean to have a trail centered on the north star?  What does it mean for the trails to curve through the arc of the Earth? What do you mean by ""trails are actual distances of camera perspective changing through time""? Most of your post is closer to word salad than a coherent argument."
theworldisflat,3abghb,SquareHimself,-2,Sun Jun 21 04:47:11 2015 UTC,"When you tape the phone to the basketball that is analogous to the Earth spinning while centered on Polaris...that's the significance of Polaris.  But apparently that flew over your head, lol"
theworldisflat,3abghb,bitbytebit,5,Sun Jun 21 05:42:15 2015 UTC,"So you're talking about the earth's rotational axis? This doesn't clear up any of your previous post. You didn't even define what you're talking about, you just used it in a sentence. You should probably work on your communication skills before implying that I'm ignorant."
theworldisflat,3abghb,maplebar,-2,Sun Jun 21 06:50:59 2015 UTC,"Since the distance between Earth and the stars is so massive, they don't move noticeably across the field of view due to lateral motion in a single night.   They haven't moved since the dawn of time. It's not because they're far away."
theworldisflat,3abghb,Mr_Lobster,2,Sun Jun 21 03:00:17 2015 UTC,"OK, I thought about it and it is easy to explain.  The rotating Earth has a large effect on on our point of view, obviously.  We see the stars curve around Polaris every 12 hours.  This is due to our own perspective changing with the rotating Earth as you know.  However, as we circle the sun this has a tiny effect on our perspective as the distance to the stars are so immense.    Say you are a little kid in a car.  Your big brother lays you horizontally with your head pointed towards the mountains and is spinning you around.  You see the distant mountains spinning around and around, but they do not move to the side even though the car is traveling quickly.  Why do the mountains appear to flip around while they do not move laterally?  Because the rotating motion is a function of the rotating observer while the lateral motion occurs over a much longer period of time and can only occur as the vehicle moves long distances in relation to the mountains.  There is measurable parallax of stars as we revolve around the sun, but it is subtle due to the enormous distances involved and will not be at all apparent over the course of one evening as is the apparent rotation of stars around Polaris."

Let's say your body is attached to a rocket, with a camera connected to the back of your head. The rocket is aimed in the lateral direction though, sideways not up and down. Now, let's assume that we can somehow rotate you on your own axis and start recording. You would see the same loop trails that stars make. Now shoot off the rocket in a sideways direction while the person is still rotating like a kebab. Wouldn't it produce the effect jtcribbs is describing?"

theworldisflat,3abghb,youfuckingslaves,3,Tue Jun 23 08:58:53 2015 UTC,"There doesn't have to be a star at the celestial pole. It's just a point in the sky around which all the other stars appear to rotate. Sigma Octanis is a magnitude 5 star so not readily visible to the naked eye though, so most pictures not taken through a telescope won't pick it up. Not really much point even calling it the pole star, it's not easy to navigate with.   You can't deny the southern celestial pole exists though, there's shitloads of evidence just a google search away. So I repeat the question, how does this work in the flat earth model?"

theworldisflat,3abghb,maplebar,5,Tue Jun 23 09:39:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the stars in the sky there are pretty clearly rotating around a central point there. There doesn't have to be a star there. I don't know what's so hard to understand about that, the north geographical pole doesn't have to have a barber pole sticking out of it, the celestial poles don't have to have a point of light occupying them.

theworldisflat,3aa4ac,RubyCodpiece,0,Thu Jun 18 12:58:19 2015 UTC,"Googling the circumference of Antarctica gives me 17,968 km which translates to a mere 11,164 miles of coastline to traverse. Something we need to realize though is that ""circumnavigating"" Antarctica doesn't mean following along the 11,000 mile coast of Antarctica until you go all the way around. Circumnavigating Antarctica merely means that you sailed south of three points: Cape Horn in South America, Cape Leeuwin in Australia, and the Cape of Good Hope in Africa. That is what Jon Sanders did. As for Fedor Konyukhov, all he did was sail the Antarctic Racetrack course in record time. Here is what the racetrack looks like. As you can see, even the innermost lane is quite far from the coastline of Antarctica, which, on the flat earth, would mean that we should expect them to complete their race ""around"" the continent relatively quickly (the further north you are, the faster your trip around the world). Next, Everen Brown took the typical tourist route using the Russian icebreaker they have set up. If they were in danger of exposing anything truthful about Antarctica, then their tourist operation would not continue to exist. Therefore, if the Russian tanker people are not actively deceiving the tourists that pay to circumnavigate the continent, then they are simply following the path that has been pre-approved by the people who control the access to the place.  Lastly, James Cook seems to be the first person to sail below the Antarctic Circle (in the late 1700s) but only did so in order to determine if there was any land mass south of Australia. He was only trying to verify the existence of more land; he did not prove that Antarctica was a continent 11,000 miles in circumference and located at the south pole of a globe."

theworldisflat,3aajj2,DethFiesta,1 point,Thu Jun 18 19:29:13 2015 UTC,"The illusion is that the ship is sinking below the water-horizon. By zooming in and making the image larger, you are able to see that there is a distinction between the bottom of the ship and the top of the water-horizon. Zooming in allows you to show that the bottom of the boat is actually sitting on top, and has not receded below, the horizon. It's the same idea when you go to color in a section in the Paint program, but your entire canvas ends up getting colored. you zoom in only to realize that, where you thought was an intersection, the lines actually aren't touching. You only notice that when you zoom in though! Why is that concept difficult to grasp when looking at an object in the distance? It's too far away! Your eyes can't resolve all of the detail so they think it's sinking below. That's the illusion!"
theworldisflat,3aajj2,maplebar,3,Thu Jun 18 19:49:52 2015 UTC,"LOL.  But why does this happen?  It should not happen if the Earth is flat.  The object should simply get smaller and smaller, not recede and be obscured bottom first.  Also, this effect is noticeable on solid land.  Go to the Bonneville Salt Flats and you can see the exact same thing.  Atmospheric refraction actually works to obscure the object dipping below the horizon and makes it seem closer.  Without atmospheric effects the dipping action of a receding ship would be even more pronounced."
theworldisflat,3aajj2,DethFiesta,-1,Thu Jun 18 20:00:37 2015 UTC,"It is known as a law of perspective on a flat plane that objects tend to get smaller, tend to move closer together, and tend to approach the horizon line as they move away from you. So why would you say something like ""it should not happen if the earth is flat."" I'm telling you that it is happening! As far as why part of it gets obscured instead of simply becoming smaller, I thought I explained that with my Paint analogy. On the whole, two lines within a large graphics file may seem to appear like they are touching, but if you zoom in, you can see that there is a few pixels worth of space between the two lines. Zoom back out and the space disappears so it looks like the lines in Paint are touching. I think real life works in the same way. Our brain is attempting to resolve the image, but does the best that it can with something that it so far away. When you zoom in, you are giving it more information so your brain is able to make a more accurate picture."

I agree with all of this.  I am saying that an ice-skater's legs disappearing is not part of this process.  You are saying it is, which is provably untrue.  Your paint analogy in no way approximates an ice-skater at a distance.  Why would my brain make her legs disappear?  It is much more easily explained by the fact that the Earth is curved, as can be demonstrated mathematically and has been proven by observation and expierment.  Ever heard of Foucoult's Pendulum?"
theworldisflat,3aajj2,shmusko01,0,Thu Jun 18 20:21:24 2015 UTC,"No I haven't heard of the pendulum concept, but I don't know how I can make this any clearer. Let's take another example: from far away, if you look at a crowd of faces, you cannot make out individual features. Is this because the individual features are blocked or nonexistant? No! It's because at a far distance, your eyes cannot resolve that level of detail. Your brain sees a colored face with some kind of shapes where the facial features would be, but you wouldn't be able to tell me specifically what the person looks like. As the person gets nearer to you, your eyes receive more information and you begin to get a clear and full picture of their face. As they walk away again, their features slowly start to become less and less distinct until the person is so far away, their face is just a flesh-colored dot. How is it difficult for you to accept the concept that our eyes are not capable of resolving details when the object is that far away? Snow is white. Most skates are white. From a distance, they would appear to blend together, just like two lines in a Paint program might appear from afar to be touching when they actually aren't. Your brain blurs everything over when the eyes can't report enough detail. How are they not related ideas? I'm sure you're part of the computer/tech generation. How do you not understand that details of an image become obscured at extremely low resolutions?"

So yes, the bottom part of an object would not become obscured in such a way were the earth flat.   Objects recede towards the horizon. Yes, that's imple perspective.

The Bible says it is flat, so if that is not the case, the Bible is ""lying"" and Christians who need the Bible to be true cannot and will not accept that. Then there is the mental illness angle, some people just need to believe that ""they are being lied to"". We call them ""paranoid"", but they just need to believe that there is a big lie, and some have latched onto this particular big lie. I suppose there is also a third group of flat-earthers who are pushing this theory in an attempt to discredit all conspiracy theories. If you read the replies of flat-earthers to a simple question like the one you just asked, you can usually fit the flat-earther into one of the three categories: Christian, crazy, or conspiratard (the name they chose for themselves).   The real question I want answered is this: Why would the powers that be engineer this great untruth about the world being a sphere? For what reason is hiding ""the truth"" about the Earth being flat so important? Why did ancient civilizations give up on the idea of the Earth being flat millennia ago but all of a sudden in the 1890s some fringe groups start pushing the idea that it's flat again? Why is it important to conceal from all of humanity that the world is flat?"

I'm not saying that spirituality is without value, but I won't have things dictated to me by a preacher any more than I will a scientist who is set up in a position of authority.  But I am interested in truth.  I want to know what actually is.    The most basic thing to look at is the flatness of water over long distances.  If water never curves, then the earth cannot be a globe.  You can find many examples where you can see things over the water that are too far away.  The standard comeback is that the atmosphere is refracting light by exactly the right amount so that it follows the curvature.  However, this is contradicted by viewing a sunset over water.  You see a line of reflection all the way from you out to the horizon.  If the earth was curved you should not see that.  You should get a spot reflection with a distinct beginning and end.  If you wanted to excuse this away with refraction through the atmosphere as well, you would need an entirely different kind of refraction for that to happen.  You can't have the magic both ways.  Listen to this weatherman try to explain it:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxOCx5BF67c   Are you buying that?  They ""why"" of the coverup is another matter.  It requires a lot more material to be understood and it isn't the type of evidence that you can go out and observe yourself first hand.

theworldisflat,3a76dt,5arge,2,Mon Jun 22 00:16:23 2015 UTC,"One of the topics that I think deserves more attention is the idea that our local noon (the time of day that the sun is right above us) should change every 6 months.  If it is summer in the northern hemisphere, that means the northern hemisphere is tilted toward the sun (according to globe theory). Normally, the sun reaches local noon (its highest point in the sky) at around 12 pm, during everyone's lunch time.   6 months later, it is winter in the northern hemisphere, so according to globe theory, the northern hemisphere is facing away from the sun. Now, here's the question: if, during summer, the sun in the northern hemisphere reaches its peak at noon...how is it that during winter 6 months later, even though we are facing away from the sun now, the sun still reaches its peak at noon? If we are true to the globe theory, local noon should occur during summer time at noon and during the winter time at midnight. Why is this not what we observe?"
theworldisflat,3a76dt,maplebar,7,Thu Jun 18 09:20:34 2015 UTC,"You are correct in that ""noon"" would be at midnight during winter, because when the earth goes halfway through its orbit, it is also going through a half rotation (12 hours approximately). The key that you're missing here is that humans are not stupid. The second key is that the tilt doesn't happen in an instant, rather the sun's track through the sky shift slowly over 6 months.  What's happening is that we cleverly defined a period of one day to not be exactly one rotation of the earth around its axis, but slightly longer (or shorter, doesn't matter), such that after 6 months that difference of 12 hours is compensated for, and the sun shines brightly overhead at 12 noon on the clock."
theworldisflat,3a76dt,lelarentaka,1 point,Thu Jun 18 10:17:16 2015 UTC,"we cleverly defined a period of one day to not be... slightly longer (or shorter, doesn't matter), such that after 6 months that difference of 12 hours is compensated for, and the sun shines brightly overhead at 12 noon on the clock.   So, even though you agree that the earth takes 24 hours to turn 360 degrees and that we should experience a change in local noon every 6 months, your reasoning for why we don't see the change is that humans adjusted our definition of a day? Seems like a weird explanation to me. You yourself aren't even sure about exactly how we've adjusted our definition from the 24-hr-day. You say that it doesn't matter to the outcome whether we made it shorter or longer, that simply making an adjustment in either direction would result in keeping local noon consistently happening at lunch time. I don't think that makes sense."
theworldisflat,3a76dt,maplebar,4,Thu Jun 18 11:28:21 2015 UTC,"You can check any source about the exact rotational period of the Earth. Check out wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth  On the sidebar, it says ""sidereal rotation period: 23 h 56 m"". There's a 4 minutes deficit each day, which over six months equals 4 * 182 = 728 minutes. 728 minutes turns out to be 12 hours."
theworldisflat,3a76dt,lelarentaka,5,Thu Jun 18 12:14:05 2015 UTC,"Thank you for clarifying that to me. I knew that the year is actually 365.25 days, which is what causes us the need to have an extra day every four years. I didn't realize the same concept applied in this case. It's an odd feeling to think that I'm only eating lunch during the day time because a 4-minute discrepancy has grown to 728 minutes."
theworldisflat,3a76dt,maplebar,2,Thu Jun 18 12:25:47 2015 UTC,"You also have to understand where the ""day"" came from. Our ancestors thousands of years ago had no idea how long it took for the earth to do one complete sidereal rotation, they probably didn't even think that was a thing. All they did was define the length of a ""day"" to be the time between the perspective peaks of the sun's travel on two consequent days. This was then defined as being 24 hours. Once people figured out orbital mechanics we learned that 24 hours is actually slightly longer than our sidereal rotation. This is unavoidable when we defined the time periods in this way as the half rotation had to be accounted for somehow.

If you have any specific questions I encourage you to post threads about them.  These two examples definitively demonstrate that our world cannot be a ball of 25,000 statute miles in circumference:   The horizon at 100,000 feet is flat. Independent weather balloon footage from around the world confirms this. The city of Chicago is visible from sixty miles across Lake Michigan. The entire city should be over three thousand feet below the horizon and curved away from the viewer, but instead we see the bottoms of the buildings standing straight up and down at an impossible distance.   The only conflicting ideas in the world concerning a flat earth are NASA (space programs) and satellites, both of which are easily dismissed for various reasons."

theworldisflat,3a76dt,Toon_DB,0,Thu Jun 18 06:50:36 2015 UTC,"That one is really easy.  Do you see how curved that horizon is?  It is ridiculous.  That is an obvious fish eye lens.  Do you see the detail in ground features at the point in the video you linked?  Do the scale of those ground features match with the curvature seen?   The earth would have to be tiny for that amount of curvature with that scale of ground features, you couldn't fit a single continent.  Compare it to the horizon seen when a flat lens is used at :45 of that video.  There is no way those two images are consistent."
theworldisflat,3a76dt,ChangeThroughTruth,3,Thu Jun 18 09:33:59 2015 UTC,"there is a curvature at :45, just look at the atmosphere above the line"
theworldisflat,3a76dt,Toon_DB,2,Thu Jun 18 09:40:19 2015 UTC,"So you agree with the rest of what I said about the silly amount of curvature depicted by the fish eye lens in the rest of the video?  At :45 the horizon is flat, look again, use a straight edge pressed up against your monitor if you like.  Not only is it flat, it is at the camera level.  This is just as important as it is a feature of a flat plane.  As you rise above a globe the horizon must drop below your eye level.  You should have to look down to see it.  They claim to be at 128k feet where, if the earth were a globe, you would have to look down to the horizon.  The video you have shown is actually pretty good proof that the earth cannot be a globe.  If you would like to transition from stabs in the dark attempting to debunk to actually critically considering the arguments, please investigate deeper.

If you say the evidence is right there, for everyone to see, observe and measure, why hasn't mainstream science accepted it? There is no insentive to not ""reveal the thruth"" and teach everyone the right thing. Why would they keep everyone in the dark? Every science teacher ever has got a wrong education, every astronomer is lied to, and non have discovered it yet? Doesn't that seem odd?"
theworldisflat,3a76dt,Toon_DB,2,Thu Jun 18 10:08:45 2015 UTC,"You're right that it would be odd for all of these mainstream scientists to participate in a coverup. In reality, the same thing happens with scientists that happens here on Reddit: talk about a banned subject and you are kicked out and made to appear to the rest of the public as crazy. The government already does that to an extent through the way research funding works. If you're a scientist who says you want to do an independent investigation into something they don't want you investigating, if they can't get you to manipulate your data, then they try to discredit you and suppress your information. Scientists aren't supermen. They are human people just like the rest of us. They ask questions pertaining to new topics of discovery, they aren't sitting around trying to prove that the government is conspiring to suppress information about the true nature of our reality. They aren't asking questions about the shape of the world because people don't question anything they know to be certain. You have to open yourself up to the idea that what you know is incorrect and many scientists do actually do that. They just don't go publicly with ideas that they don't have the money or time to put into researching (even if they did, they sure as hell wouldn't stake their reputation on it, considering how people treat fringe ideas). Many of them learning information about the moon did question publicly its nature. Read some of these quotes from different authors and scientists around the world about the moon."
theworldisflat,3a76dt,maplebar,1 point,Thu Jun 18 11:40:30 2015 UTC,"Yes, it is odd.  In order to understand the why and the how of the coverup requires a lot of background.  This is why I generally ask people to consider the concrete, physical evidence of the shape of the world that they can observe for themselves first.  Once they see enough of the problems with the globe model, they are unlikely to dismiss the topic so easily and are then compelled to put in the time required to figure out how such a coverup is possible and why.    The globe model was proposed and accepted a long time ago so clearly there must be an organized effort over this time to promote this lie.  Have you researched the history of central banking?  It demonstrates how such a thing is possible.  The ability of particular families to adopt a strategy and play it out over generations.  There really is an elite ruling class over us that is all united by one thing, they worship lucifer.  They use deception, trickery and subversion to accomplish their goals.  Secret societies (freemasons, knights templar, skull and bones, etc) are their foot soldiers.  This is an enormous topic.  If you want to get into it there is lots of information available.  http://www.atlanteanconspiracy.com/search/label/Secret%20Societies  is a start.  The why likely involves keeping us in the dark about our true nature.  If we are just random occurrences of matter in a random universe then nothing we do really matters.  A flat earth model where the sun and moon rotate around us means that we are more significant."
theworldisflat,3a76dt,ChangeThroughTruth,0,Thu Jun 18 10:28:18 2015 UTC,"That was a GoPro camera with a fish-eye lens. The fish-eye lens creates the curvature effect in photos that use it. In contrast, here is a photograph from inside his capsule, one that gives a more accurate view of the flat horizon.   Whether you think the horizon is flat or curved, why would the horizon itself still be visible at eye-level for someone who is 26 miles above the surface of the sphere? A constant, eye-level horizon is a phenomenon that makes sense only in the flat earth model, not the globe model.   Remember those rainbow-colored parachutes where groups of people get together in a circle and pull the giant parachute up and down for fun? Imagine that rainbow-colored parachute laying flat on the ground, extending 2 miles in every direction. At the same time, let's say you can only visibly see for 1 mile in every direction. As you begin to gain elevation over the flat parachute, the parachute will continue to remain at eye level until you can see the full parachute extending the 2 miles in every direction. Now, let's say the parachute isn'y lying flat, but is covering a large ball that you are standing on. The ball is large enough such that everything within your one-mile gaze appears to be flat. As you rise above the surface of the sphere, you'll be able to see 2 miles in every direction, but you'll notice that the parachute isn't at eye level anymore, it is below you. This is the difference between a horizon on a flat plane and a horizon on a sphere.  Edit: /u/SquareHimself posted a YouTube video illustrating the difference between what it would look like to raise yourself above a flat surface and a spherical surface: link here"

theworldisflat,3a76dt,Toon_DB,2,Thu Jun 18 09:33:32 2015 UTC,What has no purpose? Your comment? The purpose of my comment is to show that:  1) Much of the photographic evidence people present for the curvature of the earth comes from cameras using fish-eye lenses.  2) What we observe in reality is not consistent with the implications required by the spherical model that we are taught in school.  So clearly what I've said is purposeful. I'm not ranting off-topic. Do you want to say anything in particular about the points I've raised?

If you actually applied the tiniest amount of effort into having an honest conversation with me, then you would realize that I am open to changing my opinion when presented with new evidence. That's how I became interested in the topic to begin with. It always starts with learning the arguments of the other side so that you can clearly present distinct pieces of evidence that refute their points. I started looking into different questions flat-earth proponents were asking and now I've discovered that some of them are actually good questions that don't have good answers. There's nothing wrong with asking these kinds of questions, but I often see people who think they know the earth is a globe viciously attacking others for bothering to question it. To me, that is unnecessary.  Let me ask you this. Do you believe in the flying spaghetti monster? If I took you to his saucy kingdom of pasta and meatballs, would you accept it as fact or would you assume that I've created this fake pasta kingdom in order to fool you because you ""know"" the FSM doesn't exist? 1) If you answer that you would immediately believe the FSM was real if I showed you the pasta palace, then stop accusing me of the inability to change my views as the information I receive changes. 2) If you answer that you know it's bullshit and I would never fool you into believing the pasta kingdom was real, then you know how flat earthers feel. You're telling them we live in a pasta kingdom but they know you're just talking bullshit."
theworldisflat,3a76dt,maplebar,0,Thu Jun 18 10:07:54 2015 UTC,"No, I would not immediatly take on the position that the spaghetti monster is real. If you give me enough evidence and time to verify the pasta kingdom, I may later change my view, and say I was wrong. Is it wrong for me to wait and examine, in stead of directly assuming my possible position was false? You could have facked the pasta kingdom.  Do you remember that time when a particle went faster than the speed of light? The data coming from the machine implied that a particle had gone faster than the speed of light, which is not possible according to our current model of physics. They where excited, they said it could mean a revolution in science, but they did not immediatly throw all the previous work out the window. After reconsidering the evidence and checking the facts, it became clear there was an error in the measurement, and everything went back to normal.  Were they wrong for first searching for errors in their experiment, instead of immediatly assuming they had ""broken"" the current physics model? No, they were not.

When you are looking down, you are looking at the ground.  For the globe, try this: draw a circle. Consider an observer at the top of the circle, moving progressively up, and draw lines from that observer to the horizon. You will see that the slopes of the lines continually increase. Thus the horizon will be lower and lower as altitude increases.  The plane does not have to be infinite, just big enough to reach the vanishing point."

As you rise up, you can see farther; and the further you can see, the farther down the distant land is. The curve will become exponentially more pronounced for every bit you rise above the ball and the horizon must fall below the horizon exponentially more.  It does not take an infinite plane to cause a flat, eye level horizon; just a sufficiently large plane.  You cannot, at any distance above a ball, have a horizon that is eye level. It's impossible.

theworldisflat,3a76dt,Killgunner27,2,Thu Jun 18 03:20:07 2015 UTC,"Have you seen the movie Gravity?  Even easier (for them), if you take a high altitude flight with a GoPro angled down, it will replicate exactly what you're looking at in that video. Add shadows and some stuff in the foreground and voila."
theworldisflat,3a76dt,SquareHimself,2,Thu Jun 18 03:32:25 2015 UTC,"I would say that an indicator that the time-lapse footage isn't real is the fact that the clouds aren't moving at all. I understand that clouds take a long time to travel, but the point of a time-lapse is that you've taken photos over a long period of time to begin with. Even though I might see one second of time-lapse footage, that single second should show clouds changing dramatically as they would've throughout the entire day. In your video, beginning at 1:15, you'll notice that those animations show rotation of the earth but do not show the clouds moving over the surface of the earth. I think it was the NASA painter who hypothesized that attempting to fake the cloud movement would create an ""uncanny valley"" effect, screaming of manipulation. So doing it this way looks more believable to the average person who spends only a few seconds barely even looking at the video, much less thinking about its implications."
theworldisflat,3a76dt,maplebar,3,Thu Jun 18 08:59:03 2015 UTC,"The orbital period of ISS is 90 minutes. You're not seeing the clouds at a scale you're familiar with, where they'll change shape over the course of minutes. You're seeing entire weather systems, spanning countries - these take hours or days to change, not minutes. It would be suspicious if you did see large changes."
theworldisflat,3a76dt,TheWalruss,2,Thu Jun 18 13:28:51 2015 UTC,That might work to explain the footage from the ISS. What about these photographs that were supposedly taken by the Galileo spacecraft as it flew by earth? I see a smooth time-lapse of the earth rotating but all of the clouds are stagnant compared to the surface.
theworldisflat,3a76dt,maplebar,2,Thu Jun 18 16:25:49 2015 UTC,"First of all, there's no telling how much time there were between snaps - do you know? I have no idea how quickly Galileo passed around the Earth.  Secondly, you're not looking very closely. Get VLC (VideoLAN) or some other good .MOV viewer and look at the video frame by frame, or slowed down to at least 1/4 speed to discern the changes between frames. Being able to slide the video back and forth is also helpful.  For instance, look at southern Africa in seconds 5 to 6. A heavy cloud bank on the western coast of South Africa dissolves over the course of the morning, while a cumulus formation is collecting inland above Botswana.   There's interesting weather happening over Australia from seconds 2 to 4-ish, and South America, too. Very cool!  Anyway, if you think these images are faked, why are you even interested in posting them? Weather forecasters show animating cloud formations every minute of every day, supposedly from satellite feeds, so obviously we have the ability to fake this imagery.  Why would NASA-funded Galileo footage fakery be of lower quality and use static clouds?"
theworldisflat,3a76dt,TheWalruss,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:30:24 2015 UTC,"According to the APOD section of the NASA website, the photos were snapped over a 25 hour period. You can tell that the earth is spinning, but moving away from the spacecraft. The time-lapse begins with the face of South America. Over the 25 hour period, the earth moves away from the spacecraft, but as South America comes back around, the cloud formations are exactly the same as they were when the Earth began the rotation at the beginning of the video. I'm sure that clouds move slowly, but I highly doubt they would look THAT similar after an entire 24 hour period of the earth's rotation.  Next, the cloud dissipation and formation that you are referring to is nonexistent. What I think you are referring to is the spot of glare that exists slightly off-center to the right and down. If you keep your eye on it, you'll notice it remains fixed in the same spot as the earth rotates across the camera frame. That is exactly what you are referring to when you mention Africa at 5 seconds and Australia/South America at 2 seconds.  Lastly, I'm posting the images because I am attempting to show others why I think it's fake. That's part of a healthy debate. We don't care about cloud formations on the weather channel because we aren't being forced to accept that it's real. We know it is a simulation that the weatherman is using. It doesn't matter if it's good or bad quality. My theory is that the images are photo-realistic paintings. You can attempt to paint multiple images of the earth, but to show cloud formation independent of the surface movement, you would need to produce an incredible amount of paintings. Not only that, but your paintings would need to show the clouds changing successively--not random shots of completely different cloud formations. I think that they attempted this but then realized that it wasn't smooth enough to convince the viewer that it was authentic. You are familiar with the ""uncanny valley"" effect in animation? I think that in trying to make the clouds move, that created an uncanny valley type of effect, making the animation seem even less real than if they had just painted static clouds. So they decided to do the latter instead of the former."
theworldisflat,3a76dt,maplebar,2,Thu Jun 18 18:54:50 2015 UTC,I'm on mobile so I can't provide screenshots but the South American cloud formations are not at all identical. I'll reply later with some clear shots side-by-side for comparison.
theworldisflat,3a76dt,TheWalruss,1 point,Thu Jun 18 19:45:38 2015 UTC,"Great man. I look forward to studying the side-by-side shots. That would be very helpful to me in understanding the globe model. However, do you admit that, in this particular animation, there is a glare spot that exists slightly to the right and down from the center of the sphere?"
theworldisflat,3a76dt,maplebar,4,Thu Jun 18 19:51:41 2015 UTC,"Yes, there's definitely a glare spot. The lighting in this animation is consistent with a distant light source behind the camera, and slightly down and to the right, casting light on a semi-matte sphere. Do you agree?    DATA  IMGUR ALBUM    PROCESS   Opened the video in VLC.  Paused it on the first frame and took a screenshot, pasting it in MSPaint (1). Continued the video to where South America swung back around to face the camera and chose a frame in which it looked approximately the same angle as the first frame.  Took a screenshot of that and pasted in MSPaint (2). Cropped (1) to around the South American continent, saved the cropped image (3). Cropped (2) to around the South American continent, saved the cropped image (4). Realized Galileo was travelling away from the Earth at a considerable speed, and (3) was larger than (4) by a significant margin. Resized (4) to match the width of (3) to more easily compare the two. Placed MSPaint windows (3) and (4) side by side and took a new screenshot, which was pasted in MSPaint and cropped to produce (5), the comparison shot.     DISCUSSION  It is unfortunate that the image quality is poor. Use of more advanced tools than a 5-minute MSPaint hack job would probably give better results. Nevertheless, I think the following can be concluded with some level of certainty:   The cloud patterns in the captured images are not identical.  The change in cloud patterns are consistent with what would be expected of a 24-hour period from general exposure to television and web-based weather forecast animations and satellite imagery. Example: the vortex shape off the eastern coast appears to have rotated between frames Example: the broken/banded cloud formations over northern Argentina appear to have thickened into a solid mass of cloud. Besides the weather patterns, there are distracting optical effects that would be difficult/computationally expensive to simulate. Example: the little bit of rainbow above Paraguay in the first capture, which is missing or possibly shifted east to the Brazilian coast in the second capture. Anybody with experience in ray-tracing or other generative graphics techniques can appreciate the difficulty in producing such an effect.   In conclusion, an analysis of these images indicates either that this is a truly top-of-the-line digital simulation produced in secret by a sinister organization leveraging groundbreaking digital production assets to delude the public for some unknown purpose, or else an authentic image series captured by a satellite flying by a spherical planet as claimed by the publisher of the images in question.    What do you think?"
theworldisflat,3a76dt,TheWalruss,5,Thu Jun 18 21:56:09 2015 UTC,Also the horizon looks flat because our planet is so large.
theworldisflat,3a76dt,SuperMajesticMan,-1,Wed Jun 17 23:25:08 2015 UTC,"At twenty miles up, the horizon could not possibly be flat and eye level anymore on a ball 25,000 miles around... but in reality it is."

theworldisflat,3a76dt,jonomw,-1,Thu Jun 18 02:42:56 2015 UTC,"Okay, so using the formula of 8 inches per mile squared of curvature, we find that a distance of about 90 miles gives us one mile of drop. Calculating the distance to the horizon from one mile up, we find that we can see approximately 90 miles at that height. This should give you an idea of how extreme the curvature should be.  Now at a height of twenty miles, our calculated distance to the horizon is around 400 miles. 400 miles distance gives us about twenty miles of drop at that height.  Now... if you look straight down, the ground should be twenty miles below you and what's extending away from you should go further down exponentially. You do not see miles of drop in that video, but you should.  You should be looking at a growing parabola getting more profound every mile you ascend.  Instead, the horizon is eye level and flat. You can see much better from this high altitude balloon that doesn't use a GoPro.  EDIT: This is what it would look like if the earth were a ball."

theworldisflat,3a76dt,TotesMessenger,-1,Thu Jun 18 01:16:03 2015 UTC,Chicago is easily visible because of the light bending in earths gravity.
theworldisflat,3a76dt,SuperMajesticMan,0,Wed Jun 17 23:24:22 2015 UTC,I don't buy it. There's a much simpler explanation that fits with the other data.
theworldisflat,3a76dt,SquareHimself,-1,Wed Jun 17 23:30:57 2015 UTC,"? Gravity pulls, light gets pulled. What is to explain?"
theworldisflat,3a76dt,SuperMajesticMan,-3,Wed Jun 17 23:34:24 2015 UTC,"The horizon at altitude doesn't fit with the size ball they say we're on. The light is not being pulled by gravity (not even by science's explanation), so I'm not sure what you're on about.  Gravity is an unproven theory that requires a ball and space first. Considering we're in a snowglobe with a roof, it's more likely we fall because we're more dense than air. It's as simple as that.  You can see Chicago sixty miles across Lake Michigan because you can see it. The water is flat."
theworldisflat,3a76dt,SquareHimself,0,Wed Jun 17 23:39:02 2015 UTC,"Personally, I never got how gravity is a theory. Do other planets just magically orbit the sun? Moon? Solar systems around the center of galaxies? And the reason why we would stay down from being denser than air is gravity. And if gravity wasn't there why would we stay  down/orbit?"
theworldisflat,3a76dt,SuperMajesticMan,-3,Wed Jun 17 23:55:20 2015 UTC,"We live in a snowglobe. The sun and the moon are lights, as are the stars. They are not as big as we've been taught nor are they very far away.  The sun and moon move above the circle of the earth like this, about 3000 or 4000 miles up."
theworldisflat,3a76dt,SquareHimself,2,Thu Jun 18 00:04:35 2015 UTC,"That's a cool diagram, but inaccurate. In the far north, the sun doesn't set for 6 months. Explain?"
theworldisflat,3a76dt,SuperMajesticMan,-2,Thu Jun 18 00:10:02 2015 UTC,"The diameter of the sun's path is greater during the winter months, and smaller during the summer months. It circles the north pole tighter, causing you to be able to see the sun circle you in the sky twenty four hours straight during the peak of summer in the north."
theworldisflat,3a76dt,SquareHimself,3,Thu Jun 18 00:15:28 2015 UTC,"Also, how does this explain night and day compared to winter and summer? Going by this diagram, it would show that everywhere where the sun is is extremely hot and everywhere else is extremely cold. If the sun rotates like this, why do we have seasons? Shouldn't it be 4 seasons in 24 hours?"
theworldisflat,3a76dt,SuperMajesticMan,1 point,Thu Jun 18 00:29:38 2015 UTC,"How does this work with regards to the southern hemisphere? The south pole also experiences a 6-month day/night cycle, in line with southern hemispheric seasons, analogous to the north. In your diagram, north and south are very different."
theworldisflat,3a76dt,TheWalruss,2,Thu Jun 18 13:35:17 2015 UTC,"The sun and moon move above the circle of the earth like this   thats not how light works.  Because if that's how the sun moved I'd see it when it was ""day time"" on ""other side"" of the Earth."

This was proved to you, time and time again- including the time you brought it to askscience for the calculations and subsequently turned tail and ran, to be wrong.  Even on a perfectly spherical Earth (which it is not), an object at 10 miles out ""drops"" only around 30 feet.  Of course, this is immensely clear when you witness ships disappearing to see bottom first"

theworldisflat,3a76dt,bitbytebit,1 point,Sat Jun 20 09:04:34 2015 UTC,"/u/bitbytebit when one talks about the ""rate of curvature"" for the Earth, if it is a sphere, the answer must be one that necessarily increases exponentially rather than linearly.   Imagine a fly standing at the top most point of a basketball. Move the fly one millimeter to the right without losing any altitude and the surface of the ball will drop beneath him as the ball curves away. Label the current distance between the fly and the ball's surface X. Move the fly one more millimeter in the same direction and the surface of the ball has now sunk even further below the fly. The difference is that it did not sink the second time by 2X, but by x2.  If you offer a rate of curvature that is ""3 miles for every 6 feet,"" you are saying the difference is linear, like a slope on a pyramid. That would imply the shape of the earth to be pyramidal. You aren't arguing that so offer a rate of curvature that changes exponentially.  Secondly, the ""3 miles for 6 feet"" that the article mentions means that if an observer is 6 feet off the surface, they should be able to see a horizon that is 3 miles away. Most people claim that the reason ships disappear is because they go over the horizon and along the side of the sphere that we cannot see. This article you've linked would suggest that if we are only 6 feet tall, we are incapable of seeing anything further than 3 miles away. If you've ever been on a beach and have seen a ship in the distance, wouldn't you say it was probably more than 3 miles away? ""But the bottom part after 3 miles disappears. That means it's going over the side!"" After 3 miles, grab a pair of binoculars and I guarantee that you'll see the bottom of the boat just fine. Not possible if the Earth is a globe. Totally possible if the Earth is flat."

theworldisflat,3a85wq,RubyCodpiece,0,Wed Jun 17 23:58:19 2015 UTC,The moon is likely self luminating as moonlight has different qualities then sunlight.

theworldisflat,3a85wq,DethFiesta,1 point,Thu Jun 18 10:39:16 2015 UTC,LOL.  One guy told me that the moon emits cold light and that during a Full Moon the shadows cast by a full moon will be measurably warmer than areas bathed in moonlight.  Thanks for fighting the good fight in this sub.

theworldisflat,3a85wq,SquareHimself,-1,Tue Jun 23 23:18:11 2015 UTC,"There's an event that happens every so often called a selenelion. This is when the moon rises eclipsed while the sun is still out. It's claimed that this is the product of refraction, but for me this makes no sense.  I preface my answer with that because I have to say we don't know. It's possible that there is a non-luminary in the firmament eclipsing the moon. The phases of the moon are too consistent to be the result of the earth's shadow on it, and the new moon doesn't show up as a black object in the sky during the day (which it should)... so the most we can say is that it can't be the earth's shadow.  I believe the scripture; that the moon is its own light source and not reflecting the sunlight. How it works? God knows."
theworldisflat,3a85wq,maplebar,3,Thu Jun 18 00:13:00 2015 UTC,and the new moon doesn't show up as a black object in the sky during the day (which it should)...    Wait...WHAT?  Why would the moon show up as black during the day?
theworldisflat,3a85wq,maplebar,2,Thu Jun 18 00:26:40 2015 UTC,"Imagine you're standing in a line of people and the guy behind you shines an extremely powerful flashlight on the back of your head. You'll probably see the back of the head of the guy standing in front of you. Now, imagine that the holder of the flashlight was instead in front of both you and the guy in front of you and is aiming the flashlight in your direction. If the flashlight were bright enough, the back of the head of the guy in front of you would just become a black circle right?"
theworldisflat,3a85wq,DethFiesta,1 point,Thu Jun 18 09:06:28 2015 UTC,"It would not become a black circle. If the light were in front of me and the guy in front of me and shining in my direction, the guy's head would block the light, and I would see the light around him.   That is an eclipse."
theworldisflat,3a85wq,maplebar,0,Thu Jun 18 09:09:04 2015 UTC,"I agree that is an eclipse. You would see the light around him, but the center should appear black like this.  I think what /u/SquareHimself is getting at is...why doesn't our ""new moon"" phase look like an eclipsed object in the sky?"
theworldisflat,3a85wq,DethFiesta,1 point,Thu Jun 18 09:35:54 2015 UTC,"You should learn a few things about how the moon works.  A full moon rises exactly at Sunset. Why?  Because it is on the opposite side of the Earth from the Sun....this is why we see the entire Earth-facing side of the moon illuminated.    A New Moon rises exactly at Sunrise and is located on the same side of the Earth as the sun.  So, the side of the moon that always faces us gets zero sunlight (and the ""dark side of the moon"" is fully illuminated during a new moon, but we can't see it because it faces away from us).    We see by light entering our eyes.  If the moon reflects no sunlight then we cannot see it.  It will not appear like an eclipse, that makes no sense. It will not appear at all.  Now, the Earth is actually reflecting sunlight during a New Moon and some of that light will illuminate the New Moon.  So why can't we see it?  Because the New Moon is up when the sun is up and is very close to the sun in the sky.  It is the same reason why we can't see Stars during the day.  The Sun is too bright to make the New Moon (which should be visible in light reflected from the Earth) and Stars visible during the day time."
theworldisflat,3a85wq,SquareHimself,1 point,Thu Jun 18 19:45:16 2015 UTC,"Let's continue on with my example of people standing in line. Imagine you are staring at the back of the head of the person in front of you, as if their head was the moon and your head was the earth. Think about someone standing at the front of the line and shining a light onto everyone's face. In all my observations, I would see that the back of the head of the person in front of me is black. Would there ever be a case where their head seemed to disappear? No!"
theworldisflat,3a85wq,bitbytebit,1 point,Thu Jun 18 19:58:36 2015 UTC,"We need to refine your thought experiment to make it valid.  Assume an entirely empty universe except this line of 2 people. Assume that the only light source in the universe is this flashlight. Assume the only thing that the light can reflect off of is your face and the man in front of you's head.  For your example to actually match that of the real world the flashlight would need to be at least the size of the man's head, first of all (since the sun's angular diameter is often, but not always, larger than that of the moon's).  Next, the flashlight would not be directly in between the man and your face (unless you want to simulate a solar eclipse, which we are not.  We are talking about a new moon).  So the flashlight would be somewhere above and behind the man's head with the entire light-emitting face of the flashlight visible to your eyes.   As you can see, the man's head blocks very little light from reaching us.  Some amount of light reflects off of our face and illuminates the back of the man's head and this light is again reflected off of his head and back into our eyes. How could we see this tiny amount of the man's head with an ENORMOUS flashlight shining directly into our eyes?  We can't.  If the only light source in the universe is shining directly into your eyes, why would you think you could see something that is only barely illuminated?"

theworldisflat,3a86e2,ChangeThroughTruth,0,Thu Jun 18 00:21:26 2015 UTC,"He is right, your argument is incorrect.  You do not have infinite vision.      I don't know why I bother explaining this to you, because I know what you are, but i will explain all the same.  Consider looking down a very long hallway.  The intersections of the walls, floor and ceiling make lines.  Those lines meet in the middle of your vision.  Now think of what you can see as a 2d viewport.  Those things closer to you take up more of this viewport.  Ie the walls, floor and ceiling of the first 20 feet take up more of this 2d area than the second 20 feet.  These lines of intersection are straight which means that they will meet at some finite point which represents the end of what you can see from your perspective.   Now if you use a telescope you can effectively move your viewport forward.  You don't see the things close to you, but things further away get more of the 2d viewable area.  The same effect remains though that your vision with the telescope ends at a finite point.  So no, you cannot see the rockies from new york and your argument is bogus."

Correct, we do not, but luckily I wasn't talking about infinite vision.   Consider looking down a very long hallway.    Oh this thing again. You were wrong the first time you mad this analogy, you were wrong the other dozen times you posted it and you're still wrong.   Now think of what you can see as a 2d viewport.   The world isn't a hallway, oddly enough.   Those things closer to you take up more of this viewport.   And mountains are quite large, and span a distance of several thousand kilometers from north to south.  There is nothing ""in front"" of them in our view. Not when standing on 5th avenue. Not when climbing to the top of a sky scraper. Not when on the flat plains on the prairies.    Now if you use a telescope you can effectively move your viewport forward.   Still waiting on those pics of the rocky mountains from new york.   So no, you cannot see the rockies from new york    right, because they're behind the curvature of the earth."
theworldisflat,3a86e2,ChangeThroughTruth,0,Thu Jun 18 02:35:52 2015 UTC,"No, the analogy is quite correct.  Perhaps you don't understand it, but it is still correct.  Of course the world is not a hallway, I'm trying to introduce you to the concept of lines of perspective.  The hallway is an easy way to see it.  It is not a complicated concept and there are plenty of other ways to demonstrate it.  http://www.wikihow.com/Draw-Perspective  A 5 minute video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mSPdNLotiI   And mountains are quite large, and span a distance of several thousand kilometers from north to south.   That's nice, perspective also applies up and down.  They are not tall enough for you to see at that distance, they are beyond the vanishing point."
theworldisflat,3a86e2,shmusko01,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:42:11 2015 UTC,"They are not tall enough for you to see at that distance   Yes they are. Were the world flat, the rocky mountains (or any mountain range) would be tall enough to be seen from the prairies. But they can not be.  Similarly, raising one's elevation would remove tat whole concept.   they are beyond the vanishing point.   On a flat earth nothing can be beyond the vanishing point. Objects receding towards a vanishing point never disappear. (This is also, of course, assuming the impossible hypothetical scenario to be true)  The pacific ocean would be obscured by the rockies, and the Himalayas  obscured beyond that such that one couldn't see it- but the rocky mountains are sufficiently large (in altitude and in north-south span) that they would be seen from the prairies in a flat plane. They can't be seen with the naked eye, a telescope or any other kind of visual detection device. For them to be so far off that they simply ""melt"" into the horizon, every single calculation of their distance would need to be wrong by an order of magnitude."
theworldisflat,3a86e2,ChangeThroughTruth,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:57:49 2015 UTC,"On a flat earth nothing can be beyond the vanishing point.   This clearly proves that you still do not understand perspective.  The vanishing point is not a property of a flat or curved earth, it is a property of vision.  Please refer to the links I gave or look for others.  Your debunkathon loses a lot of credibility when you don't understand simple concepts."
theworldisflat,3a86e2,shmusko01,2,Thu Jun 18 03:05:35 2015 UTC,"This clearly proves that you still do not understand perspective.   No. On  a flat earth there can be nothing ""beyond"" a vanishing point. On a flat earth  all objects would appear to recede towards it, but the would never go ""beyond"" it. That's how a vanishing point works. Thus, as one looked towards the direction of the rocky moutains from new york, one would see all the objects in that direction as the recede towards the horizon; one cannot.  As one moves westward toward the flat prairies, one would see the rocky moutains; one cannot.  Not because they have merged, so to speak, with the horizon, but because they are beyond the horizon and thus unavailable to be seen. If the Earth were flat, one would see them, and could see them even better with magnification. One cannot. When driving westwards, the rocky mountains come into view from the top down, as the peaks present themselves before the base; on a flat Earth they would appear to simply grow in size- as would a ship over the ocean. They do not. Similarly, in order for a ship or the mountains or what have you, to ""merge"" with the horizon as in a ""Flatearth hallway"" example, this woul need to occur at a much, much greater distance than suggested. A ship disappears from view much sooner than it would on a flat earth."
theworldisflat,3a86e2,ChangeThroughTruth,1 point,Thu Jun 18 03:18:47 2015 UTC,"Vanishing point has nothing to do with the shape of the earth, it is merely a property of vision.  It occurs in any direction, not just when viewing things in the direction parallel to the tangent of the surface you are standing on.    The hallway is not a ""flatearth hallway"", it is just a hallway and intended to demonstrate perspective.  It also has nothing to do with curvature.  I'm not even talking about the shape of the earth, I'm just trying to explain vision.  But you don't understand this and just make random arguments involving the shape of the earth.  ""I know the earth is a sphere, so anything I say must be right.""    As a side note, I have noticed how you like to use ""one"" as a strategy to elevate your argument when you know the substance of the argument is poor.  You need to actually understand the concept of perspective before you can continue here.  Not ""flat earth"" perspective or ""globe earth"" perspective, just how vision works."

theworldisflat,3a7oyk,gameplayer123,-1,Thu Jun 18 16:21:01 2015 UTC,"""Hast thou with him spread out the sky, which is strong, and as a molten looking glass?"" (Job 37:18)   AS. ""As,"" is a word used to denote metaphor. Just like any book we read today.    ""It is he that sitteth upon the circle of the earth, and the inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers; that stretcheth out the heavens as a curtain, and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in"" (Isaiah 40:22)   The Earth would look like a circle from any single vantage point even if it were a sphere.   "" Then spake Joshua to the Lord in the day when the Lord delivered up the Amorites before the children of Israel, and he said in the sight of Israel, Sun, stand thou still upon Gibeon; and thou, Moon, in the valley of Ajalon."" (Joshua 10:12)   God can stop the Earth moving through the sky as easily in a spherical view of Earth as in a flat view of Earth. There are no limits to His power.    ""He stretcheth out the north over the empty place, and hangeth the earth upon nothing."" (Job 26:7)   The Earth is hanging upon nothing. It is suspended in empty space.   ""The tree grew, and was strong, and the height thereof reached unto heaven, and the sight thereof to the end of all the earth"" (Daniel 4:11)   Another use of the word Heaven is for the skies. The birds in the heavens for example.   ""Again, the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain, and sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them"" (Matthew 4:8)   Satan could have been given the power to show Jesus the whole of the Earth at once. There are many miracles throughout the Bible as I am sure you would agree.   ""Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and they also which pierced him: and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him. Even so, Amen."" (Revelation 1:7)   Definitely possible on a ball.  It does not state that every eye shall see Him at once from Earth. Every eye shall see Him though. The Semi colon denotes a change. It very well could be a change in location.    ""The Lord reigneth, he is clothed with majesty; the Lord is clothed with strength, wherewith he hath girded himself: the world also is stablished, that it cannot be moved."" (Psalm 93:1)   We can see the type of writing being employed here by looking over the next few verses. "" The floods have lifted up, O Lord,     the floods have lifted up their voice;     the floods lift up their roaring.""  Can a voice be ""lifted up."" Or are we talking in terms of God being glorified. I could go on if necessary but I think we have enough to talk about with just these."

God knows how to talk to His children and He chose many times over to call it a circle, not a sphere or ball. He calls the firmament a vault and describes it as strong. The word literally means dome.  Nowhere does it say He placed other terrestrial bodies out there somewhere. It says He placed lights in the dome."

According to your map wouldn't it be easy enough to just check flight times between locations to get distances?"
theworldisflat,3a7oyk,pyxistora,1 point,Fri Jun 19 01:02:03 2015 UTC,"Yes, and flights match up with the flat earth."
