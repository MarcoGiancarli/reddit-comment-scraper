Does the UK music industry not realise that this is the 21st century? Almost no one buys physical CD's because they're physical media. They buy CD's because they offer better quality music, that they can use on their own personal devices.  Actually, isn't this ruling targeting the wrong group of people in the first place? Out of everyone who buys music, the people least likely to pirate and share, are those who buy physical CD's, over digital downloaders.   Good job UK music industry.

Win10 has RTMed (about time, they only have ten days to get machines installed and on the shelves), and it currently uses KMSv6, supported by KMSpico. Win10 Home will not allow you to turn off updates, but if you're pirating, you won't be pirating Home unless you're retarded.  Windows 10 Pro will allow you to limit updates to fixes only by choosing the slower business route. This will only delay ""feature"" updates for about 6 months, but that's plenty of time to allow KMSpico to update from KMSv6 to KMSv7 or whatever is required. Besides all that, rebooting into safe mode will allow you to uninstall any update that was automatically installed, not that I think you'll need to do that.  Beyond pirating the OS, pirating anything else won't change at all. I don't log in with a MS account (and I'll continue to avoid using cloud services by foreign corporations), but if you already use one with Win8/8.1 there's no difference with Win10. If you don't log in with a MS account, you still won't be required to with Win10 (unless you're using the free Insider Program version). Practice sceptical computing and you'll be fine.  I'm planning on upgrading my desktop, laptop, and HTPC within a couple of weeks of the Win10 launch. MS isn't about to shoot themselves in the foot by locking down an OS that is widely used in business (and businesses are MS's biggest cashcow).

I call it crAppcake because it doesn't host any files, but instead links you to file sites which are often unreliable.   Cydia is the package which is installed when you root an iPhone, the process called jail breaking. It is an installer which allows you to install .deb files, which are iOS executables.

Their pay day isn't coming from regular consumers and never has. It's all about commercial licensing and market share.   Things like google apps and gmail are great... but when we want real work done we're using microsoft office and then converting it for sharing. Businesses have built their entire work flow around excel. Outlook and exchange drive small business for simplicity like nothing else. Even large solutions like citrix are falling to pieces in the wake of what microsoft offers with terminal services and their SAAS offerings. That's where they make their real money.

Also Microsoft can't simply change the activation method for their volume licensing because that would be a huge mess up for corporations. Thus, the KMS-server emulation will work as good as it has today.  I remember that I went from Win 7 Pro with AutoKMS to Windows 8 Pro without any issues - autokms kept activating.

We're even beginning to see some 4k content being produced. Games have transitioned from being a few CD's each being 700 odd mb or a few GB on a DVD to being up to 50GB in size. Bluray movies frequently break 50GB in size when ripped as discs. Music is the only thing that hasn't increased in volume in the sense that mp3 has pretty much always been the standard. Only recently have you even been able to buy flac files digitally. On top of this, DVD's are coming with things like dolby 5.1 surround and require dual layers, as well as some artists releasing blurays of their music.  So this metric is flawed because I'd wager since 2008 the amount of content downloaded for a single product has increased more than 44%. It's probably closer to 88%."

That fact that the volume being transferred is only up by 44% when file sizes have increased 10x means that fewer files are being shared.   Music size have also crept up. Used to be that 128k was the standard, but now increasingly 192 and 320 are the common quality.   Aside from this article not understanding that, he also states that a CD = 650mb, and that is something that hasn't been true for about 20 years now."
Piracy,3dlk4x,merelyadoptedthedark,2,Fri Jul 17 10:53:11 2015 UTC,"That's my point. We're downloading 44% more data but for maybe at best 20% more content. 7 years ago 5GB would get me a season and a half of TV. Now it might get me half a season at decent 720p. Maybe only 2-3 episodes at full HD and up. Point being everybody is downloading more, not just pirates. Even when controlling for market expansion.   I don't know if music quality has changed considerably. I've been a huge music consumer ever since Kazaa and WinMx and while a good portion of music was at 128 radio quality on those p2p networks there were a number of VBR and 192kb/s floating around even for some of the more obscure artists. As soon as torrents came around 320kbps audio was common because people were uploading whole albums. This was only around 2005. Not much has changed, other than more people have devices that play mp3's and we see less low quality single mp3's being downloaded. However, the rise of youtube probably muddles this somewhat because there's a ton of piracy of music through that, it's just not enforced terribly actively. Music size has increased, but not dramatically so like all the other popular forms of media."

No way around it. If they didn't, media wouldn't thrive in the economy and pretty much be ignored. However, locking it down is just fueling piracy even further.  Really, what needs to happen is a direct payment way to compensate artists/creators for their work, but also build a society in which that's done (but not cracking down on free usage of media, and also piracy).  How you'd do that is an unknown. Since they are directly against each other. It's a tough question, and no one is bothering to tackle it."

But for some scaled-up works (major movies), there are people who want to be compensated for no work at all. How is it fair that they get money for it? No one ever promised them an investment model.  It's much simpler though if we look at the lone individuals. If a choreography comes up with a new dance (dances are copyrightable) and you then start dancing this dance... why is it fair that you pay that choreographer? Did they do something that entitles them to a tax on that dance for the rest of eternity? When you dance the same dance, what work are they doing at that moment that qualifies them for compensation?  And it's not just dance. This holds true for all works.  Society did you people a favor... we granted you a privilege because we wanted to reward you. But then you all went apeshit, used that wealth to bribe Congress to extend copyright's scope and duration, and now we are where we are.  So no, it's not fair.   media wouldn't thrive   A bullshit lie. A farcical prediction coming from people who couldn't correctly predict the sun rising tomorrow.

Piracy,3dlk4x,NoMoreNicksLeft,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:30:51 2015 UTC,"It's nice. Not fair.   Well no. It is fair. If we're going to rely on a capitalistic system, and we want people to create stuff, it's fair to compensate them for their work. Like every other work.   there are people who want to be compensated for no work at all.    Who, exactly? A lot of the time when people say this, they simply don't understand what the people actually do. Either way, I'm more of talking about the actual creators themselves. Not necessarily the people who market/sell it. Just because it's a larger budget creation doesn't mean the developers don't deserve to be compensated for their time/effort.   If a choreography comes up with a new dance (dances are copyrightable) and you then start dancing this dance... why is it fair that you pay that choreographer?   Physical motions I'd say are fair to be able to reproduce. However, if you had filmed the person, and then started spreading around that film for free (despite the initial designer/dancer's wishes) then you'd have a problem.  Likewise, I don't see the problem of, say, making a Mario fan game and spreading it around. I do see the problem of taking a couple million dollar production of a new Mario game (official and is trying to be sold) and then spreading it around.   Did they do something that entitles them to a tax on that dance for the rest of eternity?    Again, the issue isn't about ownership, but rather compensation for work. If we don't compensate for creative work, no creative work will be done. And certainly not high-budget creations.  Things like older video games aren't really an issue, since they have been on the market, and the devs have clearly been paid. Same goes for older music/movies/books/etc.  Again, the point I'm making is that creators should be compensated and rewarded for their work. This is why the copyright system exists in the first place: to put a limit on how long people own the rights to what they created, so they can profit. And then people can share and spread it as they please, after a certain amount of time (originally like 10-20 years).  However, that system has been abused to hell and back.   When you dance the same dance, what work are they doing at that moment that qualifies them for compensation?   That's a tough question. They initially designed the motions. But is that worth compensating? Likewise, if you write a sentence, and someone simply says that sentence, is that worth compensating? What if they just say the whole book that you wrote?  Creative work in general is easily reproducible. Which is why we are having this discussion in the first place. There's no hard physical limit on how quickly it can be copied shared. Which is why this discussion needs to be had.  To say ""oh it doesn't matter that the Dwarf Fortress guy spent 10 years working on his game, he shouldn't get a penny and everyone should get it for free with no compensation to him"" is a bit ridiculous.  But on the other hand, saying ""well he spent a day working on this, so now if you want to play it you have to pay him for eternity"" is equally ridiculous.   Society did you people a favor...   By ""you people"" who are you referring to? Content creators?   But then you all went apeshit, used that wealth to bribe Congress to extend copyright's scope and duration, and now we are where we are.   Well I personally didn't do that. And I agree. the current copyright system is shit. Definitely needs to be reworked.   So no, it's not fair.   That wasn't my question. My question wasn't about how it is now. But how it should be. It's a tough problem. If you don't compensate creators, you get no creations. But if you enforce it, you have the whole piracy debacle.   A bullshit lie. A farcical prediction coming from people who couldn't correctly predict the sun rising tomorrow.   You do realize I'm on ""both sides of the fence"", right? I pirate, and I create stuff. I'm more or less indie. I still hold this to be true. If you don't compensate work, that work won't be done. That's pretty much a driving force of capitalism and property ownership in general.  I guarantee you this is the case. At this point, piracy isn't widespread enough for it to be a huge issue. And certainly piracy does play both a beneficial and harmful role to content creators.  Without fair compensation to content creators, you'd ultimately get something as popular as fan translations. Which are few and far between. Or perhaps 'truly free apps' with no ads and such.   What needs to happen is that copyright proponents need to be punished harshly until they remember their place.   I agree. The current copyright system needs to go. It's not doing anyone besides some huge company copyright holders a favor.  That doesn't solve the issue of ""work requires compensation"" though. Here's the paradox:  As long as things cost money, people are going to pirate those things if they can.  If people don't pay for and buy things, there's little/no incentive to create them.  How do we get to a point where people are fairly compensated, people are willing to compensate for the work, and there's no greedy middle men?  Ultimately, the people who you are complaining about got into the game because they had name+money. So that they could distribute the little guys' work. The partnership worked well for a while, until the big guys realized they had complete control. Once the internet showed up, we could have fixed the problem, but we didn't.  Things like bandcamp, soundcloud, etc are moving in the right direction though.  As I said, the problem still stands. Just eradicating copyright won't fix it (though it'll be a step in the right direction). There's also the issue of too many creators flooding the market and reducing value as a whole.  Ultimately, I think it's a societal change that's needed: to actually want to spend money to support smaller and more independent devs. Along with perhaps a taxation/economic change, which reduces the spending strain on non-creative goods and encourages spending on creative work."

This is not the only such movie I have found (though admittedly, there are very few like this).  As for no bluray, you are correct, But on a film shot in the last 10 years, give or take, that doesn't mean anything... the source is quite possibly digital, and definitely high resolution (whether that is 35mm, or some Red camera in hd, I do not know).  There are several such older movies, and I have less of an explanation for those. It might mean that they did a quick-and-dirty telecine on the 35mm but didn't properly remaster it for bluray (since that can cost a few hundred thousand).

Part that, and part so they can watch it later, in high quality. It depends on country's laws, but in general - yes. Torrenting implies you also upload content, and that ranges from misdemeanour to criminal offense, again depending on your country. Hard to say. Generally there are two schools of translation - literal one with hundreds of TL notes, and ""westernized"" subs that aren't extremely faithful to source material, but translate jokes and idioms in a way Western audience will get them. Official subs tend to mix the two, and unofficial subs tend to pick either extreme."

Piracy,3dde0m,Amosqu,0,Wed Jul 15 12:38:08 2015 UTC,"1) They're still working on it, I'd say. Probably once the Trans-Pacific Partnership gets ramrodded through the Senate and intellectual property laws are normalized on both sides of the Pacific, the Japanese government will swing into action and try to take down the more egregious offenders.    2) One of the common arguments for torrenting versus streaming is that there are occasionally video artifacts that come from streaming video. This is normally found in the same group of anime watchers that likes to upgrade their shows to 60 FPS at every opportunity.    3) Streaming is generally regarded as safe in almost every instance, at least when compared to torrenting. After all, detecting IP addresses in a torrent is relatively simple and can be done without any legal barriers. Detecting IP addresses for streaming users, on the other hand, requires a court order. And that's a lot more work for a lot lower payoff.    4) In most cases, fansubs are better than official subs. The major groups such as Vivid, Underwater, gg, and CommieSubs will regularly put out a product that is superior to the best official subtitles. Of the official subtitles, only those done by Crunchyroll are worth a damn. Funimation is generally regarded as garbage throughout the community."
Piracy,3dde0m,porpoiseoflife,0,Wed Jul 15 17:39:35 2015 UTC,"Why is it that you don't hear about people getting in trouble for illegaly downloading or streaming anime?   Here? Because Japanese companies don't have US copyright protection. In Japan? You hear people getting arrested and fined all the time. Mainly it's Japanese guys who upload the RAWs.   With Japan's government taking a stand starting last year, and the companies who own the rights are more than capable of going after people, why does nothing ever happen?   Because they have no legal power in other countries.   Why do people download or torrent anime, as opposed to streaming?    Online web streams are just these downloads, but crap quality, with watermarks, ads, etc. and generally lower quality and unstandardized releases. Downloading allows you to get the exact quality, sub group, etc. that you like.   Is it just because those people want a copy of it on their devices?   That's part of it.   Is streaming generally safer as opposed to downloading the file from a website, or torrenting?   Depends on what you mean by 'safer'. If you mean in terms of DMCA notices, it really doesn't matter. Anime is small enough for it to not matter, and no Japanese company has legal power about that. If you mean viruses/adware, then the torrents are safer.   Nowadays how are fansubs compared to official/liscnsed subs?   Opinion, really. IMO it's more or less the same quality of translation. Fansubs tend to be 'prettier' and more literal. Official/licensed tend to be more bland, but more localized so it's a 'smoother' experience for US people."
Piracy,3dde0m,Kafke,0,Wed Jul 15 23:22:54 2015 UTC,As someone doing this for over a decade here is the short answers.   International Law Enforcement Sucks Much higher resolution and can use programs like Smooth Video Project to turn your lame 24FPS fight scenes into glorious 60FPS fight scenes. Read above streaming sucks. I have a powerful media pc for my living room 60inch with a DTS surround system. Sometimes I like to watch it on that no matter where I downloaded the file. Bluray releases don't have that stupid japanese law that limits the amount of flashes of light in a particular scene to prevent seizures. Never had issues probably never will. Official sometimes tend to westernise some japanese phrases which subs tend to give you direct translation with a explanation.
Piracy,3dde0m,llsektorll,-1,Thu Jul 16 06:22:53 2015 UTC,"Why is it that you don't hear about people getting in trouble for illegaly downloading or streaming anime?   Actually a good question. First, we have to define ""trouble""...  ""Type 1"" is trouble where US Federal prosecutors (or their equivalent in other countries) get involved and charge people with felonies. This trouble is rare, while technically you may be committing a felony when downloading anime (and if not technically a felony, US Attorneys get creative and can convince a judge it's not the misdemeanor anyway)... it is too much effort to bust Jim Bob the torrenting dufus. No one gets promotions for that.  ""Type 2"" is your ISP sending you a letter/email. This happens because some people decided that they'd go into the business of being snoops for Hollywood. They're probably best thought of as private detective agencies, though they don't do usual PI work. They just write software that sees who connects to a torrent (since technically, everyone is uploading and downloading both, they get your IP address from this). They look through the list for any IP addresses assigned to the United States (or your country), and then they look up which ISP was assigned that address. Then they send a letter (probably electronic, not paper) to your ISP. The ISP forwards this on to you. Some ISPs are starting to cancel people for too many such letters. The PI company doesn't know who you are, unless you panic and call them or whatever.  So, why not anime? Because the type 2 trouble isn't free. Those companies are paid by the likes of Paramount and HBO to do this. And if the company that owns the rights to the anime doesn't pony up some cash, no one bothers. Sometimes this does happen, but mostly only if an American company buys the rights to the anime. I do not know if Japanese companies do this in Japan, but they tend not to do it in the United States (no point if they're not selling it here themselves).   Why do people download or torrent anime, as opposed to streaming?   Sometimes they want their own copies. As often as not it's habit... streaming wasn't feasible until a few years ago.   Is streaming generally safer as opposed to downloading the file from a website, or torrenting?   Safer because your IP is only exposed to that website. If that website were to be seized and the feds get involved, they might find your IP in log files.   But unless SOPA or a similar bill passes, you're not making a copy... so no copyright infringement. The feds wouldn't bother to prosecute anyway, would be a proper shitfest. And it's doubtful (but by no means guaranteed) that they could legally give the list of IPs to Hollywood so that they could sue.  So yes, it's slightly safer for you, the person watching the stream. But the risk from torrenting (if you're careful, use a vpn) is already small anyway."

I've only had that work on Power amp. Otherwise, there are options to send app verification to this app instead of google play, and even patch google play itself!

Piracy,3dcn5x,bakageta,4,Wed Jul 15 06:31:59 2015 UTC,"Personally, a modded play store has the best success, followed by the xposed module, and finally the standard apk and dalvik patchers. Disable the google ad service, block ads in the hosts file, and you're mostly covered there. Apps will have empty space in place of ads, rsther than patching individual apps to remove the element entirely.   The built-in options address off the shelf drm, but there are apps with more custom drm that either use a custom patch, or don't have a patch available.  This works well for casual sharing, allowing unpatched paid apps to pass license. Acquiring a paid app from a friend will typically run without troubles. You could source them from public sources as well, but you run the risk of questionable apk files. It's more useful for running unlicensed full versions than patching free versions, but sourcing is harder than just installing free versions. The refund patch worked last I knew, but you won't get updates to the app and you can only refund an app once. I imagine google tracks abusers of this, and bans for it, so be warned there."

Piracy,3d8jpg,DeepReally,53,Tue Jul 14 13:43:00 2015 UTC,"This was debunked years ago.  Yes, the game company put up a fake torrent but they neglect to say that a much more popular torrent featuring the real (cracked) game was up before theirs.  The cracked game did not have the problem that this article suggests, that was something only the game company's fake torrent had.  The pirate torrent got far more downloads (due to being a recognized uploader) than the game company's one, which they took down after only a few hours.  As the article says, his ""friends"" helped seed - in other words, most of the connected peers were in on the scam.  There is no evidence to suggest this fake version of the game was ever widespread.    It is possible that the one or two people that may have downloaded the fake game in the few hours it was available made those forum posts about piracy.  It is also possible that the game company used shill accounts (they already admitted to roping in friends to the hoax).  I can't say for certain which it is but what is certain is that the fake torrent never reached ~3K downloads.  That bit is pure bull."
Piracy,3d8jpg,TaiBoBetsy,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:47:50 2015 UTC,I tried downloading the game a week after steam. It was the tainted product. Took me 30 minutes of playing.

This is the hardest part to get across to people. People aren't stealing anything from you, unless you are counting your bandwidth, from the games communicating home, and that is a separate issue.  You can't count the number of people who downloaded the game as people who would have purchased. Give people a reason to purchase your game.

What they did was copy and distribute the game in a way that does not respect the copyrights. Stealing is illegal, and copyright infringement is illegal. Not sure what point you are trying to make."
Piracy,3d8jpg,kylekornkven,2,Tue Jul 14 17:17:10 2015 UTC,"Nobody broke the law here.  The game developers gave out the cracked version via torrent.  His argument that ""93.6% of players stole the game"" is wrong.  Nobody that used his torrent stole it."
Piracy,3d8jpg,tumescentpie,2,Tue Jul 14 20:10:49 2015 UTC,My point is that copyright infringement isn't exactly what they did either. My point is that piracy shouldn't be illegal. My point is that copyright law is too strong. My point is that when you manufacture software you are breaking supply and demand by having a supply that is nearly infinite.
Piracy,3d8jpg,SunSaffron,2,Tue Jul 14 17:41:40 2015 UTC,"I would honestly argue the opposite. As an artist, all of my works have an implied copyright, and I make money from that artwork. If someone illegally downloads a copy of my work and starts selling it, I get hurt financially. Don't tell me that I get more market exposure which drives sales, because its not individuals who would steal my work, but rather a company that wants to use an image without paying for a license. When someone buys a game, they are not ""buying"" the game. That would imply they are buying the source code, and all rights to the game, and that is pretty pricey. Instead, what a consumer is actually purchasing is a license to use the compiled software under a limited scope of terms. Saying that the supply of compiled software being infinite is a moot point because piracy is founded on infringing of the copyright not the availability of the software i.e. using and distributing software without the appropriate license."
Piracy,3d8jpg,tumescentpie,2,Tue Jul 14 18:13:54 2015 UTC,"As an artist if you had been born at any point before the age of recording and near free copies you would be either: Very poor and/or traveling a lot.  The idea that we pay for virtual works is rather new and it appears to be fleeting. Van Gogh died penniless. Oscar Wilde, Johannes Vermeer, Edgar Allan Poe, the list can go on and on and on.  If someone downloads your work you are be being hurt financially, if you are paying for the bandwidth. Other than that you can only argue that you might be being hurt by it. Just because a person downloads something, doesn't mean they were ever going to buy it. That is the fallacy, this binary argument, and it is bullshit.   The infinite supply isn't a moot point. It is the reason that the moral argument can't be made. It is a huge part of why it isn't stealing. Taking one from your supply doesn't reduce it by one.  There are a few other issues at work here. Maybe you as an artist suck at distribution and marketing. These are skills that you might not have. If others are getting your product (of which you have an infinite amount) to the consumer for a cheaper price (the cost of electricity and bandwidth) then you are going to have a problem.  The support of art by buying works is fading, because the works are now digital. We are headed back towards a place where people who have wealth support artists directly (iTunes). Which is the way it was during the renaissance. People who pay for digital items are supporting the creator of the digital work. There are other ways they can support the creator, but this is the most tangible way.   Piracy should be celebrated. One more anecdote. There was a group of bay area thrashers that got popular by its fans circulating mixtapes and recordings from their shows. They were part of an underground music community. Eventually a copy of No life 'till leather ended up in a record shop called Metal Haven. This allowed Jon Zazula to help the band record Kill 'Em All (originally titled Metal up your ass). That band was Metallica."

I'm a photographer, and if someone copies one of my images from my website, and begins using it for whatever purpose, commercial or otherwise, they are breaking federal copyright law. I actually don't have problems releasing photos for free, in cases of a shoot for a non profit, and if you asked me what you wanted to use my image for, I'd be very flexible in licensing. But to say people should be allowed to copy and use my work without my permission just because ""the supply is infinite"" is ethically wrong."

Piracy,3d8jpg,tumescentpie,0,Tue Jul 14 19:52:44 2015 UTC,"Explain to me why it is ethically wrong. Because as I see it you did work once. You are now able to sell that work as many times as you see fit. Does that not strike you as wrong?  Furthermore, copyright is bad for creativity. We can thank companies like Disney for making these laws even worse for society. To go off on another tangent: Disney took works that were in common usage and reworked them to be able to copyright. Then they fought for strong copyright laws that protect these works. This is theft, stealing the foundations of creative work from the future."
Piracy,3d8jpg,SunSaffron,-2,Tue Jul 14 19:13:12 2015 UTC,"They are not buying the rights to my work, which would be a work once, sell once scenario. They are buying a license to use my work according to the terms in the license. Each license is unique, and may be different, if the license is for commercial or personal use or a combination. Therefore, yes it is ethical, as each sale represents a different use by a different entity and work needs to be done to draft up the terms, meet with the client, handle all the paperwork and payment, and finally, deliver the images. These sales are not based on work of creating content, they are based on work related to licensing. This is why a license to use the images is cheaper than buying the work, because buying the work and rights is a one time sale. Secondly, Disney's adaptations of Grimms fairy tales are hugely different from the actual stories. Grimms fairy tales are much darker and gruesome than Disney's films. Since the films are that different from the original story, they can legally obtain a copyright."

I can tell you exactly where the ""Piracy is not stealing because stealing means you deprive the owner of his possession"" argument gets us. It gets us here. That argument has been made for 15 years. And this is where we are. Square one. Do those of you parroting it think that by adding your voice to the dog pile, something different will happen? Insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different outcome.  Another oldie but goodie is ""Piracy increases sales due to hype and word of mouth."" See above, but also, no it doesn't. If User A pirates a game, User A is probably not encouraging Users B-Z to go buy it. User A is probably burning them copies. How does that help?  I'm not on Big Content's side here, but I do believe strongly in supporting independent and local artists, be they musicians, craft beer brewers, video game developers, or whatever. You wanna pirate Skyrim, my favorite game, be my fucking guest, I really don't care. I love what Bethesda is doing, but they won't feel your lost sale. I bought the game three times anyway. PC, Xbox standard, Xbox Legendary. Also bought the DLC piece by piece on PC. Oh, and I did pirate it first — legit ""will it run on my system"" case. It did, and after a time (longer than I'd like to admit) I paid up, more than twice even. So that does happen, with some of us. But something like Brothers, or Fez (yeah the guy's a dick but he made an amazing game), or Monument Valley on phones? Pay up, support great games that aren't backed by a major financier. Or, like the article says, only blame yourself for the new wave of ""free to play"" and ""pay to win"" games. I fucking hate mobile gaming, but Monument Valley won me over. I paid $4 for the base game and $2 for the expansion. Six bucks for a simple, yet beautiful game. Heavily inspired by the artist M.C. Escher, a favorite of mine. So, win win all around."

The court order route is further dissuaded by the fact that Canadian law puts a $5000 cap on the damages they can seek, or as low as $100, unless they can prove that you were pirating for commercial purposes (eg. selling pirated discs).

Piracy,3cwx4u,spinja187,2,Sat Jul 11 19:34:10 2015 UTC,"At some point, I read (and I think experienced) that the DeDRM plugin disabled itself for library books and loans.  Yup, here it is in the source code on lines 440-441.  Now, at first glance I'd imagine that you could just remove those lines reroll the plugin and try again, but I've always been too lazy to try."
Piracy,3cwx4u,spinja187,6,Sun Jul 12 02:21:06 2015 UTC,"OK, confirmed that it works with these lines stripped out.  Basically, just download the plugin, unzip, edit mobidedrm.py to remove the lines 437-441 and resave.  Then rezip the plugin (making sure to zip the contents of the folder and not the folder itself) and install to Calibre.  I don't know if there is a convention in this sub for where to host files but I'd be happy to upload my fixed plugin zip if anyone wanted to have it to save themselves the work."

Piracy,3csnst,Buffalo__Buffalo,2,Sat Jul 11 08:11:48 2015 UTC,"Gratis versus libre:       The English adjective free is commonly used in one of two meanings: ""for zero price"" (gratis) and ""with little or no restriction"" (libre). This ambiguity of free can cause issues where the distinction is important, as it often is in dealing with laws concerning the use of information, such as copyright and patents.  The terms gratis and libre may be used to categorise intellectual property, particularly computer programs, according to the licenses and legal restrictions that cover them, in the free software and open source communities, as well as the broader free culture movement. For example, they are used to distinguish freeware (software gratis) from free software (software libre).  Richard Stallman summarised the difference in a slogan: ""Think free as in free speech, not free beer.""     Image i - An advertising mascot dressed as a mug of beer, holding a sign saying ""Piwo gratis"" (Polish for ""free beer"") in the centre of Kraków, Poland, advertising beer being given away without charge.

Piracy,3cvi3g,khannie,2,Sat Jul 11 21:15:42 2015 UTC,"Well, I do have some questions. Is it possible to hook up the box to a switch and disable the Wi-Fi? And if so, does the box route ALL traffic through tor? Or is it only for HTML and similar traffic? Can I torrent with it?"
Piracy,3cvi3g,khannie,2,Sun Jul 12 19:24:13 2015 UTC,"Is it possible to hook up the box to a switch and disable the Wi-Fi?   Yes. Technically it's not a supported config (the switch on the LAN side) because we've no idea how many clients you're going to try and feed through it. We've done it ourselves many times though.   And if so, does the box route ALL traffic through tor?   All TCP traffic, yes. Tor doesn't deal with UDP. (I'll skip the next question because I think that answers it, if not, shout).   Can I torrent with it?   It's generally not a good idea to torrent over Tor. Bandwidth on the network is a limiting factor and torrents are notorious bandwidth vacuums. It would be slow and there are known issues with it (which I think might be fixed by a Tor router, but I wouldn't like to say for sure without verifying)."
Piracy,3cvi3g,Jammintk,2,Sun Jul 12 20:50:52 2015 UTC,"Tor is for anonymous usage, not tormenting. The tor network is limited on bandwidth and if you torrent on it, you're going to just make it a bad time for people who legitimately need to use it."

Although we can better confirm this if you give us the mediainfo dump of something 1080p that you're grabbing from there.  1080p streams are usually not very good, though you should be able to get acceptable 720p streams.  Remember that a stream's bitrate needs to be watered down in order to quickly stream to most user's consumer internet without lagging out (that's why the rip is only 2 gigs).

Regardless of how hard you try to regulate it, enforce ownership, etc. It's freely able to be copied and distributed with no physical restrictions. Sure, you can buy that unique sentence, but then share it with everyone.  Ultimately, the only way that will work is ""respect the artist""."

Back in the day people would literally take a book, and write it down word for word and then keep the copy. You can own the physical stuff the words are printed on, but the words themselves can be repeated, quoted, copied, modified, etc.  To solve this issue, we simply outlawed anyone from doing this. And likewise, we outlawed anyone from ""copying that floppy"". It's a failure of a system.   I'm sure you can be sued for copying a book or a thesis. And they're only words and sentences! By copying them, you don't steal them, the author and shops still have their books.   Yup. You can easily just copy a book. It's exactly the same nature as recording radio or TV (both are questionable stuff that were eventually allowed).  As I said, trying to determine rights over information is absurd and silly. There's no way to enforce it. You can try to make copying it illegal, but that won't stop it.  Ultimately, the only sane way to fix it would be to have the 'respect the artist' system in play."

However, I'm not going to buy music I can't really get a taste of. I use spotify because it allows me to listen to new artists and it is extremely convenient for discovering and logging new music.  If a service like this wasn't available I would be back to torrenting albums I have seen recommended.  After finding an artist or song I like, going on beatport and buying their track isn't really a viable option for me and the vast majority of music consumers.

I realize. And I do. Just not through torrents or P2P. It's not popular enough for that. The community for this stuff typically uses dedicated hosts, and has a specific format for sharing. Which I do indeed follow and upload to.  I've actually downloaded improper packaged albums, fixed them up, repacked, reuploaded, and shared.   One person is enough people to keep a torrent going for years, so why aren't you?   Because no one in this particular community uses torrents, I don't have any dedicated hardware for 24/7 seeding, my upload speed is much slower than the dedicated hosts we typically use, etc.  Quite frankly I don't see the point in running a seeding torrent 24/7 for one hopeful random guy who happens to stumble upon the file (when the initial go-to is for the dedicated hosts).  If I had direct access (rather than grabbing random web uploads), I'd certainly pop them onto some torrents, start a tracker, etc. But until then, it's best to go with the flow, and create a standardized system for sharing this stuff, rather than try to have competing systems.  The biggest issue at the moment is a centralized source, which is being solved (and I'm contributing to). Not that the content isn't P2P.  As I said, there's not enough people to make torrenting it worth it.   Edit: It's worth noting that I'm currently working on a program that automatically finds and downloads 320K mp3s of these artists, and downloads and tags them properly.

Piracy,3cbv75,trimbach,2,Tue Jul 7 03:19:40 2015 UTC,"As I said, the scene for this type of music is a mess. Mainly because it's mostly obscure foreign music, and that particular region is big on physical media, rather than digital. So a lot of it is just some english guys over in that country buying the shit, and uploading it onto various file hosting sites (mediafire is popular, but mega is up and coming).  The particular site that I mentioned is dojin.co which is a collaborative effort at organizing and making these albums and uploads easy to search for and find.  As for the software I'm working on, it's a tool that currently rips from the popular streaming site Xiami, but I'm adding in support for downloading 320k mp3s from Netease as well. I'd like to add in Dojin.co support as well, but I'm not sure if that'll happen any time soon.  I might also add in searching doujinstyle (a popular forum for this kind of thing) as well, but maybe not.  As I said, given that it rips from Netease and Xiami, it should work for almost any artist/album you can think of.  Personally I think of it as a kind of popcorn time for music. But it's not really P2P, so I dunno if it counts. I also wrote a little user script to paste in artist music samples onto the last.fm page, so more obscure artists still have sample tracks. Works wonders for me. Check it out. All of those albums I can just click on, and it'll bring me to the album page, where I can listen to the full track, and click download (on either the album itself, or on each individual track). It'll download, and auto tag the MP3s, and then organize them into a folder structure of my choosing. You can see there's a similar artists thing, and a link to the last.fm page.  I'm also planning on adding more info about the artists. I also want to make a JS/HTML5 player on there, but that's something I really haven't looked into yet."

Jazz is a bit more rare, but I see it around.  On Dojin.co you can search by genre, so that should pop up some stuff you like.  I have a feeling there's probably more, and that the people uploading the stuff from Japan just aren't that into other genres.

I'm doing it for myself mostly, since there's no real tools to do this sort of thing, and no real sources with the stuff I like.   Is it open source?   Not at the moment. It's all just some python scripts on my laptop. I want to get the core stuff done before pushing it out into the wild. I'm not opposed to releasing it with the source, or even getting a github thing going on or w/e.   Also would you mind hooking me up with some of this foreign goodies?   If you want the stuff I've been messing with, here's my sources:  http://dojin.co (as I mentioned)  http://www.xiami.com (this one is blocked in the US, so you need a chinese proxy to access it. Alternatively you can hax the api like I'm doing).  http://music.163.com (this one is available here in the US, but still chinese. Many grooveshark users have hopped here. Limits to 192k without an account or hax which I have.)  Xiami has low quality stuff, since it's all user-driven. Typically like 128k. Not the greatest, but it works as a last resort. The music.163.com site (netease) is pretty good, and once you exploit the api you can get 320k from there. And has almost all the same stuff and doesn't require a proxy.   But dojin.co is my main stop since I discovered it. Has pretty much all the new stuff coming out and an active community participating.  Before dojin.co I used http://www.doujinstyle.com, which is a forum for this type of thing. It's a horrible format, but they have links to all the new stuff as soon as it comes out.  Naturally there's still stuff on the web that's not on these sites, but they capture most of it. DoujinStyle at least has lists of all the stuff coming out, even if they don't have the download, so you know what to look for.  If you happen to be in japan, you can go to comiket or m3 where most of this stuff is released and sold.  If you speak Japanese, you might be able to find some Japanese online stores willing to ship overseas, but it's all in Japanese, and payment requires yen. And presumably most don't ship internationally.  Baidu is like google, but chinese. And is a godsend for finding new RAR archives of recently released albums.  As I said, it's sort of a mess at the moment, which is why I'm hoping Dojin.co gets big and has an API, and why I'm making my tool.  Last.FM has a lot of info on these artists and related artists if you like exploring. Not many other music sites even acknowledge their existence. As I said, you'd be hard pressed to find it on any english service that isn't directly related to pirating this stuff."

I've had this dream/idea rolling around in my head to scrape these various sites (and last.fm and other related info sites) to compile my own music database. To have a full fleshed out tool for looking up music info, lyrics, artists/albums, have proper tagging, etc. And then for the pirates have a tool to download it as well. :)  If you like automated ID3 tagging tools, you'll learn to hate them when getting into doujin stuff. Tags are almost always a mess when you DL the music, and the tagging tools don't recognize the artist/album/track. So you end up having to tag by hand a lot of the time.  Just an obscure music lover's dream :P"

Piracy,3cbv75,whatsthepointanyways,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:06:27 2015 UTC,"This is what you should see when you visit the site. It is indeed 100% safe. I've used it for over a year now, have contributed to the site, and have talked with the guy who made it. It's still a WIP, and indeed beta. And the website itself is a bit weird on how it functions.  Honestly, the site is a bit unintuitive at first. I've never had any clickjacking occur on the site.  Or did you mean after you left the site (by clicking on the download or sample links)? The site doesn't actually host any content. It's just a list of links. Each album 'uploaded' contains two external links (that make you leave the site). The first is a sample link, and typically leads to youtube, soundcloud, or the artist website. The other is a download link, which commonly leads to mega, mediafire, or some other file hosting service.  Could you post a screenshot of what you mean? If there's a legitimate problem with the site, I'm sure the dev will fix it. He's a well known and respected member of the doujin community. And the site has plenty of users.  IMO, dojin.co is a lot safer than randomly searching the net for album rars.  Edit: If you're concerned, here's the dev's twitter account. I had to message him to get an invite when the site first popped up. Nice dude. But he's in china ATM, so no work can be done on the site right now. And if you browse doujinstyle you'll probably see him around. I think most of the dojin.co users go there as well."

Piracy,3cbv75,z0mz0m,3,Tue Jul 7 03:29:12 2015 UTC,"My music drug of choice is Doujin (Symphonic) Gothic Pop/Metal. There's maybe 10-12 popular (within the scene) artists that make this style of music. I get excited when I find more. Shit's hard to find.  The overarching scene is ""Doujin"" music, which is essentially Japanese indie. Shit's flooded with touhou stuff, like 300-600 albums released each year, all touhou. It's ridiculous, honestly. Lots of electronic/edm music as well.  Dojin.co is the centralized site that I mentioned. It's new (like released this year or last), and doesn't yet have everything.  Before that, things were passed around in forums like doujinstyle and obscure chinese file upload sites.  Most of the stuff is uploaded to things like mediafire and mega, since there's not enough people looking for the stuff to make it worth seeding. Though the more popular stuff does make it's way to private trackers eventually.  The tool I'm working on currently rips from the two chinese streaming sites Xiami and Netease, since Chinese people seem to be larger fans of Doujin than americans/english speakers are. That, and they have a more relaxed copyright thing, making these sites easier to come by.  Check out my last.fm account for my listening tastes. Some of my favorites are Mamyukka, Queen of Wand, -LostFairy-, Yousei Teikoku, Denkare, Yura Hatsuki, Seraph, Ariabl'eyes, etc.  As I said, none of those artists can be found on something like Spotify/Google Music, let alone any sort of torrents. Go check What.CD, I'll wait. Yousei Teikoku is on there, since they got licensed and grabbed by a large anime music production company (Lantis records). But even then you'll still have a hard time finding them on almost any service. Good luck finding all their albums.  As I said, it's obscure shit. I'm frequently the top listener for these artists on Last.FM, and I hardly listen to music! Queen of Wand in particular has 554 on Last.FM. Yea. And if you check my dojin.co account (page is a WIP), you'll see I have indeed uploaded a few albums to the site."

This ICANN thing is being dressed up to be about IP protection, but all speech needs to be protected, not just speech we like or want to support. People with controversial things to say have just as much right to speak as anyone else, regardless of your beliefs whether ""tld ownership is right for them"" they have the right to do so, and they also have the right to anonymous speech. That's one of the hallmarks of free speech, anonymity.   Trying to take anonymity from domain name ownership is just another attack on free speech, whatever the reason behind it.   And if you don't think it will be abused to silence and censor people that have unpopular opinions, you haven't been paying very close attention"
Piracy,3cf9wq,Huh9,0,Wed Jul 8 15:13:09 2015 UTC,"As I already stated, ICANN has never been unclear about this policy. You must provide essential contact information to register a top level domain. However, owning a TLD is not essential for free speech. There are lots of ways to communicate broadly AND anonymously that has nothing to do with owning a TLD. ICANN is the TLD registrar body, and they have had this policy since their founding. The article itself quotes a security researcher who states it has always been a mistake to put your home contact info into the WHOIS database. Nothing has changed on ICANN's end, but their affiliates, who are allowed to register TLDs, have hacked the registration system and basically made it useless.  Domain ownership has never been anonymous.

Ultimately, if such potentially damaging information is going to be mandatory through ICANN, then they should have an obligation to keep that information private and have a strict process by which it can only be provided under very specific criteria. The fact that this is not the case is why the system is the way it is today.   Back when I was hunting down spammers and getting their Internet accounts closed for abuse  I loved using whois and samspade to dig up personal info but even then I could see how it could be misused, and has been; just look at the whole Charles Carreon debacle from a couple years ago.   I disagree with your proposal that there should be some areas where people are entitled to free speech and not others, quite frankly you don't get to carve out areas where people have rights because it's a slippery slope a carved out exception essentially means the rights are, in the end, null and void. That's why it's so important to push back against all such exceptions when they're proposed and this one is no different."

Piracy,3cf9wq,passwordisshared,2,Wed Jul 8 18:14:41 2015 UTC,"I think maybe the disconnect may be coming from the fact that you don't see the need for anonymity. Or, if you do, you don't know how necessary it can be. It's a matter of perspective, to be sure, but my perspective or your perspective is of course not the final word on it.   A Web page is, at its core, an expression of viewpoints. Be it ""I have these things to sell, please buy them"" or ""9/11 was an inside job"" or ""all Jews are useless"" or even ""here are some movies I think everyone should be able to watch, please download them"", it's all expression, it's all speech.   The problem is that what affects a small corner of the Internet, sharing copyrighted content, affects everyone when you make a rule like this. So, as he said, when you make a website mocking Charles Carreon's views, you have a right to do so. If you want to do so anonymously, to prevent yourself from being sued (and those with more money winning despite you bring in the right), to prevent yourself from being swatted, or to even prevent Charles Carleton showing up at your door with a firearm. You have the right to anonymity, because taking away that right means that you don't have the right to speak your mind fully. It's enshrined in the first amendment, and in fact the founding fathers frequently wrote controversial views under pseudonyms. I would expect that America would never have become free without anonymity before the revolution.   I'm sure if you were to think about it, you could think of reasons that some people would need to be anonymous, even up to and including owning a webpage. And, rather than marginalize the exceptions by stating that your need to know who is running the server outweighs their need for protection from harm, realistically you could understand why such an action as this is a step in the wrong direction"

Flashcarts essentially simulate being an actual retail cart and use flash memory instead of ROM. This means you can throw a bunch of ROMS on there (extracted from retail carts) and load them up as you please. R4 is one for the DS.  People have also written home-brew to let you run emulators, which do something similar through software.   so what exactly do I need to purchase because there are so many different cards and do I have to worry about firmware??   You technically don't need to purchase anything, and yes, you do have to worry about firmware. Ideally you'd be looking for a console that's on FW 9.2 or below. Any higher and you're fucked for 99% of the possible hacks/piracy.  If you are on 9.2 or below, you have a lot of options. If you are above, you can only go with Sky3DS. Which is not really recommended.   Also should I get a new memory card?   Depending on what setup you are doing you might need to buy one anyway (microSD). But that's all personal preference, really.   The New 3DS XL uses a micro SD card instead of regular SD cards like older 3DS XL use, does that matter?   For what? MicroSD is just a storage medium. You cannot use a regular SD card in a MicroSD slot, if that's what you are asking. As far as hacking/piracy is concerned, it doesn't matter.  Given that you have a ""New"" 3DS, rather than the OG model, that means you can't downgrade back down to 4.5. Which means you're gonna have to buy something.  Personally, I own Cubic Ninja and use Ninjhax+PastaCFW to pirate stuff. But there's a few other options as well.  The big two are Gateway and Sky3DS. Sky3DS is the only thing that runs on FW above 9.2, but only lets you play 3DS roms. It's severely limited, and not at all recommended.

Piracy,3cerbe,Kafke,1 point,Wed Jul 8 06:11:10 2015 UTC,"im on a really recent 9.8 firmware so it seems I need SKY 3DS   Yup. 9.8 is the newest, and so far only Sky3DS runs on it. Though Ninjhax 2.0 is coming out soon.   why is it not recommended?    Because all it can do is simulate a 1-to-1 copy of a cartridge. It doesn't exploit the system in any way which means you can install CIA files (for patches/updates, dlc, home-brew, etc), you can't use Emunand (to allow you to update on a virtual FW so you don't have to update your system), you can't update the flashcart itself, meaning if it's blocked it's done for. And lots of other things.    It seems pretty good from what I have researched the last little bit.   If your sole purpose is to play 3DS roms and nothing else, and you don't care that it might get patched, then go for it. It's really the only option past 9.2."

Piracy,3cbgbe,Tony49UK,1 point,Tue Jul 7 10:44:19 2015 UTC,Personally I torrent everything a genuine dreambox is about £500 a PC with a decent tuner can do it eg. a Black Gold is about £130.  But when Sky changes the encryption you can get locked out for a while if not permanently.  You also have to pay the card sharing service about £10 a month.  Torrenting is pretty quick and easy.  Qbittorrent is probably the best programme on the market for everything and Popcorn Time is extremely easy from loading it up to watching a tv programme/movie is a couple of minutes.
Piracy,3cbgbe,d4nm3d,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:11:14 2015 UTC,I run a seedbox coupled with Sonarr and it serves all my needs.. however IPTV does intrigue me.  I've run card sharing dreamboxes before and it was great but my internet connection was not reliable enough at the time to ensure the encryption packet got back to me in time.  If the interface was made similar to the SKY boxes then i'd go back to it but the family would have a fit if they had to learn a new interface and lost the series link etc.

I for one usually download stuff I would otherwise never see (for example ALL movies in 3D (get sick in seconds and movie theatres never offer the non 3D version here anymore)). Is that a missed sale? Nope.. If they want my money, offer me the movie in 2D and I'll gladly pay for it.  On music: How is pirating missed sales? Who buys albums anyway? Artists could spread the music they make over spottify or other streaming services (or old school radio) and make money on tours or festivals. There are alot of bands/artists that do it this way already, a good thing if you ask me.  Then on to games: I pirate since no game (since 2006) does demos anymore. Reviews and youtube letsplays / twitch streams can only tell you so much. Half the products released aren't worth their money on release, and pirating serves as a test case for me. 90% of the games I pirate I don't play for more than an hour anyway. And the rest of the games I buy within a few weeks of release, or I'll buy them on the first 50% or more steam sale.  Anyway, back on topic.... Missed sales through piracy? I think that is hard to tell. On movies, music and games I don't believe pirates are the kind of people that would have otherwise purchased the product legally. The way I see it the product now reaches more people than it otherwise would have."

Not personally, of course, but their dragnet scanners are always listening to and recording as much as possible. (Especially initial connections to known VPN providers!) They probably aren't paying attention to me, but the odds they're paying attention to the other end of the exchange - and taking at least a glance at anyone who connects to a foreign VPN - seem pretty good. And the odds that they've compromised a significant number of backbone routers and are automatically MITMing as many key exchanges as possible also seem pretty good.  I realize this is still pretty paranoid, and the actual risk that something like this would really happen to me is incredibly low, but it's definitely possible. I'm looking at it more from a hypothetical viewpoint, how risky it would be if I were some politically important figure who really needed total security from even their own government. e.g. if Edward Snowden had bought a VPN account in some foreign country - even before he was a person of interest to the NSA - it'd be a real concern for him that they might have executed such an attack - as they would on any VPN customer - and would have his keys on file. Or someone in a more oppressive country such as China or North Korea would also have to worry about these types of attacks."

Piracy,3c6huu,Gene_P00le,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:09:41 2015 UTC,"I was saying use tor to setup his vpn account. If the NSA is mitming him there's a less chance they'd be mitming, say, an exit node in romania. Of course they still could be mitming any hops between the exit node and the vpn server/site server, but it's safer depending how much you trust those locations and the route in between. It also increases your chances of detecting a mitm because if the keys don't match up on your next connection, either on a different exit node or on your home network, then that would be a telltale sign."
Piracy,3c6huu,kryptobs2000,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:14:53 2015 UTC,"If one's concern is the NSA the solution is to get off the Internet and start using carrier pigeons, there's not a lot you can do against an adversary that size. If you're already being targeted by them, you've already lost.   As a matter of fact, it's probably safest to assume they're mitm-ing most exit nodes, or that their proxies are. That was always the expectation with Tor: they can track the clearnet traffic without being able to uncover where it originates.   Ultimately if your adversary is the NSA, then piracy is the least of your issues and you may as well clearnet that shit for convenience. A VPN is going to be a very big broken link in the chain and anyone working against that kind of issue should be running their own proxy for security."

Tor only supports TCP so by trying to force Tor to use something it doesn't support, you're setting yourself up for failure right away. But a much bigger reason is the fact that BitTorrent delivers your IP address to the swarm so you can receive traffic. If you use Tor then you're anonymously delivering your IP address, but somehow I suspect this isn't what you're shooting for.   It has virtually nothing to do with the touchy feel ""don't endanger dissidents and reporters"" concept, and everything to do with the fact that it doesn't work to begin with."

It's not that I'm afraid they're watching me; I'm afraid they're watching the VPN providers, anyone who connects to them, and to a lesser extent, everyone, quietly logging everything that might be of interest - and what's more interesting to a spy than the crypto keys of those you're watching?

I think they cannot crack steam the same way. Actually have no clue, if someone followed these events closely, please shed some light!  Someone at cs.rin.ru was trying to emulate the game to run in family sharing with smartsteamemu but I don't think it will work because you are basically sharing credentials of a particular user with everyone, and the moment 1 user fucks up and goes online with the patch (which will happen right away) the original owner will be busted."

If that's true, then no actual Denuvo exploit has been found yet, it's been more about the wall around the door, than the door itself, so to speak. If Denuvo is truly uncrackable, I think the only hope left is that Rocksteady will remove it later to help with performance.

You're talking about ""art potential"" as some singular, universal function present in all forms of art, like ""driving potential"" would be present in automobiles.

Okay , admitted, they have gone a bit to ""glossy"" for my taste, and i do not think that i will ever own a touch device, so keep the preaching about cross platforms till your apple church on fucking friday. That said, i still use windows 8.1, haven't had less blue screens, crashes or performance issues with any windows software, EVER. I think it is a bit silly to skip out on it just due to its (in my opinion) ugly design, specially when you can just smack a skin over and it looks just fine, also every where i read comparisons between it, windows 7 or god forbid Vista, then widnows 8 outperform them both..  So really, why? (there might be reasons that i havent considered, that is why i am asking, not to be a dick (: )"
Piracy,3bwrsd,FountainsOfFluids,3,Fri Jul 3 08:16:38 2015 UTC,"It's more a philosophical argument. It royally pissed me off when MS decided to start treating the desktop computer like a touch screen tablet. I love my mobile devices, but the desktop is a different beast, and it's been my first love since I was a kid. And I will not support any system that takes tablet features and forces a keyboard & mouse system to try to adapt to it.  From what I've heard Win 8.1 fixed many of those problems, but my bitterness remained. Plus as others have mentioned, there is little to no benefit to switching from Win 7 to Win 8.1. Everything I want to do runs perfectly well on Win 7.   When Win 10 is released, I'll give it a try since it's free. And from what I've heard MS has learned its lesson that PC users don't want to be treated like tablet users. We'll see."

So it's maybe 1-2% faster in games? I occasionally game even, but that's not enough for me. It's got a cumbersome UI that is forced onto the user. It's really no more cumbersome for me since I only use hotkeys to access the start menu, but I shouldn't have to do that. The average user is not going to even know about the windows key probably.

You feed this torrent file into whatever client you use to download torrents.  Unless you say what program/client you use, I cannot help with this.  After you download the file, the torrent info page says you should have a .iso and a .nfo. The NFO is just information about the release. While the ISO is presumably what you are after.  Judging by the filename and category, it looks like you are pirating a PC game.  Which means you either need to burn the ISO to a disk (old-school, really), or mount the image on a virtual disk drive (using something like daemon tools.  After that, it should install like normal, and you then take the crack and apply it.  Have you really never torrented a game before?

If they are required to comply with a court order for an investigation, they will magically find a way to keep a log, or else face contempt, which means that they can keep logs, and therefore for all intents and purposes, do keep logs. Anything else is pure hype/propaganda and anyone who believes their vpn keeps no logs is being fooled by word play.   Because of this, worst case scenario, should they decide not to continue offering a lifetime subscription, you will have no recourse, unless you're okay with a log of your activity being provided to whomever you don't want to see it.

A lot of people overall see DRM as useless and dismiss it because they can circumvent it. They are right about it being easy to circumvent, but most of the time they are missing the bigger picture: DRM is not a technical tool. Many see DRM as an attempt to make something bullet-proof in stopping users from copying it and laugh when they find workarounds. Again, this is missing the point. DRM is a legal tool.  All technical means of stopping piracy have completely failed. Every encryption system of copy protection has been broken. The industry learned this after a few failed attempts. From a technical standpoint not much has changed in terms of algorithms or attempts to hide/encrypt data. That's a dead end that almost nobody wastes their time on. All that matters is that some DRM protection exists, no matter how stupid and easy to circumvent.  This is needed because the real trick comes in using the law to force companies to get licenses to make set top players, manufacturer discs, etc. As the supply chain grows it becomes harder to manage and overall were seeing a death of DRM at a device level.

Half a billion dollars in 2 weeks for the new Jurassic Park as an example.  They seriously over value what their product is worth. I'm not going to pay more for a movie than what I can make at work in the time it takes me to watch it.   I'm also not going to pay cable companies for the privilege to watch the advertisement they get paid to show.   And when a whole digital season of a show costs as much as it does to buy a physical copy of it I won't give them any money.  Netflix continues to get my money as it has for many years now. What I can't find there I try my Amazon Prime account, then it's to the torrents.

I doubt it because the colors are so different, but you never know with YIFY  Paul: http://screenshotcomparison.com/comparison/12519/picture:0   Basically just a lot of typical washed out detail loss   Wreck it Ralph: http://screenshotcomparison.com/comparison/10115   This comparison is good for 2 reasons. 1, it an animated film, and people tend to forget that animated films still need the bitrate.  This displays otherwise. 2, the lack of expertise/care YIFY encoders have.  The aspect ratio is off.  There are 2 pixels of black bars uncropped ON EACH SIDE during the encoding process in the YIFY release. Cropping the video is literally the easiest part of encoding, and they still managed to mess it up.

Bitrate under the video stream section (50.0 Mbps in the example). Do this for both sizes, and you can compare the two directly. 1080p needs to be 2.25x the size of 720p to have the same per-pixel bitrate.   (1920x1080)/(1280x720) = 2.25   Normally a higher bitrate doesn't guarantee a better encode, but as they are the same group it should be a similar quality/bitrate for the same movie."

Christ, even the pirate bay has plenty of links to perfectly legal content for download.   They used the concept of piracy to draw attention, and therein lies the problem, because dollars to doughnuts nothing that they actually printed was secret, or a screenshot of the act of committing copyright infringement, or anything like that. It was just information that the media industry would prefer not to be common knowledge. Which is why I led with thoughtcrime, because that's what it essentially boils down to.   If they had created an identical issue, but had phrased it as ""at no time should you go to thepiratebay.am and click on the magnet link for the torrent you want to download. Do not pick a folder for your download to save to"" etc, or if they had created an issue showing how the technologies were legally used, including steps, with a closing paragraph indicating that such apps are used by pirates who visit such links as whatever, then there would be no issue. The problem here is that they did something that certain powerful interest groups found distasteful, not that their actions were actually immoral or illegal. I don't even think they were necessarily guilty of condoning piracy, although without actually reading the content at issue, I'll admit it's purely conjecture on my part.

I exclusively used to buy games on the humble bundle (until they went full steam so you can't get your own copy outside of steam any longer), because they were DRM free and the developers needed my money more than rockstar or Nintendo.   It's a cultural shift, you're going to have to wait for the masses to catch up with where you are before changes start happening. But it always starts somewhere."

Meaning the ""we"" you're referring to is quite small.  I think for the most part video games do quite well with pricing. If you wait a year or two some get as low as $5 or $10. Hell, I have hundreds of games I don't have time for.   The biggest issue is the dlc, but with so many willing to not only pay exorbitant prices, but even pre-order stuff you're not going to affect change.   I honestly don't buy the ""vote with your dollar"" argument. In some circles video games might hold cultural and social relevancy, just like movies and music. That is not an indication that the value of the product is higher for you and thus you should buy it, but simply a public sphere that the market should not enter.   I don't have the cultural requirement for video games so I can easily wait until they're $5. If you can't then pirate them. Most people, apparently, think the $60 is fair, so I think you should take ""we"" out of your vocabulary."

In other words a virus will often have to become a real issue and spread to 1000s before it's added to MSE's database and only then will it often be detected, but by then it could already be too late for a lot of people if it's already done damage.

Piracy,3bk9nr,Tony49UK,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:41:24 2015 UTC,But it's quite likely that MS will disable any boot time loaders (such as softmod SLIC) upon installation of windows 10 (AFAIK it's a boot time program loaded to emulate the SLIC table in BIOS) but I'm wondering whether the BIOS SLIC (As in an actually modified BIOS) would be likely to get the free update? I'm not sure if for that style of activation if all you require is the right BIOS entries or if there will be some other kind of test. Seems I may have to just wait and try it.

The current DRM on Win 10 is pretty minuscule but is probably being held back till later when they release the Release To Manufacturing version.  The game with the hardest version of DRM to crack is Grand Theft Auto V and that was cracked on Win 7 within about 18 hours and 48 hours or so for Win 8/8.1.  A new release of Windows is by far the biggest ""target"" for hackers and they'll be working on it already.  I would be amazed if a crack isn't available within 4 days of release and gobsmacked if it takes a week.  If anybody knows where I can put a bet on how long it will take to crack it, I'll gladly put money on it."

You can be member through invitation or if the site open for signup. Check  /r/OpenSignups/  /r/Invites/  /r/trackers  /r/torrents  For a start, once you joined a private tracker, read the RULES and know about their download/upload policy.

I don't think there's anything that can be done in Photoshop that can't be done in Gimp, it's just that a few tools make some things easier. Gimp can also use some PS things via plugins. Inkscape can be a good alternative to Illustrator. If you really need PS, it generally runs fine via Wine.  Blizzard games tend to run fine via Wine too, and Steam for Linux as I said runs a lot of games now. If you really want to play a Steam game without a Linux version you might have good luck running the Windows version of Steam for it. PlayOnLinux really helps with Wine apps.

If you extract any one of them, it will automatically pull all the data from every rar file. There are little bits of the same files in each one, that's how that particular zipped package works. If you have 37gb or whatever after extraction, it worked correctly. Hopefully 3dm will release some sort of Crack or work around soon, but as of now, I'm assuming it won't be until after the pc game is rereleased.

Piracy,3bdv1u,ddeuced,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:40:20 2015 UTC,"It's anyone's guess, but I believe it has to do with it being the mobile site and/or the ads kat uses. Adaway has yet to add the ads to their url repository. Root is needed for these types of adblocking apps/modules to be effective, because it has to change system files.

Piracy,3bdv1u,ddeuced,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:07:01 2015 UTC,"Nope, that doesn't seem to do much. I believe it's how ads are loaded into the apps themselves. If it's a game or something similar, adaway has the ability to block the request to the ad as the app/game tries to load the ad as if it were a function within the app itself. I'm not sure if you are familiar with programming, but it would make sense if you do. With browsers, it doesn't load the app locally, as a module/function, but rather the website itself is redirecting you, so adaway isn't able to catch the ad/redirect.  Make sense?"
Piracy,3bdv1u,IINSULT,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:45:17 2015 UTC,"ok, so adaway (just like all other similar Fxing apps as far as i know) create 'blocklists' or whatever the correct term in this case would be?  and RE the redirect, there is no way to stop that? yet relatively simple in win OS yeah? ideas why?"
Piracy,3bdv1u,ddeuced,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:12:53 2015 UTC,"My guess is the ability of the ad blocker and how intrusive it can be in a particular app. Apparently adaway isn't able to delve deep enough into an android browser app to catch the url ads/redirect. On Windows, all traffic is accessed through the host file, so it has one gateway that needs to be filtered. Android should work this way as well, but it seems that adblocking apps work on an application level rather than directly with the host file. I may be wrong on this and adaway just isn't able to block all ads/redirects, maybe it needs an update to the block list?"

Regulation makes it difficult to create a competitor. Similarly, left to their own devices, companies will merge and get bought out until only 1 large company is left. At that point, any competition that arises will be forced out of the market by the monopoly (e.g. they could set their prices to 0 or even pay their customers for just long enough to starve the smaller company).  So, both is true. Regulation starves a free market of competition, but unregulated bushiness will naturally lead to a monopoly as well.  Like most things in life.

So what incentives would there be for content owners to accept that kind of system. They make much more money from traditional sources even as piracy might lessen their profits.  Even if billion people would subscribe to your hypothetical service for 10 bucks per month, just divide that for all the movies that have ever produced and you might understand that your idea is retarded.  If it ever come to that point they could for example only show movies in limited amount of art house cinemas with armed guards protecting copies. And they still would make more money than when dividing 10 bucks with whole fucking industry. I mean come on, math can't be that hard...   Given that all of it is digital and therefore would hold virtually no value    Everything about Facebook, Youtube or Google search are digital. Are you honestly saying that they hold virtually no value?"
Piracy,3b54zu,Gene_P00le,2,Fri Jun 26 20:50:26 2015 UTC,"They make plenty of money, true. But not a lot of it is through online revenue. I'm taking something to supplement the current streams, because the fact is people are going to download and share whether the industry wants then to or not, and every year it gets easier and cheaper to do so. I'm just suggesting they find a way to monetize that traffic before it's lost to them completely.   Every person who's frustrated with windowing who turns to piracy to get what they want when they want it is another potentially lost customer, because as soon as they learn how to pirate it's harder to convert them back to a paying customer.   They want to pay, but when they can't, they learn how easy it is to do this instead. Every time that's a list opportunity. Why not gain revenue from that like Netflix has? No money is lost because there's still theatres, bluray sales, whatever. This is just realizing where the world is going and jumping in before it's too late. You say what's their incentive, well how about the fact that eventually there may not even be an industry if they don't learn how to make money from the Internet?   As far as your final point, are you deliberately being stupid? If Facebook and google charged cash money for their services they'd go bankrupt overnight. If the content industry wants to monetize metadata and ad revenue to offer their service and make it free to use like Facebook and google do, more power to them! I'm just suggesting people might be willing to pay for it."

I don't think thats likely, even with incredibly fast internet connections, performance would always be better on a local machine compared to running on the cloud. It will probably be an option, OnLive was probably a bit ahead of its time and something similar will probably take off eventually, Steam already has support for streaming games from other PCs on the same network (which works pretty great even over wifi).  There is the possibility that some MMO games may simply become too big to pirate. Eve-Online is like that now from what i can tell (its too huge of a game world), where as a game like WoW, even though its only supposed to run on blizzard's servers can be run on private (pirate) servers too."

No one service will have a monopoly, so the game publishers would still be releasing some content for the cloud servers to run. It wouldn't be practical (cost wise) for each publisher to run their own cloud gaming servers for every game, they would license it to other cloud operators, and worst case you'd have to wait for someone to leak a copy of that. Thats my guess anyway."

Just like you can't just start your own Google mirror search because you can't access their algorithms and data.  And with technologies like AWS, every company could run their own servers. Of course leaks are always risk, but I think that companies could easily stop that from happening. I mean have you ever head Google's algorithms leaking?"
Piracy,3b8rhs,evilgold,1 point,Sat Jun 27 00:21:07 2015 UTC,"Short of having a monopoly on cloud services (which would violate anti-trust laws here in the US at least), there would always be the option for any new startup to build their own cloud service, and legally license the games. Someone could do this and run their service out of someplace that doesn't have strict laws about, they wouldn't be risking much by leaking the content.   But the real problem with cloud gaming becoming the most popular option is that it will never be as good as local gaming. Developers want to design games to use the latest and greatest GPUs and hardware, there will always be some kind of gap between what kind of quality you get from a stream and what you get locally.  Take data storage for example, your average internet connection these days is probably faster than most old IDE hard drives, but now people are storing terabytes instead of megabytes, so its still better to store things on a local machine. That doesn't mean you can't also use the cloud for some things, but its still better and cheaper to store them locally.    It's possible however that cloud gaming will make piracy a lot less appealing, in the same way netflix, pandora, amazon etc have made made Move/TV and Music piracy less appealing. If you have the choice between paying $5/month for unlimited access to [whatever publisher]'s game library, and you didn't have to install anything or worry about hardware requirements, I'm sure a lot of people might go that route Even so, I pay for netflix and amazon prime and still pirate lots of stuff, so its not like piracy will ever totally die out.   Oh and you actually can run your own google... sort of anyway: https://www.google.com/work/search/products/gsa.html"

Piracy,3b8rhs,pimjppimjp,1 point,Sat Jun 27 00:54:03 2015 UTC,"Well netflix doesn't license it to other cloud providers (although there are lots of shows licensed to both netflix and amazon or hulu), but its still not practical for netflix to host all of their content. Anyone running an ISP (which is not just big companies like comcast BTW) can request a netflix open connect appliance which hosts a local copy of the netflix library. Netflix wanted to give these boxes away to major ISPs, but both verizon and comcast forced them into paying for the privilege of hosting the boxes.  Now I'm sure it would be difficult and totally impractical for a pirate to get one, reverse engineer it and set it up for free, but if the demand was there it could happen.  But what i'm trying to get at is not that such a service would be popular or practical for piracy, i'm just pointing out that its possible and maybe in 10 years or so you'll be able to pick up boxes like the netflix open connect on ebay for a few hundred bucks.  In order for a streaming service to scale, it has to work similar to the netflix model. You can't have all your servers in one place, you want them all as close to possible to consumers so that the data transmission doesn't clog up. When you stream a show from netflix, chances are good that if your on a major US ISP, its your ISP and not netflix that is actually hosting the content."

Good seedboxes will offer extra features. The one I'm using now is seedboxco.net. I paid ~$6 for my first month and have seen good speeds and lots of storage. On top of the seedbox, they offer VPN service through the box (openvpn) and an ownCloud instance (like a private dropbox).  Have only been using them for a few days, but I'm a big fan already."

Much quicker and less fiddly than navigating the menus, especially if you're already on the keyboard, using a trackpad or clitmouse, or simply a quick typist!  Once you get used to them, they're amazing, and very handy even if you're not into keyboard nav.

Just push it out of reach if you're scared.  Now (with a bit of knowledge and experience with keyboard control in applications, and some helpful software that extends this), try doing this with your mouse.  Every time you switch from keyboard to mouse, it takes a little bit of time and effort. Over time, this adds up.   It's a personal, nerdy choice, but a few years ago, I decided to train myself to be quick with the keyboard. Touch typing a customized Colemak layout  on an ergonomic mechanical keyboard, using Vim and Vim-style controls in many programs, a tiling window manager, and many custom binds -- I have a plethora of easy to reach custom keyboard shortcuts - I can change colour temperature, set a timer, control audio and video players, and play back specific chiptunes with a simple mod + x. :P  For everything that isn't bound, there's the CLI, and oh what a well-stocked tool chest it is.

I suppose you can go at the speed you like, but I prefer to type as fast as I can think, and that's why I've chosen this path.  As for surfing in bed, I do not do so for reasons of comfort and ergonomics, but I have considered the possibility of mounting a monitor above my bed (I prefer having my bed on a mezzanine over my wardrobe and storage meaning I'm fairly close to the ceiling, but I recently moved, and don't have this at the moment), and using a split keyboard.  The danger of this, though, is that it could perhaps be considered a little weird, and hard to explain to girlfriends. To prevent destroying the monitor by accidental head bumping, I would perhaps use a sturdy VESA mount, mount the monitor on rails, and increase the distance between the bed and the ceiling.  Then again, perhaps the upcoming VR headsets will permit the user to lay down."

Clearly there's people who have access and release the content elsewhere."
Piracy,3aze2f,Kafke,2,Fri Jul 3 21:33:46 2015 UTC,"To get access, well, one way is to be a supplier to a scene group, you would obviously have to have access to stuff pre-retail (2 weeks for bluray, early music, pre-retail games?) Work in a disc pressing plant maybe? That kind of thing.  There's a lot of sections in the scene, from 0day apps, console, music, movies, tv rips etc etc - depends what you could provide, and whether any groups are looking for suppliers/cappers/crackers/rippers etc.  You could also possibly join a group if you can crack game protection, reverse engineer software (patches/keygens/dongle emulation) - you would have to be insanely smart programmer.  But it's possible that no groups are looking for new people (It's a closed/private scene for a reason, security is number one, and just because hypothetically you started cracking for a group that they would give you a leech slot on a topsite, they wouldn't trust a new person straight away.

So now I have another question: Are all the scene groups in on this? Or are there several different 'private groups' that have their own hordes of data?  And where do scene members 'leak' the stuff first? Naturally it's uploaded to one of these topsites. But after that? Just TPB? Usenet?  I actually haven't really read into how the flow of piracy and content works. I sort of just figured it was a random collection of users who opted in and just released wherever (with different scene groups having their preferred places).  Interesting stuff..."

Scene groups release to sites in which racers bring files to the private tracker/public tracker community. In the case of p2p releases, groups go directly to the community and do not necessarily follow scene rules. There is no point in which these torrents are published to a website owned by that scene group. Skid row websites are entirely published by random people from the Internet who post torrents or magnet links that direct to re-uploads from the official skid row team.

Get a flash drive that's 4~8gb. Mouat the iso using daemon tools. Use rufus to burn the image to your flash drive. Insert flash drive into new computer. Boot up new computer & get to the bios (usually f2 or delete or something similar). Find boot manager and boot from the flash drive. Follow windows install instructions. Done! :D

Piracy,3art4j,moghat,9,Tue Jun 23 21:49:28 2015 UTC,"BS. They work in all setups, cause they trick denuvo to think that way. The first releases of the cracks are usually for certain hardware configurations, and thats why it takes longer to crack, because you need to crack for you hardware first, and then you have to trick denuvo into accepting every hardware.   Problem is that you have to do it with everydamn game and it takes more time then other games, but if someone can't play dragon age its probably their fault for not knowing how to apply the crack to the game.  A bit off topic, but I hope publishers realize that DRM does them more harm then good.

Lords of the Fallen:   Tyminski also said that sales for Lords of the Fallen, which released in October 2014, have topped ""over 900,000 units"" and that the game was ""definitely a good start for the new IP"".   FIFA 15 (4.0 Metacritic user score):   But the number two spot in the fall race was captured by EA’s FIFA 15, which VGChartz currently has pegged at 14.3 million copies sold globally. It’s far and away the best-selling sports game of the season.    Battlefield: Hardline (3.6 Metacritic user score):   The retail version of Battlefield Hardline debuted at No. 1 in the UK software sales chart in its first launch week. It also became the best-selling title in the UK in 2015 as of March 23, 2015. According to NPD Group, the game was the best-selling game in March in the United States.   So that's a no then.

Origin has patched this and now it's impossible to do anymore.   Lords of the Fallen was never cracked.  This game will not be cracked.

The Rarbg movie encodes are not all brilliant and I find them to be a little inconsistent. PublicHD was fantastic. It came back after mysteriously disappearing for a while without all the old content and imo was not that great. It's recently changed to PrivateHD and looks pretty promising but not much on there at present. The best compressed 1080's out there are probably the Grym rips on TPB. All the top movies with extras and subs if they're on the original and all 14,000 kbps +. You'll need plenty of storage space but the quality is awesome. I also use torrentbutler which seems to be a fancy front end over movies and tv shows on KAT. Nice interface and easy to browse through what's available. Yify releases are essentially crap but they have just about any movie you can think of, a shitload of seeders and are good for use on smaller or mobile devices or even streaming through an appropriate client. I wouldn't personally archive them but not everyone cares about lower bitrates or uses large screens and home cinema amps and I guess the number of seeders for Yify stuff proves that..."

Piracy,3at7ih,CatapultJohnson,1 point,Tue Jun 23 10:10:36 2015 UTC,Yes you can. You can interrupt the download and later when you want to resume just order the same package and it will resume.

Piracy,3at7ih,CatapultJohnson,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:17:37 2015 UTC,"Interesting point! I think it would be a good idea to use a VPN, although I've personally never heard of anyone getting into trouble when downloading from IRC. I'll add this to the tutorial.  Basically, you're downloading from a bot, not from other users, so there is no one that could log your downloads except that bot (honeypot or the administrator of a hacked server, which are often used as bots, could log and report you). Maybe it is possible to track your file requests on the channel?"
Piracy,3at7ih,z0mz0m,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:47:20 2015 UTC,"Wow I remember doing this all the damn time back in the day.   The problem with it was that the bots would often false advertise their files, towards the end of it all it was pretty hard to find a quality file, there were more asshats tricking you into garbage then there was people with legit files. Maybe now that all the trolls have moved on the quality of things are back to when it was in his heyday.    When torrents came out, the nicest thing about em was that you could read comments about that particular file, and you could see how many people were actively downloading that said file. Made things much easier to see what movie had the best quality or if the software you were downloading was actually legit without any nasty viruses or bugs embedded into em."
Piracy,3at7ih,buildsrc,0,Wed Jun 24 02:10:35 2015 UTC,"You should put up a big red sign telling people to donate to those channels. Those bots aren't hosting themselves for free you know. I'm afraid that if leechers from torrent trackers start to switch over to xdcc downloading and get a hang of it, it will pretty soon die. The only hope is that it proves too difficult for them to master it with all the custom commands, queues etc."

I gave it a thorough google beforehand and it seemed to be the best around. It is paid, but like $5/mo, changing with monthly/yearly deal etc. My only qualm is that it seems like the best VPN but it's yet to really prove itself in a major case, and I generally stay away from the most popular service for anonymity, so it feels weird to go for this one. If it means anything, Anonymous advertised Ghost VPN (which is free) on their main site, but I ain't checked that or owt, tend to stay away from free shit when it comes to privacy, wishing and researching if a paywall makes a difference."

Honestly, I thought I was just too set in my ways to change from torrents to something easier. That may still be true, maybe I'm looking for excuses. But seeing this article makes me think that maybe the reason I prefer BitTorrent is because, being p2p, it's harder to take down and more decentralized.

Since you're not sharing what you're watching, you're not creating other copies. The only one creating copies is the uploader offering it to you. (there are a couple reasons this is true), however that looks to be possibly changing if the American courts and content industry have any say in it (and clearly they do). Additionally, since streaming sites have the content sourced directly at the site it creates a very convenient choke point for takedowns, this is something BitTorrent does not suffer from nearly as much due to the p2p nature of it, it's easier to find things other than the most recent TV episodes or popular movies.

If I torrent it, is that an infringement? You'd probably say yes. What if I did the Comedy Central BattleBots shows from 2000-2002? Still an infringement? You'd also probably say 'yes'. Except no, the latter wouldn't. I have had a license for those shows for many years (I worked as one of their safety/tech guys, as well as their UK contact), heck I've even got a set of pre-broadcast tapes. They don't know about my license though, not without asking me or BattleBots. Does my license cover tonights show? Again, how do they know?  This is the issue. This is why the only person that can make a copyright claim is a representative of the rights holder, who (in theory) knows if the particular use is infringing or not, or even if it's an issue they want to start.   ISPs don't do infringement investigations. They have no ability to even start doing so, so they don't. Copyright is a civil matter based on contract. You don't know what's infringing or not if you have no idea what the contract terms are and who are party to them.  In fact this was one of the key points in the YouTube v Viacom case. Youtube couldn't go taking down random videos because it was Daily Show, because Viacom (or Comedy Central) uploaded a number of them. In fact, muddying it most of all was that Viacom couldn't tell which videos were properly licensed, so how could YouTube? Take that, apply it to bittorrent, you've got why ISP's don't do investigations."

I've tried and failed to download tons of things because there was no longer seeds etc. and I've never once went out and bought it. If it isn't available then it isn't available. I just move on. If a movie is out in the cinema and I can't stream or download it I either wait for it to come on television or don't watch it. Maybe I just don't care about content that much but they are not losing any revenue from me and others like me?
Piracy,3aewr8,aleuts,3,Sat Jun 20 09:14:27 2015 UTC,"Here's two things they would say: (1) The fact that you downloaded it indicates that you place a non-zero value on it. Therefore it's simply a pricing problem. (2) It's their right to decide how much they want to charge for it, not yours to decide how much you're willing to pay before taking it on your own.  The reason it is said that unauthorised file-sharing constitutes stealing is because they are using a colloquial definition of stealing as enjoying someone else's property without the legal right to do so. This is a bit of semantics, but it's clear that copyright infringement is stealing by this colloquial definition. This doesn't mean it is morally wrong, though -It also doesn't mean that it is stealing according to criminal law, for that matter- and that is an important distinction. It could be that copyright law is overbroad, and therefore the law classifies certain things as infringement which it really shouldn't.  In point of fact, there has never been an empirical study demonstrating that copyright needs to be strengthened to promote its purposes. Regardless, copyright has consistently been strengthened over the years, leading to longer terms, broader scope of subject matter, and more rights for the copyright holder. This is the result of special interest lobbying, not informed policy debate. Some studies have even shown that copyright infringement is positively correlated with money going to artists. There are multiple plausible mechanisms for this effect, including the so-called sampling effect, and including that file-sharing constitutes free advertising."

It was therefore considered stealing for Scots to marry in secret (stealing from the Lord no less). There can be no room for argument here. Theft is whatever the law says it is. Was it immoral for William Wallace to marry in secret, and thereby steal from his English Lord? I would say no. Stealing does not imply immorality. To the contrary, it is quite clear that it is the law of Prima Noctis itself that is immoral, not the act which is considered theft according to Prima Noctis.  What about copyright law, then? Is it immoral to take part in culture without first paying an entry fee? What if you don't have any money, and it costs literally nothing to anyone for you to take part? What if there is no way for you to take part in culture without pirating the material?

Piracy,3aduhr,Henaree,5,Fri Jun 19 11:41:33 2015 UTC,Wouldn't stop it. It'd just make the next way to do it even harder to track down
Piracy,3aduhr,nerfAvari,6,Fri Jun 19 12:35:25 2015 UTC,"I think you're only seeing the small picture and immediate effects.  No, it wouldn't stop the piracy, and yes, people would flock to few other hubs of pirate activity if the block was done right.  But consider it from a perspective of governmental agency that has to do two things - monitor your internet activity, and gather blackmail info on you.  In free internet, there are hundreds if not thousands of sites where you can illegally download shit from. Obviously, you can't monitor and bug all of them. But if you start blocking them one by one, people will flock to others, and - most importantly - tell others the places to go to get their share of pirated content. In the end you'll end with entire UK digital pirate community in a handful of places that may even provide anonymous and private access to files, but have the biggest and most overlooked and underestimated flaw - they are consolidated. That means instead of bugging hundreds of sites, you can focus resources and manpower on infiltrating a dozen. Don't be naive, there's no privacy on the internet, just different shades of infiltration.  In conclusion, blocking sites won't diminish piracy, but it will give government the tools, resources and places to gather previously mentioned for further surveillance."
Piracy,3aduhr,ginx2666,-1,Fri Jun 19 11:28:31 2015 UTC,"Or, your citizens flock to VPNs of less oppressive countries and continue browsing and pirating as normal, without monitoring."
Piracy,3aduhr,HyperbolicTroll,0,Fri Jun 19 12:15:27 2015 UTC,"What, do you really think VPNs - especially paid ones - are safe? Anonymous? Are you nuts?  You connect to a service that encrypts your internet traffic, but not the fact that you connect to it. That alone gets you on the radar, as a potential criminal. Now, before I get flooded with hate comments - it doesn't mean you are a criminal, just that the government thinks you are, and that's more often than not enough for them to focus their attention on you.  And it wouldn't be that difficult to bug one suspicious person, or even a handful of people, convict them, set an example, and frighten enough people into submission to make it worthwhile. How would they know who to observe? Well, if I were to pick a target, I wouldn't just plant a honeypot, wait for IPs to flood in, and pick several.  Instead, I'd go and blackmail an ISP (any government can do that - slap a gag order on the case, and you can effectively spit Justice in face) to show me their clients with the highest traffic, pick the easiest targets, and monitor just them (and I don't mean just on the internet - I'd go through their credit card's history if needed, to see if they're paying for seedboxes, VPN, new HDDs, anything that works against them). If they happen to be pirating content, great - I have prey.  What if the person with the highest traffic uses VPN? First I'd try to find out if I can go after VPN provider. If I couldn't, then I'd go after companies that handle their finances, like Mastercard or Paypal (it worked against Megaupload and WikiLeaks). If they happen to use buttcoin or be totally free, then we have a problem. In case of the latter, I'd wait until it gets too expensive for them to operate (if users flock because it's good and free, it's bound to happen) and either watch them disappear, or shift to subscription model, in which case I'd do the previous thing. If it was buttcoin all the way in, then... I have no idea. I hesitate to even speculate, because it's not my field of work, but I cannot accept that biggest governments would allow the existence of untraceable, anonymous currency, if they hadn't a way to either destabilize, influence, shut down, take over or monitor it."

(far more expensive than netflix, but offers less content)  No one watches HBO for the movies and other random content, but of which is not available on anything outside of the broadcast channel, and $15 a month is just too much to watch probably 1 or 2 shows of which have very short seasons.  I have HBO included as part of my cable service, but one thing that I have noticed is that the streaming quality is massively sub par to the broadcast quality, and is also less than the quality of the torrents. Overall for best quality you are stuck either watching live, or DVR the content at the highest quality card that your media center PC will allow."

Assuming nobody revolt in the mean time, or try to shoot them... In any case, concentrating powers in one hand makes governing easier. It makes it also makes it dramatically easy for things to go wrong, if the leader is not so benevolent after all. Or even if he is, but his moral compass is somewhat off.

I think 9.2? Any way you can install cfw without it but you need the 3ds to be on a older firmware something like 4.5 , or use ninjahax exploit to install pasta cfw which you also need to be on firmware 9.2 . Your only other option is sky3ds which is a card like gateway but it does not use any cfw. It basically emulate the game card so the good thing about that is that it should work on any version as long as nintindo does not patch it.Users been reported being banned from online for 2 weeks with the sky 3ds because of public headers so if you go the sky3ds way get your own private headers for your games.

Piracy,39t25t,stefantalpalaru,12,Sun Jun 14 21:35:58 2015 UTC,The simple fact is that because it is a WEBRip and not broadcast TV there is only a small number of groups that will race those releases. Plus scene topsites will typically ban WEBRip as a source and those topsites will not race the releases either. The groups that do release it are not as large and cannot provide the kind of manpower necessary to get it done as fast. I agree that it takes forever but it is available now in SD quality.

Piracy,39t25t,Amosqu,1 point,Mon Jun 15 18:56:25 2015 UTC,"Why not?  When you transcode, you're not really doing it ""from"" something. It's decompressed into images (24 per second), which are then encoded into the target codec.  The quality of the images is important (if they're low quality it will turn out poorly), but that has more to do with bitrate of the original codec than it does with the identity of the codec.  The result isn't what you'd call impressive, but doesn't seem to be any worse than what I was getting from h264->h264."

OTA/cable shows are broadcast in a generic format at a predetermined time to everyone, so much of the recording process can be automated. An on-demand web service like Netflix can (intentionally) choose to have no public API and use secret data formats that aren't decoded until just before it's sent to the screen, which creates a need for manual steps and unusual recording setups. Any automation you manage to get set up might be broken at any time by an unexpected change to the video player.  Web rips would be easier than TV (as you're imagining) for something like free videos on Youtube, which does have an API and currently doesn't really attempt to deter you from capturing the generic video data while it's being sent from the server to the video player.   only half of the episodes are out in 720p   The last one downloaded 18 hours ago for me, so some of the delay is also due to your media source."

The exist nodes are where the encrypted traffic from within the Tor network goes back onto the largely unencrypted Internet. There is no need to break any encryption as the exit node is the one that is supposed to receive the messages in the first place. If somebody controls the exist nodes they have access to all the browsing you do over Tor and that's not just theoretical, people have used that in the past to steal peoples passwords, emails and stuff, as that goes all over the exist nodes unencrypted. The exist node is essentially your ISP and all traffic goes over them.  Now there are of course some complications, if you use HTTPS, the exist node can't look into your traffic. And the exit node also doesn't know who is requesting a webpage, it's anonymous. However a lot of traffic doesn't use HTTPS and a lot of the anonymity can be cracked, either just via statistics or browser finger printing.

First get PowerISO (There is an official windows alternative but I've had it cause a few BSOD's on me in the past), once you've got that installed and sorted, go to Tools and press Create Bootable USB Device.  From there select your ISO (In this case I'd go for Windows 7,as I was trying to run Win8 on a pretty shoddy laptop and it was just giving me grief)  Once you've selected your ISO make sure you select the right USB Device and press OK. If all has gone well so far once that is done plug it into your Laptop and go to the Boot Menu (Varies between F8 or F12, sometimes it'll say on the screen ""Press ## for boot menu"") and select your USB Device if all has gone according to plan then your USB should load up as if it's booting like a disk.

Piracy,39qbua,spiroth10,4,Sat Jun 13 18:46:03 2015 UTC,"Its the same with DVD rips, a 4-8gb DVD movie can be encoded down to ~1gb because the old media (DVD or BluRay) is using a very high bitrate (more than needed) with an old (but well tested) format.   Years earlier there was a format called ""KVCD"" that allowed for close to DVD quality on (non-standard) Video-CDs (800mb size). The trick to keeping such high quality with low file sizes was a custom quantization matrix. I don't fully understand well enough to explain myself but perhaps the wikipedia article about Quantization will help you better understand whats going on."
Piracy,39qbua,evilgold,2,Sat Jun 13 20:24:19 2015 UTC,"Changing the quantization matrix can help encoding a particular frame, but good luck optimizing it for a whole movie... Current quantizations matrix are shaped after what the human eye notices the most in a picture (in terms of frequency), so maybe you could change it depending on the softness of the picture in your movie,(i.e. you want to preserve the grain of the movie), but it's a compromise and you would need to lose information in other aspects of the picture. So nothing magical here, unfortunately. Also, VCD had lower picture resolution (equivalent to VHS), and with SVCD you had to have at least two CDs to encode the movie, so 1.4GB instead of 4.7 or 8, also you could clearly see the increased compression."
Piracy,39qbua,try_an0ther,1 point,Sat Jun 13 22:21:59 2015 UTC,"KVCD was still mpeg2 as it wanted to maintain compatibility with a VCD-capable DVD-player.

I personally never download tiny sized movies specifically for that reason. You can have a video that is technically 1080 by 1920 but if you compress the image to be small enough, you might as well lower the resolution because the blockiness will be so bad that you just see a bunch of jpeg in the video."
Piracy,39qbua,try_an0ther,2,Sun Jun 14 05:31:26 2015 UTC,"That's because H.264 is very efficient and the bitrate used on blurays is a bit overkill, but as they have 25 or 50GB of space on a disc, they might as well use it anyway to increase the quality. Theoretically, they could have kept DVDs for the medium and just use H.264 to have good enough looking movies at 1080p fitting in 8.4GB. Just as you could fit 4K movies on a standard bluray with H.265 but they want to release bigger discs anyway..."
Piracy,39qbua,NoMoreNicksLeft,2,Sat Jun 13 22:16:47 2015 UTC,"It should be noted that even when all the relevant specs are equal (framerate, resolution, etc), some videos require fewer bits to faithfully represent.  Think about the difference between a live action video clip, and a Disney movie. With the former, every single pixel is a slightly different color, but with the latter you have large swaths of pixels all the exact same color, backgrounds that are perfectly still, etc.  Of course, there's no reason not to use the full space of the bluray even on the latter."
Piracy,39qbua,shthed,1 point,Sat Jun 13 23:57:38 2015 UTC,"so, ultimately the 20k bitrate is unneccessary, and videos are actually running at lower bits per second, but the capability to stream that much is left enabled, so it takes up more space?  because Ive tried 10,000Kb/s vids that look almost exactly the same as their 3500-6500K variable cousins, and they look the same, with 6-9 GB less storage space taken up"

Well, who knows, maybe he does actually know something, but if so he chooses to hide it to perpetuate myths and help his site (and promote PIA)   How? You basically never get copyright notices and even when they do get taken down it's definitely safer.    Uh huh. Remind me again how that compares to more people having going to prison for involvement in 'private' trackers, than have been fined in civil court for using public/open trackers.  Also, most torrent users don't get notices. only a small subset do, but the perception is that there's more, enhanced by people going 'yeah, you're going to get notices, get on our private tracker'   Almost all good trackers don't. They simply close down donations when they have enough to pay for hosting and other expenses.   uh huh, 'almost all good trackers', meaning some you consider good and many you don't consider good don't. proves my point there. In addition, it's amazing what can be considered 'expenses', 'moderating' could be itemised as an expense. And even if not, you know these are the costs and expenses how? because they said so? So trusting...   And who might that be? People who profit? I'm pretty sure the only one who fits under this is IPT.   Perhaps you should leave the bubble and start participating in policy discussions with major players in this field. Talk to them, discuss things with them, argue with them. Despite what you think, these sites aren't as 'private' as you'd think. People are well aware of them. I'd have thought the lesson of EliteTorrents would have sunk in by now.  Congressmen/MP's and similar don't care that the 'good' ones 'mostly' don't make a profit. Especially not when lobbyists are claiming otherwise, and showing the examples that do to prove it. I mean, you do understand how western politics works right? Or do you not care as long as you can get what you want, and sod anyone else.   There is, it's just within the tracker. Remember the IPT/BTN/PTP truce?   I don't talk of petty squabbles between kids. I'll give you a nice big old one. 5 years ago, most sites banned utorrent 2.x for 'being unfair'. These days its 'the reccomended version'. The client hasn't changed, only it's suddenly not 'unfair' any more. I can only assume someone with more patience than me sat these 'experts' down and pointed out how little they knew.  I remember 5-6 years ago, it was 1.6.1 that was the 'preferred' ones. Why? ""because the ones after that are made by bittorrent inc., the spy on you and communicate it to the MPAA' (example - http://www.shroomery.org/forums/showflat.php/Number/7506675). I was told by one site (don't remember who, that was 5-6 years and 2 hdd's ago) that they had evidence but 'it is too secret to share, would compromise our security, just trust us'. Funny thing, I know for a fact they started working on it from 1.6.0 and 1.6.1 was a bit after the buy went through.    We're not actually brainwashed lol.   To say that after saying what you said... really?"

Piracy,39myxe,Stryke_RG,1 point,Sat Jun 13 21:06:34 2015 UTC,"I addressed most of your points already, including your cherrypicking of specific sites, a distinction that only matters to those already in those sites.    And sites like KAT don't? Most sites that profit off of their donations are looked down upon in the private tracker community (see iPT and BitSoup).   There's a bit of a difference, both politically, and legally, between direct (from the users) and indirect financing (from a 3rd party). in some respects its the same, but in others the difference is between 'paying for an ad view that was on a site' and 'paying to continue using a service'.   This is actually false. It's mostly site users who perpetuate this partially true fact. Although no site is secure, you are statistically more likely to get a DMCA letter on a public tracker than a well curated private one.   You cherry pick a very narrow aspect - mostly ineffective DMCA letters. I notice you gloss over the difference in data logging and retention (and access) between a public and private site for instance. Do you have ANY idea how much work it was to get uploader IP from TPB for one account (sharkMP4)? a lot. Like it took over a week, as it's designed to be incredibly hard to access at all. The only data stored is what's shown on the site, with two additions - upload IP and account email address. A private site has that and SO much more, uploads, downloads, data transfer on all torrents, IP's they've logged in with etc. And even the basic data is available at the drop of a hat, to a group of people, which may include other sites. That's not really 'secure' is it? Were I to work for the prosecution (rather than the defense) in bittorrent lawsuits, with the information from a private tracker, I could pretty much shut down any defense argument. Best hope no admin gets an 'offer they can't refuse'.   Viruses are almost non-existant and for the most part, uploaders know what they're doing   Even the *AA's have started to give up claiming that public sites give virii, because its a risk that just didn't happen much, and for the most part, public uploaders know what they're doing as well. Many public sites, including KAT and TPB, are well curated too.   Really? Sites who try to keep a lower profile are more damaging than sites like KAT, TPB and RARBG?   It's not so much a 'lower profile' and 'intent and method'. Sure TPB is the 400lb gorilla, but more have heard of WCD than of RARBG (although funnily enough, I'm in the middle of research on some rarbg stuff) And you think there's a difference to most people between WCD and empornium, or iPT? No."

It didn't, unsurprisingly.  8 years ago, it was claimed that utorrent was sending back information to the MPAA and telling them what you were doing. Not even close.  And almost 10 years ago, it was accused of working with the anti-p2p company retspan.  They weren't.  What do they all have in common? They were all spread on the thinnest of evidence (if there ever was any) because people who didn't know what they were doing went and jumped to conclusions, and spread it amongst their friends. Who spread it because they're 'influential people', despite it never getting checked by anyone who knew what they were doing.

When I get caught these days, I won't get notices, instead when I reboot my modem, my ISP hijacks the DNS lookup which takes me to one of their websites where it gives me the notice and a phone number to call to get my internet turned back on. (really fucking annoying)   PIA is cheap considering the hassle of calling and listening to my ISPs self righteous BS about torrenting being stealing, and other nonsense. Pay, install, set up the VPN client and make sure that your ext. IP is not the same as your ISP IP and you are good to go. When setting up your VPN client, go into advanced settings and check the boxes for DNS leak protection and kill switch which will stop all internet connections if you suddenly disconnect from the PIA server."

I argue that it's a nicer experience than a paper book, because you can jam it in your messenger bag without worrying about dog-earing pages and messing up the spine. It's really light, and the front-lit display means you can read in a pitch-dark room without fatiguing your eyes.    ""Spacious"" isn't really an issue; I think the Paperwhite has 4GB of storage? Since ebooks are only a couple hundred KB each, you can literally keep hundreds of books on it.    If you use Calibre to manage your books, it doesn't really matter which format you get them in; it's better to go for retail .mobi files (that's the Kindle's ebook format), but if you can only find an epub, Calibre does a satisfying job of converting it to .mobi for the Kindle. I've only encountered a couple of books where weird text formatting was an issue.    Anyway, yeah, I recommend going the pirated-ebook route, especially if you're already comfortable with pirated music and movies. It's just as easy, and the experience is arguably nicer nonetheless."
Piracy,39hoy2,sanityvampire,5,Thu Jun 11 21:13:09 2015 UTC,"Get a kindle paperwhite, side load all books into the documents folder. Kindle prefers mobi format although it also takes pdf (but pdf does not look good, too small for the screen and you can't adjust the text size for scanned documents)   Download calibre for your ebook management, it's spectacular. It converts, it organizes, it slices it dices look at that tomato!  As far as equivalence goes , I personally find paper books to be better due to annoyances in format issues for pirated books, particularly if you need to convert them. Calibre has the options to format however you want, however most pirates will find that unwieldy to do so. Still, I still download all my ebooks because the benefits outweigh the negatives."

Piracy,39g4oe,ktetch,2,Thu Jun 11 18:11:43 2015 UTC,"odds are, nothing.  There's a significant cap on damages in Canada, that makes it cost ineffective (iirc it's $5k - one case here in GA I'm involved in has racked up more than that in expert witness fees to me alone, which the prosecutors will probably have to pay)  BUT, if they want to go ahead, they'll have to file a Doe lawsuit (I believe the process is more similar to US than the UK - I know both well, I'm not so sure on Canada), where you'll get a chance to object (do t through counsel, else you give them the details they're after) . Then they may try another settlement offer, but may not due tot he overview of the court. In that case, they'll refile/modify a suit naming you, and then they have to prove YOU infringed (not your connection, not your computer, but you, personally, hence the bullshit 'don't delete anything' request)   It's incredibly hard for them to win these suits, as long as you have competent counsel, and don't do anything stupid. I don't know what the lawyer situation is in Canada, but there may be some that will take it contingency/pro bono. And it will take some time (at least a year, perhaps two, maybe longer - the one here in Ga I'm involved in has been over 2 years since they dropped the copyright claim, and it's just on the frivolity of the lawsuit in the first place, and we've still got no idea how much longer it'll be)"

I am happy to pay for services like netflix and amazon, I'd pay 5-8 dollars to go see a movie in the theater, but I'm not going to pay 5$ to rent a movie online, especially when I'm tied to watching it on only certain devices, and I'm sure as hell not going to pay 15$ to go to the movie theater where I am then forced to watch 5-10 minutes of actual commercials before another 20-30 minutes of trailers; I wouldn't pay 8$ to go to the theater if I have to deal with that, I'm especially not paying twice that. I stopped using redbox/renting dvds quite a few years ago as well after some drm started preventing a lot of newer dvds from even playing on my laptop anymore."

Piracy,395oww,Naitra,3,Wed Jun 10 00:10:41 2015 UTC,"I like it because you don't have to worry about ratios or seeding.    Basically, you sign up for a server (i use tweaknews).  There are different plans depending on the speed you want and bandwidth you want.  No matter who you pick, research their DMCA response.  I picked tweaknews because they take a long time to respond to take down requests (if at all)  Then you need to find an .nzb provider (much like a .torrent provider).  Some are free, others are paid but it's cheap.  I use NZB.ag.  Other choices are Nmatrix and Binsearch  Finally you need a newsgroup app, like Newsbin Pro.  Some are free, some are paid.  I've been using newsbin pro for 8 years now so I'm not sure what other options are out there  Then all you do is go to your nzb site, find something you want, grab the .nzb and load it into your app and you're done.

Piracy,399b6v,NoMoreNicksLeft,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:12:21 2015 UTC,"Yes, 160 kbps is deprecated quality. The average human is unable to detect certain sounds past 192 kbps, and for the average person 192 Kbps+ provides allows you to get the most out of your gear.   160<192, which leads me to believe that the free streaming of spotify files loses some percetible sounds due to lossy reencoding from the MP3 320 Kbps to the 160 Kbps you mentioned. Not only that, but I assume rather than transcoding lossless to MP3 320 and 160 kbps, they transcode to MP3 320 and from that to 160 Kbps which leads to more deprecated sound quality."

In other countries, priacy is really high because people have no good legal way to access the content, even in other countries where netflix is available legally, they tend to charge more, and offer less content. For example, look at netflix Australia, lower quality, more expensive, and a fraction of the content that you get in the US. No one is going to pay for the service just to watch 1 or 2 shows, thus there is far less value. furthermore, with the crappy ISP's and horrible bandwidth caps, it is far more convenient to download the show, and then stream it to multiple devices in the home so that everyone has a chance to watch, rather than each person taking turns streaming (which is unsustainable for all but the most expensive business plans)  Overall, this is simply a case where for much of the world, the pirates are offering abetter experience that allows users to view the content the way they want."

Piracy,3976i5,Thatfracture,1 point,Tue Jun 9 20:42:49 2015 UTC,You could always try using the socks5 proxy PIA provides. That way the connection will be forced through the VPN server via Qbittorrent. You can do this on the connection tab in Qb settings. You'll have to log into your client page on the PIA website and generate a username and password for socks5. There also a quick guide on their client setup page.
Piracy,3976i5,Thatfracture,2,Wed Jun 10 11:16:01 2015 UTC,So basically I generate a username and password and enter that into my qbittorrent settings?

Obviously it's utorrent but you can get the idea of what to enter in the fields as qbittorrent is similar.  http://www.lifehacker.com.au/2013/08/how-to-completely-anonymize-your-bittorrent-traffic-with-a-proxy/  Edit: You can run the client and socks5 at the same time with no problems but mostly I just use the socks5 to stop the pirate snoops watching and surf on my regular internet without vpn.

Let's give MS some credit here, they're dumb but they're not pants-on-head retarded.  I think the goal here for Microsoft is to get everybody into their eco system. Apple's done really well with the App store and Microsoft wants to get in on that. Obviously, 7 doesn't have an appstore but it's still a very popular OS.

If you want to prove me wrong just collect a team and make a game with no cheating, no bugs, no ports, no delays, no lies and top-notch graphical quality on a non-existing budget with no sales at release.  What you were greeted with is bad, sure; but don't support the developers that does it this way then. Support the ones who does a good job; support the games you like to play. What games DID you buy anyway?  The industry won't ""fix itself"" by you stealing their property; you fix it by steering profits from the ""buggy ports"" to the solid games and developers. When a well-made indie game nets more profit than a AAA release, that's when the industry changes direction.  And seriously, how can you complain about cheating in multiplayer? There's no way to stop cheating completely - none at all. You can stop it for a little time, but not for very long since people build new cheats to use very quickly anyway. It's not the developers fault that people cheat, it's consumers who choose to cheat after all.

Hmm, no. that's not true.   Dowling v United States would disagree with you, as would the Supreme Court involved.   Since the statutorily defined property rights of a copyright holder have a character distinct from the possessory interest of the owner of simple ""goods, wares, [or] merchandise,"" interference with copyright does not easily equate with theft, conversion, or fraud. The infringer of a copyright does not assume physical control over the copyright nor wholly deprive its owner of its use. Infringement implicates a more complex set of property interests than does run-of-the-mill theft, conversion, or fraud.  Essentially, by copying something without authorization, you're breaking copyright law. But breaking copyright law is not theft, because stealing someone's copyright makes no sense. You can't steal their right to make copies, it's still their right even if you've broken it. And, since they still possess the original copy, nothing has been stolen. Thanks for playing though."
Piracy,390vbn,Philthy_McNasty,-2,Mon Jun 8 22:49:16 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, I guess it's more of a moral theft than a legal theft. You're copying intellectual property, and reducing the value of spent hours on said property - but you aren't stealing a material asset.   It can (very lightly)be compared to employing someone for a job and not paying them for it, as no material asset was lost it's not theft.  The law is incredibly outdated, and for the developers sake it should be changed as their products nowadays aren't physical assets, but digital and therefore cannot be stolen in most cases - which doesn't make sense. Then again, I like pirating before buying to see if the item is what's promised so for my sake it should stay the same.  It's a hard nut to crack, but thanks for correcting me. Have an upvote."
Piracy,390vbn,Schmidtzy,2,Mon Jun 8 23:41:24 2015 UTC,"Your first point is valid, and one that I agree with but you're putting it in a way that's difficult to sympathize with.  Cheating in multiplayer - that is definitely something developers can at least curtail.  Finally, pirating is not stealing. Copying something doesn't take it from someone else, it just duplicates it. What I think you are trying to say is that people who don't pay for a game are reducing the potential revenue stream for the developers. However you need to take into account that not all pirates were potential sources of income in the first place."
Piracy,390vbn,Amosqu,2,Tue Jun 9 02:16:11 2015 UTC,"I got a little angry with the OP as every developer suffers from his actions, not just the ones who behave badly, and therefore my post was a bit like acid. Sorry about that.  Sure, developers can and should do whatever they can to prevent cheating, but it'll never go away completely - it'll only become harder and make less people do it, but it'll still be there as long as we have access to our own hardware is what I'm trying to say.   The way I see it with the ""piracy isn't theft"" is that it's still theft, even if the law is outdated. You're taking someones spent time and not contributing to it, therefore lessening the value of said time. Sure, OP might've never bought the game - but does he then have any reason at all to pirate it? If he's interested in it, he's a potential customer. If he pirates it to play it, he's a potential customer. He removes himself as a potential customer but still getting access to the product that took time, money and effort to produce - morally this is theft; doesn't really matter that it's not a physical copy of the game, what matters is that OP is getting access to something without paying for it when it has a pricetag.  You're buying a license to use a product, and by pirating you're bypassing the license needed. In Sweden everyone is paying for the pirates actions. We pay an extra fee for every GB on a HDD when we buy the hardware, because it's easier than battling the pirates, but making everyone suffer instead by having higher hardware prices. This fee is on every storage media there is; tapes, USB sticks, HDDs, CDs, TVs with storage etc.   Now don't get me wrong; with the current state of the industry piracy is a great tool, but it's not one to use for everything. I like to pirate most items before I buy them as I do not trust advertisements of said items and want to see for myself if what I'm buying really is what it said it was going to be and if it runs well on my setup - but if it does, and if I actually want the product after 30minutes of trying I'll still pay for it as the developer had done a good job and deserves to get paid for his/her work.   The law is terribly outdated for a digital age, and we can be sure it'll change eventually to incorporate digital assets too as lots of games no longer even become physical assets at all, they're purely digital. It's cheaper and leaves more money for the developer to spend on the game after all, which is good."

If I pirate a game, it's because I'm unsure if I will enjoy it (new genre, dev, franchise) or it's difficult/overpriced (rare retro games). What you're saying is you could afford to buy then, fully intend on playing them (apparently even if they are broken or buggy), but instead choose not to pay the developers for their work. You're right; piracy isn't necessarily theft. But in your case I think it is. If you don't agree with something about a game, then just don't buy it or play it... why would you even spend the time to pirate a game you think is going to be buggy or broken in the first place?"

Piracy,390vbn,ginger_beer_m,9,Mon Jun 8 15:46:27 2015 UTC,"No  it's copyright infringement. It's not stealing unless someone else is deprived of the work through his actions directly. As in because he downloades gta5, someone else is unable to find a copy of gta5. The law, and reality, are pretty cut and dry on this.   The only thing being deprived is a right to profit, which isn't actually a thing, though the content industry would have you believe otherwise. Right to copy, sure, right to distribute, definitely. But no right to profit exists. If they can't profit due to people downloading for free then they're doing it wrong and need to change to be competitive."

Piracy,390vbn,passwordisshared,5,Mon Jun 8 16:21:06 2015 UTC,"I'm half kidding in that you obviously can't prove that he would have bought it, no one can. That's the point. Saying ""well he likely would have because games cost money"" still doesn't mean anything.   I mean that whole line of reasoning basically makes it theft for anyone that has not bought someone's product. Which is obviously ridiculous. No one would say someone borrowing a game/book/cd or listening to the radio/concert etc., etc. Is any kind of theft. Yet it is the same exact thing. Someone is sharing something with you. Not really your problem or responsibility to control how someone else's product is distributed. Why would you do that?"
Piracy,390vbn,Nhialor,6,Mon Jun 8 17:11:05 2015 UTC,"Agree. This is the sort of reasoning that allows the MPAA to sue grandma, babies and dead people for million of dollars ... based on the premise of money they'd have earned on some hypothetical lost sales."
Piracy,390vbn,passwordisshared,6,Mon Jun 8 17:29:01 2015 UTC,"So if I boycott EA because they can eat a giant fucking dick for their Army Men shovelware (seriously, fuck those guys!) then I'm stealing?

Piracy,390vbn,Nhialor,-2,Mon Jun 8 16:43:25 2015 UTC,"Come on now. I've pirated a number of games and have no problem doing it, but your argument is silly. In your example you didn't give them money and you didn't receive a product. With pirating they don't receive any money and you receive a product. Big difference."
Piracy,390vbn,Gene_P00le,4,Mon Jun 8 18:13:10 2015 UTC,"But that's not what you said. You said that the absence of buying the games he used to buy of all the proof you need.   Regardless, it is firmly entrenched in law that copying is not stealing or theft. It's copying without authorization. If you want to really get technical then the one who is offering up the pirated goods is the one who's committing the infringement, not necessarily OP, as they're the one offering the unauthorized copy.   The problem you and others run into is the concept that just because a business makes something, they're entitled to profit from it, which isn't the case. If someone sells bottled water from the local river and I bottle my own from the same river, I am not stealing from them by depriving them of profit. Additionally, if I set up a stand upstream them and give my water away to anyone coming by, I'm not stealing from them even though my actions deprive then of profit. The onus is on them, the business owner, to find a way to profit in a resource rich environment.   Likewise, software can be copied at zero cost infinitely. If they want to create a business model that competes with free, then good for them, I support them for doing so, but piracy is part of that environment, and something they need to adapt to, since it's a resource rich environment. Like the water bottler above, they're just giving the same thing away to others for free. And though that does infringe upon copyright law, that is all that is infringed upon, because depriving a business of profit is not a crime as far as I know, and it certainly doesn't meet the standard of theft, since the original copy never is removed from possession of the owner."

Maybe you can argue existing in a swarm isn't infringement. They have no proof the data sent contained infringing content unless they received it directly and can prove it was from you. Existing in a swarm with copy-written file names doesn't really prove this data truly is what it is.

OEM licenses are for one device for the lifetime of the device & die with the device.  That said, some people do get away with installing the license on another machine & calling MS for activation, etc.  I've never bothered going that route but could be worth exploring if you really want.  Daz's Windows Loader or Microsoft Toolkit work well enough for activating Windows 7 without messing with trying to move OEM Win 7 keys, IMO.  re: finding the key, see if your laptop still has a sticker.  Otherwise there's a few programs that can look up that info, e.g. NirSoft ProduKey & others."

However Daz Loader does not have support anymore (and neither does Windows 7), so if the activator would somehow be broken with an windows update there won't be a never version for it.

""You were already told on the other thread you made that you can use MS Toolkit for anything other than win 7 hp or ultimate, and it still is the answer""  MS toolkit is the exact equivalent of daz loader, it's just some guy who made some program, and when you say ""and it still is the answer"" you literally make zero sense, I think you're trying to say ms toolkit is the program I should use but that's not really an answer to my question it is just a different program that you are recommending, it is infact not still is the answer"
Piracy,391p07,Amosqu,6,Mon Jun 8 18:30:17 2015 UTC,"You clearly have no idea how they work. Once you find it out, you will also know why they might be flagged as viruses.   MS Toolkit and Daz Loader have a known source site, where their developers have kept support threads and explained to detail how the activation is achieved. You really should use an hour or so to learn more if you are so keen to activate your windows safely.  Let me just help you out a bit.  Microsoft has different distribution channels for their products: retail, OEM and Volume License. The VL is basically the thing which corporations or governmental institutes use. They can activate Windows for several PCs with the same key and pay subscription fee to Microsoft. The volume licensed products use a key management service to authenticate, and the keys are valid for 180 days.  Now the Microsoft Toolkit installs a KMS-emulator, which tells (lies) the Windows OS that the key validity check was successful. This doesn't trigger many anti-viruses. MS Toolkit only creates one directory which is easy to white list if necessary.  Windows 7 Home Premium and Ultimate were only sold as retail or OEM versions and therefore did not use key servers to authenticate them. So this obviously means MS Toolkit (or any KMS-emulator) won't activate them.   The Daz Loader injects a SLIC (System Licensed Internal Code) into the system before Windows boots and Windows then thinks it is genuine. To put this more simplified: Windows is tricked into believing it is running on an OEM computer with a license tied to the motherboard. Now this is of course pretty hardcore in the ""eyes"" of any anti-virus, injecting code and shit.   Hope this helps and you'll know little bit more what you are trying to do."

Really, any software that requires a crack could be compromised by malware and you should always do a cost benefit analysis before going ahead.

Batman skins taken down, look-a-like swords from animes taken down, anything resembling anything trademarked or copyrighted taken down. Then we start seeing Steam selling official Coke/Pepsi can DLC for $4.99 each because they worked out a deal with the companies.  This is content that people can make for free using the modding tools provided. People already have done that and made even better versions of Superfight! with all the missing cards from their ""official"" DLC but they've all since been taken down now and you have to wait for the official guys to update them.   This isn't a sandbox game anymore. It's buying access to a Premium Mod Shop."
Piracy,38ro9u,NekoiNemo,2,Sun Jun 7 00:07:53 2015 UTC,"You comparison is flawed from the very basic level. If someone uses illegally acquired assets (like scanned cards or ripped out models and sounds) - it's a copyright infringement and owner of those assets has all rights to issue DMCA takedown. That's what DMCA was created for (until people begin to abuse it). If someone were to implement mechanics of Superfight but make every single card by themselves with new unique text on it - no one would've DMCA'd it. And that's what mods supposed to be - new original content, not just using something someone else have made.  What this mod did was not just ""Batman skins"", it was more along the lines of recreating an entirety of Batman: Arkham Asylum in Skyrim, using exclusively assets stolen from the original game. And mod like that would've been DMCA'd by WB faster than you can say ""copyright infringement""."

TTS does NOT block any content, you can load any mod you like.  A better example would be if the ThePirateBay took down Game of Thrones, but offered a torrent for $5 dollars an episode. You don't have to pay that, you could still go to another torrent site, but there is now a legal option (and the illegal ones would be removed from one site).  That is the situation on Steam right now with TTS. Steam is the one removing the free versions, the Devs got permission to put up a paid version that would not get removed. There are still plenty of free ways to get the games."

But even then, the embedded/OCRed text doesn't necessarily preserve things like columns or fancy formatting. It definitely doesn't know which font it should be, or what size... and kerning is totally fucked.  These things are usually a mess.  I've recreated one from such a sloppy pdf, though much smaller (first issue of 2600, it's only like 10 pages). Even then, took me a week of goof-off time at work to finish it. 199 pages would just be impossible unless you could split the work up among 40 or 50 people...  I think this is what I hate most about the copyright dicks, you could actually throw up a website where people did collaborate on such things. Many hands, light work, yadda yadda yadda.  Anyway, I agree with you that 26 megs just isn't huge. It'd be one thing if it were an issue of a magazine and he wanted room for the other 850 issues... but he needs to delete one or two apps at most to make room for this.

First it was just common downloading (no seeding), then I found a private tracker. Didn't think anything  of it at the time but then I became obsessed with it needed to download everything (freeleech-enabled). I started   to act like a crack head, needed to have my fix of downloading torrents as they hit. Few months later, I met this   gorgeous Auto-DL. Such a fine plugin. I was in love, I found the key to my addiction and she wasn't going   anywhere anytime soon. I was fully hooked, nothing could make me want to leave her. She would download   torrents for me while I slept and even deleted the ones that had a ratio of 1 or higher. I was on cloud nine, nothing   could ruin that. One night while I was out, my friend had introduced me to this new drug. He called it seedbox,   thought he was stupid. Pft who the hell pays for some program thing to download and seed your stuff? I played it   off tried it a lil, didn't think nothing of it. But my curiosity, had the best of me. Noticed this new drug had Auto-DL,   I was like no way shes here to? Hence began my true addiction, the root of all evil and its name of seed.st. She   had everything, space (2TB HDD) cheap ($30 month). For once in my life I was happy, felt like I could settle   down. Had my filters set for Mrs Auto-DL, shed download stuff and Seedbox would seed my torrents while I slept.   My ratio boosted 10 fold in a month. I had no idea what to do with all the points? Title change, add upload creds to   my account?? Ive been 4 years strong with seedbox, we have been happy. Weve had some down time but no   more then a day at the most. Ive downloaded from her for the past 4 years without a notice from my ISP saying I   should stop doing that to her. I guess this is what people call the ""Golden Years"". I go outside more, I have my   RSS feeds downloading things that people need help seeding. I have grown to help others when they need help   boosting their ratio."

Piracy,38m313,Amosqu,1 point,Fri Jun 5 04:26:11 2015 UTC,Most likely they're throttling everyone or there could be an error in your connection settings in utorrent or your router isnt setup correctly.

Piracy,38m313,Amosqu,1 point,Fri Jun 5 21:56:20 2015 UTC,"For those kind of filesharing site, I typically use a cbox (vinaleech, but there are many out there, mostly viet) where you check a link first using the site's own checker, post it in the main cbox, then a bot usually generates a premium link for you available for a few hours. Downside is you'll have to skip a few ads first after clicking the generated link. Also, posting porn will get you banned."

Piracy,38lekg,Amosqu,1 point,Sun Jun 7 12:37:52 2015 UTC,From one mike to another I think you're gonna be ok.The notices say 'alleged' they have to prove it was you that downloaded those files not just your ip.Maybe it was because your wifi was unsecured *wink  And if they havent disconnected you by now you should be fine on that front.A vpn will still help since 'they' wont be able to see what you're torrenting.
Piracy,38lekg,ItsMikeMaine,0,Fri Jun 5 03:20:46 2015 UTC,wow. i saw a commercial for Optimum during the NBA playoff game last night. I looked them up. Their site is so bad I couldn't even figure out if they were available in my area.  But this right there tells me I should just walk away if they are going to harass customers like that.

Piracy,38hquu,Shady_Advice,3,Thu Jun 4 08:11:12 2015 UTC,Ok so I see Wii games are possible...
Piracy,38hquu,Audrion,2,Thu Jun 4 08:28:54 2015 UTC,Is the WiiU modded yet to play backup games?
Piracy,38hquu,ginger_beer_m,0,Thu Jun 4 08:53:34 2015 UTC,No.
Piracy,38hquu,mike_the_pirate,2,Thu Jun 4 08:57:12 2015 UTC,Okay so far they have hardware able to dump WiiU games and a backup hardware loader that is able to play them unfortunately the method requires kernel level exploit that is able to dump the key of the Blu-ray drive. The person who was able to do this sold the exploited WiiU hardware to the developers in China but didn't release the exploit to anyone only provided these hacked devices. The sad thing is without a kernel exploit we are all waiting. Then as soon as an exploit is released it starts a war between the hackers and Nintendo...
Piracy,38hquu,molotoviphone,-1,Thu Jun 4 13:21:57 2015 UTC,Haha war  Nintendo didn't even patch the original exploit on the wii with the new system
Piracy,38hquu,mike_the_pirate,1 point,Thu Jun 4 13:55:30 2015 UTC,Lol yeah well by making the WiiU able to run Wii games and the Wii kernel fully exploited it was like shipping a bucket with holes predrilled into it.  Are you able to play WiiU games? I believe Nintendo knows that shipping a console that is able to play the previous generation games helps with sales considerably. It looks like Nintendo is doing a decent job protecting WiiU games.
Piracy,38hquu,molotoviphone,1 point,Thu Jun 4 21:09:32 2015 UTC,I haven't gotten my hands on a wii u yet unfortunately. I'm just aware that the virtual wii original Wii us they sent out were exploitable by the same methods the old Wiis were
Piracy,38hquu,mike_the_pirate,1 point,Thu Jun 4 21:36:15 2015 UTC,Yeah I am in the same boat as you I haven't bought a WiiU yet either.
Piracy,38hquu,mike_the_pirate,1 point,Thu Jun 4 22:16:11 2015 UTC,The correct answer is yes it has been done but without a public exploit able to dump the Drive key we are waiting.
Piracy,38hquu,molotoviphone,2,Thu Jun 4 22:22:17 2015 UTC,You can home brew the wii virtual console same way as you did the old actual wii. But not wii u games

Piracy,38jmvn,WutUtalkingBoutWill,2,Thu Jun 4 17:40:21 2015 UTC,"There's only one way to do that and that is... buying a license.  Now if you're talking about making Windows think it is legit, there are tools for that and if you use them, you should stop updating Windows (or be very careful as to what is being updated) because the anti-piracy software will then find out your system isn't genuine."
Piracy,38jmvn,ComatoseSixty,1 point,Thu Jun 4 19:06:27 2015 UTC,"I actaully have a genuine windows 8.1 key here, but I have no clue how to install, i'm in the middle of downloading windows 8.1 pro onto a usb so I can boot from it, but I have no clue how to do that haha."
Piracy,38jmvn,ComatoseSixty,0,Thu Jun 4 19:18:20 2015 UTC,"You do have a working Windows system right now, right?   I suppose you're downloading an ISO file so, to burn it onto a usb stick, install Windows 7 CD/DVD Download Tool to do that (it's a very straightforward software) and you should end up with a working usb drive installation which you can use to setup Windows 8.1 on your PC."
Piracy,38jmvn,riverstyxxx,1 point,Thu Jun 4 19:57:40 2015 UTC,So I put the iso file on a USB and went into the bios and set the startup to boot from  USB but when I booted up the computer again it just started up like it normally would? Did I do something wrong?
