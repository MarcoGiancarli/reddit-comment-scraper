battlefield_4,3dyptj,DANNYonPC,42,Mon Jul 20 23:06:49 2015 UTC,You can't really slam the UCAV anymore after the changes. It's still one of my favorite gadgets but it's a huge pain to use now.
battlefield_4,3dyptj,DTFisMe,15,Mon Jul 20 17:15:36 2015 UTC,"It is the same randomly annoying gadget, just occurring less. IMO they handled that nerf poorly."
battlefield_4,3dyptj,fuckitbadnamederp,15,Mon Jul 20 17:27:30 2015 UTC,"IMO they handled that nerf poorly.   I respectfully disagree. It fixed two problems of the UCAV : the instantaneous ucav with a commander supply crate, the fact that you were rewarded for dying with a fresh new ucav and the fact that in CTF and obliteration, you could spawn as a support and instantly blow the poor fucker holding the flag or the bomb.  Not a perfect fix but the way i see it, you are rewarded for staying alive and not wasting tickets."
battlefield_4,3dyptj,Shorvok,4,Mon Jul 20 18:44:50 2015 UTC,"And I respectfully agree with your disagreement :D  First, I never thought about the commander crate, so good that they fixed that. CTF/Obli is in my opinion less of an issue with the ucav and more with the constant update of the soldier's position. In my opinion the more players are in the server - less frequent updates on his position and less bombardment of the poor bomb/flag carrier.  IMO the ucav is a poorly made gadget and in no way they can make it balanced and useful."
battlefield_4,3dyptj,batchick93,2,Mon Jul 20 18:57:49 2015 UTC,"Also, the time delay for using the UCAV was to stop the unbelievable UCAV spam at the start of a round of rush. I've seen 5-10 UCAVs take flight immediately at the start of a round, and if they're flown correctly, you can wipe out half the enemy team before they're even in sight."

battlefield_4,3dyptj,pickapart21,3,Tue Jul 21 11:15:40 2015 UTC,"As a ucav whore (55+stars) i feel they went overkill with the spawn timer on the ucav because items like the mortar have a shorter timer yet can provide more continuous cover. I fully agree it needed a delay  especially in games like defuse, but to penalize it that much more than the mortar is crazy."
battlefield_4,3dyptj,Screech47,3,Mon Jul 20 20:58:13 2015 UTC,i havnt played in a long time how was the ucav changed?
battlefield_4,3dyptj,smokeygaston,2,Mon Jul 20 18:10:38 2015 UTC,"Can't rearm, have to wait on a 90s cooldown or something along those lines to use it again. Plus it's damage/splash was reduced and you have to wait for the cooldown before you can use it after spawning.  And though I can't remember if this was a thing when it first came out, you can't use it while prone anymore."

battlefield_4,3dyptj,kevster2717,26,Mon Jul 20 18:40:12 2015 UTC,I haven't played in ages.  I don't get it. What am I looking at.
battlefield_4,3dyptj,VOZ1,13,Mon Jul 20 17:45:53 2015 UTC,XM25 = douchebag weapon UCAV = douchebag weapon Rail gun  = one shot kill at all ranges AWS = one of the best LMGs
battlefield_4,3dyptj,Sprgmr,12,Mon Jul 20 18:10:16 2015 UTC,"The Rorsch is not a one shot kill at all ranges. I know this from experience. It is a stupid, stupid weapon though."
battlefield_4,3dyptj,hey_aaapple,2,Mon Jul 20 18:19:56 2015 UTC,"Was before they nerfed it i believe, so he could have gotten those kills before then"
battlefield_4,3dyptj,tbone816,2,Mon Jul 20 18:29:38 2015 UTC,"Ah, yes. It makes sense that it would be nerfed."
battlefield_4,3dyptj,hey_aaapple,3,Mon Jul 20 18:30:31 2015 UTC,It's not nerfed but it's just the game being broken in general. The dusting (esp. against helicopters) occurs way too often with the Railgun that it's almost not viable especially after the patch. It's also very inconsistent against infantry as well. Sometimes you'd directly hit a guy right in his belly and get a hitmarker. At times you get an OHK with splash damage.
battlefield_4,3dyptj,tbone816,2,Mon Jul 20 21:07:22 2015 UTC,It's hilarious that you can one-shot disable a jet or help with it at absurd range. It's the one weapon in this game that seems 100% intended to troll players.
battlefield_4,3dyptj,dorekk,6,Mon Jul 20 20:38:47 2015 UTC,"I'll give 2.5 of those 4. UCAV was so stupid and easy at first it really wasn't fair. If you found a spot to hide and just spammed it was ludicrous. Now with how rarely you can use it might as well not even be in the game.   The Airburst I admit isn't a weapon you out gun your opponent with but it has its place. Finish off the guy who just went behind cover or get rid of campers. It re-supplies way slower than it used to which I think makes it more level since it only holds like 10 or so rounds iirc and it takes 3 go kill at least. It's so easy to use though: just zoom in on their cover, move your crosshairs over beside their cover and fire."
battlefield_4,3dyptj,CQReborn,5,Tue Jul 21 01:35:07 2015 UTC,"xm25 douchebag weapon   It takes 3 hits to kill even in locked mode, aiming it properly is not easy (when you scope in, the last position you pointed to when unscoped is used as a distance marker), it pretty much never resupplies, and anyone peeking out WILL kill you faster just by shooting."
battlefield_4,3dyptj,Actionable_Mango,5,Mon Jul 20 20:57:20 2015 UTC,"Not in my experiences. The people that use it always go behind the bars on the lower level of Operation locker. They also have a squad of people giving him cover fire as they proceed to kill us with the XM25 when we were 5 feet away from the hallway. The fact that you can kill people without them even having visual contact or any warning at all makes it quite the douchey weapon. And frankly, I find it very easy to use. I think they put it in the standard support class because it is simple to use.  The same is true for the mortar and UCAV, except, the UCAV actually takes some amount of brain power...  Idk maybe it's just me, but I hate being on the receiving end of these gadgets; I just don't think that they are balanced or fair."
battlefield_4,3dyptj,mauri11,5,Mon Jul 20 22:47:10 2015 UTC,"You mean, they use a gadget when it's most effective, in this case wiping out targets forced behind cover?  How terrible!   you can kill people without visual contact   Guess that makes claymores, C4, mortar, all grenades, all rocket lauchers, frag rounds, UCAV, and god knows how much else douchey too! Please don't tell me that you reallt think that because it would be sad.   I find it very easy to use   The simple fact that the DISTANCE at which the rounds detonate is determined in a way that is not ever explained or hinted at in game makes it not easy to use. Add in the massive damage difference between locked and not locked. And the fact that anyone looking in your direction can kill you faster.   I hate being on the receiving end   Everybody does, regardless of the other side using an XM25, an LMG, a sniper, or whatever. If they are playing good, they WILL be a severe annoyance to you. They are trying to kill you afterall, the fuck do you expect.   I just don't think that they are balanced   They are, an M320 will kill quicker under most cases and can be easily lobbed, frag rounds are less powerful per shot but much more versatile and easy to use, launchers can do a decent job too, by taking up the XM the support gives up a slot that could have had C4 or the anti explosive thingy (that counters the XM btw) or the mortar or other awesome gadgets.   or fair   Good luck defining ""fair"""
battlefield_4,3dyptj,C2B3,3,Mon Jul 20 22:57:27 2015 UTC,"Guys I found the support class lover  Hey man, I just stated my opinion. I didn't mean to start an argument or anything.  There are other weapons that do similar things, but these specifically give you no warning, while other things like grenades (specific warning indicators) and rockets do (you can hear them fire before they hit).  Either way, you haven't altered my opinion about getting killed by these weapons. I will never think that I died because the XM25 user that it squared off with had more skill than me. If he shot me in the back, great; he could have done the same with a gun. But you cannot tell me that he could have shot me 5 feet around a corner with any other gun.  You can go along with your opinion and I can go along with mine. Sitting here bitching at each other won't do anything."
battlefield_4,3dyptj,paramajik,3,Tue Jul 21 00:14:41 2015 UTC,"Yes, claymores, mortars, etc ARE all for douchebags!"
battlefield_4,3dyptj,TequilaWhiskey,3,Tue Jul 21 02:43:39 2015 UTC,"Don't be pedantic. The airburst is a known cheese gadget. This is like arguing who is a shittier comedian than Dane Cook, sure you could pick out some good candidates but that doesn't change the fact that hearing Dane Cook makes me want to kill myself.   Claymores are almost always your fault for running too fast in prime areas for them, C4s at least require you to be near the front line and in the line of fire from other C4s and grenades and gunfire, same for grenades and rocket launchers to an extent and most agree that UCAV and Mortar are also cheese weapons even if they aren't that bad anymore. Could you argue the airburst is in the same boat as UCAV and mortar? Sure, but that doesn't change the fact that it doesn't require good aim or any kind of thought to use it, you can just close your eyes and sit there putting infinite splash in an area from a mile away and get rewarded for it. It's just dumb, it's beyond arguing that it's dumb. The entire support kit gadget lineup is basically walking cancer that is either WAY too good or useless with barely any in-between."
battlefield_4,3dyptj,LittleClitoris,11,Mon Jul 20 23:09:40 2015 UTC,"I think it depends on the map.  Most complaints are about Metro and Locker, because of how effective the Airburst is at the choke points. And I'd agree with you there.   But I strongly prefer city maps like Siege. On maps like that, the Airburst is a valuable tool for dealing with rooftop campers who are above your position while you are playing PTFO. I've been on both sides of that equation and it seems pretty balanced to me."

Bad lag - Dusting is extremely common, no reg, single frame deaths and being shot around corners is really bad right now.  All classes but assault class got nerfed from their roles thanks to CTE being run by assault whores who only care about their class winning. Assault class got their ACE 23 buffed with higher magazine count so yeah for them.  Frame drops are more common.  Lock on spam is pretty out of control with the nerfs to the SRAW and the lack of updating vehicle countermeasures. Constant beep tone while flying anything or trying to drive a tank with mbt law/javelin spam.  With the shotgun insane damage and range buff, cqb's skill level has also greatly dropped and has turned into a mess.  Flash bangs also got a massive buff. So if you're in the blast area even with your back turned to the grenade, you're still blinded. Also issues with spawning on blinded squad mates or being rezzed. Carry 3 of the mini-suns per a life so they can be easily spammed.   Before the patch, everything was running pretty smoothly."
